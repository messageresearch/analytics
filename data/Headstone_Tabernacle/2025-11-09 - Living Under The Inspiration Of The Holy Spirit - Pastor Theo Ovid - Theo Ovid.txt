Psalms 46 from verse one says, "God is our refuge and strength, very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea, though the waters thereof be roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof s. There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most high. God is in the midst of her. She shall not be moved. God shall help her and that right. The heathen raged and the kingdoms were moved. He uttered his voice and the earth melted. The Lord of hosts is with us. The God of Jacob is our refuge. Sarah, may God have blessing to the reading of his word. Is the Lord your refuge this morning? Is he a hiding place this morning. And there's nowhere else to hide. You can hide in Jesus this morning.

Oh, tell [singing] me where could I go to one more time I go. Hallelujah. Seeking a refuge for my soul. Needed a friend to help me in the end. Oh go to the Lord. Can we give the Lord a hand of praise this morning? Blessed be the name of the Lord. Feels good in the house of the Lord this morning. There's a sound of victory in the camp. There's a sound of overcoming in the camp. There's a sound that you're not going to give up in the camp. There's a sound that you're an overcomer in the camp. There's a sound that the devil didn't destroy you last week in the camp. There's a sound that you're still standing this morning in the camp. You may be seated for a few minutes. Amen. And it's certainly a great privilege to be in the house of the Lord this morning and to be able to give God praise and thanks. And as the prophet said, to let the devil know whose side you're on, to let the angels know whose side you're on, to let the Lord knows whose side you're on. Listen church, there are some songs that the angels cannot sing because they cannot have gone through your journey and your experience. So when you say, "Where could I go but to the Lord?" That's a song that the angels can't understand because you have to have been somewhere to go to the Lord. So, we are so happy this morning that we could be in the house of the Lord and we could stand with faith and confidence that he who started the work in us is more than able to bring it to pass. I'm fully persuaded that neither life nor death nor things past, present, or to come could separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus concerning us this morning. Can we give the Lord a hand of praise? certainly appreciate a song service brother Anthony and the atmosphere because you create a result. You have to control the atmosphere around you. You have to control the environment around you and that comes from the inside out. We are not influenced from the outside in. We are creatures of eternity trapped in time. And the prophet taught us that we are not even the believer but the word seen in us is a believer. That's why the Bible said greater is he that's in you than he that is in the world. And I want us to remember that inside of us is something more powerful than everything outside of us. &gt;&gt; Can we say that one more time? There's something in us that's more powerful than anything else that's outside of us. And if we rest our faith and confidence on he who started the work, then nothing could stop you. Sickness cannot stop you. Disease cannot stop you. Oppression cannot stop you. Frustration cannot stop you. Depression cannot stop you. Nothing could stop you from coming into a full manifestation of who God called us to be this morning. Just a few announcements and a few comments before we get into the service this morning. And certainly I want to really salute the young people who had the fellowship yesterday. Let's put our hands together. It was beyond my expectation. It was an outstanding first salvo if I can say that into the vision that the Lord has placed on the hearts of a number of the young people who have a burden to see the young people set free and we were sharing with them and just a few brief comments you know about this concept of value. You know the world likes to place value on certain things and if you place value on what is temporal or what is temporary then that value is something that will fade away. But when you place value on something that is eternal, that value lasts forever. So we want to think about those things which are above. And I gave a very simple analogy to help the young people who were there. And I said, "If you bring a monkey into a room and present him with a banana or a bag of money and young uh Steven's youngest, young daughter Sarah, I asked Sarah. Sarah is how old Stephen?" She's seven years old. Said, "If Sarah could get it, everybody will get it." I said, "What will the monkey do if it sees a banana on one side and a bag of money on the other side?" And little Sarah said she will. the monkey will take the banana because it's the nature of the monkey to take the banana. The monkey doesn't have a revelation that with a bag of money he could buy a thousand bananas because his mind is not there. He's looking at this temporary satisfaction that he sees on this one banana. He doesn't have a revelation of the mystery that with the bag of money he could buy a plantation of bananas and have bananas for his great grandchildren. So he runs to this thing that he could see and he grabs this one thing that he could get right now and he walks away from the money because he doesn't see value to that thing. And that's how many times we live. We look at this temporary thing and we don't see this value of this eternal mystery of God. And at times and brother Steven came to me he said the first time he saw it this way because in a certain sense we are almost like those monkeys. The actual monkeys have no souls, but we have a soul. But many times it's as if God who is greater than us hiding than us. For he said, "My thoughts are higher than your thoughts. My ways are higher than your ways." And God is looking at us and saying, "But what's wrong with you? You keep going after this. You're you're you're into a monkey business. You keep going after this banana, this banana, and in this bag here is your health, is your healing, is eternal life, is your children, is your grandchildren. But you're going after this thing all the time, and you're satisfied with this temporary thing. But when you get a revelation into the mind of God that you are a creature of eternity, you'll go for that bag every single time. Because faith is the substance. It's purchasing power. &gt;&gt; Faith is not the thing. No, no. It is the is the purchasing power. It's the evidence of what you cannot see yet. So you're looking at the bag. It's not a it's not a a thousand bananas yet, but it could get you that thousand bananas. So this morning, being here in the house of God is the most important meeting you could ever have. It's more important than your job because this could give you a better job this morning. It's more important than your doctor's appointment because this could prevent you from having to go to the doctor. Hallelujah. There's no place I'd rather be than in the presence of the Lord because in his presence there's fullness of joy. There's life ever more. There's the mystery of calling my name. Who I am in God. Not who I see myself but who God sees. Can the church say amen? So, I really want to salute the young people who were there and we'll have much more of that. And uh I want you to remember our pastor in prayer. He would have preached on Friday night in France. He would have preached in Germany on Saturday, which is last night. He would have preached in Germany again this morning. And he's on the move. So, may God give him strength and we are under great expectation. We would have sent out the announcement in the church group about our special meeting coming up on December 13th and 14th. And if you remember, we had Jonathan Martin in September. By the grace of God, we're looking for brother Andrew Glover to come minister to the portion of the bride here in Trinidad. Just like brother Jonathan, it will be his first time on this island and we are under great expectation. He has a tremendous ministry and I know that God has something very special for us. So, let's get ready. Let's make preparation for it. Let's be in the spirit. So, that's the 13th and 14th of December. School confirmed is closing on the 12th. So, have no excuse. They could be here on fire. They have no homework to do. They This is This is the best thing. This is the This is the real closing out of the of the school term. This is preparing for 2026 because this year is already done. And God in his grace and mercy has put things in place so we could close it this year with a shout. All the victory you didn't have this whole year, this is the season now to claim it. What the devil took from you, what you didn't get to possess, this is the season to possess it. Even before the meeting comes, you in a mode of possession. you in a mode of walking on top of the devil, walking on top of your promise, claiming your inheritance because this is this is your season. Last Wednesday I said if everything is all right, you don't need faith. If your life is perfect and you have no issues, what you need faith for? Faith becomes relevant and necessary when there is a gap between where you want to be and where you are. And the further this gap is, the more faith you need. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? And faith is the currency of God's economy. So when God wants to see your bank account of faith high, then he creates and allows gaps to exist, gaps of sickness, gaps of issues so that faith could be spent. Because if there was no situation, then there's no currency, there's no economy, there's no transactions. Do you know the natural economy will die up if there's no transactions? What cripples an economy is when there's no transaction? Nobody buying or selling or doing anything. You in your house, everybody. No, then the place is dead. God has a whole bank up in the sky. He has healing on this shelf. He has deliverance on this shelf. And he's looking for people to come and do some spiritual commercial activity. Make a withdrawal of faith. Hallelujah. Brother Brandon give the analogy of signing the check. He said when you're adopted, your signature is just as good as the father's signature. But they need a check because they will honor the check. And the check from the our father, it don't bounce. If you pay for your salvation, it paid for. It don't bounce. If you pay for redemption, it paid for. This check cannot bounce. You could write on that check whatever you need this morning. You have back pain, write back pain on that check and cash it out this morning. You don't have joy, write joy on the check. Cash it out. It's good. It's a good check. This check could work anywhere. Even the devil respects this check because it's the Oh, come on now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't have to leave here sick. You don't have to leave here depressed. You don't have to leave here discouraged. You are more than a conqueror. Put a smile on your face. Lift up your head. Square your shoulders back. You are creatures born to tabernacle the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost is looking for a house this morning. And the house is not headstone tabernacle. The house is right here. You and you and you and you and you. The Holy Ghost is looking for a tabernacle this morning. Will you give him yours? Hallelujah. So stay on fire. Exercise your faith. Brother described faith is something to have hair on its chest. In other words, in the face of the opposition, let faith speak. What words you use is the product of your faith. &gt;&gt; Don't walk around. I shared on Wednesday night that woman who had a son who died when she was moving fast. They say what's going on? Why you breaking your speed limit? You say all is well because she would not let come out of her mouth anything negative. She would not let come out of her mouth the problem she was dealing with. She knew that if she could just get to the prophet Elijah, all is well. And she was living in such faith she already see it as a finished work. All is well. Don't interrupt me with your foolishness. Don't interrupt me with your unbelief. If you don't want to believe, that's up to you. But all is well this morning. All is well. I'm already healed. All is well. My family's already delivered. All is well. I'm already rejoicing. All is well. I've got peace ever more. All is well. My bank account has money in it. All is well. Don't I don't care what the banker says because my bank is not here. It's in the sky. I don't care what the doctor's report said. All is well. I don't care how I feel. All is well. All is well. All is well. Turn to your neighbor and say, "All is well." Hallelujah. Turn to your other neighbor and say, "All is well." Do you know when you say those words, the devil is trembling? Because the devil want to give you a mind battle that you have this problem and that problem. But we are letting the devil know this morning, all is well. The Lord gives. The Lord take it away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. All is well. He's a healer. He's a way maker. He's a restorer. He's a baptizer. He promised a revival. He promised healing. He promised deliverance. He promised breakthrough. He promised to open the blind eyes. He promised to heal cancer. He promised to destroy diabetes. He promised to break the grip of high blood pressure, female condition, the curse of poverty. I don't care what it is. All is well. Victorious vibrations. When you walk, the devil must tremble. Oh, you don't hear me this morning. I'm tired of being on the defensive. Let's get on the offensive. We are taking back what the devil took from us. We have a right to do it. We have the authority to do it. We have been called to do it. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. This joy that I have, the world didn't give it to me. Cigarette cannot give you this. Drugs cannot give you this. Alcohol cannot give you this. A party, they could try, but it cannot do this thing. Brother George, I'm just testing the temperature. I'm just testing the temperature. Hallelujah. Some people look like the devil punch you this way and punch it this way. Do you know that you could punch the devil back? There's a quote where the brother said whack him. &gt;&gt; And if it don't work the first time, what what did the prophet say? Whack him again. And if it don't work again, what he said? Whack him again. So what we come to do here this morning, we come to whack the devil. I'm tired of being the one against the ropes. I'm tired of being the one against the wall. It's time we put the devil on the wall. It's time we push back. It's time we say healing today, not tomorrow. Now faith is today. Today. Today. The young people will go free today. The Holy Ghost must pour out today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Brother, I'm so excited. &gt;&gt; Keep the motors humming. God has a special plan for your life. Listen, the government could have plans. Your school could have plans. I'm not talking about those plans. God has a plan for your life. And that plan, he said, "I know the plans." Oh, come, plans of peace, plans of joy, plans to bring you to an expected end. God is not now designing your life. God is not now trying to figure out what am I going to do with brother George? What am I going to do with sister Williams? What am I going to do with brother Steven? God already sees you victorious. You are walking through the tape of your life and God say, "I know the ending." You may be seated. I'm getting ready to close out. Listen, you ever sit down next to somebody and you're watching a movie and they say, "I know the ending." It could be frustrating because they they're talking to you next. I don't want to know. I trying to enjoy the thing and they they pushing. Hey, hey, look him, look him. Look under the table. Oh gosh. Well, let me figure that out. But in this story of your life, God don't see all the parts &gt;&gt; because that's how full knowledge works. That leads to predestination. And in all the parts when your family excited and you stressed out, God saying, "Don't worry about that part." The angel's looking at the tape and the angel's doing and Don't don't worry about that part. Bookie box like don't worry about that part. I know what happening next. When your favorite character in trouble, you wondering if they're going to make it into it. And God is saying, "Don't worry. There's another part coming. There's another piece of the movie. There's another part of the story. Wait till you get to the end. It'll all come together. Wait till you get to the end of the story. You'll see how strong he is, how powerful he is. the seed that's in him that the devil could never have destroyed. You don't hear me this morning. &gt;&gt; That's the God we serve. He knows the end from the beginning. So, I want to encourage you when we come to church on Sunday, this is the Lord's day. It's a You're supposed to be so excited to be here on a Sunday. You can't wait. You're counting down the week Sunday is coming. Hallelujah. Everybody feeling fine? &gt;&gt; Let's all stand to our feet this morning. We're going to hear from our pastor a special message for you. Living under the influence of the Holy Spirit. And I know it's going to be a tremendous blessing to you. God bless you, brothers. Let's switch over. Stay on fire. God bless you, Richie. Let [singing] your hands angle. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelu [music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Jesus. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Lift up your voices. Lift up your hands right now. Now give the Lord a shout of praise right now. Lift up your voices. Give the Lord a shout of praise right now. Hallelujah. Glory is here. The glory of his presence, the same Holy Ghost, the same Jesus is here. Hallelujah. Glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you for the praise. Thank you for your presence. Hallelujah. Keep praising him. Keep worshiping. Hallelujah. Thank you Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory God. Without a doubt we know something is fixing to happen. Without a doubt, we know that we are coming to the closing of a doubt to be prepared for your coming. That's why Elijah to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers. Father anoint them to your word today. Father become flesh among us that the invisible visible grant in Jesus name we ask it. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Bless you. Greetings from Paris. This morning 2122 want to go 24-23. And when he had said, he showed unto him his hands and his side, Then glad when they saw the Jesus unto them again as my father had sent me. And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said unto them, receive the Holy Ghost. And he said unto them, these are the words which I speak unto you. while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the in the in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me. Then open their understanding that they might understand the scriptures. And he said unto them, "Thus it is written and thus it be Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations at Jerusalem and your witnesses of these things. And behold, I send the promise of my father upon you the city of Jerusalem until you be on high." And he led them out as far as he lifted up his hands and blessed them. And it came to pass while he blessed them from them and carried up in heaven. And they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy. And they were continually in the temple praising blessing. Revelation 5. And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and the 420 elders before the lamb, having every one of them full of the praise of the saints, they s worthy to take the book and to open the seas thereof. For thou was slain, has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation, and has made us unto our God kings and priests. We shall reign on the earth. And I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beast and the elders and the number of them was 10,000 times 10,000 and thousands of thousand saying with a loud voice, worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as in the sea and all that are in them. I sing blessing and honor and glory and unto him that sit upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever. And the four beast said, "Amen." And the four and 20 elders fell and worship him that live forever and ever. Let us pray one more time. Father, we thank you for your word. We pray come and interpret to our hearts and may pour out your spirit and confirm your word with signs, wonders, and miracles. We pray bless those here. Bless those connected us on the internet. May your spirit flow freely and speak to every heart. We pray in Jesus name we ask it. Amen. And amen. You will be seated. Oh, praise God. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's a good thing to be in the house of God. &gt;&gt; It's always a privilege to be in the house of God. &gt;&gt; God give you health and strength and your you are here. You want to get the benefit of being here in the service of the Lord. Amen. How many appreciate the service last Sunday? Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit. God bless you, brother Isaac. That was message that was some sermon I tell you my god my mind was totally blown oh my so enjoyed it I was able to take it across there France so we are not creating a new standard the standard already exists &gt;&gt; oh praise God a standard of holiness standard of righteousness standard of purity a standard of forgiveness a standard of seven living voices the stand always was and always will be. &gt;&gt; The standard is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. Only only the Lord can put these things together like that. Oh my. The people have been taught the church has a standard but left the standard. When brother left the earth, he didn't the standard didn't leave. Isn't that right? The standard was in the hand of the spirit and the spirit revealed it to whomsoever he will. &gt;&gt; So nobody what the spirit can reveal. Isn't that wonderful? So the spirit can reveal the whooever he will. Isn't that right? Blessed be the name of the Lord. So the standard was always here. Isn't that right? In the hand of the spirit. The Holy Ghost is the standard bearer that will stand with any man who stands with the word. I love that. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is the standard bearer. We stand with any man who stays with the word. And this is the bomb for me. The spirit has no loyalty to man. &gt;&gt; He only has loyalty to his word. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Do you see it now? &gt;&gt; The spirit have no loyalty to any man. So why run after a man? Praise God. Stay with the word. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Hallelujah. Fight for the word. Stand by the word. The word is God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. This is so beautifully phrased. obedience to the entire word entitles you to be acer. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Love that. Entitle you to the Holy Ghost. Entitled to the token. Follow me to the entire word. Entitle you to be by the standard is the spirit that follows the word. &gt;&gt; Oh, you are free this morning &gt;&gt; to be what God made you to be. Isn't that right? I so enjoy that message. I was tremendously blessed. Praise God. Is a message I want to get on print or put it out that you can read it. Something that you really consider. Praise God. That God will follow his word. You see, when you go down deeper, you realize no respector of persons. I don't care if you're pastor, son, pastor, daughter, elder son, elder daughter, deacon son, deacon daughter, deacon elder. It doesn't matter who you think you are, what you are. God's standard is his word and we have to come up to his word doesn't matter what position somebody hold as I told them in parish God is not adopting the position he's adopting the man so you don't get to engineer a doctor that is irrelevant what are you as a person what are you as a person youise when I come to church I don't That has nothing to do. He want you. Praise God. We told them in Paris is a father. He want that connection between you and him. Praise God. Church supposed to be to rescue man and reconcile man and bring back to God. Not a system, not a church, but back to God. But when you leave here and you make your prayer, God can answer your prayer &gt;&gt; because there's a deep inside of you. There's a cry inside of you. I'm sinking. Who is talking? Lord, let me restore to me the joy of my salvation. Who is talking? A son is talking. Do I hear him in the house? &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So, God is not interested in your party. interesting you come into maturity fire under your seat if you have to because you want to have a perfect church and have a perfect man boy inherit nothing you can't possess nothing in immaturity you got to come to accept responsibility I will arise I will say unto my father I have s I have failed and I can say amen somebody might by power but by my spirit say God Almighty. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Every kingdom is shaken. &gt;&gt; Every kingdom is shaking. &gt;&gt; Europe shaking. America shaking. Everything is rocking. You know the world is actually falling apart. So why you want the world? When everything is mashed up all around you. Oh glory to God. We have a word that cannot be moved. Heaven will pass away. But this word will never pass away. America don't even know what they have. &gt;&gt; My Jesus. Thank God. God's kingdom is not election. &gt;&gt; By man's election and man. Thank God. You don't have the people's vote to vote into this position and vote into that position in the kingdom of God. God have election. His election is his chosen. And if God chose to deliver you this morning, there's not enough devils last night, last year is not enough that could stop you from your deliverance tonight. I believe this morning that somebody going to be set freeise. This church is a different church. This is avereign church. We do what we want to do, how we want to do it. We have no bishop. We have nobody to tell us what to do and how to do it. We We have a revival this morning. We have a revival this morning. We feel old sillmon chasing. You name it, we can praise God because we can speak it and see it come to pass. Lord shout in the house. Praise God. Amen. time in Paris. Praise the name of the Lord. Praise God. We fight to do the people over fight and then leave inheritance. We have seen the Lord. That was a group testimony of the disciples Christ resurrection ministry. We have seen the Lord since we have seen the Lord. Seen revelation inspiration. We have seen the Lord. But that was that seeing the Lord is to point us to dynamics in the upper room. &gt;&gt; It wasn't Jesus staying with them, walking with them. No, he raised from the dead. to open their understanding and open the word. That is all. Because once your understanding is open and the word is your word is open to you, you know what you have to possess. &gt;&gt; You know where you have to go. &gt;&gt; There is no other way to go. There's only one place. The place of that position of the upper room. And in that upper room, they were praising and blessing God now and again once in a while when they feel like that's not what the Bible says. They were praising God continually and you have to learn to do that your trying circumstance you have headache pain whatever it is disasters you have to still worship &gt;&gt; because it's a promise praise God hallelujah is a promise to you amen this morning living under the inspiration of the holy spirit &gt;&gt; that's my title this morning living under the inspiration of the holy You don't want to live under demon powers. You don't want to live under the world. You don't want to live under your feeling and emotions. You don't want to live under that. You want to be living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. And I have inspiration. These are the words. That's the first thing Jesus told them. These are the words. He didn't give them more words and new words. the same words that he had before. Hallelujah. Bring it back and make it more positive. Give the Lord a shout in the house. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah. Praise be to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you, don't be discouraged this morning. The Holy Spirit is with you. He's looking over you. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. All right, let's go. Bible says I want to Isaac preached but Isaac preached but Satan makes appealing his shows and so it's appealing is appealing but the enemy keeps finding a better bait. had to keep improving his tactics but he had to strip off a little more and so right to his &gt;&gt; God doesn't have to make his word more prettier and so on his to make it more appealing the only thing he has to do is to raise up a standard of his own word against the enemy. &gt;&gt; And the Bible said when the enemy comees, what does he do? He makes the word that he already said more. &gt;&gt; So that's why Jesus come and tell them these are the words. I come to make positive to you because I want to give you an absolute guarantee that this promise of the father, it is guaranteed. &gt;&gt; Behold, I send the promise of my father upon you. It is guaranteed. So, I'm going to raise a standard in your spirit, in your life. Then he brea upon them receiving the Holy Ghost. The breath of God was upon them. They were living under anointing, anointing of promise, anointing of dynamics, anointed to receive. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Praise God. Praise his wonderful name. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? So what says he takes the word that he already said and make it more positive. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not not not new words, not not new mysteries. Same ones he was telling them all along. You have to make it more real to them. In the last new year, the more they hear, the more they feel good about what they do. See, but this is not that. &gt;&gt; Jesus was talking to them. They wasn't catching a lot of stuff he was telling them because they didn't have revelation. You see, revelation gives you a certain behavior. &gt;&gt; I don't care what country you're from, what language you speak, revelation comes from God. Not from what you read and study. That's your study. But when it's revealed, it brings stimulation. It brings excitement. It brings real expectation. Isn't that right? So brother says, you know, the Bible says when the enemy comes up and God, there we go. When God gives his church a blessing and they move along with that blessing until it become the world, then they begin to run it down. Then the spirit of God comes in and raise up a standard again and there's a breaking for a revival or something. The message going slow to get it right and righteous and know everything but there's no revival comfortable in the comfort zone and so on but afterward a revival breaks out. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? And we have a promise. What we see happen should put every soul in action. It should make a church that would make a revival that people be flying from Europe to see what's taking place. Not here to see. They will say there's a place in Arizona called Maricopa Valley, a city called Phoenix. There is something broke out there that the seven th that the prophet Speak of &gt;&gt; praise God. Not the bunch of churches all around. No, not that. No, this prophecy here. These are the words. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. These are the words you have to connect with. These are the words. Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. So he contin of his last seven angels church age what the mystery of God all about God how God is but one God all these things will be finished at that time the great battles back had got these loose ends hanging out ought to be wrapped up together in this age so the thunders could all the loose ends had to be tied before you could get your portion the loose in your life have to be tied up. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? So brother, we end the Holy Spirit influence us to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Let God do the influencing in our hearts and not be influenced by others. But as I said, a powerful thing that people can get desensitized to the Holy Spirit. But the Holy Spirit will bring conviction. Holy Spirit will bring you wrong. You should I told him in Paris, I rather somebody wrong in their right in their right and wrong in their spirit. When somebody right in their spirit, they could be corrected. &gt;&gt; When somebody wrong in their spirit, that's terrible. But they're wrong in their spirit. Oh, that's a religious spirit. That's a demon, actually. Oh, hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord. So watch, let the Holy Spirit influence us to the word of God and let God do the influence in our hearts and not be influenced by others. This ought to put us in action with reverence and humility. The pill of fire among us again in the last days he will pour out his spirit. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Do you believe this is your promise? believe this is your promise that you have promised the spirit upon your life. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Amen. Lord, confirm it right now. While I'm before your throne, take every one of these people, Lord. Take the world out of us. Take me, Lord, while we are here in your presence. Just take the world. Ring our hearts, God, right now. Pull the world and the cares of the world away from us. Let us be consecrated Christians, oh God, to be loving and kind and sweet, bearing the fruit of the spirit, won't you, Lord? We throne. Sain on every one of us, but your blood can remit it Lord. Make it white as snow. Grant it while we are waiting upon you. Take us. We are yours. Consecrated our lives to you in Jesus name. Grant it Lord to each one of us. Ring my heart out Lord. I see all my errors. You are not here to see somebody else errors. You are here to see what problem you have. Everybody here if you fix up, you don't have to come here. You don't sick people coming here. People that have needs come here. People looking for deliverance, they come here. People looking for breakthrough and help, they come here. Hallelujah. People don't know what to do, they come here, too. Praise God. You're not coming here because you're right. They come here because you're wrong. And you need a breakthrough. You're not coming here because not nice and you're looking for God to intervene. You're looking for supernatural breakthrough. Then you're in the right place. Oh, hallelujah. You're not coming to find no deliverance. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. You're not coming here to see who, where, what. That's none of your business. Mind your own business. You're coming to fight for your portion. To fight for your soul. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Ring my heart, Lord. I see all my errors. I see my God from this time. I'm trying to live the best that I can. &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to go. I want to you across here this morning after bringing this indictment against my man friends out there. I have to say these hard things. Lord, I did it by your inspiration. I feel you told me to do it. Now it's off my shoulders. I'm glad it's off. Let them do it whatever they will. Father, I pray they will accept it. I pray it would save everyone. Lord, may there come for a revival of the justy prophecy and pray for a revival of the just and a great power come among the churches just before it is going. &gt;&gt; It is not too hard to pray that because you promised it and we are looking for that we knew do great things in our midst. It's not too hard to pray because he promises. And if he promises, God can't lie. The Lord &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you love that quote? &gt;&gt; The revival of the just. Who is the just? The justified. You are justified as talking foolishness who God justify who cannal Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That means for you to be justified, you have to get a revelation that your name is on the book. &gt;&gt; That means you have to get a revelation of Elohim. &gt;&gt; Before there was a moon, before there was a star, before there was a molecule, before there was a beginning, before the You were there. Give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory. Glory. Glory. &gt;&gt; This morning, brother sent me this morning. Scripture, the blood of Jesus Christ, his son from all sorts of you. You know, Christian doesn't have any sin initially the blood of the lamb &gt;&gt; God does not impute to you anything that's done because you are under the blood and he doesn't see it &gt;&gt; there is a blood sacrifice the only can see you in the way he show you before the foundation of the world when he put your name in the lamb's book of life. That is all he can look at because you are redeemed from everything that was ever done. You are in the blood of the lamb. Therefore, there is no in you. There is no unclean habit in you because that the blood of the lamb have did this and God cannot impute sin to you after you got sin offering laying waiting for you. Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well you say I can do what I want to do always. But when a man can see what Jesus done for him and turn and do something contrary to him it shows he never received Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh give the Lord a shout. Do you love him this morning? &gt;&gt; Oh, bless. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the living God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Praise Jesus. So that is why the Bible says watch this. John was &gt;&gt; no tears. He wasn't happy. He wasn't hallelujah. Glory glory. No, &gt;&gt; they have words in that book. Hallelujah. His name is in that book. &gt;&gt; Your name is the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You are part of that book. &gt;&gt; So he want that book to be released so that he can go back on the earth. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Caught up in that dimension. But come back on the earth until that book is unfolding. &gt;&gt; So John is correctly weeping. &gt;&gt; He is crying. &gt;&gt; A man filled with the Holy Ghost. He is weeping because no man was found to take the book. Notice the scripture read. &gt;&gt; So therefore your worship will express to me express to us whether you have any revelation. So when you see somebody quiet, they can't worship. They're looking, they're looking, they're looking, they know something is wrong. &gt;&gt; You have to behave the same way because there is only one Lord. There's only one spirit. There's only one baptism and there's only one behavior. When you're living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, there is only one Just by the room, just by the upper room. This is a very important service. This will se the upper room and if you can't worship you have no revelation because God is not coming out your head on top of your memory and your intellect. God is coming. Praise God. That's why they got to understand the Lord is good and he is going to be worshiped. Everything worship the elders worship the angels worship the four worship. Oh, and they were in the upper room and they were praising God before the dynamics fell. of the spirit. But before you have to break into revelation with your weight Am I worship? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That has nothing to do with worship. I have nothing to eat between that worship. That has nothing to do with worship. Come on now. That has nothing to do. Jesus said it's not worshiping this one. You cannot stop a believer. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; You know what this is? This is the jubilee of the seventh seal. Oh, glory to God. We are breaking into the jubilee. What said the church, &gt;&gt; not moaning, not my God, not believe. My God, it look like somebody see their name. It look like some brother see his name. It look like some sisters see their name. You may be seated. Praise God. Praise God. Brother said, "No minist bring a revival. &gt;&gt; I love what God did. &gt;&gt; So then when people run after some man who man they love they chose and whatn not they figure he's the man or whatever that's the business. He said the revival has to come from the people. &gt;&gt; So somehow this vision of God &gt;&gt; has to be transferred to you the people. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the reason that God, &gt;&gt; the church fell in the beginning, &gt;&gt; the reason it fell is because the people take the spirit and put it on a man. &gt;&gt; And God say, "I hate it." &gt;&gt; I hate it. God said that &gt;&gt; the prophet said God is the God of the audience. &gt;&gt; You shall be my people &gt;&gt; and I shall be your God. &gt;&gt; He's a jealous God. &gt;&gt; So when man play God is trouble. Have no other gods before me. &gt;&gt; I am the Lord thy God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Have no other gods before me. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, I feel the presence of God here this morning. That pillar of fire is hanging here this morning. &gt;&gt; When that pillar of fire begin to move, this church going to change. Trinidad going to change the world going to change. The message going to change. When that same pill of fire that came out be to move among the people. Watch what God going to do. &gt;&gt; Nobody want to join that church. Bible said the Lord added to the church such as would be saved. No man just tried to join to them. &gt;&gt; Oh God wanted that church clean. God wanted that church pure. God wanted that church. But the devil want to destroy it. &gt;&gt; Big shots find and complain too much of noise. Quiet quiet don't make much of noise. &gt;&gt; You know who come to you today. &gt;&gt; You don't want to offend the duck. &gt;&gt; And then they start to give special seats &gt;&gt; to special people &gt;&gt; and then rebuke and change. How come you just selecting and giving special seats because of who the person is? God has no respect of persons to backslide because in God's sight we are sons and daughters. &gt;&gt; I'm a son behind here and you are son there. &gt;&gt; We are the same. We are sons and daughters. I'm in a position to speak the word because of what God called me to do. You are not. I am in this position. You are here to worship. You say amen. Because if your name is here every word you say God don't want you keep that for yourself. God want to say amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. Open your mouth and give the Lord some praises right now. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I feel your faith being anointed. &gt;&gt; A seven of faith. &gt;&gt; Being anointed to push for dynamics, to push for charity, to push for the Holy Ghost. You may be seated. Canaan does not represent the age of the millennium. It represents the age of the overcomer. &gt;&gt; The dispensation of overcoming because in Canaan they kill and burn and took cities. &gt;&gt; So this cross over Jordan and everything is wonderful. No sorry it's not like that. They cross Jordan and you have to fight. &gt;&gt; Shout out fight. What you have to do? &gt;&gt; Fight everyday fight. &gt;&gt; Not a Sunday fight. &gt;&gt; The devil wait until your tomorrow. He taking holidays because he recognizes days is numbered. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's not trying to stop you from coming to perfection. Let your family do this, your children do this, your grandchildren do that, your husband do this, your wife do that to try to disturb your But you still have to fight. &gt;&gt; Don't let your wife fool you. Don't let your husband fool you. Don't let you fool you. Stay focused and fight. Do I hear some Amen. &gt;&gt; David knew he was anointed king. &gt;&gt; You talk about fighting. &gt;&gt; David fight. &gt;&gt; David say, "Oh, Saul, you're leaving now. When you're moving out your furniture for me to move in, move in. Saul is after him. &gt;&gt; David want to play mad and all spitting and fing all kind of play mad to escape. David doing everything to escape. You have to fight, &gt;&gt; run, talk, disguise himself. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Tell you &gt;&gt; because the throne is yours. Fight &gt;&gt; because him that overcome it will sit with me in my throne as I overcome. I said my father in this fight because it belong to the overcomer. &gt;&gt; Oh, we give our shout in the house. &gt;&gt; This land belong to you. Believe that. I want you to believe that &gt;&gt; justification Moses in Egypt sanctification through the pillar of fire atonement of the sacrificial lamb in the wilderness. Then entering into the land that has been promised. &gt;&gt; So this message has been a journey, &gt;&gt; a destination. &gt;&gt; The promise is not the wilderness. We on a journey to a promise &gt;&gt; that God has made. &gt;&gt; So don't give up now. &gt;&gt; Why you giving up now? &gt;&gt; Raise the standard. &gt;&gt; Judah, &gt;&gt; raise a stand. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. So watch now. What is the land promised to the New Testament believer? The promise is the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; That is the promise. &gt;&gt; It shall come to pass 28, I'll pour out my spirit. Question and answers. Now watch. Today the church has come to justification through Luther through sanification through the Methodist. And now to the time of the promise. The promise is the baptism of the spirit which is promised all through the old testament and the new. The promise behold I send the promise of my father upon you. &gt;&gt; That is the promise. &gt;&gt; You can't pray. You can't get victory. You can't go and say a prayer. The promise is the Holy Ghost. When the Holy Ghost come upon you, you will see your prayer change, victory change, your attitude change. That is the promise. It's a new heart. I'll give you a new spirit. I'll give you. But that new heart, a new spirit is not the real thing yet. He promised the Holy Spirit to put in the center of that new heart a new spirit. That's the promise. &gt;&gt; I I'll write my laws in their heart. That's the promise. The word to become spirit in your life. That's the promise. The word to be quickened in your life. That's the promise. &gt;&gt; Again, I'll fight for that one. Again, I fight with that one. I fight for this one. Fight with everybody. They going to fight with you yet. everybody else but you &gt;&gt; caugh up in your own human spirit. When you get the Holy Ghost, all them fights done &gt;&gt; because you recognize you are your biggest enemy. &gt;&gt; And you will stop making excuses and you'll get the devil running the right thing. You can't run that devil. &gt;&gt; So what? The promised land. There we go. The promised land. Are you ready? &gt;&gt; Is to live in this land of Holy Spirit. That's your promise. &gt;&gt; Waking up in it, you're sleeping in it. You're walking in it. &gt;&gt; As many as are led by the spirit, they are the sons of God. This is your promise. I want you to see as your promise, not the preacher promise. Your promise. You're frustrated. No, that's not your promise. You're depressed. That's not your promise. Shake that off &gt;&gt; and accept that your promise is to really live in the land of the Holy Spirit. That's God's promise for the church is to live in the power of the spirit. It's another world. It's another land. You have to come out of the condition you have been in to come and live in this promised land. &gt;&gt; You have to come out the condition you're in. Change your attitude. Change your thinking. Change your thoughts. You shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Praise be to Jesus. Now, here's where I get to. I want to get to but this is where his vision from. As Daniel heard the seven thunders and forbidden and John heard the voices and this book was sealed and the back of book was sealed with seven seals. But in the days of these seals to be open the mystery of God would be finished. In other words, God would be known to his church not in three people but as one person. &gt;&gt; The mystery of God will be revealed. And when that was completely revealed, then the seven mysteries, which is the seven talking about will be open to the church. &gt;&gt; Because in there, the church would be living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, him moving in and out, showing him signs of being alive among us. &gt;&gt; That's a promise &gt;&gt; to be living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. And moving in and out. &gt;&gt; He could do a miracle today, a healing today, a deliverance today. He move in, he move out. He resto backs today. Somebody get to deliverance today. He move in, he move out. Him moving in, but you're living under the inspiration. That's where we are right now. Living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, creating an atmosphere. God cannot come down and dry. That's why they were in the upper room creating an atmosphere praising and blessing God continually. Yes, you have challenges. Don't let that stop your praises. Oh, glory to God. You have problems. Don't let that stop your praises. When you come here, you come here to worship. That's what the word God means. It means object of worship. You come here to look. You come here to worship. You're coming to be a participator. Praise God. Hallelujah. I don't care if you're a deacon inside of here, a usher inside of here, you still have to worship. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Worship with your hand or eye open. Praise God. Lift your hands. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Walk like some military deacon that you can't worship. It's God you're serving. &gt;&gt; If you want to win the military, go and join the army. But inside your worship, you are worshiper first. Before you deacon, you're worshiper first. Before your elder worship first before usher, you're worship first. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Jesus said, "Woman will all come when the true worshippers will worship the father in spirit and in truth. For the father seek such to worship him." &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout. You may be seated &gt;&gt; from Revelation book of symbols. Remember Daniel was told by the angel Daniel heard seven thunders. They uttered their voices. He grabbed his pen to write. He said, "Don't write it. Don't write it." John told the same thing. It has already been written outside of the Bible. Had seven seals on the back of the book. No man could open those seals. That was them voices. &gt;&gt; So the seals on the back of the book was voices. &gt;&gt; So you couldn't see the voices, but the voices were what revealed what's inside the book. hide the voice inside of there. So take seven seals on the back and put it under the seven seal on the inside to make sure there seven seals not 14 seals. &gt;&gt; If he didn't do that would be 14 seals. Seven on the back, seven on the inside. But the voices on the back, he called it voices. &gt;&gt; The books were sealed with voices. &gt;&gt; Seven voices. &gt;&gt; Could have gone further. No man knew what it was. But the Bible said and told and that the These seven voices would be known by the real true church. &gt;&gt; So if that is so then the real true church must have king worship. &gt;&gt; If it's revealed to you the worship. &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So we could see who sees their name on the book. &gt;&gt; Oh praise God. see your name in the book. You'll be shouting. You'll be praising God. You'll be worshiping. Praise be to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Seven voices. Seven voices through seven ages. Isn't that right? Praise God. And God gathered up into the son of man which is William. He was a son of man revealing the son of man. Isn't that right? And God through the mouth of the prophet spoke back out. Seven thunders out. And the seven voices that was thundering through seven ages is now spoken back out. But when you receive the word, you receive seven voices. And God going to change that one voice into seven voices. No wonder the devil going to be shut up. No wonder going be shaken in Trinidad. And where there was voices, that's the thunder that shakes the devil. The devil don't want them seven living voices. But we're going to have it because God promised it. This is a promise of God. I'm claiming it this night. I'm claiming it today. Praise be to Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Come on. It's not your life. It's his life to come into you. Give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; You know you're miserable. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But God know you're miserable too. But he still call you. Still put your name on the book. You know you struggle all by yourself. But God know you trouble too. But he still call you because he know you're going to be changed by not by might not by power but by my spirit. Oh glory of God. Praise God. Peter was always a smoking drinking fisherman. Jesus said come make you fishes of men andrew comeing the cursing what they doing on the book see the inside their soul see the germ in them the word in them the potential in them be seated &gt;&gt; notice Jesus didn't Tell Peter, Peter, just gather who you like. Tell them come too. &gt;&gt; It was not a second coming. You know, it was just come come line up these brothers and say greet in Jesus name. I don't like him. He was in school playing trouble. But Jesus called all of them. The one you don't like in school. The one you don't like in your job, he called them too. He called them. One you don't like next to you sitting next to you or behind you. God called them too. So behave yourself &gt;&gt; and do like I love them too because God love you. God love nobody complain about their eye. I don't like my right eye but keep your left eye from your left eye looking bigger than my right eye. You want you want to take it off. &gt;&gt; You want your right eye there. You want your left head there. You want your tongue. You want your face. You want your whole body as you are. &gt;&gt; That's the same thing with the kingdom of God. I don't know what But I can't say I don't need you. &gt;&gt; Well, if you're big enough, you can say you don't need me. &gt;&gt; You're on your own. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Are you in that battle? &gt;&gt; Oh, praise be to Jesus. Hallelujah. So, in Luke 24, he unlocked their understanding. He opened their understanding to the scriptures. Isn't that right? They knew he was God. So that's why they worshiped. Notice when he was taken up, they worship him. &gt;&gt; They knew that was God. Elohim and Christ. Isn't that right? Christ. Isn't that right? Praise be to Jesus. So before God sent out the baptism of the Holy Ghost in earnest, there got to be a sanctified bunch of people that worshiping the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know what I said? Not just worship, but a sanctified bunch. &gt;&gt; A clean up bunch. A bunch for God. Hallelujah. Worship him. Creating an atmosphere for the power of God to fall. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; God. So God bought three stages. Water, blood, and snow spirit. Praise God. Seven seat, &gt;&gt; blood, seven thunders that the message will have rejected. But now the seven of faith give us the faith to call for the spirit that there'll be a genuine birth baptism of love even charity itself that we can have tremendous victory in the love divine. God didn't promise just victory you know but tremendous victory. My God the people that know their God shall be strong and do great exploits. Some got to begin exploits of faith when the sick is being healed. is seeing. Death is hearing. Oh, glory to God. By the power of the living God. Oh, it's promise. I'm looking for it. I'm on expectation for it. I shall not die but live to declare the works of the Lord. The Lord have chosen me, but he have not given me over unto death. Oh, open to me the gates of righteousness. And I shall praise the Lord. Come on, you better praise him. That's what David said. If you open the gates, I'm going to praise him. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; So, you couldn't go in the upper room with an empty head, not knowing &gt;&gt; because after a while the upper room, you know, &gt;&gt; and it's true. &gt;&gt; You're not sure. &gt;&gt; All right. See you later. You walk out the room because you're not sure &gt;&gt; why you're there. But every one of those brothers up there, &gt;&gt; 120 of them, they knew exactly what they were about to receive. That's why when the first day come after three days pressure you should have a condition. Sorry you're in the upper room and in keeping and keep on worshiping with one hand and worship with the next hand. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Keep on giving God praises creating an atmosphere. They have to wait until God doesn't tell him what day. You just say wait until until until if you don't get to the service until you come back Thursday until next Sunday until convention coming until matter until faith have patience faith could wait have a long vision target is focus back down faith say until I wait till my change come do it from high. &gt;&gt; Power from on high. Not more back for 50 years. Power from on high. Power to praise. Power to praise. Power to forgive. It's the power of the Holy Ghost. That's what we here for. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Preach that like preaching the same thing. Yeah. These are the words. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Give the Lord a shout in the house. These are the words. You hear it before, you're going to hear it again. We're going to wait till the power come. We're going to stay here dynamics for going to step on the devil. We're going to step on his neck. We're going to lay hands on the sick. We going to cast out devils. We know who Satan is, but we know who God is. And we know who we are. We are to take the land. [cheering] You know what we're doing here right now? Declare a holy war. A holy war of occ. You have to dispossess the enemy. You running Philistines, Jebusites. You have to dispossess them. They're living on your land. You were born in sin, brother. Just in case you forgot. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Personal demons. &gt;&gt; Praise the religious spirits. I have reached the next class by itself. &gt;&gt; And this message loaded with it. Satan personally send them 200,000,000 devils &gt;&gt; loosed against the bride. &gt;&gt; Satan is the church. &gt;&gt; That's a big one. That's a That's a big one. &gt;&gt; The bride is the word. Satan is church. &gt;&gt; This church fighting we going down. &gt;&gt; When you know who you are, forget about it. church member can stop you. No 10,000 fold over your dead bodies. Nobody can throw you off. Nobody can set you back. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I am not disappointed. I'm appointed. Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; I feel we cross the line. &gt;&gt; You know, you come to a spot where the devil can't throw you back. He can't throw you off. He got send you back. He can't tell you you're not a son of God. give up on that. Then you got to try a different tactic all together because your mind is clear who you are. &gt;&gt; You might be a weak son but you're still a son. Might be a struggling son but you're still a son. You might be a blessing son but you're still a son. He can't change that. The devil can't change that. &gt;&gt; So you have access to your father. That's why the angel here we go. There we go. This is big. When the angel can open the voices outl &gt;&gt; you can't go if you don't know who you are &gt;&gt; and what you're going for &gt;&gt; you go to the angel watch I'm going back &gt;&gt; I don't know what I here for because that book &gt;&gt; is so important &gt;&gt; that's the book that Adam had &gt;&gt; that's the book that Adam lost that's the book what the to call all sons. &gt;&gt; God would only call by his word. &gt;&gt; So the word was in the book. &gt;&gt; The book was in Adam. &gt;&gt; When Adam lost the book, the book went back in the hands of the original owner &gt;&gt; and Jesus Christ came back down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As the book, the book was there &gt;&gt; open. Now the book is being placed in sons &gt;&gt; to call the rest of sons. &gt;&gt; Sons calling sons. So he said, "As my father sent me, so you the father that was sent him was in him." &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; Do you see what God about to do to you? &gt;&gt; He's about to tabernacle himself inside of you. You are about to become a house for God. You become about to become a temple for God. You become the church of God. you yourself be seated. &gt;&gt; Christianity versus idolatry, brother. Now, idolatry is a strange thing. Down through the ages, we've had it ever since the beginning of time. The order for this idol worship is the man sets up the idol. Fixes the idol. Then he goes in and prepares himself for this great worship. Now he believes this idol is made in the image of some god that he doesn't never see. He's without form. So he believes he's in an image of this idol that he makes to this god. Now don't let that leave you. So here is bringing a point. He said the image is in the image of the God that he believes that is then he goes before the idol prostrates himself and believes that the God that's unseen person comes down into this idol and he believes that he talks to God through this idol that God brings himself into the idol and answers him back. Many of you teachers here that took the mythology even though it's god they had battles with one another. Now in other words the god hypnotizes himself from this supernatural standing into this idol speaks back to the worshiper through the idol and the worshipper in some kind of built up emotional sense believes that the idol speaks to him to his heart and he's forgiven of his sins whatever more which surely shows is the devil is the devil that does it. Listen to this now they don't havely these worship of idols. Some of them does, but there's real true worshippers of those things. For instance, listen, I could tell you stories of how those devils in those idols perform all kind of things, &gt;&gt; make blood come out of things &gt;&gt; and everything else. They would say the stone weeping, Virgin Mary weeping and demons, devils that they worshiping, making these things happen. Watch, they are devils. Now, if you don't believe there's a real devil, then you don't believe there's a God. Sure, you got to believe. There's a real devil and he's a person, not a thought, &gt;&gt; not a thought. &gt;&gt; He is a person. Now, there's a teaching goes on that the devil is just an evil thought you get. No, it isn't. The devil is a person. &gt;&gt; The same people believe that the Holy Ghost is a good thought you get, but don't believe that the Holy Ghost is a person. &gt;&gt; It is the of Christ in spirit form. &gt;&gt; All them people who say they the Holy Ghost, they're off. &gt;&gt; That is just that is just contrary teachings. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is the person of Christ &gt;&gt; in spirit form. &gt;&gt; Now let's go ahead further now. Now these idols are frustrating for the idol believe that the God they are worshiping is represented in this idol. Now you now you got that the worshiper is not a hypocrite. He is actually getting a hold of something that is in that idol &gt;&gt; because it come back on him. He does something and gets it from that idol which is a myth god not a real one. &gt;&gt; So they will have testimonies of what an idol does to them and what the worshiping does to them and what the church does for them. They have answers, they have witness, they have confirmation, they have all of that. But And many times here we go. Are you ready? &gt;&gt; The devil get into those things and the devil get into meetings sometime and impersonates himself as God. I have seen this in my ministry. &gt;&gt; This is very deep. &gt;&gt; This is not skim milk. He says stay with the teaching that's been taught here. Stay with this word. Don't you leave it. You stay right with the word. No matter what comes, what goes. Stay with the word. People say come to the altar with blind teachers, blind teachers say just open up. Forget everything. Make your mind blank. You'll become an Elijah. You'll become this that the other. What a lie. That's open up your soul to all kind of devil spirits to get in. Don't do that. You must remember there's a devil and he impersonate Christ to the letter almost. So just because we can be emotional don't mean we are saved. &gt;&gt; Because we go to church don't mean we are saved. &gt;&gt; That's a big one. &gt;&gt; That's a big one. Going to church doesn't mean people say I see people in this message Christians soal Christians behite. until they fall in the pride and the arrogance while the selfrighteousness. Okay, let's go on now. Because we go to church don't mean we are saved. Don't believe those entitled spirits. A real spirit of God, a real word of God is the truth of God &gt;&gt; which is the seed of God &gt;&gt; will produce God in your life. You'll be godly, saintly, holy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's continue. &gt;&gt; Among a lot of people we find where emotions and so forth, they become tacklers, backbiting, all kind of ungodly things. Brother, that is sulfuric acid in the church. It is demon powers. &gt;&gt; Spirit of men and women who get among one another and try to push off and say, "This one is not right. This one is not right. That is not right." And if you chase it down, nine times out of 10, it's the very person making that That's not right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God hates discord among brethren. &gt;&gt; Be reverent, be holy, love God, stand by him, and as long as you know your life is deep enough with the Bible, with the purity of heart, purity of thought, love towards your brother, trying to best build the kingdom of God, doing those things, dressing right, living right, talking right, going to the right places, then you can have all the emotions you want and Nobody will believe it. &gt;&gt; Enticiting spirits going forth. Demons under disguises. Look, we the last days. It's the end time. False spirits &gt;&gt; come in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And begin to tell people this and the other. We are broke up into 900 different denominations. Everyone with different view. We say they say we believe this. Period. That's what we believe. They can't let the Holy Spirit They can't have the right of way. God got a bunch of people that can shout, then everybody had to shout. They got some to speak in tong, then everybody had to speak in tong. They got all like this till it become what? Absolutely. Listen, contaminated with enticing spirits. &gt;&gt; Enticenses people to do these emotions when there is no god in it at all. Then they go out and live any kind of life that desire to live and call it Christian. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So I say this because to correctly worship God, you have to get rid of the religious spirits &gt;&gt; and the enticing spirits. It's not worship God a bunch of noise and hallelujah. Glory raise your hands. You have to be able to follow through with the word &gt;&gt; to worship God in spirit and in truth. We give the Lord some praises people. &gt;&gt; So it's not just the noise. It's not just the shout. It's not just the hallelujah. It's breaking free from all the religious demons. Praise God. What you think and your dream and this and oh I have stories from now over 20 years. We just we speak from my Lord. We know that by heart. So Ephesus here like Joshua crossing over Ephraim here, Manassa here, God here, Benjamin here. Has the hour come for that? &gt;&gt; As I told him in Paris, seven thunders, we have seen the Lord. We fight together and what that is finished. &gt;&gt; There's no group testimony. &gt;&gt; We have to get our portion. Amen. &gt;&gt; So all the group &gt;&gt; they really in trouble &gt;&gt; because it working &gt;&gt; say give me my &gt;&gt; you can't ask for what is not yours. &gt;&gt; So you have to have a revelation of what is yours. &gt;&gt; So when it's revealed to you and you know what's yours you know who you're challenging now &gt;&gt; you know what you're asking for &gt;&gt; because it is now yours. Give me &gt;&gt; my mountain because it revealed to you. Give the Lord a shout. How each one of those Hebrew mother has given birth in those children. She spoke the very place in the labor pains where they are to be positioned in the promised land. So what she was in labor pain she said Ephraim when she was in labor. Joshua not knowing this but by inspiration led of the Holy Spirit after being promised land after being in the promised land give each man the promise exactly what the Holy Spirit brought to the birth back there &gt;&gt; how God set in the church the favorite quote through their labor pains how they get tremendous sometimes that's why you got to fight &gt;&gt; is labor pains you want to bring forth something don't don't expect a wall it's like a line thing and it just floating through you have to press your way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want that to stick inside of you. We are in the book of Joshua. &gt;&gt; We are in the book of Ephesians. We are in the promised land. But you have to fight to possess what you know is your own. &gt;&gt; You have to fight for it. &gt;&gt; It's not going to come easy. He didn't set it up for it to come easy. He set up a way that you have to fight for it. &gt;&gt; It is set up that way. &gt;&gt; It is yours. But every place you put your foot. &gt;&gt; Stop using binoculars. &gt;&gt; Stop seeing a fire off, you have to put your foot in it. I challenge you today. &gt;&gt; Walk on your land. &gt;&gt; I think I want a better amen than that. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Take healing. Take deliverance. Take breakthrough. Take a fresh anointing. Walk on your land. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Take victory. Glory to God. You get defeated yesterday. Don't bother with that defeat yesterday. Victory is tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Victory is right now. Glory to God. forgetting things that have passed. Don't look in the rearview mirror. See where you're going. Don't look back from where you come from. Come on, sing with somebody. Give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; See where you want to go. &gt;&gt; When the church, here we go, &gt;&gt; is my under the persecution. outside world believing in the Lord Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real as it was as Pentecost. So the only spirit that will try to make the Holy Ghost not as real is Satan. &gt;&gt; If you could avoid and duck the Holy Ghost, that is the devil. &gt;&gt; What you have to believe is that the Holy Ghost is just as real. &gt;&gt; Just as they have it, the same one Peter had, that's the one you want. &gt;&gt; The same one Mary got, that's the one you want. &gt;&gt; You don't want a new You want the same Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; But didn't come to turn back to a new thing. He came to turn us back to the faith of the fathers &gt;&gt; because they had the real thing. &gt;&gt; And we say local real McCoy. &gt;&gt; They had the real thing. &gt;&gt; So we have to go and pick up what they had there. Then we could go forward. &gt;&gt; We can't go forward as as long as we pick up what they had because they had the faith. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. So we have to go and pick up the faith to come and connect with dynamics that we could go down to the resurrection. You break down to the resurrection say that can stop you no more &gt;&gt; because you're breaking the time barrier. Not even death can stop you. Say not even death can stop this. You're pushing death aside. You're pushing that aside because you have resurrection power. You have rapturing faith inside of you. You have translation faith inside of you. Oh, glory to God. This will put on immortality. This corruption will put on incorruption. We shall be changed. &gt;&gt; Oh, do you believe that? You have to have power. You know, &gt;&gt; you must have power. It must have divine healing. But how could we have faith for the rapture and we don't have faith for the sick to be healed? &gt;&gt; That mean kidneys could be restored. &gt;&gt; May I shake your face a little bit? &gt;&gt; Say missing limbs will be restored. &gt;&gt; Missing limbs. &gt;&gt; Could you mind missing a foot and God resto the hand grow back up. &gt;&gt; Have you heard about a testimony with a woman with no eyes? &gt;&gt; And brother she asked you want her eyes just empty sockets and when spoke and prayed for her light come to and for the eyes and the middle of that formation he say I forget to ask you what color you want. She say, "I hear blue is a nice color." You said, "Well, blue, blue will change to blue." &gt;&gt; That's what we talking about. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The God that open the Red Sea, the God that could change, praise God, a whole a lady. &gt;&gt; That's the God we serve this morning. &gt;&gt; A drunk into a son of God. Give the Lord a shout. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Oh, the blood of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, the blood of Jesus. The blood of Jesus. Nothing but the blood of Jesus. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Oh, they grown and cry. When they are born, when they are born &gt;&gt; and positionally born &gt;&gt; into the kingdom of God, then the Holy Ghost are set in the church. Some apostles, some are prophets. He said when that's going to happen. &gt;&gt; He said when they are born then sure potentially. But he said when they are born and positionally born then God into the church, pastors and prophets and evangelists and so forth. Then he have speaking in tong, interpreting tong, wisdom, healing, miracles and so forth. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Here we go. Let's continue. The church is always trying to take somebody else's corner. But don't do that. &gt;&gt; You can never raise corn in corner if you are manners. &gt;&gt; Remember they were not one people. It was 12 tribes. &gt;&gt; So don't tell the tribe what to do. You don't hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Okay. Lord, I shout. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Told years ago, minister, I said, I will never allow any man on earth to tell me what to preach. &gt;&gt; Never. &gt;&gt; Then trying to put me in a box &gt;&gt; to believe the way they believe it. And I say, big fact, no. &gt;&gt; I would preach and believe what God revealed to me. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm trouble all by myself. I said this church down here is suffering in Trinidad. &gt;&gt; No man are coming to put the hand and stick the finger and tell us this and tell us that. I'm not tolerating that. &gt;&gt; This church had to become by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I was sick and tired. I had a struggle to come here. I don't ever talk much about that. My wife will know. But I made it &gt;&gt; to preach what I'm preaching this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I believe this is very important. Praise God that you understand the vision. It's not you come and join the church and you are here and this church is it. Any church say any group that believe they are better than other groups you know by discernment that is wrong &gt;&gt; inside of believers &gt;&gt; and so are the other groups &gt;&gt; but what I know is that there are members inside of here &gt;&gt; and I'm preaching to them. &gt;&gt; I don't know who is who but I going to preach the word and see who to take it. Come on. Oh, glory. Hallelujah. We preach the word and we have faith to take it. &gt;&gt; A bunch of people. 2 million of them. The word and mix it with faith. &gt;&gt; Two million of them with with the prophet Moses. We believe prophet Moses. And two million of them. &gt;&gt; They know it yet. &gt;&gt; They're coming out but they're not going. &gt;&gt; Don't join them &gt;&gt; because the devil anoint them with unbelief. &gt;&gt; That's why when they came to came when when they came to the border line there when God say 10 or 12 spies there 12 tribes or 12 ministers and a report 10 of them come back with a report a report they land good but we see giants. Somebody said the giants see you know but we see them. We never see men so big. &gt;&gt; They are real giants. Let me describe the height. Let me describe them to you. And by the time they finish Israel paralyzed with fear and just come back and have it so odd is the shortest man in the camp. said to stand on a box and Caleb come up now when he see once &gt;&gt; shorty &gt;&gt; on top his box we are more than able to take the land &gt;&gt; God make a paradox put a short in a box put a shame all them with a big size and big height and all the big revelation and big churches but praise God a little like stand up and tell them like it is we are wellable we We are wellable. We are wellable. You are well able. You are wellable. &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. You are well able to pray. You will press. You are able to receive the Holy Ghost. You are well able to be delivered. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So you can never raise corn in Ephraim's corner when you're manning. You've got to take your place in Christ. It get deep and rich. That's how God put one in the church to speak in tongues and another to do something else. And then when somebody speak in tong, we all want to do it and you want because you can't do it. You don't have the gift. That is why all them jealousy and all them foolish get blew out. &gt;&gt; One woman come to Jesus, you worship. Hallelujah. Glory. Hallelujah. She worship. Where's the request? She said have two sons walking with you. Could you put one in your left hand and one in your right hand? The other disciples of course get furious. They know the kind of mother. The mother boys or something. I don't know. The mother looking for a favor for Jesus to put one on the right and one left. She say not my position to handle who goes left the right. Have a cup a big cup. If they want to drink it, they could drink it. &gt;&gt; Everybody wants some recognition. They want some position. They want some kind of thing. &gt;&gt; But there's a price. &gt;&gt; There's a cross before the crown. &gt;&gt; There's a price. There's character which is a gift which is a victory. People don't know what you're going through. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. This church just dropped down here. This build up of blood, sweat, and tears &gt;&gt; and prayers and labor. &gt;&gt; It's not magic. &gt;&gt; It just happen just like that. &gt;&gt; It's a process. &gt;&gt; That's what we talking about. &gt;&gt; You got to have you have you got it. That's not a building has to be formed. &gt;&gt; And therefore, all this word is not image has to be formed in you, &gt;&gt; has to be built in you, has to be molded in you, has to be shaped in you. &gt;&gt; So said the land was divided up by inspiration. Praise God. I'm going to go on further as we head out this home stretch. Now, we are born of the spirit of God and receive the Holy Ghost and cry, "Aba, Father." We are children, but we can't get anywhere. We can't whip the Philistines. &gt;&gt; Why? Because people trying to take one of the position. &gt;&gt; Tell somebody do this, do this, do this, and do this. If don't want to stay, one of them go over here. We find over there say, "Oh my, the Lord give me a good corn field." And then somebody come, but the ground you have is for sheep. &gt;&gt; That land go So like corn waste your time waste then fight because his corn will prosper but his land is different. &gt;&gt; God put grass for you. Your pick up the grass like that and you just wearing sheep &gt;&gt; and say where God blessing is a position. &gt;&gt; So why you want to be in a position and then in &gt;&gt; the president he wanted the position. I wonder how he feeling tough fighting pushing. didn't know. &gt;&gt; Jesus said it nicely. He said when you're invited to dinner, take a lower seat. &gt;&gt; Because higher seat when somebody more worthy than you &gt;&gt; comes in, they have to tell you the other back. &gt;&gt; So you take the lower seat and then they could bring you up if you have to be positionally placed. Oh, this word have everything in it, you know. &gt;&gt; Isn't this sweet this morning? &gt;&gt; It's just the word. The word is God. All right. So, now wait a minute. I'm supposed to raise oats and I'm going to get corn, too. You ain't got nothing to do with corn. Get oats. It's your part to raise. You ain't supposed to hurt sheep when you're supposed to hurt cattle. God wants to place the church, but every one of them wants to do the same thing. &gt;&gt; So when you understand that, you begin to feel comfortable in the castle of your skin in the calling that God has called you onto. &gt;&gt; And nobody give you a fight with your blessings. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You don't care what they get blessed with. That is not yours. &gt;&gt; You're looking for God to give you a revelation. This one have more education than me. This one have hard me. Forget that. Find your calling. Find your position. &gt;&gt; And in your position, you have faith. In your position, God have blessed you tremendously. So then nothing about it. But but but but but you know The church, here we go, real home church. The church is supposed to be predestinated unto adoption of children where God can take a man, Here we go, and adopt him in the family and give him something. Okay? You understand that? &gt;&gt; Adopt a man, give him something. What are we supposed to do? Try first. Try that and see if it is right. &gt;&gt; So, it can't be ask question. I got to believe it. Believe what it is. In this time here, I want to know what you have. &gt;&gt; Don't hide it. &gt;&gt; Bring it. &gt;&gt; We get to test it and try it. &gt;&gt; Because here what B says the Bible said, try the spirits. &gt;&gt; Anybody coming to church, I could try the spirit. &gt;&gt; That's my right &gt;&gt; to try people's spirits to see what's inside of them. &gt;&gt; That's the authority we have in the word. The authorities try the spirit &gt;&gt; because many false spirit come out &gt;&gt; religious spirit. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So this is somebody who can be adopted. Now say don't take that just like that. Try it. See if it is right. &gt;&gt; Watch this man claims a certain thing. Try it. See if it is right. If it is right move right with it &gt;&gt; and then say Lord send us something else. Keep moving till every fellow takes his place. Then you're going to see the church of God begin to get in his place. Then is when the Philistines will go to back it up. The shorts will go off. Hair will go down. Facing will be washed. Sing will be missing. That's the church begin. And when the church begins to get in his mighty power and there a few of them you will see that holy church stand together in his power positionally placed as sons of God adopted into the family of God. Powerful church standing in his glory. That's what he's coming for. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you love him? &gt;&gt; Just a few more and we're now after you're in this land, it doesn't mean you're free from war. You still have to fight for every inch of ground. Canaan didn't represent the great heaven because it's wars and troubles and killers and fighters, but it did represent this. It must be a perfect walk. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm going to skip down. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Then he talk about hiding and men died. Innocent men died because of a behavior of a believer. Behavior, not teachings, not talking, not doctrine, a behavior. &gt;&gt; And then afterwards, he say something is wrong. They call a prayer and fast. Then they try by tribe, family by family &gt;&gt; and man by man. When they finished, they stole a and his entire family. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Watch. Let's go down. Who could doubt that? What Paul said, Paul scripture, Paul's writing, what he taught the church, the church positionally before the founding of the world. When God, Here we go. This is big. When God in his labor pain, this is God having labor pain. &gt;&gt; This is God. &gt;&gt; When in his labor pain was bringing forth you, &gt;&gt; knowing what you would do, he positionally placed you into his own body to To be a housewife, that's a position. &gt;&gt; To be a farmer, to be a preacher, to be a prophet, to be this, to be that. He placed you positionally that when we come from the godlands of Egypt through sanctification for the into the promised land for the promise is the Holy Ghost. God have predestinated the church. He said all the peoples will be there and all the peoples there will be millions time millions that will very religious and be deceived. &gt;&gt; Are you ready? &gt;&gt; The only ones that will not be deceived will be those that have come over into the promised land who before the foundation of the world had their names on the land book of life. Come over into the promised land and enjoying it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And enjoying it. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Leaving. Let's go on to perfection. Says, I wish I had the voice of that angel to bring this to a place where you could see it. So the voice of the angel is to come to bring you to that spot that you could see. Musicians, come up, please. Oh, praise be to Jesus. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, let's go over something again. So Jesus opened their understanding to the scriptures and when they got by revelation and inspiration, then they knew he was God. They had it clear in their hearts. &gt;&gt; They could correctly worship. sanctified by the truth. They were there worshiping continually until &gt;&gt; Oh, God is good. Let's all stand and begin to praise God. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Praise be to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Bless you today. &gt;&gt; That's our promise to be living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Oh, praise the Lord. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

Andrew Henry morning. for my grandmother has mobility issues and difficulty breathing partially due to a mild heart attack some weeks ago that God may heal her completely and deliver her from Sister Bernardet or Susan who has stage four cancer. And if you have a request this morning that has not been written but we could unite in faith with you as we approach the throne of grace. The word teaches us that if two shall agree touching anything we can have what we ask. So we stand in agreement with these requests as well as every request that we want to take together to the throne of grace. Unite in our faith and as the prophet taught us if we could get into one mind and in one accord that in five minutes there will be not a feeble person in the room. That's the power of when we are united in faith around one objective which is to see the prayers of the saints be raised up to God in the unity of one mind one accord and we are standing on the promised word of scripture. Shall we pray? Our heavenly father Lord we unite as a church of the living God understanding both the power and the authority Lord that we have been granted through your word Lord through the enforcer of the Holy Spirit who is here father when your servant your son your prophet left the earth the angel did not leave and your prophet screamed out the angel is on the earth now setting in order for the coming of the Lord so we thank you for the presence of the angel even the Lord Lord Jesus Christ himself who is present in our midst to confirm the word with signs, wonders, and miracles. We have stood behind this sacred desk so many times and seen prayer requests become notes of praise, Father. So Lord, we unite one more time as a body of believers, as a church, Lord, knowing that all that was in God was poured into Christ. And all that was in Christ has been poured into the church of the living God. And the power now stands and rests within the church of the living God over every sickness, over every disease, over every principality, over every power, over every attack seen and unseen. Father, so we stand Lord on the confession of our faith, Lord, knowing who we are and more importantly knowing whose we are, Father. Lord, we bring this request from Shalon Rivers before you, Father. Lord, for a touch in their home, a touch in their family, a touch for their son. You know the situation and we know that you are more than able, not just able, but more than able to resolve this situation. So father may you do what you do Lord and arrest the situation transform the situation turn the situation around change the situation Lord they are bringing it to you Lord not to take it back but you said cast all our cares upon you are well able to handle it this morning father we bring this request from Andrew Henry for his grandmother Lord with this mobility issues and the symptoms of the partial the mild heart attack father we pray dear God that the angel of the Lord will find her where she is right now. That the angel of the Lord will walk into that room. That the angel of the Lord will walk to where she is. That the angel of the Lord will touch her from the crown of her head to the souls of her feet. May the power of the resurrected Christ flow through her body. From the crown of her head to the souls of her feet. You've done it before and we know you are able to do it again. Lord, we bring Suzanne Hadoway before you with stage four cancer. Lord, we pray, dear God, that the angel of the Lord will move to her right now and she will come to know you by an experience of the supernatural wonder working power of God. Father God, for every hand that is raised here in the sanctuary, for those that we could see, for those we cannot see, for those who are at home, for those that are struggling, whatever the situation might be today, Lord, we unite in faith. For every brother, we unite in faith for every sister. We unite in faith for everyone fighting a hidden battle, everyone dealing with a situation. Father, we say house of hell, give way to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We speak freedom. We speak life. Uh we speak healing. We speak deliverance. Uh we speak breakthrough. We speak in the mighty name of Jesus Christ that the sins that the weight that the hold back whatever it might be would be resolved in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. Now, as we come to the end of this service, Lord, and as we prepare to leave this house, but not from your presence, may you touch your people one more time. May you be with your people one more time. May you grant traveling mercies and may you bring us back at the appointed time. We commit your people into your hands. We commit our pastor into your hands. We commit his wife into your hands. We commit all the ministers, elders, deacons, trustees, ushers, helps and governments, the church into your hands. Lord, we pray for your bride body around the world. Uh, Lord, because we are one body, Lord, as one faith, one Lord, one baptism. We are part of that mystical body, Father. So, we pray dear God, that you would bind us together, a unity of the spirit, Lord, to usher in a unity of the faith, Lord. May you touch your people one more time in the precious name of Jesus Christ. And the church says, Amen and amen. You may be seated for a few brief announcements. We like to welcome believe in Sister Marley Pictton. God bless you. Welcome to Headstone Tabernacle. We are so happy to have you here with us this morning. Trust that the service has been a blessing to you for our announcements. continues here at the tabernacle on Wednesday night at 8:00 p.m. We encourage you to make an effort to be here. We are under great expectation for what the Lord will do in our midst this coming Friday ahead of us. We will have Bible study this coming Friday. We look forward to that by the grace of God. And this coming Sunday at 10 a.m. we are back in the house of the Lord. We are getting ready in full strength to close this year with a shout maintenance team. Please meet brother Andy Henry after service next week, Lord willing. Group five, which is brother's group is to serve. Want to remind the church of our special upcoming meetings December 13th and 14th. Brother Andrew Glover and also our church dinner on December 20th. looking forward to seeing everyone at all of these critical events as we close out this year. And I want to encourage you as we prepare to leave to practice the presence of the Lord. Uh some time ago we said include the Lord in your affairs. The Bible tell us if you acknowledge him in all your ways he will direct your path. Sometimes we underestimate the power in the simplicity of these words because if Jesus isn't in the room with you, if he's in the conversations with you, if you are including him in your decision, then your life becomes very different. I want to leave you with this. Be very careful who you listen to. Many times we are under the influence of people who have ideas, suggestions, recommendations, and many times it doesn't line up with the word. It sounds good, but if it doesn't line up with the word of God, we'll get into problems. The rules and the laws and the guidance we live by are different from the rest of the world because we are not creatures of this world. We are just here to have a testimony while we are here and we come from God and we are going back to God. Other people can get away with stuff because they are not held to the accountability that we are under. But we walk our lives under teachers and governors because we are not predestinated on salvation. We are predestinated onto adoption. And because we are predestinated unto adoption which is different from salvation and God intends to place power into your hands than the formation of the character. I was sharing with a brother yesterday. I said the word teaches us God can turn the church against you. He could turn your wife against you. He could he could train a better sickness. That is his prerogative. He can do it. And it's for your good to see your character under pressure. Leadership is tested under crisis. The metal of who you are as a man or a woman is only proven under crisis. If things are well, we do not know what stuff you're made up of. And God himself wants to prove that you could stand the test. You could prove. He wants to prove that when nobody else is there, you're a Christian. You're a Christian not just on Sunday, but on Monday, on Tuesday, you're Christian when things are going well and you are delighted and top of the mountain. But more importantly, when you're in the valley and things are not going well under the pressure, you could stand like Job and say, "Though the skin worms destroy my body, yet in my flesh, I will see God." So, I encourage you, the God of the mountain is still God in the valley. I encourage you that the God who brought you this far is more than able to keep not just you, but your family. So, be encouraged. Go back to our channel, listen to the tapes, be in the atmosphere, feed your heart, feed your mind with the words of God. Because when you are in that channel, you become invincible. The promise in the word is a mighty marching army. Nothing will stop this end time bride. And if you are plugged into that, that nothing is on your job, in your neighborhood, on the road, you are living higher than the environment that you're in. So may the Lord rich bless you. May the Lord keep you. May he keep you positive in the channel of God and may you understand that you are not just a normal human being. You are a daughter and a son of the living God. God wish you bless you. Amen. Thank you so I shall not be moved. Amen. It is abiding. Amen. I shall not be moved. I shall not Oh, I shall not be moved. Oh, I shall not I shall not [singing and music] be moved. Just like a tree that's planted by the shall not be [singing] moved. Oh, if I trust him, oh, I shall not be moved. Oh, he will fail me.
