from 17 to 22 and Exodus chapter 8 5 to 7 12 to 18 reading from 2nd Timothy chapter 3 we didn't finish 1 to 9 this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection trucebreakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away for of this sort are they which creep into houses and lead captive silly woman laden with sins let away with divers lusts ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth now as Janice and Jambres withstood Moses sudhi's also resists the truth men of corrupt Minds reprobate consider in defeat but they shall proceed no further for the folly shall be manifest unto all men as theirs also was the Stettin of that same chapter but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived we go to Exodus chapter 7 and this is Moses Aaron Pharaoh was eight and the Lord speak unto Moses and unto Aaron sayin when Pharaoh shall speak unto you saying Shore miracle for you then thou shalt see unto Aaron take thy rod and cast it before Pharaoh and it shall become a serpent and Moses and Aaron went in under Pharaoh and the saw as the Lord had commanded an Aaron Kasden Ezra before Pharaoh and before his servants and it became a serpent then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the Sorcerer's nor the magician's of Egypt they also didn't like manner with the enchantments for they cast down every man his rod and they became serpents but even rod swallowed up the rods and he hadn't feels hot that he hath not unto them as the Lord had said so let's go down to verse 17 thus saith the Lord in this shall don't know that I am the Lord behold I will smite with a rod that is in my hand upon the waters which are in the river and they shall be turned to blood and the fish that is in the river shall die and the river shall stink and the Egyptians shall load the drink of the water of the river and the Lord speak on the moon is seen and the iron take thy rod and stretch of thine hand upon the waters of Egypt upon their streams upon their rivers upon their ponds upon their pools of water that they may become blood that there may be blood trawl or the land of Egypt boat and vessels of wood and in vessels of stone and Moses and the Aaron did so as the LORD commanded and he lifted up the rod and smooth the waters that were in the river in the sight of fear and the sight of his servants and all the waters that were in the river would turn into blood and the fish that was in the river died and the river stank and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river and there was blood for all the land of Egypt verse 22 and the magician's of Egypt did so with their enchantments and Pharaoh's heart was hardened neither did he happen to them as the Lord had said let's go to Exodus chapter 8 we want to read verse 5 to 7 and then Priscilla from 12 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying see unto Aaron stretch for down hand with I read over the streams over the rivers and over the puns and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt and Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt and the magician did so with the enchantments and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt let's go down to verse 12 now Pharaoh asks for a deliverance from the frogs and break you from the frogs and this is verse 12 and Moses and Aaron went on from Pharaoh and Moses cried unto the Lord because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh and the Lord did according to the word of Moses and the frogs died out of the houses out of the villages and out of the fields and they gathered them to get up on heaps on the lands tank when Pharaoh saw that there was a respect he hadn't his heart and had not unto them as the Lord had said the Lord said unto Moses all the time whatever Moses did these guys doing - right and the Lord said unto Moses say on the air and stretched out thy rod and smite the dust of the land then they become lice short all the land of Egypt and they did so for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and smote the dust of the earth and it became lice in man and beasts all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt and the magician's did so with the enchantment to bring forth lice but they could not so there were lies upon man and upon beasts then the magician said unto Pharaoh this is the finger of God and Pharaoh heart was hardened and he hearkened not unto them as the Lord had said may God bless his word let's play one more time father I pray that you would come down today and inspire a word and bring great deliverance to your people brick the hole of the enemy upon every life guarded here in Jesus and I ask at him and you may be seated oh praise the Lord give him a shout all glory to God amen hallelujah certainly appreciate the service on Wednesday night but Isaac appear in preparation for the comment of the Lord hallelujah what a inspired message if you haven't heard it go on our YouTube channel and listen to that message and he was saying something that's really striking that after they when the foolish virgins or when the visions are rules then they they got to trim the lamps and then they recognized the oil run out and they went to buy sincere but too late too late they went to buy and why they went to buy the Lord came the bridegroom came so it's really something in a shaken time preparation for the coming of the Lord hallelujah Slava title this morning prepare yourself for the battle I love an inspiration break in the hole of the devil that's my inspiration brick in the hole of the devil prepare yourself for the battle what battle the common of the Lord as the battle the common of the Lord that common of the Lord is 1st Thessalonians 4:16 so we read some scriptures what words could follow me behind it maybe get in the screen of an on but I believe that this last deep battle will be fought not on doctrine but in the realm of the supernatural and and based on the first script I read where Paul said as Janice and Jambres withstood Moses so these also resist the truth men of corrupt men Minds reprobate here what forbid about concerning defeat defeat and this is the same defeat that goes on a prophet to restores back to hallelujah do you get that God send a prophet to turn us back to defeat you know and last days honest and generous spirits they have corrupt minds concerning defeat or glory that God this faith has been delivered all glory to God hallelujah do you believe that praise the name of the Lord so I believe this battle so forget doctrine Resta forget doctrine is not a doctrine McLennan is the battle in the supernatural that means it listen you have to be totally convinced that there will be a supernatural manifestation of the power of God I could guarantee you that I don't care how you see you what you think what you imagine this is real just as Chinese and Jambres withstood Moses or glory to God Amen there were witches wizards or sorcerers hallelujah and I was checking what is witchcraft checking out what is this thing called witchcraft what what the butter encyclopedia what happened witchcraft witchcraft is to control people and events so when somebody trying to control people on events they operating under the witchcraft anointing see when I write under control her husband when passes telecon control congregations which graph so now I began to understand what I resisted I'll be checking

you're smoking the devil wanted a smoke you know he wanted a ticket to cook he wanted neat brains of goat nuts watch what the Prophet said now he wanna take if I'm smoking normal cigarette to marijuana and he want to graduate yet the promoter okay I want to lose your mind that your dope receive Christ he said if the devil realized you catch on to what he doing kind of do you he would keep you on a cigarette alone if he realized if it catch what's taken you you will stop altogether he go walking okay nobody mind I just hear Broadway this is not stupid people feel the devil should be reveal something else come be wonder going a little bit my girl Sunday School kind of teacher because I mean he was up dear head honcho he was governing up there he knows what Kingdom life is like in so much he wanted to set up a better Kingdom and he began to whisper the devilish the whisper he don't talk any open Shh do tell nobody between you and I you saw my color you know if I if I cannot shown the I'll go a better job do tell anybody he's lusting for Shan Shan let me just come to you now make it there all right demons are just as real as angels we like to talk a lot about angels but demons are just as real the countenance of the devil now makes people believe the Christian when they're not there's a thing continue no the god of this world today here we go the worshipped person of this world today is Seton and this blew my mind when I study in it one said this is the only age where he is called the god of the evil age the core of this thing that is why he's enjoying this environment to be in this last day because this the first time he has been acknowledged to be God because of the evil age what he wants his worship and that is what we not given him that is what make God God God is the object of worship whatever you worship is your God that is what Lucifer was lusting after that's why he put styles and fashions he put all kind of electronics all kind of stuff for people to worship the people are ignorant of worshipping Satan but it is sittin here we go impersonating himself as the church they worship Satan thinkin they're worshiping God through the church but you can only worship God by the word so that is why people love to be hiding in church but when you bring the word they don't want to take that but the word is God not Church is God the word is God you say wait a minute we preach the word look back at my text tonight Satan was the one that preached the word to Eve he said God had said it's a misconstrue in that part of the scripture that applies to the day he will let you know Jesus did perfectly well let you know most days perfectly well but when you take the promises that you gave for this day that was applied to another age that's all he has to do he said then people worship in season and this day thinking they are worshipping God but they are wishing him through a Creed I believe this I believe that and therefore we have fellowship that's not bright you know that is Lucifer oh my and he said no right down to the gritty deception the world I've ever known no matter how much the Word of God promised for this day is preached and vindicated they still won't believe it no Satan establishing his kingdom in the that's exactly why he's doing it he wants to establish his own kingdom I want you to get that that's his piece I want my kingdom I want my own that way less selfish incremental self fishing and I want to get someone pride years of what preach about you know but pride or private so evil because that is what comes coming Lucifer hot you know I will ascend be like the Most High they pride have a little bit humbling yourself on and like that God said in Scripture I am high and lofty one that dwell with him of a humble heart and a contrite spirit at him that trembles at my would let's continue as a business man that's not a Christian he will work every listen sittin he will work every scheme he can to make you see something the wrong way if he's got a put a person a person honking and making you doing that we can you see that way he will show you everything he can and keep you off from the truth of it because he is got a feeling only for himself so now I see the news people has just dumb them because he never was interested in them he was just interested and using them oh my hallelujah so no matter how much its lies and teeth on whatever more he's got personal gain and there's a religious deceit since the beginning of Eden that has ever been since now by this fall he has took over and possessed the Garden of Eden himself he took it over and now he has had six thousand against the deceitful rule deceiving the people and God's children because they were based on free moral agency to act any way they wish true and believing that they would act right a trust and they would act right and then it when they come with the wrong at and so they would try like Esau did and he had 6,000 years develop this even as God at six thousand years to bring his Eden to close by this seat the seat of the word all the people know establishes own Eden in the hood God's Eden was established in righteousness Satan's Eden is established and sin because Satan is sin and God is righteousness and course kingdom is established in righteousness and peace and and sittin is establishment is in sin and unreligious sin oh my Isaiah 14 said how I don't fallen from heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how I don't cut down to the ground with no weakness the nation for thou hast said in thine heart I will ascend unto heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also the mountain congregation in the sides of the north I will ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the Most High yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the size of the petition they that City shall narrowly look upon thee and consider the saying is this the man that made the hitter tremble that did she Kingdom Oh hallelujah praise God so we are talking about a fallen being isn't that right Oh glory to God hallelujah he always wanted to establish his kingdom and he has a kingdom he actually have a kingdom with principalities and powers and structures he has a kingdom even when he was Jesus was tested in the wilderness Jesus the devil told you all these kingdoms are mine I could give it to whom serve i well let me read a scripture for Matthew 12 was 22 my 2022 you could if you want to take a look at the tree you want to find it you can find it that's fine Matthew 12 was 22 and then was brought unto Him one possessed with the devil blind and dumb He healed him insomuch that the blind and a dumb boat speaking soul and all the people were amazed and said it's not this the Son of David when the Pharisees heard it they said this fellow got not cast out devils but by belzebub the Prince of devils so they were accusing Jesus I'll have an authorization from belzebub and jesus knew their thoughts and said unto them listen every Kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand and if Satan cast out Satan he is I use against himself how shall his kingdom stand so King Satan have a kingdom and them demons not divided there as acts for help in the services demons on one side diabetes demon gamecaster here and he asked if I help from diabetes demon and somebody else they get strength me I want the move when that demon get kicked out of the house it want get seventy much worse than himself because those demons look in the

temple of his righteousness if Satan cast out Satan he is divided against himself how shall then his kingdom stand and if I bear see Bob cast out Devils by whom do your children custom out here for this shall be your judges and here Jesus Jesus but if I cast out Devils by the Spirit of God then the kingdom of God is coming to you you have no excuse or glory to God it is God using me to do this this is the kingdom this is a visible manifestation of Kingdom operation this is a little more than thought noddle this is a little more than doctrine no dough this is the crumb speakin the brand seein this is everything that we in a supernatural war he's his uncle quote scripture but leave out one spot of it he said no he said he will exalt himself above the most high he would ascend above the clouds and the stars he would sit there like God and be above the most high and he would be he has succeeded and kind of distress he has certainly had a marvelous success in karate struts by the

he may be seated John wept and John crying I know one phone we take the book you look in the book he says you know John you look in the box and go back to it you know he's saving but he know this thing had to unfold this book is so important because man redemption poppy ela was the kick the devil of it because it never get off the authority this book is the full authority so once that book is released that they will have no choice he know his time is up yes this was only for 6,000 years but I'm on no book on the earth no he don't believe we have the book he can't believe that he never even know G about this one of God is if Toby if Dobby so don't believe we have the book so god Fulham onion put asunder silence under the 7c so you don't know what going inside here yeah I can't hear anything you can't see anything only see his flesh and blood coming stillness seen in and hallelujah glory hallelujah never don't believe nothing but it's a secret going on the secret is the word is in the bride because every service you're getting promises after promise after promise or glory those gonna be chopping promises inside of you even though you might be ready fair you still dropping this on you because you're welcome to it do you believe that look when God had unified Samuel and good fire Sami I wish they'd given me pink slip he said it's all rather soul he said Samuel why Memphis sauce Samuel like soul he said forget that man I have a king and he hopes that Jesse I found a better man I hate that man well scuffle and when he building go up you dick Tomey scuffling I formed a better man anything does he man no I find a better man then he said go and anoint one in Santa Jesse and you may know the story difficult anointed but David everybody David couldn't say AHA again oh I did oh it's all pretty shown Saul was going to kill him in no difficulty very cheap normal normal normal but he's anointed he's at notable purpose he's anointed for destiny he's anointed and the devil cast cancel the anointing because once corporate oil annual democratic hallelujah are you with me give the Lord a shout glory know God was caught anoint you not demon or devil to take that off of you [Music] the anointing is an idol the anointing comes with purpose behind it I never bill in the temple they have people anointed and brass and Ireland and Francie was because God wanted a Templar sitting away all glory to God God David had a heart for the hopes of God and God said no David your hands to bloody your son will do this job for me because Solomon was a different kind I got a guy hallelujah you needed a man who wanted peace David was a warrior David was a fika if it was an uncompromising Oh glory to God when you say sure that's David when they said right that is David when they said conquered that is David Oh glory to God that man can't be nothing in that atmosphere he wouldn't get wood from here you go chop this one down you could shut that one down you go push that one across but not Sonoma so God knew who to choose and put when so if God wanted you not to be here wasn't gonna be here that means God saw you and shows you an elective you for such a time as this [Music] I don't know how much sceptile got to read but we read it some time ago when Daniel was prayin and gamer was coming he was eating for three weeks and Gabe I explained to Daniel from the tiniest actor pray I was coming but I was intercepted by some demonic activity but Michael came and helped me or Chloe does God give all alone couldn't make it [Applause] that's why you come

astonished study though shall be a terror and never beam anymore okay the law some praises Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God amen second chorus is up to four I want to read from verse 1 2nd Corinthians chapter 4 verse 1 and Paul was saying therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy we faint not but I've renounced the hidden things of dishonesty but walking in craftiness not hardly would have got deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God here we go but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost and this is a path in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not least the glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine under them the god of this world a blindness upon people what was loud ISA blind wretched miserable naked and don't even know it so that is what God brought you out God brought you out to that to bring you into light you can't go back into darkness you can't go back into law you can't go back into the nomination you can't go back to looking for a man looking for some church you have to look

land what did God do he asked them for 12 spies to do what to go into the land to bring back evidence so they have to have evidence of the supernatural and have to have evidence of where we go into

working on the disobedient the church refuses to let the would rule over them I want to take that statement the church refuses to let the word rule over them I'll share something my wife 40 years after why I gotta see how spirits operate and I was telling my wife about religious spirits and want any things observed over the years with religious spirit religious spirit don't care about the family songs audio listen carefully a religious spirit don't care about the family I have seen mothers ruin their daughters I have seen fathers ruin their sons because they're going by the conviction of their belief and they lack a body children did look a whole defects each error and that's why I said and I said may in time pass sometimes somebody conviction is more powerful than the word time

wife and not to be a decoration so I trained her course much churches he passed the wife is a cop he's a hyung and furniture like my god like a picture frame so I have my wife to check any female person around but the party difference and then bolas he they want direct access from andaman top but they working so here it may work so elsewhere but not here Oh hallelujah so pray for me so Satan the code of his evil is he say what did he do it's exalted Satan okay let me back up a little bit he said no the chilled disobedience given a strong delusion to believe a lie and be damned by it when the church would have not the word oak and when the church would not have the Word of God rule over them they accepted Barabbas a murderer there is Jesus Pilate trying to get hands off he said okay we have a law we have a real murderer inside of here or who do you want because with me say but it was Jesus who do you want Barabbas or Jesus they said Barabbas his mind blown that's not his expectation he said what shall I do it is about gorgeous crucify him his night is a blur he's a pastor water I have no do this then change folks under Church would wanna be not I wash my hands of this thing but he still come and put the king or glory that God is saying he says that King oh my hallelujah and when Jesus died disease finished sit-ins hung his head and so I got relief at last like as I release that time she are still working you know when he died you belong to hell oh my hallelujah you thought yourself dead I was in the box honor no he went on next ministry Oh glory to God because not some people in paradise and I've Noah and all them Bridget and Paradise and Jesus went on and open the gates up and get over here come on come on come on up empty Oh oh maybe seated I don't know how much I get you today Saul was no longer here from God could they're talking to him he had banned all witches and so on he found himself one is a get a word and he's going to go on this guy's in self and consult a witch in a cave hidin under which she cover and the rich conjure up soul Samuel Samuel the Prophet with his prophet mantle and the Samuel the Prophet would beat soul and said today you will build me then they would see but is usual you deceive me yes God not talking to me now what he was so backs didn't and the prophet reveal that because these witches Richards these wizards and witches they have a connection to the supernatural so they are the channels to get Church from these fallen angels spirits so at that time those witches had access to paradise but when Jesus take an empty old paradise they no longer have access to that realm so anybody saying they talked to somebody on top that was in hell that person not in paradise there was nothing ever denied furthermore together like spirits no or glory to God hallelujah or glory to God hallelujah and even under talk about our thing was Reader's Digest run an article on brother Branham on his accretion in prophecy and there was a witch who prophecy was also very accurate and had big advocates and both of them and so later he said you'll notice if you strip back the dollar back to the original you see Wed come from she had frolic she had jokes and everything else nothing about Christ nothing about God but she had access to that realm he said that other people try and crystal ball and their impersonators and impostors he said but she was a genuine medium and a prophet have genuine access to the supernatural realm to get the visions from God even as these witches have access to get demonic influences to put upon the earth or glory the closer is not that they're powerless and they have nothing and they have nothing no there's power but we are a greater power [Applause] those Devils are power to inflict with sicknesses but we are power the custom oh but you have to believe that you have to accept that you have to walk into that because this thing coming to a showdown and your faith will be tested within that shuttle to prove what you believe whether you believe it or not Jesus taught a very small miracle turning water into wine potentially water could become Wayne but the grapes Jesus just jump over and bypassed evil process so instead of squeezing grapes a ladle full minute long time I'm going at Wayne one time so his ministry build-up with miracles and powers and until it comes and Lazarus he's dead Joris I plus I go with him he's sleepin so in Jesus realm of the spirit Lazarus is not dead I want you to see that and Jesus understanding what the human level called dead is not dead he say I'm glad for your sakes I'm not there then he tell them Lazarus is dead even though weekend no he cannot be came on his own something after activate what's in him there when the sisters the Lord if you had been here my brother had not died but even though when she said that destroy him and I can where have you laid him something's moving now things things moving on sale is activate and power in the son of God he's away have you laid him he's a lorry daddy's thinketh he said wall away the stone he that believeth on me though he were dead yet this is the first time no man dead man stinking and Jesus could sit roll away the stone don't lock up if they're looking for manifestation make with faith it might be stink behind there but you're looking for deliverance you're looking for a breakthrough don't cover it up you're coming up the smell but already were that who smell it they smell it that's alright but you will be delivered you will come for you're gonna get free you will get that demon power broke no failure or glory the how you think of chairing will get delivered the demon powers upon them will be broken glory to God do you believe that the devilish powers upon them will be broken cover usually to break it cover using to speak it what the usual it's already authorized but this is good this is good that come fresh it's already authorized you don't need authorization it's already authorized toss them out [Applause] [Music] what you're looking for is a Superman sittin in the form of a Superman a person of knowledge a super knowledge he knows more than all the rest of them oh my cheering or disobedience disobedience means rebellion I'm readin this whoa bill means what what I'm doing interests up in heaven they rebelled they were once angels bubble called Lucifer morning light as much alight and why the come demons is because they fell from the first estate what do you see over there was not always demons when the fell they became demons fallen angels fell for come demons and then the back of angels became human battles I hope this is a defining helpful for you this morning there are only two powers there are only two kingdoms not true just two and you are influenced by one of them all battles is consist of these two powers church walls as these two powers at work this one can like this one you can take this one the two powers at work it's the power of God or the power of the devil hallelujah is the power of the kingdom of God and power of the kingdom of Satan is only two kingdoms and if you know you are connected to the kingdom of God then you supposed to know anything coming against you is because of the kingdom of the devil I don't care who they use Jerrica use your wife your husband your children your family definitely use elder Deacon pastor minister Deborah fuse everybody [Applause] ministers sure I read for you Sadducees and deceivers shall wax worse hallelujah and as chalice and trembles by said Moses not able to

lane on the street and the son of God says silver and gold have I none such as I have I given up rise up and walk in the name of Jesus Christ he said let's wonder press come down watch the triple then oh boy a power coming to the church there's a prophecy hanging over this church there's a prophecy hanging over your life a power to come is how they use the pillar of fire or poet author Anthony

ain't got no demons you say I got the Holy Ghost Ballarat I ain't got no demons well now I don't sit demon possession it is demon oppression you see Satan in the flesh not sittin in the spirit season and the Spirit gives unclean habits and so forth and unbelief you might live just as pure and holy and clean and yet be a sinner it's your feet that saves you many people they're just as pure and clean yet a lot cleaner sometimes and people professed christians christians live yet they were denied the Holy Ghost we deny every operation of the power of God the unbelievers no matter what they're very religious shall we come back to this religious thing a family because the person so caught up in their religious world of what they'd seen and they believe they don't care about the children they don't care about a household they only care about the conviction so the cheiron's suffer house will suffer because they come like a sister whoever unbelieving husband unbelieving husband and there were question I was asked about the kinda behavior they would hold myself on my husband because he's an unbeliever he said no don't do that sister you know was treated with respect to them at love treat him right tell him they were right behavior nor religious spirit a body with that Sarah here same here over the church I a listen to him Christ is my head yeah now that is the religious spirit

angel he's a dangerous man a drunkard he was even started by drunken I'd almost a political sipping I don't know somebody that that kind the little running of the decided amount this man is but liquor he say prefer to be with that man tampered we a liar you can lie on going a contrary to uni Tia like I could have a lie machine I'm not like a machine have a lie machine Oh hallelujah so this religious spirit because you see if you're building a body family like I always wonder about people who you know they might miss it with a load as parents but they want you see that sometimes but they wanted sure and they go to church the interested in is to answer the Lord did not religious they have their own problems they have their own challenging issues but they want the child to do better they want a better life they want a better environment they want the court to do something for them and they have that burden my religious spirit years ago when God was dealing with me and I was young it's all about them selfish so I will okay scrappy red men shall be lovers of their own self Genki about husband you know they kept for themselves they are about wife and only cares about themselves and then they operate under which graph control no beginning to understand this control ending controlling the highs and controlling people know when they started used period to do that there's a business finally profit talk about spirits people in church up there's a little speak in tongues and because you know like somebody to push and come against you I know Holy Ghost you know these people

hallelujah son of God put in licks on them cast endeavours out Silvan em notice and running them out they ask if I have to get back up or glory or not in the spirit realm I knew this is a normal normal normal these soca singers and the rock singers they know what they worship Him they know where they getting this source of inspiration of English songs so when you listen to the song and stick that thing in your ear that you know anything of this song coming to you because she attend was the musician up in heaven he was in charge of his timbrels and all the music stuff out there he know music and he use in music or kill the Lord a praise offering that's why when I hear good music here brother brag when they dance and shout because we know music to heavenly music Holy Ghost music Oh glory to God hallelujah come heaven and the time really from Hell or tell the Lord a shout and caught us use the movie from heaven I went the right new set the right singing the right worship is like this morning or glory that go to see anointing came upon Didion glory report began to speak Lord I want something man hallelujah praise God I never saw that before Oh glory to God and you just jump on him worse at the pelt of the small hallelujah Water Act was fair all points the Holy Spirit but the music with the singing with the special and everything and when you begin to praise and worship you create an atmosphere of the Holy Spirit and the devil after take his leave the devil after get out to develop ahead to the exits [Applause] I will try to wrap up here oh my lord what a battle I had to bring this message I wasn't feeling well yesterday last I was rough but God is good what is good hallelujah so he said ok I'll not on the platform many times I see the spirit that leaves the person there in all kinds of shapes I'm fixing up a book on the demonology of what I know about it myself and my Krishna dealing with demons they are beings they are not just some thought like Christians I it's actually a being and you see it when it leaves the person like a black shadow I have seen them some look like bats about that long got long ears hanging on I have seen them like that I have seen them look like total Isis great big spiders that with 50 pounds great big shadow and usually that's epilepsy total spirit totally shadow and said that is epilepsy it goes right over the audience and Almighty God who we are preaching about surely to be in the deepest of sincerity I have seen those things move over the audience I have seen them and sometimes when the congregation will be in one Accord they see them themselves many times hundreds of people would see it move dear for it must be the very deepest of sincerity it isn't a bluff you can't Bluff the devil at all he won't Bluff but whenever you really can produce the blood of Jesus Christ Satan can stand before that there is one thing I've always thought about that God by the power of his death at Calvary has given the church power to cast out evil spirits because marks existed in my name they shall not I will but they will cast out Devils so Calvary give us access and rights to cast out Devils Oh hallelujah praise God glory to God mark 69 says now when Jesus was recently the first of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast Seven Devils that's how the Bible described it I'm really good when Jesus was risen from the first of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene out of whom he cast Seven Devils I'm gonna ban him said Mary Magdalene she knew his power she knew there was something about him that was different from anyone else she had seven Devils cast all over everybody has ever been free from the devil by the power of Jesus Christ knows where they are standing no one can ever come in his great divine presence and ever be the same person anymore you were changed there was something happened to you you can't stand off on psychology and imagine this and accept this you know we believe in a power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and when you come into his presence there is something that happens in your life that changes you and you are never the same no more a man that I've ever been in the presence of Christ so she at Seven Devils cast out of her and he called to pride and envy and she thought she was so pretty and there was no one like her do you think so about you any oh but when Jesus spoke is a bit o king and all that left huh you mean private a devil oh yes if you never knew that you know it now oh you mean that half the vote oh oh yes and we let the devil - oh yes you mean that have to leave - yes if you leave Mary Magdalene you can leave you another sister develop just want to make sure clarify that this pride is not assisters on leading it alright so the description I got for this witchcraft is the exercise or invocation of alleged supernatural powers to control people and events that is what that is about wantin control that's the object the whole thing is control now Galatians 5:16 to 26 maybe you get on board we can Galatians 5:16 26 this then this I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would but if you be led of this third you are not under the law know any part I want to get to the works of the flesh ADIZ most of us are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresies envyings murders drunkenness revellings and such like of the which I tell you that I have also told you in times past that they which do such things shall inherit the kingdom of God but the fruit of the Spirit is here we go love joy peace listen together long-suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance again such there is no law ante that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affection and lust if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let us not be desirous of vain glory provoking one another envying one another Oh glory to God hallelu I'm gonna finish we should come up please I want to read for the summer chapter 15 we want to read from verse 19 to 20 for a full Samuel Chapter 15 think I'll wrap up here I'm not ready finished with the messenger mercy are we doing good we don't so first I built up the 15 verse 19 it says here wherefore then this donut will be the voice of the Lord but this fly upon the spoil and this evilness sight of the Lord is discord speaking to some as a soul Samuel de Saul I'm so said of the Sanyo da I will be the voice of the Lord and have gone away with the Lord

that the clock of time is counting down as we blend from time into eternity Lord will look for that day when there'll be no more sickness there'll be no more Lord pains Lord and father getting all will no longer be something that we need to talk about but we could talk about the glories of the journey Lord that only through your grace you brought us through because it was not our strength but Lord your love for us was so great and you could look true Lord and see everything unfold and you could write names in the book of those who would overcome you and write names in the book of those who were fall down but they would get back up again and Lord it was your blood that made that possible it was your grace that made it possible laughs Lord we can forget ourselves lost but you will find us because we could never find ourselves father we thank you Lord for the message this morning Lord through a son and Lord your servant and our pastor but over this morning lord I know how we labored how he wasn't well lor the last few days when Lord he's at his post of duty this morning lowered her burden for a few weeks now he's talking about going on the offensive the Lord and seasonless man but we are glad this morning because we are coming into a full realization of who we are it's morning in the economy of God so father may you visit him right now may you touch him in his body me you give him a fresh charge of the Holy Spirit may you be with your people Lord those that are here Thank You Ari those are downstairs and those that are even connected on the Internet know me you bless those that

do what we need to do we surrender to your Holy Spirit today Lord may you grant traveling mercies as we leave this place but not your presence lower commit every one and every Lord every situation into your hand in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen and amen you may be seated for a few announcements Richard beam and Jordan being invited by sister Judith god bless you welcome to Morocco we are so happy to have you blessed and Brandon Soraya's in my tradition Williams where's Brandon god bless you welcome to Hanson Avenue Amen so service continues on Wednesday night at 7:30 p.m. also on Friday night at 7:30 p.m. also so make every effort to be in the house of God for those of you who may not make it on our Wednesday night be sure to connect to the service the live stream of the service him and maintenance team group for please me to Guatemala and Alexander after the service there'll also be a very short meeting with the officers and their wives Deacon elders ashes trustees and wives after the service right after service you want it to be as quick as possible so be at your post and we also want you know the Bible said be wise as serpents and gentle of the as doves so we want to also be very conscious of the changing landscape of the world as we know it I believe was yesterday Saturday New York City declared a state of emergency I think this morning or Lydia's later this morning Italy locked down 16 million people in quarantine so people who thought they would have had maybe a service this morning can go out a service but you can't leave your house because you are in a quarantine 16 million people in a quarantine and as these things unfold before us it doesn't come as a surprise to us it is it is what the scripture speaks about and different situations coming and plagues and woes and and that's not our sign because when all these things happen we look up for Redemption draweth nigh so we are not moved by it but at the same time we need to be conscious of it because we don't know what will unfold on this island we don't know what the next months will hold and we always said one day we'll have a last service known and it's somebody who may have had a plan in Italy for example to go to church this morning and just hear well you can't leave your house you know and that's that's a world we live in we don't know what tomorrow holds but we know who holds tomorrow and our faith and our confidence rests on the Lord you see people panicking and different things and you know my wife said she went to price Mart and and Lysol is sold out and this is so loud Vickers and gloves are so loud and somebody told me they need to buy Mac's for their job and they can't get it because people are stocking up on these things and and that's what the Bible speak men's hard feeling fulfilled you know and that is the reality of the world we live in so we want to be conscious of these things and take the opportunity not to go into panic mode and not to go to these things but to get drawn closer to Christ because in him is our safety but a random tow bar being hid in Christ and if you're hidden Christ in the work at him and find you because he'll just see Jesus oh that's my prayer my desire and all of that being said we cannot be negligent so you can't say well because of a Christian I'm not going to wash my hands because the health advisory recommends that the best treatment against these things is to do what is proper to wash your hands for at least 20 seconds count it say at least 20 seconds count it that is not 20 seconds so we want to also practice what is is the recommendations for best health practice so make sure in your daily lives because God is interested in every aspect of our lives and we don't want to be so caught up in a mountain that we walk up the mountain on a spiritual high and then and we do we do things that are not prudent so we want to be very conscious of environment that we're living in and while there's no confirmation of the virus here in Trinity be a go and we would pray certainly that it does not come we certainly want to be proactive in our approach in our thinking as a body of believers because it is not inconceivable if it comes that it would could order a quarantine ami Ayalon or they can see you know and they've already spoken that places where people assemble such as churches schools universities etc etc to put what is necessary in place and as good stewards we also have to take responsibility for that so we've already spoken about installing more hand sanitizers or different things like the tabernacle so we do what is what is what is required as well so I want to officially from from Robbie's position and the office of the pastor to also advise you to be conscious of washing your hands and avoiding touching your face on your nose and this also from a health perspective is not just about the corona virus but any virus for that matter it's just you know what some may consider basic hygiene but beyond that it's also being conscious that as these things are happening but amount of blood men grunting in their flesh and all these things we don't know what the next thing is and the next thing is that the next thing is so above all we need to get the Holy Ghost but we also want to be very conscious of doing what is what is necessary for your health so be conscious of this and you know many other churches and groups have already already advised if you are you know coughing and you obviously have some pockets of the flu or whatever whatever the same way a school would advise keep your child at home so as not to infect everybody else you know so Jesus the Centurion came to see if you could just speak the word my signal will be healed so you know you said I'm a prayer cast but you don't need to come and be coughing on on other believers who are coming into the shared space so we wanna be one exercise some wisdom in Africa as well so but of it has also requested that we be very conscious of personal contact at this time so until further notice the official position is we are asking that be that you know direct shaking of hands until we advise otherwise to bring our level of consciousness it's a precautionary measure and for many of us it's something that we do as a normal thing and it's just a practice that we want to implement in the church effective immediately so we want us to be conscious of that so yes so duty held in the international community and what is happening we want to be ahead of the curve with that as well so in that we also moving forward in feet with respect to our upcoming convention trusting God that David is his will it'll take place in the way that he wants it to as well so we want to encourage you to make all your pledges and support towards the convention and above all else friends stay in prayer stay consecrated ste sanctified because what is to come was stool to not come near those who have the mark the seal of God so you want to make sure that you know there are people who will be doing the natural things you know the washing hands and all these things but their heart is not right and if it's not this is something else is something else is something else will come but once a seal of God is upon your life you could walk out without here like poor when that servant when when that dot that sneak bit him and they were expecting him to die he shook it off because what was running through his veins was resistant to the poison that was in the snake what was it it was the Holy Ghost it was not a chemical it was not a vitamin it was the Holy Ghost itself that was coursing through his body and they have to take note that these men had been with Jesus they tried to boil him in oil and they were oil proof they tried to do what kind of thing to them what was it it was the Holy Ghost you can't destroy the Holy Ghost it it's a powerful Holy Ghost it's it's God himself in spirit form who wants to dwell in us and the church say Amen so stay on the firing line and we're looking for God to do great things in our myths amen and amen so that's that's the announcement so may the Lord's you best you ashes deacons [Music] to the cross where now [Music] from me yeah [Music] to thy precious needin son show me [Music] so me [Music] to that [Music] [Music] you [Music]
