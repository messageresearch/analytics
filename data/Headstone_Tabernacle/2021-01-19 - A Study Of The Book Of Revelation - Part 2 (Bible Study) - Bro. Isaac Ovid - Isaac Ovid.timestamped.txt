[19:32] for your
[19:33] blood that was shed for us that lord

[19:36] opportunity to have access to your
[19:39] presence to have access to your power
[19:41] to have access to your anointing lord
[19:44] the grace that has been extended to us
[19:47] lord that despite our failures our
[19:50] shortcomings lord you
[19:52] still see something in us lord that sea
[19:55] that you placed in us
[19:57] lord you could still connect it and you
[19:59] could call us so father we come tonight
[20:01] lord for this little bible study this
[20:03] time to have a conversation
[20:06] around your word lord to encourage
[20:09] your people to encourage ourselves in
[20:11] the word tonight
[20:13] lord we see what's unfolding around us
[20:15] we see
[20:16] the plans and movements of the enemy and
[20:19] lord we see what you are doing for your
[20:21] people
[20:21] so lord we are so grateful tonight to
[20:24] break the routine and the norm of what
[20:27] we could be doing tonight
[20:28] lord to enter into your presence we
[20:30] thank you lord for your sons and your
[20:32] daughters lord who have made it their
[20:35] business
[20:36] lord to be in fellowship lord where
[20:38] there are two or three gathered in your
[20:40] name
[20:40] lord it could be virtually it could be
[20:43] in different homes but we are connected
[20:45] tonight and we are gathered in your name
[20:47] lord you are the one who called us you
[20:50] are the one who
[20:51] found us lord your prophet taught us
[20:53] that lord we
[20:54] didn't find this message this message
[20:56] came to us you said it'll
[20:58] fall in the hands of the predestinated
[21:00] so father we commit
[21:01] this meeting into your hands may you
[21:03] bless the word
[21:04] lord may you take me out of the way lord
[21:07] and just encourage
[21:08] lord encourage your people lord may you
[21:10] lord take complete control lord so that
[21:13] lord it will be my own thoughts lord but
[21:15] it will be your word to encourage your
[21:16] people we commit
[21:18] the meeting into your hands in the
[21:19] precious name of jesus christ amen
[21:22] amen and amen well it's certainly a
[21:24] great privilege to be
[21:26] uh gathered here tonight uh by the grace
[21:29] of almighty
[21:30] god and um i was getting a bit of a
[21:33] challenge to connecting on the internet
[21:35] and whenever you see things like that
[21:36] happening you know that satan is mad
[21:39] and satan is trying to trying to to do
[21:42] all that he could do um but you know we
[21:45] have been
[21:46] in the book of revelation and we have
[21:48] been fellowshipping on these things and
[21:49] we
[21:49] understand that you know once you step
[21:52] into
[21:52] a book that the devil hates he is gonna
[21:55] do everything in his power
[21:57] to try to upset your weak to upset your
[21:59] day
[22:00] to do as much as he possibly can to
[22:04] to to distract you to frustrate you you
[22:07] know but we thank god and all these
[22:08] things we already have the victory
[22:10] and we serve a victorious god and we are
[22:14] so encouraged
[22:15] you know by what's unfolding because
[22:17] it's prophecy being fulfilled
[22:19] and we're excited because we didn't
[22:22] choose this walk
[22:23] this walk choose us you know and and
[22:25] that is such such a blessing
[22:27] um you know so like i always say when we
[22:30] come to bible study it's not a service
[22:32] it's an opportunity for us to fellowship
[22:34] around the world and maybe see something
[22:37] that we have not seen before or maybe we
[22:40] are reminded of what we did
[22:42] read or hear or study before but most
[22:45] importantly
[22:46] you know adam said when you talk about
[22:48] him he loves to draw near
[22:49] so we love to talk about him we love to
[22:53] for jesus to be the center of our joy
[22:55] the center of our focus the center of
[22:56] our conversation
[22:58] there's so much that's going around that
[23:00] is designed
[23:01] to distract us you know and it is such a
[23:04] privilege to be able to be called in
[23:06] such a time as this so
[23:07] i salute you all tonight and welcome you
[23:10] all tonight to
[23:11] this little bible study i don't i told
[23:13] over it tonight i i don't want to be too
[23:15] long
[23:16] because um this journey that we are we
[23:18] are on
[23:19] there are some points where i really
[23:20] want to kind of take our time a little
[23:22] bit and kind of touch on a few things
[23:24] um but before i even get into the
[23:27] teaching tonight
[23:29] i was uh really want to appreciate
[23:30] whether steven sent me something
[23:33] um you know about what's happening
[23:34] around the world and
[23:36] i'm i don't know if if you have kind of
[23:38] seen it and stuff like that but
[23:39] i i i had um nikola sitaram do some fact
[23:43] checking for me and and final
[23:45] kind of help me find the articles and
[23:46] stuff like that so i'm gonna try to do
[23:49] this and see
[23:50] if if it could work um
[23:53] to just kind of you know because at
[23:54] first when when somebody
[23:56] shared with me they said they don't if
[23:57] it's fake news or not but i wanted to
[24:00] take this opportunity just kind of point
[24:01] you to a few things
[24:03] you know uh so
[24:07] this is the 12th of january
[24:10] it was announced that kuwait cabinet
[24:13] members resign
[24:14] omit a dispute in parliament now
[24:18] that may seem like just one thing you
[24:20] know so and
[24:21] and if left in isolation it's just it's
[24:24] just another news article
[24:25] you know that may or may not draw your
[24:27] attention to what's going on
[24:29] so this is was announced on the 12th of
[24:31] january
[24:32] and then on the 13th of january the
[24:35] estonia's prime minister resigned
[24:37] over a corruption scandal over there in
[24:41] estonia this is january
[24:42] the 13th bear in mind we are now uh
[24:46] on the 19th day um of january
[24:50] and then two days later on january the
[24:53] 15th
[24:54] the russian government resigns as
[24:56] vladimir putin plans his future
[24:59] and in and around the same day on
[25:01] january 15 the dutch government resigned
[25:04] over child welfare fraud so in isolation
[25:08] it may seem as just news highlights but
[25:11] i'm showing a thread unfolding
[25:13] and and just another day later on the
[25:16] 16th of january of this very same year
[25:19] the government in guinea also resigned
[25:22] the prime minister basically submitted
[25:24] his resignation of his government to the
[25:26] president
[25:27] and then cnn article on january 17th
[25:31] uh cnn covers angela merkel the
[25:34] chancellor of germany saying that she's
[25:35] also going to step down
[25:37] now it's one thing if it's one story and
[25:40] certainly i haven't had a time to
[25:42] explore what's happening
[25:43] in every single country but this is now
[25:46] one two three four
[25:47] five six countries where we have these
[25:50] these different changes taking place and
[25:53] we stand here tonight
[25:55] on january 19th on the eve of january
[25:58] 20th
[25:59] when there is supposed to be another
[26:01] transfer of power
[26:03] as the new u.s president is
[26:06] scheduled to be sworn in on january 20th
[26:09] which is tomorrow and uh in the
[26:11] messenger stephen sent
[26:13] to me he was saying that you know it is
[26:15] it is subtle but it's there
[26:17] there's a transfer of power taking place
[26:19] there are movements
[26:20] and we have been talking about these
[26:22] forces and political
[26:24] movements and all these things happening
[26:26] and suddenly
[26:27] it almost appears as if is is this real
[26:30] how is it possible that in just 19 days
[26:33] in january
[26:34] you have multiple countries multiple
[26:37] situations
[26:38] multiple governments and we have been
[26:40] studying it through the world we have
[26:41] been preaching about it
[26:43] it is it is movements in the ecclesia
[26:45] the ecclesiastical realm movements in
[26:47] the financial realm
[26:48] and even here in trinidad and and many
[26:51] of us and this is the challenge
[26:52] with many of us we sometimes get so
[26:55] buried in our own situation our own
[26:57] challenge our own issues that that we
[27:00] don't even
[27:01] step back as as eagles because an eagle
[27:05] flies high
[27:06] to see what's going on to understand
[27:08] what is happening
[27:09] around it and right here in trinidad
[27:11] there are key phrases being bandied
[27:13] about
[27:13] there's a shortage of the us dollar
[27:16] there's the fact that
[27:17] to import goods and civil and products
[27:20] they did trinidad and tobago
[27:21] it requires the u.s dollar to pay and
[27:23] the shipping companies
[27:25] and the association would represent
[27:26] about 90 of all the important trinidad
[27:30] is requiring u.s dollars which already
[27:32] short to bring products in
[27:33] and already prices are rising and the
[27:36] government is talking about
[27:37] should they be value the currency and
[27:39] and all these things are having impacts
[27:41] and every single
[27:42] country has its challenge every single
[27:45] family
[27:46] has its challenge every single
[27:48] individual
[27:49] has its challenge what is it it's
[27:51] upheavals
[27:52] it shifts in what is going on and
[27:54] ultimately we know it
[27:56] as the whole creation is groaning and
[27:58] travailing for
[27:59] something because something is out of
[28:01] order that is about to get back into
[28:03] order
[28:04] so so the news reporters out there
[28:07] are reporting it from their viewpoint
[28:10] you know and and they could only see it
[28:12] from their angle
[28:13] you know um like i was listening to
[28:15] something this morning
[28:16] and somebody was saying if you want to
[28:18] describe a teacup
[28:20] and you look from a t look at a teacup
[28:24] from on top
[28:25] you know it may just look like two
[28:27] circles the circle of the teacup on the
[28:29] inside
[28:30] and the circle of the saucer on the
[28:31] outside and somebody could spend their
[28:33] entire time describing
[28:35] this is what they saw they saw a circle
[28:36] in a circle where there's just a top
[28:38] view of the teacup
[28:40] and another person could be seeing just
[28:42] the side of the teacup
[28:44] and they draw the shape of a teacup and
[28:47] and the challenge of it
[28:48] is this looking at the teacup from above
[28:51] or from the side both views are
[28:55] actually correct but it's not the whole
[28:56] picture let me see it one more time
[28:59] looking at a teacup from on top or
[29:01] looking at a teacup from at the side
[29:03] the person who is describing what they
[29:05] are seeing would both be correct
[29:07] he challenges they are not seeing the
[29:10] entire picture
[29:11] because the entire picture is a 3d
[29:13] picture to see the entire cup you cannot
[29:15] just see it from one side
[29:17] you need to get a three-dimensional view
[29:20] to see that the cup has so much more to
[29:22] it than this
[29:23] so we who are called as spiritual
[29:26] astronauts
[29:27] in this time have the insight through
[29:30] the reveal word
[29:31] through scripture to see what is
[29:34] unfolding before us
[29:35] and it's not to shake us it is to
[29:37] encourage us to show us
[29:38] that this gospel is in fact real that
[29:40] this message isn't real is
[29:42] it israel i remember the brahms spoke
[29:44] about all these things and the world
[29:45] powers and all these things coming into
[29:47] there
[29:47] when you see it in such quick succession
[29:49] happening in front of us
[29:51] it is certainly a sign to us an
[29:53] encouragement to us
[29:54] that our time of leaving this place is
[29:57] coming to be soon
[29:58] and it's an encouragement to us that we
[30:00] are going to leave here shouting and
[30:01] victorious
[30:02] because the same way that there's a
[30:04] transfer of power that is required in
[30:06] all these different countries there's
[30:07] also a more important
[30:09] transfer of power that is taking place
[30:11] as born
[30:12] sons filled sons place sons take their
[30:16] position
[30:16] of power you know so so all of what is
[30:19] happening it's just a smokescreen
[30:21] hallelujah it's just a smoke screen for
[30:24] the real transfer of power
[30:26] because the god of this evil age is is
[30:28] losing
[30:29] his grip on this world is getting loosed
[30:32] because sons and daughters are coming
[30:34] into a realization of who they
[30:36] are and the moment she gets to know who
[30:38] she is
[30:39] the moment these sons take their place
[30:42] and and and the fullness of the power
[30:44] that's predestinated for us
[30:45] is now dwelling in adopted sons places
[30:49] oh you haven't seen anything yet so i
[30:51] wanted to encourage you tonight
[30:53] as i always say lift your head up square
[30:55] your shoulders god is not
[30:57] finished with you he's in fact he's only
[30:59] getting started
[31:00] so i want to encourage you he who
[31:01] started to work in you he is
[31:03] more than able to finish you the work

[31:53] you know so one of the things that i do
[31:54] personally when i'm driving i try to

[31:57] because you're trying to redeem time
[32:00] this world has so much things going on
[32:02] that if you don't find ways to hack your
[32:05] time so to speak
[32:06] you're going to be left behind and and
[32:09] then the speaker was saying that you
[32:10] know
[32:11] no animal could transform itself a dog
[32:14] is a dog the dog not trying to be a cow
[32:18] a cow is a cow the corner trying to be a
[32:20] horse
[32:21] you know animals are what they are a
[32:23] bird is a bird
[32:25] a fish is a fish but he said man
[32:28] is the only being that has the ability
[32:32] to transform himself
[32:34] he has the ability to move from not
[32:36] knowing to knowing
[32:38] so you may not know spanish but if you
[32:41] decide in your heart you want to learn
[32:42] spanish
[32:43] you can move from not knowing spanish to
[32:46] being fluent in spanish
[32:47] if the desire in you is great enough
[32:50] anybody with me
[32:51] you can transform yourself from somebody
[32:54] who doesn't save
[32:55] into somebody who budgets and saves you
[32:57] could transform yourself
[32:59] by your decisions by your thoughts by
[33:02] your actions
[33:03] to somebody with no prayer life to
[33:05] somebody who has a prayer life anybody
[33:06] with me tonight
[33:07] you could transform yourself from not
[33:09] knowing and just by picking up a book
[33:12] you could change from not knowing about
[33:14] something to
[33:15] knowing about something else anybody
[33:17] with me and
[33:18] and this gospel that we preach that
[33:21] jesus
[33:22] brought was a gospel of transformation
[33:24] he took peter from a man who was going
[33:26] after natural fish
[33:28] and that man peter was transformed from
[33:30] going after natural fish to being fishes
[33:32] of men anybody with meat tonight
[33:34] all right so gosh a god of
[33:35] transformation he took a man
[33:37] named moses who had a speech impediment
[33:42] oh my wouldn't say i can't talk he took
[33:45] that man with a speech impediment
[33:46] and make him and make him a prophet that
[33:49] could lead the entire revolution
[33:51] what would happen tonight if god's
[33:53] desire for transformation
[33:55] connects with your desire for
[33:56] transformation anybody with me
[34:00] oh hallelujah what will happen because
[34:02] god wants us to change he said
[34:04] be transformed by the renewing of your
[34:07] mind some of our minds are messed up you
[34:08] know
[34:11] you know whenever your computer run into
[34:12] a problem they say reboot the computer
[34:16] as as as as as i was trying to connect
[34:19] to this service tonight
[34:20] a message brother over to say my
[34:22] internet giving some trouble i'm going
[34:24] to reset the router
[34:27] because i don't know what happened to
[34:28] the router but if i if i reset the
[34:30] router
[34:31] it it restarts the the the connections i
[34:34] don't understand the mechanics of it
[34:36] but i know the dynamics part now when i
[34:38] hit the reset button
[34:40] that thing starts all over again and it
[34:42] has worked different when i reset it
[34:45] so i went and i reset the router why
[34:47] brother anthony was singing
[34:49] i want to come back the connection i
[34:50] have now is different from what i had
[34:52] when i was trying to speak a little
[34:53] earlier anybody with me
[34:54] tonight so the bible said be transformed
[34:58] by the renewing or the resetting or the
[35:01] rebooting or the recalibrating of your
[35:03] mind
[35:04] so that the connection that you have
[35:06] with your heavenly father
[35:07] you have a better connection sometimes
[35:09] the connection we have does be sticking
[35:12] i don't know i feel good you have to
[35:14] forgive me sometimes the connection
[35:16] with the father does be sticking but
[35:18] when you renew your mind you reset
[35:20] some of the ideas that you've been
[35:22] working with some of the approaches
[35:24] you've been working with and you reset
[35:25] it
[35:26] back to the factory settings that was
[35:28] there before there was a world
[35:30] before there was a moon before there was
[35:32] a star the original
[35:33] factory settings the original plan that
[35:36] god has for you
[35:37] because but the branham taught us god
[35:39] doesn't leave us we are the ones who
[35:41] leave him
[35:42] but if you want to find him get back to
[35:44] where you left him
[35:46] anybody with me tonight you could blame
[35:48] anybody you could blame
[35:49] this one you could blame that one but
[35:51] we're not playing the blame game tonight
[35:53] we want to look at ourselves we want to
[35:56] look at ourselves and look at the word
[35:58] this is not about the person next to you
[36:00] there's another body person next to you
[36:01] in the zoom room
[36:02] or the person next to you in the church
[36:04] pew or the person next to you in the
[36:06] house
[36:06] this is about you looking at your word
[36:08] and looking at yourself
[36:10] and trying to see okay what do i need to
[36:12] do
[36:13] to be changed what do i need to do to be
[36:15] different
[36:16] all right so i'm i'm yielding tonight
[36:19] it's this feels like a different kind of
[36:20] bible study but
[36:21] but but but we are in the word all right
[36:23] because nothing that we're saying
[36:25] tonight
[36:25] is out of order and we want to be so
[36:27] connected
[36:28] with what the world has for us so by the
[36:31] grace of god tonight
[36:32] we we want to continue uh
[36:36] from last week where we started
[36:39] a study on the book of revelation study
[36:42] of revelation
[36:43] uh part one is where we went to last
[36:46] week
[36:46] and by the grace of god we want to go a
[36:49] little further
[36:50] and just kind of touch a few points and
[36:52] kind of encouraging people
[36:54] remind the church you know of a few
[36:56] things and
[36:57] and and you know everything that we're
[37:00] sharing we could find in the prophet's
[37:01] message and through scripture
[37:03] so i encourage you friends the word is
[37:06] your strength
[37:08] you know and and and you have to get
[37:10] more passionate
[37:12] you have to it has to become a passion
[37:14] to you it has to be a passion for you to
[37:16] live this word
[37:17] you know it must become your joy the joy
[37:19] of the lord as your strength
[37:21] all right so we want to start in the
[37:23] book of revelation
[37:25] uh chapter two we would have spent some
[37:27] time
[37:28] in revelation one last week we have
[37:31] talked about
[37:32] john and we know that john has a type of
[37:35] the bride
[37:36] we understood that he was on the isle of
[37:38] patmos
[37:39] he was not there by his own choosing he
[37:42] didn't apply to go there he was not
[37:44] there on vacation
[37:45] he was not there on retirement he was
[37:48] there because they accused him of being
[37:50] a witch after they attempted to fry him
[37:53] and they realized he was unfriable i
[37:55] know that's not a word
[37:57] but he was unfriable after they put him
[37:59] to fry
[38:00] and they thought that he would be fried
[38:03] and boiled whatever you want to say
[38:04] about it
[38:05] they recognize that this man not going
[38:07] down and
[38:08] and and and and they basically throw
[38:11] their hands and say send them to patmos
[38:13] you know that is when they get
[38:14] frustrated because they attempt to kill
[38:16] him
[38:16] field and when the attempts to kill him
[38:19] field they sent him in a place that they
[38:21] thought he would just
[38:22] shrivel up you know and and and when the
[38:25] attempts at the enemy fail to kill
[38:27] you know the devil will only try to
[38:29] frustrate you but
[38:31] in in sending john into a place of
[38:34] of of hard and and and and a rough
[38:37] situation
[38:38] it was there that god came to john in
[38:40] his rough place in his dry
[38:42] place in a in a place where he was among
[38:45] people who
[38:46] who may have deserved to be there
[38:48] because he didn't deserve to be there
[38:50] but yet in that place god was able to
[38:52] speak to him
[38:53] so i want to encourage you tonight
[38:55] whatever place you're in
[38:56] it is it is not by accident it is not by
[38:59] chance
[39:00] because god doesn't give us more than we
[39:01] could pay this this this gospel that we
[39:04] preach this
[39:05] message is is riddled with things that
[39:08] we may
[39:08] never understand because only the things
[39:10] that are revealed belongs to us
[39:12] but we do know one thing that trials and
[39:15] testings and oppression and persecution
[39:18] and being hated is all part of the
[39:20] territory
[39:21] that's why the bible say think it not
[39:23] strange
[39:24] when you when you meet some fiery trial
[39:26] don't don't think it's a strange thing
[39:28] don't
[39:29] don't feel like you're surprised about
[39:31] it when you meet a fiery trial
[39:33] because because this is not supposed to
[39:34] be strange to us
[39:36] um you know so i want to encourage you
[39:38] tonight if you're in a fiery trial
[39:40] you're in a good place because it's not
[39:42] a strange thing we should be
[39:44] familiar with fairy trials we should be
[39:46] comfortable
[39:47] in fiery trials anybody with me tonight
[39:50] so let's go revelation 2 and verse 1
[39:55] unto the angel of the church of ephesus
[39:58] right these things saith he
[40:02] that hold it to seven stars in his right
[40:05] hand
[40:06] who walk it in the midst of the seven
[40:09] golden
[40:09] candlesticks revelation two verse one i
[40:12] want to read it one more time
[40:13] unto the angel of the church of ephesus
[40:16] right
[40:17] these things say that he that hold it
[40:20] the seven stars in his right hand who
[40:23] walk it in the
[40:24] midst of the seven golden candlesticks
[40:27] i want to read it from the amplified
[40:30] because the amplified
[40:32] pulls out some words there that i kind
[40:34] of like to amplify on if i could use
[40:36] that
[40:37] so the amplified says to the angel
[40:39] divine
[40:40] messenger so so so it even
[40:43] gives a bit more clarity that there's a
[40:45] divine messenger
[40:46] of the church in ephesus these are the
[40:49] words of the one
[40:50] who holds firmly the seven stars
[40:54] so firmly the seven stars meaning these
[40:57] stars aren't
[40:57] arbitrarily held they are not randomly
[41:00] chosen or randomly held
[41:02] which are the angels or messengers
[41:05] of the seven churches in his right hand
[41:08] the one who walked among the seven
[41:10] golden lampstands or the seven
[41:13] churches now brother branham in the
[41:16] ephesian
[41:16] church age for those who have read it
[41:19] this will be somewhat of a refresher
[41:21] for those who have not read it um
[41:24] i encourage you to go into it and those
[41:26] who have read it read it seven more
[41:28] times
[41:28] because all of these things are true to
[41:30] us because we know through the prophet's
[41:32] message
[41:33] he said there has to be an ephesians to
[41:35] this he said the
[41:36] ephesian church was the first church the
[41:39] ephesian church
[41:40] was the template what was said there
[41:42] would have lasted throughout all ages
[41:44] and he spoke of all the church ages from
[41:47] ephesus to laodicea
[41:49] and these seven church ages or these
[41:51] seven churches
[41:52] were seven gentile churches
[41:55] that were physically located in asia
[41:58] minor
[41:59] but he said these seven churches were
[42:02] not just
[42:03] geographical or physical or local
[42:05] churches but they were also
[42:06] spiritual conditions they were also
[42:09] dispensational ages
[42:10] there were many things that he
[42:12] identified about these seven church ages
[42:14] that was that bridge between the time
[42:17] that god
[42:18] had given to the jews and at the ending
[42:21] of this
[42:22] gentile dispensation that he would get
[42:25] back to the jews again
[42:27] so brother branham was speaking about
[42:29] ephesus as a church
[42:31] and we're going to pull out a few things
[42:33] but brother branham also
[42:34] brought out that there were three major
[42:37] locations where christianity flourished
[42:40] firstly was jerusalem which is
[42:42] understandable second was antioch
[42:44] and third was ephesus ephesus we know at
[42:48] some point
[42:49] it was pastored by paul and we know that
[42:51] paul
[42:52] is the messenger of that age paul in
[42:54] traveling would have left timothy
[42:56] and we have touched these teachings in
[42:57] the past timothy would have been
[42:59] the first bishop almost the first pastor
[43:01] of that ephesus church
[43:03] all right and brother branham and
[43:05] bringing these things out
[43:06] he said that first verse of scripture
[43:09] unto the angel speaking about paul of
[43:11] that first
[43:12] church that church that was a template
[43:15] you know and brother branham and
[43:16] speaking about the
[43:17] condition of ephesus he went to touch on
[43:21] certain things that was unique
[43:22] about that specific church he spoke
[43:25] about how
[43:26] subtle the enemy operated in that age
[43:31] because that age was the strongest of
[43:34] ages
[43:34] you know whenever branham drew it all
[43:36] out he drew
[43:38] with the the light shrinking until this
[43:40] last aid was almost blacked out
[43:42] completely
[43:43] so the most light would have been in
[43:44] that first age but he said the presence
[43:47] and the
[43:47] subtle move of the enemy was there in
[43:50] the first age
[43:51] but the branham and ephesian church you
[43:53] could read it i'm just touching some
[43:54] highlights
[43:55] he would have talked about spoken about
[43:57] how they did temple worship in that day
[44:00] and how they had an image of the goddess
[44:03] diana
[44:03] that was not as bright or as clear or as
[44:07] beautiful as it normally would be
[44:09] and it was almost like it was a reduced
[44:12] version of the deity
[44:14] but yet still what was unique about it
[44:17] is that it was but it said it was almost
[44:20] shapeless
[44:22] and the fact that it was shapeless he
[44:24] said it depicts the spirit of the
[44:26] antichrist
[44:26] loosed in the midst of the people with
[44:29] no shape
[44:30] to alarm the people so he was painting
[44:34] this picture
[44:34] that the conditions that existed there
[44:36] that was subtle he said
[44:38] the two arms were of iron
[44:41] that it was the intent to crush the work
[44:44] of god
[44:45] as he made inroads and no one seemed to
[44:48] notice what was happening
[44:49] so i'm just painting a picture of the
[44:51] context before we even advance further
[44:54] and we're not going to be too long into
[44:55] this but it made them goes on
[44:57] to talk about all the rituals that
[44:59] existed in that day
[45:00] the priestesses and the high the man of
[45:04] political power
[45:05] this was what was existing while
[45:07] christianity was there these were all of
[45:09] the
[45:10] the underlying elements that were
[45:12] stirring at that time
[45:13] that was slowly beginning to creep into
[45:16] what was happening in the church now
[45:19] brother branham
[45:20] said as well in that first verse that he
[45:23] was he was
[45:24] speaking to paul the messenger of the
[45:26] age
[45:27] and we know from teaching that paul was
[45:30] the gold standard
[45:32] and the more as i look at this and i
[45:34] realized
[45:36] he said he holds seven stars in his
[45:38] right hand
[45:39] so we know that these seven stars are
[45:41] seven messengers seven men
[45:43] we know them paul irenaeus martin
[45:46] columba
[45:46] luther wesley and brother branham and
[45:49] the more i look at it and the more that
[45:51] i
[45:51] see how brother browner was painting
[45:54] this picture
[45:55] of these two elements he is hauling
[45:58] these seven stars and he amplified it
[46:00] says firmly
[46:01] and by firmly means he he's not gonna
[46:03] risk letting it go
[46:05] he has a very tight hole and these seven
[46:08] stars these
[46:08] these seven men these seven men are
[46:11] important
[46:11] to him so i want to nail down because in
[46:15] ephesians
[46:16] we'll see it later in this age when we
[46:18] talk about how they hated the deeds of
[46:20] the nicolaitans
[46:22] the reality was god in his mind
[46:25] had an order with how he was going to
[46:27] restore
[46:28] so god in unfolding these church ages in
[46:32] dealing with these churches
[46:34] and it's relevant to us because it is
[46:36] still unfolding
[46:37] even till now he hand-picked these seven
[46:40] men
[46:42] so paul was the only one that god was
[46:46] dealing with in this
[46:47] measure in that age i want to say it one
[46:49] more time
[46:50] and but the branham made it clear that
[46:52] paul was the gold standard
[46:54] by which every other messenger who would
[46:57] come after
[46:58] paul would be measured anybody with me
[47:01] so it means that
[47:02] paul irenaeus martin they were all
[47:05] approximating to that gold standard
[47:07] which was established
[47:08] with ephesus as the church the ephesians
[47:11] church
[47:12] and the messenger of that age so i want
[47:15] to
[47:16] raise a question tonight then because as
[47:18] we dig deeper into this we recognize
[47:20] that
[47:21] even in this conversation about god and
[47:25] the seven stars there's no other
[47:28] men being mentioned there i want to be
[47:31] careful in saying this
[47:33] so as i look further meaning it doesn't
[47:36] matter what ministry you had in the days
[47:38] of paul
[47:39] paul's ministry was the only star
[47:45] the same way in our age there's only one
[47:48] star
[47:48] to our age i don't care how gifted
[47:51] somebody is
[47:52] how much they know what they could
[47:54] expound i'm not a star
[47:56] in the context of these seven stars
[47:59] anybody with me the role of star
[48:03] was being expressed to john god already
[48:06] made up his mind anybody
[48:07] with me tonight who these stars were
[48:10] god was settled in his heart who these
[48:13] stars were
[48:14] what they were supposed to do what their
[48:16] makeup was going to be
[48:17] what their nature was going to be how
[48:19] they were going to minister
[48:20] what they had to endure so i find it
[48:23] very difficult
[48:24] that we could be students of the
[48:26] scripture and students of these
[48:29] message and find anybody who could even
[48:32] approximate
[48:32] these seven stars because this is a
[48:35] class all by itself
[48:37] it's only seven stars are being held in
[48:39] your right hand
[48:40] behind the power of god like these men
[48:43] anybody with me
[48:44] no pastor teacher evangelist
[48:48] even prophet outside of these seven men
[48:51] could even
[48:52] qualify to be one of the seven stars
[48:54] those seats have been filled
[48:56] i want to establish it clearly the fact
[48:59] that those seats have been
[49:00] filled and the purpose to be achieved
[49:03] by these seven men have been fulfilled
[49:06] mean
[49:07] that work of these seven men are
[49:09] complete
[49:10] anybody with me i want to nail it down
[49:13] because there is an and to bring it to
[49:16] context to present the present tense
[49:19] people look to their local church and
[49:21] their local pastor or ministers in
[49:23] different places
[49:24] with a certain level of of adoration and
[49:27] adulation
[49:29] that cannot equate when you place
[49:32] these stars where they should be
[49:36] because if you are not careful you will
[49:38] give more honor
[49:40] to gifts that would now displace the
[49:43] role that god himself placed with these
[49:44] seven stars
[49:47] anybody with me i'm nailing down
[49:49] something here
[49:52] because these seven stars from paul all
[49:54] the way to brother branham
[49:56] these it wasn't eight stars he had in
[49:57] his hand it wasn't ten stars he had
[49:59] it wasn't ten seven stars and some
[50:01] secondary stars
[50:02] and some tertiary stars and these were
[50:05] other stars in case this star didn't
[50:06] make it clear
[50:07] and no no no no no no only seven stars
[50:10] of which paul was the original the
[50:13] template the
[50:14] model and this paul was so clear in that
[50:16] first you see if an angel
[50:18] from heaven come and preach any other
[50:20] gospel or any secondary revelation
[50:23] from what i preached let him be accused
[50:26] and the attitude
[50:27] the strength the answer the anointing
[50:30] the power that these seven men operated
[50:33] with there's nobody could even
[50:34] approximate
[50:36] to these men anybody with me
[50:39] tonight doesn't it make you deeply
[50:42] appreciative of
[50:43] the prophet and his message to our day
[50:47] the reason i want to nail this down
[50:49] church is that there are messy churches
[50:51] who have lost the prophet has lost his
[50:55] place in their churches
[50:59] because that's how men's ideas begin to
[51:01] flourish and men's interpretation begins
[51:03] to forage and men's ideas begin to
[51:06] flourish
[51:10] anybody with me tonight all right so i
[51:12] want to nail this down
[51:14] because once we get this foundation and
[51:16] you get it as a revelation
[51:17] then nobody can shake you so brother
[51:20] branham said it this way in ephesian
[51:22] churches
[51:23] in that right hand of power our seven
[51:25] stars
[51:26] who according to revelation 1 20 that we
[51:29] read last week
[51:30] are the seven church messengers
[51:34] this signifies that the very power and
[51:36] authority of god are behind
[51:38] his messengers to every age
[51:41] they go forth in fire and power of the
[51:44] holy ghost with the word
[51:45] they are stars because they reflect
[51:46] light the light they reflect is his
[51:49] light they have no light of their own
[51:51] and that's why i want to be careful
[51:53] because listen we
[51:54] had a light that was reflecting his
[51:57] light
[52:00] i have no message you know this i am
[52:03] feasting
[52:04] on the reflection of the light
[52:05] hallelujah that came from him
[52:07] through that star so we cut your credit
[52:12] for what we bringing out tonight you
[52:14] can't take credit
[52:15] for what you're hearing or what you know
[52:17] because it we are beneficiaries of the
[52:19] divine plan of god
[52:21] to place seven stars in his right hand
[52:24] listen to the prophet
[52:25] they kill not their own fires that men
[52:27] may walk in the light of their sparks
[52:31] you know how many people i've heard in
[52:33] the message say well it's my revelation
[52:34] and and this is what my revelation is
[52:36] and my revelation
[52:37] this sh this shuts that down eh
[52:41] when people say step like revealing what
[52:43] the prophet never revealed
[52:46] and it an opening mysteries that the
[52:48] prophet never opened
[52:50] you see how dangerous and and how that
[52:52] road could lead you down to
[52:55] anybody with me listen to the prophet
[52:59] these seven messengers
[53:01] are making god known to the people he
[53:04] that received them
[53:05] received him that sent them he stands
[53:08] behind them
[53:08] with all the power of the godhead
[53:14] hallelujah my my
[53:17] my mind so we're still in verse 1 unto
[53:19] the angel of the church of ephesus right
[53:22] these things say that he that hold it
[53:24] the seven stars
[53:25] now we know who that he is it is the
[53:28] lord jesus christ himself
[53:30] holding the seven stars in his right
[53:32] hand who walk it in the midst of the
[53:34] seven
[53:35] golden candlesticks but abraham said
[53:37] that these seven gold and casting we
[53:39] know are the seven churches in the
[53:40] seventh ages
[53:41] and listen to the prophet notice you
[53:45] will notice
[53:45] now you know that is walking alone in
[53:48] the midst of his churches
[53:50] he said there's no one else with him he
[53:53] alone is walking through his churches
[53:55] he is walking through this room tonight
[53:57] he is walking through every age
[53:59] but abraham said what he was in the
[54:01] first age he is to all ages
[54:03] to every believer he is jesus christ the
[54:06] same yesterday today and forever we
[54:08] still in verse 1.
[54:09] he said no one else is with him neither
[54:12] indeed can there be
[54:13] for he alone wrought her salvation and
[54:16] having purchased her with his own blood
[54:18] he owns her
[54:21] he is her lord and master she gives him
[54:23] all the glory
[54:25] and that glory he will not share with
[54:27] another
[54:28] so this walking through the church ages
[54:30] is the lord jesus himself
[54:32] walking through every age and walking
[54:34] through now every church
[54:35] anybody with me listen to the prophet
[54:38] there's no pope with him
[54:40] there's no arch bishop with him mary the
[54:42] mother of his earthly bodies not with
[54:44] him
[54:45] he does not speak and turn to a father
[54:47] for he is the father
[54:48] he doesn't turn to give orders to the
[54:50] holy spirit for he is god
[54:52] eternal spirit and it is his life that
[54:55] is flowing
[54:56] and pulsating in the church giving her
[54:59] life and without him
[55:00] there would be no life
[55:04] anybody with me there was no one with
[55:06] him when he tried the fierceness
[55:08] of the wrath of the fiery furnace it was
[55:11] not another but him
[55:12] who hung up on the cross and gave his
[55:14] blood he's the author and finish of our
[55:16] fate
[55:16] he's the alpha and omega of our
[55:18] salvation we are exposed to him
[55:21] and not another we don't belong to a
[55:23] church
[55:26] i'm really profiting him we don't belong
[55:29] to a church
[55:30] we belong to him his word is law creeds
[55:34] dogmas bylaws and constitutions have no
[55:36] effect on us
[55:38] yes it is jesus alone who walks in the
[55:41] midst of the churches
[55:43] it is god in her willing and doing of
[55:46] his good pleasure
[55:47] never forget that you have only one
[55:50] relationship to god and god has only one
[55:52] relationship to you
[55:53] that is jesus anybody with me
[55:58] all of this friends is to make sure it
[56:01] is clear in your
[56:02] mind what god is doing how he's
[56:04] unfolding himself
[56:05] and how critical no more than ever it is
[56:08] about that personal
[56:09] relationship with god
[56:14] let's move on a little bit
[56:17] brother branham and i want you to catch
[56:19] this
[56:21] who walking in the midst of the seven
[56:23] golden can we still in verse one
[56:26] how meaningful are those words the
[56:28] prophet said when viewed in the light of
[56:30] the scripture
[56:31] which described him as christ who is our
[56:33] life
[56:34] for christ indeed is the life of the
[56:36] church she
[56:37] has no other life without him listen
[56:40] carefully
[56:41] she is simply a religious society a club
[56:45] a meaningless gathering of people
[56:48] i want to nail that down again because i
[56:51] was sharing it and i've shared it many
[56:52] times
[56:53] it don't matter how much programs you
[56:54] have it don't matter how much
[56:56] thing you have and you try to do this
[56:57] and do that and do that if christ
[56:59] is not in the hearts if he's not moving
[57:01] through the church if you're not seeing
[57:03] his power
[57:04] all the activities wasting time
[57:08] because only he can bring change you
[57:10] cannot program change
[57:12] the change we want is not program change
[57:15] it's not
[57:15] it's not because we train you to mark
[57:17] your marching it has to be
[57:19] him do any change anybody with me
[57:21] tonight
[57:24] hallelujah my my my my mind
[57:27] so unto the angel of the church of
[57:30] ephesus
[57:31] right these things say that he so is
[57:33] placing him in qatar so we understand
[57:35] who is speaking
[57:36] it could have said these things say the
[57:37] lord jesus christ
[57:39] but but the way it is being expressed is
[57:41] to place context on the magnitude of
[57:43] what is being said
[57:44] saying he that holds the seven stars in
[57:46] his right hand and who
[57:48] walk it in the midst of the seven goal
[57:50] and canceling now let's go on
[57:52] i know thy works and i labor
[57:57] undy patience and how thou cans not dear
[58:01] them
[58:01] which are evil and has strived them
[58:05] which say they are apostles and are not
[58:08] and has found them liars that's a heavy
[58:11] verse right there
[58:13] i want to read it in the amplified i
[58:15] know your deeds
[58:17] and your toil and your patient
[58:20] endurance and that you cannot tolerate
[58:23] those who are evil and have tested
[58:27] and critically appraised those who call
[58:30] themselves apostles
[58:32] and the abba fight said special
[58:34] messengers
[58:35] personally chosen representatives of
[58:37] christ you see anybody say well i am the
[58:39] one that
[58:40] you have to be careful in and in fact
[58:43] are not
[58:43] and have found them to be liars and
[58:45] imposters this is amplified
[58:49] hallelujah now
[58:53] when i first read this and and i love
[58:55] how brother branham addressed it
[58:57] but when i first read this because when
[58:58] you read this
[59:00] passage from revelation 2 from 1 to
[59:03] seven
[59:04] it reads in a certain structure it
[59:06] identifies who
[59:07] is speaking who is being addressed
[59:10] the subject of what is being addressed
[59:13] then it goes into
[59:14] it is almost like it's a performance
[59:16] appraisal
[59:18] for those who who who are in jobs where
[59:21] there's a performance review
[59:23] the typical performance review takes the
[59:25] form of
[59:26] these are the things you do well
[59:30] these are the things you need to improve
[59:32] and these are the goals i'm giving you
[59:34] to be able to reach where you need to
[59:35] reach typically that's how our
[59:37] performance review
[59:38] goes and and any good manager would take
[59:41] a certain format
[59:42] because if i come at you with all the
[59:44] things you're doing wrong first
[59:46] you would not really be too receptive
[59:48] but if i speak to you firstly about what
[59:51] is
[59:51] positive about your work ethic what is
[59:53] positive about how you operate
[59:55] then you would have a uh you would be
[59:57] more receptive for when i want to tell
[59:59] you well
[1:00:00] now that i know you've been coming to
[1:00:01] work on time and and and you have been
[1:00:04] submitting your reports
[1:00:05] and and and you don't really just take
[1:00:07] random days and and all these good
[1:00:09] things
[1:00:09] i want to address this little issue that
[1:00:12] we observe about
[1:00:13] your your performance and now that we
[1:00:15] address this issue
[1:00:17] now i want to give you our goal all
[1:00:19] right so that is exactly what is
[1:00:20] structured here
[1:00:21] it says i know your works and then it
[1:00:23] goes into later on we'll get to it
[1:00:25] nevertheless i have some issues with you
[1:00:27] and then it ends off with
[1:00:29] he that overcome it which is if you hit
[1:00:31] these objectives
[1:00:32] if you hit these targets if you overcome
[1:00:34] these obstacles that you're going
[1:00:35] through there's going to be a reward
[1:00:36] anybody with me
[1:00:38] so brother branham also said it like
[1:00:40] this he said how beautiful
[1:00:42] the savior praises and commands his
[1:00:45] children
[1:00:46] now the core of this teaching is really
[1:00:49] god is going after the issue to address
[1:00:52] because if you come to church
[1:00:53] and i only tell you you're good you're
[1:00:56] good you're good you're good
[1:00:57] there's no change of behavior so you
[1:01:00] have to know what is being done well
[1:01:02] and then more importantly what you're
[1:01:05] really coming to church
[1:01:06] for is to find out how to improve
[1:01:09] you want to know what any good employee
[1:01:12] wants to know give me feedback yes i
[1:01:15] want to know what i'm doing well but i'm
[1:01:17] more interested
[1:01:18] in what i need to improve because if i
[1:01:21] don't improve i can find myself
[1:01:23] on the list of people to go home anybody
[1:01:26] with me
[1:01:26] tonight and it's the same way but
[1:01:28] abraham said
[1:01:30] how beautiful the savior praises and
[1:01:32] commends his children
[1:01:34] he takes full account of their fine
[1:01:36] spiritual attitudes and behavior
[1:01:39] listen he knows that there is weakness
[1:01:42] among them
[1:01:43] but as yet he doesn't cry out against it
[1:01:47] as a student of management this
[1:01:50] is so better than the only textbook i
[1:01:52] ever read and before my review
[1:01:54] because god knows there's an issue but
[1:01:56] he's approaching it a certain way
[1:01:58] he said i know your works hallelujah i
[1:02:01] see what you're doing
[1:02:02] i see you showing up in bible study i
[1:02:05] see you
[1:02:06] making an effort to be the premier team
[1:02:08] i see you're paying your tithe i see you
[1:02:10] making an effort to connect to the live
[1:02:12] stream i see you testifying
[1:02:14] i i see you read a little scripture
[1:02:16] there i see you
[1:02:17] making an effort he said i know your
[1:02:19] works and i
[1:02:21] labor and by the event said that labor
[1:02:23] is under the pressure and the toil
[1:02:25] he says is is labor signifies awareness
[1:02:28] true oppression
[1:02:29] is there anybody who has some wariness
[1:02:31] true oppression
[1:02:32] don't show my razor answer god's people
[1:02:35] [Music]
[1:02:37] hallelujah glory so here it is you say i
[1:02:41] know your works
[1:02:42] i see your labor and your patience
[1:02:45] you're enduring
[1:02:46] you're in a message a long time you're
[1:02:48] holding on
[1:02:49] you have seen a lot you have endured or
[1:02:52] not
[1:02:54] and and and this description applies now
[1:02:57] because this is describing bride of that
[1:03:00] day
[1:03:01] but also it's an attribute or a
[1:03:03] description of bride
[1:03:04] in general so so the bride's supposed to
[1:03:08] be able to show works
[1:03:09] the bride's supposed to be able to have
[1:03:11] their labor the bride's supposed to have
[1:03:13] patience and and i want to kind of drill
[1:03:16] down here now because
[1:03:17] i believe in bringing it personal i
[1:03:18] don't want to see it as is the ephesians
[1:03:20] age and this is bright
[1:03:21] no so you you as a person me as a person
[1:03:25] does god know your works couldn't can he
[1:03:30] say he know your works
[1:03:32] have you done enough work for him to
[1:03:33] know your work
[1:03:36] you know when your boss going through
[1:03:38] the company and you want to know who are
[1:03:40] the top performers
[1:03:41] anybody with me tonight you have some
[1:03:44] people who
[1:03:45] there's they'll be working but but dear
[1:03:48] really
[1:03:49] doing anything to get recognized then
[1:03:51] but here
[1:03:52] god is saying i know your work fame to
[1:03:54] know your works it means
[1:03:55] your work is not recognizable
[1:03:59] it is like cornelius a vile stored up of
[1:04:02] his prayers
[1:04:04] it it got recognized it got attention he
[1:04:07] he broke through
[1:04:08] something that created a level of
[1:04:10] recognition
[1:04:14] it is like when the sons of skiva tried
[1:04:16] to cast out them spirits and
[1:04:18] and and the devil said but wait a minute
[1:04:19] paul i know
[1:04:21] peter i know but who but who are you
[1:04:23] they were unknown
[1:04:25] so so can it be said about you as a
[1:04:27] believer tonight
[1:04:29] that your works are known what you do
[1:04:32] for the lord is known what you do for
[1:04:34] the kingdom is
[1:04:35] known it can be recognized it can be
[1:04:37] identified
[1:04:39] or are you in the army and you're never
[1:04:40] sure enough for duty
[1:04:42] i know thy works and i labor
[1:04:45] you're under pressure you're under
[1:04:47] pressure in your home but you're not
[1:04:48] giving up
[1:04:50] you're under pressure in your marriage
[1:04:51] but you're not giving up you're under
[1:04:53] pressure with your children but you're
[1:04:54] not giving up and that is recognized
[1:04:56] it's it's under the oppression by the
[1:04:58] brandon said
[1:04:59] wherein is true oppression yes we get
[1:05:01] tired
[1:05:02] but i know that i labor because despite
[1:05:05] the labor
[1:05:06] your prayer is still coming up your
[1:05:08] worship's still coming up
[1:05:09] you're going through hard times but
[1:05:11] because you are a contrarian
[1:05:13] which means you're moving different from
[1:05:15] how other people expect it to move
[1:05:17] it it is something that i could
[1:05:19] recognize and thy patience
[1:05:21] that that that patience is enduring
[1:05:24] holding on
[1:05:25] you know there's a promise of change you
[1:05:27] know there's a promise of the holy ghost
[1:05:28] you know there's a promise of making it
[1:05:30] but you're patient
[1:05:31] you haven't seen it yet in your life but
[1:05:33] you know it's a reality
[1:05:34] and it will settle for nothing less so
[1:05:37] you want it and it be impatient
[1:05:38] you will not accept nothing less so you
[1:05:41] cannot be
[1:05:42] partly satisfied so you remain in
[1:05:44] patience
[1:05:47] don't want to get this part and how
[1:05:48] though can't not bear
[1:05:50] them which are evil now but the brandon
[1:05:52] went into this at length
[1:05:54] and i immediately time to go into it but
[1:05:57] but
[1:05:57] was painting a picture that that church
[1:06:00] was so on point
[1:06:02] that they couldn't stand to bear them
[1:06:04] did
[1:06:05] which were evil he said they would throw
[1:06:08] them out
[1:06:09] they had a certain standard and and and
[1:06:12] this reminds me a bit
[1:06:14] of of you know what the bible say in
[1:06:16] isaiah i believe
[1:06:17] in in ezekiel sigh and cry for the
[1:06:20] abomination
[1:06:21] in other words some of us have become
[1:06:25] too tolerant of evil
[1:06:29] we have lost the sensitivity to what is
[1:06:32] wrong and what god hates
[1:06:34] because god was in this scripture giving
[1:06:38] credit
[1:06:38] to the fact that you can't bear them
[1:06:40] which are evil
[1:06:42] in other words you are resisting the
[1:06:44] evil we're not talking about
[1:06:46] be you know oppressive or disrespectful
[1:06:47] to people and throughout my house
[1:06:49] but it's an attitude it's a it's a
[1:06:51] mindset it's coming from the heart
[1:06:53] because you want to live a certain way
[1:06:56] you want to love the things that god
[1:06:57] loves
[1:06:58] and hear the things that god hates but
[1:07:00] for you to slide
[1:07:02] and fall back into the world it means
[1:07:04] you
[1:07:05] were not resisting
[1:07:08] this evil enough anybody with me tonight
[1:07:13] is this is this connecting to anybody
[1:07:17] let's continue and thou has tried them
[1:07:19] which say they are apostles
[1:07:21] and are not and has found them liars i
[1:07:23] like how the amplified brings this out
[1:07:30] and have listened and have tested one
[1:07:33] and critically appraised those who
[1:07:36] call themselves that's a distinction
[1:07:39] because people could call themselves
[1:07:41] anything
[1:07:43] call themselves apostles and in brackets
[1:07:45] the amplified
[1:07:46] clarifies what that means it means
[1:07:48] special messengers
[1:07:50] and personally chosen representatives of
[1:07:53] christ in other words
[1:07:54] in other words there are people that are
[1:07:56] going around saying they are the ones
[1:07:58] who are
[1:07:58] officially representing the kingdom that
[1:08:00] you can only go to that church
[1:08:02] or only listen to that pastor or is the
[1:08:04] person
[1:08:05] listen this this car fit into this
[1:08:08] sinner
[1:08:12] and and more than that tested and
[1:08:15] critically
[1:08:16] appraised brother branham said it sounds
[1:08:19] blunt
[1:08:20] to speak about it but he said the
[1:08:24] word has to test it you cannot be afraid
[1:08:26] to test
[1:08:27] if i'm saying something tonight that is
[1:08:29] out of scripture out to the world you
[1:08:31] must but if i don't give an order to
[1:08:32] to do it it gives a way to handle these
[1:08:35] things
[1:08:36] but i am not your absolute
[1:08:41] the absolute has been established as you
[1:08:43] were jesus christ is the absolute
[1:08:45] not listen carefully the way brother
[1:08:47] branham describe it he says
[1:08:48] the stars have no light of their own so
[1:08:51] even the star
[1:08:52] is not even the absolute the absolute is
[1:08:54] the light because it starts reflecting
[1:08:56] the light
[1:08:57] so the the light is the absolute the
[1:08:59] word is the absolute
[1:09:03] so no pasta could be the absolute
[1:09:07] only word is the absolute
[1:09:11] the only way the pastor could speak as
[1:09:14] absolute is if what he is saying
[1:09:16] is a perfect reflection of the light
[1:09:20] because that absolute has to be his
[1:09:22] absolute
[1:09:23] anybody with me now the only way
[1:09:27] you could test and critically appraise
[1:09:30] is you have to be a good student
[1:09:34] because you cannot test me or anybody or
[1:09:37] critically appraise me or anybody if you
[1:09:39] here said another good student
[1:09:43] but he's saying that listen to these
[1:09:45] description of the quality of the
[1:09:47] believers in that day
[1:09:49] and it's a challenge for us all to
[1:09:51] understand our day
[1:09:52] understand our message understand the
[1:09:55] purpose understand what god has fought
[1:09:56] for
[1:09:57] i know the works so they were not just
[1:09:59] doing works i know they are labor
[1:10:01] they were not just had labor and
[1:10:03] struggling and oppression and their
[1:10:04] patience
[1:10:05] and and not only did they withstand evil
[1:10:08] and couldn't bear evil
[1:10:09] but they tried them they brought a trial
[1:10:12] them would say they are apostles and
[1:10:15] they are not
[1:10:16] and has found them to be liars how can
[1:10:18] you find somebody to be a liar
[1:10:19] you have to bring it back by by the word
[1:10:22] this is not you walking wrong saying you
[1:10:23] lie
[1:10:24] you lie i believe it that is not what
[1:10:26] we're talking about here you know but
[1:10:28] the brandon made it clear
[1:10:29] it has to be by the wood so for you to
[1:10:32] try
[1:10:33] by the word test by the word you
[1:10:36] must become this word you must live this
[1:10:38] word
[1:10:39] you must know this word
[1:10:44] it is written it is written it is also
[1:10:47] written that is why these
[1:10:48] sessions are so important for us as
[1:10:50] believers and i'm saying for us
[1:10:53] because me spending time in this listen
[1:10:56] i am
[1:10:56] born and grew up in this message i just
[1:10:58] turned 40 years old i'm just as strong
[1:11:00] as i was when i was one
[1:11:01] but i feel like i'm seeing stuff in the
[1:11:05] message
[1:11:05] that that listen every day i read it's
[1:11:08] like a new thing you know
[1:11:10] and it's not that it's new but it's more
[1:11:12] light and it's in the prophet's message
[1:11:15] but the problem is people are not
[1:11:16] reading the bible they're not reading
[1:11:18] the prophet message
[1:11:19] they're not in his spirit you can't read
[1:11:21] it like a novel anything
[1:11:23] we read it last week you have to come
[1:11:25] here any spirit
[1:11:26] and when i show you look what happened
[1:11:28] in in germany look what happened in
[1:11:30] estonia look what happened in guinea
[1:11:32] look what happening in in all these
[1:11:33] different countries look what's
[1:11:34] happening here in trinidad
[1:11:35] and you want to trust and lean on your
[1:11:37] own understanding
[1:11:39] and lean on the government and lean on
[1:11:41] all these other things that's going on
[1:11:42] that
[1:11:42] crumbling rapidly you have to know how
[1:11:45] do i fit in
[1:11:46] in this great divine plan of god how is
[1:11:48] god going to use me as a piece of his
[1:11:50] divine strategy
[1:11:51] in this final great climax that is
[1:11:54] unfolding anybody with me
[1:11:56] i'm trying to finish this first thing
[1:11:59] before we close out tonight
[1:12:00] and i see in my clock racing a little
[1:12:02] bit so
[1:12:04] burst three so not only so so so
[1:12:08] so this is still called the the positive
[1:12:11] attributes of the age
[1:12:14] verse 3 and has born and has patience
[1:12:18] and for my namesake has labored and has
[1:12:21] not fainted
[1:12:22] i want to read it in the amplified and i
[1:12:24] know that you
[1:12:25] who believe do we have believers here
[1:12:28] tonight
[1:12:30] do we have any believers here in the
[1:12:31] house tonight
[1:12:33] so this is jesus himself speaking and
[1:12:35] you know what it is to be getting an
[1:12:37] appraiser from jesus
[1:12:40] because as we read last week this is the
[1:12:42] only book of you by the bible that's
[1:12:44] written this way
[1:12:45] where jesus is actually writing the
[1:12:47] bible through his scribe john
[1:12:50] and he's expressing himself to each age
[1:12:52] and to the messenger of each age
[1:12:54] and by the brand i'm saying this is not
[1:12:55] just to that age it's to all ages all
[1:12:57] right
[1:12:58] listen to verse three and i know that
[1:12:59] you who believe
[1:13:01] are enduring patiently let that be your
[1:13:04] testimony we are enduring
[1:13:06] peacefully we will not give up we will
[1:13:08] not backslide we will not
[1:13:09] become too far to turn back now i don't
[1:13:12] care what happens
[1:13:13] i don't care who leaves who jumped who
[1:13:15] danced it doesn't matter
[1:13:16] we are enduring patiently
[1:13:20] and if this is not that we'll keep this
[1:13:22] until that come but we know what we're
[1:13:24] looking towards
[1:13:26] because this ephesian church started on
[1:13:28] the day of pentecost
[1:13:30] hallelujah what they had but abraham
[1:13:32] taught us that the promise of the holy
[1:13:34] ghost the promise of power the promise
[1:13:35] of dynamics is just as real
[1:13:38] tonight it's just as real as on the day
[1:13:40] of pentecost and we are not accepting a
[1:13:42] substitute i'm not accepting an
[1:13:43] explanation
[1:13:44] and interpretation unfolding of some
[1:13:48] idea about it
[1:13:49] i want the real thing there's a real
[1:13:50] dollar i don't want to account with it
[1:13:53] my family has to come back that is the
[1:13:55] real thing come on now
[1:13:56] my house have to be delivered that's the
[1:13:58] real thing he said in blessing i would
[1:14:00] bless thee
[1:14:01] that's the abrahamic blessing and not
[1:14:03] accepting nothing less
[1:14:05] hallelujah wherever you put your foot is
[1:14:07] yours that he promises
[1:14:09] and these are the promises that by these
[1:14:11] promises
[1:14:12] we become partakers of his divine nature
[1:14:14] anybody with me
[1:14:15] tonight is this encouraging to your soul
[1:14:20] in every area of your life and and i
[1:14:22] wanted to
[1:14:23] i wanted i kind of went ahead there's
[1:14:25] something else i wanted to kind of just
[1:14:27] drop this in here
[1:14:29] i wanted to rewind a little bit because
[1:14:30] this this was important
[1:14:32] because this there are some super
[1:14:34] spiritual message believers
[1:14:36] who who i want to get this one to be
[1:14:38] super spiritual
[1:14:39] believers but i branham in addressing
[1:14:44] how god is unfolding this scripture he
[1:14:47] was saying the way god addressed it
[1:14:49] by identifying the positive first
[1:14:52] he said we could all learn a good lesson
[1:14:55] right here
[1:14:56] in running the church and our families
[1:14:59] i love that because many over the years
[1:15:02] in the
[1:15:03] message ruined their families by such
[1:15:06] abject legalism and a lack of spiritual
[1:15:08] understanding that was made clear by the
[1:15:11] prophet
[1:15:12] so he said this approach so how you
[1:15:14] approach somebody if you walk into
[1:15:16] somebody and they say
[1:15:17] you know you're wrong you're wrong
[1:15:18] you're wrong you're wrong how will that
[1:15:20] be effective god himself to operate so
[1:15:24] god took an approach he said i know your
[1:15:26] works he had
[1:15:27] all the positive thoughts before he was
[1:15:29] at address this is what you need to
[1:15:31] improve
[1:15:31] this is where i need to work on anybody
[1:15:33] with over with me i want to make the
[1:15:35] point
[1:15:36] but the brandon was dropping in here
[1:15:38] this is not just for churchill you say
[1:15:39] for your family
[1:15:41] i'm better still the prophet continued
[1:15:43] there still in ephesians 3 i'm reading
[1:15:45] we could all learn a good lesson in that
[1:15:47] god deals
[1:15:48] with each one of us in exactly this way
[1:15:51] so don't ever be discouraged
[1:15:52] saint of god for god is not on gracious
[1:15:55] to forget your labors of love
[1:15:57] whatever we do even giving a cup of cold
[1:16:00] water to someone
[1:16:01] has a reward and a blessing from the
[1:16:03] lord
[1:16:04] don't lose these simple things don't
[1:16:08] lose these simple
[1:16:09] aspects of our christianity of our
[1:16:10] experience because christianity is not
[1:16:13] it's not about a doctrine and a belief
[1:16:14] on a connection it's about living
[1:16:16] something
[1:16:17] we talk about to be like jesus we want
[1:16:19] to be like him
[1:16:20] we want to live like him we want to
[1:16:22] operate in his way all right
[1:16:24] so again i know that you who believe are
[1:16:28] enduring
[1:16:29] patiently and are bearing up for my
[1:16:32] name's sake
[1:16:33] not the church sikh not the pastor seek
[1:16:37] it is for his name sake you know i want
[1:16:40] to be clear on this
[1:16:41] if you don't have the anger and the
[1:16:43] reason because
[1:16:44] if there's anything else outside of his
[1:16:46] name's sake when the wind blows your
[1:16:48] backslide
[1:16:50] when the wind blows your walkery message
[1:16:52] when you win blows you give up
[1:16:53] when you build it you say you can't
[1:16:54] believe because your faith was resting
[1:16:56] on the man he was doing it for man's
[1:17:00] sake
[1:17:02] all right and i know you who believe i'm
[1:17:04] anniversary
[1:17:05] are enduring patiently and are bearing
[1:17:08] up for my name's sake
[1:17:09] and that you have not grown wary of
[1:17:11] being faithful to the truth
[1:17:16] i cannot be wary of being faithful to
[1:17:18] the truth
[1:17:19] all right so let's go on verse four
[1:17:23] nevertheless so now this is where
[1:17:26] this is where he's starting to address
[1:17:28] the issue
[1:17:30] the issue nevertheless in other words
[1:17:33] after i've said all that i've said
[1:17:35] after i've spoken about all your efforts
[1:17:37] after i've spoken about how long in your
[1:17:39] message
[1:17:40] and what you have done and how many
[1:17:41] testimonies you gave and how much time
[1:17:43] you share and how many books you're
[1:17:45] handed out
[1:17:45] and how long you believe and how you
[1:17:47] fight for defeat and how you contended
[1:17:49] for
[1:17:49] after you do all of that nevertheless
[1:17:53] you're still standing we we are jubilant
[1:17:56] about that
[1:17:56] that will not be forgotten it will be
[1:17:58] rewarded but nevertheless i have
[1:18:00] somewhat against thee
[1:18:02] because thou has left my first love
[1:18:07] so this is where jesus now begin to
[1:18:09] address the issue
[1:18:11] and by the branham tied it into he said
[1:18:13] the fervent desire to please god
[1:18:19] not a desire to please god or no a
[1:18:21] full-on desire
[1:18:22] he qualified the desire to please god
[1:18:26] not please your wife not please your
[1:18:29] husband not please the church
[1:18:31] not please your boss not please your
[1:18:33] plan not please your expedition
[1:18:34] a fervent desire to please god a passion
[1:18:38] the person to know his word
[1:18:40] this is in the ephesians tradition i'm
[1:18:41] reading the cry for reaching out in the
[1:18:44] spirit
[1:18:45] all begins to feed that is the issue
[1:18:47] that started in that church in ephesus
[1:18:53] and instead of the church being on fire
[1:18:55] with the fire of god
[1:18:57] it has cooled off and become a bit
[1:18:59] formal
[1:19:01] people sit on there they come to church
[1:19:03] today they any message they
[1:19:05] they they know they read church they
[1:19:06] read seven seals they they
[1:19:08] they're reading mysteries mysterious
[1:19:10] mysterious people
[1:19:11] royal priesthood and and and and there's
[1:19:14] no further desire to please god
[1:19:17] there's no passion to know his word
[1:19:20] there's no cry to be in the spirit
[1:19:22] reaching out in the spirit no praise no
[1:19:25] worship
[1:19:26] it become formal formal means it's
[1:19:28] planned it's expected
[1:19:30] it's it's set up a certain way it's it's
[1:19:33] it's a routine
[1:19:37] that was the issue that was there but
[1:19:41] that is what was happening back there to
[1:19:42] the ephesians they were getting a bit
[1:19:44] formal
[1:19:46] the abandoned men to god was dying out
[1:19:52] and the people weren't too careful about
[1:19:55] what god taught of them
[1:19:56] as they began to be careful about what
[1:19:59] the world taught of them
[1:20:01] are we guilty of this tonight where we
[1:20:04] we're not really worried about what god
[1:20:06] said about it but we're more concerned
[1:20:07] about what the co-workers say
[1:20:09] or what somebody else say this was what
[1:20:13] was
[1:20:13] creeping in creeping in
[1:20:17] but ibrahim said to understand this you
[1:20:19] must realize that the spirit is not
[1:20:21] speaking
[1:20:21] to the original saints of ephesus alone
[1:20:26] so it's a challenger cry to us tonight
[1:20:29] have you
[1:20:30] left your first love
[1:20:35] is the fervent desire to please god
[1:20:37] there
[1:20:39] i've seen people sit down any message
[1:20:41] for years and this happens happen
[1:20:43] and they become so disenchanted
[1:20:46] there are no quotes there are no tapes
[1:20:47] they know this
[1:20:49] and some sit in moses seat they could
[1:20:51] mark everybody papers this one's wrong
[1:20:53] this one's wrong
[1:20:54] and your own life your own desire to
[1:20:57] please god is not there
[1:20:58] you know which church doing it this way
[1:21:00] you know which pastor of the world you
[1:21:01] know this
[1:21:02] this is this is this but you as an
[1:21:04] individual because
[1:21:05] this is that age of individuals nowhere
[1:21:08] i'm taking present tense i'm speaking to
[1:21:10] you i'm speaking to me i have to look at
[1:21:12] myself tonight
[1:21:14] is what is my desire like do i have a
[1:21:17] full-on desire
[1:21:18] to please god am i concerned if god is
[1:21:21] pleased
[1:21:22] is it important to me if god is pleased
[1:21:26] is he pleased is he pleased with how i
[1:21:29] live today
[1:21:30] is he pleased with what i did how i how
[1:21:32] i spoke today
[1:21:33] yesterday are my plans pleasing to god
[1:21:38] is my attitude pleasing to god is my
[1:21:40] approach
[1:21:41] pleasing to god because the moment
[1:21:45] that loses its importance then that is
[1:21:48] the sign of
[1:21:49] moving away from your first love
[1:21:55] that first love that that first love
[1:21:57] that spark of
[1:21:58] relationship that exists at that point
[1:22:01] where
[1:22:02] everything that is important to god is
[1:22:04] your
[1:22:05] is your priority
[1:22:08] people who came to the message years ago
[1:22:10] that was eminent
[1:22:11] they hunted for books when last you read
[1:22:13] a book
[1:22:16] unless you sat down with a book and said
[1:22:18] wait a minute let me sit down and read a
[1:22:19] book
[1:22:20] not watching news
[1:22:23] not taking politics passion to know his
[1:22:27] word
[1:22:27] not to know his word or uh okay so we
[1:22:30] thankful for the unfolding of the word
[1:22:32] in this way but you have a personal
[1:22:34] passion
[1:22:34] so you're not waiting for a bible study
[1:22:36] you're not waiting for a sunday service
[1:22:37] you're not waiting to hear tape
[1:22:39] you hunting for yourself because you
[1:22:40] want to find you you want to know your
[1:22:43] scriptures
[1:22:43] anybody anybody with meat tonight
[1:22:46] i want this to resonate because the
[1:22:48] revival has to start with you
[1:22:52] do you ever start in your home
[1:22:55] you should have a prayer meeting every
[1:22:57] single night
[1:23:00] friday is corporate prayers the whole
[1:23:02] church is coming together but
[1:23:03] but that is just on top that is like
[1:23:05] icing on top of the cake but you have
[1:23:06] cake
[1:23:09] the friday break everything covered your
[1:23:10] whole prayer life
[1:23:13] the bible said it could be your whole
[1:23:14] bible study is this is this the only
[1:23:16] effort
[1:23:19] because passion and fervent when i see
[1:23:21] somebody passionate about something
[1:23:23] fulfilled about something
[1:23:26] there's a certain attitude you know you
[1:23:28] can't wait to do something
[1:23:30] i remember years ago i was in school and
[1:23:33] i had this little computer game
[1:23:34] in primary school and listen whole time
[1:23:37] in school there
[1:23:38] thank god i was a good student but i
[1:23:40] couldn't wait to get home to play the
[1:23:42] game
[1:23:44] i couldn't wait to get home i just
[1:23:46] couldn't wait to get home the moment
[1:23:47] school done
[1:23:48] is and i was living close to school
[1:23:51] straight for the computer
[1:23:53] and that game you can stay there for
[1:23:54] hours and hours playing
[1:23:59] you didn't have to tell me to go and
[1:24:00] play the game
[1:24:02] my parents say isaac you want to go play
[1:24:04] the game you'd have to encourage me
[1:24:06] i want to do it i was having a good time
[1:24:09] playing the game
[1:24:14] you have to remind me to do it ask my
[1:24:17] dad
[1:24:18] ask my mom books i love reading
[1:24:22] when i was a kid they had to come in
[1:24:24] room two o'clock in the morning isaac
[1:24:25] take off you lie go and sleep
[1:24:28] you have school in the morning take all
[1:24:30] the light go and sleep
[1:24:34] it was a passion
[1:24:38] to read in general ashamed my own
[1:24:41] testimony
[1:24:42] until there was a book so i i think i
[1:24:45] shared last week i was 12 years old when
[1:24:46] i read the two changes
[1:24:48] it wasn't i was at the time i wasn't
[1:24:50] trying to read it to its ages you know
[1:24:51] there was a book i wanted to read
[1:24:54] and my dad said you're not reading that
[1:24:56] book until you read it ages
[1:25:01] so are ready for changes because i
[1:25:03] wanted to read the next book
[1:25:07] and i thank god he had the wisdom to
[1:25:10] unfold
[1:25:10] that way because certain things at age
[1:25:12] 12 stuck with me
[1:25:16] but the point is when you're passionate
[1:25:18] about something
[1:25:20] it makes you operate a certain way
[1:25:24] and all of us we know the things we're
[1:25:26] excited about sports the news the
[1:25:28] politics
[1:25:29] during this last election here that
[1:25:31] unfold in the u.s and that people in
[1:25:33] trinidad more glued to the news that
[1:25:34] people in the united states
[1:25:37] it had more political analysts i'm sure
[1:25:39] in trinidad and in the united states
[1:25:42] not just any natural not even any
[1:25:43] message
[1:25:46] and the amount of time they spent
[1:25:47] analyzing the vote and the electoral
[1:25:49] college
[1:25:51] if they had spent that time reading the
[1:25:53] church it is again
[1:25:54] reading the seals again reading
[1:25:57] why we are so tossed about
[1:26:01] reading letting all the pressure they
[1:26:04] will be under
[1:26:05] much less pressure tonight
[1:26:08] but it's a passion
[1:26:12] so i want us as we explore this because
[1:26:14] we can't get it all true tonight but i
[1:26:16] want you to see
[1:26:17] how easy it is to slip away and it
[1:26:19] becomes casual and this is what the
[1:26:20] prophet is painting
[1:26:22] of what took place it became casual it
[1:26:24] become well tomorrow's situation is a
[1:26:26] live stream service so we just
[1:26:28] connect and then friday's prayer meeting
[1:26:29] and it becomes it becomes a routine
[1:26:31] because a pattern
[1:26:33] and you lose the sincerity of a fool
[1:26:35] desire to please god
[1:26:36] the passion to know his word the cry for
[1:26:39] reaching out in your spirit
[1:26:41] don't let it fade friends
[1:26:44] but abandon that is the history of the
[1:26:45] church when it thinks more of conformity
[1:26:48] to the world instead of conforming to
[1:26:49] god
[1:26:50] it isn't long until you see them stop
[1:26:52] doing things they used to do
[1:26:55] and start doing things they did they
[1:26:56] wouldn't do initially
[1:26:58] they changed their manner of dress so
[1:27:00] with a brand i'm going deeper and if
[1:27:01] he's a church age on they're falling
[1:27:03] away
[1:27:04] their attitude and their behavior they
[1:27:06] get lacks
[1:27:07] that is what it means relax drifting the
[1:27:10] cycle of revival of
[1:27:12] amber abandon goes on i can't get into
[1:27:13] all of it tonight but i want us to see
[1:27:16] that what took place in that age is
[1:27:18] unfolding even in our age
[1:27:21] and especially as we come into the end
[1:27:23] that's why we're seeing a great falling
[1:27:24] away
[1:27:25] because people have gotten tired and
[1:27:26] they got frustrated and this brother do
[1:27:28] this and then and
[1:27:29] because they're looking at man so much
[1:27:31] they now judge their behavior and they
[1:27:33] conduct well
[1:27:34] if brothers so and so could do it and if
[1:27:36] sisters so and so could do it well who
[1:27:37] is me
[1:27:40] and we have a word template to match let
[1:27:43] me try to close off here listen to verse
[1:27:46] five
[1:27:47] remember therefore from whence though
[1:27:49] i've fallen
[1:27:51] that is powerful in the amplified it is
[1:27:55] to remember the heights
[1:27:56] from which you have fallen
[1:27:59] that's powerful enough you and and
[1:28:02] listen this is not just contextual
[1:28:04] for your own personal experience you
[1:28:06] know the heights
[1:28:08] for us in our day is going back to the
[1:28:10] days of the prophet being here
[1:28:12] and the magnitude of the world and power
[1:28:14] being expressed and the clarity
[1:28:16] of it being expressed and to see how
[1:28:18] cheese have fallen
[1:28:19] from the absolute and the plum line that
[1:28:22] the prophet laid up
[1:28:23] that is a heights
[1:28:26] and we can look even further back to the
[1:28:28] height and they are pentecost
[1:28:31] it is not god's fault you know come on
[1:28:33] now
[1:28:34] it is not god's fault what has
[1:28:36] transpired it is man
[1:28:38] who gets in the way for their own agenda
[1:28:41] remember
[1:28:42] therefore from when they were fallen and
[1:28:43] repent
[1:28:46] so even here we're seeing the
[1:28:47] opportunity the space of grace being
[1:28:50] unfolded
[1:28:50] that there's a way to get back
[1:28:53] hallelujah
[1:28:54] there's an opportunity to get back
[1:28:57] there's an approach to get back repent
[1:28:59] and do the first works
[1:29:01] repent and do the first work doesn't it
[1:29:02] song like cain and abel
[1:29:05] does this song like if you do what your
[1:29:06] brother do does this song there is a
[1:29:08] right wing to do things
[1:29:09] and if there's a right way why would he
[1:29:11] do something else
[1:29:15] or else so he gives a condition so
[1:29:18] remember therefore from when someone had
[1:29:19] fallen in the amplifier they say
[1:29:21] remember the height so make sure i fall
[1:29:23] and repent
[1:29:24] listen to the amplified change your
[1:29:25] inner self your own way of thinking
[1:29:28] your sinful behavior seek god's will
[1:29:30] that's i'm really amplified
[1:29:32] can i read that one more time so
[1:29:35] remember the heights on which you have
[1:29:37] fallen and repent
[1:29:38] and it says change your inner self this
[1:29:41] is not change your wife
[1:29:42] change your child change your pastor
[1:29:44] changing church this is you i'm speaking
[1:29:46] to individuals looking at me tonight
[1:29:49] i think two weeks ago i preached if you
[1:29:51] have such a situation with your children
[1:29:54] it is far easier to pray for the
[1:29:56] strength to deal with it
[1:29:59] for god to change your perspective of it
[1:30:02] because ultimately you don't have the
[1:30:04] power to change them
[1:30:07] but god could change you he could deal
[1:30:10] with them
[1:30:11] you can change your children god is the
[1:30:13] one to change them
[1:30:16] but your inner self how you approach
[1:30:19] things
[1:30:20] how you process things how you analyze
[1:30:23] things
[1:30:24] and the curse that has been impacting so
[1:30:26] many of us where people have influenced
[1:30:28] our thinking
[1:30:29] and it hasn't been god influenced in our
[1:30:31] thinking
[1:30:33] anybody with me so change your inner
[1:30:35] self
[1:30:36] your old way of thinking your sinful
[1:30:39] behavior seek god's will
[1:30:40] and do the works you did at first when
[1:30:43] you first knew me
[1:30:44] otherwise i will visit you and remove
[1:30:47] your lampstand
[1:30:49] the church is impact from its place
[1:30:51] unless you repent
[1:30:53] any kingdom version or else i will come
[1:30:55] unto me quickly and
[1:30:57] removed i cannot stick out of its place
[1:30:59] except thou
[1:31:00] repent verse six i can't go into this
[1:31:04] too much tonight we'll touch it some of
[1:31:05] the time
[1:31:06] but this thou hast once again and this
[1:31:09] is perfect this is
[1:31:10] this is the the mind of god unfolding
[1:31:15] one time i was in a company training and
[1:31:17] they were saying managers
[1:31:18] say something good deal with the issue
[1:31:20] come back and close it with something
[1:31:21] good
[1:31:22] after verse five jesus come up but this
[1:31:26] thou has in other words this is what is
[1:31:28] is working for you
[1:31:30] this in the amplifier say yet you have
[1:31:32] this to your credit
[1:31:33] that you hate the works and corrupt
[1:31:36] teachings of the nicolaitans
[1:31:38] that mislead and delude people which i
[1:31:42] also hate
[1:31:44] so the ephesus chief had a lot working
[1:31:46] for them
[1:31:47] this thou hast that now hated the deeds
[1:31:49] of manipulator which i also hate
[1:31:50] and very quickly what is this these are
[1:31:52] the nicolaitans was
[1:31:54] nikko let it control any people
[1:31:57] having a sense of control over the
[1:31:59] people in the context of the church
[1:32:02] this is my church this is this is my
[1:32:03] people and and locking on the people as
[1:32:05] if they belong to the man
[1:32:08] power being placed under the mind that
[1:32:09] he now becomes an intimate area with god
[1:32:11] nothing we have read place any man
[1:32:14] between you and god here
[1:32:18] it doesn't even place it doesn't even
[1:32:20] place the prophet between you and god
[1:32:21] because he's reflecting the light the
[1:32:23] light that you didn't have access to
[1:32:25] was brought close to you because you
[1:32:26] took a star to bring the light into your
[1:32:28] view
[1:32:29] come on now the star reflected in the
[1:32:32] light of the sun
[1:32:33] but you didn't have the eyesight come on
[1:32:36] now
[1:32:36] to see that sun so god put now a
[1:32:39] reflector
[1:32:40] is like you have a router in your house
[1:32:42] and you want a repeater so that the
[1:32:44] connection could reach you
[1:32:45] we were so far from god hallelujah
[1:32:48] nothing we could have ever done could
[1:32:49] have seen him in his glory
[1:32:50] but he said a star to reflect his light
[1:32:53] so when we see the star we can see him
[1:32:56] no wonder poor could say follow me as i
[1:32:58] follow christ he was a perfect
[1:33:00] reflection
[1:33:01] of the light of the sun
[1:33:04] and he went about a man a priest a
[1:33:06] bishop a pope
[1:33:08] over would say a message folk
[1:33:10] [Laughter]
[1:33:12] between me and and
[1:33:15] my son the son itself
[1:33:19] hallelujah the days of iniquiton trying
[1:33:23] to manipulate the people
[1:33:25] trying to control the people don't
[1:33:26] listen to this one don't listen to that
[1:33:28] one
[1:33:28] listen you can listen to who you want
[1:33:31] because
[1:33:31] if you have to test and try and rebuke
[1:33:34] and bind
[1:33:34] and destroy the works of darkness it
[1:33:36] doesn't matter what
[1:33:38] what you hear if you are grounded in the
[1:33:39] word you could send strappiness from
[1:33:41] what is true
[1:33:43] i can teach you every counterfeit but if
[1:33:45] you know what the word is and you know
[1:33:46] you could try any apostle any preacher
[1:33:48] any believer anything they bring to you
[1:33:50] could try it by the word
[1:33:52] anybody with me
[1:33:55] hallelujah my
[1:33:59] my my my mind but occurrence how much
[1:34:02] preachers i heard and i'm listening
[1:34:03] i listened with with my bored ears open
[1:34:07] i said it in any church i said any
[1:34:08] pulpit i said hey brother albert
[1:34:10] preached something wrong
[1:34:11] there's an order you know you better the
[1:34:13] prophet said take him in the office
[1:34:17] quotes pull this scripture say it nicely
[1:34:19] to him
[1:34:20] we could discuss it if that carries up
[1:34:22] there then it have ways to escalate it
[1:34:25] but i am too concerned about my first
[1:34:27] love
[1:34:28] to let family get into the way to let
[1:34:30] church get in the way
[1:34:32] this first love is important we are not
[1:34:34] robots you know we are spiritual beings
[1:34:37] trapped in time here to destroy the
[1:34:39] works of darkness
[1:34:40] these are small trials around us because
[1:34:42] we have a big devil to fight
[1:34:44] and a dragon that we're gonna contend
[1:34:45] with as oh come on now
[1:34:47] anybody with me tonight sickness will be
[1:34:51] placed under your feet
[1:34:52] believe it hallelujah depression will be
[1:34:55] under your feet
[1:34:56] every circumstance will be under your
[1:34:58] feet i'm speaking the sons of god
[1:35:01] hallelujah let me close off here but
[1:35:04] this dalhasta though
[1:35:05] hates the deeds of the unique leader
[1:35:07] which i also hate
[1:35:09] remember you said you loved eating god
[1:35:10] love you hear the thing god hit
[1:35:13] hallelujah last verse he that had an ear
[1:35:18] hallelujah just that verse alone that
[1:35:21] peace the heathen hat and ear
[1:35:23] speaks to the fact that it's not it is
[1:35:24] not it is not just the physical air you
[1:35:26] know
[1:35:27] because it had people who they listen
[1:35:30] you ever hear or people say it going
[1:35:32] through morning and comedy next year
[1:35:37] but but it's spiritual years now he that
[1:35:40] had an air
[1:35:41] let him hear what his spirit saying unto
[1:35:44] the churches
[1:35:45] and then he leaves now in perfect hr
[1:35:49] in perfect order this is the goal now
[1:35:52] know that to tell you what you're doing
[1:35:53] good now that i tell you what you need
[1:35:55] to fix
[1:35:56] now i tell you what i like again about
[1:35:58] your work now let me give you the
[1:35:59] challenge
[1:36:00] this is what you need to work on to him
[1:36:02] that overcome it
[1:36:03] i've given you a target now will i give
[1:36:06] to eat of the tree of life
[1:36:08] which is an of the paradise of god and
[1:36:10] by the random typed out perfectly that a
[1:36:12] tree of life is jesus christ himself
[1:36:14] he plays the two trees there in the
[1:36:16] garden of eden he said one was christ
[1:36:18] one was satan and he spoke about the
[1:36:20] whole plan
[1:36:21] and it's only any word we know this and
[1:36:23] if you don't know it get into the world
[1:36:25] because we're going to go deeper and
[1:36:26] deeper into it but i want you to see
[1:36:28] yourself see the word see how much god
[1:36:30] loves
[1:36:31] us to look beyond our faults and put all
[1:36:34] these things here for us that we can
[1:36:36] grow into this stature
[1:36:37] and that he tutor himself the holy ghost
[1:36:39] could watch our conduct
[1:36:40] and most importantly the response to
[1:36:43] this word
[1:36:43] i will leave you with this tonight if
[1:36:46] you find yourself tonight
[1:36:48] not where your first love is not where
[1:36:51] you are supposed to be not where you
[1:36:53] were before
[1:36:54] and you know you were praying
[1:36:56] differently studying differently
[1:36:58] your joy used to be a different kind of
[1:37:00] joy when you walk into service when you
[1:37:02] hear tape
[1:37:03] it's presence it's not it's not it's not
[1:37:05] semantics
[1:37:06] and i'm trying to convince you of what
[1:37:08] you don't believe and you don't know
[1:37:10] listen this is real we too close to the
[1:37:11] finish line

[1:37:14] gospel is real
[1:37:16] it is truth it is life-changing we will
[1:37:19] not tolerate
[1:37:20] anything less than every promise that
[1:37:22] was brought to us
[1:37:24] by scripture as the written word and
[1:37:26] revealed to us
[1:37:27] by the shining light the reflection of

[1:39:10] in a space of crying to be in the spirit
[1:39:13] not an intellectual conception of the
[1:39:15] message
[1:39:16] but the reality that this gospel is not
[1:39:18] in word only but this is in power and
[1:39:20] demonstration
[1:39:21] may you bless your people if there's
[1:39:23] anyone sick tonight if there's any one
[1:39:25] lord struggling tonight
[1:39:26] may you heal your people may you touch
[1:39:28] the people may you baptize with the holy
[1:39:30] ghost may you restore the joy
[1:39:31] of people may you encourage your people
[1:39:33] tonight we commit your church into your
[1:39:35] hands
[1:39:35] in the precious name of jesus christ
[1:39:37] amen and amen and amen
[1:39:40] may the lord richly bless you tonight
[1:39:42] service continues tomorrow night
[1:39:44] at 8pm live stream service only be under
[1:39:47] great expectation
[1:39:48] so i believe tonight your passion would
[1:39:50] have increased so so nobody need to
[1:39:51] remind you about the apm service
[1:39:53] tomorrow night and there's prayer
[1:39:54] meeting on friday
[1:39:55] and they can't wait for the primitive
[1:39:57] but even between there you have your own
[1:39:59] prayer altar you have your own time
[1:40:01] you're pushing to be horned and shaped
[1:40:04] into that masterpiece
[1:40:05] me the lord which we bless you love you
[1:40:07] god bless you tonight
