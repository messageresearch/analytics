your wood lord it is your word that unites us it is your word that keeps us it is your word that guides us it's lord your word is the source lord for understanding your mind lord and father we are so grateful lord that we have the written word and lord we are even more grateful to have access to the revealed word that lord that put light on this word lord that we could read it and we could have a bible study and we could lord know the hidden things lord that you have been unfolding lord from the beginning of time lord to this present day lord and even until the consummation lord even until the ending of all things to know where we come from to understand our history to understand our destiny to understand where we come from to understand where we're going and to understand how everything fits together the pieces of the puzzle of our lives lord that lord you allowed it in so many ways lord lord like the potter lord and working with the clay lord to bring the image lord interview that you have in mind lord you sometimes have to break that vessel and put it back on the potter's wheel for the lore to shape and mold it into the image that you have in store and you have planned and lord you have envisioned lord and lord sometimes through these situations in our lives lord it is past our understanding lord at a point in time that we're going through something lord most times if not almost all times lord it doesn't make much sense lord and we struggle through the experiences with our fate and a confidence that there's a bigger plan than what we could understand so we thank you lord the lord because we have seen a true scripture in so many ways of that bigger plan that greater purpose lord the things that lord you don't allow us to see the things that you prevent us from seeing lord because lord sometimes it could do even more damage but lord in your great plan lord you bring us to a spot farther away lord we can look back and see it's been you all along guiding direct and leading us so we thank you for this message of this our lord and sometimes the situations of life could lord work in harmony as it were or to to distract to try to weaken but father we come tonight lord for our faith to be restored and for our strength and lord to get an encouragement to get a word even if it's just one word tonight even if it's just one word from you lord it's enough that we hear your voice and to know your thoughts on different matters lord so father as we are in this first session of this month of march lord it's something else to see how rapidly time is moving to think it's about a year that the world has already been dealing with this thing this pandemic as it were and lord no one could have envisioned how it would have unfolded but lord to see where we are at now and to see lord everything that's taking place lord we thank you for keeping us we thank you for strengthening us we thank you for lord reviving us we thank you for lord giving us the charge when we need to charge so lord may you bless each one tonight that lord made that sacrifice make the effort that commitment lord to be in this room report for duty as it were there are so many things that we could find ourselves doing there are so many ideas we can have about our time and how to spend it and how to use it and what is important or not important but lord uh give you lord the preeminence in our lives to put you first lord and to trust lord trust you that lord knowing that you are god that keeps your word lord you said if we put you first he said seek you first the kingdom of god lord and we want to put you first in our affairs put you first in our lives put you first in our marriages put you first in our businesses put you first in our careers lord and in everything that we do and even in this first week of this month where we have lord of prayer and fastest coming friday lord we want this week to be a week of reflection a week of introspection a week where we pause to look at the word to look at our lives and to do our own analysis as it were law to do our own evaluation the script of evaluation has been made clear lord god that you said that if we love you we would keep your commandments so we don't want to be guilty tonight lord of not keeping your commandments lord even the least of them we want to keep them father because it's important it's important that we keep your commandments that we keep your word that we guard it in our hearts lord we protect it with all that we have despite the pressures despite the stresses despite the situations that we may want to fly off the handle and lose control as it were lord we want to be very careful now no more than ever lord when we see the closing pages as it were of time as we blend into eternity have your preeminence tonight if there's someone that's backslidden tonight lord may they be shaken back into reality may this be lord of study tonight of repentance oh lord father may you take it in a certain kind of a way lord that lives could be restored this journey that we're on of this great restoration of fallen man lord back to his condition father lord the condition he was lord the adamic condition before the fall lord it's a it's a ministry of reconciliation a ministry of restoration a mystery of putting pieces back together lord you don't like broken families you don't like broken situations you don't like broken things lord when things are broken it's in your nature to see the pieces come back together so father may you bring the pieces together of our lives lord the pieces lord of our relationship with you lord that we have fallen aside lord we want to come back home come back to lord across come back to basics come back to first principles lord lord sometimes you get so caught up in lord the understanding and the knowledge and the revelation at times that we miss the first principles lord and lord the bible will say the first love that that first contact that first experience with you lord bring us back to basics father lord because it's the foundation that would last lord and may we rebuild upon that solid foundation lord build it the right way so we commit the teaching tonight into your hands we commend the fellowship into your hands may you bless your people lord if there's anyone sick may they be healed anyone wanting to hear direct from you speak to them take me out of the way lord use me as your microphone that you could speak lip to ear to your sons and your daughters lord even the little ones who may be connected lord and lord in their homes in their ways lord may this be lord of spiritual time in our homes and in our families we commit the meeting into your hands in the precious theme of jesus christ amen and amen and amen certainly a great privilege to be here tonight uh one more time uh in the presence of god and in the fellowship of the brethren around his word uh in these bible studies that have served to be somewhat of a a supplement or a vitamin as it were an encouragement um during the week uh you know so that we can keep pressing you know during the week and break this this sometimes this this this this formality of of of just sunday service and and wednesday service and these things so that we could have more contacts and we are also fulfilling scripture that even as the approaches we meeting more frequently we may not be doing it physically but we are still meeting using the the technology and and using the the system that we have and and these things so so we thank god for his love we thank god for his mercy we thank god for providing for us uh for keeping us for protecting us or watching over us uh he is very interested in everything about us that's his nature and uh sometimes even when we don't understand it um it's not for us to always understand at that particular point in time but things are made clear to us you know as time unfolds so we trust uh that you are doing well and that you are fighting the fight i was fellowshipping with a couple brothers after service on sunday and i asked a few brothers is is is the fire hot and heavy you know is he trials hot and heavy because every trial is not hot and heavy you need to talk to me because you know the trials not hot and heavy then something wrong you know so if these trials are hot and heavy that is a good thing you know so it means that the devil don't have you you know he's trying to get you he's trying to to mash up you know so once you feel the heat and the intensity of the trials then you know the devil you're never trying all that he can but you know what is so wonderful about the god we serve he put a seed in us that cannot give up that that cannot that cannot backslide that creator is he that's in you and he that's in the world and there's a joy in you that sometimes you don't even realize in you you know uh there's a piece in you that that somehow you don't realize in you it's locked up in the seed in that seed in the the genetic code you know of that germ of life in you has everything to reproduce itself you know that's a that is a first principle you know that's a genesis type principle you know every sea will bring forth it's kind and we thank god that it was not our ability or our strength or our merit or our efforts that put that seed in us but is a seed of perfection it's a seed of predestination and but a random typed predestination to an engagement ring a promissory ring you know so he put that seed in there and put in that sea the ability for that seat to take care of itself hallelujah in that sea that seed that sea don't need your help to take care of itself that seed is strong enough to withstand all kind of stuff uh all kind of stuff and sometime in the most messed up of conditions the same way you want to use manure and use a certain environment for these seeds sometimes the more messed up things get that seed actually begin to start to to thrive and no wonder the bible could say his strength is made perfect in our weakness his strength is made perfect when when our strength is not is gone and we have no strength to carry on that's when he relishes the opportunity to show himself and to make himself known to us you know after we have gone through the test you know so we are in a testing time friends we are being tested every day it's not like oh levels and and cxc and uncommon engines where you have a one day you know a few days of exams and and then you're waiting for the results this is a daily test and their daily results because you know at the end of the day how you did you know nobody had to come and mark your papers you know if you lost control you know if you know what you do you you can mark your own papers you know because the word is there your tutor is in force in action you know if you give up you know if you have joy you know if you pray this morning you know if you really would i don't have to come to your house and if you really would or if you pray but it's a test every day to see if you would put god first if you would acknowledge him in all your ways so that he could direct your paths you know and it's it's like i i'm back to basics calling him first principles the first principle of something is a is a foundational teaching a foundational concept that when all else is is moving around he can hold on to this first principle and know that that anchor holes you know and and if it's anything you hold on to tonight is that seed word has the power to take care of itself you know under any circumstance on any situation that seed will take care of itself so tonight by the grace of god i don't uh have a plan to be too long with you tonight i'm trusting god that we could bring this uh little thing that we have been on for the last two weeks to uh i would say somewhat off for close um by the grace of god i i i thank god that i've been able to to to you know make it to this point with this sometimes i've had experiences in the past where i had a part one and part two still coming but um we we are here tonight on a study of joseph part three uh the conclusion of this study and i trust it's been a blessing to you and i trust that in some way you would have seen over the last two weeks something you may not have seen before and if you did see it uh uh that it's a reminder to you you know of of so many issues of life because this story that we have been on is a story of love it's a story of restoration and india has betrayal india has hardship in there has struggles in there has has coming to to no oneself in there has the the whole experience of knowing who is for you and who's who's not for you uh india is the attitude and the resilience of survival in the in the face of hardship india is adapting to change and circumstances and situations and not curling up in the fetal position and saying god will love me anymore you know we would have gone through this whole journey from a young joseph as it were 17 years old you know and i want you to think back to when you were 17 years old you know what kind of person were you when you were 17 years old for some of us even five years ago we have made a major improvement you know but going back to when we were 17 years old and to see how we were and how we acted and how we live and to see this young boy not just confronted with a rough situation but in a different land a different language a different situation a different culture to see how he was able to thrive in the midst of that because of god we we went through that and it was very clear in scripture that god's hand was upon him and if you for a minute don't realize that god's hand is upon you you need to look back at the pages of your life one more time and go back to your genesis go back to your first few pages and to see in the midst of all that you've been through has been god keeping you god protecting you god's hand is upon you and if we are to take one lesson um from this it's to acknowledge god more for what he has done he loves to be acknowledged he loves to get the credit he doesn't like to share credit with anybody so it's not your ability it's not your strength it's not your knowledge it's not your insight it's not your hard work you know that is foundational for his principles you know it's not your effort sometimes he says me and you're pushing and you're doing and you're doing and you're doing and realizing that you can't do if god not with you you can't act if god not with you you can't live if god is not with you you know so i want to really encourage you to keep on pressing and to keep your feet high and don't let any situation because trust me it will come but don't let any situation uh throw you off so we would have reached that point where uh you know the the the joseph's brothers as it were would have come down uh into egypt and they didn't recognize joseph they didn't know who joseph was and joseph when he realized who they were he really began call it a series of testing you know um many times we don't you know express it in that kind of way but really what joseph was doing was testing them you know testing them to see if they had changed there is nothing to suggest that joseph's heart had any animosity there was nothing to suggest that in his heart was anger or enmity or a desire for revenge you know there was there was no evidence of him trying to hurt them to meme them uh looking at the holy scripture unfolded what we saw was not someone who was locked up with pent up rage and anger but we saw that there was a hoot there was a cry we we found two instances where he broke down and he did so in secret he did so quietly he did so away from the crowd uh so as not to to show how he felt about the to see that that there are issues in our lives that has a sensitive touch to it and we try to manage it as best we can but test nonetheless the test was there you know to test to see if these same brothers who had hurt him had changed you know and anytime we speak about change what we're really talking about is repentance we need to understand that the word chin in scriptural context and in this context is really repentance because to really repent or to repent is about not just a change of thinking it's a change of behavior it needs to translate all the way to a change of behavior you know a lot of people they come to the message or they come to christ when they come to the lord and they use that word repent you know repent and be baptized and and and and they usually will repent and by the let us repentance about a change in your behavior not changing your passion not changing your words because sometimes some of us we speak differently and our lives don't line up with how we speak we may have changed our vocabulary by virtue of the experiences that we have gotten and all this stuff but our lives didn't didn't line up with that so here we see joseph and he is listening to his brothers he's asking about their their family he's coming across a certain way because he's probing he's he's probing and and we see the same way jesus would probe you know the woman at the well go call your husband because he's probing so joseph is is probing but he's really want to bring it to that spot of a test and we know that when they came the first time he held simeon and he said listen go and bring your youngest brother and then i will i will release you know this one that i'm keeping here um and so forth and and and jacob said not me i'm not i'm not doing it i'm not sending not benjamin you know why earlier um go on and tell him you're the next brother or they want to kind of keep it just talk talk talk a little kind of keep pulling them out shuttle they just go in there and talk and embarrassing people and and he had this whole this whole situation that we read last week before they didn't stay quiet we'd like to go to this stress hold on we gotta have food and and the whole debate and then we reach that point where judah say you know i will take responsibility for it and we will go and and and and they are concerned we we read last week with the money that they were supposed to pay for the items that it was a stressful time for them but but that is a test is uncomfortable a testing that has pleasant things and and sometimes it's it's so much you're dealing with here it is they're going back to egypt the pressure of their father and knowing how sensitive he was to benjamin going the pressure of knowing if they would be received the pressure of knowing that they the money that they carry to pay was in their possession still and they're trying to carry it back and carry double the money we read that last week they carry double the money plus they carry gifts and and all this stuff is going on and they're dealing with multiple issues it is it is interesting that life at times doesn't allow us to to deal with situations the way we want to deal with it it'll be easy if we have one issue to deal with at the time i wish our issues can line up and order a priority and we can deal with them one at a time but that's not how it is that is the reality of it many times our issues come at us sometimes all at the same time so you have a situation with with with job while job reading the email really bad news our next email hit him here finish process the first email by the time he really second email i turn the email is the children is the cattle is eating all at once and it is about a certain level of resilience of character that has been developed in us we can sit and talk about it for hours and hours and hours how when he didn't wanting and when he thought that was it it's like it's almost the extra that really coming back when he's ready mixing up him but you know what you're back still there you know your bucket break you thought it was destroyed you taught you couldn't take any more but the reality is you could withstand the pressures of the situation so here it was the bo the brothers go back to egypt and they get to the house and we read this last weekend and they talked to this church and they explained to him we bring back the money and all this stuff and then they go there and and and they get invited to joseph house and they're trying to figure out what really going on here this thing this matter i'd not be accused nothing's being spied you know he feeding us and then we see the unfolding of it how by some mysterious mystery here it is they're sitting down in order of age from oldest to youngest you know and and they just marvel and they can't understand what is happening because they don't know who joseph is and they see the food laid out and and we would have ended last week down to the part where uh uh we went in chapter of 43 at the last two places and they sat before him the first born according to his birthright in a chronological age and the youngest according to his youth and the men marveled one at another in other words how do you know that boy how they know who first and second now i can understand if they put the oldest one on one end and youngest one alone but but but when you really amplify it is in chronological order so every single one in perfect order so they had to marvel and he took and sent messages onto them or food before him but benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of this the fact that the bible mentions it is significant in one of itself but i wonder how the other brothers felt when they're wondering how come benjamin has so much food boy human nature has this ability to compare with one with one another but here it is benjamin has five times the amount of food all right and that is where we ended last week so we are in genesis 44 to bring this a study of joseph part three to bring us a close uh trust will be a blessing unto you so this would have been after they would have eaten uh you know and and and they're getting ready to go uh genesis 44 from verse one and he commanded the steward of his house saying fill the men's sacks with food as much as they can carry and put every man's money in his sacks amount so one more time he he he's saying i'm putting back the money their money is not good with me and put my cup the silver cup uh in the sax mouth of the youngest and his call on money and he did according to the word that joseph had spoken and as soon as the morning was light the men were sent away there and their asses and when they were gone out of the city and not yet far off joseph said unto stuart up follow after the men and when thou dost overtake them say unto them wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good so i want us to picture the relief with which these brothers would have left egypt feeling accomplished feeling that they were finally out of the clear they left there without any accusation bear in mind the first time they left they would have left with a certain level of of anxiety as it were because they are left there being accused of being spies they would have left there with one of their brothers behind so the way they are leaving now is different how they left the first time they are leaving saying okay finally we are able to move on unable carry food back and here it is now another test has been set up for them that they don't understand and verse five wherefore you really forget that verse four and in verse five it's a continuation it is not this it in which my lord drink it and whereby did he divine it and he have done evil and so doing just speaking about that that um that that cup that he plays there six and he overtook them and he's these same words you know just a quick point about this it's important to have people around you who can communicate oh praise the lord keep praising them since blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah praise god as far as the land has dropped but keep blessing his name father we bless you father we praise you we thank you for your word we thank you for your truth you back up by exactly seeing you i'm not hearing you can you hear me now yes yes we were at verse six and he overtook them and spake unto them these same words and they said unto him wherefore saith my lord these words this is very seven god forbid that thy servant should do according to this thing so these brothers are shocked at the accusation they can't understand where it's coming from they they have no idea what the man is accusing them of you know and uh so they are obviously defensive god forbid that i say once you do according to this thing this is not our way this is not our behavior there is nothing so verse 8 behold the money which we found in our sacks months we brought her again onto the outer hand of canaan so they are pleading their own case and defending themselves saying history will show the evidence would show that the first time we left and the money was that we brought it back so we obviously did not try to take anything at all how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold with whomsoever of thy servants it be found would let him die and we also will be my lord's bondman and he said now also let it be according unto your words he with whom it is found shall be my servant and ye shall be blameless no no it's it's it is it is a level of being convinced that you're right that this conversation would unfold this way that they would have the confidence to see okay if it is found let that person take the blame verse 11 then they speedily took down every man he sat to the ground and opened every man his sack and he searched and began at the eldest and left at the youngest so he go in an order again olessa youngest and the cop was found in benjamin's stock and they ran their clothes and laid every man his ass and returned to the city so in other words they tore their clothes and they load back up onto the donkeys all the items and they start to turn back to the city and judah and his brethren came to joseph's for he was yet there and they fell before him on the ground and joseph said unto them what deer is this that he have done what he not that such a man as i can certainly divine in other words what is this thing that you have done do you not realize that such a man is i can indeed practice divination and foretell everything you would do so joseph is testing them to see how they would act how they would respond and really i want to make this point here that joseph really wants to know in his heart of hearts if they change and i want to dwell on that concept a little bit if they have changed we're touching it a little bit again and judah said what shall we say unto my lord in other words i'm trying to i don't even know how to put it into words what shall we speak or how shall we clear ourselves god had found out the iniquity of thy servants behold we are my lord servants both we and he also with whom the cup is found in the amplified that verse 16 says so judah said what can we say to my lord what can we reply or how can we clear ourselves sin god since god has exposed the sin and guilt of your sins behold we are my lord slaves the rest of us as well as he with whom the cup is found now something is building here because i want us to recognize that all the years that have passed now at this point in time joseph is 39 years old he was 30 years old when he stood before pharaoh coming out of prison there would have been seven years of famine and now we are at two years sorry seven years of plenty and now we are two years into famine we'll see it a little later on in scripture i want us to notice that for all of these years in question these brothers had never come clean with their father that's a long time to hold something in your heart and not make it right that's a long time to hold something in your heart in agreement because they were all in agreement on this so thing are not seeing the situation for what it is there they are understanding and figuring out and trying to to see how it is unfolding that they are being dealt with for what they have held in secret all along so all of a sudden the condition and the situation the defense a billionaire the defense for for for not wanting to leave benjamin they begin to actually confess and what is the cages because we go in somewhere with this to come out of the situation that they were in here it is judah is saying what can we see it is almost he is saying what he's also thinking so he is logically he's processing he say what can we see how can we reply how can we clear ourselves because now god is exposing it so in his defense i wanted to catch this in his defense his defense becomes a confession let's build what shall we say unto my lord i want to catch it what shall we speak or how shall we clear ourselves and i want you to see it [Music] the greatest teaching out of this part is clearing yourself is coming clean god had found out the iniquity of thy servants behold we are my lord servant both we and he also with whom the cup is found verse 17 but joseph we replied god forbid that i should do so in other words i'm not trying to hold all you know so joseph started to move closer to the issue but the man in whose hand the cup is found he shall be my servant and as for you get you up in peace unto your father so joseph is saying and i'll be fighting here far be it from me that i should do that in other words i know all they're saying always are union and all they're working together and our hole in i know they want to stick together but i don't want to stick together i really want the one and i want order to go free in other words he is testing to see if they would be comfortable with repeating what it did the first thing when together they left and left him alone so he's testing if they would do the same thing they did the first time which is move together as a group and leave their brother out in urine verse 17 he said god forbid that i should do so but the man in whose hand the cup is found he shall be my servant and as for you no problem get you up in peace and unto your father verse 18. the confession here judah then jew came near unto him that close to somebody this is this is it is an exposure of vulnerability it's it's that act of sharing and and sharing something that's just confidential then judah came near unto him and said oh my lord let thy servant i pray he speak a word in my lord's ear in other words i have something to tell you that i never tell nobody before i have something to share about my life that i've been keeping locked up it's been eating at me and over the last few experiences that we have coming down to egypt you recognize that the lord want light to shine on this thing this is unfolding in such a way that is better i tell you and even though after you lock up i'd rather tell you i know i can live because i can't live with myself what was transpiring as a test that joseph was giving was actually bringing liberty and freedom to them because it brought a point where they could come clean and i want to use this tonight as a challenge as an encouragement as a teaching about coming clean about making things right about confessing about setting yourself free from the chains of your past and what's binding you verse 18 then judah came near unto him and said o my lord let thy servant i pray thee speak a word in my lord's ear and let not thine anger burn against thy servant for doubt at even as pharaoh so so so judah is peeling a case now he said my lord asked his servant saying have he a father or a brother so now they're going back to the first time they came they go back to the first conversation and they're going back to the first answer they gave and i want us to notice a very subtle thing the first time they came they did not make it explicitly clear the status of their brother they said we have another brother home and another one he not he not whatever not means they never made it clear about their brother maybe it was this recessed part of their mind this gray area there's room in their mind they leave him there because they don't want to admit they don't want to confront they want to deal with verse 20 and we said unto my lord we have a father an old man and a child of his old and a child of his old age a little one and his brother is dead and he alone is left of his mother and his father loved him and thou said unto thy servants bring him down unto me that i may set my eyes upon him and we said unto my lord the lord cannot leave his father for if we should leave his father his father would die and thou said us unto thy servants except your youngest brother come down with you ye shall see my face no more and it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father we told him the words of my lord and our father said go again and buy us a little food and we said we cannot go down if our youngest brother be with us then we will go down for we may not see the man's face except our youngest brother be with you be with us sorry and thy servant my father said unto us you know that my wife bearing me two sons and the one went out from me and i said surely he is torn in pieces and i saw him not since if you take this also from me and mischief befall him you shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave so they are relating all of this to joseph and joseph is now discerning the character the true character of the men and i want us to appreciate the number of tests that joseph took them through he tested them with money the first time they did not bring the money back so when they brought the money back he said okay well them them boys honest they brought even more they brought gifts they kept their word they brought the youngest brother so now this is like the final phase of the test now to see if they save their own selves what would they do or if they'd be willing to give up their brother and joseph is listening to the pleading of the case now therefore one verse 13. now therefore when i come to thy servant my father and the lad be not with us seeing that his life is bound up in this land's life so they're saying our father is tie up in this boy you want to keep here verse 31 it shall come to pass when he see that the lad is not with us when we go back home and this boy is not with us so in other words they say this is we explain to you why we're not going why are we not leaving this boy why if you keep keeping him you have to keep all of us it shall come to pass when he see that the lord is not with us that he will die and thy servant shall bring down the gray years of thy sermon our father with sorrow to the grief for thy servant speaking judah speaking about himself became surety for the lad unto my father in other words i accepted responsibility in the ambiface it says for your servant became security for the young man to my father saying if i bring him not unto thee then shall i barely blame to my father forever no therefore i pray thee let thy servant abide and this is where it shifted right here you remember we'd have touched on judah a little bit so it went from joseph saying i want to keep benjamin to all your brothers saying well if you're taking him you have to take all of us so now judah pleading a case now bear in mind judah was the one who sent long joseph into egypt this was the brother who was who was if you want to say the directly responsible individual who came up with the idea send him down to egypt here the transition now now therefore i pray he let thy servant abide instead of the land abundment to my lord and let the lord go up with his brethren judah was ready to take his brother's place and he gives a condition for how shall i go up to my father and the lad be not with me lest for adventure i see the evil that shall come on my father we almost done for tonight we're not going to be too long verse chapter 45 verse 1 and this is when it is in this like for me it's it's a great climax of this whole journey a 39 year old man who spent more of his adult life away from his family than his time with his family left home at 17 22 years later seeing the signs of reconciliation he held it together as long as he possibly can and genesis 45 was one then joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him bear in mind the last two encounters he had with his emotions and his feelings and his memories he did it in secret but sometimes they come to a point where you don't care no more there come a point where it's bigger than me it's bigger than you it's bigger than saving face it's bigger than what people think about me joseph couldn't refill himself before all them that stood by him and he cried he said cause every man to go out from me i'm sorry and there stood no man with him while joseph made himself known unto his brethren and we know that the prophet would have typed this so joseph sent all the gentiles out including his wife and children brother branham said this was joseph making himself known he typed into the 344 000 so we understand all these things there but the magnitude of this it's it's just so real to see at that point he felt he could be honest with him because he felt love he felt compassion judah the same judah 22 years before to say true numb to egypt here he was pleading to keep his younger brother safe to make sure his father has no more hoot and at that point joe's ever seen these boys repent it was no longer words i wanted to catch this it was no longer the talking or talk they were willing judah was willing to put his life on the line for what he believed he was willing to take his brother's place he was willing to self-sacrifice to ensure that his father had no more good are you willing to self-sacrifice to make sure that your father your heavenly father have no more hit when you look at your life and your mistakes and decisions that you made that had consequences intended or otherwise when you reflect on these things are you willing to sacrifice to not cause your heavenly father any more hurt it's a deep question man because our actions contain god god has emotions you know he's a jealous god he gets angries he is touched he feels he he he the issues around your life affects him you don't think god gets disappointed way back in genesis the bible said god repented that he made man when he looked at how man came in there noah he said what this is not what i create them for look at them lord oh hallelujah thank you lord jesus do you understand how your actions affect god sometimes we think maybe of how our actions affect other people or something we don't even think of how it affects other people but at that point in time here i want to just kneel down the tipping point for joseph was twofold one it was judah's willingness to sacrifice for his brother and his consciousness of the effect that if he didn't do something about it how how his father would have been affected let's bring this to a close verse two and he wept aloud in the two previous encounters he wept in secret he wept in his room the last time he read he ran to his room to find a place to weep but now he wept aloud and and listen to this and the egyptians and the house of pharaoh hood that's powerful he didn't care anymore he didn't care who here he didn't care what people said because what was taking place was more important to him than people's perception of who he was what he was what he was going through in the last two encounters he was focused on saving face he was focused on people's impression the bible said he even washed his face to hide what he was going through but now i reached a tipping point for him it did not matter what people said too many of us are sensitive of what people say people's emotions how people will see it what they'll say about it you have to know what is so important to you what matters to you so much that it does not matter what anybody say about it if that people don't want to come to the altar when there's an altar called because they're wondering what people will say here it was the man who judah just said great like pharaoh the bible said you wept aloud and the egyptians and the house of pharaoh hood verse 3 and joseph said unto his brethren i am joseph but my father yet live now bear in mind this question was already answered earlier so it is not that he's asking the question for an answer he's now asking the question from a different context in other words he had asked the question before in his role of his office as governor now he's asking the question as his brother so so it's it's it's the relationship has shifted so so i am joseph that my father yet lived he knew he alive you know but he said asking us now a different kind of question then because this is 22 years in he making and his brethren couldn't answer now they answered this before you know but under the context of the current most moment they do even any words for they were troubled at his presence what a paradoxa in the amplified it says but his brothers were speechless for they were stunned and dismayed this made doesn't even mean excited you know devil is just shocked they cannot believe no 22 years is not two years ago 22 years ago by the fact that they were in joseph's presence they couldn't believe and joseph said unto his bedroom come near to me so the fact that he didn't say come near to me speaks volumes never say they almost catatonic everything catatonic people say in complete complete shock that frozen in position they cannot believe the secret that they kept for 22 years the thing that they couldn't confront with 20 years the guilt that they carried for 20 years come on now what they taught was a weight upon them for 22 years that they carried the burden of it for 22 years the burden that they thought was heavier was actually lighter because they didn't know that joseph was in this position joseph was okay joseph was alive what they buried and taught was secret was in front of them doing better than they could have ever expected and we'll see how joseph will bring it out and joseph said unto his version come near to me i pray you and they came near and he said i am joseph your brother looking repeating it to them so you see clearly trying to help them to realize that this is real whom you saw into egypt so you starting to bring pieces together for them to convince them because they cannot believe bear in mind the journey they would have gone through you you remember a couple of chapters before the man in egypt the man in egypt say you won this the man in egypt said he won this and here it is the man they say i am joseph every brother whom you're sold into egypt we almost done now therefore be not grieved no angry with yourselves that he sold me hither for god did send me before you to preserve life for these two years see that's where the mats come from right for these two years had the famine been in the land and yet there are five years in which there shall be neither be it shall neither be airing nor harvest and god sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth you remember i said it that deal schreiber judah had to be preserved that the churn of israel had to be preserved so this whole unfolding of storing grain where there was the storage facility for green was designed for the posterity of the children of israel egypt was benefiting because the line of the tribe of judah had to be preserved all the nations would come into egypt the reason they had egypt to go to at that time was because of the children of israel and the line to preserve a posterity on the earth hallelujah i want you to see that and to save your lives by a great deliverance in the amplified it says god sent me to egypt ahead of you so here he not tapered into no prison and and he said god sent me to egypt ahead of you to preserve you for a remnant on the earth that's the amplified doesn't this song familiar look at the words in the amplified here look at me typing in here and to keep you alive by a great escape so they stored up food in egypt is a great escape for a remnant for posterity oh come on now what joseph didn't understand because up until this point up until this famine he didn't understand his purpose you know before this encounter with his family and what was happening all he knew he was a survivor that by the grace of god he was standing strong making it he didn't even understand the connection when he was thrown into the prison between him being there and him saving his house and that family in that messed up situation and in the agreement to keep in secret the bad decisions they made in life didn't realize that there was a bigger plan at work and we see on both sides what was intended for evil what was intended for this way or that way and what happened this week however it happened because god is so good god is the only one can bring together different stories and line them all up look at us in this room if we take all of us have stories that could unfold similar to this and god can line it all up no no tuesday evening we could be in the same room and christ could be making himself known to you when the whole world is outside and he's sending him out of the room he can make himself known to you by revealing himself to you anybody with me tonight so verse seven we're almost done and god sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth a legacy in the earth a testimony unto the earth a remnant on the earth and to save your life by a great deliverance the amplified says great escape so now check this out now this is this we know this or no but this is big enough because many of us going through trials notice i say many of you i see many of us going through trials we in this thing you know all kind of experiences we going through but look now at the context of how somebody who went through 22 years of trials talking about the trials so now it was not you that sent me either hallelujah listen this takes away blaming anybody about anything you know i want us to get this here this had no this take blame audi listen it would not be out of context for judah to say but it was judah and it was you you remember we read the scripture how when them brothers started to talk and joseph was understanding them how they say when he was his soul was crying out because they were sending him to egypt this any gate the fact that that happened you know so so joseph was saying that it happened but he's now seeing it it's not your fault i'm not blaming you you are peace on the border on this chessboard like i'm a peace on the board you were being moved and he didn't realize he was being moved your jealousy your envy your hatred your all your feelings about me was just moves on the board to bring you to this spot and to bring me to this spot oh come on now so tonight tonight if i can kneel down shut down the blame it's not your wife it's not your children it's not the boss it's not the pastor it's not the church it's not the government there's nobody to blame here are mature seasoned sons speak so no it was not you that sent me hither you weren't even control of your emotions when you spoke ill that way you it wasn't your it wasn't your plan that that changed the trajectory of my life if you don't bring this into context we can look back and they say let us not kill him let us send along to egypt it was song as if it was their plan but it was god who was orchestrating all of that i want you to see that everything you look back that looked like it was a mess god hand was to bring us to which spot this one right now this spot in this room right now as god is making himself known to you in the midst of your journey that bring it to the spot that you can look back and speak like joseph so no no tonight it was not you that sent me heather but god oh that's powerful that's powerful that's powerful that the job that you lost was god oh listen listen listen the house you lost was god the situation that didn't work out was god it's all god because god allowed everything that happened in your life nothing could happen friends that god didn't allow it's either god is in control or he's not in control and if he's in control then nothing could happen to you that god didn't allow to happen come on now that alone should make you want to jump that alone to make you want to shout every negative experience every positive experience every mountain every valley every situation is god's grace to you to bring you to a spot that he can get the glory to preserve your life your life your family life those you love those that love you i'm trying to close out and listen to now how joseph speaking now this this when i read this it blew my mind completely so now it was not you that sent me heather but god and he listened to joseph's words here and he had made me a father to pharaoh right yeah yeah yeah if you utterly might do that listen listen joseph basically pulling on your rank card for them and say listen fear like my son if you understand him manicure statement he had joseph the man who was in prison saying look at me now fear like my son god made me make me like a father to hero what oh blessed be the name of the lord praise them saints oh give me some glory give me some worship oh hallelujah thank you lord thank you lord thank you jesus hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory glory glory glory glory o praise the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord thank you jesus thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah

the name of the lord thank you lord thank you jesus thank you lord my my my my hallelujah glory to god hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord blessed be the name of the lord thank you lord jesus oh what a blessing to be here tonight saints praise god no i said well isaac dropped out here but oh my what a word what a word what a word tonight hallelujah no one to blame god sent me a head to preserve life hallelujah this is the god i preserve when you come to a spiritual maturity you cannot blame you don't blame the government you don't blame the people you don't blame husband wife god is god it's god because romans 8 28 we know all things work together for good to them that love god to them what he called according to his purpose oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah what a sign of adoption spiritual maturity not blaming not trying to make excuses but accepting responsibility hallelujah and does what joseph did he accepted responsibility alleluia tested his brothers he saw that they are changed it will take time they take time but they were jealous of him they all bowed on but eventually the prophecy was fulfilled and the prophecies that the prophet released it will be fulfilled in your life i'm not talking about general and this could happen that happened the prophecy considering your life will be fulfilled you will make a way for that to be fulfilled oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah oh glory to god thank you lord jesus oh hallelujah lord we worship you lord we honor you lord we bless your name tonight we can't give the truth lord oh blessed be the name of the lord we thank you for bringing things clear hallelujah thank you lord oh god we thank you for your blood oh that followed the spirit that followed the blood all the way from the book of redemption thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord praise god what a victory what a victory tonight joseph himself didn't even realize the magnitude of why he was done in egypt until his brethren came isn't that something that's powerful that is powerful from one's perspective he was just like a a ceo or next to pharaoh and and helping the egyptians and helping by vision and so on but little did he know when he saw it he it that revelation broke upon him that god sent me ahead to preserve life that's the bigger picture that is the big picture god call you ahead of the rest of your family god call you ahead of the rest of your loved ones god call you ahead oh blessed be the name of the lord thank you lord jesus hallelujah praise god call you ahead thank you lord blessed be the name of the lord thank you lord jesus okay but isaac bless and blessed and blessed be the the the enemy mariana yay the enemy enemies don't let the enemy do it don't let them realize you know what is in store for them but i was i believe the last one i was making was joseph was telling them brothers no because the the egyptians were no longer in the room you know it was just him and the family so he could speak in a way that he could have never spoken before this is the first time he is in the presence of people that he can make this kind of statement he could not have said this to an egyptian they would not have appreciated this statement but here it is joseph is telling them i am like pharaoh's father you say god he had made me a father to pharaoh this is the first time it would have been a thought in joseph because joseph never forgot who he was hallelujah he never forget where he came from he'd never forget his story he was locked up in egypt but in his heart he still had canaan in his heart he still had his father in his heart he said his family in his heart and he could have never shared his testimony until this time now when for the first time he could tell egyptians go outside it's just me and my family alone and he could say it was not you that sent me hither but god and he had made me a father to pharaoh that accepted our whole message father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt i'm getting ready to close out here see and go up to my father and say unto him thus saith thy son joseph god had made the lord of all egypt come down unto me tarry not you see how joseph all of a sudden listen i can imagine the energy in that room and him i can imagine the vibrations in that room and him just said thy son joseph and he probably said and verse and verse 10 and thou shalt dwell in the land of goshen and thou shalt be near unto me all the years 22 years you were far from me but look how immediate and how permanent and how clear and direct restoration looks like and thou shalt dwell in the land of goshen and thou shalt be near unto me thou and thy children and thy children's children and thy flocks and thy hoods and all that thou hast and there i love it he's in a position of strength now all of the pain has turned into strength all of the sacrifice has turned into strength all of the crying is now strength all that he has gone through is now strength his umbilical cord was tied to suffering but before you could reign you must suffer so a perfect type of what we have to go through to be where we have now and there will i nourish thee for yet there are five years of famine lest thou and thy household and all that thou has come to poverty and behold your eyes see and the eyes of my brother benjamin that it is my mouth that speak it unto you and you shall tell my father of all my glory in egypt you see how we begin this to speak now tell my father of all my glory in egypt and all that he have seen and he shall hear and bring down my father heather and he fell upon his brother benjamin's neck and wept and benjamin wept upon his neck you see how this is a whole type here of reconciliation of reconnecting of of of of unity in the family again you see how real family time is and how god interested in family and restoration and coming back together and closing the divide so it doesn't look 22 years of separation and in that moment restoration moreover he kissed all his brethren and wept upon them and after that his brethren talk with him and i want us to understand friends this would not have been an easy experience for those brothers in he was trying to help them come unto the shell of their guilt and i just think just think of the grace that joseph extended to his brothers after what his brothers did to him and to think of the grace that god extend to us when we didn't even understand what you were doing to him no wonder on the cross joseph who's the type of christ he had jesus saying father forgive them for they know not what they do this was the same teaching taking place way back then genesis it wasn't you you didn't understand what he was doing you hurt me you didn't understand but there was a greater plan behind it verse 16 and the fame thereof was heard in pharaoh's house saying joseph's brethren had come and it pleased pharaoh well and his servants what a testimony joseph had that when they hear joseph family reach it please hero so much because he happy for pharaoh you see the paradox of this thing and pharaoh said unto joseph say unto thy virgin this do he laid your beast and go gets you onto the land of canaan this is the first time we see pharaoh get back involved into the affairs since he had over to jerusalem he get involved to give more strength to how important joseph is and jesus family to joseph check it out up until this time remember all of the rank orders everything even pharaoh said nothing will move unless joseph say it and pharaoh senator joseph as if to reinforce he says say unto your brethren this do he laid your beasts in other words lord your animals and return unto the land of canaan and take your father and your household and come unto me and i will give you the good of the land of egypt and you shall eat the fat of the land now thou art commanded this do we take you wagons out of the land of egypt of your little ones and for your wives and bring your father to come also regard not your stuff [Laughter] for the good of all the land of egypt is yours so so firo say listen tell him don't even bother don't pack no food you know whatever don't bring nothing you know there's some people to go ahead and ask them what i could bring should i bring out a sweet drink break bring anything don't bring nothing you're good just come now you have everything you say regard not your stuff for the good of all the land of egypt is yours and the children of israel did so and joseph gave them wagons according to the commandment of pharaoh and gave them provision for the way to all of them he gave each man changed his arraignment but to benjamin he gave 300 pieces of silver and five changes of agreement boy he loved that brother and to his father he's sent after this manner 10 asses laden with the good things of egypt 10 she asses lady with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way so he sent his virgin away and they repotted and he said to them see that you fall not out by the way in other words don't lose your way go straight there and they went up out of egypt and came into the land of canaan unto jacob their father and told him saying joseph is yet alive and he is governor over all the land of egypt and jacob's heart fainted for he believed them not poor poor jacob jacob made him land features and they told him all the words of joseph which he had seven to them and when he saw again i wanted to catch this they were talking to him all the time they told him joseph is alive they told him all the words of joseph which he had said unto them but listen to what convinced him you see the difference between word and manifestation and word and demonstration and the gospel is a word only and in power when he saw the wagons in other words when he saw the physical manifestation of what they were talking about he knew that wagon was in their wagons these were wagons ordered by the king it had to be a great poet he said when he saw the wagons with joseph had sent to carry him the spirit of jacob their father revived listen friends people have to see something you catch me people have to see something it can't be talk something has to be visible people have to know something change in your life in your walk in your talk and israel said it is enough in other words when he saw what came he said it is enough i don't need to see no more i see all i need to see it is enough joseph my son is yet alive i will go and see him before i die hallelujah and there will come a time friends that the manifestation will be enough the manifestation will be the interpretation the demonstration will be enough the fulfillment of prophecy will be enough the stored up food and the expression of it will be enough can we give the lord a way of offering a hand clap of praise can we give the lord thanks and can we pledge to hold in our heart if it's one lesson that i want to leave us with tonight it's the maturity in the face of situations to look at the situations that come and be able to say god sent me so it was not you that sent me but god i want you to see there's nothing tonight friends that you could do about yesterday about last week about last month about last year you can't undo a decision you can't change what transpired you can't do anything about yesterday you can't do anything about this morning it has already passed the most you do is say a word or say a prayer or say but the reality is the the ph has already turned and we're in this room tonight and the page is turning of what happens now what happens next what are the next moves that you have to make knowing fully well that you cannot change your past and the reality is god brought us into this room tonight we are little hiccups even the technology want to act up but it's it's a truth that is coming to us tonight to bring us to this spot that nothing is by chance nothing is by accident and you want to acknowledge this whole thing about don't blame anybody else and even bigger friends you can't even blame yourself i don't even want you to blame yourself i want you to trust the process and trust god and make a commitment tonight to press forward don't be on the sidelines this was a moment of truth for joseph because he couldn't talk this way before this point this chapter here in genesis 45 is the chapter when he could refrain himself in other words he lost himself i've seen people sit along in church for a long time and then they see when somebody have a real breakthrough you know they reach a point where they care what nobody see they jump they shout they cry that does not have put on a show something has to trigger on the inside and joseph would have had this locked up in his heart for a long time but he came to his crossroads where he was ready to be who he really was because he was seeing his brethren and tonight we are with our brethren we are here united by where we come from united by where we are going and we are all saying to one another it is god it's god in you it's god in me it's god who has brought us here it is god who has brought us together there's nothing that has gone wrong to bring us to this spot god brought us here for our purpose let us bow here for a word of prayer or heavenly father lord this little simple teaching and part three of this study of joseph and the unfolding of this this great testimony lord of this this joseph who typed out christ lord nothing against joseph and to see lord how he persevered how he withstood he had his moments he he clearly had his times of disappointment and all these things that to see lord the great climax the great reconciliation the great restoration and lord the maturity lord to look at the situation he could have said it was judah he could have said it was my brother's he could have said earlier she didn't have to do that and and and and while it was so and but he said it was god who sent me to preserve life he acknowledged the bigger plan he acknowledged a higher purpose he acknowledged higher calling he saw the bigger picture he looked beyond their force he looked beyond his issues and he saw the great plan that you were unfolding that there was a posterity there was a great escape there was an opportunity for his family to be saved not just saved not just avoid poverty but preserved life that the legacy of the tribe of judah and all the tribes of israel could be lord part of the the great journey of scripture and life even up to this time now lord even to the the transition from the gentile dispensation lord to going back to the jews again as brother branham even type joseph being made known lord as to that conscience forty four thousand lord so we thank you father for lord unfollowing a word to us in his bible telling tonight and lord i pray that the people are encouraged and they stood up stood up to look for reconciliation still not to look for wreckage for restoration lord stir it up to one fellowship one with another stir it up to want a revival stood up to see a demonstration stood up for a manifestation lord they went back to jacob and told him your son is alive he didn't believe it they told him all joseph's word he didn't believe it but when he saw what joseph sent when he saw something that he could say nah nah this is what i see here is too much this is not words anymore lord give us an experience with the supernatural that it will not be just words only lord may we have that experience of switching from the ministry of the world to the ministry of the spirit lord may you restore heal touch deliver tonight lord may you heal families tonight lord if there's someone tonight lord who has been lord separated from a loved one lord there are people who are in church who who in the same house and they're separated lord may you bring reconciliation tonight may you bring healing tonight may guilt and the past and the resentment and the animosity and the jealousy and the envy and the bad feelings may it die in this room tonight may the issues be settled tonight lord as joseph was on making himself known his brothers didn't know how to respond they didn't know what would happen next and it took joseph making the effort to say it's okay it's okay it's okay lord let your people know tonight it is okay it is behind it is the past and let us press forward into the glories of the resurrection into the glories of your manifestation into the glories of your demonstration we commit your church into your hands may you bless the service tomorrow night lord via live streaming may you bless the prayer and fast this coming friday as we take that effort that sacrifice to amplify our prayers lord the same way you fasted when you were here another lord the same way through scripture we see the importance of that extra sacrifice lord so we want to commit the day on friday to you as our prayer fast day to lord to come lord friday night in the zoo prayer meeting lord to hunger and to tears and to cry out and to sigh for the abomination in the city to sci for our young people to sigh for our marriages decide for our children to cry out for revival lord may you bring us to that spot and may you bless our servants this coming sunday and be with you people in the precious name of jesus christ amen amen and amen and amen may the lord richly bless you thank you for being a wonderful audience stay on fire be encouraged god is in control amen amen love you god bless you
