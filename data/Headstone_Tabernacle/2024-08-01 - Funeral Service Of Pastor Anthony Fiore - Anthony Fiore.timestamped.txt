[24:42] I'm going to open by reading obit for my
[24:45] dad and share a couple of stories I
[24:47] think in talking to almost all of you
[24:49] here today the things that came most
[24:51] apparent was uh what was my dad about
[24:54] and I think there were two terms one is
[24:56] simple but not simple
[24:59] minded but uncomplicated everything was
[25:01] basic it was black it was white uh it
[25:04] was how he felt how he lived his life
[25:06] and how he interacted with everyone from
[25:09] his family to the church people and
[25:13] probably be a little bit different than
[25:14] some of the uh funeral service that
[25:16] we've had going ask uh for the dean to
[25:18] come up in a few minutes do an opening
[25:20] prayer we're going to have a couple of
[25:23] songs his granddaughter Abigail is going
[25:25] to sing a song uh we have brother the is
[25:28] going to say a few words Porsche is
[25:30] going to sing a
[25:31] song I'm going to come back and tell a
[25:34] few more stories about my dad and try to
[25:36] give you some more information of you
[25:37] know who he is to us what made him
[25:40] special and why there's so many of us
[25:42] here that are in
[25:44] memory and then asked a couple of other
[25:46] brothers that are here to come up and
[25:47] say a few words brother Wellington
[25:49] brother Co brother brother HTO we going
[25:52] to read uh some letters and testimonies
[25:54] for some special people in my Dad's life
[25:57] and then uh but Joey's going to sing a
[25:59] song and we're going to uh we we'll
[26:03] close the service on
[26:13] time so Anthony John Fury was uh known
[26:17] as Tony at work some of you knew as Nino
[26:20] or brother Fury or Reverend Fury he
[26:23] would have been 84 years old uh on July
[26:26] the 26th he was born in Brook in New
[26:28] York his father was John Anthony his
[26:30] mother was Pauline they called her Betty
[26:34] and he had a younger sister luil he
[26:37] married my mom meline April 15th
[26:40] 1961 as you know many of you would hear
[26:42] mom passed on July 31st last year and
[26:46] five children Timothy who's no longer
[26:48] here with us I'm Paul Lois John and
[26:51] Unice nine grandchildren Johanna Martha
[26:55] James Jonah Abigail Deborah Ro Isabella
[26:59] and Angelina and dad had four great
[27:02] grandchildren as well and survived by
[27:05] nephew s Anthony
[27:20] and so Anthony is that
[27:25] better well hopefully you all know the
[27:27] names of the kids and most the
[27:30] grand so Dad grew up in Brooklyn New
[27:34] York he met my mom in a church in I
[27:39] believe it was in in Brooklyn there's
[27:40] actually a letter from Brother Palomo
[27:41] that I'll read that'll have a little bit
[27:43] more uh color in detail on the early
[27:46] parts of my dad being saved and learning
[27:48] about church they moved to Queens Ozone
[27:51] Park in 1965 they moved to Westbury in
[27:55] 1977 and in 2000 they moved to digs
[27:58] Hills which was the final place for my
[28:00] dad and
[28:02] family for work uh is interesting I just
[28:05] talked with my dad a couple of days ago
[28:07] at the hospital maybe last week and
[28:09] asked him about his first job he was 16
[28:11] years old in 1956 and he worked for the
[28:15] Brooklyn W wood heel Factory and dad had
[28:18] a grandmother named Anna Theona and she
[28:21] had seven grandson or children sons and
[28:25] one daughter the only daughter was my
[28:26] dad's mom and the
[28:29] the the sons were uh Joe William John
[28:32] Frank Vincent Tony and Angelo and Uncle
[28:35] William was my dad's favorite uncle and
[28:38] my dad was Uncle William's favorite I
[28:41] would think even as opposed to his
[28:43] children and his other grandchildren the
[28:45] ne he really love my dad and the Seven
[28:48] Brothers started the Brooklyn wood meal
[28:49] Factory so my dad that was his first
[28:51] experience at
[28:53] work um his he told me his first job was
[28:56] the wood heel Examiner a job that's not
[28:59] around anymore it means that you
[29:01] actually look at the final the factory
[29:04] would start with a tree the tree would
[29:05] be uh go through many processes and at
[29:08] the end would come out with a heel that
[29:10] would go on a man or a woman's shoes and
[29:12] my dad's first job was examining the
[29:13] heel to see if it was good enough to
[29:16] make it or to not make
[29:19] it so my dad turned out to be really
[29:22] good mechanically and very fast so he
[29:24] worked his way to the point where he had
[29:25] almost all the jobs at the wood heel
[29:27] Factory
[29:28] and interestingly my dad would always
[29:31] brag that the Brooklyn wood heel Factory
[29:33] was one of four factories all the other
[29:35] ones went out of business but they were
[29:37] the last ones to go out of business and
[29:40] I guess the the Plastics really came in
[29:41] and changed the world and the style
[29:44] changed and the last job my dad had was
[29:46] to go out to do sales at the woodill
[29:49] factory and talk to the shoe
[29:52] manufacturers and shoe makers to find
[29:53] out why uh but fortunately he was able
[29:56] to uh when that business went under he
[29:58] had a job at the New York City Transit
[30:00] Authority where he had a terrific career
[30:02] he started as a laborer and left as
[30:06] Deputy superintendent for the New York
[30:07] City Transit
[30:09] Authority and then he also had another
[30:11] job after retirement in a Morton Village
[30:14] in in Long
[30:17] Island but the biggest part and you may
[30:20] know about my dad was his church life so
[30:23] he actually his father was a Catholic
[30:25] pacan and it was very early on that my
[30:28] dad I guess influenced by his grandma
[30:30] Anna
[30:31] Bona would share with him scriptures and
[30:34] she was in a Pentecostal church and my
[30:37] dad would ask the priest why is he
[30:39] wearing such long garment and he would
[30:41] read him a scripture from the Bible
[30:42] basically saying you know you will not
[30:44] enlarge your garment uh but he was
[30:47] converted to uh Pentecostal Church as an
[30:50] Italian Pastor Nam Joseph Roma that ran
[30:53] the church and then where he met the the
[30:56] bomo family and from there you know they
[31:00] met brother Coleman in the 1960s were
[31:02] introduced to the message and dad had a
[31:06] you know long of course career with the
[31:08] local Christian Assembly started as a
[31:10] youth leader Deacon assistant pastor an
[31:12] elder and pastor and then in
[31:16] 2017 uh he was asked by several
[31:18] Believers to uh lead a new church called
[31:21] the United bride assembly and he was
[31:23] Pastor there in 2017
[31:28] I guess I would finalize theary before
[31:31] some opening comments saying that you
[31:33] know that will be remembered for
[31:35] devotion Devotion to God Church his
[31:38] family in that order I would
[31:41] say he was a loyal humble dedicated and
[31:46] love those by all the
[31:48] encounter
[31:50] and I've heard many testimonies today
[31:52] from people telling me the first that
[31:54] they married they were married by my dad
[31:56] or performed his funeral service for
[31:58] someone in their family where he
[32:00] dedicated uh many
[32:02] people most people don't know he also
[32:04] started off praying on street corners
[32:07] and visiting prisons and hospitals and
[32:10] praying for people that were in need and
[32:12] hurt tremendous testimonies here early
[32:15] today so from
[32:17] people to functions and others that said
[32:20] that you know they were able to call 5:
[32:23] in the morning and have my dad stop
[32:26] everything he was doing to go out and
[32:27] business pray for for
[32:32] people I would say that stories was the
[32:35] most important part most important part
[32:38] of what my dad
[32:40] represented you know I open been talking
[32:43] about being simple and everything was
[32:46] simple for that you know um I remember
[32:49] we moved to Westbury Long Island there
[32:51] must have been 50 families that moved
[32:53] after we moved but it seemed like the
[32:55] right thing to do Queens was getting
[32:57] prowed
[32:59] Long Island seems safer home values are
[33:02] starting to move up and dad was a leader
[33:04] in that way where maybe didn't go to
[33:06] college and he didn't learn about
[33:07] Finance but he seemed to know the right
[33:09] thing to do right he was the first to
[33:11] buy solar panels on the roof the first
[33:14] buy electric car with the Teslas just
[33:17] little things that he did that for him
[33:19] it just simple and it made sense and he
[33:21] was able to you know follow his heart
[33:23] and do it
[33:30] so that's the obituary and you hear on
[33:32] story what was my dad that was his home
[33:34] life his family life his church life and
[33:38] some of the big things uh that he matter
[33:41] but I don't think he giv the details of
[33:43] exactly who who he was and you know so
[33:46] one thing I want to point out is that
[33:47] Dad was
[33:48] touched okay many of you may know that
[33:51] he's a Leo and he was a fighter you may
[33:53] know nebor drank didn't gamble didn't
[33:55] smoke didn't do drugs but you may not
[33:58] know that he never even took aspirin it
[34:00] was very very rare even if you had a
[34:02] headache or some pain and even at the
[34:04] end when I visited that the hospital
[34:07] last week uh they were surprised to hear
[34:09] that he wasn't on pain medications and
[34:11] he wasn't in in pain when they sent them
[34:15] home uh I remember one time we were in
[34:19] Seldon Long Island and um there was a
[34:22] tenant in the house that was gifted from
[34:25] my mom's grandmother and the tenants
[34:28] weren't paying
[34:29] rent and we were all in the car we were
[34:31] all very little and we I guess we were
[34:33] going to go to a convention my mom was
[34:35] very afraid that dad was going to get
[34:36] into an argument going out but he took
[34:39] the person that was in the house and
[34:41] basically said you're not paying rent
[34:43] you got to get out and then apparently
[34:45] this guy's brother-in-law who was very
[34:47] muscular he like pushed everyone aside
[34:49] and came to the front and said is there
[34:50] a
[34:51] problem and my dad grabs the guy by the
[34:53] shirt and said yes there's a
[34:56] problem if you don't get out I'm putting
[34:59] all the furniture on the street you look
[35:01] like you got muscles you're going to
[35:02] help me we're going to take
[35:05] all but Dad mellowed out because I
[35:08] bought a house in Brooklyn and I moved
[35:10] to California and my tenant wasn't
[35:11] paying rent so I sent my dad out to talk
[35:15] him Don tells me that Dad went there
[35:17] found out the guy was at a job as a bus
[35:19] driver and he prayed for
[35:26] him I think the biggest thing about Dad
[35:29] is his love for nature and maybe it was
[35:31] the first job he had where he with wood
[35:34] talking to brother M whimple in the
[35:37] earlier service and he saying that Dad
[35:39] could talk for one hour about
[35:42] wood I never told him that we would take
[35:45] wood and paint it over with different
[35:47] colors it would drive him crazy he would
[35:50] always if he ever found wood that was
[35:51] painted he would stand it down bring it
[35:53] down to what he thought was the you know
[35:55] was the the natural
[35:59] may I know that Dad was a barber and
[36:02] taught me patience because with three
[36:04] kids couldn't afford to get everyone
[36:06] haircuts and Dad learned how to be a
[36:07] part and Tim and I and John would feel
[36:10] such empathy with the other one so it
[36:12] was my turn to get a haircut they would
[36:14] like propop me up and give me candy
[36:16] because it was going to be a onh hour
[36:17] process my dad didn't want us to go to
[36:20] school with like cut hair and get made
[36:22] fun of but you know very very was very
[36:25] patient took his job took his time
[36:28] uh dad was also a mechanic he could fix
[36:31] almost anything he started off as a
[36:32] carpenter but he could fix locks he
[36:35] could do cement work do almost anything
[36:39] and his I mentioned earlier one of his
[36:41] uncles was Uncle William and Uncle
[36:43] William when he died he left my dad all
[36:46] his tools so he's got every tool has
[36:48] cared the letter W for William uh on the
[36:51] tool and it's truly was the prize
[36:54] possession for his uncle William had his
[36:55] own shop and when you know my dad uh you
[37:00] know took over the pools he was very
[37:01] proud to have them but he could do
[37:03] almost any type of um of job I remember
[37:07] the one story he told us he was at the
[37:09] transit authority he was just learning
[37:11] how unions work and there was a broken
[37:15] lock on the locker and my dad could fix
[37:18] it so he waited to see if they were
[37:19] going to fix it and the union didn't fix
[37:21] it so my dad like took off the lock and
[37:23] was going to repair it himself and that
[37:26] was it the union came they stopped at a
[37:28] whole job they had to rope everything
[37:31] off people had to go into a different
[37:33] entrance for 3 months because a
[37:35] carpenter who's in the carpenter Union
[37:37] was now trying to fix a lot that was
[37:39] done by a different
[37:43] Union so dad
[37:45] was dad was a mechanic and dad was also
[37:49] an artist um not a good professional
[37:53] artist like brother Carl but talk to
[37:55] brother Carl Thompson earlier he was
[37:56] caring that
[37:58] my dad told him he wanted to paint the
[38:00] road toas which is the story when two
[38:04] disciples were walking to Jerusalem to
[38:06] mayus and the Gospel of Luke Jesus
[38:08] joined them after the
[38:10] resurrection and brother Carl tried to
[38:12] talk my dad out of painting the pain he
[38:15] said that it was too hard um he might
[38:18] want to start with something less
[38:20] ambitious um but he said I have it you
[38:23] know in my heart to make that pain did
[38:26] and brother Carl was sharing the story
[38:27] with with me that when he came up after
[38:30] I think four or 6 months to see the
[38:32] final painting but Carl told my dad that
[38:34] he's retiring his paint brushes he
[38:36] doesn't want to paint
[38:38] anymore because my dad truly did a
[38:40] beautiful job
[38:42] and the BS are here my dad gave that
[38:46] painting to them because they were very
[38:48] special in my Dad's life BS thank you
[38:51] very much it was um I told Brother both
[38:55] brother Ram you know having that in
[38:57] their hand is a is special to show that
[38:59] my dad you know took his most prized
[39:02] possession just like Uncle William
[39:04] didn't give it to his kids you know my
[39:06] dad gave that pain B said God bless
[39:10] you by the way I don't think my dad did
[39:13] another picture after he painted the
[39:15] road toas he retired as an
[39:19] artist so brother
[39:21] Kevin would you mind coming up
[39:27] I'm going to um I have a several more
[39:30] stories I'd like to share but I'd like
[39:31] to first ask uh Brother Dean to come up
[39:34] and say an opening
[39:36] prayer
[39:37] um and then we're going to have uh help
[39:40] lead us in two songs we're going to have

[55:35] service for my precious Pastor brother
[55:38] Anthony
[55:40] bori aside from being my
[55:43] pastor brother Anthony Fury was a father
[55:47] figure to
[55:49] me he was a role
[55:51] model and he was a servant of Christ
[55:56] as many of you
[55:58] know brother Fury endured many hardships
[56:02] in
[56:03] life he lost a
[56:06] granddaughter a
[56:07] son and less than a year ago he lost his
[56:14] wife amen but through it all like
[56:18] job brother Fury kept on serving his
[56:24] Lord Brother Fury was was such a good
[56:28] man that God continually boasted about
[56:32] him he told Satan I give you permission
[56:36] to test how faithful my servant Anthony
[56:40] fiori would
[56:42] be if he had to endure loss grief pain I
[56:48] know brother Anthony brother Anthony
[56:50] fiori will come through it
[56:53] am for the Fiori's ability I believe in
[56:57] the Lord Almighty was so impressive that
[57:01] he exed
[57:03] evil his life story continued to be
[57:06] revent today because of his ability to
[57:09] believe in the Lord despite his
[57:13] sufferings why do innocent people like
[57:16] brother Fury go through the sufferings
[57:19] that he went through we do not know but
[57:23] what we do know is like job brother Fury
[57:26] did not commit sin that led to his
[57:30] sufferings his sufferings came about as
[57:33] God allowed Satan to test his
[57:36] faith job represents the truth that
[57:40] innocent people
[57:42] suffer but at the end of the story it it
[57:47] always shows that God was in control the
[57:50] entire time
[57:51] amen God allowed Satan to attack job
[57:57] spiritually emotionally and physically
[58:01] amen amen but job kept on serving God

[58:46] with the
[58:47] Lord he has taken the cup of Salvation
[58:51] and he called upon the name of the Lord
[58:56] precious in the sight of the Lord is the
[58:58] death of his

[1:02:44] brother Fury what are you thinking about

[1:02:49] just came forth brother Fury replied are
[1:02:52] you kidding me that's the Thunders he
[1:02:56] was the first to catch the inspiration
[1:02:58] of the seven tunders at the local
[1:03:00] Christian Assembly brothers and sisters

[1:03:26] was in prison and you came to visit me
[1:03:30] serving folks is like serving God
[1:03:34] Galatians 6:10 says therefore as we have
[1:03:37] the opportunity let us do good to all
[1:03:41] people especially to those who belong to
[1:03:44] the family of
[1:03:49] Believers brothers and sisters I've
[1:03:51] spoken to many people this week brother
[1:03:54] Paul just just said that in his cant and
[1:03:57] they told me how brother Fury prayed for
[1:03:59] them and the miraculous took and the
[1:04:02] miraculous took place he prayed for many
[1:04:05] people with cancer and God healed them
[1:04:08] we will never forget the story he told
[1:04:10] us repeatedly about his son Paul's his
[1:04:13] son Paul's girlfriend we remember him
[1:04:16] praying for brother shabz I saw brother
[1:04:19] shabz here this afternoon God raised him
[1:04:22] from the dead ladies and gentlemen
[1:04:24] brothers and sisters before I leave do
[1:04:27] you belong to the family of Believers
[1:04:31] brother Anthony fiori was working at the
[1:04:35] MTA he was such a good worker without a
[1:04:38] college education he became a tough
[1:04:41] manager at the
[1:04:43] mpa though he was a manager and a big
[1:04:47] and a big huno he was still a Christian
[1:04:52] one day while working he saw a man a
[1:04:56] fellow MTA employee reading his
[1:04:59] Bible what did this manager do he
[1:05:04] introduced himself to the fellow worker
[1:05:07] and asked him if he had a revelation of
[1:05:11] what he was
[1:05:12] reading the fellow employee replied
[1:05:15] maybe you can tell me some more about
[1:05:18] what I'm reading about brother Fury
[1:05:21] proceeded to tell
[1:05:22] him about the love of Jesus and how he
[1:05:26] died on the cross for him I can imagine
[1:05:29] brother Theory began to talk to him
[1:05:32] about the rages of sin is death but the
[1:05:35] gift of God is eternal life then then
[1:05:38] brother Fury began to read to him Romans
[1:05:44] 8 and before I leave I would like to
[1:05:46] read some of the some of the verses from
[1:05:48] Romans chap Romans chapter chapter 8
[1:05:52] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:05:54] to them which are Christ Jesus who
[1:05:57] walked not after the flesh but after the
[1:05:59] spirit for the law of the spirit of life
[1:06:02] in Christ Jesus ha made us free from the
[1:06:06] law of sin and death for what the Lord
[1:06:09] could not do in that it was weak through
[1:06:11] the flesh God sending his own son in the
[1:06:14] likeness of sinful flesh and for sin
[1:06:16] condemns sin in the flesh verse 10 and
[1:06:20] if Christ be in you the body is dead
[1:06:23] because of sin but the spirit is life
[1:06:25] because of righteousness but if the
[1:06:27] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[1:06:29] the dead dwell in you he that raised up
[1:06:32] Christ from the dead shall also Quicken
[1:06:35] your mortal bodies verse 17 and if
[1:06:38] children then hears PR of God and join
[1:06:40] he with Christ if so be that we suffer
[1:06:43] with him that we may be also glorified
[1:06:46] together for I reckon that the
[1:06:48] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:06:50] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:06:53] which shall be revealed in US verse 26
[1:06:57] likewise the spirit also helped our
[1:06:59] infirmities for we know not what we
[1:07:01] should pray for as we ought but the
[1:07:04] spirit itself maketh intercession for us
[1:07:07] with groanings which cannot be
[1:07:17] uttered that person that brother Fury
[1:07:20] was talking to at the MTA was brother
[1:07:23] Anthony the Mayo
[1:07:25] brother Anthony De Mayo his wife sister
[1:07:28] Helen de Mayo their daughter Adrian hers
[1:07:31] and their son Larry de Mayo all came to
[1:07:34] accept Jesus Christ as their precious
[1:07:36] Lord and personal savior brother Anthony
[1:07:39] fur we witness to brother Anthony Deo
[1:07:42] and four stars were added to his crown

[1:12:56] thank you Abigail Porsche thank Brother
[1:13:01] Dean like to tell you a few more uh
[1:13:03] things about my dad I think you all get
[1:13:06] to see him mostly on a Sunday but Don
[1:13:08] Lois Unice and I get to be there every
[1:13:10] day and we found out we were clearing
[1:13:13] out some of the things in the house and
[1:13:15] we found out that dad was a poet not
[1:13:17] very often I don't think he ever wrote
[1:13:20] uh something that I said but we found a
[1:13:22] u Timothy's sixth grade graduation book
[1:13:26] you know where everyone writes their uh
[1:13:28] little note so I'd like to read you my
[1:13:31] dad wrote for my brother to two caveats
[1:13:35] we have a dog named Dobby and Dad wasn't
[1:13:38] the best at grammar in
[1:13:41] 1976 so this is a letter from my dad to
[1:13:44] Tim when you was just a little boy you
[1:13:47] had so many ideas you was the first to
[1:13:50] make some toys that gave us many fears
[1:13:53] you seem to be like Dobby we thought you
[1:13:55] were very naughty but you were never was
[1:13:58] much trouble we will love you till
[1:14:00] you're
[1:14:01] 40 you will always be that boy of ours
[1:14:04] so big so smart so kind and when we look
[1:14:07] back at those hours we know we'll always
[1:14:09] find only sweet memories we see that
[1:14:13] time cannot destroy to us you will
[1:14:15] always be our precious little boy
[1:14:17] beautiful beauti
[1:14:26] my dad when he did read poetry eily
[1:14:29] remembered it by heart I want to share a
[1:14:31] couple uh with
[1:14:33] you usually the themes were very simple
[1:14:37] and this one is no
[1:14:42] exception could we with ink the ocean
[1:14:46] fill and where the Skies of parchment
[1:14:49] made where every stock on earth a quill
[1:14:52] and every man a scribe by trade
[1:14:55] to write the love of God above would
[1:14:57] drain the ocean dry nor could the scroll
[1:15:00] contain the hole there no stretch from
[1:15:03] Sky to
[1:15:04] Sky Does anyone hurt my dad Shar
[1:15:07] that that
[1:15:09] phone and I think he loved it because it
[1:15:11] was simple um but I also think he loved
[1:15:14] it because they discovered that that
[1:15:17] line was on the walls penciled on a
[1:15:20] narrow room in insane
[1:15:23] asylum and it was from man that was said
[1:15:25] to be demented and um you know I believe
[1:15:29] my dad believes that if you're
[1:15:31] inspired uh that's all that matters and
[1:15:33] it's a simple poem about the love of
[1:15:39] God Joyce Gilmer wrote a song in
[1:15:43] 1915 called trees does anyone have heard
[1:15:46] that that
[1:15:49] poem so I was here in New York less than
[1:15:52] a month and a half ago and
[1:15:55] I asked my dad what his favorite
[1:15:57] scriptures were his favorite songs his
[1:15:59] favorite poems and he told me this poem
[1:16:01] that he was able to recite it by memory
[1:16:04] from the and he got emotional as he RS
[1:16:08] and apple doesn't fall far from the tree
[1:16:11] hopefully I'll make it through as
[1:16:15] well I think that I shall never see a
[1:16:18] poem lovely as a tree a tree whose
[1:16:21] hungry mouth is pressed against the
[1:16:24] Earth's sweet flowing breast a tree that
[1:16:26] looks at God all day and lifts her leafy
[1:16:29] arms to pray a tree that may in summer
[1:16:32] wear a nest of robins in her hair upon
[1:16:35] whose bosom snow has Lain who intimately
[1:16:38] lives with rain hes are made by fools
[1:16:41] like me but only God can make it
[1:16:46] tree I think Dad loved that PO included
[1:16:50] all the things that he loved number one
[1:16:52] it was
[1:16:53] nature number two it had
[1:16:56] wood and
[1:16:58] trees and it was a subtle message that
[1:17:00] we're all frail and unworthy but God is
[1:17:04] perfect in the fact that he loves us is
[1:17:06] all that
[1:17:09] matters I think that was also uh funny I
[1:17:13] asked John Lois and Unice to all share
[1:17:15] stories and we were all just around the
[1:17:16] table talking about our dad and uh unas
[1:17:21] and ask you to come up here honey unas
[1:17:23] shared her favorite story was that I was
[1:17:26] always the skinny one in the family so
[1:17:29] when Dad bought boxing gloves cuz we
[1:17:31] used to fight all the time when he would
[1:17:32] introduce me he would say the light
[1:17:34] light light
[1:17:38] lightweight introduced me so you share
[1:17:40] that story and the just found something
[1:17:43] about on the internet about D you would
[1:17:45] like
[1:17:50] to he never loed for Praises he was
[1:17:53] never one to the boo he just went on
[1:17:56] quietly working for the ones he loved
[1:17:58] the most his dreams were seldom spoken
[1:18:02] his once were very few and most of the
[1:18:05] time his worries went unspoken too he
[1:18:08] was there a permer foundation through
[1:18:11] all our storms of life a sturdy hand to
[1:18:15] hold on to in times of stress and strife
[1:18:17] a true friend we can turn to when times
[1:18:20] were good or bad one of our greatest
[1:18:22] blessings the man that we call dead
[1:18:36] thank you din John's going to hate me
[1:18:39] but I'll tell the story he remembered
[1:18:41] where he told our dad the first joke
[1:18:44] John I think was a little intimidated by
[1:18:46] uh dad as the youngest child but
[1:18:48] apparently my dad was sharing the story
[1:18:49] of the unfortunate man that died because
[1:18:52] his yard came in and he fell in the sess
[1:18:55] and John said that was a crappy way to
[1:18:59] go and and Dad laugh show sense of
[1:19:04] hum and Lois shared a story we were
[1:19:07] going to pen Harris and uh you know we
[1:19:12] were my dad told us at a time you know
[1:19:14] he's very my dad was very simple you
[1:19:15] didn't play ball on Sunday you going to
[1:19:17] a convention it's not about going to the
[1:19:21] Hershey Park on the way home and we're
[1:19:22] here for church we're here for
[1:19:24] convention so
[1:19:25] you know basically my dad lectured us
[1:19:28] for the whole ride there how don't even
[1:19:31] ask to go
[1:19:32] to so Jonathan and Lois and Joey they
[1:19:35] all nominated me to be the negotiators
[1:19:38] to see if I can soften my dad and go so
[1:19:40] the convention was over and I said I'll
[1:19:43] go over there I'll talk to Dad so I went
[1:19:45] over there and I didn't realize we were
[1:19:47] that close but apparently loest and
[1:19:49] everyone could hear my Dad's reaction
[1:19:51] all they heard was are you kidding me we
[1:19:54] just came back from this most beautiful
[1:19:56] convention you have the nerve to
[1:19:59] has and anyway 20 minute diet fry like
[1:20:02] how ungrateful
[1:20:05] and I
[1:20:08] am told me apparently when I came back
[1:20:11] they were all shoulders down ejected and
[1:20:14] I told you know I didn't know they heard
[1:20:15] the conversation so I said don't worry
[1:20:17] guys I think we have a chance
[1:20:28] and dad was loyal but there's lot of
[1:20:30] things he wasn't right he was not Sports
[1:20:34] lot of football baseball basketball fans
[1:20:37] here and he had no particular team that
[1:20:39] he cared about but it he was loyal to
[1:20:41] New York in general I don't think he
[1:20:42] cared if it was Upstate New York and
[1:20:44] Buffalo or it was the Giants or Deads he
[1:20:47] loved that the New York team would
[1:20:52] win he was also proud to being a Italian
[1:20:55] but I don't think it didn't Define him
[1:20:57] at all and one of the things I heard
[1:20:59] from many of you throughout the day was
[1:21:01] if you came in to the church with long
[1:21:04] hair a
[1:21:06] hippie um an immigrant minority in any
[1:21:10] way there was no he felt better than
[1:21:14] anybody else he greeted everybody the
[1:21:16] same the same
[1:21:22] way he was especially
[1:21:25] loyal to my mom and to his family and I
[1:21:28] could truly say that I've never seen my
[1:21:31] dad and mom fight but Sandy you we
[1:21:34] Sandy he told us a story apparently
[1:21:37] there was a Mother's Day Dad forgot to
[1:21:39] get Mom a Mother's Day card and gift and
[1:21:42] when she called him out on it he said
[1:21:44] well you're not my mom I have I already
[1:21:46] have
[1:21:48] them very very bad
[1:21:54] apparently Sandy saw the only fight they
[1:21:56] ever
[1:21:58] had of course dad was loyal to his
[1:22:00] friends and he especially um loyal to
[1:22:05] God and there was a a favorite song that
[1:22:08] that he also had is Amazing Grace how
[1:22:11] sweet the sound that saved the Wretch
[1:22:14] like Me I once was lost but now I'm
[1:22:17] found was blind but now I
[1:22:20] see how much more simple does it come
[1:22:23] right the song is 250 years old it was
[1:22:26] written by John Newton in
[1:22:29] 1772 and he was a slave traitor that
[1:22:32] converted to Angelic faith and wrote
[1:22:35] that song as a part of the songs that he
[1:22:37] wrote as part of his
[1:22:39] conversion and Dad loved simple stories
[1:22:42] with simple
[1:22:43] themes and with that I've asked a few
[1:22:46] brothers that my dad loved and respected
[1:22:48] if they would be willing to share a
[1:22:50] story or two and I'd like to invite for
[1:22:53] the Norman please come up and maybe
[1:22:55] share a story um difficult for all of us
[1:23:00] it's very emotional you know we love our
[1:23:02] dad be bear bear with us and then
[1:23:04] brother Jonathan I'll have you come
[1:23:06] after brother Norman and then yeah you
[1:23:09] can come up here you go next Norman mind
[1:23:12] brother Norman you start
[1:23:13] first and then brother U
[1:23:17] ail Norman wellton
[1:23:30] bless one and
[1:23:33] all my first encounter with brother
[1:23:37] Fury first I saw me in didn't know
[1:23:42] me I came to love with Christian
[1:23:44] Assembly and before we enter the
[1:23:46] sanctuary there's a sign of door poost
[1:23:48] says be still and know that I am God I
[1:23:52] read that and I walk in the sanctuary
[1:23:55] the first words I can remember himar
[1:23:57] brother FY says there is no such thing
[1:24:00] as
[1:24:01] divorce now how does man know what's on
[1:24:03] my heart now the reason why that was on
[1:24:06] my heart was I just left Pentecost and
[1:24:09] the preacher there was teaching that you
[1:24:11] couldn't divorce your wife and get
[1:24:13] married again watch this the living so
[1:24:16] at the church I went to him and said no
[1:24:17] that's wrong you can't do that he said
[1:24:20] yes this why I understand you can do it
[1:24:22] so that was on Wednesday night service
[1:24:25] Thursday Friday it bugged me so Saturday
[1:24:29] I went took my Bible I went to his house
[1:24:33] and he tells me listen if you come to my
[1:24:35] house to augue scripture don't come here
[1:24:38] he said David Salomon all them had more
[1:24:40] than one wife okay you got me I don't
[1:24:43] understand that okay so I came to the
[1:24:45] message brother brandham says that
[1:24:48] reason why they had more than one wife
[1:24:50] is a type of Christ and his bride around
[1:24:52] the world now now to me when brother F
[1:24:57] said that there's no such in divorce be
[1:25:02] still and know that I'm God what
[1:25:03] manifested to me right there to know
[1:25:06] that this man here don't know what's on
[1:25:08] my heart don't know me and he's come out
[1:25:11] and say that so to me that man has was
[1:25:13] filled with the Holy Ghost and God was
[1:25:15] there God that's my first encounter with
[1:25:19] him now brother Fury he love love the
[1:25:23] stories
[1:25:24] when he's preaching he telling stories
[1:25:27] some people don't like it they call it
[1:25:29] storytelling but for me that is
[1:25:32] testimony amen something that he went
[1:25:35] through now brother Bram I can't
[1:25:38] remember one of his message that he
[1:25:39] never stop and give a testimony or so
[1:25:43] story to me that was
[1:25:45] great okay now I want to read this
[1:25:50] scripture here this is Brother Fury all
[1:25:52] the way it's en TI
[1:25:55] is
[1:25:58] 1539 for this cause that I
[1:26:04] the that thou sh that thou shouldest
[1:26:07] ordain the things that are wanting and
[1:26:11] ordain Elders in every city as I have
[1:26:14] ordained thee if any be
[1:26:17] blameless the husband of one wife that's
[1:26:20] got a fe blameless husband of one wife
[1:26:23] have been hateful children they are
[1:26:27] here not accused of Riot or
[1:26:32] unruly for a bishop must be blameless as
[1:26:36] a steward of God not
[1:26:39] self-will is always about God never hear
[1:26:42] him said me me me it's always the will
[1:26:44] of
[1:26:46] God not soon anger not given to
[1:26:50] Wine Not Striker not given to fil to
[1:26:53] lust
[1:26:54] but the level of
[1:26:56] hospitality that is preder amen again is
[1:27:00] why when you first meet him the way they
[1:27:03] greet you is like they know you for long
[1:27:05] time make you feel so
[1:27:07] comfortable a lover of Good Men sober
[1:27:12] just holy
[1:27:14] tempering holding fast the faithful word
[1:27:17] as he had been taught that he may be
[1:27:20] able by some Doctrine both to sort and
[1:27:25] to convert the gainsayers praise
[1:27:36] God Jonathan
[1:27:38] Coler privilege that he's able to come
[1:27:40] here all the way from
[1:27:48] Germany to the fiori family on behalf of
[1:27:51] the Coler family we want to express our
[1:27:54] AR of condolences to you Paul and John
[1:27:59] Lou and Unice and all the grandchildren
[1:28:04] and those that are married and blood
[1:28:07] related on the homegoing of our precious
[1:28:10] of your precious dad brother Anthony
[1:28:13] fiori and brother stephanus also asked
[1:28:15] me to convey this deep syphony so to you
[1:28:19] God bless you you are in our thoughts
[1:28:21] and you are have been in our prayers
[1:28:24] during this time of loss we know what it
[1:28:26] means to say goodbye to my precious dad
[1:28:31] and brother fiori he has been a close
[1:28:33] friend to my dad brother Sigma cener
[1:28:36] they met I believe in the late
[1:28:38] 970s and they were special friends ever
[1:28:42] since he even came to our home in
[1:28:44] Germany and I believe some conventions
[1:28:47] and they went together in the Alps and I
[1:28:50] remember my mom she was telling me the
[1:28:52] fury one time he was in a store back
[1:28:55] then in the Ops and um they seen he seen
[1:28:59] my parents looking from the outside into
[1:29:02] um the store the little shop and there
[1:29:04] was some very nice two little squirrels
[1:29:08] and by that time my parents really
[1:29:09] couldn't afford any extra so by the time
[1:29:12] we were they were home again brother FY
[1:29:15] handed them the two
[1:29:16] squirels and um those two squirrels are
[1:29:21] actually still in our home wow
[1:29:23] remembering brother Fury his heart of
[1:29:27] given and the same I remember my dad he
[1:29:30] was telling me as it was mentioned with
[1:29:32] a f was an artist that um in his study
[1:29:37] there's two pictures one with uh um
[1:29:41] Jesus and the rich Y buer and the other
[1:29:44] one is actually um Jesus with the two
[1:29:47] disciples to mes and I believe that was
[1:29:50] the template the blueprint I think he
[1:29:54] say of that picture that he painted from
[1:29:57] so again it shows his heart of given um
[1:30:02] all in all they had precious time of
[1:30:04] Fellowship together especially at the
[1:30:07] conventions where they met here after
[1:30:10] year personally um when I think back
[1:30:14] about brother the fury as a young person
[1:30:16] growing up I experienced him as a man of
[1:30:19] prayer his dedication stood out to me
[1:30:23] and as he prayed for the prayer requests
[1:30:27] of the people the Lord answered many of
[1:30:31] his prayers amen amen and many received
[1:30:35] their healing and
[1:30:37] deliverance through his prayers and
[1:30:40] through his ministry amen just in fact
[1:30:42] actually yesterday I met a
[1:30:44] couple and they had expressed how that
[1:30:48] brother through brother Fiori's prayer
[1:30:50] it has helped them to have two healthy
[1:30:52] boys that's right and it's just so
[1:30:54] beautiful to see so many answered
[1:30:57] prayers even today the testimonies come
[1:31:00] back but brother Fury not only had a
[1:31:02] great burden for the healing of the
[1:31:04] Natural Body um of the people but he
[1:31:07] also was concerned about the body of
[1:31:10] Christ I remember in
[1:31:12] 2013 he was um calling my dad or they
[1:31:15] were speaking on the phone together and
[1:31:18] he encouraged him through a quote in the
[1:31:20] message the prophet actually mentions
[1:31:22] that he entered into vision and um he
[1:31:26] heard a voice saying preacher don't fear
[1:31:28] there'll be one one of these days so he
[1:31:30] was also a person that could encourage
[1:31:33] just one another I think the last time
[1:31:36] that um they had Fellowship together
[1:31:38] with in
[1:31:39] 2019 my dad had visited the home of the
[1:31:42] fues and um they were driving around he
[1:31:45] was showing him his new Tesla I just
[1:31:48] wish he could have driven it in the
[1:31:49] German
[1:31:51] highway but I think they both love cars
[1:31:54] I think so nice cars um but he was
[1:31:58] sharing his burden about the healing of
[1:31:59] the body of Christ and they had this in
[1:32:01] common I know that meant so much to my
[1:32:04] dad who had a big burden that the love
[1:32:06] of God will be expressed among the
[1:32:08] children of God I just want to join
[1:32:11] everyone to express our thanks to God
[1:32:14] for a man whose life touched many lives
[1:32:17] around the world and he was a faithful
[1:32:20] true witness to his calling his in his
[1:32:24] influence on our family remains and we
[1:32:29] as a family appreciated him very much
[1:32:32] his humble way his kind way and his love
[1:32:36] to everybody and allow me to to say like
[1:32:40] we say back home in German we say oh Fe
[1:32:43] Us in we'll see you in the morning bless
[1:32:46] you
[1:32:54] thank you brother brother

[1:32:59] to give a little word of testimony about

[1:34:08] felt was the the spirit of Jesus
[1:34:12] Christ we had come out of a
[1:34:16] church where there was
[1:34:19] sin and now we looked at those people
[1:34:24] people whose life was the life of Jesus

[1:38:21] day he walked into the church he was 16
[1:38:23] years old real tough black leather
[1:38:25] bomber jacket his grandmother Anna had
[1:38:29] been praying for him so he came he heard
[1:38:31] the old Italian singing Amazing Grace
[1:38:33] and something got a hold of him he left
[1:38:35] that service changed still tough but
[1:38:37] knowing there was more to his life than
[1:38:38] the streets of Brooklyn I stay still
[1:38:42] stay still tough because weeks later he
[1:38:44] came to her church all dressed up and
[1:38:46] immediately asked the young man
[1:38:48] including me to meet in the men's room
[1:38:50] what could he possibly want so there we
[1:38:52] were brother f St Nino announces that
[1:38:55] his girl was meline high and no one
[1:38:58] better go near
[1:38:59] her don't even Shak her
[1:39:02] hand my older brother and I my older
[1:39:05] brother had inos but suddenly lost it
[1:39:07] after that
[1:39:09] powerful he then said let's go to church
[1:39:11] and enjoy the
[1:39:13] service and we did in ear and trembling
[1:39:16] the rest is history he God
[1:39:18] M so we grew up together young people in
[1:39:21] that Pentecostal Church our foot steps
[1:39:23] were ordered by God he and sister mine
[1:39:26] got married my brother Mario was his
[1:39:28] best man as time passed by Brother Fury
[1:39:31] became the young people's Minister he
[1:39:33] preached in such Simplicity he expressed
[1:39:36] the grace of God in his life and how God
[1:39:38] brought him out of the streets into a
[1:39:40] more meaningful life he wanted to share
[1:39:42] his testimony and help the young people
[1:39:44] to see there was so much more to
[1:39:47] life we once traveled to my uncle's
[1:39:50] Church in faraka away
[1:39:53] um where brother Nino was to speak and
[1:39:57] he spoke as he spoke the toughest gang
[1:40:00] members walked in and they stood there
[1:40:02] in a line defying him to
[1:40:04] continue you know paused he looked them
[1:40:06] straight in the eye and said so you
[1:40:07] think you're tough you're invincible and
[1:40:10] he began to tell them what awaited them
[1:40:12] if they didn't surrender their life to
[1:40:13] Christ he dared them to come forth to
[1:40:16] the Altar and they one by one they did
[1:40:18] he led them to Christ that's how brother
[1:40:20] Fury began his journey and how guard
[1:40:22] placed us together together from our
[1:40:23] youth I saw such compassion in his eyes
[1:40:26] love for
[1:40:27] souls and he made sure he shared it he
[1:40:30] taught the adult class in Sunday school
[1:40:32] and there introduced uh my wife Virginia
[1:40:35] and I to the message of Malachi 4 we
[1:40:37] wanted what he spoke of and the rest is
[1:40:39] history of course he was thrown out of
[1:40:42] that Pentecostal church for introducing
[1:40:44] us to the end time message from there we
[1:40:46] continued to grow both spiritually and
[1:40:48] naturally we met brother Coleman sat
[1:40:50] under his ministry as God did a special
[1:40:52] work in all our
[1:40:55] lives during his years at the church he
[1:40:58] always gave his all and he had an impact
[1:41:01] on thousands of people especially uh me
[1:41:03] and my wife we had a group that brother
[1:41:05] Coleman called the Italian band The
[1:41:07] Furies the Pumas the bomos we had all
[1:41:09] come out of the streets of Brooklyn gave
[1:41:11] our hearts to the Lord and had through
[1:41:13] brother and sister Fury come into the
[1:41:15] message we all had a deep desire to
[1:41:17] serve God and love to tell our story and
[1:41:19] song sister Madden loved the song more
[1:41:22] and more about Jesus and that is what
[1:41:24] brother Fury spoke of as he told those
[1:41:26] precious stories that we all love he
[1:41:28] stood with his Pastor blessed him by
[1:41:31] serving God's people stood by his
[1:41:32] friends and when they needed some help
[1:41:34] he and his wife were there he did the
[1:41:36] little things from cleaning the church
[1:41:38] making communion wine and planning a
[1:41:40] picnic for the less
[1:41:44] fortunate a timely phone call a helping
[1:41:46] hand a few words of wisdom from his own
[1:41:48] personal experiences my wife and I had a
[1:41:51] bad car accident when she was pregnant
[1:41:53] with with our oldest son Joseph both of
[1:41:55] us rushed to the hospital and he came
[1:41:57] and
[1:41:58] prayed then our car was towed and was in
[1:42:02] a repair shop in a rough part of
[1:42:04] Brooklyn I received a phone call that
[1:42:06] the car was stolen well Fury and our and
[1:42:10] I and our wives went to see what
[1:42:11] happened and as we arrived we spotted my
[1:42:13] car some big tough looking men inside
[1:42:17] drinking the fury runs across the street
[1:42:20] opens the door to the driver's side and
[1:42:21] tells everyone to get out this is a
[1:42:23] stolen
[1:42:25] car and they were stunned and they got
[1:42:27] out and he K the car away from
[1:42:30] them some scriptures that come to mind
[1:42:33] concerning brother Fury of Proverbs
[1:42:34] 28:20 a faithful man shall abound with
[1:42:37] blessing and he was blessed and always
[1:42:39] blessed the people who he served but the
[1:42:41] fury leaves a legacy as a faithful
[1:42:43] servant of Christ who gave his all John
[1:42:46] 12:26 If any man serve me let him follow
[1:42:50] me and where I am there shall also my
[1:42:53] servant be if any man serve me him will
[1:42:55] my father honor brother Fury's Works
[1:42:58] followed him and his Heavenly Father
[1:43:00] through every words spoken here tonight
[1:43:02] and unspoken by those who have come to
[1:43:05] honor a man who made a difference in
[1:43:06] their lives and is being
[1:43:10] honored I believe the work is being
[1:43:13] finished tonight as the man I grew up
[1:43:15] with my faithful friend who lifted up
[1:43:18] Christ tonight is being honored for his
[1:43:20] dedicated service and as
[1:43:23] we as one say Well done thou good and
[1:43:26] faithful servant God bless his family
[1:43:27] and may God continue to comfort you with
[1:43:30] these words thank you brother
[1:43:40] bomo so we have a few minutes left and I
[1:43:43] want to uh close by sharing my dad's
[1:43:46] favorite story and I think every one of
[1:43:49] you has probably heard the story
[1:43:53] we we've had this uh painting Lois tells
[1:43:56] me in our house some way back when we
[1:43:58] lived on Castle
[1:44:03] Avenue you know so the story is
[1:44:06] about a violinist and he never he was a
[1:44:10] solo violinist he was playing his first
[1:44:12] big concert and when he goes to the
[1:44:15] concert he does an amazing job and
[1:44:17] everybody stands and gives an amazing
[1:44:20] Applause and standing ovation but you
[1:44:23] know the violinist doesn't stand because
[1:44:25] he's looking up in the balcony waiting
[1:44:26] to see who's there I guess everybody
[1:44:29] pointed and they started getting louder
[1:44:31] and clapping louder screaming bravo
[1:44:33] bravo but he refused to stand and
[1:44:35] finally somebody said who is the guy
[1:44:37] he's pointing to up at the balcony and
[1:44:39] it was the ma the master the person that
[1:44:42] thought in violin and he said you know I
[1:44:45] could fool everybody but I can't hold
[1:44:47] him he's the one that that's right
[1:44:50] that's right talking brother chz earlier
[1:44:53] and he saying I was asking everyone
[1:44:56] please tell me one story something about
[1:44:57] my dad that he remembered and he summed
[1:45:00] it up he said there isn't one story he
[1:45:01] said your dad is a work of a life's work
[1:45:06] it's every day over the course of
[1:45:08] decades that you show people who you are
[1:45:12] it's not
[1:45:13] worth so I'll close to say my dad can
[1:45:17] take about amen amen
[1:45:32] shall We Stand brother
[1:45:35] Kevin on the wings of us
[1:45:39] Snow
[1:45:42] White God sends his pure
[1:45:47] Sweet Love aide from above

[1:46:45] above sing it one more time
[1:46:57] our God is
[1:47:05] pure from
[1:47:11] above on the wings
[1:47:16] of you can be seated a moment
[1:47:23] I have a little
[1:47:24] song U that I asked my brother-in-law
[1:47:27] Paul if I could I could sing which I
[1:47:30] believe kind of
[1:47:31] describes brother Fury's life and
[1:47:35] everything that we've heard so
[1:47:37] far I just want to say Amen to every
[1:47:39] word that was spoken amen and just say
[1:47:42] that my father-in-law was that and so
[1:47:45] much
[1:47:46] more he was a man just filled with the
[1:47:50] love of God and it was an hon honor will
[1:47:53] be called his
[1:47:54] son-in-law and I would say he treated me
[1:47:57] more like a son and as my brother-in-law
[1:48:01] Tim was looking down not a son I like a
[1:48:06] son it's good to know what I'm
[1:48:09] talking but I will tell you a funny
[1:48:11] story before I
[1:48:12] sing so it's more personal um so we had
[1:48:16] gotten married in 1990 so around 1991
[1:48:19] brother Fury loved to
[1:48:21] barbecue and we were uh on Grand Street
[1:48:25] in Westbury and we were barbecuing it
[1:48:28] was just four of us it was my wife
[1:48:30] myself my mother-in-law my
[1:48:33] father-in-law and uh he loved Italian
[1:48:36] sausage so it was the skinny Italian
[1:48:38] sausage we put it on the grill and came
[1:48:42] inside and my piece you know was a nice
[1:48:44] siiz piece but I like it
[1:48:48] burnt so I put it back on the grill and
[1:48:51] uh we he started talking about a half
[1:48:54] hour went
[1:48:55] by my father said I got to use the
[1:48:58] restroom and then he was going to go
[1:48:59] check on the grill and he comes back
[1:49:02] with the tongues in his hand and the
[1:49:04] sausage that was like here was now
[1:49:08] here he said Joey he says God has
[1:49:11] accepted your
[1:49:14] sacri so and we left and we had so many
[1:49:19] so many wonderful moments like that but
[1:49:23] above those natural moments the
[1:49:26] spiritual uh life that he led was very
[1:49:30] influential on my life and um I can't
[1:49:35] say enough about him um so this song
[1:49:38] that I'm going to
[1:49:40] sing is called he touch me and the first
[1:49:45] verse I believe speaks to his coming to
[1:49:49] Christ the second verse speaks to his
[1:49:53] walk with Christ and I believe then
[1:49:56] there's a little part that I eded at the
[1:49:58] end and I'll just relay this one little
[1:50:00] story that my brother-in-law Paul and
[1:50:03] John had shared on the day that he
[1:50:07] passed so he was going
[1:50:09] quickly and at a certain point he turned
[1:50:12] his head and he was looking up and I
[1:50:15] believe at that moment he saw the Angels
[1:50:17] coming for him and just like that he was
[1:50:22] gone
[1:50:23] so the last part of the song when we get
[1:50:25] to that last part of the song it speaks
[1:50:28] about going home I want you to join with
[1:50:30] in with me on the song so God bless you
[1:50:33] and just close your eyes and just think
[1:50:36] on brother Fury As we sing this little
[1:50:55] I was
[1:50:57] sh
[1:50:58] by
[1:51:02] he
