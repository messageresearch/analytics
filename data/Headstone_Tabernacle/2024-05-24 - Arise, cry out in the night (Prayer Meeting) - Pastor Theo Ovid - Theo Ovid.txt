you know if they're sick if they're in despair if they're suffering whatever condition Lord may you deal with their hearts and may you Lord bless them in a special way in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God bless you and welcome tonight to be here and you making the sacrifice to be here this Friday evening to gather in this way that we could talk to the Lord you know God put certain laws and certain principles and laws that if we work with them things will be different you know when we battle and fight God laws and God principles is where problem problem comes about you know God have rain son God have their Seasons e uh summer winter Autumn spring and so on like that and you just have to be able to work with what God put as his laws and these things are to help us these things are to that we could Guided by it these laws and principles and he put these laws and principles in his word so tonight I have two portion of scriptures i' like to read for you tonight and there from Luke chap 6:12 and Lamentations chap 2: 19 Luke chap 6 verse 12 it reads and it came and it came to pass in those days that talking about Jesus that he went out into a mountain to pray and continued all night in prayer to God let me read it again speaking about Jesus it came to pass in those days that he went out into a mountain to pray and continued all night in prayer to God Lamentations chapter 2: 19 it says arise cry out in the night in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord lift up thy hands towards him for the life of thy young children that faint for hunger in the top of every street tonight I have something very small to share with you arise cry out in the night you know just a few moments ago I was thinking about how much people died in the covid-19 season when they had the virus maybe over 7 million people but a lot of people died and I'm thinking that our lives and you are here tonight have been spared and we have a lot to thank God for some people suffered from something called long covid some of them still suffering and but the cycle of God moves on and if God spared us through that whole season of Despair and lock down and everything else that means there has to be some other purpose why we are here on the earth and you are the one to seek to to find that purpose that God put you here for and instead of being upset and angry be grateful and be thankful there are twoo many people that are not grateful and thankful but tonight we want to say arise cry out in the night why would you cry and you know brother Bram labored to show that God's love is not parental love the love we have for our children on our grandchildren our family that is not the type of love that God has God has elective love and he chose you and elected you and that is how he expresses his love to you so whether you are poor or Rich whether you are b or free whether you have or you don't have whether you are young or old sick dying doesn't matter through the mountains through the floods through the fire all come through the blood and it's an expression of God love to us time and chance happen to all men so that you cannot compare yourself with somebody else the opportunities God presented to you was designed for you was ordained for you and is up to you you to maximize the opportunities that God has presented to you I want I say opportunities I'm talking about opportunities to be a better person opportunities to be a better Christian it's not just opportunities in business or in wealth or in money or wealth creation no just like the man with the talents God want increase God don't want to say what you give me I'm giving you back he wants to see if we could multiply if we could add if we could change if we could become horned or polished he want to see Improvement in US it has to start in us now job 4210 says and the Lord turned the Captivity of job when he prayed for his friends also the lord gave job twice as much as he had before now this is a scripture we used a couple of years ago or months ago about what God did for job and how job was blessed look at the sequence of him getting a double portion or getting twice what he had before he prayed for his friends now these friends these so-called friends is the ones that was accusing him of being a secret sinner the same friends who came to comfort him we know the story of Job lost his wealth his children health left to suffer in misery they accuse him of being a sinner what answered job and God and job repented of the words he choose the words he used God rebuked job friends and ask them to make sacrifices and let job pray for them note he couldn't get that double portion or that double blessing on until he had to express forgiveness and compassion of God then God could truly bless job I wonder today when brotherly kindness is positionally placed in that position just before that Holy Spirit SL that love divine SL if God is not waiting for us to show that forgiveness and that compassion it's a great need there but this job experience shows that not because you're wealthy not because you are healthy not because things are working good around you and you are hedged around that nothing cannot change from that God proved that he would keep and preserve those who are faithful and those who trust him God proves that suffering is not always a result of sin but suffering also can be a test of faith and a means by which God get that growth that grow store okay so what God wants from us is a is a relationship you know nobody likes people to come to them just for things give me give me give me I could have this um you you you have extra something I could get it please I could get it you know you you want this you want that but you have no connection you have no friendship you have no fellowship with that person and I think God is about the same we keep asking him for things I want a car I want a job I want a wife I want a husband I want a this I want a that I want all kind of things doesn't matter things but what God is really interested in is relationship why would Jesus pray all night why would Jesus see the need to pray the way he did Jesus if we look at it from a a a holistic distant he was God why did he he even have to pray it it should be or it could be that maybe he didn't have to pray because he was God but he prayed and he didn't just pray he prayed all night Jesus saw in need to pray all night and we'll find out how important that burden of prayer is later on so God want to have a relationship with us and relationship have to do with how we behave towards each other the way people feel towards each other relationship is something that is built you you don't just meet somebody and you know you can you know you have a relationship and no it's it's built you have a close relationship or working relationship um so in that way tonight could be something that you could see a little different that your connection to God tonight or your prayer to God tonight could establish a connection and a relationship with God and that is what God wants um sister salana sent something to meet tonight and I thought it fit to share it with you I didn't ask her permission but I think it should be fine she was saying that she was studying on King David and Saul these two characters and she end up on Samuel and I begin to study Hannah's struggle for being Barren and her love for this child after receiving him that made her giv him back to the Lord the more I think about her struggle and her giving back I know it had to be God now this is powerful because she was Barren and she was being a reproach and she was being ridiculed and mocked and everything else and here it is she got through to have a child and she said Lord if you bless me I'll give this child back to you now selfishness would do the exact opposite selfishness could say the Lord has blessed me this is my child I raising him my way and and I am keeping him for me myself I but not Hanah listen what said you know A love for this child after receiving him made her give him back to the Lord the more I think about her struggle and her giv back I know it had to be God my mind went back to to you hearing say hearing you saying because of Jacob's struggle a nation was born and now here is Han Hanah with her struggle and what an amazing Prophet was given because of her struggle I saw then why God spoke to Jeremiah so highly about Moses and Samuel they had to be really special in God's eyes but over with all that I have learned from these studies my final thought our struggles our battles once we give it back to God it always yields its rewards he always makes all things work out for good God bless you Sana thank you so much much for sharing that with us tonight Lamentations chapter 219 we read arise crowd in the night in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord lift up thy hands towards him for the life of thy young children to cry out I wrote this here is to have an emotional vocalized outburst due to an intense feeling of suffering a great need a cry out for help or relief are crying out of for despair or pain or fear or Joy an uran situation the cry out is a desperate cry Psalms 34:17 says the righteous cry and the Lord hear it and deliver them out of all their trouble so this verse in Psalms tells us the righteous do have troubles the righteous do have issues and the righteous don't stay dumb the righteous cry the Lord heareth and deliver them of all your troubles Psalm 18:6 says in my distress I called upon the Lord and Cried unto my God he heard my voice out of his Temple and my Cry came before him even unto his ear brother Brown when we get to a place till we think we are the only one that God can use we better call a conference God sent Jesus his son to die for every member of the body of Christ Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran catholic whatever they may be they are All God's Children Of Promise all they are going to hear the message if we cool off here we go what are we going to do then we are putting a bad example before them no time for cooling off it is time for warming up and we can't have a warming up till we have a conference an old time Revival that will bring back to Revival fires that will attract attention when Sinners are born into the kingdom of God when men begin to see ill F women ill Fe men Sinners repenting and changing their life going forth making restitutions weeping bringing forth precious sheets the church needs a good case of old time Godly love broadly love we need a conference to hold a conference and speaking about brotherly love the the Bible speaks How could somebody be hungry and you tell them be filled you're giving them the word as opposed to something to eat how come somebody is naked and you're telling them be clothed and you wouldn't seek to get close for them your burden is for no one else if you are selfish your burden and you're thinking just about you and Jesus and we know what was expressed concerning eternal life eternal life is truly living for others eternal life is when you could if somebody ask to go one mile you go two you could go the extra that is what this gospel is about this Gospel of the Kingdom that is what that reflection is about because we are we supposed to reflect the Life of Christ so this Brotherly Love is a serious thing Jesus said by this shall all men know that you're my disciples Jesus said forgive us as we forgive those in teaching them how to pray so it means somewhere along the line that genuine Spirit of forgiveness have to strike the human heart deep not this intellectual flimflam thing you're doing it because um they want me to do it no it has to become something automatic Jesus said father forgive them you didn't curse them they don't know what they're doing know not what they do he did that before he entered into this Resurrection Ministry he did that before he went down into the grave what do we have to do we need charity we need power we need Dynamics and there are steps and there are stages and processes by which we will be positionally placed to really receive this thing Faith here we go this fate rapturing fate fate this fate turn house back to the fate of the father this Fai is based upon forgiveness mix it anyhow shake the vial anyhow cook it anyhow faith is based on forgiveness Faith to be healed Faith to be delivered Faith to be free free to become out your prison free to break barriers is based on forgiveness what have your wife done husband neighbor boss uh coworker family member brother sister mother father it doesn't matter f is based on forgiveness be free tonight disconnect from everything that is ungodly everything that is hateful and anger and get your R up you don't want that you want to keep your spirit pure that's your choice all right let me see I could close up here there was a getson conference there was a conference one day in Babylon whe they should bow to the king you said what the Pentecostal church and all the other churches need tonight is to lay aside every weight the sin that do easily beset us that we might run with patience the race that is set before us we need a conference a universal Prem meting for the Church of the Living God to be called together don't think I am angry or beside myself I know what I speak of the need of the church tonight is a conference a prayer meeting a get together a call together ministers break down their middle wall of partition church members that will forget the differences between the denomination and churches church members and ministers all to the horns of the altar with one Accord note how he say this he didn't say church members hold on to the horns of the altar church members and ministers what is he referring to he's referring to Joel chapter 1 when God said let the ministers hold onto the horns of the Altar and say spare thy people and he said hold to the horns the altar with one Accord and pray until the fire of God begins to fall again so that means the fire of God fell it can fall it will fall again but it is also waiting who's going to pray who's going to cry out listen let me read it church members and ministers hold to the H of the altar with one Accord and pray pray until the fire of God begins to fall again God knows the stubbornness the indifference of men is broke up and godly fear and Brotherly Love Takes its place in the human heart then you become salty stubbornness and indifference my then the message will have the its [Music] in the city almost done God created me a Revival let me be the Revival Let each one of us be the Revival the Revival of me make me Lord to hunger make me to thirst create in me Lord what is needed in me let me from this hour on be dying more consecrated servant a better servant more blessed of you more able more humbler more Kinder more willing to work more looking to the things that are positive and forgetting the things that are past and the negatives let me press towards the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus and this is yeah almost butam said we find one place there where the Son of God spent so much time in prayer and if Jesus had to spend much time in prayer there we go to stay in fellowship with the spirit that was in him how much more do you and I have to spend in prayer much time in prayer if you only knew what time in prayer meant sometimes when you are in prayer listen listen quick don't miss this I'm close God changes the complete destination of different things that's going to happen he said do you believe that might be something fixing to happen and your prayer could change the whole situation well you see if God knows it's going to happen what would my prayer do I'm going to stop here tonight I want I have other things but I want to I want you to take these last words as precious I want you to take it as if what you just heard is what going to happen tonight that God could change the trajectory of your life whether you are shy quiet whether you are defeated whether you are battered whether you are in sin whether you fail you fell or you fall or is falling your cight could change things whether you have been poor father mother poor husband wife whatever you haven't met up to the mark of God and you're fall short which we all have fall short of his gr but tonight like Samson who saw a possibility and he just changed
