[12:58] tonight have your perfect will and way
[13:00] in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen
[13:04] praise
[13:11] God and behold two of them went that
[13:14] same day to a village called Emos which
[13:18] was from Jerusalem about three score
[13:21] fongs and they talked together of all
[13:24] these things which had
[13:26] happened and it came to pass that but
[13:29] while they communed together and
[13:31] reason Jesus himself Drew near and went
[13:35] with
[13:37] them but their eyes were Holden that
[13:40] they should not know
[13:41] him and he said unto them what manner of
[13:45] communications are these that you have
[13:47] one to another as you walk and are
[13:51] sad and the one of them whose name was
[13:54] cleopas answering said unto him art thou
[13:58] only a stranger in Jerusalem and has not
[14:01] known the things which have come to pass
[14:04] there in these
[14:06] days and he said unto them what
[14:10] things and they said unto him concerning
[14:13] Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet
[14:16] Mighty in deed and word before God and
[14:20] all the
[14:21] people and how the chief priests and our
[14:24] rulers delivered him to be condemned to
[14:26] death and have crucified him
[14:31] but we trusted that it had been he which
[14:33] should have redeemed Israel and beside
[14:37] all this today is the third day since
[14:40] these things were
[14:43] done Y and certain women also of our
[14:46] company made us
[14:48] astonished which were early at the
[14:51] seula and when they found not his body
[14:54] they came saying that they had also seen
[14:57] a vision of angels with said that he was
[15:00] alive and certain of them which were
[15:04] with us went to the seula and found it
[15:07] even so as a woman woman had said but
[15:10] they saw him
[15:12] not then he said unto them oh fools and
[15:15] slow of heart to believe all that the
[15:18] prophets have spoken ought not Christ to
[15:21] have suffered these things and to enter
[15:23] into his
[15:25] glory and beginning at Moses and all the
[15:28] prophets he expounded unto them in all
[15:31] the scriptures the things concerning
[15:34] himself and they drew nigh unto the
[15:37] village where where they went and he
[15:40] made as though he would have gone
[15:42] further but they constrained him saying
[15:45] abide with us for it is toward evening
[15:48] and the days is far spent and he went in
[15:51] to T with them and it came to pass as he
[15:55] sat at meat with them he took bread and
[15:57] blessed it and broke
[15:59] and gave to them and their eyes were
[16:02] open and they knew him and he vanished
[16:04] out of their sight and they said one to
[16:07] another did not our heart burn within us
[16:10] while he talked with us by the way and
[16:13] while he opened to us the
[16:16] scriptures praise the name of the Lord
[16:18] may the Lord bless his word and anoint
[16:20] and Inspire to our hearts in Jesus name
[16:23] amen praise the
[16:26] Lord amen so God bless you tonight just
[16:28] a short exhortation before we pray
[16:32] tonight
[16:34] amen
[16:36] glory so earlier in this chapter Luke
[16:39] 24 the sisters had gone to the
[16:42] tomb but did not see the body of the
[16:45] Lord
[16:47] Jesus the Angels had told them he's not
[16:51] here he is
[16:54] risen and the angels reminded them of
[16:57] what Jesus had told them
[16:59] and that on the third day he would rise
[17:04] again and they remembered his words
[17:07] Hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[17:11] Lord and the sisters went ahead and told
[17:14] the news unto the rest of the
[17:17] disciples but guess
[17:20] what their words seemed to them as Idle
[17:25] tales and they believed them not
[17:30] my so right there those Brothers sank
[17:35] into
[17:37] unbelief still overcome by grief and
[17:41] sadness that their precious Lord and
[17:45] Master had been taken and crucified on a
[17:48] cross and was no
[17:52] more maybe they
[17:54] said these sisters are coming here with
[17:57] idle fairy tale
[17:59] thank you sisters but we need something
[18:02] more
[18:03] tangible something more
[18:06] solid something
[18:08] more convincing that we may
[18:12] believe
[18:14] all oh my Lord I miss fellowshipping
[18:17] with him when he was here we felt so
[18:20] comfortable and
[18:22] safe I wish he was still here I miss him
[18:26] so
[18:27] much my
[18:29] and here's Peter he was going through
[18:31] his own issues of denying
[18:34] Jesus he ran down to the tomb by himself
[18:38] with all his mind
[18:40] battles Lord I failed you Lord I denied
[18:46] you he stooped down by the
[18:50] tomb and peeped inside and saw the grave
[18:53] clothed lying in the Tomb but did not
[18:57] see
[18:59] Jesus what is going
[19:02] on what is going
[19:06] on and then coming down now to verse 13
[19:11] two
[19:12] brothers who had heard the news were
[19:16] walking from Jerusalem to a village
[19:19] called
[19:21] EMAs and this was about a s miles long
[19:26] journey was a long walk
[19:29] from Jerusalem to
[19:31] EMAs they too were talking about what
[19:35] had
[19:36] transpired and how they were feeling and
[19:39] so
[19:40] on cleopas and the other
[19:44] brother then Jesus Drew near to
[19:48] them and started to walk with them along
[19:52] their
[19:55] Journey Jesus was walking with them
[20:00] Jesus was listening to them talk about
[20:04] him but
[20:06] somehow they did not recognize
[20:10] him the Bible said Their Eyes Were
[20:13] Holden that they should not know
[20:18] him what a situation to find yourself
[20:22] in here they are talking about Jesus sad
[20:27] that he is gone
[20:29] burden for him longing for him and there
[20:34] he is right there in your midst and you
[20:37] don't know
[20:40] it what a situation
[20:44] amen and this was getting a bit frustra
[20:47] frustrating as it
[20:49] were and Jesus breaks the
[20:54] silence what pity party are you Brothers
[20:57] engaging in
[21:00] why are you so
[21:03] sad cleopas
[21:06] said but haven't you heard about the
[21:08] great prophet
[21:10] Jesus are you a
[21:14] stranger the priests and rulers have
[21:16] crucified him and we had hoped that he
[21:21] was the one who would redeem Israel and
[21:25] who would deliver us all
[21:30] then Jesus rebuked them for their lack
[21:33] of
[21:35] Revelation and he began to preach to the
[21:38] two
[21:40] brothers and he shed light on the
[21:43] scriptures which pertained to
[21:47] himself in other
[21:49] words he was revealing himself to them
[21:53] by the word
[21:57] first later on by
[22:00] manifestation St John 5:9 it says search
[22:03] the scriptures for in them you think you
[22:06] have eternal life and there they which
[22:10] testify of me search the scriptures to
[22:14] find the truth
[22:18] hallelujah didn't Jesus
[22:20] say I will rise on the third
[22:24] day why is are you so slow in heart to
[22:27] believe all all that the prophets have
[22:31] said all that Jesus had
[22:36] said ought not Christ to have suffered
[22:39] then go and enter into his
[22:43] glory so why then do you grieve and
[22:46] suffer in this
[22:48] way why do you do it all of this was
[22:52] explained
[22:56] before and Jesus preached for long while
[23:00] to them from Moses coming right down to
[23:03] that present time Hallelujah Glory
[23:06] somebody say Glory
[23:08] tonight
[23:09] hallelujah
[23:11] amen and while he was
[23:15] talking something inside of them was
[23:22] moving their hearts burned with it
[23:24] within
[23:26] them who is this stranger
[23:30] how is it that he speaks with such an
[23:34] authority such depth of
[23:37] Revelation such Clarity of the
[23:42] scriptures and just about that
[23:45] time they reached the village of
[23:48] emus my glory it was a long Seven Mile
[23:55] journey and Jesus is about to go in he
[23:58] bids them
[24:01] farewell he said thanks Brothers for the
[24:04] fellowship God bless you Brothers God
[24:08] bless you but I must go
[24:12] now but those Brothers knew something
[24:15] was special about this
[24:18] stranger and it was evening
[24:21] time and it was getting
[24:25] late
[24:26] somehow they could not not let him
[24:31] go don't
[24:33] go stay with us abide with us for it is
[24:38] late hallelujah hallelujah the Bible
[24:41] said but they constrained him oh glory
[24:46] to God hallelujah Give the Lord a hand
[24:48] of praise tonight hallelujah hallelujah
[24:51] hallelujah amen
[24:53] glory and this is my title
[24:56] tonight constru rining
[25:01] Jesus
[25:02] constraining
[25:04] Jesus over two months this has been on
[25:07] my heart hunging amen constraining
[25:12] Jesus I know that there are many lessons
[25:14] that can be learned from this passage of
[25:17] scripture Luke 24 but this is the one
[25:20] that the Lord placed upon my
[25:22] heart
[25:24] constraining Jesus
[25:28] don't
[25:29] go stay by me Lord don't
[25:33] go and one songwriter says stay right
[25:38] here with us filling us with your love
[25:42] Hallelujah can we say that tonight is
[25:44] that your desire oh Hallelujah glory
[25:47] amen that's your desire tonight to
[25:50] constrain Jesus
[25:52] Hallelujah and in verse 29 and
[25:56] 30 Jesus carried with
[25:59] them and had dinner with
[26:03] them and they told the
[26:06] stranger can you pray for the
[26:08] food can you bless the meal for
[26:13] us and he took the bread and blessed it
[26:17] and he broke it in a way that only Jesus
[26:23] did and he gave it to them oh glory to
[26:26] God tonight
[26:29] and in doing that he revealed
[26:33] himself to
[26:35] them he revealed himself by the
[26:37] scriptures all
[26:41] along but now he revealed
[26:44] himself by a
[26:46] manifestation by a
[26:48] demonstration by a supernatural
[26:50] manifestation as it will let me just
[26:53] read a quote from the prophet from the
[26:55] message the greatest news flash in
[26:59] history what a title the greatest news
[27:02] flash in
[27:04] history whatam
[27:07] says isn't it
[27:09] strange that it takes something
[27:11] Supernatural to make us understand that
[27:15] it's
[27:17] him teaching itself wouldn't do
[27:22] it he never commissioned the church to
[27:26] teach the word
[27:28] he said go preach the gospel or manifest
[27:32] the gospel Hallelujah and the gospel
[27:36] came not through word
[27:38] only but through Power and
[27:42] demonstration of the Holy Spirit can we
[27:45] say Amen tonight Hallelujah glory glory
[27:51] amen
[27:53] now their eyes were
[27:56] open and they knew it was
[27:59] Jesus and they said did not our hearts
[28:03] burn within us while he talked with us
[28:07] by the
[28:08] way while he opened to us the scriptures
[28:12] hallelujah hallelujah so he he showed
[28:15] them he revealed himself by the word but
[28:18] then now he he did it in a supernatural
[28:20] demonstration
[28:23] amen then he
[28:25] vanished now glory to God
[28:31] and I checked out the meaning of the
[28:33] word
[28:35] constrain and the dictionary
[28:38] said to compel or Force someone to
[28:43] follow a particular course of
[28:46] action say it one more
[28:49] time constrain means to
[28:53] compel or Force someone to follow a
[28:58] particular course of
[29:00] action it reminded me of Jacob and the
[29:04] angel I will not let you go until you
[29:07] bless me he constrained the angel
[29:12] Hallelujah I wonder if tonight somebody
[29:14] will constrain the
[29:16] angel amen I wonder if somebody will
[29:19] constrain the Lord Jesus tonight as he
[29:22] passes
[29:24] by constrain talks about some level of
[29:30] desperation in order to constrain him
[29:33] you have to be
[29:35] desperate constraint talks about some

[32:49] the same
[32:51] yesterday Bram

[32:58] M they walked with you all day you
[33:02] talked to them you expounded the
[33:05] scriptures but they did not recognize it
[33:08] was
[33:10] you then that evening when you made as
[33:13] you would go on
[33:16] by he tested them to see if they were
[33:18] really
[33:19] serious he did as if he was going to go
[33:22] he told them he was
[33:24] going but they constrain you that you
[33:27] should come in and abide with
[33:32] them oh God May the disciples tonight
[33:37] like
[33:39] Copus constrain you to come and abide
[33:42] with us Lord hallelujah hallelujah come
[33:46] and abide with us Lord and when you got
[33:49] in their little place you shut the doors

[34:01] that no one did it just like that they
[34:04] knew it was Jesus hallelujah hallelujah

[34:20] long journey he walked with them all day
[34:24] and then he made out like he was going
