[24:00] hope I could get it from Brother zigma
[24:03] convention in Germany if I could get it
[24:05] I'll share it with you but I think it
[24:07] was a real blessing about brother BR
[24:09] talking about his objective and motive
[24:11] is to point people to Christ not to
[24:14] himself not a group but to point people
[24:16] to Christ I said you could pick it up
[24:18] for me I want to get that part that
[24:20] quotation the objective of the
[24:21] convention I want to read it for you I
[24:23] know it be a blessing to you you see the
[24:25] objective and motive must be right for
[24:28] it to happen just as you have to run the
[24:30] race right for you to correctly get the
[24:32] gold medal amen because if you don't run
[24:35] the race right you'll be disqualified
[24:37] yes sir at the end of the race amen so
[24:39] this is where it come down to the purity
[24:41] of heart sir and Mind and Spirit you get
[24:43] a word just now I'm still waiting I'm
[24:45] still waiting but brandom says I rather
[24:47] be right in my spirit yes and wrong in
[24:51] my Doctrine than to be right in my
[24:54] Doctrine and wrong in my spirit that
[24:57] that would qu in again amen I rather be
[25:00] right in my spirit and wrong in my
[25:04] doctrine that than to be right in my
[25:07] Doctrine and wrong in my spirit you see
[25:09] if you have the right Spirit you can get
[25:10] connected to the right Doctrine but if
[25:13] you have the wrong Spirit you're in
[25:14] trouble big
[25:21] time this is the inspiration for this
[25:23] International summer
[25:25] convention August 7th to 14th the
[25:28] convention is dedicated time of prayer
[25:30] consecration worship speaking receiving
[25:33] the truth in love and being filled and
[25:34] refilled and sealed by the spirit of God
[25:37] l in God
[25:38] promises since many eyewitnesses of the
[25:41] ministry of brother William Branham went
[25:42] on to be with the Lord this zigma the
[25:45] host Pastor I have in my heart to invite
[25:48] still living eyewitnesses of God's
[25:50] Prophet to come and give witness
[25:51] personally of the presence of God and a
[25:54] confirmation of his word and the power
[25:56] of the resurrection of Jesus Christ in
[25:58] this man of God and the things they
[26:00] personally have seen and heard it our it
[26:03] is our heart's desire to experience the
[26:05] very same presence of the resurrected
[26:07] Lord Jesus Christ in our midst as it was
[26:09] Vindicated in brother branham's meeting
[26:12] there will be holy ghost filled
[26:13] ministers and the body of Christ to
[26:15] minister under the holy spirit let us
[26:18] pray that the bright promises will be
[26:20] preached in such a way that the Holy
[26:22] Spirit may give to the hungry Hearts
[26:24] such instructions such an experience
[26:26] that they will know perfectly how to
[26:29] submit and take a hold of God's promises
[26:32] and how to let the word promise then
[26:35] flow through the Born Again sinless
[26:36] nature to defeat the
[26:38] enemy we therefore in defeat the enemy
[26:42] God said I will restore the faith again
[26:44] in the last days God is sending the Holy
[26:46] Ghost in such a way upon planted wordu
[26:48] that it will restore therefore Co invite
[26:51] you to this convention and please give
[26:53] the invitations to your brothers and
[26:55] sisters especially to our young people
[26:57] in the church
[27:00] May the following quotes Express the
[27:02] attitude and vision for this convention
[27:04] and this is what I want to
[27:05] read this is Brother brand not for one
[27:08] moment do I bring a message to the
[27:10] people that they may follow me or join
[27:14] my church or start some fellowship and
[27:19] organization I have never done that and
[27:22] will not do that now I have no interest
[27:26] in those things
[27:29] but I do have an interest in the things
[27:33] of God and people and if I can
[27:36] accomplish just one thing I will be
[27:39] satisfied the one thing is to see
[27:42] established a true spiritual
[27:46] relationship between God and
[27:49] Men wherein men become New Creations
[27:53] Creations in Christ filled with his
[27:56] spirit and live according to his word I
[27:59] would invite plead and warn all to hear
[28:04] his voice at this time and yield your
[28:06] lives completely to him even as I trust
[28:10] in my heart that I've given my all to
[28:12] him God bless you and may his coming
[28:15] Rejoice your heart this is Brother brand
[28:17] I'm speaking for the church ages
[28:19] Hallelujah we need a
[28:21] conference a universal pray meeting for
[28:24] the Church of the Living God to be
[28:26] called together and this is the last
[28:28] quote I believe it's coming to a time
[28:31] till when the saints will get together
[28:33] like this and just a l spirit will sweep
[28:36] over the audience and every person in
[28:39] dear all that is wrong will be taken out
[28:43] it will be such a presence of the Holy
[28:44] Spirit and I believe it's coming a Time
[28:47] see all this is prophecy I believe it's
[28:49] coming a time when God's church is going
[28:52] to be called out like that that's he use
[28:55] that's the word he Ed called out like
[28:57] that where the Saints will set together
[29:01] and the Holy Spirit will just come in
[29:04] and just woo just like it was on the day
[29:07] of Pentecost and just heal the people
[29:11] and raise up the people and great things
[29:14] I begin to see it happen it's the love
[29:16] of God we'll be standing preaching like
[29:18] this talking and just love will settle
[29:22] over the building this is from God keeps
[29:24] his word hallelujah that why it's very
[29:26] important for you to understand and hear
[29:28] God's promises amen because God is God
[29:32] if you didn't understand that God said a
[29:35] rain was going to flood was coming and
[29:37] Noah's day you was going to miss the ark
[29:39] you have to hear what God promised amen
[29:42] not what you feel and what you think
[29:44] because you could feel certain things
[29:45] about certain scriptures but it may not
[29:47] apply to your age or your time or your
[29:50] season suppose you feel led to apply
[29:52] blood right now and kill a goat kill a
[29:54] lamb and and put the blood you feeling
[29:55] led by the spirit that is a different
[29:58] spirit because that was for Moses time
[30:01] God's word for you now is not to take
[30:03] blood literal blood and apply it on the

[32:14] have fuss with me because I struck so
[32:16] hard at organization it isn't the people
[32:18] in there I'm striking at it's that

[33:19] when Jesus come and the see Jesus with
[33:20] this one and that one and all kind of
[33:22] Sinners and Jesus and Jesus to bust them

[53:12] you but I'll be with you even in you
[53:15] come on now we're looking for a church
[53:17] that going to be anointed of God
[53:28] [Applause]
[53:31] SE am a man amen amen cannot sin until
[53:37] he first cast aside God's word amen amen
[53:40] amen until first he gets rid of the word
[53:43] of God the presence of God he cannot sin
[53:47] that why David said the Lord is at my
[53:49] right hand I shall
[53:51] not be moved let me say it again he said
[53:55] the Lord is on my right right hand I
[53:57] shall not be moved in other words David
[53:59] used to be practicing the presence of
[54:01] God that the Lord is with him amen cuz
[54:03] when people feel the Lord not there they
[54:04] want to do this they want to do that
[54:07] they want to do that they want to do
[54:08] that because the Lord he's not he's not
[54:10] seeing but David said the Lord is not
[54:12] mine right hand I Shall Not Be Be Moved
[54:16] oh
[54:17] hallelujah hallelujah that's why the
[54:20] Bible says in the mouth of two or three
[54:22] Witnesses let everything be established
[54:25] so you can't just take a report about
[54:27] someone and there's no evidence or
[54:29] Witnesses you'll be receiving an evil
[54:31] report isn't that right that's why if
[54:33] somebody offend you or something don't
[54:35] go and tell somebody go to that person
[54:37] Amen suppos to misinterpret them amen
[54:39] like I give a reference one time you can
[54:41] see somebody come out a bar with some
[54:43] water or something some bottle and next
[54:45] the report come he was in the B drinking
[54:47] you didn't see him drinking that's right
[54:49] man that's but that's the report but the
[54:52] person car May broken down and they went
[54:54] to get some water to put the radiator
[54:57] but because it was seen that way and
[54:59] instead of verifying information
[55:00] somebody run with that and next minute
[55:02] he was drinking he was drinking and see
[55:03] him coming out the bar that's assumption
[55:06] that's come saying like everything in a
[55:08] garage is a car but suppos a lawn
[55:13] more the four wheels it was in the
[55:17] garage that don't mean a car all right
[55:21] so you can't just take things like that
[55:24] you have to have a a love for
[55:29] truth
[55:31] Hall I want to say it again you have to
[55:34] have a love for
[55:36] truth not gossip not banal not just talk
[55:41] for truth because the truth is what sets
[55:44] people
[55:48] free
[55:51] Hallelujah but I come to give a
[55:53] testimony about the woman with the frro
[55:56] and he didn't finish it off he finished

[1:00:47] group in the sense then that God has set
[1:00:50] no church up there's no certain
[1:00:51] organization or group could say we have
[1:00:53] it the rest of them doesn't have it
[1:00:55] that's Spirit you

[1:02:19] amen
[1:02:22] hallelujah all
[1:02:24] right when Jesus came on the scene God
[1:02:27] always vindicates the truth that's the
[1:02:30] reason today we can't have faith faith
[1:02:31] is not based upon man's theology faith
[1:02:34] is based upon the solid rock of God's
[1:02:36] Eternal Word before I continue I want to
[1:02:39] say back something we talk about right
[1:02:41] spirit and wrong Doctrine better than
[1:02:45] right Doctrine and wrong Spirit that's
[1:02:47] true but God did s a prophit for us to
[1:02:49] have right spirit and wrong Doctrine
[1:02:52] amen he s a prophet that we can have the
[1:02:53] right spirit and right Doctrine I want
[1:02:57] to nail that down so I'm not advocating
[1:02:59] this right Spirit right Spirit no no no
[1:03:01] no no God s a prophet with thus sayth
[1:03:05] the Lord and that Prophet said the
[1:03:07] spirit the bride and the prophet will be
[1:03:10] saying the same
[1:03:13] thing and what they say will have
[1:03:16] already been said in the
[1:03:19] word it you can't take away from it it's
[1:03:22] th say the
[1:03:23] Lord hallelujah
[1:03:27] Hallelujah so watch so Jesus a
[1:03:30] carpenter's son physically speaking when
[1:03:33] he came to the Earth here he was known
[1:03:35] of the day that John baptized him God
[1:03:38] Vindicated him God spoke from the
[1:03:40] heavens John saw him coming down in the
[1:03:42] form of a dove and said this is my
[1:03:44] beloved Son in whom I am pleased to
[1:03:47] dwell the right translation here is in
[1:03:49] whom I am pleased to dwell
[1:03:53] in Jesus
[1:03:56] immediately Anointed with God amen amen
[1:04:00] amen amen he was just a man till that
[1:04:04] time but now he becomes a God
[1:04:09] man
[1:04:11] right so the anointing of God brings you
[1:04:14] to become God a God man amen hallelujah
[1:04:18] you see God is a spirit and Christ means
[1:04:22] the anointed one a man Anointed with
[1:04:27] god oh give the Lord some praise His
[1:04:33] people and just as a man could be
[1:04:35] Anointed with God a man could be
[1:04:37] Anointed with the
[1:04:40] devil listen to
[1:04:43] this Jesus was God he had a big job he
[1:04:45] went over to theic in gadara who has
[1:04:48] been a wild man for years a young fellow
[1:04:50] we were told had lost his human
[1:04:52] reasoning lived in tombs with an evil
[1:04:54] spirit what a place for man to live in a
[1:04:56] graveyard is very fitting for the devil
[1:04:58] to be among dead
[1:05:00] things so he lived out there and was so
[1:05:02] terribly Afflicted with these demons he
[1:05:05] broke chains his strength was here we go
[1:05:08] a super
[1:05:10] strength did you ever see a man that had
[1:05:12] been stricken by the evil spirit like
[1:05:14] that he is several times his strength
[1:05:17] yes I have noticed them in the meetings
[1:05:19] when groups of police couldn't even hold
[1:05:21] them they would tear them police to
[1:05:24] pieces and carry on on because here why
[1:05:28] he is fully surrendered to the evil one
[1:05:31] that's right it took possession of him
[1:05:34] and had not his own understanding he
[1:05:36] only did what the evil spirit put in him
[1:05:39] to do then I taught with complete
[1:05:42] surrender to the devil a man can be five
[1:05:46] times his
[1:05:47] strength what could complete surrender
[1:05:52] to
[1:05:54] God doe to to a man what would it do to
[1:05:58] that's weak in the body that
[1:06:01] can't walk if we could completely yield
[1:06:04] to the Holy Ghost God will give us a
[1:06:07] super strength to rise in the name of
[1:06:10] Jesus greater is he that's in you that
[1:06:13] he's in the world the strength of God
[1:06:15] that's in you is greater than any
[1:06:17] Affliction that can come upon you there
[1:06:20] is nothing can overtake you but you're
[1:06:22] going to supersede it because you are
[1:06:25] full of
[1:06:26] superpower and that superpower is the
[1:06:28] holy spirit that dominates your
[1:06:32] life if you are a
[1:06:36] Christian
[1:06:38] oh
[1:06:39] Hallelujah that mean everybody in here
[1:06:42] could be healed every sick person here
[1:06:45] can get a touch from Heaven you could
[1:06:47] shake it off
[1:06:51] [Applause]
[1:06:53] yes you may be seated
[1:06:56] oh
[1:06:58] Hallelujah
[1:07:00] my and
[1:07:02] Jesus he was not part God he was all God
[1:07:06] he created the winds the waves if other
[1:07:08] things had to obey him he was the
[1:07:09] creator notice let us remember he also
[1:07:12] created our
[1:07:15] bodies he create winds he create waves
[1:07:17] he create Seas he create fishes and he
[1:07:20] created our
[1:07:21] bodies let man come from the dust of the
[1:07:24] earth and God formed man first was a
[1:07:26] spirit man Genesis 1 then a dust man
[1:07:29] Genesis 2 and God put the spirit man in
[1:07:31] the dust man that's you and I here this
[1:07:34] morning Hallelujah so he created our
[1:07:37] bodies just as he create fish and moon
[1:07:39] and stars and everything else hear the
[1:07:42] spot won't our bodies have to obey him
[1:07:47] yes come on now come on now help me
[1:07:49] somebody oh Hallelujah so now he's
[1:07:52] coming on to power over self
[1:07:56] that's why when the spirit hit Jesus he
[1:07:58] was he went into the willingness to
[1:07:59] overcome the lust of the eyes overcome
[1:08:01] the lust of the flesh overcome the pride
[1:08:03] of life because before God empowers a
[1:08:05] man with full power he has to be able to
[1:08:07] overcome
[1:08:09] himself no
[1:08:12] excuses oh give the Lord a
[1:08:15] shout that's nothing but that's gospel
[1:08:18] that's nothing but the truth people
[1:08:20] looking for power and have no character
[1:08:22] no power for them
[1:08:29] Hallelujah why you think God holding
[1:08:30] back power not because God stingy and
[1:08:33] God P hard to
[1:08:35] get hard to give he's holding back power
[1:08:38] like you know you seen characters now
[1:08:40] without power what they behave how they
[1:08:41] behaving much if they get power on top
[1:08:43] of that they behave
[1:08:45] worse oh Hallelujah that prime minister
[1:08:48] as president all time in opposition the
[1:08:50] one way so as they come in power they
[1:08:52] change a different cap fit the head
[1:08:55] Hallelujah that's man all about the poor
[1:08:58] the struggling the
[1:09:00] scrun and some blessing come around them
[1:09:02] they on top the world if rainfall they
[1:09:05] drun the nose up in
[1:09:06] [Music]
[1:09:09] a and God looking for somebody the more
[1:09:11] God blesses the more humble they become
[1:09:14] the more you could bow my God because
[1:09:17] God was so great he humbled himself and
[1:09:19] came to us and God want you to live that
[1:09:21] out praise God do you believe that so
[1:09:25] what he created our bodies won't our
[1:09:26] bodies obey him you surrender your
[1:09:28] thoughts to him you surrender your life
[1:09:30] to him you surrender your faith to him
[1:09:32] and watch that body obey what he says if
[1:09:35] you a drunker and you can't quit
[1:09:37] drinking surrender the life to him and
[1:09:39] what you will drink no more if you are
[1:09:42] habitual smoker and try to give it up
[1:09:43] and can't do it Just Surrender that to
[1:09:45] him and Watch What Happens he will make
[1:09:48] that body come in subjection to the word
[1:09:52] oh Hallelujah but you have got to
[1:09:54] surrender it to him
[1:09:56] but people worship the spirit upon them
[1:09:58] praise God sometime people don't even
[1:10:00] want prayer because they want to
[1:10:01] continue what they're doing so they
[1:10:03] don't really want no Deliverance they
[1:10:05] really don't want no breakthrough they
[1:10:06] know it's right they know Church nice to
[1:10:08] go to and they will come and get blessed
[1:10:10] but they don't really want that
[1:10:11] breakthrough yet because they have the
[1:10:13] things to do they have the friends to
[1:10:15] keep up they have the places they want
[1:10:16] to go and this cost for a price he say

[1:21:01] say
[1:21:02] it
[1:21:04] man is
[1:21:06] omnipotent you don't believe that but he
[1:21:12] is but here the fine print of that
[1:21:17] statement the fine print a
[1:21:20] man fully surrendered to God
[1:21:25] is
[1:21:28] omnipotent oh give the Lord some Praises
[1:21:32] that's my subject a
[1:21:33] [Applause]
[1:21:34] man fully surrendered to God is
[1:21:39] omnipotent and when
[1:21:41] omnipotent
[1:21:43] speaks the

[1:22:14] statement for a person to make and I
[1:22:16] want to give you in this manner you
[1:22:18] think of yourself now your Methodist
[1:22:19] Baptist Pentecostal or whatever you are

[1:22:23] we believe that Jesus rose from the dead
[1:22:26] this same man that makes the challenge
[1:22:27] that time I said you can't prove one
[1:22:29] thing that there is a God outside the
[1:22:34] supernatural for when omnipotent speak
[1:22:37] the miraculous take place omnipotence
[1:22:40] can't speak without being miraculous
[1:22:44] amen so how can a man
[1:22:46] claim to be fully surrender to God and

[1:37:41] the caterpillar pmer my great Army you

[1:37:45] never be ashamed now it says God is
[1:37:47] going to restore the Lutheran age didn't
[1:37:49] restore the church it started the
[1:37:51] Reformation isn't that right what now
[1:37:54] this very moment we are in the complete
[1:37:55] fulfillment of Matthew 24:24 in so much
[1:37:58] if it possible receive the very elect
[1:38:01] and who is it that they attempt to
[1:38:02] deceive the very elect the spirit of the
[1:38:04] Antichrist in the false anointed one in
[1:38:07] the last days these false one have
[1:38:09] already come in Jesus name claiming that
[1:38:11] they have been anointing of God for this
[1:38:12] last day they are false Messiah anointed
[1:38:15] ones they claim they are prophets but
[1:38:18] they are one with the word never they
[1:38:20] have added or taken from it no no one
[1:38:23] denies that spirit of God manifesting
[1:38:25] his gifts upon them but like bam they
[1:38:28] all have their programs make their appe
[1:38:30] for money exercise gifts but deny the
[1:38:32] word and bypass it for fear that the
[1:38:34] controversy might diminish their chances
[1:38:36] for greater gain yet they preach
[1:38:37] salvation and deliverance through the
[1:38:39] power of God like Judas with a Ministry
[1:38:42] impacted by Christ but because they are
[1:38:43] wrong seed consequently they have the
[1:38:46] wrong Spirit motivating them watch this
[1:38:50] part I want to get to they outshine the
[1:38:52] elect in effort and zeal
[1:38:53] but it is ludian not of Christ for it
[1:38:56] looks for big crowds big programs
[1:38:58] startling signs among them they preach a
[1:39:00] second coming and so forth but deny the
[1:39:02] Advent of a prophet messenger though in
[1:39:05] power and signs and true Revelation
[1:39:06] eclipsing them all yes here this part
[1:39:09] this false spirit in the last days is so
[1:39:11] close to the real can be distinguished
[1:39:14] here we go only by its deviation from
[1:39:18] the word amen amen not by anointing not
[1:39:23] by shouts not by jumping not by singing
[1:39:25] not by specials not by worship but by
[1:39:28] deviating from the word from the word
[1:39:31] that's why we say the prophet and the
[1:39:33] bride and the spirit says the same thing
[1:39:36] and what they say will be already in the
[1:39:38] word are you with me watch they can
[1:39:42] distinguish only by it division from the
[1:39:44] word and whenever it is caught in being
[1:39:46] anti- word it falls back on one argument
[1:39:49] we already are shown to be false we get
[1:39:51] results don't we we have to be of God
[1:39:54] God because we get results oh my oh my
[1:39:58] are you with
[1:40:00] me watch watch God had called Moses he
[1:40:04] didn't want to go those prophets had
[1:40:06] things it was hard thing to do they
[1:40:09] didn't want to be going out and be scorn
[1:40:11] that they want to have fellowship and go
[1:40:12] to the rest of them I don't want to do
[1:40:14] this but God has spoken and I must
[1:40:16] deliver it whether it like it whether
[1:40:17] they crucified him whether they stoned
[1:40:19] him whatever it is God has spoke to his
[1:40:20] heart obedience is better than sacrifice
[1:40:23] watch it was in his heart he must do it
[1:40:27] it was his life he couldn't hold it
[1:40:29] there was something here we go a
[1:40:31] pulsation that pushed them they couldn't
[1:40:33] bless or curse it God had so much
[1:40:36] complete control of them till he was
[1:40:38] their voice their action these prophets
[1:40:43] so look at Elijah Elijah said not even
[1:40:45] rain or DW will fall till I call Fair
[1:40:49] amen he shut the heavens could you
[1:40:51] imagine a man doing that amen shut the
[1:40:54] heavens not even due or rain will fall
[1:40:56] till I call for it these guys were so
[1:40:59] Anointed with God that their Word was
[1:41:03] God
[1:41:05] hallelujah then B prophesy give me a
[1:41:07] church that so completely Anointed with
[1:41:10] god Till there every action and move is
[1:41:13] dust say the Lord walk in that CH kind
[1:41:15] of Glory I will show you a messiah
[1:41:18] anointed one of God standing upon on the
[1:41:20] Earth today oh hallelujah oh brother
[1:41:23] give me a church full of the Holy Ghost
[1:41:25] God will do in one year what all
[1:41:27] theology fail to do in 2,000 years you
[1:41:29] wait till the annointing of the church
[1:41:32] strikes home to that Faithful Little
[1:41:34] Remnant after the doors of the Gentile
[1:41:36] is closed God will anoint his church
[1:41:39] then he is filthy be filthy still who
[1:41:41] rightous rightous still oh my what a
[1:41:43] time oh my oh my oh my hallelujah amen
[1:41:49] hallelujah so praise God so Joseph was
[1:41:52] giving a quote of of Many Colors and the
[1:41:54] Brethren hated him he came to bring them
[1:41:57] peace but they misunderstood him they
[1:41:59] hated him without a cause they didn't
[1:42:01] try to stop to see what he was trying to
[1:42:03] achieve they just judge him because
[1:42:06] listen he didn't agree with them amen
[1:42:09] say do agree with them they judge you He
[1:42:12] makes himself so and so and so and so
[1:42:13] look at Moses he couldn't help TR
[1:42:15] himself there he didn't do it
[1:42:17] hypocritically when God tell Moses get
[1:42:19] away there I'm going to destroy the
[1:42:20] people Moses put himself in the Gap and
[1:42:22] said Lord before I destroy them for me
[1:42:23] amen mes wasn't play acting you know
[1:42:26] Moses was looking for photo shoot you
[1:42:28] know he was genuine Spirit of Christ in
[1:42:31] him said before you take them people
[1:42:33] take me first it was the spirit of
[1:42:35] Christ in Moses oh Hallelujah are you
[1:42:39] with me he never did it for self Glory
[1:42:42] watch if they would have looked to the
[1:42:45] word they would have seen his purpose he
[1:42:47] will always do that to glorify the
[1:42:49] father neither will any servant of God
[1:42:51] take Glory neither would any servant
[1:42:53] take the gift of God and try to glorify
[1:42:54] himself I want to read that again a
[1:42:57] servant of God will not take Glory
[1:42:59] neither would any servant of God take a
[1:43:00] gift of God and try to glorify himself
[1:43:04] the spirit of God working in men make
[1:43:09] men act like God no wonder Jesus said is
[1:43:13] not it written here gods that is small G
[1:43:15] not Big G and if they are called God to
[1:43:18] whom the spirit of God came to how can
[1:43:20] you condemn me when I say I'm the son of
[1:43:22] God they were Gods come on G because
[1:43:25] here what here here why here why here
[1:43:27] why because they had completely
[1:43:29] surrendered themselves to the spirit of
[1:43:32] God and they were working for the glory
[1:43:34] of
[1:43:35] God David said you come with me in
[1:43:38] shield and spear but I come to you in
[1:43:39] the name of the Lord hallelujah he had
[1:43:41] the right objective he had the right
[1:43:43] motive isn't that right so when a man is
[1:43:47] Anointed with the spirit now let us go
[1:43:49] real deep under the fifth rib on the
[1:43:51] left side when a man are you ready
[1:43:55] everybody alive amen everybody up when a
[1:43:58] man is so Anointed with the spirit when
[1:44:01] a man is Anointed of the spirit of God
[1:44:03] his habits his actions and everything is
[1:44:07] moving in him sometime he's
[1:44:11] misjudged look at David David say my God
[1:44:13] my God why forsaken me that was the
[1:44:15] spirit of Christ in
[1:44:17] David and when you read in Psalm how
[1:44:19] could David say that it was the spirit
[1:44:22] saying my God my God somebody said
[1:44:24] listen that hypocrite up there who hands
[1:44:25] is pierced who feet is pierced that's
[1:44:27] the intellectual but one what
[1:44:29] discernment of spirit would know that
[1:44:30] was the spirit of God in him crying out
[1:44:33] when a man is Anointed Here We Go Again
[1:44:36] of the spirit of God he has got the
[1:44:38] action of God hallelujah are you ready
[1:44:42] and the action of God is never to break
[1:44:44] us up
[1:44:46] amen the action of God is to draw us
[1:44:49] together for We Are One in Christ Jesus
[1:44:53] Jesus God's purpose is to bring us
[1:44:55] together to love one
[1:44:59] another do you get that the action of
[1:45:02] God is not to break
[1:45:04] up break up husband and wife break up
[1:45:06] families break up churches break up this
[1:45:08] break up that they not the action of God
[1:45:10] the action of God is to bring
[1:45:13] together Hallelujah he is making a bride
[1:45:16] he is Hing the chips now chopping off
[1:45:18] the world watch he's cutting you down
[1:45:20] now cutting you down to his word only
[1:45:23] cutting all the Creeds and dogmas and
[1:45:24] everything away from you trying to get
[1:45:26] back a bride for the son another
[1:45:28] Masterpiece part of the word how could
[1:45:30] you become bride you have to cut shave
[1:45:33] shape you to be his bride you can't come
[1:45:35] up with your old your own self he wants
[1:45:38] to cut the church out just like he cut
[1:45:40] the Sun out like he did the bride and
[1:45:42] groom to be his bride you must be part
[1:45:45] of him you must leave the world you amen
[1:45:48] praise God hallelujah butam he wants a
[1:45:51] masterpiece today are you willing are
[1:45:53] you ready my Christian friend are you
[1:45:55] really sure that your life is so
[1:45:57] reflecting of for Christ no matter what
[1:45:59] the world say you have lost your mind
[1:46:01] you're going crazy you went and joined
[1:46:03] the church of Holy Rollers don't pay
[1:46:04] attention to that if you're not truly
[1:46:07] saved in that body and the word of God
[1:46:09] in you and reflecting itself and the
[1:46:11] life of Christ reflecting out of you
[1:46:13] brother sister don't take that chance
[1:46:15] and don't care what you are what an
[1:46:17] experience you have let that will
[1:46:19] reflect through you each day because God
[1:46:22] in this last day is taking a bride for
[1:46:24] his son Jesus Christ not a church for
[1:46:27] his son a bride for his son and that
[1:46:30] bride is made up of members who are part
[1:46:32] of him who is part of that word so you
[1:46:35] could never get fight with the word
[1:46:37] because you are going to be the word
[1:46:39] itself so when the word hit you you can
[1:46:41] only say Amen that word is you you are
[1:46:44] part of that word isn't that right so
[1:46:48] therefore he give birth to the tree on
[1:46:50] the day of Pentecost isn't that right
[1:46:51] Luke 24:49 and do it power from on high
[1:46:55] and there he give birth to the tree the
[1:46:57] Holy Ghost Pentecost justification

[1:47:03] forth the fruits fruits justification
[1:47:06] sanctification baptism Holy Ghost then
[1:47:08] the person of the Holy Ghost comes in
[1:47:11] that to bring forth the fruits oh my so

[1:47:19] and what God keep doing cutting them off
[1:47:22] they produce a Branch Methodist Branch
[1:47:24] Pentecostal Branch he keep cutting it

[1:51:29] faith of God believ in God isn't that
[1:51:31] right so but brandham was passing
[1:51:33] through a field that had a killer Bull
[1:51:37] and that killer bull is just a title for
[1:51:38] bull M killer but his name is not killer
[1:51:41] because he killed before so he have
[1:51:46] reputation and brother Brown forget that
[1:51:49] killer was in that field and he leave
[1:51:52] his gun back and so on he's walking
[1:51:53] through the field let's continue I
[1:51:55] turned first I fell for the gun it
[1:51:57] wasn't there I'm glad it wasn't I'll
[1:52:00] probably killed the bull and paid for it
[1:52:03] I felt for the gun it wasn't there I
[1:52:06] looked at the fence it was too far for
[1:52:08] me there was no trees around for me to
[1:52:10] get to there was nothing but to face
[1:52:12] death I said Lord if the time has come
[1:52:15] for me to die I want to face it like a
[1:52:17] man so I showed my shoulders down I said
[1:52:20] if this is it if I must die by this bull
[1:52:22] then I must die and something happened
[1:52:25] amen amenallah am I know this sound like
[1:52:29] a child but it's the truth
[1:52:33] somehow instead of despising that Beast
[1:52:37] I had a love for
[1:52:38] it and I thought that poor thing laying
[1:52:42] out in the field I come in on his
[1:52:45] territory I disturb him he don't know no
[1:52:48] more than to protect himself he threw
[1:52:50] his horns up dug the dirt up fell into
[1:52:52] his knees you know what they do before
[1:52:54] they charge and I told that animal I
[1:52:56] feel so sorry sorry I disturb you I said
[1:52:59] you going to talk to animal now now
[1:53:01] remember what God tell Adam right have
[1:53:02] power over animals and the Beast of the
[1:53:04] field and everything else this is God
[1:53:06] talk Adam that this is Genesis and this
[1:53:09] is a man the 20th century in a field
[1:53:12] with a bull and this is what is
[1:53:14] happening and I said I'm sorry to
[1:53:16] disturb you I don't want to kill you I'm
[1:53:18] a servant of God I'm on my way to pray
[1:53:20] for sick people I forget about the signs
[1:53:23] I was talking just like them now and
[1:53:24] there was something another had happened
[1:53:28] something has happened now so going up
[1:53:29] now I wasn't scared of
[1:53:32] him I was no more afraid of that bull
[1:53:35] than I would my
[1:53:37] brother aha so first something happened
[1:53:42] he's had to love the B and then
[1:53:43] something happened again no fear you
[1:53:46] ever see a little child with a dog or
[1:53:48] any
[1:53:49] animals no fear when a big man will
[1:53:52] front from a big dog the child will walk
[1:53:54] straight up to that dog no fear good
[1:53:57] when the Bull made his charge to come to
[1:53:59] me he come within 10 ft and he stopped
[1:54:04] threw his feet out he looked so depleted
[1:54:07] he looked this way that way he turned
[1:54:09] went right back around and laid down and
[1:54:12] I walk oh no no sorry sorry um
[1:54:16] Hallelujah that is where the church is
[1:54:18] you're always scared it's not going to
[1:54:20] happen that's the reason it don't
[1:54:23] happen when fear love cast out fear when
[1:54:27] you got love fear is gone but as long
[1:54:30] here we go there's a bumb as long as you
[1:54:32] got fear love cannot
[1:54:35] operate
[1:54:38] Hallelujah as long as you are
[1:54:41] fear love cannot operate so B had spoke
[1:54:47] to the bull and tell the bll go back and
[1:54:48] sit down and so on right and the Bull
[1:54:50] made his charge look depleted and he
[1:54:52] turned and went right back around laid
[1:54:55] down there where he got up at I walk
[1:54:57] across the field went out the pasture he
[1:55:00] laid there look at me it was love that
[1:55:02] took the faar away and God seen me
[1:55:05] through now H the next part after I got
[1:55:09] out the
[1:55:10] pastor and that left me I was shook like

[1:55:28] shaken like a leaf

[1:55:33] that fear had
[1:55:36] left what was it the anointing of
[1:55:40] God when I come upon him he's a
[1:55:43] different man what is he a God
[1:55:48] man a man just like Adam amen let's
[1:55:52] continue oh my so B says here

[2:09:47] just that that prayer will not be
[2:09:48] answered in other words you're wasting
[2:09:50] time
[2:09:52] get cracking and get it clean
[2:09:55] up don't mean to rebuke anybody that's
[2:09:57] up to you it's something you got to do
[2:09:59] they that overcome will inherit all
[2:10:00] things they that overcome you have power
[2:10:02] to do it but you must be willing to lay
[2:10:04] it down she has made herself ready you
[2:10:08] see God could not push you through a
[2:10:10] pipe and pull you out on the other side
[2:10:11] and say blessed he that overcome it you
[2:10:14] had nothing to overcome he just push you
[2:10:16] through but you have got to make
[2:10:17] decisions for yourself I had to make
[2:10:20] decisions for my myself and in doing
[2:10:22] that we show our faith and respects to
[2:10:25] God oh hallelujah praise God but God is
[2:10:30] the creator living in you giving you all
[2:10:32] the power and you are in possession of
[2:10:34] anything that he had so it is in you to
[2:10:36] abstain from Evil to do good to shun
[2:10:39] evil to flee to righteousness to walk
[2:10:41] away from temptation all malice hatred
[2:10:43] Strife envy and so forth come away from
[2:10:45] it for it takes him from your heart oh
[2:10:49] Halle dear brother sister if you haven't
[2:10:51] got the Bap of Holy Ghost this morning
[2:10:52] run into the kingdom of God as quick as
[2:10:55] you can oh hallelujah hallelujah the
[2:10:58] disciples had power but didn't have
[2:11:00] faith to move the power and that's what
[2:11:01] the matter with the church today the
[2:11:03] people today is not a lack of power no
[2:11:05] it's a lack of faith to move the power
[2:11:07] what is it you have got to get the word
[2:11:10] and watch you have got to get with the
[2:11:12] word and get yourself killed out I am
[2:11:15] persuaded that many of us friends here
[2:11:17] we go have received the Holy Ghost but
[2:11:19] we receive enough Holy Ghost ghost to
[2:11:21] make us to a place where we don't want
[2:11:23] to lie we don't want to steal we don't
[2:11:25] want to do anything but God wants to
[2:11:28] fill every fiber of his church he wants
[2:11:31] to fill your thinking he wants to fill
[2:11:33] your mind he wants to fill a bit of you
[2:11:36] so if you watching movies movies movies
[2:11:38] what chance God have to put anything in
[2:11:40] your mind because you caught up in that
[2:11:42] movie world you caught up in that
[2:11:44] magazine world you call it in that Noel
[2:11:46] world and God have no place to inject
[2:11:48] himself but as you die out and all the
[2:11:50] no had move this way the movie start to
