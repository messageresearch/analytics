[30:36] special greetings to real brother Theo
[30:38] Ovid his wife family and the headstone
[30:41] tabernacle
[30:42] I thank brother Theo for inviting me to
[30:44] say a few words to the convention I
[30:47] believe the time of life it's perfect
[30:50] inspiration relative believe this pride
[30:53] is right now in her time of life my
[30:57] little thought tonight to share with you
[31:01] with you all praise the lord god bless
[31:03] you all
[31:04] it's from Exodus 23 2009 dan angel
[31:09] before you to keep you in the way and to
[31:12] bring you into the place which I have
[31:14] prepared wow talk about God's grace he
[31:18] has sent an angel yes with Malachi for
[31:22] the angel of the Lord and he has
[31:26] prepared a place for us and I do believe
[31:29] that the manifestation of the Holy
[31:31] Spirit is that angel as never left the
[31:35] bride praise God and it's nothing else
[31:38] but God's grace we don't need no man's
[31:41] GPS because we have God's GPS the angel
[31:45] knows the way to the rapture he knows
[31:48] the way to the supper of the Lamb
[31:51] hallelujah I know the way to the
[31:53] resurrection amen hallelujah and this is
[31:57] being that this is God's grace this is
[32:00] his attitude towards us because we take
[32:04] this promise and we we take it present
[32:09] tense because everything we read this
[32:12] present tense of course and we see that
[32:15] it's God's attitude towards us the bride
[32:18] so in return God wants to see our
[32:22] attitude
[32:23] praise God towards his grace towards
[32:26] what he has done for us
[32:29] that's why verse 21 beware of him and
[32:32] obey his voice do not provoke him for he
[32:34] will not pardon your transgressions
[32:37] for my name is in him but if you will
[32:40] obey his voice and do all that I speak
[32:44] is he speaks through that angel amen
[32:47] which is manifested in a five for
[32:50] ministry fission's praise God Ephesians
[32:53] four praise God
[32:54] I speak then I will be an enemy to your
[32:59] adversaries for my angel will go before
[33:03] you and bring you listen to this bring
[33:06] you to a flower betta bees no bring you
[33:11] to the amorite and the jebusite and all
[33:14] the ice
[33:15] you see testing hard trials yes amen
[33:19] being rejected and despised and bring
[33:23] you to a Gethsemane amen bring you to a
[33:27] Calvary Calvary first and then to the
[33:31] rapture oh praise God bring you to
[33:35] perfect weakness I do believe that this
[33:39] angel is now leading every member of
[33:42] this bride into a state of perfect
[33:46] weakness he's taking care of all be
[33:50] myself and I in you and I you see the
[33:54] Prophet says Lord more of you in me and
[33:58] less of me in me and that's it you see
[34:03] the bride has to learn that she is
[34:05] nothing and I believe that she's
[34:07] learning it right now
[34:09] and he's taking us of course to to a
[34:14] Calvary like I said and we have the
[34:17] promise of a squeeze and right now we
[34:21] see a pandemic we never thought we would
[34:24] see a pandemic like this but I believe
[34:27] that God has everything under control
[34:29] that is for our good everything works
[34:32] together for good to those who love God
[34:35] praise God so I do believe that it's
[34:38] nothing else but God's grace grace was
[34:41] before the law during the law and after
[34:45] the law that's brother branham's words
[34:48] and I do believe that this Ephesians
[34:51] that he has led us to will bring a
[34:55] perfect bride she has the staff the Lord
[34:58] she keeps still and she had learned she
[35:02] has learned to wait on him and they that
[35:05] wait upon him shall renew their strength
[35:07] so perfect weakness will bring perfect
[35:10] strength which will be nothing which is
[35:13] nothing that we have ever done but
[35:17] totally His grace so may God be with
[35:21] every one of you as we're waiting on him
[35:24] as we're taking were taken to Calvary
[35:28] Gethsemane first in Calvary and then to
[35:32] the rapture may the Lord bless you
[35:35] richly in a many many men you appreciate
[35:40] that god bless you hallelujah let's get
[35:44] a lot of shout of praise amen amen

[40:43] Scripture sin looks on in 30 so
[40:50] 24:36 2:45 and that's one one two three
[40:54] say Luke 7:30 written is wise even those
[40:58] shall it be in the day when the Son of
[41:00] Man is revealed and seen Luke 24:36 2:45
[41:04] and as they don't speak Jesus himself
[41:08] stood in the midst of them and shear
[41:10] them to them peace be unto you but they
[41:13] were terrified and have fried it and
[41:15] suppose that they had seen a spirit and
[41:18] he said unto them why are you troubled
[41:20] and why do the thoughts arise in your
[41:22] hearts behold on my hands and my feet
[41:24] that is I myself
[41:26] handle me and see for a spirit had no
[41:29] flesh and bones as sashimi had and when
[41:32] he had thus spoken he showed unto them
[41:34] his hands and his feet and while they
[41:37] yet believed not for joy and wondered he
[41:40] said unto them have ye here been him it
[41:44] and they gave him a piece of a broiled
[41:46] fish and an honeycomb and he took it and
[41:49] did it before them and he said unto them
[41:52] these are the words which are speaking
[41:54] to you while I was yet with you that all
[41:57] things must be fulfilled which were
[41:59] written in the law of Moses and the
[42:01] prophets and the Psalms concerning me he
[42:04] had been speaking to them this is the
[42:06] son of man I've been speaking to them
[42:08] revealing them to them unveiling the
[42:11] mysteries of the Old Testament that's
[42:14] what he's referring to right here he's
[42:16] bringing back all those mysteries in his
[42:20] resurrection ministry for 40 days while
[42:23] he speak to them concerning the things
[42:25] of the kingdom of God
[42:28] verse 44 rich again and he said unto
[42:31] them these are the words which are
[42:32] speaking to you while I was yet with you
[42:34] that all things must be fulfilled which
[42:37] were written in the law of Moses and the
[42:39] prophets in the SAMS
[42:40] concerning me then open here they are
[42:43] understanding that they might understand
[42:45] the scriptures
[42:49] - one verse 1 to verse 3 before my
[42:53] traders arrived mirror with your
[42:54] philosopher that Jesus began but to do
[42:56] and teach on to the day in which was

[43:00] Ghost had given commands unto the
[43:02] Apostles whom he had chosen to whom also
[43:04] he showed himself alive after his
[43:06] passion by many infallible proofs been
[43:08] seen of them forty days and speaking of
[43:11] the things pertaining to the kingdom of
[43:13] God
[43:14] no not especially no his early works
[43:18] god bless you and trust that wherever
[43:24] you're watching from a trust that the
[43:26] blessing of God has been with you and
[43:27] you have had a great time in the
[43:29] meetings and the griffon about you know
[43:32] the virtual convention is that everybody
[43:34] can attend even those who are denied II
[43:37] would not be entry in that everybody can
[43:39] attend so we thank God for this blessing
[43:41] in everything we think we give God all
[43:43] the queries because the Bible says all
[43:45] things work together for good to them
[43:47] that love God why they called according
[43:50] to his purpose so we thank God and we
[43:53] bless them for everything I want to send
[43:56] my greetings to you know the believers
[43:58] are watching from everywhere and also to
[44:01] the pastures and the managers and the
[44:05] believers you know from everywhere who
[44:07] are watching and especially to my
[44:11] mentioned brethren who also spoken the
[44:13] means and those who are yet to speak
[44:15] god bless you and thank you for your
[44:17] ministry and thank you for your blessing
[44:19] your messages and the blessing you have
[44:22] been done through the years
[44:23] god bless you so I'd like to take a
[44:25] little thought there's seven sales with
[44:28] chief and I know brother feels
[44:32] inspiration is the chime of life and
[44:35] speaking about the chime our lives I
[44:37] would like to look at it from the
[44:38] context of the harvest and because the
[44:41] harvest and the time of life are very
[44:43] closely intertwined as a matter of fact
[44:46] they are one and the same thing because
[44:49] in the harvest
[44:51] that's when food is brought forth I'm
[44:54] one a footage but for that's sick time
[44:57] that's fruit sick time and also the time
[45:02] of life is very much the same thing
[45:04] because some of life is also about
[45:06] fruitfulness see time also harvest time
[45:11] that's when all of the life that's in
[45:15] the shot get into the seed in order the
[45:19] receipt can go back to original
[45:22] condition so you can become like this
[45:24] seed that was planted because in the
[45:26] harvest
[45:26] you don't expect something different you
[45:31] plant a a corn seed you expiry currency
[45:35] and the consid your planet you expect
[45:38] the same thing at the harvest the only
[45:42] difference is you get so much more you
[45:44] don't plant one conceed and they get one
[45:45] policy you get one constant I get so
[45:48] much more conceit but the integrity the
[45:51] quality of the seal is the same thing so
[45:52] what you planted is what you are going
[45:56] to get at the cabbage and all of the
[45:58] life that's in the seed comes in so that
[46:00] at harvest time while you planted the
[46:03] seed goes back to original condition
[46:05] again so that the seed you're harvesting
[46:08] is exactly the same set as you planted
[46:11] so
[46:13] the harvest time and the sum of life I'm
[46:18] speaking about that but the bumps it on
[46:19] the masterpiece page probably 166 on
[46:24] 168th he said now at harvest time the
[46:26] series back to his original life back to
[46:30] the Bible but I won six feared harvest
[46:33] and the city's back to its original
[46:34] condition so some of life speaks of
[46:37] harvest time and harvest time speaks
[46:38] about some of life they are one of the
[46:41] same thing is the time when all of the
[46:43] life gets into the sea and this it goes
[46:45] back to original condition goes back to
[46:48] original seed green that can be
[46:51] harvested now speaking about the harvest
[46:53] Works tells describes and defines the
[46:56] harvest the following ways is the season
[46:59] for gathering in agricultural crops
[47:02] number two is the act or process of
[47:05] gathering in a crop three in might or
[47:09] crop of grain or fruit
[47:12] for the quantity of a natural product
[47:15] gathered in a single season 5 the
[47:19] product or reward of Accession those are
[47:23] the different definitions that works as
[47:24] give the harvest I'm sure there are so
[47:27] many other editions we can give for this
[47:29] capture the harvest is not for us so
[47:32] from all of this we can gather that the
[47:33] harvest is a gathering time here at noon
[47:37] time is it my drawing time the time of
[47:39] joy the time of hope the time of Plenty
[47:42] the time of increase is the time of
[47:44] fruitfulness now speaking about the
[47:46] harvest this edge here or below recent
[47:50] church age spiritually speaking is the
[47:52] harvest age of all the ages because they
[47:56] the recent church age is the end of the
[47:58] church ages and so it's the harvest age
[48:01] jesus said the harvest is the end of the
[48:05] world is an insane Matthew 13 verse 39 I
[48:08] believe so the ladies nitrogen is the
[48:10] harvest age is the gathering age of the
[48:13] church edges when dough will gather up
[48:16] and harvest all the seeds that he has
[48:18] planted all down through the ages
[48:21] the whole eastern church age
[48:24] the ripen time is maturing time is the
[48:27] gathering time of all the ages when all
[48:29] the seats will be gathered together and
[48:31] taken back to their father's home and at
[48:36] the same time what God is doing his
[48:37] garden off you sit together there's
[48:39] gonna be a gathering of all the tears
[48:41] are uniting together you gather together
[48:44] of all the tears that I've been planted
[48:47] from the beginning since the gonna be
[48:49] done and Jesus captured this so well in
[48:50] the parable of the wooden tears in st.
[48:53] Matthew chapter 13 the wheat and the
[48:56] tares leave them all let them go
[48:58] together another end go see our sin is
[49:00] angelic Reapers and they shall separate
[49:02] the wheat from the tears the tears they
[49:05] shall gather to be burned on the width
[49:08] they shall gather into the father's arm
[49:12] gana so in this harvest of God's great
[49:15] plan and program for the human race God
[49:19] is gonna harvest his own crop the wheat
[49:22] and take them into his gana
[49:25] the same gana that Jesus Adam the early
[49:28] bright malik al for the Kim Arif and
[49:31] that's this same gana that this endtime
[49:35] bright was the bread of all the ages is
[49:37] trusting to be gathered back into and at
[49:41] the same time like I said already the
[49:44] other crop the tears go will gather them
[49:46] into bundles to be burned in the
[49:48] Tribulation Period so we are the in time
[49:50] they harvest the tamil life
[49:55] so if Larissa is the harvest age
[49:59] then must be a time of life it is a
[50:03] harvest age
[50:05] it's our life then must be an age of
[50:08] life
[50:11] the venom said he said Alicia this is
[50:14] the age of personal life and that's what
[50:18] the blood of Jesus Christ is interested
[50:20] in the personal life of Jesus Christ to
[50:23] get that life into their person to the
[50:27] bin that's what the blood is about so
[50:30] you get the life the personal life of
[50:32] Jesus Christ not he gets another man's
[50:34] life and they gather past his life the
[50:36] minister's life
[50:37] the daddy's life nobody's life but the
[50:40] personal life of Jesus Christ and the
[50:43] blood of Christ understands that the
[50:44] whole essence of the gospel of Malachi
[50:46] first message this endtime message that
[50:49] we so believe in that the prophet
[50:51] brought preached and lived and
[50:53] manifested the essence of it is an
[50:57] invitation to the life of Jesus Christ
[51:00] we have been invited to meet the life of
[51:02] Jesus Christ we have been invited to add
[51:03] the like the behavior of Jesus Christ
[51:06] every single day of our lives and that's
[51:11] what the promises that when the personal
[51:14] life of Jesus Christ is for Satan and
[51:17] manifested by the Holy Spirit in the
[51:20] flesh of this bride then at that time
[51:24] she becomes the Word made flesh she
[51:29] becomes like the original seed she
[51:32] becomes back to the original grain
[51:37] that can be harvested that can't be
[51:40] taken back to the father's Ghana
[51:43] taking in the rapture checking back to
[51:45] the Garden of Eden
[51:47] the Bramson on the message
[51:50] how can I overcome he said this is the
[51:53] age of life the personal life of Jesus
[51:56] Christ so we thank God to understand
[51:59] that there is here is the interpersonal
[52:01] life is the charm of life is the harvest
[52:05] age so we thank God to be here to have a
[52:08] knowledge and understanding of this face
[52:12] that the prophet taught us and to know
[52:14] what our promise is what we are looking
[52:15] for so we can leave every day with
[52:18] expectation on the anticipations knowing
[52:21] that God he will keep his word now if
[52:27] this is the harvest age then there's
[52:29] going to be a famine there's going to be
[52:31] a hospital man and God is the great
[52:34] husband man in this harvest who walks
[52:37] through the feast in the harvest time
[52:40] looking at the crops and when he sees
[52:44] the first ripen crop he plucks it just
[52:48] like Boris did in the story of Ruth in
[52:50] the Bible
[52:51] Boris the kinsman redeemer while he was
[52:54] on the way to redeeming Ruth Nami and
[52:58] Ruth walk through the harvest fields in
[53:02] Bali season in Bali harvest now in the
[53:06] Old Testament barley harvest what
[53:09] happened there now we gotta get some
[53:12] historical context here some
[53:14] understanding here of the nation and the
[53:16] Land of Israel because Israel climate is
[53:19] quite moderate
[53:21] there to harvest seasons each year in
[53:24] Israel one in the fall one and the one
[53:28] in the spring firstly and then the other
[53:30] one in the fall barley harvest takes
[53:32] place in the spring and with harvest
[53:35] follows in the fall now what happens
[53:40] sign of the harvest in Bali harvest the
[53:42] husbandmen walks through the fields and
[53:45] in going through the fields looking at
[53:48] the crops and when he sees the first
[53:51] ripened grain he plucks up the first
[53:54] ratman green that he has and according
[53:55] to their law given to them by God he
[53:58] takes their wrap and green to the high
[54:00] priest who takes that green wrap and
[54:03] green and offers it on his behalf before
[54:06] the Lord for his acceptance
[54:10] as a sign that the harvest is here
[54:12] number one and number two as a sign that
[54:15] the there are more crops coming in the
[54:19] harvest the wheat harvest that's coming
[54:22] on very shortly thousands follow
[54:26] and the Israelites could not eat of the
[54:28] fruit from the harvest on to the Mideast
[54:30] offered so that this was the the Bali
[54:34] harvest was the the the firstfruits from
[54:41] their the harvest and they had to lock
[54:43] that to take the high priests
[54:46] if they don't do that they are not to
[54:48] eat from the fruit of the harvest
[54:50] themselves
[54:52] and so God had the Jewish nation his
[54:54] chosen people signify and type out this
[54:58] events of the harvest by the third and
[55:00] fourth feast of Jehovah of course
[55:05] the Old Testament God had spoke the
[55:07] prophet Moses and gave instructions for
[55:10] Israel through their generations to
[55:12] observe seven feasts and these seven
[55:15] feasts represent amends so many things
[55:18] for the nation of Israel and of course
[55:20] means so many things for the Christian
[55:21] believer down through the ages and
[55:23] especially in this age here now the
[55:26] feast of Jehovah the Feast of the Lord
[55:28] and you find that in Leviticus chapter
[55:31] 23 the feast of Jehovah
[55:36] as follows number one the feast of
[55:39] Passover number two the feast of
[55:42] unleavened bread number three the fist
[55:44] of will ship or the feast of firstfruits
[55:48] that's the Bali harvest a number for the
[55:51] feast of with loaves or the feast of
[55:54] Pentecost
[55:56] there was which harvest a number five
[56:00] was the Feast of Trumpets number six the
[56:03] feast of atonement and number seven the
[56:05] feast of tabernacles now we're not
[56:07] getting to that but if you look at this
[56:09] fish here it captures the whole story of
[56:12] the nanofy of position of Israel from
[56:15] their deliverance in Egypt from sleep in
[56:18] Egypt to their entry into the promised
[56:20] land and if you go along the line this
[56:23] some fish typed so many things the tab
[56:27] represented so many things down through
[56:29] the Bible down through the ages
[56:32] especially this selfish type Redemption
[56:35] this selfish type the seven spirits of
[56:37] God this seven feasts of a low tide the
[56:41] seven companions of Jehovah this some
[56:44] fish type the seven churches and so many
[56:46] things that excite but our focus is on
[56:50] the third and the fourth fish of Jehovah
[56:55] which were the fish of the first fruits
[56:58] which was the wave sheaf
[57:01] to represent Valley harvest and the
[57:03] fourth feast was the fist of the wit
[57:07] loose which represented with harvest
[57:09] which is also called the feast of
[57:11] Pentecost now this third and fourth
[57:14] freeze was separated by a period of 50
[57:17] days when the turn of Israel obviously
[57:19] when they are Patek of the feast of
[57:23] firstfruits and the feast of Pentecost
[57:25] which is the barley harvest and wheat
[57:27] harvest they are separated by a period
[57:29] of 50 days
[57:31] now there are several types of the Bible
[57:33] of these two fists that we can type this
[57:37] - three - through the scriptures and the
[57:40] church edges now we can speak about this
[57:42] - fishing so so many different types
[57:45] barley harvest wheat harvest Bonnie
[57:47] harvest with others and is so very many
[57:50] things that it's up to the Bible
[57:52] because we understand that the Bible the
[57:54] Word of God is a book of symbols and the
[57:57] way the Bible is reading like what the
[57:59] Panem taught us is in love later that
[58:01] like a man who is in love the woman who
[58:03] writes to her and other people just
[58:07] really perfunctory lady just Rudy's from
[58:09] his office but the woman who is reading
[58:10] to can look at the typical read in
[58:13] between the lines and that's what God
[58:16] the way God has designed the water God
[58:18] for his children is beloved is bright
[58:20] because the fact that there are so many
[58:23] types and shadows in the Bible gives the
[58:26] Bible a death gives the Word of God it
[58:28] did give it give it give gives a
[58:30] profundity that the natural eye cannot
[58:34] see but with spiritual eyes you can look
[58:38] into the Word of God and see deeper
[58:40] meanings beyond what the natural eyes
[58:43] can see and that's what type in the
[58:45] scriptures does for the believer and so
[58:49] but the Benham said here or a quote it
[58:52] is the rising of a son whatever you want
[58:55] is there a lot you read a little
[58:56] scripture here for you I'd like for you
[58:58] to turn to another scripture a girl
[58:59] wrote on here it might help you a little
[59:01] he's fine in the book of Liberty calls
[59:03] the 23rd chapter the 9th to the 11th
[59:07] verse that's this same scripture I just
[59:09] referred to speaking about the seven
[59:12] feasts of Jehovah about Brahmaji find
[59:15] true this fish here look at what he said
[59:17] listen close in the law the Levitical
[59:20] law God speaking to Moses listen all
[59:23] these things are types now I will stop
[59:27] here for a few moments to get into this
[59:30] type and it's type in a certain way and
[59:32] I'm typing in a certain way also and
[59:35] there's so many types down through the
[59:38] Babel because Balaam said God doesn't
[59:40] reveal his mystery full but down through
[59:43] the ages down through the Scriptures he
[59:45] has revealed his mystery through
[59:48] different types and shadows down through
[59:51] the Bible and through the ages so barley
[59:54] and wheat harvest let's look at a few
[59:56] types here
[59:59] our first type the fists of waved sheath
[1:00:03] spoke of Jesus Christ the firstfruits of
[1:00:06] the residue remember in Bali harvest the
[1:00:09] husband won't walk through the fields
[1:00:11] and the first crop that come to maturity
[1:00:13] it clogged it and to be dehydrates and
[1:00:16] Jesus Christ represented that to the
[1:00:19] believer in God's great grant program of
[1:00:22] redemption Jesus was the width I mean
[1:00:25] was a work shift the first fruit of the
[1:00:27] resurrection the first one to come out
[1:00:30] from the day the first one to raise from
[1:00:32] the dead
[1:00:33] the will shift the Bali harvest and
[1:00:40] they stab Jesus at his resurrection
[1:00:43] because he rose from the dead and become
[1:00:45] became the firstfruits of the
[1:00:48] Resurrection when the firstfruits like
[1:00:52] the husbandmen took it to the to the
[1:00:55] high priest like the phosphorus Jesus
[1:00:57] was waved before the Lord for our
[1:01:02] acceptance when he rose from the dead
[1:01:05] and Mary met him Mary wanted to touch
[1:01:09] him he said no Mary I got to appear
[1:01:10] before my father first
[1:01:12] don't touch me Mary I've got to ascend
[1:01:14] to my father and your father my god and
[1:01:18] your God my Lord and your Lord
[1:01:21] don't touch me Mary because he had to be
[1:01:23] presented before the Lord for our
[1:01:25] acceptance before he could come
[1:01:30] I'm Minister to his children in those 40
[1:01:34] days of his resurrection ministry
[1:01:37] resurrection represented the feast of
[1:01:40] firstfruits or barley harvest so you may
[1:01:45] ask the question why did he need to be
[1:01:48] waived
[1:01:49] for the same reason that the
[1:01:52] first-fruits was waved in the Old
[1:01:54] Testament he need to be waved in order
[1:01:58] number one two reasons number one in
[1:02:01] order that the Christian Church that
[1:02:02] this kinsman redeemer had died to redeem
[1:02:05] may be accepted in the beloved he had
[1:02:09] done the job father I have done the job
[1:02:11] have finished a walking game etude to do
[1:02:13] that they might be accelerating the
[1:02:15] beloved and number two he had to be
[1:02:18] waved for his sign that the Christian
[1:02:21] church that he died to redeem was soon
[1:02:23] coming into view and exactly that's what
[1:02:27] happened because fifty days later on the
[1:02:29] day of Pentecost the Christian Church
[1:02:31] started coming to view when he was waved
[1:02:34] over the people
[1:02:37] the predestiny received by the holy
[1:02:40] spirit the holy spirit waved him over
[1:02:43] the people in the Marriott calling of
[1:02:45] the holy ghost in the feast of Pentecost
[1:02:47] and that Christian should Derek died to
[1:02:50] redeem started coming into view that
[1:02:54] Feast of Pentecost that happened exactly
[1:02:56] 15 years after his resurrection that
[1:02:59] represented the Feast of the wave moves
[1:03:02] the wit habit the fourth feast of
[1:03:06] Jehovah
[1:03:08] so get the picture let's recover be the
[1:03:11] focus of Jehova barley harvest
[1:03:13] represented Jesus Christ the firstfruits
[1:03:16] from the resurrection and when he rose
[1:03:19] from the dead
[1:03:19] that was Bally harvest the firstfruits
[1:03:22] presented before the Lord for acceptance
[1:03:27] for a sign that the Christian Church
[1:03:30] that dr. Aydin is going to come forth on
[1:03:32] fifty days later the second are the four
[1:03:37] fish the fish of whipped loaves the
[1:03:41] wheat harvest after barley harvest wheat
[1:03:43] harvest follow through on the fiftieth
[1:03:45] day after his resurrection the Babson of
[1:03:48] the Holy Ghost pour into the Christian
[1:03:50] Church to give birth to that church and
[1:03:53] that was the waving in over the people
[1:03:57] so it was with before the Lord and was
[1:03:59] weaved over the people
[1:04:02] Bramson the rising of the sun bhagavaty
[1:04:04] for the shift which was the first of
[1:04:06] your seat that you planted when it comes
[1:04:08] up and ripened you cut down this ship
[1:04:11] and take it to the priest and let him
[1:04:13] take it and wave it before the lot for
[1:04:15] your acceptance that you are accepted
[1:04:17] you have come with your ship and used to
[1:04:19] wave it the hat trick is to wave it
[1:04:22] before the Lord program idiot noticed it
[1:04:26] was the form of God's wit that had been
[1:04:29] raised on the dead
[1:04:31] Jesus God's foreskin of wheat by God's
[1:04:34] quick clean power gotta quick in his
[1:04:37] life reasonable from the dead and he was
[1:04:40] the frost foot or those that select the
[1:04:42] first fluid he was that shift that's why
[1:04:46] they had to waive that shift for him for
[1:04:49] it was the first one that come to
[1:04:51] maturity he was the first son of God
[1:04:54] that come to maturity after Adam fell by
[1:04:57] sin in the Garden of Eden and he was
[1:05:00] waived as a memorial of thanks given to
[1:05:04] God believing that the rest of them
[1:05:08] would come it was a sign so that's why
[1:05:12] he had to be waived
[1:05:13] I'm before we go on let's notice a few
[1:05:15] lessons here number one he was a whiff
[1:05:18] sheaf and what does that mean
[1:05:23] okay it was a worship but the Christian
[1:05:25] Church that he died to are random
[1:05:30] in an Kim thought in the wit harvest was
[1:05:35] with loose
[1:05:36] he was the will ship this was with lows
[1:05:43] Bali has produced the would shift the
[1:05:48] wood harvest produce the with loaves
[1:05:52] what does this mean Christ on the day of
[1:05:55] his resurrection was the work shift
[1:05:58] and the first foot of the resurrection
[1:06:00] and what this means is that
[1:06:02] the Chadha was born at Pentecost unlike
[1:06:05] him was he was one single with sheath
[1:06:15] but the child that was born our
[1:06:18] tentacles was not a single ship but it
[1:06:22] was a real union of different particles
[1:06:25] mixed together joined together and made
[1:06:31] into one homogeneous body
[1:06:35] but the way she was one single ship and
[1:06:38] so listings let me see that God had
[1:06:40] defense so well thought out that to
[1:06:43] totally represent what he was going to
[1:06:46] do today represent for us this same boss
[1:06:49] and types that he let in the scriptures
[1:06:51] so we will see very very clearly that
[1:06:54] the gospel redemption was pre-planned by
[1:06:57] God how it all figured out and plan it
[1:07:00] before the foundation of the world
[1:07:03] and secondly if you notice also a few
[1:07:05] lessons there if you notice also first
[1:07:07] lesson was he was a whiff ship
[1:07:09] single ship the archer that came after
[1:07:15] him on the day of vehicles was whipped
[1:07:17] loose
[1:07:20] different particles ground together and
[1:07:21] mixed together to form a homogeneous
[1:07:23] body and secondly you noticed from Libya
[1:07:27] 33 that are the Feast of the will chief
[1:07:32] there was no leaven offered you can read
[1:07:35] it there because 23 verses neither 22
[1:07:37] there was no 11 offered
[1:07:41] you
[1:07:42] in other words Jesus Christ no leaven
[1:07:45] because he represented the wood sheaf in
[1:07:49] presenting the work she there was no
[1:07:51] leaven offered brought in presenting the
[1:07:54] with loathes the loaves were baked in
[1:07:57] with leaven now what does this mean the
[1:08:01] leaven like we all know like Bible
[1:08:04] believers you know the eleven represents
[1:08:05] in the leaven is saying a little leaven
[1:08:08] leavens the whole lump
[1:08:11] so that means the
[1:08:13] if the firstfruits had no leaven this
[1:08:16] represent amend that Jesus Christ
[1:08:18] there was no leaven no sin no evil in
[1:08:23] Jesus Christ the width shift but in the
[1:08:28] chart that was born on the day of
[1:08:29] Pentecost
[1:08:31] it was bacon the Whitlow's was bacon
[1:08:35] with our arm with 11 the 11 there
[1:08:40] represents and signifies that there was
[1:08:42] still seen in the church now when we say
[1:08:46] that if you don't understand it might
[1:08:50] look like they sinned a lot in the
[1:08:52] church no that's not what it means
[1:08:53] that's not what it means because this
[1:08:56] here this fact here therein lies the
[1:08:58] mystery and the greatness and the glory
[1:09:00] of the Church of the Living God because
[1:09:04] the glory of the church is not the
[1:09:06] absence of cinema Church but the glory
[1:09:09] of the church is in the power that is in
[1:09:12] the church to raise and live far above
[1:09:15] sin to live in total victory over and
[1:09:19] above sin because the devil is still
[1:09:22] there to trouble the people so it's not
[1:09:25] an inability to sin even when the bride
[1:09:28] is at the object she will still be
[1:09:30] subject to temptations it is not an
[1:09:33] adoption is not an inability to sin
[1:09:36] coming to profession is not an inability
[1:09:38] to sin or an inability or you are you
[1:09:41] you are you are you are you can not be
[1:09:47] so via the temptations anymore no
[1:09:52] but the glory of the church is coming to
[1:09:55] adoption and the Christian believer now
[1:09:58] knows that the glory of the choice'
[1:10:00] there's power in the church to live
[1:10:03] above sin even though there's leaven
[1:10:06] there seemed as evil for the glory and
[1:10:09] greatness of the Church of Christ is the
[1:10:12] power to live above the sin so it's not
[1:10:15] an inability to sin he's not unabie to
[1:10:19] be tempted but is the power and the
[1:10:22] glory and the ability and the grace of
[1:10:25] the Holy Spirit in the life of the
[1:10:26] believer to live in total victory and
[1:10:29] dominion over sin that's what the leaven
[1:10:32] represents the cinema Chur believers do
[1:10:35] things and they are still that people
[1:10:38] struggling back and forth but the the
[1:10:40] the the hope is that don't let the same
[1:10:44] tie you down don't let the devil tell
[1:10:46] you you cannot overcome this know the
[1:10:49] level in the church is there to let you
[1:10:52] understand that there is power there's
[1:10:54] glory there's greatness that's the grace
[1:10:57] of God in the church in your life to
[1:10:59] live above that sin because Jesus said
[1:11:02] the gates of Hell shall not prevail
[1:11:03] against you saying shall not have
[1:11:05] dominion over you and you are
[1:11:06] predestinated to live that glorious life
[1:11:09] that's what the arm the leaven in the
[1:11:13] church baked in with the wave loss
[1:11:15] that's what it represents that's one
[1:11:18] type of the
[1:11:21] harvest and the wheat harvest let's
[1:11:23] quickly take a second second type the
[1:11:27] Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost
[1:11:30] that was the Feast of Pentecost right to
[1:11:34] start the Christian Church
[1:11:37] that outpouring was the first fruits of
[1:11:39] the Holy Spirit been caught up knows
[1:11:41] what first fruits of the Holy Spirit
[1:11:44] being poured out and you can relate that
[1:11:46] to Jesus cry being the firstfruits and
[1:11:48] the deer pinnacles that bride was the
[1:11:51] firstfruits
[1:11:53] in the Christian Church the phosphors
[1:11:54] they received they are point of the Holy
[1:11:56] Ghost once it was given because before
[1:11:59] this time the Holy Ghost was not given
[1:12:01] but when the Holy Ghost was given or the
[1:12:03] japanagos to breath and may come to pass
[1:12:06] the Christian Church this R was the
[1:12:10] firstfruits and then
[1:12:14] a long period 50 days later brother
[1:12:16] branham said the fish the next fish
[1:12:19] which was the feed feast was the fish of
[1:12:21] the trumpets
[1:12:23] now what do all these represent what do
[1:12:26] all these represent between Christ and
[1:12:32] panicles between the with shift the Bali
[1:12:36] harvest and winner which was fifty days
[1:12:38] between panicles the first foods of
[1:12:42] Pentecost and the feast of the trumpet
[1:12:45] which was the fifth feast of jehovah was
[1:12:49] also fifty days long period poppadom
[1:12:51] said was fifty days so what do all these
[1:12:53] represent here's what it represents and
[1:12:56] so many of the things for these are
[1:12:58] context here represent that between
[1:13:00] Christ the would shift the resurrection
[1:13:02] and Pentecost there are fifty days and
[1:13:04] also be limp in occurs on the face of
[1:13:07] the trumpets was also 50 days and fifty
[1:13:10] days is a jubilee fifty days represent
[1:13:14] seven Sabbath's seven times seven is
[1:13:17] forty-nine that leaves you an extra day
[1:13:19] with takes you into eternity beyond the
[1:13:22] seven churches because the seven
[1:13:25] Sabbath's represent and type out the
[1:13:27] seven Church edges of the Christian
[1:13:29] Church that the Redeemer died to redeem
[1:13:34] and what the fifty days represent here
[1:13:37] is this seven the Holy Ghost was put out
[1:13:40] on fifty days seven church ages this
[1:13:45] Holy Ghost will continually be poured
[1:13:48] out to call out this Christian Church in
[1:13:51] seven Church ages that this Redeemer had
[1:13:54] died to redeem so it represents the long
[1:13:58] time between the Feast of Pentecost and
[1:14:02] the next which represents the long
[1:14:04] Pentecostal Jubilee or the coroner of
[1:14:07] the Christian Church through the seven
[1:14:10] Church ages and that began on the day of
[1:14:13] Pentecost so these are some types that
[1:14:15] this fish represents to the believer
[1:14:17] today and these types are so very very
[1:14:20] meaningful to you and I now problem-set
[1:14:22] here on the message recognizing a
[1:14:24] Deanna's message now we noticed last
[1:14:27] Sunday there was their walls are there
[1:14:30] preaching the feast days and there was a
[1:14:33] feast of Pentecost that's the the the
[1:14:36] with here'sh that's whipped loose that's
[1:14:38] the fourth feast preaching the Feast of
[1:14:40] Pentecost and between the Feast of
[1:14:42] Pentecost and Feast of Trumpets
[1:14:44] does it fit fish was a long period of
[1:14:47] time exactly fifty days between
[1:14:49] Pentecost and the Feast of Trumpets and
[1:14:51] fifty days with Pentecost means 15 it
[1:14:54] was the ship waving the first fruits of
[1:14:58] the harvest was brought in and this was
[1:15:01] the first fruits of the Holy Ghost being
[1:15:03] poured upon the church and we see it was
[1:15:06] in tight back that it's always inside
[1:15:08] because that's where the deepness the
[1:15:10] depth of the meaning is as where the
[1:15:11] richness is that's where the profundity
[1:15:14] that's where they that's that's where
[1:15:15] God hides it's from the arm from the
[1:15:19] wise and the prudent and refrig the bit
[1:15:21] such as we learn and tap is not just for
[1:15:24] intellectual you know to tickle your
[1:15:26] intellect is to bring you the richness
[1:15:29] of the lessons that God wants to impart
[1:15:32] into your life and into my life so for
[1:15:34] the banca news here the fruit frost full
[1:15:37] of the harvest was brought in and we see
[1:15:39] it was in tight back there with the
[1:15:41] natural force fruits
[1:15:43] Jesus I mean the the the Bali average
[1:15:45] was natural first fruits Jesus was the
[1:15:48] first fruits from the resurrection and
[1:15:50] the Church of Pentecost was the first
[1:15:52] fruits to receive the Holy Ghost is just
[1:15:53] showing these different types here show
[1:15:56] you you can't add these things to Bali
[1:15:58] harvest is surely different first fruits
[1:16:00] first fruits first fruits sure
[1:16:03] and we see it was in tight back there
[1:16:07] with the natural phosphors representing
[1:16:10] the phosphates of the Holy Spirit to be
[1:16:12] poured out upon the people first fruits
[1:16:14] and we find out
[1:16:17] about 150 days that the 50 days was
[1:16:21] received by the Gentiles
[1:16:25] the Christian Church tatted and 50 days
[1:16:28] before the next feast that's what he's
[1:16:30] talking to you about here the
[1:16:32] firstfruits and then 52 because the
[1:16:35] firstfruits showed that more are coming
[1:16:38] so we've seen here actually from the 50
[1:16:41] days would be exact
[1:16:42] now actually I know I'm sorry let's back
[1:16:45] up a bit and we found out that the 50
[1:16:47] days was received by the Gentiles which
[1:16:50] got call from the gent as a people for
[1:16:53] his name the Feast of the Pentecost the
[1:16:57] Feast of Pentecost and then 50 days
[1:16:59] inside representing seven church ages
[1:17:01] and we have been going through that long
[1:17:05] Feast of Pentecost the seven churches
[1:17:08] now actually from the fifty days would
[1:17:11] be exactly seven Sabbath's and seven
[1:17:13] Sabbath's represented the seven churches
[1:17:16] to be called the seven areas to be
[1:17:18] called in the time of the Pentecostal
[1:17:20] feast of Pentecost to call it people
[1:17:23] from the Gentiles for his name and
[1:17:26] that's the fish we have been going
[1:17:29] through this long feast of Pentecost so
[1:17:33] we can see the different types here
[1:17:35] the Bali harvest and we harvest
[1:17:38] represent Bali harvest fresh fruits a
[1:17:40] sign that more gonna come a sign that
[1:17:43] God has accepted a Santa you have been
[1:17:46] examine the beloved and that's what you
[1:17:47] want to understand God has accepted you
[1:17:49] Christ died rose up presenting before
[1:17:53] the father is and then we were coming
[1:17:55] and to prove the point on the deer plane
[1:17:58] comes fifty days later the truth that he
[1:18:01] died to redeem started to come and they
[1:18:03] have been coming in this long
[1:18:04] Pentecostal feast for seven church ages
[1:18:07] that's why said like that this promise
[1:18:09] on to you until your children and to
[1:18:12] them that took us to them that afar off
[1:18:15] to as many as the Lord our God shall
[1:18:17] call and he's still calling and by the
[1:18:19] Brahma said there three ages matter age
[1:18:23] the reformer age and the cold are aging
[1:18:26] with saying go to have a revelation that
[1:18:28] we are here at the close of this calling
[1:18:31] out in the Pentecostal age we are in the
[1:18:34] call our age under problem
[1:18:35] husband sent a call out a bride and here
[1:18:38] we are
[1:18:39] so barley harvest and with average so we
[1:18:41] don't lose a foot here
[1:18:42] Bali harvest and wheat harvest so if we
[1:18:45] say that this latest empathy Jia is the
[1:18:48] harvest age of the of the church then it
[1:18:52] simply follows against all this
[1:18:55] background that if this indeed be the
[1:18:58] harvest age of the church ages
[1:19:03] the judges remember span all the way to
[1:19:05] Adam in the Garden of Eden if this
[1:19:09] indeed be the harvest age then to
[1:19:12] perfectly tap the events of the harvest
[1:19:16] this age must have a barley harvest and
[1:19:19] a we harvest the Bali has been the wave
[1:19:22] ship the first fruits and the wheat
[1:19:24] harvest been there's so many more to
[1:19:28] come after that first fruit that we'd
[1:19:31] have I mean that that thou with ship
[1:19:34] that first fruits and so there must be a
[1:19:38] Bali harvest with a well shift in this
[1:19:42] age and a wheat harvest with web those
[1:19:46] are not the Feast of Pentecost in this
[1:19:50] larry-san age here
[1:19:51] how are we getting the picture barley
[1:19:54] harvest Jesus Christ first fruits of the
[1:19:57] Resurrection barley harvest the blood of
[1:20:01] Pentecost phosphorus we see the Holy
[1:20:03] Ghost and after phosphorous the most
[1:20:06] common harvest and wheat harvest after
[1:20:09] Jesus Christ the first was resurrection
[1:20:11] would have a scheme
[1:20:14] on the day of Pentecost and the
[1:20:16] Christian child was born
[1:20:18] now the dear pinnacle said in a second
[1:20:20] type was the firstfruits of the
[1:20:23] Christian Church first was of those who
[1:20:25] see the Holy Ghost and the same way
[1:20:28] after the firstfruits must also come
[1:20:31] with habits
[1:20:34] the Feast of Pentecost at the end if
[1:20:37] this be the age of the harvest age of
[1:20:41] the church ages we must have barley
[1:20:44] harvest and wheat harvest in other words
[1:20:47] there must be in this age the wave sheaf
[1:20:53] Jesus Christ the firstfruits in a Bali
[1:20:57] harvest in this age because he alone is
[1:20:59] the firstfruits
[1:21:01] unknown else he was the firstfruits on
[1:21:04] the other resurrection it was the first
[1:21:06] fruits or real Pentacles
[1:21:07] he is always the phosphors and if is in
[1:21:10] this area he must be the first fruits or
[1:21:12] Jesus Christ has got to be here somehow
[1:21:14] in this area as the first fruits in this
[1:21:20] harvest in the valley harvest in this
[1:21:23] age here
[1:21:25] in other words after him the Bali
[1:21:29] harvest in this age here there must also
[1:21:31] come sons and daughters like on the day
[1:21:35] of Pentecost there must come in with
[1:21:39] harvest to produce another feast of
[1:21:43] Pentecost another day of Pentecost in
[1:21:45] this area just exactly as the day of
[1:21:50] Pentecost follows the original waving of
[1:21:52] the wave sheaf Jesus Christ I hope you
[1:21:55] again in the picture in your foreign me
[1:21:56] so Jesus Christ is gonna be here as a
[1:21:59] whipped
[1:22:02] this have is age at the end of a church
[1:22:04] ages
[1:22:06] well before the Lord
[1:22:08] and also waved over the people as the
[1:22:12] with ship he must be here to be waved
[1:22:15] before the Lord and worked over the
[1:22:17] people as the whiff ship for our
[1:22:20] acceptance and for assignment that more
[1:22:23] and more sons and daughters are coming
[1:22:27] after him in a wheat harvest also in
[1:22:30] this age and this sons and daughters
[1:22:33] grow as they harvest another harvest the
[1:22:36] seed is back to original condition again
[1:22:39] and so these sons and daughters that
[1:22:43] will come after the phosphors the barley
[1:22:48] harvest the worksheet Jesus Christ in
[1:22:49] this age must also come back to original
[1:22:53] grain again original seed because this
[1:22:58] is harvest time
[1:23:00] the seed is back to original condition
[1:23:03] again in harvest time the cities back to
[1:23:07] original grain again in harvest time
[1:23:10] because as you're ready coded at harvest
[1:23:13] time the city's back to his original
[1:23:15] life is back to its original condition
[1:23:17] now having said that you want to
[1:23:21] understand what is original condition
[1:23:24] the bottom said the spoken word is the
[1:23:26] original seed and the original seed is a
[1:23:30] spoken word
[1:23:32] now we understand jesus said in matthew
[1:23:36] 13 and he said this when he spoke about
[1:23:39] the purple or the or the other surah he
[1:23:42] said the seed is the word of God and we
[1:23:44] and I know the life is in the seed but
[1:23:47] if the life is in the seed and the
[1:23:50] cities the world so the seed must derive
[1:23:53] is life from the word so the life in the
[1:23:56] city is actually in the world the life
[1:23:59] in the city is hidden in the world
[1:24:01] and that's where the bomb is coming from
[1:24:02] when he said the proper word is the
[1:24:05] original C in other words the spoken
[1:24:07] word is the life
[1:24:10] of the siege the life in the spoken word
[1:24:14] is actually the life is what give the
[1:24:17] city's life so original condition we get
[1:24:21] back to original seed and the life of a
[1:24:24] spoken word will be there in that
[1:24:26] original seed so that's the life to look
[1:24:29] for in harvest time and that's the life
[1:24:33] to look for in God's harvest the life of
[1:24:37] the original seed and brother Branham
[1:24:39] said the spoken word is original it was
[1:24:42] a spoken word there spoken what the
[1:24:45] logos that came out of God in the
[1:24:46] beginning when God spoke the word Jesus
[1:24:50] said the words that I speak unto you
[1:24:52] they are spirit their life life is in
[1:24:55] the world well what gives the Civic's
[1:24:58] life and the Lotus in the beginning the
[1:25:04] life in the logos because Lucas is the
[1:25:07] spoken word the life in the logos is
[1:25:10] what gives the seeds life Adam was a
[1:25:15] seed of the word so the life Adam lived
[1:25:18] came off of the life of the Mobile's and
[1:25:21] the locust is the son of God so the life
[1:25:24] in the logos the original sword of God
[1:25:28] is the life of the scene the spoken word
[1:25:31] is the life of the original seed and
[1:25:33] that's why in the harvest the life we
[1:25:36] are looking for in this good harvest at
[1:25:38] the end time is the life of the spoken
[1:25:42] word the spoken word is the life that
[1:25:45] you are looking for when you see a break
[1:25:47] come back to spoken war thus saith the
[1:25:50] Lord
[1:25:50] hear ye him or keep still then you know
[1:25:54] you have seen a bride you are witnessing
[1:25:56] would have as you are witnessing a bride
[1:25:59] that has come back to original condition
[1:26:01] again because the spoken word is the
[1:26:04] original seed and the life of the spoken
[1:26:08] word is the life that's in the seed and
[1:26:11] Adam demonstrated this token what like
[1:26:14] in the Garden of Eden before the fall
[1:26:17] spoken word life of course you
[1:26:19] understand that Adam was the pinnacle of
[1:26:23] God's original habits on the earth
[1:26:24] because the Christian was a harvest
[1:26:27] because God spoke
[1:26:29] let there be and there was let there be
[1:26:31] and there was let there be on the words
[1:26:33] is cook an egg or a harvest right away
[1:26:35] he spoke the plan came of in spoke the
[1:26:38] Salaf came up he spoke our animals came
[1:26:41] in land and he spoke and credit man so
[1:26:45] Adam was the pinnacle of God's original
[1:26:47] harvest the original lad that Adam had
[1:26:52] he derived it from the spoken word of
[1:26:56] God when God said let there be and the
[1:26:59] logos the Son of God came out of Elohim
[1:27:03] that spoken word that life in the spoken
[1:27:07] word that's what Adam ultimate of
[1:27:09] because Adam was his seed of the world
[1:27:12] and just like you and I are a seat of
[1:27:15] the world and the spoken word the life
[1:27:19] in the spoken word which was a son of
[1:27:21] God give Adam his life in the Garden of
[1:27:24] Eden so when we say Adam have spoken
[1:27:27] words it was the life he lived
[1:27:30] is spoken what life when we talk about
[1:27:34] adoption coming to perfection of the
[1:27:37] spoken word it's a life he's not just
[1:27:39] words like what when you hear here he is
[1:27:42] life and uh we will try and break it up
[1:27:46] a little bit for a few minutes before we
[1:27:50] close out so Adam had this is talking
[1:27:54] about life that was the original seed
[1:27:56] the original seed the spoken word is the
[1:28:00] life of the recognize it when you hear
[1:28:03] the spoken word is original seed it
[1:28:04] means the life of the city is in the
[1:28:07] spoken word in other words the life the
[1:28:10] spoken word is the life of the original
[1:28:13] seed and the life of the spoken word is
[1:28:15] the life of the Son of God the logos did
[1:28:18] feel funny the world the life of the
[1:28:22] origin honorable and Adam had the life
[1:28:24] that a lot of the dinosaur of God and it
[1:28:26] was all expressed as the spoken word
[1:28:29] life that Adam had but the Brahms Adam
[1:28:32] could speak Adam could name you could do
[1:28:34] whatever he had spoken what is spoken
[1:28:36] what like it all tied connected to his
[1:28:38] life and this total one that was what I
[1:28:41] don't had in the Garden of Eden
[1:28:42] now what did Adam having the gamin of
[1:28:43] Eden Adam had three things
[1:28:48] and that's what he lost when he fell by
[1:28:50] sin he had eternal life you have
[1:28:53] fellowship with God
[1:28:55] he had an inheritance in his eternal
[1:28:57] life he had a fellowship God he had
[1:29:01] eternal life and eternal life Adam had a
[1:29:03] body in which it could live forever
[1:29:05] because it was said the day you eat
[1:29:08] thereof that day you die in other words
[1:29:09] if it is not eat thereof he his body
[1:29:13] could make him live forever
[1:29:17] another story but
[1:29:21] he had fellowship with God
[1:29:25] he had eternal life
[1:29:29] and he had in his eternal life and
[1:29:31] inheritance in his eternal life this
[1:29:36] inheritance summed up this his um spoken
[1:29:41] word life some of the life of the Son of
[1:29:43] God that expressed it on the outside his
[1:29:46] fellowship with God is our eternal life
[1:29:51] was all expressed unveiled and hidden in
[1:29:55] his expression
[1:29:58] all these inheritance in life and that
[1:30:01] expression was by the spoken word but
[1:30:03] the spoken word that he had
[1:30:07] included the kind of life he lived in
[1:30:11] the garden had them with Eve Adam and
[1:30:14] Eve with the spoken word speak it was
[1:30:16] the life of the Son of God the spoken
[1:30:19] language was the expression of it and
[1:30:21] showing
[1:30:25] Adam had supreme complete control on the
[1:30:30] face of the earth that was the life of a
[1:30:32] son of God that's a life of the logos
[1:30:34] the logos way up in heaven Lucifer came
[1:30:41] up against him he had total complete
[1:30:43] dominion over a Lucifer that was the
[1:30:48] life of the logos that was the life of
[1:30:50] the Son of God now was the life that was
[1:30:52] intellectual Adam that was the life in
[1:30:53] the scene in Adam and that's the life in
[1:30:56] the city in you and I that we were not
[1:30:59] aware of Augustine had profited a
[1:31:01] message with a seven singers to wave it
[1:31:03] over us so we'll have an awareness of
[1:31:06] what we have been given by God what we
[1:31:08] have been predestinated to to in this
[1:31:11] enzyme here so Adam went through the
[1:31:14] garden lived on the face of this earth
[1:31:16] here with that spoken word life is in
[1:31:18] inheritance he's throwing the absolute
[1:31:21] joy to be a son of God on the face of
[1:31:24] the earth
[1:31:25] Adam was leave us it was the pinnacle of
[1:31:27] God's habits Adam wasn't even the
[1:31:30] original see the original son of God on
[1:31:33] the earth original condition Adam was
[1:31:36] the Word made flesh the Word was posited
[1:31:39] through his flesh that was the spoken
[1:31:41] word life and it could speak it couldn't
[1:31:43] name but the venom said a tree never
[1:31:46] dead before Adam but the drum said Adam
[1:31:48] could get whatever he wanted Adam could
[1:31:50] ask for anything whatever you wanted
[1:31:52] that was the spoken word life it was
[1:31:55] such power such authority such a no-show
[1:31:58] that is son of God and I matured God was
[1:32:03] on the face of the earth deputizing and
[1:32:06] acting on the face of this earth in the
[1:32:08] place of his father God that's what Adam
[1:32:10] oars
[1:32:11] that's what original condition is that's
[1:32:14] what the seed going back to see again is
[1:32:17] that's what the seed boom but is still
[1:32:19] harvest and that's what we are looking
[1:32:21] for so in this abbis time here we are
[1:32:23] looking for the word to be made flesh in
[1:32:25] this era Samia we are looking for the
[1:32:28] supreme control panel thority like Adam
[1:32:31] hadn't got a reading and this power and
[1:32:34] authority was was very
[1:32:37] and in a book in a title deed which was
[1:32:40] hidden in the tree of life which was the
[1:32:42] book of life
[1:32:43] she went Adam sinned he lost access to
[1:32:47] that book and the book went back to the
[1:32:50] hands of ignorant owner she said and try
[1:32:52] to check it he couldn't check the book
[1:32:53] but notice now Shannon could not take
[1:32:55] the book body inheritance Adams
[1:32:57] inheritance their earth did not go back
[1:32:59] to the hands original owner the
[1:33:01] authority went back to the hundred of
[1:33:03] God I mean the title deed went back to
[1:33:05] the hands of the original owner but the
[1:33:08] inheritance that's why the devil by
[1:33:10] banquet is water is squatting on the
[1:33:13] face of the earth
[1:33:13] that's why he can go around and exhibit
[1:33:16] this parent that modest and that power
[1:33:18] because is his free property and his
[1:33:22] ruin alone on the face of the earth as
[1:33:24] do you only but he does not have it does
[1:33:28] not have the title deed it's like
[1:33:31] somebody you know you leave your house
[1:33:33] and your heart is empty and somebody
[1:33:35] comes in and stays there and is behaving
[1:33:37] like the owner in the neighborhood and
[1:33:39] all that feels like that but if the
[1:33:41] authority comes the the government comes
[1:33:44] even want to see the papers of the house
[1:33:45] your people study healthier it doesn't
[1:33:47] have any purpose to show Lucifer has not
[1:33:49] too much to show for the UH for his for
[1:33:54] it claims to the earth here like it to
[1:33:55] Jesus distance have been given to me
[1:33:58] bow to me he is the prince and the pound
[1:34:02] the rule of the air right now
[1:34:04] heroes in the world litter of
[1:34:07] disobedience right now but he doesn't
[1:34:09] have the title deed that's where the
[1:34:11] 7-series coming that's where Malik
[1:34:14] offers ministries of such vital
[1:34:15] importance in the kingdom of God and
[1:34:17] that's why the devil has got to attack
[1:34:19] it is you deal me to a type of the Proms
[1:34:21] message it'll be a full an idiot to not
[1:34:24] attack it so attacking it
[1:34:25] it's totally perfectly in line with the
[1:34:28] scriptures but you and I we know what is
[1:34:31] about because Adam lost that title and
[1:34:34] Buckley has original owner
[1:34:36] but God said I will restore it right
[1:34:39] back I'll resolve that Church right back
[1:34:40] and that's the story that's why Jesus
[1:34:43] Christ died and rose from the dead to
[1:34:46] become the firstfruits from among the
[1:34:49] dead to rise in victory and power and
[1:34:52] authority over Lucifer because when he
[1:34:54] died he went to a head east said they
[1:34:57] are the saints of God free because Jesus
[1:35:01] had not died so they could not break
[1:35:05] through the folds or demon powers and go
[1:35:07] before our to heaven before God and
[1:35:11] Jesus had to die went to hell and took
[1:35:16] the the keys of death and hell from from
[1:35:20] Lucifer and and in doing that is said
[1:35:25] God's children free and said all of gods
[1:35:27] are the human race free for ever and
[1:35:31] that's what Jesus Christ dying
[1:35:34] represented and when he rose on the
[1:35:38] resurrection morning when he rose on
[1:35:41] research Wayne rose in victory and
[1:35:43] triumphant over Lucifer over death hell
[1:35:47] and the grave
[1:35:48] that was our kinsman redeemer rising in
[1:35:54] victory total victory he had won the
[1:35:57] battle that was the price then that we
[1:36:00] paid tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu get this book
[1:36:05] back for us to get this title deed back
[1:36:08] for us he had that prize
[1:36:12] and when he paid the price he took the
[1:36:16] keys of death and hell from ceiling he
[1:36:18] took the secret of death secret of Hell
[1:36:21] from Lucifer he took it from him and he
[1:36:25] rose from the dead and that's one we
[1:36:27] won't touch him like no other ago before
[1:36:29] my father job John job completed it is
[1:36:33] finished and he rose the first fruits
[1:36:37] from among the dead and then on the day
[1:36:40] of Pentecost the Holy Spirit poured out
[1:36:43] it was waved over the people
[1:36:46] and the trust help is matched back those
[1:36:50] are the chatter Pentecost was back to
[1:36:55] original green you could see that
[1:36:58] authority and the power and the spoken
[1:37:00] word
[1:37:01] it was sit right there and the first for
[1:37:04] church eighties Paul arenas Martin
[1:37:06] Columba that power was in that church
[1:37:09] until they went to the ground in a um
[1:37:12] nice Shack Council and for a thousand
[1:37:15] years
[1:37:16] that should was uh and that seed went to
[1:37:21] sitting again but I will restore it
[1:37:23] right back and I knew that God said to
[1:37:26] restore Wesley Pentecost Wesley the
[1:37:31] Pentecostals until it come to our age
[1:37:33] Malachi for the profit at the end time
[1:37:36] here with a promise in this end time
[1:37:38] here I will come right back a son of man
[1:37:43] again to reveal all these mysteries and
[1:37:47] then I'll be ready getting my church
[1:37:50] right back again
[1:37:53] to original condition I'm ready to get
[1:37:55] them right back to adoption charm again
[1:37:58] get get get them right back to that
[1:38:00] spoken word authority and power so
[1:38:04] acquainted the promise of Scripture we
[1:38:07] understand is gonna be waived again in
[1:38:10] the last days Afghanistan looks on in 30
[1:38:16] because he said even thou shall he be in
[1:38:20] the day when the Son of Man is revealed
[1:38:22] he's gonna be waived revealed to unveil
[1:38:27] uncover the Misha's of the kingdom of
[1:38:28] God and all that has gone in the church
[1:38:31] egg is gonna reveal and waive these
[1:38:33] things over us to open our understanding
[1:38:36] to the scriptures and so that we will
[1:38:40] know all that went on so that we'll know
[1:38:42] how to get back to our inheritance and
[1:38:45] he's he he ever promised and Malachi
[1:38:50] first mean she was a based upon that
[1:38:51] same looks on in theory Revelation chain
[1:38:54] he'll return as son of man again just
[1:38:57] like he came as son of man in his
[1:38:59] earthly ministry and when he came a son
[1:39:01] of man he died and rose from the dead
[1:39:03] son of man when he came a son of man son
[1:39:06] of man ministry for three and a half
[1:39:07] years when he rose from the dead
[1:39:09] resurrected logis transmission is son of
[1:39:11] man he was there what was he doing he
[1:39:14] was being waved over the people with
[1:39:16] over the peoples in Luke 24 then openly
[1:39:19] they honestl beginning from most all the
[1:39:22] prophets when all the way down to
[1:39:24] Genesis what Moses wrote and open
[1:39:27] expanded their understand of scriptures
[1:39:31] that's sort of ministry because son of
[1:39:33] man is the word the son of man is the
[1:39:35] word the opening of the world that's Son
[1:39:38] of Man to open the word to you to open
[1:39:41] the mysteries of the kingdom to you and
[1:39:43] Jesus Christ he did all of that in the
[1:39:47] days of his earthly ministry in his
[1:39:48] resurrected ministry and then he was
[1:39:51] with over the people by the revealing of
[1:39:53] the world to them that was the way the
[1:39:56] way the way he was the revealing in the
[1:39:59] days when the Son of Man is revealed all
[1:40:02] waved and so after the waving on the day
[1:40:07] of miracles the Holy Spirit came upon
[1:40:11] them and the Christian Church Terry so
[1:40:14] in this enzyme here if this be the habit
[1:40:17] age there's gonna be barley harvest

[1:40:45] revealing will be followed by another
[1:40:48] waving of the Holy Spirit to come upon
[1:40:51] what has been revealed and there you are
[1:40:54] gonna have a time of life to whether all
[1:40:58] of the life of God will go into the seed

[1:41:06] have got back a kids original condition
[1:41:08] like Adam wasn't a Garden of Eden or in
[1:41:11] a condition with a spoken word being the
[1:41:13] original seed with the life of the Son
[1:41:16] of God being the original seed with the
[1:41:19] spoken word life of this original son of

[1:44:20] according to what God said and will be
[1:44:22] open in the last days those seven cells
[1:44:25] will be broke and the full thing will
[1:44:28] come into view of the people
[1:44:31] what - what US took place all along all
[1:44:34] the way down to Adam the power of the
[1:44:38] seven angels message all the mysteries
[1:44:41] of God values all the Old Testament
[1:44:43] mysteries and the New Testament
[1:44:45] mysteries when it came here for that
[1:44:46] sort of man he revealed the missions of
[1:44:48] the Old Testament what had gone on and
[1:44:51] then the missions of the future coming
[1:44:53] 70° when he was shown the dead it the
[1:44:58] Bible says in Luke 24 that we read then
[1:45:01] begin a noise and all the prophets he
[1:45:04] went all the way back down the mysteries
[1:45:06] of God all the way back down to Adam in
[1:45:09] the Garden of Eden what happen and
[1:45:11] losing the book and all of that what
[1:45:13] Adam lost and the implications of it
[1:45:16] lost the state of glory and power and
[1:45:19] rulership and domain authority of the
[1:45:22] song original son of God he loves that
[1:45:24] is so dr. Satan in Solarize inheritance
[1:45:27] and lost in Anna's the Lucifer but
[1:45:30] Lucifer could not get a wall of the of
[1:45:32] the authority the the title deed the
[1:45:36] abstract to the earth you could not get
[1:45:38] that they went back to God whoever has
[1:45:41] the abstract has the rulership and
[1:45:43] torture continued on the face of the
[1:45:45] earth a loose 5zs water and that's why
[1:45:48] he hates this message so much because
[1:45:51] this message expertise that is only his
[1:45:53] quarter and you and I only need to
[1:45:57] understand that that Lucifer is a
[1:45:59] squatter he can't put on film you we
[1:46:01] can't put a sickness down for the
[1:46:03] disease calculus same can't put a
[1:46:05] condemnation can put nothing on you
[1:46:07] because the son of man set you free and
[1:46:10] you who the son of man set free is free
[1:46:12] indeed the son of man died and rose
[1:46:14] triumphant he went to hell and let
[1:46:17] captivity captive and gave gifts unto
[1:46:19] men who cannot be held captive anymore
[1:46:21] the son of man already broke the back of
[1:46:24] Lucifer so let's go on with this career
[1:46:26] he said
[1:46:28] it will be open in the last days those
[1:46:30] seven central broke and the full thing
[1:46:33] will come into view of the people what
[1:46:36] took place all along here is here it is
[1:46:39] the hour of the seven angels message all
[1:46:42] the mysteries of God both the Old
[1:46:44] Testament mysteries and New Testament
[1:46:46] mysteries he preached Old Testament
[1:46:48] mysteries he told them all the way back
[1:46:50] unto Moses repeating Testament mysteries
[1:46:53] the future commenced I'm attracted to
[1:46:54] men say that I the Son of man am there
[1:46:56] are the Christ the Son of the Living
[1:46:57] upon this rock I will build my church
[1:46:59] future common church and the guest
[1:47:01] version of the bill again see he
[1:47:02] preached all the mysteries Old Testament
[1:47:04] mysteries New Testament mysteries even
[1:47:06] in his resurrection the Son of Man was
[1:47:09] still there opening the word to them
[1:47:11] opening their underst turning to the
[1:47:14] world then open he their understandings
[1:47:17] in Luke 24 45 that they might understand
[1:47:20] the scriptures all the mysteries of God
[1:47:24] thus Old Testament mysteries New
[1:47:27] Testament mysteries should be made known
[1:47:30] in that Elijah
[1:47:32] the sort of man will come into that
[1:47:35] Elijah with all the mysteries of God
[1:47:37] with all the revelation of the mysteries
[1:47:39] of God
[1:47:41] should middle mean that Elijah in this
[1:47:44] last hour how that Christ is put out of
[1:47:47] his church the mysteries of God the
[1:47:49] mystery of the church and that was all
[1:47:51] the way back to Adam because the church
[1:47:54] story the sort of the Chester from Adam
[1:47:57] Adam was put in the garden but because
[1:48:01] he he deserved it disobeyed and lost his
[1:48:04] inheritance then the story continued and
[1:48:07] the next up was the church who received
[1:48:10] the word from the second Adam and that
[1:48:14] the first Adam lost this second Adam had
[1:48:20] it right not like Eve but this but also
[1:48:24] when the way of Eve but wanna make is
[1:48:26] that that church stir all the way back
[1:48:28] them from the Garden of Eden and so the
[1:48:32] Alveston
[1:48:33] angels message all the mishegoss menu in
[1:48:34] the Elijah how the Christ province
[1:48:36] church I was rejected by Adam and I was
[1:48:40] rejected it after the church at
[1:48:44] Pentecost
[1:48:46] all the way down to Nicaea council how
[1:48:48] they rejected him
[1:48:49] that was the son of God in the church
[1:48:51] the son of man had come and the poor
[1:48:55] discreet honor waved the water on them
[1:48:57] it's undermines the world and with the
[1:48:59] speedo condom and that gave back to the
[1:49:01] Son of God in the Christian Church and
[1:49:03] that was still him but then a nasiha
[1:49:06] council he was rejected and the seed
[1:49:09] went to the ground these are all the
[1:49:11] things that are contained in the 7 CS
[1:49:14] the mysteries of God the 7 seals were
[1:49:17] broke these are all the mysteries that
[1:49:20] contain the seven seals like Jesus
[1:49:22] himself preached the seven seas in
[1:49:23] Matthew 24 the Son of Man revealing the
[1:49:27] seven seals and and it kept quite on the
[1:49:31] seventh seal of that day and hour
[1:49:33] knoweth no man but what is there for so
[1:49:36] that your Lord would not come in the way
[1:49:38] you are not watching but know that if
[1:49:40] the woman of the house would have known
[1:49:41] the in what day is Master calm you would
[1:49:44] have watched and his house that has not
[1:49:46] be broken up into so the seven seals was
[1:49:50] what Jesus preached the seven seas is
[1:49:53] the son of man's message the seventh
[1:49:57] season of man's message amen
[1:50:04] the Seventh Seal is a sort of men's
[1:50:06] message and so going over the quote he
[1:50:12] said how are the other seven angels
[1:50:16] message all the missions of God should
[1:50:18] be made known in that Elijah and his
[1:50:19] last hour
[1:50:20] how that Christ is put out of his church
[1:50:22] that's right
[1:50:26] the son of God kicked out of the church
[1:50:29] and how he is revealed as a man again
[1:50:34] because when he is
[1:50:39] Church the son of God is kicked out
[1:50:43] for him too for you to get the Son of
[1:50:45] God back in the church you have got to
[1:50:47] get the son of man back in the church
[1:50:49] first
[1:50:50] you cannot just get Son of God back
[1:50:54] again you have got to get the Son of God
[1:50:56] back in a me son of man back in the
[1:50:59] church to reveal the mysteries of all
[1:51:02] that has happened just like you could
[1:51:05] not just get back and get the bride of
[1:51:09] pentacles back to that's what
[1:51:11] can life that he had without the Son of
[1:51:14] Man there so the son of man had to come
[1:51:17] back and Malachi for his explanation
[1:51:19] issue is billing to where there is in to
[1:51:22] let you see why she looks I mean theory
[1:51:24] has to happen he's letting you
[1:51:27] understand and see all of that why st.
[1:51:30] Luke's son in theory had to happen so um
[1:51:33] how his reveal as son of man again
[1:51:37] and when his resort manager which is
[1:51:41] Sampson in theory all of these things
[1:51:42] are what the seven seals reveal to us
[1:51:47] and then how that the church is to be
[1:51:50] put in order
[1:51:53] shut or the life or the whole order the
[1:51:56] order of God in the life of these people
[1:51:59] that's built not to the spoken word life
[1:52:03] the life of Christ is life in mechanics
[1:52:07] the legal what do what you have to do do
[1:52:10] what you need to do be a Christian live
[1:52:12] like a Christian amen the life of God
[1:52:16] everything in order because Chuck order
[1:52:19] is not sit down jump up whatever is the
[1:52:21] order of the coming of the Lord in the
[1:52:23] life of the people because that's an
[1:52:25] order to the coming of Lord the Lord
[1:52:27] Himself first the Lord shall descend
[1:52:28] from heaven they shout the dead in
[1:52:31] Christ shall rise first we which are
[1:52:33] alive and remain shall be caught up
[1:52:35] together with them that's an order to
[1:52:37] everything got doors and to go in the
[1:52:39] rapture there's an order to it and he's
[1:52:41] saying like that this father here is son
[1:52:43] of man comes is word over the people the
[1:52:47] Holy Spirit comes and annoys the water
[1:52:50] the sooner manners are spoken and that
[1:52:52] gives back to the Son of God in the
[1:52:53] church but when the Son of God was
[1:52:55] kicked out how you gonna get the Son of
[1:52:57] God again you have to come back as soon
[1:52:59] a man and that's where we come back to
[1:53:01] our mission looks on in 30 so how does
[1:53:04] it charge to be put in order and
[1:53:06] everything for the last day no creed no
[1:53:08] denomination just absolutely the world
[1:53:10] living in the individual H I'll take one
[1:53:13] and live one I'll take this and leave
[1:53:15] that one there's no strings no
[1:53:17] denominations no bunnies or nothing is
[1:53:20] the heart with God and him alone just
[1:53:23] absolutely the word living in the
[1:53:25] individual so this is the message of the
[1:53:28] seven seals
[1:53:29] like I said above here the seven seals
[1:53:31] will be broke
[1:53:34] and in this year explain to us how the
[1:53:36] sort of man needs to be refilled again
[1:53:38] and that's what bombs expend when we
[1:53:42] understand that
[1:53:44] in the last days st. Luke's immunity the
[1:53:48] Son of Man is to be waived all reveal
[1:53:51] over the people again so you understand
[1:53:55] Malachi first machine was standing just
[1:53:57] like Jesus - it is time to look all the
[1:54:01] way back down and all the mysteries of
[1:54:04] God will be made known in that Elijah to
[1:54:08] go all the way back down to the Garden
[1:54:11] of Eden like Jesus did all the way back
[1:54:12] unto Moses and took all those pieces and
[1:54:15] screwed them all open to him plus all
[1:54:18] the future missions over seven church it
[1:54:20] is just by the son of man did in eight
[1:54:22] days of his earthly ministry and
[1:54:24] packaged all that together into a
[1:54:26] message called the seven seals of
[1:54:28] redemption
[1:54:30] and waving over the people or reveal it
[1:54:34] to the people and when that is done when
[1:54:40] that is done then you are gonna have a
[1:54:43] people a bright on the face of the earth
[1:54:47] that's gonna be you know you know at the
[1:54:51] Spirit of God is gonna wave over them
[1:54:55] again the power of the Living God by
[1:54:59] Dynamix and then you are gonna have
[1:55:01] another day of Pentecost that's the
[1:55:04] seven seals
[1:55:05] so Jesus Christ came right back in idea
[1:55:07] he was king the son of God but he came
[1:55:09] right back in after here in Luther is
[1:55:12] said to restore right back Luther
[1:55:14] Wesley Pentecostals but I will
[1:55:16] restructure I will show you all right
[1:55:18] but all I'll restore back and in Melaka
[1:55:21] for here he was son of man right back
[1:55:24] again I know the people who have issues
[1:55:27] brother Branham and all of that and
[1:55:28] things like that we are not talking for
[1:55:30] those people because if you ever have an
[1:55:34] inkling of this best yet note you will
[1:55:37] be like well easily if we or an angel
[1:55:39] from heaven to say and all that gospel
[1:55:41] on to you let that even we let us be
[1:55:44] opposed become see another thing because
[1:55:46] once you ever on the stand I just open
[1:55:49] the understanding ones who ever
[1:55:51] understand this message here understand
[1:55:54] the purpose over several cells of
[1:55:56] redemption
[1:55:57] there's no terrible English learning an
[1:56:00] equation that can turn you away from it
[1:56:02] because you see the picture of the
[1:56:03] gospel or Redemption so clearly so the
[1:56:07] son of man will reveal today is messing
[1:56:09] with the message of a services and ramps
[1:56:11] up this other services is at that direct
[1:56:14] cognition that's what I came to this
[1:56:16] earth yet to do to open those services
[1:56:19] and those Salinger's cut him up and said
[1:56:21] both observable and revealed the mystery
[1:56:24] open up the mystery of the seven seals
[1:56:27] and that revelation was compassion all
[1:56:31] the missions of the Old Testament all
[1:56:33] the way back down to Moses all the way
[1:56:35] back down to the cattle hidden why Adam
[1:56:38] lost and all the way back down to the
[1:56:40] man
[1:56:41] how the mana goddess spoken the Elohim
[1:56:44] the spoken word the logos the life of
[1:56:47] the Son of God the war in heaven those
[1:56:50] were all the mysteries of redemption
[1:56:53] have got plenty before the foundation of
[1:56:55] the world those were all the missions of
[1:56:56] attention that's parted in the seven
[1:56:58] seals and the same man came to William
[1:57:00] Branham with this message here that's
[1:57:03] what Adam lost in the Garden of Eden and
[1:57:05] prepackaged it as the revelation of the
[1:57:08] seven seals is the services of
[1:57:10] redemption friends this gospel is based
[1:57:12] upon attention establish on retention
[1:57:14] redemption to go back to original green
[1:57:17] agin redemption to go back to the story
[1:57:20] of life then we'll go back to power to
[1:57:22] Authority to demons being cast out right
[1:57:25] now we pray for the sick sometimes the
[1:57:28] gag heels sometimes they don't but well
[1:57:30] that Brad gets back to original
[1:57:31] condition again gets back to the spoken
[1:57:34] word power and life all these run around
[1:57:36] for signs and wonders you are gonna find
[1:57:38] a bride that's leaving unpacked
[1:57:41] reflection against the Word made flesh
[1:57:42] in the bride she will speak and our
[1:57:45] world will be back but right now we pray
[1:57:48] for the sick we cast out Devils that's
[1:57:50] our commission we don't back off from it
[1:57:53] but we know beyond that we have a
[1:57:55] promise it's not this snow small things
[1:57:58] we want in such a flow and that are
[1:58:00] promised rivers of living waters rivers
[1:58:03] of virtuous full impact of this bride
[1:58:06] that's the revolution that's the message
[1:58:08] that's the son of man is a mystery
[1:58:10] that's this old man's measure that's the
[1:58:12] mission of the seven seals that's what
[1:58:14] he was he went over us by his measures
[1:58:17] over seven seas under seven thunders and
[1:58:19] that's what he packagers that's what the
[1:58:22] seven seas represent that's what this
[1:58:24] gospel represents the seven six seven
[1:58:26] seas our Redemption she one two three
[1:58:30] four five six seven and under the seven
[1:58:33] seals were seven on releases on the
[1:58:35] backside he plays them under the Seventh
[1:58:38] Seal under the seventh written seal so
[1:58:41] we have not fourteen seals
[1:58:43] no four seven series of redemption it's
[1:58:46] all about our attention to
[1:58:47] go back to the Garden of Eden to go back
[1:58:49] to Authority supreme control on the face
[1:58:51] of the earth to go back to demons
[1:58:53] backing off to go back to the devil
[1:58:56] shaking and screaming the trends of the
[1:58:58] sons of God sons of God are coming back
[1:59:01] we're right back on the way and thank
[1:59:03] God he sent a prophet thank God for that
[1:59:05] we'd like you to build Malachi for sure
[1:59:07] Jesus Christ he Malachi for Elijah where
[1:59:13] the Christ over us as his message of the
[1:59:16] seven seals and the seven thunders the
[1:59:18] seven seals of redemption
[1:59:20] it didn't send like same sign seven
[1:59:23] wonders like Jesus ah so he knows doubt
[1:59:26] to you that it was the same son of man
[1:59:28] exactly same sort of men over and over
[1:59:33] BAM said is that this is the same sort
[1:59:35] of man but even if they said we saw that
[1:59:37] we saw that that this was the same son
[1:59:41] of man the same life same ministry same
[1:59:45] works not for so so that there will be
[1:59:48] the Son of God back in the church so
[1:59:51] that the life of the Son of God hath
[1:59:52] spoken we're going to the bath son of
[1:59:54] God is the life of the son of god which
[1:59:57] is the spoken word life of the son of
[1:59:59] God that's what we are looking for we
[2:00:02] are the body sort of go back in the
[2:00:03] church
[2:00:03] that's why son of man calm so that the
[2:00:06] son of God will be back in the church
[2:00:09] because a set of man waves do what over
[2:00:12] you and then the spirit comes upon the
[2:00:15] world to unmask it and after will come
[2:00:17] to water God and I will come a ride with
[2:00:20] a spoken warden life of the Son of God
[2:00:23] with supreme power to that the minimum
[2:00:25] control that's we open wound the ends of
[2:00:28] the world has come so with the same life
[2:00:30] signs and wonders William Branham waved
[2:00:33] I revealed the Son of God revealed the
[2:00:37] Son of Man the revealing of this one
[2:00:38] evil exhaust shall he be in the day when
[2:00:40] the Son of Man is revealed the same life
[2:00:43] a minister exactly as Jesus Christ the
[2:00:46] worksheet himsel demonstrated proven to
[2:00:49] us was the same Jesus Christ the same
[2:00:52] Jesus Christ exactly doing this waving
[2:00:57] and this waving was a seven seals of
[2:00:59] redemption that he would do burrows and
[2:01:01] the seven seals what was in it
[2:01:04] asteroid but let me just sum it up Azzam
[2:01:07] are running down to close the message of
[2:01:10] a seven seas that was with over us by
[2:01:13] the son of man who will embark is Jesus
[2:01:15] Christ Jesus Christ the firstfruits of
[2:01:18] the resurrection the work shift
[2:01:21] because he is the seals but mom said he
[2:01:24] is those seals on the rising of the Sun
[2:01:26] is said he's the one who opened their
[2:01:28] seals
[2:01:29] he's the seals for the will of God is
[2:01:31] Christ and though the seven seas all
[2:01:34] about the mysteries of God of the Old
[2:01:36] Testament or the New Testament all the
[2:01:39] way back to Adam but not to the matter
[2:01:41] before the fashion of the wall all the
[2:01:43] way to the future is the New Jerusalem
[2:01:45] all the way publicly challenged in the
[2:01:47] future the mystery of God that's what's
[2:01:50] contained in seven seals the miche's of
[2:01:52] the Old Testament and the New Testament
[2:01:54] grass was contained in the are in the
[2:01:57] seventh years of redemption he is those
[2:01:59] so the whole Word of God is Christ and
[2:02:01] Christ is the series doors open what is
[2:02:04] the open of the seals reveal in Christ
[2:02:06] revealing this one man that's the whole
[2:02:10] purpose of the seals
[2:02:11] so with seven seals book the seven seals
[2:02:14] crew was it about the seven seals book
[2:02:17] the seven seals message this evolution
[2:02:19] scroll is the title determines
[2:02:21] inheritance that's what Adam lost the
[2:02:24] inheritance would be a son of God just
[2:02:27] exactly like Adam was exactly like Jesus

[2:05:18] future open up to us Malacca for waves
[2:05:22] reveal or wave these successive steps of
[2:05:26] our Redemption over us in the revealing
[2:05:28] of the Son of Man the steps are to go
[2:05:31] back to our inheritance the original
[2:05:33] which is the original glory of the Son
[2:05:35] of God like Adam had like Jesus
[2:05:37] demonstrated the second our
[2:05:39] Malaka for revealed this successive
[2:05:42] steps to us success as a comeback
[2:05:44] step-by-step by real true religious cash
[2:05:48] real true reverse and kitchen real true
[2:05:50] revealed part of the Holy Ghost that
[2:05:52] sensation amen and then that's where
[2:05:55] Perico stops and then after the baptism
[2:05:58] three days later on truly adoption and
[2:06:00] even many don't understand that there is
[2:06:04] the promise of dynamics which is the
[2:06:07] term life
[2:06:10] so why was worth over us all of these
[2:06:12] things I'm saying but put it together
[2:06:14] what was worth what the seven seals
[2:06:16] Sheen what would each service is worth
[2:06:19] ship with over us the seven seals web
[2:06:22] ship was the revealing of the son of man
[2:06:24] anywhere the promises over us the points
[2:06:28] of adoption perfection the wedding
[2:06:30] supper the Millennial the new city a
[2:06:32] wealthy over us he revealed these things
[2:06:35] to us
[2:06:36] wave the movers said something very even
[2:06:39] virtually being the different sort of
[2:06:41] managed reveal or waived the revealing
[2:06:43] the waving of the Shadowman
[2:06:45] the seven seals with sheath oh my as we
[2:06:50] are fixing the pros here here we are
[2:06:52] Jesus Christ the seven seals the son of
[2:06:55] man the original son of God that made it
[2:06:58] back then heritage that Adam lost in the
[2:07:00] gunnery married back he said was the
[2:07:02] first one to come to McCoy so he was
[2:07:04] pumped from the earth Malachi first they
[2:07:05] were ready port
[2:07:06] he has been waived over us by the
[2:07:09] messier missio malacca for william
[2:07:11] branham with the same life Sam Sam Sam
[2:07:14] no no no no doubts at all the same Jesus
[2:07:21] Christ
[2:07:22] this was Christ veiled in that friend
[2:07:24] all the mysteries of God will be made
[2:07:27] known in thy light it was all the
[2:07:29] mysteries into himself because the Son
[2:07:30] of Man was there behind flesh bail
[2:07:33] because Son of Man Jesus Christ must be
[2:07:36] here like we said in the Bali harvest
[2:07:38] and he found William Branham to use his
[2:07:41] body his flesh body in this valley huh
[2:07:43] Bashir to wave it before the Lord and
[2:07:46] for overalls for acceptance
[2:07:50] our war he was waived is got to come to
[2:07:53] pass because they're waving the
[2:07:55] revealing wolf it was well he's got a
[2:07:57] contract once the happy to waive the the
[2:08:00] the first fruits before the love for the
[2:08:03] husband man he was bound to happen with
[2:08:07] harvest once this mistress the the the
[2:08:11] the Word of God the Son of man has been
[2:08:13] whipped over was is got to come the past
[2:08:16] you are coming forth this brand is
[2:08:18] coming forth all the attack on the
[2:08:21] message today it has to be there that
[2:08:22] was more than I was missing because
[2:08:25] Jesus Christ look at the column on him
[2:08:27] push to all of that stuff it was missing
[2:08:30] from brother bands like she had to come
[2:08:32] and he's because of all of those things
[2:08:34] that God is sending some of these
[2:08:35] temporary cliques that we see on the
[2:08:37] face of the earth today but that's not
[2:08:39] for us to focus on right now but we know
[2:08:41] that Jesus Christ was very in that
[2:08:43] prophet and revealed the revelation of
[2:08:45] the Son of Man they what of God the
[2:08:48] miche's of God
[2:08:50] the Misses of the Son of God and they
[2:08:52] cut all the way back to Adam to the man
[2:08:54] of God adoption perfection everything
[2:08:57] was revealed and the son of man Jesus
[2:09:00] Christ
[2:09:00] well in that prophet to reveal these
[2:09:02] things to us and Malachi for where'd our
[2:09:06] this message over us amen were the son
[2:09:10] of man over us revealed the son of man
[2:09:13] where did over us initial sign
[2:09:18] the sign wasn't waived the sure sign
[2:09:21] that we are going to come for two
[2:09:23] we're gonna come forth ripen my horse
[2:09:26] it's sons of God in the stature of Jesus
[2:09:29] Christ standing there in the stature of
[2:09:32] a perfect man that's why we want to
[2:09:34] focus now on making sure our lives what
[2:09:37] we can do measure up in every aspect
[2:09:40] with the stature of a prophet man and we
[2:09:43] are gonna be harvested in the end time
[2:09:44] by the waving of the dynamics for our
[2:09:48] mechanics the spirit of the world
[2:09:50] because one was waved it has got to
[2:09:52] contrast so just as true as wheat
[2:09:55] harvest always followed berry harvest
[2:09:59] Bali harvest Jesus Christ in Malacca for
[2:10:02] waiving this mysteries around waving the
[2:10:06] seven seals over Ross waving the wishes
[2:10:09] of redemption of us women the plan of
[2:10:11] redemption over us
[2:10:14] as sure as we'd have this happen with
[2:10:17] hobbits going to happen here also
[2:10:21] but the venom did this weaving in
[2:10:23] mechanics and dynamics because the seven
[2:10:27] sales with shift the ravine of the son
[2:10:30] of man was with over us in both
[2:10:33] mechanics and dynamics
[2:10:37] just quickly I will write a closed
[2:10:41] Jesus Christ with the dennah the the
[2:10:44] with the the Son of man was with over
[2:10:47] them in both mechanics and dynamics
[2:10:52] the revolution over seven seals are in
[2:10:56] Somali 24
[2:10:59] Jesus revealing the seven seals in Saint
[2:11:03] Matthew r24 to them and then Jesus like
[2:11:06] we said over and over Jesus the Son of
[2:11:09] man revealing to them all the missions
[2:11:11] of the kingdom or the mission of the Old
[2:11:13] Testament in his earthly ministry in his
[2:11:17] ministry after his resurrection when all
[2:11:19] the way back down to Moses Jesus
[2:11:21] revealing to them all the mysteries of
[2:11:23] the New Testament church upon this rock
[2:11:26] I build my church and all of that he was
[2:11:29] waving the seven seals over them in
[2:11:33] mechanic's the revealing of the world
[2:11:38] it was waving the what over them his for
[2:11:43] the resurrection is all of that the
[2:11:46] waving in mechanics was the first wave
[2:11:48] him and then on the day of Pentecost was
[2:11:52] the second waving when the Spirit came
[2:11:55] back to wave him all over the people
[2:12:00] again but this happened spirit from
[2:12:02] because the sweet has got to be this
[2:12:04] back to the world to make down what
[2:12:07] common like that's what is contained in
[2:12:10] the seventh series of redemption the
[2:12:11] waiting was done in both mechanics and
[2:12:13] dynamics and that's why melaka for left
[2:12:16] is bad a promise of dynamics also it's
[2:12:19] not just wood woodworkers there'll be a
[2:12:21] spirit to fire the world right now he
[2:12:23] said we have the mechanics at the
[2:12:25] dynamics because that makes is a spirit
[2:12:27] and before you can get anything done at
[2:12:29] all you have got to have the spirit
[2:12:32] there but we are talking about a
[2:12:35] definite from is all dynamics to where
[2:12:38] the breath of jesus christ like the
[2:12:40] church on the day of pentecost will have
[2:12:43] the street of god weight over them in
[2:12:46] dynamics to anoint the word that they
[2:12:50] are received from the seven seas of
[2:12:52] redemption and there will be an
[2:12:54] outpouring and there'll be do the word
[2:12:56] were also and knowing them into the
[2:12:59] flesh they will become the word made
[2:13:01] flesh oh my
[2:13:03] so just like jesus with this are what
[2:13:09] over the early bride are in mechanics
[2:13:12] and dynamics in the same manner melaka
[2:13:16] for also not only preached the world you
[2:13:18] also demonstrate the power manifested
[2:13:22] that word
[2:13:24] with such awesome Authority
[2:13:27] and that authority displayed our loss
[2:13:30] inheritance in I eternal life
[2:13:34] and what was the display or is expressed
[2:13:36] by spoke over piety was this was a song
[2:13:38] that was back to that spoken what being
[2:13:42] the original is listen that was back to
[2:13:44] the life of the spoken word the life of
[2:13:47] the original Son of God the spoken word
[2:13:49] life of the Son of God that was then let
[2:13:51] there be and there was let there be and
[2:13:54] there was the son of God that talked and
[2:13:58] galaxies come into existence the spoken
[2:14:00] word of God then that life
[2:14:03] Malik Kafur demonstrated that a man last
[2:14:07] spoke about life he left us five
[2:14:09] examples of spoken what karna thority
[2:14:11] re-write son go back and shine for days
[2:14:14] and little fish I give you a life and
[2:14:17] and and all of those examples that that
[2:14:20] or spoke about panel through that what
[2:14:21] the machine is like though this son that
[2:14:23] was back back to original a grin again
[2:14:26] proving it was the same Jesus Christ
[2:14:28] that was with over us as a seven series
[2:14:30] with shape the message of redemption
[2:14:33] that the son of man amen came back in
[2:14:37] this age here with Amen he said on the
[2:14:41] undertones at any time in the very day
[2:14:44] that the Son of Man is revealed relation
[2:14:46] to one who said read when you get home
[2:14:47] though the Son of Man Jesus Christ
[2:14:49] coming right back and he found nobody to
[2:14:51] use to Valen but William Branham to come
[2:14:54] back to flesh of the mystery of
[2:14:55] redemption in
[2:14:58] first shall it be I mean there isn't any
[2:15:00] but in the days of the voice of the
[2:15:02] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[2:15:04] sound the mystery of gosh we finished by
[2:15:06] the time this takes place here the May
[2:15:10] seventh Messiah is on the face of the
[2:15:12] earth and the ASA reading mysteries is
[2:15:14] finished then it goes to the backside
[2:15:16] seals to put all together and put the
[2:15:19] boxes underneath the seven regions here
[2:15:21] too
[2:15:24] the word the son of man's message to be
[2:15:28] revealed or weaved over his people in
[2:15:32] the very day that the sort of manager of
[2:15:33] eruption someone is a really when you
[2:15:35] get home the seven angels message open
[2:15:37] up this is what is it now the angel is a
[2:15:39] sort of man the seventh angel but the
[2:15:42] messenger the seventh angel is revealing
[2:15:45] the Son of Man
[2:15:47] can you get it separated now that's
[2:15:49] right seems to be so hard for you see
[2:15:50] not the son of man himself not Jesus
[2:15:52] himself not Jesus skin but the seventh
[2:15:55] angel the seventh messenger is revealing
[2:15:59] to the public the Son of Man because it
[2:16:04] has let the shocks you're talking about
[2:16:06] the life has led the shock and card that
[2:16:09] in the son of man very William Branham
[2:16:11] does his song that has come back to all
[2:16:14] of the life in the seed all of the life
[2:16:17] of the world has come right back in this
[2:16:21] son and he's backed origin again again
[2:16:24] all of the life this was a son in a time
[2:16:27] of life amen
[2:16:30] he can organize is the grain itself
[2:16:34] again the son of man William Branham the
[2:16:40] grain itself again oh the ravine of the
[2:16:45] son of man back to original green again
[2:16:47] as an Eden the Word made flesh a
[2:16:51] possession and a manifestation or spoken
[2:16:55] word power and authority the spoken word
[2:16:58] the original seed now quickly
[2:17:04] about this in a man mister no man there
[2:17:06] have been three days of the Son of Man
[2:17:07] throughout history all scriptures and
[2:17:10] all history I Jesus himself made
[2:17:12] allusions to in the days of Abraham when
[2:17:16] Elohim came down to Abraham fill behind
[2:17:18] human skin of Abraham in Genesis 18
[2:17:22] secondly in the days of our Lord on
[2:17:24] earthly ministry the Son of Man was
[2:17:26] there also when he came down himself the
[2:17:28] Word made flesh
[2:17:28] when he came to Abraham he put on human
[2:17:32] skin and candelabrum Jesus referred to
[2:17:34] it as the day as one of the days of a
[2:17:36] Son of Man
[2:17:38] the number three in our day are
[2:17:41] constants only 31 days no man has been
[2:17:44] here veil behind the human skin of
[2:17:46] William Branham as in Genesis 18
[2:17:50] Jesus skin as needed of a lot earthly
[2:17:52] ministry but as in Genesis 18 when he
[2:17:55] came down to Abraham and the son of man
[2:17:57] was revealed to Abraham in his day when
[2:18:00] Elohim himself came down in human flesh
[2:18:02] and with the promises over him in
[2:18:04] mechanics
[2:18:05] with the promise of a short-timer life
[2:18:07] with a promise of dynamics to come upon
[2:18:10] the promise that he has revealed to him
[2:18:12] there was gonna be with the Tommies over
[2:18:15] him and there's gonna be another wavin
[2:18:16] by the spirit the Spirit of God did the
[2:18:19] woman through the church Edge's the
[2:18:21] speed of God always does the women
[2:18:23] because it not only comes in by the Holy
[2:18:25] Spirit with the landing of his word he
[2:18:28] also comes in with the Holy Spirit but
[2:18:30] the manifestation of his word so the
[2:18:32] whole street does do does the does the
[2:18:34] the the waving mechanics and dynamics
[2:18:39] brother son of Mallory to Abram in his
[2:18:41] day Elohim came in right down sir men
[2:18:44] revealed himself to Abram in very
[2:18:47] inhuman scheme but Abram recognized
[2:18:49] Abram recognized Lord did not recognize
[2:18:52] my Abram recognize this is called veil
[2:18:54] in human skin not the man is God but God
[2:18:57] fell in human skin God borrowing the
[2:19:00] skin of them of man to do his work
[2:19:03] that's where we are going to become the
[2:19:05] Word made flesh
[2:19:09] Jesus skin God was the speed on the
[2:19:11] inside but the flesh was Jesus
[2:19:16] his earthly name was Jesus
[2:19:19] his earthly name was Jesus but God was
[2:19:21] the spirit on the inside of him
[2:19:25] so in it came to Abraham and waive the
[2:19:29] promise over him reveal the promises to
[2:19:31] him over all the promised son he was
[2:19:34] gonna have a son and with a promise I
[2:19:37] will return to you according to the time
[2:19:39] of life and Sarah shall have a baby
[2:19:40] there's gonna be a son there when the
[2:19:43] Son of Man comes on the scene he always
[2:19:45] comes in human skin is always the what
[2:19:49] made flesh and there's always a promise
[2:19:53] the Sun there's always the promise that
[2:19:56] the Son of God will be made manifest in
[2:19:59] your flesh always there you always see
[2:20:03] that there the promise of adoption is
[2:20:05] always there
[2:20:08] so Abraham receive the mechanics with a
[2:20:11] promise or dynamics the Elohim will
[2:20:14] return is second time but in spirit from
[2:20:17] Z I will return on to the occurrence
[2:20:19] time of life it wouldn't be Elohim
[2:20:21] coming again in flesh it will be by the
[2:20:24] spirit to wave over him like he did on
[2:20:27] the day of Pentecost and Sarah will give
[2:20:29] birth to a child a promise on
[2:20:32] Jesus Christ in the days of his earthly
[2:20:34] ministry same thing happened after his
[2:20:36] resurrection with over them mechanics
[2:20:39] mechanics mechanics and said he's
[2:20:41] explained for you are going away when he
[2:20:42] went away on the 50th day down came the
[2:20:46] spirit he returned again is that our
[2:20:49] comic King unto you I will not leave
[2:20:52] Italy I will come back it came back
[2:20:54] again to them on the day of Pentecost to
[2:20:58] anoint the promises in their soul and I
[2:21:01] came the Son of God like Isaac the son
[2:21:03] of God in the Christian Church but what
[2:21:05] was it it was the Word made flesh the
[2:21:08] word was living in their flesh to this
[2:21:09] Sodom and to notice that they had been
[2:21:11] with Jesus Christ and likewise the same
[2:21:13] sort of man as we turn to us in this
[2:21:15] data condors the looks of 9:30 and he
[2:21:17] has hidden cell behind the human flesh
[2:21:20] veil of William Branham and has been
[2:21:22] world over us as a seven seals which
[2:21:25] shift the revealing of the Son of Man in
[2:21:28] both mechanics and dynamics he has been
[2:21:32] with others as the seven seasons work
[2:21:34] shift in the form of Bible promises with
[2:21:36] the promise of a time of life a promise
[2:21:39] of a second woven with a promise of the
[2:21:42] dynamics one the horsemen were should
[2:21:44] over this bride in dynamics for a
[2:21:46] manifestation of every promise word that
[2:21:50] she received in the waving of the truck
[2:21:53] of the seven seals will shift the seven
[2:21:55] situation reveal promises rules or
[2:21:58] adoption perfection the birth of the
[2:22:00] oldest priests and education limits and
[2:22:03] we are promised a time of life when all
[2:22:06] of the life of God will depart upon all
[2:22:13] all the light in the seat has been
[2:22:16] brought in to us with the revealing of
[2:22:18] the worth of a certain man but without
[2:22:21] the spirit that would we'll just lay
[2:22:22] dormant there so the Holy Spirit same
[2:22:27] way as come back to us in the revealing
[2:22:30] of the Son of man in the window the
[2:22:32] seven series which she with a promise of
[2:22:35] the time of life a second waving when
[2:22:38] the Holy Spirit will come right back and
[2:22:41] ship over this bride in dynamics for a
[2:22:44] manifestation of every promised word
[2:22:46] that she received in the waving of the
[2:22:50] seven seas worship unlike unlike Abraham
[2:22:53] excuse me
[2:22:54] like Abraham and Sarah this
[2:22:57] manifestation will give birth to the
[2:22:59] promised son of God with the same life
[2:23:02] same power same authority as Adam poses
[2:23:06] and demonstrated as Jesus pushes at the
[2:23:09] machine as the early practices and the
[2:23:11] machinery and as Malachi flow in this
[2:23:13] eight-year process and the Messiah as
[2:23:15] the Son another firstfruits to palm to
[2:23:19] perfection to make it back to original
[2:23:21] clean to make it back to the carnival
[2:23:24] and he said is to ritual Eden has
[2:23:26] already begun
[2:23:28] the seven seals with sheep has been
[2:23:31] whipped over was in boat mechanics and
[2:23:33] dynamics by the son of man fell behind
[2:23:35] the flesh veil of William Branham with a
[2:23:37] promise that the son of man that was
[2:23:39] failed that was with other seven sins
[2:23:42] which she will return unto this bride by
[2:23:45] His Holy Spirit one in freshman again by
[2:23:47] his Holy Spirit in dynamics a promise of
[2:23:51] dynamics of the Holy Spirit in the term
[2:23:54] of life to pack all of the life of the
[2:23:57] speaking tours to correct all of them
[2:23:59] life in the love that's right in us for
[2:24:02] the promised son to be born
[2:24:05] the egg of God amen meeting the Spirit
[2:24:12] of God
[2:24:15] the Word of God the Son of God the Son
[2:24:17] of God will be manifested in your flesh
[2:24:19] oh my the time of life is a short time
[2:24:23] of life a short time set aside in which
[2:24:26] season with harvest season at the same
[2:24:29] time here and we are looking for it
[2:24:31] where all of the life of the seed or the
[2:24:34] life the dynamics will be whipped over
[2:24:38] that seed in you he has worried over us
[2:24:41] mechanics but he is coming a time of
[2:24:44] life when all the life of the Spirit
[2:24:48] will be whipped over you in dynamics and
[2:24:51] will and knowing that sidon you the
[2:24:54] fullness of the words you are ready now
[2:24:56] the fullness of the Spirit 28 and
[2:24:57] africanus son of God your Isaac under
[2:25:00] manifest in your flesh you get back to
