that praise pressure normalize father I pray anoint his feet tonight I pray for the spirit of God will go and visit him the age of your presence passed by and the healing virtual flow in Jesus am I asking amen and in God bless you since and it's a blessing to be here tonight and uh what few things I'd like to share with you if you have your Bibles uh I just want to say a few things from the prophet and then we're going to read some scriptures from Psalms and I think I would share the screen as you would able to read it or you could all be in Barbers and and read it but the title I have tonight is T in the presence of God on the repentance stay in the presence of God on the repentance the prophet was seen here the journey time of Ezra the children of Israel have become backslid start to mix up any more by woman and so on like that he says what a picture that is of today about churches your way they are falling from the old fashioned human line that God laid on for the church the precepts that we were to live by the church is communism fornication with the world it's out got out into the world I began to dally with the world and it embarrassed the prophet so much so when he come before God he blush his face and that blushing is to be ashamed to be embarrassed and it seems like the morality of his people is hurting so bad until he set down and anointed himself pluck his hair out because it was heavy-hearted before the Lord in prayer then when they even sacrifice was offered he went into the temple fell on his knees and blushed before God for the sins of the people now hear this part he didn't blush for this college streak of the red light district he didn't blush for the booze Drinkers and Elwoods well it was bad as it may be but he blushed because the sin of the elect he blushed because the sin of the elect and what we need to do is some more prophets with enough God in their hearts to blush in the presence of God for sins of the people who call themselves the people of God and do in the way they are doing what a disgrace we have brought to this place the morals of all people this is not an easy subject to speak one I could think of many things that is easier to speak on but brother if somebody don't sound in the sinful adulteress D but we live in a colder colors what's going to happen somebody gonna speak the thing somebody got to place it before the people past Ezra didn't want to do it but it was in his heart and this is what I get to know when you see a servant of God get so sincere to live on his face with his hands and the ear praying to God and blushing because the iniquity of the people then you want to see a Revival start and hear the quote a man cannot lay in the presence of God a church cannot leave steep in the presence of God under repentance unless the Holy Spirit comes down and gives unction and Power to start a move of God in there among these people just got to be let me read that again a man cannot lay in the presence of God a church cannot see in the presence of God under repentance unless the Holy Spirit comes down and gives um and Power to start the move of God in dear among those people just got to be he said what we are doing today we are Partners on the back we are calling it this that and a Revival when there's no Revival there's a stirring of emotion called a religion among the people but no Revival that religious group in that day they had us still in that day but they needed a Revival so this time even bibles are reckon they're going to Psalm 6. and we're doing something different tonight I want you to read it together with me okay so we have a few times we have to read it's about four or five of them but I want you to read with me and that will be what we have to share with you tonight we wanted to enter Psalm 6 and what I will do I would um share the screen and we'll see how the Lord will take it from the amen praise the Lord so go to Psalm 6. okay psalm 6. and this is David I'm David saying this one and you want to read it to me together with me three four oh Lord rebuke me not unite anger displeasure I have mercy upon Me O Lord for I am weak O Lord Heal Me for my

Psalms one or two refine it three four hear my prayer oh Lord I let my cry come unto thee hide not thy Feast on me in the day when I'm in trouble inclined and ear unto me in the day when I call answer me speedily for my days are consumed like smoke my bones are burned as an earth my heart is smitten and wizard like grass so that I forget to eat my bread my my reason of the voice of my groin and my bones cleave to my skin I'm like a pelican of the Wilderness I'm like all of the desert I watch and I'm as I Sparrow alone upon the house Stone my enemies report me all the day these that are mad against me are sworn against me I have eaten ashes like bread and mingled my drink with beeping because of dying a dimension and Iraq when I was Lifted Me Up and passed me down my days are like a shadow I decline it and I will visit like grass but though Lord shall endure forever and the remembrance unto all generations though shall arise upon Zion for the time is come for like servants take pleasure in the storms and favor the dusteroth so the Heathen shall fear the name of the Lord and all the kings of the earth thy Glory when the Lord shall build up Zion he shall appear in his glory he will regard the prayer of the destitute and not despise their prayer this shall be written for the generation to come and the people we shall be created shall praise the Lord for he had looked down upon the height of his Sanctuary from Heavenly the Lord be holy Earth they hear the groaning of the prisoner to loose those that are appointed to death to declare the name of the Lord in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem when the people are gathered together and the kingdoms to serve the Lord he weakened my strength in the way he shot my days I said oh my God take me not away in the midst of my days the years that showed all generations of all has only the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the work of thine hands they Shall Perish but Dosha and go ye all of them shall works all like in garment as a vested shall thou changed them and they shall be changed but though at the scene and thy ears shall have no end the children of thy servant shall continue and their seed shall be established before thee Psalms 130 and we read three four out of the depths of I Cried unto thee O Lord Lord hear my voice let thine ears be attentive to the force of my supplication if the Lord should Mark his iniquities oh Lord who shall stand but there is forgiveness with thee that though must be feared I wait for the Lord my soul bottle wheat and in his word do I hope my soul waited for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning I say more indeed I'd watch for the morning let Israel hope in the Lord for where the Lord there is Mercy and with him is plenteous redemption and he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities and the last Psalm we have here is Psalms 143 Psalms 143. I'm gonna read together three four hear my prayer O Lord give air to my supplication in thy faithfulness answer me and in thy righteousness and enter not into judgment with thy servant for in thy sight shall no man living be justified for the enemy as persecuted my soul yet split in my life down to the ground he had made me the dwell in darkness as those that have belonged dead therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me my heart within me is desolate I remember the days of old I meditate on all thy works I Muse on the work of thine hands I stretch for my hands unto thee my soul to sit after day as a thirsty land sinner hear me speed of your lord my spirit feel it hide not thy face on me at least I believe cause me to hear our loving kindness in the morning for indeed do I trust cause me to know the way wherein I should walk for I lift up my soul on today Deliver Me O Lord for my enemies I flee on the leader hide me teach me to do thy will to know what my God thy spirit is good lead me into the land of uprightness Quicken me oh Lord for thy name's sake for thy righteousness sake bring my soul out of trouble and of thy mercy cut off my enemies and destroy all them that affect my soul for I am thy servant oh blessed be the name of the Lord I pray and trust that you seeing these words will mean a lot to you as your golong in prayer but something have to take place when a church could stay in God's presence on the repentance you're not going to boss you're not going to be proud and growing arrogance and attitudes because you're in the message but you're going to humble yourself before God because you're looking for a real spiritual breakthrough that's powerheads Heavenly Father God I shared this world with your people tonight stay in his presence on the repentance and this Lord is a little synopsis of David and his story as he went through different areas in his life if one struggles where he sought you where he call upon you it wasn't family it was
