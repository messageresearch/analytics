delivered up backslide it is anyone sick may you heal them if there's anyone tired me you give them strength if there's any one just hanging on Lord million know that they are spiritual heroes Omega pride heroes born to overcome born to come come father will be very careful to give you the praise will give you the honor will give you the glory will give you the Thanksgiving and the church says and the church says and before I greet you I just wanna go straight to the scripture and then we'll do the greetings just want to read one portion of Scripture this morning reading from the book of Esther chapter 4 and reading from verse 9 Esther chapter 4 and reading from verse 9 as the 4 and verse 9 and he that came and Toole Esther the words of Mordecai again as to spook speak unto he tack and give him commandment unto Mordecai all the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces do know that whosoever whether man or woman shall come unto the king into the inner court who is not call there is one law of his to put him to death except such to whom the King shall hold out the golden scepter that he may live but I have not been called to come into the king these thirty days and they toll to Mordecai Esther's words then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house more than all the Jews for if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place but thou and my father's house shall be destroyed and who know it whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as is then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer go gather together all the Jews at a present in Shushan and fast he for me and neither eat nor drink three days night or day I also and my maidens will fast likewise and so while I go in unto the King which is not according to the law and if I perish I perish so Mordecai went his way and did according to all that Esther had commanded him may the Lord that a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning I greet you this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ and it's certainly a privilege to be here in in nugu Nigeria once again among believers of like precious faith amen and I want to certainly greet with the Charles god bless you the host pastor you preach it with the Charles no other ministers and churches that I here like to greet all the ministers and the churches I certainly want to acknowledge and greet the ministers that have already spoken by the ek brother Jean no but a daily God bless you brothers your preacher the messages thus far amen amen amen amen so we are here we are here for another battle because you can't have a victory unless there is a battle and brother Charles has a very powerful inspiration the manifestation of the Omega bride heroes you know and the word here is a powerful word it speaks up people who are courageous adventurers they break the norm and and the world has sort of used that word and have heroes and superheroes and all of these things they make up Superman and Batman and all these heroes they want to put in a young people's minds and nothing on the real heroes of fear that actually walk the earth you have young people who know more about Batman than the real heroes our faith can the church say Amen but we are called to be true Omega bright heroes in such a time as this every biblical character we read has a unique place has a unique role has a unique purpose for some we read in Scripture the stories of their lives span for decades for others we only read about them for a few hours but with our limited ability and our minds ability to comprehend every aspect of Scripture it is hard to place a value of one hero in the Bible above another because every single one had a role to play how do you compare Abraham with Noah how do you compare Noah with Jeremiah how do you compare Elijah with simon of cyrene we all know about Elijah Elijah shot to heaven that's a hero Elijah cause of fire Elijah drop the mantle on Elijah the impact of Elijah's ministry was so measurable that King Ahab calls Elijah the one who troubles Israel hallelujah so heroes are disruptive heroes are known for causing a problem heroes are called for trouble in the water are there any heroes in enugu this morning hallelujah you may be seated I say to the young people if the devil doesn't know your name is a problem because you are supposed to be on his radar he is supposed to know your name oh I know pizza I know of Mia I know we have got to be heroes that disrupt the order of things somebody preached back to me you may be seated so when you read about the heroes of faith Elijah was the one that troubles Israel his rule covers many years this is just a background I'm gonna get to my text shortly can the church say man more than that the spirit of Elijah God is so good that he could take a spirit and use it more than once because the spirit speaks of something so the spirit of Elijah that heroic spirit that befallen Elijah that's heroic spirit to be thrown undone the Baptist that same spirit of Elijah was found on William Miriam Branham and that seems Curt will come back again to the Jews so don't tell me we cannot have heroes because God promised a visitation and he said the spirit of Elijah will rest upon Elijah can the church Shaymin you may be seated for a moment so everyone has a ministry for the random said everyone has a role of being a hero I'm listening a background before the message Elijah is one of the bigger names we know but what about Simon of Cyrene Simon of Cyrene was not a prophet there are no books written about him his name is not found in the record of ebro's 11 when Paul recounts the heroes of faith but in God's great drama in which we all have a place he finds himself in a purse Emilia place at a unique time Simon of Cyrene is not a Jew he is not a Roman he is from Cyrene but he finds himself in Jerusalem in the closing days of Jesus's ministry I'm here to tell you everybody who is called is a hero everyone has a part to play and okay the size of the park it's important that we play our part oh come on somebody preach back to me and if we find our place then the devil is finished because we're the Branum said perfect faith is based on your position' when you're in your position you can tell the devil get out of here because this is mine this is my house this is my family these are my children this is my body and sickness has no right in this body because I know my place I know my position I know what I'm called to do somebody preach back to me you may be seated can I talk about Simon is fluid so Simon of Cyrene he's on a Roman he's from Cyrene but he finds himself in the closing pages of Jesus's ministry the entire Old Testament was pointing to the coming Messiah the entire New Testament were talk about the Messiah what he did how he lived and how he would forever change the world but Simon of Cyrene call him the unlikely hero finds himself in the middle of a crowd of people around the days just after the Feast of the Passover and with this his three people carrying crosses a may away to be crucified crucifixions were common in Jerusalem but this day was different among the men to be crucified was a man called Jesus a man who did nothing to deserve it a man without sin he was being laughed at he was being mocked he was being spit upon he was bruised he was tired he was weary and he could no longer carry his cross oh how precious it is to carry the cross of Jesus and Simon of Cyrene was commanded to carry the cross with the weight of sin and Jesus's shoulder what a blessing to be able to carry his cross we can go on and on but every biblical character stepped forward playing their roles in God's drama can the church say Amen maybe see there for a minute I'm gonna get to the teeth he's gonna touch was actually one here I'm trying to get to this morning yet for all of the biblical characters in the drama of God there is one that has a unique distinction he is described by God and bought the old and the New Testament as a man after my own heart you know what I'm talking about a man which shall fulfill all my will the man called David I just want to talk about David for a few minutes before I strike my Texas morning when the children of Israel of Turin of God looked around them they saw everybody else at Kings and they said we want a king like that and that was not God's plan but it did step into God's permissive will as it were and the popular vote the man's choice was Sol he was tall he was he was a good family man he was a powerful man and and they loved this man's soul and that was man's choice but David's was God's choice when we talk about the life of David what makes David unique is that many things come to mind the little shepherd boy the musician we think of him anointed by Samuel as you read the Psalms in the life of David you see every emotion that is possible moment in the life of David you see joy you see peace you see fear you seep in you see grief you see sadness you see desire you see every possible emotion that a man could ever possess you see David he grows up in front of our very eyes but this is one of God's heroes can the church say Amen throughout scripture you could see the glimpse of people lives here and there you don't know much about this one you you don't know much about this one but David is different we see him as a shepherd we see him as a hunter we see him as a warrior we see him as a general we see him as a king we see him as a poet we see him as a champion we see him as an outlaw we seem as a ladies man we see him as a musician we see him as a prophet we seem as a worship leader we see him as an adulterer we see him as a murderer we seem as a brother we see him as a husband we seem as a son we seem as a parent we see him as a leader we see him as a hero we see him as a bulldog we see him as an ancestor of the lineage of price see a man after God's own heart despite his ups and downs he was still numbered in Hebrews 11 and I'm here to say this morning despite your ups and downs you will be and f-number God's Omega bride he rose you may be seated I'm gonna get to the tech shortly but I didn't want to take encouragement because whenever whenever you kind of feel it alone you can always go to the sounds and he could pull encouragement from the sounds so David's weeks and these are familiar but it is morally a scriptural foundation sounds 23 we know it the Lord is my shepherd ease in yourself so I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yea though i walk through the valley this is how he rose speak yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death hear the words of a hero i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me you may be seated for a minute don't prepare as a table for me in the presence of my enemies don't tell me you can have enemies because he wants to prepare table in the presence of your somebody preach back to me this morning I don't care what devil demons Marit give God the opportunity to prepare table for you in the presence of your enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over slowly goodness and mercy shall follow me wherever I go goodness and mercy whenever I leave my house goodness and mercy when I go to school goodness and mercy when I'm in the job goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever that's how heroes sweep speak like a hero walk like a hero talk like a hero live like a hero come on now somebody bridge back to me hallelujah you may be seated let the world keep your Superman and the black man and their black pant on let them keep those heroes I wanna be a real hero I wanna walk on water oh come on somebody talk to me I want to speak to the elements I wanna say little fish I give you back your life that's a real hero you may be seated you may be seen it for a minute a hero doesn't mean you won't get afraid because heroes is window when fear is there you still act when all have us against you then you act so unless sunset is hero speak listener a hero David speak Lord how are they increase that trouble me many I didn't rise up against me many their parents share my soul there is no help for him in God [Applause] that's how heroes sweep but Thou O Lord after shield for me my glory and the lifter of my head I cried unto the Lord with my voice and he heard me out of his holy hell hear the words of my hero this morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people that upset themselves against me round about could he take one more I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help my help cometh from the Lord which made heaven and earth he will not suffer thy foot to be moved and since your testimony this morning you don't know how you made it but by God's grace you making it because there's something in you that's rigged estimated to make it and last one if David was here this morning he would say I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the law remember the troubles can we get the Lord a hand of praise you may be seated [Music] hallelujah hallelujah so for a title this morning for such a time as this for such a time as this I remember their daily was speaking last night and he started to speak about Esther where the raishin might I tell you God is good I saw my notes that I just fly over the place but I want to speak a bit about Esther this morning but before I get to that in a message of blushing profit but the Perim said it ought to be the happiest time in the world for the Christian it ought to be the happiest time times are going to change the old is going to become young that's gonna fleet away sickness will be no more no more prayer meetings for the sick no more prayer meetings for the lost but God will come and take the elect from the four winds of the earth and shall gather them under his wings and we live and reign with him forever that's our promise oh brother sister friend of mine if you're not prepared tonight may you be prepared at this hour I give you an invitation to come to Christ tonight and receive you that's been different you don't know you're not where you should be with God I invite you to the altar with myself I invite every one of you to come here and not only see but to stay here in this meeting until God has kinds your soul from everything that's unlike him until you can go out of here a new person not with a corn plaster on will go out of here with a blood transfusion that purifies your blood and gives you new life and new hope go out with the baptism of the Holy Spirit can the church say man so I'm the happiest man alive this morning to see the fulfillment of Malachi fours message coming into view hallelujah I don't need to see an external sign I can see it happening because what is happening God already so for all of this and it's unfolding his plan and the Holy Spirit the dynamics is all over you this morning to get rid to baptize you by fire but the Branham said I'm identified with a group that feels a spirit of God I'm identified with a group that knows he's unreal no he's a same yesterday today and forever and know that this is not fanaticism it's Jesus Christ to see me yesterday and today and forever I'm identified with that group they are called a bunch of heretics yet a bunch of fanaticism an account of the Word of God but I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ for it's the power of God unto salvation so I'm an expectation for a church that Jesus Christ could walk into a church full of power a church to unite with the headstone a church that know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so for such a time as this do you know who you are church you are predestinated seeds of God the final voice to the final age a manifestation of the prophets prophesy in the message Christ is the mystery of God reveal I'm in a background now what are you gonna do when you get all that group together where the revelation is perfectly in harmony and God expressing it through his word by the same actions the same thing that he did making the world manifest oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the rapture will go can the church say Amen Oh hallelujah and the secret is out the bride knows who she is you couldn't come here by chance you didn't come here by accident young brother young sister all of the struggles and the child want to bring you to this squatter for you to know who you are somebody say man you may be seated national force but Israel in a homeland national force will put the church in the World Council of Churches but the power of God will put the people in the bride power cord is here this morning for such a time as this the world forces this way and the world forces that way but God forces upward the Spirit of God which is the word of God my word is spirit and life can the church say man that's the Thunder that shakes the devil oh we gonna preach the noel but i want to list some quotes down so we could begin to fly like a rocket this morning justification made away for sanctification sanctification made away for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself right back to perfection back to the word to manifest itself again for such a time as this Oh back to see in mark 16 in action where the Lord Himself went everywhere with them confirming the words with signs wonders and miracles oh my can we give the Lord a hand a praise you are predestinated unto adoption and they aren't enough Devils in hell to stop it who is strong enough who's cool enough to put one finger under bride impossible touch not my anointed to my prophets no harm the Holy Spirit anointed Word is here he's trying to get his church in order that same Holy Spirit is fixin things around trying to find sons and daughters cool cast a vision he may be seated leave this world and everything in it the Holy Ghost is here to give you a revelation the driver he wasn't getting up in the morning doing push-ups and curls and sit-ups and marching and practicing he had been abused year after year he would plant and when it's time for him to have his harvest the enemy would come until he came to a spot where he said enough is enough I'm not going through this again not another year not another convention I'm gonna come get something and the devil takes it back from me this time I will reap my harvest this time I will keep my you may be seated I'm gonna brand I'm traumatizes she said sham de might have had on little suspenders little coveralls he was no soldier but he grabbed the Ox cord he obscured his little piece of wood that he used to go the Aqsa push them and he took that and he didn't wait for the enemy he when he saw the enemy he ran out to meet them now listen I want you to picture this a whole army coming and there's one man with a stick running down to meet the enemy the enemy had to think twice because it has to be something crazy about a one-man army against army but that's what he rose to somebody preached back to me hallelujah she may be seated do you know what you're called to do Omega bright heroes we are called to manifest a living fate a living virtue we are cross a manifest charity we are called for God to have preeminence in this bribe timtam preeminence in the husband's in the father's in the children [Applause] you may be seated and now is the time but the balance of the time has come friends when something's gonna be said the time has come for the church to move up or go back but we can't stay in the same position the time has come for these things to be fulfilled time has come for gorgeo to rise in the scene and show himself these are all the prophets words the time has come now for you to make a decision you have a daily speak about choice last night make a decision what side you're on the time has come when we can't pet anymore but the madam said we got to preach the time has come to believe or don't believe the time has come to act upon what you know to be the truth there's an old saying if you know what to do and don't do it as if it is it's the same as if you don't know if you know what's right and you don't do it it's the same as if you don't know so it's time the Prophet said to act upon what you know to be the truth the time has come for a showdown in the message father the hour has come but the band said that time has come and God will gather his church together through under one great big banner of the Lord Jesus Christ and pour out his powers among them and great sign and wonderful tea please the time has come the time has come for the

promised I'm gonna visit you wait until them seven thunders uttered their voices and he's gonna send it he promised a revival he promised a visitation to the young people he promised ever him walking living talking can the church say Amen can the church say Amen so let me strike my text the year is around fortune on 83 BC and the people known as the Hebrews the churun of Israel the Jews they had been exiled and scattered trolli Empire of the Medes and the Persians the Medes and the Persians had just conquered the Babylonians and throughout biblical history whenever the churn of Israel sinned there were dire consequences as a result of their sin they were conquered by various kingdoms Daniel the prophet saw an image which represented a great kingdoms and at that time the world was ruled by a despotic monarch King I swear us as where the daily spoke of yesterday students of history would know him I another name 'search sees the Bible said he ruled from India to Ethiopia over 127 province the most powerful man in the world at that time and bratayley said yesterday he called a big celebration a big event to celebrate this was the third year of his reign he was three years into his ministry as it were and after the great display and after the seven days he called for his greatest treasure he called for Queen Vashti and vast he said she wasn't gonna come and the king was angry not only the king was angry but all of his men were angry the princes were angry the generals were angry and they said to themselves and they told the King King if you don't do something about this this flashy problem will become a world problem because all of our wives will refuse to come we'll be calling read the Bible so the princess went to the king and say please you have to do something because from large and small all the women will refuse to come when the men call them [Applause] so right there when the king partnered and the princess prominent they say lets us find a new queen and the Bible says for four years there was no queen because it was in the seventh year bear in mind that she was removed in the third year it was in the seventh year that Esther makes her appearance and I'm gonna tell it said she refused a dawning of the world she refused the styles of the world she had access to everything but she rejected it preferring to take counsel and how she could please the King come the church Shaymin but as always whenever God's children are getting put in place is always an enemy around looking and the Bible says there was a man called Heymann what makes human interesting is human should never have existed I must seen it lightly because Haman was of the descendants of the Amalekites and at that time the Amalekites should not have existed because instructions were given many years ago to wipe out all the Amalekites had the Amalekites been wiped out Haman would not have been born [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] listen to this the Bible says I went it sure enough Israel left Egypt I want you to catch the picture when the tournament's are left Egypt they had left from being slaves they were not warriors they were not fighters they had been slaves they had been in bondage they had no army they were no coming together as a people now the Bible speaks of Hittites Jebusites Amalekites philistines they all have their own attributes their own roles we didn't know this morning with the Amalekites the Bible said the Amalekites attacked them when they were at their weakest the Philistines our people our strength so they bring Goliath out because they don't want to be known as weak so they say send me a man to fight our strongman the Amalekites are different the Amalekites wait for when you're down and that's when the Amalekites spirit attacks you it's that one winner week is that one try to finish you off listen to Deuteronomy 25 17 listen to the Bible Deuteronomy 25 verse 70 remember when what Amalek did unto thee by the way when he came forth out of Egypt how he met thee by the way and smooth behind most of the even all that were feeble behind me when thou was famed and weary and he had not good therefore it shall be when the LORD thy God had given the rest from all the enemies round about in the land which the LORD thy God had given thee for an inheritance to possess that dole shall blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven so the instruction was wiped them out completely block out their memory from under heaven can the church say Amen but unfortunately instead of blood animal we find them recurring Exodus 17 then came Amalek and fought with Israel in referendum and Moses said unto Joshua choose out men and go and fight with amalek tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand so just what did as Moses that said to him and fought with Amalek and Moses Aaron and a hood went up to the top of the hill you remember that and it came to pass when Moses L of his hand that Israel prevailed and when he let down his hand Amalek revealed these are the same Amalekites but Moses hands were heavy and they took a stone and put it under him and he sat thereon and Aaron and Hur stayed up with his hands and one under one side and the other on the other side and his hands were steady until the going down of the Sun and Joshua discomforted Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword and the Lord of the Moses write this for a memorial in a book and rehearse it in the ears of Josefa for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven that's how God was serious about this and Moses built an altar and called the name of it Jehovah Nissi for he said because the Lord had sworn that the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation friends you should have killed all of the Amalekites in the message question and answer but Abraham said when Joshua entered the land of Canaan he said don't you let one of them live it was a cute little baby a little Amalekite oh and amirite kill it you remember he'll grow up to be an Amalekite he'll political and when these little things come back like that disagreeing with the Word of God it's an Amalekite spirit get rid of that thing I don't care what the nomination it belongs to you say well they're good I don't care how good of people they are if they are contrary to that word get that thing out of you it's a growing little Amalekite it looks cute looks innocent it looks like it's all right but don't have nothing to do with it you stay Oh from it you just remember listen to the Prophet any Amalekite and he describes it if he finds it anything that denies the word that's an Amalekite stay away from it have nothing to do with it how many believe that's the truth can the church say Amen [Applause] kill all the Amalekites by judges chapter three to trace this Amalekites spirit the Amalekites formed an alliance with more against the churn of israel by judges 6 when we meet Delia and the mighty man of Valor Gideon was raised up to fight Amelia Knights and judges 6 she says I'm so it was when Israel had shown that the Midianites came up and the Amalekites is still in hiding among the Midianites and the churn of the east even they came up against him this morning I'm tired of ism allegories we need to kill them all I could imagine as the Israel spies looking over at the meteorites asking what it was a Malachi still doing it I thought we had killed him I told me I'd wipe them all out can the church say man by the time we get to Samuel Sammy well sell on the soil in Samuel 1 the Lord sent me to anoint to be king over his people over Israel now therefore hearken unto the voice of the word of the Lord thus saith the Lord of hosts I remember that which I am elected to Israel so by the time you reach Samuel God is still talking about we need to get these Amalekites out how he lead wait for him in the way when he came up from Egypt no go and smite the first man leads Saul God was going smite he ammolite go and smite amalek and utterly destroy all that they have and spared him not but slip both man and woman in front and so on and so gather the people together and Saul came to the city of Amalek and live wheat in the valley and Saul said unto the Kenites go dpad get you down among the Amalekites let's I destroy you with them and so on and small soil smoothie America it's from hvala until they come to show and he took a gag the king of the Amalekites alive and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword but Saul and the people spear eager and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the fatlings and the Lambs and all that was good and would not utterly destroy them but everything that was vile and refused that they utterly destroyed in other words they destroy the stuff they didn't want but it was some stuff they wanted to keep their beating nice sheep soft idea like they kept it in cooling the king himself then came the word of the Lord at the Samuel seeing it repented me that I have set up Saul to be king for he has turned back from following me and had not performed my commandments and it grieves Samy when he cried unto the Lord all night and went semi well rose early to meet all in the morning it was it was told Samuel seeing Saul Kim to come out and be holy set him up on a police and is going about and passed on and down together and Samuel came to soil and soil on him blessed be thou of the Lord I have performed the commandment of the Lord and then Samuel as what meaneth then this bleating of this sheep why am i here she beated an alluring of oxen which I hear and Saul said they have brought them from the Amalekites for the people spread the best of the sheep and of the Occidental sacrifice unto the Lord and the rest we have utterly destroyed but these we have kept it as a sacrifice and Samuel said on the soles T and I will tell you what the Lord had said to me this night and he said unto him say on and Samuel said when dough was little in their own sight what stole not me the head of the tribes of Israel and a lot of no entity king over Israel in other words Samuel is putting soil in his place and the Lord send me on a journey and said go and utterly destroy the sinners the malachite and fight against them until they become soon wherefore tenderness doumitt obey the voice of the Lord but there is fly upon the spoil and did its evil in the sight of the Lord and source it on the summer year I have appeared the voice of the Lord and I've gone the way which the Lord sent me and I've brought a gag the king of Amalek and I utterly destroy the Amalekites but the people took up the spoil sheep an ox and the chief of things which should have utterly been destroyed to sacrifice and that's where we see obedience is better than sacrifice and Sammy well said on the soil I will not return with me for thou has rejected the word of the Lord can the church see man halleluyah halleluyah halleluyah blessed be the name of the Lord can we give the Lord a hand the praise now so by the time we get to Queen Esther we have here money aggregate without the line of King Agag these Amalekites find a way weaving all over and now we understand why Monica I could not bow to him because this was the Amalekites spirit Mordecai was not just not born because but it was the same Malachi - I come true so when everybody else is bumming on to this Amalekite is human Mordecai the unknowing is to bow before no man an order clock he's wondering why is this a malachite still alive we might be in bondage but I still have to bow to normal okay I kept in the lands of the Medes and the Persians but I will not prouder and Amalekites come to church Shaymin you may be seated I'm God always has a witness the Bible says every day they tried to convince Mordechai turbo every day to try to come miss Mordechai to believe that the way they believes it's ok to about him now bear in mind all the other children of Israel who were there oh boy except Mordechai they wanted Mordechai to see that these Americans are passed they wanted Mordecai to say we're never gonna have a revival they wanted more than I to say we we making too much noise and we shouldn't act us where it was it Mordecai to conform and bow down to order and to bow down to a system and Monique I said no I can't do this that's not what I'm built or - I Know Who I am I could be in prison but I know who I am I could be in Egypt but I Know Who I am I could be in Nigeria but I know who I am I could be in America but I Know Who I am and church seamen and it angered Heymann because that spirit upon him and wanted worship can the church say man and Satan is mad because you refuse to worship Him and you worship the real King you worship your Lord can the church say man you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Heymann was so angry he didn't even want to take it out on Mordecai alone he say let's wipe out everybody and that's what the enemy has tried to do wipe out everybody he said I can't kill Monica alone I want to kill all the Jews then he mad said unto the king there's a certain people scattered abroad they dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom and their laws are diverse from all people this is some familiar their laws are different from all people neither keep thee there's a king's laws in other words they have their own laws they have their own Kingdom it would seem they they seem to have their own king they live among just but they're not of us they don't seem to respect the way we do things it they go to our schools but they operate differently they walk the streets where they are differently they're dispersed throughout all your provinces all 127 provinces you'll find one there you'll find one there they don't respect our style they don't respect the fashions they don't want the music we have bit they don't want to go to the parties we go to knit they don't want to go to the clubs we go to knit they don't want the careers we want they are dispersed you can find them everywhere hallelujah Heyman said it is therefore not for the king's profit so to suffer them in other words you shouldn't tolerate them anymore if they will not bow down to what we want can the church say man but bear in mind you may be seated for a minute Esther had gotten comfortable Esther had gotten comfortable in the palace in someone that she didn't even know what was going on have we gotten so comfortable that you don't know what's going on and it took him means to bring her word that they were sighing and crying for the abomination in the city and she heard true amazed that Mordechai was in sackcloth and ashes Esther was out of the spirit because she was caught up in the palace of fears and being Queen and the trappings and the responsibilities and the pristine because Monica Ayatollah don't let them know who you are so she was really an undercover agent but some day my people go undercover they forget the country they really came from during the Cold War and those times won't pass they would put these sleeper agents from different countries and it would send them from young to grow up in a country but it's always a risk we gotta teach you this is your country this is your country go down spy for us but some men despise go and they fall in love with the country didn't and they forget the spy they forget their spy she loved the food they love the clothes they haven't been home in so long they get used to waking up at a different time zone and they'd get disconnected and so he has Esther she is she safe she is queen and she is disconnected to the pain that's happening on the outside but then she gets word she gets wood she gets word that her same cousin who are given a council was in sackcloth and ashes he was sighing and crying because their people were in trouble [Music] and that's where we really scripture Mordecai commanded to tell us to think not with thyself that dull shall escape in the king's house more than all the Jews for if altogether the whole list I peace at this time then shall enlargement and deliverance arise now Mordecai seen if you want to help you can help deliverance is coming no matter what because this is God's people if you hold your peace have will come from another place the issue is that if help is coming the issue is where it's coming from you are in a position to do something about it how do you not know for such a time as this you have been placed where you are bill please can the church say man [Applause] hallelujah blow [Music] halleluyah halleluyah hallelujah let's it be the name of the Lord hallelujah you may be seated so here it is Esther is now on the Commission to go before the king and she reach a point in her lives if I perish I perish but I'm gonna go to see the king because I can't take it for granted because my identity will have to come out at some point somebody will expose me and I'll be dead no matter what and listen young brother young sister you could try to hide in the world as long as you want to hide your identity will come out sometime because there's something about your life that's peace yes similar pulses that she German your soul could only produce one thing that she jump in the hot compartment could only produce faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness charity that she can only produce the life give the Lord a shout of praise hallelujah hallelujah for such a time as this that's why we were born and Esther understand how to put things together you may be seated she organized a special dinner special feast you know you have to know how to approach things and she invite and meet I'm caught walking on every side the king is getting trouble to sleep any ask him to get to get to scribes get to get the guys with the archives let him read something for me and and as the king is trying to sleep here reading and there was one time two men were conspiring against you and and then a man came and Mordecai said that there was a conspiracy and he's here he said what did we do to this to reward this man I heard you mention what we did for him let's arrange faster - a blessing for this - that's a real truster to reward this man for what and I love our border prisoner he is the king now sitting down with him and you know the story he said what shall the king do to the man who who protects the throne and who does good for the people and and him and who has such an exaggerated sense of self-importance you can give him a robe you can give him your ring you can put them on your horse you're gonna walk him through the city [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I'm here - looking and I can't even imagine him and he has seen seeing the robe upon him seeing the ring upon him seeing the horse he loved worships we see the people shouting and the king said all that you just said go do it - Monica [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you may be seated [Applause] somebody give God a shout of praise baby seal and there it was had the feasts s in your majesty I just want you to know that my people are in trouble and I'm in trouble and you can imagine when the King hears this why are you in trouble who but me out of their thoughts to put you in trouble Haman the Amalekites this one the King said hang him from the same caboose hang him high so they will see and that's what's about to happen to your enemy every devil every demon how dare the enemy come against the pride of Jesus Christ don't you know who you are don't you know that for such a time as this you were raised up Oh blessed be the name of the Lord [Applause] hallelujah you may be seated so truth scripture every ministry had a specific purpose and a specific time so every time a prophet came into his place it was was for such a time as this every time a king came into his place it was for such a time as this when all hell raised up God raised up somebody for such a time as this and in our team God has raised us up for such a time as this when cross darkness upon the earth and gross darkness upon the people the Bible said arise shine for thy light is come it's for such a time as this but the Brennan said the lid of Hell has opened up and streams of demon powers have been loosed against this world but for such a time as this God has raised up another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age don't let the level deceive you don't let the devil deceive you this is your time this is your season this is your hour this is your revival you are caught Omega bride heroes [Applause] hallelujah give the Lord a shout of praise hallelujah Oh mine and listen God in order to make sure that you don't miss it he sent a love letter for you the message is your message it's not the prophets message it's your message the prophet is the messenger his job was to bring the message to you and the church amen so every time we come to the house of God we are reading from this love letter reading from this love letter because this love letter describes his nature you may be seated young people don't know what we're talking about too much whatsapp too much messenger and all this but years ago there was something on a love letter you would write this letter and you would mail it it might take two weeks I might take a month eggomatic two months and the puss would wait with bated breath to get this letter to find out what is gonna be said and in this letter the person writing the letter would describe themselves and maybe ask questions about you so I like oranges what do you like you see I have a minute it's a long time right you may be seated so for all the ages God wrote this love letter he said I'm gonna provide for you I'm gonna make sure that you don't cry and if you do have a tear wipe the tears if you get in trouble I'll come to you need you guys I'll be your present help in time of trouble now somebody could pick this up but because of the dress to them it doesn't mean much to them but when the words from the letter is read to you it means something to you [Applause] and written in that letter is when all hell is against you for such a time as this that's why I put you there for such a time as this that's why and listen this wedding is about to happen and God want you to know about him before you can marry him can the church team and that's why this message is a message of life it's a message of power it's a message of truth it's a message of adoption it's a message of perfection it's a message of revival it's a message of victory it's a message of source how to go it's a message for all families it's a message for our children it's a message of our healing it's a message that's vindicated it's a message that has already overcome and if that message is pulsating in your soul we are more than conquerors we are more than victorious for such a time as this don't tell me you're in trouble for such a time as this you are dear to deal with the trouble you are there to deal with the problem can the church seem and this message can never feel this message overcame in the days of Martin it overcame in the days of Kalama it overcame in the days of Wesley it overcame in the Pentecostals it overcame in the days of the Prophet this message could never fail never be defeated never be defeated glory to God hallelujah you may be seated [Applause] but about Senator rapture and feet it's laying in the message it's there it's already there redemption is laying in the message it's already there this message cannot be manhandled no group has a monopoly on this message it belongs to you it is your message you are bride of Jesus Christ he's coming to meet you he's coming to deliver you he's coming to redeem you and the church amen [Applause] [Music] somebody give bought a shout of praise I'm not gonna be too much longer but this is our time now I believe it this is our season it's our season for revival it's our season for deliverance is our season for breakthrough it's our season for the Holy Ghost to pour out it's our season without seven thunders to utter its forces of that group it's a season for the spoken word it's a Caesar beautiful set every mountain it's a four-season need to clean your family it's a season please no pull down your portion it's your season we don't walk over the neck of the devil it's your season for victory and the church amen so is this the time for such a time as this God promised it and that settles it I believe it that settles it nothing could change my mind I could be tired but my man is not changed you know where the Bible said Abraham staggered not at the promise he was getting all up but the promise he didn't stagger at the promise he held on to the promise because he was the man for his time he was the man for his season in every season God has somebody and I'm looking this morning at men and women of this season men and women of this hour can the church say man give the Lord a shout of praise [Applause] let's settie the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah you made me see the fruit manners o glory glory glory so what are you talking about I'm talking about this last day endtime ministry this furyk ministry where the child had his mission the time has come the manifestation of the omega bride he rose and by the Branham said that he's speaking about Jesus is the principal theme of the Bible he was in the prophets he was in the Psalms so when we read about David we really reading about Jesus can the church say man he was in the history of the Bible the Bible is prophetic book it's a historical book it's a book of love it's a book of songs it's a book of life and in there you find Christ he was in the prophets he was in the Psalms he was in the history he also in the Bible is the things that is to come so he was before until after what does that make him then the same yesterday today and forever and the church say man so young people it will not be you it'll be Christ in you working his way out can the church say man forget about your problems forget about your child in this meeting chorus will visit you with a wonderful glorious baptism of the Holy Ghost on fire you may be seated so what are you looking for Verizon I'm looking for that same hero spirit David's ministry to come back on the scene again can the church say man Jesus came with three titles all the same person but tree titles just like father son Holy Ghost came a son of God son of man and son of David King I'm Betty Branham said when David was king he was the greatest King that ever lived and he good outside of Christ when he was here it's a Ministry of kingship gia was called the son of David Matthew 1:1 the book of the generation of Jesus Christ the Son of David the son of Abraham can the church say man and team it's ministry was to do God's will a man after my own heart who will do my will can the church say man I'm getting ready to whine now now gonna talk about divas bishop you started with David gonna end with David but if I'm setting perfect shrimp by proving weakness that's what the matter today God's got a lot of sheep that's gone astray the organization and things have strolled them out brought them out into psychology but God give us David's give us some heroes with the Word of God and the power of God to direct it when we go to meet these intellectual Giants or whatever it might be giving me the Word of God and the power of the Holy Ghost and I'll tell you it's Lee every giant and the field but a parent said David was the poorest excuse there was on the field to fight the giant he was nothing with a boy and the Bible said he was ruddy a little scrawny looking fella probably stoop-shouldered piece of sheepskin wrapped around him he didn't have none of these big intellectual degrees and well-trained he knows nothing about a sword he know nothing about the training of Saul Saul was the best he could have had bishops all but I better call him he was head and shoulders over the rest of the army he was the one or two when and thought but he was scared and today we know we need a revival we know we need a stirring amongst the people and it will not take a doctor of divinity it'll take a week it'll take the power of God in the power of the resurrection of Christ and else later sing it'll big Christ of the country and let them see you can still open the eyes of the blind heal the sick raise the dead he is God Conqueror we need a David untrained in the theological schools we need a man who knows nothing about that some little plow boy or something some little guy will reserves to shoulders not much to look at will come walking down the road with the power of God but about said you are David's you are called elected anointed positionally put in the body of Jesus Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost Goliath you're defeated that's the prophets words Goliath you're defeated he's defeated tonight he's defeated this morning he is defeated in this contention give the Lord a shout of praise for such a time as this [Applause] hallelujah he merely seated greeting Omar but Abraham said when David went to visit his brothers whatever I said he came to bring some reasons bring some food for them and when Tveit got to the convention they activate David why are you here who was taking care of the Sheep I'm David I could imagine sitting alone I just came to drop some food and I'm going back to take a bishop because they were partially embarrassed because for a few days they have been under pressure and they didn't want Eva to know this was their testimony so David why are you here who's thinking ship go quickly I'm taking up the ship they didn't want everything here Goliath but I can imagine David is walking away bye guys bye see you next time that's when the laia decide this is send me a man I like it imminent Aviles [Applause] [Music] [Applause] what am I missing David go take care of the sheep this is only for soldiers you're not big enough you're not strong enough you don't have the experience we went to military school I have my degree in fighting so why are you not fighting [Applause] you mean I'm more of a fighter than you go one time I was taking a sheep and a lion came I ain't got no degree in fightin but when a lion came the Spirit of the Lord came upon me and in a beer demon and the Spirit of the Lord come upon me I am confident I am persuaded nothing present nothing last nothing to come see I'm gonna go fight him he may be seated and I could imagine David's brothers reluctantly bring him this hero to King Saul Saul is so black slit and he grabbing at straws he said you ready to fight come come come come we taking anybody right now the army is open anybody can come anybody anybody can come into the army [Music] here's David he's not trusting in his ability he's not Justin and how long he's been in a message he's not trusting in his tribe he's not trusting in man he's trusting in God young people your trust must being caught and there's King Saul blessed soil he's trying to do the best he can he said listen I just had this armor come out the factory while we have not been fighting I've been building armors [Music] this is the freshest latest Hummer he said could you try on this armor and this David they were trying to walk in this armor and they were trying to move in his armor you see I don't feel comfortable I want to move faster than this I wanna I need to move my legs I need to be able to lift my hands he said I can't worship the way I want to worship in a way called heresy I can't I can't shout when I'm with the Sheep I'm normally dancing them I'm not doing no my when I'm when I'm out there having a good time I'm by myself but but I'm David so I'm always singing I'm right and I'm dancing I'm dancing in the spirit this arm up this denominational alma this arm of identification is too much for me I'll go without it and the church say man we are preaching with a hero this morning what weapons will you go with I have my sling and I have my stones you have not filled me yet Saul just gave up and here's little David walking out to meet Goliath that's what I love about God he can take the unlikely person and turn them into our hero listen David didn't even know what was gonna happen but he was walking in faith he was walking in faith he was walking in sin he did not know what was about to happen [Applause] but a testimony of Jesus's spirit of prophecy so David is standing there and Goliath comes out and the lad is not what you think he is so big he's slow he is so big you can't miss him he's so big he can't hide and here comes David I'll chop your head off guess this is the best that Israel could send you sent a boy now feed it to the birds and I could just see David put a little strong in a sling you know the story and he starts to just swing I mean stairs and I don't know what was going on but as he's swinging I could see
