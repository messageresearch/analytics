for ala John A young soldier who was shut and was on her vehicle stolen on Monday night while on her way to work for physical mental healing and recovery of a vehicle till today the bullet was still not new from my legs but George sent this request want to pray father God I pray for Le John that your holy spirit will visit and deliver and set free most of all that she'll come to know in your Saving Grace and knowledge father may this prayer request become a not of Praise in Jesus name I ask it we thank you Lord we thank you Lord and father as we approach your word tonight I pray that you would come and breathe Upon Us Lord bring the breath of life and may divine revelation bring forth upon your people tonight and will you confirm your word with signs wonders and miracles we ask in Jesus name amen and amen God bless you uh tonight we want to turn to two portion of scripture Romans 4 uh what I think I'll do I'll read a second scripture first Romans 1 uh verse 16 and 17 and I'll let you have your seats and we're going to go to Romans 4 Romans 1 verse 16 and 17 and it reason this wise Paul speaks for I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the the Greek for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith as it is written the J shall live by faith you may be seated or praise God may God bless his word and we want to turn to Romans chapter 4 we want to go through that that chapter Romans chapter 4 what shall we say then that Abraham our father as per to the flesh had found for If Abraham were justified by works he had where of the glory but not before God but what sayth the scripture Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh is the reward not reckon of Grace but of debt but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justify the ungodly his fate is counted for righteousness even as David describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputed righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin come this blessedness of them on the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that Faith here we go was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not in circumcision but but in uncircumcision and he received a sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the Fate which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but also who walk in the steps of that fate of our Father Abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised for the promise verse 13 that he should be the heir of the world was not that Abraham ought to recede through the law but through the righteousness of faith for if they which are of the law be ears faith is made void and the promise made of none effect because the law worketh rra for there where there's no law is there is no transgression therefore here we go it is of shout out it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believe even God who quickeneth the dead and calth those things which be not as though they were were who against hope believe in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken soal Li he be and being not weak in fate he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a 100 years old yet the yet the deadness of s's wom he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in giving glory to God so your faith shows by your giving glory to God and verse for anyone being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform and tonight we have to be fully persuaded that what this God promised to this last day Prophet messenger he is able to perform and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness and it was not written for his sake alone and it was imputed to him but for us also here we go to whom it shall be imputed oh gor if we believe on him that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead who was delivered for our offenses and was raised up for our justification and this is the time to give God some Praises right now oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah praise be to Jesus we love him tonight we thank God tonight so the title of the message tonight is the righteousness of Faith the righteousness of faith and of a subject the righteousness of God is revealed from fi to Faith all right let's go now Paul sorry didn't send the whole Cy but shame put some of the scriptures up but suffer to be so Paul in Galatians chapter 3 was rebuking the Galatians he was talking about you foolish Galatians having begun in the spirit are you now made perfect by the flesh have you suffered many things in vain and then he said he therefore that minister to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you doeth he by The Works of the Lord or by the hearing of Faith even as Abraham believed God and it was counted for him for righteousness now the church didn't start this way the church end up in this mode that Paul had us to rebuke them from going into a level of legalism and law and not staying in that level of Faith so he said even as Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness know ye therefore that they which are of Faith the same as the children of Abraham amen so Paul was rebuking them but I want to get this here in the Amplified and the proph and and this is verse three here are you so foolish and so senseless and so silly having begun your new life spiritually with the Holy Spirit are you not reaching for Perfection by dependence on the flesh does Abraham believe and this is Father F me out does Abraham believe in and adhere to and trusted in and relied on God and it was reckoned here we go and placed to his account and credited as righteousness Hallelujah Abraham faith and belief was credited to his account as as righteousness which is Conformity to the Divine will in purpose thought and action know and understand it is really the people who live by faith Who are the true sons of Abraham oh give the Lord a shout tonight now you know why God in a prophet right to turn our hearts back to what the fate of the fathers that we can live by faith that we can talk by faith that we can speak by faith Oh Glory to God we can walk by faith because the just shall live by faith huj Oh Glory to God and the scriptures foreing that God would justify or declare righteous or put in right standing with himself the Gentiles in consequence of Faith oh give the Lord some Praises tonight Hallelujah then those are the people of Faith are blessed and made happy and favored by God as partners in fellowship and believing and trusting Abraham oh this is special to me tonight oh glory to God Hallelujah the righteousness of Faith what God sees Oh Glory to God we know we we know we know James talk about the works but but but Paul was talking about what God see and what and J what what man see man see the action of Faith by how you live by what you do but I want to bring something to you tonight this faith is going to raise you above your circumstance raise you above your present condition this Faith you have to keep that faith and you can understand why Jesus told Peter the devil desire the like wheat but I pray that your faith fail not okay the Lord some Praises it was very important that Peter hold the faith because that is where you fail Oh Glory to God Hallelujah if you hold that Faith to believe you're a Christian you hold that Faith to believe you a son you're a daughter of the Living God and you have power in You by Revelation by the word to overcome any attack that the enemy could loose against you oh God you're going to overcome you're going to stand this Faith Revelation going to raise you above your present circumstance Oh Glory to God you will take your feelings out of it oh the just shall live by feelings the just shall live by faith it will take your OT tions out of it the just shall live by emotions is just shall live by faith glory to God too much of Christians going by their feelings by their emotions by their five senses but that's not what we called to live by we are called to live by faith we are here by faith Tonight We Stand By Faith tonight we are Christians by faith tonight we are sons of God by faith tonight we are going to be filled by faith tonight delivered by faith tonight sealed by faith tonight heal heal by faith [Applause] tonight Glory Job chapter 1 verse one just want to run through job a little bit there's a man in the land of us who I don't know how to pronounce that whose name was job and that man was perfect and upright one that fear God and ued Evil hate evil and there were born unto him seven sons three daughters his substance was 7,000 sheep 3,000 camels 500 yoke of oxen 500 she asses and a very great household and this man was the greatest of all men of the East his sons went and feasted in the house everyone his day sent and called for their three sisters to eat and drink to them there the five there the boss verse here now verse 5 it was so that when the days of their feasting were going about that sent and Sanctified them rose up early in the morning offered burnt offering according to the number of them all for job said he his word it may be that my sons have sin and curse God in their hearts thus did job continually so job was assuming just in case these guys sin just in case my family is screwed up and messed up I am going to offer in advance I'm going to place on the altar in advance he don't even know if they do anything but just in case I am doing what God Said to do that my family can be covered Glory that I I can still be counted as righteous because God just tell me to do this and everything will be all right oh give the Lord a shout night now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord Satan came among them and the Lord said un Satan hey whence thou comest down then San answered to the Lord and said from going to and fr in the Earth from walking up and down in it but this is what he actually does the Lord said unto Satan has thou considered my servant job there is none like him in the earth a perfect and upright man one that fearth God and ISU evil shuns evil Run Away From Evil then Cesar answered the Lord and said that God fear God does job fear God for not and other words he a business deal he he a fear you for nothing hast thou not made a hedge about him about his house but all that he had on every side thou has blessed the work of his hands his substance is increased in the land put forth thy hand now and touch all that he had he will curse into thy face Hallelujah so the down to board Tire hitting the road the devil letting God know the only reason job is acting like that is because you bless him you have a head around him you multiply him you increase him you anoint him just take W from him you will curse it to your face and the Lord said unto Satan Lord behold all that he had is in thy power only upon himself but not forth thine hand so job so Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord Brother BR and he's talking about job let's take that old man name of job now there's a reason why I'm reading this I want you to get a picture here there's nobody like him in the day there was a prophet people come from Far near to hear job God blessed him he prospered he was a rich man he had thousands of cattle and sheep and and whatnot he would go in the streets young princess from the East that's the mag the wise astronomer they were saying and I would bow before him just to ask a word of his wisdom he was a smart man he was a prophet so the devil looked down he saw what job a smart man I'll show you how smart man does now coming back to the text praise God he said you know my children is married going off and per Adventure one of them might Sinn here we go now there is one requirement God had that's a burnt offering he said now he didn't believe his children sin but per Adventure they might sin because they're visiting one another they're going to parties one other homes and so forth if one of them sin so Lord I will bring a burnt offering and offer this burnt offering for my child and that's all he know to do because that's all god require a burnt offering that's all we require so then the great Midnight Hour come and struck Paul job was in a condition he lost his cattle his sheep storms killed his children burnt his servants his own heal fail in the backyard Ash sheep Boke he broke down with boils and scraping his boils and then his Consolers turned their back on him and they told him he sinned now this is this is an important service tonight it may sound flat but it's more than you think the church member the Deacon board whatever it was come and see him we set seven days there they're telling him job you might as well make a confession because you have sinned because God wouldn't let a righteous man be tormented like that but God does let a righteous man be tormented like that and the people say and only 10% say that we not a big crowd tonight but every I I supposed to hear everybody inside that we could count the numbers here tonight because because you have sinned God wouldn't let a righteous man be tormented like that but God does let a righteous man be tormented like that you see God that's the thing happened to us because we sin but sometime it is a testing of a saint instead of chasing a sinner hey you hear that sometime it's testing of a saint instead of chastening of a sinner we find out that job was a righteous man though and when God was testing him because Satan said sure when he come before God with the sons of God he said you consider my and Joe perfect man nobody like him and S like that he's a perfect man and that was before the blood of Jesus was shed God called job a perfect man because job was keeping the requirement of God in that day and God said you are perfect you are righteous you are Justified Oh Glory to God hallelujah so Satan say let me have him one time and make him to your face Satan he's in your hands God said don't take his life and that was God's trust that his Prophet would not fail him and he is trusting you and I that we won't fail him CH got killed cattle killed all his riches was lost lost his health everything but his life scraped his Bo his wife came to the door Satan got into her and said look out there said why don't you curse God and die you look so miserable he said th speakest like a foolish woman he didn't said you Wicked Woman all the money I give you buy a house for you buy a car and look at you now you're ungrateful richet no he didn't say that he did not say that he said oh speakest like a foolish woman he never said she was foolish she talked like one you speak like a foolish woman he said the Lord give and the Lord take it away blessed be the name of the world and of the Lord in other words naked came I in the world naked I will return but blessed be the name of the Lord anyhow I never had nothing when I come here and I will go away with nothing but blessed be the name of the Lord give God some Praises hallelujah hallelujah the accusation on job was that he's a secret Sinner and job stay part I am not a sinner so this thing we all born in s God they call us to remain sinners in church that's foolishness that's nonsense that's that's backing in your mind and heart and spirit God called you out of that that you could be free from sin even Jesus said who the son of man set free is free indeed God want to free you from your past your fears your sin your failures your mistakes and cause you to be righteous oh give the Lord a shout in the house the righteousness of faith not your your righteousness his righteousness that he credit to your [Applause] account woo he credited to your account and consider you as righteous and not asking to feel us th righteous he said so God said [Music] [Applause] so job you don't want to confess because you're secret sinner you're doing it secretly and God is punishing you for it and that's the reason that things are not going the for for you the way they are and listen job said no sir I am not a sinner I wonder if the message people could handle that to say that back I am not a sinner because he was standing P upon that righteousness of God that burnt sacrifice he offered it he knew he doing that every day it's every day he doing that per Adventure his son sin per Adventure he sin every day he's offering a sacrifice hallelujah oh glory to God and he knew based upon what he's doing in obedience to God he is considered righteous so he could tell them to the face I am not a sinner Oh Glory to God I'm not 20 40 years in the message I'm still a sinner oh give the Lord some Praises that's why he talk about come on on the sin question and let's talk about the growth question how you going to grow in God how you going to go higher how you going to go to the next level Oh Glory to God because you have to come to Perfection oh give the Lord some Praises [Music] tonight he was standing P upon that righteousness of God that burnt offering he offered it that he had to offer that's all god require you notice after the spirit of God come on the prophet everything he got back God restored back job when he had 10,000 cattle he give him 20,000 cattle so he get double for his trouble you you see where he had 40,000 sheep he gave him 80,000 sheep after he test over he God double him in know He restored everything back to him notice He restored his seven children he gave job his seven children back because he was righteous because he was standing on everything that God gave us to be righteous or give him was to offer a burnt offering and he says what do you ever think where those children was they died right they was in heaven waiting for him because God give him his children and even died they they went ahead of him he getting back all his children go give the Lord some Praises devil is a liar tonight glory to God let's go if job took a act upon the very thing that God told him to do the only thing it was to be righteous was to offer a burnt offering that was righteous he saved job and his house then what is righteous before God and he answers it believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou and thy house shall be [Applause] saved is that too simple is that too flat you need more mysteries on top of that you my histories and all kind of deep kind of Revelations up of that believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou and thy house shall be saved oh give the Lord some praise us tonight where where that come from Acts chapter 16 we want to go from verse 16 of act chapter 16 and this was the story of this this um what you call boy be pimps I don't know call him them days but there was pimping a woman with a divination Spirit making money off of this woman and verse 16 said he came the past as we went to prayer a certain damel possessed with a spirit of divination met us which brought a master's much gained by suit saying so that suit saying witchcraft do lady the same followed Paul and cried these men are the servers of the most high God which show us the way of Salvation is that Spirit saying that every day the terrorizing Paul with this and this did she many days but Paul being grieved turned he wasn't speaking to the woman note and said to the spirit I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out over and it came out of her that very hour he's not talking to the woman the spirit that's saying that spoke to the spirit and then her master saw that the hope of their Gams was gone so business bur for she she Su that suitan anointing leave she do she say again they called Paul and Silas drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers brought them to the magistrate these men being Jews do exceedingly trouble our city teaching Customs which are not lawful for us to receive need to observe being Ro and the multitude rose up against them mud rent off their clothes and commanded to beat them licks Christian say I ain't sign up for that but they rent off their clothes and they commanded to beat them and they were laid many stripes upon them how how people in me deal with that I'm a Son of God I are not supposed to get licks is this brother Paul we talking about and they laid many stripes upon them cast them into prison charging the Jailer to give them safely who having received such a charge trust them into the inner prison and made their feet fasten the stalks and at midnight Paul and Silas prayed that's after lcks you see tired here C after LS after being stripped and embarrassed and shamed at midnight Paul and silus prayed and sang Praises unto God so they wasn't only saying help me Lord God God is pre they were singing praises God you are good you are merciful you you deserve all the honor all the glory the lord Give the Lord take it away singing praises do you sing praises they sing praises because they had Faith inside of them they had Fai singing praises is like offering a sacrifice unto God your lips giving praise to God they were offering spiritual sacrifices oh giving God praise oh give the Lord a shout in the house that is how we have to live thanking God for every day not grumpy and cursing and and and amen Fring and angry and upset and frustrated and you fed up and you can't take it no more not that foolishness but they was praising God in prison after getting licks oh give the Lord some Praises you ain't get no licks and you're not in prison oh you could be praising double oh give the Lord a shout your mouth should be open and double than than those guys but the Clarance they was in prison after getting licks and they were praying and praising godj Hallelujah midnight Silas Paul and Silas prayed sang praise to God and the prisoners heard them so the God was hearing them every was hearing them they wasn't shy and they burn you know people frighten to pray over the meal and what not they wasn't in that you know they was praising they was praying suddenly there was an earthquake so the foundation of the prison was shaken and immediately all the doors were open and every one band was loosed and the key Keeper of the prisoner waking out of his sleep seeing the prisoner open he Dr his sword and would have killed himself supposing that the prisoner had fled but Paul cried out with a loud voice do thyself no harm for we are all here we free but we here hallelujah our bands are loose but we are here hallelujah the Prison Walls fall down but we are still here oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah then he called for a light and sprang in and came trembling fell down before Paul and Silas brought them out and said s what must I do to be saved this is the God now this God recognize something is Supernatural happening and they said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shall be saved and thy house oh give the Lord a praise offering is this the gospel this is the gospel you know oh glory to God and they spake unto him the word of the Lord and to all that were in his house and he took them the same hour of night and washed their stripes and was baptized in all this straight away no time to waste that man was baptized you and your house glory to God and brother brandham he was talking the same story Paul didn't even need the devil to assist him in anything say you're a man of God and you come to show the away and he turned around rebuked the spirit of the woman and when it did it caus an uproar when they found out the spirit left her she couldn't could not tell no more fortunes so you don't understand now all them fortune tellers is a spirit on them they telling people fortune and people just paying for their Fortune all right and the one that had hired her taken care of her caused a great uproar and they were beaten and put in jail and I can imagine Paul and Silas laying there old buggy jail in the inner courts way back the outside where the best prisoner I kept was bad enough but they was on the inside they put put them on inside inside and did you ever see stocks I had the privilege of seeing them they put it around your feet they put it around your hands and they put them across your neck so his neck hands and feet you have your bind that call stocks any stock market there a different kind of stock there a different kind of stock and just think Paul and Silas for preaching the gospel was laying back there in that old D Place probably rats mice bugs on them what a place for a man preaching the gospel and we think today we complain because we have things a little hard look what they did knowing what was waiting them perhaps execution next morning but they were faithful they were shout out they were they were faithful then they stayed faithful and about midnight I could just think how they must have felt their back stick into the old dirt and might was the leprosy everything on the floor Lane against old hard floor dirt floor rats running around and the midst of all of that perhaps no supper beaten till they were bleeding bruised and sore no doctor to wash out the wounds or anything for infection that we used today something like that just throw them back there and put them in the stocks put them in the condition but they wasn't complaining am I preaching to someone here tonight but they wasn't complaining no not one word of complaint came from them what is your complaint tonight Oh Glory they should rebuke you not one complaint from them and knowing maybe next morning magistrate will probably call them before the Emperor or the sadrin and executive of preaching this heresy we find out among midnight Paul and SAS must have talked about the Lord until midnight then they begin to sing hymn some good old hymns like there's power in the blood oh oh I love Jesus and then they begin to sing all of a sudden an earthquake struck the place notice how it is done instead of piling those walls of that big building right on top of them and smashing them to death it shook the walls away from them so this was a different kind of earthquake instead of the walls cave in the walls cave out and free them from the walls so you want to tell me God cast an earthquake in your life and free you and break the stocks off of you right now some of you are stocks God want to break that off of you all them binding Powers all them hindrance hindrances in your life and then in prayer and then in pray and then your in finances and then your business then whatever you do that God will break that hindrance off of your life oh give the Lord some Praises I believe you're going to be broken tonight I believe you're going to understand what faith really is tonight and what god require of us to present as righteousness oh give the Lord some Praises tonight Hallelujah over their feet over their hands over their neck they will set free everyone of them now instead of that big old heavy Roman prison breaking in on them it fell away from them not only but the shackles and things fell off of them that is our God when we hold out faithful Oh Glory to God and God have been testing Believers for years to see if they'll be faithful I know the really trial come yet people just being tested if it could hold on hold on until the trial could come people getting frightened did you hear what I just said God testing people and they fall off like flies and the test they come yet the test is just to hold on you know because the time is not yet division is true but the time is long you have to wait for the appointed time my God I feel inspired tonight but said Jesus was behind a veil how he say it boy like a he said like behind a a curtain and even though he went and die his Spirit couldn't come up because they said three days so that three days kept him behind all the power he had he couldn't break that because the word said three days is so you have to wait there till that time run out oh give the Lord some Praises there's a law of the word you can't break that oh glory to God time appointed you can't break that time of life you cannot break that appointed time you cannot break that harest time you cannot break that time of harvest you cannot break that oh God everything there's a season and time to Everything Under the Sun and there's going to be a BRI Revival you can't break that there's going to be a seven T Revival you cannot break that oh there be a super Church you can't stop that oh have super race you can't stop that manifestation of the sons of God you cannot stop that adopted s you can't stop that allil that's still coming coming soon coming soon coming soon Hallelujah Give the Lord a shout in the house don't let his STS bother you don't let the prison bother you give him a shout in the house Paul knew he had to get out of here so he get to praise God Stager not at the promise of God to unbel what was strong in faith these guys live by faith hallelujah oh my Hallelujah that's our God when we hold on faithful we must stay faithful and as long as we are faithful and we might not be in that kind of shape now I I hope we don't get like that but we can be faithful and what we go through with maybe it's a persecution maybe somebody laugh at you maybe somebody say you old time your only ruler let's be faithful just the same because are you ready God respects our faithfulness to that just the same as he respect their faithfulness to what they had to go through we find out that Roman Centurion knowing he would answer with his own life he pulled out his sword because he know the prison escape he he gone that's how it is he's a finished man so he say let me finish me before them finish me take myself first before them take me he go go and kill himself right he pull out his sword soon he found out they were gone started to kill him to kill himself take his own life instead have to go through punishments maybe he stucks himself he Jer on his store to kill himself but Paul screamed out and said do yourself no harm for we are all here look how close that was Bly the man almost kill himself and he going to be saved and his whole house that's hold it we have a God that answer prayer a God can heal a God can deliver a God can get you out of what you're in Paul screamed out and the man realized that there there must have be something taking place that made this man to know that they were Christian men or holy man because quickly he fell down at the feet imagine he heard them singing songs he heard them testifying he heard their conversation just think a minute folks if that Roman C was convinced and convicted because he heard them two men beaten prisoners and we are still free and we we are not beat or prisoners but hearing their testimony has such an influence that it cause men to say what shall I do to be saved he said we should be testifying you young people whatever it is you may not preach maybe God never called you to preach but you are housewife whatever you are teenager let's do something and live a life that makes the people say well that's a Christian going there that's a Christian Give the Lord Praises hallelujah praise God did you notice today most of the ministers keep telling people what not to do quit your smoking quit your lying quit your stealing quit this quit this quit this but he said that is not what the man asked what must I do not not do what I must do to be saved Oh Glory to God he wasn't telling them what not to do you know but what must I do to be saved and you know what our kids are Renegades and things like that we must stop that thinking our kids are Renegades I believe we must remember that the these kids are the best kids in the world because they are our children and we claim them for God I people talk about this one is toed and this one so and it curs the child and it say this and say say the other they're claiming nothing because they see a condition in front of them and it's easy for them to say these things than to apply Faith than to apply prayer than to apply praise it's easier to curse them and be negative about the childrenall wow hallu something I get into here your salvation will not save that child now Paul said and this is the beauty of the scriptures believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and die and th house shall be saved now what did he mean by that what does he mean by that here we go he didn't mean because they were saved and their house would be saved with it he meant this that because if he had enough Faith to be saved himself his same amount of faith that he had for himself would work for his children it's not believing in the Lord Jesus and you to be saved and you're doing nothing no no no no no it's not working so automatic I'm saved my children are saved because I'm saved that's not how it working is fine print I've got my children there's my little son Joseph and Billy Sarah Rebecca I want to see each one of them a worker of the Gospel doing something I want to see them saved and filled with the Holy Ghost now I've committed them to God and say I'm holding on to God for them I believe they're going to be saved every one of them I believe they're going to be saved I'll have them on the other side I don't believe my salvation will save them no but my faith in God will do it you see my faith believing God will do it will cause them to come to christall I wonder if we going to exercise that faith and you see the reality of faith in a in a positive way and I believe that that is where you people praying for your children here we go that's the reason your children has the manners and the real lady and gentleman in this wild age that we living in yet that part of them that's best I know of any kids see I think the reason for that is because your prayers for them you have committed them to God and holding on now you see the Romans said what must I do he just asked for himself he said what must I do and I am believing for my house and you are believing for your house by believing what we trust God God imputes our own faith like he did Abraham or job or any one of them for righteousness did you get that your faith is imputed or credited to account Hallelujah as righteousness Hallelujah not your fears not your feelings not your emotions your faith is what is credited to your account as righteousness Hallelujah I think it's a wonderful thing God imputes our faith like he did Abraham or job or any one of them for righteousness you see it's a Lotter to us for righteousness and that's how thou and thy household shall be saved I think it is a wonderful thing not only that but I'm holding on for every brother all my brothers my sister sister I'm not only holding for that I'm holding for every person that's in my church I'm holding for you all I want you to hold for me because of the righteousness of faith we don't have to make a burnt offering Christ is our offering but we have to have faith in that offering that Christ made oh give the Lord a shout tonight do you see it tonight you cannot fall back into the realm where you trying to make up for your sins and you try to make up for this and make up for that and you're going to be a better man because you're going to you're do better we not talking about that Christ entered the veil once and offer his own blood okay the Lord has shout he has perfected forever them that are Sanctified oh give the Lord some Praises tonight hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I think this word saying again Christ is our offering we but we have to have faith in that offering that Christ made and he made us this kind of Promise whatever you ask the father in my name I will do it come on church we can't sit on the fence anymore we can't sit on unbelief anymore we have to stand in faith walk in faith talk in faith pray in faith when th prayers believe you have received and that you and you shall have it in know words believe that got it and you w get it believe it's already done and you will have it you want to step out tonight I'm challenging you tonight oh glory to God hallelujah praise God the righteousness of faith faith credited as righteousness Faith inside your account tonight oh God hallelujah they going to rock the kingdom oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God all right now if I'm praying that God will save these teenage children and I believe with all my heart Hallelujah he will do it that's the same way job stood say oh look at this kid how he's doing I don't care what he is doing what she is doing I still have put that child in the hand of almighty God me and my house shall be saved hallu even though I may pass on before they do you hear that even though I a pass on before they do but somehow before they leave here God will twist them right down on the trail I believe that somehow or another he will make it so miserable for them he will make it so miserable for them till they will have to do it that's the way I believe I how shall be saved I've watched that come into my meetings many time old boy will come up here that's been rough all his life he fall on on his knees and go to crying and get up say well I had a old dear old mother she's in heaven tonight I know she's looking down she's glad to see me at the altar what is it that old mother prayed and believe and she's gone a long ago but hear them prayers because the righteousness hey glory to God she prayed in faith the faith count as righteousness and God is honoring the Faith by bringing the son or the grandson right at the altar you and your house shall be saved oh give the Lord some Praises don't give up them don't give upon God don't give on yourself give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah may this encourage your faith tonight strengthen you tonight old mother she gone long ago hear them prayers because the righteousness you see th and how shall be saved God knows how to work he knows how to do it knows how to do everything just right I said the other day when we are born of the spirit of God God isn't weak in one place and strong in another if you got a little shadow of God in you just a little speck of God then you got all power you got enough power in you to make a world and go out and live in it but of course that power is controlled by faith had no weak part of God and strong part of God you get a shadow of God is still God oh give the Lord's Praise In The House Hallelujah they get a Sprinkle of God is still God oh glory to God is God brought you so far Oh Glory to God is God brought you out hallelujah it's God that called you when you when you give your heart to Jesus Christ it wasn't a man that called you you don't belong to a man you don't belong to a church you belong to God oh give the Lord some Praises tonight Hallelujah there we go but of course that power is controlled by faith if it wasn't we all have a world out there and live in it and if you're a Son of God or a daughter of God you've got the power of God in you that law holds that Faith to a certain thing here we go let's go deeper now let's take for instance all of us we once lied Hallelujah we steal we curse swear do everything that's wrong and one day when we accepted Christ what did he do he opened up as soon as we accepted him that's a faith amen We Believe amen what and watch we we receive enough Faith immediately till we walk away no more lying no more stealing no more cheating why we rode right up above that sin because we used to ride in dear we was alloted that much Faith why because we believe that we are saved so you was a sinner a smoker and somebody say you give it heart to Jesus you give it to Jes all of a sudden you start to walk like I'm saved I'm saved and that raise you up is that you do something you know do something is God did something amen give you a word Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah God did what God give you a word hallelujah praise God praise God praise God hallelujah hallelujah let me get this wonderful Romans 10:9 said if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus It Was Written in scripture if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in thine heart that God has raisen him from the dead Thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation if you believe praise God a man heart comes unto righteousness isn't that right and with the mouth confession is the made unto salvation oh give the Lord some Praises you love him tonight Hallelujah we still in the word Glory have not left the word we telling the word tonight glory to God and who he found who he call who he call he Justified oh do you understand now how we could be justified because Faith steep forward as righteousness credit to your account and God see you as righteous because you're underneath of blood where the devil can't do you no harm Oh Glory to God you end up with a perfect standing under the blood of Jesus Christ when God look down to that blood he see you perfect oh give the Lord some Praises you have your ups and downs in on your house but through the blood he sees you perfect this is enough to shout tonight this is enough to dance tonight oh glory to God heyu Abraham believed God and his faith was counted as righteousness Oh Glory to God he staggered after the promise of God true unbelief but was strong in faith oh my I feel good tonight 1975 to now still pumping oh give the Lord a shout the Pumpers inside of me that's why I am pumping oh give the Lord I sh there is something inside that keep on pumping keep on pushing it's the fa oh my is the what oh glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God Galatians 220 said I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and give himself for me this is Paul speaking oh give the Lord a shouting out he claimed to be crucified with Christ but the life he's living I live by the feet of the Son of God hallelujah Galatians 3 said but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God it is evident for the just shall live by faith oh give the Lord a shout not not live by poke pooke how you going so so no not so so no so so in the Bible you want to say how so going Hallelujah no so so so so just that day no no no no not be you had to confess the promise oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah Ephesians 2:8 says for by grace are ye saved through faith and not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works least any man should boast Hallelujah Philippians 3:9 says and being found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which he is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith let me read it again Paul speaks and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith glory to God therefore being Justus ified by faith Romans 51 we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ being justified by faith you could rest Oh Glory to God you could rest you a Believer you are a son you're bound for the promised land oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah Hebrews 10 to the8 now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my sold have no pleasure in him oh blessed be the name of the Lord Let's see we could wrap up Hallelujah woo so we rode right there above that sin that we used to write in there we was a lotted that much Fai because what we believe when we are saved is that right we believe here that we are Sav so then we right up above that because we believe we are save now listen to this just before I get to the questions brother and sister I'm going to give you a little secret on myself I guess you often wondered how I see those visions and things and what makes it it's because when he met me that night and told me this would happen I believe it I suddenly believe it and I go in to pray for the sick if I could ever get a feeling that something fixing to happen they fixing to get well it's always about right and that's the way we must do with our family with anything we ask for we must pray and God resp respects Faith this is a real powerful quote here that the first time I've seen him say that to me God respects Faith you see to believe it you we must believe that it is right now with that little bit of God when you said yes Lord Jesus I'm a sinner I'm not worthy of your love but you did love me so I accept you as my savior immediately you walk right out of there what is it you stop your Lon you stop your cheating you stop your stealing why because you're confessing Lord Jesus I'm not I'm a sinner I'm not worthy of your love but you did love me I accept you as my savior and something happens that raises you up it's almost like you get a lift it's like Peter walking on the water he get a lift if that's if that's you B me come and the words say come he believe it he see it he start to walk on the water and and then he took his eyes off because the devil K come up a storm at the both sides if he keep his eyes focused on Jesus he walks straight to Jesus you but when he take his eyes off he start to sink his feate fell and his experience fell so I could see now how people could fall from fate and fall into that sinner condition or fall into that condition now because the Fate has not been maintained you stop you're lying you stop your cheating you stop you're stealing you stop doing things that you oughtn't to do why because you believe that you're a Christian because you believe you are a Christian you rise up from that to another level because of what you believe it Inspire youall friends Hallelujah a conversion outside of the same thing it won't last either when you go to church you say well I'm going to join the church I'm going to be baptized if that isn't Come From The Heart of Love To God it will never go nowhere but when you are converted to Christ a love to Christ then you accumulate a faith in Christ like you would to your wife or to your husband you accumulate a fate that you walk in that fate I don't know you just something about you just something that anchors you there that's the same which is about Christ that Christ says and you believe it you just stay right with it that's the way it just raises you right up above it God brings it to pass and fulfills his promise if you believe in the Lord Jesus you and your house shall be saved if you can believe in the Lord Jesus not only for salvation for yourself but for your loved ones for the healing of the child or for a mother or for anything that you desire here we go now if you know if you desire something that wasn't right you wouldn't have faith enough to ask God in the first place so you know already you know not right you're trying something but that can't work if you are sincere and know that it is right then you can ask God with a clean heart knowing it is no selfish motive and your objective and your motive is exactly right then ask God like a child believing you get it and you get it I know that but if it would be the right thing to do come sit down okay so he's talking about if you want money from somebody you can't just come up to you $1,000 you $1,000 like like a piper you're like a then people in the streets stop in here trying to get money that's not the approach he said you had to go and talk to the person and you know like become friends and whatnot and say you know I want to know I really not you know sticky with it here and talk to them so he's making that reference he said what you express our feelings to each other you are my friend that's the reason I come to you no that's the same way it is by Christ say you are my Lord I am sick the doctor say he can't do nothing for me but I know you can because you are my Lord oh give the Lord some Praises tonight do you understand just speak it over with him until you feel that you receive it that's your faith so you are speaking until that feeling of faith and the this beautiful quote say when Abraham came to the fullness of believing it's almost like if Abraham belief got capped and it Burt into the reality of our faith believing create the substance of Faith or or believe and give the birth of Faith that's where you're going to get that burst from amen so just speak it over to him until you feel that you receive it that's your faith faith is the substance of things open forth and when when I feel that way brother say when I feel that way is just as good as I got it I can go ahead because I got it he done promise me I got it I just keep holding on waiting finally first thing you know here it comes pouring down the cors of Heaven you see die and th house shall be saved so it is by faith we do everything believe on the Lord believe on the Lord for for a job here we go are you ready believe on the Lord for a job believe on the Lord to hunt to give you out the wife that you should have believe in the Lord to give you the husband you should marry believe on the Lord to send you some new furniture or if the barrel goes empty and the cruise get dry there's no food and the children are hungry believe on the Lord believe on the Lord for everything give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord glory to God glory to God glory to God glory to God he said the Roman there say believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shal be saved that's the question of being saved job and all of them pull it over here in the road and then drive it down that's what it is Faith you see job used faith in Romans they use Fai isn't that right we are ready to use Fai it's faith in everything or this the part I want to go we almost Clos he said when you got to use faith in God to make it work so you got your own Resurrection inside of you your Resurrection lays inside of you in your spirit you know when Jesus died on the cross his soul descended into hell preach of soul that were in prison that repented not his body went into the grave but before he died he committed his Spirit into the hands of God into thy hands I commend my spirit his Spirit went to God his soul went to hell his body went to the grave and that spirit that was in him was the spirit of God and that spirit in sunry times and diverse manners anointed the prophets to bring the message of the people when we receive Christ into our hearts there's all that we have that need of there's eternal life now Christ could not come back until three days was fulfilled because his Spirit was behind a screen like a bar like this that he could not cross that bar because it was a spoken word of God that says he had to lay in the grave for three days and three nights he could not come back until that three days and night was up oh praise the name of the Lord and each one of you have the power the same way because you are Sons and Daughters of God and the Very Spirit that's in you this morning the Holy Spirit that's in you this morning that same holy spirit will raise you up so you have power to raise yourself back up and the soul is that part of you who knows and understand your intelligence you have the power in you now to do that but that power that you have in you now could make a new world God doesn't have little spots and heavy spots and Powerful the least little touch of God is omnipotent I'm trying to get you into Faith now oh Glory you know that something has happened to you as a Christian do you know you used to ride the muck all the muck and the sin and the drink and gambling well as soon as you believe that Christ forgive your sins you raise up above this stuff oh and I telling you your here t i could raise you above the stuff you in the stuff you're doing the stuff you has done God can raise you up tonight now you're riding up here all of you then you have to have faith in the Holy Spirit here we go to give you power to ride above that kind of life of sin Oh Glory to God it's not stop doing this stop doing this you have to have faith in the Holy Spirit to give you power so rise above sin Oh Glory to God if you are sick and you're not a Christian become a Christian right now so that healing power will come into you by becoming a Christian that will give you Faith right above its sin it will give you faith and everything that you have need of in this journey is right in you now and the only thing you have to do is have faith in God and it pushes that good things out of you oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah job had one thing to do to be righteous it was to offer a burnt offering you have one thing to do to be righteous that's to have faith in God oh give the Lord a shout in the house for by faith are you saved by faith are you healed by faith you get everything that you have oh blessed be the name of the Lord so it is faith that controls it and faith is given to us just as we have need of God lot some of us some Faith some another faith it isn't some great Supernatural power that you have when you become a Christian you already have the power but you lack the faith in uper operating the power oh give the Lord a shout in the house that's what he said the power is here what's lacking is the faith to move that power the faith to operate that power oh give the Lord some Praises James Justified Abraham by works Paul Justified Abraham by faith M come please what do we have there between the two abrah was speaking on what Paul was speaking on what God saw in Abraham God Jam was speaking on what people saw in Abraham therefore God know that before the baby come that Abra had Fai oh my Hallelujah and Abraham proved it to God by acting like the baby was going to come when he was thile he had no children his wife whom was dead he was thile and yet he know somewhere was a baby you see he kept drinking the promise leaning on God's Great ill Shai the breast is the breasted one leaning there drinking knowing that God would give it to him knowing that it was a promise and he had to do it and we are children of Abraham let's lean onto his promise hold there knowing that God will do it that my friends conclude the righteousness of faith
