[6:11] Oh, without it

[9:02] upon you.
[9:08] And only
[9:14] [Music]
[9:21] believe
[9:25] all
[9:27] things are possible.
[9:33] Holy
[9:36] believe.
[9:37] [Music]
[9:40] Oh,
[9:42] [Music]
[9:49] all
[10:00] things are possible.
[10:03] [Music]
[10:05] Oh,
[10:07] baby.
[10:11] Jesus is here. Oh Jesus
[10:17] is here.
[10:21] Oh Jesus
[10:24] is here
[10:29] and all
[10:31] things are possible
[10:35] [Music]
[10:36] when Jesus
[10:40] is here.
[10:44] Oh Jesus
[10:48] is here.
[10:52] Jesus
[10:55] is here
[10:59] and all
[11:02] things
[11:03] are possible.
[11:07] Oh Jesus
[11:11] is here.
[11:15] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Thank
[11:16] you brother Anthony. Only believe. Only
[11:19] believe. All things are possible. Let's
[11:21] bow our heads for pray. Heavenly Father,
[11:24] we thank you that you are alive and you
[11:28] are present working amongst your people.
[11:31] Father, may you take me out of the way
[11:33] tonight and the words that'll be shared,
[11:35] the things that will be spoken may come
[11:37] from you. Lord, may you take the
[11:39] scriptures, take the quotes, whatever is
[11:41] that prepared and Lord, you pull it
[11:43] together and speak to your people's
[11:45] heart. Lord, through your servant and
[11:47] prophet William Brham, you said that
[11:49] people can't get desperate until God
[11:51] speaks to them. We need to hear from
[11:54] you. Revive our hearts, Lord. Revive our
[11:57] spirits. An important word was given on
[12:00] Wednesday night. Lord, the people, Lord,
[12:03] they just they they're not revived in
[12:06] that atmosphere to see great things.
[12:08] They're still Christians, but they don't
[12:10] have that revived spirit. Lord, may that
[12:13] revive spirit begin tonight. May sat
[12:15] among us, may grow from brother to
[12:16] brother, sister and sister. Every home
[12:18] may visit them. The pillar of fire went
[12:21] in that little room. You told the
[12:22] prophet, I'll meet you in dear. That
[12:24] will be the third problem. Father God,
[12:26] may you come and meet your people right
[12:28] in their homes, right where they are. In
[12:31] Jesus I ask it. Amen. And amen. God
[12:33] bless you and welcome
[12:36] in going forward and notice we're going
[12:38] to be zoom service. Give us the option
[12:40] to do as the Lord. We feel led to do. It
[12:44] may not specifically be a prayer meeting
[12:45] as such. There are some things that go
[12:48] upon our hearts. we just share with you
[12:50] and try to bless and edify you or we get
[12:52] somebody from outside to share something
[12:53] to you because the purpose is um to get
[12:58] you strengthening the inner man. You
[13:00] know the devil pumping hard and heavy
[13:02] through advertisement, through radio,
[13:04] television, everything possible, he's
[13:07] advertising his stuff out there and the
[13:10] little time we spend and there's a
[13:12] little time whether is midweek service
[13:14] or Sunday service in the big scheme of
[13:16] things in all the hours we have at our
[13:18] disposal we spend a little time and we
[13:21] need to get more time away with God. So
[13:24] tonight I do have something I'd like to
[13:25] share with you. And if you have your
[13:27] Bibles, I'd like you to turn with me to
[13:30] Jeremiah 4 1:3
[13:33] and Hosea 10
[13:37] 1 verse verse 12.
[13:41] Jeremiah 4 says, "For thus sayeth the
[13:43] Lord to the men of Judah and Jerusalem,
[13:47] break up your fellow ground and sew not
[13:50] among thorns."
[13:53] Hosea 10:12 says, "Sow to yourself in
[13:57] righteousness,
[13:59] reap in mercy,
[14:01] break up your fellow ground, for it is
[14:04] time to seek the Lord till he come and
[14:08] reign righteousness upon you." So
[14:12] tonight, I have a thought to share with
[14:13] you. Break up your fellow ground for it
[14:16] is time to seek the Lord. You know, we
[14:21] could
[14:24] bar speak about things going normal and
[14:27] then one day just something turn,
[14:29] something changes and things begin to
[14:31] happen.
[14:33] And for the bride, it's just upon us. We
[14:37] see what is happening outside. We see
[14:39] the conglomeration of wars, rumors of
[14:43] wars. We see that countries can't hold
[14:45] their people no more. People are
[14:47] breaking out. countries are breaking
[14:49] out. It's a different turn alto
[14:52] together. And of times you hear me talk
[14:56] about laziness and sloppiness and
[14:58] sluffiness. It just goes with the
[15:00] territory of having been there a long
[15:03] time.
[15:05] A long time. And this message I remember
[15:07] in the early years when it was fresh
[15:11] green, you couldn't go in a bus without
[15:13] somebody talking about this message.
[15:15] When that bus door was closed, they will
[15:18] stand up and preach until they reach
[15:21] your destination. It was young. It was
[15:24] real. It was it was something else. It
[15:27] had no um like how we have the the the
[15:30] the
[15:32] on tablets, it's on it's on your phone,
[15:35] you know, you know, all all these apps
[15:37] and so on like that. This the table app.
[15:39] It wasn't like that. It was whatever
[15:41] book you got, you absorb it. You're
[15:43] soaking it. You couldn't wait for the
[15:44] next one. It was now being released. It
[15:47] was fresh. People had the zeal and
[15:50] enthusiasm. And the prophet spoke about
[15:52] it on Wednesday night where things have
[15:54] cooled down where people take things for
[15:57] granted and it's risky to be there
[16:00] because it affects your mode of
[16:03] expectation. It affects your mode of
[16:05] preparation. And it affects you because
[16:08] Jesus first parable was the seed and the
[16:10] swer. And when Jesus described it, some
[16:13] fell on the wayside, some fell among
[16:16] rocks, some fell among thorns, and some
[16:19] fell among on good ground.
[16:23] The wayside and rocks, we kind of
[16:26] understand that clearly. But the thorns
[16:29] spot,
[16:30] the thorns spot is tough because that is
[16:33] where vines and stuff grow. That is
[16:37] where you don't get production. You
[16:40] don't get the produce that you expect.
[16:43] The Bible exhaust exhorts us. Don't sew
[16:47] among horns. You're wasting your time.
[16:51] Your fruit, you wouldn't get the fruit
[16:53] you expect. Where you want to sew is
[16:55] good ground. And where God want to show
[16:58] is good ground. Where God how want God
[17:01] want you to become is good ground. And
[17:03] the only way we could be good ground
[17:05] unto God is if our hearts get prepared.
[17:10] Now the follow ground is ground that is
[17:15] not cultivated or say uncultivated areas
[17:19] of your heart. He wants that broken up.
[17:23] Follow ground is referred to ground that
[17:25] has been left unplowed or uncultivated.
[17:29] You know when farmers want to do some
[17:31] good planting, they get a a tractor and
[17:33] the tractor is plow the place and put it
[17:35] in beds and so on and then the the the
[17:38] the ground is loosed that you could put
[17:40] cassava or you could put sweet potato or
[17:42] you could plant corn or you could plant
[17:45] pineapple or whatever you want to plant
[17:46] but the soil is tilled enough that you
[17:50] could put seed in it. So I you wouldn't
[17:53] let the land be idle or neglectful. And
[17:56] that
[17:58] unfollowed ground or followed ground
[18:01] that that ground that is not cultivated
[18:03] represents that heart that has become
[18:05] hard and unfruitful and resistance to
[18:09] God's word. That that is why you know
[18:12] you have to be careful that your heart
[18:15] don't get hard and the word not piercing
[18:18] you and the spirit not convicting you
[18:20] anymore. So therefore, you have to begin
[18:22] to examine your own life and identify
[18:25] the areas in your own life that have
[18:27] grown cold and careless and invite God,
[18:33] invite him to soften your heart, to root
[18:36] out all sin that you could grow
[18:38] properly. Because the issue with the
[18:40] thorns and the cares of this life and
[18:43] the burden of this world, it chokes the
[18:46] tree. And when the tree is under that
[18:49] kind of pressure, it cannot produce the
[18:51] fruit that God wants. So break up that
[18:55] implies repentance.
[18:58] Turning from sin and hardness of heart.
[19:00] I've seen it. People's heart have become
[19:03] hard. The word not getting through. The
[19:06] spirit not getting through. And after
[19:08] you repent, you prepare your heart
[19:12] because your heart have been prepared to
[19:14] for the word of God. We know the
[19:16] scriptures. Scriptures talk about a new
[19:18] heart I'll give you because our heart
[19:20] was hard and the new heart is a heart
[19:22] towards God. We just we not right yet
[19:25] just a heart towards God. That's the
[19:27] first part. The second part he said give
[19:29] you a new spirit and brother Brandon
[19:31] taught us that that new spirit is to
[19:33] agree with the Holy Ghost because we
[19:36] kind of you neighbor the blood can't
[19:38] take this one. You don't like this one.
[19:39] You're upset all kind of crazy stuff. So
[19:42] that's your own human spirit. So God
[19:44] gives a sanctified spirit, a new spirit
[19:46] and then in there is where he places the
[19:49] Holy Spirit. So what repentance,
[19:52] preparation,
[19:54] and then surrender. That's the three
[19:56] things I have here. Now in 2 Chronicles
[19:58] 12 13-14,
[20:01] hear these words. So King Rahoban, Rahob
[20:06] Boam strengthened himself in Jerusalem
[20:09] and reigned. For Rhuban was 1 and 40
[20:13] years old when he began to reign, 41
[20:15] years old. And he reigned 70 years in
[20:18] Jerusalem, the city which the Lord had
[20:20] chosen out of all the tribe of Israel to
[20:22] put his name there. And his mother's
[20:25] name was Nama and Ammonite.
[20:28] Verse 14. And he did evil. Here we go.
[20:34] because
[20:35] he prepared not his heart to seek the
[20:39] Lord. I want to read it again. This do
[20:42] this king, he did evil because
[20:47] he prepared not his heart to seek the
[20:51] Lord. Now God is not like your friend,
[20:54] like your neighbor or cousin or aunt or
[20:56] uncle. That is not how you want to place
[20:59] him. Right? The scripture say God is a
[21:01] spirit.
[21:03] A spirit is not flesh and blood. God is
[21:06] a spirit. We could feel one another like
[21:09] who you like. Jesus busted his own
[21:11] disciples for that. He said the scribe
[21:12] and Pharisees do that too. They like
[21:14] their own people. They like their kind.
[21:16] They're among the self and so on. He
[21:18] said you are to do better than that. God
[21:20] want more than that. So this king did
[21:22] evil because he didn't prepare his heart
[21:25] to seek the Lord. Now if it's time to
[21:26] seek the Lord, what you going to do
[21:28] that? How would you approach that? I'm
[21:31] in the message. I believe the message
[21:32] that is not it at all. You have to come
[21:35] to the place where at the last part you
[21:37] will yield to God's will and stop
[21:39] resisting his will by not doing what you
[21:42] know you're supposed to do but as
[21:43] iniquity brother now church we are
[21:47] teaching now but remember
[21:50] when you leave here
[21:53] start moving out of the shock now you
[21:57] are going into grain
[21:59] but lay in the presence of the sun don't
[22:03] add to what I have said. Don't take away
[22:06] from what I have said because I speak
[22:10] the truth as far as I know it as the
[22:14] father has given me. See, don't act to
[22:17] it. Just say what I said.
[22:22] The thing of it is just tell the people
[22:26] to come seek the Lord Jesus and then you
[22:30] yourself lay right in his presence and
[22:34] just make love to him. Say, "Oh Lord
[22:36] Jesus, son of God, I love you. Tender my
[22:41] heart, Lord. Take away the filth and the
[22:45] love of the world and let me live holy
[22:49] in this present world before you. Before
[22:52] you. Could we say amen? He's showing the
[22:56] approach that we must have in expressing
[23:00] our love for God, in expressing our
[23:03] worship to God and say, "Lord, take away
[23:06] the filth. take away the love of the
[23:08] world. In other words, break up my
[23:12] fellow ground. Break up the uncultivated
[23:15] area in my heart in my life. I want to
[23:18] receive seed because seed in good ground
[23:22] will produce after its kind. The issue
[23:25] here is not the rain because that is
[23:27] coming. The issue here is the condition
[23:30] of the heart and the seed that is in
[23:33] that heart. Because every seed will get
[23:36] the rain to produce what's inside that
[23:38] seed. Whether it's world comes to the
[23:40] churches, whether it's actually sinking,
[23:42] whether it's the vials, the plagues, the
[23:44] wings are seed because all things the
[23:47] word that came out of the mouth of God.
[23:49] But rain has to fall upon seed. Let's
[23:52] continue. Praise the Lord. Ezra 6 20 and
[23:58] 21. Hear these words. For the priests
[24:01] and the Levites were purified together.
[24:05] All of them were pure
[24:07] and killed the Passover,
[24:10] for all the children of the captivity,
[24:13] and for their brethren the priest, and
[24:15] for themselves. Here's one I want to get
[24:18] to. Verse 21. And the children of
[24:21] Israel,
[24:22] which were come again out of captivity,
[24:25] and all such as had, here we go.
[24:29] separated themselves
[24:31] unto them from the filthiness of the
[24:35] heathen of the land to seek the Lord God
[24:39] of Israel did eat. So this was a
[24:42] classification.
[24:44] These were the people that separated
[24:47] themselves from the heathen of the land.
[24:50] So God don't just want us just be like
[24:53] everybody else mixing with everything
[24:56] and and just go with the flow outside
[24:58] there.
[25:00] We have to be you have to be I have to
[25:04] be we have to be a separated people unto
[25:07] God.
[25:09] It starts with a choice
[25:12] and a decision. It starts with as I
[25:15] asked some time before who are you? who
[25:18] you are and what you see God want you to
[25:22] be. So when you begin to look at it from
[25:25] that perspective, you actually jump out
[25:28] of religion. You jump out of church
[25:30] atmospheres and you're getting a picture
[25:33] now of what God's mind is for his people
[25:36] and what God mind is for you. Because
[25:39] that is what you want, the mind of God
[25:42] for your life. There's no questions. You
[25:46] just want to pack out and do what God is
[25:49] building you to do. Because once you are
[25:51] a son or daughter and you are his child,
[25:54] there will be things that God will speak
[25:56] to you that there will be things that
[25:58] God will move you. I didn't even know
[26:01] I'd be sharing this this evening. I came
[26:04] home and just something like that come
[26:07] to me. Break up the found. That's how it
[26:09] stopped. I wasn't thinking about it. It
[26:13] just come break up the follow ground. I
[26:15] had to go and find the scripture. Know
[26:16] the scripture and then I see it. For it
[26:19] is time to seek the Lord. Not seek the
[26:23] Lord without context, but seek the Lord
[26:27] till he send down the rain of
[26:30] righteousness upon you. What a time to
[26:33] get this scripture. What a time to look
[26:35] into this word. This is not you taking
[26:38] things for granted and have this what
[26:41] you call entitlement spirit that is upon
[26:43] the message world today but they feel
[26:45] because they so long God is obligated to
[26:49] them and the unbelief or obligated to
[26:51] them and the gray hair and the old God
[26:53] have nothing to do with
[26:55] God have to do with faith that's why
[26:58] they ask the question when the son of
[27:00] man cometh shall he find faith on the
[27:02] earth that is the question he said Peter
[27:05] the devil want to You feel like wheat
[27:08] but I've prayed for you not to come out
[27:10] of the world but that your faith fail
[27:12] now if your faith drop if your faith
[27:15] fail if your faith fall that's it you
[27:17] get wipe out the strength our strength
[27:21] is faith and faith is a reality faith is
[27:24] not imagination faith is the actual
[27:26] substance you have it or you don't have
[27:29] it but you have it that's why you're
[27:31] here tonight is by faith you choose to
[27:34] come into this room tonight you could
[27:35] have done something else. But you choose
[27:37] that. Now, don't let your faith drop,
[27:40] but believe the words coming to you is
[27:43] God himself speaking to you. If it's the
[27:45] brother to you, you're in trouble. If
[27:47] it's the flesh and blood, you're in
[27:48] trouble. You have to ask yourself, what
[27:51] is God speaking to me tonight? And he
[27:54] says by his word, break up the follow
[27:57] ground. Why? It is time to seek the
[28:00] Lord. It doesn't make no sense. You're
[28:02] seeking the Lord and you're asking God
[28:04] for this and that and for that and your
[28:06] ground hard as a rock.
[28:09] If rain fall the the water disappear.
[28:13] You know sometime in China when rainfall
[28:14] and hit the ground so when you look so
[28:16] it disappearing the ground is hot the
[28:19] ground is dry. Rain fall and the ground
[28:22] just absorb all the rain. We want rain
[28:26] of righteousness. We want dynamics to
[28:28] fall in such a way that that David say
[28:31] my cup run over. We want rain to fall so
[28:33] much that the churches will get flooded
[28:36] out and the ducks and the sheep will
[28:38] have fellowship because all the
[28:39] ministers bring us in a wall and make it
[28:41] like fish pond like protected garrison
[28:45] and so on. But the promise rain to fall
[28:47] and it will fall and fall so much and so
[28:50] long and so high that the ducks will
[28:52] have fellowship because you are not
[28:54] belonging to a man. You are God's
[28:55] people. That's why he sent ministry to
[28:58] serve you, to bless you, to minister to
[29:02] you, to strengthen you, to edify you, to
[29:05] build you up. That is why he's in
[29:07] ministry. Praise the Lord. Amen. Do you
[29:10] believe that tonight? Oh, praise God.
[29:12] Let's continue.
[29:15] Isaiah 31:1
[29:18] to them that go down to Egypt for help
[29:24] and slay stay on horses. You're getting
[29:27] your anointing. You're getting the
[29:29] inspiration from my worldly backing
[29:31] friends from Egyptians on your job from
[29:34] Egyptian in your family, your Egyptian
[29:37] partners and and brethren. war to them
[29:40] and go down to Egypt for help and stay
[29:43] on horses and trust in chariots because
[29:46] they are many and in horsemen because
[29:49] they are very strong but they look not
[29:51] unto the holy one of Israel neither seek
[29:55] the Lord see a brother string you know
[29:58] money and whatn not bless you with money
[30:00] how did you change
[30:03] get arrogant
[30:05] get overconfident
[30:07] and to save him, go at him, break him.
[30:11] And sometime people don't even look to
[30:12] say, well, why is it I'm in this
[30:14] condition? Why is it I'm in this place?
[30:18] What needs to be corrected?
[30:20] They keep going on their own way, not
[30:22] even seeking advice or seeking counsel
[30:25] or seeking the Lord for an answer or a
[30:28] leading. They still using their gray
[30:31] matter. They're still using their 16
[30:33] element. They're still going in the
[30:34] humanistic realm, the human strength.
[30:37] That is a recipe for failure.
[30:40] Guaranteed.
[30:42] A recipe for for crash. Guaranteed. God
[30:46] said don't go for Egypt. Don't rest upon
[30:49] your horses. Don't depend upon you have
[30:51] a bank account or you have a job or you
[30:53] have this because that could be taken
[30:54] from you.
[30:57] Your health could be taken from you.
[31:00] We have to seek the Lord. We have to
[31:02] understand who is in charge and who we
[31:05] belong to.
[31:07] God put man to be resolute, to be
[31:10] independent, to have dominion, to have
[31:13] power. That's what man's supposed to be.
[31:16] Fallen man could be still resolute, have
[31:19] dominion and power. Why you think these
[31:21] rich guys and these multi-billionaires
[31:23] and millionaires, they'll be so arrogant
[31:25] because they feel they are like gods.
[31:28] They don't have to ask nobody where to
[31:30] go, when to go, what plane to take. They
[31:32] have their own private jet. They have
[31:33] everything at their command.
[31:35] They know some of them have money more
[31:37] than the economies of countries.
[31:40] They are on top of the world as far as
[31:41] they're concerned. They don't care.
[31:46] And God don't want us like that.
[31:48] And he cares to pull us out. We have to
[31:52] care about his burden for the church and
[31:55] his burden for the breakthrough. Just
[31:57] think about it now. God want to get the
[31:59] seed in you that he could pour out the
[32:01] rain and what could be transformed into
[32:04] the kingdom of God in your spirit and
[32:05] heart. He wants to do that. But when he
[32:08] looks down in your heart, he see rock.
[32:12] He see hard ground. He see hatred,
[32:15] malice, jealousy, harsh issues,
[32:19] troubling spirits, all kind of isitues.
[32:21] He's seeing that in you. And yet you
[32:24] want his help. You want his assistance.
[32:27] You want his breakthrough. You want his
[32:29] healing. You want his deliverance. And
[32:31] he's watching that ground of your heart.
[32:34] And he is telling you, you have to break
[32:36] it up.
[32:38] You have to want to break it up.
[32:41] You have to want to become mellow
[32:44] instead of hostile.
[32:47] You have to want to come sensitive to
[32:50] the spirit because that dove certainly
[32:53] ain't no partner with no wolf. Once that
[32:57] wolf nature, once that behavior is is
[33:00] manifested, the dove take its flight,
[33:03] the dove is attracted to the lamb, the
[33:06] lamb surrenders its rights. The lamb
[33:09] cannot lead itself. The lamb has to be
[33:12] led. The lamb don't have horns. The lamb
[33:15] don't boot. The lamb don't kick like a
[33:17] horse. It doesn't roar like a lion. It's
[33:20] a certain type of animal. And God
[33:23] represented himself as lamb and dove.
[33:26] Now God know our nature. Not everybody
[33:29] quiety, not everybody loudy. It have
[33:31] people who quietly resistance.
[33:34] They quiet but brother they're like
[33:37] steel on the inside it. It's just that
[33:39] they have
[33:41] you're not seeing the metal frame.
[33:44] You you you understand me? It have some
[33:46] some people they're very very quiet but
[33:49] they're cruel on the inside.
[33:51] So you can't just look at that. And some
[33:53] people they like mouth champions. Lot of
[33:55] flare, lot of noise. Lot of old noise
[33:58] and no bite at all in no bite at all.
[34:03] That's just front. So it have all types.
[34:06] And we not here to do psychology or
[34:08] psychiatry. We not into that. I am not a
[34:10] psychologist or psychiatric. But I'm
[34:12] here to tell you that when you look at
[34:14] your heart tonight, you know the areas
[34:17] that need assistance. You know the areas
[34:19] that need tending. You know the areas
[34:20] that need the breaking up that God could
[34:22] drop down the side of them. We who are
[34:24] fathers or brothers or so like that like
[34:27] especially like we who are fathers
[34:28] nobody train us to be a father. Nobody
[34:31] has train nobody to be a mother or to be
[34:32] a wife or to be a husband. That is how
[34:35] life is. You have to learn and you have
[34:37] to want to learn. That's why you can be
[34:38] a better husband because there's no
[34:40] school saying how best is best. How good
[34:43] is good. You could be a better father.
[34:45] There's no school that teaching you how
[34:47] what level of fatherhood and whatn not.
[34:48] Our example is God. What father he
[34:51] demonstrated, what life he demonstrated.
[34:54] And he said, "Husband, love your wife."
[34:56] How? As I always say, not as your mother
[34:58] love your father, but as Christ loved
[34:59] the church. He put it that inside of
[35:01] you. So we could look how Christ loved
[35:03] the church and say, you know what, this
[35:04] is how it's supposed to work. Wives
[35:06] respect your husband, not cuss your
[35:08] husband, not be angry with your husband,
[35:09] not not bring down your husband, not
[35:11] belittle your husband, not make him feel
[35:13] small because you have two piece of
[35:14] subject or you have something more than
[35:16] him or a bigger salary or something. Not
[35:17] that. and you're belittling him and
[35:19] smallifying him. That's not a word. But
[35:21] you know who I'm talking about. That's
[35:23] not the Bible. So as a sister, you have
[35:26] to connect with the Bible spirit of what
[35:27] you supposed to be. As a brother, you
[35:30] supposed to c with the Bible spirit of
[35:32] what you supposed to be. Not put
[35:34] everything on the wife, not everything
[35:35] on the woman. Next minute, she wearing
[35:38] long dress, but she almost wearing the
[35:40] pants because you authorize her to wear
[35:41] the pants. Not literally, but in terms
[35:44] of what she has to do. Why? Because you
[35:47] as a man are lazy and you're not making
[35:49] a decision. You're not leading at all.
[35:52] You wish somebody else could lead. God
[35:55] didn't make that. God made Adam to
[35:57] ruling. God made man to be led to to to
[36:02] leading and to have the confidence to
[36:04] lead. It's an embarrassment right now to
[36:07] see men that are so short in confidence,
[36:10] short in positivity, short in faith, and
[36:14] women's aggressive and they more
[36:16] positive and and everything is a shame.
[36:18] Something really wrong. This society is
[36:21] perverted. We can't have that in the
[36:24] church.
[36:26] We want men to take up their place. Men
[36:28] to take up their role. Men to be the
[36:31] kind of example
[36:34] and women to get in their place because
[36:36] some of them totally out of place.
[36:37] Totally out of order. I I I didn't come
[36:39] here and say all that tonight, but it
[36:41] come out of the mouth.
[36:45] So if God want to bless you, it come
[36:48] like this. God want to bless you. But
[36:51] you can't get wet with God's blessing
[36:53] because you hold up an umbrella. the
[36:55] umbrella of your unbelief and instead of
[36:57] the rain of God hit you instead of
[36:59] righteousness hit you. It bouncing off
[37:01] the umbrella and fallen on the ground,
[37:05] your blessing then is then delayed but
[37:08] can't be denied because you are son or
[37:10] daughter of God. Now if revelation
[37:13] strike you close the unbelief, close up
[37:16] the hatred, close up the malice umbrella
[37:19] that you have decorating so nice over
[37:20] your head, your arrogance. If you close
[37:24] that and let that rain of righteous hit
[37:26] you and you recognize the same blood for
[37:29] you is for your brother.
[37:32] The same blood for you is for your
[37:34] sister.
[37:35] So there's no need to hold the ought.
[37:37] There's no need to hold a grudge.
[37:39] There's no need whatsoever because you
[37:42] seen the same blood. The same blood that
[37:45] deliver you could deliver them too. And
[37:48] you're asking God for his mercy and his
[37:50] grace. Saints, we're coming on to the
[37:52] end, you know. Him that's filthy will be
[37:55] filthy still. Him that is righteous will
[37:57] be righteous still and he that is holy
[37:59] will be holy still. Let me see if I put
[38:01] this about this here.
[38:04] I trust tonight that this is helping you
[38:06] somewhere.
[38:07] All right.
[38:10] Do not sow among thorns.
[38:13] Is amazing how Jeremiah spoke that.
[38:17] Do not sow among until ground where you
[38:20] could have no fruit. So if the word is
[38:24] speaking this, God wouldn't waste time
[38:26] with hardened hearts and until grounds
[38:29] until you prepare to break it.
[38:32] Second Timothy 3 famil scripture, but
[38:34] I'm going to read it only in the
[38:35] amplified tonight. But understand this
[38:38] and in the last days will come perilous
[38:40] times of great stress and trouble, hard
[38:43] to deal with and hard to bear. for
[38:47] people. I want to start it here. The
[38:50] people he's talking about is church
[38:52] folks. This is not unbelievers. They're
[38:55] not sin man party man. This is people
[38:57] who are in church. For people, I'll say
[39:01] this way for church people will be
[39:03] lovers of self, utterly self,
[39:07] lovers of money. church people and
[39:10] aroused
[39:12] by inordinate,
[39:14] greedy desire for wealth.
[39:19] Church people will be proud and arrogant
[39:23] and contemptuous boasters.
[39:26] Church people, they will be abusive,
[39:30] blasphemerous, scoffing,
[39:32] disobedient to parents,
[39:35] ungrateful,
[39:37] unholy,
[39:38] profane.
[39:40] I can't go through all this tonight, but
[39:43] you see that word ungrateful.
[39:45] Regardless of what you give them, they
[39:46] can't even say thanks. They're grateful
[39:48] for nothing. You're doing your best is
[39:51] not good enough. You're trying your
[39:52] best. And they will want you to feel
[39:55] guilty that you haven't done done all
[39:59] and that is wrong. Is wickedness behind
[40:03] them. The Bible say how they're going to
[40:04] be ungrateful and we supposed to call it
[40:06] out. That is my child but he ungrateful.
[40:11] That is my daughter but she's wicked.
[40:17] It's quiet. I hear no amens on that. I
[40:19] can't hear you. So I said I'm not going
[40:22] to say amen or praise God I love but
[40:24] hear this they will be without natural
[40:28] human affection callous and inhuman
[40:32] relentless
[40:34] admitting of no truce and appeasement.
[40:37] That mean these are war mongers. There
[40:39] will be slanderers, false accusers,
[40:41] troublemakers, intemperate,
[40:44] loose in morals and conduct,
[40:47] uncontrolled
[40:49] and fierce, haters of good. They will be
[40:53] treacherous, betrayers, rash, and
[40:57] inflated with self-conceit. They will be
[40:59] lovers of sensual pleasures and vain
[41:02] amusement more than rather lovers of
[41:04] God. And although they hold a form of
[41:07] party or true religion, they deny and
[41:10] reject and are strangers to the power of
[41:12] it. Their conduct belies the genuous
[41:16] genuiness of their profession. Avoid
[41:19] such people and turn away from them. For
[41:23] among them are those who worm their way
[41:26] into homes, and captivate silly and
[41:29] weak-natured and spiritually dwarf
[41:31] women, loaded down with the burden of
[41:34] their sins, and easily swayed and led
[41:37] away by various evil desires and
[41:40] seductive impulses. These weak women
[41:44] would listen to anybody who will teach
[41:47] them. They are forever inquiring and
[41:50] getting information but are never able
[41:52] to arrive at a recognition and knowledge
[41:55] of the truth. Now as Janice and Jambis
[41:58] were hostile to and resisted Moses, so
[42:02] these men also are hostile to and oppose
[42:06] the truth. They have depraved and
[42:09] distorted minds and are reprobate and
[42:13] counterfeit and to be rejected as far as
[42:17] the fate is concerned. But they will not
[42:20] get very far for the rash folly will
[42:23] become obvious to everybody as was that
[42:25] of those magician mentioned.
[42:28] And here Paul switches. Now you have
[42:31] closely observed and diligently followed
[42:34] my teaching,
[42:36] conduct, purpose in life, faith,
[42:41] patience,
[42:44] love, steadfastness.
[42:47] So Paul switch after this and say you
[42:49] watch you have observed my teaching
[42:52] conduct purpose in life faith patience
[42:56] love and steadfastness. Brother Brian
[43:00] let me wrap up here.
[43:02] You can't bless what God has cursed.
[43:05] Neither can the devil curse what God has
[43:07] blessed. It's an individual affair. No
[43:10] matter how poor, how stupid, how
[43:13] unlearned, how uneducated, what God
[43:16] bless is blessed and what God cursed is
[43:20] cursed.
[43:22] Know to differentiate what is right and
[43:26] what is wrong.
[43:28] Micaiah knew good and well that it
[43:31] wasn't the Lord that was with those
[43:32] preachers. But what was the matter with
[43:35] those preachers? Notice what they did.
[43:37] They had been dressed the best. They had
[43:39] been fed the best. They had come
[43:41] together in their parties and so forth,
[43:43] their alliances. And all they only knew
[43:46] was their own theology. Watch this
[43:48] phrase. That's what they only knew.
[43:50] Their own theology. And the Bible said
[43:54] that Micaiah when he looked at the
[43:55] vision, God said, "Who can we get to go
[43:58] down and deceive Ahab?"
[44:01] and a lying spirit said, "I'll go down
[44:03] there and entice Ahab to those preachers
[44:06] because they have to go out there in
[44:08] order to bring the word of God to pass."
[44:10] Brother Brown,
[44:12] so today
[44:14] so many people are listening
[44:17] to enticing spirits instead of taking
[44:20] the word of God. Spirits, they are in
[44:23] the world. They are demons. They go into
[44:27] places. They get amongst men, ministers.
[44:32] They get amongst church members. They
[44:35] get amongst good people. And they cause
[44:38] them to come into
[44:42] an illusion. But parents, take a note of
[44:45] this one. An illusion. and they say
[44:48] things and do things and teach things
[44:53] and practice things that are contrary to
[44:57] the word of God.
[45:00] Many persons have receive have been
[45:02] deceived in receiving the Holy Ghost. As
[45:05] I said, they got doctrines today like
[45:07] Elijah garments, manifested sons and all
[45:10] these different isms. People fall
[45:12] blindly on there and go through some
[45:13] kind of sensation raised back up. So
[45:16] after they get their sensation, after
[45:18] they get the experiences, they raise
[45:20] back up with arrogant spirit,
[45:23] indifferent, fussy, highteered, that is
[45:27] not the spirit of God. So fussing,
[45:31] carrying on, highteered, that is not the
[45:33] spirit of God. And still continue right
[45:36] on out of order. Don't know what church
[45:38] order is. Don't know how to behave
[45:41] themselves in the house of God. No
[45:44] manners. Imagine that. But but Abraham
[45:47] is calling it out. No manners, no just
[45:50] no audacity at all, no feeling towards
[45:53] God. All you think about is church. It
[45:56] shows they have received a church spirit
[45:59] and not the spirit of God. I'm going to
[46:01] close.
[46:04] So this what it means to break up the
[46:07] file ground this until ground. For the
[46:10] land to be productive, it has to be
[46:12] plowed. It has to be prepared for
[46:15] planting.
[46:17] So therefore, if the seed is not going
[46:19] down because the ground is hard, it
[46:21] wouldn't really germinate and grow to
[46:24] maturity. So it's waste of time with
[46:26] that soil. It's a waste of time. A
[46:29] ground with hatred in it, bitterness in
[46:31] it, lust and greed and fear and pride
[46:33] and and all kind of your own pictures
[46:35] and ideas and what you think and what
[46:36] you feel and whatnot. This season here
[46:39] now is time to break up your fellow
[46:43] ground. Isaiah 55 said, "Seek ye the
[46:45] Lord while he may be found. Call ye upon
[46:48] him while he is near. Let the wicked
[46:51] forsake his way and the unrighteous man
[46:53] his thoughts. Let him return unto the
[46:55] Lord, and he will have mercy upon him
[46:58] and to our God. For he will abundantly
[47:00] pardon. For my thoughts are not your
[47:02] thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,
[47:04] sayeth the Lord. For as the heavens are
[47:06] higher than the earth, so my ways harder
[47:08] than your ways, and my thoughts than
[47:09] your thoughts. And then he said this,
[47:12] for as the rain cometh down, and the
[47:14] snow from heaven, and returneth not
[47:16] thither, but waterth the earth, and
[47:18] maketh it bring forth blood, and bring
[47:20] forth seed to the swer, and bread to the
[47:22] eater. So shall my word be that goeth
[47:25] forth out of my mouth. It shall not
[47:28] return unto me void, but it shall
[47:30] accomplish a purpose that I please, and
[47:32] it shall prosper and take things for
[47:33] sentence. So God said clearly that this
[47:37] ground
[47:39] this reference is just like his word.
[47:41] The same principle the word go forth and
[47:45] the spirit coming behind it. We cannot
[47:47] just expect just word word and no
[47:50] spirit. He says so shall my word be.
[47:54] What is he comparing it to? As the rain
[47:56] cometh down and water the earth that it
[48:00] maketh it to bring forth forth bud and
[48:02] give seed to the swer and bread to the
[48:04] eater so shall my word be. So this word
[48:08] from this prophet that came into your
[48:11] heart where he said the secret is the
[48:13] word is in the bride. That word has a
[48:16] spirit to come upon it. And that spirit
[48:18] coming upon that word means the spirit
[48:20] coming upon you. So don't let the devil
[48:22] lie to you. The spirit will come upon
[48:25] you. Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[48:28] I'll close with this. Is it the church
[48:30] better at the examining himself by the
[48:33] word of God? Our purity, our loyalty,
[48:36] our devotion. We have become tulas, tail
[48:38] bearers, cigarette smokers, backpiters,
[48:40] paint of Jezebels, every everything in
[48:42] the calendar that the rest of the world
[48:44] does. The Christian church is associated
[48:45] with those things today. This woman who
[48:47] lost a coin, she had to light a candle.
[48:50] She got a candle lit. Not only did she
[48:51] get a candle, she got a broom and she
[48:54] went to house cleaning. Oh brother, if
[48:57] there was ever a need of a time of a
[48:58] lighting of a candle, not for some
[49:00] emotional worker, not for jump for joy,
[49:02] but a hard certain experience where men
[49:05] and women get right with God. We are the
[49:08] end time. She lit a candle to give a
[49:11] light. And brother, every little candle
[49:12] here ought to be lit tonight. Not only
[49:14] that, she got a broom and the neighbors
[49:17] could see the dust flying. She had a
[49:20] real house cleaning time. I'll close
[49:22] with that. The neighbors could see it.
[49:25] When last have you had a house cleaning?
[49:28] I'm not talking about the physical
[49:29] house. I'm talking about your heart.
[49:33] When last have you examined what is
[49:35] going on on the inside,
[49:38] not just coming to church because when
[49:40] David was caught and the and the prophet
[49:43] give him a a little reference and so on,
[49:45] David said that man should die.
[49:47] David wasn't thinking about himself.
[49:50] He was thinking about that man.
[49:53] You get me? David wasn't conscious that
[49:57] what the prophet say was a reference to
[49:59] his behavior.
[50:01] And the prophet had to tell him, "David,
[50:02] that's you.
[50:04] That is you there." And many times we
[50:07] easy to see sins of others, see the
[50:09] faults of others, see the failures of
[50:11] others, see the outs of others, and we
[50:14] blind like a bat to see ourselves.
[50:17] That's why we need these things, the
[50:19] mirror of the word. Let's bow our heads.
[50:22] Heavenly Father, I just pray that these
[50:25] broken up words, Lord, that we share
[50:27] here this night would strike and
[50:30] resonate in the hearts of your children.
[50:32] That each person here would want to see
[50:35] that ground broken up. Because when that
[50:37] ground is broken up and prepared, it can
[50:39] receive seeds. Seed of revival, Lord,
[50:43] seed of revelation, seeds of of hope,
[50:45] seeds of expectation. And as BA Anthony
[50:48] sang, only believe all things are
[50:50] possible. Such a beautiful song, so
[50:52] timely. It to challenge our faith to
[50:55] believe you. Not to believe ourselves.
[50:57] We are failures, Lord. But to believe
[50:59] and trust you. Trust you that you would
[51:01] come and fulfill every promise you spoke
[51:03] to that prophet because we know it
[51:05] wasn't the prophet. is you are speaking
[51:08] through him to give us these precious
[51:11] promises and we strive year in year out
[51:14] to bring these promises. This year Lord
[51:17] is about five years since we've been
[51:18] doing Zoom meeting. Five years every
[51:21] Friday almost and you have kept us
[51:23] alive. You have kept us together. You
[51:26] have kept us in the faith and the people
[51:28] of courage tonight amidst their
[51:30] tiredness from the week of the job
[51:32] whatever at home they could still spend
[51:34] time here tonight to call upon your
[51:36] name. And as we get this little brief
[51:38] time of prayer, may you be with them.
[51:41] May anointing come down upon them. May
[51:43] they no look for some kind of
[51:44] performance. Nobody's listening in on
[51:46] their prayer. May they come in a depth
[51:48] of sincerity where they want their
[51:50] hearts right with you. The attitude
[51:52] towards wives, the attitude towards
[51:54] husbands, the attitude towards children,
[51:57] the attitude towards parents. May that
[51:59] be corrected tonight by your spirit. May
[52:01] children begin to cry. May the husband
[52:04] weep. May the wife weep as she begin to
[52:07] examine their own her own life and his
[52:10] own life. As we examine our lives that
[52:13] we have been falling short and we want
[52:15] her to be corrected tonight. We want her
[52:17] to be on target tonight. Oh God, won't
[52:19] you break our hearts up and make it
[52:21] mellow? You say that the church is now
[52:24] getting the message, but they need to
[52:26] lay in your presence until it b down,
[52:28] until it becomes soothing, until it
[52:30] becomes soft, until become so sensitive
[52:33] to the spirit. Oh God, break up our
[52:35] hearts tonight. Bring us to the
[52:37] sensitivity of your spirit that we would
[52:39] yield to your spirit and we will do what
[52:41] you want us to do, what you want us to
[52:43] do, not what we want to do, but you want
[52:45] us to do. Oh God, I commit the
[52:47] ministers. I commit the elders. I commit
[52:48] the deacons. I commit the trustees. I
[52:50] commit the entire into your hands. I
[52:52] commit all those who are here tonight in
[52:54] this little prayer meeting, in this
[52:55] little time and this service. Father, I
[52:57] commit them into your hands. I commit
[52:58] their children into your hands, their
[53:00] family into your hands that your spirit
[53:02] might write the trail and minister and
[53:04] meet their need. May they not take this
[53:05] word lightly. May they take it as thus
[53:08] sayeth the Lord. Break up your fellow
[53:10] ground for it is time to seek the Lord
[53:12] until he releases that reign of
[53:15] righteousness. Oh God, may they begin to
[53:17] pour tonight. Oh God, Elijah shut the
[53:20] heavens and there was no rain. But oh
[53:22] God, you promised these seven thunders.
[53:24] They going to unlock the heavens. Oh
[53:25] God, they're going to utter their voices
[53:27] to that group who can take the work.
[53:28] They can unlock the heavens. They can do
[53:29] whatever they want to do. Father God,
[53:31] may you send fire in the homes. Send
[53:33] fire in the hearts of your children.
[53:35] Send fire among your people. In Jesus
[53:37] name I ask it. Amen and amen. Give the
[53:40] Lord some praises right where you are.
[53:42] Oh, we are grateful tonight for his
[53:43] presence. We are grateful tonight for
[53:45] the anointing of God. And to those of
[53:47] you who take up with fasting here, Jesus
[53:50] didn't say if you fast, he say when you
[53:52] fast. Oh hallelujah. That means he
[53:54] expect you to fast. He expect you to be
[53:57] part of your Christian experience. So we
[53:59] get on another time of prayer. May God
[54:01] be with you. God bless you.
