people who were healed in their homes as request for me me for prayer one brother saw the fire the fire Pillar of Fire others in meeting felt the fire but as one brother says most of all lives would change lives would transform but I will brought a tremendous inspiration on the seven Thunders showing is not even but the brand Thunders it's Christ Thunders amen Mighty Angel it came out of his mouth seven Thunders out of the voices from out the mighty Angel really really powerful amen and um the other brothers we were there we were tremendously blessed we still awaiting the Taps and I know it will be a blessing to you I spoke on the sovereignity of the local church and there's a fivefold Ministry yet how ministers have messed up so bad that um I was asked a question is there going to be a universal Pastor that one kind of blow me out so I told them if you're going to have that then you'll get a universal poop a universal message poop so we Pope pontiff and you Mr Francis or whatever so the Lord help us to address that I call that present matness where ministers are telling the people who's in the fold and who's not in the fold and go only to the fivefold and don't even listen to a local Minister but this is the exact nicolan Spirit sir that God said he hit in the church ages isn't that right which is the spirit to conquer the Ley the way in which they were conquered God must use men and the fivefold Ministries are gifts to the entire world but you cannot break the sovereignity of the local church so I told them I'm not there to govern them in India rule them Bishop to them anything like that I come to put my shoulder to the wheel to men who are in the vineyard amen men have like Precious fate facing this great battle I'm not going to answer for India or Africa or America or anywhere else right here I'm going to answer I'm going to answer for so then I spoke about the five4 ministry yet so we had a tremendous time so we thank God for it and thank God for your prayer and uh God did answer your prayer for those meetings well I heard s the message messages put away childish things and um well teren exhorting on your position and finding your position acting on it am it's on the website so if you haven't heard it you should hear it and I really enjoy some things he said he said um all you call no man can come come except the father draw him so what you're doing here kind of like that no one could come except the father draw him so what you doing here the only reason you're here because the father draw you you didn't you didn't come on your own the father Jo that's why you're here I mean that was such a blessing the whole thing and um when I was a child I speak like a child I understood as a child and What U so strange read the same scripture in India 1 Corinthians 13 and he was bringing out a child how the Bible placed it when I was a child I speak like a child and that's what a child does is speak first before even thinking you ever see a 18mon old child could talk see a year and a month year old child say and say look a baby 18 months looking at 12 months and saying look a baby when I was a child I speak like a child I understood like a child but when I became a man I put away childish things and God requiring us to put away childish things but so when you see people speaking without thinking without understanding you know that is immature they speak because they have a mouth child children speak because they they know words they repeat words they say back what other people saying and many time people doing that they don't have their own Revelation so they're repeating what others saying without real understanding they're saying what this one is saying but Peter Peter didn't do that some say you're are John the Baptist some say you are this some say that but who do you say that I am and Peter said thou are the Christ the son of the Living God and then God blessed and so on Flesh and Blood had not revealed to you but my father and that was the first time the word church was used Upon This Rock I will build my church that's the first time the word church was used Jesus used it he said I will build my church Upon This Rock praise the name of the Lord that rock of Revelation so you love him this morning you appreciate Joshua brother Joshua here in the song amen God bless you brother Joshua thank you amen praise the name of the Lord so let's all stand for the word we want to go into the word this morning let's sing before we go let's sing through the blood through the blood we can come into His presence just be you switch true the blood through the blood we can come into His presence through through the blood Jesus made made a way that we can come into presence for through turn and greet somebody and testify

turn your Bibles to Ephesians chapter 4 want to read verse 11-13 and Revelation chap 1 verse 1-3 there's two portion of scriptures Ephesians 4 11-13 and Revelation 1 1-3 Ephesians 4:1 and he gives some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the Perfection of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man Hallelujah unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ Revelation chapter 1 want to read from verse 1 to 3 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God give unto him Jesus Christ to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass am amen and he sent and sign ified by his Angel unto his servant John who be a record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand Amen Let Us bow our heads Hallelujah almighty God may you inspire us edify us reveal yourself to us come Among Us manifest your love to us we are helpless this morning we are needy this morning and we call upon your matchless name your awesome power to make known your word to your people hallelujah take me out of the way hi me on calvary's cross and may be glorified in our midst in Jesus name I ask it amen name you may be seated praise God hallelujah well this morning I have a title the passion to know the word that's the title this morning the passion to know the word I have a subject the knowledge of the Son of God and I have an inspiration God said so amen amen have a context scripture from Psalms 119 verse 9 says where it th shall a young man cleanse his way by taking heed there unto according to Thy Word with my whole heart have I sought thee am oh let me not Wonder from thy Commandments Thy word have i hidden my heart that I might not sin against thee I think that scripture what reading again this is from Psalms 119:9 where ital shall a young man cleanse his way how is a young man to be cleansed by taking heed there to according to Thy Word with my whole heart have I sought thee oh let me not Wonder from thy Commandments Thy word have i hidden my heart that I might not sin against thee so his word you could actually hide it in your heart you could treasure it nobody can see it on you it's inside of them you are covered inside your heart David said with my whole heart I sort out to thee now passion means a strong feeling or enthusiasm or excitement for something that's what a passion is it's enthusiasm a strong feeling that causes you to act in a dangerous way that's when you have passion passion is emotions as distinguished from reason when somebody have a passion it look like they reasoning they are zealous they're enthusiastic they are on fire they have an outburst they are animated they have joy there's intensity to go with it you don't have passion half dead you don't have passion half sleepy that's not passion you are sleepy passion you excited about it you can't wait to get there God when they said unto me let us go in the house of the Lord and we talking this moment about a passion to know the word of God a passion to know what God said that you could tell that they God said so come on say Amen somebody you got to know what you have to tell that devil because when you're confronted by that devil and you don't know you don't know what to tell that devil the devil will slap you up tap you up and push you in a corner but when you know it is written come on say it is written when you know it is written it is written oh I want fire to break upon your soul that there'll be a deep in your soul crying for the word of God hallelujah crying for the knowledge of the Son of God hallelujah blessed is he that readeth and hearth the words of this book oh give the Lord a shout of Praise people huah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord now the scripture we read in Ephesians prise God and he Amplified he said and his gifts were varied he himself appointed and give men to us some to be Apostles special Messengers is the Amplified some prophets Inspire teachers and expound some evangelists preachers of the Gospel traveling missionaries some pastors Shepherds of this flock and teachers amen his intention was the perfecting and the full equipping of the Saints his consecrated people that they should do the work of ministering towards building up Christ body the church amen so the real church is Christ body it's not men Church no it is my church the one that Jesus said he's going to build that is his body so when we talk about church we not talking about this building or this bunch of people we talking about by one Spirit we are baptized into one body and that body is called The Church come on say Amen somebody so this is a gathering of people we say this is church but the real church is the body of which he is the head come on say Amen somebody not Pope Francis no he is the head of that body amen hallelujah not some Bishop in Rome or any other Bishop from any other part of the world he is the head of that body do you know him oh Hallelujah do you know him you got to know him Hallelujah okay prise God he this part that it might develop until we all attain Oneness in the faith amen and in the comprehension of the full and accurate knowledge of the Son of God that we might arrive at really mature manhood the completeness of Personality which is nothing less than the standard height of Christ's own Perfection the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ and the completeness found in him they'll be all come into the union of the faith the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the Statue of a that's what we talk about where the full maturity fully grown that they could handle your stuff no more immature no more childish no more playing Nintendo and playing games and so forth praise God in the plane coming back down see a big man and he just holds hold trip whole trip whole trip whole trip hands going like that the complaint of God and you will see where the title comes from but brand was reading veran for nevertheless I have somewh against thee because thou has left thy First Love Hallelujah you see I like your labor I like how you hate them who H hate the nicolan spirit I like how you're challenging them who say the apostles are not and to be Liars you're exposing Liars they pulling a rank on you you're checking them out by the word of God Amen Hallelujah nobody pulling W over your eye no you know the word because Paul taught them they used to tell them you're not preaching what Paul preach you're not preaching what Paul preached Paul is a messenger of the age he's a star he's the in the right hand of almighty God you got to say what Paul say Amen if you're not say what Paul say you are false [Applause] amen that's how these Dre that's how these Ephesians Believers were like that they were in the word they know the word Oh Glory to God they had a passion to know the word they a Zeal to know the word they just come to church they want to be just in the message they want to become the message do you know your message hallelujah hallelujah so God have a complaint against them God you left your first love that works that building that Deon ushers and Elders that everything you can think about but the love was not there Hallelujah because for God it has to be about love you have to love him to truly serve him isn't that right listen to The Prophet now okay here we go to understand this you must realize that this now he's referring to this same statement nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because th was left thy first love to understand this you must realize the spirit is not speaking to the original Saints of Ephesus alone this message is to the entire age which lasted 120 years the message then is to all the generations in that span Now history keeps repeating itself in the generation of Israel we see Revival in one generation only to see the fires fading in the next in the third generation The Embers may be glowing slightly fourth there'll be no vestig of the original flame then God have to light the fire again and the same process is repeated what is he saying God's fire start off It Go lower It Go lower then you had to find it because you a see no fire right I will fire out and God the light is again fire flare up Zeal enthusiasm passion love of God and then fire cool down cool down and that repeat over and over so listen to how we describe it then God lights a fire again same process is repeated it's simply the manifestation of truth that God has no grandchildren that's right amen salvation is not passed by natural birth anymore than there's any truth to Apostolic succession that's right isn't in the word amen you start out with truly Born Again Believers amen and then the next generation are no longer just playing Christians but they have taken a denominational name they are now Baptists methodists that's exactly what they are too they are not Christians you have to be born of the will of God not the will of man not because your mother in church is a Christian your father in church Christian is to be [Music] Christlike Hall like brother tell me some of the most evil people you ever meet is in this message a good Lord that not bad behavior people know that not backing people they go on the other side now they need believe but the evil evil spirited now watch they are not Christians you have to be born of the will of God not of the will of man to be saved but these folks are all coming together by the will of man now I don't say that some of them not AR of right with God no but the original fire has died down this is where I get it from now and I see three message inside today the fervent desire to please God the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out in the spirit all begins to fade and instead of the church being on fire with the fire of God it has cooled off and become former that is what was happening to the Ephesians they were getting a bit formal the abandonment to God was dying out and people here we go weren't too careful about what God thought of them as they begin to be careful about what the world thought of them so then you have to do your here a certain way because you want nobody laugh at you they had to dress a certain way because they don't want laugh at you and you see Muslims you see people in the gong it could be hot and they only the eye alone showing they're not ashamed they're wearing the black you can see the juice the black pants the same white shirt you don't there one shirt and one pants they have every time you see them the same color they're not even looking colorful about it they have the thing in the back of the head boys are little curs and so on you can see them from a distance but Christian getting fight to even bow their heads and pray for their meals in public hallu we're talking about an abandonment to God and every time I see these extremities I tell myself why we can't be not so much extreme but zealous and enthusiastic about this glorious message and this evening light that God brought of us understand we were wretched miserable naked poor didn't even know it God rich in Mercy come and send a prophet bring light in this dark age that you could know where to walk praise God praise God and we have big shots we have arrogant proud people people that feel the self rightous judging everybody and whatnot but it's the mercy of God that came to us to send us that Elijah the prophet am to bring a seven SE seven T message oh glory to God hallelujah we should be rejoicing every time we come to service thank you Lord thank you Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah your hands will be always up praise God hallelujah praise God hallelujah when the devil come into the church and see you say let's get out of here praise God and people worshiping too much let's get out of here H when them demons looking for a church to go and interfere with he must pass here straight he said not that one not that one those people on fire they have the Zeal of the Lord Jesus said the Zeal of my father's house had eaten me up he took a belt and beat them out he was so Inus he it it make him act radical come on say Amen somebody it made Jesus act radical because he said my father's house shall be a house of prayer and you have made it into a den of Thieves Hall Oh Glory Hallelujah glory to God God don't judge you by how much money you have how much Frid how mucho of car how much Whatever It Is God don't

studying to be reflect the word he was the word itself he was reflecting what we must become we have to find our scripture you have had to have a pass a Zeal and enthusiasm to find your position to find your scripture to find your word hallu hallelujah amen Moses seen the victory he had focused himself though being a prince do heir to the throne of Egypt he Focus himself listen away from the lust of the world that's right he focused himself away from the Beauty and Power he had with his own listen he had within his own potential to receive yes some you can make money here make money here achieve this year at what cost that's right that's right at what price sometime it just isn't worth it we have to learn to say no your time is too precious you have to say no to people who waste your time I know one executive used to ask one of his Partners how much time I say no for the day every day ask how many time I say no because the more the better the more know your say the more I know your focus wow because everything come to distract you from your goals everything that's right everything comes to distract you you want to do this this call this text this person say this this person want but this is what you want to do Hall when to shut down this and shut down that and shut down that you come focused Paul said I I pressed towards Hallelujah the mark of the high calling but he said forgetting the things that have passed because he passed the stap you into looking back what you miss what you lose but you're not seeing what you're going after head but he so my press forward I I press to what's the Mark I I lean forward I strive I give a push in your spirit I am not what I'm supposed to be so I'm striving I'm not perfect yet but I'm striving I'm not ready yet but I'm striving therefore I Can't Be Tardy I can't be I just B bowing under no I got to press my way I feel tired yes but I shake it off praise God the snake bit me but I shake it off shake it off in the fire disaffect me but I shake it off I get this mind battle but I'm shaking it off because I've got to go where I supposed to go I've got to make it come on say Amen somebody Hallelujah Oh Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah so he focused that out until he's seen the Blessed people by the promise of God by the promise of God but he focused in because he know what that God promised Abraham he would be visit his people and he knew he was raised for that purpose so he focused it all out Pharaoh did not have that potential he was offered it but he refused it and when you refuse it you can't focus amen amen but made a powerful statement you cannot accept the devil's word and tell he reject God's truth so before you go in Rebellion mode you young people you break all your red lights because you don't want to listen to your mother and father that's the Bible say honor your mother and father that your days might be long before you do all of that you have to go in Rebellion mode where you don't want to hear God you don't want to hear reason you don't want to hear the word you don't want to hear those that go on in front of you that have experience that pain and burn on the stones and rock ahead and because you haven't seen the rocks yet you prepare to go yourself because you really want to do your own thing you really want to do your own thing and you feel you know because you are young and you're strong Hallelujah and some that strong can work against you you end up strong will foolish strong will instead of surrendering your will to God and that's why you have to be able to surrender thy will be done thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven and the only way you can get a revelation of God's will is by getting his word because his word reveal his will so if you're not in the word you can't even know the will of [Music] God come on now we in this word this this this this this this this this morning and the come coming to teach a little bit Hallelujah this what I'm doing here right now this morning I'll say it again you cannot know the will of God if you don't know the word of God not your dreams I know people holding on on the dreams to fulfill their own dreams are the dream cucko but they because they believe God give them the dream you see they don't want to say they dream because they eat too much of corn in night they don't want to confess that they don't

thing God how could you put God first when you're not in the word hallelujah how could you put first God first when you don't have a passion to know the will of God you know what Jesus said I must be about my father's business my father's business is to finish the work that means his father's business was in the word am when Jesus went into the temple he didn't just read any Scripture the Bible said he found the place where it was written how could he find that if he wasn't in the word he was in the word he knew where to find it he knew when to find it he knew when to read it he know when to fulfill it that is what said he was so on point he was so caught up with word and thought of God and expressing God's thoughts that one day say heaven would pass away but my words could never pass away that's how conscious he became of the power now mind you the prophets had the authority also when Elijah cursed the children the Bears came after them because said God had to honor their his word because was the word of a prophet Prophet is the mie of God so they had to be careful what they say that curse was a curse blessing was a blessing or when they release your blessing nobody could take that back when there is a curse nobody could take that back so when the prophet blesses you you are blessed come on say Amen somebody when that word is released from his mouth you have it that's why when Christ came down the mighty Angel and seven tunders utter the voices when that voice is uttered to you nobody could take that away from you oh glory and God show you who you are when God show you your sunship then no devil could take that away Satan is jealous this morning because he can't be who you are he can't get what you are about to receive he has no inheritance in this Kingdom oh

made to be the independent but independent dependent on God that's right that's right not independent in himself but man could live independent of God and die as a man anybody could do that you could study education get a good job have a good car get a husband or wife get married get some children and just live and die are people do not every day all over the world not even Christians having a wife doesn't make a Christian or husband or having another husband doesn't make another Christian doesn't matter isn't that right but when you see what God has done and his purpose his Divine will to restore man you think God wanted us to be in this condition this condition give him an opportunity to reveal more of himself he wanted to be a Healer but there was nobody sick he wanted to be a sick savior but there was nobody lost he wanted to be Redeemer but there's nobody to redeem but with the fall brought God this opportunity to display all his glorious attributes he was the diamond with all them fire in him with all the light in him with all the glory in him wanted to express it how could you know God could heal kidney disease if you have no kidney disease how could God heal this disease and that condition if there was not that condition how could God cast out Devils is there no Devils to cast out stop complaining about the Devils St God can cast it out come on say somebody stop complaining about the blood issue and the female issue talk about the God that can heal your issue glory to God let's talk about that God this morning let's talk about him this morning let's not glorify the devil let's glorify God let's not talk about the devil talk about what God has done what the Lord has done and what the Lord is about to do not only has he done it but he's about to do great signs and wers will be performed by this end time church I'm looking for it I'm expecting it glory to God I expecting to just get whole and dry up and die I am expecting to see a move of the spirit glory to God I expecting all men to feel young again Hallelujah to feel young again make your feel to shout make your feel to dance make your feel to get up make your feel to take a book [Applause] amen oh hallelujah hallelujah Glory you may be seated you may be seated listen to this I've been a week in the country staying with some friends yes and I was talking about love and there was a person said to me I believe you an antichrist he's told my love and somebody said I believe believe you are an antichrist and brother Bram said if that would be pleasing to my Lord that's what I want to be Hallelujah now this is taking it to a Next Level this is not oh you could call me that you sinner you this is not that I rebuke you false Spirit In The Name of Jesus calling me Antichrist th demon you Glory Hallelujah listen to this praise God if that will be pleasing to my Lord hallelujah that's what I want to be I want to be whatever he wants me to be I love himall and if he should cast me into hell I will still love him if I go with the same spirit I have now Hallelujah you kind of look at me strange I seen four fine young men young wives fine women I know them boys love their wives I said to them here's the way to test it if your wife before you were married say you before married life you've been dreaming you were married you really wasn't married but you dream you were and you woke up and went and talk it over with your girlfriend and said you know I dream we were married and we had children we living happy and waiting for the coming of the Lord and everything else and this girl said to you you know I love another man better than I love you I would be happier with the other man could you from your heart love her well enough to say God blessing rest upon you my dear go with this other man amen amen now that's serious stuff that is not skim milk you see you see how the amen's light light light light God this is serious stuff now check that each of you man or woman if your love is correct you would do that for you are interested in her welfare you see there are so many selfish people what come them out is I myself and I come back again so the story is I myself I what I want what I feel what I want they're selfish they don't give to those and the strange thing something open up to me about selfishness selfish people get jealous because there's one all for themselves when they see somebody have more than them or better than them they get a fight and get more selfish they get what them have so God could hardly bless somebody that is selfish because the blessing stop right there that's right the blessing stop shuts down there when God finds somebody that could give he channels things through them and the more they could give the more they get to give and God just using them because they come make a Channel of God's love and presence God know if he drop too much a bless up on that selfish Rascal that Rascal will keep it for themselves it goes nowhere so God like to get people that could he could flow through there is my spirit flowing freely there is my life there is my love flowing there is my grace flowing there is my power flowing because Christianity is not living for yourself it's living for others come on give the Lord a shout that's what e life is you don't come here for you you come here for somebody else it makes life worth living oh Hallelujah joy to testify a joy to invite somebody at the service a joy to witness about his love amen not complain about your husband and there others who have none complain about your wife and some have none yeah try about your children some don't have any you claim about your shoes your shoes not up to date and some people have no shoes they wear in slippers that's right that's right complain about this you complain only complain complain complaining weakens your faith every time you always complain always have a complaint always no Praises no Thanksgiving you complain about this complain about that you have a complaining anointing and God had to complain about you they always complaining hear them hear them hear them but them two Hebrew boys say our God is able to deliver us so we not complaining if he doesn't we still not complaining we still not bowing down a we still not backsliding the church fall long I'm not backsliding because the church fall long go to church so I have the backslide you wanted the backslide that's you wanted the opportunity to backslide that's right now the church closed down then you I mean nobody going to church you mean make an excuse you know people do what they want to do true if you want to sing you will sing that's right you will sing to the top of your voice you'll sing with all your heart if you want to

be happy therefore whatever the will of God is let God will be done whether I'm happy with it or not I want to live here we go so he will be pleased with what I do therefore check your objective and your motive by that and you know whether you love God or not hallelujah oh Hallelujah you love him this morning all right let's continue Jesus said verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass away till all these things be fulfilled heaven will pass away but my words shall not pass away revelation 22 I testify unto every man whether B say that's priest Pope Bishop State presor whatever that hear the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add to him the plagues that are written in this book amen he said what about your Dogma what about your unscriptural Creeds you're listening to all the nomation there's not one excuse if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city but abam though he be a preacher though he be a church member all his life though he be a bishop a pope whosoever shall take one word just one word do you realize it was one word that Eve doubted caused all this trouble one spoken word of God doubted caused every sickness every disease every hospital to be built every operation to be performed just one word mixing you got to take the way God spoke it and won't mix with nothing Jesus said if you have faith like a mustard seed a mustard seed don't mix is that kind of Faith just one word isn't that right blessed be the name of the Lord so watch and we went that the seed started first and then slightly doubted and in Sarah and then he went on to Mary so today confused about the evidence of the Holy Ghost amen Satan can impl in any kind of gift of God but he cannot bring that word word by word that's where he failed in the Garden of Eden that's where he always failed and that's where the tape and false anointed ones they can be Anointed with the spirit speak in tongues shout preach the gospel and still be a devil did you hear that church amen anointed and still be a devil that's right but now the same thing is this if here we go if you are Son of God and if I am a Son of God or daughter of God we were in God at the beginning amen and when Jesus became the fullness of the word then we were in him in germ form amen when he was crucified we was crucified in his body am when he rose from the dead we rose with him and since we recognize that we are now set in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus because we are Sons and Daughters of God we are God's children we are attributes of God and when Jesus became all the world that we were part of him there you are and there is no devil no powers can ever move it that's the typos of the Soul no devil could move that no Minister could move that no Bishop no Pope could take your name out of the Lamb's Book of Life you are the words of the book Hallelujah that's why the book had to open because you are the words of the book come on say Amen somebody you were Jean thoughts in the back part of his mind but the word is a thought expressed so the thought had to be spoken Oh Glory to God to come into a manifestation and God said my word shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish your purpose i s for to accomplish oh hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God hallelujah so I don't care how much you can preach how much you love this and love that's one of the Outlets of the spirit you can't love with your buddy you love with your spirit that's one Outlets of the spirit you can love and even love God and still not be right you can cast out Dev and preach and do these things and still not be right but in the beginning was the word the word was with God and go was God you see the word touching your very Soul that's why Jesus could go to the one well and see what was in her soul the world see she was a prostitute she was living with this man and that man but Jesus saw beyond all of that and saw the seed in that woman and the word went to call the word the word went to call the thought the word went to call the attribute amen amen amen hallelujah amen so when the mighty angel came down he had to had a man on the earth that he could step in through to speak the word that Adam was supposed to speak because Adam was supposed to make and multiply and get back more Sons and Daughters of God but because Adam fell we have to go back to a whole cycle and now don't come the book The Mighty Angel one with the sweat back Wings one with the seven seal seven T of in the voices to bring back Sons go to the angel and take the book eat the and prophesy you can't have a passion to know the word a passion for that book give me the [Applause] book hallelujah oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah there are some denomination and churches amen that are ultimately their Believers this is my church this is this is my church this is my church they love their Church the Catholic love their priests love the nuns love Rome love Pope Francis that's that is De Pope but to me and to the ones that I hope I'm leading to Christ and by Christ the Bible is our ultimate amen let every man words be a lie mind be true no we talk about some church Baptist Church meod Church yes Jesus all right the first time the word church was used was when he said Upon This Rock I will build my church it was upon spiritual revelation of who of Jesus Christ not of some man not of some group it's the revelation of Jesus Christ Hallelujah bringing us into the knowledge of the Son of God yes you know Jesus personally hallelujah hallelujah he said want to if you want to read it and you quote the scripture Revelation 1 1-3 the Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ that's ahuh now we come back to something the Bible is what re the Bible is what re so the Bible is not just a history book A book of laws and ethics and behavior and what that is are people who not even Christians that behave real nice nice behave respectful humble and whatnot that's right praise God but the Bible is the revelation of of Jesus Christ not of some group not of some Bishop not of some Pope the revelation of Jesus Christ isn't not right so the Bible is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ wrote by the prophets Elijah all that they were were in him all that you are all that I am is in him words Witnesses of the word so it's not a book of systems moral ethics neither is it a history book or book of theology it is not it's the revelation of Jesus Christ God himself revealed from word to flesh that's why the say and the word became flesh and dwell Among Us this thought this word this expression actually become flesh that we could handle it that he touched me who touched me the word made flesh oh Hallelujah isn't that right God here we go God himself revealed from word to flesh that's what it is the Bible is the word and God is the Flesh and the God is the word rather and Jesus being the flesh is the Revelation how God was manifested in human flesh and revealed to us and why he became the Son of God he's part of God the body is part of the son isn't that right so let's go to the history it was written by 40 different writers 40 men wrote the Bible over a space of 600 years apart at different times predicting the most important events that ever happened in world history and no author but himself watch and there's not one error in the entire 66 books no author but God himself could be so accurate not one word contradicts the other these men wasn't even same age some most times and they have not contradicted each other that's the book we have called the Bible Hallelujah you're going to find out that is God in print form Hallelujah that book is God in print God in print devil hates that book and in that book two books he especially hate Genesis and Revelation cuz Genesis is his beginning and Revelation is his ending oh hallelujah praise the name of the Lord praise God so says now watch watch Luther was the feat Pentecostal the tongues lips now is the eyes prophetic look at that Luther was feet Pentecostal was known by what speaking in tongues and then after the tongues is what the eyes that's prophetic Malachi 4 now watch there is nothing else left for it to come but himself to step into that the next is the intelligence so after the eye is intelligence and we have no intelligence of our own we have no sight of our own he says then is the complete body of Christ being revealed in the form of a bride that's taken out of his side so when God was saying I'll restore he was restoring the bride body that Christ will come and connect with it as the head that is the invisible Union of the Bride amen connecting to Christ then you're going to see the visible Union of the Bride but you have to be an invisible Union where you connected to God by the Holy Ghost Hallelujah nobody in the world know where you at because you are in the body am you are not even in Trinidad amen you're in a capsule all by yourself you you're in a body the body of Christ so you walking but you're in a different world yeah that's right amen Hallelujah and that's how Jesus communicated when Herod say you know I can do something for you he said no no no no no if my kingdom was of this world I could send for help I could call angels to help me you you you can't help me this you don't even know what going on inside of here my father put you there amen hallelujah the picture was bigger than you know was Jesus was in a different real all together you see the problem is we are living in past present future and God out of that you can remember the past you in the present you could think about the future what going to happen and you're worried and concerned and your heart stressed out and whatnot but God is above all of that your past present and future is present to him to him there's no past present and future that why he can declare the end from the beginning you don't have to wait for the end he can come in the beginning and declare your end come on now he seen it straight [Applause] am you worried about next week and he already know what what next week holds amen if I could go up in the realm and go next week and bring it back for you you will see what God see already for you next week next week will be fine hallelujah what make you say that Romans 8:28 hallu Hallelujah for we know all things

write is the Commandments of God if you be spiritual I'm talking about when a man meet God the p is look look Moses Moses here praise God intellectually from his parents his speciality his special calling protection and whatnot Moses Tred thing kill one man and run I mean run out yeah not just run know run straight out take a 40 years holiday W when he met God and he going back that man is fearless that man have nothing to do with he kill a man yeah kill a man print it over again let let them recycle that the news 40 years ago Moses killed a man and and try to break Moses esteem so Moses hit Egypt newspaper print Moses and on the front page looking 40 years younger hallelujah praise wanted you could stroke that in Moses face Mo pushes amen amen what kingdom are you from the kingdom of the most high God hallelujah murderer whole bunch of protesters murderer you think Moses here he heard there man talking that he has nothing to do with that his past don't determine his future you see the man kill the man can't talk for God that's foolishness when God call a man nobody could change what God arranged for that man I don't care what that man have been through I don't care what that man have done I don't care where that man have been when God have a purpose for that man life nothing going to stop the purpose of [Applause] God the Bible is a perfect book if it wasn't they never talk about David adultery they never talk about Noah drinking they never talk about all the sins of the brothers in the Bible because the Bible is a perfect book it have truth in it it say all have sinned and come short of the glory not some but all there is none righteous no not one the Bible teaches that so we are all free this morning H thank you Jes I can't finish this today it's too much I'm going to come out hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah let me drop a BM on you he designed the word all right that he could hide himself in the scripture to the smartest theologian he could hide himself set right there in the scripture and you can look all day long and never see it look for a lifetime and never see it he can hide himself there God in the word can hide himself showing the word that there's not a theologian in the school could find him yet he is sitting right there you say is that right brother BR how about the Pharisees and Sadducees how about every age he's done it he done it in every age Noah smart intellectual how he hid himself in his promised word in the days of Moses he he himself in Elijah he himself he said he came on his own his own receive him not so could sit in his word waiting for the believer to open it waiting for the believer to to to to reveal it to Hallelujah if you don't go how he can reveal himself to you when God waiting for you to part the Bible part the spoken word book begin to get into it and study and pray and the words to jump up wo then it brings stimulation of Revelation then that brings prevailing power upon your life so all this weak and you're struggling and you don't know how to make it all of a sudden you get prevailing power because God begin to reveal himself to you right out of the word because you're showing you have a passion to know the word of God you interested in the will of God you want to be about your father's business you don't just want to be hanging in church you want that breakthrough he hide himself from the smartest you see well this is Dr father's holy so and so I don't care who he is God hides himself from him and revealed to Baby s would learn the babies of God is predestinated seed so think think the Mighty God setting in his own word blinding the smart educated people of this present age and they think is a bunch of fanaticism and look at him there standing hiding to Pentecostal Baptist Methodist reveal himself publicly sh all kind of signs and so forth you said but Jones brother so and so he's a great man he will see it oh no he reveal it to whomsoever he will or this brother years in the message he old in the message but sometime the old one does get like that guy with Samuel dim sighted and not seeing right somebody is real blind they so long they get blind they say old they get numb they get kind of you know kind of Doty kind of old Hallelujah where they don't know what they're supposed to know but God reveal it to whom he will so you can't say God can Reve to that sister or that brother you can't say God can this one because this happened no no no to whomsoever he will oh musician come up please I think I know W up here God is known by Simplicity and a revelation of Jesus Christ to the most illiterate person not your theology it's a revelation of Jesus Christ Upon This Rock I build my church no other rocks accepted no other things accepted no other Roman Rock no other Protestant Rock no other school no other nothing but exactly the revelation of Jesus Christ through the new birth he is born in there Hallelujah and he injects his own life and your life is gone and the life of Christ is projecting itself through you Hallelujah showing the preeminence is to the people and the prophet said this the ministry comes to Perfection when Christ is manifested in natural we're not talking about a sermon we're not talking about what you could write down as a note we're not talking about what you say you never see it that way we're not talking about that we talking about Christ is reproduced in natural hallah that means the word amen has become flesh amen by lack of this revelation of what of Jesus Christ is why we have so much different divisions that's that's that's right not Revelations causing divisions but the lack of Revelation is why we have so many different divisions among us so much mockery so much division is because the people lack that Revelation they lack the Revelation the teachers hallelujah hallelujah who lack it teachers the teachers lack the Revelation because if the teachers had the Revelation they will point the people to Jesus Christ that's it that's it and not to themselves that's it or their groups that's it or their church that's it hallelujah hallelujah that's why I'm so blessed to preach in India the sovereignity of the local church oh praise God Timothy 3:16 all scripture is given by inspiration yes of God and is profitable for Doctrine reproof correction and instruction and righteousness that the man of God May stand perfect thoroughly furnished in all good works amen all scripture is given by inspiration God is a person amen are you ready yes God can speak God can talk God can write amen God wrote with his finger The Ten Commandments isn't that right God can talk he talked to Moses on the mount in the burning bush he talked to John in the form of a dove this is my beloved Son of whom please to dwell in he spoke to Jesus on my Transfiguration he spoke to Jesus before whole multitude so watch he said on the writing that not one Jud or tit shall ever pass away until it's fulfilled until it's manifested then it come to pass now a t tit means a small Mark in other words not one punctuation one expression shall ever fail in the word of God because it's God God manifested in the form of human flesh they only interpret the prophets as God would permit them to interpret amen and if you want first Peter 20 is of no private interpretation that's right so nobody not supposed to say I think it mean this the prophets alone have the qualification to interpret the word hallelu not a pastor that's right not a preacher the prophet alone has the authority to interpret the scripture the preachers have to come under the prophet and say what the prophet says because the prophet spoke for God Amen so the man of God the prophet cats the thoughts God speak the word of God for the entire age so if the age is a thousand years that word is for the Thousand Years the prophet may die whatever dim he die but the word Still Remains so the Bible said ration 10:7 in the days of the voice brother Bram is not here but the voice is still here we are still living in the days of the voice it's the voice of God in the last days but the bride will be the voice of God but the prophet and the bride and the spirit will will be saying the same thing and what they say has already been said in the word so there is no mistake about it there is no argument with it God word can't lie if God say he will heal you he will heal you if God said he will fill you he would fill you don't do like Sarah and slightly doubt believe God with all your heart oh hallelujah oh glory to God just a little more prophets did not always understand what they were writing or what they were saying or they were no wise have said it amen amen they couldn't they could understand it they were moved by the Holy Ghost moved by the Holy Ghost holy men moved by the Holy Ghost so when Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive if he was thinking it true he never write it but that's impossible but he had to write it Hallelujah because God said it in other words God Said So once God speak it it's got to come to pass there will be a Revival in Trinidad there will be the bride Revival once there's a bride in Trinidad there's a bride Revival in Trinidad and seven Thunders will be the bride Revival in Trinidad and Around The World God said so 7,000 get fith God said so that's the pr Revival God said so you're going to have Dynamics and the mechanics God said so they will get back your joy God said so they will get your inheritance God said so hallelujah hallelujah but you got to know what God Said Hallelujah Glory so the prophet writer thank you Lord the prophet writer must be constant fellowship with the author amen he must live constantly in the presence of the auor to know what the book is going to be so these men were not intellectual men no these are men that was inspired oh Elijah he wasn't much to look at when he come down that dusty road but he had dust say at the Lord his ballhead gleaming at midday noon but when he stood there and not even du a rain will fall till I call for it my god when Prophet come people tremble because they know God was coming they know the word was coming they know thunder and lightning was coming because that was on the mountain and God said don't let the God speak let Moses speak Hallelujah isn't that right and God I'm going to lose prophets to bring the word to them amen oh Hallelujah and we have a 20th century Prophet my God how would you like to live back there with Elijah oh with Jeremiah or with Ezekiel and these men come out of nowhere stump down into a village and prophesy God could write there was writing on the wall Hallelujah time up thank you Jesus amen you found in the balance I found wanting Hallelujah man rejoicing King clanging and drinking and whatnot and he didn't know it was finished yeah that's right oh Hallelujah God could write God could speak amen that's right God is the word that's right so God know exactly what he said in his word he know exactly what going to be in the last days he know the spirit of men and lust of power he know the greed that going to be in the last days he know the authority listen we have de all along dictators naturally president for Life prime minister for Life conquering people for years they can't conquer the but they conquer country yeah God will not allow that that's right God took Jesus the example seat son the first thing God did is to send Wilderness not send him to get a a banner on Wave like the Pope Francis and everybody waving at Pope Francis no he went into the Wilderness to overcome the devil amen then he went into the scriptures to find what it's written because he was the it written son that what Mary had a son come is written and then he begin to his ministry looking to fulfill scripture I needs past through Samaria fulfill scripture his life was fulfilling scripture oh Hallelujah so that's why the prophet had his mindset constantly what God Said not what man thought what the age taught what the church taught what the kingdom taught what God taught he only expressed God thoughts to words because a word is a thought when is expressed oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah praise God all other words I don't care well they are placed amen how who they come from what denomination they come from how smart the man is is to be absolutely ignored so we don't he the pre- Time Magazine Music Magazine and what in news paper we not here for that we here to preach the word of God a because Paul said though we or an angel from heaven preach any thing let him be a cursed in other words listen to The Prophet words now if an angel come down from heaven a bright shining Angel would stand you said boy that would be a bit for this day wouldn't it a bright shining Angel come here and stand and say things was the word you say Satan get away from me amen amen amen all want say Amen to you want to see the bright shining [Music] angel testimon I see a bright shining Angel you Sprite shining I what Angel say I don't want to hear How Shining is I just want to know what you say if he say contr to the word tell him go back where he come from get behind me Satan because this message is on the word it's not right and shiny is the word are you with me okay so if he's a bishop whatever is don't you never believe him if he doesn't speak exactly with the word with the Bible watch him he will carry with the Bible now he will carry to a certain place and then hook it right there and when the Bible is saying something and he bypasses that watch him right there oh hallelujah praise His wonderful name Oh Glory to God hallelujah oh glory to God praise His holy name thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah give him some Praises people hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord glory to God Amen Hallelujah say how will we know the Messiah the people that's believe in him this feast in the trumpets unless they are constantly in the word to know what he is so you can't just be going wrong with church you have to be constantly in the word to know how the Messiah is unfolding himself oh blessed be the name of the Lord Praise His Wonderful Name blessed be the name of the Lord praise God hallelujah Glory Hallelujah God can change hallelujah praise His wonderful name so if Talk About Eve I'm finished with this quote if she just stayed right and said God said so that sett it God said so she didn't want to do that see she changed the focus of her glass and begin to see instead of being one way there become two ways maybe this man could be right maybe he is right we know God Is Right right maybe he is right this is just more light on what God said this is a hidden Mystery a a hidden Mystery that not in the word that a hidden Mystery that is Satan hiding under HISD mystery any mystery a man bringing and revealing have to be in the word but Christ is the mystery of God revealed so a lot of people taking saying a lot of stuff a lot of strong stuff and deep stuff and whatnot i' have woman talk about itching ears want to hear a lot of stuff new stuff but at the
