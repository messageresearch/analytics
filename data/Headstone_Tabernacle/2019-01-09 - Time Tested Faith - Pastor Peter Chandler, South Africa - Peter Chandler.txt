========================================

[Music] you [Music] [Music] I mean god bless you Saints we welcome in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ tonight we're gonna start off the meeting the Convention was brother Branham with a short video clip of 10 minutes preaching to us so we'd like him to open the convention and and when the video clip ends I'd like us all to stand up and welcome the presence of the Holy Spirit amen so the prophets can switch it on there the church today needs power in truth again Oh God raised up his son that this would be taken care of barri said on the wild in the world will see me no more yet he'll see me where I'll be with you even in you we find out at Hebrews 13 that he's the same yesterday today and forever we find out in my love hot for that he promised us a message in the last days that would restore the faith of the people back to the fathers again he promised it in the last days he also promised to John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also even more than this or greater than this show he do for I go to my father he's speaking one day they said master show us a sign he said a week an adulterous generation seeks after sign that's the generation we're living in today he said it I'll give him aside Orin Jonas was in the Bennett away or three days tonight soul must the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days tonight what kind of a sign would a wicked and adulterous generation find out the resurrection sign that's what we're promised today the resurrection sign that he's still alive yesterday today and forever now after 1900 years with the church ages past all the things that he prophesied Lutheran Wesley's we just went through and seen draw it out he cut down and drawed out the Lord darted on the board here Forrest shorten come down himself and confirm the be right after 99 years and we're at the end I'll delay hacia church age he promised in Luke 17 30 that this same son of man it promised them would be revealed in the days like it wasn't Sodom upon the earth did he do it doesn't have to come to that it's impossible I remember he come in three names the son of man the son of God the spirit the son of David or the leader but in between this conjunction at 42 years old words in the day when the Son of man shall be removed repeat himself as well a son of God's name will reveal yourself in a different way now what does that make Malachi 4 exactly right they the son of man will reveal himself not in a whole big denominations and things that we've had to the agent but he would manifest himself as son of man again to make manifest Malachi or did that day I was said to you he's the height of the prophecy and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the Apostolic fathers away from all this denomination ISM and come back to the original word again throughout that last day pride tree that he posed in the evening time it shall be light up to the misty day it shall be like you'll be a day can be called a date or not see it's picking up the body but the same hand that were sure these d'azur the west again there shall be light in the evening time oh my I feel like singing a song [Music] big story of the night a prisoner to the word will of God because you can move it so God move what your eyes like that Oh Lord your God and your God for every moly and we are so happy to know that you promised that you would have a remnant when you come to the earth regardless of what goals are comes there's going to be people that's going to be ready we know that there is a paddy that man gives to god there's a tithing amongst of people perhaps maybe we'd say 1/10 of all the world's harvest through the ages would be that elected it's Vince Collins law I believe and as a father with an epileptic son years the goals that help thou my unbelief we hear this question asked one day when he returns what he find faith he never questioned whether we find righteousness or whether we find Christians but would he find faith twenty return knowing that it be one thing people let's go on hearing also the Holy Spirit speaking in the last days at how these times would man would have a form of godliness but would deny the power lack of faith we thank the Lord tonight because it in our hearts we feel that we have just a little faith and help us Lord that that faith may be increased tonight until it be so high so lost and complete serenity Christ I know great mighty works will be gone tonight in my name cast out Devils speak with this tongue take up serpents if you drink up to anything it was the harness if the major hands on the fifth day shall recover right anybody deficit over the lifetime is Boyd considered audible on the earth click that box Billy first there is begin to return right he said when I return will I find faceless these times shall follow them that believe they that's the last Commission Jesus case and here's a question yes will I find things when I return I need ever stable I find righteousness will I find the church well I find people he said well I find faith that's the question the other day I made for my encompasses Billy a certain pastor here in the city or lovely little person I ever seen set wise now respect was a pajamas all about midnight is that it has to run in and evening drinks and coffee with us they took out over two elevators houses shook hands to them this hamper the cart gaming instead on played card to them by weight is a most sociable little feller you've ever seen so all we loving we wouldn't get rid of him for nothing I stood there a little bit on so well so don't you think it ever church needs a man like that I couldn't answer then he said in another one place that they had such a lovely place this minister and his wife lovely people went out and deal with the children so much tell he had a Bible School instead they just had so many it's over old to thank the new children said my you can tell they're all kinds of little stories that little children that's it that's nice that's awful I went back I just come from Canada although your honor not people's time what's man be I don't do that I went washing on my car Oh God I'm gonna be an old man Here I am both of cried a big maybe I get the big black beans and II as somebody say something bad about you Oh Holy Roller something like that I thought about that his boys come to me said bad Mans all right if they're doing this but I never called you to do that I've told you to take the swords and you're like Josh away and John not to the realm of civil society here subs church organization but challenge the devil painting the forefront make room preach the word and find out who's got the painting I have noticed recently it has been and the meetings where I've been holding all around nationwide and into Cuba and down into the islands every time an interpretation comes it's always if thou will believe my emergency believe it all that was a question Jesus asked will I find fate when our return did stable online churches will I find religion but will I find things not even needed questions theory but he questioned failed because design in the scripture in Malachi for that there is to be an anointing come down and to restore again that original faith and to bring the faith of the people back to the original thinking awesome cause above more than five or you might see that truth I've seen enough [Music] then restored back again that fathers will see the revelation of God in Christ he knew that these great trying times had come to prove all nations and approve all peoples so therefore he knew that the great question later not whether he would rise again by whether even be crucified according to the scriptures but not whether he would have sinned on high and the Holy Spirit would jump but the question was would that be any faith left on earth at his coming and where his faith comes by hearing the Word of God that was his question will there be faith on earth when I come will he find people who believe his word lettuce tannin welcome to Holy Spirit just zero in and say Lord God I'm here for a purpose why you brought me to this

inspiration brother Thompson a man shall he find faith I believe this belongs here and I will read this and a few other scriptures just to get us in line for the message tonight Habakkuk 2:3 for the vision is not yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it Terry wait for it because it will surely come it will not tarry praise be to God I would like to add into that Isaiah 55 and first eleven so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return void unto me but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing we're on to I sent it a man finally I believe the scripture belongs in the message tonight 1 Corinthians 13 and verse 8 charity never faileth hallelujah whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away a man praise God Lord Jesus these few words tonight Lord only you can take the lid off the word we pray that you would do so Lord and get glory to yourself Lord as it was on the road to mas when Jesus spoke to them and their hearts were burning and burning may that come to pass throughout this convention that we may know it was Jesus talking to us along the way bless every heart and my objective is to be a simple encouragement to the bride that at the end we may say I feel encouraged to Presta battle granted Lord we give you honor and praise in Jesus Christ wonderful name amen amen you can be seated of course Luke is a very central Scripture today and for the rest of the convention and he goes on to say nevertheless when the Son of Man comes shall he find faith on the earth and the amplified calls that persistence in faith amen or perseverance in faith praise be to God and so I believe that he's looking for faith I believe mama Eagle is flying over looking for faith hallelujah and he's finding faith amen the chickens are not responding but the Eagles are responding yes yes amen what you're doing I can do that as well praise be to God so we give God the glory and we give him the honor for all that he's done in our life yes it's been a long time since brother Branham was here 53 something years but we give God thanks that we are still pressing on the battle we are still fighting the good fight of faith nothing is going to stop us god bless brother thompson for this inspiration it is so powerful I thought of putting slides but it was just changing and exploding and I couldn't really structure it into a presentation but I believe it would help somebody along their way today that is my prayer what a blessing brother Thompson has been around the world in London who he once preached a message called be careful Satan and we never forgot that inspiration my and we are still saying be careful Satan can be your shot be careful Satan [Music] hallelujah time-tested faith now you know I realize that this the whole inspiration is about the second coming of Christ I'm just going to show you some interesting parallels with the first coming of Christ you know since Malachi - Matthew was 400 years they call it the thank you they call it the 400 silent years how many's heard of the 400 silent years yeah there was no prophet which was just real quiet they had a long time to forget the prophets to forget the prophecies to be under no expectation at all for anything we think 53 is long what about 400 400 silent years now making a parallel with his first coming when Jesus came what would he find what would he find let me tell you God doesn't fail when he says something it has to come to pass after all that time when he came to the Virgin Mary and he told her what the agenda was and he took that old prophecy and he brought it to life Mary did not say what she said according to thy word be it unto me and that's what we are saying tonight according to my word Lord be it unto me hallelujah she was completely faith it was Mary's belief and there was no belief like Mary's belief Christ was born few people realized it Mary bought the baby into the temple everybody forgot we'll just baby baby baby baby but there was one old man oh when I come well I find faith God had revealed to him that he would not die but he would see the Lord he took that baby in his arms and he said O God let me return I can die now I have seen my salvation hallelujah glory will I find faith is that faith it was revealed to him faith is a revelation and if that wasn't enough there was an old blind lady called Anna who came walking up and she said Redemption has come to Jerusalem hallelujah glory to God thank you Jesus you can't get away from it amen after 400 years John the Baptist stood there and he said behold the lamb of God was coming to take the sins of the world away behold the lamb of God I am not worthy to loosen your shoes I am not worthy to baptize you John was in the faith and if that was not enough way over in the east there was a wise man hallelujah wise men today we would call them wise virgins hallelujah wise men brother when they came to Jerusalem they never said you know what's going on they said listen we have seen his star we have seen his star and we have come all this way to worship Him where is he King of the Jews oh you talk about a shaking or what a shaking they came they oh my god judge what a day we're living in now we have come all this way to worship the Lord I've come from London to Johannesburg to worship the Lord who feels the same way we have come from a long way we come so far so far so far to praise the Lord hallelujah I feel so good today when he comes will he find faith yes hallelujah glory let me read some quotes to you hallelujah Simeon was a righteous man Anna was a prophetess John the Baptist amen these people were looking for the coming of the Lord amen I want to pick up with what brother Thompson said he said this is where the shaking comes this is the shaking because people think it's nothing it's not nothing this is real you'll find this beautifully preached in Revelation chapter 4 part 1 it says here is where the shaking comes he said the Holy Spirit comes to those who God has called he said there's a great shaking amongst the elect great powerful thing is going on in Johannesburg here and the world knows nothing about it but we are shouting we are singing we are glorifying God is shaking we are the power that's shaking the hour I feel so happy that I know that Jesus is here Messiah is on the earth now hallelujah glory to God hey man it was great but they didn't know it and so is the gospel today great the gospel is shaking like it never shook before it's a shaking in the remnant but God is fixing them ready God is fixing me he's fixing you he's fixing us to be ready because the rapture is the reality we must have rapturing faith but the Prophet said it'll be there it'll be there don't worry it'll be there don't have to be anxious don't lose sleep it'll be there it is that saith the Lord hallelujah praise be to God long time today I'm just going to give you some examples okay of people that were ready Amen to give you inspiration it's been a long time but there's something moving on you anyway yeah something in spite of the time gone by it doesn't matter it hasn't even changed you hallelujah amen in the days of brother Branham you shouted amen in these days you're still shot hallelujah if there's one man who could have had a big complaint it was Caleb he could have had a big long complaint but let me talk about Caleb Caleb a long time went by he said listen Joshua 14 40 years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land I brought him word again it was in my heart nevertheless my brethren that went up with me may the heart of the people melt don't worry about these brethren I don't care about believe the sign and all this stuff I believe God's Word is true God's prophet is vindicated from the beginning to the end hallelujah glory to God bye brethren made my heart melt are you ready he says thou knowest the thing that the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and V in Kadesh Barnea caleb was not playing games he was not playing Church Caleb didn't wait for somebody else to say hallelujah and then he said hallelujah Caleb was praising God because he knew what Moses told him from the start amen amen hallelujah are you ready for a powerful quote here it comes let us stand like Joshua and Caleb this is going to have a spiritual background let us stand like Joshua and Caleb as we see the Promised Land coming in sight its nearing the time to be given it's been a long time that it's nearing the time Joshua means Savior Caleb means true believer who stayed with Joshua Joshua Holy Ghost Caleb stayed with the Holy Ghost I'm glad today I know I must stay where the Holy Ghost is being manifested this is not fanaticism hallelujah this is not fanaticism we know this is not fanaticism hallelujah this is revival this is the Holy Ghost this is Jesus Caleb stayed with Joshua Caleb stayed with Joshua I'm gonna stay with revival hallelujah I don't care what the ten spies do I'm won't revival I want my promises shout Amen somebody glory my mama it's a big question it's a big question who you know will he find faith after all those years Caleb kept the faith the ten spies say they began to doubt it was a big thing and then even in the days of Caleb you know something a lot of people never possess then they never in do a place of trying they never overcame but Caleb he said another spirit was with him Caleb overcame and when the time come let me tell you here what Caleb said he was a man he said these 45 years since the Lord has spoken to Moses he says Lord now I am forced go and 85 years old that means he's 85 he's 20 years older than me he's 85 do you think he says well I better cool down now no Caleb was just a strong hallelujah are you hearing me Caleb was just as strong as he was back there brother I can still shout amen I can still jump I can still say praise God I'm still as strong as I was back there and so are you so are you glory to God amen amen he says since I am now 85 I am strong as I was in the day that Moses sent me as my strength was then even so my strength is now for war both to go out and to come in I'm just as strong I'm not going to change hallelujah Amen after all these years Satan I'm just as strong my hallelujah is just as loud I can still forgive my enemy hallelujah glory give you the same way where's that Amen hallelujah praise the Lord God bless you amen amen in other words we are alive and remaining to the coming of the Lord hallelujah we're not dead God's not dead he is alive we're not dead we're alive to the coming of the Lord amen we remain many have gone this way and gone that way but we remain hallelujah we remain with the word of the hour hallelujah glory to God are you ready for the bombshell now therefore give me this mountain [Music] [Applause] Rory give me this mountain what mountains Amen in the day we heard the Anakin's were strong he says but the Lord be with me I shall drive them out and God gave Caleb I love that word therefore therefore amen dot-dot-dot therefore hallelujah keep me this mountain do you feel the same way keep me my family give me my perfection give me my seven virtues give me my revival or either God give me my Mountain you say it loud you say it clear because God is with you Caleb but true believer hallelujah the true believer oh my let's let's move along now praise be to God hallelujah no matter how long you matter how long that is one example are you ready for another one now you know something for a hundred years but Thompson they couldn't figure out how to build a certain bridge did you hear that a hundred years they couldn't it was a bridge from South Sydney Australia to North Sydney Australia and they they said that try this now let's try this no every plan was a non-starter and they for a hundred years did you hear that a hundred years and then suddenly an architect appeared from England you know what his name was the name was Jay Jay see breathe Jason JJC Bradfield and said can you do this job yes and he was an architect with great reputation it costs a lot of money millions in those days millions now just buy a few houses but those days it was big he said I can do it they found faith I can do it how can you know you're not going to do that I said listen underneath the ground is quicksand underneath is sand sand everywhere and this is so far you can't build a bridge across that he said I can I can do it there are you sure yes I can do it amen give me the contract and he took that contract and he made a decision amen they found faith there hallelujah I can do it it was far for the bridge but he had a plan can I put it this way he had a revelation of what to do hallelujah glory let me read this to you amen and he was an architect of great reputation you know what that means he couldn't fail and the Bible says charity never fails God has a reputation because his word cannot return void it must accomplish what he sent the word for shout Amen somebody I don't care what's going on God is faithful can we do it yes and this architect of great reputation he said I can do it it's called The Sydney Harbour Bridge they call it the coat hanger it is a big to this day it is a time-tested memorial to this day yeah praise the Lord I feel good well Tom's in mind well I find faith yes he said between North and South Sydney he says but from England came a renowned contractor with a reputation he says when this man went there by God he placed all those materials together and he knew he could not build on gravel that's what Pentecostals can understand and it was some big blows to blow out all the gravel he blew the gravel out for each pillar one two three each pillar he put down he had to blow the gravel out you cannot build upon gravel you cannot build upon hope Jesus had upon this rock I'll build my church and the case of Hell will not prevail against it and he had this revelation vanished he started blowing let me read it to you oh let me read this he says he blow those shifting sands away until he put the concrete on the rock praise be to God he did that a man and he reached down to the rock rock rock and they even laughed at him they said look even if a chicken goes across this bridge it will fall he said it won't fall because I'm building it upon a rock you must have Revelation faith is Revelation hallelujah he put that down he started to pour in the concrete our man this bridge was so powerful it was so true amen it went from south to north sydney amen maybe I can say from faith to charity that's where it went this bridge was so powerful it never moved the critics were all saying this and saying that but he said be quiet and this man he said over here watch over here he said he brought out the shifting sands and the Bible says this is so powerful but if you do these things you shall never fall and now unto him that is able to keep us from falling hallelujah and present us faultless before the Father be honor and glory he put down those he says he can keep it from falling and he says those things went down the Prophet said he knew what he was doing and you know what he did when it was finished he never said ok you guys you go over the bridge he said let me myself let me myself cut over the bridge brother if you want to google this you'll find a great article there you'll see all the pictures what the Prophet said was true it was true a man he went on the front train he went like this because he knew that bridge was going nowhere and when you get a revelation I tell you no devil in hell is gonna move you hallelujah no devil gonna move you praise the Lord Jesus has a reputation he can't lose you he can't lose the bride and let me tell you the rapture is the set the Lord praise God Amen thus saith the Lord is gonna happen praise God let's move now a bit more and I want you to show you this it's like Jesus he says they pass from south to north sydney he put the mayor in there and he got front walking with her packing a flag that bridge couldn't move no matter what happens it couldn't move Church many people have moved I've got a bomb shot God can I read it here we've been through many things I've been through many things I give God thanks for all of it because all things work together for good for your good to them that love the Lord all things work together for good hallelujah straight from time-tested memorials he says we have arguments come he says you partake with them he says when quarrels come when in difference comes when there's cuts and peaks do you listen to gossip he says oh god let's go back to the furnace we need to blow that out we need to start on the Word of God start on the Word of God praise be to God thank you Jesus a man died man let's go now he says God is going to rapture this great bridge do you believe that he's gonna rapture this bridge praise be to God I want to show you something now judge this is so real it's so real God is real if he says something he means it are you ready for another example he said we all called the story you'll find a warden Revelation chapter 4 brother Branham said there was we called him the meatpackers son and he was looking for a wife and he went there and all the girls were kind of doing their thing but he never wanted them he wanted character and he what he spotted a girl that had character character and he said you are gonna be my wife and he told her I'm gonna marry you I'm gonna marry you in one year from today I'm gonna return you be ready and have the wedding garment on I will return and marry you right on these grounds here praise be to God Amen what's the inspiration today when it comes will he find this girl took him serious she took him serious and he said he told her that I'll marry you and all the sisters went ehehe they were all laughing at her but he said it and she believed it and she made ready and let me tell you his wife has made herself ready let us be glad and rejoice hallelujah God he told me he would marry one year from now I have got an hour left when they love I've got an hour left praise God they said never he's not gonna come back I've got 30 minutes left I've got ten minutes left and they love you and they love you must be crazy you must be crazy suddenly they heard a sound they heard a sound Amen it was the carriers it was coming it was coming it was coming she was standing there with her flowers when he cometh will he find faith yes can we shout yes hallelujah glory to God he's coming and we know it's not gonna be long and we're gonna be leavin here the wife hath made herself ready hallelujah god be praised God be praised hallelujah and she ran into his arms hallelujah oh I feel so happy today just to know these things just to see these things it makes it real just to know that God is here challenges will come that will scare the average man you ready for my last example you ready for my last example every day for 40 days a big ugly giant was taunting Israel and saying Israel send me a man and there was silence there was silence there was silence nobody wanted

and I brought down the bear back I know what my slingshot can do a few weeks later a lion came and their beacon but Davis a lion you're finished he took his slingshot and he took out the light what the table have time-tested faith [Applause] time-tested faith the finish line wasn't nothing the Bible said David ran to meet him all he did was the same old thing and I tell you your same hallelujahs will bring down every child are your same praise God will bring down the bigger ones and the bigger ones he will bring him down hallelujah god be praised time tested faith amen you just come up close
