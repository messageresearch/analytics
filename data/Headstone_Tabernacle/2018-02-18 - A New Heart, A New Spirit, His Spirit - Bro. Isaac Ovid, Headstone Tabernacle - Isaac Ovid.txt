Thank You musicians you appreciate the worship this morning the appreciate brother Anthony this morning and his message last week god bless you brother Anthony amen amen amen so I greet you this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ is certainly a great privilege to be in the house of the Lord this morning and I'd like to get straight to the word reading three portions of scripture reading from the Book of Ezekiel reading second Corinthians and reading from the book of Revelation reading Ezekiel 36 second Corinthians five and revelation three ezekiel 36 and from verse 22 ezekiel 36 and from verse 22 therefore say unto the house of israel thus saith the lord god i do not this for your sakes a house of israel but for mine holy namesake which he have profaned among the heathen with a you went and i will sanctify my great name which was profaned among the heathen which ye have profaned in the midst of them and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord sayeth the Lord God when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes for I will take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and he shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them reading 2nd Corinthians 5 and reading verse 17 second Corinthians 5 and verse 17 therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new I read in Revelation 3 and reading from verse 14 revelation 3 and verse 14 and unto the Angel of the Church of the Laodiceans write these things saith the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou wert cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because they'll see as I am rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint our eyes with eyesalve that thou me as sea as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock and If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches me the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated so are you happy to be in a house of the Lord this morning amen to have the blessed privilege to gather around the Word of God and you know I really caught a burden this morning because a lot of people are going through a lot of stuff but the Branham preached a message one time why are people so tossed about and the struggles of life and problems of life and the situation's of life you cannot just say ignore it because you have to face it you have to confront it you have to confront the issues of life confront the challenges of life the problem is that this journey of Christianity I'm not calling it the journey of the message I'm calling it a journey of Christianity that has a very specific goal to be like Jesus not to be like other Christians but to be like Jesus not to be in the form of what church defines as church but there is a standard and the standard is to be like Jesus and as you situation that we find ourselves in today and every day that it is not going to get easier it is going to get more challenging there will be more pressure there will be more hurdles there will be more obstacles and as David had to encourage himself in the Lord we are challenged to encourage ourselves not in what the world has to offer but encourage ourselves in the Lord so I have a title this morning because in preparing to speak this morning I I always find myself really looking to see what does God want to see it is easy one time years ago I heard a story of a preacher and he was about to preach and he said you know I had this message and then when I came to the pulpit the Lord gave me another message and I heard somebody say well the first one you got was not from the Lord because his message came when you got there so it's very easy to intellectualize the message people pull quotes and scriptures and they have their own interpretation and if you read the Laodicean Church age but the Branham says the Baptist's believe they have the word the Pentecostals believe they have the word and you can't tell them that they don't have the word so so who is right and he says that coming down to the fruit of it it really is only one equal sign that's the life it is not what we profess is what you possess it's one thing for us to be identified with him it's another thing completely where he identifies with us it's easy to say I know him but does he say I know you your testimony as a Christian becomes something when both heaven and hell recognizes you I'll say that one more time your testimony as a Christian becomes something else when both heaven and hell recognizes you because when the sons of sceva went to cast out Devils those demons said Peter I know Paul I know what is your name I've never heard of you before so real Christianity means the devil must have you on his watch list because you are defying his order his system so if you are not on his watch list you are not working hard enough to be a rebel as it were in this that we are living in because this belongs to us and due to the feelings of our brother Adam we lost what belong to us but God has been building up a resistance movement from since the book of Genesis which sons of God who have been sleeper agents working under the cover of darkness with the greatest cover be in the seventh seal to not under there beyond the eyes of the devil would be a people rising up under their messenger can be the final voice to the final age with a voice of such power and authority that the devil has to let go not just of your party he has to let go of the atmosphere he has to let go of the earth because we shall reign on the earth and we and the devil will not coexist we are not taking prisoners we are not forming a treaty we are not signing an agreement he has got to go oh you know here it is morning he has got so cold that cancer got to go we are not trying to figure out how to live with it that's not the solution we are not preaching pain management we are not preaching taking the medication we have got to let that Devil know he has got to go do we have any Christians in the house this morning do we have any believers in the house this morning do we have any sons of God in the house this morning do we have any stalkers of God in the house this morning I'm the church semen that's only 60% can the church say Amen oh that's getting a little warmer I'm the church semen you maybe see them if you are sick this morning your healing is not being by revelation your healing is not based on knowledge your healing is peace and only one thing the merit of your feet your faith in Jesus Christ that's why people came to the prophets meetings knew nothing quad feet and walk out healed can the church say man your feet has nothing to do with your mistakes your feet has nothing to do with what happened yesterday when you woke up this morning and you took your car keys and you put it in the ignition and you turn the car you had an expectation that that power is gonna stop in fact you'd have been shocked if it did not start because your feet declare that when you do that action there should be an opposite reaction you don't hear me destroy your car didn't ask what happen yesterday that car did not see you got paid you just turn the ignition and the response is supposed to happen that's the simplest form of faith when when you come to the house of God you can put your feet into action when you put the key into the ignition and see it by your stripes I am healed or you don't hear me this morning I'm here to preach you happy you have to make the revival it's got to be in your heart it's got to be in your house it's got to be in your life it's got to be in your walk-up it's got to be in your talk you gotta shake yourself [Applause] hallelujah you may be seated I'm here this morning I'm not feeling too well but I'm here this morning my body is weary but I'm here this morning because I'm not gonna let the devil move one more inch I've drawn a line in the sand and say Satan you can go no further your only movement is to retreat because the pride of Jesus Christ is moving forward we might move slowly but we are moving we might be tired but we are moving no everywhere but we are moving we might be sick but we are moving we might take a long time what we are moving brother Anthony please last week the race is not for the swifter the race is not for the strong the race is not for the big people but the race is about consistency every day with Jesus sweeter than the day before every day with Jesus I love him more and more I might fall back a little bit I my black side a little bit up but the race is not for the Swift I can keep on moving I made a mistake yesterday what time God the race is not for the Swift and they have lost my joy but thank God the race is not for the Swift halleluyah halleluyah I may have gray hairs but the race is not for the swift because once I make it to the finish line this gray hair has got to reverse itself if I can just make it to the finish line yes a brightness has got to go if I could just make it halleluyah halleluyah [Applause] I don't care if you're moving like a snail just keep on moving if this is your piece just keep on moving it might look as if nothing is happening but keep on moving don't stop don't stop turn to your neighbor tell them don't stop [Applause] [Applause] you may be seated [Applause] giving up it's not in my vocabulary turning back it's nothing my vocabulary listen the word retreat it's not enough vocabulary the best-case scenario if you don't feel like moving forward is stand still and see the salvation of the Lord that's that's the that's the mostly way you're gonna get this morning if you can't move just stand still and see the salvation of the Lord because the battle is not ours it is the Lord's so if you are tired of swollen day that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength stand still and see the salvation of God in your house in your life in your family in your marriage in your business in your children it's yours it's yours to keep it's yourself choir it's yours to get up it's your time it's your season it's your hour it's bright time it's C time it's Adoption time it's manifestation time you may be seated [Applause] everybody feeling fine so I have a title this morning a new heart a new spirit his spirit I'll see it again a new heart a new spirit his spirit I'll see it again a new heart a new spirit and his spirit the Bible speaks of a process a process something that unfolds itself something that has to happen and even when were the Brandon brought out Jesus's first miracle he said that when Jesus turned the water into wine he said that Jesus bypassed the process but the bypass was a complex bypass because we're Branham said the water would have eventually met with grapes the grapes would have been fermented it would have been aged but Jesus bypassed the process by speeding up the whole thing and brought it not just to wine but the wine was [Applause] the wine came each where the currents as if it had been made years ago talk about bypassing the process all right but it is a process that takes you from where you start the way you are supposed to finished so when the brandman brought it out he said listen I'll give you a new heart I'm not gonna really cause a little trouble I don't leave you a new heart because the heart that you have it's not compatible with the nature and things of God the heart that you are born with the nature of that heart is evil and God is not evil so you cannot speak the same language before you can talk about spirit you have to deal with the issues of the heart [Applause] and out of the heart comes all the issues of life the Bible says as a man thinketh in his heart so is he or so he is so is he here mapped out a trajectory to get you from your fallen condition which was not your fault so you cannot take blame for your starting position what your father did what your mother did what you cannot take blame for how you were born you can however take blame and responsibility for where you end up anybody who judges you and where you start is a fool because you have no control over where you started but it is an expectation as a Christian with where you finish and brother Anthony brought it here last week about this race and it's raised or journey of life from start to finish every man of God has had to run a race as great as me I have run derbys finish my course [Applause] and that should be our goal to have that same kind of testimony that we did not wash our hands can I just talk a little bit I don't have the strength to preach so I'll just talk a little bit I love studying the Scriptures and it's the foundation of many promise in the message because people don't study the Scriptures but just to drop this one off before I continue when Jesus was arrested he was taken to Anna's first was the retired high priest after Anna's he was taking the Caiaphas who was the reigning or current high priests and it was just like past adornment to Hera to Pilate and and when Pilate came to the point that he had Jesus in front of him the Bible said he was astonished that all the accusation that came to Jesus Jesus did not say a word now it is confusing because if you are innocent you would be declaring your liberty and your freedom and your innocence with all that you have and if you are guilty even the guilty people have a problem acknowledging their guilt so Jesus was an anomaly to Pilate till he could rationalize what it was and Pilate said you know what I'm gonna wash my hands of this whole situation in other words Pilate said I'm not going to make a decision on this I'm gonna have the people make a decision but pilots decision to not make a decision was also a decision pilot decided to not make a decision and he washed his hands you can't control how you start the journey but the Branham said he was born in a poorhouse his father was a drunkard that's how he started growing up he would have been called a son of a drunkard he didn't have a great education that was as a result of how he started but how did he finish the race is not for the swift it's how you finish the race so we are born in sin we are shaped in iniquity we come into the world speaking lies God said I am holy then I hate sin our very nature is sinful our desires are sinful our very best effort is still sinful [Applause] your own efforts and righteousness is filthy rags the Bible says so any manner of encountered quality angel of God recognized his nature his feelings his problems so it's impossible for me to understand the self righteousness in the message but more so in the church but it's a spirit it's a Laodicean spirit that's why I read the scripture blind wretched miserable naked and don't even know it have need of nothing and there's been no change of heart far less to reach a new spirit we're gonna get it I get to read the quotes brother Branham brought out a new heart and he spoke of that new heart as your appetite to something you ever heard the statement it's an acquired taste how you can eat that type of seafood is it's an acquired taste and people are self uses that because it expensive it isn't good and it isn't horrible but because this measure I have an acquired taste for it but it means your appetite has been introduced there's something new something different something I've never had before so I want you to understand that porn and sincerity lying is all you know deception but it'll suddenly get a new half and your appetite has been introduced to a new kind of love a new kind of goodness or a new kind of Mercia something called grace something called favor aha Trane's frantic pleas that you can now begin to enjoy the fragrance coming from the Rose of Sharon honor and appreciate the beauty of the lily of the valley because we for your heart exchange you you can see the beauty of his majesty you can relate to it you can come to church and sit in church but you can understand the joy of the Lord unless your appetite has been introduced to the [Applause] not because somebody's in church it means their heart has been changed not because they all know the message or in the message means their heart has been changed it could be working with the same old engine because if the devil could believe and tremble and if the devil could sit in church every Sunday because you know he he can't miss church you know it's against his nature to miss church because he was a chief worshiper so he has to go somewhere it makes no sense he stays home so he finds himself he already has the world he's not operating in the bar or the club he has those people so he has to find his way into our building this morning to try to cause confusion and cause back an island and stab gossip and rumors people in church with the sium all engine same heart nice behavior same heart you know but the balance and the devil can impersonate any kind of a gift [Applause] and the devil could do everything except greed so even within the context of the virtues but the Branham said there's a difference between godly virtues and your own ups are you guys real patient you will get pay for two months you patient thank you nice days there is not a patient of God as your natural disposition you eaten taxi pass and you eaten people go in and wash and you let sweet in you you know rushing for nothing you rest patient that is different God's patience there are people with knowledge the rest read and they read and intellectual knowledge you said with a theologian they have more knowledge and people you will meet is that acknowledged of God there people are just forgiven you see people who did an or and if you forgive everybody love everybody and they connect into principles but that's not the brotherly kindness or the forgiveness of God but we're talking about a change in your heart so that you are no longer a pig but no you are alum and whenever Adam said after your heart is changed I'm gonna give you a new spirit I'm gonna Baron taught us and he taught us very well that that new spirit is not the Holy Spirit he said that new spirit and he placed examples he said because with your own spirit if I even get along with your wife hmm with that old spirit if I get along with your neighbor with that old spirit I can't get along with your boss and then he qualifies it far less how will you get along with God so that new spirit is like speaking the same computer language she's like a new heart I give you a new computer but the operating system cannot talk to God it's like you have Mac and God is PC simplistic example so you're operating on your wrong OS you have the wrong operating system so when you have a new spirit no you could actually talk the language of God because his language is not our language his thoughts are not our thoughts his ways are not our ways as the heavens are higher than the earth so are his thoughts and his ways higher than always but brother Branham said when you get that new spirit it makes you a different person you feel a new peace you feel a new joy yeah you're not ease the anointing it's different for you you have a really a car way to come and church but that still naughty holy goes a new heart a new spirit and then the promises out put my spirit and when his spirit is in you now now you are new creation because it's no longer your thoughts it's no longer your ideas it's no longer your interpretation he sits in the control tower of your heart and you can go anywhere unless he lets you go you can't say anything unless he lets use is there anybody this morning wants to be transformed can the church say man now I wanna strike a bit of something because you can only bring an antidote when you understand the problem you can only vaccinate if you know what the diseases or the virus or bacteria or whatever is the proper Tillman's so in the Laodicean Church age which is define as the last age but the brand came as a messenger to this age we read the scripture I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I what that dog would call or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou says I am rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire no but the Branham goes on to say and I want you to ride with me this morning because you have to understand what you are fighting for and understand why this transforming power of God is so important and why you need to be desperate to be changed and why he to meet the conditions of God to be changed and why you need to fight for all that's within you because the kingdom suffered violence and the violent take it by force and even though God gave Abraham a promise that the people of God would be delivered from Egypt he was only responding when they cried out to him and by the Branum said if you don't cry God will not respond because as a baby cries out for milk so too we as babes in Christ have to cry out for something more but the problem is there's a spirit of contentment little spirit of comfort there's a comfort in the thought that I'm in the message I'm in the inspiration I have books I have tips I'm in the church I'm in this church I go to this convention I pray and he said I've considered all of your words and God's conclusion is you're not hot and you're not cold you look warm lukewarm as that state of being in the middle because of your heart you are a hundred percent about the things of God and the business of God he said I rather you're 100 percent or you're zero but you see the in between the inbetweeners coming to church with no life coming to church with no effort you're reading books you know but you're not applying it to your life you're not meditating you're in one day you're out one day one day assaulted in exit you're fighting one day you live we will write with your family the other day they're not sure you're saved and you yourself say is only because I'm a Christian the fact it is Hannah you said are out of your Hut or are you cool I rather give you all or no butter to give nothing at all god help us this morning no more standing in the middle no more standing with one foot trying to having one foot in the kingdom and one foot in the world friends it's the worst place to be when you're caught in the middle when you're caught in the balance that's why people say I'm a lukewarm and I am feel anything right now that's that's why because it takes a decision to go 100% it takes a decision to say I'm gonna pray I'm gonna stop talking to this one because they are not going where I'm going it's okay to do that it's okay to say no it's okay to say this is not right the Spirit of Christ is what led Jesus to the temple to beat the money changers out well how Jesus could move so the zeal of my father's had eaten me up lukewarm in the message sitting down listening to tapes and no joy no excitement no fire no zeal I'm really proud I'm said it and but the random would get tired because you say when you go to a ball game if you want a Phoenix proceeded game nobody considered in a ball game who's a real sports fan and I could understand even as a sports fan but if you have sports man on your team plane and your team score cool you have a reaction and it's an involuntary reaction of people who does be prim and proper there's neither to stuff stand up on top a cheer me like Picasso sorry I you realize I reached up here how did that happen because in the spirit of that thing I'm Cora saying if you're ready crazy about me if you already love me if you if you're ready about this thing there should be an involuntary reaction where you are worrying about who's next to you who beside you what will happen to your clothes your shoes if you're here go flying in that direction just matter to you because that [Applause] listen to the Prophet I was a nail this down because I don't want to be cold I don't want to be lukewarm I don't know about you because coal means judgment you finished it beat means I finished and in the middle it means spewed out of his mouth those options are not for me friends and they should not be considered by you you should be on fire for God every day you should be on fire for God where they have no money and fire for God when everything going wrong on fire for God I didn't say though he slay me yet still I trust him here do I walk to the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil that should be your attitude all day every day every day on fire the Lord had cheated me so I get around the licks but he has time giving me over the debt he gonna kill me but I'm still alive I'm still on fire [Applause] you may be seated but when Isaac you don't know how much struggles and how much fight I guess in my fight is real fight so you think you are the only one you want me to tell you my fight if I tell you my fight we wanna see little drawings a guy Ricard enjoyed insane lawyer these are stones hitting me and knocking over and somebody joy savory Lord holding some huge ball and you say listen I try to haul up these things I'm a sinner easy small ones because the Bible said God will not give you more than you could be so you are trials it's as if it goes retailer or the seamstress and you will measured for your trial your child is a perfect fit for you later so wear it with a smile it's a perfect fit whatever you go into right now is a perfect fit God designed it to develop your character come on somebody pitch back to me you may be seated God gave Moses a hot tempered wife by design and he had to wear it but the Branham in the middle of his trial he whipped he cried he tried to commit suicide and when it was all over and he looked back to time he said he was just testing me it is impossible to see that in the middle of the test but when you get through it you can look back and see it was a perfect fit because if it have not been for that situation have not been for that problem have not been for that trial have not been for that test had been for the haters have not been for the stalkers have not been for the gossip had not you would not be here this morning something brought you to the house of God this morning can the church see men I'm not I'm not preaching this morning I'm just talking a little bit just to put things into context so stop complaining it is well no more complaining no more worrying no more no it's the attitude keep your eyes focused on the finish line keep your eyes on the target there's a reason that put blinders on the horses your race is not against somebody else you know your race is between you and the line I tell young people all the time do not compare yourself with anybody else if your potential is to be a B+ student do not give me a B if your potential is to be a B+ student in physics do not give me a B give me a B+ good that's your potential you might be stronger in mathematics and that is the air don't give me a B+ I want an A because that is your potential it is not about anybody else God is not calling groups he's calling individuals and his selection of you is beasts and his knowledge of you because we for knew he called so he's not calling people that he don't know the problems and he don't know your issues he don't know you is with the knowledge of your issues that's why he called you because he realized that your issues is not too much to be a factor to deny your access into the heavenlies the accumulation of your failures would not be enough to deny your place in the kingdom of God when you look at your report card from your birth to where you are today he said not guilty not guilty I'm not stumbled and nut butter I love him still I love her still she gonna make it you're gonna overcome i watch when you fall but I know you're gonna get back up that's my boy get back up again if tests don't make you happy I don't know what will this oughta make a black slider say there's hope for me there's a possibility he may be seated that's what Sampson saw he saw the possibility I said to the young people who came up with the lights Thomas Edison Thomas Edison invented the lights and he had in his heart I am tired with Flambeau I am tired with candle I am tired light in flames there has to be an easier way that I could touch something and see like come on now on his journey to figure in this thing out he filled so many times and when you had a conversation with him he couldn't say every time I feel I learned another way of how not to do it and that ability of trying again is one of the critical aspects to your Christian journey yesterday was a rough day but I'm here this morning cause I want to try again every time the Sun Goes Down comes back up it's a reminder that there's a room for you to try again try again try again because you're finishing testimony is your gonna make it but girls I'm gonna tell you every step of the way of how you're gonna make it you have to figure it out the Bible says work out your salvation God not working it out for you you work out your salvation with the antrum M'Lynn you will come at the church for the ministry to work out your salvation you have to pray you have to fast you have to side you have to cry you have to give up the world you have to separate yourself from unbelief you have to trawl the television you have to give up sports whatever it is whatever it is that's holding you black you ever see that people wanted Deacon to get on my timetable ever but God don't want it by ruse you might have to call every morning but uh burn a nickel you you pray it when I go at seven o'clock you haven't prayed but but magician you ready Bible today so I'm supposed to call you every day and hold you accountable brother I'm trying to fight to work out my own salvation and that must be your desire Lord I want to be ready as for me and my house you parents in the church the best you can do is point your children the right way free for them and don't worry about it because getting stressed and worried will not solve anything do your very best as the scripture said train up a child in the way they should go and when they get older they will not depart from it you do your very best effort because God knows you may not have all the tools it take to be the number one father or number one mother but God place them in your care and the ability that you have cannot be compared with anybody else you try your best and pray and pray and pray and leave it up to God [Applause] and live a life that they can see Wow that's how I want to be when I grow up listen we don't need more talk we need more for life that's why Jesus astonished to people because was just as what it was a life he confused them when the woman came in with the alabaster box Oh wiped his feet they're talking about ourselves if he only knew who that woman is he win him a letter how many room father's touch him and Jesus disorders he said you guys let me comment here and you guys embarrass me by not even washing my feet but this woman this woman who are we to judge anybody who we just said this one can't make it this one not going to make it look at Paul Paul was not just a murderer you know Paul was going after Christians those brothers in Jerusalem had a serious problem at all the Bible said it they had trouble with Paul even he was he was preaching and converting them but it had a fight with Paul how do you explain the mind of Christ because God is sovereign he does not need your permission or my permission and he's no respecter of persons His grace is sufficient for you it is sufficient for me his love is sufficient for you it is sufficient for me but this is such a simple message this morning but people have simple problems tying them up people know books and tapes and can't lift their hand or worship because they weigh down we're done by what he said my yoke is easy my burden is light what's weighing you down this morning he said pass all of your cares upon him what's weighing you down this morning that you can't show [Applause] [Music] and if you are sitting here this morning with unconfessed sin then don't you leave this building this morning without coming to the elders coming to the pastor and getting it prayed for because whatever heaviness you're going through God didn't design you for that he said he hated seeing people in bondage but at Branham said the world's the most horrible sight to see an eagle cage is he a bird cage up to see anything he'd jump the co-winner builds for captivity that's why when Jesus read from Isaiah he spirit of the lord is upon me for he has anointed me to bring liberty to the captives what bondage Watson me today be the day you break free forever break out forever free pass forever drop it forever drop the weight of sin drop the weight of guilt you have odds against anybody this morning drop it today it's too heavy to carry it's holding you down the rapture is coming and we're gonna be light enough to go into the rapture we're not taking the world with us we're not taking a pain with us we're not taking our sin is got to go can the church seamen I haven't I'm actually still on page five of page five of 64 looking frightened but is the fun sighs I'm a page five of 64 but I'm trying to address the conditions that exist that requires the Holy Ghost to be the antidote because I saw a promise because our intellect not the antidote knowledge is not the antidote your consistency in church is not the antidote those are means an end the end result they're people who go to school for five years and attendance one point sports on point PE on point and after five years the end result is they did not get a pass it is sad but it is true I attended every class and never was late except students when the school never late for failures that no passes why people come into church and by the banham I'm going to it's not even about the wood it's about the life because the world is supposed to produce the life and the fruit of the life is the fruits of the spirit so all of your years in the message it's supposed to create a certain pattern of behavior that is supposed to be so much like rice that people can't tell the difference between you and Jesus [Applause] listen friends when the Prophet was here people saw Jesus that is started to see that's that's Jesus because his life his life thundered I hope I get to the code brother branham said if your life is not affecting anybody you need to look at your life again whose life have you affected when people look at you can they say that's a real Christian that's a real Christian man that's a real Christian woman I said I'm not preaching this morning this is a conversation on your job they could know who are the Christians if your name is not fully something is wrong because that's a thunder that shakes the devil so you have to know where you fall this morning no heart no spirit his spirit and if you don't have the Holy Ghost you don't have to worry spirit that should be your burning desire but the Branham said that was the theme of every apostle was only one message I preached have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed I believe I'm speaking to believers this morning but it's a supernatural element that still remains you need some power in your life and by the pound said the holy ghost comes to give you power power to pray power to speak power to live a holy life he said take a woman there can get the prayer answers given a Holy Ghost wash her prayers get answered that's what the Holy Ghost is given for KO hallelujah so can we continue of it we tourmaline Laodicean Church each and its effects today but the madam said this lukewarmness demands a penalty from God and the penalty is that they will be spewed out of his mouth and by the balance said here is where we don't want to go astray so but the madam wants to horn on on what that actually means hot coral or lukewarm he said this verse is not given to an individual it is given to the church she is talking to the church furthermore if you were just keep the word in mind listen to the Prophet you will recall that nowhere does it say that we are in the mouth of God we are in creating his palms we are carried in his bosom we're back in the unknown ages before time we were in his mind we are in his sheepfold and in his past years but never in his mouth so what is in the mouth of the Lord the prophet has he said the word is in his mouth and the word is supposed to be in our mouths - that's where the Prophet says I'm gonna Brendan go so now we know that the church is his body it is here taking his place so what would be an amount of the church to it so they see seven and then what is wrong with these people of the last day he said they have gotten away from the word they are no longer fervent about it they are lukewarm about it but what has happened to the world the Prophet said the world has been put aside so God says I'm gonna I'm going against you all I will spew you out of my mouth this is the end for seven out of seven ages I have seen nothing but men and steaming their own word above mine so at the end of this age I am spewing you out of my mouth it is all over I am going to speak alright yes I am here in the midst of the church the 'man of God faithful and true will reveal himself and it will be by my prophet oh yes that is so sober the venom goes on he's envious I want you listen carefully now he is sending a vindicated prophet he is sending a prophet after almost 2000 years he is sending someone who is so far from organization education and the world a religion that has John the Baptist and Elijah of all he will hear only from God and he will have dust seer the Lord and speak for God he singular will because mouthpiece and he as it is declared in Malachi 4 6 within the hearts of the children back to the father's and this is my friends it is so important for you to recognize your day and your message only one office is qualified as the mouthpiece of God and that's the prophetic order and but the Branham said here for 2000 years there was no prophet like this prophet and I was sharing by the oven in the office when I said when Jesus was here there's only one name he singled out you know in speak enough to come because the disciples came said Jesus why do the scribe see that the Elias must risk oh Jesus didn't reference Paul's to come or any other name he said yes truly Elias must come and restore all things so when Cesar was walking he was thinking of our D and if a great prophet s will come that is in a different category altogether different from Moses different from Abraham different from Tevan different from Paul different Iranians for all time because the magnitude of Jesus's ministry on earth was so powerful you were wondering where does this elias fitting because it's sort of greatness of jesus's ministry in front of the eyes but why the scribes keep talking about your lions must first come he said yes truly you must come and even after I'm gone there's a restoration to take place he will restore all things you know bless we are to be in this age with a profit this kind of profit not the ordinary profit this is the one you maybe see that Jesus it will restore all things reveal the mystery of the seven thunders tie up all the loose ends call up people and because of him there will be a people who will be the final voice to the final age for the first time because things are restored there will be a people who will pray I'm not even up to use in Jesus name because his name will be in her her authority as the bride will rest on him she will be one when she speaks whatever she says is backed up because she has signing privileges to the economy of God and could dispatch at a moment's notice whatever need you desire if you shall say to this mountain be moved ask what you will happy right I give you your two boys that is a sign of a people who will speak like that glory to God can the church gives a lot of shouter praise [Music] hallelujah may be seated so Jesus himself knew there's a waiting period because it's battle that started in heaven didn't started it started in heaven had to come to an end because the battle had a beginning and every part of her seven-inning anything that had a beginning has to have an inning the Angels had a beginning so ethos in those keys have an ending because the devil has promised lake of fire but before the beginning before the dawn of creation there was some attributes that a part of God who have no beginning because they were always part of God he existed in his thinking and forever tied to him and that is what gives us confidence this morning because in Joe's valley of darkness God chose to remind you that's your beginning on earth is tighter and eternal eternity where you have no beginning so where was our job when I need a foundation of it and the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy Joe I know it's hard to remember in the midst of your child but even it is John your spiritual memory you come from another place you come from another dispensation and the reason you are here is to prove that you can make it that's the reason you are here I could have sent anybody but I chose to send you to prove to the devil that in his Eden in Satan's Eden Satan made the mistake of coming into God's Eden so caught waited until the iniquity of the amorite shuffle until Shem is at its highest until they are Ashiya has taken over until it was almost blacked out except for our prophet to put the sliver of light to see arise and shine because you are my people and I will restore all the years that the tangka womb and the caterpillar and the locusts and the Palmer womb [Applause] curry can we take some more my voice little pressure but this is good food this morning this is what it'll warm up with him five still on page five cuz I reading from the seven churches someone knows they're still on page five mama knows George one of these deals will have a silver that will never end and the tempers no boss no your thing using your boss disturb the kingdom you take the government can stop making longer if they need to call tomorrow holiday nationally tonight to make sure you get sleep it'll be a national holiday if God sees you whole law to make sure Mary get to bed level you know how much factors have to come together for Jesus be born in Bethlehem they're changing taxes yeah they had to make your roads they had to census the people they had to be able to verify what city are you from what tribe are you from you want government involved with one purpose little Mary on the donkey taking our time had another Bethlehem because the prophecy pleased him being born there and there's a prophecy that identifies your time your place your season your victory your anointing and the prophecy of God can never be defeated [Applause] hallelujah whoo [Applause] the problem today people look at the world as a history looking but if you see the Sun noting as a present tense thing as a living book this book is the life is you only book that's a life this book always was this book always will be what was said in the before present future is all one because he's eternal he is Alpha Omega beginning and same yesterday today and forever no matter how inside of here I am sure when Isaiah was speaking the Spirit of the Lord is upon me for he has anointed me those who were here that word for that day failure knowing to come and offer those words it was real in that day but when Jesus came it was also present tense it was spoken in prophecy but it was in present tense also because in the economy of God there's no measure of time this time thing is the chappy devil when he was kicked out of eternity and trapped in time so we can beat him up in time before we return back to eternity don't tell me how much time the doctor give you doctor can talk about time time is subject our feet we are eternal creatures come from the earth day the day that has no beginning has no ending you may be seated it is that revelation of the difference between time and eternity that could allow you to say let the weak say I am strong because it takes you from your current situation for your eternal position in eternity you are strong it may take time to bring it a manifestation but because there's no construct of time and eternity you can count the things as not as though they were [Applause] somebody's getting it it's because of this confusion between time and eternity you can thank him in advance that woman with the dead son who was right into the Prophet Elisha her boy was dead but as she was writing this is what's going on all as well she was not in time she was riding in eternity it takes a revelation to discern the difference between time and eternity because brother Branham taught us eternity is another dimension it's right around us you don't hear me respond it it's right here right now he said you can't see the TV waves with your eyes you can't see the radio waves with your eyes but they are here right now listen you may be seated we're going somewhere don't worry they got food afterwards be seated be comfortable we're gonna be here for a while one of the curses of the Laodicean Church age is blind and don't know it it takes the Holy Ghost to lift the blindness to see what the natural eyes cannot see so when Elijah woke up that morning when the king of Syria did the Commission of Inquiry he revisited to find out how the children of Israel always know the Platteville plans every time the king of syria finish a meeting and see we go in here israel already know they performed a whole commission of inquiry did you spy for us did you talk to the israelites listen nobody boss we all leave the room yet when the investigator said as a man is a prophet in a land whose name is Elijah and he sees what going on in a bedroom he see what going on in a living room he see what going on any back of the house [Music] [Applause] you may be seated they say let's go and get him you may be seated you know never it has a penis I have real penis if this man seein what happening in your meetings oh you can see it going again if every time you plan an attack he know you're planning oh you can plan to run catch him you can't catch that kind of a man and noting the devil can never catch you because you come from that class you may be seated so that morning there's nothing like waking up in the morning without a key in the world Eli so cut up Sheena for omelets and Harmon hash browns and toast with rye bread orange juice with coffee grate some nutmeg and cinnamon in the coffee try it you like us he cut up that morning flipping the omelet turning around the sausages meanwhile he's a southern boy Goethe said and sees all the army of Syria he said he Leiter you'll see we're going on Elijah flip it one more time and say Lord Lord this poison Laodicea he is blind open up his blind eyes and when that boy looks again he has been pulled from Laodicea into the bright age he had been pulled from time into eternity yet been perfect want I mentioned to the other dimension he said wait a minute they are more for us than against us and I look in this room this morning they are more for us than against us [Applause] hallelujah give the Lord a shout of praise you are gonna make it you are gonna get the Holy Ghost you are gonna have a revival we are gonna have a revive up there will be a manifestation of those seven thunders they will be living from those little voices that's the panel that'll shake the devil Halloween you maybe seen it for a minute [Applause] fear challenges you to do the unexpected fifth challenges you to go beyond your feeling I am sure that when Joshua and they walked around the walls of Jericho there would have been people who may determine feeling well not everybody have the same physical conditioning but Jesse said when I bit it a shout shout your sword might be not as good as my shout my child might be shorter than your shout but when we get there we shorten because it's a victory shout it takes a break down the walls and I'm looking for a break you in your house in your life in your situation and I'm saying today it's time to shout for your victory it's time to lift your voices please answer me and my house we will serve the Lord I don't care how you feel I don't care with the penis I don't care what went wrong I don't care what happened last night I don't care what went wrong this week I don't care what you lost give the Lord a soda bread [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah let heaven hear it let the devil hear it we have not lost our praise we have not lost our shout we have not lost our worship [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah friends you may be seated for a minute and this is where I say the Bible qualifies many things the Bible said if two shall agree touching anything it places no restriction on the action of two agreeing it's the same principle as God asking is anything too hard for the Lord there are no restrictions with God there are no limitations with God there's no context of distance or time or space before the doctors hand touches my wife the tumor will go down that distance that's action that's biology that's all kind of stuff at the same time that's the God reserving friends if two shall agree but the Branum identified he said listen he said if we can get into one mind and one Accord in five minutes there will be not a sick person in the building I want to challenge you Church some of you have different problems but don't hold back the blessing on somebody because you are on your own tangent in your own pity party [Applause] because the anointing that will come will throw you out the church because God will not restrict the blessing on his people because of your laziness your own pity party there are a lot of Moses's in the church crying and cause it why crying stop the foolishness speak over your situations weak over your problem speak over your deadness and watch it come to life because they are sick people in this house that have to be healed we are fighting all kind of demons inside the church spiritual warfare this morning through your deliverance [Applause] don't you have a Blenheim don't you have love in your heart if not for yourself you said forgive for Christ's sake if not for yourself worship for your brother's sake worshipful your neighbor sink give go - out of there seek and watch the blessings of God so let's try one more time give the Lord a shout of praise [Applause] hallelujah when you worship God you create an atmosphere because he inhabits you may be seated for a minute he inhabits the praises of his people God doesn't live in a physical house you can build a building he's not resident in this physical building but you could construct a spiritual building and the material of that construction is praise so he can inhabit the praises of his people so when you appraise he now has a spiritual tabernacle and you are his temples I'm seeing a lot of stuff this morning so even while you're waiting for him to come into your temple he can inhabit the tabernacle of praises that's above you and he's coming closer closer closer when you praise him he comes closer blind Bartimaeus was on the other street he is a beggar he's blind he's with everybody Jesus is on the next street he said Jesus son of David have mercy on me this he can hear you but his praises his cry his desperation he hit a satellite in heaven and Jesus got the picture there's a boy who needs my help Jesus left the street and brought the whole convention to a bottom Mia's was because he was desperate he was worshiping he was sign he was crying you may be seated he had a choice he can I said Jesus guy hey man he's too far laughter so to load maybe I'm too tired listen they will always be an excuse they will always there'll be always an excuse when it was time for Joshua to cross it why don't we wait until the water

to God you don't need to tell me talk to God tell him because when you're done you're still gonna get the hauling us [Applause] I'm gonna try to find some way to close out this morning I'm still on page five [Music] when the Terri told me after phyllispg last Masuda preach that I didn't finish this one I don't see finishing this one but friends this is the best thing you could do is to serve Him the best decision you could ever make is to serve the Lord with all that's in you the best decision you could ever make it's the surrender all and you know what but around him said he said when you lift your hands it's a sign of surrender you say Lord I surrender Lord I'm tired Lord I surrender my will I surrender my all I surrender my life I surrender my ambitions I surrender my desires I surrender my own strength at surrender at all I'm tired of fighting them I'm giving up this phony total surrender the musicians can get ready I'm gonna try to find a place to close out and we'll see what the Lord will do but I believe that in my heart is striking somebody this morning I just want to read a quote from the Prophet just Italian I title a new heart a new spirit his spirit from a message the Intervale but the Baron said notice you put a new spirit God has to give you a new spirit or you couldn't even get along with him you can't get along with yourself that old devil spirit you had in you so he's got to put a new spirit in you so you can get along with his spirit amen I will put a new spirit in them and I will put my spirit in them he said after he's give you a new spirit that's you don't get it confused with God's Spirit it's not it's your new spirit so you can get along with the Holy Spirit if he ever gives it to you amen cuz you in your condition never get along you can't get along with your wife you can't get along with your husband can't get along with your neighbor how are you ever going to get along with God so he has to give you a new spirit before you can get along with him so he puts a new spirit in you and then he puts his spirit in you gives you a new spirit a new outlook a new feet then he puts his holy spirit in you notice can the church say Amen just a kneeling down hidden life with Christ many people have no spirit God had to give you a new spirit to get along with his spirit some people so mean they can't even get along with themselves let alone with God if he come that's right so doubtful and up and down you hear the Prophet God has to give you a new spirit give you a new nature so you can get along with his spirit when it comes I hope you see it God gives you a new spirit for yourself and then puts his Holy Spirit in there to dwell with you and abide with you last quote on this from a hidden life in Christ he said he'd give you a new spirit now that spirit isn't God's Spirit that's your spirit God gives you a new spirit then he says I'll put my spirit in him but the thing is God has to do is give you a new spirit make your nature a little more gentle and settle down or he couldn't live with you so yes to get you fixed up first before he can come in I'll give you a new spirit then you could take him anywhere oh my you could go all kinds of places he's got to get you fixed so you can entertain him right the church say man you love the Lord this morning you could be gonna play something softly as I get ready to close out this morning friends friends we talk about the transforming power of God to turn you from a woman to a butterfly to turn you from your nature into a nature that he could step in but he could fill you not just a part of you but fill all of you I love speaking about Peter because from my own personal testimony I I see my life in Peter Peter wasn't always a strong Christian Peter had his moments of reluctance yet his moment of bravery he had his moments of doubt yet his moments of weaknesses he had moments of frustration after three and a half years with Jesus his best response after hearing the Sermon on the mountain was the chirp of a man is this was not at the beginning of the three and a half years this is Jesus about to be crucified it goes to show that hearing the word doesn't change your behavior it takes something more than hearing the world to change your behavior it takes a spiritual experience with God with the Holy Ghost itself to change what's on the inside his mind had been opened up he had caught revelation who do men say I am tower the Christ that same Peter this experience was before he chopped the guy years off [Music] in fact in Matthew 16 when Peter got his greatest revelation a couple verses later Jesus wings on pizza and says get thee behind me Satan because Pizza had gone off the word and told Jesus you shouldn't get crucified you see him pizza so God was taking Peter true a number of experiences to lead him to a destination the Upper Room Jesus had given pizza power to cast out Devils and he said rejoice not because of that but rejoice because your names are in the book because because your names are in the book you have an appointment with the Holy Ghost you might have a new heart you might never know spirit but you still need my spirit Peter you have seen miracles you have heard there's nobody who preach like Jesus I know it's beautiful Jesus didn't preach complicated the kingdom of heaven is like a net cast into the sea the kingdom of heaven is like ten virgins he gives a story of the prodigal son he that's the simplicity of the greatest preacher who ever walked it and Peter was there and he still had his struggles he still had his moments Jesus dealing with the whole crucifixion timeline and busy pizza want you there in that service on the 18th of February yeah I don't know we're talking about [Music] don't you know Jesus want you on the Fahrenheit when it's a pity just shouting my name is Denise out he said I wasn't me Peter I saw you there and five and Peter decided to use some choice language to differentiate because you know Christians don't speak like that but yet still God protects the native pizza for the upper room because God knew that one encounter but the Holy Ghost itself will do more in five minutes than 30 years of sitting out in a church pew that's why I said two weeks ago Pizza needed a personal experience with God and there are different experiences you have a good pizza saw the fish come out when there was no fish Beatle walked in the water those were all experiences that he went through but they still did not compare to when the Holy Ghost drop down into the sockets of his soul [Music] and his spirit was now inside Peter's heart until Peter could no longer control himself though in the book of Acts men and the ninth and Sapphira came he said you ever lied to me you lied to the Holy Ghost because he is controlling hard friends the season is changing and I don't want you to be guilty of the Laodicean spirit where you comfortable you are ease in Zion but really you're miserable and naked and blind and don't even know it having a form of godliness but denying the power the power of the Holy Ghost makes it a be a day where you can say Lord it's me me in need of a touch me and need of the Holy Ghost me and need of a transformation and wherever you are today maybe you need a new heart maybe you need a new spirit maybe you need his spirit wherever you are this morning say Lord changed me if you need a new heart say Lord I've never met you before [Music] glory me a new heart lord I can't get along with my wife I can't get along with my children lord I need I need a new spirit coz if I can't get along with my wife my brother my sister how could I even get along with you that's what a prophet taught and if you have that new spirit say Lord I need your spirit so I need a Holy Ghost they were in the upper room desperate for Court himself to drop down in the sockets of their souls if there's anything you take away from this service this morning his Lord I can't go on the same way I've been going I need more and by the brand I'm taught us even when you're filled is that the dynamics to this church will be a refilling of what was worked in a smaller measure so we all have something to look forward to this morning we all remember to cry out for this morning friends let's get desperate let's catch a burden for your life catch your burden for your house catch a burden for your children a burden expressed to God will do more for your children I'm talking to them for six days I am Shores as the hockey right have spoken to her boys many times tell her about church tell my mother Lord tell me because she was a believer I remember the Branham told his testimony she could have said that's nothing but the truth [Music] and the Lord told her prophet give her whatever she wants and her burden expressed itself in what she asked for and if God this morning with the grand deepest desires of your heart what is that desire make sure it's a deeply rooted spiritual desire not money not a new job that can be your deepest desire not a raise on a promotion that cannot be your deepest desire not even healing because that'll take care of itself the Holy Ghost is eternal life [Music] it's hard to preach this kind of a service and not give individuals the opportunity to talk to God for a few minutes if you want to come to the altar this morning will pray for you this morning if you are struggling this morning and you are fighting the Laodicean spirit struggling and you can't break free and today is your day to see Lord I
