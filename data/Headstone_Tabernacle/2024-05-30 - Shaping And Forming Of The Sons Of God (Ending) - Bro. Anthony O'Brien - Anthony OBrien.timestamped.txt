[0:00] looks like it's overcast it looks like
[0:02] it's never going to end but if he goes
[0:05] just a little bit further he'll break
[0:07] through he'll break out of the rain and
[0:10] sometimes I feel we need God's
[0:12] perspective tonight to show us that all
[0:15] rain clouds are not going to last
[0:17] forever that our midnight is not going
[0:20] to last forever weeping may endure for a
[0:23] night but the Bible says joy comes in
[0:26] the morning and if you could push
[0:29] tonight if you could press your way
[0:31] tonight just a little bit further beyond
[0:34] the clouds that you are currently seeing
[0:37] you're going to break through into the
[0:39] sunlight oh hallelujah hallelujah I
[0:43] thank God that trouble don't last
[0:47] always amen and amen oh do you love him
[0:51] tonight but it is 100% possible to go
[0:55] off track that's why we have to trust
[0:57] him isn't that right
[1:00] Abraham and Sarah they were promised a
[1:03] son and you know what happened they got
[1:05] anxious Sarah got anxious and they
[1:09] concocted a plan to come up with a son
[1:13] that was not the plan and they ended up
[1:15] with Ishmael isn't that right and uh you
[1:19] know and God had to correct that and
[1:22] bring it back Amen to what he said was
[1:25] going to take place that this promised
[1:27] son Isaac that there would were truly
[1:30] waiting on was the son that was really
[1:33] to come forth by the womb of Sarah yes
[1:36] sir and that's what happens when we try
[1:38] to take things into our own hands when
[1:41] we try to be masters of our own destiny
[1:44] we end up going off track because we
[1:47] don't know the plan we don't have God's
[1:50] perspective and if there's one thing I
[1:52] learned recently is that faith is not
[1:55] having faith in your plan but faith is
[1:58] about having faith in God's plan isn't
[2:01] that right faith is not trusting in what
[2:04] you can do faith is trusting in what God
[2:07] can do faith is not trusting in what you
[2:10] can figure out faith is trusting that
[2:13] God has got it in control and that no
[2:16] matter how cloudy it looks right now no
[2:18] matter how messed up the situation looks
[2:20] right now the god that brought me
[2:23] through is the God is going to work it
[2:25] out oh and when he works it out he does
[2:28] a good job
[2:30] every single time he does a perfect work
[2:34] because he's a perfect God and that's
[2:37] the God we serve tonight isn't that
[2:39] right amen amen amen he has a time he
[2:43] has a place for everything to happen in
[2:45] a specific way and he does it that way
[2:49] why does he do it that way so that you
[2:51] could say it wasn't your education it
[2:54] wasn't your ability that brought you to
[2:56] the spot it wasn't what you could do is
[2:59] what what he has done in your life and
[3:02] anytime you open your mouth you can only
[3:04] give God praise for what he has done in
[3:07] your life oh Hallelujah the car that you
[3:10] drive the house that you live in is only
[3:13] by the grace of God the things that he
[3:16] has given you is only by the grace of
[3:19] God he has
[3:20] constrained your life to his praise
[3:24] tonight that you could only give him
[3:26] praise by the things that he has blessed
[3:28] you with isn't all right he works it out
[3:32] so that you he can get all the glory
[3:34] because it's not about you it's about
[3:37] him this tonight amen I heard a preacher
[3:40] say he said whatever you don't turn over
[3:42] into praise he said it turns over into
[3:47] Pride I'll say that one more time
[3:49] whatever you don't turn over into praise
[3:53] ends up turning into Pride because you
[3:56] begin to get in your head that you made
[3:59] it happen on your own and the truth is
[4:02] you didn't do nothing on your own we
[4:04] didn't wake ourselves up this morning we
[4:07] didn't put breath in our body we didn't
[4:09] make ourselves intelligent that was God
[4:13] that gave us food to eat it was God that
[4:16] provided for us it was God that worked
[4:19] things out and when the bottom fell out
[4:22] and we felt that all hope was gone here
[4:24] come God never late but right on time
[4:29] he's an on time God tonight he'll be on
[4:32] time in your situation he'll be on time
[4:34] in your circumstance oh he's never late
[4:37] tonight it might look like he is but he
[4:40] is working things out on your
[4:43] behalf don't you worry isn't that right
[4:47] I'm getting ready to close oh my there's
[4:49] so much we have here but I feel like the
[4:51] message has got home in some way amen
[4:55] and amen hallelujah isn't that right so
[4:58] when God spoke the willing to ex
[4:59] distance he addressed the darkness first
[5:02] he said let there be light and he pushed
[5:04] back the darkness and then now he now
[5:07] that it was light and he could see he
[5:10] could now address the Earth and all its
[5:13] other conditions so he created the
[5:15] heavens and the the sky and beasts and
[5:19] animals and started forming the Earth
[5:21] and all of that was the forming part of
[5:23] the process but he couldn't do that
[5:25] without light and so too tonight and I
[5:29] like likeness onto having a purpose and
[5:32] to having a vision and these things is
[5:35] what bring light to our circumstance
[5:37] these things is what bring light to our
[5:39] present situation Faith a revelation
[5:42] from God God has to open our eyes to see
[5:47] what he wants from us and when our eyes
[5:49] are truly open and we see ourselves in
[5:52] the reflection of God's vision for us
[5:55] then we could see what needs to happen
[5:58] in order to bring us into shape
[6:00] in order to bring us into form so that
[6:02] we could begin to reflect the father's
[6:05] good work isn't that right he needed to
[6:08] see what he was working with so he said
[6:10] let there be light and there was light
[6:13] and then he began to separate the waters
[6:15] from the heavens and all of that was
[6:17] shaping and forming bringing it into
[6:20] form and then he addressed the void
[6:23] afterwards which was bringing plant life
[6:26] animal life and then he created man In
[6:29] His Image and likeness isn't that right
[6:32] Hallelujah glory to God isn't that right
[6:36] oh my oh so let me get ready to wind on
[6:40] here as much as I
[6:41] can amen but God gives us purpose isn't
[6:44] that right and out of purpose we get
[6:47] vision and then out of vision we could
[6:49] begin to shape or form what it is we're
[6:52] actually trying to do all of us are
[6:55] shaped a certain way
[6:56] tonight shaped a certain way by our
[6:59] experience
[7:00] shaped a certain way by our
[7:02] conversations by things we've seen by
[7:05] things we've heard God had for us to
[7:08] come the way we come so that he could
[7:11] shape us that he could form us he knew
[7:14] by his Divine wisdom what family you
[7:16] would born into he knew what parents you
[7:19] were going to have he knew what kind of
[7:22] home you were going to grow up in
[7:24] because he knew what kind of person he
[7:26] wanted you to be he knew what challenges
[7:29] you would face face but he also know
[7:31] what gift he placed inside of you and by
[7:34] God's grace he's going to let that gift
[7:35] come to light oh Hallelujah by God's
[7:38] grace he's going to bring you into his
[7:40] Perfection and he's going to work on you
[7:43] and work on you it's not a one day
[7:46] Wonder oh but it's every day he's
[7:49] chipping away and cutting away and it's
[7:52] a painful process because we don't like
[7:55] it but we have to go through it in order
[7:58] to be shaped in order to be formed into
[8:01] the word image he has to cut off some of
[8:04] the world cut off some of our desires
[8:07] cut off some of the things that we don't
[8:08] like cut off some of the things that we
[8:11] want cut off some of the things that we
[8:13] desire in order to bring us to his
[8:15] desire in order to bring us to what he
[8:17] wants what he wants in our lives oh what
[8:21] Spirit he wants to abide in us we he
[8:24] can't because he can't use us in the
[8:26] state that we're in he has to get us in
[8:29] shape
[8:30] he has to get us in form isn't that
[8:32] right oh my my my I have a scripture
[8:34] here praise God Amen says if thou has
[8:37] run with the footmen and they have
[8:39] wearied thee then how cast thou contend
[8:42] with horses and in the land of Peace
[8:44] where thou trusteth if they weary thee
[8:47] then how will thou do in the swelling of
[8:49] the Jordan so if you have to run with
[8:52] the footman tonight you have to get fit
[8:55] you have to get in shape you have to get
[8:58] in form you have to get in shape in
[9:01] order to run this race oh Hal because
[9:04] this is a long distance race and in
[9:07] order to run this race you have to be in
[9:10] shape in order to run this race you have
[9:13] to be able to take every day as it comes
[9:16] and every day with Jesus has to be
[9:18] sweeter than the day before and even
[9:21] though you might fall seven times you
[9:23] get up eight times tonight make sure
[9:26] you're getting up outweighs the time you
[9:28] fell down and keep on moving forward
[9:31] tonight because there's a goal Beyond us
[9:35] there is something we are trying to
[9:37] achieve there is a form that God wants
[9:39] to bring us into oh Hal but we have to
[9:42] be willing to subject ourselves to the
[9:45] purpose of shaping and to the purpose of
[9:48] forming isn't that right oh Hallelujah
[9:51] musicians can get ready isn't that right
[9:53] amen they could come isn't that right oh
[9:57] Hallelujah David think of David he had
[10:00] to be shaped isn't that right he had to
[10:03] be formed he had a gift isn't that right
[10:06] and God wanted him to be in a position
[10:09] of leadership but he had to go through
[10:12] stuff he had to be shaped and formed in
[10:14] the wilderness a ruddy young
[10:17] man didn't look like much to look at he
[10:19] was in sheep skins playing a harp but
[10:23] that was God's man and he had certain
[10:25] pictures in his mind because he was a
[10:28] shepherd and then one day when he went
[10:30] out to meet golad he said who is this
[10:32] uncircumcised Philistine that defies the
[10:35] armies of the Living God who is this guy
[10:39] who is this this uncircumcised
[10:41] Philistine you see the the thing was
[10:43] that he had a certain perspective when
[10:45] he looked at Goliad he saw the same
[10:48] situation that he had encountered in the
[10:50] wilderness when a bear came and tried to
[10:53] take one of his sheep he slaughtered
[10:55] that bear with the sling and when a lion
[10:58] came along he slaughtered that lion with
[11:00] the sling and he saw this man this
[11:03] uncircumcised Philistine sent from the
[11:06] camp of the enemy is here to Tower over
[11:09] God's sheep and here they are buckling
[11:11] and cowering in fear and God had a man
[11:14] in the wilderness who was shaped who was
[11:17] formed a certain way his mind was shaped
[11:20] a certain way uh he couldn't rest with
[11:23] that picture it didn't seem right to him
[11:26] that the devil would take advantage of
[11:29] God sheep and tonight it does not rest
[11:31] with us that you would be taken
[11:33] advantage of by the devil and all his
[11:36] tricks we are here to say no we are here
[11:39] to come against the forces of the enemy
[11:42] because our minds have been shaped a
[11:44] certain way we've seen too much how can
[11:47] we help but speak by the things that we
[11:50] have seen and of the things that we have
[11:52] heard oh we can't help but prophesy
[11:55] tonight oh we can't help but tell of the
[11:57] goodness of God we can't help but stand
[12:00] for righteousness we can't help but
[12:02] stand for Holiness we can't help but
[12:04] stand for Purity oh Hallelujah when we
[12:07] see the enemy coming like a flood we
[12:10] know that the word of God somewhere will
[12:14] raise a standard against that enemy and
[12:18] so we cannot back down tonight we will
[12:21] not take no for an answer oh but we will
[12:25] stand upon the word of God and though he
[12:28] slame me
[12:30] yet will I trust him I'll be here on the
[12:34] battlefield fighting for my Lord until
[12:38] he come oh Hallelujah because that's the
[12:41] way we are shaped that's the way we are
[12:43] formed oh we are not children of this
[12:46] world but we are the sons and daughters
[12:49] of God oh H and God has an inheritance
[12:53] for us oh God has a place for us in his
[12:57] kingdom there is power in his kingdom
[13:01] there is anointing in his kingdom there
[13:03] is Glory oh and he wants to get you in
[13:07] shape tonight oh why don't you worship
[13:11] why don't you lift your hands oh
[13:13] Hallelujah getting in the atmosphere
[13:16] getting in the spirit all of that is
[13:19] part of getting in shape getting in form
[13:22] uh because when we get to heaven there's
[13:25] going to be shouting on the Hills of
[13:28] Glory when we get over to the other side
[13:32] there's going to be worship there's
[13:34] going to be rejoicing there's going to
[13:36] be singing there's going to be shouting
[13:39] oh Hallelujah why not get in shape
[13:41] tonight oh begin to practice it right
[13:44] here tonight practice worshiping God
[13:48] practice being in his presence practice
[13:51] that anointing because that is the place
[13:54] that we're going back to tonight oh
[13:57] hallelujah hallelujah
[14:00] formed into his
[14:01] image
[14:04] formed into his glory he could begin to
[14:06] play something
[14:08] softly St John 537 I uh St John 537 I'll
[14:12] close with this you can continue
[14:13] standing you can play something
[14:15] softly Jesus said here he said and the
[14:17] father himself which had sent me had
[14:20] borne witness of me that ye had neither
[14:23] heard his voice at any time nor seen his
[14:26] shape yet ye have not his word abiding
[14:29] in you for whom he had sent him you
[14:32] believe not search the scriptures he
[14:35] says for in them you think you have
[14:37] eternal life but they are they which
[14:39] testify of me isn't that right the truth
[14:43] is we couldn't have Christianity tonight
[14:46] if we didn't have Christen because he
[14:49] came in a shape and a form that we could
[14:52] understand he was mysterious throughout
[14:54] the ages but when he came as Jesus he
[14:58] came as a manifest ation of the very
[15:00] Heart Of God he came in a shape and a
[15:03] form that we could understand he he
[15:05] healed the sick he raised the dead He
[15:09] restored the lepers oh he did things oh
[15:13] all of a sudden in his presence when you
[15:15] are confused things begin to make sense
[15:18] oh Hal because he takes a shape and a
[15:20] form that we could connect with that we
[15:23] know has a has a representation down in
[15:26] the heart oh Hallelujah isn't that right
[15:29] oh Hallelujah Hall isn't that right and
[15:31] we were able to see him and understand
[15:33] him isn't that right praise God is that
[15:36] he was on the example
[15:38] seedson and he was lead and led by
[15:41] example and if he had to pray and how
[15:44] much more do we have to pray tonight and
[15:47] if he stayed long enough in the Garden
[15:49] of Gethsemane to say if not my uh not my
[15:53] will Lord but thy will be done how much
[15:56] more do we have to subject ourselves
[15:58] tonight to the will of God that we could
[16:01] be shaped tonight so tonight as I leave
[16:04] are you prepared tonight to stay long
[16:07] enough to be shaped by God we all shaped
[16:11] and bent in many ways some of us have
[16:14] gone through a lot of things that maybe
[16:16] have affected us negatively God knows
[16:19] all about it he knows all about your
[16:21] shape tonight he knows all about your
[16:24] journey and he wants to form you into
[16:27] His Image tonight he wants wants to do
[16:29] something that you cannot do for
[16:31] yourself he wants to bring you into His
[16:33] Image he wants to bring you into his
[16:36] Sheepfold and sometimes he has might
[16:38] have to break our legs to do it but the
[16:41] master the Good Shepherd is here tonight
[16:44] to tuck us under his arm and carry us
[16:47] home he left the 99 he's going after
[16:51] that one tonight will you be that one
[16:53] tonight that will surrender your heart
[16:55] to him will you be that one tonight that
[16:58] will surrender yourself to him tonight
[17:01] that he could take a hold of our lives
[17:04] and shape us and form us into what he
[17:06] wants us to be may the Lord richly bless
[17:10] you tonight I'm finished oh let's lift
[17:12] our hands let's just give him praise oh
