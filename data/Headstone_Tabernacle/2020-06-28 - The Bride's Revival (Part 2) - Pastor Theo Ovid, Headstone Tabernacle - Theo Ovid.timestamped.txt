[3:13] oh there's a lot of show he couldn't see
[3:21] it because you was the card yet but I
[3:26] could run number Church and run around
[3:28] the church the bride wasn't go yet
[3:31] it takes seven Ponder's to call that
[3:33] bride it takes the voice of God
[3:39] but some points a man function of God to
[3:44] call that brand hallelujah my god is
[3:48] what that's what you waitin for for you
[3:52] to humbly serve in such a place no man I
[3:54] must call senator you know if you are
[3:57] heat instantly or if you are here by
[3:59] degrees so you can be healed instantly
[4:02] or you can be healed by degrees or like
[4:06] Abraham was 25 years whenever the
[4:08] promise
[4:08] instead of getting weak he got stronger
[4:11] hallelujah just remember I go on record
[4:14] I see this with all my heart that is a
[4:16] person here we go we'll take the right
[4:19] mental attitude there was any divine
[4:22] promise of God and it will bring it to
[4:24] pass if you can take that's right
[4:27] attitude I have seen sarcomas cancer
[4:30] leave people by the same thing now this
[4:33] is the part of when I get to maybe you
[4:35] won't be able to receive enough to
[4:37] deliver you all of a sudden but I might
[4:39] say it tonight just closing I want to
[4:41] talk to you a moment and say this if you
[4:44] have time to receive enough faith to be
[4:47] healed instantly then you take the
[4:49] adopted baby route so there is instant
[4:56] healing and there is time of style
[4:58] healing either one you were healed and
[5:05] if your total fear for the instant one
[5:07] take this one they adopt a baby route
[5:10] did you ever hear about adopting a baby
[5:12] if you take a young woman she'd be
[5:13] married she have a husband she's scared
[5:16] she isn't going to have a baby she wants
[5:18] one and the thing that I fear come upon
[5:20] me what you feel happen you take that
[5:22] same woman let her adopt a baby then she
[5:24] have on herself but if you haven't got
[5:26] enough faith to receive it right now as
[5:28] a miracle then take the adopted baby
[5:31] attitude say Lord know what the same
[5:34] it's mine because you're promised it and
[5:37] I call from here tonight
[5:39] praising you just the same as
[5:41] I was well now if we don't say this how
[5:48] you will apply it watch what happens
[5:55] it has to happen oh my or - hit the home
[5:59] stretch here but am I wrong
[6:02] he said no watch all right
[6:05] he said when the spirit begin the fall
[6:07] we got that the word will live in the
[6:10] people now what is very vital for a
[6:13] revival as Cisco quickly it washes all
[6:16] the trash out of the bank so that is why
[6:19] we have a revival to get all the
[6:21] unbelief and things away from us so
[6:23] after what you sit on in church it gets
[6:25] settled you go to work I mean some of us
[6:27] we I had no jobs a little children grow
[6:29] up any message I've told you get married
[6:31] we have children you can occupy before
[6:34] you was married it's fun serving it Lord
[6:36] no you have a wife the Seaboard hardly
[6:37] seen your royal here going there there
[6:39] little one come next one come then
[6:41] there's a whole piece of drama by itself
[6:45] then life becomes picked up but occupied
[6:47] with so much different things especially
[6:50] message here our time to use our cell
[6:54] phone so that we should know what's that
[6:57] no cell phone so we I guess before oh so
[7:06] what are you rather does it gets the
[7:08] unbelief and things out of us see that
[7:12] why what a baptism to get me hot cleanse
[7:14] that is a different operational things
[7:17] water baptism the fire of this little
[7:19] different fighters go beyond deflection
[7:22] singe inside that soul inside there
[7:24] Oh glory to God let's continue we on the
[7:27] homestretch you know what is a revival
[7:29] but a Branham he said I want okay just
[7:33] go away all right technically this he's
[7:37] talking about when you see a servant of
[7:38] God gets oceans here till he's on his
[7:41] face with his hands in the air praying
[7:43] to God and blushing because of the
[7:45] iniquity of the people then you're gonna
[7:47] say if I ever start a man cannot leave
[7:50] and the presence of a church cannot
[7:52] cannot see the presence of God on the
[7:54] repentance unless the Holy Ghost spirit
[7:56] comes there and give function and power
[7:58] for me another Calvin Knox Finney Sankey
[8:01] of any of those who feels the Buddha
[8:03] love the people that will lay on their
[8:04] face and cry and pray before God he says
[8:07] send us another John Smith the Baptist
[8:08] Church again who prayed all night for
[8:10] the iniquity of the people until his
[8:11] eyes are swell shut the next morning
[8:13] from weeping till his wife would lead
[8:15] him to the table and feed him at his
[8:17] breakfast out of a spoon show me a John
[8:20] Wesley again a fireman snatch I will
[8:22] show your revival or Glory the Gauss or
[8:25] if I have a caustic was that it right a
[8:26] price of course it is right let's
[8:29] continue quickly what I want you to
[8:32] understand a revival if it ever studied
[8:36] the issue of revivals a revival
[8:39] signifies a move of God in power say it
[8:44] after me a move of God in power let's
[8:49] say together a revival signifies a move
[8:54] of God in power that's not the posture

[24:11] find the right scriptures to divide it
[24:14] and he divided it he said the
[24:18] acceptability of the law and he stopped
[24:20] in the middle day and read the day of
[24:22] vengeance for endtime bride that will
[24:24] pick up the rest of the scriptures Jesus
[24:27] rightly divide the word and said this
