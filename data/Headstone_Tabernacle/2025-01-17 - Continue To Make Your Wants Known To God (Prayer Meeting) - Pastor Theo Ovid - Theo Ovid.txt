so good to be here tonight let us bow head so with a prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for this great privilege an opportunity to be called of you in this hour we brend gross Darkness cover the Earth Lord distress everywhere Lord you call us to True faith and to walk in the light father May what is to be spoken tonight may it be a ring in the hearts of your children right it in their hearts tonight and the comfort of God come to them and deliverance and healing and restoration and forgiveness in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God bless you and welcome tonight if you have your Bibles I like you to turn to Philippians chapter 4 and the title of what I want to share with you tonight pran is continue to make your Wars known to God and you will see where I get it from and this is Paul Philippians reading from verse 6 and it says here be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God so we could have title it let your request be made known unto God verse S and the peace of God which passed all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds to Christ Jesus finally my brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things those things Paul speaks which you have both learned and received and heard and seeing in me do and the God of Peace shall be with you and our emphasis tonight is this word called peace and I want to bring this same scripture and he Amplified for you and it says do not fret or have any anxiety about anything and you know in a time like this you find people are so anxious and there so much anxiety it brings up on stress it brings on frustrations it brings on misplaced expectation and there's a answer for this in the scriptures do not fret or have anxiety about anything but in every circumstance and in everything by prayer and petition which is definite request with Thanksgiving continue to make your once known to God and that's I get the title from and the God of Peace shall be yours that tranquil state of a soul assured of its salvation through Christ and so fearing nothing from God and being content with its Earthly lot of whatsoever sort it is that peace here we go which transcends all understanding shall Garrison and mount God over your hearts and Minds in Christ Jesus for the rest Brethren whatever is true whatever is worthy of reverence and is Honorable and seemly whatever is just whatever is pure whatever is lovely and lovable whatever is kind and Winsome and gracious if there be any virtue and Excellence if there is any worthy of Praise think on and weigh and take account of these things fix your minds on them so this is the Amplified I'm reading last verse of it is this practice what you have learned and received and heard and seen in me and model your way of living on it and the God of Peace of untroubled undisturbed wellbeing will be with you I like how Paul described God here the God of Peace So we want to continue to another scripture Isaiah 28 verse 3 and 4 thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is still on thee because he trusted in thee trust the in the Lord forever for in the Lord Jehovah is Everlasting strength and that same scripture the Amplified reads you will guard him and keep him in perfect and constant peace whose mind both its inclination and its character is stayed on you because he commits himself to you leans on you and hopes confidently in you so trust in the Lord permit yourself to him lean on him hope confidently in him forever for the love for the Lord God is Everlasting Rock The Rock of Ages so friends these are some interesting scriptures powerful scriptures and by it you recognize peace this peace from God is part and parcel of this Redemptive rights that we have access to and I want to share something with you struck me this application of the mind is deliberate it's a choice now I'm talking about your mind Sunday we talk about the mind of Christ but we speaking about your mind it's a choice because the Battleground is the human mind Prophet said there is where decisions are made and there is where you see the fruit of your decision and actions the actual fruit and because you are the captain of your ship you are to blame you have to accept responsibility and take action not just looking on and life is just passing by blaming others is a cheap load down excuse It's a reflection of your immaturity refusing to accept responsibility or blame for your actions and your attitudes brother sister tonight who is responsible for your thoughts actions and attitude who is responsible for what you told your children or what you seeded into your children you know I ask that I don't want to stick to this 2 Corinthians 10 3:5 Paul speaks for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty true God to the pulling down of strong now people fight aunt and uncle and family and father and mother and sister and brother and pastor and Deacon and Elder and and all kind of drama and they blame accus point fingers but but brother Bram taught us that we are our greatest enemy he taught us and in a way that we will deal with ourselves now it easy to point fingers at others talk about others say like how H men say I express what men saying but when it come out to you that's a different ball game so when Paul speak our weapons of warfare are not carnal But Mighty true God look what he says there pulling on strongholds casting down imaginations you can't cast down imagination in somebody else that is your mind that is your thoughts casting down imagination and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ so Paul here is talking about actively casting down imagination actively casting down the thoughts that Satan brings to your mind thoughts of doubt and questions because I'll tell you this every thought that come to your mind is not your thoughts some is your thoughts but some the devil could inject thoughts and that's what the prophet said the bird could land in your head but if you encourage that bird long enough and then the bird start have a family and build a nest and then you have a whole bird zoo on your head because you by choice allow that bird to be sitting on your head without sh it away and Blasting it away and throwing it away so the Philippians back to it again do not fret or have any anxiety about anything let me repeat that you who threaten complaining uh uh we just call it yeah yeah everything is a yeah yeah yeah yeah you're going over and over the same story do not fret or have anxiety about anything but in every circumstance and everything by prayer prayer alone no and petition which is definite request petition alone no how God wants this petition with Thanksgiving continue to make your wants known to God now this Thanksgiving we talking about is very important because brother he taught us that when Rebecca was walking the canel and she felt led to do that and he's talking about how it's the type of the church today watering and blessing the same Holy Spirit that's going to lift it up the church here we go that is praising and blessing and watering with Thanksgiving to the Holy Ghost who brought the word to you so in reverence in respect in glory into God for the the word that come to you by the Holy Ghost you give God praise and worship now if you're in a nasty State nasty mood bad M God have no praise to get from that if you're cursing and you're saying the wrong thing and car with a bunch of foolishness God cannot get praise and worship from that so therefore it has to be a heart condition that genuinely comes to this atmosphere of praise and thanksgiving when you begin to realize the the goodness of God the sovereignity of God the grace of God that allow you to see what you see and hear what you hear and know what you know in this hour then you are thankful you see yourself blessed and privileged you're not trying to be complaining and fretful and questioning no you're praising and blessing God he said it this way praising and blessing God watering with Thanksgiving the Holy Ghost was brought the word to you right if it can settl in your heart you in the wheelchair you in the cuts you with heart trouble cancer you in radio land in hospitals wherever you may be here we go if you can receive God's word in your heart and water it with praises and Thanksgiving watch so in other words instead of you fussing with Believers and Brethren and you upset and you hurt and this hurt inside your bones now your your whole burs hurting you your whole Spirit hurting you and you have issues in your mind and that those issues affect you so much that you don't even see your real condition you don't see your wretchedness you don't see your your miserable State you don't see that you're not praising thanking God and it's almost as if God Wast his time calling you but I don't think so I think you must have missed something that you need to go back and look again and see what you missed back there why you are troubled why you are fretful why you are complaining because complaining weakens your faith and the currency of God tonight is not tears is not fears the currency of God is Faith so he's saying if you can receive God's word in your heart here we go and water it with praises and thanks to God for giving it to you it will grow into a tree of whatever seed represents healing salvation whatever it is for that tree with Blossom but you have got to drink no nobody can force you to drink we are bringing water tonight we bringing the wood tonight but you have got to drink then you've got to water it feed it let it go and the more you trust in God watch that word trust if you're in a wheelchair and in the hospital and you are so paralyzed you can't even move but one finger just keep moving that one finger to the glory of God look at what the prophet saying here if you are paralyze and all you could move is one finger say thank you Lord hallelujah Glory one finger moving just keep moving that one finger to the glory of God tomorrow you'll move your hand the next day you'll move your arm and you'll be moving on pretty soon you'll be watering it pushing out growing getting bigger and bigger take God's word it's a seed it's a seed now God gave abam a promise and Abraham listen to some details now we AB and believe God but let's look at some details of this and Abraham let that seed get into his heart the promise and kept watering it with praises and Thanksgiving so now with this understanding you could understand why the scripture wrote it that way he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God are you like that because when you're weak there's no praises to God there is no Thanksgiving and no praises and Thanksgiving coming out your mouth is an expression of your lack of fortitude your lack lack of robustness your lack of strength your lack as a mature Christian trials are normal for Christians testings are normal for Christians uh complaining and baby stuff is part of the journey but that is for the baby's part when I was a child speak like a child understood like a child but but as you grow you have to be able to demonstrate and show your growth and your maturity and your strength in God so here we go again Abraham let that seed get into his heart the promise and kept watering it with praises and thanksgiv to God for the child and waited 25 years but the tree came forth just the same because he watered it with feet so with Abraham listen listen to this church it was a deliberating to water the promises with praises it was deliberate when the Bible says whatever is lovely whatever a good report what think on these things are you thinking on these things it it guides us to actually determine how we choose to think and what we are to think on so we want to look at Isaiah 263 thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusted in thee three things here perfect peace mind stayed because he trusted in deep trust this perfect peace is what the prophet called Shalom God's peace this peace is not dependent upon the circumstance the conditions around you it could be Bleak like Daniel Lions Den but the king asked Daniel are you all right inside of there because God deliver you Daniel then say yes the god deliver me somehow Daniel was able to connect to the source and Daniel had that peace amidst hung Reliance so that peace is not because there is no hard rock music around you and there's nothing around them no it's internal is what God give whose mind is stayed on the that's the catch there that the liberate focus on God that deliberate fixing on the thoughts of God and you would find out where you could meditate and you hear Isaac of time say meditate Med is not reading meditation comes after read so if you don't read you have nothing to meditate on because you're not reading if you're not reading the word you can't meditate what you meditating on you have to read you have to hear you have to listen then you think on it and then as you begin to think on it a lot of things begin to unfold meditation is to focus one's mind for a period of time in silence meditation is to think deeply about something and if you are meditating on something you think about it carefully and deeply for a long time and you know Wednesday night was really something else it was really such anointing that was in the church such anointing and I felt something I and you hear me say in the beginning something is right in me it's like some thoughts and I'm thinking I'm thinking I'm thinking about the mouth of God I'm thinking about how people speaking and they're speaking words but they're not connected to the of truth it's not the spirit of Truth speaking these words and I don't know how the service was going to unfold but it's as if God himself wanted certain things to be expressed so therefore this meditation is very important and that's what God tell Joshua don't depart from this word but meditate on it day and night that you'll have good success it means that this word is soaking in you you know like when you cut up meat and you know you put it in season I forget there's a word to use where you leave it overnight or leave it in the fridge and whatnot and it's all the seasoning all the juice the things going inside the meat so when it cook it get succulent and so like that well that's what meditation does meditation make the word succulent it it it it it it covers you it it's become part of you and then it says because he trusts in thee and this trust this is the Big R I think many of us feel in in trust in God we we as human beings we try to figure out a lot of things we have why this happening as Isaac say if you reframe it not why this happening to me but why this happening for me you reframe it but really and truly you have to let go of you in order to trust God let me repeat that you have to let go you let go your thoughts let go your approach in order to trust God so when life seems uncertain and overwhelming that is where trust comes in when worries and fears take a hold upon your heart that is where you want a sell or pause or think on this and refocus your mind through the scripture and through prayer and that is how David in Psalms 42 verse 11 David said why thou cast down oh my soul David is speaking to himself that's why when you read the word and you draw from it you could use the same scriptures the same Psalms and see what's going on inside of you David said why are thou cast my soul why are thou disquieted within me hope thou in God for I shall yet praise him who is the health of my countenance and my God and that in the Amplified David says why are you cast down oh my inner self why should you moan over me and be disquieted within me hope in God and wait expectantly for him for I shall yet praise him who is the help of my countenance and my God so your frustration is evidence you're not looking to him you want this you want to go this way you want that and God doesn't answer and God doesn't bring it to pass and you are frustrated because it not working out but just if you could catch his mind you don't know whether or not God is protecting you from you God is protecting you from danger down the road and if you're let go and trust God and let Romans 8:28 uh cover your soul cover your mind and we know that all things all things not some things not not I get a raise a pay or get a new job or this no no no all things things that might look Bleak things that might look negative things might look rain reain reain you want son but the farmer want rain and you say Lord send the son but the farmer needs the rain God have to bless everyone and and and he promised though that all things will work together for good no life is not fair forget about it don't expect fearness but God is good and he is faithful and he will work things out for you so David expressed this here Psalms 62 going here tonight and there's that one the last thing I to read that Psalm that blow me out Psalm 131 we'll get to it but truly blow my blow me out David said truly my soul waited upon God from him cometh my salvation could you say you're waiting on the Lord he only is my rock my salvation he is my defense I shall not be Moon I skip down to verse five my soul wait thou only upon God for my expectation from him he only is my rock look at the conviction of David has look at the acknowledgement of who God is to him and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be moved in God is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in God trust in him at all times he people pour out your heart before him God is a refuge for us you see trust give you the Liberty to be free I sometime I mention this about brother Blackman would talk about in the early years he would have no money and he was stand by the bus stop and somebody was said come I'll pay for you just like that and he on there people have so much powerful testimony want to go service and couldn't get no transportation and pray in their heart and see Transportation come and they get to service the liberty of Faith was was was amazing and after a while when they get money or things work out different they stop trusting God they trust in their pocket now they they trust in their wallet they trust in the boss trust in the pay he trust in everything else but God but David said trust him at all times he people p your heart before him God is a refuge to us now brother Bram he took this text and he's preached Shalom and he says it means peace that's what I want to say to the church this morning God's peace and when there's a mixture of light and darkness I address the church Shalom peace and the world is in one of the most chaotic times of Darkness ever stood in and yet it is standing in the Most Blessed light to ever shine in when God is separate light from Darkness he pressing it to the other side of the world that the light might be made manifest and the reason I say shalom to them is because it's God's peace here we say here we say and I want to bring to you this morning for the new year not looking back but we are looking forward to the breaking of a new day until there's something great Lan ahead for us where the years has been the joy that we have looked forward to the pressing coming of the great light and now we can see it breaking Over the Horizon the horizontal realm is breaking between Mortal and immortality we see it breaking Between Heaven and Earth from a Earthbound sickness and travel world into a bright shining day of immortal Immortal Life an immortal body an immortal Earth that shall never pass away it is shallow unto the church it is light time coming for the Believers but gross Darkness for the people now I say to the church Shalom God's peace it means good morning God be with you god peace go with you good morning how do you do it's a breaking day Church there Darkness upon the people but is good morning to the Church of Christ is appearing Among Us Shalom peace Shalom so let's look back again as we close to Philippians chapter 4 be careful for nothing it means be anxious worry about nothing take your worry and Pelt it bag it and put it let the garbage truck pick it your worry be careful for nothing that's a order that's a word in other words don't be anxious don't worry and when you think about it I'm not to worry I am to trust it makes a difference be careful for nothing but in everything I prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request remain known to God so Paul is encouraging the Believers to let go of anxiety and Place full confidence in God in God's ability to handle every situation in our life Thanksgiving and this Thanksgiving is so important because this reflects the level of gratitude that you have to God you may not have all that you want you may not have all that you need but you're grateful for what God has given you and we commit whatever else to unfold making make a habit of thanking God thanking God for his blessings and for his faithfulness to you let your request be made known unto God and then he said the peace of God which passeth all understanding the peace of God that bypasses all human intellectual stuff shall keep your heart and Minds through Jesus Christ and that keep your heart and mind to mean this peace is will be like a god not ad man not some pitbull in the yard backing backing making noise the peace that you have the assurance that you have somebody give me some testimony of somebody oh yes I was hearing a testimony oh yeah a brother who celebrated his 17th birthday and I heard a big testimony of a home invasion and they came to Rob or something like that the family and the person was just talking about in Jesus name in Jesus name in Jesus name and the people just get out and go they couldn't rub they couldn't do it because that man was actively pleading the blood of Jesus Christ and calling upon the name of the Lord how about a close Jesus speaks in St John 14:27 peace I leave it you my peace I give unto you not as the world give give I unto you let not you had be troubled neither Let It Be Afraid so Jesus when speaking of a peace for his people that is not a peace today and and no peace tomorrow it's an internal it is enduring it is connected with his presence this peace is not as the will give it some people feel they have peace when they get the money or when they get the car or the house but that is the world interpretation of what peace is like and they still have fear and anxiety because they need protection as they get security dogs and everything else but Jesus said neither be afraid in other words whatever unty whatever danger there is he will take care of it finally Psalms 4610 be still and know that I am God I will be exalted among the Heathen I will be exalted in the Earth that word be still that is the word stop fighting up in your own self stop worrying stop trying to control this and control that we have too much of controllers manipulators your hand have to be in like salt in everything and because you like salt especially with the family you're handing everything in their lives not giving God an opportunity to work be still and know that I am God God speaks I will be exalted among the Heen no matter how crazy it might look he will be exalted Among the Hidden and this's the final thing I have from Psalms 131 this one just blow me up there's three verses in that Psalm Psalms 131 there a Psalm you could you could read it when you have time and meditate on it David Speak Lord my heart is not Hy nor my eyes lofty nor do I exercise myself in great matters or in things too high for me surely I have behaved and quieted myself listen to this simile as a child that is weaned of his mother my soul is even as a weaned child that means that David is saying I am no longer threatful I've quieted myself you know when a baby fussing fussing fussing they want the breast they want milk and whatnot and then they get the Assurance they get more mature they get more rip and no more threaten we mature changing let Israel hope in the Lord from hence forth and forever more no longer fretful but one that is full of Thanksgiving I want to encourage you tonight as we get on in prayer continue to make your wants known to God by prayer with supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be known unto the Lord I trust this tonight would help you I would encourage you to be drawn closer to God to surrender to his will and to his way because he has a plan and program for your life and he wants to reveal that to you we God allows us to drop in a channel that we can bring a word to you I trust this is a word for you in season that it would quench or quiet you from your anxiety from your fears from your worry from your wondering and it would open up a channel for you of trust and confidence in God and last word I could give you is he that started the good work in you is able to complete it at the end God bless you are we going to get down in prayer at this time [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] for [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
