father god as we approach your word tonight a person is coming on a special way you your people here tonight have great need lord we confess we are such a native people and we look to you the order and finish our faith you will start a good work in us is able to complete it father come on this scene tonight and speak lip to air with a pillow fire drop down lord may you speak from that fire you speak from the glory lord me may the angels descend back and forth lord bringing revelation bringing inspiration changing and transforming hearts and lives in jesus name i ask it amen god bless you everybody bibles i get into luke 8 reading from verse 11 to 15 and romans chapter 8 luke 8 and romans chapter 8 scripture reading tonight i know we took the scripture from matthew 13 and the camp but i want to take it from luke chapter 8. i'm doing that on purpose we read from verse 11 no the parable is this the seed is the word of god those that by the way side are they that hear then commit the devil and take it away the word out of their hearts at least they should believe and be saved they on the rock a day which when they hear receive word with joy these have no root which i believe and in time of temptation fall away and that which fell among tones the day which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to perfection but on good ground are they which are in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it i bring it forth fruit with patience i want you to note the word patience did bringing forth fruit with patience we want to turn to romans chapter eight i want to read from verse 28 it reads and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are decalled according to his purpose for whom he did for know he did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born among many brethren so that's what jesus supposed to be the first born among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called whom he called demi also justified and whom he justified then he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if god before us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to charge of god's elect it is god justified who is he that condemned it is christ that dying he rather that is risen again who is deemed at the right hand of god who also make it intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword for it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter name in all these things we are more than conquerors to him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels no principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord let's pray father are we thank you for your word tonight and we are so blessed lord to hear these powerful scriptures i pray father god that your presence will just have the preeminences and may your word come to light and life tonight in jesus name i ask it amen you may be seated oh praise god blessed be the name of the lord praise god and uh i will take a little inspiration from uh equally as yes shriva swan to everything there's a season and time to every purpose on the heaven and i'll connect that to romans 8 28 and i'll have a title the manifestation of your season and time to fulfill your purpose the manifestation of your season and time to fulfill your purpose amen who praise god so don't be too uh anxious you have to have patience that that seed going to come ripe and mature in the camp i wanted to emphasize 34 64 100 full to show that once the seed strike good growing it will bring forth it might bring to the measure of you know of a hundred percent but it's to be 30 it'll be sexy you'll get your measure you will get your harvest but tonight i want to kind of emphasize that patience because the bible talk about the husband man waited for the fruit of the earth and he had long patience you see when you plant something you can't be so excited to try to pull the fruit out of the tree the fruit have to unfold the life have to unfold and the fruit will come into course now if you don't plant you don't reap if you don't plant you have no house but if you plant you have to wait can somebody say amen you have to wait as we set the sow and forth to sow and as he keeps sowing the birds take some we say don't stop at the birds don't let the birds throw you off track that bird is just that's what they do they take some they cut all some fall among rocks not all will fall among the rocks just some will fall among rocks isn't that right some will get tied up with torns just some not all but some will fall on good ground so your duty is to keep on sowing keep on believing keep on planting keep on pressing all might not hold tonight but some going to hold some day someday something going to strike you something going to open up something gonna break up on you revelation gonna break up on you you don't know when tonight maybe your night tonight maybe a special night you could make this a special night if you declare it to be so you can have to speak at first like that man who was half blind and they wanted to know what room to take him in he said this room would be perfect they described they said oh you know he said i make it so praise god and you could make this night your night because you choose it to be so you declare it to be so that's what our father did he said let there be he didn't argue with the darkness he didn't say don't kill us and he said let there be and he just waited until it beat praise god he waited for the season on time because once god said let there be have a season in time for that seed to come to life but every seed must bring forth after its kind it's a law built in built in just like summer is built in an autumn is built in and winter is built in and spring is built in and nobody could stop the season and time because god said that in the heavens and man is on earth and they can't change what god set in the heavens and thy word of lord is settle forever in the heavens and once that word is settled man and it can't change it so once god predestinated you unto his purpose and as all things work together for good to them not love god to them who would be called according to his purpose and if you were called according to his purpose i don't care what road you have to pass you through i don't care what we have to pass you through you're gonna come true nothing's gonna separate you from the purpose that god elected you and predestinated you nothing will separate you from the love of god in christ jesus not tribulation not nakedness not poverty not depression not frustration not family issues not mind that not even sin praise god because he called and we call he justify what more shall we say the night of these things if god before us who can be against us it's time you recognize god is for you because somebody's saying can somebody give a shout out prayers you see all the holy spirit tied all together to everything there's a season and time to every purpose give god a shout out pray oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god amen it's a powerful thing to plant and watch the life unfold hallelujah so if god want to show down the devil's kingdom he just have to put in a seed a virgin shall conceive you didn't hear me tonight when he wanted to destroy and erect the devil's kingdom he had to put a seed so he said a virgin shall conceive and be a child his name shall be called wonderful counselor may be lasting father prince mighty god prince of peace what god did he put a seed into in mary's womb hallelujah hallelujah to bruise that devil hallelujah to knock that sip on his head isn't that right he put the seed among child christ jesus and when he warned the sinner a message in this day to bring a revival in this day all you have to do is to put the seed he said the bride had no revival is here it will take them seven thunders and he will send it he promised it he just had to book a seed or come on same as somebody and when god took the prophet off the devil thought it was cut off but he sent an apostle behind the prophet to keep putting on that speed some fell on i feel tonight that that spoken word which is the original seed has found some good wrong in trinidad oh hallelujah i believe tonight we are ready for the rain i believe tonight you are ready for your season and your time to manifest your purpose give the lord some praise as people you want to be seated hallelujah hallelujah so i trust that when you raise your hands up to god to worship you understand what you're doing when you raise up your hands to god to worship you are rarely watering your seed you have no excuse right now tonight you are breaking into revelation the same camel that rebecca water was the same camel that took her to isaac and the same word we are watering tonight it's the same power not going to take us to where we're supposed to go so you better start worshiping you better forget your problems and forget in your situation i'm trying to figure it out and we're going to praise god and join them in the revelation chapter 5 when they say worthy is the lamb for those redeemed us from now that night blood and we shall reign on the earth god don't care about your problems this morning he care about your praises because your praises will bring the water to water they see in you and that will solve your problem come on same as somebody stop studying the problem study the seed come on say him and somebody oh get the lord some glory hallelujah you may be seated hallelujah and as we grow in god and grow in grace it will become simpler and simpler not more complex it's become very simple but i'm saying this way from jesus to revelation could be described as wood made flesh full word made flesh god wants to get something done he have to put a seed he can't help it because his word is taught express his thinking have to be expressed by word and once his word is seed so but the branham preacher messages spoken word is original seed it have contrary seed have you seen how i'm calling america all i could do is eat it you can't sweat back because this man that man tamper with that and once a man tamper with that it corrupt i will say once you're born of a woman you're subjected to death you want to promise or anything else but death unless it comes to the rapture time when you're going to be changed in a moment and that's what we're all looking forward for and if it's not us it's somebody else but for the meantime we're under the law of debt isn't that right but we have life within us by the word now you can only overcome by the word you can't overcome my ethics by education by degrees you can only overcome by the word not by philosophy not by tv only overcome by the word so the devil his job is to keep you away from the word is not right but to be bright you have to accept the atonement in his fullness which is the fullness of the word and once you accept the fullness of the word it means that you are to be born his image you have to come into the fullness of his image which is his image and likeness he's not only predecimate to you but unto a purpose who he formerly called who he called it justified who justified he had already glorified isn't that right isn't that right blessed be the name of the lord watch he predestinated what to be conformed to the image of his son so in reality you are to be my you have to manifest the word image you have to come into the world image in other words you have to become the word to be bride hallelujah all else is just church members glory oh this is good this is very good all else is jewish members you understand abraham ishmael too not only isaac you understand that ishmael have a great generation nation and so all the arabs and all them all what is abraham c2 but you ishmael hallelujah is still fighting today isaac versus ishmael the battle is on so it will be bright versus church members so you can study the church members you have to want to be born into manifestation to be bright hello hallelujah hallelujah are you with me glory do you understand that the hundred and forty four thousands are elected seeds that are the generation coming from abraham that god recognized out of different tribes that's god seeing the generation after generation he know them by name he said ten thousand from this tribe ten thousand from that tribe ten thousand a hundred and forty four thousand by name oh hallelujah notice when people are called they are called by name who inform you he called he called you by name but not your literal name is the mystery of the book being unfolded to you that reveals your name to you and when you see your name your husband can't keep you your bride can't keep it children can't keep your mama brother you have nothing to do with them it's not a family business going running it's an individual affair i just love it i just love it hallelujah hallelujah somebody tell a family boo and they hold by all them revelation nice people echoing back the boo i see him back what somebody said who family talked to the same talk same here when when you go family wrong when one person wrong let's get a wrong message you will finally have a wrong message because there's no revelation there but when you understand that you as an individual have to get revelation and revelation is to rock that the ability to use upon then you can't bother what your brothers say what your mother say what your father say what your sister say what nobody say because you are individual and i have to have revelation and that's the fate that you have to approach god to get your breakthrough hallelujah too many people looking for uncle and tanty and somebody to do for them praise god look at the entitlement and all you haven't had to do is to work and every place you put your foot you're entitled to fight i like how god set it up and he put some giants in the land hallelujah goliath and his four brothers put them in the land put the sun's at top the mountain let keleb say i'll cut your head off i'm coming to get you know them fellas wasn't easy you know they hinted the things that were 14 inches praise god big fellas you know scary boy there were giants in those days genesis 12 genesis 6 giants in those days they were in those days they are wrong now physically they are wrong now spiritually intellectual giants they're real big you know real mash up with the knowledge they're real big you can't just go with your head to deal with them no they're bigger than you don't mess with them keep walking keep on walking you don't defeat them fellas messing with the head they're too big you are humble you'll be going to the children of israel come on now kill your lamb sacrifice let the blood splash all over you praise god you are nobody hallelujah your ordinary folk but that's the kind that god called hallelujah destitute and afflicted of whom the world is not worthy you may not have all the education but you have christ you have the word you have faith you believe you're holding on you have a prayer come on same and somebody you're a prayer you have a prayer you still have a prayer keep on praying hallelujah keep on praying maybe your face had a prayer kind of weak nobody embodied with that maybe some birds take that prayer maybe a second said a prayer maybe you'd fall on rock and here i feel like god not gonna answer you but keep on praying maybe a second to taste it a prayer it got all tied up but keep on praying when you hit that spot her angel is there to collect it i can see the angel descending with his file to collect your prayer take it up to the goal in order feel like preaching tonight oh hallelujah keep on praying praise god god want to screw up your prayer and at the appointed time your prayer i have heard the cries of my people i heard them crying i heard them saying i heard them on the expectation for a real manifestation the god of israel he's alive tonight you may be seated oh hallelujah hallelujah this message needs a good shot in the arm to shake people out to the intellectual condition they have sat down on their knowledge for too long so they don't even know what to do they don't even know how to command a real expectation i begin to worship and get an expectation atmosphere they come down looking for some priests they're looking for some man they'll give us somebody dude for them and yet the words say a man can't bring the revive but hallelujah praise god is back to the world it take the people to catch something that's why when you come you come to catch something you like come here just to come i understand how you don't understand the message you mean i play inspiration so deep no i'll check on us i want to preach in praise god what kind of foolishness is that homie they don't understand what i'm preaching homie you don't understand what i'm getting at i'm getting that to your purpose but you have a time and you can't vex with god and angry with god you have to be worshipping on the patience because impatience you come to perfection which is waiting on god and written for god that is why i read that scripture tonight we ain't talking about that 34 and 54 tonight we're talking about turning up a room until come on come on not when you want it until i let the bible surrender day of pentecost was fully come come on preach back to me somebody that they have to fully come it have to fully come when everyone came into the fullness of believing at the same time at the appointed time i will return unto thee why because for every purpose under heaven there is a time and a season oh same as somebody give the lord some praises you can't manufacture it you can make it happen before it's time caught up in a point of time to send this bombing trinidad come on same as somebody that comes in coming we're going to blow up the devil they're going to blow their walls and practitioners they're going to pull the ball with discord a lot of things about the breakfall are people not even expecting it will be the mighty hand of god hallelujah they're going to lose their flesh and blood flesh and blood hack not reveal this unto you hallelujah but my father had revealed this unto you you have to understand we were talking a couple of sundays or two months or so ago about the throne the gardens of the throne and they may wonder what an earthquake we're talking about the gases of the throne and talking about god will not let no scallywag just partake of that presence because he already demonstrated that in the garden of eden when adam fell he put the guardians to god the tree of life listen adam's condition he partake of it but abandoned call it in the season the unrighteous partaking of the holy ghost oh yes contrary life trying to access power see so god wouldn't allow that he has to make sure life is right it's not even gift because gift and calling is without repentance these brothers these apostles and people in the old new testament they had the virtues in them they had d7 rainbow inside the damn those sarahs was flying all back and forth around them the judgment throne was in peter's heart that's why when anas and sapphira taught his brother peter that they know all these years only to find out somebody else was sitting on that man's throne that throne went from heaven to christ and that children from christ into peter and nobody could see him touch him but angels brought back and forth where he walked angels walking you understand why the angels walk with these men you understand when they went to prison the angel was with them wherever they went the lord himself went with them wherever wherever wherever it doesn't matter if they go in the grocery it doesn't matter if they go in the supermarket wherever they go god is going with them you understand that we are going back to another book of acts you understand we are going back to the word made flesh living gospel hallelujah living gospel not talking gospel living living gospel living gospel what we mean just as thousands of live voices what we need in trinidad live voices where people talking message talking to understalking all kind of thing but where is the voice where is the lies hallelujah hallelujah people walking around with hate chains of hate chains of anger chains of gratitude not even seeing the lord they see in flesh and blood they're fighting with flesh and blood they want to confront flesh and blood they want to question flesh and blood they're not questioning god hallelujah look at joe when he begin to restrict strip strip and joe begin to question stuff i'm beginning to talk to god and god say answer me like a man where was thou when i read the foundation of the uh talk to me man hallelujah talk to me something am i where was that when i laid the foundation of the earth what are you talking about hallelujah i invite the devil to check you out because i know what's inside of you is greater than what the devil could put around you what the devil could send to you what's inside of you son is a seed of the original what inside of your son is the attribute of who i am hallelujah i never fail yet i never lost a battle yet come on say email somebody that's who you are son and you come from god you're going back to god the devil could hit your body but you gotta hit your soul because there's a gene inside of there there's a germ inside of there there's a seed inside of here and if god put inside of you what god bless no man can curse there's a blessing upon your seed i say tonight you only looking for rain the devil is a liar your flesh can be squealing calling second party that have nothing to do but that thundering seed that's in your soul and the seed of all the potential the seed of all the life the seed of all the ability the seed of all the fruit in it you may be seated we got some fruit trees and plant around the church and they start the flower already listen well guys but i've shown you i have life in mima like a flower here like a flower there the flower is a prophecy you know what the flower is saying fruit coming come on give the lord i shout you you should get that you should get that give the lord shouts of praise the flower is the spirit of prophecy the flower saying fruit coming now if you're playing a tree in the wrong season you see plenty green leaf you know i hear somebody plant the street you plan to see one of them trees in the wrong season they the only scene leave leave leave leave big big big and you see nothing why they have a seasonal time missing seeds and misty time and you put them in the wrong season at the wrong time only you spread them big looking like gulad family big and tall no fruit but when you're planted right my goodness it brings forth its leaves it's bring forth its fruit in the season and in time that's how god wants your life jesus was hungry one time he come out of a victory he could do some good ball fig cook fig it had no faith he cursed it it wasn't the seasonal things he was showing that when that power to curse the tree from the roots up then he went on in a deeper problem i love him i love him i love how he teaches i love how we unfold things he talked about in john 15. if you're bad in me and my words are bad in you you can ask what you will it shall be done unto you and every tree that brings forth fruit my father gonna prune to bring forth more fruit and if you don't bring forth he will cut you off and whatnot and if you bring forth fruit you want more fruit and then much fruit and hearing is my father glorified so he is that content for you to be like a tree no anybody could be a tree he want fruit and when he see you coming up with fruit he comes to prune you know you know what putin is right it's not a big cut in chairs don't cut me leave me to bear one fruit two fruit pruning is to get more buds out you have to get buds first your life has started bud your dry life is not a bird no fruit yet just blood but with grace but with mercy but with compassion hallelujah birds of loves have to just break out upon your life my god is that they get sweet now and yet thunder yeah come on now not even live voices yet they're just bothering something's had to break out if that big is at the breakout you can't explain it you're budding oh i believe some of you go but tonight then if you're a nightmare hallelujah we could shout sunday hallelujah i believe some of you could but tonight why because when aaron put that dry rod in the presence of jehovah in the presence of the shekinah glory when iran went back the next year that was an implanted rod that was all dead red but in the presence of shekinah glory that rug blossom that red body that red port fought fruit and i could say you could be born try like in the valley of dry bones tonight but if your rod could be placed in this kind of glory that god promised to be upon the pride cross darkness cover the people but your light gonna shine upon you your she kind of gonna come to you i said you are the word the glory is following the word come on give god some praises i will give you a dark time tonight and your work 24 hours and you know come here give god praises oh glory hallelujah hallelujah oh glory hallelujah hallelujah do you understand the spirit writes the word do you understand the spirit follows the blood do you understand the water is what the disciples was waiting on in the upper room do you understand the seed was already in them they didn't have more teachings to get jesus already unfold the old testament to them you already unlocked the understanding isn't that right so now all they want is word or is it all they want was water and i'm saying that the bride have to come to a spot where all they want is water now when you see the fruit come forth the fruit could only grow so much and no more the manga could only reach so much and i was after a while it had no more growth it don't grow after that is only ripening time i wonder if all the food value already in then is only ripening time then you need hot july sun yeah ready for rain yet if god said marine and you'll see that right your seagull rotten when your seed mature they come like the corn the corn is growing you have the husk isn't that right if the corn is young you pull it out you can't bury that you can't dry that the corn have to be mature i want it mature you know long time farmers they hung it up them young people wouldn't know about a tight up hung it up on a string and you dry everything dry you see dry corn a drying drying trying looking like a dead no you ain't going to make that boiled corn you will break your teeth you've got to get false seat after that so you're not touching that that is not for boiling that person bowling stage students you can't boil it so one time it's boiled corn next time is rose corn when it passed that stage is dry corn to plant hallelujah so you're gone drying up there and my goodness that is what you want you want to plant a holy corn this is what god did so you come to a spot where you have to get dry big oh something let me wipe it be cold everybody's bowling my brother want to see you sometimes your children have been killed sometimes your husband will be killed but the problem is the thing is god wants to break out sometimes the balls have been killed co-workers have been killed childs have been killed fire burn you could be killed all kinds of troubles they'll bake you out so you get out your human spirit you have to trust god my trust is in you why because you're trusting yourself all the time listen to this i'm professional perfect with this this is brother branham he's praying he said there may be some here this morning lord that has emptied themselves up okay let me back up a little bit he said now and there may be others out into the land where these tapes will go where little humble women and men will take them into their homes and into the tribes out in the other lands may they hear lord and understand empty themselves up so that the holy spirit can fill them and there may be some even here this morning lord that has emptied himself up since we started speaking and has listened and has realized that they have trusted too much in their own thoughts of their own ability trusting in the shootness of their own simple human mind which is nothing but filthiness before god oh god miller just empty themselves out now humbly submitting themselves and come for the filling of the spirit granted lord amen you see the thing about it a long life's journey along the way what had happened is that people leave the holy spirit and they begin to use the cunning of their own mind and that bring on spiritual man church politics so then people begin to be manipulative and controlling because they want influence but it ended up being man's influence and not god's influence so then what end up happening is that the influence of the holy spirit become placed upon man and then now that man become a pope eventually then all of god's presence that's supposed to be among the people end up upon iman that become antichrist spirit isn't that right but god is a god of the orient so he want to release his spirit among the people because he want to manifest himself as the god of his people now remember ministers supposed to be servants hallelujah not paramount people supposed to be servants be supposed to put on the apron and bring the victory to serve you it's not we are the important people you are we are the messengers to bring message to you hallelujah praise god maybe even get that anybody could be a minister with subject scriptures and read scripture but very few gonna be servants and god show me that since in cairo it take a certain quality to be a servant a servant comes to serve not to be served and jesus said the son of man come to serve not to be served and that's why in feet washing you have washed one on his feet to show that you're humbling one towards the other and jesus the one that washed your feet first and when peter declined he busted peter he said if you're david don't let me do this you know part of me praise god because his son might not come to be saved but to serve you understand that so you are very important to god why would a king die for you why would a king die for you and send messengers to give you love letters hallelujah every service is a love letter praise god every service is a word from god if you could stick me out of the way and recognize wait a minute what is that man saying to me no what is god saying to you god after you somebody he has to use a man hallelujah could i find a man that i can pull out of the way that i can influence my people then you are influenced by the word then you are influenced by god then you're no longer governed by human spirit that trap you into your own thing but you break out you break out where all things are possible when you begin to believe all things and and hope all things and hallelujah you're not trying to interpret somebody have a different motive and objective no you believe in all things and you're hoping all things and you're enjoying all things charity never fail it oh the devil don't want us to get organized i told you no oh yeah we could slam on another and talk we have forgiveness and probably kindness only just talk mo just yapping up and yapping we have to even go beyond that jesus blessed the carbon pharisees he said but you love your own he said them fellas all they love their own too so there is no big thing there is no big improvement then you love your own you and them love their own you love your family other people love their family too you think you love your family more than others love their family hey where are their family but that's not what you're talking about you talking about could you love your enemies could you do good to them that hate you could you extend yourself and stretch a lot of people don't want to stretch they want them come right in front of the face hallelujah when they want to go in the grocery they want to drive in front of the grocery they don't even want to pack the car don't walk a little bit again they want to drive inside the pharmacy that's how people are the ones that come right upon the lap and that's what i love god how god is he saw moses bringing him up to the land he saw joshua crossing them into the land hallelujah never nothing out to the elders never tell y'all there's anything you talk to just right there just right take these people over meditate on the word day and night because i want you to be successful there is no success if you're not in the world i want you to have good success god describe how we want it you know some people like to say well i try my best god and nothing try the best hallelujah that's why i said there's no excuse in this pulpit no excuse if the church feels i have failed i fail to leave you i feel to dictate or fail to share the vision that will bring you into the channel of your expectation for you to get where it's supposed to no excuses god spoke to joshua take these people over no excuse come on same as somebody at the end of time god don't want an excuse we have a short time to fulfill what we have to fulfill because there's a time and season for everything or what time is running out praise god you could lose money and get back money but if you lose time you can't get it back come on same as somebody praise god and the angel said time shall be no more so we have a limited amount of time to accomplish this purpose oh glory to god the prime minister of israel said iran iran raised god america all the sanctions and working are given iran some time to cut out the nuclear business we will not allow a nuclear iran no iran have a powerful history called as persia and if you read about persia they were powerful are powerful people they are aware of the history syria king of syria pharaoh syria he is a way of history also and everything just getting into place israel preparing for war you have to prepare you think for one minute we just going in the rapture you've got to be kidding me praise god you've got to be kidding me you just go on in the rapture what you think is for your cannibal or something you've got to understand they have to come to perfection that means you come into the fullness of patience waiting for your fruit you may be seasoned what was it problem she couldn't wait the word tell them we multiply and replenish but god didn't tell him how that was a further revelation to unfold to them the devil coming to show evil and it wasn't by god's divine plan sex wasn't original in other words the spoken word supposed to come to speak to eve to bring forth another seed another spoken word son the devil bring it at the flesh level oh hallelujah that wasn't even original hallelujah that was not the original so when jesus came he said you must be born again of the word and the spirit in other words you have to come back to spoken word so he hide the seed in the gospel and he said we preach the gospel is foolishness to them who perish but to us who believe it is life oh give the lord some praises my god terry but until i'm enjoying myself tonight do you understand the power of the word was put in the gospel and when the gospel is preached the devil get hurt because the son of man sowing the seed in your heart and every seed by the night's gonna bring forth after kind give the lord some praises when god wanted to you think god couldn't let fear get a heart attack and let them run over them egyptians and beat them up understand this there were millions there were thousands and thousands of they were multiplying like like the sun on the pharaoh but fear you had the whip fear had the power you think god couldn't utilize it but when he wants to deliver he's gonna put a seed you see you see god have to get the right one what if you are the right one tonight help me preach i want you to i want you to ride with me now what what if you are the one god waiting on all this time one moses bringing out two million people moses is the right one one abraham shall i hide from abraham what uh what i'm about to do seeing his ear of the earth you you you underestimate who you are you you don't know who you are yet but at that day you shall know you don't understand you just struggling in your mortality and your emotions and your sad face or your angry face or your surprise face or your joy face and you have all these faces you make all these different emotions and you're acting up and whatnot and that has nothing to do with the mystery below that let me just pick you know see the woman at the well now she was depressed it's not a nice thing to be living yeah kind of concerning life everybody know everybody's seeing you on your contrary and what is not a nice thing for any woman to go through that and so on she's in that mode that same emotion she's depressed jesus come and say woman water please he has no bucket he know you're not a bucket you can't go by no well but no bucket who says go by with that bucket you have to have a well you know what i said a pipe you open like that as well it's bucket is somebody to pull it up pull it down but jesus told his cypher and needs past troops samaria that sounds like he needs to find you so then then he began to talk to the woman he was sent there because her name was in the book and she didn't know so the mystery have to unfold to her which is living mystery not not paper mystery so what are some of your family and loved ones waiting for you to become a living mystery god don't ordain them to hear no paper ministry you have to be christ the mystery being revealed to them when them want to see god god say look me there in you come on you should be screaming and shouting what a privileged people we are to be chosen of god elected jacob had to become israel it was only 12 tribes of jacob come on now it wasn't the twelve tribes of jacob it was the twelfth tribe of israel but jacob at the turn right man doing contrary things hallelujah right woman doing contrary things but you have to have a turn there's a season time to get that turn maybe tonight is that night to get that turn hallelujah killing a life not supposed to be in your life but maybe tonight is that pen you have to believe it now you have to receive it you have to believe it now that tonight is a turning point in your life glory to god hallelujah a cut-off point god god told them the egyptians you see today you shall see them no more forever oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we got to believe in god give me season i think about the george and barter was telling me i think during the six day war i think it was that some some of the supernatural things happened on the battlefield and then my enemy dropped the tank and dropped the guns and run in general running they just run they seen supernatural things they drop things and run because god was with israel getting their people back to their homeland and so forth getting them back into possessed to overcome the syrians and overcome all them arabs and different kind of things like that could you imagine god say if you stay with my word i'll let your enemy free from you could you imagine you believers coming back to the point that you could expect god to run your enemies i'll be your enemy to your enemy i'll fight for you no weapon form against you will prosper you're not walking life here follow god this will happen forget about it if god before us come on now who can be against us hallelujah if god before you who can be against you you may be seated praise god when you start to connect to a reality of the omnipotence of god and feel into these brothers here it is it wasn't car time in that time it was donkey and camille so so moses and abraham cafes lord senate senator atc that can't be their prayer lord lord lord you can send a bends for me or a long maxi taxi to help next taught these people out the journey too long that prayer is not going to be answered god can say the maxi taxi there you know but that is not the edge according to my script quite down here so you have to ask good that your soul a way out that your shoe will help that your sandals are way out that's the prayer because that seasonal maxi season on a plane season that is shoes sanders donkey planting land songs tamarind you name it that's where we go here so if you want to church in this day see you yeah and whatnot and you're waving your palm and you're heading to egypt praise god you're going to the promised land amen now i know determining korea keeping you you know you are the ones that follow the nankura they just encourage the two by themselves just leave them alone forget this in angora you know what i'm saying then because i'm saying let's go back to egypt because they had position but you saying you're going to a place you never went before where god taken us we never went before this omnipotence this glory we talk about it we preach about it but we haven't tasted of it we know about the taste this thing this is a good land you know it's tilted plus we waiting to taste this thing you know we only hear prophecies about it but abraham had it he demonstrated it he had living gospel he said you know what i'm waiting on i'm waiting on the angel of the lord he is here i take every spirit under my control for the glory of god and the angel is there to manifest the gospel oh hallelujah he prophesied that what you see temporarily will be manifested in his fullness hallelujah as we come down to this spot as we come into the headstone as we come into the caption anointing oh hallelujah super church a super race omnipotent speaking the miraculous taking place you know what's awakened us missing limbs being restored oh hallelujah could you imagine somebody with no foot and you said foot come forward no we don't caught somebody without eyes and you could say i comfort help me jesus you're gonna be seated what problem you have what problem you have the only problem is a lack of faith i trust that god help you and begin to trust god you pray for the pastor you pray for the minister and really begin to trust god look how god teaches prophets and so only bring ezekiel down to the valley of dry bones he said look at them bones and jesus looked as very dry there's one thing to have dry bones on the bone he said very dry it was really dry but then bro look like silver bones white bones dry bones he said can these bones live he's always trying to do teach him teach him don't doubt teach him don't watch the situation don't look to your eyes ask god to look through the eyes of god hallelujah people only seen flesh and blood this one do me and that one do me and this will hinder me and like that's what keeping you away your blessing that's foolishness that is you and your horrid spirit messed up chains around your life hallelujah you're not seeing god paul said i come among you in fear and trembling to see jesus christ and him crucified i reject this flesh i'm not foolishness hallelujah now i say somebody drop dead i walk over them i'll walk to the side of them you think i hold them and no look all look at one there's one backslide this one go on and see this one forget about it i have nothing to do with that all the father giving me will come all how quarterly for me to preach to you they will come that's all will always be nine cents and none of you praise god you choose this way it's the hard way it's the now stop complaining deal with it deal with it you say brother i don't like who you are that's not your problem that's not my problem of god's problem god met the man for the hour he met the man for the the hour hallelujah i am built to be here now i have built myself god built me and he put something in me to handle things are taken away to get a second result to have a certain effect we gonna have a revival i don't care what the devil say nothing gonna separate us from the love of god in christ jesus you wanna be seated watch watch how paul say it who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god not justified she did so and so that's his one so peter deny christ this one do this this one do that oh yeah but hear the scriptures it's not you that justify it it's not your thoughts that justified it is god that justified if you hear and read what uh jacob did you want to know how he called my principle he wasn't easy what noah did what david did what solomon did what all them did they were flesh and blessed they killed him but it is god the justifier i love it that's why i know god don't have to ask nobody permission to bless me god will have to ask about the permission shall i bless this brother shall i press this is your think no nobody are holding your ticking papers nobody don't let nobody correct your papers that's what they want to do they want to judge you they want to correct your papers don't let them correct your papers let god correct the papers because when they brought the woman to jesus he said listen we have plenty points against her she failed this exam she failed his moral life we caught an adultery look she a complete earth just say okay why only bring all the exam people let me test all you and see if i'll go past it bring me paper from the inside not the outside paper you're looking good on the outside but bring the inside paper let me check your paper then fellas say you know what i can't wait for this examiner i go on nobody will jesus correct the people nobody want to bring the inside paper which one of you without sin cast the full stone you see a car seagull but you could see somebody fail here and fall there they cast the hypocrisy you can't see somebody smiling for your face and stabbing on your back you can see somebody lying and twisting things you can't see that but unclean objective you can't see somebody cravage us uncomfortably arrogant excessive pride you can't see that but these are things in the spirit realm you can't see somebody filthy spirit but these are things in the spirit well so jesus and his spirit i'm seeing him hypocrisy the naked before him understand this in your clothes right now you anthony said something these adam and eve were so veiled with the holy ghost they didn't even know they were naked and they were but it was withheld from them because of the veil over them that same thing has come upon us we never had a veil before glory my god i'm in heavenly places tonight you know what is to be failed from your past and when you go in your pasture go back to eden oh jesus you know what it is to be chosen and to be seen as if you never did it you never sinned never failed god see you as if you never did it he sink it so low in a sea called the sea of forgetfulness he himself can't remember it he can't even bring it up you didn't hear me tonight this place should be exploding tonight when god dropped it in the sea of forgetfulness he himself can remember you ain't getting your mother i see or what like that some beats you know make your one find some bottle and pick it up you know that the sea of forgetfulness when it drop it drop so when jesus told that woman woman where are dying accusers she said none my lord he said neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more in other words woman you are free and who the son of man set free preach back to me let me let me wrap up here oh lord whoa i'm i'm gonna close this oh i'm trying to get you listen i'm not getting anywhere i want to read something that was to introduce what i want to preach tonight and service is over it's already done oh my my my my but god is good he wants you to understand the mystery is that you are the seed itself the pentecostal was shocked so therefore when fire and dynamics tried to penetrate all they could do is manifest tongues and so forth when you're dynamic strike you're the manifest seven living voices in other words you have to bring on the war that the devil started in heaven that fell on the earth in genesis you're taking on that empath in the last days when let's how close to this when the devil realizes the bride has escaped the bible said he will make war with the remnant of the woman's seed that is church members who haven't come into a manifestation all they have is intellectual they haven't come into the oil you see so one part is the water spirit another part spirit oil wise virgin they have the same altars they have this sacrifice but no oil the strange thing about this oil and we're going to call this oil charity the oil of charity to get charity it needs faith and that faith is based on forgiveness so therefore to access the skylight you have to come true by the kindness watch not people barely kindness no spirit apparently kind of so god has to allow people to do you wrong that's the only way for that to come forward god has to let people push you around and if you fight it yeah i don't want to push me wrong but yeah i want people to i want to push wrong i want to see how much push you could take because only the person who got to push around god could use you saying some powerful things tonight yeah could god push you around or are you like a bulldozer i am moving well goku move around you because you were moving and god wanted to move you to do the job you see you see you see when david was on the backside and dealing with the beer and the lion that's david experience god wants to move him from the back side to the front side give it right now on the back of the book because send me back all the time you're that's why you take from the back and put it on the seventh fold on the in the seventh seal so you put the thumbnails on the back you put it in front but hide it from the devil so then move david now from the back and bring him to the front to save him his father said take them roti take them sandwiches and carry it for your brother save them if david had that attitude i asked you i ain't going to see them brothers now yesterday but i already always have that brethren brethren brothers whoever it is joseph brothers this brothers that brothers always somebody have somebody against somebody and they like somebody and they could see the war among them when david reaches their way wait we're doing here who's singing about the sheep they say a bunch of frightened men you got doulas i just had to read about these giants it was scary you know 14 inch finger you could imagine he's a big guy boy are you even letting it seem unreal no i'm killing it i'm telling you it's not a big hand man you know his hand matching his hygiene he's you see you know if we are giants you never shake your head like that it's just because we don't have any physical rim that you you know you're saying i don't know but you see a giant boy 12 feet high 14 feet high there's that quite a fella face right i'm saying yeah i mean when you think clarence told him what i'm gonna do so we say whoa look at about the prince and say but prince is a big man what we see two other princes he said whoa giants so david had to have a certain god consciousness know what something he have no support for his family his brothers finally should be home to begin with now if david allah had that atmosphere of roughing up the true holy spirit oh i feel good so david had to stay in the atmosphere that's a poor house that's a bomb tonight that's a bomb that's a that's an explosion stay in the atmosphere his brothers rough him up he's still in the atmosphere then goliath come and make his boats after you come in even service morning service by the way you have no even service sunday one service although i'll have his morning service 40 days that's like terrorism you know they're like al qaeda anything else they're like senator mother fight me more on evening and you hear him every day he's coming out and every day you're getting weaker because he's getting stronger because nobody coming out you see at least if they stand up somebody and make a little show and run back nobody running nobody here coming forward to run back like that kind of embarrassing you're going at all they say who is an uncircumcision he nailed him by the word he's uncircumcised what is he doing here he don't belong to us what is he doing here he nailed him that's a seed that's a seed he was saying the right thing uncircumcised for this time challenging not saul's army david i even see in this run you see when you're seeing soul army you see you know god how long do you need me again over 20 years okay right right i like you i like your sword boy whoa how long you get a body armor whoa that's the latest brother pcw buddy how many have that boy latest print by latest number little stamp on that who is it good then fellas have nice body armor nice sword car fight with he said we have all the word nice mysteries nice revelation and we can't even deal with that devil we can't deal with that situation we collapse we give up we let go we run we duck behind what's the sense we talk about the nice body armor david didn't have the latest body armor i'm almost done musicians where you have david swing look at my sword whoa boy whoa look at that david this is shining brand new from the factory this one come them other fellas have two year old sword this one i get is two days ago you're talking so discussions everybody comparing sword with so look at the handle pull handle sitting just right man doing so well whoa feeling good pull gold handler silver handle like i put my logo on it i put a special some nobody's have that you know look at it look at that i i agree with myself do you think that intermediate and goliath if goliath sent a don't need to listen to the composition and talk about god laughing laughing look at them the boy they're arguing about code they're arguing about days they're comparing this the vex with this wonder word coughing one of the playing cards and all glass saying send me a man to fight me send me your man to fight me david said isn't there a cause a cause means there's a reason and purpose for being that's purpose a reason for being isn't there a cause i'll fight him so i'll get so excited he said listen the latest this one come fresh this comes this morning put it on they david put it on not you see he's a nice guy he's not disrespectful he's just a soul let me tell you i'm with my own revelation i bring my own rock i bring my own no no no no no you know that you don't have to come and melt yourself and parade yourself and walk your beef out and you know you don't do that don't have the beef parade where you have a self you have to present he tried on can't kill my lord you know me and you know this you know i you know i kind of rough you know i mean i can't worship i can't praise god i'm not accustomed with this you know i'm not no soldier business but you know let me get my testimony on the backside i handle it being lying and you know i mean they're not alive they're not alive no deceased and just as just being already sees that guy that's untold so he'll be just like them so saul had no choice but to allow this young man to demonstrate faith in god which is the original faith which is turtle which is what this is this is the original fit now so then go live now i like that i like that god blew goliath mine by selling odd being into him looking for some muscular a six foot tall man they told us they have now with some muscles manual in gym you know gym man you know these days people like him and so on pumping on and showing looking for some pumping iron man i see his little fella come no set of muscles no nothing he said disrespect disrespects disrespects

going out no listen that word cat returned for it come on now come on now come on now that was a thought from god dropping david his head he speak it it was not just god's word it was no david's word
