[17:28] profitable for rebuke and corruption and
[17:30] instruction
[17:31] in all righteousness the scripture is
[17:32] there to do something for our lives
[17:34] it didn't benefit israel because the
[17:36] word wasn't mixed with fate

[19:08] was in jerusalem
[19:09] everybody had an expectation they didn't
[19:11] know what was going to happen
[19:12] and all of a sudden a donkey came riding
[19:16] all of a sudden a man was on that donkey
[19:19] he was the messiah the king came right
[19:22] in lonely
[19:23] that was our king riding humbly that was
[19:26] our dynamics
[19:27] that was our power that was our reign

[19:53] cry out
[19:54] i can't stop when the time comes for the
[19:57] people to worship
[19:59] if i stop the rock's going to cry out
[20:15] this message is alive god is not
[20:19] dead he is still alive
[20:22] still alive he's still in the healing
[20:25] business
[20:27] the delivering business the restoring
[20:30] business
[20:31] the anointing business and the thing i
[20:33] love about him you may be seated
[20:35] is that nobody could keep you from

[20:45] blessing

[21:01] age we don't have another age coming
[21:03] we're going to close this age up
[21:05] with a shout we're going to leave this
[21:06] world with a shout out we wouldn't leave
[21:08] this world scratching our head
[21:10] like lot's wife looking back to see what
[21:11] we're leaving back no this bribe olivia
[21:14] shouted we'll be saying goodbye world
[21:18] good morning glory that's what we're
[21:20] going to be saying goodbye world
[21:23] good morning glory that's what people
[21:25] will be saying we're going to be changed
[21:27] you know about change we ought to be
[21:28] changed right now on the inside
[21:31] and then the body is going to be changed
[21:32] we'll be changing the very atoms
[21:35] in a moment in the trick of an eye and
[21:37] we will not be here
[21:39] we have a scripture a man named enoch
[21:42] remember to see that he walked with god
[21:43] and was not
[21:44] for god took him but before god took him
[21:47] you see there's so much people like to
[21:49] talk about what god allow
[21:52] it's almost like if there is no devil
[21:55] what god allowed
[21:56] and god allowed the devil to afflict me
[21:59] and god allowed this and stop studying
[22:02] with god allow
[22:03] and start to study what you have a right
[22:05] to
[22:06] you see because god gave promises inside
[22:08] of here that we have to
[22:09] take the kingdom is preached and every
[22:12] man
[22:13] pressed their way into it and those who
[22:15] understand who they are they could take
[22:17] it
[22:18] only those you see you see when those
[22:20] fighters they were taking some land
[22:22] i think we read it already joshua tell
[22:23] them he said listen we want some food
[22:26] for men
[22:26] we're going to take the kings of this
[22:28] this one and that king head off and that
[22:30] king all
[22:30] and the king was the guy said what
[22:33] happened you know you're going to do
[22:34] that
[22:35] what are you talking about they don't
[22:37] want to get them he said when i come
[22:38] back i'll go beat you
[22:40] because when god said to take that then
[22:42] fellas are saying
[22:43] how do we have enough men do we have
[22:46] enough sword
[22:48] do we have enough ability that was not
[22:50] the question
[22:51] the question is if god said it we just
[22:54] do it we execute it
[22:56] so these guys were so positive they said
[22:58] we're going to take them king's head off
[23:00] we need food we are hungry farmers
[23:02] should give us food the man said they
[23:03] want to get them food you say when they
[23:04] come back we'll deal with you
[23:06] man they take them king's head off
[23:08] handle the whole thing and come back and
[23:09] put licks because that is what they say
[23:12] they want to do
[23:13] so listen we are hungry this morning
[23:15] this evening
[23:18] we have we have some battle to do this
[23:20] evening are you with me
[23:22] are you going to fight this even let's
[23:25] all stand for the word
[23:27] deuteronomy chapter 8 amos chapter 3
[23:31] and revelation chapter 10 for the word
[23:47] remembering me on prayer on wednesday
[23:49] i'm on my way to every course
[23:51] the easter meeting and i request i'm
[23:53] expecting a great time
[23:56] over there in the lord next month
[23:58] supposed to be
[24:00] cameroon praise god so let's
[24:04] deuteronomy chapter 18 of verse 1
[24:08] all the commandments which i command it
[24:10] is the
[24:12] shall be observed to do that he may live
[24:16] and multiply and go in
[24:19] and possess the land which the lord
[24:23] swear unto your fathers and thou shall
[24:26] remember
[24:26] all the way which the lord thy god led
[24:29] thee these
[24:30] 40 years in the wilderness to humble
[24:33] thee
[24:35] to prove thee to know what was in thine
[24:38] heart
[24:39] whether thou would have keep his
[24:40] commandments or no
[24:42] and he humbled thee and suffer due to
[24:46] hunger
[24:47] and fed thee with manner which thou
[24:50] knewest not
[24:51] neither did thy fathers know that he
[24:54] might make thee know that man
[24:58] does not live by bread alone but by
[25:01] every word that proceedeth out of the
[25:04] mouth of the lord
[25:05] that man live amos
[25:08] three we want to read from verse seven
[25:12] and eight and next we read revelation 10
[25:15] 8 11.
[25:16] read the names 3 through 7.
[25:22] surely the lord god will do nothing but
[25:25] he revealed his secret
[25:27] unto his servants the prophets the lion
[25:31] had roared
[25:32] who will not fear the lord god had
[25:35] spoken
[25:36] who can but prophesy revelation 10
[25:41] you want to read from verse 8.
[25:50] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[25:51] speaking to me again saying go
[25:53] take the little book which is open in
[25:55] the hand of the angel which standing
[25:57] upon the sea and upon the earth
[25:58] and i went unto the angel and said unto
[26:00] him give me little book
[26:02] he said unto me take it eat it up it
[26:04] shall make thy belly bitter
[26:05] shall be nine more to this honey i took
[26:08] the little book out of the angel's hand
[26:10] ate it up it was in my mouth sweet as
[26:12] honey as soon as i had eaten it my belly
[26:14] was bitter
[26:15] and he said unto me though must prophesy
[26:18] again
[26:19] before many peoples and nations and
[26:22] tongues and kings that's about his
[26:23] father we have read your word
[26:25] blessed speak may they hear your word
[26:27] from your mouth
[26:28] your voice in jesus might ask it amen
[26:31] and amen you might be seated
[26:42] the title i have this evening is the
[26:44] word from the mouth of god
[26:48] on subject living by the word title
[26:52] again the word
[26:53] from the mount of god jesus said it when
[26:56] the devil
[26:57] tempted him to turn the stone into bread
[27:00] he quoted the scripture man shall not
[27:04] live by bread alone but by every word
[27:06] that proceeded out of the mouth
[27:09] of god and i'm talking today about the
[27:12] word
[27:13] from the mount of god now there are
[27:16] billions of people on the earth
[27:18] millions of mouths on the earth men
[27:21] and preachers on the earth it's wanting
[27:24] for words to come at the mouth of a man
[27:26] or men but is another thing for it to
[27:29] come out
[27:30] the mouth of god when god brought all
[27:33] the children of israel
[27:35] and they came to the mountain and fire
[27:37] came upon the mountain and the mountain
[27:38] began to shake and earthquake and so on
[27:41] the people said don't let god speak
[27:45] let moses speak and god say okay
[27:49] i'm going to let moses speak he going to
[27:51] be
[27:52] my mouthpiece isn't that right so then
[27:55] the mouthpiece of god are his
[27:57] prophets and amus said surely the law
[28:00] will do nothing
[28:01] except he revealed the secrets unto his
[28:03] servants the prophets
[28:05] so therefore when adam fell god
[28:09] continued in his creation to try to find
[28:11] a man
[28:12] who would live every word he tried to
[28:15] find a man that would live the word for
[28:17] his age
[28:18] and we find out that satan caused adam
[28:22] to fall
[28:22] by that one word by saying you shall not
[28:25] surely die
[28:26] and god continue on in his creation
[28:30] to try to find one man that would live
[28:32] by every word his first man feel
[28:35] and this man would live his time his age
[28:38] living
[28:39] now there are different ages that god
[28:41] prophesied from the beginning which
[28:43] would take place all down
[28:45] and that's the reason he could tell the
[28:46] end from the beginning
[28:48] what if moses had brought noah's message
[28:50] it wouldn't work
[28:52] what if jesus brought moses message it
[28:54] wouldn't work
[28:55] so we can't bring a methodist message or
[28:57] a baptist message or a pentecostal
[28:59] message it wouldn't work
[29:01] isn't that right so we've got to find
[29:03] out what the scripture says for today
[29:06] that's why jesus said in this way he
[29:08] that believe it
[29:09] on me as the scripture had said
[29:12] amen in other words it has come right
[29:15] back to what's written in the scriptures
[29:18] isn't that right so god
[29:21] excuse me is going to judge the world by
[29:24] the church
[29:24] which one catholic six hundred and sixty
[29:27] something you know foreign
[29:30] is going to judge the world by jesus
[29:32] christ
[29:34] because in the beginning was the word
[29:35] the word was with god
[29:37] and the word was god and the word became
[29:40] flesh
[29:40] and brought among us god and the word
[29:43] is the same and this is god in print
[29:49] [Applause]
[29:51] this is god in print
[29:54] i want to say that again this is god in
[29:57] print
[29:58] so that's why the devil don't want you
[29:59] to even read the bible because this
[30:01] is god in print but jesus said it is
[30:05] written
[30:06] it is written it is written oh give the
[30:09] lord some praises
[30:11] [Applause]
[30:18] so the word of god is god
[30:21] on print brethren
[30:25] god on print here we go jehovah
[30:28] printed on a book i'll give the lord
[30:32] some praises
[30:33] jehovah printed
[30:37] on a book isn't that right
[30:41] here we go he has got to judge a church
[30:44] by some standard
[30:45] and he cannot judge it by the standard
[30:47] of any system that we have made
[30:50] so they are churches and they are
[30:52] systems built
[30:54] around the churches how they are
[30:56] humiliate the deacons or how they
[30:58] jam the trustees or how they press the
[31:00] ushers and how they do this or how to do
[31:02] that
[31:03] how they straighten their members out
[31:04] they have systems
[31:06] around the world systems are built
[31:08] around the world but it's not the word
[31:11] the word is always god
[31:14] [Applause]
[31:16] so when jesus came he came amid systems
[31:19] pharisees scribes sadducees he seens
[31:23] he met systems and he was the word
[31:29] so he was bringing the present tense
[31:31] reality of truth
[31:33] but they had the systems that was built
[31:36] around the truth
[31:37] which was spot santan's gospel
[31:40] hand washing gospel thou shalt not and
[31:43] do this and do that
[31:44] and he came and bring the word and when
[31:46] he brought the word
[31:48] it was rejected because the word is
[31:51] always rejected
[31:52] because the world can't handle truth and
[31:55] system is built off of the world
[31:57] because system is always man-made but
[32:00] the word is god
[32:02] [Applause]
[32:04] church is man-made but revelation upon
[32:08] this rock i'll build my church that's
[32:10] [Applause]
[32:12] god
[32:14] and he said upon this rock i'll build my
[32:16] church and the gates of hell shall never
[32:18] prevail against it fight with it wrestle
[32:20] with it
[32:21] come against it so when god put a tick
[32:23] on your life
[32:24] before the foundation of the world no
[32:26] man can x you off
[32:28] only eight
[32:31] i will say it again when god put a tick
[32:35] on your life
[32:36] a green tick on your life before the
[32:38] foundation of the world
[32:40] nobody can x you down here come on now
[32:44] come on
[32:45] rory
[32:46] [Applause]
[32:49] the woman in the well she had a tick on
[32:52] her life
[32:53] before the foundation of the world but
[32:54] then earth they put the x on her
[32:56] and jesus came to tell her you have a
[32:58] take-up csa woman
[33:00] don't bother with those men i come to
[33:02] tell you
[33:03] you have a green tick you are all right
[33:05] you are fine
[33:07] oh i want to hear a bigger shout than
[33:09] that
[33:09] [Applause]
[33:13] okay so watch because every one of our
[33:16] systems and my need
[33:18] and listen it has to be judged now if
[33:21] you want to disagree and say no
[33:23] i believe you're wrong there but branham
[33:25] i believe ours
[33:26] or the other fellow would say well
[33:28] always is where then which one is right
[33:30] then there are 900 different systems of
[33:34] it
[33:34] so god could not judge the church by 900
[33:38] different systems
[33:40] there will be one and that will be god
[33:43] will judge the world by jesus christ and
[33:45] christ is the word
[33:47] so that is why every church is suffering
[33:53] and you cannot take the standard of one
[33:55] church and show it in another church
[33:57] the standard is the word regardless of
[34:00] where that church is this is the
[34:01] standard
[34:03] not race not color not here
[34:06] not skin just the word because this
[34:09] written word is what became flesh
[34:13] in the person of jesus christ he was
[34:16] this word made alive
[34:20] i want to hear your ride with me this
[34:22] evening
[34:23] so when they asked john the baptist who
[34:25] are you he said i
[34:27] am the voice of one crime in the
[34:30] wilderness
[34:30] he was quoting the written scriptures he
[34:34] was quoting the word himself
[34:36] because the scripture is the word from
[34:39] the mount of
[34:40] god
[34:41] [Applause]
[34:44] oh hallelujah and when the mouth of god
[34:48] speaks something
[34:49] nothing could stop it he said my word
[34:53] shall not return unto me
[34:57] void but it shall accomplish
[35:00] the purpose that i sent it to accomplish
[35:05] [Applause]
[35:09] you don't know how i feel this evening
[35:11] glory
[35:13] so jesus knowing the scriptures
[35:17] knowing what david said i shall not
[35:20] suffer
[35:21] my soul that soul and corruption not
[35:23] leave
[35:24] my legal soul in hell my holy one he
[35:26] knew david
[35:28] spoke speaking about him by prophecy
[35:31] because
[35:31] men of all were moved by the spirit and
[35:34] spoke the prophecy
[35:36] and when jesus read that scripture he
[35:39] could wrest his soul on it
[35:41] because that was the word from the mount
[35:44] of
[35:44] god he said destroy this temple
[35:48] and in three days i will raise it up
[35:51] myself
[35:53] jesus was relied on the word
[35:56] from the mouth of god that was spoken to
[35:59] david
[36:00] come on same and somebody they were so
[36:04] convinced
[36:05] that it was from god they could hang
[36:07] their soul on it
[36:09] jesus said destroy this body never a man
[36:13] speak like fat man never a man
[36:16] speak like that man
[36:18] [Applause]
[36:24] do you do you understand
[36:27] daniel daniel said i read my books
[36:31] and i understood the time that was at
[36:33] hand
[36:34] and i began to seek the lord because all
[36:37] these brothers
[36:38] understood that the word from the mount
[36:42] of god
[36:43] cannot fail man's word will not stand
[36:47] but this word one time jesus have not
[36:49] will pass away
[36:50] but my words will never pass away he was
[36:54] so convinced
[36:55] of where he come from and what he was
[36:58] he could say my word will never pass
[37:02] away
[37:03] come on are you going with me now oh
[37:05] glory to god hallelujah
[37:09] hallelujah so we are coming back
[37:13] that we could live by the scriptures
[37:16] live by the word
[37:20] oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[37:23] lord
[37:24] you may be seated let me just share a
[37:26] few scriptures with you
[37:28] matthew 2 23 and he came and dwelt in
[37:30] the city of nazareth
[37:32] that it might be fulfilled which was
[37:34] spoken by the prophets
[37:36] he shall be called a nazarene matthew 13
[37:39] 34
[37:40] all these things take jesus unto in them
[37:43] unto the multitude and parables
[37:45] and without a power speaking out unto
[37:47] them
[37:48] that it might be fulfilled which was
[37:50] spoken by the prophet saying
[37:52] i will open my mouth in parables i will
[37:54] utter things
[37:56] which have been kept secret from the
[37:58] foundation of the world
[38:00] matthew 27 35 and they crucified him
[38:04] and parted his garments casting lots
[38:06] that it might be fulfilled
[38:08] which was spoken of by the prophet they
[38:11] parted my comments among them
[38:12] and upon my vested cast nuts mark 7
[38:16] 6 he answered them and said well how
[38:19] isaiah's prophesy of you hypocrites
[38:21] for it is written these people honor me
[38:24] with their lips
[38:25] but their heart is far from me so you
[38:27] begin to understand
[38:29] that jesus was living the word and
[38:31] identifying scripture
[38:33] being fulfilled because he knew every
[38:36] word
[38:37] that came out from the mouth of god it
[38:40] can't fail
[38:41] it can't lie it's the truth
[38:44] you shall know the truth and the truth
[38:46] gonna set you free

[40:29] that
[40:30] and jesus told his disciples he said go
[40:33] and you're going to find these animals

[40:55] this is not a mean man this is not a
[40:57] stingy man
[40:58] this is not a selfish man this is a man
[41:01] that has the ability
[41:03] to surrender to the will of god
[41:06] straightway
[41:08] [Applause]
[41:10] now what i want to point at you is this
[41:13] when the season changes
[41:16] for the scripture to be fulfilled
[41:20] they have to lose that cult
[41:25] [Applause]
[41:29] we are coming for the cold
[41:33] you don't hear what i'm saying you are
[41:36] not hearing what i am saying
[41:38] and no man going to ask what we want
[41:42] with it

[42:28] how many feeling lose the radiance
[42:30] [Applause]
[42:30] [Music]
[42:31] [Applause]
[42:36] what's what's all this about this was
[42:38] done
[42:40] watch what this was done that it might
[42:42] be fulfilled which was spoken by the
[42:44] prophet saying
[42:45] tell ye the daughter of zion behold i
[42:47] king cometh
[42:48] unto thee me sitting upon an ass and a
[42:50] colt on a fool of an ass
[42:52] watch and the disciples went and did as
[42:54] jesus commanded them and brought her ass
[42:55] in the cold
[42:56] and they put in them clothes and let
[42:57] them sit there on
[43:00] now the thing about it all the time
[43:02] jesus telling people don't say anything
[43:04] don't tell nobody don't announce
[43:07] anything
[43:08] amen that's how jesus was just keeping
[43:10] quiet inside
[43:11] but this was different this was this was
[43:14] going to be a
[43:14] eruction the whole jerusalem this is
[43:17] going to affect everything because
[43:19] this was a nonsense whole new turn of
[43:21] his ministry now
[43:22] this was going big public big time
[43:26] all the people came along to celebrate
[43:27] and so forth this was this was big this
[43:29] was
[43:30] really big
[43:36] and a very great molecule to spread
[43:37] their comments in the way others
[43:40] cut down branches from the trees and
[43:43] strain them in the way
[43:45] because normally when the king come in
[43:46] you lay a carpet you live a robe you do
[43:48] something they will lay in things
[43:50] so what kind of mad people is that who
[43:53] am i
[43:54] and the molecules that went before them
[43:56] cried hosanna to the son of david
[43:59] blessed is he that cometh in the name of
[44:00] the lord hosanna in the highest
[44:03] and when he was coming to jerusalem all
[44:06] the city was moved
[44:10] the whole message was moved everybody
[44:14] was moved
[44:15] who is who was moved and god is about to
[44:18] produce a move
[44:20] that going to shake a short
[44:24] quick message that going to shake
[44:28] the whole nation it's prophesied it's
[44:31] promise
[44:32] oh hallelujah
[44:37] when the cd was coming to jerusalem all
[44:40] the city was moved
[44:42] singing who is this
[44:47] and the multitude said this is jesus the
[44:50] prophet of nazareth of galilee
[44:52] and jesus went into the temple of god
[44:55] and cast out all of them that sold
[44:59] and bought in the temple and overthrew
[45:02] the tables of the money changes and the
[45:04] seats of them that sold doves
[45:06] and said of them it is written by the
[45:08] football he said
[45:09] it is written my father's house shall be
[45:12] called a house of prayer
[45:13] and you have made it to dinner thieves
[45:16] and the blind and the lame came to him
[45:18] in the temple and
[45:19] healed them and when the chief priests
[45:21] and the scribes saw
[45:22] the wonderful things that he did and the
[45:26] children crying in the temple saying
[45:27] hosanna of the son of david they were so
[45:30] displeased
[45:31] if you think people will be pleased with
[45:33] signs wonders miracles
[45:35] with the worship you were wrong they
[45:37] were so displeased
[45:39] who was this please religious people
[45:41] scripture bearing people
[45:43] book reading people tape listening
[45:45] people they would be pleased
[45:46] that's why you can't please man you have
[45:48] to please god
[45:50] you have to listen to the word coming
[45:52] from the mount of god
[45:55] oh give the lord some praises people oh
[45:59] hallelujah hallelujah
[46:03] [Applause]
[46:04] luke 4 14 and jesus returned in the
[46:06] power of the spirit in the galilee
[46:08] they went to the fame of him showed all
[46:10] the regions round about
[46:12] and he taught in the synagogues being
[46:13] glorified of all he came up to nazareth
[46:16] where he had been brought up
[46:17] as it was his customers he went in the
[46:19] synagogue on a saturday and stood for to
[46:21] read
[46:22] and it was delivered unto him the book
[46:24] of the prophet isaiah
[46:26] and he found the place where it was
[46:28] written
[46:29] the spirit ah you see it now so he
[46:32] wasn't just living
[46:33] a flat life a flimsy life a
[46:37] shallow life he was living by the word
[46:40] he found the place not even the
[46:42] scripture being read was a random
[46:44] scripture
[46:45] it was a chosen scripture it's a
[46:47] scripture he found
[46:49] to effect a season change and time
[46:53] and purpose he found the place where it
[46:55] was written
[46:56] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[46:58] because he had anointed me to preach the
[47:00] gospel
[47:01] to the poor he had sent me to heal the
[47:03] brokenhearted to preach deliverance to
[47:05] the captives
[47:06] and recover into the sight of the blind
[47:08] to set that liberty them to the bruce
[47:10] to preach the acceptable year of the
[47:12] lord he closed the book
[47:13] he gave it to the minister sat down and
[47:16] all the eyes of them that when his
[47:17] synagogue were fastening him
[47:19] and he began to say unto him this day is
[47:22] this scripture
[47:23] fulfilled oh glory to god i wonder what
[47:26] you want to see
[47:27] i wonder what the bride gonna say you're
[47:29] waiting for a healing so long but you're
[47:31] gonna say this damn
[47:32] this scripture is fulfilled i was
[47:35] reading
[47:36] about the prophet pray for a woman i
[47:37] think she had some stomach conditions
[47:39] she could need
[47:40] and he prayed for her and she was so
[47:42] sick and for three weeks she going
[47:44] through
[47:44] pain and struggling and whatnot praise
[47:47] god and people mocking her and scuffing
[47:49] her
[47:49] because she was just believing god and
[47:51] trusting god and after a while she just
[47:53] failed to eat something she eat one
[47:54] thing
[47:55] she eats something else and afterwards
[47:56] she recognized she was healed she ran
[47:58] out praising god
[48:00] the prophet said the angel of god listen
[48:02] listen he said the word of healing
[48:04] what happened god said thus saith the
[48:06] lord you shall be healed
[48:08] and that's dusty lord is the word coming
[48:10] out from
[48:11] god when he had thoughts here the lord
[48:13] can't feel
[48:14] for three weeks she is struggling she is
[48:17] looking like she is all sick
[48:18] and after three weeks he said the angel
[48:20] of the lord passed by her neighborhood
[48:23] and fulfilled what god had spoken three
[48:26] weeks before
[48:28] so don't you give up you passed through
[48:30] that prayer line last sunday
[48:32] don't you doubt one moment praise god
[48:35] they shall lay hands on the sheep
[48:37] and they shall be healed
[48:40] [Applause]
[48:43] glory glory to god amen
[48:47] hallelujah praise god you believe that
[48:51] let's continue now in order to have
[48:53] faith
[48:54] faith have to have a basis you can't let
[48:57] faith be loose
[48:58] and wild faith has to rest
[49:01] not upon the shifting signs of man's
[49:04] reasoning
[49:04] but faith is based on the solid rock
[49:08] of god's word so once you have the word
[49:11] the word becomes a platform
[49:12] to rest your faith on it's got to rest
[49:15] on
[49:16] something isn't that right that's why
[49:18] jesus could rely on david's words
[49:21] that's why daniel daniel all these
[49:22] prophets could rely on one another word
[49:24] because they know where the source is
[49:26] they know where it come from
[49:28] it came from the mouth of god so this
[49:31] word man shall not live by bread alone
[49:33] but by every word it is exciting to me
[49:36] it is thrilling to me to know we are
[49:39] called
[49:39] to live by the scripture itself i'm
[49:42] expecting this world
[49:43] to be activated in your spirit to be
[49:46] activated in your soul
[49:47] i expect you to connect with your
[49:50] scripture
[49:51] i expect you to have victory from this
[49:53] day forward
[50:01] so faith is based rest on god's word
[50:05] so faith can float faith after rest
[50:08] i want to say faith can float you have
[50:10] no floating fate
[50:11] it has to rest oh hallelujah on
[50:14] something isn't that right
[50:15] and it must rest on the word so you need
[50:17] the word you need a word
[50:19] from the lord oh hallelujah hallelujah
[50:23] praise god jairus was a secret believer
[50:25] he couldn't confess
[50:26] he really believed the messiah because
[50:28] he was going to kick him out the
[50:29] synagogue
[50:30] they was going to press him out from his
[50:32] special position in church
[50:34] and gave him a backseat somewhere and
[50:36] smallify him that's not a word
[50:38] that doesn't reduce him he's not put

[56:35] every word
[56:37] come on now that proceed out of my mouth
[56:42] peace
[56:47] the bible said in his hands have seven
[56:50] stars
[56:52] or seven messengers seven spirits acting
[56:56] reverse the one spirit working on the
[56:58] will of god in different generations
[57:01] so watch he is holding them
[57:04] it didn't say eight stars 92 stars a
[57:07] hundred stars
[57:08] seven stars and a fivefold star it
[57:11] didn't say that
[57:12] it's a seven stars not seven a quarter
[57:16] not seven or eight just seven
[57:20] because there are only seven ages so god
[57:23] just needs seven
[57:24] stars stars means it's night time
[57:28] stars mean they come to shine light in
[57:31] the time attacks that's when stars has
[57:33] come out
[57:34] because it's all dark so he needs times
[57:36] to shine
[57:37] to show us the light for you it shall be
[57:40] light in the evening time
[57:42] come on give the lord some praise as
[57:44] people oh glory to god hallelujah in his
[57:47] right hand
[57:51] you know what right away they are held
[57:54] in his hand
[57:55] they are associated with his power that
[57:58] is what the hand signifies
[57:59] it signifies the power of god the
[58:02] authority of god
[58:03] not one of them came in his own power
[58:05] and authority
[58:06] that is what paul said it takes the
[58:09] authority of god
[58:11] and the power of the holy ghost the
[58:13] gospel is preached by the authority of
[58:16] god in the power of the spirit
[58:18] these men were all empowered by the holy
[58:20] ghost
[58:21] they all stood up to the world they were
[58:24] full of god
[58:25] they were sent or authorized by
[58:29] god not by self or other men
[58:33] so this is what man said an old man this
[58:36] is god
[58:37] send an old man that's different
[58:42] jesus said here we go this is powerful
[58:45] you got to listen carefully jesus said
[58:48] that when he went away
[58:50] he would send his spirit which the world
[58:53] could not receive that is right
[58:57] the world systems could not receive him
[59:00] that is what organization is
[59:03] it is a world system show me a world
[59:07] system church that is full of the holy
[59:08] ghost
[59:10] i want to see it you will never see it
[59:13] he said if i can show you if you can
[59:15] show me such a church
[59:17] you are finding a mystic in the word not
[59:20] one
[59:20] of these messengers was organized either
[59:23] they were
[59:24] put out or got out because they were
[59:28] convicted of the sin of organization
[59:33] you hear about the sin of adultery and
[59:34] fornication organizations but there's a
[59:36] sin called the sin of
[59:37] organization where men rule men
[59:40] and men they cater men and men anoint
[59:43] themselves crown
[59:44] themselves lay hands on themselves their
[59:46] hands and others
[59:47] that's denomination that's organization
[59:50] that spirit of man
[59:51] where man bring inspiration for the rest
[59:54] of say the same inspiration
[59:55] that is organizational stuff
[59:59] but these men were different they were
[1:00:01] hearing direct from god
[1:00:04] the word of god they brought the
[1:00:07] revelation of
[1:00:08] god as god gave it to them they spoke it
[1:00:11] out
[1:00:12] man shattered by bread alone but by
[1:00:14] everybody that proceed
[1:00:16] out of the mouth of god and god mouth
[1:00:19] was unfolded
[1:00:20] through seven ages so two seven ages he
[1:00:23] had seven
[1:00:24] men that would release a portion of his
[1:00:26] word
[1:00:29] [Applause]
[1:00:32] oh are you with me on this age he sent
[1:00:36] william marion branham
[1:00:38] a 20th century prophet as his mount
[1:00:41] peace
[1:00:41] to release to the entire edge every
[1:00:44] mystery
[1:00:45] that was sealed from the foundation of
[1:00:47] the world
[1:00:50] oh give the lord some praises people
[1:00:54] are you with me hallelujah
[1:00:59] and in revelation 10 the mighty angel
[1:01:00] came in with his book open
[1:01:02] every mystery reveal every mystery
[1:01:04] unfolded the book was open
[1:01:06] it was sealed with seven seals no man
[1:01:08] could look on it no man could touch it
[1:01:10] but the lamb died and take the book and
[1:01:13] lose it on the earth
[1:01:14] and the prophet was there to catch it
[1:01:16] because the word of the lord comes to a
[1:01:18] prophet
[1:01:19] the word of the lord comes to our
[1:01:20] prophet the word of the lord written
[1:01:22] voice word comes to a prophet
[1:01:25] it must be in the book it must be
[1:01:29] written
[1:01:30] that's why i said the seven thunders
[1:01:32] after a while you're gonna find
[1:01:34] where it is written
[1:01:41] [Applause]
[1:01:44] you might be seated so revelation 10 8
[1:01:48] the voice said go to the angel with the
[1:01:50] book
[1:01:52] and eat it because you have to live by
[1:01:54] it
[1:01:55] man channeling my bread alone but by
[1:01:57] every word
[1:01:58] of the open book so once the book is
[1:02:01] open
[1:02:01] you can eat it you can't eat the seal
[1:02:04] book you have to eat the open book
[1:02:06] and once the mystery is revealed you can
[1:02:08] eat it because the secret things belong
[1:02:10] to god
[1:02:11] but the things that are revealed belong
[1:02:13] to us
[1:02:14] and to our children that we may do the
[1:02:16] whole works of the lord
[1:02:18] so once it's revealed that's ours
[1:02:21] that's mine give me my mountain
[1:02:24] come on now church are you getting it
[1:02:28] are you seeing it
[1:02:40] to these men either they were put out
[1:02:44] got out because they were convicted of
[1:02:47] the sin of organization
[1:02:49] how can the holy spirit possibly be
[1:02:52] in an organization when it is
[1:02:55] organization
[1:02:56] that takes the place of the spirit and
[1:02:59] the nomination
[1:03:00] take the place of the word remember
[1:03:03] organization is dead
[1:03:04] [Music]
[1:03:06] if the world takes over the spirit
[1:03:08] departs
[1:03:09] here we go yes the spirit is not seven
[1:03:12] spirits but one
[1:03:14] he will always be the same and act the
[1:03:16] same
[1:03:17] and the seven messengers will have the
[1:03:20] same spirit
[1:03:22] and teach the same word and have the
[1:03:25] same power
[1:03:27] and if the true church is the true
[1:03:29] church
[1:03:30] it will have the very same spirit and
[1:03:33] word
[1:03:33] and acts of power that they had of
[1:03:36] pentecost
[1:03:37] by experience it is a pentecostal church
[1:03:40] there will be tongues
[1:03:41] interpretations prophecy healings
[1:03:44] god will be in the midst of her god will
[1:03:46] declare himself in the midst of her
[1:03:48] as he always has and he will she will be
[1:03:51] unorganized
[1:03:52] don't forget that we have some more to
[1:03:55] say
[1:03:55] so sit at the edge of your seat and
[1:03:57] listen carefully
[1:04:00] now we see that jesus christ
[1:04:03] is revealing himself through the ages by
[1:04:06] his spirit in the messengers
[1:04:08] they are as moses was to the children of
[1:04:10] israel
[1:04:11] he had the revelation for his day
[1:04:15] here we go so each messenger has
[1:04:18] god's revelation and ministry for that
[1:04:20] day
[1:04:21] thus when we see that the messengers are
[1:04:25] in his hand we see the lord
[1:04:28] identifying himself with these men and
[1:04:31] granting them his power
[1:04:34] it is not enough that he has associated
[1:04:37] himself
[1:04:38] with the whole church which we saw when
[1:04:41] he was standing again among the seven
[1:04:42] golden alarm stands
[1:04:44] no it is even enough here we go
[1:04:47] there's a ton there's a bomb here
[1:04:51] now is it enough that we see the
[1:04:53] fivefold ministry of ephesians 4
[1:04:55] apostles prophets teachers evangelist
[1:04:58] pastors
[1:04:59] for in each age the church
[1:05:03] goes astray but it is not just a laity
[1:05:08] but the clergy group that
[1:05:11] bunch so-called fightfolder he said the
[1:05:14] shepherds are wrong
[1:05:15] as well as the sheep so when you hear
[1:05:19] the church go straight
[1:05:20] it's not just a bunch of laity go on the
[1:05:23] street
[1:05:24] it's shepherds and she
[1:05:29] then god brings himself on the scene
[1:05:33] as the chief shepherd in the ministry of
[1:05:37] these seven
[1:05:38] men to lead his people back to the truth
[1:05:42] [Applause]
[1:05:46] or give the lord a praise offering
[1:05:50] [Applause]
[1:05:52] [Music]
[1:05:54] so religious men spiritual men pastor
[1:05:56] revised them what not
[1:05:57] the start of god in the world afterwards
[1:05:59] the backsliding tyrant and they formed
[1:06:01] church
[1:06:02] big steeple
[1:06:05] i always see medini and gordon send some
[1:06:07] men to bring the word
[1:06:10] luther wesley columba all and bring the
[1:06:11] word to them these men bringing light
[1:06:14] for the age isn't that right isn't
[1:06:16] something else
[1:06:18] seven churches set forth
[1:06:21] if ephesus murder program is for the
[1:06:24] left lauder
[1:06:26] he said he had an ear
[1:06:29] let him hear what the spirit
[1:06:34] is saying to the ages to the churches
[1:06:37] notice here that jesus by the spirit
[1:06:40] in every age addresses himself to one
[1:06:43] person
[1:06:45] relative to the word for that age here
[1:06:47] we go
[1:06:48] are you ready listen to his statement
[1:06:52] only one messenger for each age
[1:06:57] receives what the spirit has to say
[1:07:00] for that age
[1:07:05] one messenger receive all for the entire
[1:07:12] age
[1:07:14] [Applause]
[1:07:19] [Music]
[1:07:21] one man in the age receive all for the
[1:07:25] entire age
[1:07:26] so the aid stands stretch strands 400
[1:07:28] years
[1:07:29] what he says is this time for 400 years
[1:07:33] because the word for the entire age
[1:07:36] one man a man sent from god a man in his
[1:07:39] right hand
[1:07:40] one of the seven stars one of the seven
[1:07:42] voices one of the seven messages
[1:07:44] one of the seven messengers every single
[1:07:47] one
[1:07:48] had the entire revelation of god
[1:07:51] for the entire age
[1:07:59] and in the last day every mystery
[1:08:02] revealed
[1:08:04] the book opened god sent a 20th century
[1:08:07] prophet with the entire revelation
[1:08:10] of the entire age
[1:08:12] [Applause]
[1:08:18] oh can we give the lord our worship do
[1:08:20] you see that now
[1:08:22] man shall everybody alone
[1:08:26] but by every word that proceed out of
[1:08:27] the mouth
[1:08:29] of god now watch
[1:08:33] therefore any man
[1:08:37] coming after that prophet can only be an
[1:08:40] echo of what the prophet said
[1:08:45] no man could bring a further revelation
[1:08:48] a new
[1:08:48] revelation a stimulating revelation
[1:08:52] no additional revelation to what the
[1:08:54] prophet has brought
[1:08:55] because the prophet brought the entire
[1:08:58] [Applause]
[1:09:02] i feel like dancing when the spirit of
[1:09:05] the lord
[1:09:06] comes upon my heart and i'm going to
[1:09:09] dance like david
[1:09:10] dance
[1:09:10] [Applause]
[1:09:18] i'll say it again any man
[1:09:22] coming after the prophet could only be
[1:09:24] an
[1:09:25] echo can it be a messenger
[1:09:28] can it be another voice it's the same
[1:09:31] voice
[1:09:32] it is one voice let me bust on you the
[1:09:34] spirit only have one voice
[1:09:36] [Applause]
[1:09:38] the spirit only have one voice
[1:09:42] [Applause]
[1:09:46] and that what's meant that one messenger
[1:09:49] is the messenger to the true church
[1:09:51] he speak for god by revelation to the
[1:09:54] churches
[1:09:56] both true and false
[1:10:00] the message is broadcast to all
[1:10:03] but though it is broadcast for all who
[1:10:06] come within
[1:10:07] range of the message that message
[1:10:11] is received individually
[1:10:14] by only a certain qualified group
[1:10:18] in a certain way each individual
[1:10:22] of that group is one who has the ability
[1:10:27] to hear what the spirit is saying
[1:10:31] by way of the messenger those who
[1:10:34] here are not getting their own private
[1:10:39] revelations
[1:10:42] oh
[1:10:44] hallelujah glory to god amen
[1:10:48] hit the ball out the pack hallelujah
[1:10:52] those who here are not getting their own
[1:10:54] private revelation
[1:10:56] nor is the group getting the collective
[1:10:59] revelation
[1:11:01] each person is hearing what the
[1:11:03] messenger has
[1:11:04] already received from god
[1:11:08] now give the lord a big shout
[1:11:14] glory oh this is good this is good
[1:11:18] this has got you may be seasoned after
[1:11:21] 110 years
[1:11:23] somebody want to come and check out
[1:11:25] noah's service
[1:11:27] to find out what's new noah comes behind
[1:11:31] the pulpit
[1:11:32] i say my scripture for the day is it
[1:11:35] will rain
[1:11:36] my word for today is it will rain my
[1:11:39] subject today
[1:11:40] as it will rain my inspiration it's
[1:11:42] still going to rain
[1:11:43] i am prophesying from what god told me
[1:11:47] it's going to rain but no i heard you
[1:11:50] talked that 110 years before
[1:11:52] he said wait there's a more time coming
[1:11:54] but it's still going to rain
[1:11:56] you won't see it yet you ain't feel it
[1:11:58] yet it didn't interpret yet
[1:12:00] it's not fulfilled yet but it's coming
[1:12:03] because once it is spoken
[1:12:05] it's got to come to pass and the
[1:12:07] manifestation
[1:12:08] is the interpretation we don't know man
[1:12:10] to interpret
[1:12:11] what the prophet already took it for us
[1:12:13] we don't need no man's spirit
[1:12:15] to be loosed among us we reject that we
[1:12:18] cast that out

[1:31:18] there spreads the light through
[1:31:22] the ministry of others who have been
[1:31:24] faithfully taught
[1:31:26] so the messenger brings the light and
[1:31:29] from that
[1:31:30] light others draw to preach
[1:31:33] but of course here we go all those who
[1:31:36] go out
[1:31:37] don't always learn how necessary it is
[1:31:42] to speak only what the messenger has
[1:31:45] spoken
[1:31:47] remember paul warned the people to say
[1:31:49] only what he said
[1:31:50] first corinthians 14 37 if any man think
[1:31:53] himself to be a prophet or spiritual
[1:31:55] let him acknowledge that the things that
[1:31:56] i write unto you are the commandments of
[1:31:59] the lord
[1:32:00] what came the word of the lord from you
[1:32:02] or came unto you only
[1:32:03] they added here they take over there and
[1:32:06] soon the message is no longer pure
[1:32:09] the revival dies down how careful we
[1:32:11] must be
[1:32:12] to hear one voice here we go
[1:32:15] for the spirit has but one voice
[1:32:18] which is the voice of god
[1:32:22] even paul said he couldn't change what
[1:32:24] he had said
[1:32:27] he said if we or an angel come down from
[1:32:30] heaven and preach
[1:32:31] any other thing let him be accused
[1:32:34] [Applause]
[1:32:35] paul said i can't change what came out
[1:32:38] from the mouth of god
[1:32:40] do you not hear what i'm saying
[1:32:44] when god spoke to his mouth he can't
[1:32:46] change it
[1:32:49] this is real you are going to be
[1:32:52] delivered
[1:32:54] [Applause]
[1:32:58] glory listen to this he didn't
[1:33:02] he had an alien here with the spirits in
[1:33:03] the churches in every age
[1:33:05] it was the same cry hear what the spirit
[1:33:09] says
[1:33:10] if you are christian you will get back
[1:33:13] to what the spirit is teaching
[1:33:15] that is the word for this age every
[1:33:18] messenger to every age will preach the
[1:33:20] word
[1:33:21] every fresh here we go are you ready
[1:33:23] every fresh and true revelation
[1:33:25] will be because men have gotten back to
[1:33:28] the word for their age
[1:33:30] the cry of every age is a rebuke you
[1:33:32] have left the word
[1:33:33] of god repent come back to the word
[1:33:36] from the first book in the bible genesis
[1:33:38] to the last book of revelation
[1:33:40] there's only one reason for god
[1:33:42] displeasure that is leaving the word
[1:33:45] oh blessed be the name of the lord he
[1:33:48] said these men
[1:33:49] he said they they were denounced by um
[1:33:51] by organization
[1:33:52] now it is not hard to stand up and keep
[1:33:54] true to a creed
[1:33:55] it is easy for the devil is right behind
[1:33:58] all that
[1:33:59] but it's something else to stay with the
[1:34:01] true word
[1:34:02] oh praise god could you what we all i'm
[1:34:05] going to hit the home stretch now
[1:34:06] let's look at uh jeremiah chapter 23.
[1:34:09] you'd have to find it but if you want to
[1:34:10] read with me i want to read
[1:34:12] some scripture to show you god's
[1:34:13] thinking god's thoughts
[1:34:16] god mine considering pastors
[1:34:21] concerning sheep let's look at jeremiah
[1:34:24] chapter 23 we read war beyond to the
[1:34:25] pastors
[1:34:28] wow is that real i thought all pastors
[1:34:32] are lovely men
[1:34:34] saints of god men of the cloth
[1:34:39] and god said woe unto the men of the
[1:34:41] cloth
[1:34:42] pastors that destroy scattered the sheep
[1:34:45] of my pasture sea of the lord
[1:34:47] therefore thus saith the lord god of
[1:34:49] israel against the pastor to feed my
[1:34:52] people ye have scattered my flock
[1:34:54] driven them away have not visited them
[1:34:57] behold i will visit upon you
[1:35:01] the evil of your doing said the lord
[1:35:04] and i will gather the remnant of my
[1:35:06] flock out of all countries when i have
[1:35:08] driven them
[1:35:08] i will bring them into their forums and
[1:35:11] they shall be fruitful
[1:35:13] and increased i will set up shepherds
[1:35:16] over them
[1:35:16] that would feed them and they shall fear
[1:35:19] no more
[1:35:20] nor be dismayed neither shall they be
[1:35:22] lacking saith the lord
[1:35:24] behold the days come share the lord and
[1:35:26] i will raise up david a righteous branch
[1:35:28] and the king shall reign and prosper
[1:35:30] shall execute judgment and justice in
[1:35:32] the earth
[1:35:33] in his days judah shall be saved and
[1:35:35] right and israel shall dwell in safety
[1:35:37] and this is his name whereby he shall be
[1:35:39] called the lord or
[1:35:40] righteousness therefore behold the days
[1:35:42] come say the lord
[1:35:43] they shall no more say the lord liver
[1:35:45] which brought up the children of israel
[1:35:47] or the land of egypt but the lord lived
[1:35:49] which brought up and which
[1:35:50] led the seed of the house of israel out
[1:35:52] of the north country
[1:35:54] from all countries whether i have driven
[1:35:55] them and they shall dwell in their own
[1:35:57] land
[1:35:58] my heart within me is broken because of
[1:36:01] the prophets
[1:36:02] all my bones shake i'm like a drunk man
[1:36:05] like a man whose mind have overcome
[1:36:08] because the lord because of the lord and
[1:36:10] because the words of his holiness
[1:36:11] for the land is full of adulterers for
[1:36:13] because of swearing the land mourn it
[1:36:15] the pleasant place of the wilderness are
[1:36:17] dried up their course is evil
[1:36:19] when their force is not right for both
[1:36:22] prophet and priests are profane yeah
[1:36:24] in my house i found a wickedness here
[1:36:26] the lord
[1:36:27] wherefore their way shall be unto them
[1:36:30] are slippery ways
[1:36:31] of darkness they shall be driven on and
[1:36:33] fall therein for i will bring
[1:36:35] evil upon them even the year of their
[1:36:38] visitation that's what people don't know
[1:36:40] say at the lord i have seen the folly
[1:36:44] in the prophets of samaria prophets now
[1:36:47] they prophesy in baal and caused my
[1:36:50] people israel to earth
[1:36:52] i have seen the prophets of jerusalem
[1:36:55] a horrible thing to commit adultery
[1:36:58] walking lies
[1:36:59] listen they strengthen the hands of the
[1:37:01] evildoers
[1:37:03] that none return from his wickedness the
[1:37:05] all
[1:37:06] of them unto me as sodom and an
[1:37:08] inhabitants of gomorrah
[1:37:10] therefore thus saith the lord of hosts
[1:37:13] concerning the prophets behold i will
[1:37:14] feed them with one wood and make them
[1:37:17] drink water of gall
[1:37:19] for from the prophets of jerusalem it's
[1:37:21] profane it's going forth all the land
[1:37:23] thus here the lord of hosts listen here
[1:37:26] we go
[1:37:27] hack not unto the words of the prophets
[1:37:29] that prophesy unto you
[1:37:31] they make you vain they speak a vision
[1:37:34] of their own heart
[1:37:36] and not out of the mouth of the lord
[1:37:38] they say
[1:37:40] they say still unto them that despise me
[1:37:42] watch the lord said he shall have peace
[1:37:46] and they say unto everyone that walketh
[1:37:47] in the imagination their own heart
[1:37:49] no evil shall come upon you for who had
[1:37:52] stood in the conscience of the lord
[1:37:53] and perceive and heard his word who had
[1:37:55] marked his word and heard it
[1:37:57] behold a whirlwind of the lord has gone
[1:37:59] forth and fury
[1:38:00] in my grievous world when it shall fall
[1:38:02] grievously upon the head of the wicked
[1:38:04] the anger of the lord shall not return
[1:38:06] until you have executed
[1:38:08] till they have performed the torts of
[1:38:10] his heart in the latter days he shall
[1:38:11] consider it perfectly
[1:38:12] i have not sent
[1:38:16] these prophets yet they ran
[1:38:19] i have not spoken to them
[1:38:22] yet they prophesied but if they had
[1:38:25] stood in my counsel
[1:38:26] and it caused my people to hear my words
[1:38:29] then
[1:38:30] they should have turned them from the
[1:38:31] evil ways
[1:38:33] and from evil doings am i a god at hand
[1:38:37] saith the lord or a god of heroes can
[1:38:40] any hide himself
[1:38:41] in secret places and i shall not see him
[1:38:44] seared the lord
[1:38:45] do i not fill heaven on earth see at the
[1:38:47] lord i have heard that what the prophet
[1:38:49] said
[1:38:49] that prophesy lies in my name i have
[1:38:52] dreamed
[1:38:52] i have dreamed how long shall this be in
[1:38:55] the heart of the prophets
[1:38:56] the prophesy lies yea they are prophets
[1:38:59] of deceit of their own heart
[1:39:01] which think to cause my people to forget
[1:39:04] my name
[1:39:05] by their dreams which should tell every
[1:39:06] man to his neighbor as their fathers i
[1:39:08] forgot my name for their
[1:39:10] the prophet that had a dream let him
[1:39:12] tell a dream he said that my word
[1:39:14] let him speak my word faithfully what is
[1:39:16] chuffed the wheat
[1:39:17] saith the lord is not my word like a
[1:39:19] fire said the lord
[1:39:21] i like a hammer that break the rock in
[1:39:22] pieces dear for behold
[1:39:24] i am against the prophets saith the lord
[1:39:27] that steal my words
[1:39:28] everyone from his neighbor behold i'm
[1:39:30] against the prophet saith the lord that
[1:39:32] used their tongues and said he said
[1:39:33] behold i'm against them that prophesy
[1:39:36] false dreams
[1:39:37] saith the lord and do tell them and
[1:39:39] cause my people to er
[1:39:40] by their lies and by their likeness yet
[1:39:43] i
[1:39:43] sent them not nor commanded them
[1:39:45] therefore they shall not prophet these
[1:39:47] people at all
[1:39:48] say the lord may god bless his word i
[1:39:50] read that to you
[1:39:52] to let you know how god sees things
[1:39:55] is not as man sees it it's as god sees
[1:39:58] it
[1:39:59] we need to get back to the word from the
[1:40:01] mouth of god
[1:40:03] because when god speaks it's got to come
[1:40:05] to pass
[1:40:06] isn't that right i'm about to close
[1:40:09] i want to ask you something bro i'm
[1:40:11] saying joe witness is loyal to what they
[1:40:12] believe
[1:40:13] the baptist is loyal to what they
[1:40:14] believe why can't we be loyal to the
[1:40:17] word
[1:40:18] to the word i want to ask you something
[1:40:21] you say well brother mannam
[1:40:22] how do you know they are not now if
[1:40:24] those pharisees and sadducees and
[1:40:25] leaders of that day
[1:40:27] museum come please that would have got
[1:40:29] away from their creeds
[1:40:31] and their dogmas and listen to what the
[1:40:33] word said
[1:40:34] what jesus was telling them just exactly
[1:40:38] but listen this part they taught so much
[1:40:41] of their leaders it wasn't batman
[1:40:43] they wouldn't lie still cost anything
[1:40:45] like that they wouldn't do that
[1:40:46] they wouldn't come adultery certainly
[1:40:48] not they would witness why
[1:40:50] they were good men but the only thing
[1:40:53] there was a
[1:40:54] spiritual man oh hallelujah
[1:40:57] oh hallelujah i'm closing a momentary
[1:41:00] consideration of the church history with
[1:41:02] proof
[1:41:03] god sent the word in looters day luther
[1:41:06] spoke for god at that time
[1:41:07] they organized again pure word was lost
[1:41:10] for organization tends towards dogma
[1:41:12] increased the not simple word
[1:41:14] they could no longer speak for god then
[1:41:16] god sent wesley
[1:41:17] he was the voice with the word in that
[1:41:19] day the people who took his revelation
[1:41:20] from god became living epistles
[1:41:22] read alone of all men for their
[1:41:24] generation when the methodists failed
[1:41:26] god raised up others so it has gone on
[1:41:28] through the years until
[1:41:30] again there's another people in the land
[1:41:32] who under their messenger
[1:41:34] that same one messenger will be the
[1:41:36] final voice
[1:41:37] to the final age here we go are you
[1:41:39] ready the church
[1:41:40] is no longer the more peace of god it is
[1:41:44] own more peace so god is turning on her
[1:41:48] he will confound her through the prophet
[1:41:50] and the bride
[1:41:52] for the voice of god will be in her oh
[1:41:54] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:41:56] praise god and look as i close
[1:42:00] samuel eli rather old priest isn't that
[1:42:04] right
[1:42:05] samuel a young man the priest saw all
[1:42:08] in the message at that time he couldn't
[1:42:10] have the ability to hear from god
[1:42:12] so god find this young man samuel begin
[1:42:14] to speak to him
[1:42:15] because samuel and his sons were doing
[1:42:17] evil in sight of god and so on isn't
[1:42:19] that right
[1:42:20] and he said no the work has been done he
[1:42:22] said and today one reason that the
[1:42:23] church is in the condition it's in
[1:42:25] is because there are so many voices so
[1:42:27] many voices attract the church from the
[1:42:28] voice of god
[1:42:30] so it's very doubtful that many would
[1:42:32] even hear the voice
[1:42:33] of god though it spoke right in the
[1:42:35] midst the past wouldn't even understand
[1:42:37] it
[1:42:38] there are so many voices on the earth
[1:42:39] today that is absolutely a hard thing
[1:42:42] because it deadened the voice of the
[1:42:44] supernatural
[1:42:45] oh my there are so many intellectual
[1:42:48] voices
[1:42:49] great voices of mighty men who are
[1:42:50] intellectual and in that intellectual
[1:42:52] condition they even shake nations
[1:42:54] they are not overnight prisons but they
[1:42:57] shake nations
[1:42:58] and it will bring confusion and so forth
[1:43:00] and their voices raise up
[1:43:02] and it causes the voice of god to be
[1:43:04] placed somewhere
[1:43:05] the truth from the true voice of god and
[1:43:08] the voice of god they say how will we
[1:43:10] know is the voice of god
[1:43:11] because today it wasn't a vindicated
[1:43:13] prophet now today
[1:43:14] how do we know is the voice of god are
[1:43:16] we ready
[1:43:17] because it's a manifestation of the
[1:43:19] prophet's word
[1:43:20] this is god's prophet and a true voice
[1:43:23] of god
[1:43:24] only brings back that real living
[1:43:26] supernatural god
[1:43:28] with a supernatural word with the
[1:43:29] supernatural manifestation of the true
[1:43:31] word
[1:43:32] that's the voice of god may the lord
[1:43:34] richly bless you
[1:43:35] oh praise the name of the lord
