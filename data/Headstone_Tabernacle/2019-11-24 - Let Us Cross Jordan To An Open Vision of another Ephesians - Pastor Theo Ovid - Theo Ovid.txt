know prophecy one day will be walked we'd be talking and love we're just dropping in the building and all the evil be taken out praise God do you believe that oh praise the name of the Lord okay before we get in the would have something to read this is on our Facebook page and it's something from the our of go deliverance it's much in time you know it's fashion time he said took my brother I don't care whether my shoes match my trousers my trousers much my coat I want my experience to match God's Bible isn't that right and if you want to match something much experience against Paul's that's what we need is a match in time but Paul's feet in the Bible that's an example right real match in time don't try to match enable much some of these scenes of the Bible are you ready and if you are sinned act like a saint walk like a saint dress like a scene talk like a saint pre like a scene believe like a saint shout like a saint be like a saint live like a saint die like a saint and go to heaven like a scene [Applause] [Music] or glory to God say heaven gonna be expecting you to come to the door like a scene so you don't have to say he ain't a scene you want to be a scene a sanctified one one that is separated onto God hallelujah friend or no friend or husband or no husband wife and a wife children no children where they have the support of your family or not you belong to God hallelujah go to any lawyer to come true however come true but you belong to God your flesh and your face may resemble mommy and daddy but you belong to God that flesh come from the dust and that does go right back to the dust but at Jean and not your soul that come from God isn't that right o blessed be the name of the Lord so I'm excited this morning i tongue God for last week's service I rarely thoroughly enjoy that but being focus I'm going back past giggle and Bethel and Jericho and pressing your way to that purpose in God for your life and something ought to call you the press and master Balaram says a person can't get desperate and goal until God speaks to them and you come here for God to speak to you amens a lot of stand as we want to go into the word wanna turn to 2nd Kings chapter 2 wanna read from verse 6 to eat Joshua chapter 1 wanna read verse 1 2 3 and 3 6 I wanna read Matthew chapter 4 verse 1 and verse 14 so that's cool too second Kings to six an Elisha said unto him talk talk and speak until I shall bury I pray thee here for the Lord has sent me to Jordan and he said as the Lord liveth and as I so live it I will not leave thee and the two went on and fifty of the sons of the prophets went and stood to view afar off and did to stood by Jordan and Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smooth the waters and they were divided hither and thither so that d2 went over on dry ground Joshua chapter 1 now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord came to pass that the Lord speak unto Joshua the son of nun Moses the minister seen Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan am gone and all these people unto the land which I do give unto them even to the children of Israel every place that is full of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses verse 6 be strong of a good courage for onto disc people shall doubt divide for an inheritance the land which I swear on that their fathers to give them let's look at Matthew chapter 4 reading verse 1 then we go to verse 14 then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil verse 14 okay oh praise the Lord okay sorry it's supposed to be Luke actually Luke chapter 4 verse 1 and verse 14 I'm sorry Luke chapter 1 and Jesus being Luke chapter 4 verse 1 and Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness verse 14 and Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit unto Galilee and they went out of Fame of him wrong about throughout all the regions wrong the bow let us pray father we thank you for your word and we pray of calm down and especially and speak to our hearts in Jesus name I ask it amen and he made you may be seated oh praise the Lord so I guess I was looking at those two scriptures what does them have it but I wanted to get that one and somehow end up with you know Matthew amen we have a title this morning let us cross Jordan to an open vision of another Ephesians let us cross Jordan to an open vision of another Ephesians and have an inspiration before the bride returns in power that is what my inspiration is before the bride returns in power now I want you to turn your Bibles to first John chapter 2 I want you to follow me with this context scripture reading from verse 15 to 16 first John chapter 2 reading from verse 15 to 16 and John is right after Peter we was 15 says love not the world neither the things that are in the world If any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the Father but is of the world and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever I want to read that one again for all the 16 for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the Father but is of the world may God bless his word and praise God blessed be the name of the Lord and this is brother Branham from God called man he was saying before prayer I would like to ask this question to people inside out how many in here sincerely would like to go with Jesus down to Jordan tonight and dare cross over there where you could see a vision and see what God really means would you raise your hands god bless you go down to Jordan not down to a seminary Elijah pass right by that tyree here I don't want to that's man-made it's never quenched that taste of a man who is to stand for God a seminary or information can never quench that tooth that a man have for God he says what we need you can get men all to themselves away from their school of theology are we from their self-styled ways fearless men men of character with you who believes you and take you at your word and he's praying God many of them standing here present that will give all they got to the Lord Jesus and sell o the world go pass Giga the place of confession Christian beginnings go past the school of the prophets that set back there with theology and go to Jordan to an open vision and when the cross and find that God still lives do you believe that oh praise the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord but the trouble today is that ministers very few ministers are trying to establish Christ in the people's heart very few ministers is trying to do that they are trying to establish themselves their ministry who they are their idea their interpretation very few are establishing the Word of God isn't that right because Eve had a lust that loss was foreknowledge is not right and but urbana me spoke about that isn't that right it was wrong for her to do that and we finally what happened there isn't that right and the ministers today supposed to be established in Christ in the people's heart not the church not their ministries not their ideas but Christ and crisis the world so once the word is preached without being flavor and have an interpretation to it you are getting Christ the world because in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God isn't that something else so Jesus Christ isn't that right when he was 12 years old he knew he was about the father's business he was in the channel of the will of God he was a son 12 years old no unit I must be about my father's business it take him 18 years to ripen to comment the position to be positionally please by the pillar of fire by charity at the Jordan River could somebody see a man is not right so during those years of silence he wasn't idle he was doing something he was in the world we attend to fulfill the word during those eight years of silence Jesus was getting a revelation of what the father has to work for his life Oh glory to God in many many many men glory to God they come actively will fake a licen you want to get the lines and drive a car you see a teen or whatever and you want you have to get the information first how you go about gets a man you're getting your documents it gets in your ID card and so on and then you have to find out you have a booklet of the regulations that you have to pass you have to get that deed set but you're not a driver yet did not approve yet did not confirm yet when you get your learner's know you get to go and get you test drive and so on but you're not to prove yet this there's a pass a test in the yeah to see if it could reverse well under your three-point turn and Danny if you don't pass there you can't even go out so you got to pass the first test before you go out in the road because you have a weapon call a car and they can't lose you just like that and you kind of drive so they have to test you first and when you pass the inside test your God for the outside s and then you get approved but that's what we're talking about you could sit and study home to drive what kind of car to drive if you don't go and pass you the process you are not writing to drive because somebody say man you could preach how nice driving is you can explain how to do it but until you go and do it then do it yet so before you come back in power there is something has to take place before this super church and super race and spoken word doing this and doing that I when the press come down watch them before all of that or get the Lord a shout out before [Applause] just before all of that we want to get down to that this morning oh praise God amen hallelujah glory to God hallelujah originally in Genesis the instructions was for man's have dominion over the fish beasts birds what spirit man Genesis - there was no - of the soil but that real man Remis always a real man real man was no flesh man real man was spirit man and God but real man into Flashman man became a living soul but the original real man was spirit man spirit was leading man no we are man leading but it was leading man now we are flesh leading or give the Lord a shoulder press so if let me see that if we're gonna come back to Genesis if we're gonna come back to original we have to get back the way the split leads man Jesus was led by the spirit come on album come on now where he was going in the spirit oh he was going to power but yet I brought the past [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he was led by the spirit into the wilderness [Applause] so Jesus come on you have to demonstrate he had power over himself [Music] before his ministry could take off because he put any final gear let that engine Rumble through before that car took off he added us to demonstrate he had power over himself because John described all that is in the world [Music] all that is in the world is under lots of the eyes it's either on the loss of the flesh or it's under the pride of life every sin every wickedness every evil is on the one of that I'm not hearing you this morning I'm not hearing you this morning every issue be it government bein kingdoms be it family be it neighbors being on the job is one of them [Applause] most of the ass lust of the flesh and the pride of life Oh hallelujah somebody said break it down like that hallelujah hallelujah Oh glory to God thank you Jesus proverbs 6 1619 these six things that God heap [Music] yeah 7a an abomination to him number one a proud look here's a pride alone because he could see pride you see somebody can walk with pride and people don't know that's on the inside because they can walk with a head down under proud but God hates proud look that has to do with the pride of life that have to do with you feeling superior to others and you seen others inferior to you come on same as somebody God [Music] [Applause] ivi believers in the house [Applause] god is a proud look a lying tongue hands that shed innocent blood a heart that devises wicked imaginations feet that be swift around the mischief of false witness that speaketh lies and he that soweth discord among brethren [Applause] [Music] God hates that God hates that you see you don't have to be agree with me to be my bedroom to have the same doctrine to be brethren I'm telling you I am NOT hearing you even families have fights even brothers and sisters have fights brothers and brothers have [Applause] family courts family let's fight or give the Lord a shout inside of here Oh blow me no God give the Lord a show yes you're right right let's fight but after the fight is over we are still family come on now come on Oh save me somebody let's fight for what is right let's fight for the faith that was once delivered we are gonna fight we pledge to love the present Oh hallelujah Tori Tori decorum and amen Oh Gloria no God you may not like me but I love God human unlikely but I love the word I'm not here for like and compassed represent the kingdom Oh hallelujah which Kingdom the kingdom of the Most High God or get the law some princess people Oh hallelujah all [Music] right you may be seated this is actually a continuation from last week so if you didn't give us week trip get it go and hear it you need to hear it oh my glory hallelujah I [Applause] want to look at Luke for a little bit could find it you'd want to find it Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan Jordan seemed to be connected to all this thing boy now you have to put on Jordan Jesus hid this Jordan Jesus or hidden Jordan oh my Joshua at across Jordan what what is beyond this Jordan why we have to go past Jordan why why because Canada pants and just watch over yonder Oh hallelujah why is that because Jordan represents dead Jardine represent a new day in your life when you cross Jordan is a new inspiration is a a new you have that passed this way before if any man be enticed is a new new create Jordan Jesus full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the ministers Association and toured a bit on the world no he was inspired to call a convention to discuss his Jordan no he was led by the spirit into the wilderness being forty days tempted of the devil and in those days he eat nothing and when they were ended he hungered here we go lust of the flesh he is hungry and the devil come why are you hungry to tempt Jesus the devil said unto him if thou be the Son of God command this stone to be meat bread you could do the sangwich there's only stones all wrong and if you are who you are which know you could do something but Jesus wasn't commanded to follow the instructions or the leaving of sita jesus answered him saying it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God he overcame the lust of the flesh by the word he is gaining dominion over himself that that cannot be enslaved the hip and sleeve him watch Dever take him up to a high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of tang lust of the eyes what a temptation what you I could see all of this is mine I guess the Devi had never had a projector there and he was a cool scream the extreme and all the kingdoms of this fools and mine and the Devas and under him all this power will I give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever I will give it he's talking big he's not talking like if he doesn't have it you know in charge and he said yeah you know me I could fix you right if thou therefore will worship me all shall be dying what he was seeing with his eyes jesus answered and said unto him get thee behind me Satan for it is written thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only go shalt serve [Applause] now Satan went on deep he'd no man I mean is hundreds of years have been delivered man man love himself a lot it could be very proud and he brought him to Jerusalem Sita set him on a pinnacle of a temple and said unto him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down from there another word sure sure who you are because it is written he shall give his angels charge over thee now if you take that head thing if you take that basket as we the cnj not if you take that basket as if this is oh it's written on your question everybody look for the angel told me he was gonna feel that this but Jesus told the devil and in their hands what you decide theory uh police at any time those are - I fought against a stone so the devil listen if you not we need scriptures devil is [Music] because he could quote it back to try to tie up and Jesus said ancestor unto Him it is said thou shalt not tempt the LORD thy God and when the devil was ended all the temptation he departed from whom a season and I hope we get to verse 14 so before you return in power all that is in the world you have to face the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life but you are going to overcome because there's a prophecy that the bride will cross Jordan and quadriceps future joshua's to take the people over Jordan you don't have to cross trollin alone [Applause] bridge [Applause] Oh blessed be the name of the Lord Laurita God so Jesus proved he had control and dominion over his human spirit by overcoming the lust of the ants by overcoming Ellis of the flesh by overcoming the pride of life isn't that right and before adopted son could have dominion over others and other things you must display to me and over yourself therefore it doesn't matter what church you go to but reading doesn't change you your behavior does come on save me somebody oh yes oh yes people believe because what they believe will take them true but around them teach that he say a got to apply the token random Tabernacle hallelujah you can't say I believe a prophet you believe Moses and you're not applying the blood Moses said take a lamb Moses said kill the lamb Moses said take the blood Moses said apply the blood and the blood shall be upon when I see the but I'm gonna pass over you that's what moves his head for glory to God I can't tell you what I feel after tell you what God said come on same as somebody I can feel sorry for you but what did God say we're not cause the dressings by our feelings and by emotions we are called are just things by the word underworld only sobre Romani must be born again you said you might get up from there and do anything you might dance in the spirit you might cry like anybody could cry you might run up and down the floor you might join every Church you might do anything you want to and go right back and defile a man's wife and break up a man's home some of you woman you will go right back no matter how much the world comes to you to do right you won't recognize it you'll never let your hair grow you will never dress right you'll still be exactly like the world because you are not dead to the world yet [Applause] you are alive with it some of you men will never put drinking smoking you will never put lust enough to follow many morally dressed when you see them on the street instead of filling your heads and walking away you will still lust right on just the same because you are alive with the world but when that sacrifice has been received you he didn't say when you fast he didn't say when you pray he didn't say when you call him some Hill or some mountain somewhere all by yourself he's not talking about that he's talking about something supernatural [Applause] you may be seasoned you see if you could stop smoking that is you if you can stop drinking that they still you [Applause] but when fire comes and receive your sacrifice that's him then the desire for sinners burnt out it's no longer dear then the devil has no power over the blood wash ones I'm not

to 7 in the days of the seungyun of the 7 angels message the mystery of God shall be finished there we go are you ready the hidden mystery of Revelation 10 1 2 7 the last message to the last church age what is rubbish until Monday 7 the last message to the last age is the seven thunders the angel came down not with the book closed with six seals but people open that mean all seven seas was pulled back to the injured came over the book open and seven thunders show their voices out hallelujah that was a message that will travel bright together what about how to repair give the bride fate that was that message right there that is the last message if the Lord a show to praise cap is the capstone revelation of Jesus Christ [Applause] LeBron I'm calling the last message exactly fulfill the D when the Sun will reveal Laurie's interchange this messenger Malachi for relish intense mes I want to do two things one I want a Malachi for he will turn a half of a turn to the fathers to he'll reveal the mystery of the seven thunders in reversion 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals it will be DS divinely revealed mystery truths that will literally turn the hearts of the churun back to the Pentecostal father's so in other words he ready come the river thunders and a tunnel to go till he has back to the faith and fathers isn't that right do you believe that hallelujah so then we go back to paradox I only know about Danny Henry I'm barb and spoke some things and it came across in French I was interpreted and this was spoke to the Prophet because thou hast chosen the hard way the narrow path the hard way that was walked in your own chosen in other words I didn't have to do it I could side and go with them if I want to but I stayed but what would the wood that was picked the correct precise decision it is my way watch the Hardaway God said he's choosing he choose the right thing Oh hallelujah that means he wasn't using with his eyes or his emotions or his feelings he choose the way of God oh that's why you have to overcome the lust of the eyes what didn't happen a lot when God told Abraham all this is yours he tell not to choose after before go tell Abram that he tell not to choose and the Bible said go and look to what suddam his eyes saw his eyes saw the nice water please the werster diamond and up in Sodom Abraham had the wilderness and whatnot but God said look to the east west port and so all is yours he uses eyes what are you using this morning what do you see in this morning Oh hallelujah as much as church foolishness to just flesh and blood not even seeing God he do she do PC EMC and what I said on nonsense have nothing to do with the program of God to see what courts program is look at look at Jacob when they get back home he's studying his brother I wanna kill him and God and Jacob doing this he said money what was about I'm richer than me he sent his wife this way on what let he spit them all up until what caught him a loon I went got caught Jacob alone then the injured could talk to him minister to him and he could wrestle with the angel and he knew what he wanted because he knew he can face his brother his money can help him his popularity again his word can help him nothing could help him unique what could help him and he massively angel all night long you know what he did he overcome [Applause] he overcame [Applause] angels coming morning I gotta go he's I will not let you go until you bless me where you're going the car go anywhere I don't do this for it I can't leave it a sinner I came I've got to get a breakthrough I'm not gonna let you go [Music] [Applause] and then he was touched he was touch that one saying you've got taken experience Jordan is an experienced or I'm gonna say that again Jordan kids and experienced Jordan and no footage I'm not sitting flipping about Jordan and exhaustion about Jordan no Jordan is and Jordan no no no no Jordan experienced Jacob was touched it make him walk different started walk with a limp no that's embarrassing that you're walking with a limp walking like an old man but he was changed God's ain't no longer Jacob change the name and oil walk with a new name Israel is your name Oh glory to God how could he become Israel will overcome in how can he might walk in normal normal I am Israel I am Israel how because you say so because your mouth says oh you fix this ever by the new name anybody could do that you could go and get papers change but yet overcome nothing your writers on a piece of paper get it approved by the government but that is not what Jacob get is he overcome us all all night long Gaza for this overcoming I can leave you there every overcome I must have something the confirm is overcoming you overcome the lust of the eyes you overcome the lust of the flesh you overcome the pride of life something has to happen to you you have to come back in power your past giggle you pass Bethel you pass Jericho you come to Jordan you come back empty with the same room you have to come back where is the Lord God of Elijah you have to come back and get a testimony the spirit Elijah but rest upon Eli shot Oh glory hallelujah okay Clements just see if I could just finish this off here because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven awaits thee and I think and I wondered when I die would it be then it happened to take every that portion different portion up there have missed the king of heaven that's within us that wants what wait for what a glorious hidden thou has made this in itself is that which will give and may come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine and we see a tremendous friction love divine here we go you see what comment on to the Jordan meant we are done here now let's cross over now let's quit playing let's cross to the other side now because it all belongs to us it's all ours them visions never failed they can't feel because they come from God I believe with all as it with within me we are not the Harlan that will run back to the wilderness we will cross Jordan prophecy the separation then he says God bread to us the seals that's on the back of the book let us enter into this great place now for Joshua divided to the people the inheritance that God has left for them so he put the tunnels that's the best of the book writer Jordan Oh hallelujah praise God isn't that right do you believe that so there is where the tumblers is at the seven thunders is that Ephesians when you cross over you have to cross over into the tunnels and the thunders will produce another Ephesians the ton that's my revelation suppose that leaves the Calvary supposed to leave us that depth herself we have to have power over self before we are power over others Oh blessed be the name of the Lord who shall come up please God requires a Jordan in every life this unquote Coleman God requires a Jordan in every life listen son and daughter listen mother father husband wife you cannot continue living for you and call that Jordan whatever you want whatever you feel whatever is your desire you get it and if you don't get it you misbehave or you carry on because you kind of get your own way God requires a Jordan every life so you like to come around and said the Elijah woman your young man the old prophet was trying to try them out your young man you haven't had much schooling it's really you haven't had a grammar school education all you know is how to plumb you better stay here and get a bachelor degree not Elijah not that man who wants touch God and felt the power of the anointing upon him he said as the Lord lives on your soul never dies I'll never leave you he had a purpose he saw the vision he know what was gonna take place and they both went down to Jordan Jordan means dead they stand there the old man and the young man it really represent Christ and His Church and dare they stood by the Jordan Jesse is coming out of the Judean Hills the great rivers roaring Elijah with his gray hair hanging on his back his dim all eyes looked across Jordan and the young man watching every movie made one day young man here we go are you ready was written for a vision to carry out the will of God the other one was going home I love this Frieza they will put a Jordan I just love those words there they were both a Jordan I just love that statement one is going one looking for vision to do the will of God and the Pope that Jordan Oh hallelujah that is what Elijah told Elijah the Lord had called me across Jordan and went on or give the Lord some praises people oh my I want to close but I want to just kind of wrap up here listen just suffer some say from other was it Moses listen to brother Brown I think a minister today that's call of God to step into the tracks where Jesus should what a commission but each that's call of God is Commission to stand in the same place I'll be with you even in you today another way each Minister called this town where he would the works that I do shall you also each minister ordained of God is command to stand in the tracks of Jesus Christ and perform the duties that Jesus performed that's quite a command not just talk but perform the duties Oh hallelujah watch how it must have felt when Judge must and in the morning when God said I would not feel you know leave thee therefore I will destroy and divide and make a week therefore you know there is a great lot of types to go into that Moses was not permitted to take the chair and over because he had field and the church organizations denomination has field and that's why quarrel raised up a Joshua generation because all what Moses did it came to a dead end and it couldn't cross so God had to take off Moses of the scene here this part God does equalizer will raise up a new system an interdenominational system by the power of God by the power of God that will take the church into the Promised Land Organization denomination has messed it up each one after the own theology each one after the one way of thinking but God will take his Holy Spirit and will raise his Joshua that will take the church to the promise with no dimensional string string tied it at all God called ministers author not to be stuffed up a theology but has visited the land to where they're gonna bring back evidence of divine love and power of the Lord Jesus to make known to the communication that is a land beyond the river and this is something but a prince had preached he said when we get to the river it divides and separate us once on the other side here we go something happens to you know Joshua in all this knowing that the command was great but having the assurance he could be fearless he could be we call it reckless as long as he was pointed the right way so can the Church of the Living God be reckless and fearless if the feet is pointed in the right way Oh glory to God amen isn't that right so the first stage is coming out of the land then the second see the Sun of occasion through the blood but the TEDx stage is when the cross Jordan into the promised land where the promised slave go and pass them he said no remember you have to pass by your brethren and they are near the border line if you pass by them do see nothing to them I have given Esau this mountain I have given more of this country I don't want you fussing with them pressure lighten just move - gently you know where you're going don't take up their habits notice not the teachings and of their habits which is their behavior I give Esau this mountain don't touch him I've got something for you Suva and I'm gonna close with this that's my desire brethren to see my church cross over into another land a desire to move over to the other side if there's something new here first call in there be something to respond to that call just settle down to ship reason enough for you going to some sort of business not enough for you just a joint Church but the name in a book is not enough for you but there's something calling you across the river a deep call in a deep Oh blessed be the name of the Lord blessed be

I had to ask but over the Deanna lasciviously what year was this again because he doesn't look one day older and this was four years ago so you're preaching a pastor this morning [Music] and the way he's preaching him like this could have been preached last month it's consistent so we certainly appreciate the Lord and we pray that God will continue to strengthen him as we get ready to leave this place how they lujah because it was after Elijah across Jordan and then Elijah left us and left us he was caught up in a chariot of fire and any lies I had to recognize it was not just just a mantle because he had the mantle but then he had to ask some more important question Elijah is gone but his God is still here so where is a Lord God of Elijah and then the school of the prophets who have been watching him all along had to take note when he struck that River again that the spirit of Elijah taught rest upon a light show and the devil will have to take note that the spirit that was upon that Elijah prophet taught rest upon this Elijah prime the same anointing the same spirit I was upon Jesus was they on the Alpha church and same spirit that is the holy spirit Jesus changed from to give you not part of himself but all of himself because all that was in court he ported the Christ and all that was in Christ he ported to this church can the church see man that's how you could do creature back then Elijah had two acts for a double portion but in our time he declared the double portion he said the same works I do shall you do also and even even asked me greater what shall you - because as my father sent me so send I you we are on a mission we are on a mission and Jordan is part of the process to finish the mission it's not about the mountain it's not about the sky it's not about the pain it's about the mission and our soldiers in the army of the Lord we have to cross our individual Jordan on our individual mission to get to our inheritance you have an inheritance I have an inheritance we have an inheritance and we're gonna believe in this place hallelujah I see it all the time I don't want to leave this place to get away from problems you know before we leave this

with brother pop well after the service and we want to have a January mind as well about the church MFE air / Christmas / anniversary celebration luncheon on December the 15th and we really would like the entire church to be part of this for adults it's 125 for children on the 10 at $70 and for under 5 years old it's no cost we will have the menu posted up as quickly as we can but we did read a menu but more than the food is really the spiritual fellowship and being able to spend time with a family of God because soon there'll be a time we will not be able to do this can the church say Amen but if I don't say that Brad will be a hunted with your group you know that's not to scare you that's just facts because you will be the ones with the light you'll be the ones with the love and in that season when the press comes watch it to the pool then watch a short quick message of power to shake the whole world so much power the world will cannot contain it and we leave this place to meet the law can the church say man what a day that will be when my Jesus I will see friends is not about church church is part of the process to where we need to go I'm interested in where we need to go
