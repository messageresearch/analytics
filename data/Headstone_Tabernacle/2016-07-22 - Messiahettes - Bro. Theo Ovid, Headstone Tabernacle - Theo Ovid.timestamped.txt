[51:22] Earth and Other Things fall man raised
[51:26] Reign Over man that's right that's right
[51:28] but man was supposed to be sons of
[51:32] God just like God yes sir Adam was to
[51:35] produce more Adams yes Sons just like
[51:39] him attribute Son of God Spirit as it
[51:42] was Sir and like brother ULU so
[51:44] tremendously brought out because Adam
[51:47] was placed in the garden as a man Adam
[51:49] wasn't placed as a babe he made man and
[51:53] put man in the Garden of Eden and that
[51:55] man fell God when he reboot he said I'm
[51:59] going to do it different now I'm going
[52:01] to bring in process amlu I'm going to
[52:04] bring in a birth a babe a growing a
[52:06] growth process because Adam didn't
[52:09] experience character
[52:13] development he was just a place son in

[1:07:20] disciples so Jesus Sol all that problem
[1:07:23] he sa me all life one I call all of
[1:07:25] you get over
[1:07:33] it so Philip didn't call Andrew and
[1:07:35] Andrew called this one and that one

[1:08:31] next
[1:08:33] bomb take the bom sitting down when it
[1:08:36] hit you you could stand up justify is as
[1:08:39] if you never did
[1:08:43] it you never sin you never fail you
[1:08:46] never
[1:08:48] fail there is nothing against
[1:08:52] you you by
[1:08:55] Joseph nothing against
[1:09:09] Joseph you may be
[1:09:11] seated you know what we doing there we
[1:09:13] giving your senses a run for the
[1:09:19] moneyall glory glory because you see
[1:09:21] your conscience heing there's nothing
[1:09:23] against you amen but your subconscious
[1:09:25] saying is that
[1:09:29] so so there's a big disagreement going
[1:09:32] on you want to receive it you want
[1:09:35] intellectually hearing it hear nothing
[1:09:37] he's forgiv me of
[1:09:41] what a feeling this and feeling that
[1:09:44] that's your feeling what God
[1:09:46] Said Jesus never said feel as th
[1:09:50] this Jesus always said believe as thou
[1:09:52] this it has nothing to do with you see
[1:09:55] you have to beat them senses you have to
[1:09:58] conquer them senses you have to let the
[1:10:00] senses know they're lying
[1:10:02] vanities I don't believe my
[1:10:04] senses you don't feel like praising God
[1:10:07] praise Him anyhow you don't feel like
[1:10:09] standing up stand up anyhow you don't
[1:10:13] feel like jumping just jump anyhow spin
[1:10:16] around do
[1:10:22] something
[1:10:33] you may be seated God is so unique so
[1:10:38] awesome so different from the humanistic
[1:10:41] realm that God bypassed all them phares
[1:10:44] and scribes who since they born they
[1:10:46] learning scriptures they could say of
[1:10:48] her
[1:10:49] heart and God take fishermen cper men
[1:10:53] who can write and read and say I will
[1:10:55] make you
[1:11:02] that from a humanistic standpoint it's
[1:11:04] easy to pick all them religious freaks
[1:11:07] because that is what they
[1:11:09] were all them religious Fanatics who in
[1:11:11] the Scrolls and the reading and the
[1:11:13] kissing the Bible and kissing the
[1:11:15] Scrolls and they rocking and they
[1:11:16] praying and whatnot when Messiah come
[1:11:18] they call him
[1:11:21] B and Jesus tell them plainly
[1:11:24] the Moses spoke about me what you
[1:11:27] looking for all these years you know
[1:11:28] what happened sit down a minute 400
[1:11:30] years there see no sign no wonders no
[1:11:32] Miracles 400 years just tradition and as
[1:11:34] the years go by getting
[1:11:36] worse beard get longer toy get higher
[1:11:39] the gongs get more classier and so on
[1:11:41] and all them is pots and pans and dress
[1:11:43] and wear and all the formality around
[1:11:45] the gospel so when John the Baptist come
[1:11:47] rugged as ever with camel skin no topy
[1:11:50] no long dead just just just rugged
[1:11:52] repent for the kingdom of God is at
[1:12:01] hand be
[1:12:03] seated people say but but he preaching
[1:12:06] like like like like what we just
[1:12:11] here but God tell John Make A Way
[1:12:14] mountains cut down crooked made straight
[1:12:17] how you making that you have to get
[1:12:18] tractor to do that get brushing Cutlass
[1:12:22] to make a way that big rug he said he
[1:12:24] ACC L to the root of the tree and tree
[1:12:27] that to Big through and chop it down
[1:12:30] what's he doing preparing our way who's
[1:12:34] coming
[1:12:38] Messiah and anytime Messiah coming God
[1:12:43] has to make a
[1:12:45] way oh give the Lord a you want Messiah
[1:12:48] coming to your life you've got to make a
[1:12:52] way
[1:12:57] John John knew the Messiah WR somewhere
[1:13:01] one day he was so convinced there's one
[1:13:03] standing among you I don't know who he
[1:13:05] is yet because God G him a sign the one
[1:13:07] upon whom you see the dove coming down
[1:13:09] and remaining you had to take all of
[1:13:12] that not Dove coming down Dove can come
[1:13:14] and land and then they see the wolf they
[1:13:15] just fly off so don't just want Landing
[1:13:18] Dove see the dove remaining say upon the
[1:13:21] one you see the dove land and remain
[1:13:22] that's the Messiah so he don't know who
[1:13:25] is who dumping everybody amen baptizing
[1:13:27] everybody all of a sudden he said Behold
[1:13:29] the Lamb of God I see Messi that's the
[1:13:32] messiah messiah is anointed word you got
[1:13:36] to see the Spirit
[1:13:38] come you hear what I'm saying you're
[1:13:40] going to read it Messiah is who anointed
[1:13:43] anointed word not the
[1:13:46] word
[1:13:47] anointed
[1:13:49] word hallelujah
[1:13:52] hallelujah still trying to get over that
[1:13:54] light hallah so watch self-will then God
[1:13:59] comes into the man into the heart which
[1:14:01] is the spirit then the spirit makes the
[1:14:02] soul and then he said now when a man is
[1:14:04] converted like that little white button
[1:14:06] starts in his heart when he's born again
[1:14:09] amen God's spirit dwells in him amen now
[1:14:12] listen to this beautiful part come
[1:14:14] on he can let that Spirit
[1:14:18] grow and take all the roots of
[1:14:21] bitterness and press God's way through
[1:14:25] him again amen he can become back in the
[1:14:29] same condition that he was when he was
[1:14:32] in the Garden of
[1:14:34] Eden Mark 11:23 amen what is he saying
[1:14:38] that white light come to you yes but
[1:14:41] then as you die out amen as you give up
[1:14:43] this Hallelujah it
[1:14:45] expands as you separate yourself from
[1:14:47] this it expands as you get rid of the
[1:14:49] bitterness it expands and afterward
[1:14:52] begin to oo through your body it taken
[1:14:55] over your memory your conscience your
[1:14:57] imagination Christ become present to you
[1:15:01] not as a service thing but as a life
[1:15:04] thing oh Hallelujah then you become
[1:15:08] ingrained in your subconscious the very
[1:15:10] word of God the life of God oh
[1:15:12] hallelujah praise the name of the Lord
[1:15:15] blessed be the name of the Lord listen
[1:15:18] to
[1:15:21] this enticing spirits put a
[1:15:24] br he say watch a few moments on the
[1:15:27] physical amen we have many times for
[1:15:29] years we call a li detector you could
[1:15:32] put it on your risk on your head and you
[1:15:35] can get in there and try your best to
[1:15:36] make a lie sound like the truth it will
[1:15:39] bres a negative every time because a
[1:15:42] human was not made to lie lying is a
[1:15:45] deceitful hard thing an evil thing I'd
[1:15:48] rather have a drunkard with me any day
[1:15:50] than a liar your body wasn't made to lie
[1:15:53] so no matter how sinful you are you're
[1:15:56] still a fallen Son of God the most
[1:16:00] sinful person in the city today God
[1:16:02] didn't intend you to be sinful he wanted
[1:16:05] you to be a son or daughter of his you
[1:16:08] are makeup your his own you are made in
[1:16:11] his own makeup but sin has caused you to
[1:16:13] do that and no matter how much you try
[1:16:15] to impersonate and try to make a lie
[1:16:18] seem right they got a scientific
[1:16:20] instrument that proves it's wrong true
[1:16:23] you can tell it with all the Innocence
[1:16:24] you want to but it will still register
[1:16:27] negative because there's a here we go
[1:16:29] there's a
[1:16:30] subconscious dong in the human being
[1:16:33] right and that subconscious knows what
[1:16:35] is the truth and no matter what you're
[1:16:38] saying out there that subconscious knows
[1:16:40] it's a lie and it will register on the
[1:16:44] subconscious so we're going a little
[1:16:46] deeper therefore if a man or woman now
[1:16:51] ever get their thoughts
[1:16:53] and their testimony and their lives so
[1:16:57] lined up with God until the channel of
[1:17:00] the Holy Spirit would be perfectly one
[1:17:04] with God what would take place if the
[1:17:07] man and woman would ever get lined up
[1:17:10] where from freedom from their hearts
[1:17:13] with Faith from their innermost oh he's
[1:17:15] going down deeper inside of there in
[1:17:17] other words he's trying to get you to
[1:17:19] line up your conscious and your
[1:17:21] subconscious to say the same
[1:17:24] not your conscious saying amen and your
[1:17:26] subconscious wondering should I say Amen
[1:17:27] is that really for me is that really so
[1:17:30] I'm back and whatnot but you see the
[1:17:32] word have to get that line up if you
[1:17:34] only get that line up your whole life
[1:17:36] transform and change because your
[1:17:38] subconscious is the real you this front
[1:17:41] part is just intellectual is the heart
[1:17:43] that's why the Bible say if you shall
[1:17:45] say to this mountain and don't doubt in
[1:17:48] your heart you can have what you what
[1:17:51] you say there we go many people come to
[1:17:54] the altar to be prayed for they have
[1:17:56] intellectual Faith they confess their
[1:17:58] sins and join a church by intellectual
[1:18:01] Faith they believe in their mind they
[1:18:04] believe because they heard it they
[1:18:06] believe because they know it's the best
[1:18:07] policy but that's not what God looks at
[1:18:12] amen oh he this mom he don't look at
[1:18:15] your intellectual Faith all right he
[1:18:18] looks at the heart so but I'm talking
[1:18:21] about people have all faith and they say
[1:18:22] they have faith but they call the prayer
[1:18:23] line and by time they come up the the
[1:18:25] black no Fai whatsoever so when they
[1:18:27] come up there there's no fate you got to
[1:18:28] tell them your name is so and so your
[1:18:30] house number is so and so and then the
[1:18:32] face that to raise yeah because they
[1:18:33] know he didn't he don't know that and
[1:18:35] then when the fith get excited and they
[1:18:36] get build up then they receive the
[1:18:38] healing and so there was an Indian woman
[1:18:40] come from the reservation and she came
[1:18:42] up with crutches and her faith was so
[1:18:44] anointed when she came to B brandham she
[1:18:46] hand him the crutches and walk off the
[1:18:47] platform he didn't have to pray for her
[1:18:50] because her faith was anointed
[1:18:53] for you to get that break your faith
[1:18:55] must be anointed and next woman take a
[1:18:57] pray CL she in a wheelchair she put the
[1:18:59] pray said th Spirit come out and

[1:26:12] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah when
[1:26:15] your confession says one thing yes and
[1:26:18] your life lives another there was
[1:26:20] something wrong somewhere that's because
[1:26:22] you got intellectual faith and not a
[1:26:23] Faith from your heart and that shows
[1:26:25] that outside here is a knowledge of God
[1:26:28] inside is a demon doubting I believe in
[1:26:30] Divine Healing but it's not for me you
[1:26:32] see it could be so but I don't believe
[1:26:34] it outside you say yes inside your
[1:26:36] conscious say
[1:26:38] no so you're agreeing with the preacher
[1:26:40] on the conscious level but at
[1:26:42] subconscious level you're not
[1:26:44] agreeing some people take what they want
[1:26:46] they feel the words like chewing
[1:26:48] gum instead of digesting it and making
[1:26:50] it bit in the belly they m
[1:26:54] and afterwards they take it on push it
[1:26:55] on his side they push it on the Belt
[1:26:57] they push it on his side they stick it
[1:26:58] on the table and whatnot take the word
[1:27:00] like chingum God say the word of Trum he
[1:27:02] said eat it it's sweet in the mouth but
[1:27:06] you have to digest it for it to be
[1:27:08] bitter in the belly some people like the
[1:27:10] sweet in the mouth they like bit in the
[1:27:12] belly so they spit it out afterwards but
[1:27:14] God want the word to sink down you have
[1:27:15] to get an experience with the
[1:27:19] word hallelujah can we go a little
[1:27:23] further if you notice the subconscious
[1:27:26] is where you live amen that's
[1:27:30] right that's where you live that's the
[1:27:33] reason people it's hard for them to have
[1:27:35] faith up here they say yes I got faith
[1:27:37] but down here it it's not for you if you
[1:27:40] can get God to say I am the Lord that
[1:27:42] healed thee this first conscious I am
[1:27:45] the Lord that healed the and the subc
[1:27:47] conscience said I'm the Lord that healed
[1:27:49] the you are going forward hallelujah
[1:27:51] amen amen but when God say I'm the Lord
[1:27:54] Heal thee and subconscious said I
[1:27:56] believe it's so but said are you quite
[1:27:58] sure then you're not going to anywhere
[1:28:01] you run around in circles you have got
[1:28:03] to get both working together and in
[1:28:06] harmony then you can move forward amen
[1:28:09] he said now watch and this is bringing
[1:28:11] back something here from the UN song I
[1:28:13] say a few days ago speaking on a light
[1:28:16] detector notice I want you to pay close
[1:28:18] attention put a light detector on you
[1:28:20] you try to impersonate the truth try to
[1:28:22] say that truth but down on the inside of
[1:28:24] you watch in the
[1:28:26] subconscious lays a place called the
[1:28:34] soul and this intellectual mind this big
[1:28:37] this is big this intellectual mind does
[1:28:42] not govern the vibration of that system
[1:28:45] all
[1:28:46] right that is why when they put in the
[1:28:48] machine and said did you do it and they
[1:28:50] B no I didn't know it the Moine doing so
[1:28:53] he did it he did it he did it he did it
[1:28:55] he did
[1:28:56] it because your mouth saying no you
[1:29:00] seeing it nice and everything else but
[1:29:02] your subconscious half beaten fast your
[1:29:04] pressure raising up because your
[1:29:05] subconscious
[1:29:09] stay so you not seeing the machine you
[1:29:11] only had the instrument and they asking
[1:29:13] different questions and see the machine
[1:29:14] doing so yes he did
[1:29:20] it the mind is only the
[1:29:25] director it will direct you but it is
[1:29:28] here this this's a big one it is
[1:29:30] incapable of bringing you to
[1:29:36] God oh I hope God gave me the grace to
[1:29:38] finish this today I'm not going to be
[1:29:40] long in subconscious we have a message
[1:29:43] but all this is part of what I was given
[1:29:45] to present to you this morning you see
[1:29:47] because a lot of people only hear me
[1:29:49] message intellectually when the real Go
[1:29:51] gospel begin to preach you will see the
[1:29:53] difference in this very same message
[1:29:56] remember the disciples when Jesus raised
[1:29:57] from the dead remember before Jesus died
[1:29:59] they was the Weeping depressed don't go
[1:30:02] don't go he said don't go the com will
[1:30:03] not come and when he died and he rose
[1:30:06] from the dead men depressed men D out
[1:30:08] and Jesus come among them they don't
[1:30:09] know his Jesus and he said why are you
[1:30:11] sad he said you don't know Jesus of
[1:30:13] nazare a man approve of God he dead and
[1:30:16] that was the third day and they all kind
[1:30:18] of thing and Jesus bust them he rebuked
[1:30:20] them he said but my God didn't the
[1:30:22] scripture say that didn't the scripture
[1:30:24] say that oh slow slow on fools and slow
[1:30:26] of heart to believe all what the
[1:30:28] scripture had said then when he raised
[1:30:30] among them he introduced them a new kind
[1:30:32] of Fate it's Resurrection fate it's an
[1:30:35] anointed Faith it's a faith to know he's
[1:30:37] not only dead but he is raised from the
[1:30:40] dead He's Alive they can say He Is Risen
[1:30:44] oh
[1:30:45] Hallelujah when he leing this time they
[1:30:48] were happy they W him byebye he was was
[1:30:52] taken up because they knew their promis
[1:30:55] is

[1:31:10] they know the anointing was coming they
[1:31:13] knew they were going to be
[1:31:20] Messiah
[1:31:22] because Jesus said behold I send the
[1:31:24] promise of my father upon you then he
[1:31:26] breathed upon them receive the Holy
[1:31:27] Ghost so there was no need to be
[1:31:29] depressed they were afraid but they was
[1:31:33] confident that God will to keep the
[1:31:35] promise that's why they went in the
[1:31:36] upper room that's why they lock all the
[1:31:38] doors they were afraid but they believe
[1:31:42] they were afraid of them outside but
[1:31:44] they were waiting for the lion of the
[1:31:46] tribe of Judah anointing yet they were
[1:31:48] waiting for the super
[1:31:50] anointing
[1:31:55] it's okay to be struggling it's okay to
[1:31:57] be afraid it's okay to be unsure
[1:32:00] sometimes but you are under a promise
[1:32:02] and that's the main thing man didn't
[1:32:05] give you that promise and man can hold
[1:32:07] it back from you that is your promise
[1:32:09] you are not a little child God want you
[1:32:12] to be a man and woman son and daughter
[1:32:15] not some man over you God had promised

[1:42:18] Christ why he was the very God they
[1:42:20] hated him they Deni him to be the
[1:42:23] Messiah they didn't want such a messiah
[1:42:25] as that I remember think pilot one of
[1:42:28] them I say are you the king of the
[1:42:31] Jews he say Jesus said you you say that
[1:42:35] of
[1:42:36] yourself or all others tell you
[1:42:42] that that that that your own Revelation
[1:42:45] or others tell you I'm the king of the
[1:42:46] Jews then Jesus buses in them he said my
[1:42:49] kingdom is not of this world
[1:42:54] and that is the problem people only know
[1:42:57] church but Jesus said Upon This Rock
[1:43:00] I'll build my church not this building
[1:43:02] here not this this is not the
[1:43:04] church this not what Jesus Built it's
[1:43:07] Revelation he's talking about and it's a
[1:43:10] kingdom he's talking about and in that
[1:43:13] Kingdom nobody can put you in Hallelujah
[1:43:16] and nobody can take you Hallelujah out
[1:43:21] then that make you a kingdom person and
[1:43:24] I'm declaring that you are Kingdom
[1:43:26] people I want you to leave your think
[1:43:29] indiff that you don't belong to this
[1:43:32] Earth You are citizen of
[1:43:39] above
[1:43:41] Hallelujah all right let's go
[1:43:43] further today the church has the same
[1:43:45] thing it denies the word they don't want
[1:43:47] it and the word is the Messiah you
[1:43:50] believe that
[1:43:51] the congregation says amen well the
[1:43:53] reflection of the word is what a
[1:43:55] reflection of the Messiah which is the
[1:43:58] Holy Ghost Among Us he is reflecting
[1:44:00] himself this is Brother brandham five
[1:44:03] defin definite identification of the
[1:44:05] true church as I travel around the
[1:44:09] world Amen I find every nation has his
[1:44:12] own spirit all nations are controlled by
[1:44:15] the devil all governments ruled by the
[1:44:18] devil Bible said so they fight the War
[1:44:21] till Jesus comes now Jesus know okay
[1:44:24] when you go to Germany you find a German
[1:44:25] Spirit you go to England English Spirit
[1:44:28] go to Sweden Swedish Spirit you come to
[1:44:30] America you find the American Spirit now
[1:44:33] we never compel men or woman to dress or
[1:44:37] not to drink or not to swear we just
[1:44:38] preach the gospel lay down the pattern
[1:44:40] of the Bible and many men that come to
[1:44:42] the Pentecostal faith and Holiness Faith
[1:44:44] come in and profess to be when they're
[1:44:46] not in their heart many woman does the
[1:44:48] same thing we don't tell them they have
[1:44:50] to do do it we just give them the
[1:44:51] pattern tell them what the Bible says
[1:44:54] and then they are born of a Heavenly
[1:44:56] Spirit here we go here we go then their
[1:44:59] spirit is no more Americanized it's no
[1:45:01] more germanized it is Heavenly
[1:45:05] lized for the kingdom of
[1:45:11] God I was in India when I see the Holy
[1:45:13] Ghost fell upon an El in your lady and I
[1:45:15] saw a spin around and say wo is one Holy
[1:45:17] Ghost it have one effect it fall here it
[1:45:21] fall in Africa it fall in America it's
[1:45:23] one Holy Ghost it's one Lord is one
[1:45:26] Spirit calling people from everywhere oh
[1:45:29] do you believe that now watch here we
[1:45:31] say now because we are in another
[1:45:34] kingdom a kingdom of God with decency
[1:45:38] Holiness and power exist we have access
[1:45:41] to our King do you believe that we have
[1:45:45] an interview with him whenever we want
[1:45:46] to call upon him we have no other
[1:45:49] intercessor says no other mediator
[1:45:52] between the king and us but the one man
[1:45:54] Christ Jesus so we are living in a
[1:45:57] kingdom and it is called in the
[1:45:59] chronology of the Bible the Messiah
[1:46:01] Kingdom in other words here we go the
[1:46:04] Messiah rules in every life in his
[1:46:07] Dominion amen ruling the lives of his
[1:46:10] people are called out people from every
[1:46:13] Walk of Life Gathering them together in
[1:46:15] a group and then call it his church his
[1:46:17] call out one isn't that a beautiful
[1:46:19] thing so this Messiah Empire or Messiah
[1:46:23] kingdom is where Christ Reigns in the
[1:46:26] people's
[1:46:28] lives not the minister Conquering the
[1:46:31] people beating the people pushing the
[1:46:34] people but the Messiah infecting and
[1:46:37] invading your own
[1:46:40] life then you understand what it is to
[1:46:42] be a
[1:46:43] Christian as opposed to be a church
[1:46:45] member then you really want to be a
[1:46:47] Christian because Christian be a
[1:46:49] Christian anywhere
[1:46:50] take you and drop you in Iceland in New
[1:46:53] Zealand Australia anywhere you would
[1:46:55] still be a
[1:46:56] Christian Hallelujah even if you don't
[1:46:59] have a church you will still be a
[1:47:01] Christian oh give the Lord a shout and
[1:47:06] the Israel was the people of God until
[1:47:09] they were called out from other churches
[1:47:11] other religion to walk with God alone
[1:47:13] and the Church of got today is the same
[1:47:15] thing called out to walk not being
[1:47:18] governed by a bishop or being govern by
[1:47:21] but being governed by Christ in this
[1:47:23] Messiah Kingdom we live in Christ is
[1:47:25] King Christ is the one now Christ is the
[1:47:28] head of this Messiah kingdom here we go
[1:47:31] are you ready you cannot organize a
[1:47:35] kingdom of which Christ is the head
[1:47:39] am
[1:47:40] amen you cannot denominate a kingdom
[1:47:43] which Christ is the head Hallelujah
[1:47:45] because Christ is King and you cannot
[1:47:48] take the intellectuals of man and make
[1:47:50] an organization to which Christ will
[1:47:52] govern therefore any companies any
[1:47:55] peoples any groups of men that tries to
[1:47:58] organize the kingdom of God is going
[1:48:00] contrary to the king and if they're
[1:48:02] going to contrary to the king it will be
[1:48:03] against the king and if it's against the
[1:48:05] king it will be Antichrist amen yes sir
[1:48:09] amen amen amen amen so an antichrist
[1:48:12] Spirit tries to take a people and call
[1:48:14] them from organization to organization
[1:48:17] organize them together which was never
[1:48:19] the will of God people has always fussed
[1:48:22] at me because I struck so hard at
[1:48:23] organization it isn't the people in
[1:48:25] there I'm striking at it's that
[1:48:27] dominating Spirit here we go that make
[1:48:30] the people think we are the
[1:48:34] people see that is what the organization
[1:48:36] Spirit does we are it we are it and the
[1:48:38] others not it we are on the others are
[1:48:42] off the angel in the church and the
[1:48:45] angel here like if the angel have a have
[1:48:47] a bed and a room here my God that
[1:48:51] doesn't exist you cannot pin God to a
[1:48:54] group to a church to to you know go God
[1:48:57] doesn't live in that in that way isn't
[1:48:59] that right let's continue now you the

[2:27:04] Testament was anointed by the Holy Ghost
[2:27:07] they were
[2:27:07] Lites he was the fullness of God being
[2:27:10] the Messiah then was Messiah smaller
[2:27:14] Messiah for they were Anointed with the
[2:27:16] same spirit he was anointed with almost
[2:27:18] done amen oh my now we say man he got a
[2:27:23] hand like God eyes like God is like God
[2:27:25] he was fashioned after God he was given
[2:27:27] on Earth and a Dominion he was made a
[2:27:30] God over the Earth to rule the Earth a
[2:27:31] Lesser God God rules the universe but
[2:27:34] man was given the Earth to rule the
[2:27:36] Earth he was a messiah yet and that is
[2:27:39] what it is tonight if he gets back to
[2:27:41] God he is a messiah at a little Messiah
[2:27:43] do you see what God want you to be yes
[2:27:45] sir a little anointed one when you go on
[2:27:48] the job you're anointed demons on your
[2:27:50] coworkers have to back up in the spirit
[2:27:53] realm you not seeing it but when you get
[2:27:55] the Holy Ghost and Holy Ghost upon you
[2:27:57] demons upon them is war going
[2:28:02] on but you have an atmosphere around
[2:28:10] you if if you're not anointed they could
[2:28:13] anoint you you know because I'm in
[2:28:15] spirit but ra driving a man and in a car
[2:28:17] one time and he said the man spoke a
[2:28:19] Blue Streak and break the anointing off
[2:28:21] of
[2:28:25] him think about it he's the prophet and
[2:28:28] he had the anointing and a man spoke
[2:28:29] afterward you be very careful who he
[2:28:31] carry in the car words are power words
[2:28:34] are
[2:28:38] Spirit wrong words wrong Spirit wrong
[2:28:41] Doctrine release wrong spirit and people
[2:28:43] don't know what Spirit upon them but
[2:28:44] they hearing wrong teachings wrong
[2:28:46] Doctrine afterward they don't even know
[2:28:48] what they believe they messed up tied up
[2:28:51] tangled up but the but but BR says the
[2:28:54] prophet and the bride and the spirit
[2:28:56] will say the same
[2:28:58] thing not no cucko thing it will say the
[2:29:01] same thing no Revelation the word is
[2:29:07] God all
[2:29:09] right my Lord my
[2:29:12] Lord
[2:29:15] hallelujah says the word is the conduct
[2:29:17] of the spirit watch and watch the first
[2:29:20] thing you know and make a blowing song
[2:29:22] across the building goes the Holy Ghost
[2:29:23] see it's the conductor of the word or
[2:29:25] the word is the conductor of the spirit
[2:29:26] because when the word is preached the
[2:29:28] spirit follows it wherever it goes so
[2:29:30] then once the word is being preached you
[2:29:31] can feel the spirit going through the
[2:29:33] word so when the word hit you the word
[2:29:35] come to the Holy Ghost come to anoint
[2:29:37] you oh my my my so the kingdom of God is
[2:29:40] the Holy Spirit you belong to that
[2:29:44] Kingdom am amen oh my they get it
[2:29:47] thought they are born from above they
[2:29:48] are different they are citizens from
[2:29:50] above then you become a kingdom person
[2:29:53] then you say you are Church boy no I'm a
[2:29:55] kingdom person I belong to a kingdom
[2:29:58] where you belong to I belong to a
[2:29:59] kingdom and and Jesus is king and the
[2:30:02] King sent a message to a prophet his
[2:30:04] name is William Marian Branham Mighty
[2:30:07] Angel brought B the king's message and
[2:30:09] God said I'm going to Reign on the earth
[2:30:11] God said I'm a king and a priest God
[2:30:13] said I'm an overcomer God said I'm more
[2:30:15] than a conqueror God said I'm I'm a seed
[2:30:18] in the last days God said I'm one of
[2:30:19] them children whose Hearts will return
[2:30:21] back to the face of the father what does
[2:30:23] that have to do with
[2:30:30] church say no man had no Li on this
[2:30:32] message no matter Li I can't say this I
[2:30:35] can't say that they will keep me out
[2:30:38] they do have Heaven hell and they can't
[2:30:40] go to the name of the
[2:30:41] books how you open the book to take my
[2:30:44] name off that's like God relasing power
[2:30:46] because people don't like it they will
[2:30:47] they will speak you out of
[2:30:49] existence they would knock you out the
[2:30:51] kingdom we we don't know you see and
[2:30:54] that's why you see the conditions are
[2:30:56] difficult we live in a real rough AG
[2:30:58] what kind of broken homes broken
[2:30:59] relationship broken marriages and all
[2:31:01] lot of things broken up and God expect
[2:31:04] us to believe him am miss all of
[2:31:10] that if we look at the condition we will
[2:31:12] scream hallah if we look at the
[2:31:15] condition we will run
[2:31:20] is that I'm righteous and you are not
[2:31:22] you are righteous and this one not it's
[2:31:24] not that all have sinned not some all
[2:31:29] but God sent a word to bring us to one
[2:31:31] Lord One Faith one
[2:31:35] baptism one
[2:31:40] Kingdom I'm almost done there about two
[2:31:43] more quotes and we done this was
[2:31:45] good
[2:31:48] woo
[2:31:50] Wonder from Oneness the Bible say in the
[2:31:52] last days there'll be churches another
[2:31:55] Tower of Babel and you know the thing
[2:31:57] about it the mistaken church for God yes
[2:32:00] that's the S thing in this message
[2:32:03] people mistaken group for security as
[2:32:06] long as they belong to a church or group
[2:32:07] or Fellowship you're on your way to the
[2:32:09] Rapture that's not
[2:32:12] true the Raptor have to be within
[2:32:14] you amen
[2:32:17] amen
[2:32:19] hallu Enoch walk with God hallu and was
[2:32:23] not for God took him but before God took
[2:32:26] him he had a testimony that he pleased
[2:32:29] God you can't please God without faith
[2:32:32] but a little deeper his mechanics turned
[2:32:34] to Dynamics where was his mechanics in
[2:32:40] him he never the machine you know and he
[2:32:43] crank up crank he jump in it and go you
[2:32:45] know
[2:32:47] en know didn't have WRA the machine the
[2:32:49] kingdom was in him he took a stroll and
[2:32:52] tell his wife goodbye we are taking a
[2:32:54] walk he didn't walk and he walked with
[2:32:55] God and walked not bam went on to depths
[2:32:57] of it and said his mechanic
[2:33:00] turned to Dynamic and he was translated
[2:33:05] amen he had power on the inside and
[2:33:07] power come on the outside and his body
[2:33:10] was in
[2:33:14] between do you see what I'm saying so
[2:33:16] the Raptor ain't coming in that sense
[2:33:18] the Raptor going to be in
[2:33:21] you because the kingdom going to be in
[2:33:23] you so you are walking with that Kingdom
[2:33:27] that's why Jesus is tell him my hour is
[2:33:28] not yet come you can't touch me don't
[2:33:30] try to touch me my hour is not yet come
[2:33:33] when his hour come he my always come oh
[2:33:36] hallelujah praise the name of the
[2:33:38] Lord how do you get the okay watch the
[2:33:42] Bible said in the last days there be
[2:33:43] churches not to of Babel they'll form uh
[2:33:46] uh they have a form of godliness deny
[2:33:48] the power on the word the power of His
[2:33:49] word what is his word the kingdom of God
[2:33:52] we've got to belong to the kingdom
[2:33:53] before we can ever be subjects to the
[2:33:55] king I like that we've got to belong to
[2:33:58] the kingdom before we can be subjects of
[2:34:01] the king well how do we get in the
[2:34:03] Kingdom the kingdom of God are you
[2:34:07] ready is the word of God made back in
[2:34:13] power that's why Jesus could say the
[2:34:16] kingdom is within you but the word comes
[2:34:18] into you as a seed and whenever God turn
[2:34:21] the word into Power that's the kingdom
[2:34:23] inside of you that's the Holy Ghost
[2:34:26] inside of you that's Dynamics inside of
[2:34:28] you so he has to get the word in first
[2:34:30] because the Pentecostal got Spirit on
[2:34:32] them but they couldn't make it through
[2:34:34] because they didn't have the word so
[2:34:36] they fail with spirit so God s a prophet
[2:34:39] to bring back the word that God could
[2:34:41] use his word as a conductor of the
[2:34:44] spirit there is my spirit flowing freely
[2:34:48] I'm not using men just men but I'm using
[2:34:50] my word in men come on now come on now
[2:34:53] do you see it do you see it because
[2:34:56] power have to connect with character
[2:34:59] without character is satanic and that's
[2:35:01] what you see with the Pentecostal there
[2:35:02] was no life there there was no word
[2:35:05] there there was no conductor there but
[2:35:07] once God get back the conductor the
[2:35:09] spirit can
[2:35:13] flow so here we go
[2:35:16] now there's only one thing you can put
[2:35:18] confidence in is the word that's right
[2:35:20] and the word is God and the word
[2:35:23] anointed makes the
[2:35:25] Messiah the anointed word of the hour
[2:35:27] hallelujah what is the last quote mus
[2:35:29] come up please hallelujah oh I'm
[2:35:34] done I wonder if this great T is ecomic
[2:35:37] Council that we got in the world today
[2:35:39] and the workong the church is forming
[2:35:41] together to make us all one I wonder if
[2:35:42] they realize that is exactly what the
[2:35:45] scripture said they will do do and they
[2:35:47] think it's a wonderful thing that they
[2:35:49] can all join hands and be one J pray
[2:35:51] that be one but that's true but that's
[2:35:53] not that kind of one he said be one as I
[2:35:57] and my father Hallelujah are one that
[2:36:01] kind of one then how will that be
[2:36:04] question and this I'm closing quote the
[2:36:06] word in
[2:36:08] us would be the anointed word amen that
[2:36:13] is the Oneness of God the Oneness of God
[2:36:18] is the word anointed in
[2:36:21] you and then you become a son a messiah
[2:36:26] of the age hallelujah hallelujah that
[2:36:29] has nothing to do with church membership
[2:36:31] that has to do with the word that the
[2:36:33] prophet brought Seated on into side of
[2:36:35] you being
[2:36:37] anointed may God anoint that word in you
[2:36:39] today amen and make you a
[2:36:42] messiah an anointed one of God may the
