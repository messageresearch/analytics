[50:01] morning wonderful before you take your
[50:04] seats this morning can we turn to two
[50:06] portions of scripture reading from The
[50:08] Book of Romans 8 and St John
[50:12] 142 familiar scriptures this
[50:15] morning as we Endeavor to encourage the
[50:19] Believers in such a time as
[50:21] this amen
[50:33] reading Romans 8 and verse
[50:36] 11 but if the spirit of him that raised
[50:39] up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he
[50:42] that raised up Christ from the
[50:44] dead shall also Quicken your mortal

[51:05] these shall you do because I go unto my
[51:08] father may the Lord add a blessing to
[51:10] the reading of his word you may be
[51:15] seated Al I de gree to church in the
[51:17] precious name of Jesus Christ it's
[51:19] certainly a great privilege to be in the
[51:21] land of the living and to be able to
[51:22] come to the house of the Lord to give
[51:25] God his due he is worthy he is deserving
[51:28] of our worship and our praise he is God
[51:32] by the fact that he is worthy of worship
[51:35] and he is God all by himself his worship
[51:37] is not dependent on how we feel his
[51:39] worship is not dependent on what we have
[51:42] or don't have he deserves the worship
[51:44] because he is God and if he is your God
[51:47] then you will serve him if he is your
[51:49] god you will praise him if he is your
[51:50] god you will worship Him can the church
[51:53] say amen amen there's something powerful
[51:55] just about worship even with a lack of
[51:58] understanding you could still worship
[52:00] even when you have problems you could
[52:01] still worship can the church say Amen so
[52:04] I have a title this morning breaking
[52:06] past your
[52:09] barriers breaking past your
[52:12] barriers we all have barriers that we
[52:16] need to overcome in fact the world
[52:18] itself would have had different types of
[52:20] barriers to break through there was a
[52:22] time when only the horse was the means
[52:25] of transport after man figured out that
[52:28] you know walking was just too exhausting
[52:30] and then somebody I don't know who was
[52:32] the first person who decided why don't I
[52:34] jump on this thing that's walking around
[52:36] here and maybe he could carry me further
[52:38] than my legs could carry me and you know
[52:40] whoever was the first one somebody else
[52:41] saw it and before you know it people
[52:43] were on horse back but that only lasted
[52:46] so long and then horse became the horse
[52:48] and buggy so this one horse could have
[52:50] pulled more than one person because
[52:51] somebody got wheels and and as man
[52:53] progressed barriers were being broken
[52:56] and and the horse and the horse and
[52:58] buggy became the car and for some reason
[53:01] the Benchmark against which the car was
[53:04] measured was horsepower because the
[53:06] horse was the frame of reference or the
[53:08] example that had guided things for so
[53:10] long so then you measure car by how much
[53:12] horsepower the car has so the car has
[53:15] two horsepower three horsepower until
[53:17] you have 300 horsepower so you in a car
[53:20] that is worth 300 horses does that make
[53:23] sense so so in so doing man begin to
[53:25] break from one barrier to another
[53:27] barrier and brother Brandon preaching
[53:28] this from the horse and buggy to the car
[53:30] and then from the car to the Aeroplane
[53:32] so no longer you are you are trying to
[53:34] cover the ground physically anymore but
[53:36] now you are you are moving above the
[53:38] ground and and then man reached the
[53:40] astronaut age breaking another barrier
[53:42] to move from horse to car to plane to
[53:45] the to the astronaut or the the rocket
[53:47] shape age or whatever you want to call
[53:49] it until you break out of this this this
[53:51] this system that we in this environment
[53:53] this this realm that we are in everybody
[53:56] with me this this morning over the last
[53:58] few days I don't know how many of you
[53:59] saw the news but Tesla who has been a
[54:02] groundbreaking company and and Elon Musk
[54:05] and bovid has had different sessions on
[54:08] AI and technology and where it's going
[54:10] but this week he launched or released or
[54:13] announced three Technologies one of
[54:16] which we sort of expected which was now
[54:18] the car was launched without the the
[54:20] steering wheel and you could summon the
[54:21] car and all of the economic privileges
[54:24] and benefits of it and an analyst said
[54:26] that when you look at this barrier that
[54:28] is being broken very soon they're going
[54:30] to say it is not worth for man to drive
[54:32] any vehicle because man will be a danger
[54:34] to himself and all these you know
[54:36] computerized cars will talk to one
[54:38] another so an accident becomes
[54:40] impossible because you can't talk to the
[54:42] driver two cars ahead or five cars ahead
[54:44] or 10 cars ahead of you but these
[54:46] computerized AI driven powered cars will
[54:48] be able to talk to a car 100 cars away
[54:51] 200 Cars away and nowhere to take you to
[54:52] avoid traffic and all of these things he
[54:55] also launched a a a robo van and then he
[54:57] he launched a robot that could walk and
[54:59] it could clean and it could serve food
[55:01] and it could mix things and it could
[55:02] clean the house and and it could see
[55:04] people who say well finally I don't have
[55:05] to clean the house anymore because now
[55:07] there's a there's a robot that could do
[55:09] that but what it does show is that man
[55:11] will not stop at trying to break past
[55:14] some kind of barrier and this is not a
[55:16] new thing because when you go back to
[55:17] Genesis man also worked on breaking a
[55:20] barrier on Nimrod and they built a tower
[55:23] that was was was effectively so well
[55:25] constructed that God himself had to
[55:27] interrupt the program and God said if I
[55:30] don't go down and deal with this
[55:31] progress this barrier has been broken
[55:33] they will reach into
[55:35] heaven so it took a Divine Interruption
[55:38] into nimr's laboratory to stop the
[55:41] progress that nimron was making I want
[55:42] you to appreciate that God looked at the
[55:45] UN Unity of the people the the the the
[55:47] everyone was in one mind and they were
[55:49] in one Accord and they had one purpose
[55:51] to be able to connect Heaven to Earth
[55:54] and God said if I don't interrupt man is
[55:57] so powerful that he could achieve it on
[55:59] his own you heard what I said and God
[56:02] had to come now to confound his language
[56:05] and now we are reaching full circle back
[56:07] to when you look at the day of Pentecost
[56:09] and Peter was able to speak we know it's
[56:11] in scripture and every man heard in his
[56:12] own language so we saw the Holy Spirit
[56:15] as the mechanism to almost reverse or or
[56:19] or deal with what God did there by the
[56:21] Tower of Babel right so the Holy Ghost
[56:23] was able to when Peter preached there
[56:24] was no translator on the pulpit
[56:26] because the Holy Ghost was able to speak
[56:28] to each
[56:29] person but now man is saying that with
[56:32] AI and AI glasses and these things you
[56:34] could go to a foreign country and the
[56:36] glasses will speak to your ear and
[56:38] translate what a person saying even if
[56:39] you don't know what they're saying man
[56:41] is once again trying to reach back where
[56:43] they were that God dealt with years ago
[56:46] so I have a question for you this
[56:48] morning because my Bible tells me I am
[56:50] the Lord and I change not but the
[56:52] brandom said if God don't deal with
[56:55] Sodom Andor Mor now and deal with Los
[56:58] Angeles now and deal with the work now
[57:00] he would have to go back and repent for
[57:01] what he did to sangor years ago but
[57:04] because he's the same God he has to take
[57:07] the same action now that he did back
[57:09] then because he would not be God so if
[57:11] God had to come down back then to
[57:13] interrupt the progress of Man based on
[57:15] what man's achievement was then you want
[57:18] to tell me God will not do the same
[57:19] thing now to break up all of the
[57:22] advancement if it puts us into a
[57:24] position where but the brandom said man
[57:26] break into God's laboratory can the
[57:28] church say
[57:29] amen and the Bron made a statement years
[57:32] ago he said the world is making
[57:34] progress he said the world went from
[57:36] Cars to to from horse and buggy to cars
[57:39] and from Cars to planes and from Planes
[57:41] to Rockies and he said the church is
[57:42] moving too slow because man is making
[57:45] progress he said what man is doing
[57:47] should be a parallel or a side show to
[57:50] what is happening in a spiritual realm
[57:51] in other words if you are in a spiritual
[57:53] horse and buggy this morning you need to
[57:55] move very quickly from that spiritual
[57:57] horse and buggy into a spiritual car to
[58:00] a spiritual plane and then when the
[58:01] Brandon preacher about being a spiritual
[58:03] astronaut because we are not supposed to
[58:05] be living here on this Earth we are
[58:06] supposed to be getting out of here and
[58:08] you can't leave here on a horse and
[58:09] buggy you can't leave here in a car you
[58:11] can't leave you in a plane you have to
[58:13] be in a rocket a Rapture Express rocket
[58:17] that's going to take you from this realm
[58:18] to another place that's going to take
[58:20] you from mortality to immortality that
[58:22] will take you from sickness to Good
[58:24] Health that will take you from going
[58:25] older to take you to getting younger man
[58:27] will never perfect that technology man
[58:29] will never build that technology can the
[58:31] church say Amen that spiritual
[58:33] technology oh you don't hear me this
[58:36] morning Hall I'm just talking to you
[58:39] this morning so there's technology that
[58:41] God has perfected a long time ago when
[58:43] Philip needed to get to a Revival he
[58:45] just had to be translated from where he
[58:47] was to another place man I figure that
[58:49] one out yet oh you don't hear me this
[58:51] morning Peter and they were in a prison
[58:53] and they were praying there and when
[58:54] they were praying the chains were being
[58:56] broken where they were at man hasn't
[58:58] figured out that technology yet and they
[58:59] could never figure out that technology
[59:01] because that's God Divine intelligence
[59:03] come on now oh
[59:06] hallelujah hallelujah when brother brand

[59:15] to move and the doctor have to wonder
[59:17] what just
[59:18] happened Hallelujah nobody could build
[59:21] that technology that's God's technology
[59:24] that's spiritual techn techology can the
[59:27] church say Amen when Elijah was caught
[59:29] up in a chariot of fire that was in an
[59:31] El that was Tesla car make that oh come
[59:33] on now somebody help me this morning
[59:36] Tesla cannot make that Hallelujah you
[59:39] don't hear me this morning when that
[59:41] widow woman was about to cook her last
[59:43] meal and she said this is my last meal
[59:44] and my last oil and Elijah said bake me
[59:47] a cake
[59:48] first and when she did that every day
[59:50] she went to the same flow to the same
[59:53] oil and for three and a half years
[59:55] without having to go to massive stores
[59:57] or go to or you don't hear me this
[59:59] morning without having to go to the
[1:00:00] grocery the flower never went
[1:00:03] down Tesla cannot make that you don't
[1:00:05] hear me this
[1:00:08] morning Hallelujah brother Bram T he say
[1:00:11] right now you lay hands on the sick but
[1:00:13] when that time comes you will command
[1:00:15] the Devils to leave no man-made
[1:00:17] technology could do that but there's a
[1:00:19] barrier we have to break Hallelujah to
[1:00:22] enter into that realm there's a barrier
[1:00:24] you have to break to go to your next
[1:00:27] level you have to do something more than
[1:00:28] you did before you have to have more
[1:00:30] tolerance you have to have more strength
[1:00:32] oh can the church say
[1:00:36] amen hallelujah more power brother
[1:00:38] Terence that's right Hallelujah takes
[1:00:41] more power no horse and buggy could take
[1:00:43] off off the ground you need more than
[1:00:45] one horse to get fast enough to break
[1:00:48] off a Runway you could put 15 horses and
[1:00:50] string them together they will never
[1:00:52] take off but when you get a plane engine
[1:00:55] and you see that plane engine begin to M
[1:00:58] and they begin to run down the runway
[1:01:00] you have to reach a certain speed to get
[1:01:02] enough lift oh you don't hear me I'm not
[1:01:04] an engineer but there's a spiritual
[1:01:06] anointing here this morning but the
[1:01:07] brand I'm call a spiritual scientist you
[1:01:09] have to have enough speed to pick up
[1:01:11] enough lift so that airplane can come up
[1:01:14] the ground you need a bigger engine this
[1:01:16] morning oh come on somebody preach back
[1:01:17] to me you need a bigger engine this
[1:01:19] morning a holy ghost powered engine to
[1:01:22] move you faster than you've ever moved
[1:01:24] before
[1:01:25] [Music]
[1:01:27] amen
[1:01:28] hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the
[1:01:31] Lord
[1:01:33] hallelujah oh Hallelujah I wonder what
[1:01:37] kind of engine Phillip had brother
[1:01:39] brother puncher to move where he was to
[1:01:42] go down into that Revival oh he had a
[1:01:44] different kind of engine it wasn't a
[1:01:46] regular a regular car engine it wasn't a
[1:01:49] plane engine it was a Holy Ghost Engine
[1:01:52] when that man came to Jesus and said
[1:01:54] listen listen my servant is
[1:01:57] sick he said you don't even need to come
[1:02:00] just speak the word and I know my
[1:02:02] servant will be healed I'm a man under
[1:02:04] Authority when I say to one go he goes
[1:02:07] and if you just say the word I know my S
[1:02:09] will be healed that man had such a
[1:02:11] revelation that by the time he was close
[1:02:13] to home he didn't ask them if he was
[1:02:15] healed he asked them what time what time
[1:02:18] he was healed because the word of God is
[1:02:20] sharper it's faster it's more powerful
[1:02:24] than any twoed sword and the church say
[1:02:27] [Applause]
[1:02:31] Amen we talking about breaking past
[1:02:34] barriers and we going to get to Breaking
[1:02:36] past your barrier so we speaking in
[1:02:39] general first and we're going to come to
[1:02:40] your personal
[1:02:43] barriers every four years or so there's
[1:02:45] are
[1:02:47] Olympics and in this Olympics they talk
[1:02:49] about the world
[1:02:52] record and it's amazing because years
[1:02:54] ago there were different records
[1:02:56] now look at me I'm no expert they are
[1:02:58] far more better experts here than these
[1:02:59] things I don't already follow these
[1:03:00] things
[1:03:02] but I shared with my daughter had a very
[1:03:04] bad experience with sports in
[1:03:06] school and that affected me so I've
[1:03:09] never been for those of you who know me
[1:03:10] I've never been a sports person Gideon
[1:03:13] and Andrew they were far more gifted
[1:03:16] than I
[1:03:17] was in that particular
[1:03:19] Ministry I told my daughter he was in
[1:03:22] form
[1:03:23] two I was the team chaplain
[1:03:27] they would only call me to
[1:03:30] pray but on that faithful day they were
[1:03:32] out of players and being short and of
[1:03:36] players and desperate for one last man
[1:03:39] you know in school when you pick you you
[1:03:41] you know first pick second pick well I
[1:03:43] was a the never
[1:03:46] pick but on this faithful day it was
[1:03:49] like they had no choice it was an
[1:03:52] interclass match and I was the
[1:03:55] Last Man
[1:03:57] Standing it was not I was not picked it
[1:04:00] just happened to be as the only man left
[1:04:02] so it was you had to play and my
[1:04:05] daughter when you tell her something she
[1:04:06] do doesn't forget it so she has asked me
[1:04:09] a few times about it but I remember all
[1:04:11] I remember is playing and every time I
[1:04:13] try to hit the ball to kick I fell
[1:04:15] down and you know how school children
[1:04:17] could be those things could haunt you
[1:04:18] for a
[1:04:19] while so I've never been W into sports
[1:04:22] but it is intriguing because someone
[1:04:24] who's been into sports and Usain Bolt
[1:04:26] comes to mind because before Usain Bolt
[1:04:28] ran there was records that were set
[1:04:30] before him and when he ran he broke and
[1:04:33] there was a new record set and it's
[1:04:36] called a new world record so you know
[1:04:38] how boring the Olympics will be if
[1:04:40] Nobody Breaks a
[1:04:42] record because the Olympics is more than
[1:04:45] what country wins is rarely to test and
[1:04:48] challenge what we believe to be possible
[1:04:50] before can the church say Amen so when
[1:04:53] somebody comes and they break a record
[1:04:55] it's like wo
[1:04:56] and this man is so fast or whatever that
[1:04:58] is and it's an encouragement because and
[1:05:00] it's amazing because over time records
[1:05:02] keep getting
[1:05:03] broken but there's such a thing as and
[1:05:05] and when you reach to speak to a real
[1:05:08] professional they start to talk about
[1:05:09] not necessarily running against the
[1:05:11] others but they talk about their own
[1:05:12] personal best so you'll see guys like
[1:05:15] Usain Bolt and these great athletes you
[1:05:17] know them better than I do they really
[1:05:18] at they reach a point where they don't
[1:05:20] even care what other people do when they
[1:05:21] want to beat their own personal record
[1:05:24] and it's a big thing when you break your
[1:05:26] own personal record and when you realize
[1:05:28] in life that you are racing not against
[1:05:31] anybody else but yourself your
[1:05:32] perspective
[1:05:35] changes let me say that one more time
[1:05:37] your race in life is not against anybody
[1:05:40] else because if you could keep beating
[1:05:42] your own personal best you could become
[1:05:45] Unstoppable you know half of the
[1:05:47] challenge we have is when you are
[1:05:49] looking at somebody else what this one
[1:05:51] doing what that one doing and you get so
[1:05:53] caught up because the amount of time you
[1:05:55] spend looking at what other people doing
[1:05:56] you could be focused on your own
[1:05:58] personal best I want to make a new
[1:06:00] record with my personal best when it
[1:06:02] comes to my prayer
[1:06:03] life can I break my personal record when
[1:06:06] it comes to forgiveness can I break my
[1:06:09] personal record when it comes to not
[1:06:12] gossiping yeah you ever hear somebody
[1:06:14] who who say like a recovering alcoholic
[1:06:17] I've been sober for 12 days I've been
[1:06:19] sober 30 days you would say I haven't
[1:06:22] gossiped in 20 days I haven't gossiped
[1:06:24] in I see some people here like I never
[1:06:27] thought of it like that boy it's been
[1:06:29] 180 days since I
[1:06:31] gossiped I was saying with my wife you
[1:06:34] could only get a breakthrough when we
[1:06:35] could first see your problem you know so
[1:06:37] that's why when you go to Alcoholics
[1:06:39] Anonymous you they say my name is Isaac
[1:06:41] and I'm an alcoholic if you can't even
[1:06:42] start there you can't get any help so my
[1:06:45] name is Isaac and I'm a gossiper it has
[1:06:47] been one day since my last gossip and
[1:06:50] you are now working in your life to keep
[1:06:53] breaking records oh come on somebody
[1:06:55] help me preach this
[1:06:57] morning whatever you're trying to
[1:06:59] overcome you have to first acknowledge
[1:07:01] it I'm a sinner I'm in trouble now it's
[1:07:03] been one day since I dropped that thing
[1:07:06] oh you don't hear me this
[1:07:08] morning we talking about breaking past
[1:07:10] your
[1:07:11] barriers because we all have barriers
[1:07:14] there are things that are holding us
[1:07:15] back because if you're trying to this is
[1:07:18] why I hope this helps you this
[1:07:20] morning whenever you Bard a plane
[1:07:22] there's a reason the a portion how much
[1:07:25] bags you could
[1:07:27] carry it is a federal offense to the
[1:07:29] airline to fly a overweight
[1:07:31] plane because if a plane is overweight
[1:07:34] the plane could crash so it's not just
[1:07:37] two bags and five bags they can tell you
[1:07:38] listen breads even if you're pay we
[1:07:40] can't carry that we to
[1:07:41] know because there's too much weight on
[1:07:43] the plane we don't want to meet a level
[1:07:46] of turbulence and we all going down and
[1:07:48] you and your bags going
[1:07:50] down so there's such a thing as being so
[1:07:53] heavy you can't break your barrier
[1:07:55] I want you to get this because you're
[1:07:57] carrying so much weight that you can't
[1:07:59] go where it's supposed to go because
[1:08:00] you're weigh down with lust you're weigh
[1:08:02] down with animosity you we Down With
[1:08:05] Envy you we down with your past you
[1:08:07] weigh down with guilt you we down with
[1:08:09] shame and embarrassment you there
[1:08:11] carrying the whole way to what people
[1:08:12] think about you you there stressed out
[1:08:14] about 22 years ago you stressed out
[1:08:16] about who will shake your hand you
[1:08:18] stressed about what SE your on you
[1:08:20] stressed out because nobody here call
[1:08:22] you and you just your whole plane you
[1:08:24] trying to move on you Runway and
[1:08:27] you your plane are going anywhere but if
[1:08:30] you get light this morning if you get
[1:08:33] light this morning then you can take off
[1:08:35] can the church say amen hallelujah
[1:08:38] hallelujah some of us too heavy this
[1:08:40] morning and we got to let things go let
[1:08:43] things go because that's a barrier
[1:08:45] because but the B describe it and I'm
[1:08:47] going to get to the court he said when
[1:08:48] it reach the barrier the plane begins to
[1:08:50] shake your can't afford to be heavy when
[1:08:52] the plane you have some pressure to
[1:08:54] break past the sound barrier you got to
[1:08:56] be sure that your plane could weather
[1:08:58] the storm of breaking past the oh come
[1:09:00] on now somebody help me this
[1:09:03] morning so I want to encourage you this
[1:09:05] morning if you have Arts today drop it
[1:09:08] throw it overboard let's open your plane
[1:09:11] this morning and let's have to pull some
[1:09:13] bags
[1:09:14] [Applause]
[1:09:16] out I'm trying to keep it as simple as
[1:09:18] possible cuz some people will miss it
[1:09:20] because they have too much
[1:09:22] stuff you may be seated
[1:09:27] and don't try
[1:09:28] no don't try no tricks in her brother
[1:09:32] Clark I know brother Clark used to work
[1:09:33] in the airport they have a weight
[1:09:35] restriction on you and a bag and I've
[1:09:38] seen people say listen that bag cannot
[1:09:40] go you have to take some stuff out and
[1:09:42] you have to decide if you go in or you
[1:09:43] staying because if you want to board a
[1:09:45] plane you have to take some stuff out
[1:09:46] the bag and when people open up their
[1:09:48] bag it's sometime it could be a little
[1:09:50] embarrassing thing you know because you
[1:09:51] there in the public you're holding up
[1:09:52] the line you they take out and when they
[1:09:54] watch it a set that shouldn't be
[1:09:59] flying and now the embarrassment they
[1:10:01] should have dealt with at home and ready
[1:10:03] check what this supp carry now in public
[1:10:05] all of you they watching
[1:10:06] you but where you going with that is
[1:10:09] royal castle is KFC is green seasoning

[1:10:24] of these things health hazard all kind
[1:10:26] of thing you're carrying ins anything
[1:10:28] and know decide do I carry three coconut
[1:10:30] 20 coconut two coconut and you did
[1:10:32] because you cannot carry everything and
[1:10:34] you understand to go to this Raptor you
[1:10:36] cannot carry everything all the thing
[1:10:38] you want to carry you can't carry the
[1:10:39] thing you work to fight for you can't
[1:10:42] carry where we going what you make sure
[1:10:44] you have there it has to be perfect love
[1:10:46] because only perfect oh God help me this
[1:10:47] morning only perfect love is what it can
[1:10:50] take over
[1:10:53] there that's why Paul said aside
[1:10:56] everything that so easily beset me I
[1:10:59] want to lay it aside so I could walk
[1:11:01] nothing must hold me back I want to
[1:11:03] approach the altar with nothing to stop
[1:11:05] me when the Lord see me coming he must
[1:11:07] say nothing against you nothing against
[1:11:09] you nothing against you nothing against
[1:11:12] [Applause]
[1:11:16] [Music]
[1:11:17] [Applause]
[1:11:20] you my husband do this my wife do this
[1:11:23] the children do this so you had to take
[1:11:24] 20 2 minutes in the service to just get
[1:11:27] to reboot your system to hear the
[1:11:35] word if he didn't talk to me so is had
[1:11:38] to be different you know but oh
[1:11:40] gosh and you realize that you can't
[1:11:42] control nobody else but you listen all
[1:11:45] of us struggleing with it or know this
[1:11:47] is not a huge struggle and I'm not
[1:11:48] struggling I have to reframe and reboot
[1:11:50] but wait a minute I can't control
[1:11:53] nobody I could help them I could talk to
[1:11:55] them but it's still their choice on how
[1:11:57] they behave but they have to learn to
[1:11:59] control your
[1:12:00] reaction you can't pray you can't get
[1:12:02] any spirit because somebody tell you
[1:12:04] something and a lot of the issues are in
[1:12:06] the home you know oh
[1:12:08] God should I drive down the
[1:12:12] road or hit braks because I can hit the
[1:12:17] braks some saying Drive some want to
[1:12:22] answer because the issues in because the
[1:12:25] people who closest to you have the most
[1:12:26] impact on you you know somebody BS you
[1:12:28] on on high low Massy something and and
[1:12:31] you could shake it off
[1:12:32] easier but somebody eat your a little
[1:12:34] yogurt in the fridge
[1:12:37] home and the neighbor had to know it was
[1:12:39] your yogurt and it was your flavor and
[1:12:41] it's two days you waiting to eat it and
[1:12:43] you had plans to eat it on Saturday
[1:12:45] morning and what really wrong with
[1:12:52] them and these are message believers we
[1:12:55] not talking no I'm not dealing with
[1:12:56] outside I dealing with
[1:13:00] here and the behavior that so easily
[1:13:03] beset as that if the Holy Spirit would
[1:13:04] want to walk in the house you say not
[1:13:05] now
[1:13:06] now you know that you ever meet somebody
[1:13:08] having a conversation and they say not
[1:13:11] now let me make a spin and come back
[1:13:14] because whatever going on the ID don't
[1:13:16] want again when that calm down I will
[1:13:17] come
[1:13:18] back and the Holy Spirit want to walk in
[1:13:21] the house any time don't give him a
[1:13:23] reason to say h let me come back
[1:13:24] tomorrow yes
[1:13:27] because as a child you're disrespecting
[1:13:28] your mother as a child you're
[1:13:30] disrespecting your father as a wife
[1:13:32] you're not referencing your husband as a
[1:13:33] husband you're not loving your wife we
[1:13:35] have to bring it back to the home
[1:13:36] because Ephesians is about the family
[1:13:38] being prepared to leave this place can
[1:13:40] the church say
[1:13:42] Amen you have to forgive me if I trying
[1:13:44] to keep it simple this morning but I see
[1:13:46] people a lot with a lot of word and they
[1:13:47] have no
[1:13:48] Behavior husband and wife can't behave
[1:13:51] children and parents can't behave you
[1:13:52] have no Rapture to go because Ephesians
[1:13:54] teach about the family unit being in
[1:13:57] order to leave this place somebody help
[1:13:59] me preach this
[1:14:01] [Applause]
[1:14:06] morning we have to get the family unit
[1:14:08] right not about oppression with an
[1:14:11] understanding of where we all fit
[1:14:13] because God is a god of
[1:14:14] order wives have a place husbands have a
[1:14:17] place fathers have a place children have
[1:14:19] a
[1:14:20] place and don't worry children you're
[1:14:22] going to grow up and the Lord carries
[1:14:24] you will have the same challenges and
[1:14:25] the same responsibilities and when you
[1:14:27] get older you'll reckon but wait a
[1:14:28] minute my parents were not as daed use a
[1:14:31] good word as I thought they
[1:14:35] were because now you have reached a
[1:14:37] certain level of maturity to understand
[1:14:38] certain things when I was a child I
[1:14:40] speak at a child the Bible said I
[1:14:42] understood as a child but when I became
[1:14:44] a man I put away childish
[1:14:49] things barriers are holding us back can
[1:14:54] the church say amen everybody feeling
[1:14:56] fine this
[1:14:59] morning I really want to salute brother
[1:15:01] Gideon for the service on Wednesday
[1:15:02] night God bless you brother
[1:15:05] [Applause]
[1:15:11] Gideon Wednesday was a promotion for
[1:15:17] him but Anthony wasn't well but Stephen
[1:15:19] couldn't make it and real Soul Thing You
[1:15:22] C be faint tell him the only thing he
[1:15:25] didn't do is play you
[1:15:27] know ask him ask him he was going to
[1:15:29] play and sing he say but he stood here
[1:15:33] and sng and preach and close out and so
[1:15:35] God bless you may God give you a
[1:15:37] strength and I only found out afterwards
[1:15:40] he wasn't even feeling well but he came
[1:15:42] to his poster
[1:15:43] Duty and many times because of the role
[1:15:46] we play in life we have to do things
[1:15:47] against our feelings we have to be a
[1:15:49] father when we need to be a father we
[1:15:51] have to be a mother we can't we can't
[1:15:52] say you know what I taking a time out
[1:15:56] coming back next week when I put back on
[1:15:57] the father hat on the mother
[1:16:00] hat don't let me TR when the father and
[1:16:02] the mother get
[1:16:03] sick because somehow when fathers get
[1:16:06] sick they can't
[1:16:08] move I come into the home and tell all
[1:16:10] come in here this morning when he father
[1:16:12] gets sick he can't move he can't move he
[1:16:14] can't move when he mother sick she said
[1:16:15] do everything anybody know what anybody
[1:16:18] here know what I'm talking about I see
[1:16:20] the wife's careful to answer you some
[1:16:23] real wisdom getting put here this
[1:16:24] morning
[1:16:26] morning I just say I've heard this
[1:16:28] complaint it's been
[1:16:33] complaint but so let let wisdom
[1:16:37] Prevail but the reality is this that's
[1:16:39] to nearly Point home our
[1:16:41] responsibilities in life sometimes
[1:16:43] requires to go beyond our
[1:16:45] feelings beyond the challenges we face
[1:16:47] because if we don't deal with it the
[1:16:49] problems don't
[1:16:50] disappear let me say that one more time
[1:16:53] sometimes we feel by ignoring the
[1:16:55] problem when we finish the problem will
[1:16:56] go away but there are some problems that
[1:16:58] even if you ignore them when you come
[1:17:00] out of your ignorance State you still
[1:17:02] have to confront the reality that the
[1:17:04] problem is still
[1:17:05] there and we have to get stronger to
[1:17:08] deal with the problems that
[1:17:13] exist breaking past your
[1:17:17] barriers familiar quote brother Bram
[1:17:20] going beyond the camp you know I was
[1:17:22] told some time ago that they had a plane
[1:17:25] now that can make them noises we hear
[1:17:26] around here that shakes the
[1:17:28] windows it's when the plane has got so
[1:17:31] fast that it crosses its own sound
[1:17:34] called sound barrier and when it goes
[1:17:37] beyond its own sound barrier it's almost
[1:17:39] unlimited to what it'll do I think in
[1:17:42] there that we get a lesson when we go
[1:17:44] beyond our own sound barrier into the
[1:17:46] word of God then it's unlimited what God
[1:17:49] can do with a man that's ready to go
[1:17:51] beyond the camp can the church say Amen
[1:17:54] so there there's this thing about this
[1:17:55] sound barrier your own limit of how much
[1:17:58] you pray how much you worship how much
[1:17:59] you sacrifice how much you give to you
[1:18:00] could break past your own limitation and
[1:18:03] reach into a realm that brother Adam
[1:18:05] said it's unlimited what God can do with
[1:18:07] a man do you understand that that a
[1:18:09] point that brother said that that you
[1:18:11] could live such a life that the devil
[1:18:12] don't know what to do with
[1:18:13] you I want that kind of life that the
[1:18:16] devil had to say you know what I fed up
[1:18:18] deiving brother Andy I go and find
[1:18:19] somewhere because everything I throw at
[1:18:21] him somebody we still in church somebody
[1:18:23] we still standing I do this I do this I
[1:18:25] do this I do this and nothing shaken him
[1:18:27] it don't make sense anymore because I've
[1:18:29] reached a point there is nothing could
[1:18:31] move him
[1:18:32] anymore the prophet say you can live
[1:18:34] such a life that the devil don't know
[1:18:36] what to do with you he tried this that
[1:18:37] fail he tried this that fail he tried
[1:18:39] that that fail and say I don't have
[1:18:41] anything else to know because the word
[1:18:42] tells us we are not ignorant of Satan's
[1:18:44] devices it means his devices are
[1:18:48] limited so we know what he coming with
[1:18:50] can the church say Amen but you can live
[1:18:52] such a life God help us to live such a
[1:18:54] life that the devil
[1:18:55] don't know what to do with you he he
[1:18:56] throw pain in your body but you still
[1:18:59] worship you know if you make your
[1:19:01] default response situations worship you
[1:19:04] know the devil will get just get
[1:19:08] confused let me say that one more time
[1:19:10] brother George make your default
[1:19:12] response
[1:19:14] worship let your automatically when they
[1:19:17] reset you the factory settings your de
[1:19:18] for response is worship you get a piece
[1:19:21] of bad news you worship you get good
[1:19:23] news you worship
[1:19:25] you're feeling sick you worship you want
[1:19:28] something you worship somebody do you
[1:19:30] some you worship yeah whatever it is but
[1:19:33] a Clarance you just worship and watch
[1:19:35] your whole approach to life change oh
[1:19:38] can the church say
[1:19:39] Amen dealing with the barriers the
[1:19:42] barriers let me read one example here we
[1:19:44] know
[1:19:45] it in Matthew
[1:19:50] 15 we preach this many time Matthew 15:
[1:19:53] 211 then Jesus went then and departed
[1:19:55] onto the coast of Ty and sidon and
[1:19:57] behold a woman of Canaan came out of the
[1:20:00] same coast and Cried unto him saying
[1:20:03] have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of
[1:20:07] David my daughter is grievously vexed
[1:20:09] with the devil so here we have a woman
[1:20:12] who has already broken past a major
[1:20:14] barrier because she's a Canaanite you
[1:20:16] know how hard it is for a Canaanite to
[1:20:18] even approach a Jew because Canaanites
[1:20:20] were sworn enemies of the Jews so she
[1:20:22] had to first break past her barrier that
[1:20:24] I'm a Canaanite and this is a Jude that
[1:20:26] I'm going to approach can the church say
[1:20:27] Amen so her situation became so
[1:20:30] desperate she didn't care no more what
[1:20:33] she had to overcome to get what she
[1:20:35] wanted and when you reach a point of
[1:20:37] desperation to don't care what nobody
[1:20:39] think or feel or see because you want to
[1:20:41] get something it'll change your whole
[1:20:43] approach so this woman come out and see
[1:20:45] Jesus and already she is saying things
[1:20:48] that don't make sense of her belief this
[1:20:50] is an enemy of the Jews saying oh Lord
[1:20:53] so she's acknowledg him as Lord yeah
[1:20:56] Jesus is no Lord to a Canaanite but this
[1:20:57] woman had to overcome what she believed
[1:21:00] oh you don't hear me this morning th son
[1:21:02] of David so she's recognizing what Jews
[1:21:05] of the day they even recognize with the
[1:21:08] chorge can the church say Amen my
[1:21:12] daughter is grievously vexed with it
[1:21:13] ever but he answered her not a word so
[1:21:16] it went from the barrier of who she was
[1:21:18] and the barrier of her belief system and
[1:21:20] the barrier that she's a Canaanite and
[1:21:22] the barrier that he's a Jew and the
[1:21:24] barrier that she had her own Gods and
[1:21:26] the barrier that she's acknowledged him
[1:21:27] as Lord and Son of David to the barrier
[1:21:30] of
[1:21:31] Silence could you handle the barrier of
[1:21:33] Silence could you handle the barrier of
[1:21:35] praying and God refuses to answer you
[1:21:38] because the time is not yet here it is
[1:21:40] this woman has already made an
[1:21:42] acknowledgement that others have refused
[1:21:43] to acknowledge I want you to understand
[1:21:45] the context of the situation they are
[1:21:47] Jews they are Pharisees they are
[1:21:49] Sadducees that don't even know who Jesus
[1:21:51] is and here's a woman who's a gentile
[1:21:54] saying Lord son of
[1:21:57] David she overcame religious beliefs and
[1:22:01] doctrines and all of these things and
[1:22:03] after that God even hit her BL and say
[1:22:06] you catch something other a catch he
[1:22:08] give us silent
[1:22:13] treatment anybody with me this morning
[1:22:16] how many of us and I want to bring it
[1:22:17] home how many of us say but you no
[1:22:18] longer praying for something and God are
[1:22:22] answering anybody ever found themselves
[1:22:24] saying
[1:22:25] how long I pray I he I would but this
[1:22:28] woman overcame that barrier
[1:22:31] also he answered her not a word so he
[1:22:34] answered and she switched strategies the
[1:22:37] Bible said and his disciples came and
[1:22:40] besought him saying send her away for
[1:22:43] she cried after us so when she realized
[1:22:46] that Jesus wasn't taking her on she
[1:22:48] start to go and touch Peter hey Peter
[1:22:50] Peter Peter Peter James James Peter
[1:22:54] Peter James John James John Peter James
[1:22:57] John Peter because Jesus not answering
[1:22:59] anything I want you to appreciate how
[1:23:02] persistent she
[1:23:03] became we know who this lady is you know
[1:23:06] but she's dealing with her situation and
[1:23:08] her situation is bigger than whatever
[1:23:09] she has to do she has overcome her
[1:23:12] belief to acknowledge who God is she has
[1:23:14] overcome her situation and say well if
[1:23:15] Jesus not hearing me let me go to the
[1:23:17] Elder let me go to the Deacon let me ask
[1:23:19] one of the ministers but I'm not leaving
[1:23:20] church today without what I come for I'm
[1:23:23] not leaving his service yester morning
[1:23:25] the same way that I came the situation
[1:23:27] when my daughter is too much and not
[1:23:29] going home not today I come too far to
[1:23:31] go back home this way James Peter John
[1:23:33] but Hugh but Joe I don't care who I to
[1:23:35] talk to I need to get somebody to let
[1:23:37] Jesus know I'm not going home today
[1:23:39] without getting a
[1:23:43] touch can the church say amen I come to
[1:23:46] Worship in a second right and his
[1:23:48] disciples came and besought him besought
[1:23:49] him means to beg him you know so they
[1:23:52] come and say Jesus do something now
[1:23:53] please because overbearing to us we can
[1:23:56] help her and we can handle this lady
[1:23:59] coming over and over saying that she
[1:24:00] need to get
[1:24:02] something send her away for she cried
[1:24:04] after us but he answered and said to
[1:24:07] them I am not
[1:24:08] sent but unto the Lost House of the
[1:24:11] sheep of Israel so he's saying I have
[1:24:14] come for anybody who is not a Jew so she
[1:24:16] could keep crying but IED him to help
[1:24:19] her then she changed strategy again she
[1:24:22] went from trying to get Jesus to to the
[1:24:24] disciples so they he say well here I
[1:24:26] come for you and she changed and look at
[1:24:28] the Bible says she came and worshiped
[1:24:30] him so her first approach brother George
[1:24:33] was one of making a request now she
[1:24:35] changed strategy to
[1:24:37] worship Hallelujah anybody seeing the
[1:24:39] keys being unlocked right here this
[1:24:41] morning many time we go to prayer and
[1:24:43] our prayer is Lord give me and Lord I
[1:24:45] need and Lord I want and Lord I
[1:24:46] desperate and Lord I need and Lord I
[1:24:48] want and l i desperate and here she said
[1:24:50] well if that didn't approach didn't work
[1:24:52] and I called you that he didn't answer
[1:24:54] and I went to the El Deon and answer let
[1:24:56] me te stry she just had to worship Lord

[1:25:17] his first response oh I want you I want

[1:25:29] changed then he answered it is not meat

[1:33:06] Jews but she did such a kind of worship
[1:33:09] that Jesus Took note of her worship so I
[1:33:11] don't care how long you've been in
[1:33:13] church I don't care how long you're in

[1:33:20] this was her first time because her

[1:33:30] need then worship if you have a big
[1:33:33] situation this morning worship if you
[1:33:35] don't have a situation that's fine you
