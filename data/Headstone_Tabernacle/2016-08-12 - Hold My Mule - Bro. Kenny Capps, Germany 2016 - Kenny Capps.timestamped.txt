[25:10] good morning
[25:13] church yeah when I came in and I looked
[25:17] upon this picture here in
[25:20] front the question came to me what is
[25:24] the attraction on the mountain amen amen
[25:30] when the Lord Jesus entered into
[25:33] Jerusalem sitting on and an
[25:37] ass the people recognized that scripture
[25:41] being
[25:42] fulfilled here before their eyes before
[25:45] their ears and they started to cry they
[25:48] started to call upon him and they say
[25:52] hosana blessed is he that cometh in the
[25:55] name of the Lord
[25:59] hosana oh Lord have
[26:02] mercy amen and here we are this morning
[26:06] and calling upon him that's right yeah I
[26:10] greet you you may be seated
[26:14] for I'm not going to preach but I'm just
[26:17] want to speak a few
[26:19] words before we enter into prayer and
[26:23] before we are sitting down and going to
[26:28] listen to the word brother zigma asked
[26:30] me to
[26:32] introduce the the preaching of the word
[26:38] and I don't know the the preacher
[26:41] personally I only heard about his name
[26:44] but we want to believe
[26:48] that when he is going to speak in the
[26:51] name of the Lord that the preacher will
[26:54] be the Holy
[26:56] Spirit
[26:58] and amen yeah I greet you all we just
[27:02] returned
[27:04] from a small missionary journey into
[27:07] Eastern Europe the Lord called me to do
[27:12] missionary work and we have tried to be
[27:17] faithful to our
[27:19] calling uh up until this time and uh we
[27:25] ask all we pray and we ask the Lord that
[27:28] he will keep us faithful until the
[27:32] end but um we bring greetings from the
[27:38] Believers in
[27:40] Poland in the Czech
[27:44] Republic when we left them they and we
[27:47] told them that we were going to see you
[27:50] here in conference in convention
[27:54] in uh the south of Germany they they
[27:57] asked us to pass on greetings to you and
[28:02] there is some meaning in
[28:08] that it's not just saying hello or
[28:11] saying
[28:13] uh how are you but when we pass on
[28:17] greetings as Believers then we pass on
[28:21] blessings we that's why we greet one
[28:24] another in the name of the Lord Jesus
[28:26] Christ
[28:28] amen so
[28:30] I trust that you will receive those This
[28:34] Love This few words of love and these
[28:37] few words of greeting uh in your
[28:42] heart brother Sigma also asked me to
[28:44] pray
[28:46] to have these prayer requests and to
[28:50] pray and before we are going to pray
[28:54] before we are going to call upon the
[28:56] Lord I want to remember you
[29:01] of the word of
[29:03] God that is speaking in for instance in
[29:07] First
[29:08] Corinthians U the 10th
[29:11] chapter
[29:13] uh here it's spoken
[29:18] that they all did drink of that
[29:23] spiritual
[29:26] Rock
[29:28] and that
[29:29] rock was following
[29:32] them and that
[29:35] rock that was
[29:37] Christ Christ the Rock that followed
[29:43] them
[29:46] and I remember the message and that was
[29:50] became also my inspiration during this
[29:54] last journey the ever present water of
[30:00] The
[30:01] Rock and there the prophet was speaking
[30:05] about Christ the Rock that follow
[30:11] them Christ the Rock once
[30:16] paten for
[30:19] all but when that rock followed
[30:24] them when they wanted to see this
[30:27] life that was coming from this
[30:32] rock flowing
[30:35] again they
[30:37] were asked or they were called by the
[30:40] Lord to speak to that rock to that same
[30:45] original Rock but not to beat That Rock
[30:49] a second time because that rock was
[30:52] beaten once and for
[30:55] all but from now they should call upon
[31:00] that rock and that
[31:04] rock followed them that rock stayed with
[31:10] them that rock never went out of visible
[31:16] distance or hearing distance or calling
[31:23] distance and so this
[31:25] morning I
[31:29] I want to know
[31:30] how to speak to that
[31:34] rock another
[31:37] time together with you here present but
[31:41] also in my
[31:44] individual walk with the
[31:47] Lord
[31:50] and because the scripture says in Romans
[31:56] 10 the righteousness of Faith
[32:00] speaketh this
[32:02] way do not
[32:05] say um in your heart who shall bring
[32:10] Christ down from
[32:14] heaven do not speak in your heart who
[32:17] shall bring Christ up from grave or from
[32:23] dead but the righteousness of faith
[32:26] speaketh this
[32:27] way
[32:29] near is the
[32:31] word near is Christ the anointed
[32:36] word it's in your
[32:40] heart and it's in your
[32:44] mouth the word the anointed word that we
[32:49] preached that we
[32:51] preach Christ the
[32:54] word that follow them
[32:58] I
[33:00] remember
[33:02] that in the time brother bandam
[33:06] visited South Africa and was
[33:14] having encounter with men that we all
[33:18] know from name because we've we find
[33:21] that throughout the message there was a
[33:23] man Sydney Jackson he came came from
[33:29] Pentecostal uh
[33:31] background and after hearing brother
[33:35] Brandon
[33:36] preaching about the Oneness of
[33:40] God and
[33:47] um all these uh truth after hearing he
[33:52] him being a true
[33:54] trinitarian uh believer
[33:59] preacher then he said to brother Ram
[34:02] brother R after hearing your preach I'm
[34:05] a little confused before I didn't know
[34:09] how to pray how to call upon the Lord I
[34:13] called upon the Lord as
[34:17] father and I called upon him in the name
[34:22] of the
[34:22] son and I called upon him through the
[34:27] holy spirit so I went that way to call
[34:31] upon him but now I do not know how to
[34:34] pray what to say how what to
[34:40] speak and the brother said to him
[34:44] brother Jackson brother Sydney I don't
[34:47] know how how he called him he said
[34:50] brother
[34:52] sney you
[34:54] speak you pray today that God that lives
[34:58] in You by his holy
[35:02] spirit

[35:14] requests here are few

[1:02:39] this
[1:02:44] week I don't
[1:02:46] believe SAR Coen brener organized these
[1:02:51] meetings I believe God Almighty
[1:02:53] organized this
[1:02:57] convention now he used our precious
[1:03:00] brother and his family and many friends
[1:03:02] and people in the church no doubt but I
[1:03:05] believe this convention was organized
[1:03:08] from the foundation of the
[1:03:14] world now I can't speak for you this
[1:03:16] morning but I take everything from God
[1:03:19] in a personal manner amen this
[1:03:22] convention was for me
[1:03:25] well I'm glad that you could come and be
[1:03:26] blessed but it was for
[1:03:28] me I've enjoyed myself
[1:03:32] thoroughly I've prayed I've sang I've
[1:03:36] shouted I've cried I've
[1:03:43] danced you see when we come to
[1:03:46] church we don't come to church just to
[1:03:50] come to church oh
[1:03:51] yes come on brother we come to church
[1:03:54] Church to have
[1:03:57] [Music]
[1:04:00] church I come to this
[1:04:03] convention to have
[1:04:06] church I don't know about everything
[1:04:08] that's going on and what this person
[1:04:09] believes and what that person
[1:04:11] believes that's fine and good but I came
[1:04:14] to have
[1:04:17] church I believe God has already met us
[1:04:20] in this convention but it's not over yet
[1:04:24] you if you have not received the
[1:04:27] blessing yet I believe you can receive
[1:04:29] it this morning
[1:04:36] amen we do thank brother colen
[1:04:40] brener and I must
[1:04:42] say I thank every Minister and every
[1:04:46] message that I've heard
[1:04:48] here I can take something good from
[1:04:50] every message I can take something good
[1:04:53] from every minist Minister and I'm going
[1:04:55] to tell you Minister Brothers something
[1:04:56] that have preached every one of you has
[1:04:59] said something that I'm going to
[1:05:02] [Applause]
[1:05:04] steal I'll be using it in the days and
[1:05:08] months and years to come because I
[1:05:10] believe it was God ordaining what
[1:05:12] happens in this
[1:05:14] meeting well we could go on and on
[1:05:19] uh this morning now listen I'm a little
[1:05:25] different some people say
[1:05:28] strange but I'm just a little
[1:05:30] different and uh God has given me a
[1:05:33] great rapport with the young people in
[1:05:36] this
[1:05:37] message probably like brother Ron
[1:05:39] Spencer I've done many many many many
[1:05:41] youth
[1:05:42] camps and
[1:05:45] uh most of the messages that he gives me
[1:05:49] I believe have been geared to the youth
[1:05:52] but then I got to thinking this morning
[1:05:54] you know we're all closer to 21 than
[1:05:56] we've ever been
[1:05:59] before so if you're here this morning
[1:06:01] and you're young or if you're young at
[1:06:03] heart I believe this message is for
[1:06:12] you this morning my subject is the power
[1:06:16] of
[1:06:23] praise
[1:06:24] [Applause]
[1:06:38] and you know like I said I'm
[1:06:42] Different my title this

[1:06:50] on my
[1:06:51] title is hold my my
[1:06:58] mule hold my mule I know it's a strange
[1:07:04] title but I believe God has something
[1:07:06] for us this morning let's go ahead and
[1:07:08] get into the word of God stand with me
[1:07:10] if you
[1:07:11] will and I'll be reading from Psalms 149
[1:07:14] and
[1:07:19] 150 Psalms
[1:07:22] 149 says praise ye the Lord sing unto

[1:08:08] their hand to execute vengeance upon the
[1:08:11] Heathen and punishments upon the people
[1:08:13] to bind their kings with chains and
[1:08:16] their nobles with feeds of iron to

[1:09:16] have gotten help Lord we believe that
[1:09:18] there's people here that have yet to get
[1:09:21] help God we're praying this morning that
[1:09:23] just one person may receive from Heaven
[1:09:25] this morning Lord the glory of God may
[1:09:28] come down Lord that one person it'll all
[1:09:31] be worth it all if one person can
[1:09:33] receive from Heaven this morning Lord we
[1:09:35] pray that you'd have your way Lord I
[1:09:37] pray that you'd move me aside Lord Lord
[1:09:39] you speak to your people through the
[1:09:40] word today have your way Lord bless your
[1:09:43] people in Jesus name we pray amen you
[1:09:45] may be
[1:09:47] seated that's
[1:09:50] fine now I've ask our brother from our
[1:09:54] church to help me this
[1:09:58] morning back home and sometimes there's
[1:10:01] there's a little
[1:10:03] debate I know Brothers if you go to
[1:10:06] preach for them if you're going to
[1:10:07] preach for me you got to preach out of
[1:10:09] the Bible put the Bible on the pull pit
[1:10:12] Don't Preach with an iPad Don't Preach
[1:10:14] with a
[1:10:18] laptop you have to
[1:10:20] preach out of the Bible
[1:10:26] I said why is
[1:10:31] that said we need to
[1:10:35] preach then other preachers they'll let
[1:10:37] you come preach with your iPad preach
[1:10:40] with your
[1:10:42] computer and I find that distracting we
[1:10:45] all claim to believe the same thing
[1:10:47] right so I asked these brothers I said
[1:10:50] why why why do you uh why do you let
[1:10:53] these brothers
[1:10:54] use iPads and computers they say oh it's
[1:10:57] just a tool it's just a tool to help the
[1:11:00] people receive and I agree with
[1:11:04] that some of them use
[1:11:06] PowerPoint nothing wrong with that it's
[1:11:09] just a tool well I'm a little
[1:11:12] different I like I'm going to use the
[1:11:15] organ as a
[1:11:16] tool to help the people receive this
[1:11:22] morning
[1:11:26] brother Brian Wallace from our church in
[1:11:27] Living Word Tabernacle in Gastonia North
[1:11:29] Carolina he's with us today and he's
[1:11:31] going to help us out just a little bit
[1:11:32] now he's he's a man he's a gentleman
[1:11:36] he's not a wild man he's not a man who's
[1:11:38] going to get out of order so I just
[1:11:41] trust that you'll receive him in the
[1:11:44] same Spirit you've received me this
[1:11:52] morning I want to begin to uh this
[1:11:55] morning by quoting from the prophet of
[1:11:57] God in a message called God revealing
[1:12:00] himself to his people brother brandham
[1:12:03] said this he said the word is a seed is
[1:12:06] that right he says that a SE SED in the
[1:12:09] ground and every seed will bring forth
[1:12:12] of its
[1:12:14] kind if you need
[1:12:16] salvation the seeds here if you need
[1:12:20] healing here's the seed in the word of
[1:12:22] God
[1:12:24] the word of God is a seed put it in your
[1:12:27] heart he says don't dig it up every
[1:12:30] morning to see if it's
[1:12:32] sprouted put it in your heart leave it
[1:12:36] there it's God's business to bring forth
[1:12:39] the
[1:12:40] Harvest you just leave it
[1:12:43] there water it by faith and praise God
[1:12:47] every day thanking him for it he said is
[1:12:51] that all right
[1:12:55] and maybe to just help us understand a
[1:12:58] little
[1:12:59] bit what the prophet of God said I want
[1:13:01] to tell a story this
[1:13:03] morning I want to tell a story of a man
[1:13:05] by the name of John
[1:13:08] Ryan many of you know now in the message
[1:13:11] we find two John
[1:13:13] Ryan probably brother George made
[1:13:15] reference to one yesterday it's an old
[1:13:16] man with a white beard behind the
[1:13:18] curtains and brother brandom said that
[1:13:20] was part of the success to his meetings
[1:13:22] that John Ryan the old man with a white
[1:13:23] beard would pray for his meetings but
[1:13:26] there was another John Ryan in the
[1:13:27] message this John Ryan was a blind man
[1:13:30] he couldn't see and brother brandom was
[1:13:33] having a meeting and he had a prayer
[1:13:35] line and John Ryan came up in the prayer
[1:13:40] line brother brandham said John Ryan
[1:13:43] what would you have from the Lord this
[1:13:45] morning John Ryan said brother brandham
[1:13:48] he said you know he said I'm blind I
[1:13:50] can't see he said I would that God would
[1:13:52] give me my ey
[1:13:57] eyesight now I may be dramatizing just a
[1:14:00] little bit but not
[1:14:03] much true
[1:14:05] story brother brandom looked at
[1:14:08] him didn't even pray for him he said
[1:14:11] John Ryan go from this place and confess
[1:14:15] that God has given your eyesight and you
[1:14:17] shall
[1:14:18] [Music]
[1:14:22] see
[1:14:23] John Ryan left
[1:14:26] now John Ryan was a newspaper
[1:14:30] man and he would stand out on the corner
[1:14:32] as an old blind man and he would sell
[1:14:36] newspapers and he would stand out there
[1:14:38] on the corner and he would say extra
[1:14:41] extra read all about
[1:14:43] it and he would give the headlines of
[1:14:45] the day and people would buy his
[1:14:51] newspapers extra extra every day extra
[1:14:54] extra read all about
[1:14:59] it sometime later he came through
[1:15:02] brother branham's prayer line
[1:15:04] again brother brandham saidj John Ryan
[1:15:06] why are you here he said brother
[1:15:08] brandham you said God would heal my eyes
[1:15:11] he said I'm still blind I can't
[1:15:13] see brother random said John Ryan I told
[1:15:16] you to go from this place and confess
[1:15:19] your healing and praise God for your
[1:15:21] healing and he said you'll receive your
[1:15:26] eyesight John Ryan finally got a
[1:15:30] revelation the next day on the street
[1:15:32] corner he went out there and he said
[1:15:35] extra extra read all about it man who
[1:15:38] was once blind can now
[1:15:45] see he was still blind is a bat next day
[1:15:49] extra extra Read All About It God has
[1:15:52] healed a blind man man every day he
[1:15:55] started praising God for giving him his
[1:15:57] eyesight out in public on the street
[1:16:01] corner one
[1:16:03] day John Ryan walked into a barber
[1:16:08] shop to get his haircut he walked in
[1:16:12] that barber
[1:16:13] shop he sat down in that barber
[1:16:20] chair the barber began talking to him
[1:16:25] you Brothers know how it is Barbara put
[1:16:28] that apron up around him started talking
[1:16:30] to him he said John
[1:16:34] Ryan he said we've known you for years
[1:16:36] in this
[1:16:38] community he said people are starting to
[1:16:41] call you a crazy man he said you're
[1:16:45] standing out here on this street corner
[1:16:47] and you're confessing and praising God
[1:16:49] for healing you and we know you're a
[1:16:51] blind as a bat he he said people are
[1:16:54] starting to talk John Ryan he said
[1:16:55] you're a crazy
[1:16:57] man about that
[1:16:59] time the spirit of God Came Upon John
[1:17:03] Ryan God opened his eyes John Ryan
[1:17:07] jumped up out of that barber chair he
[1:17:09] threw down that apron he ran out of that
[1:17:11] barber shop I can see I can see I can
[1:17:22] see
[1:17:25] church we need some more John ryes
[1:17:28] around the
[1:17:29] message it's time you start confessing
[1:17:32] and start it's time you start believing
[1:17:34] God we've heard it preached for 60 years
[1:17:38] we've heard what the prophet of God said
[1:17:40] for 60 years why are we still in the
[1:17:43] condition we're
[1:17:45] [Applause]
[1:17:49] in we need some more John Ryan
[1:17:54] [Applause]
[1:17:55] [Music]
[1:17:57] brother brandom
[1:17:58] says the right mental attitude toward
[1:18:02] any promise of God will bring it to pass
[1:18:05] in your
[1:18:08] life our bodies are made up of 16
[1:18:12] elements of
[1:18:13] earth we are the Earth the word of God
[1:18:17] is a
[1:18:18] seed in this seed is everything we have
[1:18:22] need of
[1:18:24] and we know that every seed will bring
[1:18:28] forth of its own
[1:18:31] kind now this
[1:18:34] morning do you need
[1:18:36] salvation the seed is there do you need
[1:18:40] healing the seed is
[1:18:43] there do you need the Holy
[1:18:46] Ghost the seed is
[1:18:50] there maybe young person you need a
[1:18:54] Godly husband or a
[1:18:56] wife it applies to you too the seed of
[1:19:01] there whatever you have need of in your
[1:19:03] life the seed is in the word of God if
[1:19:08] you can believe God's word you can
[1:19:10] receive everything that you have need of
[1:19:14] the word is a seed Church the revealed
[1:19:17] word is a seed put it in your heart
[1:19:20] don't dig it up ever so often to see if
[1:19:23] it's growing just put it in your heart
[1:19:25] and leave it
[1:19:26] there you planted it now it's God's
[1:19:30] business to bring forth the Harvest it's
[1:19:33] not your
[1:19:34] business now we've got some Farmers here
[1:19:38] I know you don't plant a natural seed
[1:19:41] then go out and dig it up in the Earth
[1:19:43] every few days to check on
[1:19:46] it but we have a tendency to do that
[1:19:50] with spiritual
[1:19:51] seeds
[1:19:54] want your brothers be seated I I I I I
[1:19:56] know what it's like to sit there and
[1:19:57] want to see the man of God and somebody
[1:19:59] standing in front of you all the time
[1:20:02] there's nothing wrong with it just we
[1:20:04] need to consider others
[1:20:08] also we have a tendency to want to dig
[1:20:11] up this spiritual
[1:20:14] seed sometimes we
[1:20:18] think you
[1:20:19] know I just wonder if I really did get
[1:20:22] sack
[1:20:23] saved I don't feel saved well listen
[1:20:26] church I got news for you I don't feel
[1:20:28] saved most of the time I don't feel
[1:20:31] saved most of the time I don't feel like
[1:20:33] a human being but that has nothing to do
[1:20:35] with it we go by the word of God we
[1:20:39] don't go by our
[1:20:46] feelings or maybe we think well I know I
[1:20:52] I prayed and I know the pastor prayed
[1:20:55] that I would be healed of this
[1:20:58] sickness but it seems like it's just not
[1:21:03] happening I still feel sick church
[1:21:07] that's the
[1:21:08] devil trying to talk you out of what God
[1:21:12] has already done for you at
[1:21:15] Calvary the prophet of God said there is
[1:21:18] nothing negative about the Holy Ghost
[1:21:20] did you know he said that he said there
[1:21:22] is nothing negative about the Holy Ghost
[1:21:25] he said everything about the Holy Ghost
[1:21:27] is
[1:21:29] positive I didn't say it he said it I'm
[1:21:33] just telling you what he
[1:21:35] said if you have the seed of
[1:21:38] God down inside you you just need to
[1:21:41] cultivate that seed you need to water it
[1:21:45] with your praise to make it
[1:21:50] grow brother random gave us the formula
[1:21:53] how do we water that spiritual word seed
[1:21:56] he said we water it by Our
[1:22:03] Praise now I want you to get this part
[1:22:06] because if you get if you miss this part
[1:22:07] you'll miss the rest of the
[1:22:09] sermon it's so very important that we
[1:22:12] learn to praise God Psalms 22 and3 says
[1:22:17] God inhabits the Praises of his
[1:22:21] people
[1:22:25] now listen to me church I'm not here
[1:22:28] this morning promoting a bunch of worked
[1:22:32] up jumped up pumped up emotion that's
[1:22:36] not what we're talking about I'm just
[1:22:38] talking about praising God in your own
[1:22:41] way some may shout some may run some may
[1:22:46] dance some may
[1:22:47] cry but just praise God in your own
[1:22:51] way
[1:22:54] some just stand still and A Tear
[1:22:56] trickles down their
[1:22:57] face but when we praise
[1:23:00] him it gets us into the
[1:23:04] spirit What Spirit the Holy
[1:23:08] Spirit we need to be in the spirit we
[1:23:12] need to live in the spirit we need to go
[1:23:15] to school in the spirit we need to go to
[1:23:18] work in the spirit we need to come to
[1:23:20] church in the spirit
[1:23:25] we got too many
[1:23:26] people well I guess I'll go to church I
[1:23:30] hope they say something that'll get me
[1:23:33] in the spirit I just feel so bad as old
[1:23:36] brother juel says woy wowy woy
[1:23:40] me I'm so down and out I sure hope that
[1:23:44] they can do something to help me this
[1:23:46] morning well how about you getting on
[1:23:48] your knees and praising God before you
[1:23:50] come to church get your mind off
[1:23:52] yourself and get your mind on God's work
[1:23:55] and help somebody
[1:24:00] else I was recent recently traveling to
[1:24:03] Arkansas for a
[1:24:05] convention it's about a 12-hour trip
[1:24:07] from my house and I like to listen to
[1:24:09] different preachers on the radio as I
[1:24:12] drive Arkansas is in the South North
[1:24:14] Carolina where I where I live is in the
[1:24:17] South and you can always find a lot of
[1:24:19] preaching and a lot of uh uh uh gospel
[1:24:22] singing in on the radio in the
[1:24:24] South I heard a preacher say something
[1:24:27] that has stuck with me it really it
[1:24:30] really struck me he
[1:24:34] said in Israel there's two
[1:24:39] Seas he says there's the Sea of
[1:24:42] Galilee and there's the Dead
[1:24:44] Sea he said now both of these
[1:24:48] seas are fed by the River
[1:24:51] Jordan
[1:24:53] and we know the River Jordan is a symbol
[1:24:55] of death but the water in the River
[1:24:58] Jordan is a symbol of
[1:25:00] life he said now he said I look at the
[1:25:04] Sea of Galilee fed by the River
[1:25:08] Jordan and he said there's 27 different
[1:25:11] kinds of fish life in the Sea of Galilee
[1:25:14] he said on the shores of the Galilee he
[1:25:16] says there's beautiful vegetation
[1:25:19] hundreds of different kinds of flowers
[1:25:21] and plants he said it's a beautiful
[1:25:23] place he said but then you go to the
[1:25:26] Dead Sea and there's nothing but
[1:25:28] stagnation and bitterness and there's
[1:25:31] nothing of beauty there's nothing of
[1:25:33] life he said what's the difference he
[1:25:37] said I'll tell you the difference he
[1:25:40] said the Sea of Galilee it takes that
[1:25:44] water in at one point and it releases
[1:25:47] that water out at another point he said
[1:25:50] the Dead Sea is it takes that water in
[1:25:53] but it keeps it there and it doesn't
[1:25:55] flow out and it becomes stagnant he said
[1:25:59] I believe we've got two different kind
[1:26:01] of seas in our
[1:26:03] churches he said we've got those and
[1:26:07] they'll take it in and they'll give it
[1:26:09] out and he said those are the happiest
[1:26:11] people in the
[1:26:13] world but he says those who want to take
[1:26:16] it in and just do nothing with it he
[1:26:19] said they become
[1:26:21] stagnant
[1:26:26] I don't know what kind of preacher he
[1:26:28] was but he made a lot of sense in what
[1:26:30] he said
[1:26:32] there the word of
[1:26:35] God is as a seed and we water that seed
[1:26:38] with our
[1:26:40] praise I'm talking this morning about
[1:26:42] the holy spirit it's a spirit that
[1:26:45] produces praise it's a spirit that
[1:26:48] produces
[1:26:51] worship
[1:26:52] whatever little portion of that seed of
[1:26:55] the revealed word we can get down into
[1:26:58] our heart and our soul our Earth we
[1:27:01] should want to make it grow do you
[1:27:03] agree we should strive to make it
[1:27:07] grow now I'm getting to be an old man I
[1:27:11] don't feel
[1:27:13] old I I still feel like a young person
[1:27:16] but when I look in the mirror I realize
[1:27:18] I'm
[1:27:19] not but I've learned that
[1:27:22] I've learned a few things in my
[1:27:25] life I've learned that the word of God
[1:27:28] is
[1:27:30] right I've learned that the message of
[1:27:33] the hour is right I have learned that
[1:27:36] Elijah is
[1:27:38] right I've learned that if I praise the
[1:27:41] Lord I will grow in faith I will grow in
[1:27:45] Grace I will grow in Mercy I will grow
[1:27:48] into the stature of a perfect
[1:27:51] man
[1:27:53] and I have learned that I can grow into
[1:27:56] a mansion in my father's
[1:28:00] house it's amazing the older you get the
[1:28:03] more you
[1:28:05] learn now this little message I've got a
[1:28:07] lot of
[1:28:08] quotes is that all right y'all like is
[1:28:11] that all
[1:28:12] right if anybody if anyone's got a
[1:28:15] problem with me reading quotes I want
[1:28:17] you to stand up this morning make your
[1:28:18] make yourself
[1:28:20] known and when you do I'm going to tell
[1:28:22] all these other people to throw you
[1:28:25] [Applause]
[1:28:28] out and the message the resurrection of
[1:28:31] Lazarus preached in Cleveland
[1:28:34] Ohio brother brandom
[1:28:37] says this is your
[1:28:39] prophet he said that's what's the matter
[1:28:42] with the church today we need a
[1:28:45] Revival we don't need a new
[1:28:47] Seminary we don't need new preachers we
[1:28:50] don't need new church build buildings we
[1:28:53] need a Revival in what we already
[1:28:56] got he said that's what we need we need
[1:28:58] a stirring
[1:29:00] up and our brother Isaac quoted the
[1:29:03] other day I thought he was going to jump
[1:29:04] all over my
[1:29:07] message he said that's what the world
[1:29:09] needs today is an
[1:29:13] oldfashioned God sent sky blue sin
[1:29:18] killing
[1:29:20] religion he said we need an old St
[1:29:23] Paul's
[1:29:24] Revival and we need the Bible Holy Ghost
[1:29:27] back in the
[1:29:32] church oh
[1:29:34] church if we could just get a
[1:29:37] revelation of a few simple things then
[1:29:41] we can get a revelation of the deeper
[1:29:47] things if we could just get a revelation
[1:29:51] of Revival
[1:29:52] in the
[1:29:53] message if we could just get a
[1:29:55] revelation of
[1:29:57] truth if we could just get a revelation
[1:29:59] of who we
[1:30:01] are you have to know who you
[1:30:04] are all it seems like all the preachers
[1:30:06] are preaching you have to know who you
[1:30:09] are you have to know who you are it's
[1:30:12] not good enough that mommy knows who you
[1:30:14] are or daddy knows who you are or the
[1:30:17] pastor knows who you are you got to know
[1:30:19] who you are and who you are is Mrs Jesus
[1:30:29] Christ if we could just get a revelation
[1:30:32] of Praise I wonder where we would be
[1:30:34] today oh
[1:30:37] my another little simple
[1:30:40] Revelation if we could just get a
[1:30:42] revelation of who our pastor
[1:30:44] is we don't we have people around they
[1:30:46] don't even have any idea who their
[1:30:48] Pastor is but the prophet of God said
[1:30:51] you need a pastor
[1:30:53] P that's what he said you need a
[1:31:00] pastor if we had if we had people who
[1:31:02] could get a revelation of who their
[1:31:04] Pastor
[1:31:07] is we probably wouldn't have so many
[1:31:10] Church
[1:31:16] hoers man y'all getting
[1:31:20] quiet Church HPP
[1:31:23] they like grasshoppers you ever seen
[1:31:25] grasshoppers they always
[1:31:28] hopping hopping here hopping
[1:31:33] there am I speaking to somebody this
[1:31:39] morning I know the PE I know people in
[1:31:41] North
[1:31:42] Carolina they have hopped to every
[1:31:45] Church in the area and we've got 40
[1:31:48] churches in the area and a lot of them
[1:31:51] are on their second time or third time
[1:31:53] [Music]
[1:31:55] around the brother said we need to get
[1:32:01] satisfied always hopping no
[1:32:06] Revelation and this
[1:32:09] morning I'm kind of like brother random
[1:32:11] in the message he preached believe us
[1:32:13] now
[1:32:16] this he said that's what's the matter in
[1:32:19] all these countries now he didn't say in
[1:32:23] us or Canada he said that's what's the
[1:32:26] matter in all these countries now and
[1:32:28] all around the
[1:32:30] world we got too many cold formal
[1:32:37] churches having a form of
[1:32:40] godliness and denying the power
[1:32:44] thereof what we need today this is your
[1:32:47] Prophet what we need today is get a
[1:32:49] little starch out of the church
[1:32:54] and that goes for message churches
[1:32:57] [Applause]
[1:32:59] too he said we've got too many
[1:33:03] churches they're afraid of this they're
[1:33:06] afraid of that they're afraid of the
[1:33:08] other thing he said when you forget this
[1:33:12] when you forget that when you forget
[1:33:14] about the other
[1:33:17] thing and when you get in Christ yes sir
[1:33:21] he said the Holy Ghost can have the
[1:33:24] right of away am
[1:33:39] amen church I didn't say it your Prophet
[1:33:44] said it if you got a problem with it
[1:33:47] take it up with him when you get over
[1:33:50] there if you get over
[1:34:02] there this is the Malachi 45 Prophet
[1:34:06] this is the Revelation 107 Prophet this
[1:34:09] is the St Luke 17:30
[1:34:14] Prophet hallu I don't know if I should
[1:34:16] go on or not Church it gets worse it
[1:34:20] gets worse
[1:34:22] or if you're like me it gets
[1:34:24] better all right sounds like somebody
[1:34:27] wants it here's what he says the same
[1:34:31] message he said you are going to call me
[1:34:34] a Holy Roller
[1:34:41] anyhow so I might just as well let
[1:34:44] loose that's right God's spirit will
[1:34:48] make you
[1:34:49] loose he said maybe I am a Holy
[1:34:55] Roller if I
[1:34:57] am I am the happiest Holy Roller you've
[1:35:00] ever seen Hallelujah
[1:35:07] Glory I believe he was our
[1:35:11] example I'm one of the happiest holy
[1:35:13] rers you'll ever
[1:35:20] see and I and I'm not ashamed of
[1:35:24] [Applause]
[1:35:47] it now before before we go any further I
[1:35:53] need to tell you a little
[1:35:55] story I need to tell you a little
[1:35:59] story about a

[2:06:12] rooster it's breaking
[2:06:15] day that's his nature
[2:06:21] his
[2:06:22] nature is to
[2:06:24] Crow when the light comes
[2:06:32] on and he said when a man is born of the
[2:06:36] spirit of God and when he has eternal
[2:06:40] life down inside him when the Holy Ghost
[2:06:44] comes he's got to scream out he's got to
[2:06:49] Crow something like that old
[2:06:56] rooster when you get the Holy
[2:07:00] Ghost now it may come in different forms

[2:07:06] going to hear you
[2:07:12] going
[2:07:17] hallu
[2:07:22] sometimes I wonder how many people in
[2:07:25] the message really have the Holy
[2:07:28] Ghost he said there's a
[2:07:31] nature inside of you that makes you
[2:07:34] scream

[2:07:53] [Applause]
[2:08:10] now I've told you about two John's this
[2:08:13] morning I want to tell you about another
[2:08:17] John now we're talking about the power
[2:08:20] of praise amen and what it'll bring you
[2:08:22] to amen you can read it in
[2:08:25] Revelation
[2:08:27] 1-10 this one is John the
[2:08:32] Revelator we're told that John was in
[2:08:34] the spirit on the Lord's day now church
[2:08:38] I don't know what your Revelation
[2:08:40] is but the Lord's day is this
[2:08:47] day
[2:08:49] John was transported over to this day
[2:08:52] this age we are living in the Lord's day
[2:08:56] we are living in the Lord's age we are
[2:08:59] living in the bride age we are living in
[2:09:01] the Rapture age we're living in the
[2:09:02] Judgment age we're living in the coming
[2:09:04] of the Lord
[2:09:08] age and this is the day that John would
[2:09:11] transported over to amen this day is the
[2:09:15] bride's day this is the day
[2:09:19] that all the great men in the Bible and
[2:09:20] all the great Patriarchs and Prophets of
[2:09:22] old long to
[2:09:25] see the prophet of God said if you would
[2:09:27] give those old Patriarchs their choice
[2:09:30] of what age they would live in they
[2:09:32] would choose this
[2:09:34] age because this is the age of the
[2:09:38] greatest
[2:09:47] overcoming
[2:09:49] did you know the Bible
[2:09:53] says they
[2:09:55] overcame by their testimony by their
[2:09:58] blood of the lamb and their
[2:10:02] testimony
[2:10:04] church if there's an area of your life
[2:10:08] that you're not
[2:10:10] overcoming there's nothing wrong with
[2:10:12] the blood it must be your
[2:10:16] testimony thank you God bless you you
[2:10:20] need a testimony amen if you're going to
[2:10:22] be an overcomer am you need a testimony
[2:10:31] amen John was transported over to this
[2:10:35] day the Bible says now John was in the
[2:10:40] spirit brother brandom says the first
[2:10:42] thing to do church is to get in the
[2:10:45] spirit that's what we're preaching about
[2:10:47] today
[2:10:49] he said how is revelation going to come
[2:10:52] if we don't ever get into the
[2:10:54] spirit how are you going to get the Holy
[2:10:57] Ghost if you don't get into the spirit
[2:10:59] Hallelujah church as I said before we
[2:11:02] don't come to church just to come to
[2:11:05] church we come to church to have
[2:11:12] church some of the black people down in
[2:11:15] North Carolina and South Carolina they
[2:11:16] say it like this we come having
[2:11:22] chch is that right brother Brian we
[2:11:25] having
[2:11:26] Chet I I I just never did understand
[2:11:29] that but but they're happy you
[2:11:37] know in the
[2:11:39] message patmas
[2:11:42] Vision I love quotes don't
[2:11:47] you
[2:11:50] the message Fatma Vision preached in
[2:11:54] Jeffersonville now
[2:11:57] listen I don't know
[2:12:02] yeah brother Ram says when you was a
[2:12:05] sinner and you went to a
[2:12:09] dance you got in the spirit of that
[2:12:14] dance he said oh my you started Clapping
[2:12:17] Your Hands
[2:12:18] you started patting your feet and you
[2:12:21] started started Shin digging and
[2:12:23] throwing your hat on the floor and going
[2:12:26] around and around and acting
[2:12:28] silly that's what the prophet
[2:12:32] said he said you was in the spirit of
[2:12:35] the dance
[2:12:40] amen he said could you imagine a fella
[2:12:44] going to a
[2:12:46] dance just sitting down on all the
[2:12:49] time and saying
[2:12:52] well looks like you all are having a
[2:12:54] pretty good
[2:12:57] time he said his friends would say hey
[2:13:01] buddy get out of here that's
[2:13:03] right you're just an old
[2:13:07] Wallflower or he said you go to a ball
[2:13:12] game and somebody knocks a home run in
[2:13:16] the baseball game or we could say kick a
[2:13:19] goal in the soccer
[2:13:23] game and you sit
[2:13:27] down and you say that's pretty
[2:13:34] good he said no no you wouldn't be a
[2:13:38] real sports fan that's right because
[2:13:40] when somebody hits a home run or some
[2:13:43] kicks a goal you're going to stand up
[2:13:47] you're going to jump
[2:13:52] and you're going to holler hooray
[2:14:03] Whoopi
[2:14:04] hallu he said you're going to jump and
[2:14:07] you're going to knock somebody's hat off
[2:14:09] their head
[2:14:13] brother and he said you know the funny
[2:14:15] thing is when you do that
[2:14:18] nobody says a word to
[2:14:23] you William Marian brandom said these
[2:14:31] things but he said then you go to
[2:14:36] church and
[2:14:38] when somebody raises up and jumps up and
[2:14:44] runs down the aisle and says Glory
[2:14:46] Hallelujah praise the
[2:14:50] Lord he said somebody will turn around
[2:14:53] and say you Holy
[2:14:56] Roller you're just an old Holy
[2:14:59] Roller Oh
[2:15:08] my he said I'm going to ask you a
[2:15:12] question If We Are Holy
[2:15:15] Rollers because we do that
[2:15:20] he said then them other people speaking
[2:15:23] against us they must be Unholy
[2:15:30] rollers life is full of choices brother
[2:15:33] Tim you can choose to be a Holy
[2:15:38] Roller
[2:15:41] Glory or you can
[2:15:44] choose to be an Unholy roller
[2:15:50] I'm a Holy
[2:15:53] Roller I'm not an Unholy
[2:15:56] [Applause]
[2:15:58] [Music]
[2:15:58] [Applause]
[2:16:08] roller God bless you
[2:16:16] Brothers
[2:16:26] brother random said now John was in the
[2:16:28] spirit on the aisle of patmas he said he
[2:16:31] got in the spirit now we're talking
[2:16:33] about the power of praise and where
[2:16:36] it'll lead you he said John got in the
[2:16:39] spirit then things began to take
[2:16:43] place when John got in there he heard a
[2:16:46] trumpet sound
[2:16:49] brother brand says now trumpet always
[2:16:51] announces the approaching of something
[2:16:54] or somebody
[2:16:56] important like when a king is
[2:16:59] approaching they'll always sound your
[2:17:04] trumpet when King Jesus
[2:17:07] comes he'll sound a trumpet is that
[2:17:11] right he
[2:17:12] says when Joseph went
[2:17:15] forth they sounded the
[2:17:18] trumpet and now something's coming is
[2:17:22] that
[2:17:24] right John got in the spirit and he
[2:17:27] heard a trumpet he heard a trumpet and
[2:17:30] he turned to look to see what was behind
[2:17:35] him but he heard the
[2:17:38] trumpet after he got in the
[2:17:41] spirit church I'm trying to take you
[2:17:43] someplace this morning some of you don't
[2:17:46] want to go there that's
[2:17:49] okay he said I believe John was dancing
[2:17:52] and jumping and running all around that
[2:17:54] Island he said there was nothing there
[2:17:56] but Cactus and sand and snakes and
[2:17:58] scorpions but he says John was having a
[2:18:00] good time he was in the spirit he was
[2:18:03] having a good time in the St Spirit he
[2:18:06] was just praising God because that's
[2:18:08] exactly what happened when the spirit
[2:18:10] fell on them on the day of
[2:18:13] Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell on
[2:18:15] them they staggered like drunk men and
[2:18:17] women and they acted like they were
[2:18:19] drunk and they were jabbering and they
[2:18:21] were carrying on till the people said
[2:18:24] these people are full of new
[2:18:29] wine oh here comes a hard here comes a
[2:18:31] hard
[2:18:36] part he said those people are full of
[2:18:38] new wine he said if that's the way they
[2:18:41] acted the First
[2:18:43] Time come on now come on when the spirit
[2:18:47] come comes again he'll probably act the
[2:18:50] same
[2:19:02] way he said there's nothing new about
[2:19:05] this message he says this is an oldtime
[2:19:08] religion
[2:19:09] [Applause]
[2:19:15] I by the way are you still holding my
[2:19:18] mule this
[2:19:27] morning still in the patmas vision
[2:19:30] brother said John was in the spirit on
[2:19:32] the Lord's day he was transferred
[2:19:34] transferred from the aisle in the spirit
[2:19:37] over into the Lord's day as soon as he
[2:19:39] got over to the Lord's day he heard a
[2:19:40] trumpet it's somebody approaching a
[2:19:42] great one is
[2:19:45] approaching let me just stop there and
[2:19:46] give you a little test have your seats
[2:19:54] brother few years ago I was
[2:19:58] invited to go to a pro-life
[2:20:02] seminar in a big denominational
[2:20:05] church and this whole seminar was
[2:20:08] speakers all day of course speaking
[2:20:11] against abortion and speaking for life
[2:20:14] of the babies and I heard many different
[2:20:16] speeches and and a little uh lessons
[2:20:20] that day but one thing stuck with
[2:20:23] me one
[2:20:25] speaker was
[2:20:27] speaking she says you know it's amazing
[2:20:29] here in the
[2:20:30] US she
[2:20:33] says when Moses was a
[2:20:39] baby the Pharaoh represented the
[2:20:41] government of that day
[2:20:43] right and she said the Pharaoh ordered
[2:20:48] that all the babies be killed now why
[2:20:50] did he do that he did did that BEC
[2:20:54] because he heard there was a king coming
[2:20:57] there was somebody coming to usurp his
[2:21:00] throne so he ordered all the babies to
[2:21:03] be
[2:21:04] killed he said in the days of Jesus when
[2:21:08] he was a
[2:21:09] baby he said Herod represented the
[2:21:13] government and said Herod heard that
[2:21:16] there was a king going to be born so he
[2:21:19] ordered that all the babies be
[2:21:23] killed he
[2:21:25] said I think our US government is
[2:21:29] afraid
[2:21:32] because they know that there's a king
[2:21:35] coming and he said through the
[2:21:38] government they're sponsoring the
[2:21:40] abortions of millions and millions of
[2:21:43] baby in our country every year he said I
[2:21:45] believe our government is fearful that
[2:21:47] somebody's going to come and put them
[2:21:49] out of a job you know I believe there's
[2:21:51] some truth to that they don't know what
[2:21:53] they're
[2:21:57] doing millions of babies being aborted
[2:22:00] every
[2:22:03] year brother random says the greatest of
[2:22:05] all
[2:22:06] Revelations is the deity the Supreme
[2:22:09] deity of our Lord Jesus Christ he said
[2:22:12] you can't get to first base until you
[2:22:15] believe the greatest of all Revelations
[2:22:18] the Supreme deity of the Lord Jesus
[2:22:21] Christ he said now let's get back to
[2:22:23] John he said be careful John you've
[2:22:26] entered into the spirit something's
[2:22:27] going to be revealed to you what is it a
[2:22:30] trumpet sounding the first thing I'm
[2:22:32] Alpha and Omega the first of all
[2:22:35] Revelations brother bam stops and says
[2:22:38] oh sinner bow repent now before the time
[2:22:42] is too
[2:22:44] late in the middle of his sermon
[2:22:48] I think it's good advice for this
[2:22:49] morning if you're here this morning
[2:22:52] don't wait till the end of the service
[2:22:54] bow right now and
[2:22:57] repent it's a late
[2:23:05] hour who is this that's approaching this
[2:23:08] is King Jesus this is King God this is
[2:23:12] King Holy Ghost he said I'm all of it
[2:23:15] from A to Z I'm the beginning and the
[2:23:17] ending I'm the alpha and the Omega I am
[2:23:19] the immortal Eternal
[2:23:23] one still brother brandom he says all
[2:23:26] right the first of all Revelations is
[2:23:29] the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ you
[2:23:31] must know who he is when you hear that
[2:23:34] voice and it's that same voice that
[2:23:37] sounded on Mount Sinai the same voice
[2:23:41] that sounded on Mount
[2:23:43] Transfiguration the same one like un to
[2:23:46] the son of man
[2:23:49] he said repent
[2:23:52] now before it's too
[2:23:55] late brother random said I have come not
[2:23:58] to tell you that he is coming but I have
[2:24:01] come to tell you that he is
[2:24:06] here now church he is here this morning
[2:24:09] he's here in this congregation but he's
[2:24:12] here in this age he's here in this
[2:24:15] bright age the last of of all ages it's
[2:24:18] what brother brandham talked about it's
[2:24:20] not an eighth age but it's that age
[2:24:22] within an
[2:24:24] age and you and I are privileged to
[2:24:27] believe and to be living in that age
[2:24:30] within an
[2:24:37] age you know there was a big deal one
[2:24:40] time made about uh made about what
[2:24:42] brother brandom said it'll all be over
[2:24:44] 19 he said I predict it'll be all over
[2:24:46] by
[2:24:49] 1977 and you know we've looked at that
[2:24:52] and as preachers we've studied that and
[2:24:55] we've debated that and talked about that
[2:24:57] and discussed
[2:25:00] that but a few years ago I got a little
[2:25:04] bit different revelation of it now he
[2:25:07] said I predict it'll all be
[2:25:10] over he didn't say exactly what would be
[2:25:15] over but I went out to
[2:25:18] brother George's place out in Tucson
[2:25:19] there the the den where they where they
[2:25:21] have brother randoms
[2:25:25] den and they had one of brother bbes
[2:25:28] brother Brandon's Bibles laying on a
[2:25:29] table there and in the fly leaf of his
[2:25:32] Bible you'll find this
[2:25:35] interesting in the fly leaf of his Bible
[2:25:38] he had written Le Odyssey in church age
[2:25:42] 1906 to
[2:25:45] 1977 so when he said it'll all be I
[2:25:47] predict it'll all be over what was he
[2:25:48] talking about could he have been talking
[2:25:50] about the leay oysan church
[2:25:52] age church I don't know about you now we
[2:25:56] know that the world is still in the
[2:25:59] leodys and church age but I believe
[2:26:01] there's a group of people they are no
[2:26:03] longer in Le oia they are in the bride
[2:26:06] age I believe that the bride age had to
[2:26:10] start somewhere around
[2:26:13] 1977 I'm not making it a Doctrine I'm
[2:26:16] just saying it could
[2:26:18] be yes amen but we know yes the prophet
[2:26:22] of God didn't make any
[2:26:25] mistakes if he said it something he he
[2:26:29] had to mean something by
[2:26:39] it church and my time is drawing short
[2:26:43] but
[2:26:43] church we just be praising God
[2:26:47] he is worthy to be praised and I said as
[2:26:50] I said at this I'm not look I'm not
[2:26:52] promoting a bunch of worked up emotion
[2:26:54] or pumped up and I don't even believe in
[2:26:57] that I don't believe in that at all I'm
[2:27:00] just talking about you as an individual
[2:27:04] praising
[2:27:06] God and everybody has a different
[2:27:08] personality and everybody can praise God
[2:27:11] differently everybody don't act crazy
[2:27:14] like I
[2:27:15] do
[2:27:18] and I can I know people I know sisters
[2:27:22] little sisters little humble sisters in
[2:27:24] the church and they'll stand and they'll
[2:27:27] praise God and they'll never make a
[2:27:30] sound they'll have tears running down
[2:27:32] their eyes some brother will be standing
[2:27:35] there he won't say a word he'll just
[2:27:38] have his hands up in the air crying
[2:27:41] weeping that's his praising God don't
[2:27:44] mistake this this morning amen
[2:27:47] I'm not after a bunch of noise I I'm not
[2:27:49] promoting a bunch of uh emotion no now
[2:27:53] the way I delivered is the way I have to
[2:27:54] deliver because I'm very emotional
[2:27:56] that's right but some of these brothers
[2:27:59] they're not that emot they can deliver
[2:28:00] the same thing that's right and never
[2:28:02] have all this drama that I have amen but
[2:28:05] this is me this is how I choose to
[2:28:09] praise God if I'm in a church service
[2:28:12] and I get happy I'm gonna shout if I'm
[2:28:15] in a church service and they sing a song
[2:28:18] that strikes my heart I'm gonna
[2:28:19] [Music]
[2:28:20] [Applause]
[2:28:23] dance and if I feel like running in
[2:28:25] church I'm going to
[2:28:27] run but everybody's not like me thank
[2:28:31] God they're not we'd have chaos in our
[2:28:37] churches and when you're doing it to be
[2:28:40] a part of a collective group because you
[2:28:43] want to be one of the group you're wrong
[2:28:46] you're just as wrong as you're going to
[2:28:48] be but if you're doing it because the
[2:28:51] spirit of God has moved on your
[2:28:55] heart then I say go ahead and do
[2:29:14] it I think sometimes s when we come to
[2:29:18] church we ought to
[2:29:21] hand hand all of our mules over to the
[2:29:25] deacons at the front
[2:29:28] door let them hold them so we can be
[2:29:31] free to praise
[2:29:32] [Music]
[2:29:41] God better yet just tie your mules up on
[2:29:45] the outside
[2:29:47] so the deacons can praise God
[2:30:01] too now in St John the 2 chapter the 1st
[2:30:04] through 11
[2:30:05] verses we know that Jesus's real
[2:30:09] Ministry started with its first miracle
[2:30:13] in turning the water into the
[2:30:15] wine
[2:30:17] now he said I am the Alpha and Omega the
[2:30:19] beginning and the end see we all
[2:30:23] know this
[2:30:25] message this
[2:30:29] message this message it's just the
[2:30:33] continuation of this
[2:30:35] message it's not a different
[2:30:40] message the same Ministry that saw the
[2:30:43] alpha portion of it and the Lord Jesus
[2:30:46] is day is the same Ministry with the
[2:30:49] Omega part of it today is that right the
[2:30:52] son of man ministry that's started with
[2:30:55] a wedding in canaa in that day ends with
[2:30:59] a wedding in this day it's the marriage
[2:31:02] of the bridegroom and the
[2:31:05] bride and church contrary to what you
[2:31:07] may have been taught the marriage
[2:31:09] happens on this side of the Rapture
[2:31:11] that's right right right it starts with
[2:31:14] you receiving the Holy Ghost
[2:31:17] it starts with you receiving the new
[2:31:18] birth and what is the New Birth the
[2:31:21] prophet said the new birth is receiving
[2:31:23] the revealed word for your day that's
[2:31:26] the new
[2:31:32] birth and it finishes at the wedding
[2:31:36] supper of the
[2:31:37] Lamb on the other side of the Rapture
[2:31:40] the same God that turned the water into
[2:31:43] wine in canaa in that day today is the
[2:31:47] same God who turns the water of the
[2:31:50] written word into the wine of re
[2:31:53] Revelation today are you with me this
[2:31:58] morning so are you drinking the wine
[2:32:01] this
[2:32:03] morning amen praise the Lord keep
[2:32:06] drinking my sister keep drinking my
[2:32:09] brother for the Rapture is just a
[2:32:12] revelation let's all get so drunk on the
[2:32:16] revelation of the word that it'll be
[2:32:19] revealed to us that we are at the
[2:32:23] wedding
[2:32:24] Feast let's just keep praising
[2:32:38] God the message to home would we
[2:32:41] go brother random
[2:32:44] said I believe that that good old time
[2:32:47] heartfelt salvation brings tears of joy
[2:32:49] and happiness and peace that passes all
[2:32:52] understanding he says I just can't
[2:32:54] praise him enough and say enough about
[2:32:56] him and what he means to me it's a
[2:32:58] nature in you when you are born of the
[2:33:01] spirit of God you've got a nature to
[2:33:03] make you scream out like that old
[2:33:11] rooster see the
[2:33:15] picture message same message brother
[2:33:17] brandom says now listen this is what he
[2:33:20] says you can look it
[2:33:23] up he said Jesus was riding into town
[2:33:27] one time on a mule that's right now the
[2:33:31] Bible says he was riding into town on an
[2:33:35] ass but brother brandom said he was
[2:33:38] riding into town one time on a
[2:33:40] mule the people were all hollering and
[2:33:43] shouting making
[2:33:45] noise and said there were some old
[2:33:47] Pharisees that were walking with Jesus
[2:33:49] and one of them turned toward Jesus and
[2:33:51] said these people shouting and yelling
[2:33:55] like that said that's terrible so that
[2:33:59] makes cold chills run up and down my
[2:34:01] spine he said those are your people why
[2:34:04] don't you make them hold their
[2:34:06] peace this is brother Brandon he said
[2:34:09] the old Pharisees said why don't you
[2:34:11] make him shut up he said Jesus turned to
[2:34:13] that old Pharisee and said if the hold
[2:34:16] their
[2:34:17] peace my God God the Rocks would
[2:34:20] immediately cry
[2:34:24] out what were those people doing they
[2:34:27] were praising God and watering their
[2:34:30] seed I believe there are some rocks here
[2:34:32] today I believe you've come into the
[2:34:35] message I believe that you have walked
[2:34:37] in these doors and you have stayed
[2:34:39] because someone that was sitting here
[2:34:42] previously they did not praise God they
[2:34:45] did not shout
[2:34:47] out they did not water their seed and
[2:34:51] their seed withered and
[2:34:54] died hallu let the musicians come back
[2:34:58] I've held you long
[2:35:15] enough
[2:35:16] the message to whom would we go brother
[2:35:18] brandom said an old colored sister here
[2:35:20] not long ago was giv a testimony and
[2:35:22] many of you have heard it and they'd
[2:35:24] been making fun of her and they would
[2:35:26] say oh you ain't nothing she said you
[2:35:29] know she said that might be true but
[2:35:33] there's one thing I want to say said I
[2:35:36] ain't what I ought to be and I hate what
[2:35:40] I want to be but there's one thing I
[2:35:42] know that I hate what I used to be and
[2:35:46] brother B said I think that's a good
[2:35:48] thing when we get to the point where we
[2:35:50] can see where we hate what we used to
[2:35:54] be that's where each and every one of us
[2:35:57] ought to
[2:35:59] be what was that old sister doing she
[2:36:02] was standing up to give praise for what
[2:36:05] God had done for her why don't we all
[2:36:08] stand up this morning why don't we give
[2:36:11] God praise in your own way saying if
[2:36:14] there is a fountain filled with blood
[2:36:16] drawn from emanuel's
[2:36:19] veins just for a couple minutes in your
[2:36:23] own way you don't have to say a word you
[2:36:26] don't have to shout you don't have to
[2:36:28] run you don't have to dance but if you
[2:36:31] want to you can but just praise God in

[2:38:48] H
[2:38:52] [Music]
[2:39:11] H one more little
[2:39:14] quote
[2:39:17] I want you to
[2:39:19] listen brother brandom said now listen I
[2:39:22] want you young people to listen to this
[2:39:25] when I was a little
[2:39:26] boy we didn't have many
[2:39:29] clothes and we used to dare each other
[2:39:33] who would be the last one to jump in the
[2:39:35] hole of water in the Old Pond we'd all
[2:39:38] run back out to the old swimming hole
[2:39:40] and he said I can tell you something he
[2:39:42] said I'll tell you one thing he said I
[2:39:45] was I was always the first one in the
[2:39:47] old water
[2:39:49] hole because I had the least clothes to
[2:39:52] take off he said all I own was a pair of
[2:39:55] overalls and it had an old fod string
[2:39:58] with a nail in it to hold it up he said
[2:40:01] that's all I had he said yes sir he said
[2:40:04] I'd run we'd all be running each of them
[2:40:07] had to take off their shoes and their
[2:40:10] socks and their shirts and their
[2:40:14] undershirts but he said I didn't have
[2:40:17] those things I didn't have to fool with
[2:40:19] those things he said I would just run as
[2:40:21] hard as I could and then I'd pull the
[2:40:23] nail in that old string and those old
[2:40:26] overalls would drop off and he said I
[2:40:28] jump in the old swimming pool he said I
[2:40:31] always beat my friends I was always the
[2:40:34] first one in and he said it got to the
[2:40:36] point where they would all depend on me
[2:40:40] to find out how the water
[2:40:42] was I think we're still dependent on him
[2:40:46] to find out how the water is don't you
[2:40:48] think so this
[2:40:49] [Applause]
[2:40:53] morning he said I jump in that
[2:40:58] water and he
[2:41:02] [Music]
[2:41:04] said he said if I held up one
[2:41:08] finger that meant it was
[2:41:11] cold don't come in yet boys take your
[2:41:15] time
[2:41:17] but he said if I held up two
[2:41:21] fingers that meant that the water was
[2:41:25] fine come on in boys and he said then
[2:41:29] the clothes would start flying off them
[2:41:31] boys and he said they would be jumping
[2:41:33] in the old swimming hole from
[2:41:35] everywhere and I want to tell you young
[2:41:37] people here
[2:41:39] today if you are
[2:41:41] here and you've never received the new
[2:41:44] birth if you've never received the
[2:41:46] baptism of the Holy
[2:41:48] Ghost I'm holding up two
[2:41:59] fingers the water of the word is fine
[2:42:02] this
[2:42:04] morning come on
[2:42:06] in I invite you to jump in the old
[2:42:09] swimming hole this
[2:42:11] morning the old swimming hole of the
[2:42:14] Holy Ghost
[2:42:16] it won't hurt you it'll do you good
[2:42:20] it'll give you strength it'll give you
[2:42:22] power and that Holy Ghost is like your
[2:42:25] own personal radar and when you get
[2:42:27] offline a little bit in your life it'll
[2:42:30] pull you back on
[2:42:31] [Music]
[2:42:34] track two
[2:42:38] fingers now you don't have to come to
[2:42:40] this altar you can do it in your heart
[2:42:41] right where you
[2:42:43] stand but if you have a some some sort
[2:42:45] of a little seed of the word of God down
[2:42:47] inside
[2:42:49] you water that seed with your
[2:42:54] praise and watch how God will work in
[2:42:56] your
[2:42:57] life watch how fast that seed can grow
[2:43:01] maybe many of you
[2:43:03] here many of you young people here
[2:43:06] you've been to youth's camps you've been
[2:43:08] to youth Banquets you've been to youth
[2:43:10] meetings you've been to youth pizza
[2:43:13] parties and somewhere along the line
[2:43:16] you've got a little bit of a seed down
[2:43:18] inside you and all you need to do is to
[2:43:21] make that seed grow I'm telling you
[2:43:23] young people if you learn to praise God
[2:43:27] that seed will
[2:43:28] grow you know I grew up and we're going
[2:43:32] to we're going to take the next session
[2:43:34] maybe and talk about a few of the
[2:43:35] testimonies I knew or experienced
[2:43:38] growing up in the random Tabernacle but
[2:43:40] you know even though I grew up there it
[2:43:42] was a few years later when I really met
[2:43:45] the
[2:43:46] Lord and I can remember when the Lord
[2:43:50] started dealing with my heart brother
[2:43:51] random was done gone he was done off the
[2:43:54] scene and I'd go to a message
[2:43:58] church and I'd sit
[2:44:00] there and they'd be singing be praying
[2:44:04] they'd be
[2:44:06] shouting and I was pretty
[2:44:08] quiet but I'd go back a few more
[2:44:11] services and I'd go back a few more
[2:44:13] services and I noticed one day
[2:44:16] [Music]
[2:44:17] oh I've been studying the message I've
[2:44:19] been reading the books of the things
[2:44:21] that I had seen when I was
[2:44:23] there and I'd read something in those
[2:44:26] books or listen to those tapes and I'd
[2:44:27] go to church and the preacher would say
[2:44:29] the same thing and I found
[2:44:32] myself praise God real quiet you know
[2:44:35] real quiet praise God you know and after
[2:44:38] a few more services I found
[2:44:42] myself praise God and after a few more
[2:44:47] services Hallelujah and after a few more
[2:44:50] services I'd stand up and say
[2:44:52] hallelujah Church in no time at all my
[2:44:55] seed began to
[2:44:57] grow and now as they say down in South
[2:45:01] America where I preached a lot Kenny
[2:45:04] Caps or Mano Kenny he's local for
[2:45:07] kristo crazy for
[2:45:09] Christ but I'm just telling you young
[2:45:12] people you've got a seed down inside you
[2:45:16] listen God put you in the home and God
[2:45:20] put you in the family that you was
[2:45:21] ordained to grow up in don't take it
[2:45:25] lightly he put you in that family for a
[2:45:28] reason and that reason is because you're
[2:45:30] an elected seat of God
[2:45:34] Amen and you can come hard or you can
[2:45:37] come easy God has never lost a one I
[2:45:42] encourage you young people in your own
[2:45:44] way when you go back to your churches
[2:45:47] find a way to praise God don't just sit
[2:45:50] there find a way to praise
[2:45:53] God if it's nothing else just raise your
[2:45:57] hand God will use that if it's nothing
[2:46:01] else just shake the hand of the pastor
[2:46:03] as you go out God will use that whatever
[2:46:08] you feel to do and whatever God puts on
