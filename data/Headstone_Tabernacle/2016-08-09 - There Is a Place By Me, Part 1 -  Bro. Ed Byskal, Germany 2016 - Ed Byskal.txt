a very rural area a lot of Countryside and there's a lot of uh of the pl people that came from Germany the menites and the Amish and so forth and uh it's it's a very uh very Christian area where I live there's over 600 different types of churches and a lot of uh Christians of varying uh types and uh there was this fellow his barn burned down and one afternoon and Into the Night night and I was uh up the road at this company uh I had to pick up some supplies and the shipping guy was telling me how this F's Barn burned down and I could still see smoke so when I left there I drove past where the barn had burned and what I saw absolutely blew my mind there were probably a hundred different men there of all different types different types of Amish and different menites and different Christians like Baptists and so forth they were all came together there were horses and Buggies there there were trucks and cars uh some people came on bicycles and on foot and they all came to help their friend their brother they didn't care what church he went to that didn't matter their friend was in need and they all pitched in and then the old the sisters up there I seen them with their little bonnets they laid out tables and they had food and and drink this is 9:00 in the morning and hundreds of people came to help their friend out I sat in the car and wept I said when is the Bride of Jesus Christ going to be like that when oh God when will we forget about what church we go to and love our brother the way we're supposed to amen give me a heart that's filled with love amen that kind of love right friends don't you love one another in here isn't it a good thing that's the kind of love that we want to have the kind that doesn't compare notes but the kind that sees Jesus Christ in your brother even if he doesn't agree with you you still love him and you and you want to help any way you can at least that's the way the prophet was right that's the way brother Brandon was I want to be like that amen praise the Lord let's sing uh you know the song In the Name of Jesus in the name of Jesus we have the victory you got the victory oh in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus demons will have to flee oh when we come in the name of Jesus tell me who can stand before in the precious name of Jesus we have the GL of Jesus in the name of Jesus we have the RCT [Music] in the

Victory forever and ever and ever and ever achieved at Calvary thank you Lord Jesus you may be seated we only have had one day and we have six days isn't that wonderful isn't that wonderful just this one day yesterday and this morning was such a fullness and we have so many more [Music] coming I hope you understand why I put the services together like this and also have in the afternoon service which is sure takes a lot of strength from all of us uh to be together so long but I wanted to put as much as possible in it when we have these precious ministers here with us you agree takes a takes a burden to come and listen to believe praise the Lord before I like to invite brother piscal to the platform I want to just thank the brother said when went before and spoke yesterday brother bisc and how praise the Lord and how he showed us s Supernatural element where we all speaking where we are listening to how he showed us how this was working in brother Bram and uh and he was a wave sheath there was more to come like him that's a promise for you and for me how he showed us and how how we are happy that we have have an eyewitness with with us that could read this letter a living epistle Among Us Jesus Christ Living in a human being adopted full with his nature still a man do like passion as we Elijah still a man many people are don't understand this but anyhow God's characteristic full and folded and how we appreciate that to hear this and know that the same kind of life is promised to us I believe this for myself that s's promised for me if he can enlarge our our little face and add these characteristics that he Liv before us how we thank him to give testimony we we would like to give him more time this afternoon and also on Friday evening to come again because it's so rich that we can listen listen to this and enjoy this you agree God bless you and then brother Tim puid yesterday afternoon how's Supernatural element is still working is still working in human beings how he prophesied under the impact of this Supernatural element about the healing of his wife he just opened his mouth it just came out flew out of him because he was in that channel and this channel is not something we have to work up this channel is very simple very simple sister had you right she didn't have to work up anything it was very simple she she just agreed if you just agree Jesus you have healed me holy spirit will do the work always will do the work and how he prophet prophesied under this impact and how by prayer this Supernatural element this God this wheel in the middle of the wheel how it made a becklen son run in his pajama in his car drove to the church and gave his life back to God what what prayer what prayer to assist God what prayer does that's why I invite especially the ministers in the morning from 8 to 9: : CL in this prayer room let us pray for our young people God hears prayer if he makes one man run because it this prayer was spoken how he will deliver the our our children I feel it's important there's no Revival without prayer and Brother Chan con made it clear said if the word doesn't Unite with the spirit in our lives there's no power no dynamic in our life to live the life of Jesus Christ how we need this holy fire to burn our personal demons out he made it clear it's not enough to know the message we need the same fire and only God can give it to us and it comes sometimes in a way we don't expect second day this morning brother Isaac overit one taken one left we have to know this was new for me I mean I understand astronauts have to be there have to be trained but to hear it so clear we have to have to practice the same condition here on Earth before before we have it up there we have to be in the same condition that means you just obey the word whatever the word says if the word says you love your enemy you just love him because you love Jesus and you love to do what he says you don't think even about it you just love him and God likes it because it's the way he how he shows his children we Al so we are very thankful for this morning message also to brother Isaac brother Isaac God bless you where are you at where is he okay whever is God May bless his ministry that was direct to my heart also we have to practice it's not said we have to work up but you have to do what the voice says what the word says because you love him you can only do it if you love Jesus yourself you cannot you cannot achieve it but if you love him you will just do what he says if he says this do this do this you don't think yourself you just committed you just surrendered this is this is this is all just surrender to him and then he comes and do the work so we have found that pearl of great price that lost coin who is this that's he himself it's he himself he said I am I will be in you it's him personally how do I know who is he he is experienced by his Nature by his attributes you can experience him if you follow his word these attributes will unfold in your life and will you take over it's very easy but by love it comes by love so in this afternoon i' I'm finish with my my comments it's him and so when brother bcll comes we are very excited brother Bisal to hear you again very excited and uh it's a great privilege said God had spoken to his heart said he should go and come to us here where we come from different Corners it's it's he obeyed he obeyed his voice and we just do the same I didn't know who how many will come how many will hear the call and follow I thought maybe 200 maybe 1,200 I don't know I didn't even know the musicians I just wrote The Musicians are invited to bring their instruments here they are in what a Harmony it's God doing God is doing this I'm so thankful for my Lord I Want To Praise Him and I want to thank him from all my heart this fire in my heart to thank him for that what he has done brother sister I tell you you sometimes we beg our Lord we beg him for this we beg him for this and when when he has done it we should send with this same fire and with with with the same this San heart thank him from all our heart Hallelujah then we would make an experience and believe him more for the next time hallelujah praise the Lord so we want to give him enough time that he can let the Living Waters Flow from his body and from his heart and uh when he remembers give him time to remember back the times when he was together with a prophet that God has sent at the end of this Gentile dispensation to prepare a bride to prepare you and to prepare me and uh uh it means a lot for us he did not only preach the message brother Brenham but he lifts a message he was a living example and I appreciate so much to to see to not hear hear only words but to but to see a life everybody of us likes to see a life everybody likes you to see you living that that speaks loud that speaks real you living it before your children you're living it before your husband you're living it before your wife that has allow that has lowed we we know this I don't want to go into it my heart is open with a longing to partake of this Glory that could be seen and felt in this adopted son example seed son W sheef as a sign said more are coming God bless you brother bcll our hearts are open amen God bless you I'm going to just take a few moments to make a few comments so you can have your seats once again if you don't mind thank you I appreciate being able to uh meet you and be gathered with you uh in this convention and to meet some new friends and to meet some old friends this this morning uh we were quite early having a a bite of breakfast and uh uh a brother came in just as we were finishing and getting ready to leave and he uh shook my hand and and so I shook his hand he said you don't remember me I said well no I don't remember you he said you baptized me 25 years ago and uh he said you up in mosty in bellarus yes yes and it was brother senior pich's grandson and uh related to brother pich right here and his wife God bless you Pastor in uh Ria lva I believe it is uh I remember when your father brother pich asked me he said will will you baptize my grandson and uh I said no I don't baptize anybody in special meetings he said please it's just my grandson so so that's how that happened and here we meet all of these years later uh and I'm so thankful for that and we have an opportunity if it wasn't for this Gathering we wouldn't have a opportunity to meet meet again like that and that was that was wonderful I appreciate that um I wanted to not only thank our brother colen buer but I want to thank others that I have uh seen been associated with uh brother fruis lipar from Switzerland I'm thankful for him our our brother gar rald from bezel uh we're thankful for his life there are some that have come with me and uh brother colen Brunner has request had requested that brother Murphy Wong from our church come uh he is he is translating in Chinese so that some people Chinese speaking people will be able to benefit from the meetings here as well uh I'm very very honored and privileged to be also with our brother uh Timothy puit who ministered and and besides our brother Timothy Wong is brother Timothy Dodd that's two Timothy and and and then there's one more uh one of my dear brothers who flew up from Johannesburg brother brother Timothy onor Toco I wonder brother Timothy are you here could you stand please at the back God bless you brother Timothy I mention these uh these IND individuals because uh each one of them have contributed to my life uh some are younger and some are about my age but I've learned some things and our brother Timothy onoko he perhaps doesn't realize but I've observed their lives I had opportunity to observe their lives uh brother Murphy Wong uh he was doing trans ating of the Chinese during a live messages while service was going on in our church in Cloverdale and I would come out after a preaching you'd feel such an unction such an anointing and such a I don't know such a presence of God and I would come in to my little study and that's where we had the computer set up at that time we didn't have another room for brother Murphy to be translating to the Chinese and I would I would see him on his knees and I would see his car in the parking lot when I left and I would see his car when I came back in the morning this not this didn't happen once but this happened several times and I said brother Murphy did you go home last night uh and he just put his head down no no no I I I was very affected by the message sometimes hearing uh the prophet of God or a local Ministry uh I like to see people I learn something from that I say that is uh that means a great deal to me not because uh I had participated in in the meeting but because I see a tenderness towards the spirit of God and uh brother Coen Bruner has asked if I would give some testimony and witness uh perhaps more on Friday Friday evening I would like to speak today if I may um but you learn something as you you pick up things as you journey and God allows certain people to meet your life I want you to listen very very carefully today if you wouldn't mind because we are we are all journeying towards our anticipated destination of a rapture we speak much about the Rapture uh we anticipate the Rapture this is why we're here this is why we this is why we live this is why we uh seek the message this desire to live the message I would like to have you note that in the scriptures Jesus sometimes would speak to the multitudes there were other times when he purposely would take the 12 and the Bible says the 12 and then there are other times and we cannot question why but there were other times he would take three Peter James and John and they were times when perhaps he had something that he was especially wishing to convey it was Peter James and John that went up on Mount Transfiguration the multitude didn't go up the 70 were not invited but the three were invited and Peter speaks of that again how they uh heard and saw in the Holy Mount and that is where also the prophet of God all of these Generations later would get uh the the text for his message hear ye him because that was what the voice said hear ye him but there was not multitudes there not that we are opposed to multitudes we're very happy but sometimes and I'm saying these words with a purpose sometimes God will select someone within the within the multitude and speak to them in a special way and I would ask you to prepare your heart uh and and uh just say God I've come here to hear from you cause cause a man of God cause a minister cause someone to say something that is certain words that I personally need to hear I want to hear your voice I want to hear you you speak and I I believe that that is very important just to be perfectly honest with you uh in in a testimony of things that times that I was with brother brandham I cannot speak of them lightly I cannot speak of them flippantly I cannot just speak of them as something I read in a book is is sometimes the things that you experienced and they are so sacred so sacred not because I make them sacred but we speak about the pillar of fire and I had an occasion to be in the car with the prophet of God on one occasion and I just want to tell you that it takes a special atmosphere in a service for me to even speak about it because it it was just that Holy that sacred and uh I would ask you to be in prayer if you are in prayer and that God may allow that how many here have seen the film deep calls to the Deep may I see your hands you know there are things that are I'm I'm an obser OB ver and I just observe things observe people I've I observed brother brandham we didn't I did not know he was who he was at the first indication at the first time but it didn't take long and he took me to Malachi 4 and uh spoke about the great and terrible day of the Lord but if you see the film what you have the woman is standing on this side and she you'll notice the next time if you have not noticed it you can notice it the next time she reaches out and puts her hand on the corner of the pull pit to steady herself and he is standing here and he said that's all right that won't hurt you that's him not me and friends I can tell you that presence that presence is so sacred and so holy if you were to stand in it you might wonder if you're even going to live that's the kind of presence it is it is just so sacred and so holy I can't that is why the prophet said uh every time he comes he hears those same words he knows the voice fear not fear not that's why those things just think that the Eternal God is saying to a human fear not because these are very precious times and if if we are now in this Gathering such as we are and he comes to you personally you will thank him throughout Eternity for that moment that the that a that a atmosphere was created where God and man could meet together God and a daughter of God can meet together my brother my sister and you young people that are here let me tell you as one that is your senior and your Elder elder brother I will tell you it is the most gracious and the most wonderful gift that God can give to a person I was about 27 when I first uh took brother brandham on uh on his rest on a hunt uh we took I'll tell you more about that later but uh I had so many deep questions spiritual questions I saw the decline of uh the Pentecostal movement and believe me the Pentecostal movement I really questioned whether I would say anything about this you talk about praise and you talk about worship I sat in a service and saw perhaps as many people are are here in a large building in Edmonton Alberta and I was sitting towards the back and uh and someone came to the piano and began to just play lost in the spirit they didn't know nothing about the piano and they would play the piano for maybe a half an hour or an hour and the people would rise and and wave and just like the ocean and and sing and sing in the spirit and we knew it was we knew it was Supernatural absolutely Supernatural they weren't even choruses or songs that were were known but they just sang and it sound so Angelic I wasn't just a child I was I was in my teens at that time I was a teenager if you're a teenager was here I didn't come to church to hear somebody preach we came to church to see what go God was going to do because there were always things that were happening things that were being things that were taking place and that's why we came to church and in this one meeting I will never forget it you might think I'm exaggerating it is absolutely the truth on this side I was sitting on this side and about on this side it was a narrower building than this but a long long building and about half of that audience stood up on this side and they cried out in one voice in One Voice open up ye gates and let the king of glory come in and they sat down in this side rose up and said in one voice who is this king of glory and the other side rose up and said the Lord of hosts he is the king of glory don't tell me it wasn't God don't tell me that that wasn't God that's the only only way that could happen that wasn't orchestrated no one uh no one anticipated it happening and on on my arm the ha hair just stood up on my arm you might be saying how dides that happen I don't know how it happened I was there and that's exactly what happened but I want to tell you friends I don't know any in that in that audience that took the word when it came so they didn't have a word to Anchor them and we have a lot to Rejoice about because we have received a message but I only tell you this to help you to appreciate what the message cost and the message did not come easy the message came at Great cost and the men whose names I just called I have seen God in their lives I have seen men of sacrifice and you will have opportunity the Lord willing to see uh a Chinese Bible that has been spoken about some have heard about it then some have saw it in in Switzerland we brought uh perhaps 50 or 60 or 70 in Chinese you might say well why would you bring Chinese to this somebody knows someone who is Chinese and I bought one I I bought one and and gave it to one of my Chinese friends and I have another one that I want to give and do you know that China one billion 1 billion 300 million people and more more than that they're increasing that's an incredible amount 1 billion 300 million people and yet they did not have an accurate Bible the reason why I speak about this Bible H it it it uh Believers of this message began to discover errors in the King James version they said the prophet is saying this but it's not in our Bible that isn't what it says and and for a number of years and then it they kept a diary of it and it be began to build up and we said well how can how can we sit by and see this kind of uh uh problem in the Chinese Bible and a brother came into my office one day and said we don't have a King James version of the Bible I thought well you must have I went on the internet and I saw that there were many but there the translations were not only very poor they missed many scriptures and they had many words that were Incorrect and I mentioned brother Murphy Wong from beginning to the finish of the Bible was 18 years and that brother started the brother sitting right in the back started with Genesis 1:1 and went through to the amen of Revelation it took five years five long years and I can tell you friends to have a friend that's dedicated that dedicated I am impressed with that kind of dedication and I say thanks be to God that we of the message are able to provide the Chinese speaking people with an accurate Bible one that the prophet of God would not be ashamed of because it is the same is what he preached from and I say praise be to God thank you for your time there's also another scripture I'd like to leave with you just before we read scripture and that is Jesus we've we hear a great deal about the Holy Ghost but Jesus hear his words after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you you he said one thing you shall be Witnesses unto me is that not what he said ye shall be Witnesses unto me and he said both in Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth period that's the end of his statement some went to Jerusalem some perhaps went to Samaria some went to Judea some went to other places and to the uttermost part of the earth this to me is the gospel that I'm interested in taking this message that we have received you brothers from various places and ministers especially should be gripped with a passion a passion of the Prophet here he flew we didn't have jets in his time and he flew with prop uh propeller driven planes uh and into mosm Beek and into South Africa and up into uh Zimbabwe I guess and different places I don't know all the places way into the far north of Canada and we just learned from our brother George Smith who was here my wife was always wanting to know his first visit there and it was 1949 in September 1949 it wasn't simple it was was N Easy driving it was a very primitive at that time and uh this was the kind and when that Prophet speaks about rugged Believers that's what we want to be praise be to God we're here to preach a rugged gospel Hallelujah and we believe it with all of our hearts amen if you wish to stand with me I'll read some scripture I'd like to read out of just give me a moment here I want to read out of Exodus the 3 chapter we'll begin reading at the second verse and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he said here am I and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is Holy G ground moreover he said I am the god of the thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon god let's bow our heads please dear heavenly father I'm always so conscious and so thankful that I can call you our father and you are are my father and we know as the brother said earlier today that we have come from God and we go back to God oh Father God I thank you for the message that you have sent I thank you for the revealing of Jesus Christ thy beloved Son who you gave and sent as a sacrifice of sin and you have accomplished that Redemptive work and you have shown oh God your purpose of election your purpose of in predestination we thank you oh God for the Gathering of the people that is here today and we pray that your blessing by the holy spirit's attendance will be near us oh God near each one I'm praying for my brothers and sisters individually I pray father that they may experience what their expectation is and I ask father that you will give live and raise an expectation in their hearts and souls one that you shall be pleased with I pray father that they may draw aside during these meetings draw aside as Moses and it said you have said that when you saw that he drew aside you spoke to him I pray that you will speak oh God what needs to be heard by the individual people brothers and sisters and young people alike and even children as we heard from our brother Tim puit at 5 years old giving his life to Christ and never taking it back oh God we thank you that you can speak in such a way even to a young person a young child or you can speak to an elder person and to the parents father there may be parents are struggling with their young people I pray in the name of Jesus you will undo them with not only power but Endo them with discernment and wisdom of the Holy Ghost bless now Thy word I pray in Jesus Christ's name and the words that shall be spoken I pray you'll bring to my remembrance the things that you would have me to utter and may it be confirmed by the Holy Spirit to the hearts of the people in Jesus Christ's name amen and may everyone say amen amen am amen you may be seated I want to take uh some moments to speak to you please on uh there is a place by me Moses and then we will go from Moses uh into the into the message but there is a place by me every one of us you have gathered this is not where you live on this Hillside in this Campground so you came from some place you came from your village your town your country you perhaps flew took an aircraft as we did and others have done so and we moved from one place to another place there was a purpose and a reason for that and now Moses as Moses knew what it was to be in the Palaces of of Egypt and to walk on those Rich carpet grounds he knew what it was as a military hero to ride in a chariot and to to come into the uh the voices of the thousands of people people and he knew what it was to receive honor and Glory of man and now because of uh a very unfortunate thing in his life he murdered a man and you perhaps now you want to be serious you may not care for him as a as your leader but he's the one that God had called and God doesn't change his mind do you understand can you say Amen to that amen and that's that's that's our God that's his nature and and Moses had slain a man and hid him and ended up being a vagabond Prophet out in the wilderness and caring for some flocks or whatever some cattle and while he's there uh a bush is on fire he's attracted to this bush and he goes and he's and hears a voice out of the Bush the prophet of God said what Moses was lacking the the the pillar of fire had the pillar of fire had what he was lacking and I can tell you today whatever we lack or whatever we have need of I can tell you that there that the pillar of fire is has the has the presence of God that you crave for has uh whatever it is you desire or need the pillar of fire has what the body of Christ needs and so he's moved from one place to another but the voice s speaks to him and says remove your shoes or put off your shoes from off your feet for the place whereon thou standest friends that place was not holy Moses didn't take anyone else back there there wasn't anything sacred about that spot but it was sacred at that moment at that time because God was going to meet with a man at that point and now this is a this is a different kind of a place now you have come here to this Auditorium and this place can become a special place uh this place can become a special place uh I don't think there's anything special about the construction of this building but a place becomes very very special when God meets man now I can tell you that I as a young man I'd been a minister for 20 for seven years been preaching for seven years and I saw things within uh within the church world at the time I don't mean denominational world we did not believe in denominations we had a background of uh of the Scandinavian belief and which is uh uh which is one that each church is Sovereign and that's what we believed back then each church was Sovereign and we did not believe in a hierarchy we did not believe in general overseers or Bishops we believed that the church and so it was a it was to me it was the highest quality of of Christianity available and I was a minister uh uh under in within that group of Fellowship of churches we had one little church in the far north of British Columbia in Dawson Creek where my wife who was here was born in that City in that town and uh that's where the Alaskan Highway begins I'm sorry I meant to bring I had a large map and I was going to put it up so you could see if it's a very large map and about 5 foot tall and you could see the area because it's important to see that uh even when the prophet of God um drove all the way up there he drove there all the way from Jeffersonville and it was it was a long long journey and yet he would come up to that place and uh I didn't know who he was except I had been in his meetings and uh I I I had seen a girl which I will tell you about at another occasion I saw a a blind girl healed and I was in about the third row on this side sitting on the aisle and uh and the platform was higher than this one and brother Brandon prayed a prayer I have never heard before but he prayed he prayed for her and uh nothing and he looked at her and nothing changed he prayed the second time and the third time and the fourth time and the fifth time and the sixth time and I was counting I was a 14y years old I was counting and I thought like all the other ministers when it's something that's inside wonderful healings take place but when it's something that I can see with my own eyes nothing's happening and this girl's eyes were just white just white balls was all that could be seen and then uh he just put his arms around her head she was about 10 12 years old ringlets down to her shoulders and he put his arms around her head like this and he just held her like that and he said Satan an angel from God ministered this gift to me and told me that if I could get the people to believe nothing would stand before my prayers not even cancer I adure you in the name of the Living God loose her and let her go and that time he did not look at her he just turned took her by the shoulders and turned her this way and I was looking straight at her her eyes were straight as mine I tell you then the people went into wild ecstasy and began to praise and thank God and the little girl is looking up at the lights because the lights were bright and brother brandom lifted her up and she's looking at the lights and I could even see the tears form in her eyes as as she looked at the light she was not accustomed to it and uh and of course the people were filled with Ecstasy but the thing that happened something lodged in my heart and I thought now I've I've never heard I've never seen a man that spoke to Angels before here's a man that is I've heard now has spoken to Angels here's a man that God hears here's a man that the supernatural happens and and it was just quietly he just prayed a simple prayer and it was done I tell you what friends the power of God was very very present and and that lodged in my heart for years so that was still in my heart when uh when I A A Rancher friend of mine called Bud Southwick whose names now uh you have seen many times in the message but brother brandom didn't know brother Bud Southwick he was a close friend of mine because he was just a Rancher and I would go up to his place and back and forth and he would come and sell some cattle and stay in our home and this one night he was in our home and another another Minister was there who had preached in my church and he he uh he said this brother Southwick was saying brother bud I always call him brother Bud he said uh he said uh the the game department the uh Department that is in charge of harvesting the animals he said they're wanting to give me a large territory up on the Alaskan Highway and I just I didn't even take it serious I thought well butd is just becoming established as a Rancher he's got a maybe 200 head of cattle and horses and he's got five little sons and a wife and certainly he's not going to go up there because he's just starting to get himself established and the next thing I knew he had he got sold his farm I guess it was or sold his Ranch and went way up on the Alaskan Highway and I was I was literally speechless that he would do that and I thought I hope that's not a big mistake but we let this this man this Minister who who whose name is also in brother branham's messages aw rasmason was in my home that night and that was the only time he was in my home and he said you know brother Bisal he said you you should write you should invite brother brandom he said you know he loves to hunt you know and uh I I I I thought well brother Brandon probably receives a 100,000 letters a month he would never find my letter anyway but I recall sitting down at a big old oak desk and I wrote a with a pencil in paper I wrote an invitation to brother brandham to come and we didn't hear anything I didn't get an answer for a year and a half and I didn't expect an answer I just thought this will get lost in all of his mail but instead and during that year and a half I resigned the church where I was and we moved about and I went to the native Indian people of Canada and uh settled my family in a in a small city called Victoria which is our capital of British Columbia and uh uh it was it we were only three weeks there and I got a letter from Billy Paul saying that his father would like to go on a hunt and suggested a certain time in May and uh uh so I I was so surprised and delighted and then brother brandom and I made some communication I can't remember all the communications but I've kept every letter from him and every letter from Billy Paul still have it in a file in my home and just recently I showed it to some of our young men because uh I I kept them because some of the things that the prophet of God just said were very very personal very very precious he wrote me one letter just one week after his mother passed away and I've always held that very very dear I thought that he would take time to write me a letter a personal letter one month one week after his mother had passed away and you can read in the message how he appreciated the people that gathered around him and the people that went to the hospital and stood with his mother and and the brother sthan and different ones and he so appreciated and and the flowers and he talked about it in one of the messages which I didn't pull up just now but he was so appreciative and he he thanked them so much and then to find that he had time to write me a letter I was humbled by that I was very humbled by that and then one letter he he he just said brother Eddie you'll never know what your friendship has meant to me and I was very humbled I didn't even want to show that letter and I I hesitated even mentioning it now I don't want it to be misunderstood but that was uh just one of the things that I felt if if we were able to give him a rest and friends I was like the shunamite woman I wish you'd had the opportunity I didn't expect anything in return but to get his friendship in return means more than even this Gathering here to me just to have that kind of Association that kind of friendship and to be able to observe friends I hope you understand this I I got a window into to Eternity I watched I watched that man I watched him when a wild horse is trying to actually kill brother Southwick and I said to brother brandham he was standing right beside me I said brother brandham I said that that horse is going to injure going to hurt uh brother Southwick and he said yeah he's uh he he's mean isn't he I said yes he is and he this was the second day and brother Sou W who knew horses he was a Horseman and he knew and he thought he would break his break his will this horse would break the will and and he was trying to put a pack saddle on him and it wasn't possible are you interested in this do you want to hear this I turned around and I just saw him slipping his hat on his head he just had a few words with Father our father I hope it's your father and that horse his nature was changed from that moment I'm a man of the Wilderness I'm telling you the truth that animal's nature was changed changed became like a kitten we packed that horse every day that horse treated was treated like every other animal and it was just his nature was what kind of a God have we got we got a God who gives a horse a force nature who gives a dog a dog nature gives an animal an animal nature gives a human a human nature and he knows how to change our nature he knows how to make us Christlike and friends when I hear about us becoming like Christ I realize because I've seen it I've seen this message I've seen this messenger do that and and and animal changed in in an instant of time who can do that nobody but God who created him and I tell you the truth that animal changed completely that very day and became just mild a wonderful wonderful horse for the rest of that Journey which was about 10 days do you believe [Applause] it I'm talking about a living God I'm talking talking about a God I have seen change this isn't just words this is something that takes place I've seen them change humans I've seen them change drunkards I've seen them change my father Hallelujah and I'm ready to give glory to God because we don't serve a dead God we serve a living God hallelujah hallelujah and this message is a living message amen do you believe what I'm saying I've been asked to give a witness and I want to be a true witness of a True Vine for Jesus Christ is the vine and any time it will Sprout another another Branch it'll be a Pentecost listen friends this is nothing different than happened in Pentecost men and women were changed people who couldn't write their names were changed Hallelujah and nothing is nothing is different today it's the same God hallelujah and we've come to a sacred place do you believe it Hallelujah Glory Hall amen I'm just thinking because some things I can say in some things perhaps I cannot say I don't want to be misunderstood I tell you friends these are precious moments and you have come here because you claim to follow a message that God used this vessel and this was a prepared vessel and I spoke on the first service on of uh a body hast thou prepared me my brother my sister I had much more to say because we are the body of Jesus Christ and we will not reach a Rapture without the full preparation we don't have to prepare ourselves so much even though the bride has prepared herself but but God has designed things for us and fact is want you to hear me now very clear and especially you that are young people and I see young men and young women in this message in this message it's more than just a phrase we're not in the message so much as we need to have the message in us hallelujah the word of God abiding in US Amen in Jesus prayer in John 17 he speaks of his disciples and those that have believed on him and he said thine they where and thou gavest me them think of that that was something they didn't even know that is something that we might know mentally but we know in our in our very being that we belong to Christ and God has given us to this message before the foundation of the world he gave us to this message you might have said you accepted it he accepted you he called you he sent a word that would fit you and to bring you from where you were he wanted you in another [Applause] place Jesus walked where they were fishing and there were there were men who had been born into families there was John and Andrew and Peter and James and these men that were fishermen and they were with two of them were with their father and that's the place they were whether it was a dock at the lake I don't know I've been to the I've been to that place uh near that place in uh in uh Israel and that's where they were but somehow now here came the master here came the Creator here came the Masterpiece Hallelujah and he needs him in another place not where they're fishermen but he needs him in another place he knows what he's going to do he knows the words that he's going to speak and he's got to have some Faithful Men Who will be true Witnesses of the Lord Jesus Christ at that time and listen to me my friends I'm I'm thankful that I have the energy and the time and the health that God has given to allow me to be one more time here and what I give you today or what I speak in the Services is a true witness of the True Vine for Jesus Christ is the vine and he's the one he's the one who changes the nature of a horse he's the one who saw what was in my heart and I thought oh God how can we be in such a church how can we have such a message as we have not the message of the hour but we had a message as well and we were spreading the gospel and we were preaching we had I know what it is to come behind a Pulpit and the Holy Spirit come down and to I've collapsed over the pulpit and wept till the end of the service I know what it is to experience those things we've seen those things and we've seen lives changed and but that wasn't when the word came neither of my deacons took it my two deacons didn't take it I couldn't hardly believe it they were like brothers in the flesh and that's where we learned what separation was sometimes very dear people family I had one sister and then a a a half sister my father remarried after my mother died as I said the other night I was six and a half years old stood at her coffin I'm not telling you this to have a tear service I'm telling this because it's the truth those were not easy days and that was not a a self-imposed sacrifice I'm going to stay with this till you understand it Jesus had a great life of sacrifice and he called men and also women attended to his needs but he called men that were prepared to sacrifice and when I read the scripture after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you after that the Holy Ghost come he says one thing you shall be Witnesses in Jerusalem in Samaria in Judea and into the uttermost part of the earth it's not just living a life some of you young people may be going to further education I'm going to unload my burden now is that all right brother Coen Bruner I'm going to unload my burden it it is not the holy spirit will come upon you to make you a a better professional person or to give you a better job or to give you a higher a higher education or to give you better skills that's not the point the Holy Ghost comes upon us to make us Witnesses Liv living Witnesses whatever form that takes in your life but it will call for some sacrifice and I can tell you it calls for sacrifice listen to me back there it calls for sacrifice and some are self-imposed people have said no I will I'll turn aside from that and I'm going to give my life this way now comes an opportunity do you know what friends you're looking for a Rapture and as long as there's one yet to left to get one left as long as there's one Soul left how do we know who's going to reach them I don't know who's going to reach them what country are they in I don't know our brother Tim Dodd will say something and we maybe show some pictures of you just reached this message message just reached into Ethiopia and I am so thankful I can say to you Brethren that are of African descent how thankful we are I I look upon it as a great honor that God has given us a great honor to take the message into a country of 90 million that have never been exposed to the message and here we are end time Believers in the end time talking about the Rapture and and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 become baptized and then our brother bus goes back to Uganda because they only allow him to stay in the country 30 days and he's going back to the country of his origin into Uganda and he's leaving in the people gather around him one was a prostitute and others had very ious religions you know what they said to this brother are you leaving us now are you going to leave us listen I'm not talking about history I'm not talking about history I'm talking about today today while we sit here this group is meeting up in Ethiopia in Addis Ababa they're meeting there and they're meeting in another city about 50 miles away we've never encountered some of these things never encountered it they speak another language 50 miles 50 mil about 60 70 kilometers away they don't even speak the language of the nation they speak their own language I ask you I'm 81 years old I'm saying to you do we have a responsibility I say yes yes we have a responsibility I don't know how I don't know when but somehow we'll get this message into their hands so they can read the things that I read they can feel the same spirit that I feel Hallelujah can you not say Amen to that glory to God this is the gospel I believe this is the kind of Holy Spirit I after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you you shall be Witnesses unto me perhaps in your country maybe in the neighboring country but it might be Ethiopia it might be some other place I do not know but all I can tell you and I don't need to tell you I'm filled with a passion furthermore I'm not ashamed to say I'm filled with the Holy Ghost because the spirit of God within me says You must go you must take it you must show them the life of this word hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Amen what do I hear from this side praise God what do I hear from this side praise God what do I hear from this middle section praise God what do I hear from this side praise God then we are of one mind we are in unity this must take place place this is a holy spot we've come to a sacred Place amen glory to God praise God when I see young men robust strong oh God thank you brother oh God continue to give me my youth Jes I have eternal life but I put it into this body and let it continue to be a testimony of Jesus Christ people talk about my age I I don't only feel about maybe 50 years old and and and what sacrifice what sacrifice there is no sacrifice everything's an honor everything's a privilege you people whether you're from Germany whether you're from Africa whether you're from another place I desire that you'll be there a different person burning inside like Jeremiah tried to keep it silent because it was going to make enemies for him it was going to make division for him it was going to cause people to leave him and he tried to close up his mouth but he said it burned in his bones that's the God we serve Hallelujah that's the god of reality the god of Elijah the god of elishah the god of Jeremiah the god of the prophets that's our God he's the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob and the first thing he says to Abraham he says leave thy Kindred leave thy country leave thy I'm not asking you to leave it I'm just saying we must be willing to do whatever it takes we have one we have one call in this age we have one call as Believers of the message and that is to get the message to every hungry person education must not get in the way our profession must not get in the way use it as a tool to further the gospel but whatever you do that's the life I believe I believe it with all my soul my wife and my daughter are sitting there sitting right behind our brother and my eldest daughter and they they know what it is to be without Daddy because father has been away we've been in South Africa we had radio and swazi music radio and the people there said here's a little tape of brother brandham a little 8 mm cassette and they showed me and brother brandham he's arriving at Johannesburg and they've got his passport stamped that he cannot preach in the nation and I hear him on this little 8 mm he's saying oh how I'd love to start preaching just now but I believe that Africa will hear my voice again and the brother asked me can you get the Bible Believers broadcast in Africa and in three weeks we were on 100,000 watt swazy music radio right between or Roberts and Jimmy schwi I say that's God that arranged that that was a half hour slot they gave us and we went on that and we're on that for several years but we had people contact me I had people uh that I had spoke to and they said brother bisc maybe they call me brother Eddie I don't know but they said when we heard the prophet's voice coming over the radio they said we fell to our knees we put our head to the floor oh God you you spoke to him he said I believe that Africa will hear my voice again and here it was happening I say friends we have a living God and I want to say to you God loves this message God loves this word it's his word he loves this word he'll stand behind this word he'll stand with you when you stand with him and you stand with his message amen amen amen glory to God hallelujah hallelujah we give him all the glory we'll give all the glory to the Lord Jesus glor glory to God thank you Brothers for your support thank you for your prayers Hallelujah we believe that we are believers this is what he said and this is what he said brother Brom said here's the secret here's the secret and the the word is in the bride and he said furthermore and she knows what he wants done with it she has the spirit of God she has the word of God and she the bride knows what the bridegroom wants with the word we know what we're doing we're not ignorant we know what we're doing we know when I speak to you this is exactly what he once said Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah hallelujah this is a time to Rejoice we believe it we're prepared to demonstrate it we're prepared to go if he says go we're prepared to stay if he says stay we're prepared to preach if he says preach and we're prepared to be silent we know what sacrifice is you might just uh you might just think well we mentioned certain people I mentioned brother Tim DOD how many know our brother Tim Dodd quite a few hands for those you that don't here's a man that pastored a church for 28 years started it from nothing started in our city where my wife was born and her sister became became the piano player simple piano player just having little meetings you know how many was in the church for including brother DOD and his wife my wife sister and her mother I baptized her mother at 82 years old she died at 98 I tell you friends don't tell me that God isn't a living God God can reach them even if they're old God can can reach them when they're 82 I baptized her at 82 years old say amen that's your gospel that's your message amen that's a kind of power we believe in brother Dodd became the pastor then he felt to move the congregation which now was maybe six or eight PE persons and to move them down to Grand Prairie Alberta there about 60 70 miles maybe 100 kilomet down the road brother Tim you'll forgive me but I I feel a need to say this and I was Desiring I needed somebody because of my age because of the future somebody has to take this great work and our own congregation which is several hundred people but they don't realize there's more people out outside than there is inside there's a bigger congregation outside and they need to they need the message and they need help and they need whether it's song books or whatever whatever we just want to be a an aid to help them we started in a house we started with a few people and then when there were too many in the house we built a log church but in the log Church there was a young man hello young man he was just out of high school big tall fellow about 6' five and he was a genius up here he could work around with a with a he would be a a a computer geek you know he was a techy guy and but I I see everything Through The Eyes of the message said we need that kind of people we need people who are really smart people who can do things I can never do and I said these tapes they're very poor and they need and I know brother Brandon was burdened about them and they need to be cleaned and we need to start to filter them he said he stuttered a little bit he said I I can do it will we'll get this kind of a machine that kind of a machine we'll get this scope and we'll I'll listen to every tape for four years he listened to tapes and as he listened he made a Diary of a certain sound that came in at so many feet of the tape and a and a kind of howling sound or a whistle or something and then it would end and he would get the the the the the tone of it and get the exact uh amount of it and then he would get the filters and filter that side sound out if it was possible it was air conditioning we couldn't do it because it went across the whole tape but for 4 years he did 530 tapes 530 do you know why you brothers from Africa do you know why do you know what motivated me I sat with Brothers I sat with Brothers and they sat across from me and their dark eyes looking at my he said we can't understand the tapes are so noisy I just decided in my heart something has to be done we couldn't find a way we didn't have the money we didn't have the people but if it if you have action if you're ready and burden God Will Make A Way and God Made A Way and many that taped you here today were cleaned up in a little room by one boy out of high school Hallelujah does God know how to do things he knows exactly how to do things and we began we began to make libraries and we made libraries I thought if I could get some other churches we made libraries and we sent them out and different people uh brother Henry green who's passed away now in North Carolina brother Henry green made about 16 copies and sent them down into uh down into I can't say Trinidad but down into that that part of your of the Central America and he sent 16 copies of the of the libraries down there and then one day we got a phone call from Brother Joseph Bram and he wanted to purchase the equipment and the duplicating equipment we had very fine equipment I always believed this message calls for the best and if the best is in Germany we'll get it from Germany if it's in the United States we'll get in the United States this message deserves the best and when you see that Chinese Bible it's on India paper and it's gold leaf on the outside and it's beautiful leather because it God's word deserves the best we don't waste it but I believe it deserves the best and Brother Joseph picked up the duplicating equipment and carried on we had done 530 and I believe he's done all uh uh 1100 of them I don't know his his program exactly but I'm so glad that there they put on the the vgr the V whatever you want to call it distribute books all over the world tapes all over the world and puts it on the internet Hallelujah and furthermore I said this voice this voice of this Prophet needs to go on the internet and before people were thinking about putting voice on the internet we went to a large uh University in Vancouver has 30,000 students and they have gone into business and their business is uh is uh being they have large workstations or large uh uh repositories where they keep libraries for for telephone companies and so on excuse me I'll get up here where you can see me and then uh we we'll put these out there and we went and had a meeting with them will you put this library on on on the internet for us yes they will do so they gave us a price we said do it and and shortly brother bram's voice was on the internet and many others since then have had it on the internet I don't care what other people do I say do all you can put in any language you can Hallelujah if somebody steps up here and says I can I can I translate into the Ethiopian language we'll be right behind you we'll say God bless you we don't believe in any competition we believe in getting this word out can you say Amen we don't believe in competition we say God bless you you do all you can do it as fast as you can and do it as good as you can Hallelujah I don't have to ask you if you see what my first love is that's my first love because the message and the person of Jesus Christ to me are synonymous do you understand what synonymous is the same the same the message the life you speak of the life of the message the life of the message is Jesus Christ revealed in you and to you that's the life of the message that's what I believe and that's what I believe the next person needs they need to hear it whether they accept it or whether they rejected they still need to hear it Hallelujah I'm listening to you am thank you you forgive me I'll try to tell you this now I pastored in a church I was in that place I have a lovely wife and three daughters and I'd be in the home I'd be in that place with them and I was caring for I was working at a job things are coming to me that perhaps I shouldn't say but I came to work one morning in a furniture store furniture store I used to own when it was just a junk place and I sold it to these two men two businessmen Luther and we would talk about Luther we would talk about the uh what history stood for and now the two of them and myself three are standing there first thing in the morning and they said we had a visit last night from the local Catholic priest and uh my father spent his inheritance which is very small but he he PR reprinted tracks of converted nuns and converted priests and he he put all the pamphlets in a in a package and they delivered the packages he and two or three other people delivered the package to every household in that City now about 10 12,000 people then they delivered it to the countryside to the Farms that put put it in the mailboxes and they took it to a town north which I will mention brother Bram spoke under the pillar of fire and he mentioned Fort St John was a man was dying there with cancer and then and they delivered it to every home in Fort St John are you listening friends and they said until as long as Ed bcll is in your store we have two 2,000 2,000 Catholics in this city and they will not buy anything from your store they will not patronize your store as long as Ed bcll is there and the one man spoke up very fine man and very good friend of mine he said well Ed bcll didn't send those out it was his father Fred bisc he said it doesn't make any difference to us it doesn't make any difference as long as he is there there there will be no Catholic that will purchase from your store listen to me friends I'm not talking about the Dark Ages I'm talking about my life amen I'm talking about my food for my table I'm talking about my children which my daughters here that's what I'm talking about we we're talking about a current gospel but there was a power inside I said I may not agree with how my father did it but I will not I do not disagree with what is written on those tracks and so be it you will not have to fire me I will willingly leave and I left did I have a job no I didn't have a job did I have a paycheck no I didn't have a paycheck did I have anything did I have any reserve no I didn't have any reserve it's God's business and I knew God didn't want me to cower under that under that power I said no was a sacrifice That's What I Call self-imposed sacrifice did I consider a big sacrifice no I really didn't said it over here is brother Tim Dodd he had another kind of sacrifice and that was God allowed God imposed he's a young man his wife is beautiful young woman they have eight children and he gets up on Sunday morning and he's just showering to preach and he thought I'll just leave my wife to rest for a little bit and she' had a couple dizzy spells and God had heard when he prayed and this time time when he comes out of this shower his wife is sitting on the edge of the bed and Keels over backward and is gone that fast is gone and he began to pray and God spoke to him excuse me brother Tim God said not this time to have good God tell you not this time last time he prayed God answered to prayer did what he asked him to do this time his wife is laying up breath is gone and God saying not this time that man is sitting right over here you'll see him on Friday he's the one who went to Uganda he's the one who said to brother bus why don't you take your honeymoon he took their wedding why don't you take your honeymoon in Ethiopia and they went up to Ethiopia that's how the gospel got to Ethiopia but if he stayed pastoring his church if he stayed there and he could have stayed but he realized I can't stay without my wife I need to have my wife as a wife of a pastor had to go to church and tell them sister Allison's gone they were just with her young ladies that's a god imposed sacrifice but if it wasn't for that sacrifice he wouldn't have gone to Uganda if it wasn't for that sacrifice he wouldn't be working night and day all over the world answering emails people that send them emails can you help me with this can you help me with that and we're there anything that we can do we seek to do it I just took my phone off just before I came to the meeting a brother from Mala has written a pastor and he has a a major thing he wants me to phone him and I'm speaking to another Pastor from Boston United States in Massachusetts and he's setting up a meeting once a meeting and two weeks after we arrive home from here I tell you my brother my sister I don't know maybe he's in maybe it's one in Ethiopia I think they need to hear it don't you agree with me they have a right to hear it don't they they have a right to hear it let me see some of you still people they have a right to hear it do they not and so it's up to God and some lived and the prophet spoke about in the church ages he spoke about some that give up their lives by dying because they would not Bend they would not bow and they would not burn that's the kind of people of Bride of Jesus Christ is That's What I Call rugged Christianity and the message makes rugged Christians not some flimsy little here today gone tomorrow up today down tomorrow no no that's not the faith of Abraham the faith of Abraham is plotting on every step you take I give you the land Hallelujah do you believe that do you believe that I'm talking about a real gospel I'm not talking about something fictitious I'm not talking about a counterfeit I'm talking about a genuine gospel now don't get me wrong I don't say that you're a counterfeit not at all I believe it's real genuine I'm just encouraging you on with my burden is that all right with my burden I didn't come here just to preach you happy I came here to lay my burden upon you glory to God young men young women where are you raise your hand say here I am here I am God send me God use [Applause] me brother Daniel cunner and Brother David mayor perhaps you're here and others of uh from uh from Russia or Ria were in Switzerland and a boy brother pvic and I I talked about the Chinese Bible a boy about that doll I don't know who he is was waiting for me outside and he waited till all the people went by and we shook hands and he's waiting waiting I don't know what he's waiting on and he takes my hand he said uh uh I want a Chinese Bible I have a CH I have a Chinese friend I said God bless you I just want to hug him I thought that's such a wonderful spirit that's the kind of spirit Hallelujah maybe I'm just excited I'm thrilled about this so I was in a church I was comfortable as you were brother Tim I was comfortable with the congregation I had I loved I had I was loved and dearly loved to deacons and our people and we were at each other's home all the time but there was something inside that was gwing something was troubl I was troubled deep inside and my friends I have to be honest with you I've sensed that here some of you are got a heavy heaviness in your heart that heaviness is saying to you in a quiet voice something's missing something's missing yeah we can sing and we can rejoice and we can shout hallelujah but something's missing amen and we had the best quality of of the Gospel it was the people that received the prophet at that time they are the people that received the prophet our church and many many others of the same Fellowship of churches we received the prophet of God we're the ones that sat and filled up the meeting and drove many miles to listen to William brandham but when start coming past the second poll first poll and second pole and people begin to fall off and I knew of other great ministers I had been in the meetings of Tommy osbor and Tommy Hicks and or Roberts and then there was uh brother Gardner and and all kinds of great Ministries o Jaggers and on and on and I sat in meetings and heard these men preach some of them and it was powerful and Tommy Osborne had just come back from Argentina and filled up the largest Bull stadium in the world 500,000 people and showed a film of it in Edmonton I've been in those kind of meetings but friends you can kick me out of here tonight or tomorrow if you wish something was missing something was missing and I had a brother-in-law my brother-in-law's brother was in Cuba during their Civil War when Castor was just coming to power I'm not giving you history I'm giving you gospel and he was a man of very few words I remember it like it happened earlier today and we're carrying a plank between us and he he said did you hear what William brandham is teaching now I said no I said because my heart was so heavy I just was happy to be buried far in the north part of Canada we didn't care what was happening in the outside world I was trying to stay as pure and as close to God as I could but something was missing you know what was really missing I had some people baptized I didn't know exactly how to baptize them I'd been baptized in the name of father son Holy Ghost the titles my wife had been baptized in the titles well we didn't know any different we didn't have any absolute we didn't have any answers and I wasn't sure what the godhead was one of the brothers that was really a father to me he thought it's just two and many others thought it was three and anyone who thought it was one was called Jesus only and I didn't know I've been preaching seven years my friend seven years and I didn't know these fundamentals was something missing yes you know who knew he knew he knew and I so wanted to talk to brother brandham and his was the first time we went out brother caps I know this will mean something to you it's our first time I want to talk to him so bad I want but I didn't want I respected his time and respected his rest and I wanted above all things to give him a rest to his mind I didn't know all the doctrine or all the things I didn't know any about anything about it and I didn't want to get entangled with politics not that he would entangle me in politics but I just didn't I just didn't want to raise any question that would cause him any distress just have a peaceful hunt arrest friend you from Switzerland you have a beautiful country we have a similar country hello magnificent mountains soaring into the hills into the into the sky but you know what its beauty is it's rugged there's no roads there's no Villages there's no pasture land there's no sheep grazing tame sheep there's no there's nothing there it's rugged and it's the way God made it and the prophet of God loved that country and went back there every year except his last year 65 and so we were in the midst of that Country Flowers God planted them grass trees water from the glaciers it was just magnificent I've looked at flowers and just wept for their beauty CU God had it it was God's Garden and it was a rugged uninhabited place you could go hundreds of kilometers North hundreds of kilometers South you'd never run into a man or a vehicle there was no sounds no horns no Sirens no electric lights everything was rugged the way God made it and I want to talk with brother Bram but he went with the brother Southwick and I went with a Trapper from our church brother Chris Berg a very close friend small man and this evening after we have finished eating I was going to do dishes and the reason we went we didn't have many people we just wanted to do it ourselves and brother brandom said I think I'll just go maybe get a rabbit or get because we didn't have any meat said maybe just get some meat he said would you like to come brother Addie yes I said I certainly would like to come then brother chrisberg his dear friend said yeah he said he was Scandinavian he said yeah he said I think I'll go too sure brother bam said why don't you come and then he said no no I'm going to stay I'm going to do the dishes you go brother Eddie all right so brother brandham and I you know that was all pre-planned I didn't know it was pre-planned but but that was all pre-planned and I and and brother Bram and I are walking down this little path and then he walks off like this and I just walk with him and he sits down on a log he sits on this log and I'm sitting this way and he's sitting this way now friends I want you to listen real close I don't tell this to everybody but this was about the time I was going to get moved to another place to another place I was in a place of heaviness I was in the place of deep deep spiritual concern I just didn't know exactly about certain major things and I had grave doubts in my heart about brother branam because my brother-in-law's brother said have you heard what's brother bram's preaching now and I said no he said something about Cain being the son of The Serpent and I said oh no I said where'd he get that he said I don't know and that was in my heart and we're sitting on this log and I thought I read Genesis 4 And1 and Adam knew his wife and she conceived and bear a son and call his name Cain I've gotten a man from the Lord and I said that's it if brother Bram tries to go around that listen friends I want you to understand me I said if brother Bram tries to go around the word that'll be the end of our friendship I I I I I I have to stay with the word of God so brother brandham is sitting there and he said U we talked about just a couple of things a few things and then he said uh brother Eddie said I was riding on my horse I believe it was this mountain here I was I going behind brother Southwick and he said uh he came to me there I had heard those words when I sat on the platform in some meetings when brother Brandon would just raise his finger and say he's here I knew who it was that was there I knew that angel of the Lord was there the angel of the Lord I've heard spoke about in these Services I knew that angel of the Lord was there and he said and now I just I'm telling you my my story and he said he he came to be there and when he said that I don't mean to have my back to you I just I looked straight into his face and we're only about that far apart and his eyes like yours are not uh you know a person's eyes are they're kind of Crystal or clear they move around and from one place to another his eyes were just deep set and uh it was different weren't and they weren't sharp and Intense or nothing like that but they were like like a 10,000 candle power just a dull intense friends now what I tell you is absolutely the truth before God and I looked at him and he's just looking at me like this he said he came to me there and I believe you have three questions you want to ask ask me friends I tell you in that presence I was naked in that presence there was no word for me to speak in that presence I didn't wait I didn't move I didn't have any happy feeling I didn't I didn't have any fearful feeling but I knew I was in the presence of an awesome person and that's why I understood every time I hear the prophet saying that won't hurt you that's him not me when that Prophet would say I'm in Two Worlds at this time saying and someone come up and he says the congregation you watch their face now it it it has changed it's Chang because they've come into the presence of the Angel of the Lord and it has a physical a physical effect upon a person you can't come into that presence without it's not just something you feel it's awesome no one wants to be exposed do you hear me friends I would like to be across a desk from you I'd like to be able to speak your language I was naked I there wasn't even any word for me to say uhh but uh there was nothing for me to say he said I believe you you have three questions and the first one and he took them in the order they were in my heart in the order of importance he said the first one is on the baptism and the second one is on the godhead and the third one is on the Serpent's Seed and I I raised my finger and I said brother brandom but the scripture says the scripture says and Adam knew his wife and and she conceived and she said I've got I've got a man from the Lord and his name was Cain and brother brandom said that's exactly the truth I thought how can you be saying that that's my defense how can you be saying that's exactly the truth he said but you need to read the next verse I I was a preacher but I didn't know what the next verse was was and the next verse is and she again bear his brother Abel and he said they were twins you know what I said oh that's what I said oh I didn't know they were twins i' never heard they were twins this was something completely new this was something that came from uh some place in outer space they were twins he said they've always been twins Isaac and ishmail and Jesus and Judas and Christ and Antichrist and by the time by the time they come about the same time and they leave about the same time and I I'd never heard such things in my life I thought oh they were twins he says every Revival Bears twins friends I want to be the right kind of twin Hallelujah I want to be a born again blood the true son of the Living God hallelujah and that was the first time and now I tell you my dear precious friends that is where my understanding of him was anchored there I gained such a Holiness and now you're being so nice I will I will relate a few wish one that I very seldom tell young men are you listening we were riding in the car and he was driving and I was sitting on the pth passenger side and he had that little white cowboy hat on kind of put it back he said brother Eddie what do you think of this ministry do you think it could be that of Elijah the prophet as it's foretold in the scripture and on down and then he went to Revelation and then his voice just trailed off and I had listened to tapes some of the old real tapes and I heard that when he was under uh a real heavy anointing very heavy in visions and I I would hear him say uh-huh uh-huh uh you come from a certain place you come from the East uhhuh uhhuh and your daughter wrote you a letter uhuh uhuh and the letters in your person his voice would just Trail off and that's I had observed that you've seen and heard that now I hear his voice just Trail off do you believe this could be that of Elijah the prophet as is foretold in the scripture and then his voice began to Trail off and then the last word I heard was Revelation I felt completely completely incapable I felt that I was not to answer this kind of a question you brothers are listening very intently and I trust this will mean something to you and I look down at the glove box and I said well brother brandham for all I know it must be because it has every appearance of being and I kind of looked at him sideways and he put his head back we bit like this said off kind of wondered I kind of think so myself and at that instant at that instant just you talk about a wind you talk about a force nothing you could feel there was nothing you could feel there was nothing physical you could feel but there was a person there was a being that sat between he and I and he was just forward a wee bit just towards the dash I could actually tell you exactly how it was and I thought I thought if I breathe in or exhale I'm going into some other place I'm going to die I'm going into another another world if I breathe and I didn't want to move I was frozen I'm talking to you about him I'm talking to you about the Holiness of this one we call a pillar of fire and I looked I just looked I cast my eyes sideways because I was afraid to move my head I cast my eyes sideways and looked at him and brother bram's beard we had about four days of beard and I know that when a person is under extreme trauma their beard will stick out prickly and his his beard was prickly sticking out on his face and I saw his color had drained from his face and I thought he looks like he's near death brother brand roll his head back slowly slowly just over to the side the eyes were the same as they were when I was on the log he looked at me he said brother Eddie and I was just thinking he looks like he's near death he said brother Eddie I guess he's come to me 10,000 times 10,000 and that's just every time like I could die and just at that moment I had been hunting for Moose for meat large animal they stand about 2 m at the shoulders and brother brandham was driving and he was just we're going around on the gravel Highway going around this curve and there's this large animal standing in the middle of the road and it shocked me I said oh oh brother brandom there's a moose I said you know just stop I'll get him and his voice is still slow and thick and he says it's it's all it's all right brother Eddie it's all right just get your gun and your shells I had my gun in my hand he said just get your gun and your shells it's all right and he just kept driving the same speed I said stop brother brandom I'll get him now we're just maybe a 100 m or less and he said it's all right he said something like it's yours he's yours he said just have your gun and he drove up the closest I've ever been to a wild animal about 90 M and stops and I get out and I have a scope on my rifle and I'm looking through the scope and all I see is hair I can't even see the animal and I have to lift the gun up to the sky and see the hump on the animal and bring it down it's the only time in my life I had that experience and I pulled the trigger and I saw the bullet actually now some of you people may not like this but this we live on meat and and the bullet just entered in and poof and then I thought oh I don't want him to stop I don't want him to stop on the highway someone will come over the hill and hit him and we'll have an accident I I thought and then there's a wide area maybe like from here to the wall That's all clear just grass and then trees starting there and I thought I don't want them to fall there some we don't have room and somebody will come and steal him and take all this meat maybe five six seven 700 lbs of meat a large animal and and I needed that animal for food for my family and and and the Moose he just walked down stepped off the highway and he started to walk slowly slowly and I know he's not going to go very far and I don't want him I need him hid because I don't need him out in this grass somebody will steal him and he walks into the trees and just as he walks into the trees I fire another shot another young brother was traveling with us catching a ride he fired a shot and a moose stepped over two big logs two big logs and was completely hidden and fell right there you say would God do that absolutely my father would do that and completely hid that animal and we dressed we dressed the animal and God's Prophet sat on a tree right beside us and he watched me in the other the young man and we dressed this animal got it all ready got it dressed we finished wiped our knives walk back to the car brother BR walked with me we got in a car he sat in his seat and I sat friends I'm not giv over to special things but I was surrounded in an atmosphere it was it was so Divine it even had a color it was like emerald green there's nothing my eyes were registering I said this is the most beautiful place I thought oh God I'd like to just live here forever and the prophet laid his head back looked at me he said brother Eddie every time he comes something good happens brother colen brother you called this meeting and you precious people came I don't know where you come from but this is the one I come to tell you about and every time he comes something good happens I'm talking to you young ladies every time he comes he knows exactly the deep deep deep something that's so deep you can't speak about it
