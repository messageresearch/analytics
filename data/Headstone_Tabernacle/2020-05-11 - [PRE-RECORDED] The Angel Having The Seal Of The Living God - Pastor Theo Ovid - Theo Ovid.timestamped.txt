[31:48] booting up on my heart message a special
[31:50] message to you this morning
[31:52] so we want to get into the word you
[31:54] ready for the word this morning
[31:56] okay ezekiel chapter 9 revelations up to
[31:59] 7 we want to go to those two scriptures
[32:01] this morning Ezekiel 9 Revelation
[32:03] chapter 7
[32:05] thank you musicians
[32:23] he kept chapter nine reading from verse
[32:25] one to six revelation 7 read verse one
[32:28] to four we didn't Ezekiel chapter 9
[32:32] verse 1 he cried also in mine ears with
[32:37] a loud voice sin caused him to have
[32:39] charge over the city to join near even
[32:43] every man with his destroying weapon in
[32:46] his hand and behold six men came from
[32:49] the way of the higher gate which led
[32:51] towards the north and every man a
[32:53] slaughter weapon in his hand and one man
[32:56] among them was clothed with linen with a
[33:00] writer's inkhorn by his side and they
[33:03] went in and stood beside the brazen
[33:06] altar and the glory of the God of Israel
[33:10] was gone up from the cherub whereupon he
[33:12] was to the threshold of the house and he
[33:16] called to the man clothed with linen
[33:18] which had a writer's inkhorn by his side
[33:21] and the Lord said unto him go to the
[33:25] midst of the city through the midst of
[33:28] Jerusalem and set a mark upon the
[33:32] foreheads of the men that sigh and cry
[33:36] for all the abominations that be done in
[33:39] the midst thereof and the others he said
[33:43] in my hearing go ye after him through
[33:46] the city and smite let not your eyes
[33:48] spear
[33:49] neither have EPT slay utterly all and
[33:54] young what maids
[33:56] little children and woman but come not
[33:59] near any man upon whom is the mark and
[34:03] begin at my sanctuary
[34:06] then they began at the ancient men which
[34:10] were before the house Revelation chapter
[34:13] 7 when I read from verse 1 and after
[34:17] these things I saw four angels standing
[34:19] on the four corners of the earth holding
[34:21] the four winds of the earth that the
[34:24] wind should not blow on the earth nor on
[34:27] the scene on any tree I saw another
[34:31] angel ascending
[34:33] from the east having the seal of the
[34:36] Living God and he cried with a loud
[34:39] voice to the four angels to whom it was
[34:42] given to hurt the earth and the sea
[34:44] saying hurt not the earth needless sea
[34:48] nor the trees till we have sealed the
[34:52] servants of our God in their foreheads
[34:54] and I heard the number of them which
[34:57] were sealed and they were sealed
[34:59] a hundred and forty-four thousand of all
[35:02] the tribes of the Chilam Balam may God
[35:05] bless his word you may be seated
[35:08] oh praise the name of the Lord oh thank
[35:17] you lord well have a title this morning
[35:21] and the title is the angel having the
[35:25] seal of the Living God that's a title of
[35:30] a subject the seal of God and an
[35:34] inspiration crying and sighin
[35:38] that's why inspiration crying and sigh
[35:41] now we know 1933 God gave the Prophet
[35:44] seven visions which he says must come to
[35:48] pass before the coming of the Lord and
[35:52] the fifth vision he said science will
[35:56] progress in such a way until they will
[35:59] make a car that will not have to be
[36:01] guided by a steering wheel and the cars
[36:05] will continue to be shaped like an egg
[36:07] until the consummation the end time I
[36:11] seen American family going on the road
[36:14] in a broad way rising in a car with
[36:18] their backs turn towards where a wheel
[36:21] should be look like they were playing
[36:23] checkers or cards and so on like that
[36:26] and then the six he said I saw a woman
[36:29] stand up beautiful looking just in a
[36:32] high royal purple I got a little
[36:35] parenthesis here she was a great ruler
[36:37] in United States and he has perhaps the
[36:40] Catholic Church a woman some woman I
[36:42] know this is a woman's nation this
[36:44] nation is number thirteen and prophecy
[36:46] she's got 13 stripes 13 stars she
[36:49] started 13 colonies 13 everything is 13
[36:52] and it appears in the 13 chapter of
[36:54] Revelation she's 13 she's a woman's
[36:56] nation and now for the last vision he
[37:02] says now then I turn and I looked and I
[37:05] saw this United States burning like a
[37:09] smaller rocks had been blown up it was
[37:13] burning like a heap of fire in logs or
[37:16] something just set it afire and look as
[37:19] far as I could see she has been blown up
[37:23] and then the vision left me five out of
[37:27] tree has happened or 707 has happened
[37:31] and so on so this was the vision that
[37:34] the prophet have and we had in long no
[37:37] to that vision we know what man has
[37:41] built will produce that vision with
[37:43] Atomics on everything else
[37:45] so her message lunacy content for the
[37:48] feet he said notice let's get back to
[37:50] keen again let's get back to some faith
[37:52] in the beginning watch those spirits how
[37:55] do you begin to move it's the spirit of
[37:58] anything that does the work of it anyhow
[38:01] so it's not just the thing is the spirit
[38:05] behind the thing there's the spirit in
[38:07] your home there's a spirit in this
[38:09] church there's a spirit that motivate in
[38:11] your life this is a spirit behind the
[38:13] same that's why you have to get into the
[38:15] right spirit that it can work correctly
[38:18] for you not just teens but the spirit
[38:21] behind it you have to know what spirit
[38:24] is behind operation behind you could you
[38:27] say Amen the people here we go have got
[38:30] to be in this kind of a spirit to bring
[38:34] the latter days so the latter this is a
[38:37] spirit that's why Jesus said as it was
[38:40] in the days of nor as it was in the days
[38:44] of Sodom surely be because of spirit
[38:47] atmosphere was there and he is saying to
[38:50] them that spirit was not going to come
[38:52] back hallelujah
[38:55] to bring that prophecy to pass or glory
[38:58] to God listen this bride will not feel
[39:00] this bride will not fall despry
[39:04] understand because this bride will have
[39:06] a spirit which is de spirit which is the
[39:10] Holy Spirit this is what God promised
[39:13] I feel confident of these promises that
[39:17] the Prophet spoke we are resting on it
[39:20] Oh glory the poor do believe that so the
[39:25] people have to be in this kind of a
[39:28] spirit to bring the latter days the
[39:30] people in the spirit of the latter days
[39:33] the nations are in the spirit of the end
[39:36] time the God atomic weapons hydrogen
[39:38] weapons all kind of things because it's
[39:40] the spirit of the day and the people are
[39:42] in the spirit of the end time and the
[39:45] church is moving together under the
[39:47] power and impact of the Holy Spirit so
[39:49] what are you saying if outside is moving
[39:51] in their spirit you have to move under
[39:54] the impact of the Holy Ghost you have to
[39:57] move under your Newton or Gloria Nagar
[40:02] some a stoppie a minute
[40:04] I believe the people are in the
[40:07] preparation for the last great
[40:10] destruction this world will ever know I
[40:13] believe we are the endtime you can speak
[40:16] to people you could put a Billy Graham
[40:18] in every city in the United States they
[40:20] will drink whiskey they smoke cigarettes

[1:22:39] accepting the person of Christ
[1:22:41] these things are attributes shouting

[1:22:44] praying whatever attributes because I
[1:22:47] man cries I've seen mine cry cry
[1:22:48] crocodile tears and he's still a big sin
[1:22:51] as he could be
[1:22:52] listen Jesus had nothing but sheep but
[1:22:54] every good cry
[1:22:55] he said sobbing he said watch watch
[1:22:57] shouting and so on like that he said
[1:22:59] brother branham do believe in crying
[1:23:00] don't take me wrong I believe in crying
[1:23:02] I'm not seeing that no evidence I
[1:23:04] believe in shouting I believe in
[1:23:06] speaking in tongues is God's gift but
[1:23:08] and whether Christ have stones in it but
[1:23:11] it's accepting the person Christ Jesus
[1:23:14] and these other things come right on in
[1:23:16] and they fit together let I remember
[1:23:19] listen of this body this morning
[1:23:21] let is a group of people if we could
[1:23:24] pull the curtains down alone on each
[1:23:26] side every person he received a person
[1:23:29] Christ Jesus there would never be a fuss
[1:23:31] there would never be no argument
[1:23:35] because the person of Christ is what
[1:23:38] going to be in operation and the Holy
[1:23:40] Ghost can't behave in one brother and
[1:23:43] misbehave in another brother
[1:23:48] is this the way there'll be perfect love
[1:23:56] you will still believe this on that but

[1:24:27] song
[1:24:27] now I'll give you my estimation of what
[1:24:29] I think the closest thing to an evidence
[1:24:32] that a man is a Christian that anything
[1:24:36] I know of you know what it is it's a
[1:24:39] travail of soul a person that is always
[1:24:42] so hungry and thirsting for God day and
[1:24:46] night they can't stand it they've got to
[1:24:49] do something for God they are full of
[1:24:51] love they are just sold travail just
[1:24:53] traveling all the time the Bible study
[1:24:56] that great force win and tears with dope
[1:24:58] let's return again and rejoice and bring
[1:25:00] them with him precious sheath is that
[1:25:02] right now what do you want them to do
[1:25:04] you want do you want them to shout your
[1:25:06] church yes sure I wanted to show be
[1:25:08] wanting to speak in tongues I want every
[1:25:10] one of them to do want him to dance in
[1:25:12] the spirit I want any one of them to
[1:25:14] that's good but what would you rather
[1:25:16] have them to do he said speaking I'll
[1:25:18] rather have a church here we go there
[1:25:21] how such a burden on the heart for
[1:25:23] prayer that I just stared at this altar
[1:25:26] and will be here day and night and
[1:25:28] everything else in the house was
[1:25:30] constantly in prayer and humble trying
[1:25:33] to get people to come to God making
[1:25:35] cause at the hospital visiting the sick
[1:25:37] trying to get the people to come to
[1:25:39] church and do right I rather have that
[1:25:40] then all you gotta put together although
[1:25:42] the other is right it belongs to the
[1:25:44] church but
[1:25:45] if I have to have it I'll put that first
[1:25:47] what if you got that which is the prayer
[1:25:50] the other will take place if you've got
[1:25:52] that you will get so hungry for God
[1:25:54] shelter might take place if it was only
[1:25:56] for God you keep on hungry no what if
[1:25:58] you're seized up getting indifferent
[1:26:00] remember there's another spirit at work
[1:26:02] Oh hallelujah what is it at reveal of
[1:26:06] soul let's continue
[1:26:09] I can prove by the Bible that the first
[1:26:11] time the angel of God went over the land
[1:26:15] to see with the Holy Ghost
[1:26:17] he only see those who cried inside for
[1:26:21] the abomination Ezekiel chapter 9 I want
[1:26:24] to ask you a question I'll ask you this
[1:26:26] question

[1:51:03] thee to be merciful to these people and
[1:51:05] grant Almighty God here tonight at least
[1:51:09] twenty hands went up in the building

[1:51:13] souls the spirit the oil is just about
[1:51:18] burnt out
[1:51:19] there won't be much more when the last
[1:51:23] drop is gone from the bucket or the
[1:51:26] container there'll be no more oil put in
[1:51:29] lamps they realize that they're in the
[1:51:32] last days there's not a hope on earth
[1:51:35] for us outside of Christ I pray tonight
[1:51:38] Lord that somehow in the psalmist of
[1:51:40] this moment the solemnity that you would
[1:51:42] now send the Holy Spirit that made them
[1:51:44] raise their hands and see them from my
[1:51:45] life of sin so here you bring a
[1:51:48] description in prayer about the Holy
[1:51:51] Spirit
[1:51:51] about the almost burnt out and when the
[1:51:55] last drop is going on the bucket or
[1:51:58] container there'd be no more oil to put
[1:52:01] in lungs
[1:52:02] that's a telling thing that's a powerful
[1:52:06] thing I wanted to will you just think
[1:52:10] how much you need the Holy Spirit

[1:52:16] Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten

[1:52:23] wise five were foolish
[1:52:25] there were foolish took their lamps and
[1:52:27] took no oil with them but the wise took
[1:52:29] oil in their vessels with their lamps
[1:52:31] while the bridegroom tarried they all
[1:52:34] slumbered and slept at a midnight there
[1:52:35] was a cry made behold a brand commit go
[1:52:37] out to meet him and all those virgins
[1:52:39] arose trim their lamps the foolish said
[1:52:41] to the wise give us of your oil for our
[1:52:43] lamps are going out but the wise
[1:52:46] answered saying not so least there'd be
[1:52:48] not enough for us and you but go ye
[1:52:51] rather to them that sell and buy for
[1:52:53] yourselves while I went to buy the
[1:52:57] bridegroom came and dateable ready went
[1:52:59] in with him to the marriage and the door
[1:53:01] was shut
[1:53:01] afterwards key most of the other virgins

[1:54:58] making a business baby
[1:55:05] hallelujah so watch he's talking about
[1:55:09] watch no there's 144,000 Israel that's
[1:55:13] waiting for the coming of the Lord and
[1:55:14] kind of go in until the Gentiles are
[1:55:18] finished it's got to be finished so
[1:55:22] where I'm said I taught to be wonderful
[1:55:23] he wanted to go to Israel himself he
[1:55:26] said on my ticket in my hand about 30
[1:55:28] minutes before haul in the Arabian plane
[1:55:29] line I was standing out in Cairo Egypt
[1:55:32] I taught priests got in tomorrow as the
[1:55:34] Jews will receive the same thing that
[1:55:36] there are Pentecost just as sure as
[1:55:38] anything I thought if I stand here and
[1:55:40] tell them go pick us out a bunch of men
[1:55:42] or among you and bring them here and see
[1:55:45] we still Messiah then they were saying
[1:55:46] no upon the same grounds of your
[1:55:48] forefathers rejected the Messiah you
[1:55:49] receive him you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:55:51] and then we will evangelize the world
[1:55:53] something struck me and said do not go
[1:55:56] now for the hour is not yet the Gentiles
[1:56:02] isn't fulfilled yet daddy isn't finished
[1:56:06] oh I thought that was just me
[1:56:09] so I started again it got so bad that I
[1:56:12] just couldn't stand it I went out behind
[1:56:14] a hanger ball my head I said father is
[1:56:16] that you speaking to me he said do not
[1:56:19] go to Israel now the hour is not here I
[1:56:22] went in and changed my ticket rotated
[1:56:25] again the other way see cause the or is
[1:56:27] not yet but one of these days the
[1:56:30] message will go to Israel and God will
[1:56:33] send them Moses and Elijah in revelation
[1:56:36] 11 and they will do signs and wonders
[1:56:39] and you over sign why the Gentile is
[1:56:41] finished the day of grace will leave the
[1:56:43] Gentile church the Pentecostal age would
[1:56:46] leave no these wise virgins oil in the
[1:56:50] Bible symbolize Holy Spirit we all know
[1:56:52] that and we are known the sacred oil oil
[1:56:54] symbolize Holy Spirit
[1:56:55] so they were ready to go in at the
[1:56:57] wedding supper and we could go back in
[1:56:59] Ezekiel 9 and so forth now this version
[1:57:02] is a virgin this was a foolish version
[1:57:05] this was a wise version and virgin means
[1:57:07] sanctified and clean if there was some
[1:57:10] way I could just make the people see it
[1:57:12] just burns in my soul these churches are
[1:57:16] clean and holy as this one if all are
[1:57:19] virgins they're all virgins just clean
[1:57:21] the only difference was oil in the lamp
[1:57:24] the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost if
[1:57:27] it's in there it produced a very same
[1:57:30] kind of fire it did on Pentecost but
[1:57:34] they don't have no fire no oil in your
[1:57:36] lamp they have chose rituals just just a
[1:57:39] ritual fine ceremonies not against it
[1:57:42] Cree's that shake a conscience and songs
[1:57:44] like angels singing but you could put
[1:57:47] and you can't put your finger on your
[1:57:48] life you couldn't do it but that's still
[1:57:51] wrong it is part of it but not all of it
[1:57:54] that's the kind of misses the rapture
[1:57:57] clean people nice people but it's a
[1:58:01] hunger in there's no science there's no
[1:58:04] crime there's no Holy Spirit we read the
[1:58:07] other night these people will not be an
[1:58:09] organization
[1:58:10] they'll be Wanderers around the land
[1:58:12] dwelling in tents poor and humble don't
[1:58:14] you try to curse them because I'm with
[1:58:16] them these people believe the same rich
[1:58:18] what they believe in what did the same
[1:58:19] God see but they didn't have someone
[1:58:21] who's following them it really had a
[1:58:23] brass serpent smitten rock the jaw of
[1:58:25] the king divine healing prophets they
[1:58:28] were there with a blessing the same
[1:58:29] thing with a sleepin version and the
[1:58:31] wise version you were both sanctified
[1:58:33] people this one had oil this one did not
[1:58:36] have oil they said we are just as good
[1:58:38] as you were
[1:58:38] there's none of us good as far as that
[1:58:40] concern you're a bunch of holy rollers
[1:58:41] they had weakened but when they did this
[1:58:45] one could go in because they had oil in
[1:58:47] their lamps that was the difference this
[1:58:50] one could go in there was no ordinary
[1:58:52] lamp they went back to pray up to
[1:58:54] receive the Holy Ghost they were a
[1:58:55] matter what pray up to receive the Holy
[1:58:58] Ghost but while they were gone it was
[1:59:00] all over yes the sleepin virgin this
[1:59:03] sleepin virgin now you want to know what
[1:59:05] would become of her
[1:59:06] watch the create tribulations
[1:59:09] they will have to go true know let me
[1:59:11] get the rest of that they were casting
[1:59:13] out of darkness where there was weeping
[1:59:15] and wailing and gnashing of teeth or
[1:59:17] praise the name of the Lord
[1:59:19] so watch these two spirits working
[1:59:22] almost alike right down here now one is
[1:59:25] the denomination the other one is the
[1:59:27] Holy Ghost and Jesus said they will be
[1:59:30] so close that they would deceive the
[1:59:32] very elect it is possible these here we
[1:59:35] go are you ready are you listening these
[1:59:38] two spirits are marking their people for
[1:59:42] future judgments so you are being marked
[1:59:47] by the word to be sealed well yeah do
[1:59:53] you get that right now this morning I
[1:59:57] [Applause]
[1:59:59] went what put that back upon you nobody

[2:00:04] take it off

[2:00:20] I come quickly blessed is he that keep
[2:00:23] the scene of the prophecy of this book
[2:00:25] and then he said he doesn't judge not be
[2:00:27] unjust still he was just filthy let him
[2:00:29] be filthy still he does realize his
[2:00:30] righteous still he does holy be holy
[2:00:32] still
[2:00:32] behold I come quickly my reward is with
[2:00:34] me to give every man according to his
[2:00:36] works shall be all my you love him oh

[2:01:13] what about this one everything else

[2:01:24] church really strikes home to that

[2:01:40] prison Almighty God unless elected
[2:01:42] church I pray that he will pour your
[2:01:44] blessings that they might receive a
[2:01:46] ministry of testimony like lot hat like

[2:01:51] eternal laws if it be here that they
[2:01:54] themselves are sealed into the kingdom
