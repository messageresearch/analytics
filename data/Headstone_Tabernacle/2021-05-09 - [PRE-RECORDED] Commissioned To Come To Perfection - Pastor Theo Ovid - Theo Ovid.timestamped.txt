[27:19] tremendous
[27:20] blessing and i'm so happy to hear that
[27:22] report
[27:23] so we want to go into scriptures matthew
[27:25] 5 48
[27:26] ephesians 4 11 and 1st peter 4
[27:30] 12 to 14. marty 5 48 one verse
[27:34] be there for perfect even as your father
[27:37] which is in heaven is perfect
[27:41] ephesians 4 reading from verse 11
[27:44] and he gave some apostles and some
[27:46] prophets on some evangelists
[27:48] and some pastors and teachers for the
[27:51] perfection of the saints
[27:52] for the work of the ministry for the
[27:55] edifying of the body of christ
[27:57] till we all come in the unity of the
[27:59] fate and of the knowledge of the son of
[28:01] god
[28:02] unto a perfect man unto the measure
[28:05] of the stature of the fullness of christ
[28:09] and from first peter chapter four
[28:12] i want to read from verse 12 it reads
[28:15] beloved
[28:16] think it not strange concerning the
[28:18] fiery trial which is to try you
[28:21] as do some strange thing
[28:24] happen unto you but rejoice
[28:27] in as much as your partakers of christ's
[28:30] sufferings
[28:31] that when his glory shall be revealed
[28:34] you may be glad also with exceeding
[28:38] joy if ye be reproached
[28:41] for the name of christ happier ye for
[28:44] the spirit of glory
[28:46] and of god rested upon you on their part
[28:50] he's evil spoken of but on your part he
[28:53] is glorified let's pray father we thank
[28:55] you
[28:56] for your holy word and i pray that you
[28:58] would
[29:00] take your spirit and make more sense
[29:03] of it today to every heart guarded here
[29:07] bring it in its simplicity of revelation
[29:09] and power
[29:10] that each person would leave here
[29:11] edified built up strengthened
[29:14] inspired i wanted to love you and be
[29:16] draw closer to you
[29:18] bless each one got it here bless those
[29:20] that will be listening on the internet
[29:22] bless the whole internet community that
[29:24] will be connected to us this morning
[29:26] in a special remedy anointing sweep into
[29:28] their homes into their hearts into their
[29:30] lives
[29:31] and wherever this tape be played and
[29:33] jesus may ask it
[29:34] amen and amen you may be seated god
[29:37] bless you
[29:38] again it's a great privilege an honor
[29:42] for me to be here
[29:43] but i have something upon my heart that
[29:46] i believe is
[29:47] extremely important for the church
[29:50] today and i believe that that service
[29:54] they that wait upon the lord we want to
[29:57] continue
[29:58] not the exact line but continue along
[30:01] that vein
[30:02] because the prophet said perfection is
[30:04] patience written on god
[30:06] and waiting for god that is the process
[30:09] of character development
[30:11] so this morning i have a title
[30:13] commissioned
[30:15] to come to perfection commissioned
[30:19] to come to perfection and have a subject
[30:23] place of trying i have an inspiration
[30:28] let us go on to perfection
[30:31] the subject place of trying i will
[30:34] brackets around that
[30:36] the process of character development to
[30:39] continue
[30:39] that's what this place of trying is all
[30:42] about
[30:43] now the word commission is the act of
[30:46] granting certain powers
[30:48] or the authority to carry out a
[30:51] particular task
[30:52] or duty or document conferring such
[30:56] authorization
[30:57] or power thus granted so when jesus
[31:00] said be there for perfect even as your
[31:04] father
[31:06] which is in heaven is perfect it's a
[31:08] commission
[31:09] to perfection he is saying you tier four
[31:12] this amplified must be perfect and going
[31:16] deeper
[31:17] growing into complete maturity
[31:20] of godliness in mind and character
[31:24] having reached the proper height of
[31:26] virtue and integrity
[31:28] as your heavenly father is perfect
[31:31] so when we're talking about perfect
[31:33] we're talking about getting to the
[31:35] channel of really being mature
[31:37] understanding being thoroughly
[31:40] admonished and taught
[31:42] mature in handling your issues
[31:45] in handling your trials that you
[31:47] wouldn't count it strange
[31:49] what is happening to you because you
[31:51] will understand
[31:52] that your trial of your faith is where
[31:55] patients get
[31:57] opportunity to work and patients must
[31:59] have its perfect work
[32:01] that you may be entire lacking nothing
[32:04] and in that
[32:05] trial and struggle is where character
[32:08] is developed and where you come to
[32:11] maturity
[32:12] like your father he was perfect or is
[32:15] mature
[32:16] having the wisdom and understanding to
[32:19] deal with the issues
[32:20] as they come your way so it wouldn't be
[32:23] be no more children
[32:24] tossed to and fro blaming this one
[32:27] blaming that one
[32:28] making excuses but you will accept
[32:31] responsibility
[32:32] for your actions and your attitude
[32:34] knowing
[32:35] that god expect that of you as mature
[32:38] sons and daughters this is the service
[32:41] to put away
[32:42] the bibs and the baby stuff there's the
[32:44] service to put away
[32:46] the pacifiers and the thing you want to
[32:48] suck on
[32:49] this is that kind of service this is a
[32:51] service to wreck the church members
[32:53] and get the bride out feeling to be like
[32:56] bride to be
[32:57] mrs jesus christ this is that kind of
[32:59] service
[33:00] let us go on to perfection forget about
[33:03] church could somebody say amen
[33:06] let the church say amen hallelujah
[33:09] this is that kind of service to go on to
[33:12] move on
[33:13] to press on there's a goal that somebody
[33:15] want to achieve you're accustomed just
[33:17] come in the church and go back home i
[33:18] challenge you
[33:19] this morning to go beyond that let's go
[33:21] on to perfection let's give the lord a
[33:23] shout out free
[33:33] [Music]
[33:36] hallelujah
[33:38] just let me drop this before i start but
[33:41] branham and what is the holy ghost said
[33:43] what
[33:44] is the holy ghost what is it
[33:47] now the reason i've taken this subject
[33:49] in line like this
[33:51] here we go you cannot receive
[33:54] the holy spirit therefore you can't be
[33:56] it if you have to receive it
[33:57] what we're talking about you're
[33:58] receiving it you cannot receive
[34:02] the holy spirit unless you know what it
[34:04] is
[34:05] and you cannot receive it if you know
[34:08] what it is unless you believe it's given
[34:11] to you
[34:12] and it's for you then you cannot know
[34:15] whether you got it or not
[34:16] unless you know the results it brings so
[34:19] if you

[45:59] even the devil are always loving you oh
[46:02] sit down man
[46:03] oh hallelujah hallelujah so when he made
[46:07] man in his own image
[46:08] he reflected him god spoke through
[46:12] the image of man showing what he will do
[46:14] the perfect image
[46:16] god and murphy had changed here we go
[46:19] from supernatural division
[46:22] and the vision was projected like have a
[46:24] projector division was projected into an
[46:27] image and the image was smitten
[46:30] so the supernatural could taste the
[46:32] feeling of debt
[46:33] god's perfect masterpiece
[46:37] then he started another pentecost to
[46:39] build another masterpiece
[46:40] original seed word started in the first
[46:43] church
[46:44] what was it the seed word the word
[46:46] manifested
[46:48] the promise that has been given and then
[46:50] he gave the scripture joel said have a
[46:52] scripture assigned to these things you
[46:53] know if that come to pass
[46:54] i'll pour my spirit upon all flesh your
[46:57] sons and daughters shall prophesy
[46:58] old men shall dream dreams young men
[47:00] shall see visions amen there's none
[47:02] right
[47:03] notice it started out as original the
[47:06] word is a seed a sour soul
[47:08] watch this stalk don't look like the
[47:09] seed near there's a tassel
[47:11] but watch watch the tassel doesn't look
[47:14] like the seed the first thing the farmer
[47:16] sitting here
[47:16] it forms a little outside thing to hold
[47:18] the seed form a husk the husk
[47:20] is not the seed no more the tassel that
[47:22] stock was
[47:23] it's only a carrier of the life so
[47:26] you're talking about the life of christ
[47:27] right
[47:28] but the stalk carries the life the blade
[47:30] carries the life
[47:31] it's only carrying the life the life is
[47:34] on a journey to go
[47:35] somewhere when you put the seed in the
[47:38] life is in the seed
[47:40] locked up sealed up covered up
[47:43] wrapped up standing alone seed looking
[47:46] to be buried
[47:47] but when that seed go in the ground it
[47:49] go through processes
[47:51] let's say the process of character
[47:52] development let's say the process of
[47:54] becoming a son of god
[47:56] let's say the process to become like
[47:58] jesus you see a lot of people
[48:00] want stuff but they don't want the
[48:02] process to get to that stuff
[48:04] if they want to get a certificate
[48:06] passing your exams you have to go
[48:08] through the process
[48:08] of studying your schoolwork because
[48:10] somebody's saying amen
[48:12] everything is a process people want a
[48:15] shortcut there is no shortcut
[48:17] oh glory to god give the lord a shout
[48:21] in this word there is no shortcut
[48:25] you come on god's level or you don't
[48:27] come at all
[48:28] my god we don't preach in the church we
[48:31] are preaching to the bride
[48:33] that's who i feel i'm preaching to this
[48:35] morning
[48:35] [Applause]
[48:40] oh hallelujah i
[48:43] feel there are mature people here ready
[48:45] to take the word and say
[48:46] pilate on me preacher pour it on
[48:50] hit me with it suck it to me
[48:53] give it to me loose it upon me
[48:57] that's what we want the word coming
[49:01] knocking out things that look like
[49:03] christ punching out things not like
[49:05] christ
[49:05] you're coming here for punches yes
[49:07] you're coming here to be cut
[49:09] you're coming out to be corrected you're
[49:10] committed to be instructed
[49:12] you don't come here to give advice
[49:14] you're not coming to teach the preacher
[49:16] you're not coming to come and play god
[49:17] in this church no
[49:19] no you're not coming for that all
[49:21] scripture is given by inspiration
[49:24] and it's profitable for doctrine reproof
[49:26] instructions
[49:28] that's what we're here for we have not
[49:31] been this way before
[49:32] but our fire is here leading us
[49:35] guiding us that's why we are so inspired
[49:38] because there's a fire that is here
[49:40] oh glory to god and as we move closer
[49:42] trials will move hotter
[49:44] that's what the devil does as you're
[49:46] narrowing your portion
[49:47] the devil is mad because he could never
[49:49] take your place
[49:50] he could never receive the holy ghost
[49:52] and he knows something is about to break
[49:54] forth
[49:55] we could sense it we could feel it we
[49:57] are inspired by the expectation
[50:00] of it something is about to break forth
[50:03] or a short quick message
[50:05] that could just shake the whole nation

[53:16] word of commission
[53:17] you to be perfected it means god
[53:20] must elect a bunch of men not
[53:23] man chosen man but god
[53:27] god man
[53:29] [Applause]
[53:35] but i want to bring another deeper i
[53:38] want to show you
[53:39] that the faithful ministry will be
[53:41] adopted sons
[53:45] [Applause]
[53:48] not hoping to make it
[53:51] somebody may say i hope these words
[53:53] bless your heart
[53:55] this is not that and you know i mean i
[53:58] i already prepared nothing you know but
[53:59] i hope no no not that
[54:02] we're talking about men that's speaking
[54:04] as the oracles of god
[54:06] men that has been in this presence men
[54:09] that heard from heaven
[54:11] men that have been in the presence of
[54:13] the pillar of fire
[54:15] and know that god is god that's what
[54:18] we're talking about because
[54:19] in the last days we have promised that
[54:22] the pride will be the final voice
[54:24] to the final age and he said once more
[54:27] the world will hear direct from god
[54:31] when last the word here direct from god
[54:33] when god said malachi
[54:35] 4. but sodom and luke 17 30
[54:38] the world was airing direct from god but
[54:41] he prophesied
[54:42] that the bride who is she she is still
[54:45] being called out
[54:48] because the bride have to have character
[54:50] the bride has to be flesh of his flesh
[54:52] bone of his bone spirit of his spirit
[54:55] therefore the bride
[54:56] must go through the process of corrupted
[54:59] development
[55:00] come on give the lord a shout of prayer
[55:02] therefore the bride
[55:04] must come to her place of trying
[55:07] [Applause]
[55:18] you see you can't just say but
[55:21] the pasta you know he going through his
[55:22] stuff yeah that's his place
[55:26] of trying pasta not going through your
[55:28] place of trying for you
[55:30] i know you want to preach sometimes that
[55:33] could do some interceding
[55:34] which is praying that's the easy part
[55:36] but when you talk about police are
[55:37] trying that's your place
[55:39] nobody can't go through that nobody can
[55:40] sign that up for you you know i'm going
[55:42] to take my husband please for of trying
[55:43] no
[55:44] it doesn't work that way
[55:48] is the trial of your faith not
[55:51] all your faith
[55:54] your your faith
[55:58] so when you're looking to lean on
[56:00] somebody you see all them who talking
[56:01] and hiding and
[56:02] bobbing and weaving and they're ducking
[56:04] behind this one because they think it's
[56:05] our fate is it
[56:06] no your fate he said i came to deliver
[56:11] the fate
[56:12] that was once delivered to the saints
[56:13] you see the faith is what led peter to
[56:15] do what he did
[56:17] their faith is what that people say
[56:18] silver and gold having none such that
[56:20] that was the fate this faith said philip
[56:23] to the ethiopian unit the faith did that
[56:25] isn't that right the faith in what was
[56:27] leading these guys
[56:28] because they are sons not chicken sons
[56:34] they were eager in them i think together
[56:37] that was better with eagles
[56:38] you see chickens have mother hen and
[56:41] manchester brooding and
[56:42] eagles different as soon as their age
[56:44] mother just flicked them out and
[56:46] you'll get them uncomfortable in their
[56:48] nests because everybody have a cool
[56:50] comfort spot in mother's nest and
[56:53] and they don't know yet they're not born
[56:55] to sit on a nest
[56:57] they were born to fly they don't even
[56:59] know the purpose of their wings
[57:00] they don't know their potential yet they
[57:03] only under mummy because mommy flies out
[57:05] and bring back food for them mommy flies
[57:08] out
[57:08] and see them mommy fires out and brings
[57:11] stuff for them
[57:12] but after a while they get too big for
[57:14] the nest it begins to get
[57:16] uncomfortable and the mommy begins to
[57:17] rip off what was smooth and what was
[57:20] necessary when they were small
[57:22] until the sticks that was under all
[57:24] those smooth stuff begin to stick them
[57:26] up
[57:27] and begin to give them a very
[57:28] uncomfortable trying situation in which
[57:31] they find a cell can lie down this way
[57:33] because this thing pushing them here
[57:35] they can't take it easy here they're
[57:37] being sticked up the mommy is groundly
[57:39] trying to phase them out
[57:40] from phase two to phase three because
[57:43] for extremes they have that fly
[57:46] come on see him and somebody so first
[57:48] you make it sticky in the nest
[57:50] make it uncomfortable and i hope god do
[57:53] that
[57:54] for you today make things so
[57:56] uncomfortable
[57:57] you feel we stick in here you're
[57:59] sticking here you don't even know if you
[58:00] want to come back to the church that's
[58:02] fine that's
[58:02] okay that's what we just want pride
[58:04] members inside of here
[58:05] we want the church members they could go
[58:08] bye-bye
[58:10] but the bride she wants the word she
[58:12] wants god
[58:13] she wants the word to become flesh
[58:18] come on say him and somebody oh
[58:21] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory
[58:25] because you know it's the same beat the
[58:26] same way this until
[58:28] something external happens so the
[58:30] morning the mother decides
[58:32] to get them fellas a solo flight tell
[58:34] them jump in my wings
[58:36] and they hook their beaks into them
[58:37] break my eagle wings and the mother take
[58:39] my fly
[58:40] man that feeling good they're feeling
[58:42] their merry-go-round
[58:43] they feel that on them things go up and
[58:45] down so and the mother just doing like
[58:47] that
[58:48] and they're feeling good maybe she did
[58:49] that and clearly straight back to the
[58:50] nurse
[58:51] they said mommy are we having a
[58:52] wonderland again tomorrow she said sure
[58:54] son
[58:55] show children another one tomorrow and
[58:58] she get another one tomorrow are we

[59:02] something different when she flies she
[59:04] flipped them off

[59:07] very strange

[59:14] up for for christianity
[59:15] fine like i'm dying who would help me

[59:51] time
[59:52] when you flick them up you better fly or
[59:54] die

[59:59] we are going to go on
[1:00:00] to perfection we will cook the chicken
[1:00:03] because you can't cook eagles
[1:00:05] but we gonna go on to perfection come on

[1:06:07] of the spirit all the world blinking

[1:06:11] and you're trying to hold your eyes
[1:06:12] together and it's this you're hearing

[1:06:15] trying to walk
[1:06:16] through this narrow road praise god and

[1:06:42] glory hallelujah
[1:06:47] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:06:50] glory to god so god
[1:06:54] put an original seed into the ground
[1:06:57] and that seed began to unfold now here
[1:06:59] what happened
[1:07:00] notice the life that was in the stalk
[1:07:03] the tassel
[1:07:04] ends up in the seed the light that come
[1:07:06] on the original seed
[1:07:08] come to different processes and then
[1:07:11] turn
[1:07:11] back there we go to its original
[1:07:13] condition so when the life
[1:07:15] begins to unfold through the stalk
[1:07:17] through the leaves to the tassel
[1:07:19] it comes back against the seed then the
[1:07:22] life gathers all the seeds gathers up
[1:07:24] all the life
[1:07:25] then everything else dries up so when
[1:07:27] you begin to see others just drying up
[1:07:29] that's not you
[1:07:31] you're not drying up you getting ripened
[1:07:33] up you're getting mature
[1:07:36] you're getting to be perfect oh
[1:07:39] hallelujah oh glory notice
[1:07:42] this is the bomb the life that was in
[1:07:44] the store husk
[1:07:46] in the tassel gathers up in the seed the
[1:07:48] life
[1:07:49] that was in the stalk went to make
[1:07:51] another
[1:07:52] justification made away for
[1:07:54] signification san sanification
[1:07:56] made away for the battle of the holy
[1:07:57] ghost and the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:08:00] made a way for the holy ghost itself to
[1:08:02] come down
[1:08:03] in perfection the holy ghost must come
[1:08:05] down in
[1:08:07] perfection therefore there is going to
[1:08:09] be a perfect people
[1:08:10] on the earth the holy ghost is going to
[1:08:13] come down
[1:08:14] in perfection and back to the word
[1:08:17] to manifest itself so brahman says when
[1:08:20] the green
[1:08:21] life begins to leave the husk
[1:08:24] and go to make the brain the bride
[1:08:27] he called the bride the grain
[1:08:30] the green cardinal itself so when the
[1:08:33] wood is thrown at you you can't say you
[1:08:34] do believe that
[1:08:35] you accept that when all these promises
[1:08:37] is flung at you you receive them
[1:08:40] because he said the green listen when
[1:08:42] the life
[1:08:43] begins to leave the hustle go into the
[1:08:45] green the bride the hearts
[1:08:47] open up and excommunicate the grain
[1:08:50] so this is part of the package ex
[1:08:52] communication
[1:08:54] how could brethren do me that do you
[1:08:57] they have to do you that
[1:08:59] because you are green and that's husk
[1:09:02] pulling back to give you room
[1:09:06] [Applause]
[1:09:08] [Music]
[1:09:11] [Applause]
[1:09:12] do you realize they were tightening you
[1:09:14] all along cramping you all along
[1:09:15] but when the hospital back you feel the
[1:09:18] dance like david
[1:09:20] dance you have the liberty you have the
[1:09:22] freedom you have the authority
[1:09:24] you have inspiration why because the
[1:09:26] hospital that
[1:09:28] they have to pull back because they can
[1:09:30] handle the grain
[1:09:31] the grain could only get right you see
[1:09:34] while
[1:09:34] it is not ready the grain is protected
[1:09:38] by the husk yes
[1:09:39] while it is young the husk is green
[1:09:42] and the grain is green but then goes on
[1:09:45] to increase the sun
[1:09:47] here place a trial trial of your faith
[1:09:52] that increase the test and as the sun
[1:09:54] get hotter
[1:09:55] the huts begin to go dry yellow but the
[1:09:58] grain
[1:09:58] starting to get ripe golden brown you
[1:10:01] call it
[1:10:02] golden brown it begins to get mature
[1:10:06] because it's getting ready to die the
[1:10:08] dynamic is going to drive the people to
[1:10:10] calvary
[1:10:11] and get into the rapture oh glory to god
[1:10:14] but you've got to become the grain
[1:10:17] that's why you come to church by these
[1:10:19] promises
[1:10:20] we become partakers of the divine nature
[1:10:24] you come to church to get promised after
[1:10:26] promise of the promise
[1:10:31] lord reader god didn't come to church
[1:10:34] for me to explain newsweek magazine
[1:10:36] and thai magazine on an article in in
[1:10:39] in some science magazine that's not what
[1:10:41] you come to church for
[1:10:42] they come to church and your promises
[1:10:45] god promised you the holy ghost
[1:10:46] god promised you deliverance god
[1:10:48] promised you family
[1:10:49] god promised you a breakthrough you come
[1:10:51] to your promises
[1:10:53] and your faith has taken a hold of these
[1:10:56] promises
[1:10:57] my god you could take them and say god
[1:10:59] you said so
[1:11:00] you can't lie
[1:11:02] [Applause]
[1:11:05] amen
[1:11:06] [Applause]
[1:11:09] my lord and when the seed word begins to
[1:11:13] go forward
[1:11:14] the husk puts it from itself
[1:11:17] here we go ready for this the life
[1:11:21] leaves all the others to follow it and
[1:11:25] that's the true believers
[1:11:26] they follow the life wherever their life
[1:11:28] goes
[1:11:31] not interpretation not more mysteries
[1:11:35] the life related yes for the life
[1:11:38] southern angels give him eternity to
[1:11:40] guard up this cattle world to tie it
[1:11:41] back into the world to bring longer life
[1:11:44] which was the holy ghost itself and the
[1:11:46] holy ghost came down
[1:11:47] but he couldn't give us the holy ghost
[1:11:49] it came as the word
[1:11:51] because the mystery of god come down
[1:11:53] from god as the word
[1:11:54] and the word is a seed and the seed has
[1:11:57] to be preached
[1:11:58] [Applause]
[1:12:05] that's why the devil didn't understand
[1:12:08] the mystery of god because the mystery
[1:12:12] is
[1:12:12] or the secret is the word is in the
[1:12:15] brain
[1:12:16] devil didn't understand that he didn't
[1:12:18] understand the word wasn't in your
[1:12:20] spirit
[1:12:20] or your flesh yet it was in your soul
[1:12:23] you had a gene inside a deer
[1:12:25] and because you were covered up by the
[1:12:27] shock of your spirit
[1:12:29] by the shock of your flesh but the seed
[1:12:31] of the attribute
[1:12:33] of who you are was inside your soul
[1:12:36] so the shock could have done this
[1:12:38] adultery and fornication and lie
[1:12:39] that has nothing with the seed the
[1:12:41] mystery that was inside the deer
[1:12:43] now the mystery was how to connect what
[1:12:45] was in your soul
[1:12:47] to what god spoke because elohim is
[1:12:49] thought
[1:12:50] logos is word word is taught express
[1:12:53] and once the word is spoken the word
[1:12:55] become the conductor
[1:12:56] of the spirit to make it come to pass so
[1:12:59] once god thinks it
[1:13:00] and he speaks it and the spirit flows
[1:13:02] through it it's got to come to prayer
[1:13:05] [Music]
[1:13:08] glory glory
[1:13:12] glory are you with me
[1:13:15] are you with me so watch god say let
[1:13:17] there be light
[1:13:18] hallelujah god created and he said he
[1:13:21] said there was darkness
[1:13:22] and the spirit begin to move you see
[1:13:24] because the word
[1:13:26] has to be spoken for the spirit to begin
[1:13:28] to move
[1:13:29] because the word is the conductor of the
[1:13:31] spirit so god has to restore
[1:13:33] the conductor of the spirit which is the
[1:13:35] word and once the word is restored
[1:13:38] the spirit can now move so when the sons
[1:13:41] become the word
[1:13:42] the sons become the conductor and the
[1:13:44] spirit begins to move
[1:13:46] to the sons of god the last days there
[1:13:49] is
[1:13:49] my spirit flowing freely
[1:13:52] [Applause]
[1:14:05] you are sealed i see your shoes on both
[1:14:08] sides
[1:14:09] whether you're going to come in they see
[1:14:11] the reel just the same
[1:14:13] when a man or woman possesses this all
[1:14:15] these virtues here
[1:14:17] then the capstone comes down
[1:14:20] and seals them into the kingdom of god
[1:14:23] which is the holy ghost
[1:14:25] then the word manifests itself
[1:14:28] that makes it a complete tabernacle of
[1:14:30] the living god
[1:14:31] hallelujah my then you become
[1:14:34] watch a living example of christianity
[1:14:38] what christ was these people are
[1:14:41] because his life is in there they are in
[1:14:44] christ
[1:14:44] and their life is dead and then you
[1:14:47] reckon yourself dead
[1:14:49] then you're born of fate then virtue
[1:14:52] and these are the things that added tell
[1:14:53] you a perfect living image
[1:14:56] of god isn't that right and it's not
[1:14:59] wonderful
[1:15:00] god has brought seven church ages to
[1:15:03] show seven steps
[1:15:04] he brought building this individual into
[1:15:06] his image he built a complete church in
[1:15:08] his image
[1:15:09] and at the resurrection this complete
[1:15:11] body will be raised up
[1:15:13] to live with him forever because it's a
[1:15:15] bride
[1:15:16] just remember we are not the only bride
[1:15:18] we are the capstone bride
[1:15:20] the bride has been formed throughout the
[1:15:22] ages it's already filled
[1:15:24] up so we can't go back to luta we can't
[1:15:26] fit into wesley
[1:15:27] we can't fit in any past age we have to
[1:15:29] fit in our age
[1:15:30] we have to fit in the magnetism of the
[1:15:32] holy ghost to pull the rest of them up
[1:15:34] so we are the capstone that the holy
[1:15:37] ghost itself
[1:15:38] could come down as that power magnet to
[1:15:41] raise them from the grave
[1:15:43] in other words we've got to come to
[1:15:44] perfection in order to produce a
[1:15:46] resurrection
[1:15:47] isn't that right you are going to be
[1:15:50] perfect
[1:15:51] you've got to press onto perfection
[1:15:53] perfection is our goal
[1:15:55] isn't that right oh glory to god
[1:15:58] what more shall we say to these things
[1:16:00] hebrews 11 oh
[1:16:01] true faith subdued kingdoms brought
[1:16:04] righteousness
[1:16:04] there was stone sword asunder is not
[1:16:06] right having a good report through faith
[1:16:09] god provides some things better for us
[1:16:11] they without us
[1:16:12] are not made perfect so they need us to
[1:16:15] complete them
[1:16:16] oh glory to god do you understand what
[1:16:18] i'm saying they need
[1:16:20] us to complete them to bring up the
[1:16:22] whole body
[1:16:23] that's the responsibility that's been
[1:16:26] given this last day church
[1:16:27] we are not a church to produce another
[1:16:29] church we are church to raise the dead
[1:16:32] to tell me a resurrection come on say
[1:16:34] him and somebody
[1:16:36] are you with me oh hallelujah
[1:16:40] you get it you must be seated here we go
[1:16:43] oh glory
[1:16:44] these people who died
[1:16:55] [Applause]
[1:16:57] let me bring it real to you if i die
[1:17:00] i'll be written on you
[1:17:04] don't keep him written long enough
[1:17:08] hallelujah in other words you have got
[1:17:11] to come to perfection
[1:17:17] let's go these people who die are
[1:17:20] dependent on waiting on us
[1:17:22] here we go look my own ways so this
[1:17:24] church has
[1:17:25] got to come to perfection in order to
[1:17:28] bring the resurrection
[1:17:30] they are souls under the altar waiting
[1:17:33] for this church
[1:17:34] to come to its perfection and this
[1:17:37] church
[1:17:38] is is coming smaller in the minority
[1:17:40] watch it's come to a needle point
[1:17:42] we have got to get into a place here we
[1:17:45] go until
[1:17:46] it's the same kind of ministry that was
[1:17:48] left
[1:17:51] because when the headstone come it can't
[1:17:53] come and connect the brotherly kindness
[1:17:55] there
[1:17:55] it has to come and that holy spirit
[1:17:58] is where the ministry of the bride gonna
[1:18:00] be at
[1:18:01] it's gonna be a holy spirit ministry
[1:18:03] because the spirit christ have to
[1:18:05] connect with that isn't that right
[1:18:07] are you with me now blessed be the name
[1:18:09] of the lord so you say when the pyramid
[1:18:11] cap does come
[1:18:12] the pyramid itself the body of christ
[1:18:13] will have to be honed
[1:18:16] that's a different word that delivered
[1:18:19] metal work
[1:18:20] according to a sharp point milliliter i
[1:18:23] forget all them skills we see this long
[1:18:24] time
[1:18:25] uh caliper caliper sometimes you grab
[1:18:28] fat and ground tin
[1:18:29] another adjusted caliper because you
[1:18:30] have to get it this fraction
[1:18:32] so you have to hone that go through a
[1:18:35] process of honing
[1:18:36] wholeness possession you're just
[1:18:37] chopping you know a whole nother
[1:18:40] [Music]
[1:18:53] so if i say i'm not affecting you much
[1:18:55] is when you're writing gonna come
[1:18:57] this is what we're talking about the
[1:18:59] real thing going to come
[1:19:01] that's just still microphone stuff don't

[1:19:21] hallelujah so therefore it has to be so
[1:19:24] perfect like christ till when it comes
[1:19:27] he and that
[1:19:28] ministry will fit smack together
[1:19:31] then will the rapture come amen

[1:21:03] [Applause]
[1:21:06] so indeed called the deep woman coming
[1:21:08] up and the woman just doing but he said
[1:21:09] that just his presence

[1:21:46] epistles
[1:21:47] that have been written and peter and
[1:21:50] john to show it
[1:21:51] when they went up there they perceived
[1:21:53] they were ignorant and unlearned
[1:21:54] they had no education but they take
[1:21:56] notice that they've been with jesus
[1:21:58] they were ignorant and unlearned but
[1:22:01] they were
[1:22:01] written epistles read that they had been
[1:22:05] with jesus
[1:22:06] cause here we go jesus was
[1:22:09] manifesting himself through them christ
[1:22:13] veiled in their flesh manifested
[1:22:17] made alive as was in moses oh hallelujah
[1:22:21] christ
[1:22:22] veiled manifested in them he said now
[1:22:25] watch
[1:22:26] that's the thing god will do to his sons
[1:22:27] on earth someday he will call you a side
[1:22:29] church
[1:22:30] if you'll only obey him and stay on the
[1:22:32] word and believe it
[1:22:33] he will place into the church before the
[1:22:35] coming of jesus christ he replaced
[1:22:37] to the church all the powers that christ
[1:22:38] had in him will be in the church
[1:22:41] all that god was he poured into jesus
[1:22:43] all that jesus was he pours into the
[1:22:44] church
[1:22:45] god wanted his work done he sent it to
[1:22:47] his son the son wanted his work done
[1:22:49] sent into the church at that day you
[1:22:52] will know i am in the father
[1:22:53] the father me and you and me and i knew
[1:22:55] at that day because
[1:22:56] here we go the same power of god was the
[1:22:59] jehovah god
[1:23:00] rest in jesus christ and the same power
[1:23:03] that
[1:23:03] rest in jesus christ rest in placed
[1:23:07] sons in the body of christ not
[1:23:10] place son's place in conventions
[1:23:13] place sons in the body
[1:23:16] now no man could put you in the body it
[1:23:19] by one spirit you are baptized into the
[1:23:21] body
[1:23:22] isn't that right so the holy ghost puts
[1:23:24] you into the body and in that body you
[1:23:26] have a position
[1:23:31] are you with me oh hallelujah the pillar
[1:23:34] of fire
[1:23:34] is identified scientifically by the
[1:23:36] reaction by its character
[1:23:38] and everything else and as it was when
[1:23:40] it was dwelling the body of god's only
[1:23:42] begotten son
[1:23:42] so that it dwell in the body of his
[1:23:45] adopted sons
[1:23:46] for the last day let's read back the
[1:23:49] scripture we read
[1:23:50] how highly god regardless of working of
[1:23:52] patience is seen in james 1 4
[1:23:54] let patients have a perfect work that
[1:23:56] you may be perfect an entire lack of
[1:23:57] nothing
[1:23:58] god's will for us is perfection that's
[1:24:00] his will
[1:24:01] that's his will that's why jezebel for
[1:24:04] perfect
[1:24:05] he put that promise upon the pedia for
[1:24:06] perfect are you only perfect except
[1:24:08] there are seven perfect spirits
[1:24:10] to be loosed on the earth to wrap you up
[1:24:11] in it is dumb spirits come from god to
[1:24:14] bring you back to perfection
[1:24:15] remember the working in the beginning
[1:24:18] but the seven perfect was before the
[1:24:19] beginning
[1:24:20] that's where our gene took a hold before
[1:24:23] the beginning
[1:24:24] lucifer only come in the beginning
[1:24:29] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:24:31] word said let there be angels let there
[1:24:32] be this let there be that let there be
[1:24:34] lucy
[1:24:39] are you with me but before the beginning
[1:24:41] was spirit
[1:24:42] taught that we were connected to him
[1:24:45] so before the devil was created we were
[1:24:49] [Applause]
[1:24:54] oh glory to god amen
[1:24:56] [Music]
[1:24:57] okay let's go hebrews 2 9.
[1:25:02] we see jesus who has been a little lower
[1:25:04] than the angels
[1:25:06] for the suffering of death crowned with
[1:25:07] glory and honor
[1:25:09] and he by the grace of god should take
[1:25:12] debt for every man for it became him
[1:25:15] for whom are all things and by whom are
[1:25:17] all things in bringing
[1:25:19] many sons unto glory to make
[1:25:22] the captain of their salvation perfect
[1:25:26] true suffering
[1:25:30] that's jesus perfect to suffering
[1:25:34] hebrews 5 8-9 though he was son
[1:25:38] yet learn the obedience
[1:25:42] so sorry i'm not so sorry it'll be
[1:25:44] another gift
[1:25:49] you're not saying no no you have to
[1:25:51] learn obedience
[1:25:52] but here it is he learned
[1:25:56] obedience by the things which he
[1:25:59] suffered
[1:26:03] [Music]
[1:26:04] oh now the babies the baby's feeling
[1:26:07] uncomfortable right now
[1:26:12] and being made perfect he became the
[1:26:16] order
[1:26:16] of eternal salvation unto all them that
[1:26:19] obey him
[1:26:20] first peter 5 10 but the god of all
[1:26:23] grace
[1:26:24] who had called us to his eternal glory
[1:26:27] by christ jesus
[1:26:28] after you have suffered a while make you
[1:26:31] perfect
[1:26:33] establish strengthen
[1:26:36] settle you okay with the lord of praise
[1:26:45] [Applause]
[1:26:46] we pray for the course of the word and
[1:26:48] god has a set time and has a purpose for
[1:26:50] everything that he does
[1:26:51] there's nothing happen just accidentally
[1:26:53] to those who love the lord
[1:26:54] and accord according to his will isn't
[1:26:56] that right we are predestinated and
[1:26:58] everything works just right for that
[1:27:00] because he cannot lie and everything has
[1:27:02] its time
[1:27:04] it's season it has its way god is behind
[1:27:07] every move
[1:27:09] and sometimes you think that everything
[1:27:12] is going wrong
[1:27:13] it's up to us here we go those things
[1:27:16] are put upon us trials
[1:27:19] and wonderings it is testing to see
[1:27:24] how you will react on an action
[1:27:28] god by putting trials destined and
[1:27:31] wanderings
[1:27:32] to see how you were to fear how you
[1:27:35] gonna
[1:27:35] make out because he's looking for a
[1:27:37] reaction from you
[1:27:39] based upon the situations that is
[1:27:42] surrounding
[1:27:43] your life are you with me no matter
[1:27:46] if you notice she has made herself ready
[1:27:48] so many says if the lord will take his
[1:27:50] evil spirit from me
[1:27:51] from drinking from gambling from lying
[1:27:53] stealing i'll serve him
[1:27:55] that's up to you you have got something
[1:27:57] to do david overcome shall inherit all
[1:27:59] things
[1:28:00] they didn't overcome you have power
[1:28:03] to do it but you must be willing to lay
[1:28:05] it down she has made herself ready
[1:28:08] you see god could not push us through a
[1:28:10] pipe
[1:28:11] and pull us on the other end and say
[1:28:13] blessed that he will overcome it
[1:28:14] you have nothing to overcome he just
[1:28:16] pushed you through but you have got to
[1:28:18] make decisions yourself
[1:28:20] i had to make a decision myself and in
[1:28:23] doing that
[1:28:24] we show our faith and respects to god
[1:28:27] could we say amen
[1:28:29] are you with me so therefore the choices
[1:28:31] is yours
[1:28:32] you are the decision if you're going to
[1:28:33] come to church this morning and you have
[1:28:35] a decision this morning
[1:28:36] if you're going to stay alive to hear
[1:28:38] the word of worship or praise god i
[1:28:40] receive it
[1:28:40] because we are going to go on to
[1:28:42] perfection
[1:28:44] there's going to be a bunch of people in
[1:28:45] here that are going to press on
[1:28:47] the perfection could we take some more
[1:28:50] it's early and i'm all getting warmed up
[1:28:54] hallelujah glory glory glory
[1:28:57] no watch abraham was promised a child
[1:29:00] amen
[1:29:02] but he must maintain that promise for 25
[1:29:06] years
[1:29:07] promise maintenance
[1:29:11] promise given and god checking you how
[1:29:13] how you're maintaining that promise
[1:29:15] or you're disbelieving the promise or
[1:29:17] you're grumbling about the promise or
[1:29:19] you're complaining why it seems so long
[1:29:21] and you alter the spirit with the
[1:29:22] promise no maintenance he had to
[1:29:24] maintain it
[1:29:25] listen the ups and downs that he had

[1:33:45] a chaplain is there for you i come back
[1:33:48] to about a friend went to church at
[1:33:49] night
[1:33:50] and known to the people next night it
[1:33:51] happened standing there he told me
[1:33:54] upon some muckers it's in your hands do
[1:33:55] with them whatever you happen
[1:33:58] a young man and young woman they're
[1:34:00] trying to make vulgar love with her in
[1:34:01] the building
[1:34:03] everybody attention while i was trying
[1:34:06] to preach
[1:34:07] this is in the church building in the
[1:34:09] building now then people carry on in the
[1:34:10] building
[1:34:12] you notice they say come in
[1:34:18] in that kind of a way people are
[1:34:19] treating people out you know but this
[1:34:20] would happen right
[1:34:22] and he was pull ahead back climb up onto
[1:34:23] our lap throw our head back trying to
[1:34:25] kiss her going on that
[1:34:27] and baron beg them stop it please stop
[1:34:28] the police all of a sudden the holy
[1:34:30] spirit dropped down and says he's there
[1:34:31] in your hands
[1:34:33] what will you do with them there was a
[1:34:36] holy hush
[1:34:38] everybody said deathly quiet i thought
[1:34:40] oh god what must i do
[1:34:42] so he's under pressure now what do i do
[1:34:44] this is a situation
[1:34:46] what do i do then i remember
[1:34:49] the warning of the holy spirit two days
[1:34:51] before and i said
[1:34:53] i forgive you
[1:35:00] now now i want you to go a little deeper
[1:35:02] in this
[1:35:03] the holy spirit if they say blind
[1:35:05] they'll be blind if he said that they
[1:35:06] will die
[1:35:08] whatever you say is going to happen and
[1:35:10] he listen to all the options given to
[1:35:12] him
[1:35:13] anibal he said i
[1:35:16] forgive you now he didn't have to say
[1:35:17] that he said that
[1:35:20] i'll show you who i am but he said
[1:35:24] i forgive you and that pleased god
[1:35:28] and that is what he wanted me to say
[1:35:31] because
[1:35:32] here we go after all i've been guilty
[1:35:35] maybe not of that but i have been guilty
[1:35:39] and guilty of the lease is guilty of the
[1:35:42] whole
[1:35:43] so you do have to place self-righteous
[1:35:45] you'd have to play more spiritual
[1:35:47] you'd have to play you more holy than
[1:35:49] somebody else
[1:35:52] so cut it out
[1:35:57] cut it out you'd have to play more
[1:36:00] legalistic than
[1:36:01] somebody else cut it out because we're
[1:36:04] rejecting that
[1:36:06] this is the word god forgive me he could
[1:36:10] forgive you
[1:36:11] and if he could forgive you he could
[1:36:12] forgive me too
[1:36:14] oh give the lord praise
[1:36:17] [Applause]
[1:36:21] watch then the holy spirit fell through
[1:36:25] amen you see here we go this is what i
[1:36:28] want to get
[1:36:29] i believe that all these things had a
[1:36:32] meaning
[1:36:33] what would you do with the power
[1:36:37] the reaction of an action sometimes
[1:36:39] something that is come as an
[1:36:41] act then how do you react do you
[1:36:43] understand what i mean
[1:36:45] so therefore the word has always been a
[1:36:48] reproach
[1:36:48] god's anointed word has all been
[1:36:50] reproached and that's the reason
[1:36:52] it's so hard for people who doesn't
[1:36:54] understand how to accept that reproach
[1:36:57] cover your knees everybody above the
[1:36:59] knees everybody have that
[1:37:00] you want to address that you don't want
[1:37:02] to reproach they call you old lady
[1:37:04] oh
[1:37:14] dress modestly that's a reproach it have
[1:37:17] sinners let us dress modestly
[1:37:21] [Applause]
[1:37:22] i want to repeat that it have sinful
[1:37:24] people that are dressed modestly
[1:37:28] women who respect themselves dressed
[1:37:31] modestly
[1:37:32] those who dress in crazy they don't
[1:37:33] respect themselves that's why it's a
[1:37:35] spirit upon them
[1:37:36] it's a sex spirit upon them that is why
[1:37:38] they dress the way they dress
[1:37:39] don't let that sex spirit come on you to
[1:37:41] dress that kind of way
[1:37:43] whether in church or out to church
[1:37:45] whether private no don't let that come
[1:37:46] upon you
[1:37:47] because this is the word this is god
[1:37:53] remember the devil is not playing people
[1:37:56] playing in church but the devil's not
[1:37:57] playing
[1:37:58] he come to steal to rob
[1:38:01] and to destroy at the end of it you
[1:38:04] ought to destroy your life
[1:38:06] so be careful oh hallelujah
[1:38:10] so you always have to stand this
[1:38:12] reproach in order to give a testing amen
[1:38:16] or that live godly in christ jesus shall
[1:38:18] bear persecution
[1:38:20] but hallelujah so what you're
[1:38:22] complaining about
[1:38:27] i'll be saying amen this is the word
[1:38:30] i'm going to do a call a lot i'll change
[1:38:33] a message i'm getting fire fire fire
[1:38:34] fire that was last week
[1:38:36] this is what i have for today this is

[1:38:53] that comes to christ must first be child
[1:38:54] trained

[1:48:58] on the underwood
[1:49:01] and when he had fasted 40 days and 40
[1:49:03] nights he was hungered
[1:49:06] that's terrible after
[1:49:10] he fasted the devil come to tempt him
[1:49:12] with
[1:49:13] some fresh bread
[1:49:17] i mean you could smell it
[1:49:20] when you're hungry like that so i mean
[1:49:21] you could eat anything
[1:49:25] and the devil said if thou be the son of
[1:49:28] god
[1:49:28] command that these stone be made bread
[1:49:31] and he answered and said is written
[1:49:33] man shall never bread alone but by every
[1:49:34] word but she does the more of god devil
[1:49:37] take up the high mountain
[1:49:38] holy city set him on a pinnacle of the
[1:49:41] temple and said
[1:49:42] if there will be the son of god cast
[1:49:43] myself down for it is written
[1:49:45] never going into the word now quoting
[1:49:46] through he using quotes
[1:49:48] he shall give his angels charged over
[1:49:49] considering thee and they have the same
[1:49:51] devil token he just quote him
[1:49:53] he shall give it in the charge
[1:49:54] concerning the and in their hands are
[1:49:55] they buried up at least
[1:49:58] any time though shall dodge their foot
[1:49:59] is it against a stone
[1:50:01] it's incredible how he just finds
[1:50:02] scriptures and come to go to jesus
[1:50:05] and jesus said it is written again thou
[1:50:08] shalt not attempt the lord thy god again
[1:50:10] the devil taken up
[1:50:11] exceeding high mountain showed him all
[1:50:13] the kingdom of the world and the glory
[1:50:15] of them and sending them all these
[1:50:16] things
[1:50:17] will i give thee if thou will fall on
[1:50:18] worship me then say jesus
[1:50:20] get the hand satan for it is written
[1:50:22] though shall not wish to be like god
[1:50:24] and him says then the devil leave him
[1:50:26] ambul
[1:50:27] angels came and ministered to him
[1:50:31] luke 4 14 and jesus returned in the
[1:50:34] power of the spirit on the galilee
[1:50:35] and they went out of fame of him
[1:50:37] throughout the region
[1:50:39] roundabout that captures the whole thing
[1:50:42] of the identifying the son a son placed
[1:50:46] by the holy spirit
[1:50:47] sent out into the wilderness to be
[1:50:48] tested and then return the power of the
[1:50:50] spirit
[1:50:51] so therefore the dove came on him and
[1:50:54] positioned him as a son
[1:50:56] him being positioned as a son was
[1:50:59] immediately led by the spirit
[1:51:01] into the wilderness to defeat the devil
[1:51:04] by the
[1:51:05] amen this is very important now no power
[1:51:08] yet
[1:51:10] but the word it is written it is written
[1:51:13] it is written so one spirit come upon
[1:51:16] him
[1:51:16] to identify him as a son isn't that
[1:51:18] right two
[1:51:20] the spirit led him into the wilderness
[1:51:22] where he used the word
[1:51:24] and that trial was jesus place of trying
[1:51:28] where he had to overcome himself
[1:51:31] lust of the eyes lust of the flesh
[1:51:34] pride of life so many ministers want to
[1:51:35] take power over the people
[1:51:37] poor lies forever churches and so on and
[1:51:40] you know really
[1:51:41] powerful men just like governments and
[1:51:42] prime ministers and presidents
[1:51:44] but they don't want to take the power
[1:51:46] over themselves but before
[1:51:48] a son could be really adopted he has to
[1:51:50] have power over himself
[1:51:52] before he could have power over others
[1:51:54] so jesus demonstrate this in the
[1:51:56] wilderness isn't that right
[1:51:57] led by the spirit then go into the
[1:52:00] wilderness to be tested to overcome the
[1:52:02] lust of the eyes
[1:52:03] lust of the flesh the pride of life
[1:52:05] isn't that right
[1:52:07] but about ask a question why would god
[1:52:09] call our people out in this evil age 4
[1:52:12] to try here i want you to say amen on
[1:52:17] that
[1:52:18] why this is some god what would god call
[1:52:21] of people out of this english for
[1:52:22] his name the reason is to try her the
[1:52:25] bride
[1:52:25] isn't that right blessed be the lord so
[1:52:28] after defeating the devil by
[1:52:30] the word tested proven isn't that right
[1:52:33] he returned in the power of the spirit
[1:52:35] showing
[1:52:36] that the spirit he received turned into
[1:52:38] word he went through the test by the
[1:52:40] word
[1:52:40] and then the word turned back into
[1:52:41] spirit he returned to the power of the
[1:52:43] spirit
[1:52:44] the spirit and the word is the same
[1:52:46] could we say amen
[1:52:47] oh glory to god the words that he speak
[1:52:49] they are spirit and they are life isn't
[1:52:51] that right
[1:52:52] so therefore we find out in the old
[1:52:54] testament caleb was the only one that
[1:52:55] driver the philistines
[1:52:57] the other tribes failed we don't want to
[1:52:59] be like that
[1:53:00] you don't want to be like that you want
[1:53:02] to be the tribe
[1:53:03] that overcome and drive out your
[1:53:05] philistines so you have to fight
[1:53:08] isn't that right because there is going
[1:53:09] to be a battle to possess your
[1:53:11] inheritance
[1:53:12] how many know the inheritance not just
[1:53:14] coming down you're going to fight
[1:53:16] for what you know is yours
[1:53:19] i say it again you're going to fight
[1:53:22] what has been revealed to you
[1:53:24] as yours
[1:53:28] that's different if it's not revealed to
[1:53:30] you you can't even claim it as yours
[1:53:32] but once it's revealed to you give me
[1:53:36] my mountain
[1:53:40] david mountain not hebrew mountain not
[1:53:42] this one mountain my own
[1:53:44] because god said that monk in his mind
[1:53:46] and when the spirit focuses on what is
[1:53:48] yours you get locked in
[1:53:50] amen hallelujah hallelujah
[1:53:54] so therefore there's going to be some
[1:53:55] sons that are going to be adopted all
[1:53:57] right let's go quickly now remember this
[1:53:58] from a guide these are the things that
[1:54:01] build a servant of christ
[1:54:03] for it first and virtue now remember
[1:54:05] here we go
[1:54:06] the holy spirit cannot cap the building
[1:54:09] of god
[1:54:10] until these things are operating by the
[1:54:13] spirit
[1:54:14] so these virtues have to be operated not
[1:54:17] by revelation
[1:54:18] well you know a brother come i i shall
[1:54:20] body cancer god bless you my brother
[1:54:22] know that
[1:54:23] that kind of makeup thing that
[1:54:25] artificial thing we do not want
[1:54:27] artificial other kinds that dry it up no
[1:54:28] for now
[1:54:29] depending upon who it is and what not
[1:54:30] that temporary kindness we're talking
[1:54:32] about operating by the spirit
[1:54:33] the spirit taking a hold of these
[1:54:35] virtues and bringing it alive
[1:54:38] so what could throw you in any situation
[1:54:40] anywhere
[1:54:41] in other words jesus busted his own
[1:54:43] disciples he said you have to have love
[1:54:44] more than the pharisees because they
[1:54:45] have loved their loved one budget too
[1:54:47] he said yeah that love who is not your
[1:54:48] own
[1:54:52] everybody is cool where they feel
[1:54:54] comfortable
[1:54:56] everybody is fine where they are
[1:54:58] comfortable but jesus said if you're in
[1:55:00] an uncomfortable situation you have to
[1:55:02] act right too
[1:55:03] you have to display it right also so for
[1:55:06] god to test you
[1:55:07] you know you had to get you outside the
[1:55:09] circle
[1:55:11] your speaker okay so no matter what you
[1:55:13] do
[1:55:14] these are the things that build the body
[1:55:16] of christ those things only long again
[1:55:18] but this is solid stuff first faith
[1:55:20] virtue knowledge
[1:55:21] is to be added until the company such a
[1:55:23] crisis is manifest
[1:55:25] then the holy spirit comes upon it and
[1:55:27] seizes one body
[1:55:29] ordination remember this morning lesson
[1:55:32] these virtues have to be in there
[1:55:34] before the caption will come on it you
[1:55:37] might shout you might speak in tongues
[1:55:38] that has nothing to do with it
[1:55:42] until these things are scripturally
[1:55:45] proven is sealed into you
[1:55:48] wait wait wait wait wait wait these
[1:55:51] things have to be
[1:55:52] scripturally proven
[1:55:57] so how god got tested by somebody who
[1:56:00] don't like you could do something to you
[1:56:04] in other words it has to come out
[1:56:05] automatically notice but iran didn't
[1:56:07] ramp up something and said what shall i
[1:56:09] do
[1:56:09] have i called for that um that that you
[1:56:12] know no he couldn't ramp up that it had
[1:56:14] to come from inside of him
[1:56:15] he said i forgive you that came out of
[1:56:18] him
[1:56:19] it is not right okay now out of your
[1:56:22] faith virtue
[1:56:22] knowledge temperance patience godliness
[1:56:25] brotherly kindness to your brother and
[1:56:26] his holy spirit
[1:56:27] and christ will come because just
[1:56:29] beneath him
[1:56:30] the holy spirit is the spirit of jesus
[1:56:33] christ
[1:56:34] into the church to manifest those
[1:56:36] virtues
[1:56:37] i pledge this morning to him with all my
[1:56:39] heart that by his help here we go
[1:56:41] and by his grace i pray i'll seek daily
[1:56:45] here we go church seek daily
[1:56:48] without ceasing until i feel every one
[1:56:50] of these requirements
[1:56:52] is fluent in this whole statute of mind
[1:56:54] delight can be a manifestation of the
[1:56:56] living christ
[1:56:56] for he became sin like me that i might
[1:56:59] become righteous of god like him
[1:57:01] he took my place lord let me take his
[1:57:03] now because that's the purpose he died
[1:57:05] for
[1:57:05] how many people pledge that same thing
[1:57:07] by the grace this morning
[1:57:09] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:57:12] o praise god so we are looking for the
[1:57:15] ministry of the spirit
[1:57:16] in ephesians that will come into
[1:57:18] ephesians to operate ephesians 4 11.
[1:57:21] a five-fold ministry that will bring the
[1:57:23] bride to perfection isn't that right
[1:57:25] because that is the brightest earthly
[1:57:27] goal to be a perfect man on the earth
[1:57:29] from barbarian paradox i've often wanted
[1:57:31] to come to church i've longed to see it
[1:57:33] where i could walk into the back door
[1:57:34] front door
[1:57:35] look across the audience and sin
[1:57:37] couldn't stay there the spirit would
[1:57:38] call it out
[1:57:39] it just couldn't stay like a nazi zafar
[1:57:42] you just couldn't do it
[1:57:43] there'd be no sin in that group no sir
[1:57:45] the spirit will quickly
[1:57:47] speak like that isn't that right it will
[1:57:49] be done woman and men coming on the
[1:57:50] power of the holy spirit
[1:57:52] the spirit of god moving perfectly if
[1:57:54] something gone wrong
[1:57:55] they will confess it before the spirit
[1:57:56] gotta hold it that's the church of the
[1:57:59] living god
[1:58:00] oh how my poor heart is getting old i've
[1:58:03] longed to stand to see a church like
[1:58:04] that
[1:58:05] i may yet i hope to perfect works of god
[1:58:08] without sin he looking for that he was
[1:58:11] expecting that and i believe with all my
[1:58:13] heart
[1:58:13] he's going to have that we're going to
[1:58:15] have that isn't that right jesus was the
[1:58:16] word isn't that right
[1:58:17] and the word was invisible until it was
[1:58:20] made flesh
[1:58:21] so now we're talking about the word and
[1:58:22] tapes the word on books that's just word
[1:58:24] word being spoken but that word have to
[1:58:26] come into your faith and your flesh
[1:58:28] and when the word become flesh it will
[1:58:30] become visible
[1:58:32] so no minister i have word made flesh
[1:58:34] and it's not visible
[1:58:36] it will become visible because the word
[1:58:38] conducts the spirit
[1:58:39] and the spirit will flow freely isn't
[1:58:41] that right
[1:58:43] god is ready if he's doing it now he's
[1:58:46] going to call a church to perfection
[1:58:48] by his word jesus christ if he's not
[1:58:50] doing it he will do it
[1:58:52] do what call a church to perfection oh
[1:58:55] hallelujah are you with me
[1:58:57] praise god blessed be the name of the
[1:58:59] lord
[1:59:00] you love him oh praise the name of the
[1:59:02] lord
[1:59:03] so the seed is back to its original
[1:59:05] condition it must have all the word
[1:59:08] to be the seed that's why sexiest could
[1:59:10] make it it have to be all seven seeds
[1:59:12] open
[1:59:12] it must be all the word to be the seed
[1:59:15] they can't united seven thunders because
[1:59:17] the seventh thing is kind of the bride
[1:59:18] the seven doesn't give the bright fate
[1:59:20] the seventh dinosaur about how we feel
[1:59:22] it must be all the world to be the seed
[1:59:24] so if they don't have all the word it's
[1:59:26] not the seed
[1:59:27] the prophet came to bring the seed from
[1:59:29] genesis all the way to revelation
[1:59:31] and that's the sea that's in you this
[1:59:32] morning oh glory to god do you believe
[1:59:35] that
[1:59:36] praise the name of the lord blessed be
[1:59:38] the name of the lord
[1:59:39] hallelujah hallelujah glory to the
[1:59:42] gospel brother
[1:59:43] okay so i believe okay let me see okay
[1:59:46] hallelujah
[1:59:50] i believe in the battle of holy ghost i
[1:59:52] believe in speaking in tongues
[1:59:53] he said you take a prisoner speak in
[1:59:54] tongues with enough timber to fight a
[1:59:56] bus so
[1:59:57] you talk about the holy ghost is
[1:59:58] meekness joy peace
[2:00:00] long suffering gentleness faith patience
[2:00:02] that's the fruit of the spirit
[2:00:03] humility if a brother has gone wrong
[2:00:05] don't beat him
[2:00:06] or something go after him see if you can
[2:00:09] get him back
[2:00:10] don't wait for the preacher to do it you
[2:00:12] do it
[2:00:13] the preacher can't do it all neither can
[2:00:15] the deacons everybody is a member of
[2:00:17] this body of christ
[2:00:18] should go after one another we have got
[2:00:20] the spirit of christ he taught a great
[2:00:21] parable he left the 99
[2:00:23] and went after one oh blessed be the
[2:00:26] name of the lord
[2:00:27] oh praise god musician come on please oh
[2:00:29] hallelujah
[2:00:30] oh are you ready brother branham said
[2:00:33] the flow shall be full of wheat the fats
[2:00:34] overflowing wine and oil
[2:00:35] and i'll restore now it says god is
[2:00:38] going to restore
[2:00:39] the lutheran age did not restore the
[2:00:41] church it started reformation
[2:00:42] the wesleyan age didn't restore the
[2:00:44] pentecostal it didn't restore but god
[2:00:46] has to restore
[2:00:48] because he can't deny his word this is
[2:00:50] not the resurrection of the church
[2:00:52] it is the restoration of god god will
[2:00:55] take the church
[2:00:56] right back to pentecost at the beginning
[2:00:59] notice in verse 25
[2:01:00] it tells why we need a restoration the
[2:01:02] locust the pramaum the caterpillar the
[2:01:05] palmerwoom have eaten
[2:01:06] all but the root a little bit of the
[2:01:08] stem now we are told all these insects
[2:01:10] are one of the same
[2:01:12] stages that's right they are the
[2:01:13] antichrist spirit
[2:01:15] manifested in organization denomination
[2:01:18] and false doctrine
[2:01:19] through the ages and the pauline roots
[2:01:21] talk is going to be restored
[2:01:23] god isn't going to plant a new church
[2:01:25] but going to bring
[2:01:27] his original planting back to original
[2:01:30] seed
[2:01:30] he is doing it as stated in verse 23 by
[2:01:33] the teaching
[2:01:34] or for marine how he's bringing it back
[2:01:36] by the teaching
[2:01:38] of marine next will come the harvest
