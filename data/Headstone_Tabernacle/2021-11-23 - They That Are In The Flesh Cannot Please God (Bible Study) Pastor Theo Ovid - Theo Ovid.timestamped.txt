[12:05] we forget that we forget that this is
[12:08] not where we belong we're just passing
[12:11] true father
[12:12] john said he saw a new heaven
[12:15] and a new earth
[12:16] and that is what we're going to come

[12:40] tonight
[12:41] uh to be with us as we want to share
[12:44] the word of god i trust in that
[12:47] uh the couple of messages and bible
[12:49] studies have been edified and helpful to
[12:51] you
[12:52] i believe the last thing we spoke in
[12:54] bible study was about a glorious church
[12:57] without spot or wrinkle
[12:59] and this is god's vision of the church
[13:02] nothing less than that
[13:03] he is going to have
[13:05] a glorious church
[13:07] lord's puerto rican i was wondering
[13:09] you know
[13:10] what to follow and up after that because
[13:12] that was
[13:14] speaking about this church this bride
[13:16] this
[13:16] uh this just what what what is called
[13:20] female in designation the bride of jesus
[13:23] christ
[13:24] and we give some old testament
[13:27] references to
[13:28] what god sees as a woman as a bride as a
[13:31] wife and everything else
[13:33] but tonight we want to go into the new
[13:35] testament we're going to see the new
[13:36] testament tonight
[13:38] and we want to zero in on the individual
[13:42] the people who
[13:44] want to be
[13:45] part of that bright body who are
[13:47] interested in being that part of the
[13:49] pride body who want to get rid of what
[13:51] they in
[13:52] this is for you tonight it's not
[13:54] a general
[13:55] thing it's specific very specific
[13:58] and you will be instructed by the
[14:01] scriptures tonight
[14:03] i don't even have to say much but the
[14:05] scriptures that would speak to itself
[14:07] so tonight we want to go straight into
[14:10] uh what we have to share
[14:12] i'd like you to turn your bibles to
[14:13] romans chapter eight
[14:15] you want to read
[14:16] verse 1 to 10
[14:18] romans chapter 8
[14:20] familiar scripture
[14:22] verse 1.
[14:36] could you just actually excuse me one
[14:38] second please
[14:59] okay
[15:01] there is therefore now no condemnation
[15:03] to them which in christ jesus
[15:05] who walk not after the flesh
[15:07] but after the spirit
[15:09] for the law of the spirit of life
[15:12] in christ jesus
[15:14] had made me free from the law of sin and
[15:16] death
[15:17] for what the law could not do
[15:19] in that it was weak to the flesh
[15:21] god
[15:22] sending his own son
[15:24] in the likeness of sinful flesh and for
[15:26] sin
[15:28] condemns sin in the flesh
[15:30] that the righteousness of the lord might
[15:32] be fulfilling us
[15:33] who walk not after the flesh
[15:36] but after the spirit
[15:38] now that verse was for
[15:41] the righteousness of the law
[15:43] might be fulfilling us who walk not
[15:44] after the flesh but after the spirit
[15:46] and the amplified it says so that the
[15:48] righteous and just requirement
[15:51] of the law
[15:53] might be fully met in us
[15:55] who live and move
[15:58] not in the ways of the flesh
[16:00] but in the ways of the spirit our lives
[16:04] governed
[16:05] not by the standards and according to
[16:09] the details of the flesh
[16:11] but controlled by the holy spirit
[16:13] verse 5
[16:14] for they
[16:16] that are after the flesh
[16:18] to mind the things of the flesh
[16:21] but they that are after the spirit
[16:24] the things of the spirit
[16:26] so it have to they dear
[16:29] they who after the flesh
[16:31] and they who are after the spirit
[16:34] and the amplified it expresses this this
[16:36] way
[16:37] for those
[16:39] who are according to the flesh
[16:41] are controlled by its unholy desires set
[16:45] their minds on
[16:47] and pursue those things which gratify
[16:51] the flesh but those who
[16:53] are according to the spirit are
[16:55] controlled
[16:56] by the desires of the spirit set their
[16:59] minds on
[17:00] and seek those things which gratify
[17:03] the holy spirit
[17:05] verse 6
[17:06] for to be carnally minded is death
[17:10] but to be spiritually binded is life
[17:13] and peace
[17:14] amplified expresses that now the mind of
[17:17] the flesh which is sense and reason
[17:20] without the holy spirit is dead
[17:23] death
[17:24] that comprises all the miseries arising
[17:26] from sin both here and hereafter
[17:28] but the mind of the holy spirit is life
[17:32] and soul peace but now and forever
[17:36] seven
[17:37] because the carnal mind is enmity
[17:39] against god or like an enemy of god
[17:41] for it is not subject to the law of god
[17:45] neither indeed can be
[17:47] so then they
[17:49] that are in the flesh
[17:52] cannot
[17:53] please god
[17:55] that is
[17:56] amplified because the mind of the flesh
[17:58] which is
[18:00] kind of thoughts
[18:02] and purposes is hostile to god for it
[18:05] does not submit itself to the law god's
[18:07] law indeed it cannot
[18:09] so then those who are living the life of
[18:11] the flesh
[18:12] catering to the appetites
[18:14] and impulses of their carnal nature
[18:17] cannot please
[18:19] or satisfy god
[18:21] or be acceptable to him
[18:23] and the title that i have tonight is d
[18:26] that are in the flesh cannot please god
[18:29] and this is where i got it from which is
[18:31] verse 8 these are in the flesh cannot
[18:33] please god in other words those who are
[18:36] catering to the appetites
[18:38] and the impulses of
[18:40] the khana nature but you are not in the
[18:43] flesh but in the spirit if so be that
[18:45] the spirit of god dwell in you
[18:47] and if any man have not the spirit of
[18:49] christ he is none of his
[18:52] and if christ being new the body is dead
[18:55] because of sin
[18:57] but the spirit is life because of
[18:59] righteousness
[19:00] now
[19:02] you know sometimes you could read
[19:03] scriptures and just read it like if it's
[19:05] a text just like you know words
[19:08] but the bible actually says
[19:10] to be
[19:11] carnally minded is death
[19:13] and to be spiritually minded is life and
[19:16] peace
[19:17] and we have to begin to take
[19:18] what god say as what god means
[19:21] if he means to be kindly minded is that
[19:24] it means just that that's nothing to do
[19:26] with any message
[19:28] what i believe
[19:29] is not a confession of what you believe
[19:32] or a confession of belief
[19:35] but it's what you applying to your heart
[19:38] and you'll realize tonight
[19:40] that paul
[19:42] is speaking to christians
[19:44] he's speaking to people who came to the
[19:45] lord and in church he's addressing their
[19:48] issues he's addressing their challenges
[19:51] he's not saying
[19:52] you are all right because you receive
[19:54] christ
[19:55] because i'm seeing it this way when you
[19:57] give your heart to the lord it's coming
[19:58] like you can invite christ in your porch
[20:02] he's not aldia you invite him he's in
[20:03] your porch but he wants to come in all
[20:05] the rooms the bedroom the living room
[20:08] the kitchen around the yard in your
[20:10] inner chambers you want to be there is
[20:12] where you want to invite him and you
[20:14] have an opportunity for him not just to
[20:16] be safe here but him to be lord so i
[20:19] think that
[20:20] this is something that
[20:22] if you really want to go deeper in god
[20:25] then you would see the need to apply
[20:28] what you're hearing from the scriptures
[20:30] to your very own life
[20:31] and not just be sitting hearing hearing
[20:34] hearing and believing what you're
[20:36] hearing and not connecting it to apply
[20:39] life or like but i would like to say all
[20:42] things pertaining to life and godliness
[20:44] this is what the gospel come to do
[20:47] because become
[20:48] that this word could become flesh in us
[20:51] that is what that is about now
[20:53] galatians 5.
[20:55] we want to read from 16 to 26
[20:58] and we want to check out what paul
[21:01] spoke to the galatians as the works of
[21:03] the flesh
[21:05] so this is galatians chapter 5 in the
[21:07] bible verse 16
[21:09] this i see then she's paul exalted
[21:13] walk in the spirit
[21:15] and you shall not fulfill
[21:17] the loss of the flesh
[21:19] so if you could get an order
[21:22] to walk in the spirit
[21:24] that means somebody could walk in the
[21:26] flesh now he's talking to christians i
[21:28] want you to get this he's not talking to
[21:30] unbelievers he's not talking to sinners
[21:33] he's talking to believers and he's
[21:35] exhorting them to walk in the spirit
[21:39] that you fulfill not the lust of the
[21:41] flesh
[21:42] 4 17 the flesh lusted against the spirit
[21:47] and the spirit against the flesh and
[21:49] these are contrary
[21:50] to one to the other so you cannot do the
[21:53] things that you would
[21:54] so he's showing here a war is going on
[21:56] between the flesh and the spirit don't
[21:59] tell me it's not going on because the
[22:01] word is self-identifying is a war
[22:03] 18 but if you be led of the spirit
[22:07] you are not under the law
[22:09] and verse 19 is where he started drill
[22:12] down
[22:13] in the works of the flesh now the works
[22:15] of the flesh are manifest which are
[22:16] these
[22:18] adultery
[22:19] fornication
[22:21] uncleanness
[22:22] laziousness
[22:24] and in the amplified they said no doing
[22:27] practices of flesh are clear and obvious
[22:29] they are immorality
[22:31] impurity
[22:32] indecency verse 20 it when did you say
[22:36] idolatry
[22:38] witchcraft
[22:39] that's right witchcraft
[22:42] hatred
[22:43] variants
[22:45] emulations
[22:46] rat
[22:48] strife
[22:50] seditions and heresies
[22:52] now sometimes i wish we could go down in
[22:53] detail of every one of these
[22:55] descriptions but i'll just give it in
[22:56] the amplified
[22:58] because it's important that you
[22:59] understand the depth of what is
[23:01] identified as the works of the flesh
[23:04] the amplified identifies idolatry
[23:06] sorcery
[23:08] enmity
[23:09] strife
[23:11] jealousy
[23:13] anger which is ill-tempered
[23:15] selfishness
[23:17] yes
[23:18] divisions
[23:19] dissensions people breaking away in our
[23:21] corner
[23:22] party spirit
[23:24] factions and sex with peculiar opinions
[23:28] and heresies
[23:30] all of that is works of the flesh verse
[23:32] 21
[23:34] went on to speak about envyings
[23:37] murders
[23:38] drunkness
[23:40] revelant and such like and it comes with
[23:42] a warning
[23:44] this is the believers
[23:46] and in this package of identifying
[23:49] the works of the flesh community warning
[23:52] and such like of the witch i tell you
[23:55] before
[23:56] as i have also told you in times past
[23:59] that they
[24:00] which
[24:02] do such things shall not inherit the
[24:05] kingdom of god
[24:07] let me read that again
[24:08] of the which i tell you before
[24:11] as i have told also told you in times
[24:14] past
[24:15] that day
[24:16] which do such things
[24:19] shall not
[24:20] inherit
[24:21] the kingdom of god
[24:24] that is plain as spain can be it have no
[24:27] ifs it has no bots it's plain as that so
[24:31] what it means
[24:33] is that this thing called whatever
[24:35] calling the books of the flesh that's
[24:37] what christ come to die to people that
[24:39] we could have conquer all these
[24:42] behaviors in all our hearts in our lives
[24:45] no
[24:46] and he says now verse 22
[24:49] he's switching over so identify
[24:51] the works of the flesh he said but the
[24:53] fruit of the spirit
[24:55] is love
[24:57] joy
[24:58] peace
[25:00] long suffering not short suffering long
[25:02] suffering
[25:04] gentleness
[25:06] goodness
[25:07] faith
[25:09] meekness
[25:10] temperance
[25:12] against such there is no law
[25:14] and they that are christ
[25:17] have crucified the flesh
[25:20] with the affections
[25:22] and lust not only amplified that verse
[25:25] 24 said and those who belong to christ
[25:27] jesus the messiah
[25:29] have crucified the flesh
[25:31] the godless
[25:33] human nature
[25:35] with his passions
[25:37] appetites
[25:38] and desires
[25:40] now that is what we are born with
[25:42] that is what we have passions
[25:44] appetites desires
[25:47] filthy torts
[25:48] 30 desires unholy torch
[25:51] this is
[25:52] built in
[25:53] but coming to christ get give us our
[25:57] opportunity
[25:58] to be listen carefully to be fire bombed
[26:02] that these things could get bomb out of
[26:04] us or
[26:06] the grip of the enemy upon our lives
[26:08] could be broken
[26:10] and it's important to see it that way
[26:13] because remember we were born in shape
[26:15] iniquity but that is not how god come
[26:17] for let us remain
[26:19] it come that we could get that yoke
[26:22] bondage
[26:23] broken off of us that we can live the
[26:26] abundance
[26:27] no
[26:29] the word in itself
[26:31] washing
[26:32] will be cleansed by the washing of the
[26:33] water by the word
[26:35] but the operation of the spirit fire
[26:38] fire
[26:39] is to really burn and cleanse and that
[26:41] is where the seraphs
[26:42] comes in they are the burners that
[26:45] prepares the worshiper to come into
[26:47] god's presence
[26:49] so
[26:50] it's
[26:51] uh it's a
[26:53] it's much more beyond the letter and you
[26:55] know in this intellectual age with the
[26:57] increase of knowledge
[26:59] people have moved away from
[27:02] the spirit
[27:03] and they move into a level of
[27:05] intellectualism no
[27:07] intellectualism is a powerful thing
[27:09] because intellectualism is like
[27:12] knowledge glorified
[27:14] without god
[27:15] because intellectualism is putting
[27:17] things together from the human
[27:19] standpoint
[27:20] so god not really in it in that sense it
[27:23] could be nice words and fancy
[27:25] explanations but it's not
[27:29] god breathe
[27:30] you see and the bible talks about holy
[27:32] men moved by the holy ghost and every
[27:35] scripture is given by inspiration every
[27:37] scripture is god breathed
[27:39] so this is what
[27:41] the spirit is therefore to breathe and
[27:43] bring life by the word because the
[27:45] letter killer but the spirit is what
[27:47] brings life
[27:48] so trust tonight that you begin to take
[27:51] a closer look at what we are saying
[27:53] tonight about those that are in the
[27:55] flesh
[27:56] and those that in the spirit that for
[27:58] the fruit of the spirit okay
[28:00] now
[28:01] and those who belong to christ jesus the
[28:03] messiah have crucified the flesh the
[28:05] godless human nature with his passions
[28:08] and appetites and desires
[28:11] and verse 25 said if we live in the
[28:14] spirit
[28:15] let us also walk in the spirit
[28:18] so that is very interesting how he
[28:19] presented that
[28:21] if we live in the spirit let us also
[28:23] walk in a sprint so there is a way to
[28:25] walk
[28:26] and the amplifier is if we live by the
[28:28] holy spirit let us walk by the spirit if
[28:32] by the holy spirit we have our life in
[28:35] god
[28:36] let us go forward walking in line
[28:39] or conduct control
[28:41] by the holy spirit verse 26 let us not
[28:45] be desires of vain glory
[28:48] for walking one another
[28:50] and being one another no he is not
[28:51] talking about unbelievers i want to get
[28:53] that he's talking about true truth folks
[28:56] he's talking about church people and he
[28:58] amplified let us not become vainglorious
[29:00] and self-conceited competitive
[29:03] and challenging
[29:05] and provoking
[29:06] and irritating to one another envying
[29:10] and the jealous of one another all this
[29:14] is church folks
[29:16] challenging
[29:18] provoking
[29:19] irritate
[29:20] envian
[29:22] being jealous
[29:23] praise alone second corinthians chapter
[29:25] 10
[29:26] have your bibles nearby
[29:28] you're running a course tonight
[29:30] and
[29:31] you see how it goes
[29:34] present blessed being in the flow
[29:37] second corinthians chapter 10 paul
[29:41] speaks
[29:43] but i beseech you
[29:45] that i may not be bold when i'm present
[29:48] without confidence wherein i think to be
[29:50] bold against some
[29:51] which think of us as if we walk
[29:53] according to the flesh
[29:55] and paul bringing our balance as he
[29:57] always does
[29:58] and this is in verse 3.
[30:00] for though we walk in the flesh
[30:03] not being fleshly now we in this flesh
[30:05] do we walk in the flesh
[30:07] we do not war
[30:09] after the flesh
[30:11] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[30:14] carnal
[30:15] but mighty true god
[30:18] to the pulling down of strongholds
[30:21] cast in dung imaginations
[30:23] and every high thing
[30:25] that exalted itself against the
[30:28] knowledge of god
[30:30] and bringing in the captivity
[30:32] every thought
[30:34] to the obedience of christ now you could
[30:36] see
[30:37] by the way paul is presenting this
[30:39] he is actually showing that this is
[30:42] operational
[30:44] in other words this is not
[30:46] like some esoteric or some kind of fan
[30:49] down good thought or just an imagination
[30:52] or some uh uh deep mystery he is saying
[30:56] watch
[30:56] by casting down imaginations he's
[30:59] actually doing that
[31:01] and every high thing that exhausted
[31:04] itself against the knowledge of god and
[31:06] bringing into captivity
[31:08] every thought
[31:09] to the obedience of christ
[31:11] now let's read this in the amplified
[31:13] for though we walk or live in the flesh
[31:16] we are not carrying on our warfare
[31:20] according to the flesh
[31:22] and using mere humans weapons
[31:25] for the weapons of our warfare
[31:28] are not physical
[31:30] weapons of flesh and blood
[31:33] but they are mighty before god
[31:35] for the overthrow and destruction of
[31:38] strongholds
[31:40] in as much
[31:41] as we refute arguments and theories and
[31:44] reasoning and every proud and lofty
[31:46] thing
[31:47] that sets itself up against the true
[31:49] knowledge of god and we lead every
[31:51] thought and purpose away captive
[31:54] into obedience
[31:56] of christ jesus
[31:58] so you could see
[32:00] could you see
[32:02] yourself being that type of active
[32:04] christian
[32:06] to walk in the spirit actively pursuing
[32:10] god
[32:11] like jesus said this way if any man come
[32:13] after me i just love that
[32:16] let him deny himself
[32:18] take up his cross
[32:19] and follow me
[32:21] he didn't see if any man is in church
[32:23] people
[32:24] love church church
[32:27] they love church they sit in church but
[32:29] we're not talking about church now
[32:31] if any man come after me
[32:34] you are pursuing him
[32:36] you are going after him you want to be
[32:39] like him you want to walk like him you
[32:41] want to talk like him you want to live
[32:43] like him you want to relate to others
[32:45] like him
[32:46] and i share this with somebody that
[32:49] you know um
[32:51] everybody had their limits
[32:52] and i have minds too
[32:55] and i was thinking of
[32:57] you know speaking of seeing certain
[32:59] things some ministers and stuff
[33:02] and to really kind of rough things up
[33:04] you know
[33:05] with
[33:05] you know when i had enough of the
[33:06] foolishness and so on
[33:08] and i find myself
[33:11] asking myself
[33:14] if jesus would see it that way
[33:17] and i find that's very interesting
[33:19] because i know i know to you of it i
[33:21] know how he will see things i know how
[33:24] he could react and so now when i think
[33:27] it over i said no jesus would not say
[33:30] that
[33:31] and i said myself if jesus will not say
[33:34] it i will not say it and i find that was
[33:37] a good experience to me
[33:39] because i'm not saying i'm not trying
[33:42] to
[33:43] to
[33:44] do it my way i'm trying to catch
[33:47] how would christ act how would christ
[33:50] see could i see it better you know paul
[33:54] said before i show you a more excellent
[33:55] way do i speak with the tongues women
[33:58] angels have their charity and so on and
[34:01] when it comes across like that you
[34:03] always find yourself looking not just
[34:06] for a we but is there a better way
[34:08] for husbands for wives for marriages for
[34:12] parenting
[34:13] how we do what we do is there a better
[34:16] way that it could be done yes you did it
[34:19] it's fear it's okay but could it have
[34:22] been done better
[34:24] is there a better approach
[34:26] and to me
[34:27] this have to be something in our hearts
[34:30] that this is me i gotta take me as i am
[34:33] no no no no that is really you intrude
[34:35] that is you in your flesh you in your
[34:38] flesh
[34:40] see i in my flesh
[34:42] but how would christ act and this is
[34:45] what we all have to come to
[34:47] amen praise the lord okay let's go to
[34:51] uh colossians chapter 3.
[34:54] you want to read lengthy scripture from
[34:56] one when we down to 15
[34:58] and we would see how that goes
[35:00] colossians chapter 3. this is paul
[35:04] getting down now you would see how he's
[35:06] switching and he's
[35:07] is a continuity
[35:09] it's it's a continuing line that paul
[35:13] is presenting to the believers
[35:15] of their walk with god
[35:17] of their
[35:19] their willful decisions and actions
[35:22] in this kingdom
[35:24] and i'm seeing that
[35:26] because
[35:28] in the journey from egypt to the
[35:30] promised land
[35:31] manna fell from heaven
[35:33] goats and queens and get them meat and
[35:34] water and everything else but when they
[35:36] got into the land they had us to take
[35:38] their land little by little and mana
[35:40] ceased to fall in that land so anybody
[35:43] coming into the land and they don't
[35:45] expect to get a hoe and the fork
[35:48] and all the instruments to do work to
[35:49] clean up the land being problems in
[35:51] trouble
[35:52] when they think and you know come to
[35:55] jesus everything's going to be fine
[35:57] and they expect manager for from heaven
[35:59] with the final that they're getting seed
[36:00] to plant and they have a ground to till
[36:03] and labor and work
[36:05] and they're not prepared for that
[36:06] that will be problems but look at paul
[36:09] in colossians 3 verse one said if you be
[36:12] risen with christ
[36:14] seek those things which are above
[36:17] now
[36:18] this is active
[36:21] this is not passive
[36:22] this is not
[36:24] the past i have the mysteries and once
[36:26] you have the right pastor you're you're
[36:28] safe
[36:29] this is poor
[36:31] exhorting them
[36:32] seek
[36:33] those things which are above where
[36:36] christ sits in the right hand of god or
[36:38] you're christian all right smoking
[36:40] drinking partying whatever it is your
[36:43] mind on things out there this is the
[36:44] natural life
[36:46] here goes to set
[36:48] your affection on things above
[36:50] not on things on the earth
[36:52] you know you could set tuna washing
[36:54] machines and be stove set this set that
[36:57] whatever it is set an alarm just set it
[36:59] you actually pre-program it yes rest
[37:01] there i want to go in that direction he
[37:03] said set your affections on things above
[37:07] other things of the earth for you are
[37:08] dead
[37:09] and your life is healed with christ in
[37:11] god and when christ who is our life
[37:14] shall appear then shall he also appear
[37:16] with him in glory
[37:18] now this is the verse i want to get to
[37:21] this is the first i want to go to this
[37:22] fight
[37:24] it says
[37:26] mortified therefore
[37:28] your members
[37:30] which are upon the earth
[37:33] fornication
[37:35] uncleanness
[37:37] in ordinate affection
[37:39] evil concussed percents and
[37:41] consciousness which is idolatry
[37:44] that word
[37:46] mortify
[37:47] amplified in the amplified it says so
[37:50] kill i say modify
[37:52] deaden
[37:54] the price of power
[37:56] the evil desire
[37:59] looking in your members
[38:01] those animal impulses
[38:04] and all that is easily in you
[38:08] that is employed in sin
[38:11] sexual vice
[38:13] impurity
[38:15] sensual happy tax
[38:17] desires
[38:19] and all greed and consciousness for that
[38:22] is idolatry
[38:23] the define of self and other created
[38:27] things
[38:28] instead of god
[38:32] let's read it again motif idea for
[38:36] your members which are upon the earth
[38:40] who is to do that
[38:43] i could modify your members
[38:45] or what you think about
[38:48] could a pastor modify somebody else
[38:50] member
[38:51] no
[38:52] that is you
[38:54] that is what
[38:55] you have to do
[38:57] that is what i have to do that is what
[39:00] we all must do
[39:02] mortify
[39:03] your members
[39:06] nobody could do that for you
[39:08] as a husband
[39:10] your wife can't do that for you
[39:12] if you want to go lusting she can't stop
[39:14] you
[39:15] as a wife your husband cannot do that
[39:17] for you
[39:18] if you want to go lusting
[39:20] he cannot stop that from you
[39:23] you have to have a desire in your heart
[39:26] to bring your members in subjection to
[39:29] god's plan
[39:31] and god's program
[39:33] praise the lord
[39:35] but this community warning
[39:37] so this is not
[39:39] um
[39:40] how they say it's not buffy style you
[39:43] know i
[39:44] i don't want that tonight you know i
[39:47] it could do with some some trumpets and
[39:48] some vials and some
[39:51] woo
[39:52] i want to hear about a new name to them
[39:54] that will come all right fine
[39:57] for which things seek
[40:00] this is verse 6
[40:01] the wrath of god comment
[40:04] on the children of disobedience
[40:08] also wait a minute
[40:10] it's not just coming to church that's
[40:13] right
[40:14] it's not just i believe
[40:17] that's right
[40:18] are you going to come to the spot where
[40:20] you have to accept now you know wait a
[40:21] minute wait a minute i have to do that
[40:23] yes
[40:24] it's like man know thyself
[40:26] you have to understand how your body
[40:27] works
[40:28] you have to understand what is make a
[40:30] trip
[40:31] you just have to understand you know
[40:33] like the guy
[40:34] he got delivered he came to the lord and
[40:37] he stopped drinking and smoking but any
[40:38] time he passed by which by the making
[40:40] manufacturing drinks it was wiped him
[40:42] out
[40:43] does he smell because he he was under
[40:45] that influence
[40:47] just like the girl who was in partying
[40:48] and whatnot and she passing dear you
[40:51] know something tell her go and testify
[40:52] does he say tonight sit and try to get
[40:54] back in the airport
[40:56] we come out of all kind of stuff and the
[40:58] devil's job is to get you back into that
[41:00] happens
[41:02] it's not hard to do that the example is
[41:05] in the scriptures
[41:06] jesus called all these brothers out of
[41:08] fishing and whatnot but three and a half
[41:09] years he's just pumping wood pumping
[41:11] miracles uh taking them anointing them
[41:14] blessing them and they're seeing all
[41:15] kind of stuff but when jesus died and he
[41:17] prophesied to them he told them the son
[41:19] of man
[41:20] he'd wear the whole hug the whole scroll
[41:24] and once they see my wrong
[41:26] guess what
[41:27] peter said go fishing and they all say
[41:29] we go fishing they went back to fishing
[41:32] after three and a half years not with a
[41:33] pastor not with a teacher not with the
[41:36] evangelist but with the lord himself the
[41:38] messiah
[41:40] they backslid and went back to the
[41:42] original
[41:44] estate
[41:46] the original position that he pulled
[41:48] them out from
[41:49] and jesus knowing
[41:51] flesh is flesh he came and said sharon
[41:53] are you any meat
[41:55] and the confession was we we fish all
[41:58] night and caught nothing
[42:00] and you give them a word cashing it
[42:03] to the right side
[42:04] these guys are facing
[42:06] yes something tell them
[42:08] is truth coming forth
[42:09] the word coming forward and they will be
[42:11] and they got the fish
[42:13] jesus still was concerned about them
[42:15] because they knew they were foreknown of
[42:17] god but he knew they're not they have to
[42:19] come into shape they have to come into
[42:21] position they are not there yet they are
[42:23] still walking in the flesh
[42:25] isn't that something peter you'll deny
[42:28] me
[42:29] hallelujah peter you remind me but after
[42:32] you're converted i want you to distract
[42:34] me
[42:36] you'll fall i'm saying that so it's not
[42:38] as if he doesn't know that you are in
[42:40] the flesh or you walk
[42:42] in the flesh it's not that you
[42:44] but it's what you lean into because how
[42:47] the tree leans is we're gonna form so
[42:50] you have to come to this spot like we
[42:52] shared in some bible study the beauty of
[42:53] holiness you have to come to that spot
[42:55] where you could raise your hands
[42:57] sincerely and say lord i worship you in
[43:00] the beauty of holiness isn't that a
[43:02] beautiful thing
[43:03] that you could say i worship you in the
[43:06] beauty of holiness jesus told his crime
[43:08] and pharisees your teachings and your
[43:11] doctrine make the word of non-effect
[43:13] what i want to see and what i would love
[43:15] to see is this word having an effect
[43:18] upon your everyday life that your wife
[43:21] will know your husband will know your
[43:22] children now your neighbor your
[43:24] co-workers anybody you come in contact
[43:26] with you will know that what you are
[43:28] hearing what you are being taught what
[43:30] you are doing what you are reading and
[43:32] studying you are applying it to your
[43:34] heart and to your life oh blessed be
[43:36] name of the lord so it says for the
[43:39] which things seek
[43:41] the wrath
[43:42] of god
[43:43] comment on children of disobedience and
[43:46] the amplified say it is on account of
[43:48] these very sins
[43:51] that the holy anger of god is ever
[43:53] coming upon the sons
[43:56] of disobedience
[43:57] those who are
[43:59] abstinently opposed
[44:02] to the divine will
[44:04] now
[44:05] i believe in the old testament
[44:08] god judge the two sons of the earth
[44:10] fool around and a priesthood
[44:12] god come and judge a nasty sapphire and
[44:15] there's a prophecy that will repeat
[44:17] again in the last days because people
[44:20] think it's church
[44:21] when the pendulum is swinging
[44:24] to god's mind and god's peoples and plan
[44:27] as we said in one bible teaching that
[44:30] the reason and national fire was judged
[44:32] not for god to show he's a judge
[44:34] he is a judge but he wanted to keep the
[44:36] church clean
[44:38] this was the miss this was the most
[44:40] important thing to keep the church pure
[44:43] to keep the church clean and he's the
[44:46] same yesterday today and forever now
[44:49] verse seven that same scripture
[44:52] in which he also walked some time when
[44:54] you lived in them so that was supposed
[44:56] to be passed
[44:57] and paul
[44:58] is saying okay used to live contrary and
[45:01] live rebellious disobedient but verse 8
[45:04] he said but no
[45:05] you also have to put off these things
[45:09] anger
[45:10] rat
[45:12] malice
[45:13] blasphemy
[45:15] filthy communications out of your mouth
[45:18] so he's adding to it
[45:20] adding to what they were living in
[45:22] amplified of that verse it says but now
[45:24] put away and rid yourselves completely
[45:27] of these things
[45:30] anger bridge
[45:33] bad feeling towards others
[45:36] curses are in slander and full mouth
[45:39] abuse
[45:41] and shameful utterance
[45:43] from your lips
[45:44] i don't remember the early days
[45:46] in the early days was sword fighting you
[45:48] know
[45:50] when you meet bredrin it's so generous
[45:53] and
[45:54] it was crazy because it had no bragging
[45:55] kindness it had no love with it it's
[45:57] just trying to find the crudest rudest
[46:00] way to save something and you would chop
[46:02] somebody down
[46:04] and every time they meet it's like cling
[46:05] clang is like sword fighting and you
[46:08] know you look back now and see it was so
[46:10] vile in those times
[46:12] because it wasn't about the grace of god
[46:14] the love of god it wasn't about
[46:16] redemption and people
[46:18] not understanding what the will of the
[46:19] lord is
[46:20] it's a matter of
[46:22] you are right
[46:23] and you are arrogant with your rightness
[46:26] and you are dead wrong by your heart of
[46:28] arrogance because one once the one thing
[46:31] god hate is pride and arrogance that is
[46:34] ice problems because that's what lucifer
[46:35] in the beginning
[46:36] and
[46:37] you as a christian could actually go in
[46:39] the wrong direction because you can
[46:40] become self-righteous
[46:42] and self-righteous is
[46:45] a religious sinner you see because they
[46:47] can't tell them anything and they could
[46:49] judge others there are people who right
[46:51] now who be on the righteous force
[46:52] judging everything right now
[46:54] and they're on their own but when you
[46:57] understand and grasp the grace of god
[46:59] that you see who we phone you call we
[47:01] call it justified we justify you're very
[47:04] glorified and he'll leave all that
[47:06] sanctification part leave all that labor
[47:08] part in that scripture justified
[47:11] glorified and that middle part is where
[47:14] we are at is what we have to do in our
[47:17] sanctification in our modification in
[47:20] our cleansing in our application to what
[47:22] god tells us other than that if this is
[47:26] not truth
[47:27] all we have to do is believe
[47:29] i believe a prophet i believe
[47:32] um you know what what what the prophet
[47:33] said and that's it
[47:35] just a belief
[47:36] that is no different from the catholic
[47:38] scene the apostle creed that is no
[47:40] different from all these novenas and
[47:43] hilly mary and just reading stuff and
[47:45] believe that because you read these
[47:47] stuff or see it many times you're safe
[47:49] you're fine
[47:51] that's not different from that it's just
[47:52] in a modernized and a modern way
[47:55] okay
[47:56] so what
[47:57] so put away these things all right put
[47:59] away
[48:00] completely anger rage bad feeling
[48:03] towards others curses flanders fall
[48:06] mouth abuse and shameful utterances from
[48:08] your lips so it's night lying not one to
[48:11] another seeing that you have put off the
[48:13] old man with his deeds
[48:14] and have put on the new man
[48:17] which is renewed in knowledge after the
[48:20] image of him that created this verse to
[48:23] me is very important and you have put on
[48:26] the new man which is renewed in
[48:29] knowledge so whereas before smoking
[48:32] drinking carrying on you didn't have the
[48:33] knowledge and the information now it's
[48:35] there so watch amplified of that one and
[48:37] have clothed yourself with the new
[48:40] spiritual self which is ever in i love
[48:44] this
[48:45] how this is placed
[48:47] and have clothed yourself
[48:50] with the new spiritual self which is
[48:52] ever in the process
[48:55] of being renewed
[48:57] and removed
[48:59] into fuller
[49:01] and more perfect knowledge
[49:03] upon knowledge
[49:05] after the image the likeness of him who
[49:07] created
[49:09] unlike that
[49:11] the process of being renewed
[49:13] the process of being remolded into a
[49:16] fuller
[49:17] and more perfect knowledge i call the
[49:19] prophet said we know in part and
[49:20] prophesy in part
[49:21] but when that is perfect is come
[49:24] and he said that is from partial
[49:26] realization into full realization
[49:29] because we know in part
[49:30] but we are going to be brought from
[49:33] partial realization into full
[49:35] realization
[49:36] and
[49:37] you could see what jesus said when he
[49:39] said in john 14 20 at that day you shall
[49:41] know i am in the father in me and i knew
[49:44] so that would be a good point for us and
[49:47] then you could connect that ephesians 4
[49:49] till we all come into the unity of the
[49:52] fate the knowledge of the son of god
[49:54] onto a perfect man unto the fullness of
[49:57] the measure of the statue of christ
[50:00] so that is the stature of perfection
[50:03] isn't that wonderful tonight oh blessed
[50:05] give the lord some praises blessed be
[50:07] the name
[50:08] of the lord so watch verse 11
[50:11] paul hitler at home here now and there
[50:14] is neither greek nor jew
[50:16] circumcision or uncircumcision barbarian
[50:19] skintion bond nor free but christ is all
[50:23] and in all
[50:25] then he comes back
[50:26] verse 12
[50:28] put on therefore
[50:30] a hell and
[50:31] not believe
[50:33] put on therefore
[50:35] as the elect of god
[50:38] holy and beloved bowels of mercies
[50:42] kindness
[50:43] humbleness of mind
[50:45] meekness and long suffering now you know
[50:48] there are some people naturally natural
[50:50] they are kind helpful there are some
[50:53] people as mean as the devil and they
[50:55] come to church
[50:56] no offense
[50:58] they're terrible
[51:00] and um but god called them
[51:02] but here it is
[51:04] just as we would talk about when you
[51:07] bring your invitation in the wedding and
[51:09] those in the new testament
[51:12] the eastern philosophy we in the eastern
[51:14] way you get a garment
[51:16] and everybody gets the same garnet
[51:19] and they don't know if you are rich or
[51:21] poor
[51:22] if you have one clothing no whatever it
[51:24] is everybody has the same garment and
[51:27] they found the guy in there without the
[51:29] garment the man said by the hand and
[51:31] foot throw him out because he comes some
[51:32] other way once you come to the door you
[51:34] get that gun
[51:35] so this is it here now you have to be
[51:38] rubed
[51:39] so it's not a matter well she kind and
[51:41] not so kind she's soft-hearted i
[51:43] heart-hearted no no this is the order
[51:45] here this is the order here put on
[51:47] therefore as the elect of god holy and
[51:50] beloved powers of mercedes kindness
[51:54] humbleness of mind meekness
[51:56] long suffering and the amplified is
[51:59] expressive industry include yourselves
[52:01] therefore
[52:03] as god's own chosen ones his own picked
[52:07] representatives who are purified and
[52:09] holy and well beloved by god himself
[52:13] by putting on behavior marked
[52:16] by tender hearted pity and mercy
[52:21] kind feeling
[52:23] a lowly opinion of yourself that's a big
[52:26] big big one
[52:28] a lowly opinion of yourselves
[52:30] gentle ways and patience which is
[52:33] tireless and long-suffering and has the
[52:36] power to endure whatever comes with good
[52:39] temper
[52:40] blistering
[52:42] in your bible for bearing one another
[52:45] forgiving one another
[52:46] if any man had a quarrel against any
[52:49] he must christ forgive you so also do we
[52:53] be amplified be gentle
[52:55] and forbearing with one another
[52:58] and if one has a difference a grievance
[53:01] or complaint against another
[53:03] really pardoning each other even as the
[53:07] lord has
[53:08] freely forgiven you so must you also
[53:12] forgive
[53:13] verse 14 says above all things put on
[53:15] charity
[53:17] which is the bond of perfectness
[53:20] and let the peace of god
[53:22] rule
[53:23] in your hearts to which also you are
[53:26] called in one body and be careful
[53:28] all blessed be the name of the lord
[53:30] so that is
[53:32] colossians let's go back to romans 8
[53:36] and we want to go from 12 to 14.
[53:38] so i know it's police are slipping away
[53:40] and i i i i
[53:42] felt like to do it this way we go back
[53:44] to romans 8 but we want to read from
[53:46] verse 12 to 14.
[53:51] dear for brethren
[53:53] we are debtors
[53:55] not to the flesh
[53:57] to live after the flesh
[54:00] for if you live after the flesh
[54:02] ye shall die
[54:05] that is specific
[54:08] but if you through the spirit
[54:11] do mortify the deeds of the body
[54:14] you shall live
[54:17] and then is a familiar scripture in
[54:18] verse 14 as many as are led
[54:22] by the spirit of god
[54:25] they are the sons of god
[54:27] now remember
[54:29] they that are in the flesh cannot please
[54:31] god
[54:33] because they cannot be subject to god
[54:36] and yet they could sit down in church
[54:39] and say what they believe
[54:41] but they are not in subjection
[54:44] to god or man they in no subjection
[54:46] anybody they actually
[54:48] go by their own thoughts
[54:51] and
[54:52] you hear me sometimes of time say
[54:54] they is not the god of the bible
[54:56] the servant they are serving the god of
[54:59] their own imagination
[55:01] or the god of their own mind or whatever
[55:03] god or spirit they serve and telling
[55:05] them that they are right
[55:06] sometimes they sit down in the
[55:07] congregation and they judge the preacher
[55:09] as wrong and they are taught as right
[55:12] because they've seen it so
[55:14] and they're getting in so
[55:15] and they don't even understand
[55:17] that is not god at all
[55:19] is a god of their own imagination
[55:21] they
[55:22] that and their flesh cannot please god
[55:25] now let's read and amplify this romans 8
[55:27] 12
[55:28] so then brethren
[55:30] we are debtors
[55:31] but not to the flesh
[55:33] we are not obligated to our carnal
[55:36] nature
[55:37] to live a life
[55:39] ruled by the standards
[55:42] set up
[55:42] by the dictates of the flesh
[55:45] so the flesh is the boss manual i want
[55:48] you to see that that's why i had to
[55:49] modify
[55:50] i had to arrest him that's why i had to
[55:52] buy him and lock him up
[55:54] because he does dictate he has given
[55:56] orders are you with me tonight
[55:58] how many being uh 85 from this tonight
[56:02] the flesh is a ruler
[56:04] that's why the exhortation is to arrest
[56:07] him as a motivation to to take away his
[56:10] power
[56:11] to deaden it
[56:13] that is what all that is about
[56:15] okay so let's continue here now
[56:17] watch so brethren
[56:19] we are debtors but not to the flesh
[56:22] we are not obligated to our carnal
[56:23] nature live a life rule
[56:26] by the standards
[56:28] set up by the dictates of the flesh but
[56:30] if you live
[56:32] according to the dictates of the flesh
[56:34] you will surely die
[56:36] that's something like god maybe
[56:38] but if you through the power of the holy
[56:40] spirit
[56:41] you are here we go habitually put into
[56:44] debt
[56:45] and making extinct
[56:48] deadening the evil deeds prompted by the
[56:51] body you shall really and genuinely live
[56:54] forever for all who are led by the
[56:56] spirit of god
[56:58] are
[56:59] the sons of god
[57:01] oh praise god
[57:03] so
[57:06] and i want to go to ephesians four you
[57:08] do have to find this one because i'm
[57:09] going to read all of this from the
[57:11] amplified ephesians 4
[57:13] maybe later on i'm going to put out the
[57:17] all these scriptures and stuff so
[57:19] basically check it out afterwards but
[57:21] ephesians 4
[57:22] 17 to 27 i want to read it straight from
[57:24] the amplifier
[57:26] for this i say and solemnly testify
[57:28] in the name of the lord
[57:30] as in his presence that you must no
[57:33] longer live as the hidden the gentiles
[57:35] do
[57:36] in their perverseness
[57:38] in the folly vanity and emptiness of
[57:40] their souls and futility of their minds
[57:43] their moral understanding is darkened
[57:46] their reason is be clouded they are
[57:48] alienated extreme self-banished from the
[57:51] life of god with no shame
[57:53] this is because of the ignorance the
[57:56] want of knowledge and perception the
[57:58] willful blindness that is deep seated in
[58:01] them due to their hardness of heart to
[58:03] the insensitiveness of their moral
[58:06] nature
[58:09] verse 19 the amplifier be continued in
[58:11] their spiritual apathy
[58:13] they have become colors
[58:16] and past feeling
[58:18] unreckless
[58:20] and have abandoned themselves i pray to
[58:22] unbridled
[58:24] sensuality
[58:26] eager
[58:27] and greedy to indulge in every form of
[58:30] impurity
[58:31] that their depraved desires may suggest
[58:34] and demand but you did not so live in
[58:37] christ
[58:38] assuming
[58:40] that you have really heard him
[58:42] and have been taught by him
[58:44] as all truth is in jesus embodied
[58:48] and fun sonified in him
[58:51] strip yourselves of your former nature
[58:54] hallelujah
[58:56] put off
[58:57] and discard
[58:58] your unrenewed self
[59:01] which characterize your previous manner
[59:04] of life and becomes corrupt through lust
[59:08] and desires
[59:09] that spring from delusion
[59:11] and be constantly of the start renewed
[59:15] in the spirit of your mind having a
[59:18] fresh mental and spiritual attitude
[59:21] and
[59:22] put on the new nature
[59:24] the regenerate self created in god's
[59:27] image god like into righteousness and
[59:29] holiness therefore
[59:31] rejecting all falsity
[59:33] and being done now with it
[59:35] that everyone expressed the truth with
[59:38] his neighbor
[59:40] for we are all parts of one body
[59:43] and members of one another
[59:45] so in other words
[59:46] you don't have to hum and hold well and
[59:48] you're bobbing and you're ducking in
[59:49] your weaving because you want to see
[59:51] what you should see
[59:53] no it says stay true
[59:55] even it's against you it's still the
[59:57] truth
[59:58] because if you're lying you ought to see
[1:00:00] a next lighting called the first line
[1:00:02] and then you have to see a kid like the
[1:00:03] color of the second night right now
[1:00:04] finish
[1:00:06] you have a lot of number of likes guys
[1:00:08] see the bible already clearly see but
[1:00:10] he's not the unbelievers
[1:00:12] put away lying
[1:00:14] okay let's continue
[1:00:18] therefore rejecting all falsity
[1:00:20] and being done now with it that everyone
[1:00:23] expressed the truth with his neighbor
[1:00:25] for all parts of one body are members of
[1:00:27] one another
[1:00:29] when angry do not sin
[1:00:32] do not let your wrath your exasperation
[1:00:34] your fury or your indignation last until
[1:00:37] the sun goes down
[1:00:39] leave
[1:00:40] no such room or football for the devil
[1:00:44] give no opportunity to him
[1:00:47] so the bible says resist the devil isha
[1:00:49] free
[1:00:51] romans 6 so go back we'll hit roman 6
[1:00:54] now
[1:00:57] 15 to 23. you could find it romans
[1:00:59] chapter 6
[1:01:01] your bible is dear
[1:01:03] sword sharpen
[1:01:04] romans 6 50.
[1:01:07] what then shall we sin because we are
[1:01:09] not under the law
[1:01:11] but under grace god forbid
[1:01:13] knowing not
[1:01:15] that to whom you yield yourself servants
[1:01:17] to obey his servants he are to whom you
[1:01:20] will be
[1:01:21] whether of sin unto death
[1:01:23] or obedience under righteousness
[1:01:26] amplified of 16 says do you not know
[1:01:29] that if you continually surrender
[1:01:31] yourself
[1:01:33] to anyone to do his will
[1:01:35] you are the slaves of him whom you will
[1:01:38] be
[1:01:39] whether that to be sin which leads to
[1:01:41] debt
[1:01:42] or to obedience which leads to
[1:01:44] righteousness
[1:01:46] right doing and right standing with god
[1:01:48] so listen
[1:01:50] whichever side is two sides
[1:01:52] flesh
[1:01:53] and spirit
[1:01:55] and which side you will be
[1:01:57] is who's in charge of you
[1:02:01] if
[1:02:02] you're following through with the
[1:02:03] details of the flesh
[1:02:05] then you're a slave of that
[1:02:08] if you're following through with the
[1:02:09] peace of the spirit
[1:02:11] then you are subject to the spirit i
[1:02:14] want you to get that tonight so in your
[1:02:16] heart
[1:02:17] you have to have a strong desire
[1:02:20] to be under obedience
[1:02:23] unto righteousness
[1:02:24] verse 17 says but god be thanked
[1:02:27] that you were servants of sins were but
[1:02:30] you have obeyed
[1:02:32] from the heart
[1:02:33] that form of doctrine which was
[1:02:36] delivered to you
[1:02:38] let's see what that isn't amplified but
[1:02:40] thank god
[1:02:42] though you were once slaves of sin
[1:02:45] you have become obedient
[1:02:49] with all your heart
[1:02:51] to the standard of teaching in which you
[1:02:54] were instructed
[1:02:55] unto which you were committed
[1:02:58] being then made free from sin you become
[1:03:02] the servants
[1:03:03] of righteousness
[1:03:05] you can't have both
[1:03:08] free from sin
[1:03:09] you become a servant of righteousness
[1:03:12] you can't serve two masters at the same
[1:03:14] time
[1:03:16] hallelujah
[1:03:17] oh it's not wonderful tonight you've got
[1:03:19] some priests
[1:03:21] hallelujah you're here to serve christ
[1:03:23] the messiah
[1:03:25] all right
[1:03:26] so paul
[1:03:28] says here
[1:03:29] verse 18. i want to read it again being
[1:03:31] made free from sin
[1:03:33] you became the servants of righteousness
[1:03:36] and the ambly fight says i haven't been
[1:03:38] set free from sin you have become
[1:03:41] the servants of righteousness get us
[1:03:45] of conformity
[1:03:47] to the divine will
[1:03:49] in thought
[1:03:51] purpose
[1:03:53] verse 19 i speak after the man of men
[1:03:56] because of the infirmity of your flesh
[1:03:58] but as you have yielded your members
[1:04:00] servants to uncleanness
[1:04:03] and to iniquity unto iniquity
[1:04:06] even so now
[1:04:07] he's given instructions even now
[1:04:10] yield your members servants to
[1:04:13] righteousness underwhelming
[1:04:16] and amplified we continue i'm speaking
[1:04:19] in familiar human terms because of your
[1:04:21] natural limitations
[1:04:23] for as you yielded your bodily members
[1:04:25] and faculties
[1:04:27] as servants to impurity
[1:04:29] and ever increasing lawlessness so now
[1:04:33] yield your bodily members and faculties
[1:04:36] once
[1:04:37] for all
[1:04:38] are servants of righteousness
[1:04:41] right being
[1:04:43] and doing
[1:04:44] which leads to sanctification
[1:04:46] verse 20 for when you were servants of
[1:04:49] sin you were free from righteousness
[1:04:51] what fruit had he in those things where
[1:04:53] of you are now ashamed for the end of
[1:04:55] those things is dead but now being made
[1:04:57] free from sin
[1:04:59] and become servants to god
[1:05:01] you have your fruit unto holiness
[1:05:04] and the end everlasting life
[1:05:06] for the wages of sin is death
[1:05:08] but the gift of god is eternal life to
[1:05:10] jesus christ
[1:05:11] our lord
[1:05:13] and now we go back to galatians chapter
[1:05:14] 6 which i want you to find i want to
[1:05:16] read verse 7 to 10 then galatians
[1:05:18] chapter 6
[1:05:19] verse 7 to 10. and verse 7 says be no
[1:05:22] deceived
[1:05:23] god is not mocked
[1:05:25] for whatsoever a man swear that shall he
[1:05:28] also reap
[1:05:29] for he that swear to the flesh shall of
[1:05:31] the flesh reap corruption
[1:05:33] he that swear to the spirit shall the
[1:05:36] spirit reap life everlasting
[1:05:38] so wait a minute
[1:05:40] you could sow to the flesh
[1:05:43] of course
[1:05:44] you can sow to the spirit
[1:05:46] of course
[1:05:47] what you read
[1:05:49] what you look at
[1:05:50] but so to the flesh
[1:05:52] if you go and look at pornography that
[1:05:54] will source in the flesh
[1:05:55] and you'll reap what harvest that comes
[1:05:57] up
[1:05:58] if you read the bible read the word of
[1:06:00] god and study the word of god that will
[1:06:02] suit the spirit
[1:06:03] is the environment you want to be in if
[1:06:05] you're lusting after a woman you're
[1:06:06] lusting after this you want to go and
[1:06:08] scoot for the world just be at the edge
[1:06:10] there in your dress in your way and
[1:06:13] compromising in the conversation
[1:06:15] yeah you could sow to the flesh and you
[1:06:18] could switch to the spirit i mean say it
[1:06:19] again you can sow
[1:06:21] to the flesh
[1:06:23] and you could sow to the spirit
[1:06:25] you mean is that real of course
[1:06:27] that has nothing to do with what is
[1:06:29] preaching behind the pulpit
[1:06:31] that has to do with you applying the
[1:06:34] word to your heart
[1:06:35] and getting the results from it
[1:06:38] so so that brings it personal now you
[1:06:41] understand what i'm saying this is not a
[1:06:43] big complicated mystery and to give you
[1:06:45] a headache and you don't understand it
[1:06:46] and you're catching it and whatnot no
[1:06:48] this is the scriptures this is the
[1:06:50] foundation that we are built upon the
[1:06:53] apostles and the doctrine of the
[1:06:54] apostles this is the foundation of it
[1:06:57] but i say make yourself a christian
[1:07:01] make yourself a christian i can give you
[1:07:03] a scripture his wife had made herself
[1:07:05] ready
[1:07:07] make yourself ready
[1:07:08] get ready be ready and stay ready
[1:07:11] make yourself a christian could we see
[1:07:13] amen tonight oh blessed be in the name
[1:07:15] of the lord
[1:07:17] so what he that swear to his flesh
[1:07:19] shall the flesh reap corruption he that
[1:07:22] swore to the spirit shall the spirit
[1:07:23] read life everlasting let us not be wary
[1:07:26] in
[1:07:27] for in due season we shall reap if we
[1:07:30] faint not
[1:07:32] as we have therefore opportunity
[1:07:34] let us do good unto all men
[1:07:36] especially them
[1:07:38] who are the household of faith let's
[1:07:40] read the flow of that in the amplifier
[1:07:42] i'm going to read it straight do not be
[1:07:44] deceived and deluded and misled
[1:07:46] god
[1:07:47] will not allow himself to be sneered at
[1:07:50] scorned
[1:07:51] disdained or mocked by mere pretentions
[1:07:54] or professions or by his precepts being
[1:07:56] set aside
[1:07:58] he inevitably deludes himself who
[1:08:00] attempts to delude god for whatever a
[1:08:02] man souls and that
[1:08:04] only is what he will be
[1:08:07] for he who sows to his own flesh his
[1:08:09] lower nature sensuality will from the
[1:08:12] flesh rip the key
[1:08:14] and ruin
[1:08:15] and destruction
[1:08:16] but he who sows to the spirit
[1:08:19] will from the spirit reap eternal life
[1:08:22] let us not lose heart and go weary and
[1:08:26] think
[1:08:27] in acting nobly and doing right
[1:08:30] for in due time and at the appointed
[1:08:32] season we shall reap if we do not loosen
[1:08:35] or relax
[1:08:36] our courage and feed
[1:08:39] so then
[1:08:40] as
[1:08:41] occasional opportunity open to earth
[1:08:44] here we go let us do good
[1:08:47] morally to all people
[1:08:49] not only being useful or profitable to
[1:08:51] them
[1:08:52] but also doing what is for their
[1:08:54] spiritual good and advantage be mindful
[1:08:56] to be a blessing there we go especially
[1:08:59] to those of the household of faith those
[1:09:03] who belong to god's family with you the
[1:09:05] believers
[1:09:06] read that last but not least be mindful
[1:09:09] to be a blessing
[1:09:12] especially to those of the household of
[1:09:15] faith
[1:09:16] those who belong to god's family with
[1:09:19] you the believers
[1:09:21] so that is plain and simple
[1:09:23] be extra special to the brethren be
[1:09:27] extra special to the believers become a
[1:09:31] blessing to them
[1:09:33] first peter 2 11
[1:09:35] daily beloved
[1:09:36] i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims
[1:09:40] abstain from fleshly lust
[1:09:42] which war against the soul
[1:09:46] beloved i implore you as aliens and
[1:09:48] strangers and exiles in the world to
[1:09:50] abstain from the essential urges the
[1:09:53] evil desires the passions of the flesh
[1:09:55] your lower nature that wage war
[1:09:58] against the soul
[1:09:59] hebrews 12 you can find this one 14-16
[1:10:02] we read and hebrews 12.
[1:10:04] so you can find
[1:10:06] follow peace with all men and holiness
[1:10:08] without which no man shall see the lord
[1:10:11] looking diligently
[1:10:12] least any man feel of the grace of god i
[1:10:16] wanted to remember since he is talking
[1:10:18] to christians
[1:10:20] he's talking to believers
[1:10:22] so you see all these
[1:10:24] guarantees that men giving men
[1:10:27] about the kingdom of god
[1:10:29] you have to be leery of that
[1:10:31] you have to be careful with that
[1:10:34] he is speaking here
[1:10:36] watch
[1:10:36] looking diligently least
[1:10:39] any man feel of the grace of god lease
[1:10:42] any root of bitterness bringing up
[1:10:44] trouble you and thereby many be defiled
[1:10:47] please there be any fornicator or
[1:10:49] profane as he saw who for one
[1:10:52] morsel of meat soul is good right
[1:10:56] amplifiers that strive to live in peace
[1:10:58] with everybody pursue
[1:11:00] that consecration and holiness without
[1:11:02] which no one will ever see the lord
[1:11:04] exercise foresight
[1:11:06] and be on the watch to look after one
[1:11:08] another
[1:11:09] to see that no one falls back from
[1:11:13] and fails to secure god's grace it's
[1:11:16] unmerited favor and spiritual blessing
[1:11:18] in order
[1:11:20] that no root of resentment ranker
[1:11:23] bitterness or hatred
[1:11:25] shoots forth and causes trouble and
[1:11:27] bitter torment
[1:11:29] and many become contaminated and defiled
[1:11:31] by it oh god have mufi
[1:11:34] and people have done what kind of crazy
[1:11:35] stuff and too easy to hold grudges and
[1:11:38] oat
[1:11:39] i mean
[1:11:40] we're living in perilous times we're
[1:11:42] living in
[1:11:43] dreadful times
[1:11:44] and you know it's easy
[1:11:48] to for people to
[1:11:50] trip you
[1:11:51] upset you to set you back but you have
[1:11:54] to
[1:11:55] guard your heart so to speak
[1:11:57] verse 16 that no one may become guilty
[1:12:00] of sexual advice or become a profane
[1:12:02] godless and sacrifice person
[1:12:05] who sold his own birthright first single
[1:12:08] me
[1:12:09] we're gonna wrap up now you can
[1:12:12] you're almost there luke chapter eight
[1:12:15] some other scripture you can find it
[1:12:20] the greatest storyteller
[1:12:22] is about to speak uh parables just jesus
[1:12:25] you know verse four of luke chapter
[1:12:26] eight
[1:12:27] you're gonna read from four to fifteen
[1:12:30] and when much people were gathered
[1:12:31] together
[1:12:33] and they will come to him out of every
[1:12:34] city he's picked by a parable
[1:12:37] asura went out to sow his seed
[1:12:40] and as he sawed
[1:12:42] some fell by the wayside it was
[1:12:44] strutting down when the fault of the air
[1:12:46] devoured it
[1:12:47] sun fell upon a rock as soon as it was
[1:12:49] sprung up it was it away because like
[1:12:51] moisture
[1:12:52] some fell among thorns the thorns sprang
[1:12:54] up with it choked
[1:12:57] some felon could cry sprung up and bear
[1:12:59] fruit a hundred fool
[1:13:02] and when he had said these things he
[1:13:03] cried he had an essay here let him hear
[1:13:06] and his disciples asked him saying what
[1:13:08] might this problem be
[1:13:10] he said unto you it is given to know the
[1:13:12] mysteries of the kingdom of god but to
[1:13:14] others
[1:13:15] in parables
[1:13:16] that seeing they might not see and
[1:13:18] hearing
[1:13:19] they might not understand
[1:13:21] now the parable is this
[1:13:23] the seed is the word of god
[1:13:25] those by the wayside are they that hear
[1:13:28] and commit the devil taking away the
[1:13:30] word out of their hearts least they
[1:13:33] should believe and received
[1:13:35] so that's wonderful
[1:13:37] beyond the rocket day which when they
[1:13:38] hear receive the will with joy
[1:13:40] these have no roots which for a while
[1:13:42] believe and in time of temptation fall
[1:13:44] away
[1:13:46] they which fell among tones are they
[1:13:48] which when they lived or fought and are
[1:13:50] choked
[1:13:51] with tears
[1:13:54] riches
[1:13:55] pleasure
[1:13:57] of this life
[1:13:58] now this is the tricky one here
[1:14:01] this one is in church
[1:14:04] but choked
[1:14:06] this one is is in church
[1:14:08] but
[1:14:09] they are buddhism with kiers
[1:14:11] good mid riches
[1:14:13] with pleasures of this life and bring no
[1:14:16] and here he defined it no fruit to
[1:14:18] perfection
[1:14:20] was 15
[1:14:22] but that on good ground
[1:14:24] a day which in an honest and good heart
[1:14:26] having heard a word keep it
[1:14:29] and bring forth fruit
[1:14:31] at patience
[1:14:32] now listen to this
[1:14:34] no pastor
[1:14:36] is in charge
[1:14:38] of the heart's operation
[1:14:40] no minister be given that right
[1:14:42] nobody could determine that
[1:14:45] if people
[1:14:46] was determining
[1:14:48] heart condition
[1:14:50] they could have never imagined saul
[1:14:53] would become poor
[1:14:56] so the operation of the heart
[1:14:58] has to be in god
[1:15:01] the woman of the world heart woman
[1:15:03] caught in adultery heart
[1:15:05] all of these things are heart conditions
[1:15:09] they may not like matthew he was a tax
[1:15:11] collector but he was called because his
[1:15:13] name was on the book god saw what was in
[1:15:16] his heart
[1:15:18] you may not like joe's jacob
[1:15:20] because of his strict sin and his
[1:15:22] miserable behavior and
[1:15:25] trying to scheme everybody and scam
[1:15:27] everybody
[1:15:28] that might be going to work with a lot
[1:15:29] of people because esau was a more
[1:15:32] decent man if you could describe it that
[1:15:34] way but
[1:15:35] the bible says
[1:15:37] it's not my opinion jacob i love
[1:15:39] is so i hate
[1:15:42] so ultimately
[1:15:43] the seed is original it's the word
[1:15:46] that can't change
[1:15:48] it have power in it
[1:15:49] it have life in it
[1:15:51] is where that seed falls
[1:15:54] it's the type of heart
[1:15:55] that feels falls in and if you as a
[1:15:58] believer
[1:15:59] have an opportunity tonight
[1:16:01] to say you see the scares these stones
[1:16:04] these tissues whatever is affecting the
[1:16:06] flow of god to you
[1:16:08] through you or by you you want to cut
[1:16:10] off
[1:16:11] you want to deal with
[1:16:12] how about the clothes
[1:16:14] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:16:17] first corinthians 6
[1:16:19] verse 15 to 20 you could find it first
[1:16:21] corinthians 6 15 to 20. as we wrap up
[1:16:26] verse 15 knowing not that your bodies
[1:16:28] are the members of christ
[1:16:30] shall i then take the members of christ
[1:16:32] and make them the members of a harlot
[1:16:34] what forbid
[1:16:35] what
[1:16:36] knowing not that he which is joined to
[1:16:38] an hour is one body
[1:16:40] for two said he is shall be one flesh
[1:16:43] but he that is joined unto the lord is
[1:16:45] one spirit
[1:16:47] free fornication
[1:16:50] every sin that a man do it is without
[1:16:52] the body
[1:16:53] but he that fornicated
[1:16:55] he's a commit fornication sin it
[1:16:58] against his own body
[1:17:00] what
[1:17:02] know you not that your body
[1:17:05] is the temple of the holy ghost which is
[1:17:07] in you
[1:17:08] which you have of god
[1:17:09] which you are not your own
[1:17:11] for you are bored with a price
[1:17:14] therefore
[1:17:15] glorify god
[1:17:17] in your body
[1:17:19] and in your spirit which are gone
[1:17:22] yes we haven't amplified that really
[1:17:23] flowing
[1:17:24] do you not see and know that your bodies
[1:17:26] are members but be part of christ the
[1:17:29] messiah
[1:17:30] am i therefore to take the parts of
[1:17:31] christ and make them part of a
[1:17:33] prostitute never never
[1:17:35] or do you not know and realize that when
[1:17:37] a man draws himself to prostitute he
[1:17:39] becomes one body better the two it is
[1:17:41] written shall become one flesh but the
[1:17:44] person who is united to the lord becomes
[1:17:46] one spirit with him
[1:17:47] shun immorality
[1:17:49] and all
[1:17:50] all
[1:17:52] sexual looseness
[1:17:54] flee
[1:17:54] from impurity and thought
[1:17:57] word or deed
[1:17:59] any other sin which a man commits is
[1:18:01] one outside the body
[1:18:03] but he who commits sexual immorality
[1:18:06] sins against his own body do you not
[1:18:09] know
[1:18:09] that your body
[1:18:11] is the temple the very sanctuary of the
[1:18:13] holy spirit who lives within you whom
[1:18:16] you receive as a gift from god you're
[1:18:18] not your own
[1:18:19] you were bored with a price purchased
[1:18:21] with a preciousness and paid for
[1:18:24] made his own so then honor god here we
[1:18:26] go and bring glory to him
[1:18:29] in
[1:18:30] your
[1:18:31] body

[1:18:34] but in your body tea that in the flesh
[1:18:37] cannot
[1:18:38] please god okay
[1:18:40] so i believe we're on the final page
[1:18:42] yeah we're gonna find a page right now
[1:18:45] romans 12
[1:18:48] i beseech you there for brethren by the
[1:18:50] mercies of god
[1:18:52] that you present your bodies
[1:18:54] a living sacrifice
[1:18:56] holy
[1:18:58] acceptable
[1:18:59] unto god which is a real reasonable
[1:19:01] service
[1:19:02] and be not conformed to this world
[1:19:04] but be transformed
[1:19:06] by the renewing of your mind
[1:19:08] that you may prove what is that good
[1:19:11] acceptable and perfect will of god
[1:19:13] i appeal to you therefore brethren the
[1:19:15] amplified and beg of you in view of all
[1:19:17] the mercies of god to make a decisive
[1:19:21] dedication of your bodies
[1:19:23] presenting all your members and
[1:19:24] faculties as a living sacrifice holy
[1:19:28] devoted consecrated well pleasing to god
[1:19:31] which is a reasonable rational
[1:19:33] intelligence service and spiritual
[1:19:34] worship
[1:19:35] do not conform to this world this age
[1:19:37] fashion after and adapt it to external
[1:19:40] to official customs
[1:19:42] but be transformed the change by the
[1:19:44] entire renewal of your mind
[1:19:46] by its new ideals its new attitude so
[1:19:49] that you may prove
[1:19:51] for yourselves what is the good and
[1:19:54] acceptable and perfect will of god
[1:19:56] even the thing which is good and
[1:19:57] acceptable and perfect in a sight for
[1:19:59] you
[1:20:00] and our final scripture tonight
[1:20:02] is hebrews 11 5 and 6. i'll read this
[1:20:06] one by faith enoch was translated you
[1:20:08] should not see that and was not found
[1:20:10] because god had translated him
[1:20:12] for before his translation he had this
[1:20:14] testimony that he pleased god
[1:20:17] without faith
[1:20:18] this is impossible to please him for he
[1:20:20] that cometh to god
[1:20:22] must believe that he is
[1:20:24] and that he is a reward of them
[1:20:26] that diligently seek oh blessed be the
[1:20:28] name of the lord this is
[1:20:30] this is um i i i i was really blessed to
[1:20:34] share this with you tonight and i trust
[1:20:36] that you were blessed the way i have
[1:20:38] been blessed
[1:20:39] in studying it
[1:20:40] and and bringing it to you
[1:20:42] enoch please
[1:20:44] god he was wrapped in material
[1:20:48] he had faith
[1:20:50] he was in the spirit
[1:20:52] he was walking in the spirit
[1:20:54] dealers in the flesh cannot please god
[1:20:56] it has no rocket for them
[1:20:59] if you want to stay in the flesh
[1:21:01] the tribulation is guaranteed
[1:21:03] i'm telling you
[1:21:05] it's not a perhaps it's not a suggestion
[1:21:06] it's an option
[1:21:08] civilization
[1:21:09] guarantee
[1:21:11] you have to walk in the spirit
[1:21:13] you have to come into the spirit
[1:21:15] if you want to be among the tribulation
[1:21:17] scenes you have thousands of toastmen
[1:21:19] people that sit on this message for
