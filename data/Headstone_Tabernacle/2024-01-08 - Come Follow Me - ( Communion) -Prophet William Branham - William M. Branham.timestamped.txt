[16:11] Jesus we are grateful for this time to
[16:16] know that we're assembled here the young
[16:18] and
[16:19] old and the
[16:22] middle-aged and we have
[16:25] assembled the side of Eternity
[16:29] once more to speak about you and about
[16:32] the things that pertains to everlasting
[16:37] life these young ones sitting in here
[16:41] tonight some of them are graduating some
[16:43] is already
[16:45] graduated but I realized Lord something
[16:49] had
[16:50] happened just a few hours before that
[16:53] great shock or great blast had taken
[16:56] place in the mountain up there north of
[16:59] Tucson when the angels of the Lord came
[17:03] down I remember what was said and and
[17:07] especially about the young
[17:08] people I pray the Lord help us to
[17:12] understand and may I'll be able to say
[17:15] something to these young folks tonight
[17:17] that'll help them along the journey for
[17:20] Lord we all need that help at this time
[17:24] bless us together forgive our sins and
[17:26] if anything that we've done since we've
[17:27] been out here that's displeased you we
[17:30] pray you forgive us for it for we
[17:32] realize
[17:34] today that we have no no guarantee of
[17:39] Tomorrow we don't know what tomorrow
[17:42] brings we must be prepare today to meet
[17:46] tomorrow and father God there's only one
[17:48] way that we know to do this that's to
[17:51] prepare to see you for by and by we
[17:54] realize that we are all going to do it
[17:57] and we've got to meet it some
[17:59] sometime either in peace as a friend or
[18:02] child or as an enemy far be it Lord that
[18:06] we be anything else but your own beloved
[18:08] children Grant these things we ask in
[18:11] Jesus name
[18:13] amen today while I was chopping weeds
[18:16] really early this morning I found a
[18:18] place in the Bible I thought would be a
[18:19] good thing to
[18:21] read at this time and it's uh may not be
[18:26] too dashing appropriate but I thought
[18:28] this for just a just a few minutes to
[18:30] talk and we'll read this out of the 18th
[18:33] chapter of St Luke all four gospel
[18:36] writers right of it the 18th chapter and
[18:39] the 18th
[18:41] verse and a certain ruler asked him
[18:43] saying good Master what shall I do to
[18:46] inherit eternal life and Jesus said unto
[18:48] him why callest thou me
[18:51] good none is good save one that is God
[18:56] th knowest the Commandments do not
[18:58] commit adultery do not kill do not steal
[19:01] do not bear false witness honor thy
[19:05] father and
[19:07] mother he said all these have I done and
[19:10] kept them from my youth
[19:12] up now when Jesus heard these things he
[19:16] said unto him yet lackest thou one thing
[19:20] sell all thou has and
[19:23] distribute unto the poor Thou shalt have
[19:26] Treasures in Heaven
[19:28] come follow
[19:31] me I think the word come follow
[19:36] me that' be the best advice I could give
[19:39] if I was talking to 10,000 kids or if I
[19:42] was talking to just what I am it's a
[19:45] command and the greatest thing that I
[19:47] think was ever offered anybody and
[19:50] especially a young
[19:51] person follow
[19:53] me you're going to follow
[19:56] somebody uh you just can you remember
[19:59] that you're going to follow
[20:01] somebody and the way you follow the
[20:04] person be sure that who this person's
[20:08] following see we Paul one time said be
[20:12] followers of me as I am of Christ
[20:14] another word just as I follow Christ you
[20:15] follow
[20:17] me and now at this turning point this
[20:22] this stage of life where we all come and
[20:25] many times you've heard me holler Ricky
[20:27] Retta and things that it's the age it's
[20:30] the age that we're living in it really
[20:34] isn't those
[20:35] people those people are people like we
[20:37] are those kids out here these hot rods
[20:40] running up and down the street and
[20:41] carrying all the way they are smoking
[20:43] cigarettes and drinking liquor girls
[20:45] dress in Marley and thing them girls and
[20:47] boys like we are see they're human they
[20:51] love they eat they drink they sleep they
[20:55] breathe they got to die they people just
[20:58] like we
[21:00] are and yet they have been uh they've
[21:03] been possessed of an evil spirit they
[21:06] don't know
[21:07] it not because of of the people but
[21:10] because sometimes some leader that
[21:12] they've been following have let them in
[21:14] the wrong
[21:15] road now you girls and boys know better
[21:17] than that you know you've been taught
[21:19] better than that got better parents
[21:21] Sounder training and to do a thing like
[21:24] that you know
[21:25] better but they don't see because the
[21:27] church that they go to uh are modern
[21:30] churches modernistic and they they just
[21:33] live for the day more poer and oh my
[21:36] what's the morals become virtue to them
[21:39] see so they what is it said one time in
[21:43] a play that I seen down here not long
[21:45] ago of Sodom and Gomorrah that
[21:48] uh evil possessed woman said to the lot
[21:52] what you call uh immoral I call
[21:56] virtue Jesus said as it was in the days
[21:59] of Noah so will it be at the coming of
[22:01] the son of man so we're back to that
[22:03] place
[22:04] again let's look at this fell for a few
[22:06] minutes that we read
[22:08] about no doubt that this kid was born in
[22:11] a good
[22:12] home like you kids
[22:14] are he's brought up with good parents
[22:17] because it proved it when Jesus uh
[22:20] presented to him the Commandments of God
[22:22] he said I've kept these s of Youth it
[22:25] showed that he had he had been he had
[22:27] been brought up
[22:29] right he wasn't just a snatch out and
[22:32] you know he he had been brought up to
[22:34] know what right kids like you all are
[22:37] probably come up under a God-fearing
[22:38] Mother and Daddy to tr to to teach him
[22:41] right when he was a
[22:43] kid well that's good maybe he a a little
[22:46] baby his mother uh had high Ambitions of
[22:50] him being a great man Som days his
[22:51] father's worth money that could School
[22:53] him and and get him an education that he
[22:56] could he'd come out with with a good
[22:58] education to be able to be something in
[23:01] the
[23:01] world and with the sincerity of this
[23:04] mother and
[23:05] dad uh educating this
[23:08] kid and perhaps come to his graduation
[23:12] time like you are see the time when he
[23:15] passed through his school and had his
[23:18] education no doubt it perhaps was a
[23:21] pride and joy of of that mother and
[23:23] daddy's
[23:24] life no doubt in them days he had a fine
[23:29] horses like you have
[23:31] automobiles a good dad and mother like
[23:34] you all got that cease toat you got a
[23:35] good clothes and and a car and can just
[23:40] enjoy life just something like you have
[23:44] today and the father and mother with the
[23:46] praying constantly that that their son
[23:49] would not turn out just an ordinary man
[23:51] that he'd be an extraordinary man all
[23:54] parents want that did you hear Jesus
[23:56] refer to that commandment honor the
[23:58] father and mother and
[24:02] stop and that's the ambition of any
[24:04] parent to do the best for their children
[24:06] to can educate them give them things
[24:09] maybe they wasn't able to get that's
[24:12] what I feel about my children I think
[24:14] sometime in going to
[24:16] school I think send Becky and Sarah and
[24:19] Joseph into these high schools and
[24:21] things were all this go on that I think
[24:25] I'll take them and get back into the
[24:26] mountain and and and raise them up there
[24:28] they like the Indians live but here's
[24:32] what it is what's in the kids going to
[24:35] come
[24:36] out no matter where it is it's got It's
[24:39] going to come out if it's evil in there
[24:41] it'll come out in the Indian
[24:43] Camp is good in there it'll come out in
[24:45] any Camp see it's what's in the kid the
[24:48] makeup of the
[24:50] kid what's on the inside of you and what
[24:52] you are now is what you probably be the
[24:54] rest of your life you're on the changing
[24:57] spot do you know
[24:59] one 86% of the conversions to Jesus
[25:03] Christ is done before 21 years
[25:06] old shows the statistic shows it 86%
[25:10] that come to Christ come before they're
[25:12] 21 you if you pass that age you become
[25:15] more molded or set in your ways well
[25:18] it's possible sure they come 70 and 80
[25:20] years old but it's very rare you make
[25:23] yourself when you're young you set your
[25:26] Ambitions to what you want to do do and
[25:28] what you're trying to achieve in life
[25:31] you think of it and as you think of
[25:33] course your mind is presented into your
[25:36] mind by an unknown something and it
[25:38] dominates your mind and then when it
[25:40] becomes in your mind then you speak it
[25:42] that you're going to do it then your
[25:43] Ambitions drive you to
[25:45] it so mother and father expecting this
[25:49] young man to his Ambitions to be great
[25:53] enough money to carry it
[25:55] out and then no doubt prayed that this
[25:58] this young lad would would get that
[26:01] opportunity you see they they had done
[26:04] all they could
[26:05] do he'd maybe having fine horses and and
[26:09] maybe he very popular amongst the women
[26:11] and if what would go for a man would be
[26:12] for woman vice versa see because we're
[26:15] talk by human life Souls both men and
[26:20] women and then after all this
[26:23] opportunity the boy had see he become on
[26:25] Easy Street we' call him on a place
[26:28] where he he didn't have to worry about
[26:30] too much his parents had money he had he
[26:33] has very he become a
[26:35] ruler the Bible refers to it here the as
[26:40] a Young Rich Young
[26:42] Ruler and we see at a young age maybe in
[26:46] his teenage just out of school just out
[26:49] of graduation maybe a few weeks before
[26:51] something he become a he's a
[26:54] ruler and uh he had all it Hearts could
[26:58] desire and the boy wasn't no modern
[27:01] Ricky he's a fine
[27:03] kid I believe when Luke wrote about it
[27:06] or Mark I believe it was Jesus looked at
[27:09] him inside because he loved
[27:11] him there's something about the kid
[27:14] there was a nice
[27:15] personality hook with his kid where didd
[27:18] he come from out of a nice family who
[27:20] had taught him the Commandments of God
[27:21] and seen that he kept him and he did it
[27:24] from his youth up and the boy had an
[27:26] ambition he wanted eternal life he said
[27:29] a good Master what could I do to inherit
[27:32] eternal
[27:34] life see with all you got in the world
[27:36] yet the Soul on the inside of you tells
[27:38] you there's something that you need that
[27:41] you haven't got just by wealth or it
[27:43] always had to be wealth it could be
[27:45] popper some pretty girl she's got her
[27:47] beauty that she can think of maybe she's
[27:49] very popper in school maybe the boy can
[27:51] get any girl he wants he feels it he's
[27:53] kind of secured that's not security
[27:56] that'll fade just like like the flower
[27:58] in the field See it'll go won't be long
[28:01] just a few turns of sun that's gone then
[28:03] you got a soul that has to live
[28:06] eternally and this young kid must had a
[28:09] nice personality because he presented
[28:11] himself to the Lord Jesus name he bow
[28:13] upon his knee he said good Master what
[28:16] could I do to have eternal life he said
[28:18] why do you call me good said when you
[28:20] know there's only one good and that's
[28:22] God see what the young man Express in
[28:24] this that he was God see
[28:28] he said you thou knowest the
[28:29] Commandments keep them said say what
[28:32] Commandments Master he said the
[28:34] Commandments of honor the father and
[28:36] mother and so forth he said this I've
[28:38] done from youth up see I've did this he
[28:41] said yet you're liking one thing go sell
[28:43] what you have and distribute to the poor
[28:45] and follow
[28:46] me what an opportunity that could have
[28:49] been Peter James or John on the lamb see
[28:53] the kid have been trained and brought
[28:56] upright and and been presented to Christ
[28:59] to use him and all the potential that he
[29:03] had in him to use probably
[29:06] educated Young Rich influenced where he
[29:11] could have presented the gospel and yet
[29:13] turned it
[29:14] down what a what a rational thing that
[29:18] was for that young boy see follow me I
[29:23] see you had to follow someone now he had
[29:25] to either follow the influence of the
[29:27] people he's associated
[29:29] with the influence of some young
[29:32] lady the some influence of a gang of
[29:35] boys that he has associated with his
[29:36] colleagues in
[29:37] school or follow Jesus
[29:41] Christ and all of his goodness yet he
[29:44] knew he didn't have eternal
[29:46] life kids that's what you got to think
[29:48] about see now look at the boy tonight
[29:52] what he could have been and what he
[29:55] is what he is tonight he's somewhere
[29:57] he's a man he he's somewhere he's
[30:00] waiting a judgment he's waiting to face
[30:03] the Judgment at that day turning down
[30:06] the same opportunities presented to you
[30:08] kids almost under the same
[30:12] circumstance fine kids good personality
[30:16] fine fathers and mothers what you have
[30:19] don't even have to workless you want
[30:22] to
[30:25] see but there's something else that goes
[30:27] with that that's something goes with
[30:30] that that word tonight Never

[30:36] young man every young woman follow me
[30:40] see words don't die whenever you speak

[32:22] Magnetic Tape until it's alive
[32:26] again not only that but everything that
[32:28] we say is alive every word that we speak
[32:31] cannot die coming through the room is
[32:34] words now forms of people television

[32:38] then hear you around the world that same
[32:40] second even before you can hear it in

[32:52] that you make you've got to meet it at
[32:54] the Judgment see so young fell it's a
[33:00] good thing to stop think about these
[33:02] things see because you going to meet it
[33:05] again let's trace this young man the
[33:07] opportunity he had and put yourself in
[33:09] his
[33:10] place and know girl this same as is
[33:13] Becky
[33:15] Maryland just like just the same as you
[33:18] stand in his place and you can hear that
[33:20] voice which is still
[33:22] alive it's still alive it's still moving
[33:25] science says in 20 years now they pi up
[33:27] his literal voice that he spoke 2,000
[33:29] years ago it's still alive like a pebble
[33:32] Dr in the ocean the wave never ceases it
[33:35] goes to the shore thousands of miles and
[33:38] turns back when a voice is once spoke
[33:41] into the air like that it never
[33:43] dies there ain't nothing you can say the
[33:45] judgment is right there there will be
[33:47] the voice of Jesus Christ bidding that
[33:49] young man follow
[33:52] me and him turning away on the screen
[33:56] sorry because he had great
[33:58] possession see we might not be always
[34:01] has to be money it can be other things
[34:04] see anything we hold dear then we do
[34:06] that call see it becomes lack of money
[34:10] to us it becomes something that corrupts
[34:12] us now let's follow him a little bit
[34:15] what happens when he turns away he
[34:17] didn't listen to that voice of Christ he
[34:20] want with his friends which you kids
[34:23] you're all fine kids and you bound to
[34:25] have friends but watch what kind of
[34:28] friend you have if that friend's
[34:30] following Christ go with that friend
[34:33] follow Christ too but if it don't don't
[34:35] do it let's look at him we find out he
[34:38] perhaps kept his friends he become a
[34:40] great ruler he was a ruler then later we
[34:43] find him so prosperous until he he had
[34:47] to build extra barns to put his stuff in
[34:51] and then he said to himself after he got
[34:52] old and he cares of young life and
[34:55] things has P all he done maybe was
[34:58] entertain and when an old man or an old
[35:00] woman like
[35:02] me my wife your mothers and dad there
[35:05] isn't hardly anything that they can
[35:07] think of they can't don't want to get
[35:09] out and and run up and down the streets
[35:11] you know as young fellas would young
[35:13] women dates and who's going to be your
[35:15] wife or your husband or see they don't
[35:17] have that in their mind they they got
[35:19] children they're interested that's going
[35:21] to be you all tomorrow if there is a
[35:25] tomorrow and uh see the fellow then with
[35:30] maybe maybe he never even got
[35:33] married and however he was a great ruler
[35:37] and he set up on and as is in Jerusalem
[35:39] yet today they eat on the housetop this
[35:41] time of day when it gets cool out the
[35:44] evening and we find another character
[35:47] pictured with him a beggar and the man
[35:50] from being
[35:52] raised uh to honor the neighbor and do
[35:56] un others is have others to do unto you
[35:59] see by rejecting that call of Christ
[36:01] finally look like a boy been raised in a
[36:03] home like that that would never got away
[36:05] from him but it
[36:06] did it did and there laid a man at the
[36:11] gate by the name of Lazarus begging him
[36:13] for food and vainly he would have eat
[36:16] the crumbs that he swept off not even to
[36:18] the beggar but to the
[36:21] dogs and was full of sores but the man
[36:24] had been so Polished in society then he
[36:26] had no more feelings he become numb
[36:29] because he' rejected that offer of
[36:32] Christ and maybe one evening this time
[36:35] making his toast with Fine Wines and
[36:37] lovely women's jeweled around him and
[36:39] things like that with all his Hearts
[36:41] could desire and toasting a bler laying
[36:44] at the gate and before daylight dawned
[36:46] the next morning he was in Hell
[36:48] screaming for that Lazar to come put
[36:50] water on his
[36:52] tongue the Chang of the
[36:55] scene and you know Noti when he said
[36:58] Father Abraham now he still remembered
[37:01] that Abraham was the father of the Jews
[37:04] he said Father Abraham sand that beggar
[37:07] Lazarus down here's a little water on
[37:08] his fingers to put on my lips these
[37:10] Flames are tormenting and he said uh and
[37:14] Abraham said it's I can't do that in so
[37:17] many words and besides all this you see
[37:21] you had your opportunity in
[37:23] life when did he have it when Jesus said
[37:27] follow me but he turned it down he went
[37:31] the way that he could make money and
[37:33] that's all right nothing wrong with
[37:34] making money but follow Jesus while
[37:36] you're doing it see and he'd went the
[37:38] other way with a
[37:40] crowd and you find out he said Abraham
[37:43] said and besides all this there's a gulf
[37:45] fixed between you and
[37:47] he that no man has ever crossed over and
[37:51] never
[37:52] will them that are there cannot come
[37:55] here and these here cannot go there
[37:57] it's been fixed no man has Cross or will
[37:59] cross now listen to him he wants to be
[38:02] an evangelist then the call that Jesus
[38:05] had given him to to follow him had and
[38:09] to be a soul iner as a Young Man
[38:12] returned to him
[38:13] again he remembered it that he had five
[38:18] brothers and back on Earth and he didn't
[38:21] want man in that place he said send
[38:24] Lazarus then back to tell my brothers
[38:26] not to come this way in other words
[38:30] accept the call of follow
[38:34] me but he said they they won't do it he
[38:37] said yes if one would raise from the
[38:39] dead like Lazarus and go back and tell
[38:41] him you see it shows that after we die
[38:44] you're still conscious he remembered
[38:47] Abraham said Son remember in your
[38:50] days see you still remember you don't
[38:53] lose your memory you remember and the me
[38:56] memories that man could have and still
[38:58] in the same place remembered the
[39:01] opportunity he had of hearing Jesus say
[39:04] follow me but he followed the wrong
[39:07] person the wrong crowd he got in the
[39:09] wrong crowd and went to the wrong place
[39:12] end up in the wrong eternity be
[39:15] annihilated at that day from God
[39:20] forever Jesus also said a great striking
[39:23] word though one raised from the dead and
[39:25] go back yet they would not be persuaded
[39:27] because they've got Moses and the law
[39:29] and if they won't hear that then they
[39:33] won't hear though one would be raised
[39:35] from the dead they will not be
[39:37] persuaded why why do the law speak
[39:40] something like that yes do to others as
[39:43] you'd have them do unto you and he had
[39:44] lived under the law but he let the
[39:47] beggar die at the gate see he he had
[39:50] lived under the Commandments of God and
[39:51] yet failed to see that great eternal
[39:53] life kids each one seem like
[39:57] mine you each one seem like it's my sons
[40:01] and daughters in one way you
[40:03] are spiritually
[40:05] speaking that's right the Lord God has
[40:09] has put your souls into my care because
[40:12] you come listen to me you believe me and
[40:15] in one sense words you are my sons and
[40:18] daughters that's
[40:20] right and always
[40:23] remember keeping the Commandments of God
[40:25] is a great thing
[40:27] being raised in a good home is a
[40:29] Heritage from
[40:32] God and to be fine kids with
[40:34] personalities as you have good wonderful
[40:38] to have an
[40:39] education it's wonderful to even live in
[40:41] this free land we got a many things to
[40:44] be thankful for but there's one thing
[40:48] that you just don't
[40:49] inherit you've got to accept
[40:52] it that's eternal life and you only do
[40:55] that by following following Jesus by a
[40:57] born again
[41:00] experience don't neglect that a little
[41:03] story one time I heard of a man who was
[41:08] all he was poor and he he always wanted
[41:11] to it's a little fairy story like always
[41:14] stuck with me
[41:15] though and one day he picked a flower
[41:17] and the flower was magic and the flower
[41:21] answered to him and said you've been
[41:23] poor all your life he said now
[41:27] um ask what you will and it'll be given
[41:30] to you he said that yonder's mountain
[41:32] would open up and I could go there
[41:35] in and find the gold in the mountain
[41:40] well the he said you'll have to take me
[41:43] with you wherever you
[41:45] go see you'll have to take me with
[41:48] you so wherever I
[41:51] am then you can ask what you will he
[41:55] walked to the mountain and the mountain
[41:57] opened up and he went in the shells was
[41:59] full of gold and diamonds as the little
[42:02] fairy story goes he laid the flower down
[42:05] on a on a table or a rock and he run and
[42:08] grabbed a great big
[42:10] Gem and he um said I must go show this
[42:14] to my friends and now I'm a rich man I
[42:17] have everything now I must show this and
[42:20] so the flower spoke but said you have
[42:23] forgot the main thing
[42:26] so he runs back and picks up said well
[42:29] uh maybe I'll I'll get a piece of gold I
[42:31] get a piece of
[42:33] silver and so he said uh I'll uh I'll
[42:37] hurry out to tell the people how rich I
[42:40] am what all I've got and he got to the
[42:43] door and the flower said but you forgot
[42:47] the main thing so he runs back again he
[42:50] said in here we find all kinds of
[42:52] materials so he picked up a stone he he
[42:56] said I'll go take this Stone and show
[42:58] the people what kind of a stone this
[42:59] Mountain's made out of so I can find my
[43:01] way back to it see and he started out
[43:03] the door and the flower said for the
[43:06] it's final time you have forgot the main
[43:09] thing oh he said oh shut up see he
[43:13] didn't want to hear it anymore forgot
[43:14] the main thing and he ran out the door
[43:17] and when he did the door closed behind
[43:20] him with the flower on the
[43:22] inside the main thing was the
[43:24] flower see
[43:26] the main thing was the flower years ago
[43:31] as a kid as you all
[43:32] are here cattle ranch above here above
[43:36] Phoenix I was reading a piece of
[43:38] prospect a paper about a prospector then
[43:41] there was no rades through here then
[43:43] this little sand path they still do a
[43:45] lot of prospecting in here you know but
[43:48] this prospector had come in and he found
[43:50] a lot of money and he struck a lot of
[43:53] gold and on his rode in he stayed in a
[43:55] cabin he' found and he had a dog with
[43:58] him and uh the dog tied up on the
[44:02] outside and that night had been an out
[44:06] fony to get this gold he picked it up
[44:09] from the old Spanish
[44:11] mindes and he was um coming in with it
[44:14] and uh the dog started barking and the
[44:17] man didn't want to be bothered with that
[44:18] dog he said uh shut
[44:22] up he said tomorrow I'll take this into
[44:26] to to the city and morals the story was
[44:29] this and I'll have it uh weighed up and
[44:34] I'll be a rich man and I'll buy great
[44:36] cars and I'll have all kinds of women
[44:39] and big parties and I'll be a rich man
[44:42] because I've already struck the claim
[44:45] I've got the gold here much of it and
[44:48] said ah and while he was trying to go to
[44:51] sleep the dog kept barking because the
[44:52] dog
[44:54] seen the outlaw coming up spping up
[44:57] waiting for the prospector to go to
[44:59] sleep he raised up again and screamed at
[45:02] the dog again said shut up the poor dog
[45:05] whin and tried to warn his master the
[45:08] danger was aler
[45:11] lurking and when he the next time when
[45:14] the dog started barking the prospector
[45:16] had a shotgun he didn't want to be
[45:18] bothered so he just raised up and shot
[45:19] the
[45:21] dog and the prospector was killed that
[45:24] night by the outlaw
[45:26] all his fancy dreams done him no good
[45:29] why he still the voice that was warning
[45:34] him there's nobody can try to do
[45:37] anything your kids would never be able
[45:39] to do anything wrong after being raised
[45:41] the way you are unless you feel
[45:44] something tell you not to do
[45:46] it I don't never steal that voice that's
[45:50] warning you and always remember accept
[45:53] that voice that
[45:54] said follow
[45:57] me and you'll always come out right I
[46:00] believe you will I got confidence in you
[46:03] but just always remember at Jesus that
[46:06] voice is alive in the Earth tonight just
[46:09] the same as every voice and every word
[46:11] we spoke is still alive when that voice
[46:14] goes out on that ether wave of the air
[46:16] the see you got a transmitter here that
[46:18] sends it out you are the transmitter
[46:21] that sends it out now it takes a station
[46:23] to pick it up and Jesus was a
[46:26] transmitter of God's word for he was the
[46:31] the triun of God manifested in one man
[46:36] he was complete God and complete man and
[46:40] the Trinity of God the Trinity of the
[46:43] attributes of God as being Father Son
[46:45] and Holy Spirit was represented in that
[46:47] one man Jesus Christ so there he was the
[46:51] word and he was the transmitter that
[46:54] said he that heareth my word
[46:56] words and believeth on him that sent me
[46:58] has eternal life
[47:01] see verely I say unto you he that
[47:04] heareth my words and believeth on him
[47:06] that sent me hath eternal life now that
[47:09] words went out from a
[47:11] transmitter he said one day verily I say
[47:14] unto you if you say to this mountain be
[47:15] moved and don't doubt in your heart but
[47:17] believe that what you have said will
[47:19] come to pass you can have what you said
[47:22] now if you can just be the station to
[47:25] pick that up
[47:26] by the some control inside of you by
[47:30] faith it'll move you right into the
[47:33] cycle of God to the new birth and be
[47:34] born again then you'll always be in
[47:37] contact to hear that voice that'll
[47:39] always warn you when dangers along when
[47:41] things are wrong going wrong it'll
[47:43] always be a warning to you and then
[47:46] instead of someday being like that rich
[47:48] young boy that we're speaking of be a
[47:51] man like Apostle Peter Paul or somebody
[47:54] that one souls for Jesus Jesus Christ
[47:56] you do that kids can we pray Lord
[48:03] Jesus youth men and women for tomorrow
[48:07] if there is a tomorrow we must train
[48:09] them Lord we feel that burden to train
[48:12] them like there will be a tomorrow if
[48:15] there is not then today is the
[48:19] day and then father we
[48:22] know that no one is accepted in your
[48:26] sight no flesh can Glory no education
[48:30] although as good as these things may be
[48:33] no good works no religious institution
[48:36] no
[48:37] psychology no nothing can confirm God
[48:42] but the Holy Spirit he's the instrument
[48:46] God himself in a form of eternal
[48:49] life that can come to us as an
[48:53] individual we're thankful for this
[48:56] truly is expressed when Peter made the
[48:59] confession Jesus said to him flesh and
[49:01] blood has not revealed this to you you
[49:03] never learned it in a seminary you never
[49:05] learned it in some school it's a

[57:12] amen verse 23 for I have received of the
[57:16] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[57:19] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[57:22] in which he was betrayed took bread
[57:26] and when he had given thanks he broke it
[57:27] and said take eat this is my body which
[57:31] is broken for you this do in remembrance
[57:35] of
[57:36] me after the same manner also he took
[57:39] the cup when he had SED saying this cup
[57:43] is the New Testament in my blood this do
[57:46] ye as often as you drink it in
[57:48] remembrance of
[57:49] me for as often as you eat this bread
[57:52] and drink this cup ye do sh the Lord 's
[57:55] death till he
[57:57] comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[58:00] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[58:02] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[58:05] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[58:08] examine himself and so let him eat of
[58:11] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[58:14] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[58:17] eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself
[58:20] not Discerning the Lord's body for this
[58:23] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[58:26] and and many sleep but if we would judge
[58:29] ourselves we should not be judged but
