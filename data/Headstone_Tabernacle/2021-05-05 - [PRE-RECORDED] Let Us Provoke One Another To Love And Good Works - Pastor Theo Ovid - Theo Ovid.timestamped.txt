[16:14] from the presence of the lord and went
[16:16] down to dropper
[16:17] and he found the ship going to tashish
[16:20] so he paid the fear thereof and went

[17:46] the question i have to ask

[17:58] god three words two pieces three words
[18:01] god expect results
[18:06] and two action is
[18:09] caused
[18:13] god expect results and action
[18:18] is caused you know you hear but imam
[18:20] said you got to do something for
[18:22] something to happen
[18:23] you have to throw up a rock and then
[18:25] whirlwind something happened
[18:26] you've got to do something for something
[18:28] to happen the axe told jesus
[18:31] that the wine ran out he said fill some
[18:34] pots and draw water you got to do
[18:36] something
[18:37] your car just said there is no wine
[18:39] there is no wine saying there was no
[18:40] wine wouldn't produce wine
[18:42] he said get some water in that pot and
[18:45] then we could do something with what we
[18:46] do
[18:47] we have water water is potentially
[18:49] convert to wine i just i just bypass the
[18:51] pressing the grapes i'll bypass
[18:52] all the process and when you're poor
[18:54] you'll get mine could somebody say amen

[18:58] with something to work with
[19:01] the people are hungry five thousand to
[19:02] be fed what do you have
[19:04] oh well we have a little boy with five
[19:06] loaves and two fishes that's good enough
[19:08] that's good enough because we have
[19:10] something we could start with
[19:12] because if we could only get started
[19:14] come on now
[19:16] god said god will do the rest say
[19:21] god will do the rest give the lord a
[19:22] shout
[19:26] hallelujah if we can only get started
[19:31] if we can only get started god will do
[19:34] the rest
[19:34] if we could get started you must want to
[19:37] get started
[19:38] you can't sit there you must want to get
[19:40] started
[19:41] and action is caused accent don't just
[19:44] happen

[19:47] happen
[19:48] oh glory to god hallelujah are you with
[19:50] me glory to god amen
[19:53] all right let's get down in the word now
[19:57] patmo's vision but the branham was

[20:00] of christ here white as well he was
[20:03] explaining it talking about daniel
[20:05] ancient of days
[20:06] a judgment was set now i want to ask you
[20:09] something i'm speaking to you
[20:11] lukewarm church 10 virgins went out to
[20:13] meet the lord
[20:15] five of them wise five foolish
[20:18] now watch the books was open daniel 7
[20:21] 9. the books were open
[20:25] that's the book of the sinner and
[20:27] another book was open
[20:29] who came with him the church from the
[20:31] rapture
[20:32] 10 thousand times thousands times
[20:34] thousands with him
[20:35] minister to him that's his wife
[20:39] that's the bride amen listen everybody
[20:41] will be accounted for
[20:43] [Music]
[20:45] i don't care who they feel they are how
[20:48] rich they are
[20:49] how powerful they are everyone will be
[20:52] accounted for
[20:53] because there's a book and that book
[20:56] have names
[20:57] and whether you feel you're in it or not
[20:59] in it or whatever it is you'll still
[21:00] have to be accounted for
[21:03] now watch judgment was set
[21:07] the books were open not a book was
[21:09] opened which was a sleeping version
[21:11] and every man was judged from the book
[21:14] you'll be asked to give a reason
[21:17] why you didn't what then you know better
[21:20] now you know better
[21:22] you might not have known it before but
[21:24] you do know
[21:25] where where if the righteous case will
[21:27] be saved
[21:29] where would the sinner on the ungodly
[21:31] appear
[21:32] the one who rejects who knows better
[21:36] and rejects it where will they appear
[21:39] feet
[21:40] like brass divine judgment
[21:43] his here flames of his eyes flame of
[21:46] fire
[21:46] his feet like brass voice his voice
[21:50] here we go sound of many waters
[21:53] voice of many waters what does waters
[21:56] represent
[21:58] if you want to mark it it represents the
[22:00] water's dark source revelation 17 15
[22:03] is thickness and multitudes so that he's
[22:05] breaking it down
[22:06] and he's revealing what that means voice
[22:08] of many waters
[22:10] voice of many waters what is his voice
[22:13] it's the judgment
[22:14] the voice of the ministers through the
[22:16] holy spirit
[22:17] that cried out to the people in every
[22:19] age standing there
[22:21] the voice of many waters cried out
[22:23] thickness and multitudes the voice of
[22:25] those seven stars
[22:26] in his hand to every church age
[22:28] preaching the baptism of the holy ghost
[22:30] preaching the baptism in jesus name
[22:32] speaking in tongues the power of god
[22:34] the resurrection of christ second coming
[22:37] divine judgment
[22:38] the voice of many waters coming forth
[22:40] from the one
[22:41] that looked like the son of man so in
[22:43] other words all what was folding
[22:45] through the ages was christ so when in
[22:49] the glory of revelation
[22:51] the voice came out it was the voice of
[22:53] many waters
[22:54] but it was christ's life living out
[22:56] through the seven ages
[22:58] oh hallelujah it was always christ
[23:01] hallelujah right now it is christ
[23:04] living out his word in her pride
[23:07] hallelujah do you believe that
[23:09] what will it be the voice of many waters
[23:12] praise god what is it what
[23:16] it will be to know here we go that you
[23:18] said in the meetings
[23:20] heard that you should get right with god
[23:22] and receive the holy ghost
[23:24] and that drifting soul to hear the voice
[23:27] speak out
[23:28] in that meeting you set in and heard the
[23:30] judgments of god preached
[23:32] and refused it the great falls just
[23:34] below
[23:35] the great cataracts that take you to our
[23:36] eternal dome
[23:38] it's like you're going we don't have
[23:40] that here in trinidad
[23:41] but in other countries have it a river
[23:43] and it goes to fall
[23:44] and you fall over and fall straight down
[23:46] the great cataracts
[23:48] the falls voice of many waters
[23:52] fought personage of him voice of many
[23:56] waters
[23:56] how are you gonna do it when it's
[23:58] recorded in glory
[24:00] when the voice tonight is recorded your
[24:03] voice is recorded
[24:05] here we go your thoughts are recorded
[24:09] as a man tinkered in his heart so is he
[24:13] and your thoughts are louder in heaven
[24:16] than your voice is on earth
[24:22] as a man think in his heart so is he
[24:26] so then we have to speak with our mouths
[24:29] what we really have
[24:30] in our hearts because it wouldn't be in
[24:32] harmony
[24:33] isn't that right so watch god knows the
[24:36] thoughts and intents of your heart
[24:38] he knows all about it he said to the
[24:40] pharisees you hypocrite how can you
[24:41] speak good things went out of the
[24:42] abundance of your heart speaking them
[24:44] out
[24:44] calling me master and good and i could
[24:46] look right to you and see you a
[24:47] hypocrite
[24:48] you don't mean that you don't mean god
[24:51] bless you
[24:53] you mean to say that because you want to
[24:54] say that but if you really mean that
[24:56] you will mean that hallelujah can't be
[24:59] hateful for somebody got restored
[25:01] they can't be upset because somebody
[25:03] bring god bring back somebody
[25:05] from hell you can't be angry because god
[25:08] save someone and redeem
[25:09] someone and a backslider find his way
[25:12] back home
[25:12] you can't be angry you have to be
[25:14] possessed
[25:15] [Applause]
[25:19] god listen god has leave all to find one
[25:22] sinner
[25:23] caught us with all the 99 to find that
[25:27] one sheep

[31:24] you will know when you hear the great
[31:26] falls
[31:28] roaring of those voices of those
[31:30] meetings

[31:38] don't let it happen to you repent
[31:42] get right with god now while you can get
[31:45] right
[31:46] hallelujah who praise god
[31:50] question and answers no but the branham
[31:52] is it true that have been you born since
[31:54] christ came will be saved
[31:56] what a hundred and forty four thousand
[31:57] other predestinated ones to be sealed
[31:59] where the holy ghost what is their
[32:01] mission
[32:01] there about three questions in one the
[32:03] first one is it true
[32:05] that every jew born since christ that
[32:08] came into the world is to be saved
[32:10] he said no nothing will be saved
[32:13] only those whose names were put on the
[32:15] lamb's book of life
[32:17] before the foundation of the world jew
[32:19] or gentile that's
[32:20] all the book holds that mystery and the
[32:23] book is only unfolding it now
[32:26] watch watch not each one's name but what
[32:29] the mystery of the book is
[32:31] while it is calling those names the book
[32:34] doesn't say
[32:35] leave it is to be saved in this time of
[32:36] the church age or alma neville
[32:38] no it doesn't say that it just shows the
[32:40] mystery
[32:41] it unfolds a mystery of what the thing
[32:44] is
[32:45] and we ourselves by faith believe it
[32:50] so when you come here you come here to
[32:52] catch the mystery
[32:55] and nobody can catch it for you
[32:59] you can send somebody to keep your
[33:00] doctor's appointment
[33:04] you are sick can you send somebody let
[33:06] the doctor check you for me
[33:07] that makes no sense you've got to keep
[33:10] the appointment
[33:11] yourself and you have our appointment
[33:14] with the supernatural
[33:15] that nobody can keep
[33:19] you ordained for it you are
[33:22] predestinated to it

[39:38] the spirit and the price they come oh
[39:41] hallelujah blessed be the rock of our
[39:45] salvation let's go
[39:49] question if the church is saved
[39:52] even though she does not go in the
[39:53] rapture as i believe you taught
[39:56] she must go through the tribulation for
[39:57] pre-fine but what about these that are
[39:59] dead
[40:00] how will they prepare fight that's the
[40:03] question
[40:04] answer the bride don't need no
[40:07] purification
[40:08] she's already purified and those that
[40:11] are dead
[40:12] watch that live under justification
[40:14] certification
[40:15] they live to the light that they had and
[40:18] whatever they went through and their
[40:19] persecutions but now
[40:21] in this rapturing time
[40:24] there will have to come a time now that
[40:27] this bride
[40:29] that rejects the head part of the bride
[40:31] what he's saying is the church
[40:33] that rejects the head part of the bride
[40:35] will have to suffer
[40:37] for her rejection because the gospel
[40:40] was made plain to them back there like
[40:43] it's made plain to you today
[40:45] see it's made plain so you have done had
[40:47] all those years
[40:48] and examples the seals is open the
[40:51] church aid is laid out everything else
[40:53] it's just so plain you can't miss it
[40:57] the minister's making want to make it
[40:58] complicated but he said
[41:00] write division and make it plain god
[41:03] take a man with no education
[41:05] to bring the greatest revelation that we
[41:08] could understand it
[41:09] that it could be made plain glorious
[41:14] hallelujah he didn't bring dr hooly
[41:17] harley
[41:18] he brought the 20th century prophet
[41:20] [Applause]
[41:24] hallelujah glory to god let the doctor
[41:28] keep his doctorate
[41:29] but god said the prophet but the word of
[41:32] the lord but thus hear the lord
[41:34] [Applause]
[41:39] that can't fail hallelujah
[41:42] praise god that a fool shouldn't hear
[41:47] hallelujah praise the name of the lord
[41:51] hallelujah praise god
[41:54] blessed be the name ah glory to
[41:58] god you have to forgive me you know but
[41:59] let's find my bones
[42:14] verse 9 says stay yourselves and wonder
[42:16] cry ye out and cry
[42:18] they are drunken but not with wine
[42:21] they stagger but not with strong drink
[42:26] for the lord had poured out upon you the
[42:28] spirit of deep sleep
[42:31] not sleeping this deep sea bear deep
[42:33] sleep not name waking you up
[42:38] god poured upon them spirit of deep
[42:42] sleep
[42:43] watch and not close your eyes
[42:47] the prophets your rulers the seers
[42:50] that you covered and the vision of all
[42:55] is become to you as the words of a book
[42:58] that is sealed which men deliver to them
[43:01] that is learned and saying
[43:02] read this i pray thee and he said i
[43:04] cannot
[43:06] for it is healed so the learner said i
[43:09] can read it
[43:10] because it is closed to me
[43:13] and the book is delivered to him that is
[43:15] not learned saying read this
[43:16] i pray thee and he said i'm not learned
[43:19] so i can't read wherefore
[43:23] here we go the lord said
[43:26] for as much here we go are you ready
[43:30] as these people draw near me with their
[43:33] mouth
[43:34] and with their lips do honor me
[43:38] but have removed their heart far from me
[43:41] and their fear here we go towards me
[43:45] is taught by the precept of men
[43:50] instead of hearing god who is the word
[43:54] the affair of god is taught by the
[43:56] precept of
[43:57] men so they don't really fear god they
[44:00] fear man
[44:01] [Applause]
[44:04] hallelujah because if you fear god
[44:07] you don't care what men think
[44:10] and what men say
[44:12] [Applause]
[44:16] that's why elijah said it wasn't for
[44:18] jesus i wouldn't even talk to you guys
[44:21] it's only because a righteous man is in
[44:23] your midst that i'm having this
[44:25] conversation
[44:26] oh hallelujah oh give the lord some
[44:30] praises people
[44:36] because there's only more praise no
[44:40] talk mouth worship no sincerity
[44:44] because of that hear this verse
[44:48] therefore behold i will proceed
[44:53] to do a marvelous work among these
[44:56] people
[44:57] even a marvelous work and a wonder for
[44:59] the wisdom of
[45:00] their wise men shall perish and the
[45:03] understanding of the prudent men
[45:04] shall be heared oh hallelujah
[45:08] god dropping sleep deep sleep god shut
[45:11] the
[45:11] eyes and shutting her and god said i'm
[45:13] gonna do a marvelous work
[45:15] i'm gonna cause a wonder that's how you
[45:17] gonna be
[45:18] are you gonna be a sign and you're gonna
[45:21] be a wonder
[45:23] oh glory to god
[45:24] [Applause]
[45:26] my people shall never be ashamed it
[45:29] shall come to pass afterwards
[45:32] that i'll pour out my spirit young men
[45:35] shall see visions
[45:36] [Applause]
[45:39] oh hallelujah praise the lord
[45:43] praise the lord hallelujah
[45:46] you may be seated expectation
[45:51] a minister cannot be a revival there's
[45:53] no preacher can bring a revival
[45:55] he doesn't pack it with him the only
[45:58] thing he can do
[45:59] so why is the people have this kind of
[46:02] minister's thing
[46:03] my my minister might you know why is the
[46:06] minister teaching the people like that
[46:10] that they are being glorified that they
[46:13] have been magnified
[46:15] the bible said the lord magnified joshua
[46:16] but these people might find himself
[46:19] in front of people and the people
[46:22] looking up to them
[46:25] and the bible said try the spirits so
[46:28] when they always say let me try them
[46:31] they all know
[46:35] and we say we're gonna try it because
[46:37] the prophet said
[46:39] try it and never again must it happen
[46:42] that false things come in
[46:44] without being tried try the spirit the
[46:47] bible said so
[46:48] if a man claims something try it see if
[46:51] it's right
[46:52] if it's right we work with it if it is
[46:53] not right we give it the boots
[46:56] and we kick it right out could somebody
[46:59] say
[47:00] man
[47:04] so i walk with my boots in case i need a
[47:08] kick
[47:09] could we give the lord a shout the
[47:10] praise
[47:12] you to understand we're in a war do you
[47:15] want the siren of war
[47:17] and god promised a revival who is
[47:20] responsible
[47:22] for that revival
[47:23] [Applause]
[47:32] oh glory glory glory hallelujah
[47:36] hallelujah hallelujah who is responsible
[47:41] and god expect results god expect a
[47:44] bunch of people sitting down
[47:46] jesus if you abide in me and my word of
[47:49] god in you
[47:50] oh glory to god you shall ask what you
[47:53] will
[47:53] and it shall be done unto you
[48:02] say after me god expect results
[48:05] it again god expect results one more
[48:09] time go and expect results
[48:11] give the lord a shout
[48:21] said john 15. jesus said i am the vine
[48:25] my father he's a husband man he has a
[48:28] job
[48:30] every branch of me that doesn't matter
[48:32] he will cut it

[48:35] cotton business any brand that produce

[49:04] parable here's talk about a man

[49:22] the hundred make 200 150 make 100.
[49:24] the one with one human unhide it
[49:30] when the man come and see but this one
[49:32] you know we multiplied this other one
[49:34] multiplied
[49:35] this one he did nothing with it he stood
[49:38] still
[49:41] he was waiting on the lord
[49:45] he was waiting to see what the others
[49:47] are doing he was in the wrong crowd
[49:48] because there's watching the others
[49:50] who were with him he was recognized
[49:52] there doing something
[49:53] because action is caused
[49:56] so this guy was just sitting on it he
[49:59] said i know he's a hard man
[50:01] and i bury what you give me
[50:04] and to keep it safe
[50:09] that's the problem with people today
[50:10] they want to offend nobody
[50:13] they don't want to upset nobody they're
[50:16] taking it
[50:16] easy they're playing it safe
[50:20] they want to be careful and choose their
[50:22] words
[50:23] so they don't even hear from god knowing
[50:25] what everybody's saying that walked
[50:27] who softly tipped you in before them
[50:30] but when god called jonah the word of
[50:33] the lord came to jonah
[50:34] and god tell jonah i want you to go to
[50:37] nineveh and cry out
[50:39] not whisper in their ears cry out bless
[50:42] out
[50:43] boss them hit their way it hurts
[50:47] stop stop support it in france i was
[50:50] telling burma triples
[50:52] not one not two three
[50:56] people love the principle he's a nice
[50:58] guy
[50:59] no doctrine praying for the sick going
[51:02] by back this method is drove over
[51:04] everybody loved the prophet but that's
[51:06] the first pull so even you see him and
[51:09] i'll tell him if it's not a picture
[51:11] with the phones i have no any first book
[51:13] you hold that picture you frame that
[51:15] picture
[51:15] that foot's perfectly looking nice when
[51:17] the second pull come
[51:19] it's to rebuke spirits and prophesy
[51:23] of a temple if you see that picture i
[51:26] can hold back no more trinities of the
[51:28] devil
[51:28] i can't hold back no more woman
[51:30] preachers and false i can't hold back no
[51:32] more
[51:32] jessie bell religion ripping through the
[51:34] whole thing
[51:36] oh yeah he's no longer the nice prophet
[51:39] but jesus had the same thing feed the
[51:41] multitude
[51:42] heal the sick raise the dead nice nice
[51:45] prophet from galilee
[51:46] but then jesus had to hit them hard he
[51:48] bunch of hypocrites
[51:50] hallelujah who actually knew the fleet
[51:52] of the wrath and so forth
[51:53] straighten them out because he was
[51:55] prophesying a typical coming
[51:57] a word coming oh hallelujah and the
[51:59] turtle is a spoken word hallelujah the
[52:02] temple is a king's sword
[52:03] the temple is a ten vision isn't that
[52:05] right the turtle is the cat's
[52:06] rainbow trout the turquoise for the
[52:08] bride god sent a point to get you
[52:12] and the third pearl is the priest of the
[52:14] doomed
[52:15] preacher eternal loss oh hallelujah
[52:18] which part of the pool you want
[52:20] i want to be pulled into christ i want
[52:23] to be pulled into the holy ghost
[52:25] i want to be pulling to the revival
[52:27] [Applause]
[52:29] oh glory hallelujah praise the name of
[52:32] the lord
[52:34] praise god hallelujah
[52:37] so no minister can bring a revival he
[52:40] doesn't pack it with him
[52:41] the only thing he can to be do is just
[52:43] be loyal to god in his word
[52:45] and the revival has to come by the
[52:47] people
[52:50] in your home in your life
[52:54] it has to come by the people and if god
[52:56] promises a revival they'll be going to
[52:58] have it
[52:59] let's make ready for it if god promise
[53:01] you to heal
[53:02] let's make ready for it oh glory to god
[53:06] i don't care what's contrary what's
[53:08] wrong i hope to see it
[53:10] if god's telling it i believe it anyhow
[53:12] i'm expecting it and if you're expecting
[53:14] it
[53:15] you'll be here for it oh hallelujah
[53:18] but branham said they missed him to seal
[53:21] the living word manifested in the flesh
[53:23] by the word that has promised to do
[53:25] these things she held the traditions she
[53:27] held the substitute blood instead of the
[53:29] real blood
[53:30] because she held those traditions you
[53:32] see they for years they were killing
[53:34] lambs and goats and bullocks
[53:36] and that was accepted until christ come
[53:40] that was a substitute until the reality
[53:42] come and people don't like change
[53:45] they like to go with the flow of
[53:47] tradition so jesus was
[53:49] wrecking their traditions so it's very
[53:52] problematic because this is not how we
[53:53] are custom doing it you know
[53:54] we we're custom bringing our bulls and
[53:56] goats and so on like that jesus said i
[53:57] am the lamb of god you know what i mean
[53:59] he come to bring a whole new order all
[54:00] together so he was rocking the whole
[54:02] thing
[54:03] he was shaken up when they thought he
[54:05] came to fight he said my kingdom is not
[54:07] of this world
[54:08] if my kingdom was of this world my men
[54:11] will fight for me
[54:12] but i belong to another kingdom that's
[54:15] all together
[54:16] jesus began to speak certain things to
[54:18] them he said when they say go here go
[54:20] there go there like you want to do no
[54:21] look at that look at that look at that
[54:22] he said forget about it
[54:24] behold the kingdom is within you oh
[54:26] hallelujah when you look here look here
[54:28] look here you have to go here you have
[54:29] to go here you have to join here you
[54:31] have to connect here forget about it
[54:33] behold the kingdom who is responsible
[54:35] for this revival
[54:37] if the minister can't bring a revival
[54:39] who who
[54:40] is there anybody know the answer to that
[54:42] question
[54:43] that's a powerful question who is
[54:46] responsible
[54:47] to bring every fiber somebody got to
[54:50] give an account somebody got to
[54:52] own up i want to see who is responsible
[54:55] for bringing a revival
[55:00] i just told you i am not
[55:04] sit down a minute so i am exhilarated
[55:08] [Music]
[55:10] and these two other ministers also
[55:14] they're off the hook let me hear them
[55:16] say amen
[55:18] only off the hook because i just read
[55:20] for you no minutes i could bring it
[55:21] so don't try to come here and try to
[55:23] bring no revival you can't bring it
[55:25] hallelujah you supposed to preach the
[55:27] word
[55:28] but the people they they got to answer
[55:31] the question
[55:34] we need our answer to that question we
[55:36] need to answer today
[55:43] division is being made plain
[55:50] glory you wanna be seated brother
[55:53] branham said
[55:54] no listen that's the reason today the
[55:57] revivals that we're supposed to have
[56:00] we have the nominational revivals we
[56:02] haven't had a real estate
[56:03] no no no no no he said four times five
[56:06] times no sir
[56:08] we don't think we got revivers we
[56:09] haven't they got millions and millions
[56:11] of church members
[56:12] but not a revival nowhere are you ready
[56:16] for this heavenly prophecy the bride
[56:20] not the church he said you know the
[56:22] bride
[56:23] hasn't had a revival yet
[56:27] who said so god said so not it not
[56:30] having you ever known yet
[56:32] yet meat is still coming yet meat is
[56:34] honest with you

[56:48] no revival there
[56:50] no manifestation notice he didn't say no
[56:54] revelation

[56:57] plus years

[57:03] but i have a passion to see this
[57:07] come alive there have been no
[57:09] manifestation of god

[57:15] are looking for it
[57:18] are you don't look at me

[57:28] you know what you have to do
[57:30] i am doing what i have to do but are you
[57:32] doing what you have to do
[57:38] oh it's rocking inside of here it is
[57:40] shaking inside of here
[57:41] it's going to be rough it's going to be
[57:43] rocking but together we're going to make
[57:45] it
[57:45] by the grace of god
[57:51] here we go are looking for
[57:56] how we gonna come it will take
[57:59] the minister's association together
[58:00] together no
[58:02] it will take conventions and conventions

[58:17] to revive to quicken to make money
[58:20] manifest
[58:22] seven thunders seven voices

[1:00:51] power your nose
[1:01:00] glory glory
[1:01:03] you may be seated now watch this

[1:01:22] no we expecting a manifestation
[1:01:29] glory glory glory you may be seated
[1:01:33] look at this you may be seated jesus
[1:01:37] prophecy sign of his crucifixion
[1:01:38] peter fight him jesus will do the devil
[1:01:41] on him he could probably sign the son of
[1:01:43] man would be crucified
[1:01:44] he know he have to pay the price you
[1:01:46] have to pay the price to get the book
[1:01:48] because your name is in the book if you
[1:01:50] name it if he doesn't get the book
[1:01:52] you can't release your name that you
[1:01:54] could pawn into manifestation
[1:01:56] because the book has your complete
[1:01:58] redemption
[1:01:59] both soul spirit and body
[1:02:03] the mystery of which is locked up in
[1:02:04] that book
[1:02:06] ah glory man no feeling to preach
[1:02:11] glory to god demands
[1:02:14] complete redemption and restoration
[1:02:17] was sealed in the book so the lamb had
[1:02:20] to take the book
[1:02:22] to break the seals to reveal that we
[1:02:24] could go back
[1:02:25] to know who we are who god is and who
[1:02:29] the devil is
[1:02:35] [Applause]
[1:02:44] oh glory he will send it
[1:02:48] so when jesus rose from the dead better
[1:02:50] rebuke the disciples
[1:02:52] after three and a half years of
[1:02:53] following him peter went back fishing
[1:02:56] and a bunch of brothers zero revelation
[1:02:59] no understanding went fishing with him
[1:03:02] too this is a pizza you on your own
[1:03:04] you want to go fishing you grow the boat
[1:03:06] you talk to you send out the la
[1:03:08] or you do everything yourself we're not
[1:03:09] going out there
[1:03:11] they could have told him that but if i
[1:03:13] go fishing they say we going to
[1:03:17] but notice jesus behavior he said oh god
[1:03:20] well you know that no no no do you have
[1:03:22] any meat
[1:03:26] is there any fish all night god nothing
[1:03:30] yeah because you're out of the will

[1:03:54] looking for fish and there's no fish
[1:03:57] notice if they were in the boat
[1:03:59] on the land he couldn't tell him casting
[1:04:00] it to the right side you'll get son
[1:04:05] so even though they were out of the
[1:04:07] program
[1:04:08] he actually allow and make all things
[1:04:11] work
[1:04:16] you can't get fish on the land because
[1:04:18] fish doesn't grow on the land
[1:04:20] it doesn't swim on the land you have to
[1:04:22] be on the sea
[1:04:23] accent is caused they went out there
[1:04:25] doing something
[1:04:26] they caught nothing until the master's
[1:04:28] voice funded
[1:04:31] on which side to cast the net and the
[1:04:34] master's voice has thundered

[1:05:10] how you're connecting to it how you get
[1:05:12] into it how it's going to be unfolded
[1:05:15] he said if the churches would forget
[1:05:17] their creeds
[1:05:18] today in all the churches oh glory to
[1:05:22] god
[1:05:22] did you hear that if all the churches
[1:05:24] would forget their creeds
[1:05:26] forget their dogmas and just take the
[1:05:28] bible and plead the promise
[1:05:30] it would become effective to them
[1:05:40] hear what you're pleasing you're not
[1:05:42] pleading
[1:05:43] about yourself you're feeling what god
[1:05:46] promised
[1:05:47] lord you promised the holy ghost you
[1:05:49] promise revival
[1:05:50] you promise deliverance you promise
[1:05:52] healing

[1:05:56] poured your spirit
[1:05:58] i understand my revelation you were
[1:06:00] waiting for the mechanics
[1:06:02] to comfort and with the seven seas being
[1:06:04] open
[1:06:05] the mechanics has been revealed now we
[1:06:08] are here
[1:06:11] [Applause]
[1:06:16] go watch
[1:06:28] no you can't say you don't know
[1:06:32] because god prophet was evidence
[1:06:35] of the land that we are going to
[1:06:38] [Music]
[1:06:40] you could still put on deep cold until
[1:06:42] deep and see the holy spirit
[1:06:44] the pit of fire operate through that
[1:06:46] prophet to discern
[1:06:48] conditions and people you could still
[1:06:50] read the books
[1:06:51] to see how much your supernatural was
[1:06:53] manifested in this age
[1:06:56] and he said what you see manifested
[1:06:58] temporarily
[1:06:59] will be manifested in its fullness when
[1:07:03] the press comes
[1:07:08] people feel is just coming to church
[1:07:11] normal
[1:07:12] but the press is coming and you have to
[1:07:15] have what it takes
[1:07:16] to deal with the press
[1:07:19] [Applause]
[1:07:22] isis they're calling christians the
[1:07:25] crusaders

[1:11:19] he said open my eyes
[1:11:22] oh glory
[1:11:26] what do you want him to do
[1:11:29] we want a revival
[1:11:40] you have to have to speak it
[1:11:44] that you have to see it action is caused
[1:11:48] the man centurion came to jesus he said

[1:12:09] jesus spoke
[1:12:10] and the man on his way said what time
[1:12:12] here is the man's sake
[1:12:14] check the doctor check the temperature
[1:12:15] what time was he healed he was so
[1:12:17] convinced that word went ahead of him
[1:12:19] [Applause]
[1:12:21] this word is faster than the doctor's

[1:13:11] you shall prosper
[1:13:21] glory amen isaac
[1:13:24] hallelujah not even prison could stop it
[1:13:28] no trial could stop it hallelujah samson
[1:13:32] prayed
[1:13:32] once more lord
[1:13:39] oh hallelujah glory
[1:13:44] hallelujah
[1:13:47] not a shame of the gospel
[1:13:51] not a shame of the son of man nor his
[1:13:54] words
[1:13:55] oh glory hallelujah
[1:13:59] what we see we shall say there is
[1:14:00] something broke out here
[1:14:02] until the seven thunders of revelation
[1:14:04] 10 that's not even wrong is being
[1:14:07] made manifested the power of god
[1:14:10] the end time is here the angel has
[1:14:12] gathered up the loose hands
[1:14:14] and we are here the loose ends have
[1:14:16] already gathered up
[1:14:17] we have no more loose hands we have
[1:14:19] nothing to tie up
[1:14:21] we have to get ripened and then said
[1:14:24] father let the fire
[1:14:26] fall
[1:14:35] knew he was right fellows come to him
[1:14:40] church members everything that one
[1:14:42] seemed dear to him turn against him
[1:14:44] he's been accused of a secret sinner but
[1:14:48] god was duty-bound to keep his promise
[1:14:50] to him and we see this great man
[1:14:54] remember job had no bible to read in his
[1:14:58] day
[1:14:59] reading wasn't as important as hearing
[1:15:02] he had the ability as all sons and
[1:15:05] daughters
[1:15:05] i i just love that all sons and
[1:15:08] daughters
[1:15:09] the catholic church took back the word
[1:15:11] from the people
[1:15:12] that they need a priest to expound to
[1:15:14] them but we find out
[1:15:16] by a prophet that god has built in
[1:15:19] the sons and daughters of god the
[1:15:21] ability
[1:15:22] to hear from god
[1:15:23] [Music]
[1:15:24] [Applause]
[1:15:26] in other words i could bring a false
[1:15:30] anointed in this pulpit
[1:15:32] and he could preach lovely words to you
[1:15:35] and without i saying a word
[1:15:37] the clock or the the thing inside of you
[1:15:40] what's it yes yeah no
[1:15:44] no and somebody said people preach it
[1:15:46] and the preacher only reached it on top
[1:15:48] of the head
[1:15:48] over there it didn't come in at all
[1:15:50] because they can't receive it so just
[1:15:52] over it's hanging it's hanging
[1:15:57] why because god protects you
[1:16:03] by the seed in you the elect will not be
[1:16:06] deceived
[1:16:10] all all
[1:16:13] on the earth will be deceived
[1:16:17] [Music]
[1:16:18] except
[1:16:21] accept those names written
[1:16:25] [Applause]
[1:16:26] i'm not afraid to preach the gospel to
[1:16:29] the names that are written
[1:16:31] we're not looking for church members
[1:16:33] we're looking for the bride
[1:16:35] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:16:41] no let's go he was a prophet to whom the
[1:16:45] word of lord come to
[1:16:46] and he only had to get be inspired
[1:16:50] here we go because he knowed
[1:16:54] his position that he was god's prophet
[1:16:59] he knew who he was nobody could change
[1:17:02] that
[1:17:03] but he needed inspiration samson knew
[1:17:05] who he was to
[1:17:06] but the spirit came upon him and he did
[1:17:08] this
[1:17:09] he did that his strength was in god
[1:17:13] and these guys knew it without him
[1:17:16] they're nothing
[1:17:20] here we go that's what the church if
[1:17:22] it's in order
[1:17:23] set in order it's got the mechanics
[1:17:26] ready
[1:17:27] are you ready everybody alive
[1:17:31] sleepy spirit gone that's not hundred
[1:17:34] percent sleepy spread gone
[1:17:36] good i want to know it's long gone
[1:17:40] sleepy spirits telling me the spirits
[1:17:42] they kicked me out of the head sometime
[1:17:45] this morning i was getting comfortable
[1:17:47] among the young people but they kicked
[1:17:48] me out
[1:17:51] hallelujah looked like fire began to
[1:17:53] move on pewter pew
[1:17:54] you kicked me out i don't know what's
[1:17:57] happening among those people but they're
[1:17:58] squeezing me out
[1:18:00] fire moving brother the brother sister
[1:18:03] pewter it's
[1:18:04] fire seem to be jumping all over it look
[1:18:07] like they're ready to
[1:18:08] make a revival and look like they're
[1:18:10] going to cause something to happen
[1:18:12] it look like they are part of the shaker
[1:18:22] all right so got the mechanics ready
[1:18:25] it only needs the dynamics tonight if
[1:18:28] we'll get the mechanics ready
[1:18:30] are you ready get our house right
[1:18:34] the things that we can do follow every
[1:18:37] word
[1:18:38] form in baptism follow him in every
[1:18:41] order he told us
[1:18:42] get every mechanic ready and stand there
[1:18:48] so stop brother with it let's talk about
[1:18:50] our responsibility
[1:18:54] god have a responsibility and we have a
[1:18:57] responsibility
[1:18:59] and what we identifying is god our
[1:19:01] responsibility
[1:19:02] and let's see what god responsibility is
[1:19:04] so our responsibility is to get our
[1:19:06] hearts right
[1:19:08] follow every word follow every order
[1:19:12] get the mechanic ready and stand there
[1:19:14] listen
[1:19:15] and stand there is this the word
[1:19:18] then we are ready for dynamics to be lit
[1:19:21] off
[1:19:23] here we go and only god can do that
[1:19:25] [Applause]
[1:19:28] i want a bigger amen than that because
[1:19:30] if you don't believe that
[1:19:31] a man has to do that and we have to find
[1:19:35] that man because we need it bad
[1:19:39] all right here in trinidad
[1:19:43] only god can do that
[1:19:46] so when jesus raised from the dead
[1:19:51] opened the world to his disciples openly
[1:19:54] understanding the scriptures it was
[1:19:56] revealed to them
[1:19:57] dear promise he prayed them receiving
[1:20:00] the holy ghost
[1:20:01] when they went in the upper room that
[1:20:03] wait because only god
[1:20:07] can do that the bible said when the day
[1:20:10] of pentecost
[1:20:12] which was the appointed time brother
[1:20:13] anthony when the day of pentecost
[1:20:16] was fully come they were in one place
[1:20:19] they were in one man and they were in
[1:20:21] one accord
[1:20:22] watch those ones because there's only
[1:20:24] one lord there's only one faith
[1:20:26] there's only one baptism watch those
[1:20:29] ones
[1:20:30] when prophet was told are you looking at
[1:20:31] the picture the right way the seven
[1:20:33] angels have to turn to the right
[1:20:34] and you're seeing one christ one lord
[1:20:37] one faith
[1:20:39] one baptism another ephesians oh give
[1:20:42] the lord some praises people
[1:20:50] then we are ready for the dynamics only
[1:20:54] god
[1:20:54] can do that and that's to drop into your
[1:20:57] heart the fader say i am not healed
[1:20:59] and it doesn't make any difference
[1:21:00] you'll heal anyhow all glory to god amen
[1:21:04] hallelujah
[1:21:05] isn't that right he is the dynamics
[1:21:09] we become members of the machine of his
[1:21:11] body forming ourselves into this world
[1:21:13] image
[1:21:14] you don't have to know the mechanics
[1:21:16] just the dynamics
[1:21:17] that's why i know the bride is about to
[1:21:19] be called more of the bride going to be
[1:21:20] called some in some being called
[1:21:22] why do you comparable at the 11th hour
[1:21:24] you see some men idle you say why is the
[1:21:26] idol
[1:21:27] action is caused
[1:21:31] if you're still there you have nothing
[1:21:32] to get come and work for me in the
[1:21:34] vineyard
[1:21:35] and you'll get pee there's only one more
[1:21:38] hour to go
[1:21:39] one more push come push with me one more
[1:21:43] press
[1:21:43] come press with me hallelujah come on in
[1:21:46] the fields with me
[1:21:48] and when player time come you give the
[1:21:49] first the the last first the last
[1:21:51] penny penny penny next one penny
[1:21:56] and those who were long
[1:22:00] in the vineyard tired and weary
[1:22:04] taught again a penny and a half per
[1:22:06] entry quarter
[1:22:07] two penny double penny four penny they
[1:22:09] get the same penny
[1:22:10] and gold is bringing a revelation saying
[1:22:12] penny
[1:22:13] what peter half you're gonna have what
[1:22:16] paul had
[1:22:18] you're gonna have what aunt you have
[1:22:20] you're gonna have we're gonna have
[1:22:22] at the same time the man who just come
[1:22:24] in
[1:22:25] same period shame power same signs
[1:22:29] same wonders same miracles same
[1:22:32] anointing
[1:22:33] nobody could hold back your blessing
[1:22:35] nobody could rob you and cheat you of
[1:22:38] your inheritance
[1:22:39] now therefore give me my mountain oh
[1:22:42] give the lord some praises
[1:22:44] oh hallelujah you're a great audience
[1:22:48] you'll be seated the dynamics is the
[1:22:51] holy spirit
[1:22:52] he is the dynamics of the mechanics the
[1:22:55] mechanics of the church what is it
[1:22:56] apostles prophets teachers he is the
[1:22:59] dynamic that works that
[1:23:00] so when the possible and the prophet and
[1:23:02] the teachers and the pastors come into
[1:23:03] position
[1:23:03] the dynamics come to work that the fire
[1:23:07] oh glory ah oh we're getting through
[1:23:11] but i'm turning the light i've already
[1:23:13] get to where i want to reach it but i'm
[1:23:15] going i'm going
[1:23:16] fast as i can
[1:23:22] just remind me of a fellow in florida he
[1:23:25] was talking he had a chevrolet car
[1:23:27] went out of him in florida took to the
[1:23:29] garage this mechanic was going along
[1:23:30] there
[1:23:31] sat together he couldn't get it to stop
[1:23:32] he put everything in it he renew all
[1:23:34] different things but something like that
[1:23:36] just wouldn't work
[1:23:36] couldn't get it started he kept trying
[1:23:38] trying little mechanic was nervous
[1:23:41] running around
[1:23:42] picking up this the man standing there
[1:23:44] saying i'm waiting on my car i'm late
[1:23:45] can't you get it
[1:23:46] he said i'm doing what i can really
[1:23:47] nervous directly a well-dressed
[1:23:49] gentleman walked up
[1:23:51] looked at him in a few moments he said
[1:23:53] to the mechanic after he get the butt
[1:23:55] his head around a little bit he said why
[1:23:56] don't you just touch this you're not
[1:23:58] getting any current
[1:23:59] he said i never told you that he just
[1:24:01] turned the other thing
[1:24:02] and the car started he turned around and
[1:24:04] said who are you
[1:24:06] you know who he was the chief engineer
[1:24:08] of general moto
[1:24:10] he made the thing and he designed it
[1:24:14] and in this hour what's the matter with
[1:24:16] all revival
[1:24:17] what's the matter we got the material
[1:24:20] we cut the mechanics but where is the
[1:24:23] dynamics
[1:24:24] that's what we need god designed it
[1:24:30] [Applause]
[1:24:34] watch what's the matter i will tell you
[1:24:36] there is one here today
[1:24:38] called the holy ghost who can touch the
[1:24:40] mechanics
[1:24:41] he is the dynamics of the mechanics it's
[1:24:44] the word
[1:24:45] it's the word turned on the light
[1:24:48] turns on the mechanics and they became
[1:24:50] dynamics
[1:24:52] they are dynamics and when the dynamics
[1:24:54] from the mechanics it started
[1:24:56] rolling so if we have to get the thing
[1:24:59] rolling
[1:25:00] we have to get started and i
[1:25:03] am i want somebody to answer who is
[1:25:05] responsible
[1:25:06] for getting this seven thunder revival
[1:25:09] oh glory to god
[1:25:11] listen to brother man says this is time
[1:25:14] he was pressed
[1:25:15] vision broke he knew something about the
[1:25:18] breakthrough
[1:25:18] listen to his words it might be closer
[1:25:20] than you think it's got me scared
[1:25:22] i haven't done enough where are we at
[1:25:25] when it's struck by the branham he says
[1:25:27] i haven't done enough
[1:25:28] what have you done for the kingdom when
[1:25:31] last have you done anything at all
[1:25:33] for god's kingdom you do for yourself
[1:25:36] but what about the kingdom
[1:25:37] you do for your children but what about
[1:25:39] the kingdom you do for your little
[1:25:41] family
[1:25:42] but what about the kingdom god have a
[1:25:44] little family business
[1:25:45] he has a big family oh glory to god he
[1:25:48] let the jews
[1:25:50] turned on christ and in them turning on
[1:25:52] christ he came to the gentile
[1:25:54] he's getting a gentile bride of people
[1:25:56] out of different nations
[1:25:57] of different tongues oh what a labor of
[1:26:00] love
[1:26:01] seven ages to get this wonderful
[1:26:04] beautiful wife
[1:26:06] oh hallelujah glory to god
[1:26:10] oh i can't see jesus letting the devil
[1:26:12] mess with his bride
[1:26:14] he waited too long for her he want to
[1:26:16] say i do
[1:26:17] he want to walk up the eyes with his
[1:26:19] bride he want to take flesh of his flesh
[1:26:21] bone of his bone
[1:26:22] word of his word spirit of his spirit
[1:26:25] life of his life
[1:26:26] he is longing to connect with you oh
[1:26:29] hallelujah hallelujah you
[1:26:33] watch he says time shall be no more he
[1:26:35] announces that time is over
[1:26:37] what happens could that be so brethren
[1:26:39] seriously think
[1:26:40] then the perimeter is kept by the seven
[1:26:42] thunders yes wow
[1:26:45] my pyramid camp by the seven thunders
[1:26:48] thunders the holy spirit coming to cap
[1:26:51] the pyramid of your lives
[1:26:52] amen yes three bibles the zodiac the
[1:26:54] pyramids and this bible
[1:26:57] take the peace bible put in the pyramid
[1:26:59] now we find out the pyramid is in us
[1:27:02] who could have taught that a pyramid we
[1:27:03] have a pyramid are we missing the cap
[1:27:05] the cap is the holy spirit
[1:27:07] that come to seal the whole thing enoch
[1:27:09] mechanic became dynamic by the spirit
[1:27:10] and god took him
[1:27:11] enoch walk with god walking with
[1:27:13] mechanics walking by faith
[1:27:15] believe in god all of a sudden he just
[1:27:16] walk of the earth because his mechanics
[1:27:18] turn into dynamics
[1:27:20] and god is saying the word in you which
[1:27:21] is the kingdom in word form
[1:27:24] will turn into power and you're going to
[1:27:26] get power power on the inside
[1:27:28] star track missile benevole had power on
[1:27:30] the inside daniel had hidden power he
[1:27:32] called
[1:27:33] hidden power come out when you need it
[1:27:41] you know what jesus wasn't manufacturing
[1:27:42] bread and say hey everybody
[1:27:44] every day forget the bakery come by me
[1:27:47] i'm the bread multiplying the fish
[1:27:48] multiplier
[1:27:48] it wasn't that the hungry he'd take five
[1:27:51] loaves two fishes and feed them
[1:27:53] first called five thousand next called
[1:27:55] seven thousand say only and come to your
[1:27:56] world all
[1:27:57] come for bread but only come and you're
[1:28:00] glad you're getting word
[1:28:02] hallelujah that's jesus we're talking
[1:28:04] about oh hallelujah just want them to
[1:28:06] come to hear words
[1:28:07] from his father all that the father give
[1:28:09] me i will give you
[1:28:10] i don't speak of myself i speak for my
[1:28:12] father give me the words to say unto you
[1:28:14] and as my father sent me so i'm going to
[1:28:16] send you and whoever i said my father
[1:28:18] said
[1:28:18] oh hallelujah that's jesus oh glory to
[1:28:21] god take some fishermen
[1:28:22] take some uneducated men and anoint them
[1:28:24] and send them out and said bring my word
[1:28:26] my deeds through their word
[1:28:28] make them kingdom men proving the wisdom
[1:28:31] of the wise to be fully
[1:28:32] and foolish all the doctorate and all
[1:28:34] the education to be not
[1:28:36] counted as not take uneducated men and
[1:28:39] bring
[1:28:39] gospel manifestation
[1:28:43] peter going to the place called
[1:28:45] beautiful and i see this crippled man
[1:28:46] says silvan go have i none
[1:28:48] what you have peter the man won silver
[1:28:50] and gold because nobody had no power
[1:28:52] before
[1:28:54] and he could do it himself and go
[1:28:55] because silver and gold could buy you

[1:33:31] when you add to your faith and godliness
[1:33:33] and so forth he captured him and seen
[1:33:34] him with the holy spirit

[1:33:38] has had seven mysteries he
[1:33:40] if you cap you have this in you seven
[1:33:43] mysteries
[1:33:44] that they fought for to bring back and
[1:33:46] the heads don't come the cap of the
[1:33:47] church does the thunders mean that my
[1:33:48] brethren
[1:33:49] oh hallelujah this is brother branham
[1:33:52] and i believe everybody of it should be
[1:33:53] true
[1:33:54] every divine promise is a seed that will
[1:33:56] produce exactly what it said it would do
[1:33:58] if you take the right mental attitude
[1:34:00] towards it remember this the right
[1:34:01] mental attitude
[1:34:02] towards any divine promise of god will
[1:34:05] bring it to pass
[1:34:07] could you take a little more we are
[1:34:09] charging the battery today
[1:34:12] this is a special service here we go
[1:34:15] if you have the right mental attitude
[1:34:18] towards any divine promise of god will
[1:34:20] bring it to pass
[1:34:21] try it no try it just go do it
[1:34:24] if you got enough behind you to push you
[1:34:26] and say i can do it and by god grace i
[1:34:28] will do it then god is with you
[1:34:30] if you just wishy washy well i'll go up
[1:34:33] and see
[1:34:33] if they can do anything for me no i'm
[1:34:35] still reading
[1:34:36] here not long ago i'll just skip that
[1:34:40] oh praise god oh
[1:34:43] harlow so you don't want that
[1:34:45] lackadaisical attitude
[1:34:47] now let's go from from a man running
[1:34:49] from the presence of the lord brother
[1:34:50] branham
[1:34:51] he was saying dear jesus help us tonight
[1:34:53] and they say words as we wait upon you
[1:34:55] lord
[1:34:56] as we pray that your grace and mercy
[1:34:57] with us lord and tend our hearts move
[1:34:59] back all the shocks the torns the
[1:35:01] tissues
[1:35:02] let the blessed sunshine of god falling
[1:35:04] upon the word lord and may we have such
[1:35:05] a great meeting here
[1:35:07] that there may not be an unsafe person
[1:35:08] among us all the children will be in the
[1:35:10] kingdom of god
[1:35:11] those without the baptism of the spirit
[1:35:13] may they receive it further
[1:35:15] here we go may all the great mysteries
[1:35:17] that we are supposed to know at this age
[1:35:18] lord
[1:35:19] be unveiled to us here we go that we
[1:35:21] might see the plainness of god
[1:35:23] so that we will know how to behave
[1:35:24] ourselves and act
[1:35:26] correcting ourselves and bringing the
[1:35:28] members of our body
[1:35:30] into discipline of the world that we
[1:35:32] might know how to live in this present
[1:35:34] day
[1:35:34] at the approach of the lord jesus so the
[1:35:36] mysteries is to reveal to us the
[1:35:38] plainness of god
[1:35:40] that we might know how to behave
[1:35:44] isn't that right nobody used the
[1:35:46] scripture we read about jonah
[1:35:48] to identify a man running from the
[1:35:50] presence of god and he was speaking
[1:35:51] about responsibility
[1:35:53] and he said we find an example every one
[1:35:55] of us we are all running from something
[1:35:58] we run from trouble we went from
[1:36:00] responsibilities we are prone to do that
[1:36:02] we are more prone to run than to stand
[1:36:04] up and face it at all
[1:36:05] we find ourselves running sometimes we
[1:36:08] find ourselves prone to run from work
[1:36:10] we don't want to work some people think
[1:36:14] they can make a living without working
[1:36:16] but i think solomon said that we should
[1:36:18] find an answer and watching an
[1:36:20] ant you're not an aunt that doesn't work
[1:36:23] doesn't eat in winter either so
[1:36:25] everybody has to work
[1:36:28] whether you see him in or not we still
[1:36:31] going forward
[1:36:33] we got so many things we have to do are
[1:36:36] you with me
[1:36:37] when you're home stretched now this is
[1:36:38] this is the meat part now all right that
[1:36:40] was the steak part does he meat
[1:36:44] that was a salad we had yet we're going
[1:36:47] somewhat
[1:36:49] okay watch um
[1:36:53] we got so many things we have to do so
[1:36:55] much responsibility that we have to face
[1:36:57] everybody has got to face
[1:37:00] a certain responsibility everything is a
[1:37:03] responsibility
[1:37:04] and it's so easy when the responsibility
[1:37:07] faces us to shrug away from them
[1:37:09] we find marriage is a responsibility in
[1:37:11] all manners
[1:37:13] ministers many times took responsibility
[1:37:15] from standing for the true word of god
[1:37:17] when they're confronted with it they
[1:37:19] shook that responsibility
[1:37:21] when the truth of the word of god is
[1:37:22] brought face-to-face with them
[1:37:24] we as human beings should back but to
[1:37:27] face up the responsibility it takes the
[1:37:29] height of us
[1:37:30] as the father to give each other a
[1:37:32] weapon and so forth
[1:37:34] but even as i said ministers
[1:37:37] they come face to face with truth and
[1:37:39] then walk away from it
[1:37:41] they seem like they don't want to face
[1:37:43] up to it
[1:37:44] many times i have people come and say i
[1:37:45] know that's right brother branham but if
[1:37:47] i did that they would kick me out of the
[1:37:49] church
[1:37:49] what of it if you don't you will be
[1:37:52] kicked up up there
[1:37:54] so you've got to be kicked out somewhere
[1:37:56] you might as well face up to it
[1:37:58] jesus said the scriptures the idea
[1:38:00] testify upon me about me
[1:38:03] many people are afraid to face up the
[1:38:06] responsibility of coping
[1:38:08] with the message of the hour we find
[1:38:10] that everywhere
[1:38:12] many people here we go sympathize with
[1:38:15] it and say it's right
[1:38:16] but that is not the thing you're
[1:38:18] responsible for nice service nice people
[1:38:21] nice anointing nice inspiration you
[1:38:23] sympathize with it
[1:38:24] that is not what you respond before
[1:38:25] sympathy is not responsibility
[1:38:29] if a young man looking for a wife to be
[1:38:31] married stood a girl met every
[1:38:32] qualification and he taught to make a
[1:38:34] woman
[1:38:34] morally she's a queen lovely find
[1:38:36] personality real christian
[1:38:38] and think to make her a good wife make a
[1:38:41] good wife
[1:38:42] no matter how much she says she's
[1:38:43] perfect she isn't mine until i accept
[1:38:46] her
[1:38:46] and the responsibility of her being my
[1:38:48] wife
[1:38:51] that's the same thing with the message
[1:38:52] you might say it's right i sympathize i
[1:38:54] believe it's the truth but you've got to
[1:38:55] accept it
[1:38:56] it's got to become a part of you and you
[1:38:59] are part of it and then
[1:39:00] it is yours become like in this church
[1:39:03] if you see your memories church you have
[1:39:04] to be a part of it
[1:39:06] it's a part of you and then it's your
[1:39:07] church then you will be concerned with
[1:39:09] what goes on in your church
[1:39:11] you can't just walk in and walk out and
[1:39:12] if you're unconcerned what the no you'll
[1:39:14] be concerned
[1:39:14] so if somebody is off and wrong and
[1:39:17] whatever it is you'll be concerned
[1:39:18] enough to go and have a burden
[1:39:19] to pray with them encourage them provoke
[1:39:21] them to love unto good works to get back
[1:39:23] on track
[1:39:24] you'll be concerned to pull them up if
[1:39:26] somebody gossip until then stop it
[1:39:28] expose the gossip and spirit and let it
[1:39:30] leave them that is your responsibility
[1:39:33] isn't that right so whatever i'm talking
[1:39:35] about uh
[1:39:36] uh jonah went down to the hall of the
[1:39:38] ship i'm almost finished
[1:39:40] and took a wind and sleep took the easy
[1:39:42] route it's the easy way
[1:39:45] it's a popular way with the people it's
[1:39:47] easy to take the way
[1:39:49] where everybody can pack you on the back
[1:39:51] back and say you're a good fellow
[1:39:53] and the world look upon you it's easy to
[1:39:56] go
[1:39:57] the popular way but when you have to do
[1:39:59] something different
[1:40:01] when you have to stand for your
[1:40:02] conviction of what you know
[1:40:04] to be the truth that is where the hard
[1:40:06] part comes that's what the bible said
[1:40:08] take the book eat the book sweeten them
[1:40:10] out bit in the belly
[1:40:11] when you have the guts to stand for your
[1:40:12] conviction so we find out
[1:40:14] that we have many easy ways to go ships
[1:40:17] going to tashas
[1:40:18] for it's easy i know there's not a
[1:40:20] correct word the unresponsibilities
[1:40:23] it just flows in you have everybody
[1:40:26] likes you
[1:40:27] nobody disagree with you you disagree
[1:40:30] with nobody
[1:40:32] if that isn't a disrupt we have someone
[1:40:34] that is out here
[1:40:36] oh yes that's right just a push over
[1:40:39] flop over anybody i don't care who you
[1:40:42] are
[1:40:42] what you're standing for actually decent
[1:40:45] thinking people will think more of you
[1:40:46] if you stand for the conviction of what
[1:40:48] is right
[1:40:49] you take a woman she might not be
[1:40:51] attractive but she stands for what is
[1:40:52] right
[1:40:53] she'll get that respect and so forth and
[1:40:55] there's too many christians today
[1:40:56] so saw soup and everything else till
[1:40:59] they will just join church
[1:41:00] put their name on the book and call it
[1:41:01] christianity here we go christianity is
[1:41:04] an everyday rugged life
[1:41:06] living for god in this present world
[1:41:08] it's a constant burning of the fire and
[1:41:10] the love of god
[1:41:11] in the heart that sets you a fire and
[1:41:14] puts you yonder with the people
[1:41:16] making converts to christ it's a
[1:41:19] responsibility
[1:41:20] if your sister on the job wherever and
[1:41:23] your
[1:41:24] dress is correct and proper people will
[1:41:26] ask you
[1:41:27] why you dress the way you dress if
[1:41:29] people don't ask you that you just like
[1:41:31] them
[1:41:32] so then you have no testimony god wants
[1:41:35] to force the issue
[1:41:36] if when you sit down your dress can't
[1:41:38] cover your knee it's not long enough
[1:41:41] when you sit down you're just supposed
[1:41:42] to be able to cover your knee
[1:41:44] and that is modesty so when somebody see
[1:41:47] you dressing different they could ask
[1:41:49] who are you just like that and that
[1:41:51] makes you evangelist
[1:41:53] immediately that makes you a witness
[1:41:57] that gives you an opportunity to give
[1:41:59] your testimony
[1:42:00] you know why i dress like this because
[1:42:03] god sent a 20th century prophet
[1:42:05] that brought the direct word of the lord
[1:42:07] and this is what we believe
[1:42:09] and this is what we stand for and you
[1:42:11] give an opportunity to share your
[1:42:12] testimony pre-press
[1:42:14] i want to shake up your little world to
[1:42:16] ask if you are
[1:42:17] rugged and gutsy to stand for christ to
[1:42:20] reflect
[1:42:21] this beautiful wonderful gospel of the
[1:42:25] kingdom
[1:42:26] anybody could knee cut anybody could cut
[1:42:28] the hair and look dandy and
[1:42:30] sprite in whatever it is that's fine but
[1:42:32] you know what it's temporary
[1:42:37] our young men inside looking handsome
[1:42:39] and strong and defending temporary you
[1:42:40] know
[1:42:41] put 50 years on your youth you're still
[1:42:44] behind someone strong
[1:42:46] but not as handsome as strong as you are
[1:42:47] now
[1:42:49] i don't want to rough i don't want to
[1:42:51] disturb anybody
[1:42:53] who over 50 and hunt someone strong i
[1:42:54] don't want to disturb anybody whatsoever

[1:43:18] than the streets only coming

[1:43:23] my revival

[1:43:28] for looking for that revival i might be
[1:43:30] tired physically but not tired i'm
[1:43:32] looking for something

[1:43:47] you have faith you believe you believe
[1:43:49] prophet are no works

[1:44:13] glory to god but branham said
[1:44:16] we don't want the popular idea we want
[1:44:19] the truth

[1:44:21] what god said as the truth
[1:44:23] oh blessed being of the lord hallelujah
[1:44:27] listen to this jonah didn't want to go
[1:44:30] it was a responsibility he choose the
[1:44:33] easy way

[1:44:37] and when god here we go tells you
[1:44:40] something
[1:44:41] you have got to do it nobody
[1:44:44] else we have got to face up to do it

[1:45:18] roof than a nagging wife
[1:45:21] because i bother something the nagging
[1:45:23] like a drip
[1:45:24] nagging nagging
[1:45:28] nagging
[1:45:32] and when somebody's not satisfied
[1:45:34] they're complaining
[1:45:36] whiny no joy in the testimony
[1:45:41] complaining complaining complaining
[1:45:44] ask yourself what you can do in your
[1:45:45] situation why not praise worship
[1:45:48] be content do something different
[1:45:51] because brother branham says complain
[1:45:53] and
[1:45:53] weakens your faith so god don't want to
[1:45:56] complain in people
[1:45:57] he called it to be a peculiar people if
[1:45:59] your road is rough that's your road walk
[1:46:02] on it
[1:46:03] [Applause]
[1:46:06] if your road is tough that's your road
[1:46:08] walk on it
[1:46:09] don't let the devil treat you that's not
[1:46:11] your road at the end of the road is
[1:46:13] where god wants you to be
[1:46:19] hallelujah
[1:46:23] listen let us
[1:46:26] consider one another that's a nice one
[1:46:29] you want to be kind you want to be
[1:46:31] helpful
[1:46:32] you want to put your brother first some
[1:46:34] people like themselves first and their
[1:46:36] family second
[1:46:37] and they absolute and after that
[1:46:38] themselves again
[1:46:41] and after that their family and after
[1:46:43] that themselves again and they make a
[1:46:44] circle right there
[1:46:45] end of story but when you begin to
[1:46:48] extend yourself and see
[1:46:50] a bigger picture to consider one another
[1:46:52] how is this brother going how is this
[1:46:54] sister going
[1:46:55] and one word one call one text one tweet
[1:46:59] one email one encouragement one word one
[1:47:02] word just one word
[1:47:04] all i need one word one hallelujah
[1:47:08] oh my i feel good i wanna close but
[1:47:12] something
[1:47:13] is moving i have a good audience the
[1:47:14] other day good to be here
[1:47:17] watch provoke on the love and the good
[1:47:21] works
[1:47:23] some people like provocation who like
[1:47:25] provocation
[1:47:27] but provoke onto a purpose does some
[1:47:30] people like to provoke make jokes and
[1:47:31] carry on but
[1:47:32] encourage people to good works
[1:47:36] not forsaken the assembling ourselves
[1:47:38] together
[1:47:40] as the manner of some is today
[1:47:44] where home now becomes the option
[1:47:46] because they could hear it
[1:47:48] on the internet or whatever but
[1:47:51] exhorting one another
[1:47:52] so much the more as we see the day
[1:47:56] approaching so as the day approaching
[1:47:58] there shouldn't be less fellowship
[1:48:00] it should be more it shouldn't be less
[1:48:03] coming to church it should be more
[1:48:05] because god will bring present tense
[1:48:07] word that is why we try to yield
[1:48:09] ourselves to the spirit to find out what
[1:48:11] is god's mind
[1:48:12] for the all what is our responsibility
[1:48:15] and you can accept it
[1:48:17] and then do something about it not
[1:48:19] forsaking ourselves
[1:48:20] just as someone together as the man or
[1:48:22] some is but exhorting one another
[1:48:24] even as the day approaches
[1:48:27] may the lord bless you god bless you
[1:48:31] oh hallelujah
[1:48:32] [Applause]
[1:48:39] but this is my burden today to provoke
[1:48:42] one another
[1:48:43] under love and good words friends
[1:48:45] everyday the devil battling people
[1:48:47] people shouting today and tomorrow
[1:48:49] they're never slapping them up
[1:48:54] and they come in with a smile but
[1:48:56] they're battered
[1:48:57] they're broken they're heard and you
[1:49:00] just need somebody to put their hand
[1:49:01] around them
[1:49:02] and encourage them why don't you stand
[1:49:03] and greet somebody in jesus
