the end of time time is about to run out the Angels swore time shall be no more help us this morning and speak to our hearts as we wait on you in Jesus name I ask it amen God bless you welcome thanks for coming and if you have your Bibles I'd like you to turn to Ezekiel chapter 3 verse 17- 21 St John 1 verse1 and 1 Peter 4 verse1 17 Reading Ezekiel chapter 3 reading from verse 17 son of man I have made thee a Watchman over the house of Israel therefore hear the word at my mouth and give them warning from me when I see unto the wicked thou shal surely die and thou givest him not warning nor speakest to warn the wicked from his Wicked way to save his life the same Wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will I require at thine hand yet if thou warn the wicked and he turn not from his wickedness nor from his Wicked way he shall die in his iniquity but thou has delivered thy Soul again when a righteous man do turn from his righteousness and commit iniquity and I lay a stumbling block before him he shall die because thou Hast not given him warning he shall die in his sin and his righteousness which he had done shall not be remembered but his blood will I require a thine hand nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man that the righteous man sin not and he do not sin he shall surely live because he is warned also thou was delivered thy Soul St John 1 verse one in the beginning in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God 1 Peter chapter 4 reading verse 17 for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God may we bow our head one more time and pray heavenly father I am in needy of you Lord and I know what you put up on my heart and what you have for your people here this morning I am not qualified to even speak these things but you give them and we have to speak them help us tonight we ask in Jesus name amen and amen you may be seated praise the name of the Lord God bless you greet you in Jesus name thanks again for coming outall uh this is a blessing and a privilege and opportunity we wouldn't always have this opportunity okay so let's go this the prayer with bom prayed oh heav Hy father I want to express if I can this morning how in my heart I feel towards one the holiest of holies coming down to the Earth and to redeem a sinner like myself and I'm sure that these ministers that's present now can feel the same way that is what by your grace that we have been made the Ministers of this Covenant that th has given with Adam's Fallen race and we are here this morning father gathered for no other purpose but to study to know rather the will of God and what we must do to make Christ real to the people of this generation knowing surely that in the day of judgment we will be brought face to face with this generation and being ministers we will be judges and the people to which we have spoken to and their attitude towards the word that we bring them will determine their Eternal destination therefore Lord in that day we would be a judge for or against the generation that we preach to praise the name of the Lord he continue on to say father God please through Jesus name let us not say one word that would be wrong but may we have sincere hearts and open minds that we might receive the things that is yours that we might be able to go out into a different Fe of work after today and be better equipped because of our meeting with you this morning granted Lord won't you come and be our speaker and our ears and our tongue and our thoughts let the meditation of my heart heart thoughts of my mind and all that is within me and Within These Brethren and sisters may be acceptable in thy sight Lord that we might be so filled and charged with thy Spirit of thy presence here that the room not so much the building that we are sitting in but the building that we are living in become alog together a cloud of the glory of God we might leave here this morning so filled with the holy spirit that we would be more determined than ever before in life to carry the message to the dying generation that we're living in hear us Lord and speak to us through Thy word for we ask it in the name of thy son Our Savior Jesus Christ amen pray what a prayer amen oh blessed be the name of the Lord surely knowing in the day of judgment we will be brought face to face with this generation and being ministers we will be judges and the people to which we have spoken to which is you sitting here right this morning and the church for all these years and the people to which we have spoken to and they at itude towards the word that we bring them will determine their Eternal destination this morning I have a title give them warning from me and that is taken from Ezekiel chapter 3 read that scripture there I of a subject the word is God I have an inspiration a warning the words of the Prophet Ezekiel that's whatever titled is ispiration a warning the words of the Prophet Ezekiel now Jesus in Matthew 7:15 said Beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing these are men of the cloth these are men with Bibles these are men with Ministries these are men with on TVs and so on like that beware of false prophets be conscious be aware but but but they come to in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravening woles you shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes or tones or figs or titles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is heun down and cast Into the Fire whereby by their fruits you shall know them not everyone one that say unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven so not the Lord Lord not the shouters not the the singers and the specialist no no no not everyone who say Lord Lord but they that do the will of My Father which many will come to me in that day we talking about Christians now we talking about church members now we talking about message folks now many will come to me that day Lord have we not prophesied in thy name in thy name have cast out devils in thy name have done many wonderful work and I will profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity oh blessed be the name of the Lord praise God the part so this is not a game now we coming down to Brass where the tire hits the road this is not a game now if you thought was a game it's not a game now this is the word of the Lord in the beginning was the word the words was with God and in case you didn't know this morning the word is still got this morning oh give the Lord a praise Hallelujah I would have liked to take it in a bit of sequence but I don't think that I will be able to get through that and I don't not even sure if I'll get through what I have this morning but then when God started speak to Ezekiel in Chapter 2 he told Ezekiel he said for there impudent children stiff hearted do send th do send thee unto them and thou shalt say unto them thus sayeth the Lord whether they will hear or whe will for beer for they have they are rebellious house and then he went on to say and thou shalt speak my words unto them whether they will hear whether they will forbear for they are most rebellious but thou son of man hear what I say unto thee be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house open thy mouth and eat what I give thee this is Ezekiel Chap 2:8 and when I looked Behold a hand was sent unto me and a roll of a book was therein and he spread it within me uh before me it was written within and without and there was written there in Lamentations and mourning and wo chapter 3:1 said moreover he said unto me son of man eat that which thou finest eat this roll and go and speak to the house of Israel so I opened my mouth and he caused me to eat that Ro and he said unto me son of man cause thy belly to eat and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee then I did I eat it and it was in my mouth as honey and sweetness he said unto me son of man go get thee unto the house of Israel and with my words speak unto them but thou not come unto a strange people and strange speech and a hard language but to the house of Israel oh blessed be the name of the Lord and people in the message are long enough they know lots of message

prophesy out of their own Hearts yes hear ye the word of the Lord thus sayth the Lord God now remember they not pastor preaching there's another teacher saying these things this is God speaking to Ezekiel a word warning a word thus sayth the Lord woe unto the foolish prophets that follow their own spirit and have seen nothing oh Israel thy prophets are like foxes in the desert ye have not gone up into the gaps neither made up the heads of the House of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the Lord they have seen vanity and ly designation sayth the Lord the Lord sayth and the Lord had not sent them the Lord had not sent them but they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word but the Lord did not send them have you not seen a vain Vision have you not spoken lying

Bible to church meditate on the word day and night I think in a certain sense the Bible on the on on the phone is almost like a negative it's different from the physical Bible and it doesn't have the continuity that you're spinning the pages and what I I don't find it the flow there somehow it's not it's just not cutting it it's good to have it there to take a read taxi or Maxi or cow or something like that that but it's nothing like the pages of the Bible Ezekiel 14 and I want to read that idolatry is the worship of a object a person an idea as if it were God blind Devotion to something or someone that is ideology placing men culture race politics Sports technology any man above the word of God that's IDE ideolog today when they having these Tech forums whether it's car whether is computer you have a lot of people and they saying this the best phone this the best car this the best just and people worship him because because now they getting to trust man because man brings all these in invention remember couple of years ago had no cell phone you know now his cell phone is a touch light it's a compass it's a calculator God have mercy the man who was inventing calculators and

give the Lord some Praises well you have a locator in your heart that is why who he found you he called that why he call you not for you to stay where you are but for you to come out from what you in that you could get delivered and get a breakthrough oh give the Lord a shout in the house hallelujah hallelujah Ezekiel [Applause] 14 verse two and the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man these men have set up their Idols in their heart and put the stumbling block of the iniquity before their face should I be inquired of all by them in other words you have that Idol in your heart and you're going to inquire of God and you have your idol inside of there he don't want a physical Idol he don't want Idol inside your heart therefore verse four speak unto them and say unto them thus sayth the Lord God every man of the house of Israel that set it up his in his heart and putteth the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face and cometh to the prophet I the Lord will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart because they are all estranged from me through their Idols so idolatry exrain you from God you could make your car an idol you could make your house an idol you could make your children an idol you could make your money an idol you could make whatever you choose to be an idol and that ex strange you from God because you put that firstall years ago I told housewife I I said listen I said listen put God first don't put your children first your children get big and leave here put God first Hallelujah don't put your children first put God first die from a child don't don't die your child your child back for your all better believe me what I'm saying here therefore say unto the house of Israel thus sayeth the Lord God repent and turn yourselves from idols and turn away from your faces from all Abominations for everyone of the House of Israel or a stranger that sit in Israel which separate himself from me and set up his idols in his heart and put his tumbling block of his iniquity before his face and cometh to a prophet inquire of him concering me I the Lord will answer him by myself and I will set my face against that man and will make a sign and a proverb I will cut him off from the midst of my people and he shall know that I am the Lord and if the prophet be deceived when he had spoken a thing I the Lord have deceived that Prophet I will stretch out my hand upon him and will destroy him from the midst of My People Israel and they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity the punishment of the Prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh unto him and the house of Israel may go more no more astray from me the object is this that the house of Israel May no more go astray from me neither be polluted anymore with all the transgression but they will be my people and I may be their God say the Lord God the object is always to keep you in line always keep you to be his people always to keep you a part of his love that's the object Hallelujah huj Give the Lord some praises wow Revelation chapter 13 familiar scripture I stood in the S of the sea and saw beast and this is America this is America I saw a beast R out of the sea even seven heads and 10 horns upon his horns 10 crowns upon his heads the name of blasphemy and the Beast which I saw was that like unto a leopard his feet feet of a beer his mou mou of a land dragon give him his power and his seat and his great Authority I saw one of his heads he was wounded to death his deadly womb was healed and all the word wanded after the Beast he the part and they worshiped the dragon which give power unto the Beast and they worshiped the Beast saying who's like unto the Beast who's able to wake more with him and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and powers given to him to continue 40 and two months he open his mouth in blasphemy against God to blashe his name his Tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven it was given unto him to make war with the the Saints here we go and to overcome them and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and Nations so this beast power will have tremendous power but the BAM call it political physical and spiritual demonic power a three-fold cord but the branam also said the United Nations has have the laws they're only waiting for Dynamics to enforce them they're looking for the season and time to enforce the laws that they already have covid-19 manufactured or cocked up by China however

what they have in China right now I understand it break out in Europe and in now some part of America so that means if that continue like that is another wave coming and it will bring some more laws to come so if you think it will get better and easier it will not yes and you have to get tougher you have to get stronger you have to believe what God said because no weapon form against it going to prosper you have to believe what God said he would cover you with his blood he would cover you with his protection you have to believe what God said if you walk in fear it will get you oh if you walk and lose your fear it will get you oh glory to God but you have to believe what God Said glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you know what strike me just on there b Hallelujah because I just

in and run in three or four terms and taking over just a preliminary dictatorship never saw that one before but George he called Rosevelt a preliminary dictatorship I can prove to you that in the scripture that is right we haven't got no more Constitution she's broken to Pieces everything is smattered the Republicans is just as bad is six or one half a does the other like I say Satan own Democrats and the devil own the Republicans just two different names hanging up there and them feel is more Godly and they more Godly than the democ because have LG they have the alphab community LG M and what they have all that side there and then the other but BR let me tell you not skinning woman I'm wanting man to understand this too this nation is a woman's Nation I can show by the scriptures and prove to you what appears in our money a woman and there she is in Revelation number 13 she started with 13 stars 13 stripes 13 colonies 13 everything 13 she appears in the 13th chapter of Revelation in 1933 when the Lord when he was having meetings over here where the Church of Christ is standing now the old Masonic Home the vision of the Lord came to me up here predicted that Germany would rise up and remember and only 4i and whatnot Roosevelt and them things and then we come and make a for perfectly just exactly and come to pass that the cars will be getting more and more like an egg and in last days they'll be shaped like an egg now I said it will come to pass that those cars will not run by a steering wheel it will be something other run it's them cars right you okay now I remember in that day here we go before the end time comes before the end time comes that a woman and you keep this wrote down there will be a great powerful woman raised up either be president or dictator or some great powerful woman in this United States and she will sink under the influence of woman now remember that is th sayeth the Lord let continue now he said now he said I preach remember about the overthrow of the American government so he's prophesying that the government of America will be overthrown and how I said he raised up in Paris Satan Satan after we saved them over from the woman whne and big time and he L it down in Hollywood so he said the worst place was Paris with woman and whatnot and then the the devil take his business and move it over to Hollywood because Hollywood had the power to spread it more Paris was just Paris and Hollywood now have all the TV and the movies and what he went on further to say that the Devils will be coming through television influences coming through the television witchcraft Harry Potter big wings and all kind of stuff they're going to have and people just saying glum they taking H Vision right down so the Devil is a business man he looking to spread his business and he looking to spread it that they become more effective so you understand it's so not going to more tele uh like going to the movies that doesn't exist movie The no right through the television hit it Hollywood now now you find all them Hollywood people most of them into witchcraft most of them into gay and all kind of filthy and perverses living that coming out more and more more will come out more of them is very very filthy more of them in prison right now praise God with underage children being with on and all of that is there right now that's Hollywood like these stars that looking like so strong and healthy and powerful and they're weak glory to God they're weak weak men Oh Glory to God and they are stars and they are way call it stars and whatnot and and the Emmy and the grammies and whatnot and they are Boo in the sight of God oh glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God you said watch something in 1933 this is a woman Nation is number 13 it appears 13 chapter and so forth right he said thus sayth the Lord remember thus sayeth the Lord there will be a woman rule before the end time she'll either be president or vice president or it will be the Catholic Church as a woman I've seen her a great woman and a nation bow to her thus says the Lord and I'll just okay here it is now so so so so right now in know the time I always keep wondering where did he get this old man from this Walking Dead Man Joe Biden of all the people in America this Ancient Man of all the people they could find is this man and he come in response to to to Donald Trump and I guess Donald Trump was he can't even understand how a man walking dead could beat him so that just think by itself but let's say this way walking dead did beat him I beat him comprehensively too but then I always believe that whether it's Republican Or democrats one making a way for the other because it's Satan at work Satan have an agenda the men might be nice don't think you know when they sit on that Throne the devil come and and and keep fing up the agenda so when Obama came he pick up the agenda of the alphabet community and legislated and so like that so now they had the freedom or whatnot and then of course General Trump he come on top of that I know what he last Trump think that people want to make him to be but he bring a different tone in America and now it coming back to election time now I don't see him getting a reward this Trump guy I see he couldn't judg the latest thing he did is to make a ad and this come out this week God made Trump now when that come out and say that the final St for me that shows that that man is right to be judged when you start to play with God like that God made Trump and when God 1946 when God made Trump God made Trump to rule America so he he what he's doing there he expressing his way to Christians and say hey I'm a little Messiah you see that man that's man putting him no he know what he's doing he Ain no fool he's an idol to most of them and God do judge idolatry God will judge that man oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah so I was wondering if this old guy this Biden what is he about and then it come to me struck me something that kamla Harris that one VP that is almost invisible about she is one breath away you hear me she is one breath away from becoming president think on it those are the election coming that coming but I'm talking about what is on in front of us right now she is one breath away or one poison away but I'm telling you she's that close if that be so we are nearer than we think that's why I say this year is critical this year is a pivotal year in the history of the world right now Ukraine and Russia fighting that is stop hamus and Israel fighting that has stop and and Israel looking to hit Lebanon or some other right now so so the fighting like fires a fire here a fire there and I read this morning Russia giving free lessons in

Revelation 220 almost done we 18 going out at 19 notwithstanding our a few things against thee because th was suffer it or tolerate that woman Jezebel which called herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eating sacrifice to Idols now with this verse I want you to drop down here to verse 23 and see the proof of a great truth I have been bringing to you attention all along I will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he which search the Reigns and hearts I have been saying right along that there actually two churches though the spirit speaks to both of them in each age as though they were what one here it is plainly stated that they are churches and it states just as plainly as some of those churches most evidently do not know that he is the one one who search the Reigns and the hearts he is going to prove to them that it is so what churches will be those that do not know this truth of course it is a false Divine group because the True Believers certainly know that judgment begins at the house of God they being God-fearing judge themselves that they be not judged that's what we say for the communion judge yourself that you be not be judged now why does God call these churches his church his churches even though they are false Divine the truth of the matter is that they are Christians but they are not Christians of the spirit they are Christians of the flesh they are bearing the name in vain Mark 77 how be in vain to they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men
