[51:51] question we have to answer shall the Son
[51:54] of Man find faith when you return the
[51:57] new earth so many of the court said not
[51:59] find the church not find Christians well
[52:02] the Holy Ghost come will it be
[52:04] resurrected no will he find faith and

[52:18] and the ministers will reveal it to you
[52:20] praise God so and you know there's only
[52:23] one group that can answer that there's
[52:28] only one group on the face of the earth

[52:51] brother Jesse the plane oh he's been a
[52:54] friend for many many many years brother
[52:57] ben says there's something about all
[52:59] three you meet new ones and you make new
[53:07] friends but there's something about all
[53:08] friends and I like what proverbs said a
[53:12] friend is forever so it's my honor and
[53:16] privilege to bring up our precious
[53:18] brother Jesse in the play-doh he's been
[53:20] a blessing to the Bride of Christ across
[53:22] the world man has been to so many
[53:25] countries preaching this message stand
[53:28] it for the special of the hour
[53:29] and is is been invited to these meetings
[53:33] and I believe not one person is here by
[53:37] accident
[53:37] I believe God even knew what seat you'll
[53:42] be sitting on and I believe he knew what
[53:45] message would be preached this morning
[53:48] so we're not gonna sit back and let
[53:50] brother Jesse preachers of fire we came
[53:54] with a home fire this morning

[54:00] our features are welcome to precious and
[54:03] brother for the Jesse the play-doh as it

[56:53] praise then we give Him glory amen
[57:00] the Bible says enter into his presence
[57:04] with praise and thanksgiving praises
[57:09] wonderful name I appreciate being here
[57:13] this morning
[57:16] you may be seated just a moment while I
[57:19] greet you I tell you what this is
[57:24] perhaps
[57:50] Amen praise this wonderful name but we
[57:56] are here you know without a fight
[57:58] without complications without
[58:01] difficulties there is no way that we
[58:04] could expect the victory so when the
[58:09] devil fights fights in the way that he
[58:12] has fought this meeting and I'm sure
[58:14] that everybody has their own testimony
[58:18] of how well you see the devil don't want
[58:22] you to receive what you're going to
[58:26] receive this weekend did you hear what I
[58:29] said what you're going to receive not
[58:33] what you may receive are hoping to
[58:37] receive but what you're going to receive
[58:40] this weekend hallelujah amen and I
[58:44] believe this is a special meeting and a
[58:47] special time amen for the bride of Jesus
[58:50] Christ and especially during what I
[58:55] believe is a very important theme of
[58:58] this message of this convention amen
[59:03] what a question when a son of man cometh
[59:05] shall he find faith on the earth and I
[59:09] like what brother Thompson said that you
[59:12] know there's gonna be a people and only
[59:16] a people can answer that and I'm so
[59:20] thankful that there are quotes and
[59:24] things like brother Graham style I'll
[59:26] just read it sometime if I get a chance
[59:29] but when God makes a promise the promise
[59:34] goes out and he's obligated to his word
[59:39] he's not obligated to what I say or what
[59:42] other people say and what we make
[59:44] there are many made-up promises you know
[59:47] but he's not obligated to that he's
[59:50] obligated to his word and since he is
[59:54] obligated to his word then he himself
[59:58] Amen made sure aimin that he becomes the
[1:00:02] answering of his own word hallelujah so
[1:00:08] how can we fail Amen so we by faith Amen
[1:00:13] the elected of God this portion of the
[1:00:17] bride of Jesus Christ can save not only
[1:00:20] just by saying it but by divine
[1:00:23] revelation Amen yes Lord you will find
[1:00:28] faith on the earth praise God amen
[1:00:33] and I'm here to tell you is not just
[1:00:36] saying it Amen is manifesting it Amen
[1:00:39] hallelujah so we is manifesting time you
[1:00:44] know Amen because the harvest time is
[1:00:46] here but I I don't want to
[1:00:49] I do have should I say schedule to
[1:00:54] follow and I don't want to keep you too
[1:00:56] long but anyway I just want to say I am
[1:00:59] so delighted to be back in South Africa
[1:01:02] and the first time I walked the streets
[1:01:10] of South Africa and this great beautiful
[1:01:12] country was 28 years ago I was a young
[1:01:17] man of twenty years old and so you know
[1:01:24] it seems always that when I returned to
[1:01:28] South Africa although I am getting a
[1:01:31] little older I just feel a little
[1:01:33] younger here for some reason I just
[1:01:37] it's the anointing that makes you feel
[1:01:40] amen all that singing last night and the
[1:01:43] singing this morning a man I feel like
[1:01:46] Aaron's all rod that just was put in the
[1:01:50] Shekinah glory amen
[1:01:52] it couldn't help but Amen blossom and
[1:01:56] yield almonds amen whenever you are in
[1:01:59] the presence of God you can never be the
[1:02:03] same again go away be to God
[1:02:08] listen you cannot enter the presence of
[1:02:11] God and remain the same amen you're
[1:02:14] going to either change for the better or
[1:02:17] you're gonna change for the worse but
[1:02:19] something is gonna change amen glory be
[1:02:24] to God Amen hallelujah glory be to God
[1:02:28] so I just want to take this opportunity
[1:02:30] before I just get too excited and I love
[1:02:33] preaching in South Africa because there
[1:02:37] are believers here that knows Amen the
[1:02:40] word there was a brother one time who he
[1:02:44] we had a conversation and he he he said
[1:02:48] he had visited South Africa and I of
[1:02:50] course I won't mention any names or
[1:02:52] anything like that but you know he well
[1:02:55] he try to preach something that is well
[1:03:00] not quite aligned with the word you know
[1:03:04] and I told a brother I said brother when
[1:03:08] you go to South Africa you better know
[1:03:11] what you're talking about because South
[1:03:16] Africa knows the word knows the message
[1:03:19] Amen so I'm so thankful for that you
[1:03:22] know why because we all not only South
[1:03:25] Africa thought the problem that I have
[1:03:29] seen in this message and too many people
[1:03:31] do not know the message
[1:03:34] and this is why they're so easily tossed
[1:03:37] about to and fro faith can only rest on
[1:03:43] the world and nothing else and I love to
[1:03:49] see a believer that's resting on the
[1:03:53] world hallelujah to the lamb hey man so
[1:04:00] if you're not you you cannot rest on
[1:04:04] interpretation
[1:04:05] you cannot rest on man's idea your faith
[1:04:09] becomes restless you come in and out up
[1:04:12] and down but if you ever amen
[1:04:16] put your faith on the Word of God that
[1:04:19] word will never return to Him void but
[1:04:23] shall accomplish the purpose he sent it
[1:04:26] for no repeats of God what a mighty God
[1:04:29] we serve today
[1:04:31] hey I'm here to brag about Jesus you
[1:04:35] know praise God amen glory you may be
[1:04:39] seen at a moment in amens OCC I'm just
[1:04:43] kissy this is what happens in South
[1:04:45] Africa amen your whole message is it
[1:04:48] goes out in your comments you know in
[1:04:50] just your introduction it's just to pull
[1:04:53] hey man Amen so I'm enjoying this
[1:04:56] because I have been to places obviously
[1:04:59] that you preach you try to get people to
[1:05:02] understand their promises for their day
[1:05:04] and you know they give you a nod yeah
[1:05:07] that's a good good point I'm not talking
[1:05:12] about a good point you know I'm talking
[1:05:13] about a revelation hallelujah
[1:05:17] no repeat oh god I'm talking about the
[1:05:19] same revelation that John had Amen
[1:05:24] nobody explained it to John he realized
[1:05:27] Amen that if it wasn't for the Lamb of
[1:05:30] God that stepped forward and took the
[1:05:34] book oh he realized he was lost but when
[1:05:40] the lamb came forth and took the book he
[1:05:43] saw his name in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:05:46] and nobody had to tell John he be quiet
[1:05:54] be quiet no no no because now he was in
[1:05:58] the vision he saw himself redeemed he
[1:06:04] saw him he said I know my Redeemer
[1:06:07] liveth no repeats our God and no man can
[1:06:12] preach that to you no man can open that
[1:06:15] up to you because that comes by divine
[1:06:18] revelation and upon this rock brother
[1:06:22] Peter praise God upon this rock I'll
[1:06:25] build my church and the gates of Hell
[1:06:28] shall never prevail against the team
[1:06:30] head Oh hallelujah praise His name
[1:06:34] Oh praise this wonderful name God richly
[1:06:39] bless you I greet you in the name of the
[1:06:42] Lord Jesus Christ amen on behalf of my
[1:06:46] family and our little Church in Valley
[1:06:51] Stream I call it a little church and it
[1:06:55] is a little Church
[1:06:56] hey man and I'm not ashamed of that you
[1:06:58] know because you see that scriptural
[1:07:02] Jesus if you're not little flock
[1:07:07] what's your gut father's good pleasure
[1:07:10] to give you the kingdom amen
[1:07:13] and I'm not envious of those that have
[1:07:15] you know thousands whatever but you see
[1:07:17] God likes to deal with the little things
[1:07:23] you know so God richly bless you I am
[1:07:27] once again so privileged and honored to
[1:07:31] be here and I was so blessed to see
[1:07:39] yesterday some of my old okay let me
[1:07:43] correct that longtime friends hey man
[1:07:50] friends that haven't seen in a long time
[1:07:52] and it's so good to see a man friends
[1:07:56] that last year I was asking trying to
[1:07:59] figure out a man who was president in
[1:08:04] 1980 and the last time of there was at
[1:08:08] many hands I think there's a few more
[1:08:10] hands this convention
[1:08:13] amen those were so wonderful times in
[1:08:16] the Lord and we've come a long way and I
[1:08:23] think we have matured Aemon don't ever
[1:08:28] believe that you are going through
[1:08:31] whatever it is that you're going through
[1:08:33] it's in vain God has a plan God has a
[1:08:38] purpose and I want you to realize that
[1:08:42] your trial is custom-design
[1:08:49] you have a custom design trial because
[1:08:53] Amen what you are strong at in certain
[1:08:57] areas somebody else may not be as frog
[1:09:00] so he has to customize the trial if you
[1:09:06] have even more trials up God knows that
[1:09:09] you can carry it so don't worry about
[1:09:13] the trials don't worry about the burdens
[1:09:15] don't worry about all all all the devils
[1:09:19] have turned against me my family my
[1:09:21] church whatever well praise the Lord
[1:09:25] Amen because I'm gonna show I'm gonna
[1:09:28] tell you something here's the revelation
[1:09:31] when you feel that way what you feel in
[1:09:35] prison you can't here's the mystery
[1:09:39] there's power and praise you know
[1:09:43] because when Paul and Silas was put into
[1:09:46] jail coal they were put into jail amen
[1:09:56] they were incarcerated they were in
[1:09:58] Chains but that is the moment that they
[1:10:02] decided to have Church
[1:10:04] [Applause]
[1:10:08] poor look oh it's a Silas a second you
[1:10:11] know what sing a little bit I will
[1:10:14] praise the Lord brother they begin to
[1:10:19] sing and it begin to shake the prison
[1:10:23] and shake it and shake it and shake it
[1:10:26] in so much that the chains that was
[1:10:29] binding them set off the chains that
[1:10:33] were on their feet
[1:10:34] amen fell off the prison door bars
[1:10:39] networks closed swung open so if you're
[1:10:44] bound here's the secret
[1:10:46] you don't praise God because you're free
[1:10:49] you presume to get a man so now so many
[1:11:07] have gone before us and we miss those
[1:11:11] that are good friends and believers and
[1:11:15] great mighty men of God that have given
[1:11:19] their testimonies over the years and we
[1:11:24] learn by them what I like to do always
[1:11:29] is to take the good and take amen what
[1:11:33] is going to benefit me amen and move on
[1:11:36] and because here is what I want to say
[1:11:40] right now they are on the other side so
[1:11:45] now there's a great responsibility that
[1:11:49] has been placed upon those that alive or
[1:11:52] and remain
[1:11:54] because they now without us did you hear
[1:12:00] what I said
[1:12:01] now they without us cannot be made
[1:12:04] perfect so we have to come to perfection
[1:12:09] by the Word of God not by interpretation
[1:12:14] not by men's ideas but by the original C
[1:12:19] Word of God amen
[1:12:24] then we'll be able to call the others
[1:12:27] hallelujah that are in the grave
[1:12:30] hallelujah
[1:12:31] so shall we ever be with the Lord and
[1:12:34] like brother thompson said yesterday we
[1:12:38] have to climb up a little higher a man
[1:12:41] into a sphere amen that's gonna shake
[1:12:44] the whole world they mention shake and
[1:12:46] shake and shake brother not only the
[1:12:49] world but it's gonna shake the graves
[1:12:51] open this coming a resurrection then we
[1:12:58] have an appointment
[1:13:00] laura visa god amen
[1:13:04] so we which are alive and remain shall
[1:13:06] not a man shall be caught up together
[1:13:10] see with those that are asleep
[1:13:12] amen so therefore we have a
[1:13:15] responsibility I want to take this
[1:13:17] moment before I just get into this
[1:13:19] sermon real quick I want to thank
[1:13:22] brother
[1:13:22] Thompson foot and his wife and family
[1:13:26] they've been so welcoming to me and all
[1:13:31] of us and I and the tabernacle that so
[1:13:37] has worked so hard to make this a
[1:13:40] possibility never forget to pray for the
[1:13:43] local church because believe me while
[1:13:46] we're sound asleep many of them are
[1:13:48] still probably up hours of the night and
[1:13:52] trying to make us comfortable for the
[1:13:57] services and the convention so we
[1:13:59] certainly won't appreciate brother
[1:14:02] raymond thompson as his wife and
[1:14:05] my message believers church and of
[1:14:08] course all those that cooperated and I
[1:14:10] have enjoyed with the specials that have
[1:14:13] come forth I like my brother Peter says
[1:14:16] certain songs you hear certain specials
[1:14:19] you hear and others you you feel and I
[1:14:22] have felt everyone hey man oh I have
[1:14:26] felt everyone no repeats of God it's
[1:14:30] just just just heavily vibes coming into
[1:14:33] your heart they meant so God richly
[1:14:35] bless you and I want to take this
[1:14:37] opportunity
[1:14:38] well I bring greetings as I said for my
[1:14:40] wife and the original faith Gospel
[1:14:44] Tabernacle in Valley Stream on New York
[1:14:47] where we are a little group that is
[1:14:50] waiting amen for the coming of the Lord
[1:14:53] and we know that we have to stay very
[1:14:56] close and as close as possible with what
[1:15:00] the Prophet said brother Brown says say
[1:15:04] what I said and the problem has been
[1:15:07] over the years is that so many people
[1:15:10] have felt the authority I guess to to
[1:15:15] say what he said but then add a little
[1:15:16] here there and take a little here there
[1:15:18] and see but the seed has got to remain
[1:15:21] original can't be tampered with Amen
[1:15:25] because God doesn't need help
[1:15:28] his seed is perfect it doesn't need any
[1:15:32] help
[1:15:33] glory be to God amen and that seed is
[1:15:37] the word of God how on earth can we help
[1:15:42] God fulfill his word because it's not
[1:15:45] you fulfilling the word it's the seed in
[1:15:48] you that's coming to perfection
[1:15:52] glory be to God we cannot make it on our
[1:15:55] own no repeats our God but there's
[1:15:58] something inside of you amen striving to
[1:16:01] be perfected
[1:16:02] Amos striving to be adopted striving aim
[1:16:06] to be positionally plays hey man Oh
[1:16:11] hallelujah I'm feeling happy now hey man
[1:16:15] would you mind if I take off my coat hey
[1:16:20] man god bless you originally a man and
[1:16:23] what can I say Brock brother my good
[1:16:26] friend brother Peter Chandler amen
[1:16:30] yesterday's message time-tested faith
[1:16:33] amen did you appreciate the message from
[1:16:36] brother Peter I was tremendously blessed
[1:16:42] you know because there are people who
[1:16:44] claim they have faith and you realize
[1:16:48] that after a while after several years
[1:16:50] you realize that they have their faith
[1:16:54] begins to drain and and fade away and
[1:16:57] what is so sad that as brother at
[1:17:00] Thompson have said that I have had the
[1:17:03] privilege of traveling quite a bit and
[1:17:06] there's a brother who made a statement
[1:17:08] and said I have wasted 40 years of my
[1:17:11] life preaching this message and what a
[1:17:15] sad statement to hear from a minister
[1:17:19] who has been in a message for 40 years
[1:17:22] and say I have wasted my time amen
[1:17:26] so therefore there's a great falling
[1:17:27] away but when the son of man come in
[1:17:31] shall he find faith
[1:17:34] because he that endureth til the end
[1:17:36] he's the one that's going to be saying
[1:17:38] you see a falling off here fall in there
[1:17:42] you see all kinds of things on the
[1:17:44] internet and let me tell you something
[1:17:47] half of those people most of those
[1:17:49] people have never even met brother Brent
[1:17:52] oh but I am so blessed even here a
[1:17:58] brother like TL Osborn hey Amen who walk
[1:18:03] with brother Branham who saw the
[1:18:05] miracles now you know what is so much he
[1:18:07] said I seen God in that man I seen God
[1:18:14] walking in that man I think God working
[1:18:17] in that man hallelujah so I don't want
[1:18:20] this new a that's a snoo generation amen
[1:18:24] I don't give your manitto millennial or
[1:18:27] whatever it is brother
[1:18:28] I know this message is truth it is thus
[1:18:32] saith the Lord and all that we have need
[1:18:36] of is in this message hallelujah
[1:18:41] rapturing faith is in this message the
[1:18:45] resurrection is in this message
[1:18:47] adoption is in this message hallelujah
[1:18:50] glory be to God the final and the great
[1:18:54] kill is in this message hey man god
[1:19:01] bless you amen
[1:19:02] so anyway brother Peter Chandler thank
[1:19:04] you very much for that masterpiece last
[1:19:08] night a man I certainly did appreciate
[1:19:10] it was very blessed brother Peter
[1:19:12] Chandler has a way of just bringing
[1:19:15] things in a very simple way but powerful
[1:19:19] way you see because I I was telling him
[1:19:24] I said you know he comes from a
[1:19:26] different angle sometimes but boom he
[1:19:29] hits the mark right there and then you
[1:19:31] have another minister come the next
[1:19:33] service and comes to just slightly with
[1:19:34] a different angle and boom Lee is hits
[1:19:37] the bullseye and Akili I don't care how
[1:19:40] many angles you
[1:19:41] amen as long as we hit the bullseye amen
[1:19:46] glory be to God amen and I'm so thankful
[1:19:51] for this opportunity so god bless you
[1:19:53] richly right now I wish if you could
[1:19:57] stand to your feet
[1:19:58] Amen I feel a great anointing here this
[1:20:02] morning and I know that God is going to
[1:20:04] bless us amen you get only what you come
[1:20:08] expecting uh so I want to turn with too
[1:20:13] familiar scriptures that we know of
[1:20:15] course Malachi 4 Malachi 4 verse 5 and 6
[1:20:22] and I just want to pick up of course the
[1:20:25] theme of this instace convention because
[1:20:33] I believe that this is not just a
[1:20:37] question that we could just read look at
[1:20:44] and say okay that's a nice question this
[1:20:47] is a seasonal question this is a
[1:20:51] question for our age because if God is
[1:20:55] looking for faith he's got to provide a
[1:21:00] way to provide that which he's looking
[1:21:06] for and we're gonna find out by the
[1:21:08] grace of God even though people may or
[1:21:11] may not you know they may not see
[1:21:14] exactly but it's okay we're brothers and
[1:21:16] I always say the time has come amen
[1:21:21] brother Lee kindness never forget as we
[1:21:23] climb up the pyramid amen and as we
[1:21:27] approach amen that the great headstone
[1:21:31] has something has has got to have
[1:21:34] something to rest upon you see and never
[1:21:37] forget there's not many people that
[1:21:38] preach on the virtue of our age they
[1:21:43] talk about oh yeah all the power all the
[1:21:45] disa net but the virtue of our age let's
[1:21:47] not forget it
[1:21:49] amen because with if we ignore it we'll
[1:21:52] never go to the next step
[1:21:55] amen God Halloween because faith you
[1:21:58] know is based on forgiveness so let us
[1:22:03] turn to Malachi 4 and we'll read just
[1:22:07] two verses there Malachi 4 will read two
[1:22:12] verses there and verse four Malachi 4
[1:22:20] and verse rather verse 5 series on this
[1:22:24] wise behold I will send you Elijah the
[1:22:27] Prophet now before the coming of the
[1:22:32] Great and dreadful day of the Lord now
[1:22:35] listen he had a purpose
[1:22:38] he had a commission and he shall turn
[1:22:42] the heart of the father to the children
[1:22:46] and the heart of the children to their
[1:22:49] fathers lest I come and smite the earth
[1:22:53] with a curse and we realize and I have
[1:22:58] often tried to explain to denominational
[1:23:01] people that Malachi 4 Malachi 3 amen are
[1:23:05] two different messengers Amen so we at
[1:23:09] the end of the age remember we have have
[1:23:15] a promise to receive a messenger with
[1:23:20] the requirements of what would be needed
[1:23:25] that when he comes he will find exactly
[1:23:28] what he's needed in other words if I
[1:23:31] could rephrase it like this God has done
[1:23:33] his part and if we miss it is nobody
[1:23:37] else's fault but ours
[1:23:40] hey if we miss it it's know we we chose
[1:23:44] and have chosen to miss it we can't
[1:23:49] blame God for at all but I thought no no
[1:23:51] no no no Amen he did his part so let us
[1:23:54] turn to st. Luke 7 rather 18:8 look 818
[1:24:00] st. Luke rather 18 and verse 7 so about
[1:24:07] the unjust judge but I do want to drop
[1:24:10] in there when the Son of man cometh but
[1:24:12] verse 7 and shall not God avenge his own
[1:24:16] elect which cry day and night unto him
[1:24:20] though he bear long with them I tell you
[1:24:25] that he will avenge them speedily
[1:24:29] nevertheless when the Son of man cometh
[1:24:33] shall he find faith on the earth what a
[1:24:39] great question
[1:24:40] last trip to reading found in Jew and
[1:24:43] we'll have you have your seats found in
[1:24:51] Jude because what we realized my friend
[1:25:00] is that we realize that this faith that
[1:25:05] we are talking about is one faith
[1:25:09] there's only one faith one Lord one
[1:25:11] baptism Amen we I remember I preached a
[1:25:19] message is Christ divided
[1:25:21] way back way back in Chile Christ is
[1:25:26] never divided you know Christ is never
[1:25:31] divided we do by Christ it's the lack of
[1:25:36] revelation amen and that brings division
[1:25:40] we're the ones that device but let's
[1:25:44] read Jude 1:3 beloved when I gave all
[1:25:50] diligence to write unto you of the
[1:25:53] Commons
[1:25:53] salvation it was needful for me to write
[1:25:56] unto you and exhort you that ye should
[1:26:01] earnestly contend for the faith which
[1:26:05] was once delivered unto the Saints our
[1:26:11] Heavenly Father we have read your word
[1:26:14] Lord we realize that just about anyone
[1:26:17] can read the Bible lor those who you
[1:26:22] know have the ability of God to read the
[1:26:24] Bible but only you your spirit can
[1:26:27] follow that word so I asked your God
[1:26:30] that you would anoint this service in a
[1:26:34] special way and lord I pray for the next
[1:26:37] few minutes that it would be an
[1:26:38] encouragement to your people father Lord
[1:26:41] take me out of the way and I pray that
[1:26:43] your spirit would have Liberty father
[1:26:45] and may we realize the importance of
[1:26:48] this subject that brother God has given
[1:26:52] an inspiration to brother Raymond
[1:26:54] Thompson Lord I believe is timely it is
[1:26:57] in season father god we've got to
[1:27:00] recognize that God has done his part and
[1:27:03] we must do our part amen and if we do
[1:27:07] our part he will find faith on the earth
[1:27:10] amen hallelujah we ask it in Jesus name
[1:27:14] Amen and amen god bless you you may be
[1:27:16] seated
[1:27:17] amen are you feeling good praise God
[1:27:24] hallelujah I am feeling very well I feel
[1:27:30] the anointing of the Holy Spirit in this
[1:27:32] place a man and I had a message that I
[1:27:37] was about to bring to South Africa
[1:27:40] something that I had been meditating on
[1:27:44] and
[1:27:44] but the Lord gave me a message on the
[1:27:49] way here so I I put it together pretty
[1:27:55] quickly and excuse me I had to put some
[1:27:58] notes on on this notebook and a little
[1:28:00] bit on that notebook preachers know I
[1:28:02] guess what I'm talking about today man
[1:28:05] but I trust that God I just put it all
[1:28:07] together to make us understand amen so I
[1:28:10] was speaking on Tuesday to brother
[1:28:14] Raymond Thompson over dinner and we'd be
[1:28:18] good to speak on the inspiration of this
[1:28:21] meeting and what a question
[1:28:24] Amen the question is as when the son of
[1:28:29] man cometh shall he find faith to me
[1:28:32] that is a deep question amen
[1:28:37] some people we realize and we walk out
[1:28:40] of this place we're gonna find out you
[1:28:47] know denominations have faith they have
[1:28:50] faith to do things they have faith for
[1:28:52] healing they have all but that's not
[1:28:54] what I am talking about this morning
[1:28:56] this is not what we're talking about
[1:28:58] this morning we have our faith has got
[1:29:02] to reach a higher level brother Branham
[1:29:05] said we hardly have faith for divine
[1:29:08] healing amen but we have to have faith a
[1:29:11] man not only for divine healing but for
[1:29:15] the changing of the body no repeats of
[1:29:19] God amen just before the resurrection
[1:29:23] praise this wonderful name and I like
[1:29:26] when brother Branham talked about April
[1:29:34] 4th that promise son amen
[1:29:38] they were old and stricken in age we all
[1:29:41] know that but God promised it God
[1:29:44] promised the son
[1:29:46] amen and of course ishmael come around
[1:29:49] and you know the promise was slightly
[1:29:52] interrupted by reasoning let's do it
[1:29:56] this way or whatever that he no no but
[1:29:58] that's not what god said and he even
[1:30:01] testified when Abraham was about to
[1:30:04] sacrifice Isaac he said oh because you
[1:30:08] not have not withheld thy son thine only
[1:30:12] son thine only Son because a seed will
[1:30:19] not be heir what the shine praise God
[1:30:23] hallelujah amen you have been elected
[1:30:26] before the foundation of the world and
[1:30:29] I'm gonna tell you something it's not
[1:30:31] because you were a better person than
[1:30:34] somebody else Amen it wasn't because
[1:30:37] your parent or or your daddy was a
[1:30:40] priest huh that has nothing to do with
[1:30:43] it Amen because of before the foundation
[1:30:46] of the world one thing I like about
[1:30:48] election is that God is sovereign he
[1:30:53] doesn't have to ask anybody a man he
[1:30:58] chose Abraham and say him blessing I
[1:31:01] will bless thee in multiplying I will
[1:31:04] multiply thee praise God and I'm gonna
[1:31:08] give you an unconditional covenant for
[1:31:11] him I know you you you're doing a good
[1:31:13] job but you can't hold your part of the
[1:31:15] deal so therefore I am gonna give you an
[1:31:18] unconditional covenant praise God I am
[1:31:22] gonna keep both parts Amen hallelujah no
[1:31:26] repeats our God brother if that don't
[1:31:29] make you happy I don't know what will
[1:31:30] amen nothing present nor things to come
[1:31:34] shall be able to separate you from the
[1:31:38] love of God so devil bring it on huh
[1:31:41] Amen bring up the big guns
[1:31:44] because nothing present nor things to
[1:31:47] come
[1:31:49] to separate me from the love of God
[1:31:53] that's when a person has a revelation
[1:31:56] that's a person that cannot be shaken by
[1:31:59] denomination cannot be shaken by false
[1:32:02] interpretation he's standing on a rock
[1:32:05] and that bridge will hold across the
[1:32:12] bridge they'll be no sorrow hallelujah
[1:32:18] hallelujah but listen if there is a
[1:32:22] question here is what I want to say if
[1:32:25] there is a question then there is an
[1:32:27] answer if there is a question when the
[1:32:33] son of man come in
[1:32:35] shall he find faith that is a question
[1:32:38] and if there's a question there it's got
[1:32:40] to be an answer and let me tell you
[1:32:42] something you may think that God doesn't
[1:32:45] know the answer but he has already
[1:32:47] answered the question he just wants to
[1:32:52] get you the revelation that the question
[1:32:55] has already been answered so this scene
[1:33:06] this convention Amen is very
[1:33:09] thought-provoking and ministers and
[1:33:12] believers and church members or laity
[1:33:15] deacons I just should really go home and
[1:33:20] not only home but throughout this
[1:33:23] meeting and think about this question
[1:33:25] because it is very important amen
[1:33:29] when the Son of man cometh shall he find
[1:33:31] faith Amen so I trust that the
[1:33:34] convention when it's all said and done
[1:33:36] we would understand Amen that this is
[1:33:40] not just a question for just a short
[1:33:45] period of time this is a question for
[1:33:49] the age
[1:33:52] it sounds simple people have read it
[1:33:55] many times but the deeper you you read
[1:33:59] it and you go into it and you go into it
[1:34:01] and you say you know this is something I
[1:34:04] must have this is something that is not
[1:34:10] optional this is something that if I
[1:34:15] don't have it
[1:34:17] hallelujah amen
[1:34:19] I will not be able to go and there is no
[1:34:22] one to blame but yourself I like that
[1:34:25] amen you see when God made a promise and
[1:34:29] he's always throughout the ages brother
[1:34:32] Branham said in each age when God said a
[1:34:36] certain thing would happen he come here
[1:34:42] comes that man along
[1:34:46] behold I'll send you Elijah the Prophet
[1:34:49] now here's the preparation of the faith
[1:34:53] that we all need to have he's taking
[1:34:58] care of his word listen because the word
[1:35:02] cannot fail or fall to the ground
[1:35:04] because his reputation is on the line
[1:35:07] now hey man listen so in each age go
[1:35:12] when God said a certain thing would
[1:35:15] happen he come here come that man along
[1:35:19] and manifest that so somebody
[1:35:23] manifests what has already been spoken
[1:35:27] [Applause]
[1:35:29] the first is a manifestation of the
[1:35:33] spoken word but let us continue here
[1:35:38] well here come that people along
[1:35:41] and live that Oh hallelujah
[1:35:47] here come that people along and live
[1:35:50] that so you just can't say I agree with
[1:35:54] that it's not enough to agree with that
[1:35:58] it's only enough
[1:36:00] Ament to live that say Amen somebody
[1:36:05] praise God amen and only the elected
[1:36:09] seat of God can ever live that you know
[1:36:12] why let me tell you the reason why a man
[1:36:16] had it's God Himself living in the
[1:36:19] people Amen because is the answering of
[1:36:23] his word oh I'm just gonna walk around a
[1:36:29] pulpit here just a moment God promised
[1:36:32] the promise he asked the question but
[1:36:36] he's not waiting on you and I to really
[1:36:39] manifest these things because we cannot
[1:36:42] do it in ourselves you know why because
[1:36:46] it'll be gone in the people because it's
[1:36:52] the answering of his word Christ in you
[1:36:57] you you you you you you answering the
[1:37:00] question when the son of man cometh will
[1:37:04] he find faith on the earth yes he will
[1:37:07] he will find manifest his sons of God he
[1:37:11] will find adopted sons of God he will
[1:37:14] find mature sons of God you're not the
[1:37:20] belief brother Graham say it or not the
[1:37:24] believer you know have it in your flesh
[1:37:28] to believe this
[1:37:29] God has to put something in you before
[1:37:33] the foundation of a world to believe
[1:37:37] this no repeater come that's the
[1:37:46] difference
[1:37:47] others will try to figure out
[1:37:49] intellectually but the real believer is
[1:37:51] not a word okay explain this to me
[1:37:54] explain that to me listen God is not
[1:37:58] known by explanation he's known by
[1:38:02] revelation and once you get it brother
[1:38:07] there's not a demon that can take it
[1:38:10] from you hey man you're on your way to
[1:38:14] the resurrection hey man I'm feeling
[1:38:25] good for the home ah ha ha hallelujah so
[1:38:28] therefore listen you can be seated a
[1:38:30] moment just so I can get my breath I'm
[1:38:33] not as young as the Houston amen
[1:38:38] so the question is and was not will he
[1:38:41] find good people there are many people
[1:38:44] many good people out there not will he
[1:38:47] find churches plenty of churches and in
[1:38:52] fact I will say this with respect than
[1:38:54] everything else that years ago
[1:38:58] and remember our the first time I was
[1:39:00] here was 28 years ago and everywhere I
[1:39:04] travel amen I see that there are more
[1:39:09] and more churches they say in America is
[1:39:14] like McDonald's there's the money if
[1:39:17] McDonald's in every corner
[1:39:19] and we're so divine it in that sense you
[1:39:23] know that everybody has to you know be
[1:39:26] uh whatever and I'm not here to judge
[1:39:29] that at all I'm just here to make a
[1:39:30] point all right so so therefore we're
[1:39:34] more defiant sometimes when we could see
[1:39:38] and recognize the move of God in some
[1:39:41] man's life and church
[1:39:43] what don't you unite with them and just
[1:39:45] put your shoulder to the wheel amen
[1:39:48] there used to be one like when I first
[1:39:49] came here you hardly had any auditorium
[1:39:52] that can fill the these conventions it's
[1:39:56] a because it was an innocence of of
[1:39:59] people that just love to be together but
[1:40:03] something has happened over the years
[1:40:05] Amen that has divided amen and I'm gonna
[1:40:10] tell you who that person is that is the
[1:40:12] cause of division that's the devil
[1:40:17] that's the devil the devil loves
[1:40:23] division the devil loves when you speak
[1:40:27] mean to somebody the devil loves when
[1:40:31] you don't want to call a person that
[1:40:35] just offended you he loves that so let
[1:40:38] us make it clear right now who is the
[1:40:42] person behind that that is the devil
[1:40:46] amen
[1:40:47] but in this day and age we must be we
[1:40:51] cannot have these situations get us out
[1:40:55] of focus of what we're looking for
[1:41:00] because there are so many distractions
[1:41:02] today that if we're if we get involved
[1:41:05] in every distraction we will miss the
[1:41:10] real
[1:41:12] promised to the bride you know the Bible
[1:41:18] says in in rubley a rather hebrews
[1:41:21] chapter 11 speaks of this man call Enoch
[1:41:26] and Enoch Hanna testimony he nakata
[1:41:32] testimony that he pleased God he walked
[1:41:35] with God amen he had this testimony and
[1:41:39] you know what's the beautiful thing
[1:41:42] about this is that God Amon vindicated
[1:41:46] that testimony Enoch was not testifying
[1:41:51] of himself now it was God who saw that
[1:41:55] Enoch
[1:41:56] please God this testimony his life the
[1:42:03] way he lived was so pleasing to God amen
[1:42:08] that he said this is the time that I am
[1:42:11] gonna call him home amen
[1:42:15] so the question that I have today we all
[1:42:19] have a testimony but what does God think
[1:42:22] of that testimony we all have that
[1:42:27] testimony what is God saying about that
[1:42:31] testimony we gonna write realize and
[1:42:34] bring it back to love you know a lot of
[1:42:37] people there with that love is a week no
[1:42:38] well yeah love is weak but is powerful
[1:42:42] amen but listen Enoch had a testimony in
[1:42:46] Hebrews chapter 11 and God vouch and
[1:42:51] recognized his testimony he pleased God
[1:42:54] and one day he was found not and just to
[1:42:59] show you that this is an individual
[1:43:01] affair it wasn't just Enoch and a whole
[1:43:04] bunch of people
[1:43:05] it was just anak who was so who lived in
[1:43:10] such a way that he pleased God and I
[1:43:14] want you to realize the day it is your
[1:43:16] end of
[1:43:17] usual walk with God that is giving
[1:43:20] testimony to God and is that testimony
[1:43:24] worthy of translation so when God
[1:43:35] Himself declares hears people say you
[1:43:38] won't bless God I am the greatest
[1:43:41] whatever you're testifying about
[1:43:43] yourself that's not what God's testified
[1:43:46] about you praise God hallelujah you
[1:43:49] watch people that is so bragging about
[1:43:53] their old ministries and who they are
[1:43:55] how big they are oh my I don't want to
[1:43:59] hear from you what you're saying that
[1:44:02] you are I want to hear from God what God
[1:44:05] what your manifesting glory be to God
[1:44:09] because we have driven away we have gone
[1:44:12] away from the life the true meaning of
[1:44:15] this message it is a life behind the
[1:44:18] name that makes the demons tremble it's
[1:44:22] the life behind the name hey that makes
[1:44:26] the proud hard humble glory be to God
[1:44:31] because in you if you are true seat of
[1:44:34] God if you are a true wheat man what is
[1:44:37] keeping you alive it is the life that is
[1:44:40] in you and whatever you whatever life is
[1:44:44] in you you cannot help but bear fruits
[1:44:48] others can't do it it's a different life
[1:44:53] amen let's let's let's move on but our
[1:44:56] faith has got to be ripen see a many to
[1:45:00] another level on our faith has to be
[1:45:03] matured a man has got to come to a place
[1:45:07] a man of maturity we've got to our faith
[1:45:11] it's all these years has been
[1:45:13] progressing progressing maturing you
[1:45:15] know brother Graham said in 1965
[1:45:18] intellectually we have listening we've
[1:45:20] been listening to the message but it had
[1:45:23] to lay in the presence of the Sun for a
[1:45:25] while
[1:45:26] too much or he realized that he see he
[1:45:31] sold the seed of the entire Bible for
[1:45:37] this body one now people may disagree
[1:45:43] with me I heard I've got some emails and
[1:45:45] so forth well I don't believe it's one
[1:45:47] man message and so forth yeah well you
[1:45:49] know what here's the thing I always
[1:45:52] believe and I'm very very positive about
[1:45:56] this brother I say what he said it's not
[1:46:02] my words he meant I say what he said the
[1:46:05] fire falls I walk out and is still
[1:46:08] anointed today people don't even want to
[1:46:13] hear tapes anymore they no longer want
[1:46:15] to do this or that they're trying to
[1:46:17] criticize this message over the internet
[1:46:20] but I'm gonna tell you something that
[1:46:21] this angel is still standing on the
[1:46:25] earth payment bringing up people back to
[1:46:28] perfection by the Word of God Oh
[1:46:31] hallelujah he still uses sake he still
[1:46:35] delivers hey man I've seen it Jesus
[1:46:40] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:46:42] forever
[1:46:43] he cannot change hallelujah but let's
[1:46:46] look at Anna
[1:46:47] he had a testimony praise God that he
[1:46:50] pleased God so what kind of testimony is
[1:46:53] my question what kind of testimony and
[1:46:56] this last days will we have that that
[1:47:01] Christ can recognize and say oh that's
[1:47:04] our testimony that is pleasing Jesus I
[1:47:07] said and you know the Bible says it is
[1:47:09] impossible to please God without faith
[1:47:15] so we must have a God
[1:47:22] hey man now
[1:47:25] here is what I'm going to get into the
[1:47:27] the sermon now just have a human I'm
[1:47:30] just going to try to abide by it sure
[1:47:33] about now listen look at in Matthew
[1:47:36] chapter 8 the Roman centurion listen to
[1:47:42] this is so beautiful this Roman
[1:47:46] centurion was not of religious
[1:47:49] background in fact he never claimed that
[1:47:54] he was religious or whatever but he had
[1:47:57] a problem and the problem was his
[1:48:00] servant was very sick very very sick now
[1:48:08] oh I love this because this is not a
[1:48:11] priest this is not a religious person
[1:48:13] this is this is a Gentile this is a
[1:48:16] Roman but you see he got her he had a
[1:48:19] revelation no doubt he was looking at
[1:48:21] Jesus from a distance and how the demons
[1:48:25] were being cast out by a word and and
[1:48:28] when you're in Lane and he's laying his
[1:48:30] hands on people they were walking the
[1:48:33] blind will see amen and he caught a
[1:48:35] revelation now now remember faith is a
[1:48:38] revelation because what he recognized he
[1:48:43] said you know what I am a man of
[1:48:44] authority and I have men under me that
[1:48:50] when I tell them to go they go when I
[1:48:53] tell them to come they come
[1:48:56] so he recognized that this man Jesus who
[1:49:02] was called Jesus had authority that he
[1:49:08] himself did not even have to go he sent
[1:49:12] his servants or whoever was to go for
[1:49:16] him and he told Jesus one day when he
[1:49:21] asked for the healing of a servant oh oh
[1:49:26] just hmm he said Jesus master hey I have
[1:49:32] a servant who is at home now remember he
[1:49:38] wasn't Christian because he said I'm not
[1:49:39] worthy you come under my house now you
[1:49:43] think that oh the religious people had
[1:49:46] to fail but this was a Roman since or
[1:49:49] again oh people are going to be very
[1:49:52] shocked that day they find out who makes
[1:49:55] it and who doesn't amen
[1:49:58] hallelujah people are all righteous and
[1:50:01] everything else or bless God I don't
[1:50:03] need God let me tell you something let
[1:50:05] me put let me bust your bubble we all
[1:50:07] have to come down we all need to faith
[1:50:09] this faith that I'm talking about and
[1:50:14] brother Branham said a righteous man is
[1:50:17] not a sinless man our righteous man is a
[1:50:21] man who recognized that when he sinned
[1:50:24] he gets right with God hallelujah people
[1:50:32] don't like to repent people don't like
[1:50:34] to make right with God they cannot be
[1:50:36] righteous but those that recognize when
[1:50:39] they have done role amen and go to God
[1:50:42] Norfolk give me that's a righteous man
[1:50:47] David was a man after God's own heart
[1:50:50] hey man he had his faith
[1:50:53] share a problem but he was a man after
[1:50:56] God's own heart sure he failed sure he
[1:51:00] made mistakes but he sought the Lord he
[1:51:03] sought the heart of God amen and that's
[1:51:06] the pride of Jesus Christ we're not
[1:51:09] ashamed to apologize to our brother
[1:51:12] we're not ashamed to say I'm sorry we're
[1:51:14] not ashamed to say you know I
[1:51:16] misunderstood you
[1:51:18] amen hallelujah that devil hates that
[1:51:21] but that's a righteous man
[1:51:23] [Applause]
[1:51:31] no way be to God hallelujah glory be to
[1:51:38] God so he said oh I'm not worthy come
[1:51:42] over the in my roof you know what but
[1:51:45] Speak the word only speak the word only
[1:51:49] but here's what I want to pour it out
[1:51:52] here right now
[1:51:54] speak that word only what a faith and so
[1:52:00] much that Jesus marveled he said you
[1:52:07] know I've been in Israel I've walked
[1:52:11] around in every village I've gone around
[1:52:14] every Amen case but I have not found
[1:52:19] this kind of faith in all of Israel why
[1:52:27] because somehow someway this Roman
[1:52:31] centurion his faith was on another level
[1:52:34] it was a spoken word faith it was out of
[1:52:39] season back then but is in season now
[1:52:43] speak the word only the sick will be
[1:52:47] healed by a word hallelujah the devil
[1:52:50] will shake a man
[1:52:52] louia and he's doing his best to divide
[1:52:55] us he's doing his best to boutique in
[1:52:58] the body but I'm gonna tell you Satan is
[1:53:00] too late too late there's gonna be a
[1:53:04] gathering of the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:53:07] amen she'll be flesh of his flesh bone
[1:53:10] of his gold life of his life the same
[1:53:12] power the same spirit the same anointing
[1:53:16] [Applause]
[1:53:18] [Music]
[1:53:21] [Applause]
[1:53:24] excuse me a minute ah
[1:53:26] I told brother John Conte last night
[1:53:30] brother if you don't have dancing shoes
[1:53:33] you better have dancing feet amen
[1:53:36] because I don't shoes or no shoes
[1:53:39] something on the inside if that doesn't
[1:53:42] make the believers if that doesn't make
[1:53:45] the elect of God amen charge with me
[1:53:50] hallelujah

[1:53:56] is the believer because it is the
[1:54:01] answering of his word I said will he

[1:55:22] of who God is now can I know you may be

[1:56:30] God promised before the Great and
[1:56:34] dreadful day of the Lord
[1:56:36] Neal said Elijah Hilton Malachi 4 but

[1:56:48] Malachi 4 and revelations 10 7 is going
[1:56:54] to do two things
[1:56:56] [Applause]
[1:57:00] [Music]
[1:57:02] not he may do two things because the
[1:57:09] Seventh Seal syndicated the Prophet so
[1:57:14] all seven seals must be broken in order
[1:57:18] for him to be vindicated and we today we
[1:57:24] preach vindicated prophet number one
[1:57:39] listen this is a quote said all gone
[1:57:42] Dolan don't attack me court you better
[1:57:44] hey man just go back to the quote and
[1:57:46] just read it yourself
[1:57:47] hey man I'm Jed I would just show just
[1:57:50] so blessed amen and have been for years
[1:57:53] according to Malachi for he will turn
[1:57:56] the hearts of the children to the
[1:57:59] father's and number two he will reveal
[1:58:05] the mysteries of the seven thunders in
[1:58:09] Revelations 10
[1:58:11] [Applause]
[1:58:21] [Music]
[1:58:27] which are the revelations contained in
[1:58:31] the seven seals
[1:58:33] listen number two he will reveal the
[1:58:36] seven of the mysteries of son funders in
[1:58:39] revelations 10 which are the revelations
[1:58:43] the revelations now revelations can only
[1:58:48] be be finally revealed or else it still
[1:58:52] remains a mystery and it's still a
[1:59:00] mystery to many people it was divinely
[1:59:05] revealed to the Prophet and as much as
[1:59:08] he could say he said it but he knew that
[1:59:12] somebody will see that the finally
[1:59:18] revealed truth I'm talking about you and
[1:59:24] I now amen we've got to come to
[1:59:27] perfection this is no matter let me just
[1:59:30] say this no matter how much you are in
[1:59:34] the message you can never get around
[1:59:37] this
[1:59:39] [Applause]
[1:59:42] this is a message on teaching statue of
[1:59:48] a perfect man Amen that ties the man in
[1:59:55] listen if you're going to be tied in
[1:59:58] this is a message on teach sheep so call
[2:00:04] it what you want to call it say what you
[2:00:08] want to say but the way to holiness the
[2:00:12] way the perfect faith is this way
[2:00:16] [Applause]
[2:00:30] now listen the seven thunders of
[2:00:33] Revelation says which are the
[2:00:35] revelations contained in the seven seals
[2:00:38] in the seven seals there contains seven
[2:00:41] a man their revelations in the seventh
[2:00:45] seal
[2:00:46] amen but listen as I continue the COPE
[2:00:49] it will be these divinely revealed
[2:00:53] truths
[2:00:57] now Malachi 4 had a commission to
[2:01:01] restore the faith but without it being
[2:01:05] divinely revealed Malachi 4 could not be
[2:01:11] accomplished it would not be able to
[2:01:14] turn the hearts of the children back to
[2:01:16] the father so these these are connected
[2:01:20] and you can separate it revelations 10 7
[2:01:24] Malachi 4 st. Luke's 1730 hallelujah
[2:01:29] because listen the Prophet come amen he
[2:01:33] wasn't be son of man he was a son of man
[2:01:38] revealing these son of man and in the
[2:01:43] days of the revealing of a son of man
[2:01:49] so shall it be Malachi 4 he said kitchen
[2:01:56] separated now amen I am NOT the son of
[2:01:59] man I am a son of man we are revealing
[2:02:05] these son of man and not only that it
[2:02:10] was vindicated he's had to show you that
[2:02:14] the same one that was with Abraham he
[2:02:18] said let me turn my back to the audience
[2:02:22] and he began to discern just like the
[2:02:26] angel who visited Abraham and discerned
[2:02:31] of thoughts of a heart of Sarah Sarah
[2:02:35] you left oh no I didn't oh yes you did
[2:02:39] brother Brandon with his back turned to
[2:02:41] the to the people you have this you back
[2:02:44] there Amen you had this cancer you had
[2:02:46] that problem that was the son of man
[2:02:49] being vindicated through a son of man
[2:03:01] [Applause]
[2:03:10] excuse me just give me a little prayer
[2:03:16] amen praise His name it'll be revealed
[2:03:22] truth
[2:03:27] literally turn the hearts of the
[2:03:32] children to the pentecostal Prabhas
[2:03:34] exactly so hey hallelujah
[2:03:39] now amen as I wind down I don't have
[2:03:42] much time
[2:03:43] amen in every age I just want to say
[2:03:45] this in every age God has had a word a
[2:03:50] time a people to manifest what he
[2:03:57] promised for that day never throughout
[2:04:01] the church ages or any time has God sent
[2:04:05] down anyone without properly equipping
[2:04:08] him the messenger with a message and
[2:04:12] giving him a message
[2:04:14] hallelujah and not only that they were
[2:04:16] elected people a special elected people
[2:04:21] I want to I'm home I'm gonna tell you
[2:04:25] how special you are how special you are
[2:04:29] why do you think that those are millions
[2:04:32] probably thousands and thousands of
[2:04:35] people way back when when brother
[2:04:38] Branham was showing the signs and
[2:04:40] deserting the hearts are the people in
[2:04:42] China
[2:04:43] I did the five the revealing of the Son
[2:04:45] of Man they saw those things but there
[2:04:49] was nothing in them to catch it
[2:04:51] [Applause]
[2:04:55] some of them sets they sat on a platform
[2:04:58] half-asleep
[2:04:59] but me my god was being unfair
[2:05:03] hallelujah
[2:05:04] the son of man being unveiled scripture
[2:05:08] was being fulfilled so they did not
[2:05:12] catch it you know why the message was
[2:05:16] not for them the Prophet put it in c4
[2:05:23] and said this seed has to lay in the
[2:05:28] presence of the Sun for a while to ripen
[2:05:32] because all along the Prophet was sowing
[2:05:35] seeds but he knew right then that
[2:05:38] generation wasn't gonna catch it oh but
[2:05:44] there's got to be a see that's been in
[2:05:49] the ground
[2:05:50] well the channel about 50 years or so
[2:05:53] now Oh somewhere somehow God has got a
[2:06:01] corrupt somewhere
[2:06:04] [Music]
[2:06:06] let's see that was in the ground as
[2:06:09] maturing is coming to perfection
[2:06:13] glory be to God hallelujah roll I'm
[2:06:16] talking about you I'm talking about this
[2:06:20] portion of the bride of Jesus Christ you
[2:06:23] wasn't ready back then of course not but
[2:06:26] you had to mature a Corinthians 13 I
[2:06:32] said when I was a child I spake as a
[2:06:35] child which means if you can just look
[2:06:41] at how the scripture is written when I
[2:06:44] was a child I understood as a child I
[2:06:47] couldn't understand my limited
[2:06:50] understanding I I thought as a child I
[2:06:53] did as a child but when I matured wonder
[2:06:58] green becomes more mature when it comes
[2:07:03] to maturity I changed my walk
[2:07:08] I changed my top those little things I
[2:07:16] don't play with those things no more I
[2:07:19] am a man now that's what God is looking
[2:07:29] for a man a statue of a perfect man amen
[2:07:33] this is what will tie that man in into
[2:07:37] that eternal church age at the end of
[2:07:41] the seals
[2:07:42] [Applause]
[2:07:44] now I'm not preaching doctrine I'm just
[2:07:47] saying what he said
[2:07:47] [Music]
[2:07:50] [Applause]
[2:07:53] just just just food for thought you know
[2:07:56] don't worry be took aha
[2:07:58] hey man so in every age I had a seed a
[2:08:02] time so if God promised amen Malakai for
[2:08:05] a man a Messenger according malachi for
[2:08:08] revelations 10 7 st. luke 1730 these
[2:08:12] scriptures were anointed were assigned
[2:08:17] to a specific person that was supposed
[2:08:23] to come on a scene see you've got to
[2:08:26] know your place in the scripture you
[2:08:28] because then you have scriptural
[2:08:30] vindication and brother Branham
[2:08:34] recognized that see now number one see a
[2:08:38] word see the message came forth
[2:08:44] it wasn't Moses message see because not
[2:08:50] only has a word has to be true but it
[2:08:54] has to be rightly divided so there are
[2:09:01] no more pharaohs in this message no more
[2:09:03] dictators or nothing if you divided that
[2:09:07] you divided it incorrect
[2:09:11] I'm talking about our work our time amen
[2:09:20] to the elect lady
[2:09:22] and what makes you let me just say the
[2:09:28] only thing that makes you different from
[2:09:31] all the rest I want to know what that is
[2:09:37] not you not your life now how you say
[2:09:41] Amen how much you shall go and the only
[2:09:45] difference because you know what if that
[2:09:47] was the case Pentecostal outdoors rather
[2:09:51] because they can make a lot of noise
[2:09:53] they can make a lot of shout and
[2:09:55] everything you know they're out to us
[2:09:57] but the only thing that makes you
[2:10:01] different from the rest because your
[2:10:04] name was written in the Lamb's Book of
[2:10:06] Life before the foundation of the world
[2:10:15] but you could not know this Amen you
[2:10:20] could not know this but when the Prophet
[2:10:24] Malachi for Saint Luke 17 verdict Oh
[2:10:30] revelations 10 7 when he went way back
[2:10:36] and pull back the curtain
[2:10:40] there you saw your name brother and when
[2:10:46] I saw my main message I'm going up I'm
[2:10:52] going up I'm going up in the first
[2:10:56] resurrection hey man I don't care what
[2:11:00] the opposition is I don't care how many
[2:11:03] devils don't believe it amen it has
[2:11:06] nothing to do with me I have a
[2:11:08] revelation that my name is written in
[2:11:12] the Lamb's Book of Life I'm gonna I'm
[2:11:21] gonna say this while I'm closing listen
[2:11:23] and the devil listen he always speaks
[2:11:27] without proof and authority whatever he
[2:11:30] can only assume that's the devil's realm
[2:11:34] and the devil's job is to tell you not
[2:11:37] said this many times before it's to tell
[2:11:40] you you know what your name is not there
[2:11:42] [Music]
[2:11:43] it's not look what you did yesterday
[2:11:48] look what you did 12 months ago or
[2:11:51] whatever 3 years 10 years ago what you
[2:11:54] did he always puts that back in your
[2:11:57] face
[2:12:00] but there's something new in your heart
[2:12:02] a predestinated see that speaks back to
[2:12:09] the devil I said devil show me where I
[2:12:14] actually did that let's go back let's go
[2:12:20] back a little further
[2:12:22] let you know later on the journey back
[2:12:27] he's got the jump off the train
[2:12:30] you know why before Satan was created
[2:12:35] you were way back then before the
[2:12:40] foundation of the world so if he wasn't
[2:12:44] there
[2:12:44] how can you he tell you that your name
[2:12:48] is not in the book before the devil was
[2:12:54] I was what a revelation
[2:13:01] oh and one day Joe got that revelation
[2:13:10] Amen you know trials and tribulations
[2:13:14] are good for you sometimes you know
[2:13:16] because Joe was once on his back he lost
[2:13:20] all that he had he lost his possessions
[2:13:24] he lost everything but one day
[2:13:29] [Applause]
[2:13:31] a whirlwind come down Joe stand up I'm
[2:13:42] gonna talk to you like a man stop being
[2:13:45] a baby
[2:13:46] stop complaining stand up I'm gonna show
[2:13:52] you where you come from
[2:13:56] don't worry way you are now but I'm
[2:14:00] gonna show you where was down when I lay
[2:14:04] the foundation of the work Oh hallelujah
[2:14:08] where was now you were beyond this
[2:14:14] condition you are beyond defeat you are
[2:14:18] with the men of tested sons of God
[2:14:21] shouting and glorifying God and he stood
[2:14:25] up and said I know my Redeemer liveth
[2:14:30] how many can say today
[2:14:32] [Applause]
[2:14:56] [Music]
[2:14:57] Hey
[2:15:06] [Applause]
[2:15:16] to the lamb come on and fries I'm
[2:15:20] somebody come on and think I'm somebody
[2:15:24] [Applause]
[2:15:34] now to prove this to prove this if God
[2:15:40] is looking for the faith that was once
[2:15:43] delivered to the Saints ie men in God
[2:15:47] that's the kind of faith that's gonna go
[2:15:49] with we need rapturing trains now
[2:15:51] because as I said what we have sometimes
[2:15:54] is hardly enough faith for healing or
[2:15:57] whatever but this is what I love really
[2:16:00] see in 1954 God has to provide away he
[2:16:05] says and now and now we're moving right
[2:16:10] on into another great age see he was
[2:16:18] referring now to the bride age because
[2:16:21] remember he come at the end of the
[2:16:25] Laodicean Church age and Laodicea was
[2:16:28] already finished so he called people out
[2:16:32] of Laodicea and according to the
[2:16:35] scriptures I love how it is written
[2:16:38] there God took us out to put us in he
[2:16:42] doesn't just take us out and just leave
[2:16:44] us in the middle of the earth see but
[2:16:47] listen this is the last court I ran at a
[2:16:48] time I listen we're moving and now we're
[2:16:52] moving right into another great age
[2:16:53] coming for the rapture this is our age
[2:16:58] there's no other age after this amen I
[2:17:02] don't care how much you plan on your
[2:17:04] 401ks
[2:17:05] a man your bank account it doesn't
[2:17:08] matter brother I rather have I bet you
[2:17:10] know where I Bank I Bank on the in the
[2:17:12] first blood bank of redemption that's
[2:17:15] where I and you know every time I write
[2:17:21] a check it never returns boy who cares
[2:17:29] the stock markets go down or governments
[2:17:32] are closing whatever you know why
[2:17:34] because here we have no continuing City
[2:17:36] but we seek one to come see a great age
[2:17:43] coming for the rapture of the church and
[2:17:45] now this we're living in the last time
[2:17:48] of the restoration of the gifts see it
[2:17:51] stumbled many of the big fine churches
[2:17:55] it wasn't for them see and it said
[2:17:58] Nazarenes backwards amen it made
[2:18:02] phonetics out of a lot of Pentecostals
[2:18:05] and I'm gonna tell you something it
[2:18:08] happens all the time
[2:18:10] it's always say the message is pure and
[2:18:14] it's always right
[2:18:16] the message is not wrong amen I
[2:18:20] challenge you to take a close
[2:18:22] examination you realize if you are
[2:18:24] sincere and you sit and you study this
[2:18:27] message you realize that you are wrong I
[2:18:29] am price is not divided
[2:18:32] he remains woman one faith one Lord one
[2:18:35] God one baptism one truth hey so
[2:18:39] therefore see but just the same God is
[2:18:43] moving right along bringing in the
[2:18:45] rapturing faith of his church that's
[2:18:48] right so tonight here's brother Branham
[2:18:52] identifying the requirement amen when
[2:18:58] the son of man cometh will he find faith
[2:19:02] so therefore tonight I represent the
[2:19:07] faith the faith that was once delivered
[2:19:12] to the saints God has done his part
[2:19:18] I represent the faith not just Penant
[2:19:23] Pentecostal faith but denominational
[2:19:26] faith he said I represent the faith amen
[2:19:30] so therefore I'm just gonna there just
[2:19:33] 10 minutes that's it 10 minutes on
[2:19:35] Sunday I'm really done 10 10 minutes I
[2:19:37] just want to destruct one thing because
[2:19:39] I realize it's G time bright time if a
[2:19:51] seed is a seed a shuck as a shut-in a
[2:19:54] tears of terror now it's not my
[2:19:57] responsibility to categorize anybody in
[2:20:00] my I have to believe that everybody's a
[2:20:03] brother and I have to treat everyone as
[2:20:06] a brother and a sister you know why
[2:20:09] because that is the nature of the true
[2:20:11] seed but if we realize in Matthew the
[2:20:15] parabola I'll just paraphrase it the
[2:20:18] parable in Matthew how the sower went
[2:20:20] out and he sold good seed in Matthew
[2:20:26] chapter 13 and while he rested there was
[2:20:30] someone the enemy who came in with
[2:20:34] terrors see and in the beginning you
[2:20:39] couldn't tell until they begin to bud
[2:20:43] and realize wait a minute and the
[2:20:47] question was asked by his helpers there
[2:20:50] Wow the I thought we sold good seed I
[2:20:55] thought we saw I thought we sold he
[2:20:58] meant every seed from Genesis to
[2:21:00] revelations according to what brother
[2:21:02] Branham said I thought we did you see
[2:21:04] but meanwhile they realized that amen
[2:21:08] there were tears among the field
[2:21:12] now here I'm gonna close it this we
[2:21:18] don't have an option now the wheat must
[2:21:25] grow very closely intertwined and
[2:21:37] everything else whatever and even
[2:21:39] sometimes squeeze you to a point that
[2:21:42] good see that the the tears will make
[2:21:45] the C's growth very tough sometimes but
[2:21:52] here in closing a week is a week because
[2:22:02] no matter how that close they grew
[2:22:04] together we could never change
[2:22:12] because it was planted with the original
[2:22:16] seat let's see so you hear sometimes
[2:22:21] excuses well you know this brother with
[2:22:24] that brother this and that I did sit
[2:22:26] look listen
[2:22:27] it's not our responsibility to say who
[2:22:30] is who is weak and who is there but if
[2:22:34] you are weak you will never live a life
[2:22:39] of a tear I cannot change you so don't
[2:22:46] tell me because you're so close to this
[2:22:48] and you're being squeezed this way and
[2:22:51] that way that is because though all
[2:22:53] wheat is a weak a shuck is a shot and it
[2:23:00] tears a tear because now we've come down
[2:23:04] to see time bright time and by their
[2:23:09] fruits you shall know them in this last
[2:23:16] days jesus said leave him alone don't
[2:23:20] don't let it because you may destroy the
[2:23:24] weeds you may be more you may do more
[2:23:27] damage to the wheat but let them grow
[2:23:30] together but here remember no matter how
[2:23:35] close you get no matter how hard time
[2:23:39] the tears may give you never act like a
[2:23:44] tear because you are wheat
[2:23:50] because I will love you even though you
[2:23:55] don't love me I love you we have to have
[2:23:59] the love of God and it's not our
[2:24:03] responsibility to separate from them
[2:24:07] because God Himself said in the time of
[2:24:10] harvest I will separate them so the test
[2:24:16] is on you're gonna walk out of here I'm
[2:24:21] gonna taste I hope and pray that when we
[2:24:24] leave this place
[2:24:26] amen we are not in love with everybody
[2:24:29] [Applause]
[2:24:31] we are in love with everybody
[2:24:34] god bless you god bless you my brother
[2:24:37] listen I know useful very hard things
[2:24:40] about me but listen I am a weak god
[2:24:43] bless you my brother
[2:24:47] that's the life
[2:24:53] God will separated don't worry about it
[2:24:56] but we're here for a season
[2:24:58] now who is weeding who is Tara I don't
[2:25:01] know that's not my business that's the
[2:25:02] you know I I'm just trying to live my
[2:25:05] life as much as I can to be a real
[2:25:09] Christian and to bear the right fruit
[2:25:16] because I'm gonna tell you something
[2:25:18] there's a lot of people that say hey I
[2:25:20] am a Christian I am in a message brother
[2:25:22] they are as mean denominations who treat
[2:25:27] you better but I'm gonna tell you
[2:25:34] something that's not the faith that's
[2:25:35] going to make it
[2:25:42] we have the musicians okay you have to
[2:25:45] be magnified magnetized to the headstone
[2:25:50] remember brother gram told the story the
[2:25:52] gods great magnet or the great magnet
[2:25:55] that went around and just lifted up only
[2:25:58] that which was attracted to the magnet
[2:26:00] so you it means that you have to be
[2:26:03] bribed material hey you could have
[2:26:07] driven a nice car you could have sprayed
[2:26:10] it amen and they look like metal and it
[2:26:14] looked like the whole I mean hoping but
[2:26:17] the test comes when it ends up in the
[2:26:20] junkyard and the magnet is turned on and
[2:26:24] you realize that your car is not going
[2:26:26] up nowhere we have to have bride
[2:26:29] material so I will close with this
[2:26:35] amen the faith has been restored I'll
[2:26:42] close with this amen it will be these
[2:26:46] divinely revealed truths
[2:26:50] some people look into seven students
[2:26:53] don't see nothing because it still
[2:26:55] remains to them a mystery but to others
[2:26:59] a revelation amen
[2:27:02] and they hearing that voice amen
[2:27:04] hallelujah prepare for the bridegroom
[2:27:08] hey man the wife has made herself ready
[2:27:10] it's a warning make yourself ready and
[2:27:13] I'm gonna tell you something love
[2:27:15] everybody you know why because when you
[2:27:18] love everybody you can go to sleep at
[2:27:20] night and not have nothing against you
[2:27:22] our rapture material
[2:27:25] glory be to God it doesn't matter if he
[2:27:28] comes at midnight noon or not you are
[2:27:30] rapture material so when the switch is
[2:27:33] turned on honey everything that is bride
[2:27:37] material will be lifted up everything
[2:27:39] else will remain on the pile ahead
[2:27:42] hallelujah so god bless you I love you
[2:27:46] remember one thing stay a week if you
[2:27:50] are a wheat live like it act like it
[2:27:54] forgive your brother forgive your sister
[2:27:57] I don't care how bad they have treated
[2:28:01] you unless you have listened nothing but
[2:28:06] perfect love that bears repeating
[2:28:12] brother Brandon went on the other side
[2:28:14] he so he said I come back and tell you
[2:28:18] please whatever you do don't miss that
[2:28:21] place because nothing but perfect love
[2:28:24] will make it into that place and faith
[2:28:29] is based on forgiveness
[2:28:35] I'll close a man I'll throw faith is
[2:28:39] based on forgiveness so if you tell me
[2:28:42] you have faith and you have old great
[2:28:44] Freight that's wonderful I love that
