[18:14] was healed
[18:16] revelation chapter 7
[18:18] we didn't want to fall and after these
[18:20] things i saw
[18:21] four angels standing on the four corners
[18:23] of the earth
[18:24] holding the four winds of the earth that
[18:26] the wind should not blow on the earth
[18:27] nor on the sea
[18:29] nor on any tree and i saw
[18:31] another angel ascended from the east
[18:33] having the seal of the living god
[18:35] and requiring a lord voice to the four
[18:37] angels to whom it was given to hurt the
[18:39] earth and the sea
[18:40] saiyan
[18:41] hood not the earth neither the sea
[18:44] nor the trees till we have sealed
[18:46] the servants of our god
[18:49] in their foreheads
[18:50] and was
[18:52] for
[18:53] the first part and i heard the number of
[18:55] them
[18:56] which was sealed
[18:59] matthew chapter 25 18 53 matthew chapter
[19:03] 26 rather want to read verse 53 to 56.
[19:11] this is jesus
[19:13] this is judas coming to kiss him
[19:17] to identify who he was
[19:19] to the high priest
[19:21] and so on
[19:22] verse 53 jesus speaking to them
[19:25] think as though i cannot now pray to my
[19:27] father and he shall presently give me
[19:30] more than 12 legion of angels
[19:33] but how then shall the scriptures
[19:36] be
[19:36] fulfilled for thus it must be
[19:40] in that same hour said jesus to the
[19:43] multitudes i come out as against a thief
[19:47] with swords
[19:49] and staffs to take me i sat daily with
[19:53] you teaching in the temple
[19:55] and you laid no hold on me
[19:57] but all this was done
[19:59] that the scriptures of the prophets
[20:02] might be fulfilled
[20:04] then all the disciples forsook him
[20:06] and fled
[20:08] let us pray father we thank you for
[20:09] those scriptures
[20:11] the bread of life that we come to feed
[20:13] on
[20:15] god this word is food for our souls
[20:19] feed us the bread of life
[20:21] for you said man shall not live my bread
[20:22] alone
[20:23] but by every word that proceed out of
[20:25] the mouth of god

[20:31] hear only thus saith the lord
[20:33] we come for bread this morning
[20:36] you said i am the living bread that come
[20:38] down from heaven and if a man eat of
[20:40] this bread he shall not die
[20:42] may we feast on the unfeeling
[20:45] body word of the son of man
[20:47] may we feel so much till our cup run

[21:17] god help us to come out of the ordinary
[21:20] and to break into the supernatural
[21:22] anoint the people with the faith
[21:24] this morning lord it looked like silent
[21:27] it looked like things nothing seemed to
[21:28] be moving
[21:29] but lord the scriptures is being
[21:31] fulfilled
[21:33] have your own way and speak to our
[21:35] hearts and maybe not leave it the same
[21:37] way we came but may you so inspire our
[21:39] hearts and our lives that we will do
[21:42] something about what we have been
[21:43] hearing
[21:44] in jesus name we ask it amen and amen
[21:47] you may be seated praise god and worship
[21:49] the lord
[22:02] oh glory to god
[22:04] oh it's good to be here this morning i
[22:06] feel
[22:07] the anointing of god i feel his spirit
[22:10] here this morning and that's that's the
[22:12] most important thing
[22:14] that's the most important thing if we
[22:15] have two words to speak but the spirit
[22:17] is here to witness those words to your
[22:20] soul
[22:21] that's the most important thing
[22:24] oh hallelujah oh my that song here i
[22:28] might a worship that was really
[22:29] something here am i
[22:31] to bow down to say that i am your god
[22:34] that you are my god oh hallelujah
[22:36] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[22:38] that's what we come to do friends so
[22:40] worship the lord and to receive of his
[22:42] spirit and to soak in and to be blessed
[22:45] amen
[22:48] i have a strange title this morning but
[22:52] the title is that the scriptures might
[22:54] be fulfilled
[22:56] as a title
[22:58] that the scriptures
[23:00] might be fulfilled
[23:02] of a subject
[23:04] every word
[23:06] that proceedeth
[23:08] out of the mouth of god
[23:10] that is what we must live by
[23:12] every word
[23:14] that proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[23:17] and i have an inspiration
[23:18] it's up to us
[23:21] to see that
[23:22] all
[23:23] god's
[23:25] righteousness is fulfilled
[23:28] bear in mind the holy spirit told the
[23:30] prophet when he said pick up a pen and
[23:31] write
[23:33] he said by and through the brain
[23:36] will be
[23:37] fulfilled all
[23:39] that was written
[23:41] by
[23:43] and through
[23:44] the bride amen i say get by and true the
[23:47] bride will be fulfilled all
[23:49] that was promised
[23:52] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[23:54] thank you love of god
[23:59] jesus
[24:01] confronted by people he fellowship with
[24:05] talk with
[24:06] help bless strengthen heal and touch
[24:10] and on that night he had to say come to
[24:13] me like thieves
[24:14] i was there teaching you i was there
[24:17] encouraging you why you come like that
[24:20] he said but this happened that
[24:23] the scriptures
[24:25] might be fulfilled
[24:27] and you have to begin to understand
[24:30] that everything has to do with scripture
[24:34] being
[24:36] fulfilled
[24:38] isn't that right
[24:39] and the inspiration is up to us to see
[24:43] all god's righteousness is fulfilled
[24:46] that come of the scripture matthew 3
[24:48] when then come at jesus from galilee to
[24:50] jordan unto john to be baptized of john
[24:52] and john forbade him and said i have
[24:54] need to be baptized of thee cometh down
[24:56] to me and jesus said suffer that to be
[24:59] so but it becomes us to fulfill
[25:02] all
[25:03] righteousness so even though john could
[25:07] have been baptized by jesus jesus
[25:09] submitted himself
[25:11] that the scriptures
[25:13] might be fulfilled
[25:15] o blessed be the name of the lord so god
[25:18] will judge the world by jesus christ the
[25:20] word
[25:21] isn't that right
[25:22] and he says he will judge the church by
[25:25] their attitude towards christ who is the
[25:27] word
[25:28] you see the challenge today is people
[25:30] making their own gods and they're
[25:31] worshiping that's why god cursed that
[25:34] that you make a god of your own hand you
[25:37] can make a god of your own imagination
[25:39] you could paint your own god and have
[25:41] your own god that you know you have to
[25:43] hear the pastor or hear the scriptures
[25:45] or hear anything you have your own god
[25:47] and you do things according to what you
[25:49] like and what you feel and what you feel
[25:51] and what you feel and what come to you
[25:53] that's what you think
[25:54] but that's not god god is the word
[25:57] and god have a mouth
[25:59] and god does speak and that's why jesus
[26:01] said man shall live by bread alone but
[26:03] by every word that proceeded from where
[26:06] from some theologian no from the mouth
[26:08] of god and the mouth of god is his
[26:11] prophets so once a prophet commanders on
[26:13] the scene and begin to speak that is
[26:16] mouth of god that's why the spirit and
[26:19] the prophet and the bride will be saying
[26:22] the same thing don't ever forget that i
[26:25] want to say it again the spirit and the
[26:27] prophet and the pride will be saying the
[26:30] same thing and what they say will be
[26:33] already said in the word don't you
[26:36] forget that
[26:38] hallelujah hallelujah don't you forget
[26:40] that
[26:41] we are on the word
[26:43] this is going to be a word church
[26:45] nothing added nothing taken away no
[26:47] funny business no funny idea no opinion
[26:50] i'm not here to project myself i'm not
[26:52] here to project the church i'm here to
[26:54] project the word christ jesus
[26:57] we have no man to raise up we have no
[26:58] man to build up we have no man to
[27:00] promote we don't have that inside of him
[27:02] there's only one man we have to worship
[27:04] and that's the lord jesus christ and
[27:06] he's the same yesterday today and
[27:08] forever brother branham said i did not
[27:10] come to make another denomination i came
[27:13] to bring individuals into the statue of
[27:15] a perfect man
[27:17] come and give the lord a shout in the
[27:19] house oh glory to god hallelujah
[27:22] praise the name of the lord
[27:25] oh praise god praise god
[27:28] hallelujah hallelujah
[27:30] blessed be the name of the lord
[27:32] supreme say here in harvest time god
[27:34] word runs in continuity continuity god
[27:38] always does everything he does on the
[27:39] same scale
[27:41] he decides at the beginning when man
[27:42] lost his fellowship with him he would
[27:44] save him by the shed blood of the
[27:46] innocent one and he has never changed
[27:49] this method we try to educate them into
[27:52] it denominate them into it beg them into
[27:55] it beat them into it
[27:57] shout them into it and it still remains
[28:00] the same
[28:01] it's under the shed blood
[28:03] so nobody can beat the people into it
[28:06] shove them into air bet them into it
[28:09] legalize them into earth grace them into
[28:11] it they can't do it it is simply the
[28:14] shed blood that's why there is a poet a
[28:17] murderer this a that and a man after
[28:19] god's own heart because it's the shed
[28:21] blood he come to redeem those names in
[28:24] the book i don't care if they are
[28:25] prostitute drug addicts i homemongers
[28:28] liars i don't care what they are what
[28:31] condition they are he came to redeem

[34:28] mind
[34:35] talk about climbing up the ladder
[34:38] and start very humble
[34:40] but when you come to the last room you
[34:41] head up in the air
[34:43] and you forget from where you come from
[34:47] i see evil
[34:49] that is working man's heart
[34:51] they come very humble at the bottom of
[34:52] the ladder and they climb in slowly but
[34:55] when they really laughs are wrong
[34:56] and they look up
[34:58] they go on
[35:00] because they have arrived
[35:02] that's when jesus got the spirit upon
[35:05] him without without measure he was led
[35:08] by the spirit
[35:10] to go to the grain
[35:11] sit and offer him natural if they'll be
[35:14] there

[35:50] you
[35:51] because you have to give it up all up

[35:55] oh yes i'm getting lighter praise less
[35:58] things troubling me bothering me i'm

[36:19] one day literally pastor calling the
[36:20] person before he's not even answering
[36:22] his phone there's a voicemail voicemail
[36:24] vote pastor
[36:25] are you preaching to stay back here to
[36:27] what them tribulation says
[36:29] you really think i want to be among them
[36:30] tribulation said
[36:32] then bunch of deadbeat people then bunch
[36:34] of blacks and people winning worship god
[36:36] wouldn't praise god wouldn't press their
[36:38] way wouldn't overcome nothing i want to
[36:41] be with them
[36:43] god praise god get out of here
[36:46] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but i
[36:48] want to be among them who overcome him i
[36:51] want when david with me said tell me
[36:52] tell me give me me give me a testimony
[36:56] i won't say him and somebody that's
[36:57] that's it
[36:58] oh glory david let me ask you for your
[37:00] testimony ezekiel will be asking for the
[37:02] testimony
[37:04] [Applause]
[37:20] my god we got playing testimony though
[37:22] boy god much evil devils you overcome
[37:25] and you're bounced back up and you get
[37:27] knocked down on you get pushed and sign
[37:29] on your whatever it is but you keep
[37:31] pressing on
[37:33] hallelujah hallelujah
[37:35] oh praise god let's go a little further
[37:36] now
[37:38] we cannot make one council of churches
[37:40] and everybody meet
[37:41] they'll never work
[37:42] so therefore manage to emphasize this is
[37:44] the bride
[37:45] and we are the bride this is the move of
[37:48] god and if you're not in the movie god
[37:49] you're out of the move
[37:52] you will be out of that move
[37:55] watch it will never work it never did it
[37:58] never will
[37:59] that is the way why i am against that
[38:02] system
[38:04] god has got a system you heard it said
[38:07] today all the jesus comes together is
[38:08] going to be working on the churches and
[38:10] jesus prayed for that that we might be
[38:11] one
[38:12] no that's kind of minded without knowing
[38:14] the spirit
[38:15] jesus said that there might be one
[38:18] father as
[38:19] you and i are one
[38:21] not for some man to be over something it
[38:24] will never work
[38:26] we have seen that we are 40 years of
[38:29] example of producing man over
[38:33] and you know what it has not worked
[38:36] hallelujah
[38:38] one denomination wants to take over the
[38:40] other
[38:41] one man over the other one
[38:44] then you might be one with god like
[38:46] christ and god was one that's what his
[38:48] prayer is
[38:50] and he was the word and jesus prayed
[38:53] that we might be the word reflecting him
[38:56] that's when his prayer would be answered
[38:58] he wants us to be one with god and god
[39:01] is the word each individual in his heart
[39:03] must be one with god
[39:06] now
[39:07] he says let's go back to the beginning
[39:09] and when they stayed with this word and
[39:11] lived by this word when they broke it
[39:14] just one link of the chain of promises
[39:16] that struck them that was promised also
[39:20] the day you eat thereof that day you die
[39:23] you live by the word you live you break
[39:26] it
[39:26] you die death was a promise the day you
[39:29] eat that day you died
[39:31] so not just life was a promise that was
[39:33] a promise also
[39:34] it's not right it's not right so if god
[39:37] could see the suffering that children go
[39:39] through little nice innocent babies and
[39:41] people in the health and whatnot you
[39:42] think he couldn't say oh gosh my heart
[39:44] feels sorry oh god all right okay go
[39:46] ahead no
[39:47] his righteousness demanded he keep his
[39:50] word
[39:53] so they had to die
[39:55] who talking about his son
[39:58] let us make man in our image and like
[39:59] this that son had to die because of his
[40:02] word
[40:04] oh hallelujah
[40:06] so don't put no bishop over it let the
[40:08] holy ghost take over it the holy ghost
[40:10] was sent to keep the weeds and things
[40:12] out not what the bishop thinks or the
[40:14] overseers it take the holy spirit to
[40:17] keep that church in its condition adam
[40:20] had a choice
[40:21] at the word and live disbelieve the word
[40:23] and die he have given the same choice we
[40:26] have to be so god give us the same
[40:29] choice isn't that right
[40:30] and if god okay o praise the name of the
[40:33] lord it's not something
[40:34] you have a choice
[40:37] to live with that word to stay with that
[40:38] word i want to encourage you stay
[40:41] with
[40:42] the world
[40:45] listen if i try to shoot every false
[40:47] doctrine forced to afford an idea it's
[40:49] going to be will be popular
[40:54] we can't afford to do that we waste time
[40:56] just shooting
[40:58] all stills will be just bullets
[41:00] and your soul will not be fed
[41:02] so my job is to give you the right
[41:04] dollar
[41:05] [Applause]
[41:13] because they have endless machine
[41:14] sprinting unless people do know kind of
[41:16] thing like that but they train with the
[41:18] right money and we repent too
[41:23] so afterwards you just keep passing
[41:24] sweep their funny color convincing her
[41:26] these people are right
[41:27] that's something to check that what kind
[41:28] of things and as long as man is man he
[41:31] will find some kind of trick to do
[41:32] something
[41:33] so that i have some other body to
[41:34] outsmart that
[41:36] so they have to train them with the
[41:37] writing so we are here to train you with
[41:38] the right thing
[41:40] [Applause]
[41:42] i really don't want to comment
[41:44] i'm gonna gun
[41:52] itching for things that have that to do
[41:55] the hardest thing what i said there to
[41:57] content for the faith hold on
[41:59] until they have this thing coming every
[42:01] sunday i'm preaching the same thing we
[42:03] flip it we boil it we bake it we fry it
[42:05] whatever it is put some ketchup in it
[42:06] put some things on it but it's the same
[42:08] gospel
[42:09] it's the same word we have to wait
[42:11] [Applause]
[42:11] [Music]
[42:13] till dynamics strike
[42:15] okay the lord i shout
[42:17] hallelujah so you can't be bored and
[42:20] tired i'm not bored and tired

[44:36] ceiling for a show i'm standing on this
[44:38] platform
[44:39] oh hallelujah praise god so the church
[44:43] of the living god has been born in the
[44:45] mother fanaticism and chaos she's won
[44:47] away to grind until she's top of the
[44:50] thing just waiting for wings for the
[44:52] flight many shall run to and fro and the
[44:54] people that know that god shall do
[44:56] export in that day god's revelation to
[44:58] the church
[44:59] little flock positionally stay where you
[45:00] are
[45:01] don't worry god is waiting and trying
[45:03] and pressing to get the mystery of god
[45:06] revealed to his church
[45:08] and that is what is holding back the
[45:10] coming of the lord and the great
[45:12] millennium is the great
[45:14] supernatural power that really lays
[45:17] dormant in the church you hear what the
[45:19] prophet said that's falling back the
[45:20] millennium and the coming of the lord
[45:22] the great supernatural power that is
[45:24] laying dormant in the church
[45:27] oh harley the great supernatural power
[45:30] that is laying dormant in the church but
[45:33] everything is for time that the
[45:35] scriptures might be fulfilled
[45:38] well matthew 2 23 and he came deeper
[45:40] jesus he came and dwelt in a city called
[45:43] nazareth that it might be fulfilled
[45:45] which was spoken by the prophets he
[45:47] shall be called a nazarene
[45:50] oh hallelujah praise god for him to be
[45:52] called a nazarene he has to go into
[45:54] nazareth that the scripture might be
[45:56] fulfilled i wonder what scripture we in
[45:58] right now i wonder what vein we in right
[46:00] now i want this revelation tittiness in
[46:02] effect
[46:06] and brother branham said america is
[46:08] revelation to dean
[46:09] started out as a lamb but then stick
[46:12] like a dragon
[46:14] that's a sharp contrast
[46:17] from a lamb to a dragon that's a huge
[46:19] difference
[46:20] what would make a lamb comforter dragon
[46:25] i feel to see into the dragon oh holla
[46:28] the dragon has begun to speak
[46:30] oh hallelujah praise god praise the name
[46:34] of the lord and i believe and i'm seeing
[46:37] it that once the words start to come out
[46:39] the mouth
[46:41] things change right on me
[46:43] oh hallelujah
[46:45] so one of the politicians in america
[46:47] says you should take out the families of
[46:50] the terrorists
[46:51] take them out
[46:53] saw a clip on the internet a woman being
[46:55] interviewed what you think about that
[46:57] about killing babies and killing
[46:59] children of terrorists she said yes
[47:01] because they were grouped with big
[47:02] terrorists
[47:05] and that woman in america is saying that
[47:08] normal as could i get a a jar of ice
[47:11] cream
[47:12] she's saying that as normal
[47:14] and all you could always wow
[47:18] is that normal
[47:20] the conversation has now changed the
[47:23] narrative have no change
[47:25] yes we need to do something
[47:28] stop this
[47:29] cut that off
[47:31] but you know what that is about it's not
[47:33] about that
[47:34] it's about the brain
[47:39] oh
[47:40] hallelujah
[47:42] some of you barely want to say amen
[47:44] it's still about the bride
[47:45] whether you say amen or don't it's still
[47:47] about the brand
[47:48] it's not about protecting america it's
[47:50] about the war that started in genesis
[47:53] and about the climax in revelation
[47:55] it's about isaac and ishmael
[47:58] hallelujah praise god is why god alone
[48:00] abraham to go with sarah hallelujah
[48:06] and what's the purpose of that seed
[48:09] come to the end time what will it
[48:10] produce because every event now going
[48:13] forward is for scriptures to be
[48:15] fulfilled
[48:17] we have to come into opposition and i
[48:19] feel this morning we are doing just that
[48:22] oh glory to god hallelujah praise god
[48:26] are you with me
[48:27] this has to be by the word
[48:30] it has to be that this could have been
[48:31] fulfilled
[48:32] oh blessed be the lord
[48:35] matthew 4
[48:38] and when jesus had heard that john was
[48:39] cast into prison
[48:41] he departed into galilee
[48:43] and leaving nazareth he came and dwelled
[48:45] in capernaum
[48:47] which is upon the sea coast
[48:49] in the borders of zabalon and nephilim
[48:51] that it might be fulfilled which was
[48:54] spoken of isa
[48:55] saying the land of zabalan the land of
[48:58] naphthalene by the way of the sea beyond
[49:00] jordan
[49:01] galilee of the gentiles the people that
[49:03] sat in there saw a great light
[49:05] and to them that sat in the region and
[49:06] shadow of that light is sprung up
[49:08] jesus leave from one place and go to the
[49:10] next place why that the scriptures might
[49:12] fulfill every scripture have to be
[49:14] fulfilled because the word is god and

[58:31] sin caused them that charge over the
[58:33] city to draw near
[58:35] every man with us just joined up in his
[58:37] hand
[58:38] and behold six men came from the way of
[58:39] the higher gate which lied towards the
[58:41] north and every man
[58:43] a slaughter weapon in his hand
[58:45] and one man among them was cloned with
[58:47] linen
[58:48] with a writer's ink one by his side
[58:50] and they went in and stood beside the
[58:52] prison altar
[58:53] and the glory of the god of israel had
[58:55] gone up from the cherub whereupon he was
[58:57] to the threshold of the house
[58:59] he called to the man clone with lynn
[59:01] which are the righteous ink on by his
[59:02] side
[59:03] and the lord said unto him
[59:06] go through the midst of the city
[59:09] through the midst of jerusalem
[59:11] and set a mark upon the foreheads of the
[59:13] men that sigh and cry
[59:16] for all the abominations that be done in
[59:18] the midst thereof
[59:19] unto the others he said in my hearing go
[59:21] ye after him through the city
[59:23] smite
[59:24] let not your eyes spear
[59:26] neither have he pity slay utterly old
[59:30] and young
[59:31] both maids little children and women but
[59:33] come not near any man upon whom is the
[59:36] mark
[59:37] and begin at my sanctuary
[59:40] then they begin at the ancient men
[59:42] which were before the house
[59:44] oh hallelujah is this real
[59:48] is this god that we're talking about
[59:50] receiving
[59:51] looking to put a mark
[59:53] where does i am in the message come with
[59:55] this
[59:57] where does i believe brother branham
[1:00:03] to sit down and think because they're in
[1:00:05] church and they believe a message of the
[1:00:06] hour that they are bright that
[1:00:08] everything is fine you understand what
[1:00:10] god did to jerusalem
[1:00:14] he said i bless them
[1:00:16] i do this fear i do fear but if you
[1:00:18] don't hear i will do i will increase
[1:00:20] your sins i will make a heaven like
[1:00:22] brass i will do this i will just he told
[1:00:24] him all of that
[1:00:32] this is a prayer
[1:00:34] from testimony brother branham
[1:00:36] he's praying god give us one more great
[1:00:38] revival
[1:00:39] before judgment comes granted lord we
[1:00:42] realize we are certainly wasting the
[1:00:43] balance tonight
[1:00:45] either a bum up
[1:00:47] either a blow up of a bomb
[1:00:49] or one of the greatest panics that ever
[1:00:51] struck the country have mercy
[1:00:53] bless us tonight
[1:00:55] he's talking about the vision at gotcha
[1:00:57] and how he's praying he's a either
[1:00:59] a blow up of a bomb or one of the
[1:01:02] greatest panics that ever struck the
[1:01:05] country
[1:01:06] many that stand around congregation for
[1:01:08] god
[1:01:08] made a wonder touristy go away film many
[1:01:11] critics be ashamed but it seems to be
[1:01:13] blessed i mean the sick be healed
[1:01:16] listen america this is both
[1:01:19] i say this not to individuals but to
[1:01:22] america in full
[1:01:24] your all of judgment is near hand
[1:01:27] you are just assured this nation will be
[1:01:29] judged by god if it isn't so i'm a false
[1:01:32] prophet and a liar at the pulpit
[1:01:34] just watch for it it's coming mark it in
[1:01:37] your books and say brother branham said
[1:01:39] so
[1:01:40] in the name of the lord and you're going
[1:01:42] to see that it's going to be just that
[1:01:44] way because god's bible said so
[1:01:47] the other day i made a statement to you
[1:01:49] i said if god doesn't judge this nation
[1:01:51] for its sin he is obligated to raise up
[1:01:53] son and more and apologize for sinking
[1:01:55] them
[1:01:56] certainly god is obligated he is just
[1:01:58] and honest he is true his judgments are
[1:02:01] true and god has no respect of prison we
[1:02:03] have weighed in the balance and found
[1:02:05] wanting ways in the balance the
[1:02:07] handwriting
[1:02:08] is on the wall we are the end times our
[1:02:10] eyes are blind to it
[1:02:12] so it is today the very god that america
[1:02:14] claims to serve will bring judgment upon
[1:02:16] the nation and destroy it
[1:02:19] i hope that gets so deep you'll never
[1:02:21] wiggle out of it
[1:02:23] the very one that you claim that you
[1:02:25] love
[1:02:26] and with your own man-made dogmas and
[1:02:28] immoral life and decay that you got in
[1:02:31] you away from the word of god will
[1:02:32] destroy you someday that's thus saith
[1:02:35] the lord
[1:02:36] that is what
[1:02:38] god see of the lord nothing else left
[1:02:40] for them
[1:02:41] oh my
[1:02:43] he said now
[1:02:45] the word of the bitter lamb that rose up
[1:02:46] in revelation 13 a lamb
[1:02:48] civil and the classical power
[1:02:51] but after islam freedom of religion and
[1:02:53] so forth but after a while you speak
[1:02:55] like a beast
[1:02:58] like the dragon
[1:02:59] and exercise all the power of the dragon
[1:03:02] did before him
[1:03:04] and a bitter persecution
[1:03:07] we are nearing
[1:03:09] that time
[1:03:11] amen now i want you to look at what
[1:03:12] bahrain put together
[1:03:14] he is describing america amen
[1:03:17] he was describing lamb to the dragon and
[1:03:21] listen to what he says you remember
[1:03:22] church
[1:03:24] you are living in the best day you ever
[1:03:26] will live in right now
[1:03:28] until jesus comes it will get rapidly
[1:03:31] worse and worse
[1:03:32] when russia goes down there to get that
[1:03:34] oil look out that's all she needs that's
[1:03:37] what the prophet said it would do we are
[1:03:39] ready for it then amen look at russia
[1:03:41] position today
[1:03:42] look at russia movements today they
[1:03:45] already position them themselves because
[1:03:47] the prophet saw russia making a move he
[1:03:49] said we are ready for it then and the
[1:03:51] same breath he's talking about america
[1:03:54] oh bean lamb
[1:03:55] dragon
[1:03:57] oh hallelujah
[1:03:58] someone asked me today brother branham
[1:04:01] speaking on the back of the beat don't
[1:04:02] you believe there's a tattoo or number
[1:04:03] on your head a tattoo on your hand no
[1:04:05] sir don't never look for that it will be
[1:04:08] a boycott no man could buy or sell
[1:04:10] unless it belongs to the confederation
[1:04:12] of churches
[1:04:13] there will come a union a unionizing of
[1:04:15] the thing
[1:04:16] bringing it to unionize religion mark my
[1:04:18] word it in the far off you'll see it is
[1:04:21] just around the corner
[1:04:22] and the bible speaks that united states
[1:04:25] watch come up like a lamb freedom of
[1:04:28] religion and he's break like a dragon
[1:04:30] and exercise the same power that dragon
[1:04:33] had before that's the usa our minister
[1:04:36] said to me long ago a friend of mine but
[1:04:37] the brand of gold will never let the
[1:04:39] united states fall because of the basis
[1:04:41] of our forefathers and former religion i
[1:04:43] said he let the jews show carried away
[1:04:45] they had a lot better standing than we
[1:04:47] had that's right god no respect of some
[1:04:50] generation that passed you either walk
[1:04:52] the line or you are out of the kingdom
[1:04:55] that's pretty rough but that's good for
[1:04:56] you
[1:04:57] that's the scripture
[1:04:59] oh praise the name of the lord are you
[1:05:01] with me
[1:05:03] what is a seal i see it cannot be put on
[1:05:05] anything unless it's complete the
[1:05:06] lutherans wasn't sealed the day of
[1:05:08] dispensation of grace wasn't completed
[1:05:10] they preached justification they were
[1:05:12] not sealed because it wasn't completed
[1:05:14] but the baptism of the holy ghost is the
[1:05:16] completion of the works
[1:05:18] of god
[1:05:19] oh hallelujah isn't that right
[1:05:23] praise the name of the lord so watch he
[1:05:26] said now watch what is america america
[1:05:29] was established at plymouth rock for one

[1:05:39] nourished for time and a time and
[1:05:40] divided up time about 165 70 years she
[1:05:44] was prepared
[1:05:46] then this nation raised up and formed
[1:05:47] images to the beast and spoke like the
[1:05:50] beast did to the confederation of
[1:05:52] organized church religion
[1:05:53] the church is getting so she can't have
[1:05:56] a freedom no more

[1:15:05] own land
[1:15:07] they defile it by their own way
[1:15:09] by their doings their ways was before me
[1:15:12] as the uncleanness of a removed woman
[1:15:15] wherefore i poured my fury upon them for
[1:15:18] the blood that they had shed upon the
[1:15:19] land and for their idols wherever they
[1:15:21] had polluted it
[1:15:23] and i scattered them among the hidden
[1:15:25] and they were dispersed throughout the

[1:15:29] according to their doings i judge them
[1:15:31] and when they entered into the heathen
[1:15:33] whether they have went they profaned my
[1:15:35] holy name
[1:15:36] when they said to them these are the
[1:15:38] people of the lord and have gone forth
[1:15:40] out of this land

[1:24:55] there's a there's a cup of judgment
[1:24:57] there's a couple iniquities that have to
[1:24:58] be full one is full then he acts
[1:25:00] then he responds
[1:25:02] the iniquity wasn't full yet the
[1:25:04] amorites would have to linger and wait
[1:25:06] before the exodus and when the amorites
[1:25:09] got iniquity filled
[1:25:12] to lead the people to a natural land and
[1:25:15] the iniquity of the american
[1:25:16] denomination has called themselves the
[1:25:18] church so long till the iniquities that
[1:25:20] were fulfilled
[1:25:21] there's coming an exodus there we go
[1:25:23] where god will show who is who where the
[1:25:26] church oh here we go
[1:25:28] the church itself the bride of jesus
[1:25:30] christ will be exited us out
[1:25:33] into the land that's promised
[1:25:35] oh hallelujah praise god
[1:25:39] watch now
[1:25:40] we have to go down further
[1:25:43] watch joseph
[1:25:44] there is a pharaoh who didn't know who
[1:25:46] joseph was that's right
[1:25:48] what was joseph representing the
[1:25:50] spiritual part of the spirit of exodus
[1:25:53] now look who iran types it
[1:25:55] he's talking about a pharaoh that nuna
[1:25:57] joseph listen to what he says here now
[1:25:59] there raises up now we are freedom
[1:26:02] the woman nourished for time and
[1:26:04] dividing the time talk about america
[1:26:07] but finally
[1:26:08] a fair dictator who knew not freedom of
[1:26:11] religion
[1:26:16] he typed in that as a pharaoh that knew
[1:26:18] not jesus
[1:26:20] he said we'll let it pass there will
[1:26:22] come a time
[1:26:23] where there was a fear of force had to
[1:26:25] come
[1:26:26] and there was a fear who raised up who
[1:26:28] did not know joseph
[1:26:30] oh my hallelujah and ramses was born
[1:26:34] after
[1:26:36] and ramses was the one who knew not the
[1:26:38] blessings of joseph he didn't know the
[1:26:41] spiritual side was he was only a
[1:26:42] political genius
[1:26:44] that he could take ethiopia and the rest
[1:26:45] of the countries with military might and
[1:26:48] i think if any man spiritual could see
[1:26:50] what's taking place now we are getting a
[1:26:52] pharaoh who knows not freedom of
[1:26:54] religion when our president took office
[1:26:56] he would not swear that he believed in
[1:26:58] freedom of religion this is about
[1:27:00] abandoned time but there's coming a
[1:27:02] persecution a persecution coming upon
[1:27:05] all those who won't unite with it and a
[1:27:08] boycott it'll be too late then you
[1:27:10] already took the mark you better do it
[1:27:12] now ramses was growing but remember
[1:27:15] while ramses is going into power in
[1:27:17] egypt god had moses in the wilderness
[1:27:19] he was growing too
[1:27:21] so while that power is growing there's a
[1:27:23] bride that is growing also
[1:27:26] hallelujah no longer infant bride but a
[1:27:28] mature bride
[1:27:30] a bride ready for that press to come
[1:27:33] down
[1:27:33] oh hallelujah praise the name of the
[1:27:36] lord god had a spiritual
[1:27:38] assistant
[1:27:39] do you ever say no the boat growing
[1:27:41] again it will be a showdown one of these
[1:27:43] days the time ain't far my lord
[1:27:46] hallelujah
[1:27:47] praise god had moses his prophet the
[1:27:50] enemies will propose a system and
[1:27:53] unbelief will accept it because the
[1:27:55] enemy is the intellectual sign and right
[1:27:57] in this message you have intellect and
[1:27:59] spiritual yes
[1:28:01] oh hallelujah isn't that right now
[1:28:04] remember there's only two don't forget
[1:28:06] this there are only two powers one is
[1:28:08] spiritual power of the holy spirit the
[1:28:11] other one is the devil working through
[1:28:13] intellectual power
[1:28:14] oh hallelujah bottom and quote both call
[1:28:16] in scripture but one is the holy spirit
[1:28:19] spiritual power the other is
[1:28:21] intellectual oh praise god you've seen
[1:28:23] it this morning
[1:28:25] hallelujah so there's intellectual power
[1:28:27] working in ramses to bring him into
[1:28:29] power who knows not the freedom to let
[1:28:31] joseph what joseph had done oh praise
[1:28:34] the name of the lord and we see the same
[1:28:36] thing
[1:28:37] okay hallelujah
[1:28:52] and we see the same thing an electoral
[1:28:54] power weaving among the churches is
[1:28:56] raised up to the ecclesical head that
[1:28:58] don't care what the bible said they got
[1:29:00] their own system it's not what the bible
[1:29:02] said it's what the church said and the
[1:29:04] protestants breathe right into that till
[1:29:06] all little groups well sure i know but i
[1:29:09] tell you them this is gone former
[1:29:11] godless denying the power thereof the
[1:29:13] intellectual part looks perfect
[1:29:16] it's perfect it's exactly but perfect
[1:29:18] the inspiration of satan
[1:29:30] an iron never ceased from the knees down
[1:29:32] to the end
[1:29:33] and praise god is room the deadly woman
[1:29:36] was
[1:29:37] deadly won't kill him in his head and he
[1:29:39] revived from pagan room to purple rome
[1:29:42] and they make an image unto the beast
[1:29:44] revelation chapter 13 and here we are
[1:29:46] today forming a system a system we can't
[1:29:48] wait we try everybody to become a
[1:29:51] lutheran and couldn't do it trying them
[1:29:52] to make all them baptists we couldn't do
[1:29:54] it all because methodists couldn't do it
[1:29:56] so in order to do this they have to form
[1:29:58] a consul a head an image to the beast
[1:30:02] that's exactly what they have done the
[1:30:04] crucifixion of the word again is at hand
[1:30:06] oh praise the name of the lord could you
[1:30:09] take a little more
[1:30:11] when hitler and then persecuted the jews
[1:30:13] and did the things they done under there
[1:30:15] under stalin hitler all those dictators
[1:30:17] we had the time to rehearse it to
[1:30:18] newcomers he said under the age was a
[1:30:21] bitter persecution against the jews it's
[1:30:23] been a bitter persecution against israel
[1:30:25] because it's been a time of calling them
[1:30:27] back to the atonement isn't that right
