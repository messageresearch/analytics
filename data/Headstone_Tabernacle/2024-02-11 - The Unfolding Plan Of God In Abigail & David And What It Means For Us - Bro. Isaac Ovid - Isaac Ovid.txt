appreciate our song service brother the gon may God Rich bless you and also for the service on Wednesday night may God continue to use you mightily for his kingdom thank you musicians what an atmosphere in the house of the Lord this morning amen before you get ready to take your seats let's go straight to the scripture just want to read one portion of scripture this morning we have quite a bit we're going to spend some time in today but just want to open as a foundation reading first Samuel 25 and reading verse one 1st Samuel 25 and verse one and Samuel died Samuel died and all the Israelites were gathered together and lamented him and buried him in his house at Rama and David arose and went down to the Wilderness of Paran may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated certainly a great privilege to be in the house of the Lord this morning and to be able to sing his praises and for God to speak to us through song Through the ministry of music and through the ministry of his word and how blessed we are to be called out in such a time as this we see the world this morning I had to go go to the Baba and I saw three men walk in the street with a look in their eyes and the Baba had just pulled up and he didn't come out his car he say I waited for them guys to pass before I come out on my car say yeah those those guys have a spirit upon them came that's demon possession right there walking a certain way they the spirit they have no idea what Spirit they're dealing with but this Spirit of Carnival and banal and all these things it's demonic forces that take over people where they lose control and it's evil spirits that we're dealing with in in this time so don't be naive that what might seem innocent what might seem simple is really spiritual forces at work that you cannot see with a naked eyes so we want to be vigilant we want to be mindful we want to be sensitive to what's happening in this season to know that de the devil is mad he is he's angry because he knows his time is short he is not a fool he knows his time is short he he sees a change taking place in you he doesn't yet understand who you are or what you will become but he knows there's a change there something that's different he felt it when Jesus was on the earth and he's feeling it again it's a reminder to him of when that great prophet priest and king walk the earth there's a different people in the land who under their messenger are about to become the final voice to the final age he knows his time is up he knows that there's a plan because every time the devil thought he could stop it God found a way to make it anybody with me this morning every time the devil thought he could stop something God always had a way it's been God's way to always find a way God always has a provided way we are here this morning because of God's provided way can the church amen and for this we give God praise we give God praise when we feel good we pray God praise when we don't feel good we give God praise when we feel happy and we're supposed to give God praise when we feel sad the Bible says in all things in everything give him thanks Hallelujah so I don't care what's going on right now in everything you could find a reason to give God thanks in the good times praise His name in The Bad Times do the same in everything give the king of King all all of the thanks thank him in your pain thank him in your struggle thank him when you're upset thank him when you don't understand thank him when you don't feel like thanking him you thank him anyhow thank him when you have money in your bank thank him when you don't have money in the bank thank him when there's food on your table and when there's no food you thank him anyhow because there's no condition there's no exception there's no rule that allows you to do anything else because we thank God because he is God and without him and beside him there's not else but without him we are nothing this morning can the Church of the Living God say Amen falling in sin doesn't change the need to thank him making a mistake doesn't change a need to thank him oh you don't hear me this morning hallelujah hallelujah there's a difference between praise and worship worship him because he is God he'll deal with your problem he'll deal with you falling he'll deal with your transgression he'll deal with your iniquity but let us not remove who he is he is God uh he is I am that I am he is the way he's the truth he's the life he's the door he is my rock he is my shield he is my buckler he is my Fortress he is my deliverer and in him do I put my trust I can't trust in men I can't trust in chariots I can't trust in anything else but him this morning can the church say amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I know you didn't come to church to sleep this morning I know you didn't come to church to take it easy this morning because for the next 2 three days those people in the world they not taking it easy the next 2 three days they're about to go into their greatest this is their convention you know this Carnival Monday Tuesday is their convention you know they wait a whole year

next Sunday so come under great expectation I know you will be blessed can we give the Lord a hand of Praise so I have a title this morning the unfolding plan of God in Abel in in in Abigail and David and what it means for us the unfolding plan of God in Abigail and David and what it means for us and I really want to have a conversation this morning because in what we are about a going through there's a lot it speaks to marriage it speaks to relationship it speaks to dealing with struggles it speaks to dealing with depression and frustration and breaking points you know everybody has a Breaking Point right the best of us us have a Breaking Point hallu take the simplest person and put them under a lot of pressure after a while yes that person will reach their breaking point and if you don't know how to deal with reaching your Breaking Point you're going to get into problems so we're going to talk a little bit about it today but to lay a background and a context and a foundation for what we're going to get into I'm going to start with that scripture we read in 1st Samuel 25 and Samuel died a great man died a powerful man died a man who was a prophet he was a judge he functioned as a priest he died and the Bible tells us and all the Israelites were gathered together and lamented him nation is in mourning Nation stops because the great spiritual leader has gone on Samuel's death marks the end of an era because we know Abraham ISAC Jacob who turned to Israel the children of Israel sent into Egypt coming out Moses years later brings them out and then Joshua takes them into the promised land and between Joshua and Samuel are all the judges from annel who is Caleb's younger brother to Ehud Deborah Gideon jeffa and Samson and we know that Samuel represented the result of Prayer of a Barron woman it was not a normal birth it was a woman who was in travail of Soul because she was under pressure in her home and she took her pressure to the altar we need more women like that who would take their pressure to the altar we did a study on that sometime ago and in bitterness of Soul the high priest Eli thought she was drunk because she was crying so much and mumbling so much that he said why you drinking he say I'm not drinking I'm in travail of Soul bring us back believers who are in travail of soul where they sigh and they cry because they have a need and instead of running to this person or that person they run to the Altar for God to deal with the situation and God met her because she made a she made a covenant with the Lord and Lord if you give me this son I'm going to give this son back to you Hallelujah and God heard her prayer God honored her prayer God granted her prayer to that woman named Hannah God gave her a son whose name was Samuel and the Bible say God gave Samuel Grace he gave Samuel favor with God and with men and Samuel grew up we know the story under the training of Eli a high priest who didn't manage his home the criticism of Eli was his son were running havoc and God say why you didn't address your boys why you allow them to do what they want and God killed his sons and the heartache and the pain of the story when when when Eli heard that the Ark of the Covenant was taken away he died in his seat all of this Samuel would have witnessed as a boy Samuel would have heard the voice Samuel Samuel he didn't even know what to do with it because the Bible said he didn't even know God and the high priest Eli said L when you hear that just say Lord here I am all his training Samuel went under until God start to deal with Samuel as a judge he is over the people God is showing Samuel things and revealing himself to Samuel and using Samuel between God's thoughts and his people until Samuel comes to a crossroad as it would were and the people say we want a king like the rest of the world and it grieved Samuel when he heard this and God said don't worry about it they have not rejected you they have rejected me and God showed Samuel a young man named Saul and he anointed that man Saul to be king all of this Samuel would have seen as the the the the the the the chapter of the judges was coming to a Clos anybody with me this morning I'm painting a background so you can see the unfolding of this thing and S and Saul sat it off good you know Saul sat off real good there was until Saul began to do his own thing an incident after incident Sam say listen God not with you anymore you know and as you read it you almost feel sorry for Saul because there are these moments through his life you see these glimpses of repentance and he want to be right but the Bible says that God allowed an evil spirit to go to Saul so upset God was but the way Saul disregarded the laws of God and the Commandments of God and God tell Samuel Samuel how long will you mourn for Saul a finish with Saul I want nothing to do with him anymore God had reached his breaking point it is not uncommon for God God reaches breaking point in the days of Noah you know butam could talk about it as God one day he looked down and see young people at the line trying to get salvation and no salvation for them they done CR the line Breaking Point seeking the Lord while he might be found call upon him while he is near there's a limit to what God will do there's a limit to his Mercy there's a limit to his grace there's a limit to how long going to say come fix your life get an order change your walk change your to he will do it and then God says I'm done I can't take it no more I wanted to preach but over read scripture some weeks ago and it it's it it affected me here in Jeremiah speak for the Lord and asking the question what iniquity have your fathers found in me you know what have I done to your fathers that that all you're going and do all this nonsense tell me I'll fix it imagine almighty God trying to negotiate with man and say if it's me is the problem let let me know you know so much God trying to bridge the gap between his children and himself he say if if I'm the problem he say what iniquity have you found in me that lead you to all these false gods and all these false clothes and all this worldly music and all your life you're living what have I done to you that drive you to this thing God reached his Breaking Point anybody with me this morning I just want to talk to you a little bit from this thing because God is unfolding something and Samuel is griev in his heart God said to Samuel Samuel stop it how long you'll mourn for him he dead already he's walking but he's dead Samuel is mourning so like a dead man you know Saul's still on his throne but Samuel know he's dead oh God death begins in the sanctuary death begins in the church people still come to church but and Samuel it it it resonance will say you can't mourn him anymore this is not Samuel praying for Saul now he was mourning him because he know there was no coming back oh anybody with me the house this morning and God send Samuel he said go to the house of Jesse and there you will find a man after my own heart you will find a new king you will find the one I'm going to use because I have a plan I have a way to Redemption there's a plan that's unfolding so bad behavior can stop the plan the enemy can't stop the plan unbelief can't stop the plan depression can't stop the plan mistakes not going to stop the plan my plan is too important no man will stop my plan I'll get somebody [Applause] else so Samuel goes down to the house of Jesse and you know the story Eliah comes the first born and each one comes and and and and and and the reality is Samuel couldn't tell tell who to choose in his mind eye he thought elab the firstborn was going to be the one and God allow him to go through that process to teach his Prophet to teach his the last judge I'm not letting you choose it's not your kind of choice not man's choice I am looking at the heart until all seven passed through and and Samuel had to be confused and say but wait night it had to be somebody else he said well there's one more he T sheep he say send for him amen and the Bible says Samuel pour the whole Horn of the altar the whole Horn of the altar on David listen David didn't ask to be chosen David didn't volunteer for the role David didn't know even what he was coming to when they called David come up to the house now David get a WhatsApp maybe say come up come up to the house David come up to the house not knowing what they're calling for maybe it was a food maybe it was what and and and David walked straight into the Horn of the altar straight into anointing oil and some of you come to church this morning you didn't even know what you're coming to and you walk straight into oil and from that day the Bible said David was anointed and the spirit of God was with David and from that very minute and evil spirit went to Sol can the church say Amen you may be SE it a little bit I'm trying to teach and to talk to you a little bit we the moment the anointing Came Upon David and an evil spirit went to saw the same instant David picked up an anointing and he picked up an enemy he picked up his Destiny and purpose and he picked up someone who wanted to kill him David didn't choose this walk he didn't ask for the walk God chose the walk God gave him the walk no wonder David could speak he would lay a table for me in the presence of my enemies because David understood after a while that the plan of God had to unfold a certain [Applause] way and unlike Saul who was made king without process David was being brought into kingship by a process he had to earn the right to sit on the throne he was anointed but God wanted his character to be a certain way because Saul had messed it up anybody with me this morning [Applause] and we don't have much we still dealing with chapter one of Sam of of of first Samuel 25 right the death of a great man whose name was Samuel but on the road to this because there's a background we need to understand with this thing Saul as a backslidden king had some victories had some successes had some experiences but through this journey we know the story they came to a crossroad there's war in the land and you don't know what to do with the Philistines and and the Bible said and I want us to catch this the Bible said that anybody who Saul taught could have fight he he recruited them one time one time if you look like you could fight he was coming to get you so if you were not with Saul the belief was you can't fight so the fact that David was not there it was a testament that David looked like he couldn't fight but we know the story one day Jesse sent David to carry food for his brothers and to collect the little a little piece of the paycheck that they got the Bible said so so so Jesse could buy some stuff for the house and that kind of stuff and while David is there he hears the Cry of Goliath send a man to fight me and David we dramatized it was walking away from the situation and he say wait wait wait wait hold up hold up hold up what are going on here who is this uncircumcised Philistine if nobody going and fight him I will go you know and Saul would have said to David listen you are but a youth so you cannot go this man called golad been fighting from his youth so you're not qualified for this thing and David had to respond and say but as a Shepherd I had need to defend the Sheep against the lion and I overcame against the bear and I overcame I think I'm qualified a man who wasn't trained in the school of man was telling the king of the land I'm qualified to go and deal with this thing and Saul say well if you wanted they even take listen whoever could fight gol gain Saul daughter gain money David didn't even do it for that know David saying is a uncircumcised Philistine defying the army of the Living God this thing don't sound right with me not it it it's not sitting well with me it not resonating with me amen and I'm trying to speed through this path because this is where the issue starts we know where David kills golad and Saul ask the question who is this he didn't just ask who is this know let me let me get to the exact verse in in in 1 Samuel 17 he asked the question there at the end of who son ad do he even asked him what your name is he said who whose son are you and I'll get into that a little later on and the Bible says and it goes on that in in verse in chapter 18 of 1 Samuel and it came to pass when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistines that the woman came out of all cities of Israel singing and dancing to meet King Saul with Tabet with joy and with instruments of Music they rejoicing because the Philistines had them back up for a while and the woman answered one another they they testifying to one another as they played and said shall Saul had slain his thousands and David his 10 thousands and they rejoicing they just happy they just happy than you went inside you know but verse 8 and Saul was very rough and the saying dis pleased him and he said they have ascribed unto David 10 thousands and to me they have ascribed but thousands and what can he have more but the Kingdom so Saul had to get a fight he not rejoicing because the pH know he was in his throne you see how power does corrupt he can't say well bless the Lord thank God for this man called David oh gosh he help no no no no no he said but wait a minute what what song what song Let just play back the track play back again no it played slowly Saul they're saying Saul had killed th and David no no no no no take it off the air take don't play on your radio ban that music but I can imagine in secret everybody playing it know Saul kill a thousand David kill 10,000 all the little children on the street and assault he get upset I want to paint a picture and imagine after that with the George in next verse and Saul I David from that day and forward not Saul prayed that David would get would grow stronger in faith and in Grace and in knowledge and in wisdom and the Lord will use him mightily for the next next service from that day he said I am funny thank you brother George and listen not only that you know and it came to pass on the tomorrow that the evil spirit from God Came Upon Saul and he prophesied in the midst of the house and David played with his hand as at other time so so I want you to understand for all the time David playing to drive the spirit away it's not as if Saul don't know David David inside the man king come inside the CLE but this time after the conquest of Goliath the Bible said and there was a javelin in Saul's hand and Saul cast the javelin for he said I will Smite David even to the wall with it so here's this King ready to kill David for why why and David avoided out of his presence twice and I'm building to something here now just very quickly after this incident the Bible said that Saul tried directly and indirectly to kill David many times he said David you could have my daughter you know he's sending through some men to tell him that but if you want daughter you have to go and kill a 100 Philistines and get their forkins because Saul telling himself there's no way possible David could kill a 100 men the Bible say David killed 200 so sa at a back down so and and Saul say I will give him a daughter so she'll be a snare tra to him so in other words so I could WhatsApp her to know where he is so the Bible said that one time that that that that that Saul sent men to his daughter's house because now by this time David is his son-in-law you know so he's a warrior he's a musician he's in the court he has a seat at the table he's a captain of the God and he WhatsApp the daughter say where David you home and and the daughter tell David David here now if you don't run tonight you're dead tomorrow and the Bible says you read the Bible that she make a little figurine put it under the pillow and make it look as if David day and when the men come they say where David he say you see sick they say we want David we come to look for David he he's sick I might him to get up into the room they recogn but wait now David not here Saul say to his daughter how you could trick me so he get vexed with his own daughter because he want to kill David so much I'm building a a drama dramatizing here after this thing the Bible says David ran to Samuel to tell Samuel all that Saul trying to do to him I'm seeing all of this to build a connection between David's almost large last major encounter with Samuel was him pouring out his heart to Samuel about how Saul trying to destroy his life I wonder how Samuel died he would have died with mixed feelings you know because he died with no Clarity he just had to have trust in God with how this thing going to work out because at the time of his death David was running for his life just two more I want to touch before get into this thing here the Bible said that there was a time of a feast this is this is in 1st Samuel 20 when David fled and the Bible said David is just running he's running he's running for his life he's in the wilderness could you imagine a man with a revelation of kingship but his situation is not kingship what do you do when your Revelation doesn't match your situation David and his friend Jonathan Saul's son is pleading with his father he say what what's really going on and the Bible says that that there was a time that David was supposed to come and there's a seat on the table for David and David is not there the first day saw make no fuss about it he maybe say he had to clean up himself before he come into my presence the next day it came to pass on tomorrow that David's place was empty and saled unto Jonathan his son wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse I want you to note here he not calling him David this is his son-in-law he asking for his son-in-law he name saying hey wa where David know he say where is his son of Jesse so the son of Jesse means I want to call this boy name know D to your son he want to call him David he said why is the son of Jesse this is Saul's son-in-law a warrior a man everybody know wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meet meaning to eat neither yesterday Nor today yesterday I give him a pass but by today I thought he would have been here and Jonathan answered Saul David earnestly asked the leave of me to go to Bethlehem and he said let me me go I pray the for a family at a sacrifice in the city and my brother he had commanded me to be there all this is a response that Jonathan given Saul to test to see Saul's response then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan and he said unto him thou son of the perverse rebellious woman he set up his daughter to kill David now his own son Jonathan he said thou son of the perverse rebellious woman do you not know that thou Hast chosen the son of Jesse again the name son of Jesse I want to point it out because we're going to meet it again to thine own confusion in other words and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness in other words you are was a son now for as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground Thou shalt not be established nor thy kingdom wherefore now send and fetch him unto me for he shall surely die and Jonathan answered Saul his father and said unto him where therefore shall he be slain what had he done and Saul cast a javelin at him to Smite him whereby so he tried to kill his own son now this the same son he say if Jesse's son live you can't get his throne now he want to kill his son who's supposed to get he throne and I want to show you something here is it sounds an interesting story but this is what an evil spirit does to somebody make no mistake about it this is Brother Saul once anointed because Samuel the same Samuel who anointed David anointed Saul but the Saul who is sitting there is not the one who David who Samuel anointed know because the man has an evil spirit that making him jealous envious angry in so much it eat into him that he willing to kill his son he willing to come against the daughter's marriage anybody with me it gets worse you know 1st Samuel 21 are you with me this morning everybody with me and David came to Knob to ahc the priest and ahc was afraid of the meeting and the mindblowing thing through all of this is David still serving Saul at no point is he rejecting an instruction is he stopping doing the purpose that he's he's supposed to do in fact during the whole running he saves the people in the village of this will be the village of uh uh uh uh kellia as it were but just before that David went to a himc the priest and a himc was afraid at the meeting this is this is 21 why out and and when a himc see him he said why are you why are you alone a nobody with you and David said to uh himc the king had commanded me of business so Saul trying to kill him and still sending him instructions of things that one done in the government and thing and David so gentle so Meek so honest so pure that he know the man want to kill him but nothing stopping him from fulfilling the King's Command you see the kind of man David was and David realized he have no sword and stuff and and and and uh I want to skip through some of this this is verse eight and David said unto a himc is there not here any under thine hand spear or sword for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me because the king's business required haste and the priest said the sword of Goliad the Philistine whom thou slewest in the valley of ela behold it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod if thou will take it take it for there's no other Sav that here so the only sword we have here is the sword of goli if you want to take it and David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul and The Story Goes On the point I want to make here is that when Saul heard cuz he trying to track David down now and a painting a picture is the last part of it and David then departed then in in this is chapter 22 and let's go to 22 but Shan to verse 22:6 and when Saul heard that David was dis covered and the men that were with him now Saul aboard in giba under a tree Rama having his spear in his hand and all his servants were standing about him then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him here now you benjamines will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and Vineyards and make you all captains and of thousands and captains of hundreds that all of you have conspired against me and there is none that showeth me that my son had made a league with the son of Jesse and there is none of you that is sorry for me so only if you didn't sorry for me that that I stressed out here that David there winning and David there getting blessing and only not sorry I want you to understand the psychology at work here all not feeling sorry for me or show it unto me that my son had stirred up my servant against me to lie in weight as at this day then answer do the Edomite which was set over the Servants of Saul and said I saw the son of Jesse notice nobody calling him David so I want to identify in Saul's Camp the way to refer to David was the son of Jesse it became somewhat of a derogatory term we are calling him David the son of Jesse then answered D the Edomite which was set over the Servants of Saul and said I saw the son of Jesse coming to Knob to a himc the son of autb and he he inquired of the Lord for him and gave him vitual of food and gave him the sword of Goliad the Philistine then the king sent to call a himc the priest the son of ahitub and all his father's house the priests that were in knob and they came all of them to the king I want you to see the picture here now you have an angry king looking for an innocent boy who did nothing to her this King and Saul said hear now thou son of aitu this is a priest he's talking to and he answered here am here I am my Lord and Saul said unto him why have ye conspired against me thou and the son of Jesse in that thou H has given him bread and a sword and has inquired of God for him in other words you see a prayer for him and he should rise against me to lie and wait as at this day so Saul is also spreading word that David out to get him he is spreading his like a a misinformation campaign he's saying watch now if you don't know David trying to kill me I just letting you know I mean you might have heard other things about David you know he killing Philistines and you know he's out there defending the people and stuff but behind the scenes I just want you to know that this brother who looks like he is for the Lord he is ready out to get me so I want you to just look out I want to know and I'm in in fact I'm very upset that he didn't call me you don't have my number you don't have abna phone number you don't you don't have Jonathan phone number you don't have anybody phone number so why he didn't tell me so listen to verse 14 and a himc answered the king and said and who is so faithful among all thy servants as David so the priest up he he confused he said he say who is so I don't know anybody who is more faithful to you than David which is the King's son-in-law he says so he faithful he's your son-in-law so you telling me your son-in-law out to kill you and go it at thy bidding meaning everything David does he does at your command and is Honorable in thy house meaning he has done nothing to dishonor your house are confused I want you to show an evil spirit at work did I then begin to inquire of God for him be it far from me let not the king impute anything unto his servant nor to all the house of my father for thy servant knew nothing of all of this less or more in other words I don't know nothing about what you talking about with David trying to kill you and David out to get you and David trying to remove you from the throne I know nothing about that kind of stuff I want to build it something here now right and the King said Thou shalt surely die look at the response of King Saul to a priest Thou shalt surely die a himc thou and all thy father 's house and the King Saul anointed Saul said unto the footmen that stood about him turn and slay the priest of the Lord because their hand also is with David and because they knew when he fled and did not show it to me but the Servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the Lord and the King said to dou turn thou and fall upon the priest and D the Edomite turned and he fell upon the priest and slew on that day four score and five persons that did wear the linen ephod in other words on that day they killed 85 priests on that day 85 priests were killed because Saul felt that a him did not let him know that David passed by this way and so allall because of an evil spirit thought it was justified to slay priests this goes beyond slaying Brothers now this is Priests of the Lord who just doing their Duty as priests no wonder God said Saul will be finished and his line finished and knob the city of the priest smort he with the edge of the sword listen both men and women children and babies sucklings and oxen and asses and sheep with the edge of the sword so Saul stood there and watched 85 priests and men and women and children killed so angry he was at this man called David and one of the sons of aimc the son of a hbe named ABA so one of the son of the priests escaped and fled after David and ABA showed David that Saul had slain the Lord's priest now you know the kind of man David was and David said unto ABA I knew it that day when brother dog because these are brothers in some way for of fashion cousin join up all kind of they in the church so I knew it that day when brother doag was there the Edomite that he would surely tell Saul I have occasioned the Deb of all the persons of thy father's house in other words is I I I I cause this and that would have eaten up a David abide thou with me fear not for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life but with me Thou shalt be in Safeguard so I want to paint a picture that riding with David is this man ABA who's a priest who his whole family dead so with David brother Hugh is a bunch of angry men men who know if they get caught up with Saul's men they will get killed Men Who you you you understand the context the picture everybody with me I hope you have time today know because we we have to finish this course I can't do this in two parts this is this is one part we have to finish here and I get to the message yet this is still the foundation right chapter 23 of 1 Samuel then they told David saying behold the Philistines fight against kellia and they rub the trashing flaws so David dealing with all of Saul's foolishness and while Saul spending good time chasing David the Philistines attacking the villages homes being destroyed marriages being destroyed young people going into the world all this but meanwhile Saul chasing David I want to paint a picture because this here is not a story of yesterday this is now we're talking about if you don't get back no appreciate nothing appreciate what happening today present tense so they told David David I know you're under pressure and I want to paint a picture of a man under pressure because that's where we going a man under stress a man who is angry a man who is frustrated a man who is pure in heart but they're pushing him to his breaking point they're pushing him to become something that he's really not but under pressure people do all kind of stuff the gentle quiet accountant for 20 years he go to work and then he get up one day and go to the office and kill everybody say but he was so quiet not realizing that he had reached his breaking pointu 23 verse2 therefore David inquired of the Lord and this is one thing you will find with David over and over in scripture David are going to just move just so amen amen before David move he inquires of the Lord he said Lord shall I go and smite these Philistines Under Pressure but if you tell me to go I feeling a burden I know they Under Pressure I know they have no meent to fight I know they have no no defense but if you tell me to go Lord here I am send me and the Lord said unto David go and smite the Philistine and save Kia and David's men said unto him behold we be afraid here in Judah in other words we know where saw men because you're telling us go out of hiding because these men hiding for their life you're telling us to we we under pressure here in Judah they tell us to go out and fight now a whole different Army now the Philistines behold we be afraid here in Judah how much more then if we come to kellia against the armies of the Philistines then David inquired of the Lord yet again he said Lord hear what your brother is saying and the Lord answered him and said arise go to kellia for I will deliver the Philistines unto thine hand so David and his men went to kellia and fought with the Philistines and brought away their cattle and smed them with a great Slaughter so David saved the inhabitants of Kia so even though he under pressure even though Saul went to kill him David still doing all he could do for his people and I'll skip I'll skip through the rest of this thing here by the time we reach 1 Samuel 24 is the encounter of where Saul is sleeping in the tent and David has the opportunity to kill him that's right and he goes down and he cuts a piece of His Garment and he hides back away and when Saul gets up to walk he calls out to him and I want you to look at the conversation here now this is 24 brother Shan and we're going to verse four and the men of David said unto him behold the day of which the Lord said unto thee behold I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee then David arose and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe priv and it came to pass afterward that David's heart smot him he got got convicted because he had cut off Saul's skirt and he said unto his men the Lord forbid that I should do this thing unto my master the Lord's anointed to stretch forth my hand against him seeing he is the anointed of the Lord look at the respect that David still has for Saul after multiple attempts and you want to knock people out because they say one word against you one word somebody say something and you so vexed with that you want to go to war Saul meddled in David's marriage he tried to kill his own son he sent multiple men to kill him he sent David to get killed and here it was David has the chance to kill him and the most he could reach is cut a piece of his clothes and even that he get convicted he say oh God God forbid I can't do it no wonder God could say a man after my own heart when you have the power to revenge and do Vengeance and and and even the score and flatten the table and and and and and anybody with me and and here his Faithful Men these men these men not trying to be evil enough they know the stress that David is under no wonder David said many are they that increase that trouble me they know they hear the cries they hear the sighing they know they say David K here let's go here David whatever you need when David need a drink of water and he send them he couldn't these men so loyally pour the drink of water on the ground he said I even drink it here he has the opportunity to take out the man who wants to kill him and David can't bring himself to do it all of this is bottling up in David anybody with me this morning the Lord forbid that I should do this thing unto my master he's still calling him Master the Lord's anointed he still recognized that his man is Anointed no matter what he has done to me he's still a man of God I can't bring myself to disrespect him to stretch forth my hand against him seeing he is the anointed of the Lord so David stayed his servants with these words and suffered them suffered them means plea with them because they ready to go these men ready to fight they're ready to s listen it is not David just give us the word and we take him out know if you don't want to do it and I know you're feeling convicted turn your eyes go back in the cave we'll handle it for you we we have your back because these were David's Mighty Men I want you to everybody have friends you know I heard somebody say recently it's one thing when you make up with somebody but is Friends has be the problem sometimes because they know your makeup so David has suffer the men now suffer them not to Rise Against Saul because they ready say well David you car go no problem go and sleep wait didn't wake up in the morning the problem wouldn't exist say what listen Brothers Stand Down e i telling all you stand down leave Saul alone they don't touch his head but Saul rose up out of the cave and went on his way David also arose afterward and went out of the cave and cried after Saul now this is this is almost mindblowing to me because this is red big man thing you know this is not no joke walk with the Lord because this is somebody who tried to kill you multiple times and listen to the operation of David cried after Saul saying my Lord the king look at the respects my Lord the king and when Saul looked behind him David stooped with his face to the Earth and bowed himself you see the respects you see the humility and David said to Saul wherefore hearest thou men's words saying behold d David seeketh thy hurt behold this day thine eyes have seen how that the Lord had delivered thee today into mine hand in the cave and some B me kill thee but mine eyes spared thee and I said I will not put forth mine hand against my Lord for he is the Lord's anointed moreover my father look at the term of respect he's still calling Saul father moreover my father see y the skirt of thy robe in my hand I was this close to you so I'm not just talking I'm showing you I could have do it the skirt of thy robe in my hand for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe and kill thee not know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand and I have not sinned against thee yet thou htest my soul to take it he David playing the Lord judged between between me and thee and the Lord avenge me of thee but mine hand shall not be upon thee I'm not going to touch your soul and as sayeth the proverb of the anels wickedness proceeded from the wicked but mine hand shall not be upon thee and then he goes on Saul after whom is the king of Israel come out after whom Dost thou pursue after a dead dog after a flea the Lord therefore be judge and judge between me and thee and see and plead my cause and deliver me out of thine hand and it came to pass listen carefully now when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul I want us to pause here for a minute and it came to pass when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul that Saul said listen to his words now is this thy voice my son David all the time before his son of Jesse son of Jesse son of Jesse son of Jesse is as if he didn't even recognize his voice but David's word had cut true the evil spirit upon Saul at that moment is as if Saul wake up from the evil spirit and he say wait now is David that is that is is is that you is this thy voice my son David no longer son of Jess know my son David and Saul lifted up his voice and wept and this is where I find it's painful because this is the issue I have friends people have evil spirits upon them you know and through the moving of the evil spirit upon them you see glimpses of the real person so there's the real Soul make himself known there through the evil spirit that guide in his hand and his decisions So when you say you wrestle not against flesh and blood but principalities and powers and spiritual wickedness in high places on the throne of Israel is a man under the oppression of an evil spirit and his actions until or if he ever gets delivered because we know so and in witchcraft raising up Samuel from the dead through the witch of indor he went straight into witchcraft but look at this glimpse of the real man stting to show himself don't make of the real person showing themselves through an evil spirit we get into some things this morning how we doing for time I start the message yet all right no I go I go in don't worry today I TR watch away listen the party now start we start yet we reading message yet we we not warming up and it came to pass when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul that Saul said is this thy voice my son David and Saul lifted up his voice and wept and he said to David Thou Art more righteous than I so this is this is the real soul the soul that Samuel anointed this this is the original Soul it reminds me when Jesus met Legion because Legion was crying because there was the real man inside it was his Spirit upon Legion that had him acting crazy with and naked but the real man that was inside of those spirit is who reached Jesus and when those Spirits came off Legion put back on his clothes the man who was called Legion that man put back on his clothes and went and testify hey I know you see me acting crazy before but thank God he took those Spirits off of me I'm a change man I'm a different man anybody with me this morning Hallelujah hallu Thou Art more righteous than I for thou Hast rewarded me good whereas I have rewarded the evil so Saul now he could see what going on yes and thou Hast shown this day how thou Hast dealt well with me for as much as when the Lord had delivered me into thine hand thou killest me not for if a man find his enemy will he let him go well away so it means you're really really you're you're not my enemy wherefore the Lord reward the good for that thou Hast done unto me this day and listen to Saul's words for now behold I know well that thou shalt surely be king sa is a Believer this is this is the believer talking I know you're going to be kinging and that the Kingdom of Israel shall be established in nine hand swear now between me and the evil spirit coming back upon me while I talking sense swear now therefore unto me by the Lord that thou will not cut off my seed after me and that dog will not destroy my name out of my father's house and David swear unto Saul and Saul went home but David and his men got up unto the hold and that leads us to the verse we started with and Samuel died but David is no fool because after 25 is 26 and 26 but Claren Saul tried to kill him again so the context of the situation sister Oliver is that David couldn't even attend the funeral he was still a wanted man he's still a fugitive he don't know who to trust save his 600 men men who had been through some stuff like ABA whose family was killed when all the priests were killed men who had debts men who had trouble men who were Outcast men who had crossed all family the wrong way over time David had been walking with these 600 men the burden of leadership was upon this young man he had no fixed place of aboard he Throne is his promise but the Wilderness is his home from point of the Wilderness to point of the Wilderness he is moving trying to find someplace to go it's it's not easy but a hue to feed 600 men all of this is weighing down on David he is under stress he didn't grow up in a royal family he didn't grow up in a big family he is there and he's trying to reason and he's trying to figure out and what do I do with these 600 men who all they could do is fight these are warriors now 600 Warriors so the Bible says now let's go and Samuel died and all the Israelites were gathered and lamented him and buried him in his house of Rama and David arose a great man died and a great man Rose and went down to the Wilderness of Paran and there was a man in my own whose possessions were in carel so there's a man in my own whose possession were in caral that is like saying you're living in ARA and you're business in pter Spain I want to paint the picture here and the man was very great now when the Bible says you're great you're great Stephen when the Bible say you're very great you're very great there's great and it's very great if God said the man is very great he's very great and he had 3,000 sheep and a thousand goats and he was sharing his sheep in camel so he's in MA lives there but his possession in caramel and he sharing his sheep in carel there's no question he's great so this chapter we are reading so far has introduced to us three great men the great man Samuel the great man David and now this great man who we have not named just yet but he we know he's a great man not just great but the Bible calls him a very great and he's sharing his sheep and and the process of sheep sharing at that day friends was a big event because sharing of the sheep men they were cutting off all the W from the Sheep it's a process sheep was the currency of wealth at that day so the man who had plenty sheep had plenty money plenty wealth plenty status and the Sheep sharing brought with it a whole celebration the culture of the day is when there is sheep sharing going on you will cook big food invite the village invite those who are less fortunate it's like a whole Cale a because hey we sharing the Sheep but when in that moment it attracted all kind of ragam muffins too so it was a whole thing with protecting the process of the sheep in preparation for the Sheep sharing and the the result of the sheep sharing anybody with me I know we do a ship here in Trin but the ship sharing for all the young people who really didn't the Sheep growing its wool growing growing growing and after a while you have to cut it off in fact it said that if you don't cut it off in the summer time they could die because they get so hot and warm that they would die so it's a process of wealth the the the the wool would be cut and turn into fabric the milk and the meats some of them will be killed so you could have some good food and all this this good stuff right so let's go now the name of the man was nabal and this word naal I've done a Bible study in this before but I want to look at it another way now the name of the man was nabal and this word nabal by translation means fool so his parents know what he was doing because they named him fool so I want to make a point here now this is a very great fool so foolishness is not limited to people who have small stature you could be a very great fool you could be a very educated fool you could be a very wealthy fool let's make no mistake about it so the Bible has established that he is very great but the Bible now says that the name of the man was neighbor which means he's a fool and the name of his wife Abigail and she was a woman of good understanding and of beautiful countenance how does a woman of good understanding and of beautiful countenance end up with a fool we live in a world where women want to be of good countenance beautiful countenance but the Bible makes a distinction about Abigail that she is a combination of a beautiful countenance but of good understanding it is more important to be a woman of good understanding and a woman of beautiful countenance we getting somewhere this morning yeah we going we say the party I think the party start a little bit so we have a woman of good understanding are you a woman of good understanding all the all the sisters in the house are you a woman of good understanding we are all beautifully and wonderfully and and wonderfully and fearfully made so all everybody according to scripture have the good countenance part the good understanding part I trying to get to this morning but we do know based on scripture the fact they highlight Abigail's good continence men she was a little above average if you could say such a thing in scripture because the Bible take note of this point anybody with me all right I didn't say it there I'm just a messenger don't get EX with me take it up with management I didn't write the book the book wrote it of but the but the man was chish I mean he rude he have real bad attitude very great but rude very wealty but the man attitude stinks and evil in his doings and he was and look at it he was of the House of Caleb in other words he saying listen the same Caleb who say give me my mountain in other words he from a good house you know but his house had no bearing on the way he grew up this man is a rascal so you could be from the best house but George your house and your lineage but a Hugh don't turn into a good man you know he had to forsake the teachings of his father's father's fathers all the way back to the man called kale anybody with me and David heard in the wilderness that nabal did share his sheep so David there give you the burden now the context the drama all we talked about already happened with David the the attempted assassinations the stress all the pressure seeing the priest killed David is close to his breaking point he is hungry he is tired he's frustrated ated he is wary and we all get wary sometimes and David say okay where are we going to go what are we going to do the men say David we love you but we hungry David wherever you're going we going in no but of course let we go some somewhere we get some food now where we where we could sleep and rest at night verse four and David heard in the wilderness that Nabor did share his sheep and it goes on to explain this later on but by verse five and David sent out 10 young men and David said unto the young men get you up to camel and go to nabal and greet him in my name and thus shall he say to him that liveth in prosperity it's a powerful statement what do you tell somebody who has money what do they need what is a man who have money need so David now is is is is in the same way he was gracious to Saul in in the same way he is into the spirit of discernment a man after God's Own Heart he say tell this man that don't need material things these things Hallelujah peace be both to thee peace be to thine house and peace be unto all that thou Hast David is very conscious that you could have money and have no peace you could have prosperity and have no peace you could have a good job and have no peace you could have education and have no peace you could have all anything you want in the world and have no peace so the best thing I could give to this man that I know that he would need is peace greet him in peace anybody looking for peace this morning it is better to be on a on a on a on a mat on the ground with peace than to be on the best bed without peace because with peace you could sleep with peace you could rest because people sleeping without rest peace in the valley peace in the midst of the storm peace when the doctor say I don't know what's going on with you Lord give me peace when I get bad news I rather have peace than money because peace is more precious than Prosperity the peace in my mind and my heart to know my children in trouble but God give me peace that everything is going to work out and all things will together for good and peace to know that the mighty hand of God could deliver them peace to know that in the middle of my trouble the Great Mighty hand of Jehovah could reach out and open doors [Applause] and David is not doing this for sure he's not trying to make an impression he is genuinely in the midst of his situation saying oh God what would this man need I don't have money I don't have food I don't have anything to give him but just giving the only thing I could give him because as as a type of Christ David understood what peace was Jesus is called the Prince of Peace tell this man peace not just peace to him peace both to thee peace be to thine house peace be unto all thy H peace be unto your staff peace be unto your household peace be unto your children peace be unto your cattle peace be unto your land peace be so these young men would have walked up Sister Jenny with a confident message to carry to nabal 10 men talking on the way up the road you say any peace be to your house part I'll say any peace be unto your family you say peace be unto your land who saying it you saying it no practice it peace be no not no do it stay these young men practiceing because they're going up to a great man's house they haven't had much opportunity to interact with great men because could have been running they've been hiding they've been anybody with me caves and Tents and these things they have spent days Days in the wilderness I wonder what kind of man NE is and a hungry boy hope I wonder if you give you something now boy you think we can eat it before we car back for David go all be hungry you think we have to you ready think we to we to wait till we carry for David first sh till we can eat it on the way down until we just tickle appetizer all of this brother car I want you to picture the picture peace be unto all our house that and verse S and now I have heard so David is this whole message so after the peace the salutation of Peace as it were verse 7 and now I have heard that thou Hast sharers now thy Shepherds which were with us so he's informing nabal of a turn of events now thy Shepherds which were with us we Hur them not in other words if we wanted it by force we could have take it we heard them not neither was their ought missing there was nothing misses unto them all the while they were in camel ask thy young men so don't take our word for it ask thy young men and they will show thee wherefor let the young men find favor in thine eyes for we come in a good day is a good day we know your sharing we know it have food we know it have what kind of extra food food on the table food on the a real food it's a good day we come you know we come a day when you're struggling we come in a good day give I pray thee whatsoever we not making a demand we not ask we're not telling you what to give us just give us something we hungry you see the picture here we hungry give a pray whatever come to th hand unto thy servant andto thy son David David sent a a group of men to convey with as much humility as much respect as much background as much context as possible he he making no demand he's been sincere he's been honest and he sent his message to nabal and when David's young men came they spake to nabal according to all those words in the name of David and ceased so they said everything that David told them to say and nabal answered David's servant and said who is David and then you could see his political allegiance and who is the son of Jesse when last you heard that all true Saul Camp is who is this Jesse son he goes further there be many servants nowadays that break every man from his master in other words he's saying he a really asking who is David and know he say who is who is this David Fell and he's supposed to be in Saul Court how come we ready I don't know if I want anybody with me and it's not as if D nabal would know because everybody know what Samuel said everybody know because the Bible said that Saul knew that God was with David so it's not uncommon knowledge everybody know David the Bible said it his name was spread all around and here is this man who's in a position to help saying who is David and who is the son of Jesse that there be many servers nowadays who break away from from his master is is is is this David still under salt inspiration come on is he still under wasn't he under Saul's Ministry who his master that plenty that break we break we breakway CL hallelujah look look look at the context so neor nebor is into politics now he's not acting like a man who seeing hungry people he's saying what church what church David in now who is David plenty people leaving church and thing people leaving their master and think who's this this David and who is Jesse's son he quoting things he here in sa Camp I'm painting the picture this is this is this is no thing I talking this is not but but but the mic this is not years ago thing we talking happen now how David could do that how David could start the own thing David have 600 men in the wilderness we can't find him we don't know where the church is we don't going the church he moving I'm here there everywhere and look at verse 11 now listen to the spirit of the man now shall I singular personal pronoun take my bread and my water and my flesh that I have killed for my sharers and give it unto men whom I know not when they be what kind of I me my my i i i i they like Lucifer I shall arise I shall I shall Ascend I shall do this totally lacking the fact that the Earth the Sheep everything is God own totally forgetting that you are just a steward it's not your you don't own nothing see what you're carrying put you in a box and see where carrying with you now you own nothing is your water can can we talk a little bit my bread my water my flesh my sharers Hallelujah so you can imagine how these brothers who went up feeling hungry and they thought they had a good message to carry for nael they F was excited they was practicing but the mic rehearsing peace be unto you peace be unto you if you didn't know we was out there with your Shepherds and you could ask them we protected them we guard them we had touch them we asked them we so respectful we wanted to come to you first we know it's a good day we see kind of thing we help make sure nobody has steal one sheep from you now them fellas turn around walking back so David's young men turned their way and went again and I want you to picture the 10 of them walking back because they know brother Clarence the pressure that David has been under and now the took turn now where even who telling him you telling David who telling David what nabel say who is really and in this scripture here we see it's not easy to be a messenger you know you know there's a time in the Bible they kill the messenger The Messer have nothing to do with the messenger but the messenger get killed because the news so bad man Just Kill the Messenger them brothers walking on the hill frightened and I can imagine IM David sign up there cuz them fellas hungry them fell holding the the belly in the hand hey we see them coming back you know I see one I see two I see three wait now I seen give B let me check he seeing a cicks I seeing a pacol I seen a bon all you good all fin Placer they the wrong directions your house what what happened and as they come closer clar I can imagine one Brave brother say David here this now you have to s for this one yeah this is this one because it it a looking good so David's young men turned their way and went again and came and told him all those things breing and David reaches Breaking Point David say listen here today if this is it everybody dead this is it one chapter before he Spar Saul he could have killed Saul he could have he said this is it everybody de you know you see people say you if you you you know who is me the other day I see a video punch of these two ladies in her Grocery and like the aisle was too small and they're trying to pass and as one pass and brush next one it turned a physical fight just because they couldn't pass and I have to realize we're living in an Angry World you know young people are angry people have Road raged if there ever was a time of anger is now and sometimes it's not anger is in nature it's just you don't know what somebody left home this morning with and barely pull it together on the way to work and you just give them a bad drive and you just get the last 25 years of bad drive just meet the D STW that break the camel back and that person get I have seen videos with with road rage get to the car go in the trunk pull out a thing brake vehicle scor hold thing all around the world and they would it wasn't a dis morning thing CA that is 5 years of abuse two years of stress one boss they don't want to see some other situation whatever it was it was just the Tipping Point and here it was we see David after all the pressure by the George now reach here's the first time David is stepping out of character now bear in mind friends nebor owe them anything nabal has no obligation to give them anything nabal they didn't work and have a contract with with with naal and D supposed to pay them and he refused to pay them they volunteer to do what they do and here it is David is so angry he is angry he reaches breaking point you say everybody G up your sword and they ging on every man his sword this is verse 13 and David also good in on his sword so David said this it fellas we go and eat today and everybody dead and they went up after David so David not letting men go in front and leading him and know David leading this thing as a angry man leading 400 angry hungry men who had been running for their lives living in the wilderness and they are angry and they're about to kill everybody anybody with me amen ging on every man his sword and David also ging up his sword and there went after David about 400 men and 200 by the stuff it was 600 200 stay back and 400 riding up with David but one of the young men this is one of nabal's young men told Abigail nabal's wife saying behold David sent Messengers out of the Wilderness to salute our master and he raised nailed on them so this little brother thank God for this little boy without no name is a big part of the story we don't know his name but this man saved everybody if there some people have to meet is people like this because this young man if he didn't do that this whole story of David would be a very different story he say Abigail hear this now man David sent 10 men they went to the boss you know how boss is and he railed on them listen isn't it the young man but the men were very good unto us so this is a young man who was out there in the wilderness and we were not hurt neither missed we anything so this is the firstand testimony That nabal was supposed to get that he refused to get because of his arrogant polit political foolishness as long as we were conversant with them we had fellowship with them when we were in the fields they were a wall unto us hallelujah both by night and day all the while we were with them keeping the Sheep now therefore know and consider what thou will do for evil is determined against our master so somebody send him a WhatsApp whether they told him on the way out and say listen boy you know we was in the field together run for your life we coming back because when David hear this he coming they know the State of Mind whether it was then whatever it was this young this one young M the Clarence was the one who we could say was closest to them brothers so it was in their best in to tell them listen get just get just get to the house because we don't know how David taking this thing so whether it was a smoke signal a WhatsApp message a text he know trouble coming he had a choice you know he could have run for his life and say fire bur you know how long I want to get out this walk you know how long I look at my reason to get this walk let me just head out of it but he saying to her here for evil is determined against our master and against all his house household for he is such a son of Bal so he's describing neor as a son of Bel means what we say in J here he wless that's the translation there he's a wless man a waste of time talking to him that's what he's saying here right that a man cannot speak to him so coming to you Abigail oh God thank God for the abigailes you know because nobody could talk to this man he's a very great man but this foolish worthless man nobody I hope there are no men in your here that nobody could talk to you you see said some lessons inside of here let it not be said about you nobody could talk to you you know no I be honest I know some people that nobody can talk to them and then people will tell you don't talk to me you know they would tell you they don't let let it be said they would tell you I don't like nobody telling me nothing don't talk to me so the servant is saying you know you know you living with the man you know nobody can talk to him then Abigail made haste I love that one piece of Crypt right there listen what a note here friends is Abigail Eddie fendy man say how you could talk BOS you know like um anas and saf if it was a wife like Safar who you talking about you talking about my husband so the Bible said Abigail made haste friends some of us moving too slowly Abigail made haste and we'll see how this is important Abigail made haste and took 200 Loaves and two bottles of wine and five sheep ready dressed and five measures of parched corn and a 100 clusters of raisins and 200 cakes of figs and laid them on asses and she said unto her servants go on before me in other words carry that just go behold I come after you but she told not her husband nebor and it was so as she rode on the ass and she came down by the covert of the hill and behold David and his men came down against her and she met them so want you see this this encounter we're not going to be too much longer with you but it see the encounter 400 angry men led by D David coming up to kill they just have one motive to kill everything and here comes some donkeys with food and a crazy looking beautiful woman racing down instead of running away from danger she is running into not 2 5 10 20 25 400 angry men all with swords coming up moving at PACE this is Pace meeting Pace because she's moving fast and David moving fast because you know when you're angry people just move super faster Vex we don't move slow you a slow vexed person we will Mar that it taking throwing something and be like how you moving you don't ever move so fast David is Angry Men angry and and and I want you to picture this this clash as it were of armies 400 led by David and a brave courageous spiritual woman of understanding Hallelujah give us more women of understanding who will fight for their houses especially when the man of the house don't want to do his [Applause] work in the face of danger she's going in the face a danger as it were she met them verse 20 verse 21 now David had said so now it's going into what David thinking is so this is what David had said to himself his men now David is said surely in vain so this is this is this is David venting this is David relating and this is many of us parents this is many of us Believers when you do something and you wonder if people appreciate it when you do something and you feel no gratitude when you do something and you feel no kind of appreciation because old David was asking God I help you a little thanks now so David they saying surely in vain you know many parents I here say say say this in some form or the other I I don't don't I waste time with them Ching know if they only understand the sacrifice I make when I bur my belly and I didn't do things I wanted to do to send them to school and I pay for extra and they have no idea the the I went to the credit union and I did this thing and I did that I work extra and I do overtime and all kind of anybody could anybody understand what I'm talking about this is the reality of life we dealing with to know so David is talking like so many of us see not making sense or nobody surely in vain have I kept all that this Fellow Heart in the wilderness I feel like I waste my time it's better I went to the next Village it's better do our next thing it's better I didn't know children it's better I had one child it's better I had two better I give it to somebody else better I send a neighbor to school anybody can relate I pay for you to go to school and you come up with nothing this is the reality of life here you know I sent you to school for friends you went to school for friends I I were you there for friends where where where your homework why your report card so all the report card have is games games games surely in vain this is David and it applies to any part of our Lives that's why I say this gospel is a real thing you know this is David at his breaking point so the issue here friends is not just neighbor's issue the issue is this is a pent up this is David saying a fight for Saul and look how he treat me it is now bottled up in this moment anything Soul asked me to do I did it and he said to kill me and this no just enable and I com everything is wrapped up so I want you to understand the context is not just limited to the enal encounter it's the issues of Life gathered all together at that moment for David and when that happens we all need an Abigail if you don't have an Abigail you are in trouble surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hat in the wilderness so that nothing was missed at all pertained unto him and he has requited me evil for good so and more also do God unto the enemies of David he just named The Man an enemy of David he's so upset he pulling back prophecies and everything if I leave all that pertain to him by the Morning Light any that piss it against the wall that is men standing up right so every man dead if you stand up to piss you're dead that what you saying here if you're looking like a man you're dead be careful sisters anything looking like a man are killing be careful and when Abigail saw David she hasted again speed watch your speed she haste to pack she haste to him so I want you to understand the contrast the shock to David because this woman is not tentative in her approach she is running to him so she she run to David soon you see him she speed up and she lighted off the ass and fell before David on her face so she used her countenance uhuh she use her beauty this is not the time for beauty you ever see a a a angry man beat up a beautiful wife go talk to the Social Services all of them who feel the the beauty is what the thing is men with money tell their beauty gets boring you know well I don't want to go into that to this not not not not this morning you young sisters if all you're fighting for is looks looks Fades quickly you know not just look of looks to no but the value of looks because when men come into a position of Crisis they need a woman of understanding when they meet a cross with a decision your beauty can't figure out the mortgage and your beauty can't figure out the next career move your be come on now somebody talk back to [Applause] me when real decisions are made it has nothing to looks can you help me decide the next move because the woman's supposed to be a helpmate to help Adam when God look at Adam he say it's not good for man he needs some help it's a blessing if you look beautiful but make sure you're a woman of understanding that's real value to bring to the table anybody with me this morning she fell before David on her face a rich woman a powerful woman a woman with servants a woman with help a woman with soldiers a woman of prestige a woman of status a beautiful woman a woman of understanding fell to her face and bowed herself to the ground reverence humility respect bless this woman and in that moment the respect because clearly she was a woman of understanding and respect even to her foolish husband but here she had the opportunity to show respect and reverence to a man who was not her husband but good Lord this is a king and we'll get to it and fell at his feet and this is mind-blowing friends to show a type of Christ a type of the Bride so many things TI in here this woman stood there and said upon me my Lord upon me let this iniquity be Abigail said hear this if you want to kill anybody kill me put it on me don't go no further this wrong that you feel wrong is on me this reminds me of Abraham when God say I've reached my break with God God reaches his Breaking Point too he say I've come to the end with Sodom and Gomorrah I come to wipe them out and David say Lord hold up hold up hold up if there be 50 David Abraham sorry put himself between God and Sodom and Gomorrah because he have family there so here Abigail standing just like Abraham not a prophet not a king not a priest but a woman of God standing between judgment and her house and say upon me let this iniquity be upon me just like Moses because when God saw the gold the gold and calf he said I'm going to wipe them out and build a new house under you Moses and Moses that remind you but God remember your promise to Abraham and to Isaac and to Jacob and everybody else and and the Bible says in Exodus 32 God repented of his thought to destroy all of Israel because Moses stood in the Gap give us more mothers and fathers who will stand in the gap between judgment and their house this is not politics this is not game this is real because Abigail understood that death was on the door let this iniquity be and let that thine handmade I pray thee speak in thine audience and hear the words of thine handmade let not my Lord I pray thee regard this man of bellel look at her approach she said don't regard this wless man God even naal for as his name is so is he the man named fool he's a fool what I love about Abigail she try to defend him she say David he was having a bad day David the B the check crash David the bank Bus David the business thing she had tried to defend nothing again I use the parallel and and saf saf know very well what they decided to do but here is Abigail speaking truth even nebor for as his name is so he is nabal is his name and Folly is with him some people are real Folly and she was not embarrassed to say it brother Clarence I was hearing a school teacher speak and the school teacher was saying is really something else when they talk to parents in the PTA meetings because they would tell the parents your child this your child that and your child that and the parents is be saying nah mm and his parents he say they know that what lless and he says it is so much better the parents say you know you're right how can we work to fix it versus trying to cover up so I want to make a point here there's too much covering up abig try to cover up nebor she say the man named fool he's a fool and Folly if I tell you now how much Folly I went through but I th handmade saw not the young men of my my Lord whom thou did in other words if I was there if I was in the house I just went did run to some seasoning for all the lamb they want to cook I wasn't home if I was home and I saw those young men this was not going to be the situation verse 26 now therefore my Lord as the Lord liveth and as thy Soul liveth seeing the Lord had withheld thee from coming to shed blood so she already speaking into the prophetic she is already speaking in last 10 say seeing that the Lord has already held your hand she not telling him to hold your hand anymore know seeing that the Lord had already Hold Your Hand this what this is this is a woman this is a spiritual woman and she is speaking to a spiritual man who lost his way she's speaking to a man who's under pressure who's tired who's weary so she is speaking is almost like all those he called he justified know he justified already already speaking in past tense seeing that the Lord had already with held your hand she already considering things done as though they were she's already she's already speaking in faith anybody with me Hallelujah seeing the Lord ha withheld the from coming to shed blood two things and from avenging thyself with thine own hand which we know Vengeance only Belongs to the Lord listen friends do you understand that according to scripture Vengeance only belongs to God that as a Christian you could never tried to avenge anything only God reserved the jurisdiction to avenge that the moment you try to do retribution or or or or or do any settling of the score you are going into God's territory that he reserves only for himself it is not your place or my place to bring judgment or to bring that leave it up to God to S it out so this is not just a woman of of of a house because she was able to quickly deter DET how much food to pack get the horse get the get the donkeys ready she is quick she's a manager she's an administrator she understand the spiritual Realms she speaking in the prophetic she's speaking in faith to understand the doctrine that is not your place to avenge anybody it's not your role to do that kind of stop David now therefore my Lord as the Lord liveth and as I still live it I'm still in verse 26 seeing the Lord has withheld thee from coming to shed blood and from avenging thyself with thine own hand now let thine enemies and they that seek Evil My Lord be as neor in other words let him be an example let him be an example let they be an example in other words you don't get involved in that let God deal with it and she goes on and now this blessing which thine had men had brought unto my Lord all this food let it even be given unto the young men that follow my Lord and I can imagine could you imagine David angry you know somebody angry they start to get red the veins stinging and and I can imagine Abigail just cutting through cutting through David and his steam like letting of the pressure the pressure that's coming now and David is is mystified he's baffled he don't understand what going on here something he said what it and all the anger that David I just starting to fade away I pray thee forgive the trespass of thine handmade for the Lord will certainly make and look at look at she's in the prophetic now for the Lord will certainly make my Lord a sh house so she's speaking into his life in this like she is actually quoting Samuel there now so Samuel the prophet is dead but she was in the books and the tapes anybody with me she's in the days of the voice of the prophet Samuel she in the books and the TI and she's saying now David let me remind you of who you are let me talk about your past your present and your future Hallelujah give us more sisters who are sensitive to the times the seasons and the word for the hour to speak about the past the present and the future so she goes on in the spiritual realm there I pray the forgive the trespass of that in in other words forgive what I'm about to say don't take this your wrong way David I'm saying it out of respect to you all right but the Lord will certainly make my Lord a sure house because my Lord fighted the battles of the Lord and evil listen to this had not been found in thee all thy days so she knows who David is she knows David's testimony she knows David's life she knows David's Ministry and she knows up to this point on there's been no evil found in David there's nothing we could hold against David there's no transgression we could bring there's no accusation we could bring against David can the church say Amen am verse 29 and now it shows that and this is it you can be a parent and don't know the attack upon your children upon your family upon your house what going on in the global economy what going on in the National scene this woman who was under the headship of a fool even though she was under the headship of a fool she is still spiritually aware even though she's under the hch up of a fool she still know what's going on she said yet a man is risen to pursue thee talking about Saul so she know Saul how to get him even though she under the Hat a fool she not ignorant to the word to the doctrine to the season to the time to the hour and to seek thy soul but the soul of my Lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy God and The Souls of thine enemies listen to this one she she not easy here them shall he sling out she going back to David Anchor Point to David with a sling with golad them shall he sling out as one out of the middle of a sling David and knowah since you are sling boy I know you since you're come on now somebody help me this is not you David you could do better than that and the same God who delivered you from Goliath is the same God that will deliver you now David lift your head up this is not you you're not that kind of a killer you're a giant killer but don't waste your time on this fool called Neal don't waste your time don't waste your ministry you have come too far you are supposed to have a sure house the Throne of David is supposed to be established [Applause] forever don't stay in the throne today don't stay in the Legacy today the same way God use a sling through you is the same with your enemies this is not your enemy like that this is not if you could do go go leave your man alone your man anybody with me and she goes on she done you know but the Clarence this woman almost preaching on verse 30 and it shall come to pass when the Lord shall have done to my Lord according to all the good that he had spoken concerning thee she was in the books and the tapes she knows everything Samuel talk about David so she ministering to the king who is not yet King the anointed rejected King who is still waiting for his time to be positionally placed he's not placed yet he's a king in waiting the crown is not yet upon his head he's not yet on his throne but he has have a certain character to sit upon the throne and she knows by Revelation that if David does this thing he will bring a stain to the throne can the church say Amen anybody with me thank God for the abigailes I am your Abigail this morning or know you come too far you know don't you know that you are promised that him not overcome will sit with me in my Throne that's your promise so I'm come to you this morning like Abigail to remind you of where you come from to recognize what day we in and to tell you where we going [Applause] [Music] next don't make the [Music] [Applause] mistake verse 30 could you take some more there a while I haven't preached a little thing like this but I tell the party but the party start but we go in we still go in just will be last lap I think have a last lap just we have last lap but this thing is nice to know thisen this is the word of God or know this is our strength this our Fortress we preached a few times ago about the Key of David the Throne of David if David had done this thing this whole story would be different we heard listen friends we heard how Saul was sewing the seed against David and saying yeah here David trying to kill me and that was without what the thing you say now um without factchecking without the evidence without proof they couldn't prove nothing if David had done this thing you see and you see what we telling all along all the time we telling David wless he's a killer he's a murderer he hasc people then look look we going and kill NE and the whole family and he didn't even owe him nothing there are people waiting to to see you for the people who they waiting to see your Fallen no matter how long you in church people waiting to see I want to see if you ready if you ready a Christian you know and Abigail is reminding David that your legacy is bigger than this verse 30 we almost done and it shall come to pass when the Lord shall have done to my Lord according to all that he had spoken conning thee and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel this sister knows the word [Music] she has spended all the time on Tik Tok on Facebook on Instagram and no she knows the word so she's recognizing David and the prophetic upon him and the ministry upon him and the future of C oh come on now verse 31 she's saying and when it to pass verse 31 that this here this moment in your life this breaking point this situation that could destroy your life your ministry your marriage your home your church your entire Legacy that this moment here shall be no grief unto thee no offense of heart unto my Lord in other words it will be a burden in your heart you'll be king because God said it but he wouldn't sit right on the throne it'll bother you forever it'll be a grief in your heart that this shall be no grief under thee no no offense of heart unto my Lord either listen that thou has shed blood causeless in other words how in the world you could kill nabal because he give you something he never promised to give you but Abigail having Liv with a fool for all her years was able to understand what a man was under pressure so she had as a woman of understanding she could find the right words to bring him back down and she speaking said David you know you know you know you have no cause to do this thing two things that this have no grief under thee nor offense of heart unto my Lord either thou has shed blood causeless or that my Lord had avenge himself these are two is like if you go the court count number one that we charging you with is killing Without a Cause count number two is avenging yourself because these are both errors these are both wrong she's saying these are the two counts that will be held against you that thou shed blood Costless or that my Lord had avenge himself but when the Lord shall shall have dealt well with my Lord then remember thine handmade so she's saying listen when you reach up there remember I give you this little encouragement remember I help you turn your course a little bit and there's somebody in this room today who thinking of doing the wrong thing who on a Verge on a Breaking Point they about to do some nonsense and I'm praying that the word to you today would be your caution saying don't do it I know you're under pressure but check back the word and hold on to the Anchor of the word about what God said about you don't don't don't don't mess it up now hold on hold on don't mess it up now hold on hold on don't lose your cool now I know you're under pressure I know you're at your breaking point but hold on there's a promise over you that must be [Applause] accomplished we're almost done the musician can get ready verse 32 and David said unto Abigail blessed be the Lord God of Israel this woman was talking to a man you could talk to because NE can't tell him nothing but here is David his response he argue he debate this is the this is no wonder God is a man after my own heart and the Lord said unto Abigail blessed be the Lord God of Israel which send thee this day to meet me in other words you come here but I know you just come so the Lord I recognize the Lord send you to talk to me today and I pray that you recognize is the Lord sent me to talk to you today David recognized this wasn't Abigail talking to [Music] him blessed be the Lord God of Israel which send thee this day to meet me and listen Blessed Be Thy advice Blessed Be Thy advice some you taking advice from wrong people and he taking cursed advice your advice have a curse in it you can't say blessed be the advice but the advice is not in line with the word this advice is in line with the word she was reading from The Prophet's message she was saying what the tape say right here all the words of Samu was inside locked up while na in Folly she listening to the tapes while Nebel in Folly she in the word while Nebel in Folly she playing the song Saul killed 1,000 David killed 10,000 she know all them songs she know David by time she already in spirit anything anybody with me this morning so the advice that comes from a person in the word is blessed advice when my coworker tell me so and so the coworkers even sa they know they know God they have any Revelation what what what is is their source of Supply where they fishing from where they getting it from and you wonder why I keep hitting your head against you wall David a man after God's Own Heart to look at that woman who in that day a woman speaking to a King was a rare thing to see yeah so David is just being shocked that this woman is different to run into her Army to run up to her future king one who mad and angry about to kill he about to fight he about to kill and he said blessed be the god I I recognize you here but it's God who sent you blessed be your advice blessed be thou he say you are all blessed which has kept me this day from coming to shed blood and from avenging myself with my own hand and David reinforces her understanding and he says openly for in very deed he say as the Lord God of Israel live it which had kept me back from hurting thee he was saying you you and all was going to get it except thou had hasted in other words if you didn't come this fast to me you might be able to stop me that's how angry I am anybody with me David saying if you had moved any slower you dead no wonder the prophet say when the angel of the Lord is in the house and you want to receive him say stand up quickly to receive the healing he said move quickly don't move slow if you're a call to the altar run to the altar don't walk you don't run to the altar move quickly some of us move too slow so David is saying to her you're so blessed you don't even know how blessed you are because if it didn't move fast enough you're dead except though that Hast and come to meet me surely there had been not been left unto nabl by Morning Light any that pissed against you all verse 35 we're done just a few more verses so David received of a and that's which she had brought him and said unto her go up in peace to thine house see I have hearkened to thy voice and I've accepted thy person Hallelujah Glory we're almost done and Abigail came to nabal and behold and I want us to picture this look at this broken home look at this messed up situation nabal is so clueless while Abigail pleading for his life what is nabal doing throwing our fet whole fat going on know listen listen here and Abigail came to nabal and behold he held a feast in his house like the Feast of a king he party in he don't know that if abig didn't go out there in a matter of hours he dead everybody meeting dead you see how people could be and they say they'll be eating drinking marrying and he his de judgment on his door and he did crazy music hey where the where the stew chicken and who did not bring the stew chicken he in a whole party cless a feast like a king he's not a king the king outside in the wilderness looking to eat something and you having a feast like a king not knowing the King on the outside coming to kill you had it not been for spiritual woman God thank God for the spiritual woman in the house you know a neighbor's heart was Marry de on the door with a George and he had marry feeling glad feeling good I good I good I good thing good this year we had a good sheep sharing death judgment on the door clueless friends you don't know when judgment on your door you know and neighbor's heart was merry with him for he was very drunken wherefore she told him nothing less or more don't waste your time where you tell him this woman understanding on so many levels she come home and she it ain't worth talking to this man this man totally un foolishness still un foolishness until the morning light verse 37 but it came to pass in the morning when the wine was going out of nabal nabal get sober his wife had told him these things and when nabal recognized he almost was dead his heart died within him and he become a stone in other words na got stroke one time nebor get a stroke youn you mean I could have be dead verse 38 and it came to pass about 10 days after that the Lord smed nabal that he died so God killed him God has killing her God has take people off the scene God has wipe people out he in charge of that part the Lord killed him he removed him of the scene because this story of redemption is not just about David being guided away from destroying his line to the throne this is not just a story of redemption of nabal's house being saved because Abigail saved the house but God found favor with Abigail and say I want to have Redemption not just for David not just for neighbor's house but Abigail you too good to be living under that foolish man so she God wants to free her from that situation and when David heard that nabal was dead verse 39 he waited for the Wake he waited for the funeral he gave it time when David heard that nabal was dead he said blessed be the Lord that had pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of nabal and had kept his servant from Evil for the Lord had returned the wickedness of dble under his own head and David sent CS for the funeral no no no David sent and communed Abigail to take her to him to wife he said this woman here is too good listen David and many wife none got a chapter none of them got a chapter but Abigail because she was a woman of good understanding and when the Servants of David would come to Abigail to carel they spake on us saying David sent us unto thee to take thee to him to wife what a type of Christ and his bride what a type of the old headship of The Old Man and the old you to the new newness of a new headship under Christ anybody with me this morning and The Messengers like I come like a messenger to you this point they tell you hey David want to marry you know David see something in here that good all them years on all that pressure you take on the Folly of your old nature come on now under day was being bird something that you were feasting under the words of Samuel for all these years and your old nature trying to keep you trapped in bondage but God want to kill the old nature this morning the old enor all of us have a neor to deal with you know God want to kill the neor to free you so you're not married to the old nature the old you your old ways your old Folly your old foolishness [Applause] so you could be this great invisible Union between Christ and his bride it's a type all inside in there anybody with me you love this there a love story here you know all true scripture but if you can't read it and see Christ in every verse he to read the Bible all over again and we know David is a type of Christ and the woman is a type of the Bride in church come on now so Abigail was being broke cut out and her character Under Pressure showed the word was in her her because the word is in the bride so she could speak from the word that was inside of her so when confronted with crisis nothing can come out but the word and the mind of Christ dropped down to her to know what to do with the word so she can meet David in that Wilderness and when David saw her he said this is Flesh of My Flesh this is bone of my bone she speaking my language uh speak speaking about The Throne she's speaking about a sh house Hallelujah and David know the moment that old man is dead the moment the foolishness is dead I'm going to take her for her wife I'm going to take her for a bride because she's Flesh of My Flesh she is word of my word she is Spirit of my [Music] [Applause] spirit can the church say [Applause] Amen 20 sermons of David every service is a sermon of David is a messenger is a minister coming to you to say come on David checking you out he looking for a bride the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife ADM made herself ready but until you cut off the old man you can't marry this new one come on now until the old man is dead until this man of sin is dead until the old na is dead so we come here this morning to kill the old man and God is going to do it abig is not your job to do it it's not even David job to do it God say I will do it his vengeance is mine you have held my good understanding beautiful wife for so long is I put on the earth she is she's mine come on now somebody preach back to [Applause] me I hope you're with me this morning you know I'm almost done hallelujah and when he sermons of David will come to Abigail this verse 40 to carel they speak under us saying David sent us unto thee to take thee to him to WIP is like Eleazar go in to find a bride for Isaac the same thing David are going to go himself he sent his men God sent prophet he sent the prophet William brandham he sent a fold Ministry go find my wife go tell her I'm looking for her go tell her I want to talk to her go tell her she she she looking come on now tell her she deserve better tell her she deserve flowers every day tell her she deserves spiritual gifts every day tell her she oh come on now somebody preach back to me she needs a rich man but not a rich fool come on now because the castle I have for her streets of gold No More Tears no more crying no more sighing no more frustration no more sickness no more depression oh come on [Applause] [Music] now you may see it and the only reason she could live with that understanding and that beauty under that man is because the Bible says in Romans 7 why she's married she can marry another man within this is the only chapter I think in scripture where this woman has one H one husband at the beginning of the chapter and by the end of a different husband old man old fool old nature sinful carnal Rich Leia I have need of nothing I have money I into politics or going of foolishness and by the end of it King David King David King Jesus king Glory can the church say Amen oh I want to see my king I want to see my Lord I want to oh I want to be part of that wedding supper oh I feel good this morning anybody feeling religious hold on brother Hold on Sister your change is going to come I said to read this last verse here know but is the message coming out of the world coming out of the church into bride this was the house of a man of the house of Caleb you know it was a nice message church it was the house of Caleb nice message they have everything in there but she couldn't grow in that church she couldn't prosper in that church in that church was judgment in that church was death in that organization was that but here's King Jesus here's King David on the road to the throne Hallelujah and when the Servants of David will come to Abigail to carel they spake unto her saying David sent us unto thee to take thee to him to wife and she arose and bowed herself on her face to the Earth and said behold let nine hand may be a servant to wash the feet of the Servants of my Lord may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now friends I'm done when when Abigail went to David she wasn't going for husband all she was going for Redemption for her house she was pleading even for her foolish husband that's the real Christian walk you know that's the real Christian Journey you know so just like how Ruth was rewarded this can also be presented as this is AIG Abigail's reward am because she didn't go out for the becauseand she didn't go out to be you know what to be King David's wife the true rightful king of all Israel she didn't just like David just like David didn't ask to be king I didn't ask to be David's wife the same way you didn't choose this road but said the message will fall into the hands of the predestinated you didn't find this message this message found you this message pick you bleeding in the field doing what you're supposed to be doing living your life in your job whatever but on the day there's a seed that's growing there's a word there's a life inside of you that the devil want to kill but he cannot kill it it's a life behind the name that make the demons tremble may the Lord richly bless you stay on fire stay in the word God richly bless [Applause] you [Music]
