[45:32] well then we're on the same page now so
[45:34] if it's a requirement we have to have it
[45:35] isn't that right
[45:37] now we know that God wants to move isn't
[45:39] that right
[45:40] familiar code here and speak to this
[45:42] mountain Prophet said I believe that the
[45:44] Church of God is moving into a sphere
[45:47] now that's going to shake the whole
[45:49] world that's the first time it's been
[45:52] since the days of Jesus of Nazareth to a
[45:54] human being he said ask anything that
[45:57] you will and it shut it shall be given
[46:00] unto
[46:02] he said don't you see the words of Jesus
[46:04] Christ being fulfilled oh it's going to
[46:06] come to pass pretty soon he said I'm
[46:09] looking for it to happen in this meeting
[46:12] are you looking for it to happen you've
[46:15] got to be under expectation will you get
[46:17] what you expect oh if you expect God to
[46:20] move then he'll move oh but you don't
[46:22] expect nothing you get nothing oh
[46:24] Hallelujah glory to God and expectation
[46:26] in the atmosphere that is created by the
[46:29] Holy Spirit oh Hallelujah when you get
[46:32] into the spirit of the coming of the
[46:34] Lord then your expectation begins to
[46:37] rise according to the promises of God's
[46:39] word and God is obligated to keep every
[46:42] one of his promises outside his promises
[46:45] he can meet you but if you're standing
[46:47] on a promised word of God he is
[46:49] obligated tonight to meet you on the
[46:52] basis of his promises if he promises he
[46:54] will he'll meet you there and he'll heal
[46:57] you if he promised to deliver you he'll
[46:59] meet you there and deliver you if he
[47:01] promise I'll fill you with the Holy
[47:03] Ghost he'll meet you on the basis of
[47:05] that promise tonight oh
[47:08] oh he's got to
[47:11] because that's what makes him God
[47:14] the fact that he can keep his own word
[47:16] that's right because man's world will
[47:19] fail we speak in the morning and evening
[47:21] it perish but God's word will never fail
[47:24] and that's what makes him God so when he
[47:27] promised to deliver you when he promised
[47:30] to heal you but he promised to deliver
[47:31] your family when he promised to fill you
[47:34] with the Holy Ghost that's God's promise
[47:36] to you it's signed in his own blood it's
[47:40] got to happen the devil is a liar

[47:44] but he's finished tonight he's finishing
[47:47] your life finishing your heart finish

[48:17] that that anointing will strike the
[48:19] whole Church of the Living God

[58:14] Tabernacle or dwelling be perished if it
[58:16] perish or be dissolved we have one
[58:18] already waiting
[58:20] just as the little baby its muscles and
[58:23] the mother are twisting and turning and
[58:25] bit just and see uh and he said uh and
[58:28] you notice you could take a woman he
[58:31] said if she is ever so foul but when she
[58:34] become a mother a little while just
[58:36] before the bad baby is born said there's
[58:39] a kindness about the woman
[58:41] he said get around her and there's
[58:42] always something she's more tender why
[58:45] because that because there's a little
[58:47] angel Spirit waiting to receive that
[58:51] Natural Body he said and just as soon as
[58:53] it's born the Breath of Life comes into
[58:56] it and God breathes it in there and it
[58:59] becomes a living Soul he said now just
[59:02] that this baby is born then the
[59:04] spiritual body is there to receive it
[59:07] amen it's not right but I wanted to
[59:10] notice here that there's that sweet
[59:12] spirit that comes upon the mother she
[59:15] could be fouled she could be whatever
[59:16] praise God but when that baby is about
[59:18] to be born there's a kindness that comes
[59:20] over that woman that gets you say get
[59:23] around her there's always something he
[59:24] said she's more tender oh hella Justice
[59:27] is getting ready to come forth praise
[59:29] God Amen and my wife was telling me
[59:31] praise God even if with our last with
[59:34] our son here she said she felt that
[59:36] anointing just as he was getting ready
[59:38] to come out she felt that anointing come
[59:41] over her something praise God it was a
[59:43] flushing praise always an anointing it
[59:45] was a presence praise God how the
[59:47] prophet's words are real praise God
[59:49] hallelu isn't that right amen she said
[59:51] she failed it praise God spiritual body
[59:54] said now what she said no perfect Faith
[59:55] sit on perfect fit the prophet said here
[59:58] said now faith is based on forgiveness
[1:00:00] said and then then as we said this
[1:00:02] morning
[1:00:03] trying to get the plate the church into
[1:00:05] a place where we could really see
[1:00:08] Apostolic times moving Among Us so look
[1:00:10] at how it's connected
[1:00:12] faith is based on forgiveness
[1:00:14] people have uh on expectations for
[1:00:16] Apostolic times moving Among Us praise
[1:00:18] God hallelujah but we've got to come to
[1:00:20] forgiveness he said that's what we all
[1:00:22] hunger he said and it's just laying
[1:00:23] right at the door he said we see it but
[1:00:25] we want to see more of it see he said he
[1:00:28] had his listeners he said we wanted to

[1:00:33] and flow out to others
[1:00:36] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:00:39] hallelujah hey so if you have to have
[1:00:41] faith for somebody that forgiveness has
[1:00:43] to be there also

[1:01:01] oh and reform you and reshape you oh
[1:01:05] forgiveness where's the brotherly
[1:01:07] kindness but you want Faith to move

[1:01:35] door but it has to be such a flow that
[1:01:36] will help it'll be a help to us us to
[1:01:39] flow out to others oh hallelujah praise
[1:01:42] is not right that compassion has to be
[1:01:44] there isn't that right said now remember
[1:01:46] Jesus said now uh uh as we had in the
[1:01:48] lesson this morning he never used his
[1:01:50] power for himself
[1:01:52] he use it for others
[1:01:54] there it is
[1:01:56] nice so we want power power to heal a
[1:02:00] sick power to raise the dead power to
[1:02:02] cast our Devils praise God but it's
[1:02:04] meant for others and if it's meant for
[1:02:07] others then there can't be no Autumn
[1:02:08] grudges then you have to have been the
[1:02:11] right channel oh for God to use you to
[1:02:15] be a vessel to be used of God or you can
[1:02:18] be gummed up with hatred and envy and
[1:02:22] jealousy and enmity in your and your
[1:02:24] life praise God and ALT against this one
[1:02:26] or ought to get that you've got to get
[1:02:27] rid of that stuff in order for you to be
[1:02:29] a vessel for God to use you praise God
[1:02:33] people want power but there's a lot that
[1:02:35] goes with power there's a character that
[1:02:37] has to go along with that or what you'll
[1:02:40] end up with is a Lucifer on the earth
[1:02:42] killing people taking people out praise
[1:02:44] God with no forgiveness No Love No
[1:02:46] character of Christ amen to reflect
[1:02:50] praise God and to flow out be our help
[1:02:52] to others it's meant for others the
[1:02:55] prophet himself was sick yet he was
[1:02:58] praying for people and healing diseases
[1:02:59] and stuff like that and he had his own
[1:03:01] stuff going on he had his own ailments
[1:03:04] and stuff like that he said but a gift
[1:03:05] is meant for others he had the feel for
[1:03:07] them he had to enter into their
[1:03:09] suffering praise God it takes the spirit
[1:03:11] of God to do that praise God that's not
[1:03:14] you that's another Spirit God has to
[1:03:16] teach you Jesus learned obedience by the
[1:03:19] things that he suffered oh Hallelujah
[1:03:22] you have to suffer in order to Reign
[1:03:24] God's not going to give you power unless
[1:03:27] you're willing to go through stuff
[1:03:28] unless you're willing to go to heartache
[1:03:30] and to persecution go into rejection oh
[1:03:34] Halal going to respite Hallelujah and
[1:03:36] disapproval and stuff like that you've
[1:03:38] got to go through that in order to come
[1:03:40] out right on the other side
[1:03:45] a bunch of spoiled children
[1:03:49] isn't that right
[1:03:55] it's not
[1:03:57] there's brother green here he's talking
[1:03:59] about this is not a tailor shop I love
[1:04:02] that
[1:04:03] praise God this is not come and get we
[1:04:05] will fit something to fit you no you've
[1:04:07] got to get cut to fit this thing

[1:04:13] not going to cut anything to fit you
[1:04:15] praise God that's how it is you got to
[1:04:17] grow and earn your way into this mantle
[1:04:20] praise God in the right God's Not Gonna
[1:04:23] freely give it over oh Hallelujah isn't
[1:04:26] that right he did that once before and
[1:04:28] man fell in the Garden of Eden with all
[1:04:30] our power with all our Glory he gave up
[1:04:32] the word praise God and took the Devils
[1:04:34] that are the devil's uh interpretation
[1:04:36] isn't that right true Eve it's not right
[1:04:38] and they lost the whole thing there so
[1:04:40] man's got to be restored back by the
[1:04:42] same word or that he fell from oh hell
[1:04:46] is not right so that's why God
[1:04:47] hallelujah send a prophet with the
[1:04:50] restored word throughout the ages then
[1:04:52] when we receive that word then God could
[1:04:54] bring the fullness of himself in us oh
[1:04:57] Hallelujah because that character that
[1:04:59] nature where that person will be in
[1:05:02] there oh now he could give power to you
[1:05:04] now you could heal the sick now you can
[1:05:07] call for this call for that why because
[1:05:09] you've got his nature his being
[1:05:11] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:05:14] amen oh praise God he said use it for
[1:05:17] others that's what it was sent for and
[1:05:19] you think sometimes well why would a man
[1:05:20] feel so full of power like him ever be
[1:05:22] sick he said yes sir he said but I've
[1:05:24] read in a book somewhere he said when he
[1:05:26] raised that body up the Widow's son from
[1:05:27] nine he said I believe the prince uh the
[1:05:30] House of David he said he set on a rock
[1:05:32] and grown with a headache see he bore
[1:05:35] our infirmity
[1:05:36] bear means to pack them see carry them
[1:05:39] see he bore he had all these things like
[1:05:41] we have he had sickness he had
[1:05:43] Temptation he had trouble he had
[1:05:46] frustration just as we have because he
[1:05:49] had to be the right kind of immediator
[1:05:51] so he had to be a partaker the
[1:05:54] husbandman of the fruit before he would
[1:05:56] know isn't that right the woman at the
[1:05:58] well and many things see if we look
[1:06:00] right into the scripture isn't that
[1:06:01] right amen praise God so he had to walk
[1:06:04] that road in order to tell you about
[1:06:06] that road because he walked that road
[1:06:08] and overcame you you can walk that road
[1:06:10] also and overcome tonight isn't that
[1:06:13] right praise the name of the Lord okay
[1:06:15] so then sixthly statue of perfect man
[1:06:17] the prophet said let's add the Bible
[1:06:19] says that let's add Broderick love
[1:06:21] broadly kindness so he's going on the
[1:06:23] pyramid and he said no that's a good one
[1:06:25] right there he said the sixth seven all
[1:06:27] right he said adding bodily kindness all
[1:06:29] right he said when we get to that
[1:06:31] brotherly kindness he said put yourself
[1:06:34] in his place who your brother

[1:07:00] a moment to see it through their eyes
[1:07:02] praise God no you can begin to put

[1:07:06] begin to effectively pray for that
[1:07:07] person praise God because you're seeing

[1:10:19] sick and calling out sin and
[1:10:20] supplementing and discernment is flying
[1:10:22] all over the place praise God but they
[1:10:24] take a certain level of obedience to
[1:10:26] bring him up to that place where he
[1:10:28] could be a servant of God and a closer
[1:10:30] to God the prophet came the more shy
[1:10:32] like he become because he had to be
[1:10:34] trusting in God waiting on God Waiting
[1:10:37] for God he said you know what I'm
[1:10:39] waiting on I'm waiting on the Holy
[1:10:41] Spirit he can't heal the people he said

[1:11:02] be a man today but there would be God
[1:11:05] fail in the people it's not the Acts of
[1:11:07] the Apostles but the acts of the Holy
[1:11:09] Ghost and the apostles Healing The Sick
[1:11:12] praising the Dead cast on our devils and
[1:11:15] if ever God is going to work again today
[1:11:17] it's got to be the Holy Ghost veil in a
[1:11:21] pride on the earth oh she gotta have the
[1:11:24] mind of Christ the intelligence to know
[1:11:27] what he once done with the word and she
[1:11:30] does it in his name

[1:12:45] suggestion that's a requirement that's
[1:12:47] something you have to do in order to
[1:12:49] hear from God
[1:12:51] in order to be used of God
[1:12:54] other than that it's just a big self
[1:12:55] starting there

[1:13:02] seeing a lot of stuff
[1:13:04] at Liberty praise God but no life to

[1:13:25] all these words like Temperance patience
[1:13:27] godliness but it actually gets narrow as
[1:13:29] it goes up
[1:13:30] gets deeper gets harder to climb harder
[1:13:34] to find place to put your foot break up
[1:13:36] because there's less of you and more of
[1:13:38] God yo you know holding on is he holding
[1:13:40] on to you as you press your way up but

[1:15:26] hey many man
[1:15:28] amen
[1:15:29] [Applause]
[1:15:31] so when we come to God God forgives us
[1:15:35] if it gives you of your trespasses gives
[1:15:36] you he pardons you of your iniquities
[1:15:38] your sin your filth
[1:15:40] your messed up situation he forgives
[1:15:42] that
[1:15:43] but what this is asking us for is to
[1:15:45] forgive others
[1:15:47] to climb another level higher
[1:15:50] he'll pray God God if God forgive me
[1:15:51] then why can't I forgive you what reason
[1:15:53] what reason do I have to hold it against
[1:15:56] you
[1:15:57] when God let it go for me when God
[1:16:01] helped me when he freely gave to me his
[1:16:04] love his power what reason what am I
[1:16:07] holding on to
[1:16:11] you think it's about us
[1:16:14] well I was hurt he was mean to me and
[1:16:16] you don't understand what I feel
[1:16:21] do you understand how I feel it

[1:16:27] there was no one else in the room when
[1:16:29] it happened
[1:16:31] still forgiveness
[1:16:33] you still have to find it
[1:16:35] because the church lost it and the
[1:16:38] prophet said she's got to find it in
[1:16:40] order to call to the other members of
[1:16:42] the body come and read I hate to come
[1:16:44] and rejoice with us they got to find
[1:16:46] that lost coin
[1:16:50] it's right in the wood
[1:16:52] people walk around it says
[1:16:59] it's right here
[1:17:01] they make circles in the desert they'll
[1:17:04] make the death walk
[1:17:05] until they come to it
[1:17:07] got a content
[1:17:09] we've got to tear yourself down
[1:17:12] your pride
[1:17:13] your good self
[1:17:16] that nice self not a bad self you're not
[1:17:18] talking about bad Christians people who
[1:17:20] smoke and drinkers no good stuff that
[1:17:22] one who comes to church pay tithe come
[1:17:25] early
[1:17:26] sure wonderful person never give a bad
[1:17:29] handshake
[1:17:31] that self have to die and rot and be
[1:17:35] stripped and killed and laid dead
[1:17:39] then God will use it
[1:17:41] because that's a lot of just a solar
[1:17:43] self dear God can't use that
[1:17:46] when God ready to do the spirit ready to
[1:17:48] flow and you say oh no no no not that
[1:17:50] one
[1:17:51] really not that one why why not that one
[1:17:58] same on your blood can't take that same
[1:18:01] one is who I want to heal and bless and
[1:18:03] deliver and you have to get yourself out
[1:18:05] of the way enough
[1:18:07] to love that person's soul oh how to
[1:18:10] love that brother that sister's Soul
[1:18:12] enough doesn't matter what history what
[1:18:15] relationship what took place what
[1:18:17] happened gotta get yourself out of the
[1:18:19] way
[1:18:20] said I am my biggest hindrance if I get
[1:18:23] myself out of the way then God could
[1:18:24] begin to use meat 10 minutes into the
[1:18:26] people it's not right
[1:18:28] I am my biggest enemy that's the way
[1:18:31] you've got to see it praise God Amen
[1:18:33] isn't that right
[1:18:36] remember God's calling Fishers of Men he
[1:18:39] say told Peter said I'll make you fish

[1:18:41] what does that mean I'm gonna draw use
[1:18:43] your life
[1:18:45] to draw a man unto me
[1:18:47] in order to do that you cannot point the
[1:18:49] people to yourself Peter's Ministry and
[1:18:52] able to point the people to Christ point
[1:18:54] the people to Jesus to the one who can
[1:18:57] do something for them therefore it
[1:18:59] couldn't be about themselves it could be
[1:19:01] about Peter or Paul or James or John or
[1:19:03] any one of them it was about how much of
[1:19:05] themselves could die but they could
[1:19:07] Point themselves to the one who changed
[1:19:09] them to the one who saved them to the
[1:19:12] one who fill them with the Holy Ghost to
[1:19:13] the one who converted them Hallelujah
[1:19:15] and then Peter can say the one who
[1:19:17] confronted me here he is he is the
[1:19:19] spirit here's a spirit flowing freely
[1:19:21] that's his presence that you feel it's
[1:19:23] not me it's Christ
[1:19:25] praise God hallelujah then in order to
[1:19:28] be in that kind of a way

[1:28:04] he said now watch now you may look he
[1:28:07] said look now I don't like but I've
[1:28:08] never he said oh sure I don't I don't
[1:28:10] like brother Jones he's making making a
[1:28:12] point right I don't like butter so and
[1:28:14] so something like that right he said but
[1:28:16] just let something happen to him oh
[1:28:18] brother your heart is broke
[1:28:20] it nearly killed you see
[1:28:23] we can obtain bodily kindness and
[1:28:25] feeling for one another see but to
[1:28:28] maintain it in a group of people he said
[1:28:29] he said why do you care for that brother
[1:28:31] because you broke bread with him here
[1:28:32] the altar as as you would tonight you
[1:28:34] fellowship with him you shook his hands
[1:28:36] you worship with him he's your brother
[1:28:38] and he might do something in the flesh
[1:28:40] that you disagree with because you just
[1:28:43] kind of say stay well which way you
[1:28:45] ought to do you just Sun him a little
[1:28:46] and so on but in the bottom of your
[1:28:48] heart if something really happened to
[1:28:49] that brother you it would just nearly
[1:28:51] kill you or that sister amen all right
[1:28:54] he said I'm an old man I once was young
[1:28:56] and now I'm old I've seen it throughout
[1:28:58] the age do that here people say I don't
[1:29:00] want nothing out no more him and
[1:29:02] something happened to that man oh it
[1:29:04] nearly kills him see he thinks oh God I
[1:29:07] let my precious brother go without
[1:29:09] making friends with him something deep
[1:29:13] down inside you telling you that praise
[1:29:15] God hallelujah man that's a that's
[1:29:17] that's it right there proves that it
[1:29:19] does exist pray there is a brotherly
[1:29:21] kindness that exists it's deep down in
[1:29:23] the heart of you praise God even though
[1:29:25] you fall out even though things happen
[1:29:27] it's not right
[1:29:28] one time a scientist was telling was
[1:29:31] talking about
[1:29:32] um he was trying to prove the existence
[1:29:33] of God right here's what he said he said
[1:29:36] logic will tell you that if an old man
[1:29:38] is drowning in a pool
[1:29:40] he's drowning in the water and he can't
[1:29:41] get out and he can't swim to save
[1:29:43] himself logic and science will tell you
[1:29:45] let the man die
[1:29:47] because he's old
[1:29:48] if he's older than you and you are
[1:29:50] younger then logically your time
[1:29:52] expectancy is longer than his so it
[1:29:55] doesn't make sense to risk your life to
[1:29:57] save him stay out of the pool stay here
[1:29:59] and let him die that is what logic would
[1:30:02] say that is what science would say
[1:30:04] because it makes sense but something in
[1:30:06] the human Spirit won't let you do that
[1:30:09] something inside of you is telling you
[1:30:11] to save him that there is still a chance
[1:30:14] for him and the man said that's what God
[1:30:17] put inside of you
[1:30:19] that means you have a soul you're not a
[1:30:22] robot you're not a calculator there's
[1:30:25] something vibrating inside of you that
[1:30:27] loves other people
[1:30:29] you understand what I'm saying there's
[1:30:32] something deep down inside of you that
[1:30:33] loves him you've never met him before
[1:30:35] but he's a living Soul oh Holland
[1:30:38] somebody's out of his move to save that
[1:30:40] man if he said that's what God put
[1:30:42] inside of you he put something in your
[1:30:44] heart to love other people and forgive
[1:30:47] other people and help somebody and do
[1:30:49] something praise God and God could work
[1:30:52] with that oh Hallelujah he can't work
[1:30:54] with a robot but he could work with that
[1:30:56] because he put it in you praise God Amen
[1:30:59] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
[1:31:04] it's more than the science it's more
[1:31:06] than this logic it's a spirit
[1:31:09] you see and so if the spirit of God
[1:31:11] truly come upon somebody it will give
[1:31:13] them a burden for Lawsons if they're
[1:31:15] giving them it's not right amen the Holy
[1:31:17] Ghost really come into a man it'll give
[1:31:18] him a burden for this for the loss a
[1:31:20] burden to pray for somebody doesn't
[1:31:22] matter what church he goes to it doesn't
[1:31:24] matter what group what Fellowship what
[1:31:25] race he is praise God there's something
[1:31:27] inside of that man that's vibrating a
[1:31:30] life a presence praise God that's
[1:31:33] reaching out to others helping it to
[1:31:35] flow out to others and God can work with
[1:31:37] that praise God wants to use you but
[1:31:41] you've got to be willing to be stripped
[1:31:42] God's got to strip you more and show you
[1:31:45] less of yourself and more of him more of
[1:31:48] his love his power his forgiveness his
[1:31:50] Mercy oh and when you see it you begin

[1:34:15] do it righteousness is uh is righteous
[1:34:17] even as he is righteous praise God it's
[1:34:19] not right okay it's the part I want to
[1:34:21] get to
[1:34:23] is this a children of God are manifest
[1:34:25] and the children of the devil whosoever
[1:34:27] do it not righteousness is not of God
[1:34:29] neither he that loveth not his brother
[1:34:32] for this is a message that you have
[1:34:34] heard from the beginning that we should
[1:34:35] love one another
[1:34:37] not as Cain who is that of the wicked
[1:34:40] one and slew his brother and therefore
[1:34:42] slew he him because of his own Works
[1:34:44] were evil and his brothers righteous
[1:34:47] praise God isn't that right it was a oh
[1:34:50] it was an abominable thing
[1:34:52] what he said am I My Brother's Keeper
[1:34:54] praise God hallelujah how could he say
[1:34:56] that isn't that right that is that's
[1:34:59] evil praise God Amen praise God it's not
[1:35:01] right see of the wicked one see but
[1:35:03] Marvel not my brethren if the world hits
[1:35:06] you he said but we know that we've
[1:35:07] passed from that one to life because we
[1:35:09] love the Brethren he said he that loveth
[1:35:12] not his brother abideth in death this is
[1:35:15] a scripture you know
[1:35:17] amen my verse 15 says whosoever hate
[1:35:20] this brother is a murderer
[1:35:22] and you know that no mother had eternal
[1:35:24] life abiding in him
[1:35:27] hereby perceive we love the Lord uh we
[1:35:29] the love of God because he laid down his
[1:35:32] life for us this is a perspective amen
[1:35:35] and he gave his life for us praise God
[1:35:37] then we live our life of service service
[1:35:39] to others as Christ gave to us isn't
[1:35:42] that right and we ought to lay down our
[1:35:44] lives he said for the brethren for
[1:35:46] whosoever had this world's good has seen
[1:35:48] his brother have need and shuttered up
[1:35:49] his bowels of compassion for him who
[1:35:51] dwelleth the love of God and how dwell
[1:35:52] at the love of God in him question he
[1:35:55] said but my little children let us not
[1:35:56] love in the word neither in tongue but
[1:35:59] indeed and in truth and hereby we know
[1:36:02] that we are of the truth and shall also
[1:36:05] of our hearts before him for if our
[1:36:07] heart condemn us God is greater than our
[1:36:10] heart I know it all things this is the
[1:36:11] part I want to get to amen amen if
[1:36:14] you've got odds and grudges in your
[1:36:15] heart then your heart condemns you then
[1:36:17] how can you have faith before God
[1:36:19] faith is based on forgiveness so then he
[1:36:22] said beloved if our heart condemn us not
[1:36:24] then we have confidence towards God the
[1:36:28] Bible says it right here amen isn't that
[1:36:30] right this is what we want to come to
[1:36:32] praise God your heart condemned me or
[1:36:34] not now you're in a condition praise God
[1:36:37] to ask he said ask what you will and it
[1:36:39] shall be given because forgiveness is
[1:36:41] there praise God you've cleared it out
[1:36:42] praise God in your speaking terms with
[1:36:44] God ask what you will he said whatever
[1:36:46] you ask we receive of him because we
[1:36:48] keep his Commandments and do these
[1:36:50] things that are pleasing and inside and
[1:36:53] this is his Commandment that we should
[1:36:55] believe on the name of his son Jesus
[1:36:57] Christ and love one another as he give
[1:37:00] us his commandment amen Christian 4 said
[1:37:03] beloved let us love one another for
[1:37:05] lovers of God and everyone that loveth
[1:37:07] is a born of God and knoweth God he that
[1:37:10] loveth not know it not God for God is
[1:37:13] love and then this was manifested the
[1:37:15] love of God towards us because that God
[1:37:18] sent his only begotten son into the
[1:37:20] world that we might live through him oh
[1:37:23] you're alive tonight because of him
[1:37:25] praise God hearing his love not that we
[1:37:28] love God but that he loved us
[1:37:30] and he sent his son to be the
[1:37:33] appropriation for all sins so beloved so
[1:37:36] if God so loved us we ought also to love
[1:37:38] one another no man had seen God at any
[1:37:41] time he said but if we love one another
[1:37:43] God dwelleth in us it's the evidence
[1:37:46] that God is in you so shall he be my
[1:37:48] disciples when you have love one for
[1:37:50] another he said God dwelleth in us and
[1:37:52] has and his love is perfected in US
[1:37:54] hereby know that we dwell in him and he
[1:37:57] and us because he had given up his
[1:37:58] spirit
[1:37:59] and we have seen that do testify that
[1:38:02] the father sent the son to be the savior
[1:38:04] of the world and whosoever shall confess
[1:38:05] to Jesus the son of God God dwelleth in
[1:38:07] him and he in God Amen and amen do you
[1:38:10] love it tonight amen
[1:38:12] praise God so he said in this
[1:38:13] commandment verse 21 we have from him
[1:38:15] that he will love it God love is his
[1:38:17] brother also and a message Elijah I'm

[1:38:32] truth I do oh I want to I want to love
[1:38:34] me and I want the people to love me see
[1:38:36] that that's exactly the truth and if God

[1:38:40] me and if if I love his people then
[1:38:42] he'll love me for doing it God would
[1:38:45] rather add love you than love him he
