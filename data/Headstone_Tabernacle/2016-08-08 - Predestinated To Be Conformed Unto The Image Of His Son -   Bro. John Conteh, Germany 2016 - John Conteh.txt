mercy endureth forever let the redeemed of the Lord say so yes whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy and gathered them out of the lands from the East and from the west from the north and from the south kind of sounds like this meeting doesn't it oh they wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way they found no City to dwell in hungry and thirsty their soul fainted in them then they Cried unto the Lord in their trouble and he delivered them out of all their distresses and he led them forth in a right way that they might go to a city of habitation oh that men would praise the Lord

prayer requests here praise God there's one of them is written in German so somebody who can speak German and English should be good to translate this yeah okay well there's uh one here from uh FAO Giovani Farah Khan I guess it is from bethl uh yes come he says uh since 2001 I've been struggling with a tumor I am still under therapy please pray for me that God May grant me complete deliverance amen praise the Lord the name is y Anna the Lord Jesus Christ knows my need in my heart in spiritual sense my hunger and thirst for more and also his sickness in my in my body okay wonderful before we bow our heads I'll just say this you heard the testimonies from brother Tim puit just a few hours ago right now that's real that's very real and I know it is because a few years ago my wife um went into the doctor for back pain you know the story right yeah and uh they diagnosed her after an MR r that they took they said she had a uh uh her aorta the main artery out of the heart had a separation in it um uh like a u it was breaking open there's a certain word for it and uh it was very urgent and uh so the doctor wanted to come come in immediately and have a CAT scan they call it so they know how to operate because she could die at any minute it could break open and she's dead and uh so before she went we got down on our knees and we prayed not a long loud prayer with just a simple prayer in simple faith and just like brother Tim did I took this message for me I took it for myself and before I knew what I said said I said before the doctor's hand touches her she'll be completely healed well they brought her in they did the CAT scan about an hour went by the doctor called her in he had two pictures up on the wall one was before and one was after he said this here you see the line here he said that's what the problem was he said I don't know what to tell you ma'am but it's gone oh he's real oh yes he's real Hallelujah so we've got one tumor here and we've got a another illness that we don't know but Jesus knows so we know that he's real and we can pray for these two individuals now and let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we know you're real we know that uh you called this uh conference here Lord so that you could come and amongst your people and and speak to us and demonstrate yourself alive again today Lord you've never gone anywhere you just want us to wake up and realize that you love us and that you're here and that you're here to heal our sicknesses and meet our needs and deliver the captives so father I Lay My unworthy hand on these two prayer requests Lord may this boor be gone in the name of Jesus Christ and may this other answer come quickly to this saint Lord and meet their needs in the name of Jesus Christ Lord we believe it and we say together amen so be it amen praise His name praise the Lord amen praise His wonderful name I guess this would be the same key let's sing um hold to God's unchanging hand you know that song time is filled with swift transition isn't that true days we're living in I haven't been on this Earth long but I've been on it long enough to see it go from bad to worse to completely crazy we live in an insane world but let me tell you something else before we sing this song you know this message that the two brothers have spoken about that they're so passionate about you show me any other evangelist either present or past who could who could at 24 years old tell exact troop movements that was going to happen in a world war that hadn't even happened yet that was going to happen with the imagin or the sigf freed line and how the Americans were going to be uh overcome the Germans and this was going to happen with musolini and Hitler that he just came into Power 1933 and said what was going to happen in the next decade or two tell me who else can do that he did it that's who did it and then he and then he says and then as it goes on technology will get to a place till they have cars that are operated by some other power that need no driver that's now they have to implement it because the cities are too crowded it wasn't necessary before now it is and then he saw a great a woman rise in great power in the United States do I have to draw you a picture do I have to put her picture up there well tell me this is he was 24 this is 1933 that's a prophet that's Elijah amen hallelujah that separates him from all the others that and the fact that God followed that Ministry with Miracles and signs and wonders that all those other evangelists still talk about Benny in and the rest of them they still talk about what happened with brother brandham but they can't grasp it because it's not for them it's for you you little bride he loves you oh my Hallelujah so we're going to hold to God's unchanging hand amen you got the words up there oh uh is that the key yeah hold to God's unchanging we're singing whole to God's unchanging heav oh fill your hopes on things Eternal hold to God's unchanging and time oh yeah time is filled with swift transition not other un Mo can stand oh build your hopes on things Eternal over got to hold to God unchanging hand oh little children hold to goding God's unchanging oh oh to God's unchanging hand covet not this world's vain riches c not this world's vain riches hallelujah oh that so rapidly Decay oh see to gain the Heavenly Treasures oh because they will never pass away oh yes to God changing hand oh singing God unchanging oh sounds good come on everybody you sing build your hopes on things ET turn now oh hold to God's unchanging hand give him praise oh give him praise Hallelujah to God oh yes Lord thank you Jesus blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah to God oh blessed be the name of the Lord amen is our is our brother ready yet if not I'll go into another song I don't see him yet okay praise God Amen wouldn't the brother uh was speaking um this morning when um brother bisc was talking about the soldier that got delivered when he said that a song just exploded in my mind that I had heard and I'd never sung it or anything and I mentioned it and a few of the brothers had heard it before you give me a key for for there and uh some of you young people have probably heard it you know it's in some of the Christian radio stations and stuff but it just it when he talked about him coming out saying I'm free it just all of a sudden I could hear the song so I thought maybe it was supposed to be sung you know so I'll I'll sing the verses and those of you who know it just sing along if not that's fine but the chorus is so simple you know we'll we'll all catch C it up together and uh so it goes something like this says you unravel me with a Melody you surround me with a song of deliverance from my enemies till all my fears are gone I'm no longer a slave to fear I am a child of God I'm no longer a Slave To Fear right I am a child of God let's sing the chorus right now I'm no longer a slave to fear tear it up I am a child of God hallelujah I'm no longer a Slave To Fear hallelujah oh I am a child of God shall we lift up our hands let's give God some praise and worship tonight lift up your voices lift up your hands lift up your voices praise God hallelujah amen amen and amen and amen glory to God hallelujah thank thank you very much may be seated I want to be mindful not to forget the translators praise God it feels so good to be in the house of the Lord I I feel so humble and I feel so privileged to witness men still alive that worked with the prophet that walked in an age that we all aspired to be in the age of adoption one man that was that had an angel working with him and um to be privileged to be in that age and to see all that that in itself is amazing and I think these meetings is a blessing that we can go back down memory lane and bring back all the things that God did in the prophet and all the brothers their testimonies has just blown my heart away amen and um opportune to see what God did in one man but they themselves at that time can't partake of those experiences because when we are all predestinated to partake of those experiences at a time like this the same experience Malachi for had because he gave us a promise that we shall meet that same angel can somebody say Amen to that if that's your promise then say Amen to that tonight am amen glory to God hallelujah and he gave us precious promises revealed from the word from the back of the book and that by these promises we can become partakers of this nature experiences and those experiences is what it would take to transform us into the image of his son which qualifies us for the Rapture Hallelujah so I feel good tonight that I can witness Living Voices that saw God walked on two feet in this age if that's how you feel tonight then say Amen tonight if you feel that way tonight give a god a shout of Amen is a privilege Living Voices that can still give a testimony that God Elohim visited Our Generation and there was a wave shift over all of us that one day we shall come to the same spot where we can partake of that divine nature we can partake of that God we can partake of his nature of his Blessing of his works of his power but the prophet say the things you see in temporarily will become permanent in the bride so I want to thank brother colen Brana for his boldness of Faith to call these meetings he's really bold enough to call these meetings and I believe God has an agenda for these meetings God had a purpose for these meetings Hallelujah so call BR I appreciate you very much may God bless your effort and may God water the desires of your hearts we love you I've always appreciated you may God bless you and your lovely wife and your church praise God I want to greet all the convention on behalf of my wife s s and little church back home in Freetown we are privileged to be in these meetings it see beautiful ministers to hear God's servant speak we are blessed I was blessed since last night to all the ministers give their expectations it was amazing we thought we knew it all but praise God God has a bride around the world like brother Theo said this bride is not this bride is not a French bride it's not an English bride a German bride it's a universal bride it's a bride across the globe amen and you are not in this bride based on Association no group put you into this bride there's only one way to get you to the bride is by one Holy Spirit by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body glory to God hallelujah and my expectation tonight that God by his grace will baptize some people tonight into that body because once you are in that body no man can take you out once you are in that body no demon can take you out that's a place you orain to be praise God hallelujah hallelujah and what shall we say this morning about brother Eddie bisc oh praise God hallelujah men brother Bisal appreciate you very much try to present the body and Christ had to come through the volume of the book and Christ for this day had to walk through that same body and how he brought it beautifully making you see you are part of that body and because she part of the body you have something to supply in that body that was beautiful and for this afternoon for the team such a FY preacher praise God hallelujah well tonight is on my Lord I want to say some few things I'll take my time to speak because that's the audience we have Hallelujah I have a little thought for tonight I won't be long God willing a little thought tonight let's stand to our feet let's turn to genesis6 and then Romans 8 a little thought predestinated to be conformed into the image of his son that that's my title for tonight predestinated to be conformed into the image of his son that's why we are here this is not a church this is bride amen so genesis6 glory to God and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air and over the cat and over the the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image and the image of God created in him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth Romans chapter 8 Glory Romans 8:28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that is your predestination that is what you are predestined to become at the end of it all you are ordained to become just like Jesus to be conforming to his image and you have to believe that amen because seven Thunder gives you Faith to believe you can become like Jesus then say Amen to that tonight somebody say Amen to that tonight hallelujah praise God Amen that what the scripture says for whom he did for no he already pronate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and only be justified they be also glorified let's bow our headge down word of prayer Heavenly Father we are grateful for tonight we are not out of cause out of purpose you're D us to be here let your purpose be made known tonight father I pray that you just take me out of the way and speak Spirit spoken words into the hearts of your people Lord they've not gathered just for Gathering they came that they might see Jesus Lord we are such we are so caught in such a tremendous time like this and Lord we have one need and that need is the Lord Jesus Christ manifest yourself in our heart Lord Jesus pray for the young people tonight you know God the things they going through we can deliver them we can only present you to them make yourself real to them tonight I pray God that you open up the heavens and pour down the Holy Spirit and baptize Lord even the CPS who have not received the holy spirit yet those with the Holy Ghost I ask for ref feelings God tonight those without may you seal them dear Jesus Christ into this body give us the satisfaction guarantee that we shall know that indeed we are some sons of God we thank you Father for tonight bless the words that proceeds out of my mouth we thank you for all in Jesus name we pray and the church says and the people say you B seated hallelujah praise God hallelujah Glory Hallelujah will somebody say amen amen means so be it one more time let's say amen amen amen amen amen praise God hallelujah thank you Jesus praise God Amen well for tonight I want to find a way to see how I could bring forth your word for tonight we have promises in this Bible like it was in Genesis God spoke the heavens and spoke the Earth and right beneath the Earth there were seeds all kinds of seeds reptiles mamalian seeds serpent seeds all those seeds were on the Earth but you see it took the BR of the spirit until the Holy Spirit bruts over the Earth Hallelujah those Spirit life remain hidden say Amen that means the Holy Ghost had to come down brood over the Earth but as he was brooding life Spirit were coming out responding to the brooding but God under the back part of his mind he had an intention he had an image on the back of his mind so he kept brooding he kept brooding repan life showed up animal life showed up marine life showed up all kinds of Life showed up but he kept brooding because was going towards what was on the back part of his mind because on the back part of his mind had an image he had an intention for doing the brooding so he kept brooding until finally something came out of the earth that looked just like the one that was doing the brooding then God stopped can somebody say Amen to that church and that is why in this meetings we can't come to these meetings without the Holy Spirit brooding over you because you sit here tonight with all kinds of seeds all kinds of spirit in our minds in our flesh but as the Holy Spirit keeps brooding not it doesn't only expose those Spirits bring them out but God keeps going deeper Because deep inside of you is a seed a seed of God that lays deep inside the socket of your soul and that's the thing that God is trying to reach said the Pentecostals they can bring forth Deliverance I've seen that in my church and in many meetings the Holy Spirit Falls I've seen the Holy Spirit Falls in meetings I've seen people crawling with their tongue coming out they crawl on the floor like snakes I've also SE the Holy Ghost fall in a meeting in my church and I've seen people back like dogs see these are Spirit but as the Holy Ghost comes upon the church those Spirits cannot hide anymore because the Holy Ghost exposes all those Spirits all the church Spirits this called fanatical Spirits religious spirits that are hiding in the message when the Holy Ghost begins to Bro all those Spirits showed up Hallelujah but those Spirits is not you no those Spirits is not you you are more than those Spirits because deep inside of you God by the Holy Ghost is trying to reach that seed of God that he place inside of you that is his intention let somebody shout hallelujah hallelujah God sent a prophet Hallelujah and but the Bram had the logos of el know him this Bible that you see is a book of life it's a book of seeds all kinds of seeds lays in this Bible say all the religions you see today they all have a seed in here and God sent a Prophet by the Holy Ghost he begin to brood over the world since 1946 47 three pools brooding as he kept brooding all kinds of seed Spirit showed up even the hidden seeds like the serpent seed showed up because the Ser was but it was hidden but as he kept brooding all those Spirits all those lives showed up but on the back part of God's mind God had an image on the back of his mindl he was trying to see if you could have somebody that can become like Jesus and Malai came to East Third pool let somebody say Amen in the midst of the revelation of the serpent seed the church Spirit showed up false anointed Spirits all showed up all kinds of spirits showed up in the days of the Prophet but God kept broing God kept broing until 1963 when he hit the third pole a man show up his name is William Mario Bram a man that was a perfect reflection of Jesus Christ but the plan was so much like Jesus until people missed him for Jesus A Perfect Image that stood on the earth Hallelujah I'm so excited tonight Hallelujah that that is your promise tonight God's intention for the bring since 1946 was achieved when one man showed up there was nothing less than God on the Earth but the Bram had to understand the difficulty separating him from the son of man in future home he said that's where they get you the whole thing confused because he was a son of man revealing the but it shows that he was so much in unity with God he was so much in Oneness with God Amen Hallelujah God took his form Hallelujah God wore TI God put on shoes the prophet stood there it was God incarnated oh I feel so religious tonight I feel so excited tonight God made flesh that is your promise tonight Hallelujah somebody shch Hallelujah don't let no preacher take this away from you don't let no church membership take this away from you that you shall promise to become like Jesus you shall be perfect you shall be like your father you shall be like God if you feel that way tonight they shout hallelujah let me SE that so but Bram was a perfect reflection of Jesus Christ and God had to wave him in the midst of all the revelation of the serpent seed so that is your focus so but Bram was an image of God that came from the back part of God's mind he was not the serpent seed he was not your CH Spirit but you feel older and God stopped brooding when God saw a man that was exactly like himself why can't we feel good tonight you had what Edis said all they could let you see here was to see how God worked in one man how one one man was so much in unity with God he was so much in Oneness with God hallelujah until he could be misunderstood for God Amen people literally worship the Bram here to deny it that I am not the son of man I am only the El Son of men hallelujah praise God but that's how I feel tonight I feel tonight I can become like Jesus that sound like a hard thing to say so we don't see just Malachi for was a prophet the only man for our age in all ages that attained Perfection letting you see what was God's intention in Genesis that was his intention of creating Adam when it came to Adam who was he it was a reflection of God and Satan came and M image but God cannot fail am he gave a promise I will restore I'll bring it back hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I mean this is good stuff this stuff should make somebody shout this stuff should make some somebody feel happy Hallelujah this is not church I presume this is bride these are people that are making themselves ready for the Rapture these are people in whose heart is want to be like Jesus that's the bride not your church where you pay your tithes and pay your offerings I'm I'm not saying that but in your heart do you want to become like Jesus in your heart do you have faith you can become like Jesus in your heart do you believe you can become one with God you not say Amen too well you are not saying amen too well if you don't say Amen then I cannot preach because I must preach and you say Amen the prophet said when you say Amen you watch the words as you water the word the Holy Ghost comes down and pour the anointing upon that word so let somebody say Amen because this is your message this is your name this is your life this is why you are here you are not here to just be in a convention you are here to know what is your next plan in God after you leave here what is your next hope what are you living for why all this sacrifice pay all your money to come to a convention not to be an onlooker or an observer but to be given faith that once you leave this convention you going back to your country you shall become like Jesus you shall become my God hallelujah Satan might not like this he does not like this message but this is your message this is your life hallelujah praise God let me see it that's why you see when you go through all Mal false message all kinds of spirit look at the message today all kinds of spirit hallelujah hallelujah and people can use any code to justify anything because he revealed all the Mysteries am he R the all the he life that's in this Bible but what is your life and what you preach in your church that's the life you put into your people if you preach the word image that's what they will have in your church if you preach serpent seed that's what they will de but it's all in here but God's intention for brooding was not to get the serpent seed because God brooded past the serpent seed there's more yet to e and we shall come to it because that is your promise hallelujah praise God somebody shout hallelujah hallelujah in the message today we have a challenge a very serious challenge and our challenge is how do we put the word and the spirit together amen that's a challenge Hallelujah because Malachi 4 presented four steps justification sanctification B the Holy Ghost and Holy Ghost itself but God don't have four steps God has actually three steps because the early church had three steps Justified Sanctified and the Holy Ghost came with power no first steps they had the word and they had the spirit when they preach Holy Spirit Falls They Don't Preach and wait for a year later for the Holy Ghost to fall they had the word and the spirit together that's the church down through the seven Church ages that was broken apart God was separated St John 1:1 says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word there means logos so the logos was with Elohim and the logos was Elohim you can't break that God and His word are one and what became flesh can somebody say Amen to that church and St John 424 says God is a spirit so God is Not Just word but God is also spirit so to emphasize God as the word is breaking God into parts and that's what went wrong in seven Church ages separating the word from the spirit and each group makes emphasis on what they have they don't like no Spirit no shouting no Hallelujah no signs no wonders in the message is all Pentecost we have put away all the spirits because it's word word word word word but the word can deliver you the word alone can set you free the word alone can change you you need the word and the spirit somebody shout hallelujah so today in the message is the word if you preach signs and wonders it's Pentecost but just hear what theis said this morning that's not Pentecost that was called in flesh there was Jesus on the earth you can fool me this hour the book has been open you have seen your name you know exactly who you are you see so we make the same mistake that was made down through seven Church ages breaking God into pieces making God three making God four making God five but here Israel the Lord thy God is one God Mal for came back to bring the unity between God and His words Hallelujah can somebody shout hallelujah the word and the spirit that's how you are born that's how you are delivered I can preach all this word to you but if the spirit doesn't come on it you can't be delivered because the spirit gives life to the words the spirit activate the word the spirit makes the word move Hallelujah you be seated so in this age we can't have four that means when we come come to the third step it must be word and spirit together again like they had it in the early church had to bring the word after Pentecost because Pentecost had the Holy Spirit but no what and that only produced false anointed ones because the Holy Ghost came there was no seed word on the inside that's right so they spoke in tongues all kinds of Life signs wonders but still no word so God sent a prophet to restore back the word as the fourth line word connecting back the word to the spirit so as you sit here now by the time you leave here tonight the Holy Ghost will come upon you you shall feel God in power experience his spirit in your soul and you shall be changed Hallelujah you shall be called home and another am men glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and the prophet said what we have done today we have made too much stress the mechanics so so it's the stress you make what you stress is what you have we put too much stress on the mechanics but the mechanics without Dynamics is no good it takes Dynamics to prove whether it gasoline because the gasoline can be in the gasoline can maybe it's water so put fire on it then you can tell whether it's gasoline or whether it's water praise God hallelujah so the gasoline word has been poured to you all these years pure gasoline word now God can release fire to connect with the gasoline world and light you up for your age you become a light for this age a light for your generation can somebody shout hallelujah oh somebody say hallelujah hallelujah so we can go back to four steps because for restore the word now be justification sanctification B of the Holy Ghost then on your baptism you're back to and spirit that means when we come to the third pool which is our pool is word and spirit it will take a 5old minutes to to do that that's right it will take Jesus to take his word and take his spirit and put it together no man can do that we can preach the word but God will list the spirit we preach the word but God release corresponding power so it will take God in a f Ministry to take his word in his spirit and put it together and bless the church hallelujah praise God so brother John cannot do that but the Ed cannot do that it will take God himself to do that that is why we all must pray that God sent forth this ministry because you have promised a Ministry of Jesus Christ that Ministry is for your Perfection it is not about a man it's about Jesus Christ himself coming down to perfect You by his word and by his Spirit the word and the spirit makes up the Holy Ghost itself the Holy Ghost is in incomplete without word without spirit so the Holy Ghost itself that's your Perfection that's your Joseph word in spirit together until we have that we going nowhere and that is what we must contend for so in these meetings you can't come here this is almost 50 years after is gone our understanding ought to our open by now am you coming to this meeting looking for what no prayer no dedication no worship looking for what Hallelujah looking for statue of a man to speak to you that must change this is 50 years would should come to me like this with a prayerful heart not to see a man not to hear from a man but to see God in flesh the war taken on flesh that is how the church ought to be that is what these conventions ought to be we've attended conventions after conventions it's the same routine today conventions are May routine that's the truth come to conventions occupy a seat and be an onlooker what are you hearing now that you have not had before you've had all this what you have not heard and seen is the holy spirit that is what we all need now let's stand for a few minutes stand to your feet for a few minutes lift up your hands and cry to God for a few minutes close your eyes I'll give you 10 minutes just cry to go today for the Holy Spirit everybody in this audience lift up your voice to God no man can do this no man can do this it must be an act of the Holy Ghost this is what I expect in the convention all of us prayed up we come to Convention spread up Lord send the fire lord bring down the Holy Ghost manifest your power that is what makes a convention we have heard all the word word after word word after world where is the god of Elijah where is the same God that was in the prophet cry out tonight God must find a group it can be your group but God must find a people with a revelation a people to whom the world is open oh God oh God but the zma Spen was to dedicate these meetings to prayer because we have heard all the word the fruit value has been poured into you the book of life has been open unto you so you know exactly who you are you know exactly what you're supposed to become because the Book of Life has been open you are not deceived you know who you are I'm a Child of God I came from God I'm going back to God pray pray hallah I did come to preach to you Hallelujah I came to anoint your faith let let's use this few moments and ask God the same God of William B Bram let that God show up let that God come on the scene let me seated that let me seated when I'm talking to you tonight I'm not really preaching I was in Tred and I felt a strong voice in my heart that God is changed the season God is looking for people other P 304 will God called people to whom this book is open to Hallelujah because if this book is closed you don't even know who you are you can't Pray when Christ came to Resurrection Ministry for 40 days what he did he opened your understanding to understand the scriptures but it was scriptures concerning himself so they set themselves in that reflection he gave them promises he breathed on them they return to the upper room what we are they doing it was 10 days of prayer supplication that's how you tell when the book opens to your man if the book is open to you it will change your life Hallelujah because I am not going to set you down for anything less than that one image I left my Pentecostal church not to be another church member Hallelujah I came into this message to have all that was in the prophet all I'm after I must have all that was in Malachi 4 or I will not stop preaching this way I will not stop crying to God I will not stop praying until all that was in Malachi for his part to me that's why I'm here today hallelujah praise God hallelujah praise God I'm an eagle Son of God I will not rest and we shall not waste until we see the same God in that Elijah come back hallelujah hallelujah we shall not stop we shall not cease until the same God because this age has no hope if that God doesn't show up before God took Elijah of the scene God made sure he left Elijah is successor what could that age be like if there was no Elijah if there was no one man that saw the need to take back what Elijah had to save that age this age has no hope your family your loved ones look at all the young people what have they had we have told them almost all but their desire is to see God taking on skin that can't come by sitting there and you can't even say Amen it can't come that way it can come by you not even praying it can only come like it came in the early church there were are locked up in the upper room they spent time with God they did their own assignments their own homework and God saw that and God said fire let somebody shout hallelujah God must find that same group God must find those same people when I walk into an audience I can tell you if the book is open to that audience an audience with no amens no Zeal no crime that's how you tell the book is closed America will soon have a woman president Malachi 4 gave that to us as an end time sign before the analiation that is almost less than 100 years from now a woman will become president America what does that mean to the bride Woman as a prime minister now in London in Germany women taking over the seat of power when that works the tightening comes in World Church Council who are they coming after you to destroy that word image in you thank you Jesus like it was in the early church when they con that they knew that Christ was to be formed in this man they came against them and the scripture said they locked up in the upper for fear of the Jews we are back on the same thing again but God by his grace has opened the book To Us brother I sense The Squeeze is coming on can somebody say Amen to that church I sense The Squeeze is coming on this is time to unite with the word get closer with God hallelujah give your last breath say God I've got to get out of here I've got to go my home is a future home Jesus has a future over you Hallelujah that's your promise this is serious very serious and Jesus said Watch and Pray so that they don't take you on awars that's why we are privilege to have received a prophet and you must not take it for granted your BR in this message is a privilege it's the grace of God don't take it for granted it makes you humble it makes you cry out it makes you cry say God this is how it should be after 50 years this is what I expect in conventions it has to change we came from I Coast I told the Paul brother get your audience prepared but bam said no matter how the preacher is fished if the audience is not funished nothing happens no matter how the audience is furnished if the preacher is not fished nothing happens look God had always had Moses in his hand but he had to wait for the people to cry Hallelujah he gave them a promise they came to a season the book was open to only a family joed and amam they saw through that book for their day and they knew they are not M doers they took their promise and spend time on God and God sent a deliverer for them them and when God met Moses what did God say he said I have heard the groanings Hallelujah of my people we can't change that that has to be a setting for Dynamics let somebody shout hallelujah that must be a setting for Dynamics all the Pastors in this church in this convention go back home steer up your people because the time is almost late Hallelujah we about going home I don't want to stay here I want to go home the Rapture train is on Hallelujah I'm on my way to the Rapture this is serious if you don't have the Holy Ghost what are you waiting for waiting for some man no man can give you that a man can preach that to you but God gave you a SE on the inside that seed must not begin to cry back to God May me seated God will always respond to a desperate Soul these messages we are meant to bring us all up to a state of desperation because we have had it all we need God on skin we need God on skin but it can't come in this atmosphere no Hallelujah no so don't tell me well but the cont I'm a German you are not a German oh the cont we are Europeans you are not an European the devil lies to you where was thou when the morning start S together and the sons of God shouted for Joy that's where you come from you are not from here so don't you tell me that you are not a German You Came From Heaven Hallelujah you came from there when the seven thought Revival was going on you were there the devil lie to you your identity is misrepresented I am not from Africa oh Hallelujah because I am greater I am bigger than Africa my God my father is the creator of the universe I came from God and I'm going back to God I am not a Nigerian I am not conf from fre I came from God that is Identity the Bible said we are pilgrims and the strangers we are citizens of a higher Kingdom so begin to behave like the country of your rebirth don't behave behave like a German don't behave like a European you are bigger than that glory to God hallelujah I feel so excited tonight I feel God can explode in this place and bless his people let me seated that's right and God must send some minister to call the spirit out National Spirit European Spirit German Spirit African spirit that not who you are God sent you an enter messenger he opened the book and he told you your name is in that Eternal section in that section there is nothing against you in that section you are just like Jesus that's what he told you and he gave you seven Thunders you young people you young people God made no mistake when he called you in this age there is a power in you that can live above your sin listen I told my young folks back home that Satan as we Define who a youth is or I'm a young man so as a young man you must dress immorally because we are still young you see that's how you define who a youth is but God didn't design like that because your strength is in your youth God expect you to even serve him in the days of your youth there's power in the youth but your mindset has to change when you think because I'm young I ought to be do this because I'm young no that's wrong your mindset must change because God made no mistake when he called you at this age God saw you you're on the back part of his mind he knew you shall come into this age he put a seed in you Hallelujah a seed of perfection you shall be perfect in the face of the devil all this evil spirits you shall be perfect you begin to think like that walk like that they be seated Hallelujah listen the B says you can't repent of Adam's sin you can't Paul says if I do the things I hate that's right then Paul say it's no more I that do it but sin that's Adam's sin see you don't repent of unbelief unbelief has to be casted out B says repentance is a change of mind sometimes our mind change but the heart still is not changed because the snake is still there so when you tell a lie your mind changeed and I've told a lie you come and repent of that lie but give yourself few more days you do it again in your mind you are changed but the snake that makes you lie is still there that was Adam's sin that's the adamic nature you can't repent of that you need fire to chase that demon out of your soul oh somebody shout hallelujah explain to you in future home God will send down the fire and the Holy Ghost to to burn that snake inside so you can't say to down just by word you need Holy Ghost Fire to test that demon out and if you're here tonight with a demon in You by the time you live here by the time you live here you're going back free the repentance you make in your mind can be walked out from your heart hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you Jesus many of us are struggling in our minds we repent every day but we still can't stop doing the things we doing because you know why it's a subconscious thing that adamic nature has to be handled by God that means your will is under control of another Power then you need a greater power to deliver you and what we have le in this message Deliverance no Deliverance just word word word but it is coming tonight by the time you live here tonight you're going back as a free brother as a free
