approach your word for this Time Lord this time of prayer and calling upon your name because we don't know what day what hour things will change it wouldn't be a long drawn out thing thing will change overnight as your Prophet prophesied be with us Lord be with us in your word be with your people as they pray in their homes in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen praise God Amen God bless you and welcome I believe that you in the right spot tonight you're in the right place where God has ordained for you and even now tonight in this uh virtual room this virtual prayer room you know it's a nice touch point where we could call upon God and it also give us this space though we not in the same physical place we have an opportunity to have our own closet or to have our own altar right in your home just think this time aside is like having an alter time with God it wouldn't be so much the volume of prayer and you as you will see tonight what you're going to share and read but what is the quality or the condition of your heart in praying to God so tonight I want to get a scripture for you here and this scripture is from 1 Peter 5 5-7 it says likewise the younger submit yourselves unto the Elder ye all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for God resisted the proud and giveth grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he carth for you and I have a little thought here tonight humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God now this scripture in the Amplified reads this way likewise you who are younger and lesser of a lesser rank be subject to the elders the ministers and the spiritual Guides of the church giving them due respect and yielding to the counil clothe or apron yourselves all of you with humility as the G of a servant so that it is covering and cannot possibly be stripped from you with freedom from pride and arrogance towards one another for God sets himself against the proud the insolent the overbearing the disdainful the presumptuous the boastful and he opposes frustrates and defeats them but give Grace favor blessing to the humble therefore hum yourselves demote lower yourselves in your own estimation under the mighty hand of God and in due time he may exalt you casting the whole of your care all your anxieties all your worries all your concerns once and for all on him for he cares for you affectionately and cares about you watchfully I just love how this is phrase he cares for you affectionately and cares for you watchfully what a blessing this word this word of God so we see here that God actually opposes and frustrates and defeats the boastful the presumptuous the proud so it's a real quality to have an attitude of humility and brother bam said this Israel had those experiences Israel come out of Egypt Israel seen signs Miracles wonders all along their Road they had passed through the Red Sea as on dry land they seen Mana full out of Heaven every night they were Witnesses the blessings of God upon their life but then they failed to disobey one of God's Commandments and what happened the blessing cut off from them and they presumed that because God had been so good he's just go on be good but God can't do that and I think we have come to that spot here we go we have come to Kish Bia when God has given the issue of the church to call a halt and back to a prayer life back to consecration back to the spot that we consecrate ourselves away from the things of the world away from our little petty differences among us and get back to God and brotherly love and humility back to the power of God again now we are just presuming that we are running all right because God is blessing note how this is phrased because God is blessing he was blessing Israel probably the same day that they refused to go up there to take the promised land the same day that they disbelieved the spies the Mana fell just the same that night but they were all together out of the will of God they could not win another battle they they come back and make things another battle until they come back and make things right with God and I think it is time for the church to get back to God again get back and get started like it should be going so we can continue our journey listen yet they know God was a good God he was full of Mercy this is a song People start to say God is a good God every time God is a good god right watch he was full of Mercy he had give them Mercy he had shown them his glory even their shoes wasn't wearing out their clothes wasn't getting tread bear Mana was falling from Heaven every night they seen miracles signs and and all along of the presence of God with them yet they presumed that because God had did that that they could go up there and take that mountain here it is when if we want spiritual gifts in the church if we want the power of God the real power of God I tell you brother sister it's so easy for someone to be deceived on that sensation and things the devil can impersonate nearly any Sensation that God has got but you see our church is not moving the way it should move we know there is something wrong and we know then that God here we go will not be with us until we get whatever it is straighten out so it is time to check up see the things that we should do and what things we should not do and then get ready and go ahead praise the Lord amen so I have a couple of scriptures I like to share with you um this one speaks about how to walk humbly with God this is from Mah Micah 68 he had showed the oh man what is good and what that the Lord require of thee but to do justly to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy God so this is a requirement this is what God is instructed that we do just we love mercy and we walk humbling Proverbs 22:4 by humility and the faith of the Lord are riches honor and Life by what humility connected with the fear of the Lord by that there are riches honor and life James 4:10 humble yourselves in the sight of God and he shall lift you up so humbling also means a promotion if you have the ability to humble yourself God going to give you a special a a raise you up in a special way Philippians 2:3 which is a familiar one let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in loneliness of Mind Let each esteem one another better than themselves for to the selfish individuals this is a tough one because you see you burdened about you you concerned about you and in life you can't as a Christian just be caught up in you and and yourself and your own family you have to be concerned about others because even though you think their problems does not affect you and their problems have nothing to do with you you have to be careful you could come back and put some blows on so therefore this word here show that God is encouraging us to consider others more important than ourselves and this is a a real how to say it a real expression of humility because you are valuing others better than yourself praise God 1 Peter 56 humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that's we read that he may exalt you in due time now we know the scripture we have touched on this many times in prayer meeting if my people that second chonicles 7:14 which I call by my name shall humble themselves and pray and I think I struck this before that before you could really pray you have to get in this posture of humility that is what neing does that is what Bo before the Lord does we are not on the same table with him he is God we bow before him we kneel before him we show our dependance upon him and James expressed that in James 46 says he giveth more grace wherever he see God resisted the proud but give it more grace unto the humble submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you so humility is you recognizing your need and you are dependent upon God that's that that's humility you know and um Jesus he was the Bible in Philippians said and being found as a fashion as a man he humbled himself so we are not born humble we're not trained to be humble on the contrary we are trained to be confident to be how they say it um uh uh um uh you know like reflected before you commit there's a statement can't remember the statement right now but there's something like you know you pretend it then until you get it you know you fled until you you become that but here the Bible exal us to have a different kind of mind so Jesus himself he humble himself and become obedient is it that people that are rebellious they don't want to listen they don't want to Humble themselves they don't want nobody talk to them and every time I talk to them I like how you talk to me and all that kind of nonsense is it that is a lack of humility because you as a person and we all there are things that God will rebuke us and straighten us I remember in the early years I used to call the Believers by their Pastor that is this one people so they P him X like ex people this one and this is y people and and and I remember the Lord rebuked me on that rebuked me on that and said do not say that he said these are my people under these men and I changed and I adjusted thinking towards Believers and people from other churches that I see because at that time in the early years was a lot of legalism a lot of walls being built and everything else I couldn't understand the attitudes that these pastors have like if these people are their possession in other words they to me they wasn't seeing themselves as stewards I see that way that we are stewards just like we have our children the children are not ours like if they are designated to us they are St in other words they are place in our hands that we could stay long enough to bring them to that place of maturity so is the church so are the Believers we are stewards of God's people so Jesus he became obedient and his humility is even reflected in his prayer when he says um father if it is possible could you take this cup in other words he not saying I am Jesus are going through I am the word made flesh and I'm pressing on no no no no he wasn't on that beat he genuinely sought to see if this thing could shift somewhat but he acknowledged not my will but thy will be done he didn't pray this once he prayed this three times he submitted to the father's will and he's teaching us how we too must submit to the will of God as opposed to our own will this have nothing to do with brother now because I believe God will speak to you I believe God will deal with you by the scriptures by the word and there are things that God will tell you that you have to come through to obey so therefore you have to be able to humble yourself so I believe that humility is part and parcel of the Cornerstone of a Christian prayer life that you have to be able to humble yourself under the mighty hand of God I believe that the humility is what brings us into a receptive atmosphere and and and and and open us to God's guidance and God's will you know when I came to the Lord as a young Christian I used to believe that God could use anybody so I had an attitude and an ear it doesn't matter if it's a stranger if it's an unbeliever it's somebody wearing earrings pants it doesn't matter sometime I just listen to what they will tell me or say to me and see if it is God using someone to get a message to me and so often it was real it was true and God could use anyone God could use a donkey God could use your neighbor God could use your boss God could use anybody now if you are arrogant and you think that this one can't tell you anything because they are Catholic this one can't tell you because they are this or whatever it is then you are closed in you're not open enough because sometimes we could entertain strangers sometimes God play somebody to walk into your life sometime we so attached to this network of family we keep every keeping everything secret secret secret God can't come into your secrets you could keep your secret and your secret and your secret and you have your own secretive thing God can't work in that because sometime your blessing is not from your own family sometime God ordained your blessing to be out of your familiar Circle that is why some sometimes you have to step out so therefore true humility brings us to a place where we become dependent upon God our attitude of prayer shows we need him and we have to be dependent upon him so I believe that in recognizing where we are limited in recognizing that we don't have all the answers so in other words you can't go and tell God I am the word the spirit and the bright say come the word and I the father one who you talking to who you telling to not not the father because if you come into presence it shows you your condition and that is why isah say w is me so humility is God's way of getting is God's way of us getting the favor of God when we could humble ourselves the Bible said he resist the proud but he give grace to the humble isn't that something there so God Delights in a broken heart Psalms 51:17 the sacrifices of God are broken Spirit a broken and contrite heart oh God thou will not despise is it that because we have been called out a loud thisa is it that we have received a message an end time message that we could go around with a level of arrogance that we are the bride in the absolute sense I think that is something wrong there I think we could have the confidence and the assurance that we are becoming the word and the word will be manifested but we cannot go in the arrogance and and expect God's favor we have to Humble ourselves and this is where this gospel the gospel come to show our unworthiness our sinfulness and um you know our awareness that we need God and that's why conditions come to drive us to the cross and anytime we feel assured that everything is all right and everything is taken care of we could come slack and loose because it come like we are entitled to God blessing we are entitled we not and we don't see we entitled to fight so sometime God is do something to to upset the apple cat to upset your cart to upset your life to drive you into a different direction so if we want to move God it is not the length of our prayer it's not the eloquence of our words it's what's in that heart and I think it could be mistaken but this is an example of that and this is Luke 18 he speak a parable verse 9 watch this is very clear and specific he spake this Parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despite others is very unfortunate that there are people today that think they the bride and they despise others they have no burden no concern they figure they it maybe one extra grain of rice one extra grain of peas one extra car one extra house one extra whatever it is they have extra one piece of stuff things and they figure they're better than somebody else they go further than that they actually despise others and Jesus himself give this Parable and we're going to kind of wrap up Jesus give his Parable and he SP this Parable unto certain with trust in themselves that they were righteous and desp two men went up the temple to pray one was a Pharisee the other was a Publican the Pharisees stood and prayed thus with himself God I thank thee that I am not as the other men are and equal of their sins extortioners unjust adulterers and even as this dude behind you this Publican I fast twice in the week I give Tis of all that I possess and the Publican standing a fou would not lift up as much as his eyes onto heaven so he has a posture he has a attitude he is not you know I don't want people feel a poor I don't want the people feel I don't have nothing um you know um I want to be below I want to be on top he's not in that mode he's not boastful he's not waiting to get the best shoes best pants best whatever to come to church he just stood there head bowed and he smoked upon his breast saying God be merciful to me a sinner this pray is very short that's all you know he pray the Myster of the book and going down there and the trumpets and the vales and and make a swing here with the plagues and and make a dance here and dance he wasn't going all there he said God this is a prayer this here these words here are recognized as a prayer God be merciful to me a sinner Jesus speaks I tell you this man went down to his house justify rather than the other for everyone that exalted himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted so humility is evidence that a heart is aligned to God and that's why brother Brandon says arrogant spirit is not of God want you see arrogance run once you see arrogance you known some problems behind there humil is the channel that God going to use in this last day Humble Hearts true Revelation would make you humble if that is the case why are people still walking around with the with that level of arrogance and pride is only because they lack Revelation because Revelation comes from God and because God has been so good to you and his grace reveal himself to you you want more is not your study your is not your you know is not your effort is is flesh and blood have not revealed it unto you so if in the Supernatural God come and reveal his word to you where you're going with that attitude where you're going with that way so but brandom talk about I'm closing but brandom talk about how a great man make you feel great so a great man don't show off a great man don't uh raise his muscles and say I am great he said when you talk to a great man that man make you feel great there are some people don't make you feel good and actually they want you to feel bad they want to strip you they want to put you in your place they want to put you in your pit they want to put their neck on you but once you stay humble before God God going to bless you and God going to exalt you because Pride listen carefully s always go before fall pride in a heart pride in an individual pride in a church pride in a nation pride in a country always go before a fall Rome had their time Greece had their time Babylon had their time Pharaoh had their time all of them they got proud and puffed up and God cut them down to sides he's the one that bring them through to show who the boss so Pride always go before a in closing humility has to be cultivated the Bible talk about this m humility is not a chance thing it's not like you're get a gift of humility and the brother just go humble you know what the prophet says usually when people get blessed they get proud you say after church get fused and a condition different kind of things next minute the church get staty all time they pray on place they cry outto God they pressing their way but they get Comfort now all the time they fan in it Hur they fan in they get air condition and the air condition cool them down cool them down not physically you know cool them down in spirit they get proud humility has to be cultivated to prayer practicing putting others before yourself look at Abraham God bless Abraham lot come along lot men fighting up with Abraham men wasn't lot on Abraham men fighting up church members caring with the foolishness and Abraham is the one that said L pick choose and let pites T TOS so I want to challenge you tonight the brandham described the seraphin two Wings cover face two wi cover the feet two wings that fly he said the feet part was humility

Thanksgiving thanks again for being here I want to share something with you before we leave I want to share with you how we end up leaving kwall we had built a wooden church and we had real powerful worship times there and we were seeking to expand it so because we were at the bottom of a hill we to dig mud dig area to sort of get the mud out to kind of expand this wooden building the small building we look to expand and the few of us that were there that doing the we were laboring digging out this m and everything else and all of a sudden when the rains come all the labor that we dig and and so on it just caved in now what's something we have an objective we want to do something for the Lord we want to expand we want to add to but when I saw it caved in I said no let's stop right here I felt led to say let's stop it and I want you to take note sometime you be doing something and you feel blessed with it and you want to do something else but if there are certain hindrances we have to be sensitive enough to know if there's a green light or a red light and I took that caveen in as a red light and I said stop we are not going any further with this we not adding to this we are stopping right here and I did that and right after doing that then the voice of God spoke that I'll been sand Grande and the rest is history so sometimes in our sincerity to do things for God or add or do this or whatever you want to do we still have to be careful that when you see opposition or hindrances come it doesn't be like the devil the devil the devil we have to be able to be Discerning to know if it's God given a red light and say stop because I have something else for you stop because I want to promote you or guide you or direct you or is to go on so let's bow our heads as we want to close in prayer again father God I thank you for this time with your people and I pray that you would deal with their hearts but that's what you're looking at no not much your words with your mouths but what what beats in their heart God may we be filled with the right motive and objective with your own desire father tonight we spoke about humility you resist the proud but give grace to the humble may we be known for that give us a humble heart a humble Spirit may we cultivate maybe grow this thing called the Garment of humility like an apron to wear it to be clothed with humility looking after each other looking out for one another and preferring one another bless your people father with peace with a good night's rest and bless us this coming Sunday in Jesus name I ask it amen and am God bless you thanks again for being here we appreciate and love you all God bless
