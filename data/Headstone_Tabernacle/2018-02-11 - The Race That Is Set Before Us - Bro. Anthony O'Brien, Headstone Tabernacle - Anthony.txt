your service hallelujah this is your time this is your season is in your service you come here to be blessed and you would be blessed you come to a breakthrough and you're gonna get a breakthrough you can either get a word from the Lord and you're gonna wait on the Lord this morning oh praise the Lord amen oh praise God I appreciate the message last week but I Zack the identification of the true worshipers amen and amen praise God I'm not the speaker this morning but I'm sitting on the blessing this morning with the word depreciable Anthony oh my praise God I love what God has done I love what God is doing on what he will do praise God this is the time to have great expectation this is the time to go beyond your feelings and your emotions and what you think on your limit this is that time if it's ever a time to go pass you is now the home I'd only limit to your past no limit to what happened in the past what happened last year forget all of that God promised greetings among his people all praise be to Jesus I want to bring this at a time with what was spoken last week but a Branum infusion to change as Daniel who the seven thunders and were forbidden and John Wesley the voices and the book was sealed and the back of the book was sealed with seven seals but in the days of these seems to be open the mystery of God will be finished in other words God yeah we would be known to his church his church not in three people but as one person the mystery of God would be reveal and when that was completely revealed then the seven mysteries would be open to the church which he's talked about the seven thunders because in the air the church here we go would be living under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit him moving in and out and showing his signs of being alive and among us living among us there we are worship in the living Christ that's among us so this worship atmosphere is a prophecy that is to come then you will be worshiping the Living Christ you're not worshiping because this song leaders here raise your hands and give Him praise and yet know you're know giving praise I give Him glory that coming from Sonia in Erbil where all this worship them come from but a Branham here you go again he said no watch the revelation at the fifth chapter 8 the 14 verse reveals the time for the lamb to be worshipped but in heaven and in earth the seven see book the wooden lamb the kinsman redeemer no dins it verse to the 14th verse angels worship Him elders worship him living creatures worship Him John worship him so much till he said every creature in heaven and in earth underneath heard me saying blessing and glory and power and wisdom and might be to the lamb he said a worship time of the king lamb so that's another prophecy there's coming a worship time for the king lamb and we not wait until them restarting all now because that's what making your God there's gonna be a time of worship not just intellectually hearing a message but getting in the spirit you could always hear about the tape and did your notes but when you come here you're from in the worship the committed expression lost to God you come into creates an atmosphere that is what you come here for oh praise God gave my shell people one time brother man and when Xin xao meet him he didn't have to preach he just walked into the meeting under crippled standard come on the wheelchair the scrip has had to walk the blinds had a seat he said the angel of the Lord was present he said it was the atmosphere he didn't have to say a word he walked into the meeting and just began to be heal the pain begin to see the Clipper began to walk why because at Mercer was there so when you come to church you come to create an atmosphere he has come to sit down and your intellect wondering what the preacher gonna say and who want to speak forget that talking to speak bother to move upon whoever comes behind you because we have an atmosphere you supposed to know that by now or get a lot of shy in the house behind us puppet of an atmosphere anybody come behind here they'd shop into an atmosphere that the Holy Spirit could speak Oh glory to God hallelujah hey that song again hallelujah praise crawl abundantly come to bless us worship he's all I need he's all I need listen friends our guns will get you nowhere being proud and arrogant will get you nowhere if there's ever a time to humble before God is now we play that in his presence communion service the purpose of that message was to show you that when anybody gets in the presence of God truly they only could see themself as nothing as nobody nobody could come in the presence of God and walk or proud and walk all know it all and they'll be better than thou nobody can stop that John fellows one dead all those prophets woe is me every one of them even brother Branham stuff in a corner somewhere he said you don't know what the power of God is that real presence of God we not or Bubba dancin shouting singing and we're not talking about that we're talking about real presence have one effect upon God's people real presence have one effect friends confess your need today we are needy people we are the most needy people on the earth Jesus I need you I love you I want more of you father Oh hallelujah but auntie come to us he's all I need [Music] he's all [Music] I mean [Music] Oh I need oh Jesus these are [Music] oh well he is on he's our for Jesus here's our one more time she's all hiding yes Jesus Jesus is all [Music] oh I might have any money he is all my fancy things but yes all Oh

this morning he's the rock of our salvation oh my gosh almighty tower oh I'm in your presence there God hide us in a secret place [Music] whoa geez I [Applause] hey man give him a hand a pre-war a beetle gone hallelujah thank you Lord you love him this morning yeah happy to be in a house on the lawn this morning a many many men hallelujah are you on the expectation for what the Lord will do for us this morning praise be to the holy name of the Living God amen amen so that further ado I might like to turn our attention to the word this morning thank you musicians a man and really mighty song service this morning a man sitting on a thank God for that amen god bless you on the Internet praise God pray the Holy Spirit be upon you now we want to turn over to Hebrews chapter 12 and we just want to read the first two verses there a man he was chapter 12 reading from 1 reading 1 and 2 wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God go on a blessing to universally let's just bow heads one more time Heavenly Father Lord it's such a privilege our honor to be in your house to be called the sons of God to hear your voice speak to us in these last days long where there's so much evil in the world Lord father and the world turning more into a condition like it was spoken that would happen but Lord we pray this morning Lord that as your will Ezri reveal to us Lord that you would Lord open play need a vision Lord father Lord that we may Lord run into it Lord father Lord we Lord we look to you Lord father I set upon new law there's nothing in this world that we desire no more Lord Father but soon as we would see Jesus Lord give us grace to stand Lord farlen want me anointing dropped on this morning especially anoint Lord Father the word Lord only you could annoy your word father Lord we pray that you lift up every heart every soul Lord may our so inspire every brother every believer here this morning that they may be able to believe you for anything granted Almighty God we pray and ask it's happy waiting this morning in Jesus name Amen any man you may have a seat sprees e men an e man well praise God 11:00 this morning hey man I have a title my title is the race that is set before us the race that is set before us and we took that straight out of Hebrews 12:1 we just read a few moments ago and in this scripture Paul speaks about a race that is set before us and in other words it's a it's a it's a future tense it's a future race he's speaking at it of it as it's a race that is yet to be run a race that is yet to be in Devon isn't all right it's all right it's a race towards a goal it's a race towards a purpose it's a race to what something that is set before you isn't that right you see something in front of you and it is what wakes you up in the morning it is what inspires you and we all have a race to run this morning we all have something to achieve that's why we're here this morning there's a purpose while we're here this morning there's something we're trying to get to a man is not a natural race as natural men run racists but it is a race that spiritually speaking that we have to run and endure and go beyond ourselves go beyond our human limits go beyond our thoughts go beyond our feelings and see a vision that is greater than you and I a vision that is Jesus Christ the same yesterday the same today the same forever isn't that right so we're just gonna talk about this contact scripture before we get into it so he says wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses and just in that previous scripture there Hebrews 11 he was talking about heroes of fate that's that cloud of witnesses and all those heroes of faith who fought beyond measure who fought beyond themselves the Bible talks about how Abram offered a more excellent sacrifice than Cain his fate showed him a vision that was greater than what King saw and grow except an evil sacrifice Oh Holly and we're here to offer a sacrifice of praise this morning and a sacrifice of worship unto the Lord we know who we worship we know what we worship or we believe in this morning supid isakova name and I believe last week and that message talking about worship is now hallelujah amen so we know who we worship this morning we had a worship gone this spirit and in truth isn't that right Holly and all this great cloud of witnesses and the Bible went on expressly talking about Abraham how he staggered not to unbelief holid but was strong in fate giving praise to God despite the unbelief despite the situation this Mike what he saw he press toward the mark was prescient - what a cool he had his race to run it might have took 25 years but I made it over Oh hallelujah hallelujah is now right he's now right and Joshua and Caleb and Kitty on on all these heroes of fate this great cloud of witnesses that the Bible talks about it's turning over the balance of time they are cheering on the bride this evening because the Bible says here without us are not made perfect so even though they wander and test chesta to turn afflicted and they were tormented and they wonder is sheepskins and goatskins and oh they were sawn asunder there was slim with the edge of the sword this gospel this morning it's dripping with blood those same cloud of witnesses some of them will be headed some of them are their heads cut off but they were fighting for something they believed in something officinalis greater than human creature in me it was greater than their own lives they keep the old bodies to be punched oh holiday counted as nothing ojala but to seek the riches of Christ oh that's how I feel this morning I feel fully persuaded that no life no principality no power or I could ever come between me and the love of Almighty God God loves you this morning he put you in a price for he died for you on Calvary's tree I got a right to shout i got a right to praise car Oh keep the Lord a shout of pain hey man hallelujah this great cloud of witnesses is looking at you this morning to see what you're gonna do with the word this great cloud of witnesses this morning halleluyah halleluyah is my right seven angels come down from eternity another dimension we reason to step in but they're waiting on you and I because D without us is not made perfect on this thing come on come on you can make it come on you can overcome come on you can get the Holy Ghost come on you can press come on you can pray come on you can do better come on you can come on you can be harder you can be stronger oh you've got it in you don't you know what you've got inside you but the perfection is we're gonna come out free put your knowledge waiting to come out come out I'm just gonna take my time this morning master [Applause] we can pass about with such a cloud of witnesses no that's what I love about the Bible it's a it's a book of reality of real people people like you and I man with like actions men who have faults men who are failures many watch shortcomings everybody wasn't perfect but it all did what God told him to do they all came praise God just as God's ethic that come God put something inside of them to press beyond themselves hallelujah they're human beings they weren't some kind of a immortal angel or something they were honey in flesh and blood like you and I had struggles like you and I had back pain and misery and oh hi like the happiness sometimes but their brightest sometimes but they made it over and I ought to be encouragement to you this morning you're gonna make it over Oh hallelujah he laughs at his time and just right this time this is our time now what you gonna do with the world I presented to you it wasn't made plain to them like it's being made plain now we got a responsibility so much is given much is expected you can't kind of get up out of your seat and you gotta catch just words Oh for the world apart in this season Oh hallelujah hallelujah because he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him are you diligently seeking in this morning are you telling ugly seeking him this morning oh you contend to just sit around abraham couldn't just sit around he had to wait for isaac he had to earnestly contend for lunacy contend Irina's and as we can tell what are you gonna do this morning Ruta for Wesley for what are you gonna do this morning but a panel thought he lost his wife he lost his child he cried oh he went to pain he went to sorrow but he said the Lord and the Lord shaking away you're gonna make it over this morning Oh Oh hallelujah we are more than conquerors this morning oh honey you gotta believe that in your heart I don't care what your flesh tell you I don't care what your mind tell you but in your spirit in my spirit I feel this morning Oh Mountain is going to be moved oh you got to speak it until it happen you got a prophesy until it take place [Applause] [Music] let's hide every weight don't let nothing hinder you let's hide everything that so easily beset you somebody must you're caught you get upset late out of sign holiday everything that was so easily moving out of your mind I let get it very clear this morning a picture of what God is trying to present to you hallelujah because if you can get into that kind of a condition then you're ready to run then you're ready to run this race that is set before us are we going to talk about any man he said and let's lay aside every weight that so easily be sentence let's run with patience the race I love that he prefers the race with patients because they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint but didn't wait upon the Lord or there's power in waiting there's power in resting on his promises this morning Oh make us await on you Lord Jesus oh don't you want to be that kind of Christian looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy was set before him endured the cross the cross set before him a vision hallelujah this was his path to fulfill to be sacrificed to die to give his life his knowledge to see the whole world war haunted to see her fallen creation that was his commission and Jesus flawlessly defeated the devil it is written it is written it is also written he chopped the devil ribbons he ran his race he overcome every tactic every test every trial is now hallelujah oh my and it sat down at the right hand of the throne of God he overcame his race I know we've got a race to run isn't that right a man and I have a few context scriptures but email I get teaching time here but I want to just talk about a race he's saying a natural race is a competition it's a contest normally it's a contest of speed who's the fastest who can get there first who's the fastest person who's the fastest cyclist who's the fastest motorist or you know car driving or whatever type of contest it is most of the times is about who can get there first but I love what the Bible said in eClass Ecclesiastes chapter 9 verse 11 here it says I returned and saw Under the Sun that the race is not to the Swift nor the battle to the strong neither yet bread to the wise nor yet riches to men of understanding so what is the Bible trying to say here it's not about who get there first or who faster on who or who more powerful and who the prize in two people to cross the finish line the prize is to be able to make it over to meet God's requirements to do what God said it's a spiritual race and I love that because it changes the tone of the race it's not about trying to cut down this brother to reach first it's not trying to about cutting down this sister to get there first but we all better come to the unity of the faith we all gotta come to the knowledge of the Son of God we all gotta forgive we all gotta pray for one another because if somebody's stumbling we can reach down and help that brother I say come on brother even if we go to limp we're gonna make it over we gotta make it over together we're gonna play on this one on that one no electone persecute elect that's not the atmosphere that's not the spirit to be in we're gonna be tested on brotherly kindness all right now the atmospheres alright for you to express your brotherly kindness you gotta go to this one and say I love you brother I forgive you brother oh it's got to be real it's got to be genuine it's got to be God - in it it can't be not put on feathers you got to be a really only Eagle saw only into the unknown and go beyond the limits o God likens is believing children a son - Eagles do I use this morning reject upon yard reject the quarreling and a confusion forgive love repent do the right thing and pray for your brother that the grace that was extended to you may be extended to him also [Applause] that's Christianity that's what the Prophet fought for and by all means will fight for it too because we see they are coming up the road Oh hallelujah it's time to dance it's time to shout it's time to lay aside every weight and run the race with patience [Applause] blue ray it's God forgive me then why can't I forgive you what can I pray for you why can't I love you too God love me I love you too price clock he wants you to make it Oh hallelujah gonna make it this morning oh let the devil tell you otherwise glory of God Amen praise be to the name of the Lord amen oh that's what the race is see him that overcometh him not overcoming even if you're the last one in brother you made it even if he lost one man even if you come and limp in like there was a long distance rather runner who think Terramax hold on what was in this African guy who can't remember but he come in limping the race was already over everybody else packing up the water and Here Come this man running in the crowd be gonna get ecstatic they be gonna get excited if we gonna chairman I said come on you can make it come on you can make it and we're swing sirens to see this my limping coming in he's coming in I might have made a lot but my name is on the scoresheet I might be last but I didn't come in for nothing I want to be on that score sheet and I want to make it over don't you wanna make it over this morning I don't care the tables after me you run for your life Oh hallelujah you're gonna make it you got to make it rabbit rabbit it you can make it gotta make it brother Oh hallelujah Oh give him a shot of praise [Applause] you're gonna write your name in those stars my god alright anyhow so that's what a race is now there's what I broke down to be three different phases of the race and the first two parts of this race is really the preparation phase right so the first part of a race is really preparation because nobody wakes up in the morning and wins the race yeah there's something missing in that equation zero doesn't equal a hundred remember it's even got to do your mats over so you've got to be prepared in order to run a race all right and the first part of preparation I did a little research on it I'm not a fantastic runner but there's a lot of information online so I did some research and what they were talking about it I wonder first part they talked about was mental preparation and he said I don't read this quick here yep you see they say you have to learn to visualize learn to visualize it's actually called visualization he said now all professional athletes do it he said you can picture yourself performing specific movements perfectly in your mind's eye he said you will often see skills going through the course in their head and as you're talking about it I began to realize it's true you see them standing there with a goggles on chewing gum looking at the course trying to get it right in their minds first he said you have to get any ahead first and visualizing every movement that they will make he said you can also use this technique in your running imagine certain situations like your legs getting heavy on how you will overcome the problem by running tall and keeping your strife short and quick or you're running neck-and-neck with someone and lengthening by your stride you could pull ahead of that person he said it's sometimes easier to deal with situations if you have experienced them once before so what that does is that the challenge now becomes easier because it's like you experienced it once before so it's almost like you're doing it twice but the first time you're doing it in your mind he said now he said running really does take place in your mind and he said after that it's just time to do it on the road so before you can run you have to know what you're running for and now you have to see yourself victorious before you could even get started you have to visualize yourself winning before you could win you have to see yourself overcoming you have to see yourself perfected you have to see yourself a top 10 you have to see yourself making it you have to see yourself receiving the Holy Ghost you have to see yourself over calling this devil and that evam and back never you have to see yourself praying and conquer in brain and conquer and pray in a concrete you ain't even to it yet before Jesus was on the cross he was there crawling on travail in her tongue and Kemeny saying it's called hallelujah let his cup pass from me he had to overcome first on his knees before he became a champion on the cross and that's what every believer has to do this morning overcome right there I love you and God get face-to-face with your reality get face-to-face of your own mortality I'm saying

what the vision of God requires that's what the vision of God helps us to do to see what what God has required of us to see what is necessary to overcome isn't that right how about cocteau says the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that read it the purpose of writing the vision the purpose of making it plain was that you and I could have something to do we cannot run if we cannot read it we kind of run if it wasn't made plain to us but the gospel has been made plain to us in a time when it never was before we have a full understanding of who we are who God is and who the devil is and now that we understand the vision brother this morning it's time to run Oh put on your running shoes this morning we ready to get out of here this

called him in and said your next matches this guy this guy's a killer last report we had was that he hit somebody in the head their brain dislodged and they felt that in the ring so they play back the tape with the last match where they killed this guy and the manager was trying to discourage him and tell him you really should think about this before you go in there and the guy looked at him looking at the tape and he began to watch the tape all of a sudden he told the manager stop the tape play it back Marvin said that's gruesome why you want to look at that for the contenders had tough to stop the tape playback and he stopped the tape when he played it back and they stopped the tape when he played it back he stopped it played it back stopped it played it back stopped it played it back until something clicking until the boxer saw a special move but the guy was doing just before he goes for the death punch there's a special move that he does and the boxer was now armed with knowledge of what he had to do this guy got into training because he knew what he had to do he caught a vision of what was necessary in order to win the match he told his manager I'm going in the ring

said but if your body's used to taking that hit and then coming back he said every time you hit it that shocks the blood runs it back to the heart see said if you do that said then your body is used to coming back quick said when you get knocked down brother branham snaps his fingers he said you're on your feet again see you get knocked down you're on your feet again hallelujah because the use of taking that hit oh don't let the devil knock you down get back up again that's what the training is for halleluyah halleluyah that's like God let you fall sometimes that's a good let's you think I hit

into preparation for what's to come it's not right Jesus himself had to learn obedience but it thinks he suffered another obedience put him in subjection to what was the calm the cross to take the burden of the cross he had to go to the test of obedience eighteen years of trials three and a half years harder trials what's he doing Karen ready for what is before him when it was before him he set his eyes to what Teresa lot he said his eyes so what was before him he said his face so what was in front of him there was no more running there was no more catching around its purpose now he was ready to do what was required he saw the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men but in three days I'm gonna make it over in three days I will overcome and treaty destroy this temple and I myself will raise it up again though he was a son of mat God he made himself hallelujah subject his own word and he might fulfill it for our sakes he might fulfil it for your sakes John told him he should baptize me said no but to fulfill all things he suffered himself to be baptized of John and downcome the Spirit of God what was the next step lead him into the wilderness lead him into the snakes and scorpions lead him into the place where he didn't want to go but not my will Lord I will be done nobody likes the wilderness but God had a purpose God had a mission and Jesus put himself under subjection he didn't eat meat he was hungry 40 days fasting in the wilderness and the barren lands where there was no water no inspiration nobody to shy on and say Amen brother no voices just silence in the desert that's him on the tumbleweed and God's Word waiting there in the silence isn't all right until God speaks he got to wait until God speaks to your heart you gotta wait he can't run off with your own interpretation you can't run off with your own ideas your own feelings your emotions you got to stay there long enough until that part of you dies you gotta stay there long

but also he had to learn how to protect God's sheep he had to catch that picture in his mind and so God taught him through the shepherd way how to look out for he called sheep and that came not being one time it's not and he slew him with the same sling and they come not lying there next time and he slew him also is not hallelujah hallelujah and Pavin knew there was God I was with him in those experiences it was close I was with him that helped him slain a lion the prophet described it he's how could a 70 80 pawn boy fight a 500-pound lion he said I wasn't David it was caught I was with David he said it was caught I wasn't with David when he fought the bear when he fought the lion and David knew the God hallelujah the unseen God of power you can't even knew that when you are on the right Road God will back you up David knew that when you have the people of God and a heart for the people of God if your true servant of God then back up hallelujah hallelujah that modus operandi with his power with his glory because Yamaha for God's people Oh hallelujah but herb and I'm sad I prefer your love one of my children and love me it's not right he said I prefer you love my son Billy here before you put him not treat him real nice and he said if I feel that way how much more God feel that way you could understand now why go to so upset when Goliath was there ranting and raving send me a man to fight me parading over God's people but reading over God's sheep parading over God's flocks oh ha I went a bit saw that picture something just rubbed him the wrong way that morning it just rubbed him wrong he said who is this circumcised felons time or define the armies of the Living God there's something wrong with this picture the devil is not supposed to reign over God's people God is supposed to reign over God's people who is that hallelujah there might be something wrong with your picture this morning maybe the devil's got you battered maybe the devil's got you bruised but the Ministry of Jesus is here that David is on the scene this morning we come to knock his head off hallelujah hallelujah devil have no right over you no right over your children no right over your home no right over a life for your family he has no right to be where he is we shall reign on the earth not him and we come to take it back Satan we come to take back all joy we're gonna take back or love or peace or long-suffering gentleness meekness kindness Oh take back everything that the devil stole from you if he stole your children take her back if he stole your joy take her back David shall restore unto me the joy of my salvation oh he can restore your joy this morning he can restore your love your peace oh my there on the backside of the desert people it ought to be a shepherd it's not right oh my okay I'll move on God called man prophet said we hit it's crying or radio in different places and coming from sincere hearts Lord give us revival in our time and from letters from Christians around the world we hear that cry and it does something to your heart it's inspiring it's uplifting it's quickening to the soul to hear the people to the Lord call for revival and God has made a promise if the people called by my name shall assemble themselves together and pray then I'll hear from heaven and so we tonight want to think on that and remember that in the midst of all this cry God cannot send a revival until he's got men in shape to take it we cannot have a revival until we get men God called men not man call men but God call men quatrain that's not trained up in the schools of theology and of education but rugged men of faith that Court has brought up in the school of his rugged training Oh God has his own school a school of rugged training Oh hallelujah hallelujah it's not an easy road Oh hallelujah but its glorius men were not afraid to face the fire men who come in the presence of God and knows his power knows his omnipotence and knows his healing power some men that's trained to know the Living God it's alright to train them by the word let let it kill it but the spirit giveth life and he said before we can have this revival God has called out and trained men God trained me to carry this message and they don't care what the opposition is they are willing to go to the fiery furnace in defeat what are the lions then or wherever it may be they're ready to go because they've been in the presence of God and they know that he is whether it's the victory or defeat they'll stand the same or will you stand the same this morning don't you want to be God trained when you know him in a resurrection of his power the talk skies are not sign of his approval the sunshine is not sign of his approval but his approval is your acceptance in the beloved and he could take you to the fire he could take it to the test he could take you to the sorrow he could take you to the pain he could take you to those moments of uncertainty but yet in my flesh shall I see God you got a promise down the road and nothing's gonna stir you nothing's gonna take your eye off the prize [Applause] yeah oh that's how we got to be isn't there right oh my that's the kind of training God does to men and it's very strange to think that God would do that that got trains men like that but he does you know we have an old song we sing some through the waters and some through the flow some through deep trials but all through the blood God leads his people through great trials to purge them hallelujah cut you to prune you eat up bring forth fruit I'll cut you to bring forth more fruit I put you to bring forth much food Clippy and clip it in what's he doing cutting off the world offer you cutting off all those things that hinder the flow of God in your life and you're getting more like God and that's like the world you begin to resemble that tree that is planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth fruit in his season whose leaves also shall not wither and whatever you do will prosper that's the kind of man God loves God told Joshua meditate on the world day and night that you might have good success or stay in the presence if you abide in me and I abide in you you can ask whatever you will because you have a relationship with the father ask anything in my name go to put his hand up on you wherever you are turn left turn right there's a sister that he's praying for there's a brother that needs bran form [Applause] huh isn't that right that's the kind of church they had back in Ephesus one time Paul needed prayin for God sent a man named Ananias what if I known I wasn't led by the spirit what if he was doing his own thing he would have been led of God to help the servant of God come into a place where he could empower others and minister to others he himself at that time needed somebody to pray for him and no matter how little you might feel your ministry is it plays a very important role in the script of God's play in the script of God's drama holily as small as amen amen Ananias his rule was as small as Tywin who carried across it was it small roles homonyms hurry not much at all about him in the Bible but this one role he had this one party had to play what's the help Jesus carry his cross this little man Oh hallelujah hallelujah but he did what God had him to do he was in the right place he was in the right time I don't care how little you might feel I don't care how low you might feel I don't care how worthless you feel your prayers it is doing something keep praying don't let the devil pull you down don't let him discourage you you keep praying mother you keep praying father you are adding to the revival you keep praying Caleb you keep praying young person you are adding to the revival you're filling up your vial with prayer with the oldest of the saints Oh make a deposit this morning make a contribution and prayer seeking alone so what goes about to do Oh hallelujah he said I'm a reward Oh behold I come quickly and my reward is said every man according as his work shall be he amens that right you put in the work God reward you holily it's not man sometime man don't see the work but God sees every little thing you do what's these when you have a right attitude what's this man you should have taken the money and he decided no I'm not taking it God knows every little thing don't you worry about it God knows when you make a right decision when you make a right choice Oh hallelujah hallelujah he'll reward you amen amen Oh huh now okay God leaves him true power to purge them that's right that's where I was he said sometimes it takes he has to do it and as for myself tonight his prophet speaking for himself he says I believe that right now God is training such men to meet the frontline men who are going through and time shook from their feet sometimes looked like the whole thing is falling apart but yet in the midst of it all they know that Living God and they keep their face forward and they keep moving on amen amen hallelujah hallelujah all right so we got the part three now a man thing more times coming to maturity the actual race itself all that does it bring it to this point so we don't have got a word of God it is a race to be won and we order all at the starting line this morning and it takes dynamics to run this race it takes dynamics to stop this race hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so you can't claim anything else until the dynamics Falls Oh hallelujah glory be to God glory be to God so let us lay aside every weight and every sin that thought easily beset us you cannot run this race heavy and weighed down by the sins of this world you got to lay aside every weight lay aside everything that keeps you back and hinders the flow of God in your life switch your hearts are smaller and see if there be any evil in you let God take it out this morning God the great Surgeon General has his way of not what's not of you what's not of God and giving you what you need putting it in your heart giving you the right motive the right objectives the right purpose the right desire if you want to first this morning for the Holy Ghost say Lord created me I first created me a hunger create in me a clean heart Oh hallelujah purify me purify my soul purify my heart make me ready make me willing make me a more fit servants how many wanna be fit servants this morning Oh Oh God's gonna give you something so that you could flow out others flow out other people or that you could love extend to others extend to your family extend to your loved ones extend to your children that they could see Jesus flowing out of your skin flowing out of your life flowing out of your hearts every word you speak a fulfillment of prophecy Oh wherever you walk or the devil is shaken because it sees a scientific holy life thundering out in simplest and humility speak any harm thing an evil thing against him just as sweet oh that's the kind of brag God once in his last day that's a bright Buffett talked about that's a bright Esau marching interview running across that finish line a pure bride a bride marching in step marching on to glory Oh hallelujah hallelujah pimples and falling all right side I shall not be moved Oh God shall help and that rightly a merry man oh my race is not for the Swift nor the battle to the strong it's not a based on speed based on human merit human ability no it's about enduring it's about persevering it's about going all the way Elijah couldn't stop a gilga you couldn't stop at better though the Prophet himself said stay here pull him steer here this would be good for you the Prophet said you had not enough schooling yet stay and get a little education but he likes I said no as long as I saw a lever I will not
