[52:48] and would support him and he with me
[53:02] may God bless his word you may be seated
[53:07] it's always a blessing to be
[53:09] in the house of God
[53:12] where we can get strength
[53:14] all your Victory all your britual and
[53:16] deliverance comes from the word of God
[53:19] there is no philosopher there is no
[53:21] writer there is no author there is no
[53:23] one could bring give you that
[53:25] breakthrough outside of this Gospel of
[53:27] Jesus Christ
[53:27] [Music]
[53:30] so last service I believe it was we
[53:32] speak about uh uh if uh uh the whole I
[53:35] started or knock I want to go a little
[53:37] further today I have a title here hear
[53:39] my voice and open the door
[53:42] I said I'll hear my voice
[53:45] and open the door
[53:48] and this is for any man
[53:50] whosoever will
[53:52] this you only hear Jesus outside the
[53:54] church
[53:55] outside and he's knocking
[53:58] yeah
[53:59] you can't barge in him itself in he
[54:01] can't force himself you know he can't
[54:03] save you against your will
[54:05] he can't heal you against your will he
[54:08] can deliver you against your will if you
[54:10] want to be how you are you could see as
[54:11] you are but if you want to be changed
[54:14] you have a decision to make
[54:17] I don't want this kind of like I want a
[54:18] different life I want to change
[54:20] then if you knock the doors on the
[54:22] inside you open the door and let him in
[54:25] and something could happen I will
[54:26] support you
[54:28] nobody come knocking on your door with
[54:29] nothing to tell you at this recent time
[54:31] knocking and running away they knock
[54:33] because they have a message for you
[54:34] they're not because they want to say
[54:36] something to you they're not because
[54:38] they have something to give you that's
[54:39] why they knock
[54:41] and Jesus is a gentleman
[54:43] he's embossing on nobody door to go in
[54:45] you have to open the door
[54:47] and that is why in church have all types
[54:51] some of Jesus outside some of Jesus were
[54:53] questioning wrong songs yesterday in the
[54:55] porch and have all types inside of here
[54:57] because you are a free moral agent
[55:00] and God put you on the earth in the same
[55:02] basis he put Adam and Eve no something
[55:05] struck me and I hope it strike you today
[55:07] what's the sense giving somebody free
[55:10] choice and they have no choice
[55:14] if God wanted he could have put Adam and
[55:16] Eve and tell them eat everything
[55:22] and all also we wasn't going to be here
[55:25] this morning
[55:26] no sickness no disease no death nothing
[55:28] at all but he put them with the ability
[55:31] to make choices
[55:33] here it is God said let us make man in
[55:35] our image and likeness but he can make
[55:36] them robots like they like zombies yes
[55:38] right yes right you know
[55:45] you have to choose
[55:47] whether you want to serve God or not
[55:52] so in the Garden of Eden because he set
[55:54] up man this way with free choice
[56:00] because there's no mandatory soil so if
[56:03] you want to talk you talk come back on
[56:05] your husband at home he could have said
[56:07] that and she should have said that but
[56:09] she engaged in conversation herself
[56:11] because she wanted it that was a choice
[56:14] go tell them every tree you eat all the
[56:16] heavier tree but that tree name is don't
[56:18] touch it because the day you eat that
[56:20] day you die
[56:21] that's why we are funeral services
[56:22] that's what we have heartaches that's
[56:24] why we have tears that's what we have
[56:26] here green and all kind of sicknesses
[56:28] and so on because somebody this this
[56:31] disobey God's word
[56:33] and if we get back to God's word we're
[56:35] going to bless us you're going to bless
[56:37] her going out you're gonna bless her
[56:38] coming in he said blessed is a man that
[56:41] walketh not in the Council of them Godly
[56:42] not stand in the way of Sinners nor sit
[56:45] in the seat of this cornful but is the
[56:48] light is in the law of the Lord and in
[56:50] that Lord God he meditate day and night
[56:51] he shall be like a tree planted by
[56:55] rivers of water whatsoever he do is
[56:57] shall prosper or give the Lord some
[56:59] shouts inside of here this is God
[57:01] blessing to you this is God promised to
[57:04] you David says himself I've never seen
[57:06] the righteous forsaken you have to
[57:08] believe you are the Righteous seed on
[57:10] Earth God himself call you no man could
[57:12] come and set the father draw him God has
[57:15] to call you
[57:17] Oh Glory to God I was a filthy dirty
[57:19] sinner but God called me I heard a
[57:21] knocking in my heart and I answered the
[57:23] call and I'm still here Satan I'm still
[57:27] here okay the Lord some Praises Oh Glory
[57:30] to God hallelujah praise God and David
[57:32] said it boldly though I walk to the
[57:34] Valley of the shadow of the attacks
[57:36] shall fear no evil for thou art Whitney
[57:38] thyroid and staff they comfort me
[57:40] forgive the Lord some Praises David said
[57:43] don't ten thousand follow my right side
[57:45] I shall not be moved Give the Lord I
[57:48] shout God is for you this morning
[57:51] [Applause]
[57:54] Glory
[57:54] [Applause]
[57:58] [Music]
[58:00] so you have five senses of the flesh see
[58:03] they smell feel and touch and five
[58:05] senses of the spirit conscience
[58:07] imagination affection reasoning and so
[58:09] on
[58:10] but it has nothing to do with the sick
[58:12] sense of fate
[58:13] that God put on seed inside of you
[58:17] Hallelujah so God put every man and
[58:19] woman
[58:20] and I love it because God know the
[58:23] choices we would make
[58:26] so that's why you can make all things
[58:28] work together for good
[58:29] when you're beating pan smoking drinking
[58:31] carrying on and drinking and whatnot God
[58:33] knew you'll become out of that
[58:35] God knows Satan could only hold you so
[58:36] much and no more
[58:38] because you had to come to your senses
[58:40] do you understand what I'm saying that
[58:42] prodigal son backstage and holy money
[58:44] run out he didn't pick food he came to
[58:45] and says you know he came to himself he

[59:42] permission to interfere with your life

[1:00:01] with you
[1:00:02] oh give the Lord some Praises we've got
[1:00:05] to know who we are we got to know who's
[1:00:07] we are
[1:00:10] foreign
[1:00:13] [Applause]
[1:00:14] you're a free moral agent to act any way
[1:00:17] you wish to
[1:00:19] and none of these other senses have
[1:00:21] anything to do with it neither Soul
[1:00:22] nobody
[1:00:24] it's through the spirit on self-will
[1:00:28] so even Jesus knowing he was born to die
[1:00:32] when he came to Calvary let me switch
[1:00:35] back when he came to Gethsemane what did
[1:00:37] he pray he said if it is possible
[1:00:41] foreign
[1:00:47] you don't run to that he said if it is
[1:00:50] possible let this come pass
[1:00:53] but if not nevertheless not my will
[1:00:57] but thy will be done
[1:00:59] do you see that's a debt to Will
[1:01:03] do you see that you have your own will
[1:01:05] and sometimes your mother say don't do
[1:01:06] it somebody said do it and you do it

[1:01:19] desire to come unto Egypt for two how
[1:01:22] much years then bondage Pharaoh beating
[1:01:24] them the building bricks and have a
[1:01:26] desire to get a deliverer and when they
[1:01:28] cry unto God and they begin to call and
[1:01:30] seek the Lord God told Moses I heard the
[1:01:33] Cry of my people and I come down to
[1:01:36] deliver and when you're ready to get
[1:01:37] Deliverance she goes out of cry you
[1:01:39] ain't gonna sit down on your sin you
[1:01:41] wouldn't sit down in your unbelief they
[1:01:43] wouldn't sit down in your condition and
[1:01:45] more open some God smile on you if they
[1:01:48] work and show you have to repent Oh
[1:01:50] Glory to God that's the message of John
[1:01:52] the Baptist repent for the Kingdom of
[1:01:55] Heaven is
[1:01:56] the Lord a shout you have to repent and
[1:01:59] recognize you are wrong glory to God you
[1:02:02] are wrong
[1:02:03] Hallelujah
[1:02:05] glory to God and get the Godly sorrow
[1:02:07] for sin not worldly sorrow Godly sorrow
[1:02:10] not the sower the world have because
[1:02:12] somebody get exposed and they mess up no
[1:02:15] not that kind of sorrow but they'll
[1:02:16] recognize you offended God to recognize
[1:02:19] his God you're affected he recognizes
[1:02:21] God you're hurt or give the Lord some
[1:02:23] Praises Godly sorrow glory to God when
[1:02:26] God looking at you your wife might be
[1:02:28] looking your husband like me looking but
[1:02:30] God looking okay the Lord our prayers
[1:02:33] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank
[1:02:36] you Jesus
[1:02:39] let's go
[1:02:46] so God made man and all the animals
[1:02:51] till he come down to sin hear this but
[1:02:54] but he could not make sin
[1:02:58] because he cannot be righteous
[1:03:02] and the father of righteousness and make
[1:03:04] sin
[1:03:06] so you know what he done he made Man In
[1:03:08] His Image
[1:03:09] knowing man would fall
[1:03:11] because he was given to be a free moral
[1:03:14] agent
[1:03:18] he knowed he was going to touch the tree
[1:03:21] he said don't touch it he said that's
[1:03:23] just you you die he thought you should
[1:03:25] die he knew man would fail but he
[1:03:28] couldn't make him feel
[1:03:31] that's a good one you know he knew man
[1:03:34] would fail but he couldn't make him fail
[1:03:36] he had to do it on himself and that
[1:03:40] would make God righteous
[1:03:42] so God put a man in the image and like
[1:03:44] this no bar No Woman No Calypso no
[1:03:47] Carnival no pan beaten nothing at all
[1:03:49] just a man his wife the tree
[1:03:52] and the man fell
[1:03:54] and that man was in God's image
[1:03:57] so that means any man could fall so
[1:03:59] behave yourself and don't play
[1:04:01] self-righteous or give the Lord some
[1:04:03] Praises glory to God behave yourself for
[1:04:08] all I've sinned and come short of the
[1:04:10] glory of God don't play a more righteous
[1:04:12] than nobody inside of here behave
[1:04:14] yourself
[1:04:15] Give the Lord some praises
[1:04:18] glory to God hallelujah it wasn't you
[1:04:22] knocking on God's door it was God
[1:04:24] knocking on your door he said behold I
[1:04:27] stand on the door and knock If any man
[1:04:29] hear my voice hey
[1:04:32] an open
[1:04:33] hear his voice and open the door I'm
[1:04:36] gonna come in
[1:04:38] I see this morning let him in
[1:04:42] [Music]
[1:04:45] let him in because of what's inside the
[1:04:48] house
[1:04:48] [Music]
[1:04:51] I said don't go there preacher we're
[1:04:53] going right there
[1:04:56] all right
[1:04:57] so he knew man would feel and but yet he
[1:05:01] couldn't make him fall he had to do it
[1:05:03] on himself so that will keep him
[1:05:05] righteous so man fell himself
[1:05:07] after he made him so close to himself he
[1:05:10] put him on the basis of free moral
[1:05:12] agency and therefore that is where he
[1:05:14] fell by his act he fell and today each
[1:05:18] one of you children and each of us
[1:05:20] adults is placed on them same two trees
[1:05:23] we can't we can accept it or refuse it
[1:05:27] oh my
[1:05:29] God so God was in Christ the anointed
[1:05:31] one that was Christ means anointed one
[1:05:32] there what was it what he said watching
[1:05:35] he died to pay the debt of your hybriden
[1:05:40] so because man fell
[1:05:43] a price had to be paid to get us back on
[1:05:45] track
[1:05:46] it wasn't free
[1:05:48] so Jesus had just come to die he come to
[1:05:50] pay the price of a high breeding to get
[1:05:53] us back in the original because Adam
[1:05:55] wants to speak for a son
[1:05:57] just like him
[1:05:59] how did God make man let us make man it
[1:06:01] was spoken word So Adam was supposed to
[1:06:03] speak for his son in the womb of Eve and
[1:06:06] bring forth another Son of God
[1:06:08] but when Adam fell and the creation fell
[1:06:11] it fell into sex but it wasn't so from
[1:06:14] the beginning it was supposed to be
[1:06:16] spoken word so that's why Jesus when he
[1:06:18] first message he came he said you must
[1:06:20] be born again
[1:06:21] of the word and the spirit
[1:06:23] so we are already going back out are we
[1:06:25] supposed to be in Genesis by the word
[1:06:28] and the spirit so when you come to
[1:06:30] church you come to come they get the
[1:06:31] word inside of you and then the spirit
[1:06:33] takes the word and transform inside of
[1:06:36] you glory to God your flesh is the same
[1:06:38] outside dying man but something happened
[1:06:40] on the inside that the devil could only
[1:06:43] watch but yeah touch
[1:06:44] or give the Lord a shout the same
[1:06:47] outside man but a different Inner Man
[1:06:49] glory to God a new man inside the dear
[1:06:52] oh God God put the work inside of you a
[1:06:56] light like a button coming inside of you
[1:06:58] and every devil in hell could see the
[1:07:00] light over your life every devil in hell
[1:07:02] to see that light inside of you or give
[1:07:05] the Lord a shout we are not trinidadians
[1:07:07] we are born from here we born from above
[1:07:10] Give the Lord a shout
[1:07:13] Oh Glory love God you are not from this
[1:07:15] Earth You are from above
[1:07:18] testimony
[1:07:20] [Applause]
[1:07:24] Glory
[1:07:26] God send your New Year to give you a
[1:07:27] witness
[1:07:28] to the world that Jesus Christ has seen
[1:07:31] yesterday in favor

[1:08:57] they want it
[1:08:58] yeah and someone said we're going to
[1:08:59] take it then you can get burned
[1:09:02] but that's where you're saving it from
[1:09:03] she's gonna protect you from building
[1:09:05] your hands

[1:09:12] to yourself
[1:09:14] until you are normal yourself
[1:09:17] and be filled with his word believe in
[1:09:19] his word and then the Holy Spirit was in
[1:09:22] him comes down to water that word to
[1:09:24] make it grow
[1:09:25] and then what is it it is God
[1:09:27] manifesting continuing the work of his
[1:09:30] full son
[1:09:31] he's doing that through you
[1:09:33] God have an interest in us getting back
[1:09:35] to Indiana
[1:09:37] whether Adam lost his life he lost his
[1:09:39] inheritance in life he lost the title
[1:09:41] deed the original deed went back and as
[1:09:43] original owner when you have property
[1:09:45] internet everybody asking for a deed
[1:09:47] they did show testimony of ownership if
[1:09:50] you don't have a deed they say a
[1:09:52] squatter and if the original owner comes
[1:09:54] back he could take it back so the
[1:09:56] original one of the Earth was God
[1:09:57] himself now the Earth was not created
[1:09:59] for demons
[1:10:02] the Earth was created for Sons and
[1:10:04] Daughters of God
[1:10:05] that's what he put the Earth for for us
[1:10:08] We Are Not Angels
[1:10:10] so even though I go to heaven six
[1:10:11] Dimension you have to come back here
[1:10:13] because this is Where We Belong
[1:10:15] we shall reign on the Earth
[1:10:18] this is what God put the Earth for for
[1:10:19] man when Lucifer and his boys got kicked
[1:10:22] out of heaven they fell on the Earth
[1:10:26] is rebellious gang
[1:10:28] the rebels Hallelujah that fell off our
[1:10:31] pride and and he won power he wanted to
[1:10:33] be in charge you want to be like the
[1:10:34] most high and they have men right now
[1:10:36] trying to be like the most high too and
[1:10:38] God will bring them no the most low
[1:10:40] praise God don't try to be the most high
[1:10:42] God will bring you down low because
[1:10:44] everybody exalted shall be brought down
[1:10:46] low oh give the Lord some Praises my God
[1:10:50] hallelujah praise God so listen let us
[1:10:52] know
[1:10:53] the Bible has got to be in you
[1:10:56] the word is a seed as long as laying
[1:10:59] here it won't do nothing but when it
[1:11:01] comes in here when it comes into the
[1:11:03] heart then it begins to manifest by the
[1:11:07] Holy Spirit The Works of God
[1:11:09] ten Visions come
[1:11:12] then power comes then humility comes all
[1:11:16] you know it all is gone you become
[1:11:19] nothing Christ becomes alive you die he
[1:11:22] lives
[1:11:22] there's some people don't like to admit
[1:11:24] they don't know
[1:11:25] they prefer to Bluff their weight and
[1:11:27] they say I don't know that you know
[1:11:28] could you tell me
[1:11:30] yeah but you don't know
[1:11:33] you're bluffing your way through you're
[1:11:35] too proud
[1:11:36] that's why you act like you know and
[1:11:39] sometimes you bless you with you
[1:11:40] sometimes you get you sometimes you
[1:11:41] don't but you don't want to say you know
[1:11:43] I really don't know that you know but
[1:11:45] there are people who know their stuff
[1:11:46] and that way one resource day well you
[1:11:48] know you let's say you want a mechanic
[1:11:51] or something somebody said he's he's a
[1:11:52] spanner he's a mechanic because he's a
[1:11:54] spanner
[1:11:56] you wouldn't go to a doctor operation a
[1:11:58] man just passed his degree just come on
[1:12:00] the law he say he never even operates in
[1:12:01] a body and they say I want to operate on
[1:12:03] him
[1:12:04] you wouldn't want that you want that
[1:12:06] duck to operate many many times you have
[1:12:08] 80 operations behind his back that's the
[1:12:11] person you want a manual custom which
[1:12:13] man can't take blood when you do
[1:12:14] something you want to leave you you
[1:12:15] don't want that
[1:12:17] oh Hallelujah so when you come to God
[1:12:19] you come to get the expert they come to
[1:12:21] get the Fountain of wisdom they come to
[1:12:23] get his knowledge they get they get the
[1:12:24] information it's not right so we are
[1:12:27] predestinated why Christ is the Original
[1:12:29] Seed and this Original Seed was
[1:12:31] predestinated by the foreknowledge of
[1:12:33] God knowing that the fall would come and
[1:12:36] predestined him to take our place you
[1:12:38] get it all Sons and Daughters of God are
[1:12:40] predestinated
[1:12:41] all
[1:12:43] all so when your mother had you
[1:12:47] you not was after thought you had to
[1:12:49] come
[1:12:50] because God ordained you as a seed
[1:12:52] earlier do you believe that
[1:12:54] so what he didn't make Eve do that he
[1:12:56] didn't make her do it but he knewed she
[1:12:57] would do it so God foresaw and
[1:13:00] predestinated the world of Sons and
[1:13:02] Daughters of God isn't that right praise
[1:13:05] the name of the Lord so we know that
[1:13:08] every year the high priest used to have
[1:13:10] to offer blood in the temple isn't that
[1:13:12] right and Israel will be under tension
[1:13:14] waiting to know if God forgive them once
[1:13:15] a year you have to go in there with
[1:13:17] bells ringing isn't that right from the
[1:13:19] holy place to the most holy place isn't
[1:13:21] that right the outer Court he has to go
[1:13:22] in in and when did he come back out the
[1:13:24] people shout because they know they got
[1:13:26] forgiven that all that was a temporary
[1:13:28] reprieve because the Lamb of God had to
[1:13:30] come to pay the price every year either
[1:13:33] going praise God but they pay the price
[1:13:35] forever
[1:13:36] praise God is not right and the veil
[1:13:39] between that and the holy place the
[1:13:40] holiest of holies the only way you can
[1:13:43] get in there is to have self-will the
[1:13:46] will to do the will of God praise God we
[1:13:48] believe that and when Christ comes in
[1:13:51] you create an altar on your heart and
[1:13:54] your sins are taken daily the great
[1:13:56] Saint Paul said I Die daily who said
[1:13:59] that Paul said that the prophet said
[1:14:00] that I Die daily not weekly not monthly
[1:14:03] I Die daily every day we have to die
[1:14:06] every day we have to surrender every day
[1:14:08] we have to submit ourselves to his will
[1:14:10] into his word praise God you will to
[1:14:14] live or you will to die either one you
[1:14:16] want to praise God you are based on free
[1:14:19] moral agency the doctor say a second you
[1:14:22] have some disease or you have cancer or
[1:14:23] something so all of a sudden like
[1:14:25] something clicking your mind I go there
[1:14:26] I go there I go there I go there you
[1:14:27] sing like a Psalm like a song after
[1:14:29] that's your special you go dead who said
[1:14:31] you were dead God Is A Healer free is
[1:14:33] good but what if you change the whole
[1:14:34] picture and say you know what the Lord
[1:14:36] that God I tell you Lord I'm trusting
[1:14:37] you to heal me I'm trusting to get out
[1:14:40] of this I'm trusting you to shut them
[1:14:41] out of the critics that say that my time
[1:14:44] is up Lord my time is not up I had a man
[1:14:46] he was told he was going to finish God
[1:14:48] says set your papers in order your time
[1:14:50] is up and that man tune his face towards
[1:14:52] God and say God I serve you all these
[1:14:55] years I need some more time God sent a
[1:14:57] Providence that I tell him give him 15
[1:14:58] more years he gets he gives the man 15
[1:15:00] more years oh give the Lord a shout so
[1:15:03] even if your time is up you could turn
[1:15:05] to God and say God give me some more
[1:15:07] time Hallelujah and God can add time to
[1:15:09] your life do you believe that
[1:15:11] he's the one that gave your life he can
[1:15:14] add he can subtract oh give the Lord Our
[1:15:16] Praise In The House Oh Glory to God he
[1:15:19] said boundaries you cannot pass oh God

[1:15:26] new kidneys a new pancreas a new liver

[1:19:58] sometime I go away
[1:20:00] I was reading the book A little boy that
[1:20:02] entered the contest
[1:20:04] and this contest he was to make himself
[1:20:06] famous name and little boy could keep
[1:20:09] the password in his mind
[1:20:10] till he get to a certain place he could
[1:20:12] speak this password
[1:20:14] and the gatekeeper would let him through
[1:20:16] that was a testy IQ of the child and
[1:20:19] when he got to the place speaking the
[1:20:20] password I was giving him the gate went
[1:20:22] open and he would bring a great honor
[1:20:25] one little boy being very swift-footed
[1:20:27] known good well that he could order on
[1:20:30] all the rest of the boys in the contest
[1:20:31] he thought he could he practiced day
[1:20:32] after day of running how he could pump
[1:20:34] up his lungs got his physical body and
[1:20:37] trim he would he wouldn't Tire as he
[1:20:39] gone he practiced how to start with his
[1:20:41] feet get his head plunged ahead of the
[1:20:43] rest of the boys know who he must
[1:20:45] breathe during the time I was running in
[1:20:46] order to hold the oxygen that came to
[1:20:48] his body to keep him pumping on it
[1:20:50] wouldn't slope his heart too much he
[1:20:51] studied it from every Angry curd and in
[1:20:54] the morning that they restarted there
[1:20:56] was more than 150 little boys line up at
[1:20:59] a certain age
[1:21:01] this little boy was rather a good-sized
[1:21:04] boy for his age and he remembered all
[1:21:05] his training he got ready they got on
[1:21:08] the line put their faces against the
[1:21:09] string that come forward along pushed
[1:21:12] the little nose up against it he studied
[1:21:14] all the rules of that making himself
[1:21:15] ready when the gun was fired and the
[1:21:17] line was broken the little boy jumped
[1:21:19] forward little guy so physically fit
[1:21:21] till he jumped way ahead of the rest of
[1:21:23] them and down the track he went with
[1:21:25] terrific speed well trained until he
[1:21:26] could outrun every boy that was in the
[1:21:28] race and he was there quite a long time
[1:21:30] a minute or more before the rest of the
[1:21:33] runners ever reached the place
[1:21:35] but all of his physical training he had
[1:21:38] forgotten the password
[1:21:42] he had forgotten the very thing that he
[1:21:45] was to see to let him in at the gate so
[1:21:48] he reached first in front of everybody
[1:21:51] and boy
[1:21:54] he forgot the password
[1:22:01] all his physical training he had
[1:22:03] forgotten the password
[1:22:05] he had forgotten
[1:22:07] the very thing that he was to say to let
[1:22:09] him in the gate
[1:22:11] he pays back and forth stalled sir to
[1:22:14] his mind he had been so interested in
[1:22:16] the natural physical conditions of his
[1:22:18] body
[1:22:19] till he had forgotten the main thing
[1:22:23] owned online some boys that didn't run
[1:22:26] so fast remembered the password and
[1:22:27] enter in
[1:22:29] so it is today

[1:22:44] that I'm raised from the dead
[1:22:46] and I'll meet them in Galilee
[1:22:49] we forgot the key word

[1:22:57] things you need to remember
[1:22:59] and there's some things you need
[1:23:02] to forget

[1:23:05] are passed
[1:23:06] this could be a new day for you
[1:23:09] a new turn in your life
[1:23:11] instead of having preachers or
[1:23:14] educational system our International
[1:23:15] system has took the place of the Holy
[1:23:17] Spirit

[1:27:20] coming by oh the other said I painted
[1:27:23] the dust you see in this case the latch
[1:27:27] is on the inside
[1:27:28] and that's the way it is the latch is on
[1:27:31] the inside Christ

[1:27:35] but you have to open the door he will
[1:27:40] not do that against your will he give
[1:27:43] you the ability to let him in he cannot
[1:27:47] force himself in for there is no latch

[1:29:36] sons he straightened out yes as you pass
[1:29:39] behind him back I says
[1:29:40] you he is no respecter of persons I know
[1:29:44] that preacher Prophet pastor King it
[1:29:46] doesn't matter he has no respecter of
[1:29:49] persons he honors his word he honors his
[1:29:52] truth that's why he told Adam the day
[1:29:54] you eat thereof that day you die that's
[1:29:56] what make him go to us he keeps his word
[1:29:58] his curses and His blessings oh give the
[1:30:01] Lord a shout in the house Glory
[1:30:03] Hallelujah
[1:30:04] thank you Jesus he said I stand at the
[1:30:07] door said Jesus in this age did you
[1:30:10] notice the only church age that he was
[1:30:12] put out of his church all the other
[1:30:13] churches he was inside the church
[1:30:16] though through the Methodist Lutheran
[1:30:18] and so forth he was on the inside the
[1:30:20] church but he is on the outside our
[1:30:22] Creeds and things have run him out of
[1:30:24] the church he's standing there knocking
[1:30:25] but here and opened the door I will come
[1:30:28] up with him and support him and give him
[1:30:30] a healing for his eyes and close and
[1:30:33] give him Riches of Heaven he that will
[1:30:35] hear me knock oh praise the name of the
[1:30:38] Lord blessed be the name of the Lord and
[1:30:40] whenever
[1:30:42] what what does a man knock on a man's
[1:30:44] door for he's trying to gain entrance
[1:30:46] he's trying to get in he's perhaps got
[1:30:48] something he want to tell you talk over
[1:30:50] with you he got a message for you that's
[1:30:52] the reason people knock on one another's
[1:30:53] door they got some reason to it there
[1:30:56] cannot be that happened without some
[1:30:57] reason you could go to another you
[1:30:59] cannot go to a man's house unless
[1:31:00] there's some reason to go if nothing
[1:31:02] else to visit take him to a message or
[1:31:04] something and whenever there's a
[1:31:05] question there has got to be an answer
[1:31:07] there could not be a question without an
[1:31:09] answer so we look for the Bible these
[1:31:11] questions of the day the Bible has the
[1:31:13] answer and you know the most important
[1:31:15] person of all time Jesus Christ knocks
[1:31:17] at our door and he's turned away more
[1:31:20] than all the kings and potentials there
[1:31:22] whatever was
[1:31:23] who would come to your house any greater
[1:31:25] than Jesus Christ who could knock at
[1:31:27] your door greater than Jesus Christ who
[1:31:29] could do that the Son of God who could
[1:31:30] knock at your house would be more
[1:31:32] important yet he knocks day after day
[1:31:34] day after day and if you even accept him
[1:31:37] you call a fanatic see the world knows
[1:31:40] its own what if you knocked at
[1:31:43] somebody's door he's switching it now
[1:31:45] let's turn the picture right around for
[1:31:47] a minute what if you went and knocked on
[1:31:48] somebody's door and you had something
[1:31:50] for them and they were about like you
[1:31:54] would be to God well you know and so
[1:31:56] when you knock on somebody's door and
[1:31:58] the people of the window and shut the
[1:32:00] curtain and neither come out the door
[1:32:02] and say or say some other time
[1:32:05] you say I ain't got this time this
[1:32:06] morning you know what you'll do you're
[1:32:08] probably the same thing I will do you
[1:32:10] wouldn't go back anymore
[1:32:11] but not Jesus
[1:32:15] do you see that but not Jesus I stand
[1:32:19] and knock
[1:32:21] continually knock
[1:32:24] he that seek it not seek he that knock
[1:32:26] it so he is continuing nothing every day
[1:32:29] he's knocking hey I want to talk with
[1:32:31] you hey I want to help you I want to
[1:32:33] deliver you I want to free you I want to

[1:33:04] and Angels not hire any animals they

[1:33:34] Doyle
[1:33:36] what if I invite you to my house
[1:33:38] you come in the door and you knock the
[1:33:40] door and I looked outside yes come on in
[1:33:42] if you if you can help me well you do so
[1:33:45] when you come in now I don't want you I
[1:33:47] do all your medal around my house you
[1:33:48] know you stand here right at the door
[1:33:53] the human heart
[1:33:55] there are many little doors
[1:33:57] in the human heart
[1:33:59] and little doors covers up a lot of
[1:34:02] things
[1:34:03] when I come to your house if you welcome
[1:34:05] me in the door why you say well but I'm
[1:34:07] glad to see you it's a privilege of me
[1:34:10] to come into your house won't you come
[1:34:11] and sit down but Ibraham make yourself
[1:34:13] at home
[1:34:14] I can go to the refrigerator get me one
[1:34:16] of those big sandwiches take off my
[1:34:18] shoes go on bedroom and lay down I have
[1:34:21] a weak astronomical Jubilee because I
[1:34:23] felt welcome
[1:34:24] you made me welcome I appreciate that
[1:34:27] you made me welcome but if I went to
[1:34:29] your home and you told me you stand here
[1:34:31] at the door no don't you go middling
[1:34:32] around
[1:34:33] I wouldn't feel too welcome would you
[1:34:35] you will feel to welcome
[1:34:37] so let's look at the human heart
[1:34:39] the doors inside of doors
[1:34:43] we want to identify one first door here
[1:34:45] at the door of selfishness
[1:34:48] what I can get out of it for me and my
[1:34:50] family
[1:34:52] only cares about you
[1:34:54] all your burden is about you and your
[1:34:55] family you zoom in right there it ends
[1:34:58] right there
[1:34:59] you're not looking to your left look to
[1:35:01] the right who need help who need
[1:35:03] encouragement who need prayer all your
[1:35:05] concerns about you selfishness
[1:35:09] it's for me or for my group as long as
[1:35:11] my animation is all right see and you
[1:35:14] know there's a kiss I find you know this
[1:35:17] thing called selfishness
[1:35:19] and God could hardly use a selfish
[1:35:20] person
[1:35:21] because they don't give they don't share
[1:35:23] they keep everything locked down God has
[1:35:25] gave a giver
[1:35:27] because that person will give so God
[1:35:29] could give them the more God give them
[1:35:30] the more they give so they become a
[1:35:32] Channel of God's given but when people
[1:35:34] selfish they stop right there by them
[1:35:37] isn't that something you're gonna just
[1:35:39] go through it quickly praise God he said
[1:35:41] I'd like to do a certain thing I if you
[1:35:43] say what I like for him to do a certain
[1:35:46] thing for me if I can get so much out of
[1:35:49] it I'll go to church if I'll make people
[1:35:51] in my community think better of me but
[1:35:53] you won't open this little door so
[1:35:55] you'll receive Christ you open him but
[1:35:57] you keep that selfishness yeah yeah like
[1:36:01] the private people she's there that's
[1:36:03] yours but he wants you to open the door
[1:36:06] and get that selfishness out
[1:36:10] Hallelujah another little door in the
[1:36:12] heart is a door called Pride
[1:36:15] that's a big one
[1:36:17] that's a big one
[1:36:19] little dough when they come human heart
[1:36:21] he says it's have a lot of them but I'm
[1:36:23] going to speak a few of them on the
[1:36:24] right side of the human heart I like
[1:36:26] that when you walk into the door is that
[1:36:28] they'll go on the right side and that
[1:36:30] door is called the door of Pride don't
[1:36:32] you go enter into that door
[1:36:34] they don't want the Lord in there at all
[1:36:36] that is pride I am Blue Blood it is
[1:36:39] pride don't you meddling there he can't
[1:36:41] feel welcome as long as you keep that
[1:36:44] Pride or shot
[1:36:45] that's why sometimes God sent us to
[1:36:47] experiences to humiliate us
[1:36:50] and humble us
[1:36:51] he said he went and tries people threw a
[1:36:53] lot of stuff to Humble them
[1:36:55] and to prove them to see what's in their
[1:36:59] hand you knew you could very proud being
[1:37:01] God's people that's how Israel becoming
[1:37:03] a proud God's people till they could do
[1:37:05] anything praise God there's another door
[1:37:08] called Pride what a horrible little
[1:37:10] black Devils all pinned up in the heart
[1:37:12] of pride
[1:37:14] thinking you're better than somebody
[1:37:15] else
[1:37:16] bunch of devils in that room you know
[1:37:19] Christ's just outside but in that room
[1:37:20] that door you don't want to open that
[1:37:22] door at all I like how he's sitting a
[1:37:24] bunch of black Devils all pinned up in
[1:37:26] the heart of pride
[1:37:28] thinking you are better than somebody
[1:37:30] else because Mike just better shoot
[1:37:32] better house better car better I am
[1:37:35] better I am the better one
[1:37:37] and the devil feeling better inside
[1:37:43] Pride fear
[1:37:44] feel complex you have you don't want
[1:37:46] Jesus to touch that because it will
[1:37:48] degrade your social standing Society
[1:37:51] I wonder if we have some open services
[1:37:52] and invite somebody Believers to come
[1:37:54] and get some tambourine at this side of
[1:37:56] the road oh God I think I think that's a
[1:37:58] good one boy but that could be a Revival
[1:38:01] glory to God let them come inside the
[1:38:03] road and I will preach I have get in the
[1:38:06] place of Oregon and have a clap at the
[1:38:07] cross at the cross we saw that long time
[1:38:09] you know better first sort of like I'm
[1:38:12] the burden of your heart roll away my
[1:38:15] Lord
[1:38:17] I receive my side I am now I am happy
[1:38:22] all the day the side of the road
[1:38:25] and people laughing people mocking I
[1:38:27] remember as a young Christian I was so
[1:38:29] jealous for God I wanted anything with
[1:38:30] God anything to do with this scripture a
[1:38:32] man was preaching down an independent
[1:38:34] square a little small short Indian man
[1:38:37] and he was preaching and he's preaching
[1:38:38] and he's preaching he said oh he said
[1:38:40] who won prayer and I run forward and the
[1:38:42] little man shot he put his hand upon me
[1:38:44] and pray now here I want to stop praying
[1:38:46] and he prayed when I look
[1:38:48] Ed terrible watches
[1:38:51] later on in years my brother tell me
[1:38:54] pass and see me down dear a man if he's
[1:38:58] so shame
[1:38:59] but I wasn't feeling shame I was feeling
[1:39:03] great
[1:39:04] oh give the Lord a shouting house glory
[1:39:08] to God hallelujah hallelujah praise God
[1:39:12] I was in General John Johnson Technical
[1:39:14] Institute doing electrical engineering
[1:39:16] technician
[1:39:17] and
[1:39:18] we saw some real battles and fight and
[1:39:21] whatnot and I used to stutter you may
[1:39:23] not know that I just thought and so on
[1:39:25] and a man tell me you believe a false
[1:39:27] prophet I wanted to talk

[1:39:46] standing for Jesus Oh Glory to God

[1:46:46] that you and the Lord are buddies
[1:46:48] your partners whatever you have he has
[1:46:51] to whatever he has then you have to you

[1:48:33] problems God don't like that either all
[1:48:36] right all right now watch something
[1:48:40] they say wait a minute young man I'm
[1:48:42] virtuous that might be so in your own
[1:48:44] thoughts
[1:48:45] but remember their judgment you're going
[1:48:47] to answer for commit an adultery
[1:48:49] whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust
[1:48:51] after had committed adultery already you
[1:48:53] presented yourself to him see how the
[1:48:55] devil got them blinded it's a disgrace
[1:48:57] it's they got a spirit and it's an
[1:48:59] Unholy Spirit the genuine holy spirit
[1:49:02] will make a woman dress decently and
[1:49:05] look holy all right we're under stretch
[1:49:07] door to your private life
[1:49:09] foreign
[1:49:25] I don't know that
[1:49:32] but if you want Jesus
[1:49:34] not the pastor Jesus
[1:49:36] open the door
[1:49:38] to your private life there's a door
[1:49:39] there I want to call that door
[1:49:41] a door
[1:49:43] the right hand side and the door is the
[1:49:45] door to your private life
[1:49:47] you know if I want to go out a cocktail
[1:49:49] party what is that to you
[1:49:51] what is the church going to tell me a
[1:49:54] tenth of my wages you're going to tell
[1:49:55] me what to do that's my private life I
[1:49:58] make this money I have my own life I
[1:50:00] wear shorts if I want to my privilege
[1:50:03] but if you're a lamb not a goat alarm is
[1:50:06] what he's after
[1:50:08] so no
[1:50:10] you could understand the parable of the
[1:50:12] soul and the seed some fell on the
[1:50:14] Wayside some Philemon rocks spring up
[1:50:16] and then die some fell among Thorns some
[1:50:18] fell on good ground
[1:50:19] the seed is not the problem
[1:50:22] it's a ground had fallen
[1:50:24] so every service seeds are going out
[1:50:27] the ground is the heart
[1:50:30] s that are until Rocky need a whole need
[1:50:34] a pickaxe to get their stones out and
[1:50:36] then you'll take a hole and you revive
[1:50:39] the ground then you can put season so
[1:50:41] that's what the word does it grabs out
[1:50:43] things that needs to come out to get the
[1:50:45] seed in because remember the seed bring
[1:50:48] forth after its kind and the seed have
[1:50:50] to be the word coming inside of you
[1:50:52] so a lot depends upon the kind of Hearts
[1:50:54] so that's why he said there is no such
[1:50:56] thing as a holy church the Holy Ghost
[1:50:58] can be preaching it but inside the day
[1:51:00] if I'm good bad Rebels Renegades all
[1:51:02] kinds because inside that they have all
[1:51:04] kind of Hearts but you're preaching the
[1:51:06] word of God and we don't know the
[1:51:08] condition of the heart unless God
[1:51:10] reveals it so you have to know what
[1:51:12] condition your heart is in that you
[1:51:14] could receive the word of God so some
[1:51:16] people they hear it and they can act
[1:51:18] upon it because it's effective to them
[1:51:20] some people just hearing it is like what
[1:51:22] on Duck back maybe they come to see
[1:51:23] somebody
[1:51:24] they come because they come a long time
[1:51:26] and they don't want to look like they're
[1:51:26] backstream they're making up time
[1:51:28] they'll know where they go this Sunday
[1:51:29] morning and that traffic all around to
[1:51:31] them as well spend some time
[1:51:33] in church what kind of thing people come
[1:51:34] for Oh Glory to God whatever come to be
[1:51:37] changed and transformed then this world
[1:51:39] is for you
[1:51:40] praise God because the world have to
[1:51:42] take you back the way you belong
[1:51:44] glory to God hallelujah
[1:51:46] now watch
[1:51:48] yes
[1:51:51] then there's a Dwarven difference to
[1:51:53] people who whether God bless them and
[1:51:55] bless them you know there but I'm
[1:51:57] talking about after a while people see
[1:51:58] so much America so much times and
[1:51:59] wonders become normal to them no more
[1:52:01] excitement no more thrill and that is
[1:52:04] troubling you know because sometimes
[1:52:06] people miss the grace of God they save
[1:52:08] and they save and they look like
[1:52:09] everybody like if they they're so
[1:52:11] righteous and and how can this person
[1:52:12] mean such sin and how would this happen
[1:52:14] how that happened how you happen
[1:52:18] he was dancing too God didn't deliver
[1:52:21] you well as God show you Mercy show
[1:52:23] other Mercy too Moses sit and judge
[1:52:26] others praise God one time brother was
[1:52:28] doing that you know he was judging a
[1:52:30] woman with some other men are wrong in a
[1:52:32] bar and whatnot and and he was saying oh
[1:52:34] God for my daughters to grow up in this
[1:52:36] kind of condition and God tap him on the
[1:52:38] shoulder and a vision broke and God show
[1:52:41] him his sins and when his sins watch go
[1:52:44] up to God a bumper of the blood of Jesus
[1:52:46] wash around in the earth and and it was
[1:52:49] bouncing backs off and then God write
[1:52:51] pardon drop his sins in the sea of
[1:52:53] forgetfulness and he tell him I forgive
[1:52:55] you and you condemn her
[1:52:59] on one part I want to bring more than
[1:53:00] this because the blood is around the
[1:53:02] Earth
[1:53:03] you are covered until you die
[1:53:05] if you die with all Christ you go to
[1:53:07] hell
[1:53:08] because the blood doesn't cover beyond
[1:53:10] that
[1:53:11] so on Earth because of the blood you
[1:53:13] have a chance
[1:53:14] you have a choice the lowest sinner have
[1:53:16] a choice because the blood is still
[1:53:18] Heavenly Earth if they leave the earth
[1:53:20] when all that blood affecting their
[1:53:22] heart then they go to hell
[1:53:24] oh praise God so today is the day of
[1:53:26] salvation
[1:53:27] and you know what he did afterwards he
[1:53:29] went to the woman and tell the woman he
[1:53:30] said woman I was condemning you and
[1:53:32] whatnot and God show me my sins and how
[1:53:34] you forgive me and I won't begin to
[1:53:36] testify to him while she was once a
[1:53:37] Christian and she got backslidden and oh
[1:53:40] God and right there on the floor
[1:53:42] in the bad place in the restaurant he
[1:53:45] knee along with that woman and brought
[1:53:47] her back to Christ
[1:53:48] because God show him his own sins and
[1:53:51] how God handled his own sins and when
[1:53:53] God revealed to you that the same blood
[1:53:55] for you is for your brother the same
[1:53:57] blood for you is for your sister you
[1:53:58] will stop condemning them or give the
[1:54:01] Lord a shout and you're going to pray
[1:54:02] for them because that is still your
[1:54:04] brother that is still your sister and
[1:54:06] you can still get Grace to love them
[1:54:08] Oh Glory to God Amen
[1:54:11] Hallelujah
[1:54:15] I think this is the last door we have
[1:54:16] here the door feet
[1:54:18] the next door is feet
[1:54:21] you have private life door of Pride now
[1:54:23] let's open feet
[1:54:25] he says no you said brother
[1:54:28] slider would you pray for me I said yes
[1:54:30] ma'am I'll be glad to your backside of
[1:54:33] the year now I just want just wait a
[1:54:36] minute let me read the scriptures to you
[1:54:37] talk about in hospitals all right
[1:54:39] there's a ladies laying there in a bed
[1:54:41] looked at me next bed really funny her
[1:54:43] and her son about 20 years old regular
[1:54:45] Ricky standing there looking at me I
[1:54:47] said yes ma'am I said I read the
[1:54:49] scripture to her do your sins be a
[1:54:51] Scarlet they shall be white as snow
[1:54:53] don't they be like red like Crimson it
[1:54:55] shall be right like wool and when I read
[1:54:56] that to her I said if you are straight
[1:54:58] away you've got away from God but God
[1:55:01] never got away from you you wouldn't be
[1:55:03] calling for me she started crying I said
[1:55:05] will you pray
[1:55:06] the lady over the next bed said wait a
[1:55:08] minute wait a minute there I said yes
[1:55:10] ma'am she said pull that curtain I said
[1:55:13] aren't you a Christian she said we are
[1:55:14] methodists
[1:55:15] I said well what that has to do with it
[1:55:17] see that's no one insane that you was a
[1:55:19] cult if he was in a big pen I said that
[1:55:22] don't mean a thing you see that is where
[1:55:24] it comes self-righteous that's against
[1:55:26] our faith I said we don't want Divine
[1:55:29] Healing our church that kind of stuff
[1:55:30] that's against our faith I said but
[1:55:32] there's only one Faith there's only one
[1:55:34] Lord there's only one fate sin there's
[1:55:36] only one sin that's unbelief praise the
[1:55:39] name of the Lord so there's a door in
[1:55:42] the heart that door is a door of feet
[1:55:44] and so many professed Christians don't
[1:55:47] want to open that door of Faith you said
[1:55:50] Lord you can come in that's right but I
[1:55:52] do believe that all the Bible is right I
[1:55:54] will take what my church says I won't
[1:55:56] take the rest of it how can he be your
[1:55:58] lord and healer if you can't get your
[1:56:00] heart door of feet to open
[1:56:03] so even Christians have the faith door
[1:56:05] closed the hearing gospel but they're
[1:56:08] not applying the word to themselves the
[1:56:09] Bible says many heard the word but with
[1:56:11] many the word was preached but it wasn't
[1:56:13] to be effective with them oh praise and
[1:56:15] the other Lord so Lord I want to welcome
[1:56:18] him this morning to my heart to every
[1:56:20] room the all that I am I want to welcome
[1:56:23] him at every door swing it up man stand
[1:56:25] there kiss the cup of blessings with him
[1:56:28] in the door and say Yes Lord all I am
[1:56:31] all I have
[1:56:32] all is yours praise God fit you say I'll
[1:56:37] join church but I believe Mission come
