[25:20] morning so we read Genesis 3 from this
[25:26] this is 8:11 and then down to verse 23
[25:35] and they heard the voice of the Lord God
[25:39] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[25:42] day and Adam and his wife hid themselves
[25:45] from the presence of the Lord God
[25:48] amongst the trees of the garden and the
[25:53] Lord called unto Adam and said unto Him
[25:55] where art thou and he said I have heard
[25:59] thy voice in the garden and I was afraid
[26:01] because I was naked and I hid myself and
[26:08] he said who told me that thou was naked
[26:11] hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I
[26:14] commanded thee that thou shalt not eat
[26:17] this 23 therefore the Lord God sent him
[26:22] forth from the Garden of Eden to till
[26:24] the ground from whence he was taken so
[26:28] he drove out the man and he placed at
[26:31] the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims
[26:34] and a flaming sword which turned every
[26:38] way to keep the way of the Tree of Life
[26:42] amen praise the Lord and over now to
[26:46] Isaiah chapter 6 Isaiah 6 this is one to
[26:53] five
[27:02] mm in the year that King Uzziah died I
[27:06] saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high
[27:11] and lifted up and his train filled the
[27:14] temple above it to the seraphim's
[27:17] each one had six wings with twain he
[27:22] covered his face and with twain he
[27:24] covered his feet and with twain he did
[27:27] fly and one cried and another and said
[27:30] holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the
[27:33] whole earth is full of his glory and the
[27:37] posts of the door moved at the voice of
[27:41] him that cried and the house was filled
[27:44] with smoke then said i worries me for I
[27:50] am undone because I'm a man of unclean
[27:53] lips and I dwell in the midst of people
[27:56] of unclean lips for my eyes have seen
[27:59] the king the Lord of hosts amen amen

[28:19] spirit come and express itself upon your
[28:21] people bless your word that we have read
[28:23] in spite our hearts now we ask it of you
[28:26] full preeminence now we pray in your
[28:28] precious name Amen and amen
[28:30] you may be seated praise the Lord right
[28:32] now glory to God look a lotta Honda
[28:36] praises one amen amen
[28:39] so from adoption in Genesis 1 when God
[28:45] called his name Lord God it's in the
[28:49] word of ill Allah Elohim which means a
[28:52] self existed on and there was nothing
[28:55] else existed but him there was no air no
[29:00] light no stars no world there was
[29:03] nothing else it was called and God alone
[29:07] thank you for Antony man what a song
[29:09] amen Gordon going alone priest
[29:13] but inside of this great Elohim was an
[29:16] attribute let me say this rare nature
[29:21] inside of him was a nature to be a
[29:24] father but he's a self existent there
[29:28] isn't anything for him to be a father to
[29:31] and down inside inside of him there was
[29:34] something else he wanted to be a god a
[29:39] god is an object of worship
[29:41] yet he was self existent a man how could
[29:45] he be God if there was no one to worship
[29:47] Him amen
[29:50] again inside of him he was a savior but
[29:53] there was nothing lost to be saved a man
[29:58] inside of that nature he was a healer
[30:01] but there was nothing sick to be healed
[30:04] can we say man glory to God if he used
[30:08] to be God then he must have some worship
[30:11] as a man hallelujah praise God so L owe
[30:16] him praise God created the first the
[30:20] first thing he created was some angels
[30:22] and they came around and he will stop
[30:25] him and they became and then he became
[30:28] God can we say man hallelujah hallelujah
[30:31] praise God amen and those hinges never
[30:36] cease to worship God and to give him
[30:39] adoration praise God day and night they
[30:42] worship Him praise God amen I wanted
[30:45] this morning we have somebody who's
[30:47] gonna worship and praise God who's gonna
[30:49] sing holy holy holy unto the Lord holy
[30:52] holy holy is the Lord God Almighty
[30:54] praise God who was and is and is to come
[30:58] really Scott hallelujah thank you Jesus
[31:02] what a worship angels worship Him angels
[31:07] are still worshiping him amen praise God
[31:09] hallelujah glory but still that nature
[31:14] in God angels could do no more than
[31:18] worship angels couldn't be lost
[31:24] angels don't get sick they're immortal
[31:27] beings British God so although he was
[31:31] happy to be worshiped as God yet a great
[31:34] part of his nature was still locked up
[31:36] inside of him
[31:37] and he wanted to express it where is God
[31:40] amen hallelujah hallelujah praise God
[31:45] you can displace healing pause then then
[31:50] praise God but he could this morning

[32:34] after the Angels he said we'll make
[32:37] something tangible and there in the
[32:40] beginning God created the heaven and the
[32:43] earth but the earth was just void having
[32:49] no form no structure no life just
[32:53] darkness and the Spirit of God began to
[32:56] move upon the waters hallelujah maybe
[33:00] the Spirit of God will begin to move
[33:01] this morning a man in your situation of
[33:04] Darkness praise God in your emptiness
[33:06] the Spirit of God can begin to move
[33:08] praise God hallelujah amen and when the
[33:13] Spirit of God moves God begins to speak

[48:50] requirement to access the presence of
[48:52] God they were no longer holy they were
[48:58] no longer perfect they became human and

[49:55] from the presence of God hallelujah

[50:02] Eden and he does it all the time trying
[50:05] to take away your access right to God's

[51:20] a loser man I said hey man hallelujah
[51:23] praise God amen
[51:25] Satan is a loser hallelujah and you've
[51:29] got to talk back to the old serpent talk
[51:33] back to him a man Laurie get the Lord
[51:36] had a praise hallelujah and when Adam
[51:47] and Eve sinned two things happen they
[51:52] lost the requirement to access God's
[51:54] prison
[51:54] so all fellowship was cut off on their
[51:58] side the second thing God himself
[52:04] no matter how much he wants to he cannot
[52:07] fellowship outside of holiness that's
[52:11] just who he is
[52:12] it's his nature he is constrained by his
[52:17] own law a man a man brother
[52:23] outside of Calvary this is probably one
[52:27] of the saddest scenes in the Bible
[52:31] Jehovah excitedly coming down looking
[52:34] desperately for his children come on
[52:36] Adam I don't where about I've come to
[52:39] have Church I've come for fellowship
[52:42] Adam you usually have I know where
[52:44] usually man but Adam is hiding brother
[52:49] branham said as soon as Adam realized he
[52:52] had sinned he should have been running
[52:54] through the garden screaming father
[52:56] father where doubt but instead it was
[53:00] God screaming Adam Adam where the Oh God
[53:04] my mercy Lord he said man at no point in
[53:09] time or in any age ever sought after God
[53:13] it was always God seeking after man
[53:17] are you grateful this morning that he
[53:19] sought up you his spirit draws you this
[53:23] morning hallelujah hallelujah thank you
[53:26] Jesus somebody give him praise somebody
[53:28] praise him for calling you somebody
[53:31] praise him for seeking after you
[53:32] Alleluia I never sought God it was God
[53:36] God who came looking for me hallelujah
[53:39] hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus
[53:46] thank you lord thank you lord thank you
[53:50] lord
[53:51] Adam is afraid first time ever fear
[53:56] strikes phase of the devil amen
[54:02] Adam tries is one thing to save himself
[54:05] he uses fig leaves to cover sin a moral
[54:09] religion to cover his sinful nature but
[54:13] when he came face-to-face with God do
[54:16] you recognize that he was lost his
[54:19] efforts were no good his religion could
[54:23] not bring him into the perfect
[54:24] fellowship with God and God rejected his
[54:28] religion because the sin itself was
[54:32] still there and God cannot smell outside
[54:36] of holiness can he say man amen so God
[54:41] has nothing to do with religion
[54:43] whatsoever religion has nothing to do
[54:45] with God Amen hallelujah
[54:49] and God's Lee is a sheep and wraps the
[54:53] skin around them as a temporary covering
[54:58] but he had already given them his world
[55:00] and he is constrained by his own word
[55:04] because the word is God amen
[55:08] and the wages of sin is death the day
[55:12] you eat thou shalt surely die
[55:16] amen and Adam died after 930 years which
[55:20] was less than a thousand years or one
[55:22] day he died the same day the day that
[55:26] you eat you shall surely die but it was
[55:33] also a spiritual separation which meant
[55:36] separated from God or cut off from the
[55:39] presence of God hallelujah
[55:42] they lost their claim to eternal life
[55:45] and the inheritance and life itself
[55:48] praise God hallelujah hallelujah right
[55:52] there God had to keep his judgment
[55:55] because he had spoken it and he is God
[55:58] he can't back up on his word in order to
[56:01] be God he has to keep his word my my my
[56:03] a man a man a man I'm with a heavy heart
[56:09] Gorton's Adam and Eve and said you have
[56:12] to leave this God you must depart out of
[56:17] my presence you can't live here anymore
[56:21] he said a bit of heavy heart look Jesus
[56:24] my my man
[56:28] then he placed cherubims with a flaming
[56:30] sword to guard the Tree of Life that no
[56:34] man can just walk back and access the
[56:36] Tree of Life it is not free no more this
[56:42] is private property hallelujah my my my
[56:45] my my my my Adam and Eve turn and walked
[56:51] out of the garden crying hugging each
[56:55] other leaving walking through the gates
[56:58] looking at their home for the last time
[57:02] mmm I my mind but all God can bear to
[57:07] see his children leave his presence
[57:10] [Music]
[57:12] and when we leave his presence his
[57:14] spirit is grieve hallelujah he's grieve
[57:17] British God don't you leave his presence
[57:19] ain't how it grieved the heart of God to
[57:23] see them go no he meant as they were
[57:32] about to leave his heart was rent into
[57:35] pieces the love of God LOV II was
[57:38] protecting through amidst the judgment
[57:42] hallelujah hallelujah for god is love
[57:45] amen amen
[57:47] as he will leave in he watched them and
[57:50] he looked over their heads
[57:53] he was watching into the future his love
[57:57] was protecting praise God hallelujah he
[58:01] was driving them out that was his
[58:03] judgment and God is a consuming fire
[58:06] come on amen
[58:07] but his eyes of love his eyes of grace
[58:11] they were looking into the distance
[58:14] hallelujah hallelujah then he said Satan

[58:27] restore them

[58:32] back to Ethan again hallelujah did the
[58:35] Lord a shout of praise better believe it

[1:39:49] he said the presence of God is our
[1:39:51] trouble something he says it's a
[1:39:55] dreadful thing that experience that
[1:40:01] Isaiah had when he saw the Lord
[1:40:05] that wasn't a shot an experienced writer
[1:40:09] it was sovereign but abiram said Isaiah
[1:40:14] remember it all his life those angels in
[1:40:19] holy holy holy is the Lord he fell the
[1:40:24] glory of God he saw the Lord of Hosts
[1:40:27] mighty in battle and his train filled
[1:40:31] the temple that's a sign of victory
[1:40:34] the longer that Kings trainers the more
[1:40:38] battles year 1 but his train
[1:40:41] the temple he is a mighty chorus falling
[1:40:45] where he's God and Isaiah was martyred
[1:40:53] by King Manasseh who soared him asunder
[1:40:57] and punished him for having said I dwell
[1:41:02] in the midst of a people of unclean lips
[1:41:05] according to history men and Parabellum
[1:41:10] said when the saws were cutting through
[1:41:14] Isaiah's buddy
[1:41:16] you could still remember the angels
[1:41:18] crying holy holy holy is the Lord God
[1:41:22] Almighty that presence never left that
[1:41:27] experience never left him even in his
[1:41:31] death through all the pain he was seeing
[1:41:34] holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty
[1:41:38] praise God Isaiah never forgot that
[1:41:43] experience in the presence of the Lord

[1:49:51] the tabernacle itself inside the
[1:49:54] tabernacle had two chambers the holy
[1:49:56] place where the priests alone would go
[1:49:58] then the Holies of Holies inside the
[1:50:03] Holies of Holies contain the Ark of the
[1:50:05] Covenant and only the high priest could
[1:50:08] go in there once again inside the Ark of
[1:50:14] the Covenant with the tablets of the Ten
[1:50:16] Commandments which was false word the
[1:50:20] Ark of the Covenant represented the
