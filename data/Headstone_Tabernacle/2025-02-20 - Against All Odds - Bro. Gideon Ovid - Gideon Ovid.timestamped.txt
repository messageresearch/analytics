[34:05] him
[34:06] tonight amen at this time let's get
[34:09] straight to the word let's if you have
[34:11] your Bibles I'd like you to turn with me
[34:13] to the Book of Mark reading from chapter
[34:16] nine a couple verses in
[34:21] there I hope you come under expectation
[34:25] tonight believe something good is about
[34:28] to happen and something great is in
[34:31] stored for us so reading from chapter 9
[34:34] in The Book of Mark from vers
[34:38] 17 and one of the multitude answered and
[34:40] said master I have brought unto thee my
[34:43] son which hath a dumb
[34:47] spirit and wheresoever he taketh him he
[34:49] teerth him and he foth and Nash it with
[34:53] his teeth and pineth away and I spake to
[34:56] thy disciples that they should C him out
[34:58] and they could not so here we had a
[35:00] scenario in which he had a need he had a
[35:02] desire for his son to be healed and he
[35:05] asked the disciples and in his
[35:08] experience they were unable to do it in
[35:11] verse 19 it says he answer him and said
[35:15] oh faithless generation how long shall I
[35:18] be with you how long shall I suffer you
[35:21] bring him unto me and they brought him
[35:23] unto him and when he saw him straight
[35:25] away the spirit tear him and he fell on
[35:28] the ground and wallowed foaming and he
[35:31] asked his father how long is it ago
[35:33] since this came unto him and he said of
[35:36] a child so since childhood he's been
[35:38] suffering with this going through this
[35:41] this heartache for his child and in
[35:44] verse 22 it says and oftimes it had cast
[35:47] him into the fire and into the waters to
[35:49] destroy him but thou C do anything have
[35:53] compassion on us and help us in verse 23
[35:56] Jesus said unto him
[35:58] if thou can believe all things are
[36:01] possible to him that believeth and
[36:03] straight away the father of the child
[36:05] cried out and said with tears Lord I
[36:07] believe help thou mine unbelief when
[36:11] Jesus saw that the people came running
[36:13] together he rebuked the foul Spirit
[36:15] saying unto him thou dumb and deaf
[36:17] spirit I charge thee come out of him and
[36:20] enter no more into him and the spirit
[36:22] cried and rent him so and came out of
[36:25] him and he was as one dead in so much
[36:28] that many said he is dead but Jesus took
[36:30] him by the hand and lifted him up and he
[36:33] arose and when he was come into the
[36:35] house his disciples asked him privately
[36:38] in secret why could not we cast him
[36:43] out and he said unto them this kind can
[36:46] come forth by nothing but by prayer and
[36:48] fasting may we just bow our heads as we
[36:52] open a word of prayer oh Heavenly Father
[36:54] Lord tonight we are so grateful we so
[36:57] thankful Lord Lord we love you so much
[36:59] for giving us this opportunity to gather
[37:02] together around your word Lord Lord we
[37:04] didn't come in vain we didn't come just
[37:05] to see and hear Lord but we came to
[37:08] cause something to happen Lord Lord we
[37:10] came under expectation with faith
[37:12] knowing that you're the same yesterday
[37:14] today and forever Lord Lord we've come
[37:16] Lord knowing that our needs will be met
[37:18] Lord We've Come Together in this house
[37:20] to worship and to praise you and to
[37:22] exalt Your Name Lord Lord I pray that
[37:24] you will take me out of the way speak
[37:26] directly to your people tonight Lord
[37:28] Lord I pray that their faith be
[37:30] quickened Lord I pray that you will meet
[37:32] them wherever they are right now Lord
[37:34] those connected on the internet Lord
[37:36] those at home at work wherever they
[37:38] might be at this time lord may your
[37:39] presence and your Holy Spirit go out and
[37:41] meet them Lord Lord fill all the house
[37:44] Upstairs Downstairs wherever they are
[37:46] Lord Heal the sick and Afflicted Lord
[37:48] Lord restore Lord the the the tide and
[37:50] the down Trad Lord Lord I pray that you
[37:53] will reach out and and grab a hold of
[37:55] the backsliders lord lord that you will
[37:58] come down in a special way and have your
[38:00] perfect will tonight in Jesus name we
[38:02] pray amen amen amen you may have your
[38:05] seats amen you love him
[38:09] tonight for a title tonight is Against
[38:12] All
[38:13] Odds and inspiration levels of faith in
[38:17] this scripture we read it it is what I
[38:21] call a loaded scripture it highlighted a
[38:23] couple things in the verses we read here
[38:26] it highlighted in the first
[38:28] instance different types of Fai on
[38:31] display so when the father came with the
[38:34] son and said listen this is my son this
[38:36] is the case I brought him to the
[38:38] disciples and they were unable to what
[38:40] he was basically saying is that he found
[38:42] the fate of disciples were a bit weak
[38:45] because these are your disciples these
[38:46] are your followers these are the people
[38:48] that walk and talk with you and have a
[38:49] testimony these are the people that I
[38:51] believe could do something for me could
[38:53] do something for my son Jesus answered
[38:56] and said oh faithless
[38:59] generation so he addressed those that
[39:01] had zero faith faithless it didn't exist
[39:05] you could get nothing done without faith
[39:08] amen later on he went on and the father
[39:12] admitted that his faith wasn't where he
[39:15] thought it should be because when Jesus
[39:17] said if thou can't believe all things
[39:20] are possible to him that believeth he
[39:22] said Lord listen I understand my
[39:25] position I believe but I want you to
[39:27] help me in my unbelief cuz there's a
[39:29] little doubt in my heart that are trying
[39:31] to get out so he was able to identify
[39:34] where he was later on when the spirit
[39:37] left that would have been perfect faith
[39:39] and display that could cast the demons
[39:42] out that could cast The Devil out and
[39:44] the disciples themselves KN they lacked
[39:47] something they asked him why we couldn't
[39:49] do it we walk with you we talk with you
[39:52] we line with you we hang out but we
[39:53] still couldn't do it he said listen this
[39:56] kind can come from CAU by nothing but by
[39:59] prayer and fasting so it will tell us
[40:02] that listen at the end of the day there
[40:04] are different levels of Faith there are
[40:07] different types of Faith there are faith
[40:09] that could pull certain buttons and
[40:11] sometimes you require a greater level of
[40:13] Faith to activate particular things amen
[40:16] so we want to just explore that for a
[40:18] few minutes I don't want to take you too
[40:19] long but I have some quotes that I want
[40:24] to run through and I feel God wants us
[40:25] to grab a whole of these quotes these
[40:27] are not not my quates God wants us to
[40:29] grab a whole of these quates by faith
[40:31] and watch them come to life if you allow
[40:33] him to work just water it with your
[40:36] praise and your worship and allow him to
[40:37] take over amen so for a title I said
[40:42] Against All Odds and there's a meaning
[40:44] to that Against All Odds it
[40:49] says when you do or achieve it although
[40:53] there were a lot of problems and you
[40:55] were not likely to succeed so that's the
[40:58] definition of Against All Odds it means
[41:00] you're not likely to succeed if they
[41:02] look at it they measure it they evaluate
[41:04] it science could check you're not likely
[41:07] to overcome you're not likely to be
[41:10] victorious but Against All Odds you do
[41:13] it anyway by God's grace you did it
[41:15] Anyway by the faith and belief you have
[41:18] in God he able to bring you through
[41:20] anyway
[41:21] amen so I want to run quickly here to a
[41:26] a quote
[41:28] and it's from perseverance 62 all right
[41:33] and from paragraph 72 it says Lord I'm
[41:36] wanting only crumbs and we know the
[41:37] story remember she'd never seen a
[41:40] miracle she was a Greek but she'd heard
[41:43] that there was a miracle that Jesus
[41:45] performed
[41:46] Miracles she only heard it or no she
[41:49] didn't see it and she know if he could
[41:51] perform miracles for one person God was
[41:53] the creator of all things and all people
[41:56] and he could do it for her she'd never
[41:58] seen a miracle but yet she was believing
[42:00] for one having not seen that is Faith
[42:04] she didn't even see a miracle herself
[42:06] but she believed enough to know that it
[42:09] could happen for her
[42:11] Hallelujah and we see them day after day
[42:13] night after night she'd never seen it
[42:14] she was like Rahab the hallot when the
[42:16] spies came over in Joshua time she never
[42:19] said now wait this was Rahab she never
[42:21] said wait a minute let me go see Joshua
[42:24] let me see how he wears his clothes let
[42:26] me see how coms is here perhaps I'll
[42:29] I'll catch a revelation no no no let me
[42:31] see him do some Miracles she never asked
[42:33] for
[42:34] that no that's the reason she was
[42:37] justified because she accepted it by
[42:39] faith she said I have heard amen I want
[42:43] that God to be my God she heard and when
[42:47] she heard it was God's moving she know
[42:50] it was God because she'd seen a sign of
[42:52] a God that could conquer all the kings
[42:55] so she too like this this woman she
[42:58] didn't experience it herself you know
[43:00] she didn't grow up in church and see the
[43:02] Miracles around her but she heard that
[43:03] listen the god of Joshua is a powerful
[43:06] man he's a terrible man he's a man that
[43:09] could bring you the victory and she had
[43:11] faith in what she heard
[43:14] amen she said
[43:17] listen she was ready to receive it oh my
[43:20] watch what that did to Jesus he said for
[43:23] this saying for this saying see she had
[43:26] the right approach to God's gift you got
[43:28] to approach it right when you're sitting
[43:30] out there when you're in church when
[43:32] you're at the altar wherever you are
[43:34] you've got to have the right approach to
[43:36] God you got to approach him in the right
[43:39] manner Faith always admits the truth
[43:42] Martha let's speak of her for a few
[43:44] minutes Mara we always think you know
[43:47] Mara is so dilatory about getting a
[43:50] house cleaned when she was going to
[43:52] entertain Jesus talking about Mary and
[43:54] Martha they had different personalities
[43:57] had different types of relationships
[43:58] with Jesus amen let's let's speak about
[44:01] her a little bit Mary a little lazy side
[44:04] just sat around and listened Jesus of
[44:06] course said she listened to the better
[44:08] things but Martha showed her colors what
[44:12] she was what was in her heart she know
[44:15] that Jesus was the son of God she had a
[44:18] revelation of Jesus so even though she
[44:21] listening like everybody else she had a
[44:23] special revelation of who he was no
[44:26] doubt she'd read many Bible stories she
[44:29] read about the shunamite woman and how
[44:31] the woman was past the age of bearing
[44:33] she had made a little chamber for the
[44:35] prophet
[44:36] amen because she said to her husband I
[44:39] perceive that's a holy man that passes
[44:41] by our way she perceive that spiritual
[44:45] woman she said let us I pray thee make a
[44:47] little chamber on the
[44:49] side even if we not home he could access
[44:52] it she want to do do that for the
[44:54] prophet he could just go in he can have
[44:56] a key to the door and she was showing
[44:59] kindness and Elijah gave her a blessing
[45:01] and told her she'll have a son amen when
[45:04] that son took sick at about 12 years old
[45:06] he must have had a sun stroke he cried
[45:08] my head my head his father had taken him
[45:11] in took him in set him on his mother's
[45:13] lap until noon and he died so once again
[45:16] a
[45:17] scenario brought the challenge or the
[45:20] trial or the test of your faith because
[45:22] there's one thing to talk it but faith
[45:24] is not a talk thing you know faith is an
[45:26] action thing Faith requires that you
[45:28] believe and you do something you don't
[45:30] just rock back and relax right so you
[45:33] say look at the fate of that woman she
[45:36] took him and laid him on the prophet's
[45:38] bed what a place to put him see she laid
[45:41] him on that bed and she said saddle a
[45:43] mule now and don't you stop until I tell
[45:45] you stop and so she took off to the
[45:47] mountain where she where to the cave
[45:50] where Elijah was God didn't tell His
[45:52] prophets everything just what he wants
[45:55] them to know and we know that amen
[45:58] Elijah looked up and said to jasi said
[46:01] Here Comes the shunamite and she's full
[46:04] of Sorrow I don't know what it is God
[46:06] kept it from me he said is all well with
[46:10] thee is all well with thy husband is all
[46:13] well with that child look at that
[46:15] shunamite woman all is well that is Fai
[46:20] all is well it doesn't matter this is
[46:23] against the odds it doesn't matter what
[46:25] the doctors say it does doesn't matter
[46:27] what the circumstance is all is well
[46:30] because you have faith and confidence in
[46:32] the word of God and the prophets of God
[46:34] and his word
[46:37] amen she was in the presence of a man
[46:40] the agent of God the man who could
[46:42] perform a
[46:44] miracle that take the woman at her age P
[46:48] bearing and a old man like a husband and
[46:51] bless them in the name of the Lord God
[46:53] and see a vision and tell her she'd
[46:55] Embrace her child and and she did it she
[46:58] knew then that was a man of God so she
[47:01] had Faith cuz she knew it was a man of
[47:03] God she said let me go to him and when
[47:05] she got to him she said all is well amen
[47:09] all is well and then she began to reveal
[47:11] and Elijah he told to jahaz he said take
[47:14] this staff cuz Elijah know that
[47:16] everything he touched was blessed this
[47:19] is the reaction to Faith now her faith
[47:22] told her listen quot to The Prophet do
[47:25] what he said listen have confidence in
[47:28] the word of God Amen
[47:31] so jahazi then with his staff Elijah
[47:35] know that everything he touched was
[47:36] blessed now whether the woman would
[47:38] believe that or not I don't know I think
[47:41] that's where Paul being fundamental got
[47:43] the idea of laying handkerchiefs and
[47:45] aprons he took from his body on the
[47:47] people and then Elijah said take the
[47:49] staff good up thy lungs if anybody
[47:52] speaks to you don't speak back go lay
[47:55] this upon the dead baby
[47:57] this was the instruction now go lay it
[48:00] but the woman's Faith wasn't in the
[48:02] stick it wasn't about the staff you know
[48:05] it wasn't the prophet the stick never
[48:07] told her so the prophet told her so and
[48:10] she was persistent as the Lord lives she
[48:13] said and as your soul never dies I'll
[48:16] never leave you oh I like that bless God
[48:19] if the people will take a hold of the
[48:21] Holy Ghost God's agent in the Earth
[48:23] tonight and hold on to it like that I'm
[48:26] not going to turn it loose might have to
[48:28] wrestle like Jacob all night but you
[48:31] will get your request maybe Martha had
[48:34] read that story and she knowed if God
[48:37] was in that prophet and Jesus was the
[48:39] man of the hour then and surely God was
[48:42] in his son if he was in his Prophet so
[48:44] she go out to meet him and when she met
[48:47] him could have abraded him now because
[48:50] she sent for him to come remember La
[48:54] Lazarus was sick she said go call Jesus
[48:57] and Jesus said listen it's for your sake
[48:59] I'm happy I wasn't there you know
[49:01] because I want to do something I want to
[49:02] show you something I want to test
[49:04] something amen and at this point he had
[49:06] been dead for 4 days and was stinking
[49:09] and she ran out to meet him she heard he
[49:11] was coming she was so persistent she
[49:14] left the funeral procession and ran out
[49:16] to meet Jesus though he done turn her
[49:19] down she went to meet him though she
[49:21] turned though Jesus turned on her
[49:23] request to come early she ran out to
[49:25] meet him because she still had this
[49:28] level of faith when you say listen Lord
[49:31] if thou would have been here my brother
[49:33] would not have died but even now
[49:36] whatever you ask God God will give it to
[49:39] you he say I like that see though he's
[49:42] dead though he stinks yet whatever you
[49:44] ask God God will give it to you that is
[49:46] the level of faith we talking about the
[49:48] even now Faith that's not I heard about
[49:51] it you know that's I know that I know
[49:54] because I know who I speaking to I have
[49:56] confidence in the word of God and the
[49:58] word of God never fails and if the word
[50:01] of God came through his Prophet it has
[50:03] to come to pass it cannot return void
[50:08] amen now that's the way to get something
[50:10] done that's the way you con congregation
[50:14] ought to be about your pastor see that's
[50:16] when God will answer that's right you
[50:18] got to approach God's gift in the right
[50:20] way with reverence and Ministry is
[50:23] Minister gifts there gifts in the body
[50:25] five spiritual gifts that predestinated
[50:28] and for ordained of God to the church I
[50:30] know there's nine local gifts in the
[50:32] body but these are God's office gifts
[50:35] the office Apostles prophets teachers
[50:37] pastors evangelists amen and we must
[50:40] respect them if we expect something from
[50:42] God she ran right up to him and she said
[50:46] Lord if thou would have been here my
[50:48] brother would not have died but even now
[50:52] whatever you ask God God will give it to
[50:54] you I like that although the doctor said
[50:58] this so Against All Odds Against advice
[51:02] against opinions against ideas it didn't
[51:06] matter although the doctor said this the
[51:09] doctor say I got cancer but even now
[51:11] Lord the doctor say I can't get well but
[51:14] even now Lord that's it even now
[51:16] whatever you ask God he's sitting on the
[51:19] right hand of the Majesty a high priest
[51:22] that can be touched by the feeling of
[51:24] your infirmities ever living to make
[51:27] intercessions oh my own bloody clothes
[51:30] laying before the altar of God high
[51:32] priest that can be touched by the
[51:34] feeling of our infirmities your faith
[51:36] can touch him tonight he can be touched
[51:40] he can take an office in the church and
[51:42] speak right back through them lips and
[51:45] tell you exactly he do the same work he
[51:47] did when he was here on Earth he
[51:49] promised to do it he's the same
[51:51] yesterday today and forever and he's
[51:54] doing it amen Why Can't We Be persistent
[51:58] persistent willing to try time and time
[52:01] again when we think it fail certainly
[52:04] with such as that for more far more than
[52:06] she had noticed now Martha she said even
[52:09] now whatever you ask God God will give
[52:12] it to you look at that though he turned
[52:15] her down said only thing I want you to
[52:18] do is just ask prayer whatever you ask
[52:22] God God will give you so clearly the
[52:25] level of Faith you have
[52:27] is directly correlated to the response
[52:30] God will give because she was able to
[52:33] look at the scenario look at the the
[52:35] situation that was Bleak he was dead for
[52:37] 4 days and she could still say even now
[52:41] even now I never saw this happen before
[52:45] but you could do it for me I never saw
[52:47] it happen in Trinidad but you could do
[52:49] it for me I never saw it in my family
[52:52] but you could do it for me you could
[52:54] start with me even now
[52:57] I know my neighbor say I Ain going to
[52:59] make it but even now my boss may have
[53:02] ritten me off or my family but even now
[53:05] the faith I have can access the will of
[53:08] God Access the power of God Access the
[53:11] word of God and we could see a
[53:13] manifestation of that amen now I want to
[53:15] give a
[53:17] testimony a testimony I will break it
[53:20] down to make it a a little more
[53:21] palatable but I I want to testify
[53:25] here there's a message but a Brandon
[53:27] preach call a
[53:28] trial
[53:30] Amen in which as you might know in any
[53:34] trial in in a court of law you're
[53:36] allowed to bring witnesses witnesses on
[53:38] both sides the prosecution and the
[53:41] defense that's the only way you will get
[53:43] an outcome in the court so each side
[53:47] have to present their
[53:48] arguments so just ride with me a little
[53:50] bit and we want to go through a little
[53:52] bit of this I'll probably skip through a
[53:54] little bit but I think it's important
[53:56] that we understand the argument and what
[53:58] we are faced with so in paragraph 72
[54:01] brother Braham said the defense
[54:03] witnessing now is going to call his
[54:06] first
[54:07] witness now you see the prosecution like
[54:09] I identified before called his witness
[54:12] Mr
[54:13] unbelief Mr skeptic Mr impatient those
[54:17] were the witnesses for the prosecution
[54:20] now the defense witness has a right to
[54:22] call a witness as well it's only fair
[54:25] it's only reasonable that both sides
[54:27] present their valid arguments their
[54:30] valid Witnesses amen so the Holy Spirit
[54:34] has a right to call it cuz he is the
[54:37] defense witness for God's word not you
[54:40] and me the Holy Ghost is the defense
[54:42] witness for God's
[54:44] word now these men claim they believe
[54:47] but the Holy Spirit know nothing about
[54:49] it and he's the only one that could
[54:51] Quicken it it's just like your body here
[54:54] see your body is dead without the spirit
[54:56] so is the word of God dead without the
[54:58] Holy Ghost to Quicken it so we could
[55:01] just read words but listen the moment
[55:03] the Holy Spirit drop upon that and
[55:05] Quicken that word all things are
[55:08] possible there's no hindrance there's
[55:10] nothing that could stop it your unbelief
[55:13] can't stop what going to happen you
[55:15] know
[55:17] Hallelujah the spirit quickens the body
[55:20] and the Holy Ghost quickens the word you
[55:22] get you you get you get it now he ought
[55:24] to know now he's going to going to call
[55:26] the first witness let's see who he's
[55:29] going to call Noah he's going to call
[55:31] Noah Noah would stand and say in the
[55:34] days that I live was a scientific age
[55:37] kind of like now yeah a scientific
[55:42] age and he
[55:45] said we smarter than they are in this
[55:48] day and the Lord God told me there was
[55:50] going to come rain down from heaven keep
[55:52] in mind it never rained before so this
[55:54] was Noah given his testimony as witness
[55:57] number one rain was was going to form it
[56:00] had never rained you remember on Earth
[56:03] it used to get wet through irrigation
[56:05] not not rain coming from the sky amen
[56:09] say it's going to rain and going to
[56:11] destroy the world there going to come a
[56:12] great flood all over the Earth that'll
[56:14] cover and destroy it he said yet I got
[56:17] orders from God to build an ark I went
[56:20] to work on the ark showing my faith cuz
[56:23] without faith you're not building
[56:24] anything you know imagine rain never
[56:28] existed yet God tell you to build an ark
[56:30] to escape the amount of water that he
[56:33] going to pour down on you it take a
[56:35] great level of Faith that's not normal
[56:37] Faith that's specialist faith I don't
[56:40] have the words to explain the degree or
[56:42] the level but I know that's a special
[56:44] unique level not not everybody is
[56:46] qualified to handle that it never
[56:48] happened before yet I got orders from
[56:50] God to build an ark he said I went to
[56:52] work showing my faith and I believed
[56:55] what God said was the truth regardless
[56:58] of what science had to say about it
[57:00] against all talk against all opinions
[57:04] against all professional discourse on
[57:07] the matter he believed that God's word
[57:10] was the truth and he had faith in that
[57:13] right no matter what anybody else said
[57:16] it was going to rain so if there's never
[57:18] been rain up there he can put rain up
[57:21] there alella act anyhow making ready for
[57:24] it although I had that fellow on a
[57:26] witness stand here a while ago Mr
[57:28] unbeliever he scuffed at me all along he
[57:31] made fun of me and I seen Mr skeptic he
[57:34] come around and he laughed at me Mr
[57:37] impatience all of them they laughed at
[57:39] me for believing in such a miracle but I
[57:42] waited so it it it used patience it
[57:46] wasn't immediate God didn't say it will
[57:48] rain
[57:49] now he say I
[57:51] waited he
[57:53] say for 120 years as we know before it
[57:57] come but it came amen he say sit down
[58:01] witness one that's a good testimony amen
[58:04] that's brilliant good testimony that's a
[58:07] good witness to have but let's continue
[58:09] with the father of Faith Abraham he say
[58:12] witness number two bring him up we just
[58:15] been talking about it also he say I
[58:18] heard the word of God you know so so
[58:21] it's very consistent faith comes by
[58:23] hearing he hear the word of God he said
[58:26] say when I was 75 years old tell me
[58:27] something that was absolutely against
[58:30] all reasoning all there's no doctor
[58:33] there's no scientific explanation for
[58:35] why God should talk to you at 75 and
[58:37] tell you you'll be a father of Nations
[58:40] it doesn't make logical sense but you
[58:42] know
[58:43] what God is not concerned about your
[58:46] logic his thoughts higher than your
[58:48] thoughts amen he said it would have to
[58:51] be a super time super
[58:54] miracle I don't think English have
[58:56] adjectives like this a super time super
[58:59] miracle for that to happen that I was
[59:02] going to have a wife 65 years old to
[59:04] produce a son to me when she was 65
[59:07] years old we went down and we got
[59:09] everything ready you see the action
[59:11] remember faith is not talk faith is
[59:14] belief and action belief and movement
[59:17] belief and activity is something you
[59:20] could see it's something you reach out
[59:22] and grab something you touch because you
[59:24] believe and you're convinced
[59:26] enough to do something about it he said
[59:29] I told all of my friends that these
[59:32] things were going to happen after this
[59:35] had to take place because God said so he
[59:38] say I waited
[59:40] Patiently I wasn't in a rush he say I
[59:43] waited patiently the first man come
[59:44] along I asked my wife how you feeling no
[59:48] different all right I believe God anyhow
[59:52] Against All Odds his fate was still
[59:55] resting in on the word of God it was
[59:58] resting on that there was Mr unbeliever
[1:00:01] Mr scuffer Mr skeptic and all of them
[1:00:03] standing around they scuffed and they
[1:00:05] laughed at me father of Nations when I
[1:00:07] had no children and I kept believing
[1:00:10] every month every month month after
[1:00:13] month year after year de listen a decade
[1:00:17] passed and he was holding on still two
[1:00:19] decades pass and he's still holding on
[1:00:21] but he holding on stronger now because
[1:00:23] he know he much closer than when he
[1:00:25] started
[1:00:27] he said 25 years later God kept his word
[1:00:30] true it happened Abraham that's a good
[1:00:34] witness the word never said
[1:00:36] when he said he would he said I'll give
[1:00:39] you a child a son by Sarah not next
[1:00:43] month he never said next month he said
[1:00:46] he would not when they pray they shall
[1:00:49] lay hands on the sick and God shall
[1:00:51] raise them up T ye in the city of
[1:00:53] Jerusalem until you're endured with
[1:00:55] power on high not for one day not for
[1:00:58] two hours amen not 10 days 10 years but
[1:01:02] until the power comes so you still have
[1:01:05] to respond to the faith you have in the
[1:01:08] word of God in the instruction you still
[1:01:11] need to act according to that amen a
[1:01:14] real defense witness these fellows are
[1:01:16] that's two for two there's no rebuttal
[1:01:19] you can't respond to that this this is
[1:01:22] so real this is so true there's no
[1:01:24] response to it he say and all the time
[1:01:26] the odds was building up against me I
[1:01:28] like that the odds was against him he
[1:01:31] was older now 25 years older he say it
[1:01:34] was against me he said but I stayed
[1:01:36] steady because I didn't stagger at
[1:01:38] unbelief of the people I held right on
[1:01:42] and they say good Abraham sit down we
[1:01:46] can't win this case just with two
[1:01:47] witnesses you know I mean the witnesses
[1:01:49] solid you know but oh gosh let's give
[1:01:52] somebody else a chance we want to give
[1:01:55] somebody else a chance so he called
[1:01:56] Moses he said Moses listen I need to
[1:02:00] paraphrase this cuz I don't want to be
[1:02:01] too long he said Moses let's have
[1:02:04] another witness witness tree you come
[1:02:06] you share your testimony he say let's
[1:02:09] bring Moses and as you know he say he he
[1:02:12] met
[1:02:13] God a voice a pillar of fire back in the
[1:02:16] W in the wilderness it told me a
[1:02:19] scriptural voice that the hour was at
[1:02:21] hand and he heard the cries of his
[1:02:23] people remembered his promise and he was
[1:02:25] going down to deliver them and he was
[1:02:27] sending me for the job that was his
[1:02:30] mission that was his assignment now keep
[1:02:32] in mind he in the wilderness he not in
[1:02:35] the city he don't have an army he don't
[1:02:38] have bodyguards he not going in on a
[1:02:40] fighter jet right God told him this is
[1:02:44] my plan and I want you to execute it the
[1:02:47] level of Faith you need for that the
[1:02:48] kind of faith that that that may not be
[1:02:51] ARC building Fai you know that special
[1:02:54] Faith to go into Egypt which was his
[1:02:56] superpower at the time and say you're
[1:02:57] taking over and let my people go I go on
[1:03:01] he asked him for a sign and so on and he
[1:03:04] said listen when he went down he went
[1:03:08] down in the line of duty just as God
[1:03:10] told me to do Jehovah the I am told me
[1:03:14] to go down and do this sign and I took
[1:03:16] this sign down before Pastor pharaoh and
[1:03:19] I throw down my rod and you know what he
[1:03:21] tried to make it look Shady like it was
[1:03:24] some magic trick he had got some carnal
[1:03:26] impersonators to go out and mock it do
[1:03:29] the same thing but I know it was God's
[1:03:32] word and I had to come to take those
[1:03:34] children out of there no matter what
[1:03:36] taking place I still believe the word of
[1:03:39] God so I held steady with it so we see a
[1:03:42] consistent theme they all hear from God
[1:03:45] they all believe they all acted and they
[1:03:49] waited until the promise be manifested
[1:03:53] amen he said listen no matter what
[1:03:56] taking place I held steady Moses you're
[1:03:59] a real witness don't make any difference
[1:04:02] try to copy it and try you know they
[1:04:04] they they they try they try all they can
[1:04:07] they they say see it's some cheap trick
[1:04:10] it's it's bbob some mental telepathy or
[1:04:13] something I've got man here magicians
[1:04:15] can do the same that that that's that's
[1:04:17] Pharaoh's condition we could do that too
[1:04:20] we we could song like that we could
[1:04:22] preach like we could sing like that but
[1:04:24] God's word listen is eternal or no there
[1:04:27] reaches a point where you have to cause
[1:04:29] to you have a I have a reason to
[1:04:31] differentiate the wheat from from the
[1:04:34] Shao so in this case you say listen it
[1:04:38] didn't stop Moses it was the word of the
[1:04:40] Lord because it was a scriptural sign
[1:04:42] following it oh yes Mr unbelief Mr
[1:04:45] skeptic all of them H hung around my
[1:04:48] shoulders but I stayed right straight
[1:04:50] with that word knowing it was God that
[1:04:53] said the word it's God to take care of
[1:04:55] it not them he told me I was going to
[1:04:57] take those children to the promised land
[1:05:00] he told me I taken them
[1:05:02] out and I was going to come back to this
[1:05:05] mountain where it happened I don't know
[1:05:08] Pharaoh treatened my life and everything
[1:05:10] finally God overpower the enemy and I
[1:05:12] brought them through the Red Sea on a
[1:05:14] dry Ground God kept his promise and I
[1:05:17] come right straight to the mountain
[1:05:19] where he told me I would come to the
[1:05:21] same Mountain see he had believed that
[1:05:23] it was God and he held steady
[1:05:28] how much Witnesses we need we had three
[1:05:32] already let's bring witness
[1:05:35] for we will bring witness for let's look
[1:05:39] at Joshua Moses Minister listen he
[1:05:42] succeeded Moses as we know he said
[1:05:45] listen I went down there with spies I
[1:05:48] was sent out 12 of us were sent you know
[1:05:51] one out of every denomination and he
[1:05:53] said we went down there and we looked
[1:05:56] and here they come back scared and said
[1:05:58] well we look like grasshoppers up aside
[1:06:01] of them fellows you know they're greater
[1:06:04] than we are they are Mighty Men and he
[1:06:07] said at Kadesh ban I still the people
[1:06:10] said wait a minute you are looking at a
[1:06:12] giant and the opposition I'm looking at
[1:06:14] the promise of God God said I'll give
[1:06:17] you the land so once again when you hear
[1:06:20] the word of God and you know the promise
[1:06:22] for you the faith that now be churned
[1:06:26] inside allows you to act different than
[1:06:29] everybody else against the odds the
[1:06:32] level of faith is now magnified because
[1:06:35] you have confidence in the word of God
[1:06:37] you have confidence in what God said it
[1:06:39] doesn't matter how it looks to know it
[1:06:40] doesn't matter what people say and
[1:06:42] people think and they told Joshua at one
[1:06:45] point you know if you wait for the tide
[1:06:47] to change and adjust you could go over
[1:06:49] day and it'll be easy it didn't matter
[1:06:52] he said listen in three days we're going
[1:06:54] over
[1:06:55] because God said so and I believe it and
[1:06:58] I trust his word he looking at the
[1:07:01] promises of God he said there after day
[1:07:03] they come around and said where's the
[1:07:05] land where is the milk and honey Joshua
[1:07:07] they promise it too where is it at he
[1:07:09] said God will take care of it and he let
[1:07:11] them unbelievers died he kept me alive
[1:07:14] raised up another generation 40 years
[1:07:16] later we took the land because God said
[1:07:20] so amen God said I give you that land
[1:07:24] I'm promising that to to you the
[1:07:26] unbelievers could step aside because by
[1:07:29] faith you're still going to possess it
[1:07:31] amen he said and remember there was only
[1:07:34] two days journey away you know he held
[1:07:37] them back just for 40 years because of
[1:07:40] their unbelief so that that's that's the
[1:07:42] kind of faith we talking about you mean
[1:07:44] unbelief could hold you back 40 years 30
[1:07:47] years 10 years set your
[1:07:51] back your unbelief will keep it away
[1:07:54] from you as long as you live got to
[1:07:57] believe it he's a real witness Joshua
[1:08:00] yes sir they took the land 40 years
[1:08:04] later amen I need to give you one more
[1:08:08] witness because in the 20th century
[1:08:10] there was a prophet named William manam
[1:08:14] Branham he is witness
[1:08:16] five he said
[1:08:18] listen I'd like to be his next witness
[1:08:21] I'd like to put myself up basically on
[1:08:23] the witness stand cuz when on the
[1:08:25] witness stand you have to give your
[1:08:27] testimony you have to give your
[1:08:29] experience amen he said I'm his witness
[1:08:32] I want to be next I want to be fifth how
[1:08:35] can God take a cockle be and make a
[1:08:37] grain of wheat out of it a sinner come
[1:08:39] from a sinful family all of them with
[1:08:41] guns and died with their boots on boot
[1:08:43] leggers and whatever more you have why I
[1:08:46] had nothing to do with it my mother
[1:08:48] that's in glory today said the hour when
[1:08:50] I was born the angel of the Lord came in
[1:08:52] the window and stood over the Cradle
[1:08:54] where I was at am they've got the
[1:08:56] picture of it in the scientific Halls of
[1:08:58] the art of religion today it's worldwide
[1:09:01] known God promised to do these things as
[1:09:03] a little boy a voice spoke to me we
[1:09:06] could pause right there we see a
[1:09:07] consistent
[1:09:09] theme the voice of God the word of God
[1:09:13] causing you to have faith in his word
[1:09:16] we're not believing in man you know not
[1:09:18] believing in systems believing in church
[1:09:20] no the faith is tied to the word of God
[1:09:26] amen say spoke to me said don't never
[1:09:29] smoke chew or drink defile your body in
[1:09:31] any way there will be a work for you to
[1:09:34] do when you get older scared me of
[1:09:36] course what did I know about religion my
[1:09:38] people formerly were catholic how did I
[1:09:41] know anything about these things I never
[1:09:44] was in a church in my life they both
[1:09:46] married out of church so the just mother
[1:09:48] and father both was Irish so they just
[1:09:50] married out of the church and we had no
[1:09:52] religion we just live like a bunch of
[1:09:55] dogs had a little old pull about like
[1:09:57] campers from post to post wherever we
[1:09:59] could find a little Shack we could pay
[1:10:01] the rent on for3 or $4 a month that's
[1:10:04] the way where we live talk about against
[1:10:06] the
[1:10:07] ODS a little old barefooted boy packing
[1:10:10] water to a whiskey still one day when
[1:10:13] God in his sovereignty still keeps his
[1:10:17] word come down in a whirlwind and stood
[1:10:20] there and said don't do these things he
[1:10:23] said it when I became from a young man
[1:10:26] Visions begin to break over my eyes from
[1:10:28] a little bitty boy it scared me I got
[1:10:30] saved and I joined the Baptist
[1:10:32] Church talk about when there's a
[1:10:35] deep there's got to be a deep to respond
[1:10:37] you know he say I asked I told my
[1:10:40] Baptist Brethren about I guess what's
[1:10:42] going on I didn't know what to call it a
[1:10:44] vision I call it a trance and I went and
[1:10:46] said to my brethren about that they said
[1:10:48] Billy have nothing to do with that
[1:10:51] that's the devil that's the devil don't
[1:10:54] you have nothing to do with that one
[1:10:56] night at a little Camp when I was
[1:10:58] fishing way back in the mountains I was
[1:11:00] laying back there about 3:00 in the
[1:11:02] morning I seen a light coming and it had
[1:11:05] just I had just been reading the Bible I
[1:11:07] thought it was somebody coming shining
[1:11:09] through the knob hole the nut hole a
[1:11:11] lantern or something it was way way in
[1:11:14] the wilderness and I thought somebody
[1:11:16] was coming up the light was on the floor
[1:11:19] it spread greater and greater I heard
[1:11:22] somebody walking when it did it was a
[1:11:24] man he was barefooted he had hair on his
[1:11:27] shoulders and he had on a robe and I was
[1:11:30] scared it it it scared me to death he
[1:11:33] said Don't Fear I am sent from the
[1:11:37] presence of the Lord God to tell you
[1:11:40] that your peculiar life don't try to get
[1:11:43] from these things that is your calling
[1:11:47] and God will be sending you to different
[1:11:48] places all over the world to pray for
[1:11:51] the sick and if you'll get the people to
[1:11:54] believe and be sincere nothing will
[1:11:57] stand before the
[1:11:59] prayer it scared me to death certainly
[1:12:02] it did I stood there and he kept talking
[1:12:04] I said sir I am here because of those
[1:12:07] transes and things like that he said
[1:12:11] there will be three things happen first
[1:12:13] you'll know by taking your hand to hold
[1:12:14] the people then it'll come to pass after
[1:12:17] that if you sincere that you'll know the
[1:12:19] very secret in their
[1:12:21] heart and I said that's what I'm here to
[1:12:24] talk about
[1:12:25] was I my my brethren told me that that
[1:12:28] was of the devil I'm a Christian I don't
[1:12:31] want to be nothing of the devil he said
[1:12:34] as it was back there so it is now when
[1:12:37] they were arguing on what kind of
[1:12:38] buttons they should wear on their coats
[1:12:40] and things like that and the minister
[1:12:41] saying that Paul and them Ste the world
[1:12:43] upside down what was it but it was a
[1:12:46] evil spirit that said that these man are
[1:12:49] Servants of God that turned the world
[1:12:51] upside down that Paul and them said and
[1:12:53] the evil spirit testified that they were
[1:12:55] the true Servants of God you say even
[1:12:58] the devil believes and trembles you
[1:13:03] know he told me don't you remember in
[1:13:06] the scripture that's a thing our Lord
[1:13:08] did and that's what he promised he said
[1:13:10] it would happen again in the last days
[1:13:12] thought well what can that be he said
[1:13:15] well it's a spirit of the Lord Jesus he
[1:13:19] is the word
[1:13:21] am and he's promised this in the last
[1:13:23] days now don't be afraid PR I went down
[1:13:26] then to baptize a bunch of people on the
[1:13:28] river when I was baptizing there were
[1:13:31] about 5,000 people standing on the bank
[1:13:34] right in the middle of the day 2:00 in
[1:13:36] the afternoon hot they hadn't had the
[1:13:39] rain for a week or two and standing on
[1:13:40] the bank here come that Pillar of Fire
[1:13:43] whirling out of the air coming down
[1:13:45] where I was standing and the voice said
[1:13:47] as John the Baptist was sent and to
[1:13:50] forrun the first coming of Christ your
[1:13:53] message will forun the second coming of
[1:13:55] Christ the newspapers packed it and it
[1:13:57] swept into Canada on the Associated
[1:14:00] Press around the world a local Minister
[1:14:03] Baptist Minister baptizing and said a
[1:14:06] Mystic light appears over him the very
[1:14:08] one that they CAU the picture of here
[1:14:10] down it in Germany and everywhere it's
[1:14:13] done my pastor said to me he said Billy
[1:14:16] what kind of a dream did you have why
[1:14:19] you didn't know you didn't see he said
[1:14:21] there were hundred standing there
[1:14:23] witness it am witnessed it and they had
[1:14:27] come down and said oh that's a mental
[1:14:29] delusion trying his best that old man
[1:14:32] unbelief and Mr skeptic trying to step
[1:14:35] in trying to stir up doubt and and and
[1:14:38] and unbelief and Discord among you he
[1:14:41] said listen Luke the 17th chapter he
[1:14:44] promised as it was in the days of Sodom
[1:14:47] as I seen the world heaping up as it was
[1:14:50] I knew something had to come to pass I
[1:14:54] see in Malachi four where they would
[1:14:56] restore back the faith to the word that
[1:14:59] they had scattered out from I know that
[1:15:01] he had to come to pass I stayed true to
[1:15:04] the word so he was patient he waited he
[1:15:08] waited on God knowing that was the word
[1:15:10] of God he say I find Jesus Christ today
[1:15:13] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:15:16] congregation is rainning I'll stop right
[1:15:18] here I want to say this I brought all
[1:15:21] these Witnesses and my own witness many
[1:15:24] of you Witnesses this week that thing is
[1:15:27] true the message how can I Dr Davis said
[1:15:31] to me a boy a grammar school education
[1:15:33] and so on in short you a going to make
[1:15:36] much of yourself you are go amount to
[1:15:38] anything but that's just Mr skeptic that
[1:15:41] just doubt and unbelief trying to stifle
[1:15:44] the faith that God want to to charge up
[1:15:47] in you that God want to expand that God
[1:15:50] want to develop that your faith wouldn't
[1:15:52] fail that you could reach out and AC the
[1:15:55] promises that he leave for you because
[1:15:57] he spoke to you through the prophet he
[1:16:00] spoke direct to you in the word he spoke
[1:16:04] to you and left promises that only you
[1:16:06] could access but you have to hold by
[1:16:09] faith you have to grab a hole and reach
[1:16:11] out by faith knowing his word is the
[1:16:14] same yesterday today and forever and it
[1:16:16] wouldn't fail amen they say every Jury
[1:16:20] has to make up his mind he say I'm
[1:16:21] closing the court you be the judge your
[1:16:24] mind is the jury and your actions from
[1:16:26] Hereafter we lay hands on the sick and
[1:16:28] that'll spell what your verdict is the
[1:16:30] way you act after you are prayed for
[1:16:33] that will tell you your intellectual
[1:16:35] mind has been made up what the jewelry
[1:16:38] of your mind has made up that'll tell
[1:16:40] you exactly your action from herea I
[1:16:43] declare that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:16:46] yesterday today and forever I declare
[1:16:49] there is nothing can stand in his
[1:16:50] presence the men and women who believe
[1:16:53] it do do you believe it
[1:16:55] I could read the quote you could read it
[1:16:57] I could tell you where to find it and we
[1:16:59] will make no difference if you don't
[1:17:01] believe it if you don't have faith for
[1:17:03] yourself faith for your family faith for
[1:17:06] your children it wouldn't make a
[1:17:08] difference it'll just be reading words
[1:17:10] but if you could anoint that word to
[1:17:12] yourself my God nothing will stand in
[1:17:14] your way nothing will stand in the way
[1:17:17] of your prayer nothing will be
[1:17:20] impossible I'm about to wind up but I
[1:17:22] want to touch two two simple things
[1:17:25] we read the story all the time and we
[1:17:27] talk about David and and
[1:17:28] Goliad even children little children say
[1:17:32] David slay Goliath and Goliath was a
[1:17:34] giant but I I want to suggest it was a
[1:17:38] little more than that that story wasn't
[1:17:41] a a simple normal story you
[1:17:45] know it wasn't a simple normal story
[1:17:47] I'll tell you why but the brandom preach
[1:17:50] a message works his Fai
[1:17:53] expressed paragraph 1 169 it says but
[1:17:56] David now remember it was revealed to
[1:17:57] David So Revelation is important you
[1:18:01] can't deny that when it was revealed to
[1:18:03] Peter it was revealed to Peter so you
[1:18:05] need to ask God to reveal to you his
[1:18:07] word and his promises amen he said it
[1:18:10] was revealed to him he thought here is
[1:18:12] the armies of the Living God standing in
[1:18:15] their own land they're not doing
[1:18:17] anything strange and there's a boasting
[1:18:19] uncircumcised Philistine out there we
[1:18:22] call him cancer tonight we call him
[1:18:25] paralytic why David was no kind of match
[1:18:29] for him so I know we often dramatize and
[1:18:32] say you know he accustom killing bears
[1:18:34] and lions and he good with the with the
[1:18:37] slingshot and he come out and he slay
[1:18:38] Goliath but it wasn't as simple as that
[1:18:40] you know they say David was no kind of
[1:18:43] match it was against the odds that he
[1:18:46] went into
[1:18:47] battle as a matter of fact they say not
[1:18:50] with any kind of weapon he was no match
[1:18:53] so if you give him a a sword a spare I
[1:18:56] mean a harpoon whatever you try a gun he
[1:18:58] still wasn't a match against
[1:19:01] Goliath the man's shoulders was probably
[1:19:03] 10 12T across he was probably standing
[1:19:06] 14 15t High a spare like a Weaver's
[1:19:09] needle probably 20t long the blade on it
[1:19:11] maybe across 4 feet across a little
[1:19:14] David standing there with a little piece
[1:19:16] of leather goat skin or sheep skin with
[1:19:19] two pieces of string tied to it but it
[1:19:22] was revealed to him so so he wasn't
[1:19:25] acting on somebody's idea perhaps you
[1:19:27] should go and try a thing you know it
[1:19:29] wasn't that it was revealed to him and
[1:19:32] Revelation struck him amen he said God
[1:19:35] that took me out of the pors of the
[1:19:38] bear that took me out of the pors of the
[1:19:40] lion how much more will he deliver that
[1:19:43] uncircumcised Philistine in my hand his
[1:19:46] brothers were more able to do it Saul
[1:19:50] Head and Shoulders above his his army
[1:19:53] Saul was a big man Saul Head and
[1:19:56] Shoulders above his army but you see it
[1:19:58] wasn't revealed to
[1:20:00] them there it is they believe it could
[1:20:02] be done they belied that God could do it
[1:20:05] but it wasn't revealed to them but it
[1:20:08] was revealed to David
[1:20:10] amen now that's a difference right there
[1:20:13] if it's absolutely
[1:20:15] revealed to you that God is going to
[1:20:18] heal you you're going to get
[1:20:21] it that's not your brother revelation or
[1:20:24] your mother think you might be healed
[1:20:27] but God absolutely revealed to you that
[1:20:30] the Holy Ghost is yours and healing is
[1:20:33] yours my my my my my he said listen
[1:20:38] you're going to get it I don't care
[1:20:41] what's wrong with you what the odds it
[1:20:44] might be worse than David and Goliath
[1:20:45] but if it's revealed to you yes sir and
[1:20:48] notice when it's revealed David become
[1:20:51] Fearless he didn't try to put on extra
[1:20:55] body armor and and fancy gears and think
[1:20:58] well you know what perhaps I know I
[1:21:00] custom with the bear and the lion but
[1:21:01] I'll use a helmet this time because just
[1:21:03] in case I want to protect my head no he
[1:21:06] became Fearless he said today I'll cut
[1:21:09] your head
[1:21:10] off without a sword amen that's our God
[1:21:14] by grace in that crucial moment when
[1:21:16] decisions had to be made that same God
[1:21:19] that produced The Grace in that day and
[1:21:21] dropped the seed of faith in the little
[1:21:23] Hunchback looking boy being in his heart
[1:21:25] that same God in this crucial moment
[1:21:29] could take that woman from the
[1:21:32] wheelchair that man this woman the child
[1:21:35] that little grain of faith is revealed
[1:21:37] to you then I don't care how long it
[1:21:39] takes now notice the Giants on the other
[1:21:41] side the giant didn't believe it you
[1:21:43] know you see Mr skeptic will never
[1:21:46] believe it they will never believe that
[1:21:48] you have what it takes because it's
[1:21:51] against the odds you know your chance of
[1:21:54] success slim by yourself you know if you
[1:21:56] try in your own substance you wouldn't
[1:21:59] make it you will fail you will you're no
[1:22:02] much for for Satan you're no mat for the
[1:22:05] devil here born yesterday his device is
[1:22:08] real serious we have to trust in the
[1:22:12] word of God and the grace of God to
[1:22:14] bring us through the victory belongs to
[1:22:16] him he only use us you
[1:22:20] know you say listen the giant didn't
[1:22:23] believe it neither will he cancer he
[1:22:26] laughed he said am I a dog you send that
[1:22:29] kid out here to fight me said I'll pick
[1:22:32] you up on the end of my spare and let
[1:22:33] the birds eat your flesh why he had all
[1:22:36] everything for his side but you see that
[1:22:39] didn't Shake David at all that's what
[1:22:42] happen when you have a revelation when
[1:22:44] it absolutely revealed to you it doesn't
[1:22:45] matter what happened listen a thousand
[1:22:47] could fall on my right hand you know
[1:22:49] 10,000 could fall on the next side you
[1:22:50] know but you not moving because your
[1:22:53] faith listen is planted it's anchored
[1:22:57] it's
[1:22:59] solid he say it didn't Shake David at
[1:23:01] all why it was revealed to him he had
[1:23:04] faith in what he was doing he know he
[1:23:06] was going to do it and he did it because
[1:23:09] it was revealed to him and he knew where
[1:23:11] he was standing
[1:23:14] amen as we wind
[1:23:16] down this the last thought I just need
[1:23:20] to touch on this one shamba
[1:23:26] if if you're not familiar with with him
[1:23:28] there are just a couple verses in the
[1:23:29] Bible about him but there was a message
[1:23:31] brother Brandon preached called
[1:23:32] preparation where he spoke about
[1:23:34] shanga he said you know during the time
[1:23:36] of the judge judges a little old fellow
[1:23:38] named shanga he wasn't a judge he was
[1:23:41] just a little old you know not not very
[1:23:43] much was said about him a itty bitty
[1:23:45] spot but he was a special person the
[1:23:48] kind of Faith he had the kind of belief
[1:23:51] he had and this is what you call Against
[1:23:53] All Odds he wasn't a man trained in war
[1:23:56] he wasn't a mercenary he wasn't a high
[1:23:59] priest he wasn't special and say well
[1:24:00] you know what I went to military school
[1:24:02] and I came out and I'm going to use a
[1:24:05] strategic Advantage here to kill the
[1:24:08] enemy because their scenario was very
[1:24:11] unique he had a scenario in which they
[1:24:13] would
[1:24:14] plant and they would plow and they would
[1:24:16] reap and do the things that they thought
[1:24:18] they had to do and when was Harvest Time
[1:24:20] the Philistines will come and take their
[1:24:23] crops away you know how hard it is to to
[1:24:25] do that to do that once how about to do
[1:24:28] that twice imagine your plant and your
[1:24:30] weight your water your mold you watch it
[1:24:34] you fertilized I mean you you really
[1:24:36] take care of it and at Harvest time
[1:24:38] you're getting take that's not easy yeah
[1:24:41] he said listen he was just a little
[1:24:45] Israelite
[1:24:48] and he was no King he was a lay
[1:24:52] member he'd build up the crop and work
[1:24:54] hard Israel would and first thing you
[1:24:56] know when the crops got ripe they got
[1:25:00] all their wheat harvested and everything
[1:25:02] wrong come the Philistines take
[1:25:03] everything they had and go back that's
[1:25:06] the way the devil does it so even after
[1:25:09] we speak tonight you may feel inspired
[1:25:12] you may feel you know what I want to be
[1:25:13] drawn closer to God I want my faith to
[1:25:16] be strengthened I want to be able to do
[1:25:18] the things that I believe I need to do I
[1:25:21] want to hold on to God's word and accept
[1:25:23] the promises and really be able to get
[1:25:25] the victory all the time but sometimes
[1:25:28] the devil operates this way he comes and
[1:25:31] he tries to take it away just about time
[1:25:35] you get your church fixed to a place and
[1:25:36] you say well now I'm just getting along
[1:25:39] fine we're having a real oldtime Revival
[1:25:42] the devil will slip in some old crazy
[1:25:46] idea you know them people just about
[1:25:48] crazy all that stuff there's no such a
[1:25:51] thing to it cuz Dr so and so said
[1:25:55] that there's no such a thing as that but
[1:25:58] you see there came a time when shamah
[1:26:00] had
[1:26:01] enough he had enough it didn't matter
[1:26:04] that he wasn't a general or a man of war
[1:26:06] or a ranker or he didn't have a post
[1:26:08] opposition that didn't matter he had
[1:26:11] enough the position in which he was in
[1:26:13] he said listen today is the last day of
[1:26:15] tolerating this this not happening again
[1:26:19] not under my watch and in paragraph 69
[1:26:22] he said little old shanga got his right
[1:26:25] indignation up he looked around he
[1:26:27] couldn't find nothing he wasn't a
[1:26:30] warrior but what was in his hand he
[1:26:32] couldn't find nothing but a ox go you
[1:26:35] know what a ox go is it's a old stick
[1:26:38] it's got a big old brass lump on it that
[1:26:41] push the dirt off the plow and sometimes
[1:26:44] and punch the cattle through the gate
[1:26:45] with it that's all he had but it didn't
[1:26:48] matter but brother he was sick and tired
[1:26:52] of the Philistines coming taking what he
[1:26:55] had musicians could get ready he said oh
[1:26:58] my aren't you tired mother aren't you
[1:27:01] sister sick and tired of the devil
[1:27:03] telling me that I can't walk and I can't
[1:27:05] do this and I can't do that God bless
[1:27:09] your heart all things are possible to
[1:27:11] them that believe that's it shamba said
[1:27:14] I'm sick and tired of it I'm not a
[1:27:17] warrior the odds are against me no
[1:27:20] matter how much odds are against me
[1:27:23] God's for you if you take his word he
[1:27:26] said there's one thing I know I am
[1:27:29] circumcised I am an Israelite that is an
[1:27:33] uncircumcised Philistine I know that I'm
[1:27:36] right I am a child of God tonight and I
[1:27:39] know diseases come from the devil I know
[1:27:42] God promised me Victory brother I wish
[1:27:45] you felt like I did right now yes sir I
[1:27:48] feel awfully good look it's my god-given
[1:27:52] privilege I'm still tonight in America

[1:27:59] where I could preach it enjoy it thank
[1:28:01] the Lord for it his righteous
[1:28:04] indignation Rose he grabbed that o good
[1:28:07] and jumped through the window and he
[1:28:09] challenged 600 Philistines and stood
[1:28:12] there and beat their heads in right why
[1:28:15] not a warrior not at all but he was an
[1:28:18] Israelite he was circumcised and if
[1:28:20] tonight you circumcised with the Holy
[1:28:23] Ghost you don't have have to wait till
[1:28:25] you're trained to be a warrior God bless
[1:28:28] your heart claim your god-given
[1:28:30] privilege and be their heads in amen
