come inside the presence of the Lord and the Holy Ghost to change him and when I come here and I feel his presence I'm so great I am blessed maybe we cannot explain it's not necessary we just to thank you Lord for his presence tonight I want first to say thank you brother Sigma for his invitation and all his family and his church to have a burden that I know it is a great responsibility to organize this meeting and uh I know the Lord to give the brother K BR more than more that he do for us and thank you brother Sigma and thank you for all the ministry coming here to preach a word and I was blessed by everyone and every day we get uh more and more and I say just thank you my dear brothers ministers be sure I love you and thank you the congregation to come here with me and I know tonight you preach with me I'm very sorry if I speak very slowly because this not my language and sorry for my accent is terrible to H me when I speak but we not come here for my accent not for my language that I remember brother Bram pray for the little girl and and and they calling interpreted but when brother bam start to pray for her and she say I understand that brother bam say if you preach by the Holy Ghost everybody knows that you say and please we can take your Bible in the first book of Corinthian the first book of Corinthian uh chapter 2 verse 1 to 5 and I BR when I come to you come not with the Excellency of speech of or wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God for I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of men's wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God dear heavenly father we pray in your precious name Jesus Christ that tonight we need your presence here that the prophet say we can come on the pulpit and say thousand words and nobody can to be blessed but if Jesus Christ come down and say one word everybody to be blessed dear Lord put me out I confess I'm nothing I'm zero you are the important person here you can open your word and down by your Holy Spirit and know each art each needs and we pray for all every person here need your presence need the Deliverance need to be healed in the the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you can be SE brother and sister I want to preach tonight my subject the glory of the calvary and I like to observe people I like to know my day and my message at the brother bam say all peop on the earth they want to know the past and the future but they don't know today and we cannot believe in the historical Jesus we believe in the present God in the Living God am and this is my burden tonight that I see we come here brother and sister this is not my talent to preach like this for the people of God and in the big congregation but I see everywhere I go all everybody touched by the Lord when they come in a meeting they touched by the Holy Spirit they touched by the message and they want to serve the Lord and they are siner but until when they leave the church everything change they return the same person with the same character I'm sorry maybe after the sermon tonight maybe you can never love me the same way that you love me before I preach but brother bam come he say I love you but not too much like you s because I I love him more than you and I hope for you the same you love him more than me and brother and sisters we are very close and this is the last time to prepare for the raptures is if you miss this ruptures all things that you do is for nothing I want to just to give you encouragement and this message is a living message and the calvary for many peoples just to he the name is calvar you can understand when you heard the word Calvary you know the calvary means the crucifixion you know the calvary mean the Christ paid the price for you and the brother preach in the message uh the position is in Christ the message adoption in 1960 May 22nd he say if God save you one time you can never lose it's not necessary every day people to repeat you you ask save if he already save you one time the word unve is not existence he save you he love you and brother say he love you more than he love him you are very important for him and he say when he go on the calvary everybody leave him and he go for him and he go alone in the calvary and he say this not the the the the nails to fix him on the cross he says the love because he love you he stay on the cross what's about you and me that I want to preach tonight it is the glory of the calvary May Lord to help us tonight if your life is said if in your life you can see you are never get success if your life you see something wrong you can never overcome a new you miss something I just to want to give you encouragement tonight come with me on the calvary keep your cross stay in your cross and when we stay in your cross all your opinion change I you see the people different way you speak a different way because you stay on the cross no by force nobody Force you because you see on the calvary this is a glorious place for you that's everywhere I go that I can discern we have too much religion myself brother sisters I I have a religion in my heart for 100 years but is not enough for me I Want More Jesus in my life that's my Doctrine is not enough I Want More Jesus in me not Jesus in the past in the present time now not when I come in the church not when I come in the pulpit but I want every Sinners the hope for the Salvation they can see Jesus Christ in you praise God tonight that Paul say when I come to you come not with Excellency not by a spirit of superiority that brother bam say he say don't be a complex for you and don't be a complex for another one I know and I believe in this message this message is too much power not to push you to change the church change your religion but he has enough powers in this message to change my character when I came to confess and I came to believe 100% when you came to believe 100% you are nothing is important all Ministries come here and the Holy Ghost come here each night each morning touch my heart touch your heart when we leave this gate we are the complex I cannot believe that brother sister we must to stay in a peaceful spirit that I want to read some portion of the brother Bram preach about the the this day on the calvary he say the calvary is the more important things appear on the earth praise God you know I like myself to preach all the mystery of God the seven Trumpets the Seven Seals the seven tenders all the mystery the son of man all all all the Revelation that brother bam preach I like it I need to he we need that but if the seal is open I believe that but if my character is never changed why the seal is open in the hand time that people need to see you and me as a living God God in flesh God today not the god yesterday is not important to do many many things but if you stay on your cross on the calvary that brother but I'm say every day every day you must return on Calvary look the prophet brother br he work with the angels he he he work with the pillar of the fire is the prophet messenger confirmed by God but one day when a storm come in the mountain and brother B Paul and and and sister made us stay in a car what he say he tried to confess God you know is a best uh um shooter you say nobody like me in the message of guide he preach that in the message guide we need this guide I need him tonight for all my situation and when he start to confess Lord save my son and save my wife I am nothing and the Salvation down I am here [Applause] now the dynamic down the Holy Spirit down when he confess he is a prophet who I am to compare to him why is why many people fails and and and try to do the best but every time fails and fails and fails there's many reason but one reason that you think you are you are someone important you can but you fails God wait when you repent that I speak when when brother here I said brother and everybody here everybody here Believers make Believers Sinners everybody hears 100% I believe they are more great than me I am nothing that this is my prayer every day God keep me in this atmosphere to see my brothers my sisters everybody they are more important like me I am nothing because this is the reality brother you love him tonight if you want you can stay all the time can repeat the message we can repeat the message come a church and repeat the message oh this is not the problem for the Devils I do that myself for years and years and years but one day somebody must to say you something I go through the experience because brother bam say the Holy Ghost is the experience it's not the CH I go myself in the experience and one day in in in um many years ago one day my wife come to me say me you are not the Believers you are not the Christian you I cannot see you like a Christian we need somebody sincere to say you the truth amen and I say yes darling you are you are right I never smoke I never lie I never steal something I never adultery I never do something wrong but she said me I see you like a sinner why because you become Pride you become selfish you become lazy and I Repent yes I play change me Lord after many years in the message that the message the church age book that brother bam say you can come on a church you can you can read a book you can read the Bible you can preach you can do everything this is not a problem for the Devils there only one thing the devil is fear when you cach a revelation in this book when you know your [Applause] position and you are satisfied to your position never complained if God put you under zero say praise Lord because if you put you somewhere this is the best position for you he knows the position that you must be praise God how you tonight I'm sorry brother the sigma sometime I preach too long five six hours in the message church now you preach 45 minute everybody sleep because we we are born in a message we are already baptized we are the pictures of brother branam we have a nice pastor and 45 minute enough we return in a denomination Spirit when I preach in a denomination that the pastor put me a limit say brother just 20 minutes but I know I cannot preach 20 minutes after 20 minutes and we go in the parking everybody in a denomination to smoke a cigarette they speak about the politic for many hours they speak about this the TV about the radio about something wrong and the sense Spirit return like I see myself I preach for the Catholic I was a Catholic myself all my family from the Catholic and the Catholic spirit is very terrible I never went back there brother I preach for the in Waris and Futuna this is a Catholic more than the Vatican when I see the Mage Church sleeping I am shame every day we preach four five six hours you sit in the comfortable seats you have many put you comfortable here but there people sit on the ground and one day I finish to preach and I go to speak the I see we who is a person the M holder and I look the lady she had 80 years old I ask her I sit on the ground with her and I ask her mom mom what is your age he said me son 80 I ask after I preach against your religion for 5 hours are you tired they say me me never that's not depend the preacher do depend the spirit in you if you are SE for the this message this message is Urgent Message we don't know tomorrow is not for you tomorrow now is for you that's I say brother and sisters I get this occasion to be blessed by by Sigma to last year before he organizes meeting we traveling together from Switzerland to he to his place in Germany and we traveling and he say me brother Alex I want to have a convention for the young people receive the Holy Ghost I say brother this is good ideas because I see all too much young people they need they need this convention oh I can help you that the brother say when you are the pastor when you are the preacher you can put your knee on the ground and pray God give me the message for this people that brother bam say and that I try to do that's this time that brother and sister be satisfied tonight be satisfied your position be satisfied for everything you receive from God and say him all time thank you Lord that you look at Lucifer that brother say he lose his position because he's never satisfied I don't want be like him I want to be like Jesus look our Master Our Savior Jesus Christ look his Simplicity when he speak for the 10 lepers that's is this is a power message and simple message but when they got this message they are heal Jesus Christ is my example I want to be the preacher like him in the Simplicity he say go to the sacrific only this no emotion brother and sister because in this time we received a message for today not for tomorrow that Paul say Brethren I when I come to you come not with the Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God that the one brother preached he say preach your life Don't Preach that another another another person say have your experience say Lord Use Me Lord and Lord to use you I'm sure it need the body to get a manifestation in your body but just say Lord Use Me Lord praise God no by a superiority spirit Spirit of superiority to kill everybody this is not the message brother and sister when I start to preach a message I like the message pure I like the message pure you two and I start to preach but with a legalist spirit with a legalist Spirit nobody receives the Holy Ghost and the Bible says only the Lambs is worthy and if God give you the same character of the Lamb of God you can change many situation in in your life in your family in your church amen preach with your life and preach with love sometime myself we preach a great Revelation but sometime the Church need to heard you say I love you church I need you church we are one this is encouragement for them they know you pray for them you love them and they they are they get the vision as a Calvary is important brother and sister is this brother say it is every day every day every day you m back we M back together on Calvary in the message the world is again falling apart in 1963 November 27 brother bam say we see the nation breaking and Israel awaking the sign that this Bible for told for this day we see the mechanical things taking place now the spirit the Dynamics of the promised world to get into this his church and drive into Calvary Wonder Yonder and to the raptures and there we are that's few days ago I go around the garden here when I pick one flower the lavender and I smell and then my wife say me there no fragrance I say it's very strange just laender no fragrance but when I take this lavender and I bruise between my finger and I see the the fragrance coming stronger more you bruising me stronger that I remember that brother bam say everybody here God put a talent in you God put a talent in me and God want to use this talent for his glory but what do Talent come by success when you bruise you on the calvary and your your the best of you come the best of me coming because Holy Ghost down and broke your selfish and lies with this fragrance the Dynamics start down and you start to serve the Lord a different way not by the religion spirit not by force but where you go where you go people can see Jesus Christ in you praise God we are not I don't criticize the Jehovah Witness we are not a Jehovah Witness we are not the moment to go door after door to give them the books and the books and the books and the books and the books they can read the books to brother bam and they can to can discern this man is a real Prophet maybe this message is true but what about you when we compare the life of Elijah we compare the life of Jesus Christ and I compare my life what people think about me that Paul say for I determinate not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you in the weak in a weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit of owers that brother say in the hand and times the great power of the Holy Ghost to become very very very very simple I say the millions people to miss to recognize this great power praise God you are here that is important we cach your Revelation you know your time you know your season you know your calling you know your position you know Christ in you is not a religion Spirit but is a real manifestation that people can see you believe in the Living God don't try to explaining and explaining people this message don't try to explaining explaining the Bible don't try explaining nothing just say Christ I come with you on the calvary kill my opinion kill all of my IES kill all my my selfish the problem is not the message the problem is not the Bible the problem is me the first preacher come to explaining the message is the serpent God come in a Simplicity his word to reveal in you praise God that I say when you come on the calvary when Jesus is in the calvary is not the nails to fix him on the cross because he love you and he love me and if he go in the calvary we get the Same Love and when you look people now you can never criticize them you just love them maybe they are too much different Doctrine too much different to you maybe they can to criticize you let me say you something if you want growing growing growing growing in this message you need people to criticize you you need the persecution that's right that's right you need the tribulation in your life to let you grow in yes that I see I preach from my life brother I Don't Preach for another Brothers I preach for me if you are with me you can to identify yourself in this message that I say and when I crucify myself all my opinions and now I CAU a revelation that brother bam say he say many people criticize brother Bram and he say I need that and he say people criticize Jesus Christ and he say he need that and I say for me now I need that because this is a real crucifixion when you see in the calvary in the cross Jesus brother bam say is completely naked he says the Catholic put something to to to hiding but when we become sincere and crucified everything in you everything about you is open for the public all your private life is finished but when you when you do that they glow you [Applause] down that's people say to brother Bram and and and they put an article in a newspaper to criticize him and one brother come speak to brother hey you are Elijah you are the prophet look that they put in newspaper the wrong news about you if you are Elijah you can go there and curse this place and the fire down and to come to to to burn them and brother said say this is not my call God never call him to curse people if you curse people this message is not for you you are never anointing for this message maybe for another place but not for the message God bless you that I say my myself because Holy Ghost is experience I cannot preach the experience for another brother I preach my experience you preach your experience everybody preach your experience when I was a a a new preacher I just to preach a pure message to brother Bram and I I sing my myself I am a good preacher because I want everything order everything CLE Everything clean everybody like me that when you growing in a message that's brother what I'm say he said the problem with the people the S when you come in a message all your problem is finished and the brother B say

and I am nothing brother say without him without him we are no s he say never forget this never forget this everything you do without him we are nothing all the glory is for him but God have patience with me and he prepare me and I asked me the question all my life for many years in the message where is the fruit like brother bisol preach like everybody Preach Air like the team put preach that one

some exhalation until now until now the voice of brother Bram the voice in the tips the voice in the deeps is always [Applause] anointing every time you preach this message every time you mention word to word that bre preach and if you are sincere and the supernatural down because when brother preach the sermons and the supernatural down and the same situation repeat all time all time you preach brother say thank you Lord exactly that he say be sure Holy Ghost down to confirm this is the voice of the Seven Angels this is the voice of Malachi 4 this is the voice of Elijah I've been in another Village in new calonia one day we preached in a certain time in a in a village and one brother I already baptize him and his wife and he just got the message and he just the new Believers for the message and he come for the meeting every night we have meet him and he come he say brother Alex the the god of brother Bram and the god that you preach and the God that I believe can he heal every sickness I say yes and he repeat again can him heal every sickness I I say sure brother I believe this this message for me is a supernatural message this message is anointing H you say me brother why I say you that because in this village where you go to preach tonight there is a ladies she's very sick she got a cancer covered by the cancer and she leaves the hospital and she stay few days to stay alive and after she die and and the doctor say we can do nothing for you back to your home and and prepare you and prepare your family and say your husband in a few day you are finished and you repeat again brother Alex can I invite this ladies to come and are you sure this message AB enough power to Healing all bodies I say brother I believe 100% this message is anointing this message is Supernatural when this start a meeting when I look around I don't see this lady and I ask him brother John where is this ladies that you say me she is sick he say no she's very very sick she cannot stay in the congregation she she is back in in the bedroom and the bed I said brother no Faith come by hearing I say please take the sister put her in the front and she comes in the front with many blanket she she was very weak oh she cannot speak she cannot add nothing she cover head and and she stay like this and with start to preach the message slowly slowly she removes the blanket on her slowly slowly she sit normally slowly slowly she sit quiet after the meeting before we pray for her she's more strong when we close the meeting we just pray a simple prayer for her and she walk normally and sister don't only preach the message but believe that you preach it's easy to say brother but I'm say the brother but I'm say Jesus say and Jesus say but believe the Supernatural is in this message all time every time you speak about this Prophet every time you speak about the Malachi 4 every time you speak the supernatural down but crucified your opinion let's say God no no no no I fix my eyes on Jesus I fix my eyes in This Promise God I believe in your prophet and I believe this message in a supernatural message and you see all your problem gone when she leave the meeting and she come the meeting she cannot walk when she leave the meeting she walks when she back home Che which doctor to wait her on the door he say hey we are here to you he said you are here to me the true witch doctor say yes you are sick we need to do something for you and this lady say no I am healed now and the witch doctor they sing they sing the another witch doctor to do something for her they

lot of testimony thousand that I give you encouragement Don't Preach something for tomorrow please don't believe something for tomorrow he is the same yesterday today and forever that brother say many people Miss to know Jesus Christ in his in the in their time when he they speak to Jesus say we know Elijah must come first and Jesus Jesus say Elijah is already come and he already go and you don't know and brother abam say one day one day you come in church and you read the book to brother Bram and you read about the Rapture but you don't know the Rapture is [Applause] finished because you

of the Living God and in you can see in brother Alex's heart there's that burden for lost souls I told a brother this the other day I said brother if you if there's any Revelation that you get that takes away from the burden of lost souls then it's a wrong Revelation we've got to sigh and to cry we've got to try to find that last Fallen son or daughter of God and I'm speaking for myself I've got to have a greater burden you know we talk about how how wonderful it is in church and everything but we go out of here Sinners all over the place God help us to live in that atmosphere so that we can be directed by the Holy Spirit to be an example of this gospel that we believe isn't that the burden on your heart tonight I don't want a lot of head knowledge I want my heart to be led by the Holy Spirit of the Living God oh help me father I'm thankful for the message tonight you're [Applause] thankful that's rugged [Applause] [Music] Christianity amen I have a prayer re uh request here from Nathaniel Lori shalom Bri of Christ I have a prayer request for my grandmother Marcel Joseph she had surgery and she suffers since that moment she has many problems because of her age but I believe that he is the great doctor and he will heal her God bless you amen so let's take this uh prayer request to the Lord and I'm taking my own heart to the Lord and ask him please father give me a greater burden amen you want a greater burden you want a burden like that Prophet had amen do you realize that uh I think one of the brothers said it uh earlier in the week that he had gotten a complex and he wanted to pull away and become a Trapper but then the Holy Spirit the angel of God came to him and told him to go back out to those ones that he would refer to as Rick Ricky and so forth and the people in the street and whatnot told them go back out after them my Prophet died on a Texas Highway going out after the Lost we don't want to just be cloistered in our little church with our little group and that's it no we've got to have a burden like brother Alex has amen so I'm asking God to give me a greater understanding a greater burden amen for the lost or for whatever the situation is right we want to be missionaries we can start right in our own house amen so let's take this prayer request to the Lord Almighty God thank you for your word tonight Lord and thank you for the testimony and the message that we receive this evening thank you for our brother Lord we ask God's blessing upon Him upon his life uh Lord may you continue to lead him by the spirit Lord uh wherever he would be led father I know that he's your son and you lead him into places that perhaps no one else could go but father he's being led by the spirit so I thank you for him and ask you bless him and
