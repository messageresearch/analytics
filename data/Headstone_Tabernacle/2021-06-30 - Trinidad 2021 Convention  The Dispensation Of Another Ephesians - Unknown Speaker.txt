64 And Joshua could not at all become into his ministry until after Moses was gone. So you see the very first verse here, “Moses My servant is dead; now arise and take this people to the promised land.” Moses, representing the law, had served its time. It’s, the law had served its time.        

66 So there was Joshua, representing grace, was right along with law, but could not be enforced as long as law was in its proper place.

67 And...
