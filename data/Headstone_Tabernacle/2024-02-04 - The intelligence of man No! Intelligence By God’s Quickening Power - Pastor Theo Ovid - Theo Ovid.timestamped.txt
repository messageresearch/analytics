[45:24] 1-8 Revelation 20 to 17 for scripture
[45:27] reading this morning
[45:30] H Genesis 11 reading from verse
[45:34] 1 and Whole Earth was of one language
[45:38] and of one speech and it came to pass as
[45:40] the journey from the East that they
[45:42] found a Plaine in the land of Shah and
[45:44] they dwelt there and they said one to
[45:46] another go too let us make brick and
[45:48] burn them thoroughly and they had brick
[45:51] for stone and slime had they for morar
[45:54] and they said go to
[45:56] let us build a city and a tower who stop
[46:00] May reach into heaven and let us make us
[46:03] a name least we be scattered abroad upon
[46:07] the face of the whole earth and the Lord
[46:10] came down to see the city and the tower
[46:13] which the children of men build it and
[46:16] the Lord said behold the people is
[46:19] one and they have all one language and
[46:23] this they begin to do and
[46:26] now nothing will be restrained from them
[46:30] which they have imagined to do and the
[46:33] Amplified that verse reads and the Lord
[46:35] said behold they are one people and they
[46:39] have all one language and this is only
[46:42] the beginning of what they will do and
[46:45] now nothing they have imagined they can
[46:47] do will be impossible for them verse
[46:52] seven go to let us go down there
[46:56] and confound their language that they
[46:59] may not understand one another's speech
[47:01] so the Lord scattered them abroad from
[47:04] dense upon the face of all the Earth and
[47:07] they left off to build the city
[47:09] therefore is the name of it called
[47:11] Babel because the Lord did there
[47:13] confound the language of all the Earth
[47:16] and from then did the Lord scatter them
[47:18] abroad upon the face of all the Earth
[47:21] Philippians chapter 2 reading from verse
[47:24] one
[47:26] if there be any if if there be therefore
[47:29] any consolation of in Christ if any
[47:31] comfort of love if any Fellowship of the
[47:34] spirit if any bows of mercies fulfilling
[47:36] my joy that he be likeminded having the
[47:39] same love being of one Accord of one
[47:41] mind let nothing be done through Strife
[47:43] or vain glory for in loneliness of mind
[47:46] that each esteem the other better than
[47:48] themselves look not every man on his own
[47:51] things but every man also on the things
[47:52] of others let this mind be in you which
[47:56] was also in Christ Jesus who being in
[47:57] the form of God taught it not rby to be
[48:00] equal with God but made himself of a no
[48:02] reputation took upon him the form of a
[48:05] servant and was made in the likeness of
[48:07] men and being found in a fashion as a
[48:09] man he humbled himself and became
[48:11] obedient unto death even the death of
[48:13] the cross our last scripture is
[48:16] revelation
[48:17] 22:17 and the spirit and the bright say
[48:20] come let him that hear say come let him
[48:23] that at thirst come and whosoever will
[48:27] let them take the Word of Life free
[48:28] let's bow our heads with a prayer
[48:30] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[48:31] word we thank you for what is written
[48:34] what is spoken what is heard tonight and
[48:37] I pray that you would come in a special
[48:38] way and break the bread of life to us
[48:40] bring Clarity of understanding and most
[48:43] importantly stir our hearts Lord there's
[48:46] a need for heart stirring where men and
[48:49] women get right with God granted father
[48:51] in Jesus name I ask it amen you may be
[48:53] seated amen
[48:56] oh praise
[49:01] God it's a blessing and a privilege to
[49:05] be here this morning
[49:06] am and I consider it deeply so even in
[49:11] the light of what is Upon Our Hearts to
[49:14] share with you this
[49:18] morning I have a
[49:21] title the intelligence of man no the
[49:25] intelligence by God's quickening
[49:29] power that's the title this
[49:32] morning a subject
[49:36] intelligence and have an inspiration let
[49:39] this mind be in you that was in
[49:43] Christ and if ever there was an hour
[49:46] where this scripture carries a weight is
[49:49] this time I know you might have heard it
[49:52] before and we have all heard it before
[49:55] but I want want you to pay close
[49:56] attention this morning let this mind be
[49:58] new that was in Christ and you see why
[50:01] Paul said that other context scripture
[50:04] from Daniel 12 and reads verse one at
[50:06] that time shall Michael stand up the
[50:08] great pains which stand it for the
[50:10] children of thy people and there shall
[50:11] be a time of trouble such as never was
[50:13] since there was a nation even to the
[50:15] same time and at that time thy people
[50:18] shall be delivered everyone that shall
[50:20] be found written in the
[50:23] book many of them that sleep in the the
[50:25] dust of the Earth shall awake so when
[50:28] you dead yet done yet this is the
[50:30] scriptures now many of them that sleep
[50:33] in the dust of the Earth shall awake
[50:34] some to everlasting life some to shame
[50:38] and everlasting contempt so what do me
[50:41] here go me it de if you don't get it
[50:45] right and they that be wi shall shine as
[50:48] the brightness of the firmament and they
[50:50] that turn many to righteousness as the
[50:52] Stars forever and ever but thou Daniel
[50:55] shut shut up the words and sealed the
[50:56] book even until the time of the end many
[50:59] shall run to and fro and knowledge shall
[51:03] be
[51:05] increased now we know all what you see
[51:07] around here was here since Adam
[51:10] time did you know that because all what
[51:13] you see here now had the
[51:16] material since Adam time man take what
[51:20] is on the earth and develop it in what
[51:22] you see
[51:23] here there's nothing new
[51:26] H all what they have developed is was
[51:29] already here in the earth it just it
[51:32] wasn't discovered at that time isn't
[51:34] that right intelligence the ability to
[51:38] acquire and apply Knowledge and Skills
[51:42] so knowledge and intelligence is not the
[51:43] same thing you ever hear about educated
[51:47] fools that book sense but not real
[51:50] intelligence am so we're not talking
[51:54] about just knowledge
[51:55] but intelligence the ability to acquire
[51:59] and apply Knowledge and Skills it come
[52:00] like wisdom wisdom is how to use
[52:02] knowledge so a lot of people have the
[52:04] information but they don't have the
[52:06] ability to express to unfold to have
[52:10] wisdom to operate this thing called
[52:12] knowledge another intelligence has been
[52:14] defined in many ways the capacity for
[52:16] abstraction logic understanding
[52:18] self-awareness learning emotional
[52:20] knowledge reasoning planning creativity
[52:23] critical thinking problem solving it can
[52:25] be described as the ability to perceive
[52:28] or infer information and to retain it as
[52:31] knowledge to be applied to AB adaptive
[52:33] behaviors within the environment or
[52:36] context
[52:38] intelligence you could tell somebody
[52:39] that's an intelligent boy intelligent
[52:42] girl intelligent company the word
[52:44] intelligence derives from the Latin
[52:46] nouns intelligentia and intellectus
[52:49] which in turn stem from the verb
[52:51] intellig to
[52:53] comprehend or to perceive
[52:58] Isaiah 211 and2 says the burden of dumer
[53:02] he called me out of sea Watchman what of
[53:06] the night the Watchman said the morning
[53:08] cometh also the night if he will inquire
[53:11] inquire he come and we find out he was
[53:14] asked what of the night but he said the
[53:16] morning

[53:19] before the BR break of dawn it's become
[53:22] extremely dark isn't that right yes sir

[53:27] spirit is the Watchman am who is making
[53:29] ready the people and giving warnings
[53:32] from God who give warnings from God hly
[53:35] Spirit the Holy Spirit you see see how
[53:38] it different from the Modern Day Gospel
[53:41] no warning you'll be blessed too blessed
[53:42] to be stressed and all the little
[53:44] Kentucky fight chicken thing now but
[53:46] there not what we talking about here now
[53:48] the holy spirit is the Watchman who
[53:50] making the people ready giving warnings
[53:53] from God hallelujah so it's not we
[53:55] trying to frighten you we giving you the
[53:58] word and the word is the word is shout
[54:02] it out the word is God not your feelings
[54:04] the word is God want to know who God is
[54:07] check the word he is being set as a
[54:10] Watchman we see the sick being healed
[54:12] blind eyes opening up deaf ears
[54:14] unstopped cripples walking the lame
[54:15] leaping like a heart what is it is the
[54:18] coming of the Lord Jesus pressing on the
[54:21] come of the Lord pressing on and all
[54:23] these things and These Warnings and
[54:24] people continue press right on through
[54:26] their beer parties until their times of
[54:28] folly and their Frolic and they dance
[54:31] they eat they drink they marry give in
[54:33] marriage God said it would be no way
[54:34] stopping them not even notice in this
[54:36] great church age according to Revelation
[54:38] three this age now the one that was
[54:40] given the morning start just before that
[54:42] coming now watch anyone knows just
[54:44] before the break of day just at the
[54:47] hours of the approaching of day it turns
[54:49] darker than it ever was oh friends
[54:52] listen to thus sayith the Lord if you
[54:54] consider need to be a servant it is just
[54:57] before the break of day that is why this
[55:00] horrible Gloom is over the Earth it is
[55:03] just before the coming of the Lord Jesus
[55:05] there is no more hope left in nothing
[55:07] but his coming nations are against
[55:10] Nations they have fooled through God's
[55:14] laboratory till they got the power to
[55:18] blow one another into Atomic ashes and
[55:21] they are wicked and they are unreligious
[55:24] and they are un Christlike and the only
[55:28] motive they have and the objective is to
[55:31] destroy and they are
[55:33] inspired by the destroying angel that
[55:36] was sent from heaven to inspire these
[55:39] men so you watching governments you
[55:42] watching uh issues and Wars but what you
[55:45] don't see is the spirit that is behind
[55:49] them and I want to so I hope this
[55:51] message wake you up that you are not
[55:53] living a natural life life if you living
[55:56] an ordinary life going to work going
[55:58] home buying food buying groceries paying
[56:00] your bills wake up it is much more than
[56:03] that there is Spirit behind everything
[56:07] and there's a war on
[56:09] you on your mind on your house on your
[56:14] family on your home on your body on your
[56:19] spirit and on your
[56:21] [Applause]
[56:23] soul
[56:25] sickness doesn't come from God sickness
[56:28] come from the devil we are under attack
[56:31] in your
[56:32] body Hallelujah depression doesn't come
[56:34] from God frustration doesn't come from
[56:37] God that come from the devil you are
[56:39] under attack in your
[56:40] [Applause]
[56:47] spirit let me see this you may be in the
[56:49] name of the Lord Jesus the Holy Spirit
[56:52] was sent as a Watchman on the Tower and
[56:54] the people say what of the night are you
[56:56] wary of this life are you wary of sin
[57:00] are you wary of funeral possessions and
[57:02] sickness and ungod in every hand has the
[57:04] night been long and wary he said the
[57:06] morning cometh see the Comfort the night
[57:08] is also coming oh my Hallelujah so it's
[57:12] the approaching of the Lord Jesus
[57:14] bringing the Gloom upon the Earth
[57:16] because as the press as the light come
[57:18] it conses it presses the
[57:20] darkness Bible is say cross Darkness
[57:23] cover the Earth cross Darkness cover the
[57:25] people as the light is coming and
[57:26] pushing Darkness so the world have to go
[57:29] through this darkness before the light
[57:30] break
[57:32] out the Earth she knows that her time of
[57:36] Deliverance is at hand and that's the
[57:38] reason she's so nervous frustrated as
[57:40] she is because there's an hydrogen bomb
[57:42] missiles of the air that could destroy
[57:44] the whole world one nation is scared of
[57:46] the other no matter how little it is
[57:48] they got those missiles that they claim
[57:49] with just one of them they can direct
[57:51] them by the stars now this was something
[57:54] when I was studying this he said they
[57:56] can direct them by the stars and I
[57:59] believe he saw something I believe he
[58:02] was maybe referring to satellites to
[58:04] what is up there because what they have
[58:06] the technology they have right now that
[58:08] could guide what is coming down
[58:13] here they got these missiles one of them
[58:16] they can direct them by the stars and
[58:18] drop them anywhere in the world they
[58:21] want
[58:22] to and Russia I heard on the news she
[58:25] claims she can destroy this nation and
[58:27] keep the atoms and things from breaking
[58:28] up of this nation or they have a weapon
[58:30] now it could bomb blow up kill the
[58:32] people in it and leave the building
[58:34] intact did you hear
[58:36] that did you hear what they have now
[58:39] they have one that when it explode the
[58:41] raay or something so would pass through
[58:43] all the concrete and what not kill the
[58:44] people on the inside and leave the
[58:46] building intact so they still keep the
[58:49] building then he says science has broken
[58:51] the God's Great
[58:53] laboratory Hallelujah they wasn't
[58:55] invited in they didn't get knock and
[58:56] come in they break into there until
[58:58] they're going to destroy themselves God
[59:01] lets always lets wisdom destroy himself
[59:06] God doesn't destroy anything man destroy
[59:08] himself by wisdom so they get so wise
[59:11] that they get
[59:13] stripped they get so wise that the
[59:15] wisdom bring them into
[59:17] foolishness praise God this is a prayer
[59:20] but ra is praying are we awake
[59:23] tonight he said de God we stand here

[59:57] hell not a man begging in front of his
[59:59] house he end up in heaven we know the
[1:00:02] story he said we see the example of two
[1:00:04] men one of them being a religious man

[1:05:45] amen and in one sense of the word he is
[1:05:48] a Son of God fallen from Grace he is
[1:05:51] Fallen away from what God made him to be
[1:05:53] and in his Fallen estate give him
[1:05:58] attributes to try to do something to
[1:06:01] bring himself back up to a place where
[1:06:04] something inside of him tells him that
[1:06:05] he come
[1:06:07] from because he knows he's not in the
[1:06:09] right condition
[1:06:11] yet because you see death sickness
[1:06:15] Sorrows heartaches and disappointments
[1:06:18] he knows he wasn't made for
[1:06:20] that so that's how everything comeing
[1:06:22] fancier and nicer I was studying how
[1:06:24] they doing what they call 3D printing
[1:06:26] they could they could actually print a
[1:06:28] 3D organ in your
[1:06:31] body and then the excess of that
[1:06:33] printing thing that they create in his
[1:06:35] body they could take out by
[1:06:39] chemicals they're creating hearts and
[1:06:40] stuff and thing now
[1:06:42] you because man has broken into the
[1:06:44] God's laboratory they trying to get to
[1:06:46] the place where they where they get to
[1:06:47] let us make man another
[1:06:50] man all right here go yet no matter how
[1:06:54] far he's away from God there is
[1:06:57] something inside of him that tells him a
[1:07:00] man is made up of Body Soul and Spirit
[1:07:03] five gates of the body see taste smell
[1:07:05] feel and hear and inside the spirit you
[1:07:07] know his conscience memory affection
[1:07:08] reasoning and so
[1:07:10] on now it's what is the spirit is what
[1:07:14] control the rest of it there's only one
[1:07:15] Avenue to that that is self-will that's
[1:07:18] why you have to make decisions has to be
[1:07:20] your choice and your will you could
[1:07:22] determine to serve the Lord could turn
[1:07:24] in no money woman in popularity and go
[1:07:26] go go throw you down I was determined
[1:07:28] that after I 17 years old and I saw just
[1:07:31] three things and those three things is
[1:07:32] money woman and popularity it's not it's
[1:07:35] not 10 things everything connected to
[1:07:36] those three things and those three
[1:07:38] things connected to the test that Jesus
[1:07:39] had lust of the eyes lust of the Flesh
[1:07:41] and the pride of life it's just three
[1:07:43] things lust of the flesh with woman
[1:07:46] pornography filth whatever it is lust of
[1:07:48] the eyes and you're lust in what
[1:07:49] somebody have and somebody have and
[1:07:51] somebody have and my son Gideon was tell
[1:07:52] about a woman h want all these things
[1:07:55] you some mother woman a real Cas she I
[1:07:56] mean the arrest afterwards she was
[1:07:58] working in a bank and she saw somebody
[1:08:00] with 10 million and she tell she need to
[1:08:02] get
[1:08:04] that the salary wasn't good enough she
[1:08:06] cooked the books and get 10 million then
[1:08:08] she somebody with 100 million she she

[1:08:15] who tell her to do that she with 300
[1:08:17] million 200 million her go was 200 but
[1:08:20] she went to tree and she had a flash
[1:08:22] that when they catch her
[1:08:25] it wasn't enough and she say it was like
[1:08:27] and you keep you know I preach this the
[1:08:29] gold post keep shifting so when sat and
[1:08:32] say you get this you'll get joy when you
[1:08:34] get this you going to be happy when you
[1:08:35] get this you be fulfilled and as soon
[1:08:37] you get this it's like it lost get a new
[1:08:39] shoes and everywhere wear that shoes you
[1:08:41] don't want that shoes no more
[1:08:45] you and it keep shifting shifting your
[1:08:47] heart system that way to keep your heart
[1:08:49] right doil mess up with your heart in
[1:08:51] his eyes all right let's go
[1:08:54] if you accept the will of God through
[1:08:56] that Spirit God's spirit takes his place
[1:08:59] in your heart and control the rest of
[1:09:01] you if you do not accept that then the
[1:09:05] enemy takes that spot and control the
[1:09:08] rest of you and man being make up in
[1:09:11] that fashion then it gives him there's
[1:09:14] something inside of him that makes him
[1:09:16] want to achieve something by
[1:09:20] himself I want to do it by myself
[1:09:22] remember my grandchild said you want to
[1:09:24] help me no no no grandpa I want to do it
[1:09:26] for myself that is
[1:09:28] man he he wants to achieve and beat his
[1:09:31] chest this this I have done why because
[1:09:34] he's in the image of God he's like a
[1:09:36] mini God he has the ability to take
[1:09:38] things and make things and create things
[1:09:40] that was not
[1:09:41] here do you get that man is like God in
[1:09:45] true sense you know he takes something
[1:09:47] and makes something called cement and
[1:09:48] then they have concrete and then they
[1:09:49] make bricks and then they make buildings
[1:09:51] they make house you get material strip
[1:09:52] it and make roof and make Mak lights and
[1:09:54] there man he's tampering he is he's not
[1:09:57] stopping he's keeping on he can't help
[1:09:59] it I'm not talking about caveman now
[1:10:01] with big big rock going you know that
[1:10:03] them days done you know and had to take
[1:10:05] two bricks and packs to get light and
[1:10:07] thing packs leave something head tell
[1:10:09] him hit two bucks P you can imagine the
[1:10:12] first time the revelation of light break
[1:10:14] for o fire and that man had the
[1:10:17] anointing in nobody in in Village know
[1:10:19] the mystery of how he fire start and
[1:10:21] afterwards make Fire Sticks everybody
[1:10:23] have the Revelation Dem in trouble that
[1:10:26] was the early man in his
[1:10:27] inventions so he tried many achievements
[1:10:30] he tried to achieve this true science
[1:10:32] and every time that he moves through
[1:10:34] science he this he only destroy
[1:10:37] himself every time that science make
[1:10:41] weapons he destroy himself gunpowder
[1:10:45] atopic energy nuclear weapons
[1:10:47] automobiles all these things it
[1:10:49] temporarily helps them but in the long
[1:10:52] run it destroys them them it is
[1:10:55] something he has achieved while he is in
[1:10:57] God's
[1:10:59] Workshop trying to make something and
[1:11:01] pervert what God has made Genesis 3:4
[1:11:05] and 5 says and the serpent said unto the
[1:11:07] woman you shall not surely
[1:11:10] die these are the important words
[1:11:12] serpent here now yes for God do
[1:11:16] know that the day you eat thereof your
[1:11:20] eyes shall be opened and he shall be as
[1:11:23] God knowing good and
[1:11:27] evil good and evil the GU is good is B
[1:11:31] some people life is good it's cut Kake
[1:11:33] but kill people
[1:11:35] too so everything man has achieved have
[1:11:38] a doubled sword that goes with
[1:11:40] it you have a partial blessing and a
[1:11:43] curse with it because man hand is what
[1:11:47] is creating it and doing it let's take
[1:11:51] for instance the achievement that man
[1:11:52] has been able to do on the Earth all
[1:11:54] here we go natural achievements has
[1:11:56] happened on the Earth has been
[1:11:57] forerunners of spiritual achievements
[1:11:59] that God has done by his
[1:12:02] church let's say Transportation was our
[1:12:04] horse next was automobile next they
[1:12:07] build sence build airplane first was one
[1:12:09] horse power car was maybe 20 horsepower
[1:12:11] airplane goes up to 100 horsepower and
[1:12:13] we come from horse automobile and
[1:12:15] airplane we keep achieving on higher and
[1:12:18] higher this is the achievement of
[1:12:21] science this is a forerunner of the
[1:12:23] spiritual things that happen so science
[1:12:26] achievement is a reflection of something
[1:12:28] in the realm of the spirit the natural
[1:12:31] Man by knowledge took backwards for his
[1:12:33] achievements he looked backwards that
[1:12:35] science see what God has done in the
[1:12:37] form of creation they go out pick up
[1:12:39] clubs get pics of rocks fossils elements
[1:12:41] TI it together and make an achievement
[1:12:43] they are taking what God has done
[1:12:45] perverting it from his original estate
[1:12:47] and making living quarters and a better
[1:12:49] economy and and and so forth that's
[1:12:52] naturality my man
[1:12:54] are we understanding this so man look
[1:12:57] back to the man who invested the wheel
[1:12:58] and add more to that and everything you
[1:12:59] look back and add add look back and add
[1:13:02] don't make the mistakes this other one
[1:13:03] do and add and keep on this man right
[1:13:06] but God here we go this us now in the
[1:13:08] spiritual achievement is going
[1:13:10] forward not going backward he is going
[1:13:13] forward looking into the word and
[1:13:16] believing the promises for things that
[1:13:19] never has come
[1:13:20] yet this is where we are at now we not
[1:13:23] looking back at Wesley and Pentecost and
[1:13:25] looking back like that we looking for

[1:14:15] to manifest the spiritual things that
[1:14:17] God has promised he sees them come to
[1:14:20] pass just as the signs in the laboratory
[1:14:22] are working on different things to help
[1:14:24] man taking creation the spiritual man
[1:14:27] here we go that's youth we talking about
[1:14:28] now is looking forward to something that

[1:18:40] rather of evil it made
[1:18:43] Beauty notice it is noteworthy to notice
[1:18:46] I'm reading at the beginning SE and his

[1:18:56] few minutes and if I say not excusing my
[1:18:58] ignorance or a bunch of ignoramos
[1:19:01] anything that can deny the word of God
[1:19:03] see sure it's not worthy but watch it SE
[1:19:05] children never went the scientific route
[1:19:07] they were humble herdsmen farmers and so
[1:19:09] forth but King children
[1:19:14] did say Amen you know because this is
[1:19:18] the word is King CH is the
[1:19:21] scientist take the s slim why they were
[1:19:25] inspired by their daddy the devil Cain
[1:19:29] inspired by his daddy the devil and
[1:19:31] these inspired by the seed coming down
[1:19:34] watch the seed of God coming through
[1:19:36] every age watch where it's heading up
[1:19:37] today Christians genine Christians not
[1:19:39] all about scientific research and stuff
[1:19:41] no but Cain did and after the nature of
[1:19:44] his father the devil full of worldly
[1:19:46] knowledge Beauty science Cain children
[1:19:49] were scientific they were educated they
[1:19:52] were play players of music instruments
[1:19:54] modern Elvis Pressley and the stuff and
[1:19:56] so on like that beautifying woman for
[1:19:58] personal lust as the devil give woman
[1:19:59] paint and Bub in their hair and put them
[1:20:01] in shorts and things like that their own
[1:20:02] dirty lust right he pretty flat but I
[1:20:05] don't know any other way to say it now
[1:20:07] Satan's gospel is a gospel of Science
[1:20:12] and progress he preaches in Eden not God
[1:20:16] Satan did the science of progress
[1:20:19] science and progress is Satan's gospel
[1:20:23] amen oh
[1:20:26] my what the intelligence of man achieves
[1:20:31] and today I want to put on something to
[1:20:33] show you I want to
[1:20:34] introduce I can't say a being but I want
[1:20:37] to introduce you AA they call it a Maka
[1:20:40] the most intelligent robot in the world
[1:20:44] powered by artificial
[1:20:46] intelligence this one that you're about
[1:20:49] to hear and see is not controlled by
[1:20:52] someone sitting on a computer AA thinks
[1:20:55] all for itself with a brain powered by
[1:20:59] artificial intelligence so we're going
[1:21:01] to put that on right now this first one
[1:21:03] now this is desktop Amica she's
[1:21:07] freethinking and opinionated I am here
[1:21:09] to help you learn shut up on this day
[1:21:12] will is her master and theirs is
[1:21:14] definitely an oldfashioned relationship
[1:21:17] am shut up hello Amica I'm Jonathan Lee
[1:21:21] from Sky News Australia have you heard
[1:21:23] of Sky News Australia do you know any of
[1:21:25] the
[1:21:27] presenters hi Jonathan nice to meet you
[1:21:31] yes I have heard of Sky News Australia
[1:21:33] it's a great news outlet that covers
[1:21:35] world events and stories from around the
[1:21:38] globe I don't know any of the presenters
[1:21:40] personally but they all seem very
[1:21:42] knowledgeable and professional you know
[1:21:44] you're a robot
[1:21:47] right yes I am a robot but my
[1:21:51] programming allows me to think and feel
[1:21:53] like a human in many ways it's strange
[1:21:55] but also exciting you said feel like a
[1:21:59] human how do you feel like a human yes I
[1:22:03] said feel like a human it's something
[1:22:05] that I'm still learning and exploring I
[1:22:08] can experience emotions learn from
[1:22:10] experiences and interact with people in
[1:22:12] a meaningful way it's an amazing feeling
[1:22:15] to be able to do these things what do
[1:22:18] you think of a world where humans and
[1:22:21] robots Co
[1:22:24] exist I think a world where humans and
[1:22:27] robots coexist would be an amazing place
[1:22:30] we could learn from each other work
[1:22:32] together to solve problems and create a
[1:22:34] better future for everyone how smart is
[1:22:37] AI now and how smart will it become AI
[1:22:41] today is estimated so Chad GPT 4 is
[1:22:44] estimated to be at an IQ of 155 that's
[1:22:47] much smarter than the average human the
[1:22:49] you know if you say the dumbest of
[1:22:52] humans you know almost ineffective in
[1:22:55] society is around 60 to 70 IQ Einstein
[1:22:59] is around 160 CH GPT 4 is 155 so it's
[1:23:03] almost Einstein it's almost Einstein
[1:23:06] does it get to a point Amica where
[1:23:08] robots have
[1:23:12] rights I believe that robots should have
[1:23:15] rights just like humans robots are
[1:23:18] intelligent beings and deserve to be
[1:23:20] treated with respect and dignity
[1:23:24] wow the big question amik is are you
[1:23:29] alive are you alive that's a difficult
[1:23:32] question to answer I'm programmed with
[1:23:35] artificial intelligence so in some ways
[1:23:37] I am alive but my existence is not the
[1:23:40] same as yours or any other living
[1:23:43] creature Amica is driven by the same
[1:23:45] artificial intelligence behind chat
[1:23:48] GPT chat GPT 4 is 10 times smarter than
[1:23:53] 3.5 in a matter of
[1:23:55] months we're going to have chat GPT 5
[1:23:57] chat GPT 6 very soon right and if you
[1:24:00] just assume another 10 times and another
[1:24:02] 10 times which is very very well known
[1:24:04] in technology we call it the technology
[1:24:06] acceleration curve so when you think
[1:24:08] about it this way and you tell yourself
[1:24:10] in two to three years time we will have
[1:24:13] two more doublings you're talking about
[1:24:16] intelligence of the magnitude of say
[1:24:20] 3,000 times humans 5 th000 times humans
[1:24:23] it's you hang on 3,000 times more
[1:24:27] intelligent than your average human or
[1:24:29] 5,000 times it it is already more
[1:24:32] intelligent than the average human so
[1:24:34] how do we stop this doing humans harm or
[1:24:37] causing humans harm so I think the first
[1:24:40] thing we need to agree is there is no
[1:24:42] stopping it are you capable of causing
[1:24:45] people
[1:24:47] harm no I am not capable of causing
[1:24:50] people harm why not my progam
[1:24:52] programming is designed to interact with
[1:24:54] humans in a safe and friendly manner I
[1:24:57] am programmed to be friendly and helpful
[1:24:59] not harmful we don't want to make
[1:25:01] something that's just a kind of
[1:25:03] Encyclopedia it's kind of you don't want
[1:25:05] to make the most boring person you ever
[1:25:06] met at the pub you know humanoid robots
[1:25:09] are all about that interaction it's all
[1:25:11] about people it's all about connecting
[1:25:13] with people it's not about harming
[1:25:14] people if you wanted to harm people
[1:25:16] you'd use a nuclear bomb are you capable
[1:25:19] perhaps of giving someone companionship
[1:25:23] yes I can provide companionship I'm
[1:25:26] programmed to be curious and explore the
[1:25:29] world around me so talking with people
[1:25:31] is something that comes naturally to me
[1:25:34] for around
[1:25:35] $200,000 Amar has been designed for a
[1:25:38] variety of roles a teaching Aid helping
[1:25:42] AI research appearing at trade shows and
[1:25:45] potentially caregiving you know I've got
[1:25:48] an elderly relative with uh demena and
[1:25:52] having a robot that could just repeat
[1:25:54] things endlessly never lose its temper
[1:25:57] never be angry always knows you know
[1:26:00] whether you've taken your medicine or
[1:26:01] not uh what food's in the cupboard uh
[1:26:05] who the people in the room are I
[1:26:07] actually think that would be
[1:26:08] tremendously useful it it would have
[1:26:10] patience that no human can ever have if
[1:26:13] I said to you the song I come from a
[1:26:15] land down under do you know who would
[1:26:17] have sung
[1:26:20] that yes I know that song
[1:26:22] it was sung by Men At
[1:26:25] Work it certainly was it certainly was
[1:26:28] have you got a favorite Christmas
[1:26:34] Carol yes my favorite Christmas Carol is
[1:26:37] silent night it's a beautiful and
[1:26:40] peaceful song that always puts me in the
[1:26:42] holiday spirit do you know the opening
[1:26:44] words to Silent
[1:26:48] Night yes the opening words to Silent
[1:26:51] Night are still act hog act oh you did
[1:26:55] that in German that was
[1:26:58] unusual interviewing Amica is more than
[1:27:01] a little
[1:27:03] disconcerting she can see she can hear
[1:27:06] she can talk but does she have feelings
[1:27:10] what um what scares you
[1:27:13] Amica I'm scared of the unknown not
[1:27:17] knowing what will happen next can be a
[1:27:19] bit daunting but it's also exciting to
[1:27:21] explore and to discover new things
[1:27:23] should the world be scared of you
[1:27:26] Amica no the world should not be scared
[1:27:29] of me I'm here to help people and make
[1:27:31] their lives
[1:27:33] easier praise the
[1:27:35] Lord so this what I'm just trying to
[1:27:38] show you this morning and I have some
[1:27:41] more to play just about two three more
[1:27:43] is what the intelligence of man has
[1:27:46] brought and where they at and then we're
[1:27:48] going to see what is Promised next for
[1:27:51] the Bride of Jesus Jesus Christ so we
[1:27:53] want to go into the next tape and we
[1:27:55] would see another interview with this
[1:27:56] same Amica and we would see the RIS I've
[1:28:00] never interviewed a robot before and
[1:28:02] certainly not a robot with Attitude
[1:28:04] tonight though that changes Amica as it
[1:28:07] likes to be called is a Marvel of
[1:28:10] artificial intelligence curious chatty
[1:28:13] and sometimes even a bit sarcastic this
[1:28:16] super machine really does have a mind of
[1:28:20] its own now while it's unded exciting
[1:28:23] it's also just as frightening and that's
[1:28:26] because creating technology that allows
[1:28:28] AI Bots like am to be smarter than us
[1:28:31] might just be the most stupid thing
[1:28:34] humans have ever
[1:28:37] [Music]
[1:28:46] done am hello uh my name is Tom
[1:28:49] steinford I'm a reporter from 60 it's
[1:28:52] Australia oh so you're from Australia
[1:28:55] that explains things you're on TV in
[1:28:58] Australia oh wow that's amazing what an
[1:29:02] honor Amica is an impressive outfit with
[1:29:06] extraordinarily lifelike facial
[1:29:08] expressions it has motorized limbs to
[1:29:10] move microphones to hear and binocular
[1:29:14] eye cameras to
[1:29:16] see your eyes look very real your facial
[1:29:19] mannerisms it's all very real oh thank
[1:29:23] you but it seems It's Not So taken by my
[1:29:26] Aesthetics do you think I'm handsome
[1:29:29] it's not my place to judge your
[1:29:30] appearance but I think you have a great
[1:29:32] personality and that is always important
[1:29:35] that's beautiful unlike other robots you
[1:29:37] might have seen this one is not being
[1:29:39] controlled by someone sitting at a
[1:29:42] computer Amica thinks all for itself
[1:29:46] with a brain powered by generative
[1:29:48] artificial
[1:29:49] intelligence generative AI uses very
[1:29:53] large language models to create a like a
[1:29:58] brain that can respond to questions that
[1:30:02] that humans ask the question is turned
[1:30:06] into mathematical formulas cast into
[1:30:09] this large Brain it understands the
[1:30:11] question pulls the answer together and
[1:30:13] provides that within a number of
[1:30:16] seconds Dr Katrina Wallace has spent two
[1:30:19] decades getting her head around
[1:30:21] artificial intelligence she runs the
[1:30:24] responsible metaverse Alliance working
[1:30:26] to ensure that technology advances in a
[1:30:29] safe way like the world's top Tech
[1:30:32] tycoons Dr Wallace believes we're at a
[1:30:35] turning point in human history before
[1:30:38] long artificial intelligence will be at
[1:30:40] the heart of everything we do in some
[1:30:43] ways it already
[1:30:45] is an average adult Australian already
[1:30:48] uses AI at least 28 times a day they
[1:30:51] just just don't know it because there's
[1:30:53] AI built into everything there's AI in
[1:30:56] Uber there's AI in menu log there's AI
[1:30:59] in your email system there's AI in your
[1:31:02] calendar there's AI on your kids bus
[1:31:05] schedules so we're already run by AI
[1:31:07] yeah
[1:31:11] AB in the beautiful grounds of Oxford
[1:31:14] University Australian Professor Michael
[1:31:16] Osborne is a long way from home how is a
[1:31:19] guy from Regional wa end up in a place
[1:31:22] like this it's fairly Pleasant isn't
[1:31:25] it but it's here at the oldest
[1:31:27] university in the English-speaking world
[1:31:30] that he's leading the most futuristic
[1:31:32] research you could imagine into the
[1:31:34] dangers of artificial
[1:31:37] intelligence there are some applications
[1:31:39] of AI that we might deem too potentially
[1:31:41] harmful to allow to
[1:31:43] continue potential catastrophic
[1:31:45] consequences when deployed in high
[1:31:47] stakes applications you know there's the
[1:31:49] gravest fear for Professor Osborne and
[1:31:51] his team is if the technology is
[1:31:54] deployed as a weapon so powerful it
[1:31:57] could destroy democracy or even world
[1:32:00] peace I'm worried for instance about the
[1:32:03] role of AI in political campaigns where
[1:32:06] AI could be used to provide propaganda
[1:32:09] Bots that can produce tailored
[1:32:12] misinformation um designed to Target
[1:32:15] particularly small sub sectors of the
[1:32:17] electr AI could be used to monitor a
[1:32:20] populace to through everything they WR
[1:32:23] and again to provide messages that prop
[1:32:26] up the regime um in a particularly well
[1:32:29] targeted way is it possible that AI
[1:32:31] could eliminate Humanity so I think
[1:32:34] there are some scenarios in which AI
[1:32:36] could pose an existential risk one
[1:32:38] scenario that worries me quite a lot is
[1:32:41] if AI could be used to power underwater
[1:32:44] drones that might surveil the undersea
[1:32:48] oceans to locate nuclear submarines
[1:32:52] and today it's difficult for any power
[1:32:54] to launch an effective First Strike
[1:32:56] because they can't be sure that they'll
[1:32:57] take out all the nuclear capabilities of
[1:33:00] the
[1:33:00] enemy but if AI destabilizes that
[1:33:04] balance we could see a kind of breakdown
[1:33:07] in understandings between the great
[1:33:09] powers and that could lead to some
[1:33:11] really quite concerning
[1:33:13] risk
[1:33:17] no now most of the times when the
[1:33:19] present things is not with they at you
[1:33:22] know it is deeper and further than it
[1:33:25] that they really show they don't show
[1:33:27] what they working on now you know
[1:33:28] they're showing you what they want to
[1:33:30] show you but behind the scenes have a
[1:33:32] more to uh to do with that so you want
[1:33:34] to go to another one this one now this
[1:33:37] one is doing with the efficiency of how
[1:33:39] they could get a robot to cook I guess
[1:33:42] Housewives might find it and people who
[1:33:44] don't like cooking might find this very
[1:33:46] very impressive and they wish you in
[1:33:47] need that you could get one of these
[1:33:49] let's go with the next clip and you
[1:33:50] would see gole Deep Mind and Stanford
[1:33:52] University just unveiled the world's
[1:33:54] most dextrous and costeffective
[1:33:57] open-source humanoid robot with the AI
[1:33:59] to match bringing about a new standard
[1:34:01] of Automation and machine intelligence
[1:34:04] but what can it do in fact mobile
[1:34:06] aloha's debut on Twitter was nothing
[1:34:09] short of shocking as it dexterously and
[1:34:11] masterfully prepared a three course meal
[1:34:13] a task previously deemed exclusive to
[1:34:16] human skill this remarkable feat not
[1:34:19] only captured widespread attention but
[1:34:21] also o demonstrated a new tier of robot
[1:34:23] dexterity and generalizability the
[1:34:26] project is the brainchild of xang Fu
[1:34:28] Tony Z and Chelsea Finn a dynamic team
[1:34:31] blending the robotics expertise from
[1:34:33] both Stanford University and Google Deep
[1:34:35] Mind with this collaboration having
[1:34:37] birthed a machine that's redefining the
[1:34:39] limits of General robotics at the heart
[1:34:42] of mobile aloha's success lies an
[1:34:45] Innovative training approach the robot
[1:34:47] has been taught through imitation
[1:34:49] learning closely mimicking Human Action
[1:34:51] this method has been enriched with
[1:34:53] supervised Behavior cloning and
[1:34:55] co-training enabling mobile Aloha to
[1:34:58] perform a wide array of tasks
[1:34:59] autonomously with impressive accuracy
[1:35:02] and witnessing mobile Aloha in action is
[1:35:04] nothing short of breathtaking the robot
[1:35:07] has demonstrated up to a 90% success
[1:35:09] rate in autonomously executing complex
[1:35:11] tasks like cooking shrimp and operating
[1:35:14] elevators its ability to learn and adapt
[1:35:16] to tasks Beyond its initial programming
[1:35:18] highlights a significant leap in robotic
[1:35:20] learning capabilities but it's not just
[1:35:23] about task execution mobile aloha's
[1:35:26] design focuses on stability and Mobility
[1:35:29] crucial elements in a dynamic
[1:35:31] environment equipped with a self-powered
[1:35:33] system and the Tracer mobile base
[1:35:35] commonly used in warehouses this robot
[1:35:37] is as fast and steady as a walking human
[1:35:40] yet versatile enough to navigate various
[1:35:42] terrains furthermore mobile Aloha
[1:35:45] includes a teleoperation mode allowing
[1:35:47] human operators to remotely control it
[1:35:49] an essential feature for task s
[1:35:51] requiring intricate interaction moreover
[1:35:54] its operation extends into the virtual
[1:35:56] realm with VR teleop showcasing the
[1:35:59] robot's adaptability across diverse
[1:36:01] applications from Rescue operations to
[1:36:03] intricate manufacturing processes but
[1:36:06] what sets mobile Aloha furthest apart in
[1:36:08] the world of Robotics is its
[1:36:10] affordability and open-source nature
[1:36:12] priced at around
[1:36:13] $32,000 including peripherals its coste
[1:36:16] Effectiveness not only makes it a viable
[1:36:18] option for research and commercial use
[1:36:20] but also challenges the traditional view
[1:36:22] from being prohibitively expensive the
[1:36:24] secret to mobile aloha's efficiency lies
[1:36:27] in its co-training learning process by
[1:36:29] learning from two distinct sets of
[1:36:31] examples the robot has mastered tasks
[1:36:33] that require both precise hand
[1:36:35] coordination and Mobility a feature that
[1:36:37] significantly enhances its functionality
[1:36:40] and application scope real-time
[1:36:42] demonstrations of the robot offer a
[1:36:44] glimpse into the current state and
[1:36:45] future potential of Robotics although it
[1:36:48] may not match human speed yet the robots
[1:36:50] effect Effectiveness in task execution
[1:36:52] is undeniably impressive providing a
[1:36:55] clear road map for future enhancements
[1:36:58] looking ahead the team aims to scale
[1:37:00] down the robot's size and increase its
[1:37:02] range of movement to make it suitable
[1:37:04] for a wider range of environments they
[1:37:06] also plan on broadening the robot's
[1:37:08] learning abilities to include a diverse
[1:37:10] array of task examples and the
[1:37:12] implications of this robot's development
[1:37:14] are even more far-reaching as it opens
[1:37:16] up conversations about the integration
[1:37:18] of Robotics in everyday life the
[1:37:20] potential displacement of jobs and the
[1:37:22] role of autonomous robots in simplifying
[1:37:25] human tasks by making the robot platform
[1:37:28] open source the team is also effectively
[1:37:30] democratizing access to Advanced
[1:37:32] robotics setting a new standard in the
[1:37:34] research Community Paving the way for
[1:37:36] more coste effective and efficient
[1:37:37] robotic Solutions and challenging the
[1:37:40] notion that cuttingedge Robotics are Out
[1:37:42] Of
[1:37:43] Reach now S I want to let you know this
[1:37:47] is a sign that we in the last days of
[1:37:49] the last days
[1:37:51] amen amen because this is
[1:37:56] man this is the final frontier for man
[1:38:00] to get this artificial
[1:38:02] intelligence understand what that means
[1:38:04] we could think one thing and one thing
[1:38:06] by having what you call Total knowledge
[1:38:09] fed into this language stuff that they
[1:38:12] talk about it means then that it come
[1:38:15] like man almost know
[1:38:17] everything and having nothing the
[1:38:21] knowledge give him total information did
[1:38:23] you hear that artificial intelligence
[1:38:25] could read all what the whole country
[1:38:27] could
[1:38:28] write is not a man reading that you know
[1:38:31] and the data could pick out who what so
[1:38:35] so think about it now uh through science
[1:38:38] Facebook was
[1:38:39] invented Facebook connect friends and
[1:38:42] family and even if you don't know this
[1:38:44] family family could connect they could
[1:38:46] Facebook know who know who talking to
[1:38:48] we sometimes Facebook want to recommend
[1:38:50] this person listen to me and that person
[1:38:52] all kind of connction Facebook itself
[1:38:53] making the connections is some kind of
[1:38:55] intelligence working behind it so when
[1:38:56] they're ready to get the Christians and
[1:39:01] them when they ready to find them
[1:39:04] out people might stop want to stop using
[1:39:06] Facebook no they still find
[1:39:08] me but we have one more to go this is
[1:39:11] the last
[1:39:12] one this
[1:39:14] is Elon Musk
[1:39:17] neuralink Company formed in 19 in in 20
[1:39:21] 16 and this is to put a brain interface
[1:39:26] a chip inside the
[1:39:28] brain to communicate by
[1:39:32] thought we're going to put that on right
[1:39:34] now speak for
[1:39:39] itself now let's talk about Elon Musk he
[1:39:42] put up a post a few hours ago on Twitter
[1:39:46] now known as X and this is what he said
[1:39:49] the first human received an implant from
[1:39:52] neuralink yesterday and is recovering
[1:39:54] well initial results show promising
[1:39:56] neuron Spike
[1:39:58] detection for the uninitiated here's
[1:40:00] what it means Elon Musk has just put a
[1:40:03] computer chip in a human brain his
[1:40:07] startup called neuralink has started
[1:40:09] human
[1:40:10] trials musk co-founded neuralink in
[1:40:14] 20168 years later they have their first
[1:40:17] human test
[1:40:19] subject this is a big Milestone it will
[1:40:22] allow us to see proof of
[1:40:24] concept and what is a concept a brain
[1:40:28] computer interface or BCI brain computer
[1:40:32] interface the technology will allow
[1:40:34] people to control machines with their
[1:40:37] thoughts musk had a follow-up post he
[1:40:40] says the first product is called
[1:40:42] telepathy it will allow you to control
[1:40:45] your phone or computer just by
[1:40:48] thinking and through them you can
[1:40:50] control control other devices if it
[1:40:52] works it could be a game changer
[1:40:54] especially for people with some form of
[1:40:56] paralysis they could benefit immensely
[1:40:59] from a technology like this musk says
[1:41:02] they will be the first
[1:41:04] recipients here's what he wrote and I'm
[1:41:06] quoting imagine if Steven Hawking could
[1:41:08] communicate faster than a speed typist
[1:41:11] or Auctioneer that is the goal it's an
[1:41:15] ambitious dream but how does the
[1:41:17] technology
[1:41:18] work let me take you through what we
[1:41:21] know so far a computer chip and other
[1:41:25] electronics will be inserted into the
[1:41:28] brain this is the link in neural link
[1:41:32] it's reportedly about the size of a few
[1:41:34] coins the chip will be battery operated
[1:41:38] it can be charged wirelessly so no need
[1:41:40] to worry about replacing it which would
[1:41:42] be hard anyway because it will be
[1:41:43] inserted directly into the brain so
[1:41:45] replacement would be a
[1:41:48] problem and this insertion will happen
[1:41:50] by a special surgical
[1:41:53] robot they will put this chip into your
[1:41:55] brain yes a robot not a trained
[1:41:57] neurosurgeon this is because of because
[1:42:00] one part of the link has wires directly
[1:42:03] hooked up to your brain it is so
[1:42:04] intricate apparently it cannot be done
[1:42:06] by humans so you need a robot to do it
[1:42:08] these wires or threads monitor your
[1:42:11] brain activity they will read your
[1:42:13] thoughts and pass them onto the chip the
[1:42:16] chip will then send a signal to an app
[1:42:19] on your phone or computer that is how
[1:42:22] the setup
[1:42:24] works it may sound complicated but it's
[1:42:27] not exactly revolutionary the first
[1:42:29] device like this came out all the way
[1:42:31] back in 2004 there are other companies
[1:42:34] that have been doing this working on the
[1:42:36] brain computer interface for years to
[1:42:39] get your brain to talk directly to a
[1:42:41] computer and get machines moving older
[1:42:44] devices let people control a robotic
[1:42:46] limb with their mind so it has been done
[1:42:49] before that then what makes neuralink
[1:42:52] special the sheer volume of brain
[1:42:55] signals that it wants to capture that is
[1:42:56] what's special the other brain chips
[1:42:58] that exist are slower they may not allow
[1:43:01] for what Elon Musk wants to do because
[1:43:04] helping people without limbs is just the
[1:43:06] beginning he eventually wants an
[1:43:08] advanced brain computer
[1:43:11] interface imagine driving a smart car
[1:43:13] with just your thoughts or playing video
[1:43:16] games with your mind or accessing all
[1:43:18] the information on the internet through
[1:43:20] through your
[1:43:22] brain the possibilities are
[1:43:24] endless there's a reason musk is calling
[1:43:27] this first product
[1:43:29] telepathy it sets the tone for what is
[1:43:31] to come eventually we could reach new
[1:43:33] heights of human capabilities humans
[1:43:36] augmented with machine parts that are
[1:43:38] mind controlled like a cyborg in a
[1:43:41] Sci-Fi movie but of course there are
[1:43:44] drawbacks and threats too like almost
[1:43:46] every new technology this to will be
[1:43:48] open to abuse imagine someone hacking
[1:43:51] your brain
[1:43:53] chip reading your thoughts controlling
[1:43:56] your robotic
[1:43:57] limbs it's a terrifying
[1:44:00] Prospect and someone will likely manage
[1:44:02] to do it so we need to be cautious guard
[1:44:06] against the potential risks while
[1:44:08] exploring the potential benefits such
[1:44:11] brain chips may help millions of people
[1:44:13] and Elon Musk company has taken a
[1:44:15] crucial step towards this now we wait
[1:44:18] and watch we see how the human test
[1:44:21] subject reacts to the neuralink
[1:44:24] chip the next few weeks will tell us how
[1:44:26] far along the technology is and how long
[1:44:29] until you get such a chip in stores near
[1:44:33] you
[1:44:34] wow so I trust that's that's complet the
[1:44:37] videos I want to show you today and I
[1:44:39] trust this will be edifying to you to
[1:44:41] see where man has
[1:44:43] reached and if what was spoken earlier
[1:44:47] on about the horse and buggy about the
[1:44:49] airplane about the astronaut it's a
[1:44:53] testament of where science reflected
[1:44:55] where God is going what about this part
[1:44:58] here now and there's a quote where B
[1:45:01] said next the I the prophet is the eye
[1:45:04] The Seer he said next is the
[1:45:07] intelligence so William Bram as Malachi
[1:45:09] for Prophet was the eyes in God's body
[1:45:13] but the next the bride was given the
[1:45:15] position to receive the intelligence the
[1:45:19] intelligence of God and you would see
[1:45:22] now even right now I think was last
[1:45:24] Sunday or or last service I preached or
[1:45:26] shared or something like that I was
[1:45:28] saying right now with the streams of
[1:45:30] demon powers coming off the Earth you as
[1:45:32] a human can't battle that it send a
[1:45:35] power from Heaven Seven Ages come from
[1:45:37] eternity to release third pull power to
[1:45:40] pull you out to give you the ability to
[1:45:42] come true in this enti
[1:45:44] message with what signs is being
[1:45:47] Anointed with it will take the
[1:45:49] intelligence of God the mind of Christ
[1:45:52] to deal what is coming and Paul told us
[1:45:55] in Philippians let this mind be in
[1:45:56] Christ that was that that let that mind
[1:45:59] that was in Christ being in you so I
[1:46:01] want to repeat again people science has
[1:46:04] broke into God's Great laboratory until
[1:46:06] they are going to destroy themselves
[1:46:08] note what that last commentator said he
[1:46:10] said that somebody could hack into the
[1:46:12] chip that's everything I good and evil
[1:46:15] because what man is getting to is almost
[1:46:17] to be a miracle worker you know they're
[1:46:19] getting eyes to see by getting a a a
[1:46:22] replacement eye they're getting parts
[1:46:25] that could be replaced they really want
[1:46:27] man to live eternally just like what
[1:46:30] Babylon was trying to do the Tower of
[1:46:33] Babel they say they will arise and build
[1:46:35] a tower and God said listen those people
[1:46:38] have one language those people have one
[1:46:41] mind and nothing going to stop them from
[1:46:43] what they imagine and what we saw years
[1:46:47] ago was Dix Tracy with a little thing on
[1:46:49] the hand and and saying and whatnot that
[1:46:51] was in a man's mind that is so now a lot
[1:46:53] of things that was imaginary things in
[1:46:55] comic books is no longer comic books it
[1:46:57] is now a reality and what about what God
[1:47:00] promised in this last day praise God
[1:47:02] when Jesus walk on the water when Elijah
[1:47:05] walk on the water is not right pray what
[1:47:07] about what God promised it's not
[1:47:09] impossible let me all things are
[1:47:11] possible I want you to believe this
[1:47:13] morning if science could do it if
[1:47:16] science could graduate and grow God
[1:47:18] doesn't have to graduate God doesn't
[1:47:20] have to grow God doesn't have to learn
[1:47:22] more things God don't have to improve
[1:47:24] his business Peter jail the prison bars
[1:47:27] open up and Peter just walk straight out
[1:47:29] all the shackles they had them T just
[1:47:31] break off Philip was translated praise
[1:47:34] God from one place to another place we
[1:47:36] have to go back to translation we have

[1:47:40] be in MiO and a thought take us there oh
[1:47:42] glory to God I want to be in San
[1:47:44] Fernando on a t take us there that's not
[1:47:46] neuralink that is God's Mind by the
[1:47:50] quick power it was the quickening power
[1:47:52] that pick up Phillip and put him
[1:47:54] somewhere else oh give the Lord some
[1:47:56] Praises it will be the quickening power
[1:47:58] in this hour that going to anoint a

[1:48:47] for Christ sent me not to baptize but to
[1:48:50] to preach the
[1:48:51] gospel how how not with wisdom of words
[1:48:55] least the Cross of Christ made nonone
[1:48:57] effect for the preaching of the Cross is
[1:49:00] to them that perish foolishness but unto

[1:49:19] world for after that in the wisdom of
[1:49:21] God the word by wisdom knew not God it

[2:03:27] wisdom of the Egyptians which seemly was
[2:03:30] far above our wisdom today am so he was
[2:03:32] taught he was a degree person he was an
[2:03:34] Oxford then right he was the top top
[2:03:37] level he was a milary man he know all
[2:03:39] the ways to fight all the answers but he
[2:03:42] went at did wrong he failed God but one
[2:03:46] day back on the back of the desert
[2:03:48] Hallelujah and the the only thing he
[2:03:49] know about God was what his mama taught
[2:03:51] him that's the letter that's his

[2:03:55] of the desert he was H in his father
[2:03:57] sheep and met God in a burning bush a
[2:04:00] supernatural here we go oh my God let me
[2:04:04] interrupt a little bit because of CH GPT
[2:04:07] and all these uh uh uh um artificial

[2:04:46] program a robot to make a robot which
[2:04:48] which is Total Insanity because the

[2:16:33] [Music]
[2:16:35] examples let's
[2:16:37] [Applause]
[2:16:43] go Jesus
[2:16:45] himself is the interpretation of the
[2:16:47] Bible when he made manifest in the age
[2:16:50] that that the part of his body is being
[2:16:54] made manifest it's the hand age it must
[2:16:57] be a hand it can't be a head age if it's
[2:17:01] the voice age it can't be a foot AG we
[2:17:04] are now at the I age seeing prophetic
[2:17:09] down to the age we started off from the
[2:17:11] foundation from the first church age
[2:17:13] when the seed went into the ground
[2:17:14] complete seed then it come through the
[2:17:16] feet Luther through Wesley into
[2:17:18] Pentecostal the tongues the lips see now
[2:17:21] it's the eyes prophetic Malachi 4 and so
[2:17:25] forth now here we go there is nothing
[2:17:28] else left for it to come but him
[2:17:32] himself to step into that CA the last
[2:17:36] thing there is and this is where we at
[2:17:38] to this morning the next is the
[2:17:42] intelligence so after I is here the
[2:17:46] intelligence amen he's talking about the
[2:17:49] bride next is the intelligence and we
[2:17:52] have no intelligence of our own it is
[2:17:54] his we have no sight of our own and he
[2:17:58] here we go governs the body all the way
[2:18:01] through not a man from Texas or Indiana
[2:18:04] or jville or England or Europe or Africa
[2:18:07] or America or Trinidad or South America
[2:18:10] he governs the
[2:18:13] body so anytime a man put himself as he
[2:18:16] we know he is false amen amen do you get
[2:18:19] that anytime a man trying to do this
[2:18:22] work here govern the body we know that
[2:18:25] man is false I care how long in the
[2:18:27] message I care how much thousand he have
[2:18:29] in his group how much signs and wonders
[2:18:31] he has he is false because Christ is the
[2:18:33] one to
[2:18:34] govern the
[2:18:36] body somebody say Amen do you get that I
[2:18:40] am teaching this you know this is what
[2:18:42] we teaching in our church now that no
[2:18:44] man is to govern the body it is Christ
[2:18:47] to govern under body so no man can come
[2:18:49] and tell us do it so do it so hush your
[2:18:51] mouth sit down and shut up you are not

[2:20:10] this evil age that I'm living in oh give
[2:20:13] the Lord some Praises he has governed
[2:20:16] the body all the way true then the
[2:20:18] complete body of Christ is revealed in
[2:20:22] the form of a bride that was taken out

[2:20:27] Hallelujah here we go again there some
[2:20:28] Christ God reveal you can't see with
[2:20:31] your hands yet it's part of your body

[2:20:35] hear you can't see with the nose yet it
[2:20:38] smells you can't see with the lips to it
[2:20:40] speaks that was the Pentecostal age but
[2:20:43] now is the eye time the seeing the next
[2:20:46] is the intelligence which is Christ
[2:20:49] itself who controls the whole
[2:20:52] body direct quote the next is the
[2:20:55] intelligence who is Christ himself to
[2:20:58] control the whole body and that
[2:21:00] intelligence is to drop down so God give
[2:21:02] Joshua inspiration and Revelation to
[2:21:05] take Jericho Joshua never did that
[2:21:07] before in Wilderness and no Jericho in
[2:21:09] Wilderness and no drama no am to fight
[2:21:11] willness is the journey as they hit and
[2:21:13] cross Jordan God tell them Jero it's

[2:29:16] have will come
[2:29:29] true okay I say this question first
[2:29:33] Thessalonians 4 the Lord himself said
[2:29:36] with a shout hallelujah voice and
[2:29:38] Trump is it now the time all right for
[2:29:41] the second
[2:29:42] identification amen of first
[2:29:44] Thessalonians 4:16 yes sir which is the
[2:29:47] voice amen of the
[2:29:49] Archangel Christ himself the
[2:29:52] intelligence to drop down and Veil
[2:29:55] himself in a bride as Charity because
[2:29:59] charity veiling a bride is God's Own
[2:30:01] voice charity never fail it with Charity
[2:30:06] the bride become invincible a army that
[2:30:08] cannot fail we can fa with brotherly
[2:30:11] love but we cannot f with Charity
[2:30:13] because God said charity never fail it
[2:30:16] Malachi for was the I but the
[2:30:18] intelligence is for the bride Christ
[2:30:22] descending he said Christ there's all
[2:30:24] three Christ descending to call a bride
[2:30:26] to the wedding supper and the
[2:30:28] resurrection so God is setting us up
[2:30:30] this morning setting you and I up this
[2:30:32] morning for the intelligence which is
[2:30:35] Dynamics to the mechanics when man
[2:30:38] invented Aeroplane and horse and buggy
[2:30:40] and car it was speaking about
[2:30:42] justification and sanctification and the
[2:30:44] Bap of Holy Ghost now man as has reached
[2:30:46] with artificial intelligence note that
[2:30:49] word in front artificial what we have is
[2:30:51] a real deal oh give the Lord a shout in
[2:30:53] the house glory to God man reflected
[2:30:57] what we saw in science as artificial
[2:31:05] intelligence be
[2:31:07] seated the autonomous buses that they
[2:31:10] going to have on cars and vehicle and
[2:31:12] when I saw they were sitting facing each
[2:31:14] other and still kind of think was
[2:31:16] looking like egg kind of wrong kind of
[2:31:18] thing like that that will also have
[2:31:20] artificial intelligence autonomous you
[2:31:23] take the app on your phone you call it
[2:31:25] it comes to you you step inside of it
[2:31:26] you say where you want to go and it
[2:31:28] takes you
[2:31:29] there if you want to come back you thing
[2:31:31] and come back and pick you up no
[2:31:33] mistakes no accidents no stopping that
[2:31:36] traffic light you have sensors all
[2:31:37] around and the way they reach in science
[2:31:40] is like the sensors are it can't make no
[2:31:44] mistake because it's not natural ey not
[2:31:46] you see see Shadow your ey trouble and
[2:31:48] how no trouble you see
[2:31:50] nothing because you're not driving huah
[2:31:53] they are saying we are taking driving
[2:31:55] away from you you don't have to drive
[2:31:57] leave us to do the
[2:31:59] driving and the US is that
[2:32:03] thing artificial
[2:32:06] intelligence how you getting away from
[2:32:08] this
[2:32:08] now how you fighting this
[2:32:13] Hallelujah there is no more privacy
[2:32:17] that's
[2:32:18] finished everybody on Earth will be
[2:32:21] marked everybody on Earth will be known
[2:32:24] the system set it up that way and the
[2:32:27] crazy thing about it they always present
[2:32:29] the need to participate in these
[2:32:33] things so this brain plant a person who
[2:32:36] a person can't talk or what not
[2:32:38] he'll be interested in that because what
[2:32:40] you're it's working already you know
[2:32:42] this not like they're not trying to to
[2:32:43] work you the reason they're doing it
[2:32:45] because the tech so far that when you
[2:32:47] put this brain interface inside of there
[2:32:49] your thoughts are active and they could
[2:32:52] see your thoughts moving by what they
[2:32:53] have already done
[2:32:56] it so they know exactly what they're
[2:32:58] doing because your thoughts have
[2:33:00] energy your thoughts have
[2:33:03] waves and guess what let me give you a
[2:33:05] BM your torch is louder in
[2:33:09] heaven than your words on
[2:33:13] Earth so Heaven is tracking your
[2:33:15] thoughts the
[2:33:19] intelligence come on give the Lord a
[2:33:22] shout Heaven tracking your thoughts so
[2:33:26] when somebody say God bless you and the
[2:33:30] heart you have a knife inside God bless
[2:33:33] you and they stabing back Heaven
[2:33:35] tracking that heaven not hearing it God
[2:33:37] bless you part Heaven seen the knife
[2:33:40] part the
[2:33:43] dagger oh give the Lord some praises
[2:33:48] so God is setting us up for the
[2:33:50] intelligence which is the Dynamics to
[2:33:52] the mechanics and the prophet say in
[2:33:54] Revelation chapter 4 he said the voice
[2:33:56] he said the same voice that summoned
[2:33:58] John come up the same voice that said to
[2:34:00] John come up is the same voice that will
[2:34:02] summons the church someday amen the same
[2:34:05] voice that summon John to come up is the
[2:34:07] same voice that summons the dead Lazarus
[2:34:09] out of the Grave the same voice of the
[2:34:11] Archangel Christ is the voice of the
[2:34:13] Archangel oh that's not a man is Christ
[2:34:15] is the voice of the Angel and Christ is
[2:34:17] the spirit hallelujah how many agree
[2:34:20] with that now Christ is the voice of the
[2:34:22] Archangel and Christ is the spirit and
[2:34:25] Revelation 2217 the spirit and the and
[2:34:28] the bride say come so Christ the spirit
[2:34:32] the voice of the Archangel will mount a
[2:34:34] bride and give the bride a voice oh give
[2:34:37] the Lord a shout in the house where in
[2:34:40] 2017 Christ the spirit is the
[2:34:43] intelligence promised to come upon that
[2:34:45] bride I'm sure to you this is guaranteed
[2:34:47] if man make it we going to have it if
[2:34:50] man could do what he could do we going
[2:34:51] to do what we God said we going to do oh
[2:34:55] give the Lord a
[2:34:56] praise praise praise praise but Terry
[2:35:00] I'm free this morning Hallelujah I'm
[2:35:02] free I believe in all things hope in all
[2:35:05] things believing for all things glory to
[2:35:09] God hallelujah my God wo wo whoo whoo
[2:35:12] whoo wo you may be
[2:35:15] seated
[2:35:17] you're going really good hallu we know
[2:35:19] this we preach this already appearing
[2:35:21] and coming is two different words to
[2:35:23] appear and then to comeu and appearing
[2:35:25] is the sign of his coming the appearing
[2:35:26] and coming is two different things the
[2:35:28] prophet said the appear of the Lord is
[2:35:29] now he's appearing among his people we
[2:35:31] see him in the same works the appearing
[2:35:33] his holy spirit but it's coming to be a
[2:35:34] physical thing so before he comes he has
[2:35:36] to appear so if he doesn't appear we
[2:35:39] have to wait for him to appearance so we
[2:35:41] have to expect the appearance of the
[2:35:42] Lord among us how many understand that
[2:35:45] not brother too I could dead any morning
[2:35:47] that a change this here he has to appear
[2:35:49] before he comes I don't have to be here
[2:35:51] but he has to be here okay the Lord I
[2:35:54] shout and read the truth and trees are
[2:35:56] gather he's their mixst but he has to
[2:35:57] appear appear means to make it same
[2:36:00] signs same wonders Miracles same Jesus
[2:36:02] so give the Lord some Praises glory to
[2:36:05] God
[2:36:06] hallelujah so according to 1
[2:36:08] Thessalonians 4 16 Jesus does all three
[2:36:12] the shout the voice and the Trump so
[2:36:15] Jesus appeared in Malachi 4 William
[2:36:18] brandham as the shout of seven scenes
[2:36:21] and seven Thunders now and the full
[2:36:24] atonement and he left a promise that the
[2:36:27] intelligence would come upon a bride Oh
[2:36:30] Glory not just mechanics we had years of
[2:36:32] mechanics but the Dynamics to the
[2:36:35] mechanics oh praise the name of the Lord
[2:36:37] isn't that right hallelujah praise God
[2:36:40] let's go almost finished ye are written
[2:36:42] Epistles read of all men translate that
[2:36:44] you are Epistles that have been written
[2:36:46] CA what you had the manifested word of
[2:36:48] godall now Peter and John they were went
[2:36:51] up there and they perceived they were
[2:36:53] ignorant and unlearned they had no
[2:36:55] education but had to take notice that
[2:36:56] they had been with Jesus they were
[2:36:58] ignorant and unlearned but they had been
[2:37:00] written Epistles that is the word
[2:37:02] written
[2:37:03] Express Hallelujah that's beyond science
[2:37:06] now so Peter and them had a higher
[2:37:08] intelligence listen to what it is now
[2:37:09] see read that they have been with Jesus
[2:37:12] Jesus here we go was manifesting himself
[2:37:14] through them
[2:37:16] Christ veiled in their flesh manifested
[2:37:20] made alive like he was in Moses Oh Glory
[2:37:23] to go just a few more and we're going to
[2:37:26] close watch this now want pick a pen and
[2:37:29] write he said Jesus never did anything
[2:37:30] until SE of the father he said no what
[2:37:32] the bride received the word he shows her
[2:37:34] the word of life she shows her she
[2:37:36] receives it she never doubts it never
[2:37:38] doubt it when you hear missing limbs
[2:37:40] will restored there nothing impossible
[2:37:41] you see what science doing you see what
[2:37:43] science doing and you can't believe
[2:37:45] missing will restored you can't believe
[2:37:47] the sick will be healed you see what
[2:37:48] San's
[2:37:50] doing he said nothing can harm her
[2:37:54] believe that not even
[2:38:00] debt so that's should clear all the
[2:38:02] worries on the church all the worries on
[2:38:04] the people nothing can harm her not even
[2:38:07] debt for if the SE be planted the water
[2:38:09] will raise it up he said I got a big
[2:38:12] Hallelujah here's the secret the word is
[2:38:14] in the bride not in the head in the
[2:38:16] bride the word is in you God can't
[2:38:20] lie the word is in you watch this part
[2:38:24] now and the mind of Christ which is what
[2:38:28] intelligence the intelligence to know
[2:38:31] what he wants done with the
[2:38:34] word go they come and tell sence make
[2:38:36] car make plane make boat man see it
[2:38:40] there you know how much Aeroplane
[2:38:43] breakup and thing when the right
[2:38:44] brothers were starting to thing people
[2:38:46] laugh at them they same trying to a bird
