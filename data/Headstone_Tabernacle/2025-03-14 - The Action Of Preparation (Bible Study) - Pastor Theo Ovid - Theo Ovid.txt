be blessed so tonight I have a little title I'd like to share with you the action of preparation the action of preparation you feel to prepare then you prepare to feel true revelation brings you under expectation by preparation for manifestation true Revelation brings you on expectation why because true Revelation is Fai and Fai is what you are hoping for evidence of things not seen you are under expectation Faith or Revelation brings you dear and the evidence or proof or a view of true Revelation is how you prepare because your preparation is for a manifestation like Abraham the Revelation that God gave him not to Sarah to him Abraham he prepared booty he prepared crib he prepared himself because he knew Isaac was coming now God's idea of planning and prioritization is reflected in his operations in Genesis 1 through the darkness he spoke light day and night came into being the first day the second day and so forth now Genesis 1:26 we read this is our first scripture for tonight and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fall of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creep it upon the Earth so God created man in his own image and the image of God created he him male and female created he them this image let's call it the back part of man the part you can't see image spirit likeness then when man so then man then these are things that I I wrote on was God's seal of life on the Earth but hidden man then was the Capstone of God's creation the whales fouls Birds fishes creatures were all de in substance but man in Genesis 1 was there in spirit and Genesis 1 closed with these words in verse 31 and God saw everything that he had made and behold it was good and the evening and the morning were the sixth day so at 6 everything was completed so now we go to Genesis 2 and this is how it begins thus the heavens and the Earth were finished and all the hosts of them and on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made so note the planning and the intent of how God set creation up in the beginning in Genesis right on to where he say it's finish it is good it is so good that he could rest so everything is now sealed completed finish including the back part of man the spirit part now from the actual creation he's going to bring forth let's call it the front part of man the part that you can see this is Genesis 2 and the Lord God formed my Man Out of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living soul and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had for so we see here before he placed this physical man he planted a garden in a particular place and this shows how God prepares and give first order priority the things so God didn't just drop man on the earth no he prepared a place he prepared a garden he have a location for it and then he placed man dear so let's look at this now the order Darkness light day Sun Moon Waters moving creatures F whales creeping things Beast then man not as the others but as an image spirit being not yet visible or expressed a man that was instructed to have dominion over all others that were cre created before him went on to say there was no man to tell the ground man formed by dust of dust by dust was what God put on the earth to express this spirit being so God's objective was to get to Earth and then from Earth he gets to a man now God is going down deeper Genesis 25-1 17 and the Lord God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it so this man job assignment was given to him to dress and to keep along with Divine instructions because God spoke to this man now in a direct way about and the Lord commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou May has free eat but of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shall surely die watch the order of the Earth from the earth the man now from the man a woman another man one with a womb she was woman Genesis 2 this is God now so you could see he is not just doing things there's an order there's a priority there's a system he is using to get to where he wants to go so now man is finished Genesis one everything is done but you're not seen him Genesis 2 God took some dust for man and become a living Soul you could see him now that's a man that can tell the soil that's a man that can tend the garden that's a man who expressed in these senses could connect to the earth and the faith sent in his soul could connect to God this man in his Purity this man still have a hidden Mystery locked up inside of him and God is about to bring it out before he brings out the woman he gives the man instructions that he could eat of all the trees but that tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil don't eat it don't touch it the day you eat it you shall surely die so from this man woman came forward Genesis 2:21 and the Lord G cause a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slipped he took one of his ribs and close up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he woman brought her unto the man Adam said this is now bone of my bones Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man so from Genesis you can see the mind of God and how it unfolds we must make preparation and we must understand how we have to priorize things and we have to take this seriously first things first so your preparation brings flesh to the expectation brought on by Revelation so so if somebody's not getting ready you be know something not clicking something not striken it you want to pass your exams your preparation will reflect in your studies you want to go and get a job your preparation will reflect in how you prepare for the job interview whatever field of endeavor whether it's business school house whatever it is your preparation brings evidence of what you are expecting let's continue so it's interesting that you know I think brother Bram said aane was here when Noah was here and car was here when Noah was here because the material that man uses is of the Earth all this So-Cal technology and silicon and and all this uh uh thing that they have is things that was always here but as man's mind grow and mind man learn and he gets inspiration he develop he transform from horse and buggy to motor car to airplane to astronaut to rocket science and everything else and this is how life is man was given to conquer to rule to Reign but he is using what is already here it's not a new material they're creating it's not a new something they're making it's what is already here here is transforming human life and God did something similar he he had the Earth he had man's Spirit form he take dust and whip up and Man became a living Soul this is what we have now here preparation is not a thought you know I'm thinking about it you know no preparation is an action so when you drill down into preparation you you begin to see how you ought to priorize to get into the position to get the results of your expectation so preparation is just let's say the top level of it but when you drill down there will be priorities in how you prepare this is the dictionary expression of preparation preparation the action or process of making something ready for use or service or getting ready for some occasion test or Duty preparation a state of being prepared preparation a preparatory act or measure so I like this preparation the action or process of making something ready for for use or service or getting ready for some occasion test or Duty that's the statement that we said in the beginning you fail to prepare then you prepare to fail so even if you are not going to succeed still in that way you it still be the best thing to be prepared because they say when preparation meets opportunity they call it a luck so an opportunity come your way and you're not ready you're not prepared you're not skilled you're not you don't have the qualification you don't it can't work but here Revelation 19:7 let us rejoice and be glad and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife had me fr the Amplified let us rejoice and Shout for Joy let us celebrate and ascribe to him glory and honor for the marriage of the land is at last has come his bride has prepared herself brother Bram talk about it overcoming it cannot be God pull you through the pipe and say to him that overcome it there are things that we have to do their ways their attitudes their behaviors the quality of spirit and so on that is what God expect of us Revelation 16:15 said behold I come a teeth blessed is he that watch and keepeth his garments Le he walk naked and see his shame so clearly this is showing we should not be caught off God but we should live in a continual preparedness now if the person know the thief is coming they'll wait by the door they will call the police they will have the police in front their house They Know Thee is coming te don't come when you expecting them they for opportune moments so when Jesus made this reference behold I come as a thief it means that he comes at an awe when people don't expect that means that we have to be ready so this being made ready is a state of spiritual Readiness amen it's a space of spiritual preparedness where we are prepared spiritually where we are being made ready ready F to fulfill God purpose for your life so before any tremendous thing happen preparation must be made I want you remember that tonight before anything great happened before anything powerful happened preparation must be made if you look back in uh Christian history even the ausa street and the Pentecostal and so like that great preparation was made and what God did Luther brought Faith where brought the part and then the Pentecostal brought the spirit part that activated the spirit Open Door season that made a platform for William Mari and brown to step on to present this message this entire message now just like John the Baptist he was sent to forun Jesus coming just as John the Baptist was sent to make a way for messiah messiah doesn't come without a way me Messiah doesn't come without a place being prepared so for the Capstone for the Dynamics for the spirit itself for charity itself for the person of the Holy Ghost there must be a way made there must be a preparation so before any tremendous thing happen preparation must be made we not going to just jump in and jump out John the Baptist was sent to prepare the way his message was prepare ye the way of the Lord make his part straet what was John's message calling for repentance and alignment with God's will that was John's message repentance repent the same thing apply to us now God calling us to repent God calling us to get it right God to shoot at the Target because he wants a heart ready for his coming look how God spoke to Joshua to get the people ready Joshua 3:5 it says and Joshua said unto people than ify yourselves for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you it was a process of getting ready to inherit the promised land Joshua had was to instruct the people do not come on your wives and so on get yourself cleaned up wash your clothes it was a mindset set that points to God's holiness reverence and respect and this is where comeing to service coming to church we have to be aware and when you think about it you're not coming by the mayor or the prime minister or president you're coming to meet God so you want the reverence you want the respect you want an attitude not to impress another brother or another sister or the pastor or Elders or ministers but you have a Consciousness that the lord of the earth is looking down the lord of the Earth is sifting the hearts of men right now and with that Consciousness it gives you a certain mindset a mindset that God is he is present and there's an eye watching you do you love him tonight praise the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord oh let's continue here now see what's happening okay so so God told Joshua tell the people let the people know that they're not going to come from Egypt they're not going to live a natural caral life and just cross Jordan andh the promise you know like you know just flat and ordinary no let them know and be aware that they have to sanctify themselves now if God say sanctify yourself what are you to do I want to think about that tonight if God says that means to get yourself apart and as side sanctify yourself you have to look to see what is around you what is in your heart and on a personal note Psalms 51:10 David Cried Out create in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit within me so this is David this is David under repentance this is David under blows because of his sins because of his behavior and he's crying to God Crea me a clean heart this is a son now this is not a a nons son this is a son his name on his book this is a man after God's Own Heart and he's asking God creating me a clean heart and you know Paul said I Die daily we are under attack daily the devil is not working on us monthly yearly half yearly it's daily we are battling devils and fighting daily and we have to consecrate daily we have to commit daily we have to surrender daily create in me a clean heart and renew a right Spirit within me along in the scriptures God releases keys keys that are empowering keys that are there might look simple but they still Keys what did God tell Joshua to his success Joshua 18 this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth that means talk that speak that what that don't talk your fears don't talk your doubts don't glorify your depression and your frustration and you know my pressure and my this and my that no talk the word you can't speak what you don't know you can't express what you never soak in this book of the law the Bible the word message the scriptures shall not depart out of thy mouth what the Bible said the word is NY is even thy mouth it has to be in your heart for the abundance of the heart the mou speaks so if this word is in your heart what is it secret the word is in the bright if this word is in your heart it will come out your mouth we wouldn't hear crap coming out your mouth foolishness come out of your doish come your uh how they say unruly and all kind of crazy stuff coming out that mouth this book of the Lord shall not of thy mouth but thou shall meditate there day and night meditate yeah but Isa said over and over is not to read meditate and sometimes like tonight we're so strange I got it thought about the action of preparation and I'm just thinking about it I'm just thinking about it and I'm begin to see how God planned out Genesis I begin to see how he T of man and where to place man I begin to think about how the waters came forth and they have to have waters before you put fish before you get fish the waters have to be there it can't be a oops I made fish and look oh gosh I forget to create the water no water is fish fish is after the air is first the birds come after the Bible specify FS that fly PS of the air so so God thinks ahead God prizes okay this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate during day and night that thou May observe to do according to all that is written therein he's not talking about you doing your own thing he's talking about if you meditate you take a whole a grasp of what the scriptures declare then you could get a a real burden a word and you could accomplish and do what God say in the book for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shall have good success so God give Joshua this key meditate day and night let's bring it to us now this is this word and if we could get committed to it to study the word on a daily basis to reflect over what is preached or what is presented on a daily basis but you to have some way whether an audio in a car I like to do that I like to download things in audio form that I could listen while I'm driving so while I'm driving I'm hearing things I don't have to see it but I need to hear it so I convert a lot of messages I some convert to audio so while I'm driving I'm hearing and something might strike me and something might see a fresh so your mind is saturated you're not just idle you want this word to s State your being look at 1 Thessalonians 5:6 let us therefore not sleep Readiness I have here by being watchful therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober so therefore preparation is not a destination no it's a continuous process I was sharing with somebody that you know along long life you people complaining complaining and they're looking at happiness and joy as a destination and I said they miss enjoying the process they miss enjoying the journey life is a journey and we have to enjoy and be blessed and be happy a long life Journey you cannot say when you get here when you get dear you have to be grateful to God now you have to be thankful for God now you may not have everything that you want but you are grateful you are thankful you still have health you still have strength you still have activity in your limbs you still have the ability to raise your hands and praise God you still have M that could thank God and bless God yes you have bills you have challenges and so on but that does not cancel who God is and his grace and his Mercy towards you and I because all what we have here is temporary everything that has a beginning has an ending whether it's your house car money whatever it is we all here on a on a temporary basis we all here on a basis of uh alotment God gave a time to born a time to die we here for a space of time we don't own time time runs whether we like it or not whether we curse it or not whether we against it or not or for it doesn't matter time have nothing to do with you time just rules on and I saw in Genesis when God threw up the Earth threw up the moon and and the stars and the Sun and the bless light and greater light it set into motion this thing called day this thing called time this thing called uh hours and Sunset and everything else he set the thing in motion because he want to get man here okay so therefore let us not sleep as do others let us watch and be sober amen praise the Lord so how do we stand how do we supposed to see ourselves as you are you building up yourself are you being strengthened or you just come chur going back home Comm chch and going back home because strength and building is measurable you cannot I what it's saying but you know what you can't measure how you going to judge it how you can't measure it you say you know I have a goal but you don't State what the goal is and the time period of the goal so if you have a goal to let's say buy a car you say you want to buy a car in three years you want to save $500 a month you know what happened after 12 months is 125 66,000 000 after three years is $18,000 whatever it is and you have a goal you have a time period after a year and a half you could see whether or not you were faithful to save that amount of money or not you could see how closer you are to your goal if you say I want to buy a car I want to buy a car want buy a car and you pel $5 here pel $2 here you want to buy a bicycle tube you don't want to buy a car you want to buy something other than that you want to buy peanuts you want to buy ice cream right so if you are serious then you have to get the commitment then you have to get the preparation then you have to get the will then you have to get what are you prioritizing in order to get what you see as a as something that is beneficial to you and and in in the spirit realm it's the same we have to get it right and I want to challenge you because these things are measurable if somebody's lifting things in a gym and they only lifting up the easy ways easy ways they have Noone musles to get they not build they just killing time they just wasting time as you lift and stretch and get pain in your hand and everything else you are required to lift heavier weights heavier weights you burn off more fat you gain more muscles and you see big h spunking on and Di well buffed and and punk and shoulders and whatnot you see evidence people say wow you're working out right because they evidence of God you are applying and you're getting the results and this is what Jesus said in Matthew 7 24 4 25 24 24 and 25 therefore whosoever Hearth these says of mine and doeth them I would lighten him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon now I don't have to tell you what happened to the other guy who at take Jesus words when the rains and the floods hit him lost everything so what we draw from that is by connecting to the word in the truest sense where that becomes your Source your source of strength your source of power your source of inspiration your source then you know trials coming testing coming you know these things that are coming listen carefully ought not to take you unawares you cannot act stupid and foolish and ignorant as if you don't know this going to happen you cannot act as if what you have packaged in your mind as to your expectation as to your desire as to what you want supposed to work out as you want God have no spoil children some of us are SPO some of our children are spoed and because they always get what they want they think life is supposed to be like that life dishes out whatever they desire whatever they want and life my friend is not like that the Bible have a scripture talk about that is the race is not for the Swift and different things but time and chance happen to all men is not for the learned it's not because you are skillful and learned and you're educated or you have this and that this going to work out for you it doesn't go like that and Andrew talk share sometime about the signs of favor somebody could be uneducated and favor favors them and when favor favors you nothing could cancel it nothing could change that when God favors you nothing could change that and the Bible said Jesus from favor with God and man favor God's favor when God see David man after my own heart when God see David when Samuel was sing and carrying on God say why you crying for that man S I find a better man God happy God is pleased to find better man do you want to be a better man tonight do you want to be a better woman tonight do you want to be a better Christian tonight who are you what are you what have you become you need message so long you the message and you're hearing the word and everything else but what are you I'm not talking about what people think you are I'm not talking about your reputation what others think about you I'm talking about your character when nobody else is around who are you who are you when nobody is looking who are you when nobody is seeing who are you and you're all alone who are you and this is where I read it but I'm talking about and I was sharing this with brother Clarence I believe some I didn't work oh but a punch I said is unbelief people say they believe but baram said it this way he said when I ask people do you believe God will heal you they say yes but then he said that just at the conscious level but at the subconscious level there are doubts if God will heal let's put out to any matter if God going to deliver is God going to baptize if God going to fill with the Holy Ghost if God going to do whatever anything you think about he said the subconscious have to line up with the conscious to get it right and because we have this intellect this front part but the back part is the real part oh I just love him tonight I like that front part and back part back part was sealed front part was written but the backside was sealed with Seven Seals and God put the Thunders on the back of the bo isn't that something so the back part is the key part the subconscious part most important part that is the real you part if a man thinks in his heart as a man thinks in his heart as a man thinks in his subconscious so is he because that's the real you the real man blessed be the name of the Lord so I trust tonight that you are being edified because I want you to be under great expectation now this scripture the rain the flood came the winds blow beat upon a rock it fell it fell not because it was founded upon a rock so don't ever look at a neighbor or a brother or a sister who going through trials or going through tribulation stuff and you feel that yours is not coming no don't think that 1 Peter 4:12 says beloved think it not strange concerning what the fiery trial which is to try you so who you blaming as though some strange thing happened unto you but Rejoice which is a contrary quality amidst this F Tri but rejoice in as much as he are partakers of Christ's suffering that when his glory shall be revealed he shall be glad also with exceeding Joy is that something so this rock this building upon a rock the reason that you have to build on a rock is because what is coming is to test what you build test what we build each individual and St John 16:33 spoken these things I have spoken unto you Jesus speaks that ye that in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good share I have overcome the world this is a real comforting scripture from it you facing stuff that others don't understand don't get and you facing your own tribulation be in health be in family be in financially be whatever we business whatever but here what Jesus said be of good share I have overcome the world I discover an interesting scripture and I wish that I I could have gone deeper into it I'll just read it this is Proverbs 24:27 and it says prepare thy work without and make it fit for thyself in the field and afterwards build thy house this year sets up an order this year sets up what to do before you build your house and I think it's something to look at meditate on and think about prepare thy work without make it fit for thyself in the field and afterwards build house so it doesn't say build your house first and then do this no no no it says say one 2 three oh blessed be the name of the Lord so God because heaven is perfect heaven is not contrary Heaven do have the crazies and the Misfits and so on like that God had to make a way to bring us back to Perfection you had to make a way somehow we know the story he came himself and made that way and this is what the prophet says they started out really with grace to begin with before they had law they had Grace while they were in Egypt they some parents no one was down there was just priests and so forth they didn't have any laws the law had not yet been given Grace provided them a prophet also Grace provided them an atonement the sacrificial lamb we're getting to that this week the sacrifice the blood he says the atonement have be provided before there was any law Grace was before law so there was Joshua representing Grace right along with the law but could not be enforced as long as law was in its proper place so has the church World in this last day it's come along it's played its part but there was coming a time that it must cease it must do it there has got to be an Ephesians to this journey as there was to other Journey whereing the law could have never saved a sinner as I pointed out it could not therefore the promised land represented a day of Grace it could not take them into that Journey now you notice listen in that Journey there are three stages of that Journey first was the preparation by Fai down in Egypt under the sacrificial lamb so before The Exodus the sacrificial lamb was the preparation to get out then they crossed the Red Sea into the Wilderness a separation which represent the another SE of the journey C here we go under the preparation when they all got ready when they come to the Red Sea there was failure again the people did not believe after seeing many things that God has did they did not believe and God opened up the Red Sea took them forth and were taught that all people were baptized into Moses under the cloud and in the sea and we know the story they fail they feel and brother Brandon said and we know the scripture declares that the the authorization to apply the blood was by faith upon the tool inel the door post and something like that that was a fi act you can't sit back and say well I'm a Israelite I'm a Hebrew Glory Hallelujah I nothing apply the blood tonight night you died you died with your Hebrew self you died with your Israelite self you die with your message self I'm saying it good don't miss it now you die I 20 years I listen to that I hear that apply that this Tabernacle and this Tabernacle you could be whatever Tabernacle you could be a tabac you put a a cross on top of your head you die because the instruction world the blood not only the blood but how to apply it and where to apply it so you can't run with a message the blood the blood the blood and man just having pots of Bloods he just throwing up blood the blood Prevail and every house every shelf have blood all every room have blood but none in the door Post in L you the angel wasn't looking inside the bedroom or the kitchen or the drawing room no is when I see the blood I will pass over you your house so this is where the tire hits the road this is where we have to be be accurate in connecting with what God Said specifically if you notice God goes on in specifics he not no general you know as you feel led no very specific take the blood it must be of a certain lamb it must held 14 days take it apply it on the doorpost very specific you can say boy you know I feel that blood look good my window you go wait on your window you see if God wanted window we was going to say window but God wanted that on the door that's the opening that's the entrance that's the covering the door he wanted that blood there so tonight we want to know that we are connected to the intelligence of God or the mind of God as to what he wants done with his word preparation is not a thought preparation is an action are you getting prepared are you getting yourself already or are you just going through life and going through the motion and becoming a nice church member praise the Lord let's continue all right so I forget to pinate this what I have here so I don't even know what page I'm on we just so let's continue the token what he say a Jew could plainly show by a circumcision that he's a Believer there's many man fundamental man can take this Bible and say I'm a Believer and Jesus said by faith are we are we saved and I am believer but that baptism of the Holy Ghost is nonsense I'm reading then the token isn't applied no much how much he it's a just like the circumcision of the Jew he said I'm a Jew why do I have to go out there and act like that other bunch of Fanatics Moses standing up and down the street saying the even message is here it shall come to pass at the end of 14 days You Shall Gather the congregation together kill the lamb the whole Congregation of Israel shall kill it putting their hands upon it identifying themselves with it and the blood shall be struck upon the post upon the dle of the door when I see the blood I will pass over you for it's a token that you have accepted the debt of the Lamb that I have provided for you the blood was the token now the spirit is the token you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost not many days hence so there's a prophecy hanging over us tonight there's a prophecy hanging over you tonight you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost not many days hence and when the blood was shed the token was sent down on the day of Pentecost like a Russian Mighty win let's back up a bit Jesus came with a three and a half year Ministry to the world Known World at that time and to his disciples he demonstrated God's power and Presence by acts by things that no man has ever done before climax with the raising of the Dead Lazaro after that drama unfold to set it up that he be crucified we know the story he was crucified he rose from the dead and he did not appear in public he didn't appear to the world anymore as far as the world was concerned there's a rumor somebody take the body hide it somewhere else the rumor was just going to remain just like that a rumor two the disciples that he appeared to this was something completely different this was a private Resurrection Ministry to his elect of that day and in this Resurrection Ministry Jesus did three things he opened the word he opened the understanding and he breathed upon them receiving the Holy Ghost I want to repeat that Jesus did three things he didn't get them stuck on Mysteries stuck on the Old Testament stuck on Revelation no what sense does it make if the word is open but your understanding don't open not open you're clueless so there's a open book but you can't read there's an open book but you don't understand you can't comprehend it so you had to unlock the understanding open the word which would be the Old Testament that reveal that with stammering lips that there another tongues they shall enter into the refreshing he was pointing them to Prophecies of what was going to take place as I told a brother years ago is not to look at Jesus in it's to look at the prophecy because somebody could claim Jesus stagger Jus act like a drunk man and what I staggering I act no drunk man I speak no Tong well you are finished because the prophecy say he will stagger the prophecy said he will speak with your Tong the prophecy said you're going to act like a drunk man he said these people are not drunk as he supposed but he said this is that said Peter that the prophet Jo speaker so clearly the connection we want to connect with is the prophet's prophecy but a bram's prophecy concerning the end time bride how we are to be what we are to do how we ought to act how we ought to behave and tonight I'm trying to get to you there's a great need to prepare yourself and I'm not talking from a general perspective I'm talking about prepare yourself whether it's Zoom meeting whether it's prayer meeting whether it's service you prep don't just drag yourself don't just pull yourself prepare yourself I like to do it PR pray that you will have a certain expectation for service and to see God fulfill your expectation when you don't have an expectation whever come you take you have no testimony because you have no expect but if you pray and you are in the spirit and you're getting Revelation that Revelation supposed to shoot up your expectation so when you come you come expecting God to do something special for you for the church for the group for your family for your life you are expecting that when you have no expectation you come sick you go back sick you come dull you go back dull you come depressed you go back depressed you come frustrated you frustrated because you going to church people go to church that's a religious Behavior that's not spirituality the woman with the blood issue didn't come everybody coming oh he preaching I want listen he's saying no she came because she had a need she came because she wanted to touch she came because she was desperate she came because she had in her heart if I could just touch the H of His Garment I know my breakthrough I know I'll be healed and she was healed she got what she expected those guys those nice guy with their friend who was kind of crippled and they couldn't come in the house to the door and they rip up the roof and let their friend down that is expectation that is preparation they wasn't torting that man and then toting him back home because next day and you know with the crowd and the people boy I would think like I come too late I should come early they have nothing to do with that I how much people they I know what Fai they have or they have Fai at all so they their attitude was this how are we going to take this land we can't go from the front door we can't go to the back door the window crowded the only place we have is on top now it hard to tot a man in a in that condition up but they did it rip off the roof rip off the top and lower the man down no that is fate and with Fai you have to prepared to do things that you've never done before Oh God help me tonight Hallelujah this is where the rubber hits the wheel faith is an action and so is preparation I want you to get preparation not is a thought of preparation discussing preparation fellowship and around preparation forget that get prepared prepared to expand or prepared to contract even if you don't prepared to expand you you'll contract if you don't prepare to succeed you will fail what are you preparing for what is your expectation I could wait till we get here tonight I was under on a great expectation to to share this with you tonight that this I was an expectation because I believe this is something that you supposed to know that you supposed to get that you supposed to grasp and catch all let's see if you get continue here by the grace of God praise the Lord all right so but Ram say this here now the spirit is a token you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost not many days H and when the blood was shed the token was sent down under de Pentecost Like A rushan Mighty Wind that was the team of every apostle that was have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of the sins and you shall receive this gift of the Holy Ghost it's a token amen your pass from Death un life there you are Jewish churchs fil it out Gentiles take it over and that and that version like that now she has come out to get a remnant of the Gentile for his name's sake the bride you see what I mean see what the scripture is speaking of here if the token was not displayed then the Covenant was not effective see it must be because if you say you believe and you don't follow the instructions of the word then you don't believe aha here it is here it is right here if you say you believe and you don't follow the instruction instuctions of the word then you don't believe do you be circumcised do you join do you be baptized you have done all these like that that's still in the token the Holy Ghost so if you have your Bibles I like you to turn is 12 verses we have here of Amos chapter 4 scripture we never read but I want to read this out to you I want you to see how God could be sarcastic in addressing things God could also mock I want you to look at this c as we close we're in home right now Amos chapter 4 reading from verse one God speaks hear this word ye kind of Bashan that are in the mountain of Samaria which oppressed the poor which crushed the needy which say to their masters bring let us drink verse two the Lord God had sworn by his Holiness that L the day shall come upon you that he will take you away with hooks and your posterity with fish ones and he shall grow out at the breaches every cow at that which is before her he shall cast him into the palace sayeth the Lord come to Bethel and transgress and gigal multiply transgression bring your sacrifices every morning so God and your ties after three years offer a sacrifice of Thanksgiving with Le Proclaim and publish the free offerings for this liketh you o CH of Israel sayth the Lord and I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities and want of bread in all your places yet have you not return unto me say the Lord they teeth clean but they have no bread to eat verse 7 behold I have withholden the rain from you when there were yet three months to harvest and I cause it to rain upon one city and caus it not to rain upon another city one piece was rained upon and the peace where upon it rained not withered and two or three cities wandered unto one city to drink water but they were not satisfied yet have they not returned unto me said the Lord so you see what God did there he one city they Prosper the others come to they can't get enough but what he's looking for for the people to return to him so God sending calamities disasters issues challenges for you to get right for you to repent for you to come back to him verse N I have smitten you with blasting and mil you when your Gardens and your Vineyards and your thick trees and your olive trees increased the P devour them yet have you not return unto me say the Lord verse 10 I have sent among you the pestilence after the man of Egypt your young men have I slain with a sword I have taken away your horses I have made the stink of your clamps to come up into your nostrils yet you have not returned unto me sayth the Lord I have overthrown some of you as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and ye were as fire brand fcked out of the burning yet you have not returned unto me says the Lord therefore thus will I do unto thee o Israel because I will do this unto thee prepare to meet thy God oh Israel that's the word I want to get to prepare to meet thy God almost done for message Elijah brother I tell you tonight if we have prayed up and the nation was prayed up and the people was living Godly we wouldn't have droughts and F and pestilences and things we have now if men and women live right before God and the trouble of it is look down to your own City in lville Cross jville look down in new albani 27,000 people 40% of them has never been to church don't belong to any church 40% of the people in New ALB I for how many thousand of children in Boston and you talking about Christian Nation why Brothers he said what are we going to do no wonder God shut off no wonder we ought to get ready I believe in Amos it said prepare to meet thy God Israel being that you wouldn't hear the message and so forth he said prepare and if there ever was a time that the world ought to be preparing for the second of Christ coming of Christ is now he said you prepare for weddings why must I start to get ready to meet God preacher what are you speaking you prepare for weddings and you can be disappointed in that you can prepare to meet somewhere somewhere else you can be disappointed in that but there's one ation that you're not going to be disappointed that you got to meet God every one of you so what makes me think every time I know I see a gray here speaks to me I must get ready to meet God every time I hear sirene I know I must meet God it's preparation time every time I hear a de or thing it's a preparation time God is preparing and when you see those things you see sickness you see the doctor's office you see those things is a warning prepare to meet God for it is at time you see young man young woman here this week look back look has been he's broke down his hair are turning great beautiful young woman withering away that's a warning prepare to meet thy God God always made preparation Revelation one was preparation for the same church AG Revelation 5 was a preparation for the seven seers God always sets a preparation rians 4:1 he said come up hither and that scripture was a sign of the Rapture The Mystery of the Rapture I'm going to close with this I'm going to close coning the flesh the ways of the world the things of the world second Timothy 221 says if any man therefore Purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor Sanctified and meet but the Masters used and prepared for every good word it's not automatic gifts and calling are without repentance there are so many people rely on the gift and they don't understand the real way for the gift to come forth is backed by character backed by the quality of the spirit the gift come like the front part the character or life is coming at the back path so when you see people gifted with no life it just does not register you see people with gift to sing they start in church singing for the lord they're singing for the world now same gift God doesn't take away the gift the gift is there but who are they yielding to who are they surrendering to friends as I close preparation is an action I call it tonight the action of preparation get into action Church however you are wherever you are don't sit still take my precious brother pun tell me like bro you like drama say I I am not much in talking talking business I like to see results I like action you could consider me an action man I like action I see I visualize I'm going to act I prefer to act and not to act let us bow our heads heavenly father I thank you Lord for your love your presence Simeon might have been retired Simeon might be given a rock and chair to St on Rock but he knew that the Revelation that spoke to him you shall not see death till you see the Lord's Christ drove him to the temple every time every time he got to the temple he was under the expectation he knew death couldn't touch him until this was fulfilled one day as he sat in the temple the spirit move upon you because Mary just passed there were so many women there that he couldn't know what who but the same God that give him the Revelation produced the leading and The Guiding to guide him straight to Mary with that little swand CL hold him the man Christ Jesus and when he got to Mary inspiration move him to take the child and Bless the Child and say Lord let your servant depart in peace for my eyes have seen the glory god this is what faith does this is how Faith Works faith is not static faith is not laidback faith is not lazy faith is active just as the word is active oh God and just as in the beginning you created man in spirit therefore the spirit was always supposed to have dominion over the flesh because the spirit is the original and Paul said if that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in us is going to Quicken our mortal body we are coming back to that Lord where the spirit will have dominion over the flesh Bless the people may this little exhortation sharing with them may be strengthening and edifying to them in such a way that they will get themselves ready bless us as we look to you we come at them at their hands in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God bless you thanks again for being here I trust that you were edified strengthened and blessed we are dismissed God bless
