those three days they thought nothing was happening but he was still overcoming now what i like about this jesus he defeated the devil in heaven remember when he came up against michael and then he was kicked out by michael and he dropped to the earth and when jesus walked the earth every time he met him he defeated him when he met death he raised him up he met a leper he healed a leper every time he met him he defeated him then he went from heavenly defeat on the earth now he was on satan's grounds and he defeated him in heaven on earth in hell so your enemy is a defeated enemy [Applause] hallelujah he's a defeated enemy he's a bluff he's a liar and the conquering christ is in your heart [Applause] what did brother theo say you will win man come on you're a boxer man you trained you might have had some defeats but we're coming for the knockout punch jesus himself the chief trainer is here to tell you how to do it add to your faith fetch knowledge campus public peace and challenge himself will anoint those virtues you walk into a court they don't know what to say and you pull out knowledge because it's already there you meet the sick person on the street virtue will be pulled out in the name of jesus christ the chief trainer is here oh god what can we say about last night oh brother theophan my god may god bless him what a blessing so anointed man you don't care brother he says what god lays on his heart and then the anointing is there and the holy spirit went all over now brother says something you know when god calls a man and he's appointed by god born into the five four minutes not appointed pawn then that man no matter where he go whether it be to come back to to preach to five people he's in the body of christ anointed appointed god elected god will use him anywhere because it's not the local holy ghost like he said so if he's born in that body as a fight for monastery whether he goes to any party in the world and that body is there he's gonna be a blessing brother he's gonna anoint that party because he's born into the fight for monastery hallelujah hallelujah [Music] in the lectures on the earth yeah they found out and i checked back they said you know when they uh look for astronauts they don't just pull a guy on the side and says come we'll make you an estimated they don't think i know dick dom in harry they take guys and then they test they put them in that chair strap them up all instruments to check their pulse rate and they begin to pressurize them and if their heart starts fluttering he fails if his past goes up he's going to cause trouble because he can't fall he can't fail no good so listen god has got all the issues on you to find out if you can take the pleasure [Applause] so no matter what it does no i don't panic

pressure rising here and you are ready for the blast off and they say before the rocket leaves you don't just go out they say the first thing after the countdown you know what you see first before it leaves you see the fire spread and then you see from the fire goes the rocket we're not gonna leave here hey we're going out in power oh his eye shoulders back the fire will fall dynamics mechanics and when they come and see god says come on brother come on you're an astronaut hallelujah hallelujah oh god people say you don't need the holy ghost you need the holy ghostly he says listen oh god i'm gonna miss something one quote and get out of here resurrection is powerful but this one i must read to you listen page 66 wisdom versus faith no he acknowledged goliath's finished not wisdom but it says those we foreknew like jesus he is called those who escorted us justify those who has justified is already glorified preachers and amen now in the last days with every seed sold every seed every promise is sold oh god listen everything is in order we brought them everything you're right the world is in order they've got to be in that state the time and shape of the church is is it's in order to see the evening lights the signs like it is in the days of sodom an angel of god the holy spirit coming down moving performing signs as he did then malachi from us promise and he said allah says he promised and we see all that right here now watch then the process amen amen amen do you love him now here's the quote right here in the last days a predestinated church right here listen

careful oh god a predestinated church knowing where they stand sold with every seed the holy ghost in the church the next words careful [Applause] oh god hallelujah stand to your feet oh god you mean the holy ghost is in the church every promise is here so with every seed satan be careful the devil is in trouble brother hallelujah and today as our brother theo comes to minister the word of god father it's resurrection mourning no devil can keep me bound no situation is gonna disturb my spirit i'm here for that purpose of god to be fulfilled to be anointed oh god if god didn't meet with you yet listen man it's not too late yet and i want you to bow your head and close your eyes raise your hand to me at this moment as it's my privilege and honor to bring up our precious brother theory once more to the pulpit to minister the word of god hallelujah speak what god has laid upon his heart [Music] noise [Music] what a blessing he's been across the world wherever he's went it's been a blessing brother it's been a blessing to us already hallelujah [Music] oh god but this morning it's resurrection time and we're speaking about the resurrection in this 20th century christ in our hearts christ in our lives [Music] [Music] god praise god [Music] god hallelujah [Music] is [Music] too many dangerous fallen stairs [Music] [Music] this grace me [Music] [Music] when we get there yes [Music] and when we first this morning we say praise god praise god thank you jesus hallelujah oh praise god [Music] is [Music] hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord [Applause] thank you jesus we have so much to praise god about and christianity is based upon this morning this easter morning there's so much gods but there's only one that was raised from the dead [Music] [Applause] amen so god bless you and if you have your bibles i'd like to return to matthew 28 it's in mark 16 and first corinthians 2 for scripture reading this morning [Music] we didn't 28 verse 18 and jesus came and speak unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven on another mark 16 reading from verse 14. [Music] [Applause] afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat and abraded them with the unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen and he said unto them go into all the world and preach a gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall castle devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and from first corinthians chapter two one read from verse one and thy brethren when i came to you came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of god for i determine not to know anything among you save jesus christ and him crucified and i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of god blessed by our hearts as we pray father we thank you for this resurrection morning where you prove that not only the word is mechanics but it's also dynamics father me you're saying the dynamic power inside of here lord i may have filled the people with the holy ghost may wave after a wave of your glory sweep over the souls and lines of your people all in the campgrounds all when they're eating lord oh man they go back to their rooms may your presence speak with them in a mighty way but you send a blast of the holy ghost inside of here in jesus name i ask it amen and amen you may be seated with a title this morning the gospel not in word but in [Music] power and from our message things wasn't so from the beginning he said jesus when he came he said moses because of the hardness of your heart suffered your divorce from your wife but it wasn't so from the beginning now we find out they took the commandments of god and made them of non-effect when jesus came he found people looking to the church for salvation that's what jesus came and meant and that's the same thing to try to set up now [Applause] some people leave the churches like they lost the salvation see what did they get creeds each denomination make up their own creed and then that's what he found the people depending on the church for salvation and from man-made creeds and if he come today in person and talk to us he'll find the same thing man making the word of god fit their denomination giving them creeds and there's no salvation in the creed if it's not the bible it's got to be the bible because it is his word all we have need of is his word and his word when it when the word of god is god in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word is still god now the people look to the church instead of looking to god's word and it wasn't so from the beginning now they have left god when they left his word that's the reason we have things the way we do today is because people left the word now if a doctor wrote a formula a prescription and you add something to it or take something away from it you'll kill the patient you have got enough uh have enough antidote to upset the poison enough poison to kill the germs too much poison without the antidote will kill the patient too much antidote without the poison it will do no good that's the way with god's word it is god's prescription it is god's prescription to his people to cure every sickness every disease sin and physical whatever it may be it's all met in god's word it is god's word you cannot deviate from the word isn't that right so he said no the people today no wonder this crowd there's a miracle is passed there's no such thing as divine healing why do they do it because they've got god's word wrapped are they creed wrapped up in it and it makes the thing wrong it hasn't got no power in there and if an angel a bishop arch bishop whatever it might be come and change one word it will change the whole prescription [Applause] [Music] archbishop big man small man elder man dick man one word change the prescription hallelujah but we don't want the prescription change hallelujah hallelujah glory to god my hallelujah because jesus had all power in heaven earth has given unto me he didn't say some power he said all power hallelujah i wonder where that power is this morning [Applause] hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord so he said no okay some second coming phoenix 1955 he said i believe that we're living in one of the most marvelous days that we ever lived the most greatest time that any person that ever lived on the earth yeah he said what about the time when jesus was here when he was coming then at the scene now that was just in the middle of the earthly pilgrimage here that human being has and this time it ends up all life of mortality going into immortality now and all the sin of all ages is settling down onto this generation you hear that all the sin of all your age is settling down in this generation all the weaknesses from our fathers of inbred traditions this sicknesses and disease is breaking out like you have never known before in the world [Applause] that's why there's so much sicknesses now that's why there's so much disease now there's so much disease [Applause] hallelujah churches suffer from spiritual aids they can't resist the enemy they can't resist the coldness and the death hallelujah praise god hell have enlarged its mouth you may be seated on streams of demon powers coming upon the face of the earth so to combat that quarter to send seven angels from eternity to bring heaven down maya you may be seated and heaven consists of the [Applause] word so the rays are standing against the enemy quarter to send seven angels from eternity to bring heaven down to battle on the earth but we are going to win we heard about that last night and jesus this morning proved that we are going to be his victory [Applause] oh are you with me glory to god satan was former champion but he is not champion this morning jesus is the heavyweight champion because he rose from the dead hallelujah i said the devil is a plus he is walking in championship clothes but he is defeated easter proved that oh hallelujah [Applause] oh blessed be the name of the lord you may be seeking oh my eternity never begins never ends never had a beginning never has an ending you can't explain it but anything that had a beginning has to end so you say what about us brother branham well as long as you're a natural human on the earth here you had a beginning but if you are born of heaven you're part of god then that spirit never had a beginning [Applause] hallelujah you cannot die no more than quote [Applause] because you never had a beginner and if you've never had a beginning you could never have an ending that's what i say is victory hallelujah [Applause] spirit never had a beginning because it's part of god is eternal that's the only way you can ever live forever is that eternal life an eternal life but anything that has begins has an end so if you had no beginning watch and jesus said except a man be born again of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom no eyes enter because you have got to have eternal life so when god spoke and made man and man's souls was soul was lost anything outside of of of that joining church and anything is high breeding so when man's soul was lost church couldn't redeem man by church join them [Applause] listen to this you have got to come back god has got to speak the word back again that makes it life eternal when god speaks life into you then that's eternal again [Applause] so the devil mingled mix it up try to mix faith with something unbelief together so it makes a hybrid or when god speaks and places the holy spirit in there and seals it it's eternal so when man fell man could not receive life by group joining for manner to receive life god had to bring the word to his people so that they can receive eternal life so you must receive the word so that you could have eternal life [Music] so the devil's job was to set up church to bring creed and god's job was to bring the word and the word comes to our prophet [Applause] hallelujah are you with me and how can you hear without the preacher [Applause] and how can he preach except he be sin [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah and if he is to preach he must preach what is already in the word [Applause] he cannot preach his own interpretation he kind of preached word only [Applause] because the cosplay is nothing but only but in the power and demonstration of the spirit that your fear that you fear that your fear might not rest in the wisdom of man but in the power of god oh hallelujah glory to god hallelujah so you wouldn't be walking around going and saying that's my pastor going there that's my part that's my man over there that's my bishop going there no no no no no you would not be saying that you would say my jesus i spoke to him last night he refilled me last night he set me free last night he steal me he refilled me he delivered me [Applause] who are we anyhow my god if god didn't call me to preach i want to be among you shouting and praising the but god called me for a job and god called you for a job and i want to report for duty this morning i want to do the job this morning he called me the preacher gospel nothing word only well hallelujah glory to god father have reported for duty [Applause] two devils are on the run we're gonna run them out of johannesburg we're going to run him under south africa the bride is going to be free pharaoh let my people go [Applause] uh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah glory to god [Music] [Applause] ephesians 4 he says grieve not the holy spirit of god not the holy church of god i'm reading the holy spirit wherever you are sealed until the day of your redemption and the seal represents the finished work nothing is sealed like you load a box car you saddle in a box car i used to work on a railroad and we would load a boxcar different things but the inspector comes around first it's got to go to a lot of rough roads if there's anything loose he will not seal it until the car is loaded and compact let me ask a question who's the inspector the pastor [Applause] you may be seated she's downloading the box car i would load but the inspector comes around it's got to go through a lot of rough roads if there's anything loose he will not seal it until that car is so loaded and compact till nothing can shake it then he closes the door and seals it and it cannot be broken until it's destination god comes along and finds a lot of foolishness in us he just don't steal it yet he sees a lot of unbelief he just don't see that yet but when it's all packed up with the full gospel then he seals it till it's destination oh man so you got to be packed up with the gospel put it upon word line up online yeah little deal oh hallelujah promise after promise after promise this is a message of promises isn't that right amen you may be seated look at abraham god give him a promise that he have a son he's an old man and he's walking around god changed his name from abraham to abraham meaning father of nations and he has no evidence of being a father and yet he have to walk around with his promise he can't show anybody yet he cannot display it but he believed it no he was he was going along with seemingly the word the word the word the word but it was a word of promise it wasn't just word word would work it was word of promise it wasn't an explanation wrote or a reference text it was put a promise god promised me a son god said so hallelujah he had a personal revelation from god he may be seated so therefore he was acting on the word he was making preparation because he had revelation which brought expectation so whenever god gives you revelation you'll find yourself making preparation because revelation brings expectation it's revealed to you so seven thunders gives fate which is revelation that gives us all these years expectation for its real dynamic pride revival so year in year out convention and convention out we were preaching with revelation with expectation for a dynamic manifestation preachers come preachers go people come people go but we are steadfast it will rain hallelujah oh my god you maybe see that some left some thought they had it already but they got it again praise god i think they got it already but they got it again some try to do their own thing but they still have to come back in line with the word i promise because dynamics is promised [Applause] amen amen do you believe that [Applause] so you may be seated so go to libram that his wife to his wife's son now abram did not believe sarah's body [Music] because if you keep looking at sarah's body he will get he wouldn't believe [Music] so he stopped looking at sarah's body and look at the promise [Applause] so stop looking at you stop looking at yourself and look at the promise of god [Applause] hallelujah you may be seated abraham knew that syrah don't have the power syria is all but you know god has the power now if he could get the word to sarah sarah could change if he could get the power to save us all will change so he stopped watching syria and he's watching the power [Applause] hallelujah glory to god so stop watching a wrinkle of life of unbelief and watch the promise this morning because he who made the promise is able to keep the promise because he proved oh glory to god oh hallelujah you may be seated remember the word is what brings the miracle [Music] there's a word of healing there's a word of deliverance isn't that right you have to take the word first and then it produces a miracle [Applause] abraham took the word first and sarah got a miracle [Applause] mary took the word first be it done unto me according to thy word [Applause] and if you want that miracle of transformation you have got to take the word first now remember the word was lost through the ages it is out of peace so god had to gather the scattered word and tied mark in the word to bring down the holy ghost [Music] so the very person of god was scattered through all the edges so forgot to restore his person back in the church he had to send the angels to pick up what luther left off to pick up what wesley left to pick up what the penny costa left off got it all together you may be seated so the restoration of the world bring back a restoration of his person that's why the pillar of fire came along in this last day to vindicate the fullness of word has come in the fullness of time to manifest the fullness of the body [Applause] where is the pillar of fire this morning [Applause] you may be seated [Applause] [Applause] oh my [Music] praise god so first the word in america you know the word could be sent you know the word is faster than any aeroplane [Applause] before the doctor's knife touches my wife the tumor will go down [Applause] that's the word and the doctor is on the operating table his knife is coming down and the word cut there before the knife [Applause] glory so the word could get to you before the devil could even touch you [Applause] have faith in god hallelujah have satan god anything could happen this morning oh hallelujah my god could you imagine brother brandon come back here and say have faith in god what are you going to do you may be seated oh man [Applause] what about the centurion [Applause] he said i'm a man under authority no he didn't say i'm a man in authority he said i'm a man under authority [Music] because i have authority you must be under authority somebody must give you authority to have authority so he didn't say i'm a man in authority he said i'm a man under authority i said to one call and he cooked it i said to one comedy just speak the word and i know and i know and i know my servant is gonna be here [Applause] [Applause] when he was on his way he said what time what if his son was healing he just wanted to confirm the same time the word was spoken what time was he healed [Applause] oh you may be seated so to have authority you must be under authority to have power you must be under power and jesus said all power in heaven and in earth is given unto me he said as my father sent me oh hallelujah my god hallelujah glory to god so the father give jesus the power and jesus give the church the power i said where is the power this morning when this easter morning he passed listen he went down to hell and knocked on that door my god and when they opened up that was the mighty conqueror he didn't ask for the keys he took the keys he said i've got it now hallelujah glory to god you may be seated last night we were talking about claims but this morning you would see why you ought to be claiming because easter morning brought up the enforcer [Applause] the enforcer to enforce your claims you may be seen so could you imagine your father left you inheritance you have piece of land somewhere here in south africa and squatters building houses on your land and you've been a nice christian saying that's my land my father left that back for me and one house going up two hours three houses four houses and that's my land that doesn't song right now if that's your land you go to the authorities and you show them the deed and then they could bring the enforcers and they said get out get out get out [Applause] what about that sickness in your body what about that sickness in your body the enforcer is here to tell that sickness get out in my name we shall cast our devils glory to god the enforcer is here to produce signs wonders miracles these signs shall follow them that believe [Applause] oh man [Applause] you may be seated hallelujah mata said lord if i had been here my brother had not died i know wherever the world is there cannot be no death the world will multiply bread and feed the hungry the world will raise the dead the world will make the crippled walk it's lord if you have been here i know things would be different but even now but even now 1996 even now [Applause] hallelujah even now oh hallelujah you maybe see that oh my and the fate of mary and mata show jesus in another gear and he said if you have faith if you could call even now you you want to move something do something roll away the stone it's not i alone in this thing you have a part to play too and if you could say even now you have got something to do if you believe that i could do it roll away this through could you imagine the act in some sister to roll away the stone she didn't send for no brothers she didn't set for no deacons she didn't have no elders she was so excited she run there and her faith was pushing her faith was pushing back that storm because jesus said i am the resurrection and i am the life itself and if he is dead he could live again [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah glory to god hallelujah glory to oh man oh hallelujah and jesus words was with power it wasn't just words he was speaking he was speaking words you say my words my spirit and life my words shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish the purpose that i said and when jesus said lazarus comfort the world was traveling lazarus soul was traveling and the word was with power and the word from lazarus and the word brought the soul to the spirit and the word brought the spirit to the body and he was raised from the dead [Applause] [Music] oh my you may be seated oh hallelujah so i don't care if you're cold inside this morning i don't care if you're lukewarm i don't care if you have been staying home that's a nice word for being backslidden you can stay when the power of god is rocking the church stay home to do what he is raised from the dead [Applause] he is not in the sixth seal church hallelujah he has nothing to get churches hallelujah oh man hallelujah [Applause] he's not there oh my god [Applause] he is not there this is the prize revival not the church revival the touchdown won the seven thunders the church john won the person of the holy ghost the churchill wants a baptism after baptism but we want it we are going to have it [Applause] [Music] what do you think we'll take into the rapture do you think the pastor will have a list of the names of the believers gonna rapture and say jesus look them here come on come on you have to have the same magnetism of the holy ghost [Applause] because there are between a bed one will be taken the other gonna be left there between a field one so it's the individuals [Music] oh my god hallelujah you may be seated you see god know you by name not by group identification [Applause] that's why daniel said every name in the book shall be delivered and god works in the law of his own word you may be seated and the jubilee time every 50th year a trump producer blow to all the land nathan a wall cd in trouble [Music] you can't hear the trumpet pastor bella was so high forget it kevin come to a meeting like [Music] but the this were commissioned go out to all the land and blew it tell them you're free you could go free you could be filled this morning with the holy ghost your life could be changed yes you could be delivered this morning all from every spirit from all unbelief from every doubt every frustration every fail you know what the gospel is it's good news not bad news not this one fall on this one it's good news good news i bring you good news this morning revival is in the land dynamics oh hallelujah so the gospel didn't bring negatives did gospel bring positives oh my oh praise god listen to this the challenge in jesus time was to shake people up to the traditions the pharisees the sad you see i like to say so they were sad you see no joy no praise just looking mean that's the sad you see dad the pharisee the sad you see the herodians all of them set in their ways and this little galilean called jesus came and shook them up with a different message you must be born again [Applause] he brought a different message the kingdom of god is at hand he brought a message of the kingdom he may be seated hallelujah this little galilean called jesus he wasn't bringing a reference text because the first text he read from isaac 61 they thought he was just given a reference the thought was just another quote but he said today in your hearing the scripture is fulfilled [Applause] and i could see those sleepy pharisees fulfilled who said that who said fulfill who said messiahs on earth now who said dynamic is here who said we get our revival whose help we get shout and receive the holy ghost [Music] [Applause] but he was bringing the god of the old testament alive he was bringing the god that met moses and david he was bringing it alive what is the kingdom the kingdom is the word made spirit and power [Applause] for 400 years they had no prophets they had churches upon churches upon churches when john the baptist came he came different he didn't he didn't stay in his father's church he went in the wilderness [Applause] because he had a different message from his father he had to announce the coming of messiah and that kind of different is different from traditions [Applause] a rocket man named john no smooth words he was a rough man eating wine lucas and honey brother he was something else but he said messiah is coming somebody said john but you're something else he said me no you think i'm something else where'd the dynamics come wait till messiah come we're till charity the bright absolute strikes [Applause] i'm only announcing he's coming you may be seated or you could even go way beyond that before that and the messiah was two years old crashing into jerusalem with two wise men crashing in jerusalem crashing into jerusalem was three wise men they traveling two years and when they hit the city they wasn't saying um uh could you give me the address of um wait waiting jesus is born no when they hit the city where is he listen they thought the whole that johannesburg was shouting they thought the whole of johannesburg was rejoicing they thought everybody was in revival because they thought everybody knew messiah was on earth [Music] you may be seated only to find out they didn't even know sahara said what court is that again what what um messiah what what book what what where is the rising of the sun equipment where finding that one [Applause] you may be seen there they see these wise men with light led by a star or when they hit among the so-called caretakers and builders and protectors of the message the star left them and as soon as they get from among that crowd is that came back and then they rejoice with great joy my god hallelujah brother when you get among a bunch of unbelief you lose the star mind but when they get away from unbelief you'll see that star these wise men didn't travel for two years for nothing they didn't travel all those mines for nothing they came for something no they were wise men each had their personal revelation of messiah [Applause] they didn't form a municipal association and said let's discuss um how we should approach jerusalem let us put up together my one gift [Music] [Applause] to contribute to the unfolding mystery of identifying messiah [Applause] you may be seated so when they call to the the child jesus time to unveil the gifts everything had was a mystery behind it because they didn't discuss it upon another actually i read somewhere where they didn't even leave together they met along the way [Music] so then one brought gold to identify that as god this is god here [Applause] another one brought frankincense this is service here this is called service so it's been revealed now another one brought more it means that this is caught in service today the purpose is identified [Applause] [Applause] [Music] now the bride must get a sense of mission oriented the pride must get a sense of purpose what are we to become [Applause] [Music] before the rapture [Applause] are we to become a super race a super church as we near the headstone as the plagues keep coming coming coming it's power supposed to come power power power because one little player is going to meet the power and sons of god gonna push back the plagues they're gonna stop sicknesses they're gonna stop diseases [Music] [Applause] you may be seated what is our purpose or are we going to hope the pastor bring a good message [Music] and see if what we've seen is in the world [Applause] [Music] god is still god and in order to be god he must remain god and i say this morning he's still almighty [Applause] not some mighty almighty does that mean he could do anything do you believe that oh man you may be seated praise god hallelujah [Applause] he was promising sunday gideon was stressing wheat and god came down and said i'm the god of abraham isaac jacob i'm the one that brought you out of egypt i'm the one that gives you what you have got turned to me there he and his father came out christian as wheat and angel came to him and he thought it was an angel it happened to him turn out it wasn't an angel it was god himself it was capital lord the lord [Applause] and when he spoke to gideon gideon was a little surprised because god's a gideon the mighty man of valor [Applause] [Applause] no that was good thoughts about gideon but that wasn't gideon thoughts about himself [Applause] he may be seated so many times i think we retain the things we believe about ourselves is how we live how we act bible said as a man thinking in his heart so is he so if you think you're defeated you are yeah yeah i am right if you believe you are going to break through you will get a breakthrough just what you think in your heart [Applause] amen so sometimes a lot of times the kind of thoughts we harbour and encourage if you think negative to what you'll be a negative person so what you have to do is to begin to think positive about the promises of god to you pray about it think about it act on it because god is not operating on the level of your emotions that you're not feeling that you're gonna make it he's not operating on that level amen you may be seated see so god wants to bring his word to you so you could be feeling sick here this morning but god is not operating based upon you are sick he wants to bring his word of healing to you you could be born this morning but god's not operating on that level of how you feel and i'm feeling that i couldn't get a breakthrough that's your feeling but how does god feel about you [Applause] so you may be feeling however you're feeling but god feeling positive towards you you might be feeling bonked but he want to tell you you will be delivered [Applause] you may be feeling sick but you're going to be healed you'll be hungry for the holy ghost you shall be filled [Applause] so gideon didn't know he was a mighty man of allah he thought he was just an ordinary man he thought he had to take all the pressures that medianite was giving him he thought he had to continue taking the pressure from the enemy that's what he was thinking all the time this is my lord you know many christians you know this is my portion [Music] [Applause] what are gonna do tell me what you're gonna do you're gonna find out what you're supposed to do you're not supposed to take that who say you supposed to take that from the anime watch but he was a mighty man of valor [Applause] yet that understanding wasn't unlocked that understanding wasn't unfolded that understanding wasn't revealed or made known now as long as he doesn't know that he will continue to live as he lived hallelujah and act as he act oh my praise be to jesus [Applause] look at moses moses in exodus street of the firemen just want to just go through it quickly moses saw the burning bush and you get up there and the holy god spoke to moses they put off thy shoes off thy feet for the police well though stan is holy ground then he identify himself again i'm the god of abraham isaac and jacob and the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in egypt and i've heard their cry by reason of their task masters for i know their sorrows and i'm come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them out this is god telling moses now i come down to deliver them and bring them out and so forth until land flowing milk and honey and so forth now therefore behold the crowd the chair of israel has come to me i've also seen the oppression where the egyptians oppress them come now therefore and i will send the interfero that all means bring forth my people the chair of israel out of egypt now when god was talking about he come down that was fine for moses when god was talking about he's going to deliver them and give him a good land that was fine but when god says come now therefore and i will send thee that was a problem because moses said unto god who am i that i should go unto pharaoh so then god says certainly i will be with thee and so forth amuden said no if i go on they don't want to hear me know what i'll tell them so you're still trying to dodge a little bit so i'll say he said i am that i am and thus shall you know and so forth and different things like that praise be to jesus isn't that right amen and moses answered and said but behold they will not believe [Music] someone is still trying to dodge as much as he could the lord said what is in thy hand god's going to demonstrate supernatural now said i read he said cast it down turn into a snake let him put his hand let us put it back his heel now with all of that and god spoke to moses and moses come again and shall come to pass if they will not believe that okay then after god do all of that moses said no moses said the lord lord i am eloquent i'm not eloquent either i could neither here to a since that was spoken that i served i am sort of speech a slow tongue every excuse after all of that god said you're still going [Applause] [Music] so where do you think you're hiding oh hallelujah you were raised up for a purpose to prove to the devil you're not like you you are going to overcome you are going to get victory oh hallelujah glory to god hallelujah oh my god oh hallelujah praise god am many many many men hallelujah so you are a mighty pride of father come on throw your swords against the enemy oh hallelujah praise god thank you lamb of god oh my hallelujah you may be seated praise god so the thing that has to take first is the word don't go off on some tantrum obama saying and think you can do it you have got to come back to the world and get the conditions right you must believe his word and act upon every word that he said to see the mighty works of god remember if you just uh believe in you have to believe it and act upon it what did the woman the way the woman she was commanded to feed elijah she didn't even know it god spoke to elijah and said i have commanded i have ordered a weird woman to feed thee and the woman knows nothing about it [Applause] she didn't even know she is an ordained cook [Applause] to feed that elijah [Applause] [Music] hallelujah may i feel good now you may be seated all she knows she have a little meal a little oil she's gonna make a little cake and she and her son gonna die that's that's her understanding that is her little world but in god's mind in god's eternal purpose she's gonna feed elijah and here comes elijah walking to get a meal [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] have hallelujah in god caught to do anything glory to god while the world is going forth you can be sealed you can be healed you can be delivered god is still gone [Applause] you may be seated so here up comes the man of god take me a cake [Music] you can first the tension there this is all that i have lord what what i'm gonna do here now he said first before you feed yourself and your son dick me first that's something moved upon her you see quarters work on both sides [Applause] she took she took that word and she obeyed and as she turned to obey just say the law children you said i've been there and the lord saved me oh hallelujah my god may be seated a commanded blessing oh hallelujah so what happened she took the word first and then saw the miracle and when you pray for what what is your attitude when you pray when you ask god do you act upon what is promised or do you forget what you pray and forget what you ask when if god promises to deliver you you have to act upon it if god promised to fill you with the holy ghost you got to act upon it you cannot claim being bound you cannot claim being sick you cannot claim depression and unbelief you cannot claim i cannot get a breakthrough these are things you cannot say you must not say i cannot get fit you cannot say that when god gave a promise he cannot lie he always answers [Applause] he may not answer according to how you feel or think a word but he always answers [Applause] you may be seated so i challenge you this morning to act upon what god has promised you know why because you didn't make the promise and if god is big enough to be god he is big enough to keep his promise [Applause] hallelujah if god is big enough to be god he is big enough to keep his promise to you [Applause] oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah oh praise be to jesus oh my god hallelujah thank you jesus so this is what abandonment said he said i don't care how long it takes he said you say i've received the word of god you've been prayed for and the holy spirit promised you healing then i don't care how long it takes till it comes still act on your commission act like you're healed giving god praise just keep going on you say well by the brand and i never received the holy ghost yet accept the promise and keep acting [Applause] oh hallelujah gloria you may be seated no noah built right on here holding on to it preaching all the time standing right at the door of the act preaching to them building away and preaching to them that's the real prophet of god today standing right in the ark christ jesus if he be in me my words in you just keep building hungering them up everywhere they are chinking up every hole don't let the devil have no loop nowhere no stay right at the door and preach now watch noah before he saw the mighty miracles of god to know that he was god he's seen the promise first he cut the promise and held onto it and acted upon the promise until he saw the mighty miracle of god hallelujah so before you see the mighty miracles of god you have got to see the promise [Applause] hallelujah what was the promise it will rain [Applause] you may be seated and what's the promise today perfection adoption seven thunders praise god pull all these are promises and you've got to take a whole of it [Music] not just believe it but take a hold of it in other words get locked in with it oh my god so maybe see this so when you believe the word and you act upon it at the end of it there's a miracle for you i'd say that again at the end of acting upon the word there's a miracle for you at the end of it [Applause] now listen to this moses going on his road to egypt with a stick in his hand a one-man invasion i know he said no he's going to take over with a dry stick in his hand see he'd done it too sure he did why he was acting how do you know well when you get down there listen to the voices speaking listen to the thoughts that is coming to moses man when you get down there pharaoh will hang you he's been looking for you for 40 years and whenever he finds you you'll certainly go on you have killer egyptian you know what it is even smite and egyptian is dead and here you don't kill one and hit him and run away when you get back there it's dead [Music] now just think about the kind of nine battles moses had to go through he took our mind back who want to go back egypt certainly not moses but he was acting upon what god told him [Applause] now if he was to study from a natural standpoint he would study but what a good thing but i can't go back dinner because i don't kill a man already and push up on my mind he might lock him up you know but moses went past all of that you may be seated he went past his failures he short comments moses had all of that to contend with yet he was acting upon what god promised he said you go and i'm going to deliver my people you go and let pharaoh know let my people go here was a weak man here was a runaway here was the sea man not the different moses he was the same man weak man the same man sailing man that same man was now an anointed commissioned man so don't tell me you cannot be anointed [Applause] the same week you the same sin of you the same failure you go read a cut don't tell me you cannot make it you are going to make it [Applause] oh don't tell me you cannot be delivered don't tell me you cannot be fair don't tell me you cannot be set free don't tell me the cannot walk don't tell me the blind cannot see you don't tell me that that cannot be raised oh my he may be seated hallelujah [Applause] [Music] moses acted first then he saw the mighty miracles when god told him to walk towards the sea he had to go towards the sea to see the mighty miracles and sometimes god may send you where seemingly have no way but he wants to reveal his omnipotence he wants to unveil his power he wants to get honor over hero and his horsemen no god could have led them differently but god led them to the red sea where the box was against the wall mountains on each side it seemed like we have no way to go in this message praise god but all of a sudden stand still hallelujah and see the salvation of our court [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] man hallelujah an ordinary man with a little crooked stick raised up that stick and he was supposed to be a god of the earth and when moses raised that stick the scene knew what to do i say when moses raised that stick direct scene knew what to do open up glory to god oh hallelujah come on these sons of god know what to do of course sons of god was given authority over the earth over the sea over everything look at elijah when he was going down the jordan river he didn't even pray he took his mantle children have to open up a son of god is coming true [Applause] hallelujah glory to god that's what i'm talking about we've got to know who we are we have got to
