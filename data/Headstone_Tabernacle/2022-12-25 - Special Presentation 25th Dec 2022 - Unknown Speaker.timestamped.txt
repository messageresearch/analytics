[3:35] morning but we thank you for the gift of
[3:38] your love that has given us this
[3:40] opportunity to serve you in spirit and
[3:43] Truth father God May our hearts Rejoice
[3:45] this morning and be full of praise and
[3:47] thanksgiving for you for what you have
[3:49] done and the price that you have paid
[3:52] granted Lord and Jesus might ask it amen
[3:55] and amen
[3:57] well this morning is a special
[3:59] presentation we have and we'd like to
[4:01] share something with you and then we
[4:03] have a service that we like to play for
[4:05] you reading from Matthew chapter 2
[4:08] reading from verse 10 to 11. and when
[4:11] they saw the star they Rejoice with
[4:13] exceeding great joy
[4:15] and Wendy would come into the homes they
[4:18] saw the young child with Mary his mother
[4:20] and fell down
[4:23] and worshiped him
[4:24] and when they had opened their Treasures
[4:26] they presented unto him gifts gold
[4:31] frankincense
[4:33] and murder
[4:34] may God bless his word
[4:36] and gold frankincense and myrrh these
[4:40] are the three wise men that travel from
[4:42] far with a revelation that they will be
[4:45] able with their gifts that they could
[4:47] identify the Messiah For That season and
[4:51] we know goal frankincense and myrrh and
[4:56] they were not copying one another
[4:57] following one another what this one
[5:00] doing this one doing and so on like that
[5:02] they were moving by Revelation each one
[5:04] having a Consciousness that the gifts
[5:08] that they had and they brought was going
[5:11] to identify something
[5:13] they may not have it together to say how
[5:16] we're going to blend in together but the
[5:19] new the gift that God gave them was from
[5:22] God gold speaks of deity
[5:26] frankincense speaks of service
[5:29] and myrrh speaks of death
[5:32] but the combination of these three gifts
[5:35] spoke of God in service
[5:38] to die
[5:40] and
[5:42] the prophet said something here the
[5:43] things that we bring to him
[5:45] identify what our thoughts is about him
[5:48] you understand what I mean
[5:50] if you believe it with all your heart
[5:52] every word of God you will identify it
[5:55] by giving all that you have to it
[5:59] deity
[6:01] had to be put to death
[6:03] in order to save the imperfect one what
[6:07] a great thing
[6:08] and when
[6:10] Mary Magdalene she
[6:13] but this murder to anoint Jesus in John
[6:15] 12 7 Jesus said let her alone against
[6:18] the day of my burying that she kept this
[6:20] it's expensive ointment for the poor
[6:23] always you have with you but me ye have
[6:27] not always so we are grateful for
[6:29] Christmas it's not to say I give Jones a
[6:32] gift and they give back one I'll see
[6:34] what I've got in the morning why don't
[6:36] you open up your heart and see
[6:38] and see what's in there
[6:40] find out what you got in here
[6:43] if we find it empty with negative trees
[6:46] and cares of the world why not ask
[6:48] Christ to fill it tonight tonight so
[6:51] that you will get the real meaning of
[6:53] Christmas it is Christ in you God
[6:57] dwelling in the human heart that is what
[7:01] the real Christmas Means so God
[7:05] anointed Jesus with the fullness of
[7:07] himself he was God's gift to the world
[7:10] and the wise men are clearly identified
[7:13] they were offering their gift to him
[7:15] show that in their heart they knew who
[7:18] he was what he was going to do for them
[7:21] so no wonder the first thing they did
[7:23] they fell down
[7:24] perfectly in order
[7:26] and worship him
[7:28] before they could even understand it
[7:31] they fell down and worshiped him and
[7:35] then presented their gifts and that's
[7:38] the way to have real Christmas
[7:40] worship Him
[7:42] then present your gift
[7:45] presenting your body a Living Sacrifice
[7:49] holy and acceptable to God
[7:52] guided
[7:54] these men with those gifts
[7:57] God guided in my Giants
[8:00] because they had the right gifts
[8:03] and God guided these wise men because
[8:06] they had the right
[8:08] identified gift
[8:10] to identify his son and may I say this
[8:14] God because of the word spoken of a
[8:18] faithful Ministry with protect
[8:21] guide and look over those gifts that
[8:25] will be for the Perfection of the Saints
[8:27] and bringing that bride into the statue
[8:29] of a perfect man
[8:31] so I say this always watch what these
[8:34] ministerial gifts are identifying
[8:37] or what they are pointing to
[8:40] Christ here we go was identified by goal
[8:46] my and frankincense
[8:49] and I wanted
[8:51] to challenge you to look again at these
[8:54] treatings goal God
[8:56] mer dead frankincense service
[9:01] every life
[9:03] must have that same identification
[9:09] so your life must have an identification
[9:11] of God
[9:12] your life must have an identification of
[9:15] death
[9:16] and your life must have identification
[9:18] of service
[9:21] and he will protect the gift that you
[9:24] are
[9:25] and the gift that you have until his
[9:28] purpose
[9:29] issues
[9:31] and as I close to this part here
[9:34] praise the Lord
[9:36] blessed be the name of the Lord
[9:41] Joseph
[9:43] Mary Joseph
[9:46] see me what was Isaiah prophecy under us
[9:48] son is born a child has given you shall
[9:50] be called counselor Prince of Peace
[9:52] Mighty God Everlasting father of his
[9:54] kingdom there shall be no end he knew
[9:57] who that would be he saw the whole thing
[10:00] when the angel of the Lord told him that
[10:03] this which is conceived in her talk
[10:06] about Mary is of the Holy Ghost a virgin
[10:09] shall conceive and be a son that was a
[10:12] great mystery the super sign that God
[10:15] gave to all the world a super sign that
[10:18] he was his son now notice as we go on
[10:22] when Jesus
[10:25] was being formed in Mary here we go
[10:29] when Christ Jesus was being formed in
[10:33] Mary that is when the persecution set in
[10:36] that's right
[10:38] that is when our persecution started
[10:42] and it's the same thing in you
[10:45] Galatians 4 19 says when Christ
[10:48] the hope of glory formed in you when
[10:52] Christ here we go is being formed in you
[10:55] when you are dying that's the main part
[10:59] when you are dying
[11:01] and Christ is coming to life
[11:05] watch the persecution set in what
[11:09] troubles start on every hand
[11:11] watch The Devil go on a rampage
[11:14] certainly when Christ
[11:16] is being formed in you
[11:19] and when Christ
[11:21] was being formed in Mary quickly come to
[11:25] King's commandment all the people the
[11:27] Christ was being coming a full baby
[11:30] ready to be delivered and right then
[11:33] great persecution
[11:35] what is the prophecy hanging over the
[11:38] bride that the full word which is the
[11:40] full seed will be born into
[11:43] manifestation
[11:45] the Dynamics
[11:46] to normal mechanics so praise the Lord
[11:49] so now we will hear a special exude from
[11:53] the prophet of Malachi for brother
[11:54] William Marion Brown and then we come
[11:57] back right after that may the Lord bless
[11:58] you praise him
[12:02] for a little consecration service
[12:10] a little hard here tonight A dwelling
[12:12] place for Christ
[12:17] remember tonight
[12:20] my odd little story of the trans
[12:23] denied Greely Jesus Christ is that
[12:26] on the street right
[12:31] he was a on the street oh yeah we
[12:34] say we serving sure all the tinsel and
[12:37] glamor that's not him
[12:41] he had to die to bring you this gift
[12:45] not a doll but life he had to die in
[12:49] order to do it to get to you the only
[12:51] way he could get be he could just come
[12:52] here and be a perfect man like he was
[12:54] and get to you he couldn't do it that
[12:56] way he had to die to do it to get get
[12:59] the gift of God to you
[13:01] like the train had to die to get the
[13:04] little dog to his funeral
[13:06] Christ had to die
[13:08] to get God to you we want to accept it

[58:18] so I greet you this morning in the
[58:20] precious name of Jesus Christ and if you
[58:22] have your Bibles can we turn to just one
[58:24] portion of scripture reading from Saint
[58:27] Matthew chapter 2. and reading from
[58:30] verse one thank you brother Anthony
[58:31] thank you musicians
[58:36] Matthew chapter 2
[58:39] reading
[58:41] from verse 1.
[58:45] now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of
[58:48] Judea in the days of Herod the king
[58:50] behold became wise men from the East to
[58:54] Jerusalem seeing ways he that is born
[58:57] King of the Jews
[58:59] for we have seen his star in the east
[59:01] and have come to worship Him
[59:04] when Herod the king had heard these
[59:06] things he was troubled and all Jerusalem
[59:09] with him
[59:10] and when he had gathered all the chief
[59:13] priests and scribes of the people
[59:16] together he demanded of them where
[59:18] Christ should be born and they said unto
[59:21] him in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is
[59:24] written by the prophet and thou
[59:27] Bethlehem in the land of Judah are thou
[59:29] are at not the least among the princes
[59:31] of Judah for out of thee shall come a
[59:34] governor that shall rule My People
[59:36] Israel then Herod when he had privily
[59:39] called the wise men inquired of them
[59:42] diligently what time the star appeared
[59:45] and he sent them to Bethlehem and said
[59:48] go and search diligently for the young
[59:50] child and when he had found and when he
[59:52] had found him bring me word again that I
[59:54] may come and worship him also when they
[59:57] had heard the king they departed and low
[59:59] the star which we saw in the East went
[1:00:01] before them till it came and stood over
[1:00:04] where the young child was and when they
[1:00:06] saw the star they rejoiced with
[1:00:09] exceeding great joy and when they were
[1:00:11] coming to the house they saw the young
[1:00:13] child with Mary his mother and fell down
[1:00:15] and worship him and when they had opened
[1:00:18] their Treasures they presented unto him
[1:00:20] gifts gold and frankincense and moo and
[1:00:24] being warned of God in a dream that they
[1:00:26] should not return to Herod they departed
[1:00:28] into their own country another way
[1:00:31] and when they were departed behold the
[1:00:33] angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in
[1:00:35] a dream seeing arise and take the young
[1:00:37] child and his mother and flee into Egypt
[1:00:39] and be thou there until I bring the word
[1:00:41] for Herod will seek the young child to
[1:00:44] destroy him and when he arose he took
[1:00:46] the young child and his mother by night
[1:00:48] and departed into Egypt and there was
[1:00:51] and was there until the death of Herod
[1:00:54] that it might be fulfilled which was
[1:00:56] spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying
[1:00:57] out of Egypt have I called my son then
[1:01:01] Herod when he saw that he was mocked of
[1:01:03] the wise men was exceeding wrought and
[1:01:05] send forth and Sue all the children that
[1:01:07] were in Bethlehem and on all the cause
[1:01:09] there are from two years old and under
[1:01:11] according to the time which he had
[1:01:13] diligently inquired of the wise men may
[1:01:16] the Lord had a blessing to the reading
[1:01:17] of his word you may be seated
[1:01:20] so I have a title this morning for uh
[1:01:24] Christmas encouragement or Christmas
[1:01:26] message and my title is we have seen his
[1:01:29] star
[1:01:30] we have seen his star and for a subject
[1:01:34] the voice of the sign and an inspiration
[1:01:37] the identification of the true
[1:01:41] worshipers
[1:01:43] you know and we know from the message
[1:01:45] and we know through studying scripture
[1:01:46] but the Brandon brought it out so many
[1:01:48] times that December the 25th is not the
[1:01:52] day that Jesus would have been born and
[1:01:54] that date would have evolved from a
[1:01:56] mixture of trying to mix romanism with
[1:01:59] Christianity and paganism but the
[1:02:02] reality is as brother Branham said he
[1:02:04] said whenever people are speaking about
[1:02:07] Christmas the real Christians have a
[1:02:09] responsibility to bring up the truth of
[1:02:12] the birth of Jesus Christ because if
[1:02:14] Christ was not born there would be no
[1:02:16] salvation and if Christ was not born
[1:02:19] there would be no Redemption and if
[1:02:21] Christ was not born there would be no
[1:02:23] restoration and if Christ was not born
[1:02:25] there would be no deliverance and if if
[1:02:28] Christ was not born there would be no
[1:02:30] healing so the celebration of the birth
[1:02:33] of Christ is something that we ought to
[1:02:35] celebrate every day it is not just in
[1:02:38] December it is not on a certainty it is
[1:02:40] a celebration because it is connected to
[1:02:43] directly to who we are because if he did
[1:02:46] not come he could not have died if he
[1:02:48] did not come he could not have walked
[1:02:50] underwater
[1:02:52] and God rich in his grace and mercy
[1:02:55] promised a king he promised a governor
[1:02:57] he promised a ruler and he brought a
[1:03:00] baby
[1:03:01] [Applause]
[1:03:03] so when the devil is looking for a king
[1:03:05] and looking for a governor and looking
[1:03:06] for looking Harriet and looking for a
[1:03:08] horse here comes a baby and God slips a
[1:03:11] baby right under the devil's nose and
[1:03:13] that and that baby is born and right
[1:03:16] there in a Manger can the Church Say
[1:03:18] Amen
[1:03:19] so I greet you this morning and on
[1:03:21] behalf of brother Ovid and the ministry
[1:03:23] we want to wish you a blessed merry
[1:03:25] Christmas and I want to quote the
[1:03:27] prophet and a message says we would see
[1:03:29] Jesus he said God bless you not exactly
[1:03:32] a merry Christmas but God's blessings of
[1:03:35] Christmas be upon you may the Christ of
[1:03:37] Calvary hide you in himself blanket you
[1:03:41] so wrap you and enthrown you in his word
[1:03:44] till his word will be made flesh in you
[1:03:47] is my prayer and that is our prayer that
[1:03:49] is our desire for every believer here
[1:03:52] this morning can the Church Say Amen so
[1:03:56] we are going to be in the world this
[1:03:58] morning I'm excited about what is
[1:04:00] happening and I'm so happy to see the
[1:04:02] Believers who made it out here today
[1:04:06] you know Christmas is a time is a
[1:04:09] special time
[1:04:10] Christmas Means synonymously a number of
[1:04:13] things it means a time for family it
[1:04:15] means at times connecting it means a
[1:04:18] time for for him a time for for turkey a
[1:04:22] time for for different people it means
[1:04:24] it means different things the time to
[1:04:26] share gifts the time to connect with
[1:04:28] friends or a time to break diets it's a
[1:04:31] Time
[1:04:34] it's a time of a lot of different things
[1:04:36] and you always say we have to always
[1:04:39] remember the real reason for the season
[1:04:42] and as brother Branham would speak about
[1:04:44] this he would speak to the church he
[1:04:46] said I can't tell you how to raise your
[1:04:48] children you know but Christmas is not
[1:04:50] about Santa Claus he said if you lie to
[1:04:53] them about Santa Claus one needle wonder
[1:04:55] what else you lied about so tell them
[1:04:56] the truth the real truth about Christmas
[1:04:58] that and it's not about the gifts and
[1:05:00] it's not about the Santa Claus but there
[1:05:02] was a gift because God so loved the
[1:05:04] world and he gave his only begotten son
[1:05:07] and and that I call the first great gift
[1:05:10] and by the manaman preaching would say
[1:05:12] but there's another gift it's the gift
[1:05:14] of the Holy Ghost that's that's the real
[1:05:16] gift that he wanted to give his people
[1:05:18] and he would always say the best
[1:05:21] Christmas gift you could ever get is
[1:05:23] that eternal life the gift of the Holy
[1:05:26] Ghost and he would preach to the people
[1:05:28] that
[1:05:30] when you have a Christmas message that
[1:05:33] my desire for you is if I could give it
[1:05:35] to you myself I would but he is The
[1:05:37] Giver of the gift I'm he is still given
[1:05:40] the gift of the baptism of the Holy
[1:05:42] Ghost and Fire and his promise is just
[1:05:46] as real as it was when he was here on
[1:05:49] Earth can the Church Say Amen
[1:05:51] oh Hallelujah
[1:05:54] oh so we're going to talk about Jesus
[1:05:57] this morning is that's okay is that okay
[1:06:00] with you for a few minutes let's talk
[1:06:02] about Jesus because we have seen his
[1:06:05] star and because we have seen his star
[1:06:08] we have come to worship the star woke us
[1:06:12] up this morning the star caught our
[1:06:14] attention and brother Branham said
[1:06:18] that that stock expressed a message
[1:06:20] because the star itself was a sign the
[1:06:24] star was not the end game the star was
[1:06:27] pointing to something that was happening
[1:06:29] the star was a prophetic message the
[1:06:32] star had a Voice the star raised
[1:06:35] questions can the church say Amen I'm
[1:06:38] already leaving my notes this morning
[1:06:40] but that's all right
[1:06:43] for 400 years there was no spiritual
[1:06:47] move that's what the prophet said
[1:06:48] prophecy had hung over the children of
[1:06:51] Israel hung over the Jews the last
[1:06:54] prophet Malachi had already left the
[1:06:57] scene and he he uttered behold I will
[1:06:59] send you Elijah before the great and
[1:07:02] Dreadful Team all those prophecies were
[1:07:04] hovering after 400 years there was
[1:07:07] silence but when the pranam taught us
[1:07:09] and scripture tells us God could do
[1:07:12] nothing in the spiritual unless there's
[1:07:14] a sign
[1:07:16] so before there's a spiritual happening
[1:07:18] there has got to be a sign and God had
[1:07:22] to place the sign with enough notice
[1:07:24] because there were some Gentiles who had
[1:07:27] to see the sign and they had to ask
[1:07:30] questions but the Branham said
[1:07:33] he is a wise men
[1:07:35] these were studied men these were
[1:07:38] spiritual men he said I could imagine
[1:07:40] and brother Brian I would paint a
[1:07:42] picture that every day every time they
[1:07:45] would get up into their Tower and they
[1:07:47] would look out to the stars but the
[1:07:49] problem said these men knew what every
[1:07:51] Star meant they know what every Star was
[1:07:53] connected to they know every movement
[1:07:56] meant they understood what everything
[1:07:58] was about them but all of a sudden one
[1:08:01] day they saw something they never saw
[1:08:03] before they saw something they could not
[1:08:06] explain and but the problem said maybe
[1:08:08] they went to their master
[1:08:10] yeah
[1:08:11] he said when you go back to the Book of
[1:08:13] Daniel when Daniel was here he was their
[1:08:15] Master over in Babylonian
[1:08:18] because all the sages and the wise men
[1:08:20] would come and discuss the stars and
[1:08:23] discuss the weather and discuss science
[1:08:25] and discuss and they said there's
[1:08:27] nothing we have to explain this sign
[1:08:30] the sign is a different kind of sign we
[1:08:33] have seen Stars we have seen
[1:08:35] constellations we have seen things
[1:08:37] before but this one is different
[1:08:41] [Applause]
[1:08:42] and it got them so curious it got them
[1:08:46] so excited but the problem said they may
[1:08:48] have looked through their own scriptures
[1:08:50] and found nothing
[1:08:51] remember the problem said maybe they
[1:08:54] went back to the Book of Daniel
[1:08:56] found when Daniel wrote about a stone
[1:08:58] cut out without the hands of man
[1:09:01] added to connect the pieces
[1:09:05] theologians describe these men as the
[1:09:08] king makers
[1:09:10] because for centuries it was the magized
[1:09:13] and the sages and the wise men that
[1:09:16] would convert together to anoint Kings
[1:09:20] thousands of years ago so when a father
[1:09:23] was dying and leaving his throne to his
[1:09:26] son or one of his sons the wise men
[1:09:29] would be summoned
[1:09:31] to look at the stars and look at the
[1:09:34] signs and let the king know that's the
[1:09:36] right son and when the king passed on
[1:09:39] they will come an anoint who was going
[1:09:41] to replace the king
[1:09:44] so God had some Gentiles who were the
[1:09:48] problem said they were also Believers
[1:09:49] because they believed in one God
[1:09:52] the hearts were pricked to say we have
[1:09:54] seen something and we have to
[1:09:56] investigate
[1:09:57] but they brought him said it took about
[1:09:59] two years
[1:10:00] two years of coldness two years of
[1:10:03] rugged Road and two years of camels and
[1:10:07] they didn't give up brother Branham said
[1:10:09] that's how the character of the
[1:10:10] Christian is more little through the
[1:10:12] hardship it wasn't a one-week Journey it
[1:10:15] wasn't a drive to church on Sunday
[1:10:17] morning it was two years
[1:10:20] two years of pushing two years of
[1:10:22] pressing two years of fighting I mean
[1:10:25] the problem said on the way to battle
[1:10:27] him they have to pass through Jerusalem
[1:10:30] the city that was the spiritual City
[1:10:33] holy Jerusalem and when they got there
[1:10:37] but the Terence they came in a Revival
[1:10:39] because they knew they were near to what
[1:10:41] they were looking for they came at sight
[1:10:46] where is he where is the king must is
[1:10:50] the Messiah on the earth now where are
[1:10:53] all the Miracles where's the king of
[1:10:55] kings
[1:10:58] oh and they made so much noise that the
[1:11:02] officers of the day brought these men in
[1:11:05] front of Herod and the Bible said Herod
[1:11:07] was troubled and all of Jerusalem
[1:11:10] not part of Jerusalem all of Jerusalem
[1:11:13] was troubled and then Herald called a
[1:11:16] Minister's meeting he said Brothers
[1:11:18] ministers scribes tell me what it says
[1:11:21] about the Christ and the Bible says they
[1:11:24] found where it was written so it was not
[1:11:26] that they didn't have it it was not that
[1:11:28] they didn't know it but they had
[1:11:30] forgotten about it because they were
[1:11:32] caught up in the rituals they were
[1:11:34] caught up in the traditions of but here
[1:11:36] come three men who were not from their
[1:11:39] City not from their Town not from their
[1:11:42] church not from their establishment but
[1:11:45] they came with the desire because God
[1:11:47] let them see the Stein
[1:11:51] oh Hallelujah
[1:11:54] Hallelujah
[1:11:56] and Herod
[1:11:57] and it's so beautiful because you see
[1:11:59] the clear this difference between what a
[1:12:02] man says with his mouth and what he says
[1:12:04] with his heart he said when you find him
[1:12:07] bring back word to me
[1:12:09] because I'm also a worshiper because I
[1:12:11] want to worship him too and these wise
[1:12:14] men left
[1:12:15] feeling that that was the right thing to
[1:12:17] do but you read the scripture God had to
[1:12:19] give them a dream
[1:12:21] to let them know pass the other way
[1:12:23] don't pass through the bypass don't pass
[1:12:26] back to Jerusalem take the other Road
[1:12:28] and head back home with your rejoicing
[1:12:30] because Kara's motive is not right can
[1:12:33] the Church Say Amen
[1:12:36] and we're gonna get to it later in the
[1:12:38] message
[1:12:39] but our worship is based on a sign
[1:12:43] the star was a sign it was pointing to
[1:12:46] the Messiah
[1:12:47] a prophet is a sign because the prophet
[1:12:50] is not to identify himself and brother
[1:12:52] Branham taught us that in the right hand
[1:12:55] of God he plays Seven Stars and these
[1:12:59] stars were to attract the people in
[1:13:01] their age and in their time to see that
[1:13:03] there was Messiah to reveal word on the
[1:13:07] earth at that time so Paul he was a star
[1:13:10] and those who saw the star had to follow
[1:13:13] the voice of the sign to see what the
[1:13:15] message was Paul did not Point people to
[1:13:18] himself but he was pointed to Jesus and
[1:13:22] he said if an angel comes out from
[1:13:24] heaven and preached any other gospel let
[1:13:27] him be your cursor but I'm pointing you
[1:13:29] to Jesus I'm pointing you to the Messiah
[1:13:32] I'm pointing you to the king of kings
[1:13:34] and and Paul was a star in the right
[1:13:37] hand of God
[1:13:38] [Applause]
[1:13:40] anybody in the house this morning
[1:13:42] anybody in the house just spawning we're
[1:13:45] gonna get to the real meaning of
[1:13:47] Christmas we get to the real meaning of
[1:13:49] what this is all about but we have seen
[1:13:52] his star that is what has us excited we
[1:13:56] have seen his top called himself place a
[1:13:59] star to catch our attention because some
[1:14:02] of us it's been two years we've been on
[1:14:05] the journey The Summer's been 40 years
[1:14:07] up on the journey but we will see the
[1:14:10] Lord's Christ up we will see Messiah we
[1:14:13] will see the King of Kings up we will
[1:14:16] see that great Governor we will see it
[1:14:20] we shall see the king or we are walking
[1:14:23] in the lightest morning
[1:14:26] oh you may be seated
[1:14:29] oh
[1:14:30] [Applause]
[1:14:32] Hallelujah
[1:14:34] so I'm bringing some types this morning
[1:14:36] those wise men they saw a natural star
[1:14:38] but we didn't see that star we were not
[1:14:42] there when they saw what they saw but we
[1:14:44] have also seen a star because the
[1:14:47] messengers of the seven Church ages but
[1:14:49] the problem said they are stars in the
[1:14:52] right hand of God and in our day we have
[1:14:55] had a star in our time we have had a
[1:14:58] star in our generation we have had a
[1:15:00] stop and that star has been pointing at
[1:15:04] the Messiah that star has been pointing
[1:15:07] to the revealed word
[1:15:09] we have seen his star oh Hallelujah and
[1:15:15] we are walking in that light we are
[1:15:17] walking in the light of that star this
[1:15:19] morning we are walking in the light of
[1:15:21] that message
[1:15:23] he may be seated I want to make sure
[1:15:25] this gets home this morning when that
[1:15:27] star appeared to the wise men that star
[1:15:30] was saying something that's Tower seeing
[1:15:32] a king is coming a king is coming a king
[1:15:36] is coming A King is Coming Messiah is
[1:15:39] coming the King of Kings is coming
[1:15:41] Redemption is coming Deliverance has
[1:15:43] come him the kingdom is coming Power is
[1:15:46] coming listen whatever the Magi is had
[1:15:49] whatever they had over there they
[1:15:51] realized that that sign spoke of
[1:15:53] something more more than they had before
[1:15:56] many knew before more than they
[1:15:58] experience before because if what they
[1:16:01] had was enough they didn't need to
[1:16:03] follow the stop but when they saw that
[1:16:05] sign they recognize there's more there's
[1:16:08] more to waking up in the morning I'm
[1:16:10] going to work there's more that waking
[1:16:13] up and baking a ham there's more than
[1:16:16] picking a turkey Messiah is on the earth
[1:16:19] the whole creation the whole of nature
[1:16:23] is groaning for deliverance
[1:16:27] oh Hallelujah somebody help me preach
[1:16:30] this morning you may be seated
[1:16:33] it's wise men whatever anointed Kings
[1:16:36] before these wise men would have
[1:16:38] anointed leaders before but what stirred
[1:16:41] them is there was never a king like this
[1:16:43] King there was never
[1:16:46] us never a king like
[1:16:52] like somebody preached back to me
[1:16:54] anybody in the house this morning
[1:16:59] Hallelujah
[1:17:00] oh
[1:17:03] Hallelujah
[1:17:05] oh Hallelujah
[1:17:07] Hallelujah keep on your spiritual hacks
[1:17:10] this morning
[1:17:10] [Applause]
[1:17:12] and when they came
[1:17:14] and they saw the young child
[1:17:16] they testified not just with words but
[1:17:19] they they brought a gift
[1:17:21] to identify that they had a revelation
[1:17:24] of what the star was pointing to they
[1:17:27] brought gold to identify his kingship
[1:17:31] they fought frankincense to identify his
[1:17:34] priesthood and they brought myrrh to
[1:17:37] identify that he was the sacrifice and
[1:17:39] these men who were not from Jerusalem
[1:17:41] they were not from the tribe of Levites
[1:17:44] they were not from the tribe of Israel
[1:17:46] but God ministered to them and find them
[1:17:49] where they were and give them a deeper
[1:17:52] Revelation that Messiah was on the earth
[1:17:54] up Herod didn't know it the priest
[1:17:57] didn't know it the ministers didn't know
[1:17:59] it the whole of Jerusalem the Bible says
[1:18:02] they were all troubled
[1:18:04] [Music]
[1:18:06] but not these men what was their
[1:18:09] testimony they didn't even see a miracle
[1:18:12] [Music]
[1:18:14] they just saw the star
[1:18:17] didn't see a sign
[1:18:19] of they just saw the Stars
[1:18:20] star and that star gave them enough
[1:18:22] Faith to believe the impossible to
[1:18:25] believe that Messiah could be on the
[1:18:27] earth now can the church
[1:18:29] Say Amen
[1:18:32] oh we're talking about Jesus this
[1:18:35] morning I'm not going to be too long
[1:18:37] with you but ride with me for a few
[1:18:39] minutes this morning with a Branham in
[1:18:41] the message Christ is the mystery of God
[1:18:43] revealed said he is talking about Jesus
[1:18:45] is the principal theme of The Bible he
[1:18:49] was in the prophets he was in the Psalms
[1:18:51] he was in the history of the Bible the
[1:18:54] Bible is a prophetic book it's a
[1:18:56] historical book it's a book of love it's
[1:18:58] a book of songs it's a book of life and
[1:19:01] in there you find Christ he was in the
[1:19:04] prophets he was in the Psalms of he was
[1:19:07] in the history and he also in the Bible
[1:19:09] is the things that is to come so he was
[1:19:12] before until after what does that make
[1:19:15] him then the same yesterday today and
[1:19:18] forever and to us this morning he is
[1:19:21] still the same yesterday the same today
[1:19:23] and the same forever can the Church Say
[1:19:26] Amen
[1:19:29] oh Hallelujah
[1:19:31] that's when I paint a picture of the
[1:19:34] different things that are happening
[1:19:36] around this this birth of Jesus Christ
[1:19:46] for all of the Old Testament but the
[1:19:49] Branham said it spoke of Jesus
[1:19:51] he said if you read the Bible and you
[1:19:54] read a verse and don't see Jesus in
[1:19:55] every verse go read it again because he
[1:19:59] is a principal theme of The Bible every
[1:20:03] Prophet every messenger every Apostle
[1:20:06] every teacher and every believer what
[1:20:09] unites us is not church or doctrine it's
[1:20:11] Jesus
[1:20:13] that is what brings us together it's
[1:20:15] because of Jesus whenever we lose sight
[1:20:18] of the Messiah we'll lose sight of the
[1:20:20] whole picture
[1:20:25] so the picture is painted and God is
[1:20:27] about to unveil his masterpiece
[1:20:31] we have preached it before there was so
[1:20:34] much locked up in God he could release
[1:20:36] it all at once
[1:20:37] through the Old Testament
[1:20:39] so the attribute and God of being a
[1:20:42] shepherd He used David
[1:20:45] to display the shepherd attribute of God
[1:20:49] in God was locked up Prophet so he used
[1:20:52] Elijah and the prophets to display that
[1:20:54] attribute and God was locked up the
[1:20:57] warrior he will fight your battle so
[1:20:59] when God was was he used Joshua to
[1:21:01] display that attribute
[1:21:03] and God was the attribute he may Deliver
[1:21:05] us so he used Moses
[1:21:08] for a small part of his story
[1:21:12] to show he could he could open the
[1:21:14] barren wounds he took Sarah who was
[1:21:16] dried up and opened her wombs to show
[1:21:19] that he could change any situation
[1:21:21] [Applause]
[1:21:24] that he was the resurrection he is the
[1:21:27] resurrection he is the life
[1:21:28] [Applause]
[1:21:31] throughout scripture even before Jesus
[1:21:34] got there we see Elijah yeah praying for
[1:21:38] the boy who was dead and that boy came
[1:21:40] to life we saw lepers healed we saw
[1:21:43] Miracles the ax float we saw men who
[1:21:47] didn't even have the Holy Ghost
[1:21:49] but because they were expressions of his
[1:21:52] attributes they could not help but
[1:21:54] display what was locked up in God
[1:21:57] they made mistakes they failed but they
[1:22:00] could not help be an extension of the
[1:22:02] attribute of God because God was
[1:22:04] fighting to get what was locked up in
[1:22:07] him expressed it it could not have
[1:22:10] helped him God doesn't need healing for
[1:22:12] himself he doesn't need to be delivered
[1:22:15] he doesn't need a miracle it is for
[1:22:17] people who need a healing and need a
[1:22:20] miracle it makes no sense for God to
[1:22:23] have it locked up and nobody could
[1:22:26] access it or you don't hear me this
[1:22:28] morning
[1:22:28] [Applause]
[1:22:28] [Music]
[1:22:30] the ability of God to open the blinded
[1:22:33] eyes is not for his benefit because he
[1:22:36] is not blind you don't hear me this
[1:22:38] morning there the ability of God to make
[1:22:41] the cripples Walkers is not for his
[1:22:44] benefit because he is not crippled his
[1:22:47] his hand is not too short that he could
[1:22:49] oh you don't hear me this morning
[1:22:54] can we preach a little bit so it's been
[1:22:57] God's business to get his attributes to
[1:23:00] be expressed but when the Branham taught
[1:23:03] us that God needs a vessel he needs
[1:23:06] somebody to walk through he doesn't want
[1:23:09] to walk through the the nature he wants
[1:23:11] to use somebody
[1:23:12] [Music]
[1:23:13] so in every age Gideon the Mighty Man of
[1:23:16] Valor
[1:23:17] to show that his strength is made
[1:23:20] perfect in your weakness when when
[1:23:22] Gideon lacked confidence and Gideon
[1:23:24] lacked self-esteemer Gideon
[1:23:27] that his strength could be made perfect
[1:23:30] in weakness
[1:23:32] or you don't hear me this morning
[1:23:34] anybody in the house
[1:23:36] oh and when your back is against the
[1:23:39] wall a man like shamga who by the brand
[1:23:42] undescribers of farmer with his little
[1:23:45] outfit when your back is against the
[1:23:47] wall in God had the attribute to say
[1:23:51] enough is enough I'm not taking this no
[1:23:54] more I'm not taking pressure from the
[1:23:57] devil no more I'm not taking the attack
[1:23:59] of the Enemy No More I've worked too
[1:24:02] hard I've struggled too long I've given
[1:24:05] too much I've invested my all
[1:24:10] you don't hear me this morning
[1:24:13] and when shamgar saw the Philistines
[1:24:16] coming look around and he took the ox
[1:24:19] code it was not shamga it was not the ox
[1:24:22] code but God said that the attribute of
[1:24:25] when your back is against the wall and
[1:24:28] you need to know it could be done look
[1:24:30] at changa draw strength from him because
[1:24:32] through shanga I saw the attribute
[1:24:35] that's in me to fight when your back is
[1:24:38] against the wall that's right
[1:24:41] Hallelujah
[1:24:44] Hallelujah
[1:24:46] anybody in the house this morning
[1:24:48] so God is unveiling himself he's
[1:24:52] unveiling in himself he is slowly If my
[1:24:55] people will humble themselves and pray
[1:24:57] he is using prophets he's using little
[1:24:59] boys he's using Kings he's using he's
[1:25:01] using one man he's using Hannah and the
[1:25:04] temple who is crying out and they're all
[1:25:06] expressing Jesus they're all speaking
[1:25:09] about Jesus they are not living for
[1:25:11] themselves they are not acting for
[1:25:12] themselves in their own little way
[1:25:16] [Applause]
[1:25:20] yeah speaking about Jesus
[1:25:23] and then the time came
[1:25:25] then the season changed then the hour
[1:25:28] came and God had to find a way to slip
[1:25:31] the king onto the Earth
[1:25:34] without fanfare
[1:25:36] [Applause]
[1:25:37] without attention
[1:25:39] because it's an infiltration because
[1:25:42] brother Branham preached that the devil
[1:25:44] is a God of this evil age so he is kind
[1:25:47] of running things on the earth so God
[1:25:48] wants to bring a nuclear weapon
[1:25:51] and slip it through eternity into time
[1:25:55] to deal with this aberrant issue of
[1:25:59] Lucifer and his fallen angels
[1:26:07] but the law of God requires two
[1:26:10] witnesses
[1:26:12] for everything to be established
[1:26:17] so he's setting things up
[1:26:20] and he starts off and he starts off with
[1:26:23] a priest who is a kind of half-time
[1:26:25] priest he's not a full-time priest name
[1:26:27] is Zachariah and it's his requirement I
[1:26:30] think it's a fortnight in the year once
[1:26:32] in the year he has to go and and offer
[1:26:35] incense while the Believers are praying
[1:26:38] he is offering incense to God
[1:26:41] and he's praying for the people but he
[1:26:44] also has a need because his wife
[1:26:46] Elizabeth has not had a child and it's
[1:26:48] been in their marriage in their
[1:26:50] relationship in this situation so he has
[1:26:52] a burden in his spirit in his soul and
[1:26:55] while he's here doing his duties he has
[1:26:57] a visitor
[1:26:58] [Applause]
[1:27:00] from the presence of almighty God
[1:27:02] sent a secret agent
[1:27:05] he says have to be in position because
[1:27:08] the Messiah is coming somebody have to
[1:27:11] roll out the red carpet in secret
[1:27:14] because the devil can't know it's
[1:27:16] happening so God sends Gabriel Gabriel
[1:27:20] handle it okay all right
[1:27:24] and Gabriel comes to Zachariah says
[1:27:26] Zechariah
[1:27:27] your prayers have been answered you've
[1:27:30] been praying for a long time I just want
[1:27:32] you to know God has heard your prayers
[1:27:34] and I've come to let you know what a
[1:27:37] message to know you've been praying and
[1:27:39] sighing and crying and pouring out at
[1:27:42] the old top Zechariah pouring incense
[1:27:45] and he said Lord my wife Lord my house
[1:27:47] Lord our people
[1:27:50] your prayers answered
[1:27:53] your wife's gonna have a chat
[1:27:56] and Gabriel he disappears but he's on a
[1:27:58] mission
[1:28:00] because a few months later he has
[1:28:01] another visitation to do
[1:28:04] a little lady named Mary
[1:28:06] a spouse a man called Joseph I know you
[1:28:09] know the story but it's good to talk
[1:28:11] about Jesus but the parents said when we
[1:28:13] talk about him he comes near he loves
[1:28:15] when we talk about him we could talk
[1:28:17] about the church we could talk about
[1:28:18] them but when you talk about Jesus oh he
[1:28:20] loves to come there when you talk about
[1:28:22] him he loves to be the center of our
[1:28:25] attention he loves to be the center of
[1:28:28] our joy he loves to be the reason of the
[1:28:30] Season not just in December but in
[1:28:33] January in February in March on Sunday
[1:28:36] on Monday on Tuesday every day
[1:28:39] when Jesus is sweeter than the day
[1:28:42] before
[1:28:43] can I just talk to you a little bit I'm
[1:28:46] going to leave the note we're just gonna
[1:28:47] just talk about Jesus a little bit so
[1:28:49] Here Comes Mary everybody knows the
[1:28:52] prophecy
[1:28:54] a virgin shall conceive and people don't
[1:28:57] understand the time you know it's God
[1:28:59] talking because brother Abraham said
[1:29:00] it's unusual
[1:29:02] it's unusual when God talks it's unusual
[1:29:04] the match don't add up
[1:29:07] and it's not supposed to add up because
[1:29:09] if my thoughts are not your thoughts
[1:29:11] neither are I my ways like your way so
[1:29:13] when I'm planning stuff it's all to
[1:29:15] confuse the enemy don't try to figure it
[1:29:18] out so a virgin shall conceive
[1:29:21] foreign
[1:29:22] Comes Mary
[1:29:24] doing what she's normally doing and
[1:29:26] that's usually how it is you're going
[1:29:28] about your normal routine you live in
[1:29:30] your normal life and then something
[1:29:32] interrupts your normal schedule to get
[1:29:35] your attention
[1:29:39] and here comes this Archangel Gabriel
[1:29:42] Hail Mary
[1:29:42] toward highly favored
[1:29:46] among all women and Mary not buying the
[1:29:50] story yet
[1:29:51] so what are you talking about people say
[1:29:54] you're going to have a child and his his
[1:29:55] name Shall be Called wonderful his his
[1:29:57] name Shall be Called counselor his name
[1:29:59] shall be corporate and Gabriel is
[1:30:01] describing this thing
[1:30:03] is excited because for for centuries and
[1:30:06] for thousands years breaking me till the
[1:30:08] time this has been what they've been
[1:30:09] waiting for
[1:30:10] [Applause]
[1:30:12] and then Mary asks one question how
[1:30:14] shall this thing be
[1:30:16] and Gabriel said the Holy Ghost
[1:30:20] the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow
[1:30:22] you and in the message we have seen his
[1:30:25] time and come to worship for the Bible
[1:30:27] said the Holy Ghost is the father
[1:30:29] so the child is the father's child
[1:30:35] so Mary is exposed to Joseph
[1:30:38] but she's excited because she has this
[1:30:40] message I'm gonna have a baby
[1:30:42] and but Ibraham dramatizes that she runs
[1:30:44] to Elizabeth
[1:30:47] it wasn't a walk and by the Branham
[1:30:49] described he said maybe they hug one
[1:30:50] another how are you doing holy baby
[1:30:53] coming along and Elizabeth says I'm not
[1:30:55] too sure you know this is about the
[1:30:56] Branham he says the baby hasn't moved
[1:30:58] it's been six months and you know
[1:31:00] normally by three to four months the
[1:31:02] baby should at least move something
[1:31:08] tell you
[1:31:10] I'm having a baby too
[1:31:12] so brother Branham said Elizabeth asked
[1:31:15] why I didn't invite me to the wedding
[1:31:17] I know you was engaged to Joseph but I
[1:31:21] didn't get Hulk I'm your cousin oh why
[1:31:23] didn't invite me
[1:31:26] and Mary said well I get to marry him
[1:31:29] yet
[1:31:32] and brother Branham described you say
[1:31:34] and Elizabeth is like what you telling
[1:31:35] me
[1:31:38] what you talking about you you Sister
[1:31:41] Mary you you know you living right you
[1:31:43] what you're talking about
[1:31:45] [Applause]
[1:31:48] and by the Branham said Mary said to
[1:31:50] describe her experience with the angel
[1:31:56] is describing it and the angel
[1:31:59] told me that and the angel told me and
[1:32:01] then she got to the path and the angel
[1:32:04] told me his name
[1:32:06] will be called and she started to go
[1:32:08] down into the names and but the problem
[1:32:10] said when the name of Jesus was spoken
[1:32:13] son in his mother's womb who hadn't
[1:32:16] moved before with the Palms at the Holy
[1:32:18] Ghost filled John in his mother's womb
[1:32:22] he was filled with the Holy Ghost he was
[1:32:25] born from his mother's womb with the
[1:32:27] baptism after holy ghost at the name of
[1:32:30] Jesus
[1:32:32] still power in the name of Jesus
[1:32:41] Hallelujah
[1:32:42] we know the story I'm not going to be
[1:32:45] too long but we love talking about Jesus
[1:32:47] so everything is getting into place
[1:32:49] because John has to forerun the coming
[1:32:53] of Christ
[1:32:54] somebody has to roll out the red carpet
[1:32:57] for the king to walk on it come on now
[1:32:59] so John has a mission to foreign the
[1:33:03] coming of the Messiah
[1:33:05] [Applause]
[1:33:08] meanwhile
[1:33:10] why this is going on
[1:33:11] the wise men are walking
[1:33:15] all of this happening the wise men on
[1:33:17] their Journey before the first
[1:33:19] presentation the wise men already left
[1:33:21] because brother Brown said takes about
[1:33:23] two years for them fellas to get there
[1:33:26] so Mary Noggin word the wise men already
[1:33:28] know
[1:33:29] because they have seen this sign they
[1:33:32] have seen this star in the east and
[1:33:34] they're coming on the expectation
[1:33:37] for a perfect timing can the Church Say
[1:33:39] Amen oh can we give the Lord a handle of
[1:33:42] praise
[1:33:48] whatever
[1:33:50] amen
[1:33:56] Glory Hallelujah
[1:33:59] Hallelujah
[1:34:03] Oh Glory
[1:34:05] but the Branham is so wonderful in this
[1:34:07] message you see how Mary would have told
[1:34:09] you about you look so pretty but the
[1:34:10] random describes the whole thing
[1:34:14] and when the Madam goes on to speak
[1:34:16] about how God moves things around for
[1:34:19] his purpose
[1:34:20] and he brings out in the same message
[1:34:22] and when you've got time you can read it
[1:34:25] how God uses visions
[1:34:28] and uses dreams and he speaks of how a
[1:34:30] prophet is able to combine his
[1:34:34] subconscious and his conscience together
[1:34:35] so with his eyes open he could see a
[1:34:38] vision but unless you're a prophet God
[1:34:41] has to wait until normal man goes to
[1:34:44] sleep and his Consciousness is asleep
[1:34:47] for his subconscious to be active for
[1:34:50] God to present himself in a dream
[1:34:53] so Joseph brother Branham said is an
[1:34:55] honorable man he's wondering how to
[1:34:58] handle the situation how to deal with
[1:35:00] the situation with this Mary and he
[1:35:02] can't believe you you can imagine little
[1:35:04] turmoil how a heiling the situation and
[1:35:07] then God
[1:35:09] visits Joseph in a dream and say Joseph
[1:35:12] don't be afraid to take your wife
[1:35:15] because what is in her is of the Holy
[1:35:18] Ghost
[1:35:19] and God used a dream with her God is a
[1:35:22] dream with a wise man and God is fixing
[1:35:25] things around because this has to happen
[1:35:27] in perfect order
[1:35:30] Jesus is about to be born and herrogate
[1:35:33] inspired the government can inspired to
[1:35:35] raise taxes
[1:35:39] because the law have to change to drive
[1:35:42] Mary to have the baby where the baby is
[1:35:45] supposed to be born
[1:35:46] [Applause]
[1:35:47] and brother Branham says it was not easy
[1:35:49] for Mary
[1:35:51] dramatized the conversation he said Mary
[1:35:53] would be saying to Joseph Joseph don't
[1:35:54] worry we're going to make it we're not
[1:35:56] going to be only ones on the road it's
[1:35:58] other people have to go to if we get in
[1:36:01] trouble we'll get help when he wrote
[1:36:02] somebody will help me I'm pregnant
[1:36:05] and but the random describes the donkey
[1:36:07] that they would have gone on what what a
[1:36:08] donkey that was to carry the king
[1:36:12] I want you to go back there go back to
[1:36:13] time with me to see this whole thing
[1:36:15] unfolding
[1:36:16] and they see the journey with Mary going
[1:36:18] through the Dayton
[1:36:20] and brother said imagine Mary will ask
[1:36:22] Joseph do you want to take a ride on the
[1:36:24] donkey now
[1:36:25] because I've been on a dog the whole
[1:36:26] time and Joseph saying no no no you stay
[1:36:27] there because you're carrying the baby
[1:36:30] and but the problem is revealing this
[1:36:31] whole thing as it unfolds and falls and
[1:36:34] falls over time
[1:36:36] says when God allowed the taxes to be
[1:36:39] raised God will do whatever he needs to
[1:36:42] do and what will allow what the devil
[1:36:44] does to get him praise also so every
[1:36:47] action or reaction to you is for his
[1:36:50] purpose and for his honor and for his
[1:36:52] glory can the Church Say Amen
[1:36:56] oh Hallelujah
[1:36:58] Hallelujah but the Madam said while he
[1:37:01] was thinking on these things he was a
[1:37:03] good man he didn't want his own name mad
[1:37:04] brother said Joseph was thinking about
[1:37:06] being a shield for her and brother goes
[1:37:09] on and on and he's bringing out this
[1:37:11] whole beautiful Christmas Story
[1:37:13] can the Church Say Amen
[1:37:17] Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory and he
[1:37:21] said that when God revealed himself to
[1:37:23] Joseph he said when a man can reveal
[1:37:24] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:37:26] today and forever no matter how many
[1:37:28] Creed try to turn it back you're glad to
[1:37:30] be a shield so he said Joseph became a
[1:37:33] shield for Mary you're happy to be a
[1:37:34] shield let them say whatever you got a
[1:37:37] big Shield up there to knock the fiery
[1:37:38] dots off he said I hope I don't get too
[1:37:41] loud for them out there let them hear it
[1:37:43] too they ought to notice it you're happy
[1:37:45] to be a shield you're a doormat whatever
[1:37:47] wants to be it doesn't matter it's been
[1:37:49] revealed to you by the Lord and the Lord
[1:37:52] has shown it to you by his word is the
[1:37:53] truth and then confirm it to you to make
[1:37:55] it live again dear it is mine nothing to
[1:37:58] go on can the church say Amen Oh Glory
[1:38:01] Glory Glory can the Church Say Amen
[1:38:05] right
[1:38:06] Glory
[1:38:08] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:38:10] oh Hallelujah
[1:38:12] brother Adam said when Christ was being
[1:38:14] formed in Mary quickly come the king's
[1:38:16] commandment all you people just as she
[1:38:18] was the Christ was becoming a baby ready
[1:38:20] to be delivered right then the great
[1:38:22] persecution
[1:38:23] but this is coming in the last days when
[1:38:26] the completeness when the fullness of
[1:38:28] the godhead when the fullness of Christ
[1:38:30] is to be manifested among his people he
[1:38:33] promised it in his word and when that
[1:38:34] fullness you see there is unusual things
[1:38:37] begin to happen that he promised that's
[1:38:38] the reason or a great social lives and
[1:38:41] things can't understand it it's
[1:38:43] foolishness to them now watch they're
[1:38:45] forming a council of churches just the
[1:38:47] time when the church is beginning to get
[1:38:50] to its feet where the Supernatural is
[1:38:52] going to begin to work now they all went
[1:38:54] into that group and they're going to try
[1:38:56] to stop this stuff so but Ibrahim is
[1:38:58] saying as Mary is about to have the baby
[1:39:00] all the persecution begins to rise up
[1:39:02] but Abraham said it this way see when
[1:39:04] you're praying and you're about to
[1:39:06] breakthrough that's the hardest purchase
[1:39:08] before you break through
[1:39:10] just before your blessing that's when
[1:39:13] the persecution begins oh hallelujah
[1:39:16] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he
[1:39:20] stood there and brother is dramatizing
[1:39:22] he said Mary was in pain and after a
[1:39:24] while he comes at the top of the hill
[1:39:26] and once again they look over into the
[1:39:27] city where they were born over in
[1:39:29] Bethlehem the lights of the city many
[1:39:31] was their places was crowded people on
[1:39:34] the outside sleeping on the ground out
[1:39:36] along in the fields and the question
[1:39:38] perhaps the first time it struck Joseph
[1:39:40] what will I do if I can't find a place
[1:39:44] because this baby might be born tonight
[1:39:46] she's been in pain all day so what if
[1:39:49] the baby is going to be born tonight and
[1:39:51] brother Venom is dramatizing and he said
[1:39:52] they're looking down across the valley
[1:39:54] wandering his eyes happened to look over
[1:39:56] sideways and he saw a strange sight
[1:39:59] you know it's usually right in time or
[1:40:01] trouble when Supernatural things happen
[1:40:03] and he looked over there and he saw a
[1:40:05] star he had never remembered
[1:40:08] see so big it looked so low like it was
[1:40:11] hanging right over Bethlehem and he
[1:40:13] looked up and he turned after he helped
[1:40:15] Mary up on a rock to rest a little while
[1:40:17] he turned around to say dear did you
[1:40:19] ever notice and he could even see his
[1:40:21] reflection listen to the prophet he
[1:40:23] could see the star's reflection in her
[1:40:25] pretty black eyes
[1:40:28] it's as if the problem is standing right
[1:40:30] they're watching this whole thing unfold
[1:40:32] and look smiling there isn't that
[1:40:33] strange she said Joseph honey I have
[1:40:35] watched that since the sun went down
[1:40:37] I've been watching that star somehow
[1:40:39] another I feel real strange tonight that
[1:40:42] something is fixing to happen
[1:40:45] it's usually that way you know you have
[1:40:47] that that tree and spirit
[1:40:48] S as you begin to
[1:40:52] rest breathing and they watch USA it had
[1:40:54] an odd action to it it didn't act like
[1:40:57] the rest of stars it it seemed to be
[1:40:58] restless moving it was waiting for
[1:41:00] something watching for something to
[1:41:02] happen
[1:41:03] Oh Glory Glory Glory Glory now let's
[1:41:07] leave our little couple right here on
[1:41:09] the rock for a minute
[1:41:11] leaves them on the rock
[1:41:13] and travels on the way back over to
[1:41:15] India to speak about the wise men and
[1:41:18] how God declares his doings in the
[1:41:21] heavens before he does it on Earth and
[1:41:23] he speaks of these wise men came from
[1:41:25] the line of wise men and Daniel was the
[1:41:27] prophet he was their master
[1:41:30] and God is no respecter of person so he
[1:41:33] could use anybody and these men believe
[1:41:35] that there was one God and they would
[1:41:37] study the night and study the stars and
[1:41:39] they would burn fire at night and they
[1:41:41] watch and they worship and every night
[1:41:43] they would climb up there as soon as the
[1:41:45] sun went down and study these things
[1:41:46] just like we get together at conferences
[1:41:49] and study the Bible and word by word
[1:41:51] they node every move of them Stars
[1:41:54] and one night while they were up there
[1:41:56] studying and no wonder it was most
[1:41:58] alarming when a visitor appeared among
[1:42:00] them a stranger they had never seen that
[1:42:02] star before he didn't know what was this
[1:42:04] was they had no wonder they were alarmed
[1:42:06] they didn't know what to do about it it
[1:42:08] was a phenomena so it caught their
[1:42:10] attention
[1:42:11] has done something caught your attention
[1:42:13] to bring you to this great gospel to
[1:42:16] bring you to this great message to bring
[1:42:18] you to this great moment
[1:42:20] oh hallelujah hallelujah and brother
[1:42:23] random goes on I'm going to skip through
[1:42:25] it because I've already touched it but
[1:42:26] when the mom said Divine Healing is for
[1:42:29] the Believers the Holy Ghost is to them
[1:42:31] that believe not to the unbelievers and
[1:42:34] they're on their Journey with their goal
[1:42:36] their frankincense and men oh Hallelujah
[1:42:39] can we give the Lord a hand of praise
[1:42:45] said on their Journey they watched he
[1:42:48] said they never took anybody's wood they
[1:42:50] didn't go down and consult any bishop or
[1:42:52] anything God gave them a sign they've
[1:42:55] seen it it was the truth they took out
[1:42:57] after it it led the way it was the one
[1:43:00] the scripture predicted to and friends
[1:43:02] that's what's needed today it's a
[1:43:04] revelation from God to follow the sign
[1:43:07] what is our sign in our day is the
[1:43:09] prophet's message
[1:43:11] because he was a star in the hand of God
[1:43:13] for our day and he didn't Point them to
[1:43:15] himself he said he had to build a
[1:43:18] denomination I made the population of
[1:43:20] people to myself but I'm pointing to the
[1:43:22] resurrected Christ I'm pointing to Jesus
[1:43:24] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:43:27] forever and that's the message that we
[1:43:29] hold to our hearts today
[1:43:33] oh Hallelujah but if I said nobody else
[1:43:36] saw it but these men saw it
[1:43:38] he said nobody saw the light that Paul
[1:43:40] saw
[1:43:41] when it struck him on the road to
[1:43:42] Damascus oh hallelujah oh my my my my he
[1:43:48] said but when you are looking for it
[1:43:50] when you are ready to receive the real
[1:43:51] Christmas present the real Christmas
[1:43:53] give God Christ give the Holy Spirit
[1:43:56] you're looking for it you'll see it it's
[1:43:57] a heaven light sent down from God out of
[1:44:00] Heaven to be a record of Jesus Christ
[1:44:02] they didn't take anybody's elsewhere for
[1:44:05] it in the daytime it was Restless they
[1:44:07] say oh I just can't wait I don't know
[1:44:09] how much longer we'll go we'll probably
[1:44:10] go to Jerusalem remember the light only
[1:44:12] shines in darkness is the only way it's
[1:44:15] recognize if we live in the dark time
[1:44:18] so whenever his brain out in the daytime
[1:44:20] they couldn't see the star so they would
[1:44:22] be arrested but at night when they see
[1:44:23] the stock come out they will be able to
[1:44:25] follow it on down through the rivers
[1:44:27] through the sandbars and everything else
[1:44:29] and by the random types all of this as
[1:44:31] through your struggles through your
[1:44:33] trials through your journey through your
[1:44:35] situation you are following the reveal
[1:44:37] world you are following Jesus Christ the
[1:44:39] light of the world straight to your
[1:44:41] promise
[1:44:44] Hallelujah
[1:44:45] and brother Branham says and I just want
[1:44:47] to get his words in it
[1:44:49] and look Bethlehem was exactly in line
[1:44:52] with Judea from where they and Jerusalem
[1:44:54] was in line with Bethlehem Oh What a
[1:44:56] symbol if you can catch it here's
[1:44:58] Bethlehem and Jerusalem is up here and
[1:45:00] from where the Magi was coming they had
[1:45:02] to come to Jerusalem first because
[1:45:03] before before coming to Bethlehem I'm
[1:45:05] not going to be too much longer do you
[1:45:07] get it the great big self-style
[1:45:09] denominational headquarters yes sir
[1:45:11] Jerusalem where all the denominations
[1:45:13] met together the great Council met there
[1:45:15] so when these men they came and they
[1:45:18] come to this city and the thought there
[1:45:20] it is if anybody will know about this
[1:45:23] and can explain this great mystery light
[1:45:26] to us there's all the high priests here
[1:45:28] there's the doctors of divinity here
[1:45:30] there's all the PHD and lldo brethruent
[1:45:33] Jerusalem is in sight here we go we'll
[1:45:35] have it right into the streets they
[1:45:36] burst it where are you going we got a
[1:45:38] great message where is it where is he
[1:45:40] that's born King of the Jews who is this
[1:45:42] mystery light up there
[1:45:45] brother Branham said to cry goes out
[1:45:49] and nobody responded
[1:45:51] nobody knows what's going on
[1:45:54] they are sitting on with all the Scrolls
[1:45:56] from the prophet Moses
[1:45:58] they have all the books and tips and
[1:46:01] they have no idea
[1:46:03] because they were not looking for the
[1:46:05] sign
[1:46:06] oh Hallelujah
[1:46:09] Glory
[1:46:11] hmm
[1:46:13] he said what's the matter with you see
[1:46:15] but the brother said they didn't have
[1:46:16] the answer but I said they haven't got
[1:46:18] it today they don't know what these
[1:46:21] things are where they ought to know it
[1:46:23] where the great heads of churches ought
[1:46:25] to be aware of these things but God
[1:46:27] always works in the minority and so
[1:46:30] humble that it goes right over top of
[1:46:33] them they don't know it but he fulfills
[1:46:36] his word like that that's it we get our
[1:46:38] own self twisted up in these great big
[1:46:40] things and we can't move God cut us free
[1:46:43] from them things that we can see what
[1:46:45] our we're living in if God has to walk
[1:46:48] through a dream again he can reveal it
[1:46:49] to you sure
[1:46:52] he said they had not the answer of the
[1:46:54] mysterious life they didn't know they
[1:46:56] didn't have it at the headquarters
[1:46:57] neither do they have it today so what
[1:47:00] did they do they call for the word of
[1:47:02] God he said that's the idea they says
[1:47:03] let's look up in the will of God and
[1:47:05] find out where these things are and when
[1:47:07] they call for the word of God the Magi
[1:47:09] was smarter than a lot of people today
[1:47:11] the marriage I saw according to the word
[1:47:13] of God that they didn't have it and
[1:47:15] wasn't going to get it
[1:47:17] they found out that there wasn't even
[1:47:19] the city that wasn't even a place he was
[1:47:21] born in Bethlehem of Judea of the least
[1:47:24] the humblers among all of them the
[1:47:26] little bitty tiny place not the big
[1:47:28] sales title wise men seen right quick
[1:47:31] the word of God revealed it and it
[1:47:33] didn't have it and wasn't going to get
[1:47:34] it so they got out of that mess
[1:47:37] if we could just do the same get out of
[1:47:40] the mess brother Branham said
[1:47:42] after they got out of the
[1:47:48] mind and find out where Christ was going
[1:47:50] to be born the star hit himself
[1:47:53] disappeared but when it came out of
[1:47:55] Jerusalem
[1:47:56] dare the star appeared again there it
[1:47:58] was he said after they got cut loose
[1:48:00] from those things after they got out of
[1:48:03] all them conglomeration of their fussing
[1:48:06] argument and everything down there with
[1:48:07] all the big headquarters was and the big
[1:48:09] high priests and doctors of divinity and
[1:48:12] I never walked around and
[1:48:16] what's the matter with these crazy
[1:48:18] people so they turn their cameras and
[1:48:20] got away from it
[1:48:22] but the man said as long as you tied up
[1:48:23] with a bunch of unbelievers that don't
[1:48:25] believe these things you'll never be
[1:48:26] able you'll be as blind as a bat
[1:48:29] cut yourself away from everything he
[1:48:32] said if it's mother father sister
[1:48:34] brother the nomination or whatever it is
[1:48:37] he said he that won't forsake his own
[1:48:39] and come after me is not even worthy to
[1:48:41] be called mine
[1:48:43] but if I said it means just what it says
[1:48:45] the Bible said it's of no private
[1:48:47] interpretation if it's black it's black
[1:48:49] and white is white that's a prophet's
[1:48:51] word it's the ultimate it's the absolute
[1:48:53] and every man that's born of the spirit
[1:48:56] of God is tighter that no matter nothing
[1:48:58] will separate him from it he's tied to
[1:49:01] that word because it's Christ Christ is
[1:49:03] the word and Christ cannot lie about his
[1:49:05] word for he is the word and you and and
[1:49:09] you say well I know he said that but he
[1:49:11] said there ain't no but
[1:49:12] and nothing about it he just said it
[1:49:15] that way and that's what it is he cannot
[1:49:17] change it he can't he's unchangeable he
[1:49:20] said Heaven and Earth will pass away but
[1:49:22] my word shall never pass away can the
[1:49:25] church say a amen
[1:49:28] so I just want to touch on our star and
[1:49:30] we begin to wind down
[1:49:32] but the Brahman said in the exposition
[1:49:34] of the seven Church ages the sadition
[1:49:36] churches so we see that the seven
[1:49:38] spirits actually refer to the one spirit
[1:49:41] of God working out the will and word of
[1:49:44] God in different Generations I would
[1:49:46] like to illustrate that from the word
[1:49:48] the spirit of God was mightily upon
[1:49:50] Elijah
[1:49:52] then that same Spirit Came Upon Elisha
[1:49:55] in a twofold effect then centuries later
[1:49:59] The Same Spirit which we call a spirit
[1:50:01] of Elijah in order to describe its
[1:50:04] Ministry came back upon John the Baptist
[1:50:07] one day that same Spirit identified by
[1:50:10] the same manner of ministry will come
[1:50:12] upon a man for the end of the Gentile
[1:50:15] Church age he's speaking about himself
[1:50:16] now again the scripture says that God
[1:50:20] anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy
[1:50:22] Ghost and power and he went about doing
[1:50:24] good hearing all that was oppressed of
[1:50:26] the devil as Jesus went away he told his
[1:50:29] disciples that Tarry
[1:50:31] until Pentecost at which time the very
[1:50:34] same spirit that was upon him would come
[1:50:36] back and fall upon them and fill them
[1:50:39] then that called out body the church
[1:50:42] will be in his stand upon the Earth
[1:50:44] taking his place and because that same
[1:50:47] spirit that was in him would be in them
[1:50:49] they would do the very same works
[1:50:52] and any people that is truly the body of
[1:50:55] Jesus Christ the true church WIll
[1:50:57] manifest the same works as the Jesus and
[1:51:00] the Pentecostal church because the same
[1:51:02] spirit will be in them any other church
[1:51:05] that does not have the spirit and the
[1:51:07] manifestations is going to have to
[1:51:10] account to God it also says here that
[1:51:12] these Seven Stars or seven Messengers to
[1:51:16] the seven churches are in his hand he is
[1:51:19] holding them you know right away that if
[1:51:22] they are held in his hand they are
[1:51:24] associated with his power that is what
[1:51:27] the hand signifies it signifies the
[1:51:29] power of God and authority of God not
[1:51:32] one of them came in his own power and
[1:51:35] authority that is what Paul said no man
[1:51:38] would dare to it takes the authority of
[1:51:40] God and the power of the Holy Ghost the
[1:51:43] gospel is preached by the authority of
[1:51:45] God in the power of the spirit these men
[1:51:47] were all empowered by the Holy Ghost
[1:51:49] they all stand up to the world they
[1:51:51] could do that they were full of God they
[1:51:53] were sent or authorized by God not by
[1:51:56] self or other men
[1:51:58] and in the patwa's vision last major
[1:52:00] quote but the Branham said the mystery
[1:52:02] of the Seven Stars in Revelation which
[1:52:05] thou sawest in my right hand and the
[1:52:07] Seven golden candlesticks the Seven
[1:52:09] Stars are the Angels or messengers of
[1:52:12] the seven Church ages
[1:52:14] and the Seven Cardinal sexual saw us are
[1:52:17] the seven churches we have already
[1:52:19] discovered the truth of these two
[1:52:20] Mysteries oh we haven't revealed who
[1:52:22] these seven Messengers were but by the
[1:52:24] help of God we will and that mystery
[1:52:26] will be accomplished The Seven Ages we
[1:52:28] know they are listed in the world and we
[1:52:30] will deal with each so as to come up to
[1:52:33] this last age in which we live but in
[1:52:36] one last closing glimpse of this chapter
[1:52:38] see him as he stands there in the midst
[1:52:40] of the Golden Lamb stands with the Seven
[1:52:43] Stars in his right hand oh it is
[1:52:45] breathtaking to see him standing there
[1:52:47] in his Supreme deity he is the judge the
[1:52:50] priest the king the eagle the lamb the
[1:52:53] lion the alpha the Omega the beginning
[1:52:55] and the end the father son the Holy
[1:52:58] Ghost he which was which is which is to
[1:53:01] come the almighty the all in all there
[1:53:04] he is the Altar and finisher Worthy is
[1:53:07] that lamb he proved his word as he
[1:53:10] brought our salvation by himself now he
[1:53:13] stands in all of his his power and all
[1:53:16] of his glory all things committed unto
[1:53:18] him as judge
[1:53:20] yesterday he stands amidst the lamb
[1:53:22] stands with the Stars in his hand it is
[1:53:25] night for that is when we use lamps for
[1:53:28] the light and that is when the stars are
[1:53:31] seen shining and reflecting the light of
[1:53:33] the sun and it is dark the church is
[1:53:36] walking by faith in the darkness her
[1:53:39] Lord departed his Earth but the Holy
[1:53:41] Spirit still shines out through the
[1:53:43] church giving light to this old sin
[1:53:46] cursed world and those stars reflect his
[1:53:48] light also and the only light they have
[1:53:51] is his light
[1:53:53] how dark it is how spiritually Cold Yet
[1:53:56] when he comes into the midst of it his
[1:53:58] light and warm the church is empowered
[1:54:00] and through him does the works that he
[1:54:03] did all that people might get a glimpse
[1:54:05] of him as did John what manner of people
[1:54:08] he ought to be standing before him at
[1:54:10] that day but the Branham now begins to
[1:54:13] switch he said if you haven't already
[1:54:14] given your life to him may you turn your
[1:54:17] heart to God this moment and kneel down
[1:54:19] right where you are and ask his
[1:54:20] forgiveness for your sins and surrender
[1:54:22] your life to him can the church
[1:54:25] same and
[1:54:27] I love in the same message we have found
[1:54:30] we have seen a star and come to worship
[1:54:32] with the Branham after speaking about
[1:54:34] all of this he begins to switch and the
[1:54:36] musician can play Softly
[1:54:38] he said I got a good business I know
[1:54:40] it's flourishing he's saying that's what
[1:54:42] somebody might say brother do you know
[1:54:44] one of these days a heart attack might
[1:54:46] take you at four in the morning and you
[1:54:48] have to lead that business
[1:54:49] then where are you going after that
[1:54:53] he said when you love to have the
[1:54:55] wouldn't that be the greatest Christmas
[1:54:56] present anybody could get the gift of
[1:54:59] eternal life
[1:55:00] God so loved the world he gave his only
[1:55:02] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[1:55:04] him should not perish but have
[1:55:06] everlasting life
[1:55:07] we have seen a star in the east and have
[1:55:10] come to worship Him
[1:55:12] civilization has traveled with the Sun
[1:55:14] from the East coming West we are on the
[1:55:16] west coast now East and West has met we
[1:55:19] can't go no further
[1:55:21] the oldest civilization is trying to
[1:55:23] plumb back the other side of the world
[1:55:24] remember it's gone and sinners traveled
[1:55:27] with civilization
[1:55:28] [Music]

[1:55:39] take he's got many thousands laying
[1:55:42] sleeping in the Earth First Watch second
[1:55:43] watch third fourth fifth sixth and this
[1:55:45] is the seven watch remember that's when
[1:55:48] he come in the seven watch and in that
[1:55:50] watch he found wise virgins and virgins
[1:55:53] that had the oil out of their lamp oil

[1:57:14] chopped up if I call it a Christmas
[1:57:15] message

[1:58:17] Whiskers hanging down to his waistline
[1:58:18] put his wife and his baby on a moon and
[1:58:21] a mule and went down to Egypt where he
[1:58:23] had a whole Army to take over for him
