I was really blessed Sunday I wasn't here but I heard the service I was really inspired by it amen praise the name of the Lord Revelation chapter 2 verse 1 under the angel of the Church of Ephesus right these things yet he that hold his Seven Stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks I knew I work Sunday labor and thy patience and other not bear them which are evil those Trident which say the apostles and are not and found them liars and as born and as patients and for my namesake as labored and has not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because I was left I first love remember therefore from Wednesday about falling and repent and do the first work so as I will come unto thee quickly and remove like Candlestick out of his place except our repent and this door has the doll it is the deed of the Nicolaitans which I also hate either that air let him hear what the spirit sees Under the churches to him that overcome it will I give to eat of the Tree of Life which in the midst of the paradise of god let's pray father we thank you for your word may you break the bread of life to us and father may you send us Sarah strong here tonight to drive every soul back to that tree of life where we partake of that tree of life tonight in Jesus and we ask it amen amen before you have a scissors turn around and Shake somebody hand next to you then you could have your seats or praise the name of the Lord praise goes to tonight I have a title he's had air let him hear praise God let him hear of a subject the age of the overcomer another theme the Tree of Life the spirit line I didn't want to put that inspiration just a team this tree of life the spirit line so here we go the title he that has an ear let him hear subject the age of the overcomer and the team is the Tree of Life the spirit line and brother Branham said you have to constantly stay in the spirit of Revival you have to constantly stay in a Revival on your hood but Isaac said Sunday you overcome and keeps life in you if like a tree fall dead and water they come to church and they're just dead and you don't hear any word word word the rotten fasting church that die fast in the church because there's no overcoming you have to start to overcome overcoming keeps life in you brings life into you amen praise God anybody could smoke and drink and fool around but you choose a certain walk this is the way we call it narrow way you choose this and this is what I say as a choice as a young man when a god called me 17. I choose this way I have to get girlfriend and this and that all I was focusing on the Lord and pleasing him amen I've lost this one I lost that one but I was pleasing him because I was called to serve him then the castle of God in the world at the same time they can't be in between you have to make up your mind you have to be clear and clean and that that choice of choosing Christ has brought my life the way it is right now it's a right choice you can't go wrong choosing Christ Oh Glory to God because you're fighting to live and you're living to die Oh Glory to God I said you're fighting to live and you're living to die you still have to meet this living God the one who put you here Oh Glory we see them people walk with them Tall World heels they could almost do like I don't know like what kind of gymnastic is that but they don't see 40 years 50 years from that they have to wear flats Oh Glory to God that's only temporary all these stars is temporary beauty is temporary all praise God all this thing is temporary but here we are get to come to get to receive Eternal things that would last or glory to God you believe that Hallelujah glory to God Amen priests beating Jesus let him hear what the spirit says in the churches they're not overcome it will I give the eat of the tree of life which is the midst of the paradise of God and I love the type and the reference that was brought on Sunday that when you get the subjects as a reward 45 years in school or you're doing exams you have a reward go to rewards with Overcomers and you know the beautiful thing beautiful thing about it every age that Overcomers there wasn't a single age that God would never overcome every single age I've overcome us what about this age what about your age what about your time and we are declaring this is the age of the Overcomer Overcomer it's you the individual and then you have whatever bunch of Overcomers you the individual call to overcome you're the individual culture here it's not the church is you the individual have to have an air to hear that you have to come out your nonsense come with your foolishness Oh Glory to God and receive Christ and walk in the light of the world that you could please God that God proud of you that God want the boast about you glory to God God can turn your whole family against you you're still serve him because Joseph was like that Oh Glory look at his own Brethren rejected him but he was predestinated he was elected he was called he was chosen and I don't care what you go through tonight if God elected you there is enough devils in hell to cancel that election that's why you should be shocking tonight no child no testing could cancel your election and God because who he formed you he called who he called he justified and we Justified he has already glorified amen [Applause] so here's the way you overcome first you have to overcome then you can eat the fruit it's the Overcomer you remember the other night our teaching last night Jonah to get in the spirit before he saw anything how are you going to set scene if he's not a Baptist and go listen to him if he had Presbyterian I'm gonna listen to him if you don't teach just exactly what my church teaches you ain't going to overcome he said because you ain't got in the spirit yet you are all out of order getting this Spirit to the Lord Jesus I love you now reveal to me anything you see fit just bring it to me and then you're getting all right so I can't hear this preacher I can't hear this thing I believe but if you're in the spirit you're just looking for the Lord to speak to you you want a word from the Lord you know God gives that donkey God can use that man then the pulpit praise God I don't care what that man come with tonight because you have a need because you have a daughter of God because you are Son of God God going to anoint that man to speak to your need God going to anoint that man to speak to your condition it will be direct inspiration not some intellectual word word no the spirit line good morning three times in the Bible speaks of the Tree of Life Genesis three times Revelation three times and that's the two books that the devil hates Genesis Revelation two books because Genesis is beginning Revelation tell you his ending he hates those two books then he was saying on my right hand is a tree called the tree of life and the left is the called the tree of knowledge how many knows that the Bible said that there's a tree of life and there's a tree of knowledge and Adam lost his fellowship with God when he took the bite of knowledge but the tree of life was to be handled by faith and faith alone God said so I believe it God said so he's a Healer God said so he's a deliverer God said so he's a way maker I'm not trying to figure out anything I'm trusting The Lord Oh Glory to gods and then you have confidence and all Romans 8 20th and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them what he called according to his purpose and you'll trust the Lord and your trust is goodness and your trust is done judgment that he will do right on your behalf [Applause] so when Jesus encountered these scribes and Pharisees and these religious people they say oh far is it man in the wilderness honey send everyone dead oh my father is Mana Mana inbred this is Genesis talking back here now let the Tree of Life in the form of the bread of life speaking to them now I am the living bread if a man eater to me he shall not die oh my the bread of life was from the Tree of Life where they were eaten from the Garden of Eden he was the tree of life now if the tree of life was a person the tree of knowledge is a person it's just two trees is there four trees there's two trees one is a word intellectual line and one of the spirit line and the spirit line is the Tree of Life Oh Glory to God so Jesus said your father's eat man in the wilderness and they are dead but I am the bread of life what bread of life from Eden that a man may eat this bread and shall not die what did the angel said they stopped Adam from that tree they got the tree Lizzy partake and live forever if you eat of that tree of life you'll live forever eternal life so the angel was there to block the tree stopping Adam from taking in the tree because he already broke the Covenant already he broke the word from the Lord already but right now in this hour those same Angels those same set of films they are not guarding the tree they are driving you back to the tree every time you fall down and say get back up you do something wrong repent they keep pushing you oh don't stay there you can live higher than that you're not higher than the animals you are a little lower than the Angels oh come on get there come on I'll get the Lord and Shout [Applause] you are sons of God you are called to a higher level you are called to a higher plane oh man hallelujah praise God praise God praise God so say instead of the Angel oh they're trying to keep him from this tree it is driving them along to the street the angels of the churches to every person bring them back to the name of Jesus Christ who is the tree of life so all God trying to get you back is to the word go trying to get you back to the lies go out and get you back to the tree go attack but get you back to the spirit line because the Bible said knowledge shall increase or Glory because in a way of knowledge and man is being trained to depend upon knowledge and what man knowledge has produced that produce bank card automatic this automatic that computers phones everything else that's the intelligence of man that's not faith in God Amen in God's kingdom you don't even need a cell phone Elijah was hearing what he was talking Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah them talking all their secrets and Elijah in it normal normal and it's enough self that was Wireless long time we had that long time okay the Lord has shouting us automatically [Music] we had automatic stuff long time hallelujah praise God make us a little bit of yacht and big boat or whatnot and Jesus walk on the water so we get canceled and defy gravity and do a lot of stuff that man knows nothing about they say the girl dead and Jesus said I go wake her she is sleep at let's go and wake her get me unbelief out that's what we're talking about Five Loaves two fishes blessed multiplier that's what we're talking about don't you see the power of the Living God and he was the example son so you are going to be a powered son you are here to get power you are here to receive power you are here they got a Revival you're here to come under a higher expectation cherubims [Applause] was sent to God the Tree of Life the way of life the way to the Tree of Life and Jesus come and said I am the way oh glory to God is not right hallelujah praise God and when John was in the spirit there was four Guardians around the throne face that Ox the face of an eagle the face of a man a face of a land isn't that right there they are again just in Genesis God in the throne and Burma said it was God in the Shekinah Glory that knows could just partake out of it so you can use God like if he's a Talisman or he's some kind of good luck charm you use him when you want him you ask him when you need him when you're sick you pray when you're not sick you forget who he is and you only sign up on God and make a tick because you want him when you have him like if you ever wanna shrink I need you tonight I don't need you tomorrow I need you and whenever I need you you send for him you can't use God so and you can't use God's servants like that either for your selfish whims and fancies you can use God like that you're self-centered you have to get out of that because God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son he was himself centered he was one of the get glory to restore back Adam's Fallen race so he made a sacrifice and Shake of the Robes of glory and coming Amen in flesh to redeem you and I to feel like you and I to go through the stress and the pressure that he could know what they're going through that he could be a perfect intercessor glory to God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah Glory two seeds two sons call to bring up our friends unto God after time rolled by God said okay fellas time to worship now let me see your revelation of who you see that I am and Kim bring flutes and Adam and and Abel just pick a lamb and cut the truth and the blood splashing and God Rejoice because Abel operated by revelation and God was pleased and God rejected Cain offering and God gave a simple offer to came just do like we're better do and some people not even humble enough to do what did Brother do what does sister do to be blessed my God there's a reason why that person is blessed when brother Isaac said a tremendous thing you can't fault somebody who put the exam and put the effort to study and they get all ones and get distinctions you can have sex and angry with them and you playing around fooling around you have to understand that that person was praying enough to make extra whatever foolish version that's the Virgin who was actually putting in the effort to get the extra oil because when the bridegroom came the other version said go on go and buy and I was going to pay the price go and study now go and beat book now go and press now go and get excited now get in the spirit now you had your chance understand the spirit going to run out you know you talk about the last drop in the bucket Channel so if you get desperate here start to think about it it's not to think about getting the spirit start to think about getting serious because the spirit running out you know Oh Glory to God just like your age running out heading down Hallelujah I think one like God when I reach 18 or 21 like out you have three more nights ago next like out of 45 on next time over 56 here your last Light physical but

we're coming back [Music] [Applause] [Applause] oh we are connecting tonight with a spirit line the god holiday there's an intellectual line and there's a spirit line and that Spirit line hold on to it because that takes you back to the tree of life that client takes you back to Eden that's the bloodline that follows the way all to the book of redemption it was the blood of Heaven Oh Glory it was the blood in Egypt it's the blood is the blood is the blood Jesus died and cared the price shed his blood thou must redeemed Us by thy blood it's a bloodline and one says the blood you will see the spirit oh give the Lord a shout that's why the churches that they are so dead there is no blood there but tonight you have a seven Thunder blood this is the black man lifeline [Applause] I wouldn't trade this for nothing in the world [Applause] and this season I don't care how much Mysteries a man could preach and reveal and how much hours they could take explain it that will never change the revelation of God like how Abel came and just cut that RAM and blood splash I could never change that oh my all those brothers were connected to a lifeline when he was about to die he said listen I know God going to visit you but when you leave Egypt not if you leave Egypt he said take my bones with you don't leave my bones here I know Messiah coming and Promised Land Messiah come in and Canaan land Messiah coming in the pyramid where there is Faith on fruit you want knowledge and Temperance and patience and courtiness and brotherly kindness charity gonna step into Earth Oh Glory to God

Hallelujah he was like a light man just like you and I but he was a son oh and not only the sons of God these are God's Sons they are the failures they had the mistakes they had the shortcomings but they were sons of God and God packed them up and God going to back you up because the whole creation has grown in and travailing for the manifestation of the sons of God you are going to be delivered that's why I'm preaching my destinite I am convinced of that [Applause] seven seven noticed all them evil spirits affecting an infecting your life they have to leave they have to go seven notice the sickness in your body silver them notice we'd rather wait to see anything we still let them notice because the enforce are coming to enforce every claim that remain that's why you have to know what

[Applause] I went to the enemy camp Hallelujah and I took back what he stole from me took back what he stole from me took back what he stole from me I went to the enemy camp oh God we are in any 18 Satan's Eden we are clean up our place getting ready for a mighty visitation of the power and the kingdom of God Oh Glory to God Hallelujah glory to God Hallelujah it's an Eden had an altar and brother Branham says there you are Back to Eden through the altar that is where they came to worship right at the altar and they were to keep that lady and guard it and they couldn't get back until this order was covered until the altar was covered with blood restore the altar back to your home before the altar back to your life before Elijah called for fire he first restored the altar Oh Glory to God put back up the altar he altar is where all the man of God offers sacrifices unto God the altar is where you put the prayer up to the Living God hallelujah bring that water back don't let his cell phone get between you and the altar don't let the internet and Facebook and whatever get between you and adalter restore back the Altar and then Elijah asks for wood and he asks for water because he know Fire coming from above when those men were so assured of God they had no doubts in their mind he said Porter poor water pour some more water because if no one he calls for fire what was this battle let the god that answer by fire not my more coats by fire let him be God not make more talk oh give the Lord a shout it's going to come down to that that the manifestation will be the

perfect perfect and that Perfection not what your wife see or your husband see is what God sees when God said God said perfect and right now you are perfect through the blood we are feeling perfect but God sees it that way you can see unbelief he's hitting here with that one because the amen scan these counties Canty and you're looking around to see who we're talking about God talking same about you Mighty Man of Allah so who is talking to who he's talking to I am the least I am the this you go say what you want I'm not talking to your flesh I'm not talking to what you think and what you feel I'm talking to the Sea that's inside of you that connected reality of the longest word has been preached [Applause] [Music] listen listen if Jesus didn't see and recognize the potential in all the disciples our sons give them into his hands he can never deal with him to read it every opportunity Jesus Jesus the Same books I do shall you do also if you shall say this morning you shall do we what is them these are Rascals these are unconverted men they just following Jesus they don't have the Holy Ghost yet but he gave them promise after promise I'll not leave you confidence I'll come to you little while the world see at me no more but you shall see me you only get them promised after promise after promise in other words he's not holding them back from their destiny by by holding back the prophecy let me get this way he told Peter Peter the devil desire to sift you I quit Lucifer part but I pray for you that your faith that mean he had it you know [Music] come on that wasn't outside of the middle that was in him it said Faith to go in the upper room it said to receive Christ it takes hate to believe the word it takes Fear To Worship [Applause] one leper came back to Jesus and worshiped him and thank him just say well the other night were all of them here he said thy faith had made it home so the restaurant by obedience this one had obedience plus fate bring him back to give God praise and when you have real faith it will make you sure that you come and you give God the praise due unto his name [Music] [Applause] [Music] how do you come into the Shekinah Glory how do you commit his presence choose self-will he said you're coming to God's presence you have to want to change you have to want to access that she kind of glory and recognize you are destined you are predestinated to access it if it wasn't elected you could never even see this message you can even see this word God elected you to see it when you were called Millions were lost you are one in a million God call you chose you Oh Glory Hallelujah prison thank you Jesus Hallelujah okay now this is we find out that Joseph take them among his Brethren said all to himself his brothers and then there comes as a greeting realize as long as they dwelt in the dwelling place and kept up that's a good thing to stay in the place positionally but they got rid of the spirit take note of that by the clients they know position only where they are but the spirit the spirit line got dismissed so they could know and talk and no one talk and talk and know and talk and know and no one talk but when the spirit is out there's just no one talk the fundamentals today positionally know what they are by intellectual conception of the Bible but there is no spirit you know why they have rejected Joseph they turn him out they want nothing to do with it it's a bunch of Holy Rollers they have ex Community him they were out of their Fellowship the church feels they don't need the Holy Spirit the church they will tell you that men can stand up and give you such an intellectual talk that could almost make you believe it no let's stop here a minute didn't Jesus say the two clothes so close together the elective is possible he said the intellectual talks would be so smooth that it would deceive the people it is Gospel it is man who can handle that word in such a way that he could make any intellectual person if they are trusting in their intellectuals they would condemn the Holy Spirit and take the way of man Oh Glory to God you see when they condemn the holy spirit that the boss about the man that bringing out these intellectual Revelations as the man of the hour oh yeah the Holy Ghost is the man and they are you're following a man that's right the man Christ Jesus oh give the Lord some praises the Holy Ghost is the prophet of the hour that's why the spirit the prophet and the bride says the same thing [Applause] so I don't need no man no new man to explain to me something I was watching our friend is any Prophet a seven Angel messenger in his right hand Hallelujah Vindicated Prophet to bring dust in the Lord and I mind trying to explain that like if you are more revision than that I will say shut up and tell your story walking or give the Lord some Praises people Oh Glory to God the prophet said that right no man can make him to otherwise the secret is the word is in the bride no man could persuade them otherwise and no man could take me out of those say the Lord that Elijah Prophet prophecy I am resting on that I am preaching that I am echoing what that tape said by Revelation and inspiration I know this can't fail I know this is darcia the Lord Oh Glory to God is a few more I want to show you Hallelujah Joseph represents the Spirit-filled church and Joseph was hated by his Brethren why because he was spiritual Oh Glory to God oh Hallelujah you watch that robe love of his father Hallelujah his father give him a quarter many colors if you watch that road without seem which represented the holy spirit that covered his being and today is the holy spirit that covers the church the robe of Many Colors and there are seven colors in the rainbow so listen that bloodline that tree of Lifeline that Spirit line is here tonight God wants you to connect with that line Oh Glory to God that's the Joseph line brother oh brother give me a church full of the Holy Ghost God will do in one year what all theories you failed to do in 2000 years you wait till the anointing of the church really strikes home to that faithful Remnant after the daughter of the Gentile is closed God will anoint the church then he was filthy gonna be filthy still who is righteous gonna be righteous still so anointing is coming a super anointing Supreme anointing coming to strike the church Oh Glory to God so God put in the word on in you to receive that anointing Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God hallelujah praise God Amen glory to God so Moses brought the people up to the land but Joshua was commissioned to take them over and that land was Canaan land which did not represent the Millennium he said that land represent the age of the overcomer Oh Glory to God that's the Ephesians the age of the Overcomer where you fight for your portion you fight for your sons you fight for your daughters you fight in prayer you're wrestle in prayer [Applause] [Music] Devils upon your daughter upon your son upon you in the family we go our battle against flesh and blood once goes to go show them read this and read this and whatever but it's power they needed when

atmosphere but you know atmosphere you are getting conscious listen you know it's Devils nobody has to tell you that you know that experience upon people it has to be so because the Holy Ghost is upon you but you are not super conscious yet of what is upon you but that conscience has to come [Music] because Jesus said wasn't in the anointing Jesus Faith wasn't who he was [Music] [Applause] that's perfect for it when you know who you are you know they're doing all of that he just lay hands upon the sick you don't want to pray but Obama is talking about Minister and his wife but don't know what went on with him what kind of condition he had some kind of condition some kind of mental condition he came to the office with the prophet Brahma says pray just talk tell the man what you do on this he says there's a click of the Holy Spirit and then I was completely delivered he didn't even have to pray do we have faith now there are no sweep into your home sleep over your loved ones and family

the blood of Jesus [Music] [Applause] let's flood heaven with praises brother [Applause] Hallelujah did you notice Joshua before they crossed Jordan he said go to the midst of the camp clean your clothes something for everyone of you let no man come at his wife for within three days you shall see the glory of God it's a process of getting ready to inherit the promise so I want to say promise once is the promise of God what is it tell it pull like baram says I feel the turtle moving now I feel to pray for everybody that's a different anointing now oh glory to God there's a process in going to inherit the promise isn't that right and God gave Abraham the promise of the land of Palestine to be a possession forever sure he's still in the journey isn't that right justification sanification Wilderness no place of rest traveling night and day but then the believer comes to Amen to the Holy Ghost and that's the promised land Oh Glory to God they believe in two Works justification signification and put it this way justification didn't put Christ in suddenly he didn't put him in the Holy Ghost himself comes in number three puts him inside of you a new heart a new spirit then my spirit Oh Glory they're gonna say it again a new hat a new spirit then my spirit come inside of you number three puts them inside of there but the Believers on Caleb Joshua outfit was going into the promised land they move over to the land and took the land and sat down in the land of their possession so you want to go from profession to possession [Music] you add a message when you see me you see the message and a message be become one Oh Glory the God hallelujah praise God are you with me now so watch let's not leave say a button he said let's not believe in the Lord Jesus being baptized let's not stop because he clears my life for sin but now we press into a position to a promise for the baptism of the Holy Ghost for the promise unto you and to your children and them that are far off and how Joshua and all those women are closing musician can't place and a woman hold them the children were born by inspiration and how each Man by their groanings and travailing they were placed positionally by names and so on like that he said God how that God has set some in the church through their labor pains they get tremendous sometimes tremendous sometimes so we're paying you in we're hurting you what pain you talking about sometimes your pain is your own pain in trouble your mouth put you in trouble and you get put with your aunt and your uncle and your auntie and your neighbor and whatnot and this one saying that and you you start the fire ninja run and Duncan hide we're not talking about that you know that you this is labor pains now you see Jesus was led by the Holy Ghost Into the Wilderness Jesus Jesus wasn't painful since God God save me within this because when you repeat it wasn't that he was led by the Holy Ghost to deal with the Devil and the devil didn't know who he was they were thought was ordinary Joseph's son Carpenter Boyner Mary in the same house and whatnot I mean and if thou be the Son of God contain this bread Stone in the bread and Jesus watched his Stone and and know the power within him you feel the anointing not that he just said it back he was tempted you know like when you have a good cake or bacon somebody said you don't touch it and all the nose glands activated all he smells the right smell just I get nothing I said don't even touch that that like that I don't want the sin but it is smelling good but Jesus was tempted and he said it's written so that means he put his his desires and his aside to to connect with the word That's it man shall live by bread alone but but have you oh she's hungry you know I mean he's hungry never say you need bread this one fresh fresh and he said man shall live by Petaluma by every word the proceed of saying they ever say aha okay and he decided to write down and go down to the wood now and see what I mean if he shall he shall let the angels beat him up if you take a jump you want you to come into His Head because the jump it means he break a new law the word God said thou shall jump and I will teach you plain Angel to go and jump off Jesus and and to do that now he introducing all the kingdoms and he said this is mines you know you know what I mean another man always have a disaster in control to be in charge of who is who is more important you want to be in control he said well look at this so she said video screen and spread it the curve once all around all the world

is growing under the persecution of the outside world believing in the Lord Jesus that the promise the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real to us as it was the Pentecost how they're grown and cry under labor pain but when they are born and positionally Born Into the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has set in the church some Apostles some prophets some teachers some pastors some evangelists
