presence tonight we love you we thank you for your blood we thank you for the word for the atonement we thank you for bringing Clarity to us of this prophetic Vision that was released by this end time messenger father come and bless us tonight with your word with your spirit with your presence and power With Your Love granted God in Jesus name I ask it amen God bless you it's good to be back I was out of the country special but we are back so tonight I like to turn to Psalms 103 we want to read from 8 to4 Matthew 6 9-15 and Ephesians 429 to 32 reading from Psalms 1038 the Lord is merciful and gracious slow to anger and plenteous in Mercy he will not always tride neither will he keep his anger forever he ha not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities but as the heaven is high above the Earth so great is his Mercy towards them that fear Him and as far as the East is from the West so far had he removed our transgression from us like as a father peted his children so the P them that fear Him for he knoweth our frame he remember but be on Dust Matthew chapter I'm going to read from verse Jesus speaks after this manner therefore pray ye Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done Earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for that is the Kingdom power and the glory forever amen for if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you forgive not men TR es neither will your father forgive your trespasses our last scri is from Ephesians from 4 read verse 29 it reads let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edify that it may Minister Grace unto the heers and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby the day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake had forgiven you may God bless his word you may be seated praise the name of the Lord so tonight I have a a special Something in My Heart I'd like to share with you and the title I have tonight is brotherly kindness as a key and a sign brotherly kindness as a key and a sign the ti have tonight a sign of maturity and a key that open UPS a channel to pull down charity or to pull down the love of God or to pull down the Holy Spirit you see where brotherly kindness is located just to the top the pyramid is wide at the bottom it is challenges as it get to the top because it get to the top it narrows it Narrows down to the blood of the age it Narrows down to the spirit of forgiveness it Narrows down to challenge all of us to make sure there's no ODS grudges bitterness or issues in our hearts now Jesus when he read this scripture how to pray in the Amplified I I want to read it and forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven left remitted let go of the debts and give them up resentment against our debtors and lead us bring us not in temptation but Deliver Us from all evil for yours is the kingdom the power and the glory but if you forgive people their trespasses their Reckless and willful sins leaving them letting them go giving up resentment your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you do not forgive others their trespasses this is amplifying now their Reckless and willful sins leaving them letting them go giving up resentment that resentment is resentment in you not only must you let it go but you have to give up this word called resentment so I want to drill down a bit to tonight these are things I never did before but I feel led to do this now resentment is the feeling of angry displeasure at something regarded as wrong insult or injury in a relationship a mixture of anger frustration and bitterness that builds up over time you get a husband resenting a wife a wife resenting a husband somebody resenting is something that just builds up over time there is no one specific cause of resentment but we know it is the enemy but this merging of disgust disappointment disapproval bitterness anger towards someone can creep in and take a hold of you resentment is when you hold on to the anger at not being treated as well as you think you deserve do you get that let me read it again resentment is when you hold on to the anger I forgive him you know but you're Vex you said have resentment in your heart you know forgive you know drop it but there's something there you have a feeling towards that person you can't even relate to that person because there was something there it's a feeling that is there so how can you come out of resentment you can come out of resentment forgive for Christ's sake when you think he has forgiven you then you should be free to forgive others and Let It Go W so this night it's an important night it's important word this should share with us a key to fate a key to Healing question why would God show brother Bram his forgiveness after he was saved and filled with the Holy Ghost did you get that but AB Bram had to go through actual experience for God to show him about forgiveness this is after he is saved after he have the Holy Ghost you have to take him to a restaurant and show him a woman and he say God my daughter go raised in this kind of condition why don't burn on the place and whatnot go tap him on the shoulder give him a vision of him as a little child all his sins comeing to God and His sins being bumped off and a bookmark forgiven and God put his sins in the sea of forgetfulness he said I forgive you and you could never her do you get this this is a prophet saved Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost but still need Clarity and a revelation and experience of God's forgiveness that's how important it is because you know what was coming up a test so I have this here why would God show B branam his forgiveness after he was saved and filled with the Holy Ghost is this key connected to the third person this key key of forgiveness how God want us to forgive one another unforgiveness what it does let's go forgiveness forgiveness is the release on the part of the Creditor or the offended party of any expectation that a debt will be repaid in the Old Testament this thing about debt was con connected to finance and that's why when a family is owing they were sold into slavery and bondage and that's why you would hear the Year of Jubilee and so on because this was a critical thing in those times you fall into debt then you have to sell your whole children your whole family and then be a slave to that whatever it is and so on until here the year Jubilee or until somebody pay off that debt so the Bible that why Jesus pray the pray forgive us our debt as we forgive our debts that was the condition that was the idea that was the thought that was waited at that time so therefore watch so forgiveness the release on the part of the Creditor or offended party of any expectation that a debt will be repaid or that the offender will receive punishment for an offense So when you say reap s um let God judge him and you have forgive nothing you're in wickedness do you get that now I will see what happened to him and you're looking to see when he go fall or when you going to crash because he do this he do that she do this she do that and you're looking for things to mash up the removal of this debt or this expectation of being paid back does not condone the behavior it doesn't agree with the behavior of the person but it releases them you don't have nothing you don't owe me nothing you are free because that is what God did to us we were born in sin shap and in and Jesus come and drop our charges and say you don't owe me anything you are free as if you never did it oh give the Lord a shout tonight as if you never did Sin as if you never did fall as if you never they failed oh give the Lord some Praises tonight hallelujah hallelujah so in the Old Testament this word forgive this the word called zaka an offense against someone the result is a kind of forget fulness concerning the debt so in the Old Testament when you forgive you forget you let it go you oh God you ready Bor for me ready owe me you know and you're o and you and you're writing your mind you're talking to this one about it you're telling this one about that let's go the result of a kind of forgetfulness concerning the deth of offense it also Carri the word to atone cleaning repairing in the New Testament the term that it gives I wouldn't call all the Greek term and whatnot and Hebrew and whatnot it's it's not reconing an offense against someone in other words you know they did it but you're not hold it against them am I preaching to Believers tonight it's a release from an obligation or a removal of a burden within this context oh this forgiveness may be portray but may be portrayed as a release from an obligation shimi begged David to forgive him in 2 Samuel 19:19 and he said unto the king let not my Lord impute iniquity unto me neither do do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my Lord the king went of Jerusalem that the king should take it to heart this is the man begging oh God don't hold it against me oh God don't hold it against me I was acting perversely I was acting contrary but to hold it on me again in Ezekiel 13:14 this is God speaks God speaking when I say unto the wicked Thou shalt surely die if he turn from his sin and do that which is lawful and right if the wicked restore the pledge give again that what he had robbed walk in the statutes of life without committing iniquity he shall surely live he shall not die none of his sins that he had committed shall be mentioned unto him this is God talking that that Hallelujah a wicked man repent a wicked man make things right a wicked man Hallelujah come back in line God said none of his sins hey that he had committed shall be mentioned unto him he had done that which is lawful and right he shall surely live could we hear a shout in the house tonight oh give the Lord some Praises oh this is called a jubilee in your soul tonight Hallelujah such forgetfulness focus on the magnanimous action of the one who is granting that forgiveness hallelujah hallelujah forgiveness has not taken account of wrong in the sense it treats an offense as a debt that would no longer be counted against somebody account so when you have the book there you owe me you owe me owe me when you forgive you drop it no longer in any books you take it out the books it is cancelled Jesus drop your charges your case is dismiss you are saved by grace oh give the Lord some Praises tonight if this don't make you shout if this don't make you say hallelujah Glory something is wrong with you oh glory to God if this don't make Believers give God an extra praise this night I don't know what wrong with you Glory Glory metaphorically they said this is like a blemish that must be covered a stain that must be cleansed a disease or fracture that must be healed forgiveness can be expressed as any of these actions oh glory to God God in Psalms 32:1 says blessed is he whose transgression is Forgiven whose sin is covered Oh Glory oh God I make a feel the shout tonight did you hear that scripture here Psalms 32 says blessed is he whose transgression Is Forgiven whose sin is covered blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputed not iniquity and whose Spirit there is no gu and I can shout tonight oh give the Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God hallelujah he had made me glad I Will Rejoice for he had made me glad Hallelujah he had made me glad hallelujah oh my all right WR with me tonight 1 John 1 says then this is the message we have heard of him and declare unto you this is the message that God is light and in him there's no Darkness at all let them bring the Mysteries let them bring the revelations let them bring the inspiration let them press play but God is light and in him there is no Darkness at all let them bring the Apostle let them bring the prophet let them bring the pope let them bring whoever they want to bring but this is the message that God is light and in him there is no Darkness at all oh give the Lord some Praises oh God I feel the Holy Spirit right here tonight if we say we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth Oh Glory to God let me get you a bum the prophet said love demands Fellowship a man can have love of God and keep him by himself no no no no no something that a crazy kind of love that's not Bible love that's not scriptural love love demands Fellowship oh give the Lord a shout in the house love will break down walls love will break down partitions if we say you may be seated if we say we are fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie I do not the truth but if we walk in the light and as he's in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin hey oh God I feel like rning tonight help me preach somebody if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us but if we confess our sins he is faithful to forgive our sins and to cleanse us Oh Glory to God from all unrighteousness woo Hallelujah if we say we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in US Oh Glory to God this forgiveness is freeing a person from guilt and its consequences when that woman was caught in the act adultery and all those men was prepared to Stone her and Jesus told those men go and sin no more I'm go and go which one of you without sin cast the first stone he turn his back on them as to not embarrass them one by one the left when he turned to the woman he said woman where are thine accusers she said none my Lord he said neither do I condemn thee go and sin no more he freed her from a guilt he freed her from a accusers he freed her from a past God can free you tonight I don't care what you have done I care where your father did this don't what they have done God could free you tonight who want to be free because who the son of man set free it's free indeed you must be a free Christian God don't want your bong and tied up and you can't praise God and you worship and you can't give God a dance and a shout and a Hallelujah and a praise Oh Glory to God sometime ago I listen to a a Jewish a Jewish priest or what they call him M Jun top of the head

the offense as recalled and annuled some of you don't want to say Amen on that you want to it brother brandham friends there are so many things that we could say tonight about the Perfection we are always trying to G out the eyes out of somebody else to make ourselves a little holier than we are than they are but if we look at the picture it's only God's grace that we are what we are and he give the story here some time ago in Ohio I learned a Len the hard way I was having a meeting he went into a restaurant ordinary restaurant and and a young lady about 18 years old and so on and nice and so on and when I look to my right I heard someone making a big groan and there was an age woman maybe 60 years she had on Old vulgar clothes big makeup across the table sat two men drunk one of them a old army and so on I stood there I said God why don't you destroy the whole thing why don't you just sink it beneath the Earth is my little Sarah and Rebecca going to have to grow up under such stuff like that how can you God in your great Holiness ever stand look at such a thing wow and don't send an earthquake and sink it there a big piece of righteous talk going there that's impressive boy if you take a recording bur them destroy them because I can't stand it is man talking watch this as I was standing there condemning the woman as I was I stepped back behind the door I felt the spirit of God come to me I seen something whing in a vision it was the world went wrong and wrong I noticed around the world a Scarlet streak around the world I seen myself as a little boy doing things I ought not to do and every time I did anything a great black shadow go towards heaven which God could have killed me at that minute then I seen standing between me and God a perfect sacrifice I see him standing there with torns on his side spit hanging on his face and every time my sin would start towards God he'd reach it and catch it like a bumper everything coming up and he catching it he's catching it before it which God he's like pumper he was protecting me from death and every time I do anything wrong God would have killed me his Holiness requires it his Law requires it every time I do anything or you do anything the blood of Jesus Christ act like a bumper as I stood looking I got a little closer to him I noticed him I could hear him say father forgive him he does know what he's doing I looked down and there laid a book and there's a recording Angel there standing by his side and every every time I sin it was put in a book people don't know that it is booked you li it book you steal it booked your fail you're booked it booked don't say Amen it's still booked you feel so like you're feeling I'm still reading it's still booked and my name was in it that another area book that book has his name William brandham you have a is a personalized book every time I sin would put down in a book my name was on it and I realized that someday that blood streak would be lifted and have to stand in the presence of God with my sinful life I seen by his Mercy was holding off my judgment I went to him humbly I knelt on my knees and said oh Jesus thou Son of God I'm unworthy to come in your presence will you please forgive me for what I've done he touched his side with his hand took the old book and wrote hadn't on it threw it back behind him my sins were gone then he looked me still in the face and he said now I have forgiven you and you want to condemn her listen to his word now then I seen what it meant in other words he learned from it he understood what God was saying how could this message ever say the spirit and B say come when they kind treat people in the church right Who coming the only one message people alone the spirit in the body say come let him that hear us say come whosoever will have to come a voice have to say that oh give the Lord some Praises whether they wear in mini skirts whether they smoking whether they're drinking whether they drunk the

shooting at one another he's got an open Target anywhere he wants to shoot what's the use of shooting we are shooting one another so he can sit back and relax no press coming if the Breen fighting one another because the devil is inside the church but when the church finds his brotherly love when the honey begins to stick when the devil have no place no room then he had to go to outside forces to

our Father a prayer should be made in this presence of God say father here's my brother he he he is justly he deserves punishment because he has done me evil I don't see why he did it then let go God go talking to you and you will see maybe what that man has been true the devil has Twisted him up somewhere and caused him to do that though he is absolutely wrong before you leave the Throne of God you'll feel sorry for that man you'll be sympathizing with that brother and when you get back to where Earth again you will go over to that brother and shake his hand cuz you know what he's been through you can't stand with a mortal in the presence of God and condemn anybody did you get that that is why when Isaiah got into God's presence he said whoo is me what presence these ministers are in when they talking the crap behind the pulpit and sewing seed of lies and evil and wickedness causing the people to become so bitter something is wrong the message is divided and broken up because of those men but their time is coming their time is going to be up because the honey look like it won't stick but it's going to stick he said we have to get into the unity of the spirit until we get to the unity of the faith oh give the Lord a shout hallelujah and the unity of the SP Spirit has nothing to do with Doctrine I ain't seen it so I a see it so who need Thunders who nothing Thunders people who talking Thunders talk for years and they have no life shut your mouth and sit down you have no life keep quiet Thunders is the mystery tell another the mystery tell the virtue tell the virtue so what where is the life where is the thunder that shakes the devil the devil Ain taking no talk the devil wants something that is active that is alive that him hard that s him running oh give the Lord some Praises what about a brother has made a mistake do I say he's wrong sometime he's accused wrong when he's not wrong but if he is wrong well if if we will take him to the throne of God start there shoulders over the brother knowing he's a mortal maybe his destination this is big hear this bomb maybe his destination rest upon our attitude towards him his destination I don't know if I'll get to read it but I'm talking about brotherly kindness putting your foot in your brother's shoes on the matter not sitting long judging why you do that why you say that you wearing his shoes suppose his shoes has some tax in it that's sticking him you not wearing that shoes your shoes don't have those hurts he has those hurts in his shoes put on his shoes and you'd walk like him put on his shoes you would fall like him put on his shoes you would fail like him put on his shoes Give the Lord some Praises tonight knowing he's mortal maybe he's this destination rest upon our attitude towards him when we come back from the Throne of God we realize that we are everyone guilty and we all need help one from another and the best way to do is to pray recently I had a breakfast with a bunch of ministers and I say this with respect Brethren I would rather have a breakfast with a bunch of wish doctors now know that's so horrible to say these men I would had a better reception I had a more agreeing spirit with a bunch of wish doctors that's how terrible them Spirits was but I'm saying better with wi doctors because wi doctors in the spirit them have devil Spirit upon abundantly Spirit these guys are dry intellectuals let me read down I had been more a green spirit with a bunch of wi doctors many times than I would with a bunch of ministers such a horrible thing God Deliver Us from such Deliver Us from Evil I just say that we are so intellectual every is moved away from the spirit it's the word it's the word it's the word I'm reading I'm reading it's the Mysteries is the Mysteries is the histories and the Mysteries I'm reading we are so intellectual everything is mov away from the spirit it's the word it's the word is the word I believe in the word but if the spirit don't agree with the word then you got something mixed up somewhere that's why you say the word is truth but the word is a person if the word is not connected to the spirit of Truth what it is Satan must quoting the word it wasn't the spirit truth quoting that it was the Devil Himself quoting Bible hallelujah hallelujah you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free oh praise God let's go one day bam came home and he was talking about the children and his wife and his wife ask her bill give him a licking I said I just ain't got the nve she said if you have to put up at it she slammed the door right in my face and I thought that's all right PA little fellow didn't mean that he said that she didn't mean that I went out to wash my car and when I got out there the Holy Spirit didn't like it now we talking about human now and you're talking about supernatural now this is his wife she asked him to put some licks on the child he say he just couldn't deal with it she walked in she slammed the door normal he said she mean Holy Spirit talking to him now you don't like it go tell her second chronicles 22nd chapter I thought at first I imagined that I kept on watching he said go tell her to read this I went in got the Bible and read it of Miriam the prophet made fun of her brother Moses for marrying an Ethiopian girl and God didn't like that God rebuked them and said this man does I talking lip the air to that man you questioning the wife Mar you like she Mar Ethiopian girl so Miriam broke up with Leprosy all over and Aaron come and told his sister his brother she's dying with Leprosy and Moses run to intercede for her at the altar and when he did the pillar of fire came down and God said go call her and Aon and bring them here Aaron was in it too he said call them and come here he said if there be one among you that is spiritual or a prophet I the Lord will make myself known to him I will speak to him in visions and reveal myself to him by dreams he said but my servant Moses there is no one in the land like him I speak with him lip to air don't you fear God God didn't like it but then I seen that I run in she was in another room I knocked on the door she had shut herself up I told her I wanted to speak to her I went in there talked to her tried to tell her what it was I said sweetheart you know how I love you but God didn't like that you oughtn't to have said that immediately after that she took a trouble in her side we took her to the doctor in Louisville and he found a tumor on her left ovary 15 six year before tum left ovary about the size of a walnut I said what about it doctor he said we'll see what happen bring her back in a few months two months and so we took her back Sor a female specialist and the diagram how big the tumor was and so on but it was testing our faith we constantly prayed the more we prayed the bigger the tumor growed till it got to a place till it was sticking out on our side we kept it quiet few people knew about it finally we come to Canada the Lord lead me to a tribe of Indians to Christ I'm going back to baptizing in the name of the Lord and she said bill I can't even stand my clothes to touch it it was just way out like this on her side her leg was on that side she was hbling along the worst week she had ever she was sitting there she said I'll go tomorrow for an examination I thought oh God if they cut it out they will keep us from going home for Christmas I tell him if he's going to operate we let it go a little longer till after Christmas she got a thinking the day I got to Shri Port which the day after he said she had to go to for examination and the people that come from she was going there a specialist the next morning before I left I was going to get Billy and L they were both in presents and so on I was sking on for so what he begin to pray so I got on to pray I said Lord I miss them this morning around here I said I pray you would help them and bless them may we come back to this place again I said they're out there because you sent me on a vision to fulfill it he said oh God be merciful to her help me in the meeting down here Lord don't let it be malignant let the doctor wait till after the first of the year to take it out I said Lord she didn't mean or he is interceding for his wife he didn't say you see you reap for your soul Mage terrible you look for it he's praying Lord she didn't mean what she did that morning because he know that what is happened to her is connected with her behavior she didn't mean what she did that morning she didn't mean that I said Lord not one time has she ever said a word about me going in the meeting staying months whatever it was not one time and she have opened a mouth about it she has always sent my clothes to the cleaners washed my shirts and had everything ready to go to the meetings then she wonders how she can serve God you woman as you serve your husband you serve God of course and now when I come in all tired and wor out people coming from everywhere I have to go somewhere on a fishing trip hunting trip many woman would have to blow up about that what did she do she got my hunting clothes ready for me to go let me go she says what he said she had to be cut open three times on account of she was cesarian I said Lord I will hate to see her do it again and just then I heard something in the room I looked up and a voice said stand up now whatever you say that's the way it will be I waited a minute I said before the doctor's hand shall touch her the hand of God shall take the tumor away and it won't even be found God tell him speak and whatever you say it shall be I waited a minute I said before the doctor's hand shall touch her the hand of God shall take the tomb away it won't even be found that settled it to me I never called her we went right on went on got Billy L went to sh the next night I called her she was happy she said bill I want to tell you well here she is she can verify this had to hobble away over there went in the room with the nurse and so on she said when the doctor came out she could hardly get on the table the tumor was hanging up there so big and the doctor come in and was talking to her and he came over to raise back the sheet to touch her and just before he touched her it left and the doctor didn't know which side it was on he said wait a minute with the draw diagrams all the pictures he couldn't find one trace of it he examined her over and over he said I might not be able to explain it but Mrs brandham that tumor isn't there what was it before the doctor's hand can touch it one Split Second his hand would have touched it how perfect is the word of the Lord there is my wife we put before God and before doctor's hand could even touch body on the road coming like that something happened the tumor left what was it that was according to the word of God hallelujah that's the fifth time five is a number of Grace there is no doubt in my mind I know what the turd pull is I know what it does now be Reverend keep quiet the hour will soon arrive when God is going to do something great thing for us oh give the Lord a shout hallelujah praise God do you know what that word did that that word brought forgiveness and healing to her oh G that that word brought a pardoning for sister Branham and a healing at the same time this word will bring healing and forgiveness oh give the Lord I shout you are going to be forgiven Oh Glory to God my God I feel good tonight listen listen listen when they brought the man to the roof and they BS up the rof because didn't come through the doores Jesus said I send me forgiv the and they carry on carry on carry on he said which one is e to see pick up and walk is the same thing the forgiveness and healing you can't separate them I could if your sins be forgiven to the then pick the bed and walk Oh Glory to God that man was forgiven and he pick up his bed and he walk oh God I say pick up your bed tonight and walk oh give the Lord I shout in the house oh isn't it excited tonight woo Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah let's go my you wonderful audience tonight I have 14 pages and know the end of 10 so we're going good scripture Mark 11 Jesus answered said unto them have faith in God for very Li un to you I will ask a question is this key connected to the it it is here Jesus giv it third P first that whosoever shall say to his Mountain be moved and be cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he sayth shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he sayth therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire When you pray believe you receive them and he shall have them are he second then come to the first B here but when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father which also in heaven May forgive you of your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father in Heaven forgive your trespasses and the prophet say faith is based on forgiveness so all these guys walking away the ORS have the church in bitterness and anger where they going they're going straight to the tribulation with all the books all the tapes and the person where they going it other words around the world all the bright members have to come to this place of Brotherly kindness because that is the spot where God going to meet with you but more than that this is the virtue that will kill you because people have to do you wrong and even though you know you are right you have to forgive them that Amen in light God is Not testing them you if your corn a get Mash yet if your to match yet somebody coming to mash it play how nice they are tonight wait till tomorrow come wait till next week your your time coming and when they Mash your corn let me see where you act a key unlocks a door you don't lock a door that you don't have things behind serious things behind you only turn the key and lock the door because you have Treasures behind there every door because it's locked because you have something serious inside there isn't that right so the key is the key of faith it takes a hand to hold that word to turn that key is that right but talk about it now let we go almost done here you talk about don't forget now don't try to add it till you're born again when you get down to genuine born again you don't add it adds to you sixthly adding brotherly love brotherly kindness good one the six seven seven adding brotherly kindness all right you

kind to him go anyhow somebody said not long ago how can you believe these things the way you do and still go to the Assemblies of God one is all the rest you see brotherly kindness hoping someday patient with him temper enduring with him knowledge to understand what he believes and it's in his heart virtue in yourself to let it go out with kindness meekness to him having faith that someday God will bring him in brotherly kindness the seventh thing the seven thing next thing at charity which is love that's the C Stone Hallelujah I want you to take it and study it and compare it and act upon it don't just study it but act upon it when you do take it sincerely to yourself don't say I enjoy listening to it there is seven qualifications that make the statue of God there are seven Church ages that God brought the church to disqualification he had seven Messengers to do it they are 777 it's God's number of completion Hallelujah let's add to our faith these things Hallelujah that we might come into the full stature of being joined together with Godly love fear of God reverence in our heart for one another respecting one another brotherly and sisterly kindness never vulgarity nothing
