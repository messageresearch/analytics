[43:22] Kelly south from USA I would also like
[43:24] to extend our thanks to yourself the
[43:26] ministry here and those in The Headstone
[43:28] Tabernacle who put forth such colossal
[43:30] effort to bring about such tremendous
[43:32] convention to that so that all would
[43:34] find near could be blessed strengthened
[43:37] and edified I pray that God would
[43:38] continue renew your strength and the

[43:45] shoulders to the wheel to make the
[43:47] convention possible may God bless you
[43:49] all I also continue to pray for those
[43:51] who travel so far to be a blessing to us
[43:53] even those who are online and especially
[43:55] the religion ministers who give their
[43:57] all we saw it or we will not forget may
[43:59] God continue to strengthen them into a
[44:01] prayer we look forward in seeing you all
[44:03] and so on brother Kelly and sister zaida
[44:05] God bless you thank you brother Kelly
[44:06] and you know
[44:09] it costs a lot to come to Trinidad
[44:12] I'm always from Ivory Coast and South
[44:14] Africa it costs a lot and those
[44:17] Believers and
[44:19] um
[44:20] not just the cost
[44:22] but the
[44:23] time to travel sometimes if you have not
[44:26] been doing from plane to plane traveling
[44:29] overseas it could be such a hard and
[44:31] tedious thing so we supposed to
[44:33] appreciate it they don't have to come
[44:35] here it's something why they come but
[44:37] they don't have to come but we are
[44:38] grateful that they take the time off
[44:40] they have to take time from the jobs
[44:42] that'll make the sacrifices and
[44:44] everything else so it's a lot of time
[44:46] putting it and sometimes it's scary for
[44:48] us hosting because it's such a
[44:51] challenging at times but we we face
[44:54] after the challenge and we that's why we
[44:56] could appreciate your financial
[44:57] contribution
[44:59] um what you have done and your Hulu
[45:00] labored in the Tabernacle to get it
[45:02] right and we're just grateful to God
[45:04] what Ram says is the difference when you
[45:06] have a meeting in a stadium than in a
[45:08] church so we have we are grateful that
[45:10] we could have our own church here people
[45:12] that come and be really blessed amen
[45:14] praise God also another testimony I
[45:19] would like to express a vote of thanks
[45:20] to God for making all things possible
[45:22] for me even when I was not right he
[45:24] still blessed me beyond measure I spoke
[45:26] about over and his wife and I told him
[45:27] of my personal experiences in the past
[45:29] of three years four co-workers died
[45:31] murdered covet cancer suicide younger
[45:33] people and I they showed me it's
[45:35] possible to think you are living a great
[45:37] life good job big accomplishment all for
[45:39] nothing I remember during my prison
[45:42] training the officers would insult me
[45:44] telling me you are fat you can't make it
[45:46] leave you can't do this and while they
[45:49] spoke these things I used to look in the
[45:51] sky above and say I'm going to make it
[45:52] I'm doing this for my family but no my
[45:55] focus has changed when the Devil comes
[45:57] with his insults I'm looking past him
[45:59] just like I was on the ground on
[46:01] training College I'm seeing my family
[46:03] leaving behind this decaying world I'm
[46:05] seeing depression going sickness gone
[46:07] the gift of the Holy Ghost and it is
[46:09] possible if 94 of millionaires were once
[46:12] poor imagine the possibilities of a
[46:14] backslider like me last Sunday brother
[46:16] Raymond Thompson said if it's one
[46:18] question training that I came for if you
[46:21] are sincere come to the prayer line I
[46:24] walk through the prayer line I receive
[46:25] my blessing and went back downstairs all
[46:27] at once the power of God came over me I
[46:30] felt such a Blessed Assurance I knew
[46:32] without the doubt that this was God the
[46:34] experience with God can't be explained I
[46:36] just feel like all my life I didn't
[46:38] really know him not until now giving me
[46:40] a new purpose I apologize to the Saints
[46:43] who was comforting me and held on today
[46:46] and almost like I didn't want to let it
[46:48] go but sister over for a support and
[46:50] prayer from henceforth this child of God
[46:52] is waiting for the new Commission in a
[46:54] life a waiting for the instructions
[46:56] until then I will be reported the duty
[46:58] every day on my knees for where he leads
[47:00] me many many times about over and all
[47:02] the ministers from all over the world
[47:04] your work and struggles are not in vain
[47:06] but Raymond Thompson I am the one person
[47:08] in Trinidad you spoke about sister
[47:10] nicoda praise God Amen God praise amen
[47:14] love him this morning okay all right
[47:20] so this morning we have a special
[47:24] tip that I'd like to share with you this
[47:26] morning I felt like to play this and
[47:28] it's a message from the prophet in his
[47:30] presence not a long message but I want
[47:32] to get something across there and I I
[47:35] got a witness of it so I know that uh we
[47:37] aim for blessing I want to read a
[47:40] scripture from
[47:41] um this is from First Corinthians
[47:43] chapter one we want to read from verse
[47:46] 18. you could you could you could
[47:49] for the preaching of the cross
[47:51] is to them that perish foolishness but
[47:54] unto us which are safe it is the power
[47:57] of God for it is written I will destroy
[47:59] the wisdom of the wines and will bring
[48:01] to nothing the understanding of The
[48:03] Prudent where is the wise where is the
[48:06] Scribe where is the disputer of this
[48:08] world have not God made foolish the
[48:10] wisdom of this world for after that in
[48:12] the wisdom of the word of God the World
[48:14] by wisdom knew not God it pleased God by
[48:18] the foolishness of preaching to save
[48:20] them that believe for the Jews require a
[48:22] sign in the Greek Seeker after wisdom
[48:24] but we preach Christ crucified unto the
[48:27] Jews a stumbling block unto the Greek's
[48:29] foolishness but unto them which are
[48:31] called what Jews and Greeks Christ the
[48:34] power of God and the wisdom of God
[48:36] because the foolishness of God is wiser
[48:38] than men and the weakness of God is
[48:40] stronger than men for you see your
[48:42] calling Brethren how not many wise men
[48:44] after the flesh not many mighty not many
[48:46] noble are called but God had chosen the
[48:50] foolish things of the world to come and
[48:52] from the wise God had chosen the weak
[48:53] things of the world to confront the
[48:55] things that which are Mighty but these
[48:57] things of the world are the things that
[48:58] are despised that God chosen ye and
[49:01] things which are not to con to bring to
[49:03] note the things that are that no flesh
[49:07] should glory in his presence that's the
[49:11] part of universities that no flesh could
[49:13] glory in his presence and yet find out
[49:16] that brother Branham actually described
[49:18] about being in his presence and what
[49:21] that does and the effect of being his
[49:23] presence so I want to have what I call
[49:25] it notes for this for this Tiffany in
[49:28] his presence all right brother Brown
[49:30] this a man now listen this service is
[49:34] very important doesn't matter if it's
[49:35] two people here this morning
[49:37] I want you to take it to heart
[49:39] this is very very important for the
[49:41] brand there's some seeds you put in here
[49:43] now we believe that the hour has come
[49:46] that Saint John 14 12 must be fulfilled
[49:49] we believe that Malachi form must be
[49:51] fulfilled we believe that Luke 7 must be
[49:54] fulfilled we believe all these
[49:55] prophecies
[49:57] stop running
[49:58] don't get out of his presence
[50:01] just move up into his presence that's
[50:03] right I know that's what you're Desiring
[50:06] to do because I see licensing out there
[50:08] from Texas and Louisiana everywhere it's
[50:10] not to run from his presence but to run
[50:13] into his presence and sometimes we don't
[50:15] want to go into his presence because we
[50:17] feel God will tell us no
[50:19] and God will tell us not with that way
[50:21] to go so we don't want to hear from God
[50:23] because you know God will tell you
[50:25] different to your own thoughts and ideas
[50:26] but we are challenged this morning to
[50:28] move up
[50:29] into his presence
[50:31] get on the ship with us tonight we are
[50:34] going down to tashes to cry out the
[50:36] Nineveh to cry out we are letting the
[50:37] township to go on down if they want to
[50:39] we have got a duty to be to God and a
[50:42] message to be responsible for so that's
[50:44] not run away from his presence now
[50:45] remember in the Old Testament was debt
[50:47] to go in oh it's debt to be outside
[50:49] let's continue
[50:52] to HH as Daniel heard the seven Thunders
[50:55] and forbidden on John heard the voices
[50:57] and this book was sealed on the back of
[51:00] the book was seen with Seven Seals but
[51:01] in the days of these Series in May known
[51:03] here we go the mystery of God would be
[51:06] finished in other words God would be
[51:10] known in his church not in three people
[51:12] but as one person the mystery of God
[51:15] will be revealed so people talk about
[51:16] Revelation and Mysteries and you unfold
[51:19] of the word but listen to this the
[51:21] mystery of God will be revealed and when
[51:25] that was completely revealed then the
[51:28] seven Mysteries will open to the church
[51:30] and he's talking about the seven issues
[51:32] on the back of the book which is seven
[51:33] Thunders because India India after all
[51:38] the messages revealed in there the
[51:40] church would be living prophecy under
[51:43] the inspiration of the Holy Spirit him
[51:46] moving in and out and showing his signs
[51:49] of being alive among us living among us
[51:52] and then we are worshiping the living
[51:53] Christ that's Among Us it have no man
[51:56] there it have no fivefold there it'd
[51:58] have no Apostle there it'll have no
[52:00] Prophet there it'll have no Pastor there
[52:02] it'll have no Bishop there it'll have
[52:03] him moving in and out okay the Lords and
[52:06] praises
[52:07] so when you come to church what must be
[52:09] your expectation your expectation is for
[52:11] him
[52:12] come in Among Us he could come in this
[52:15] morning
[52:17] Among Us confirming the word with signs
[52:20] then we are worshiping the living Christ
[52:22] that's Among Us so you're not lifting
[52:25] your hands up and you don't know what
[52:26] you're worshiping dear said we know what
[52:28] we worship the father seeketh such a
[52:30] worship in in spirit and in truth
[52:32] hallelujah let's continue
[52:36] father but Abraham condemnation by
[52:38] representation so it is now at the near
[52:40] coming of Jesus again just like the vine
[52:42] if the vine puts forth a branch and that
[52:44] Branch was a Pentecostal Branch filled
[52:46] with the Holy Ghost signs and wonders
[52:48] and fruits follow that Branch if that
[52:50] vine ever put forth another Branch it'll
[52:52] be the same kind of Branch we know that
[52:54] father by Nature itself and we do know
[52:56] that you can graft any fruit that's
[52:58] pertained to that vine it will live by
[53:00] the vine we know we can take orange tree
[53:02] and grow Citrus of different kinds seven
[53:04] eighths and put lemons in it but we
[53:06] believe what if that tree brings forth
[53:09] its own Branch again it will be an
[53:11] orange Lord it will be like the first
[53:13] one was and then he prophesy and we
[53:16] believe that there is to be a church in
[53:18] these last days that will receive both
[53:20] former and later in it will be scattered
[53:22] throughout the world in this loud recent
[53:24] age it will be a church that's called
[53:26] back to the original faith in God that's
[53:29] why we have contending for the faith it
[53:31] will be a church that's called back to
[53:33] the original Faith Of God it will be a
[53:35] church that will have Jesus us walking
[53:37] in it
[53:38] manifesting himself the shout of the
[53:42] king will be in it not not that church
[53:44] not no formal church not no message
[53:46] church but the church where Jesus
[53:48] walking in it and the shout of the king
[53:52] will be in it oh praise God praise God
[53:55] are you with me this morning a blushing
[53:58] Prophet but a mom says he says
[54:01] but when you see a servant of God get so
[54:04] sincere till he's on his face with his
[54:06] hands in the air praying to God and
[54:09] blushing because of the iniquity of the
[54:11] people then you're going to see a
[54:13] Revival start a man here it is a man a
[54:16] cannot lay in the presence of God
[54:19] then he switches a church cannot lay in
[54:22] the presence of God under repentance
[54:24] unless the Holy Spirit comes down and
[54:27] give unction and power to start a move
[54:31] of God in dear among the people it just
[54:34] got to be could we say Amen then he says
[54:37] show me a man you write it with me this
[54:39] morning

[54:42] Knox finny Sankey any of those who feels
[54:44] the burden of the people that will lay
[54:46] on their face and cry and pray before
[54:48] God send us another John Smith of the
[54:51] Baptist Church again who prayed all
[54:52] night for the iniquity of the people
[54:54] until his eyes would be swell shut next
[54:56] morning from weeping till his wife would
[54:58] lead him to the table and feed him with
[55:00] his breakfast out of a spoon show me a
[55:03] John Wesley a fireman snatch on the fire

[1:03:00] Jesus hear what the unjust judge said
[1:03:03] shall not God avenge his elect who cried
[1:03:06] day at night okay the Lord some Praises
[1:03:09] so if you want to sit and stare you sit
[1:03:11] and steal but there's going to the
[1:03:13] kingdom of God has preached and every
[1:03:15] man entitled to it that the Bible they
[1:03:19] pressuring into it oh glory to God final
[1:03:23] quote I'll be gonna go straight into the
[1:03:25] tape
[1:03:27] and hold on to your seat don't let no if
[1:03:29] yeah they got two people
[1:03:33] this morning make sure you receive this
[1:03:36] message there's something in it this is
[1:03:38] more than the anointing and the
[1:03:39] atmosphere this is his presence and the
[1:03:42] effect of his presence upon your life
[1:03:43] the Chief already go into his presence
[1:03:46] he said I believe that's quote I will go
[1:03:49] straight into the tape I believe the
[1:03:51] church is beginning to hear the message
[1:03:54] and beginning to understand it
[1:03:57] so that's not the question
[1:03:59] but friend listen we have got to lay in
[1:04:03] the presence of the sun we have got to
[1:04:06] be ripened our faith isn't ripe
[1:04:10] intellectually we hear in a message that
[1:04:12] God has given us seeing the signs he
[1:04:14] showed us proving that by the Bible it
[1:04:16] is there how the church needs to lay in
[1:04:20] his presence till it tenders up you know
[1:04:22] and gets sweet in the spirit so it can
[1:04:25] be done
[1:04:26] you're talking about you in a robe of
[1:04:28] his presence
[1:04:30] you become a sweet Christian you see
[1:04:32] this sour lemon lime behavior that you
[1:04:34] have now
[1:04:35] when that sweetness come over you and
[1:04:38] the sweetness is evidence you're about
[1:04:40] to give birth because when a woman is
[1:04:42] pregnant coming to the nine months a
[1:04:44] sweet Spirit comes over her because
[1:04:46] she's a proud to produce life
[1:04:48] so the sweetness is just the sweetness
[1:04:49] in a vague sense sweetness is also
[1:04:52] evidence that you're coming to full term
[1:04:55] and you're about to bring forth that man
[1:04:56] child even Christ Jesus the Holy Ghost
[1:04:59] itself okay the Lord some Praises
[1:05:01] hallelujah how the church needs to lay
[1:05:03] in his presence till it tenders up you
[1:05:06] know and gets sweet in the spirit so it
[1:05:08] can be done sometime in speaking a
[1:05:10] message you get harsh you have to break
[1:05:12] it like that because you have to cleanse
[1:05:14] your nail to make it whole but once the
[1:05:16] church gets it and I hope it gets it
[1:05:18] this morning one that just gets it the
[1:05:21] elected is called out and separate them
[1:05:24] in the presence of God
[1:05:27] I know it will be something like that
[1:05:30] people was there when it takes the
[1:05:31] Rapture may God bless you and they go
[1:05:33] straight into the tape blessed be the
[1:05:35] name of the Lord it is in his presence
[1:05:37] and I want you to listen and please
[1:05:39] close attention amen prison
[1:05:48] thank you now Lord bless you real richly
[1:05:51] good evening friends it's a grand
[1:05:55] privilege to be back here in this
[1:05:57] building again tonight
[1:05:59] and feeling the never failing presence
[1:06:03] of Our Lord as these give the promise
[1:06:06] and now I know that many of you have
[1:06:08] stayed over for the little message
[1:06:10] tonight which I am very thankful and
[1:06:12] many of you has to drive far yet tonight
[1:06:15] to get home
[1:06:16] some are checked out of your motels as I
[1:06:19] understand
[1:06:20] and we are going to try not to hold you
[1:06:23] long so that's reason we come in early
[1:06:25] so we could get away early and now we
[1:06:29] will just as soon as I can I will
[1:06:32] announce when we are going to maybe
[1:06:34] start uh I've had some calls this
[1:06:37] afternoon the only one we was going to
[1:06:38] start on these books are this uh
[1:06:42] chapters and I think if the Lord willing
[1:06:44] I want to take the next time that we
[1:06:47] start on the Seven Seals of Revelations
[1:06:50] and the Seven Natural seals and then if
[1:06:54] we get to in time take the Seven Seals
[1:06:57] on the back of the book see now that may
[1:07:00] take a little time
[1:07:02] uh see there's Seven Seals it's open the
[1:07:05] seven plague seven trumpets all those
[1:07:07] sevens and them seals we could take
[1:07:09] first but then on the back of the book
[1:07:12] is sealed with Seven Seals Daniel heard
[1:07:16] the voices the Thunders and was
[1:07:17] forbidden to write it John was forbidden
[1:07:20] to write it but it was sealed on the
[1:07:22] back side of the book that is after all
[1:07:26] of the Mysteries of the book has been
[1:07:28] given out and revealed you know as
[1:07:31] Daniel said there the Mysteries and the
[1:07:33] days of these voices the mystery of God
[1:07:37] should be unfolded by that time see the
[1:07:41] mystery who God is high was made flesh
[1:07:44] all these things should be unfolded by
[1:07:47] that time and then then we're ready for
[1:07:50] the Seven Seals
[1:07:52] on the back side of the book that's not
[1:07:56] even revealed to man not even wrote in
[1:07:58] the Bible
[1:07:59] but they'll have to be just exactly
[1:08:01] compare with the rest of the Bible and
[1:08:04] I'll think it'll be a great thing
[1:08:06] so now um uh we're going to try to hurry
[1:08:11] to get through thank everyone of you for
[1:08:14] your kindness and your presence and and
[1:08:17] all that you have done we thank you very
[1:08:19] much and now I I'm trusting that we
[1:08:23] won't keep you too long tonight because
[1:08:25] you're so patient to sit stand my wife
[1:08:29] said back there she's talking about last
[1:08:32] night she said I've seen women that were
[1:08:34] even rather heavy set standing there in
[1:08:37] their clothes ringing wet so they are
[1:08:40] just grasping every word that's reason I
[1:08:44] like to stay under the anointing of the
[1:08:45] Holy Ghost that when you come out you're
[1:08:47] telling them people the honest truth I
[1:08:50] think they're just nothing but the truth
[1:08:53] and then they can lay on to that and
[1:08:56] it'll be all right now
[1:08:59] uh I want to ask your apologies for a
[1:09:02] few moments I left a little early this
[1:09:05] morning and the tapes are turned off at
[1:09:08] this time and uh
[1:09:10] um just in a moment um tell the
[1:09:12] recorders when I turn the tape on I want
[1:09:15] to finish the countdown five minutes uh
[1:09:19] apart uh before I leave I forgot and
[1:09:22] went away I was just so carried away

[1:09:26] saying anything about it but I kind of
[1:09:28] left you what was the countdown see I
[1:09:31] know we're in the countdown but what is
[1:09:34] the countdown see if you don't know what

[1:09:38] confused and so I I'd like to to bring

[1:11:20] days of or three times of service
[1:11:24] I would that if anyone listens to this
[1:11:27] tape that they would like to get back

[1:11:32] it's in your home it's the the present
[1:11:37] stage of the ministry that the Lord has
[1:11:40] given me especially I like for ministers
[1:11:42] to hear that before I visit their
[1:11:45] churches and come in their homes now
[1:11:49] I'd like from the to get that now this
[1:11:52] morning we spoke on the subject of the
[1:11:54] countdown
[1:11:56] the church ready to leave and now
[1:11:59] tonight God willing we're speaking on
[1:12:02] the subject of in his presence
[1:12:05] oh how we thank God for the privilege
[1:12:08] that we can come into His presence the
[1:12:10] first I wish you all to turn in your
[1:12:12] Bibles with me to the prophet Isaiah the
[1:12:17] sixth chapter of the prophet Isaiah we
[1:12:21] all know that Isaiah was a major prophet
[1:12:24] and one of the great prophets of his day
[1:12:28] he ended his life for being sought
[1:12:30] asunder with Sauls
[1:12:33] for our testimony as a martyr to the
[1:12:36] power of almighty God
[1:12:38] in the book of Isaiah the sixth chapter
[1:12:41] I begin at the fifth verse 3.
[1:12:47] then said I
[1:12:49] woe is me
[1:12:51] or maybe I start with the first verse
[1:12:54] let's pardon me a moment let's start at
[1:12:56] the first verse and read down until
[1:12:58] about the eighth verse
[1:13:00] in the year the king azekiah died I saw
[1:13:05] also the Lord setting up on a throne
[1:13:08] high and lifted up
[1:13:11] in his train fill the temple above it
[1:13:15] stood the serpents each one having six
[1:13:18] wings
[1:13:20] between he covered his face
[1:13:24] and between he covered his feet and with
[1:13:27] Twain he didn't fly
[1:13:29] and one Cried unto another and said holy
[1:13:35] holy holy is the Lord God of hosts and
[1:13:40] the whole earth is full of his glory
[1:13:44] I am the host of the door moved at the
[1:13:48] voice of him that cried and the house
[1:13:52] was filled with smoke
[1:13:54] then said I woe is me for I am undone
[1:13:59] because I am a man of unclean lives and
[1:14:03] I dwell in the midst of people of
[1:14:06] unclean lips for in our eyes have seen
[1:14:09] the king the Lord of hosts
[1:14:13] then flew one of this therapy unto me
[1:14:16] having a live coal in his hand which he
[1:14:20] had taken with the thongs from off the
[1:14:23] altar
[1:14:24] and he laid it up on my mouth and said
[1:14:28] Lord this has touched thy lips
[1:14:31] thine iniquity
[1:14:34] is taken away and our sin is purged
[1:14:38] also I heard the voice of the Lord
[1:14:41] saying who shall I send and who will go
[1:14:45] for us then said I here I am
[1:14:49] send me
[1:14:53] may the Lord bless his word
[1:14:56] I think that's the most striking
[1:15:00] scripture
[1:15:02] we find
[1:15:05] that in the presence of God
[1:15:09] man recognized themselves to be sinners
[1:15:14] we may feel pretty good
[1:15:16] when we're out different places and feel
[1:15:18] like that we're pretty good people
[1:15:21] but when we ever come into the presence
[1:15:23] of God then we see how little we are
[1:15:27] [Music]
[1:15:29] standing out long ago with a A friend of
[1:15:32] mine
[1:15:33] that I had the privilege of leading to
[1:15:36] Christ
[1:15:37] Bert call
[1:15:38] up in New Hampshire a hunting partner
[1:15:41] we're standing by Colebrook Falls up in
[1:15:44] the Adirondack
[1:15:46] and it was such a mammoth big Falls I've
[1:15:49] taken my family last year up there to
[1:15:50] look at it way back off the road you
[1:15:53] have to hike back to get to it
[1:15:55] and when we seen that blue green water
[1:15:58] pouring with such a mighty power out of
[1:16:01] the mountains and gushing down over the
[1:16:03] Rocks virgin stood down to me and he
[1:16:06] said Gee Billy it makes the man feel
[1:16:09] just so little he measured about a
[1:16:11] quarter of an inch on his fingers
[1:16:13] I said that's right Bert now that was
[1:16:16] all he knowed of getting into the
[1:16:18] presence of God to see his creation
[1:16:21] a winner of the man who wrote How Great
[1:16:24] Thou Art if he didn't look up one night
[1:16:27] look at the stars how far they are away
[1:16:31] a few months ago brother Fred
[1:16:34] brother woods and I was standing with
[1:16:36] brother mcinally out in the Arizona
[1:16:38] desert we was measuring giant one star
[1:16:41] how close it was to the other
[1:16:44] and with the millions and billions of
[1:16:47] miles away they didn't look over a
[1:16:50] quarter of an inch from each other
[1:16:52] then we begin to think according to
[1:16:54] scientific proof of that those stars are
[1:16:57] probably farther away from each other
[1:17:00] than we are from now
[1:17:02] see how it is then we realize how little
[1:17:05] we are when we realize how great he is
[1:17:08] and how close we come in of coming to
[1:17:12] his presence
[1:17:14] somehow another it's always stroke a
[1:17:18] great effect upon people they're coming
[1:17:21] to the presence of God
[1:17:23] I've seen the time in my Ministry when
[1:17:27] you see the presence of God come into
[1:17:30] such a place that it would bring a
[1:17:33] person up and just reveal the life to
[1:17:36] them and call out their sins of all
[1:17:40] kinds of immoral Acts and it brings such
[1:17:43] a holy hush amongst the people until
[1:17:46] they drop out of the prayer line before
[1:17:49] they ever come up to be prayed for and
[1:17:51] run to the altar get right with God
[1:17:53] before they come up into his presence
[1:17:56] there's something about coming into the
[1:18:00] presence of God
[1:18:02] it causes things to happen
[1:18:04] I've seen people laying eggs constant
[1:18:08] stretchers that night down there at
[1:18:10] Mexico when that little dead baby laying
[1:18:13] under a blanket that's a little Spanish
[1:18:16] mother brought up a little Mexican
[1:18:18] mother rather brought up
[1:18:21] when they sing
[1:18:23] several thousands of those people saw
[1:18:27] maybe 50 or 75 000 at one Gathering
[1:18:31] solve that little dead baby come to life
[1:18:35] winning faded people threw up their
[1:18:38] hands and screamed
[1:18:39] why they realize that a human being
[1:18:43] could not do that and that they were in
[1:18:46] the presence of almighty God and it
[1:18:49] caused something to happen
[1:18:52] I've been privileged to hear godly man
[1:18:54] speak
[1:18:56] it was said one time of Charles spinning
[1:18:59] little bitty fella never weighed over
[1:19:01] about 110 pounds but he had such a
[1:19:04] forceful way of speaking until he was
[1:19:07] trying the Acoustics one day in a
[1:19:09] building they didn't have PA systems
[1:19:12] then and there was a man repairing up in
[1:19:16] the balcony or up in the roof of the
[1:19:18] place and he heard the man come in so he
[1:19:21] didn't know who they were he just kept
[1:19:23] quiet Mr Feeney was going to try the
[1:19:26] Acoustics after spending much time in
[1:19:29] prayer for that Revival that he's going
[1:19:31] to hold he tried his voice the sea I
[1:19:34] would carry he slipped up quickly to the
[1:19:37] pulpin and said repent or perish and he
[1:19:40] said it was such fourth Force after
[1:19:42] being or they don't need God till the
[1:19:44] man dropped out of the top of the
[1:19:46] balcony down onto the floor out of the
[1:19:48] top of the building onto the floor
[1:19:51] he preached the gospel in such way till
[1:19:53] he stood and Boston Massachusetts and a
[1:19:56] little bay window that causes no church
[1:19:58] could hold his cloud and he stood there
[1:20:01] with such Mighty force and preached held
[1:20:04] such a place onto a working man with
[1:20:07] their baskets under their arms fell into
[1:20:09] the street and screamed for mercy yeah
[1:20:12] you're the presence of God
[1:20:14] great preachers who's been able by the
[1:20:17] word of God to bring the presence of God
[1:20:20] to an audience
[1:20:21] all this that man would ever be so
[1:20:24] seared in their hearts so they could
[1:20:26] never recognize the presence of God
[1:20:30] when the first man as soon as he had
[1:20:33] sinned and done something wrong and when
[1:20:37] God came into his presence or he came
[1:20:39] into the presence of God Adam he could
[1:20:42] not stand in the presence of God Amen he
[1:20:46] run and hid himself in the bush and
[1:20:48] tried to cover himself with a fig Leaf
[1:20:50] because he knowed he was standing In The
[1:20:53] Presence of Jehovah the Creator
[1:20:55] that was the reaction of the first man
[1:20:59] after he had sinned and tried to come
[1:21:01] into the presence of God with sent upon
[1:21:04] his soul he could not hide because he
[1:21:07] was tendering
[1:21:09] sin and I took a hole like it has rooted
[1:21:11] into people's hearts today but he was
[1:21:14] very conscious that he was standing
[1:21:16] before his creator
[1:21:19] now he hid himself in the bushes and
[1:21:22] would not have come out and could not
[1:21:24] come out until God had made a
[1:21:26] preparation for him
[1:21:28] we could go back and take in Genesis the
[1:21:32] 17th chapter and the third verse when
[1:21:35] the Great patriarch Abraham
[1:21:38] when he came into the presence of God
[1:21:40] and God spoke to him in the 17th chapter
[1:21:43] in the name of almighty God Abraham fell
[1:21:46] on his face
[1:21:49] the great patriarch
[1:21:51] servant of God could not stand in the
[1:21:54] presence of God though I had served him
[1:21:56] for 25 years Faithfully but when God
[1:22:00] moved into his presence the patriarch
[1:22:02] fell on his face because he couldn't
[1:22:04] stand in the presence of God
[1:22:07] in Exodus 3 we find that Moses the great
[1:22:11] servant and prophet of God
[1:22:14] when he was back on the back side of the
[1:22:16] desert that man was a holy man he had
[1:22:20] been born for the purpose he was born
[1:22:22] from his mother's wombs to be a prophet
[1:22:25] he had tried to get his education and do
[1:22:28] everything he could to deliver his
[1:22:30] people because he understood that he was
[1:22:32] to deliver his people but when he
[1:22:35] understood it by a theological
[1:22:37] standpoint he was trained he was well
[1:22:41] scholar he could teach the Egyptians
[1:22:44] wisdom which was the most smartest
[1:22:46] people in the world he known all the ins
[1:22:48] and outs he knowed the scripture from A
[1:22:51] to Z he knows the promises that God had
[1:22:53] made he noted from an intellectual
[1:22:55] standpoint and he was a a great military
[1:22:58] man but one day on the back side of the
[1:23:02] desert when he come into the presence of
[1:23:04] God he jerked off his shoes and fell to
[1:23:06] his feet knowing that he was on Holy
[1:23:08] Ground
[1:23:09] ever he could not stand upon his feet
[1:23:12] when he come in the presence of God he
[1:23:15] fell to his face like Abraham did he
[1:23:18] could not stand in the presence of God
[1:23:20] in Exodus 19 19 when the chosen people
[1:23:24] of God sent the way back in the days of
[1:23:28] Abraham from Abraham come Isaac Isaac
[1:23:31] come Jacob by Jacob come the Patriarchs
[1:23:33] and years after years that developed
[1:23:36] holy man great man a chosen people a
[1:23:40] chosen race a Sanctified holy people and
[1:23:44] served God their life and one day God
[1:23:47] said Gather Israel out here I'm going to
[1:23:50] speak to them but when God came down on
[1:23:54] top of Mount Sinai amen
[1:23:57] and the whole Mountain caught a fire and
[1:24:01] the smoke was dying from the lack of
[1:24:03] furnace and the voice of God Gloria
[1:24:06] Israel fell on their faces and let Moses
[1:24:09] speak and not God lest we die
[1:24:12] man in the presence of God realizes he's
[1:24:16] a sinner yet they were everyone
[1:24:19] circumcised according to the law they
[1:24:22] had carried the Commandments and
[1:24:23] everything but when God spoke and they
[1:24:25] moved up into his presence they realized
[1:24:28] that they were out they were they were
[1:24:30] not right there was something that was
[1:24:33] lacking because they were in the
[1:24:35] presence of God
[1:24:37] yes and they said let Moses speak and
[1:24:41] not God for God speaks will all die
[1:24:45] let Moses speak to us it was in Luke 5 8
[1:24:50] that when Peter
[1:24:52] oh when he is a great stubborn man and a
[1:24:57] man of great influence great power that
[1:25:00] we understand he was like a bullying
[1:25:04] adulted fisherman but when he saw the
[1:25:08] miracle of God performed by an ordinary
[1:25:10] Man look like
[1:25:12] which he recognized at that time that
[1:25:14] that taken more than a man to throw all
[1:25:17] that fish in a net where he with all of
[1:25:19] his education his knowledge efficient
[1:25:21] had fished all night not even taken a
[1:25:24] thing but he heard someone say cast your
[1:25:27] net in and when he began to pull he had
[1:25:30] a great multitude of fishes
[1:25:33] and he realized that he was a sinful man
[1:25:36] and he said depart from the O Lord for I
[1:25:39] am a sinful man who said that Saint
[1:25:43] Peter
[1:25:45] and the presence of God asked for God to
[1:25:49] depart out of his presence because he
[1:25:51] recognized himself a sinner
[1:25:54] Abraham recognized himself wrong
[1:25:58] recognized himself wrong which was the
[1:26:00] son of God recognized himself wrong
[1:26:04] Moses recognized himself from Israel as
[1:26:07] a church and Nation recognize themselves
[1:26:09] wrong
[1:26:11] depart from me for I am a sinful man he
[1:26:16] didn't try to say now I'm holy and
[1:26:17] worthy to receive this he said I am a
[1:26:20] sinful man one time a self-style
[1:26:23] religionist with all the theology they
[1:26:26] can learn under a great teacher called
[1:26:28] romelia his name is Saul of Tarsus which
[1:26:31] we know as Paul
[1:26:32] religious synonym
[1:26:35] you know all the ins and out of their
[1:26:37] religion he was a Pharisee of the
[1:26:39] Pharisee in a Hebrew of the Hebrews
[1:26:41] he was a noted man a scholar smart
[1:26:45] shrewd educated painted old God from
[1:26:49] vadia one day on his road down to
[1:26:52] Damascus
[1:26:56] any felonies off of his feet to the
[1:26:59] ground in the dust and said Lord what
[1:27:01] would you have me to do
[1:27:03] all these great training all these great
[1:27:06] theological training all of his
[1:27:08] education didn't mean a thing when he
[1:27:10] stood in the presence of God I like to
[1:27:13] stop you and it didn't say that's the
[1:27:15] same thing you might have dollar DD PhD
[1:27:18] whatever you might be you might have
[1:27:20] went to church since you was a child you
[1:27:22] might have done all the religious acts
[1:27:24] there is but once in the presence of God
[1:27:26] pain you feel so little and no count
[1:27:32] realized that he was wrong and he fell
[1:27:36] to the ground
[1:27:37] under the influence and power when he
[1:27:41] looked up and seen the very God that he
[1:27:43] had been preaching and against Authority
[1:27:45] note and seen that he was wrong he fell
[1:27:48] from his feet to the ground because he
[1:27:51] was in the presence of God he's seen
[1:27:53] that Pillar of Fire what about the great
[1:27:57] Saint John of Revelations 1 7.
[1:28:01] when he was show division I looked I
[1:28:04] heard a voice speaking to him and he
[1:28:07] turned to look to see the voice and he
[1:28:09] saw seven golden candlesticks and one
[1:28:12] stood in the midst of the seven golden
[1:28:13] candlesticks with hair like wool eyes
[1:28:17] like flames of fire feet like pillars of
[1:28:19] rest he was girded with the golden girl
[1:28:22] around the past and he was called the
[1:28:25] word of God and when the Great Saint
[1:28:27] John oh
[1:28:30] had walked with Christ
[1:28:32] leaned upon his bosomes when he done all
[1:28:35] these things that God said this morning
[1:28:38] Paul's Ministry exceeded alien year
[1:28:40] after John had walked with Jesus talked
[1:28:44] with him slept with him eat with him but
[1:28:46] when he's seen him standing there that
[1:28:48] glorified State he said he fell like a
[1:28:51] dead man
[1:28:55] think of it
[1:28:58] we could come to church and talk and
[1:29:01] praise God and so forth but a whole
[1:29:03] brother when we see him coming
[1:29:07] something will be different in our
[1:29:09] hearts
[1:29:10] we might think we do our religious duty
[1:29:12] but go to church and pay our tithing we
[1:29:14] might think that we keep the laws of the
[1:29:17] churches recite all the Creeds but once
[1:29:19] let us get a look at him the whole
[1:29:21] things changed all the way around
[1:29:25] [Music]
[1:29:26] yes sure this great man Saint John
[1:29:30] a great man like that the Bible said in
[1:29:34] Revelations 1 7 that he fell as if he
[1:29:37] was a dead man
[1:29:40] after a three and a half years of
[1:29:42] fellowship with Christ
[1:29:44] was one of the writers of the Epistles
[1:29:46] rolled behind him eat with him at the
[1:29:49] table slept with him at the bed and
[1:29:52] fellowship with him forever he went but
[1:29:54] when he's turned to see him he had no
[1:29:57] more life left in him he fell like a
[1:30:00] dead man to the floor or to the ground
[1:30:03] all right we see Isaiah in Isaiah 6 and
[1:30:08] 5 as we've just ran
[1:30:11] this Great Mighty prophet
[1:30:14] he's one of the greatest prophets there
[1:30:16] is in the Bible
[1:30:18] there are 66 books of the Bible there's
[1:30:21] 66 chapters in Isaiah Isaiah starts off
[1:30:24] in Genesis the middle of Isaiah he
[1:30:27] brings to the New Testament at the end
[1:30:29] of Isaiah he brings in the millennium
[1:30:31] just exactly Genesis the New Testament
[1:30:34] and Revelations
[1:30:35] Percy Isaiah was one of the Major
[1:30:38] Prophets
[1:30:39] but one day he had been leaning upon the
[1:30:42] arm of Hezekiah the great king is the
[1:30:46] kind of been taken from him and he was
[1:30:48] down he was a pretty good fella he's a
[1:30:50] good righteous man if that righteous
[1:30:53] King a good King recognized him as a
[1:30:56] holy man and kept him in his Temple
[1:30:59] Isaiah saw Visions he was a prophet
[1:31:02] Isaiah preached the word he was a
[1:31:05] minister Isaiah was a holy man but one
[1:31:08] day
[1:31:11] he fell into a trance and he saw the
[1:31:14] glory of God he saw the angels with
[1:31:17] wings over their face Wings over their
[1:31:21] feet fine with wings crying holy holy
[1:31:24] holy is the Lord God on my head
[1:31:28] that Prophet realized he was nothing
[1:31:32] he said woe is me for I am a man of
[1:31:35] unclean lips a prophet
[1:31:38] a mightiest prophet of the Bible one of
[1:31:40] them I am a man with unclean lips and I
[1:31:44] dwell among people it's unclean lips woe
[1:31:47] is me because I see the glory of God and
[1:31:50] he said when that angel cried the post
[1:31:52] of the temple Shook Back and Forth
[1:31:56] brother help us I will make you not only
[1:31:59] as opposed to the temple go to shake but
[1:32:01] the whole heavens and Earths go to shape
[1:32:04] the mountains of flea and the seal fade
[1:32:08] away and Extreme Hide us from the face
[1:32:10] of him that sets upon the throne
[1:32:14] it's going to be a terrible time I'll
[1:32:15] tell you Senator Fran you better be
[1:32:17] checked it up
[1:32:19] that's right now Isaiah said we'll
[1:32:22] always be I'm a man of unclean lips I'll
[1:32:26] dwell among unclean people and I'm these
[1:32:29] people as unclean Lids now remember if
[1:32:32] such holy man
[1:32:35] recognize themselves sinners in the
[1:32:38] presence of God what will the Sinner and
[1:32:42] ungodly do at that day
[1:32:46] what will people do who set in the
[1:32:49] meetings
[1:32:51] what will the people do that's seen the
[1:32:54] power of God that's heard the countdown
[1:32:57] on the word
[1:32:58] that scene God manifest himself and
[1:33:01] Beyond a shadowed doubt ever scripture
[1:33:03] fulfilled
[1:33:05] and will still try to make it to heaven
[1:33:08] without being born again and received
[1:33:10] the Holy Ghost
[1:33:12] the Bible said if a righteous man be
[1:33:14] scarcely saved where will the Sinner and
[1:33:16] ungodly appear
[1:33:18] what kind of a place are we going to
[1:33:20] stand in
[1:33:22] if we see God unfold
[1:33:25] [Applause]
[1:33:27] amen then and that kind of man cried a
[1:33:30] prophets and Sages
[1:33:33] upon whom the word is based upon if they
[1:33:36] cried and fell to their feet and
[1:33:39] screamed on a man of Unholy lips
[1:33:41] uncleanness
[1:33:43] what will it be then for that man who
[1:33:46] won't even confess his sins
[1:33:48] what will it be for that teenager that
[1:33:51] won't confess his or her sins
[1:33:54] why would it be for that hard-hearted
[1:33:56] man that thinks he knows more about uh
[1:33:58] God's creation God does himself
[1:34:01] why do I have for that man spent all of
[1:34:02] his life trying to disprove the Bible
[1:34:05] where will that God appear at
[1:34:07] think of it
[1:34:10] this is evangelism
[1:34:12] this is a time to shake people
[1:34:14] this is the time that God said there
[1:34:17] come a time he's shut Mount Sinai one
[1:34:19] time but there come is shaken again that
[1:34:21] he will only Shake Mount Sania but he'd
[1:34:24] Shake everything that could be moved
[1:34:27] but did you notice the rest of scripture
[1:34:29] but we receive a kingdom that cannot be
[1:34:35] Hallelujah
[1:34:36] everything that can be shocked will be
[1:34:38] shaken
[1:34:39] the heavens are safe the Earth will
[1:34:42] shake heavens and earth will pass away
[1:34:44] but that word shall never pass away for
[1:34:48] all this rock I'll build my church and
[1:34:50] the Gates of Hell will never be
[1:34:54] everything that can be shook will be
[1:34:56] shaken but we receive a kingdom which is
[1:35:00] a word of God himself and God is his
[1:35:02] word he don't shake himself
[1:35:07] oh my but we receive a kingdom that
[1:35:10] cannot be moved
[1:35:12] it's unshakable said Paul the Hebrew
[1:35:15] writer such a person and such a man such
[1:35:19] a time and how they felt we have also
[1:35:23] ourselves we've seen the glory of God
[1:35:25] like this man did
[1:35:27] sir
[1:35:28] we've seen him we've seen the glory of
[1:35:31] God like Abraham saw it we saw the glory
[1:35:34] of God like Moses saw him same Pillar of
[1:35:37] Fire the same power of God the same
[1:35:41] Christ on revealing himself showing
[1:35:43] himself keeping his word in the last day
[1:35:46] how can we come by then him walk and
[1:35:49] treat it so lightly
[1:35:51] how can we walk around and hold our
[1:35:53] Creeds and denominations and not take
[1:35:56] the word of God Amen why will it be for
[1:35:58] us in that day how will it happen with
[1:36:01] us
[1:36:02] when we see the glory of God some people
[1:36:04] will stand off and make fun of it some
[1:36:07] will happen
[1:36:08] some will call it fanaticism some call
[1:36:11] it mental telepathy
[1:36:13] some call it Beelzebub
[1:36:15] some call it one thing or another
[1:36:17] there's the old Proverbs is fools the
[1:36:20] walk with hobnail shoes Where Angels
[1:36:22] prayer to try
[1:36:24] right
[1:36:26] the fool is set in his heart there is no
[1:36:28] God when he sees God manifested so
[1:36:31] perfectly by this own word not by a
[1:36:33] Creed but by his word and then walked
[1:36:36] right over and make fun of it he's a
[1:36:37] fool
[1:36:39] says God is the word and God made
[1:36:41] himself plain to him and he's the fool
[1:36:44] the Bible say
[1:36:46] what will it be for him when he has to
[1:36:48] stand in that place it'll be a it'll be
[1:36:51] terrible for that man in that day the
[1:36:53] ungodly
[1:36:55] repented Sinners old doesn't have any
[1:36:58] fear oh no a sinner that will repent he
[1:37:02] knows that there's a bloody sacrifice
[1:37:04] waiting is that in his way
[1:37:07] that's what gives me the consolation
[1:37:09] I've seen the glory of God I'll tell
[1:37:13] these power I know the touch of his hand
[1:37:15] I know the touch of his chastisement I
[1:37:18] know that he's gone and I know I'm
[1:37:21] undone but there's one standing on a
[1:37:23] farm
[1:37:26] says father lay all of his iniquity upon
[1:37:30] me because he stood for me down on the
[1:37:32] earth Hallelujah then I'll walk to the
[1:37:34] throne of God boldly have embraced my
[1:37:37] heart the noise not by good works but by
[1:37:39] his mercy on your face not what I can do
[1:37:42] what I could join what I could say but
[1:37:44] it's by his grace that he's saying
[1:37:48] don't worry the point that caught that
[1:37:51] screen up Amazing Grace how sweet the
[1:37:53] sound that save the rest like me once
[1:37:56] was lost but now I'm found blind but now
[1:37:59] I see
[1:38:00] how can I ever go to heaven how could
[1:38:03] you go to heaven we cannot do it we need
[1:38:06] no way for us to do it but there's one
[1:38:07] made the way and he is the way and how
[1:38:11] do we get to him by one Spirit his
[1:38:13] Spirit we're baptized into one body
[1:38:16] which will be raised up like an orbit
[1:38:19] wheeled out of the Earth
[1:38:28] repentance Sinners don't have to worry
[1:38:30] someone is there in their place oh then
[1:38:34] after we have come into His presence now
[1:38:37] and we all know we've been in his
[1:38:39] presence we've seen do things that he
[1:38:42] did when he was here on Earth how do you
[1:38:44] know the how do you know the vine you're
[1:38:46] looking at because of fruit it bears
[1:38:56] these signs shall follow them that
[1:38:58] believe yeah but we see he never did our
[1:39:02] dentist to go make denominations
[1:39:05] he never did our Davis to go make Creed
[1:39:07] but he warned us against such
[1:39:10] or whosoever shall take anything from it
[1:39:12] or add anything to it the same would be
[1:39:15] taken out of their part in The Book of
[1:39:16] Life
[1:39:18] oh we're not our game to do them but
[1:39:20] stay with that word
[1:39:21] and if a man is stand of God he'll stay
[1:39:24] with the word because God can only send
[1:39:26] by his words
[1:39:29] a stay by his word then when we come
[1:39:32] into His presence
[1:39:34] when a man once comes into the presence
[1:39:36] of God he's changed forever
[1:39:39] if there's any change in doing
[1:39:41] it now are there are those who can walk
[1:39:44] in the presence of God and pay no
[1:39:46] attention to it he wasn't ordained alive
[1:39:48] but if he was predestinated of God as
[1:39:51] soon as that first move hits he knows it
[1:39:53] that catches fire look at that little
[1:39:56] prostitute down there that day uh
[1:39:58] Samaria that woman she's in a bad shape
[1:40:01] mentally and physically we know that but
[1:40:04] as soon as she's seen that sign down the
[1:40:06] Messiah she said we know messiah's
[1:40:09] coming to do this
[1:40:10] thou must be his prophet he said I'm
[1:40:13] that Messiah that was wrote to come she
[1:40:16] recognized that she never asked one more
[1:40:18] question she started right quick with a
[1:40:20] responsibility to know that if she had
[1:40:22] found that and come into the presence of
[1:40:24] God she was responsible to tell somebody
[1:40:26] else about it
[1:40:28] Hallelujah
[1:40:31] right
[1:40:33] any man that comes into the presence of
[1:40:35] God is responsible
[1:40:37] before God from that minute on you tell
[1:40:40] somebody else
[1:40:42] look at Abraham look at Moses look at
[1:40:46] Peter look at Paul the moment they come
[1:40:50] into the presence of God recognize
[1:40:52] themselves Sinners and seal their
[1:40:54] testimony with their life
[1:40:56] look at the little lady she couldn't
[1:40:58] stay no longer she went to the city and
[1:41:01] told the man come see the man who told
[1:41:03] me the things I've done is in this
[1:41:05] Messiah
[1:41:06] they could not deny because it was
[1:41:08] scriptural certainly they said got to do
[1:41:10] it and man when we got a responsibility
[1:41:12] of telling others as Moses did as Peter
[1:41:15] did as Paul did after these things
[1:41:18] you've seen it and come into His
[1:41:20] presence you're responsible for the
[1:41:23] message to get to somebody else yes
[1:41:26] you just cannot sit still with it you
[1:41:29] must take it to someone else
[1:41:31] I never know a sister used to be your
[1:41:33] brother grandson's mother she used to
[1:41:36] sit right here in the church and she
[1:41:38] would sing I've just got over I'm
[1:41:41] running running running I just got over
[1:41:42] and I can't sit down
[1:41:44] you just found something
[1:41:47] I will go with your little colored
[1:41:48] church over here at Lowell and uh all of
[1:41:51] us stand up singing I'm running up the
[1:41:53] King's Highway just found it and took up
[1:41:56] the highway there's something about it
[1:41:58] when you find Christ you cannot hold
[1:42:01] your peace any longer the rest of your
[1:42:03] days you are a changed person
[1:42:08] for when life and life comes together it
[1:42:11] makes a bright life
[1:42:13] true when the bulb connects with the
[1:42:15] wars if it's a correct bulb it's got to
[1:42:18] give life
[1:42:19] when the current and the bulb gets
[1:42:21] together there's nothing to do but
[1:42:22] scatter life
[1:42:24] it has to do it I'm on a man or a woman
[1:42:27] is predestinated to eternal life and
[1:42:30] they see the current of God catch that
[1:42:33] bomb it'll throw light everywhere
[1:42:36] it might not be over a 10 watt but
[1:42:38] she'll scatter what life you got
[1:42:41] being a 500 watt scatter 10 watt light
[1:42:44] yeah
[1:42:46] give your life let your life so shine
[1:42:48] before man that they might see your good
[1:42:50] works and Glory Father which is in
[1:42:53] heaven yes sir when a man comes in
[1:42:56] contact with God he recognizes himself
[1:42:58] no good
[1:43:00] how can a man walk and break about how
[1:43:02] big he is what all he's done when he's
[1:43:05] nothing
[1:43:06] he's nothing to begin with
[1:43:08] one day down in Memphis Tennessee or one
[1:43:11] I don't think Memphis is one of the
[1:43:12] places there I was with Brother Davis is
[1:43:14] having a Revival that might have been
[1:43:16] Memphis and we was went to a Coliseum
[1:43:19] and had a in there another Coliseum is
[1:43:22] kind of a art gallery and they had the
[1:43:25] uh the great statues that they'd got
[1:43:27] from different parts of the earth of
[1:43:29] different Hercules and so forth and
[1:43:31] great artists of painting and then they
[1:43:33] had the analysis of a man that weighed
[1:43:35] 150 pounds you know how much he's worth
[1:43:38] 84 cents
[1:43:40] that's all he is 84 cents is all it all
[1:43:43] the chemicals you can get out of him
[1:43:45] he's just got enough White Horse to
[1:43:47] sprinkle A Hen's Nest and he's got
[1:43:49] enough just a little bit of calcium
[1:43:51] little potash it would all sell for 84
[1:43:53] cents but we just take care of that 84
[1:43:56] cents and baby it around there's two
[1:43:58] boys stand there and one looked together
[1:43:59] and said Jim we're not worth very much
[1:44:00] are we he said no we're not John I said
[1:44:03] but wait a minute boys you got a soul
[1:44:05] and there's worth Ten Thousand Words
[1:44:06] that's been can be Redeemed by the power
[1:44:10] of God if you just let it man when he
[1:44:13] sees these things he's responsible to
[1:44:15] tell others
[1:44:18] only story I got one life we said ten
[1:44:21] thousand if I had an eternity I'd still
[1:44:24] want to tell people about it because
[1:44:26] it's the greatest thing I ever found if
[1:44:28] you read in Ezekiel 33 33rd chapter of
[1:44:31] Ezekiel there was a Watchman set on a
[1:44:33] tower and this wasman was responsible
[1:44:37] for the entire city
[1:44:40] amen
[1:44:41] I'll wait wake yourselves to your
[1:44:43] spiritual conscience a minute while I
[1:44:46] get to this scripture
[1:44:47] that Watchman had to be a trained man
[1:44:51] he had to know what he was doing
[1:44:53] for At Any distance as soon as it arose
[1:44:58] the enemy he can detect it
[1:45:01] he could tell their March
[1:45:03] he could tell their color
[1:45:05] he could tell her where he can file
[1:45:08] just as far as the human eyes could see
[1:45:10] he could see it and he was higher than
[1:45:12] the rest of them
[1:45:14] for he was trained to know the enemy
[1:45:16] and God required the whole city at his
[1:45:20] hands
[1:45:21] Watchman water the night
[1:45:24] Hallelujah that's the way God's soldiers
[1:45:26] are today
[1:45:28] they're trained to the word
[1:45:30] what do you think Concepts polished to
[1:45:33] it and got something else is not
[1:45:35] scripture they warn their congregation
[1:45:37] amen anything is not viable anything is
[1:45:40] not it's not Godlike such as having soup
[1:45:44] suppers dances and everything else to
[1:45:46] pay off the pastors
[1:45:48] those things are wrong phone call games
[1:45:50] and card parties in the churches that's
[1:45:53] wrong
[1:45:55] and a real Watchman on the wall who's
[1:45:57] once been in the presence of God Amen if
[1:46:00] he isn't on the wall if he just throws
[1:46:03] to be on the wall the wall may not be
[1:46:05] any higher than the rest of the
[1:46:06] congregation
[1:46:07] but if he's the correct Watchman God
[1:46:09] raises he put up in the stairs that the
[1:46:12] rest of them never gets to but he
[1:46:14] watches the fly and God requires it of
[1:46:17] him
[1:46:19] the man of God who stands in the
[1:46:22] presence of God and knows God is God and
[1:46:25] know that God keeps his word and watch
[1:46:27] God perform himself and do his duty and
[1:46:30] keep his word that no matter how many
[1:46:33] organizations
[1:46:35] he knows a rank and power of the enemy
[1:46:38] amen
[1:46:40] amen
[1:46:42] he knows what to tell the congregation a
[1:46:45] real Watchman
[1:46:46] ah
[1:46:49] if we have confessed
[1:46:51] and he is that we've been in this
[1:46:52] presence and we have confessed our sins
[1:46:56] they're blotted out the book of his
[1:46:59] memory
[1:47:00] now there's nobody but God could do that
[1:47:03] now you can do anything to me I forgive
[1:47:05] you but I'll remember
[1:47:07] if I do anything to you you forgive me
[1:47:10] but you'll remember
[1:47:12] but God can forgive and forget it amen
[1:47:19] don't even remember
[1:47:22] amen that makes me feel good anymore
[1:47:34] nothing but God can do that
[1:47:37] he said he would blotted out of his book
[1:47:40] of memory
[1:47:41] I can't do it you can't do it
[1:47:44] because we've only got these little
[1:47:46] finite senses but he's infinite God he
[1:47:50] can absolutely forget that it ever was
[1:47:52] done
[1:47:57] praise God

[1:52:01] he confessed his sins he said woe is me
[1:52:04] for I'm a man of unclean lips a prophet

[1:52:12] congregations unclean hey the people I
[1:52:16] preached to they're unclean I'm unclean
[1:52:19] and warns me but here comes a bunch of
[1:52:22] angels down from the glory of God
[1:52:24] Banning back to the clouds and I look up
[1:52:28] there and see strains filling the whole
[1:52:30] heaven
[1:52:31] and I'll watch these angels that's never
[1:52:34] known what sin was they never even known
[1:52:37] what sin was and there in the presence
[1:52:40] of God they've got two Wings over their
[1:52:42] faces they got two Wings over their feet

[1:53:10] and come over and laid it on the prophet
[1:53:13] slips instead of cleanse you
[1:53:17] amen then the wings are winning their
[1:53:19] wave like that moved away the curtains
[1:53:22] of time and he heard God say who will go
[1:53:24] for us but after he found out that there
[1:53:28] was a way to rid sin God wanted somebody
[1:53:31] to go for him and he said Jeremiah send
[1:53:34] me
[1:53:35] he had been in the presence of God and
[1:53:38] had confessed his sins and then cleansed
[1:53:41] from his sins and was ready for service
[1:53:46] amen
[1:53:47] as the poet called that said millions
[1:53:50] now in sin and shame are dying listen to
[1:53:53] their sad and bitter cry hasten brother
[1:53:55] hasten to the rescue quickly answer

[1:54:17] Deliverance not make him join a church
[1:54:19] or shape hand and have a cream but bring
[1:54:22] delivers to their soul some good godly
[1:54:25] man yes Isaiah confessed his sins and
[1:54:28] was cleansed after Jacob had wrestled
[1:54:32] all night in confessing his sins
[1:54:35] give me other place to us it's called
[1:54:37] penthol p-e-n-i-t-l Dental
[1:54:42] the word people in the Hebrew means the
[1:54:45] face of almighty God
[1:54:49] Jacob the little shyster
[1:54:52] had run all his name of Jacob which
[1:54:55] means it's a planter that's deceiver had
[1:54:57] run all of his life away from God
[1:55:00] but when he got one time in the presence
[1:55:02] of God at people in the face of God he
[1:55:06] got a hold of God and it wouldn't turn
[1:55:07] him loose
[1:55:09] God we need for Jacobs
[1:55:11] he held on
[1:55:13] to the face of God
[1:55:15] in the presence of God
[1:55:17] he stayed until it was sent up God said
[1:55:21] let me go because the sun's arising and
[1:55:25] he stayed in the face of God until son
[1:55:27] up but he went away Justified and saved
[1:55:31] oh what a great thing it was now
[1:55:34] to know that he is wrestled through
[1:55:37] that's he had seen signs of God he'd had
[1:55:40] dreams about God but this is one time he
[1:55:43] was in the face of God in the presence
[1:55:45] of God think of it friends now as we
[1:55:48] hurry up in the presence of God a man's
[1:55:52] change Jacob was changed now he could
[1:55:55] walk with God yes he was a different man
[1:55:58] than what he was when he went up there
[1:55:59] the battle was now over yes sir and he
[1:56:03] began to build an altar he hadn't been
[1:56:05] used to building harder you know
[1:56:07] but I'll tell you when you come in the
[1:56:09] presence of God you want to build an
[1:56:11] altar somewhere you want to find
[1:56:13] somewhere where you can pray he built an
[1:56:15] order he was cleansed and God had won
[1:56:19] and Jacob was changed from Jacob's
[1:56:22] supplanter to Israel of Prince having
[1:56:26] power with God
[1:56:29] that's what happened to Jacob the
[1:56:31] supplanter The Deceiver
[1:56:33] the unrighteous the Unholy the deceiver
[1:56:37] deceived his brother
[1:56:40] stole the birthright says it was from
[1:56:42] his brother
[1:56:43] took a little dirty way of doing it such
[1:56:46] a deceivering he deceived his
[1:56:47] father-in-law but popper sticks made
[1:56:50] speckled calves when the cow has been
[1:56:51] pregnant he'd come there look at the
[1:56:53] Sheep but she had speckle stick mixed
[1:56:55] speckled cattle give him birthmarks
[1:56:58] deceiver deceiving his own father-in-law
[1:57:01] deceived his mother deceived his daddy
[1:57:03] deceived his brother but when he once
[1:57:06] got in the he was a shyster he was
[1:57:08] running everywhere he went always on the
[1:57:10] run from God he's on the run from his
[1:57:12] brother but when he come into the
[1:57:13] presence of God he recognized he was a
[1:57:16] sinner
[1:57:18] what did he do what did he do he seen
[1:57:22] his opportunity he had met something
[1:57:24] that he didn't even think about before
[1:57:26] and he stayed there until all sins was
[1:57:29] gone
[1:57:30] oh man
[1:57:32] God got him
[1:57:33] in his own presence
[1:57:35] God manages a way to get man in their
[1:57:37] presence and to make their decision some
[1:57:40] of them run from him some run to him if
[1:57:42] they're predestinated to life they
[1:57:44] believe it they hang on to it if they're
[1:57:45] not they try to get away and says
[1:57:47] nothing to it see and that's the god
[1:57:49] that's lost the god that confesses his
[1:57:52] sin shall have pardon if you hide your
[1:57:54] sin you'll not prospered no so Jacob
[1:57:57] when he it was the next day he met Esau
[1:58:00] his brother he didn't need no help from
[1:58:03] him
[1:58:04] he didn't need his armies he is this is
[1:58:07] building orders
[1:58:10] he wasn't afraid of he saw no more
[1:58:13] Psalms 16 8. David said I have set the
[1:58:18] Lord before me
[1:58:20] that's a good thing to do
[1:58:22] Psalm 16 8 I set the Lord before me so
[1:58:25] he could
[1:58:27] not be
[1:58:29] confused about it uh he wanted to be
[1:58:32] conscious of his presence so David said
[1:58:35] I have set the lord always before my
[1:58:38] face
[1:58:39] now I
[1:58:41] David have set the Lord before my face
[1:58:45] always to be conscious conscious of
[1:58:49] God's presence wouldn't that be a good
[1:58:51] lesson for all of us tonight amen said
[1:58:53] the Lord before a face so we'll be
[1:58:55] conscious of his presence
[1:58:57] buddy him first
[1:58:59] why but he first before you why then you
[1:59:04] won't sin when you are realizing that
[1:59:07] constantly you're in the presence of God
[1:59:10] when you realize God's around you watch
[1:59:13] what you say
[1:59:15] a man when he thinks God's gone he'll
[1:59:19] cuss
[1:59:20] he'll lust after women
[1:59:23] he'll do you steal
[1:59:27] he'll do anything when he thinks that
[1:59:30] God don't see him but bring him into the
[1:59:32] presence of God you stop it right now
[1:59:36] and David said I have put the lord
[1:59:39] always before me
[1:59:41] that's a good thing the water of God
[1:59:43] said he's man after his own heart
[1:59:46] man will do everything when he thinks
[1:59:48] that God is near but when he realizes
[1:59:50] that God's near do you ever know it's a
[1:59:52] sinner let a Godly person walk up he'll
[1:59:54] quit he's cursing yeah he's got any
[1:59:56] respects at all he won't tell the dirty
[1:59:59] jokes that he would have told see he you
[2:00:01] leave off that because he knows that
[2:00:03] he's in the presence of God because God
[2:00:05] dwells in the Tabernacle of his people
[2:00:07] see after David did this he said
[2:00:12] my heart shall rejoice I wish you read
[2:00:14] Psalm 16. my heart will rejoice and my
[2:00:19] flesh shall Rest In Hope
[2:00:21] why my heart shall rejoice because of
[2:00:24] God God before me all the time yeah and
[2:00:27] my flesh shall rest and hope if I die
[2:00:30] I'll be raised up again or he'll not
[2:00:32] suffer his holy one and see corruption
[2:00:34] neither will it be stolen hell amen see
[2:00:37] when David put God before him and was
[2:00:41] conscious that constantly he was in the
[2:00:44] presence of God
[2:00:45] seek ye first the kingdom of God now

[2:00:51] to listen to me now is brother

[2:00:58] and don't you do nothing that you
[2:01:00] wouldn't do in his presence
[2:01:02] because he's watching over you

[2:01:07] fear Him
[2:01:08] he don't he just stays right near you
[2:01:10] and he knows everything you're doing and
[2:01:12] you must recognize that
[2:01:14] when you start to tell her I don't do it

[2:01:18] if you start to do a little cheat don't

[2:01:40] eye watching you remember do like David

[2:01:49] flesh shall Rest In Hope for he promised
[2:01:52] it yesterday he knew that he had raised
[2:01:55] up because God had promised it
[2:01:59] all right
[2:02:00] when we come into His presence we're
[2:02:03] changed never to be the same look all
[2:02:05] down to the ages of every Walk of Life
[2:02:08] man look at Abraham you say well the
[2:02:12] changed life is just for ministers oh no
[2:02:14] the change lives for everybody
[2:02:17] now Abraham was a farmer
[2:02:22] but when he heard God's voice speaking
[2:02:24] to him and saw that Vision he was a
[2:02:27] changed man from that time on he
[2:02:29] separated himself from his Kindred from
[2:02:31] all his associates and walked as a
[2:02:34] pilgrim in a Stranger in a Strange Land
[2:02:35] the rest of his life
[2:02:37] dwelling intense because he clearly
[2:02:39] confessed that he was seeking the city
[2:02:41] he was Builder and maker was God he know
[2:02:44] there was a God and there was a city
[2:02:46] somewhere whose Builder and maker was
[2:02:47] God that's what Hebrews 11 tells us that
[2:02:50] he's seeking a city as Builder and maker
[2:02:53] was God he was a changed man yet he was
[2:02:55] nothing but a mere farmer but he saw a
[2:02:58] vision and come into the presence of God
[2:03:00] and he was a changed man from then on
[2:03:02] Moses he was a shepherd
[2:03:05] but he was a changed man when he come
[2:03:08] into the presence of God he was a coward
[2:03:10] he was running from Pharaoh with the
[2:03:13] whole Army behind him but with a stick
[2:03:15] in his hand he went back and took the
[2:03:17] whole nation
[2:03:19] why he come into the presence of God he
[2:03:22] was a changed man a Shepherd Peter a
[2:03:26] fisherman
[2:03:27] know nothing about fishing or know
[2:03:29] nothing about God only thing he probably
[2:03:31] know was how to catch fish but when he'd
[2:03:33] come in the presence of God and see the
[2:03:35] great Creator who could create fish when
[2:03:38] he told him let down the net for the
[2:03:39] draw there wasn't any fish there he just
[2:03:41] pulled his Nets up but he said that's
[2:03:44] Thy word Lord I believe that you're the
[2:03:45] Son of God and if you let a violet on
[2:03:47] that you told me to do it at your word
[2:03:50] because you and your word are the same
[2:03:51] I'll let down the mess and when he began
[2:03:54] to pull he's depart Lord I'm a sinful
[2:03:57] man
[2:03:57] a fisherman
[2:04:00] after Peterman Christ he was never the
[2:04:03] same anymore the answer words was so
[2:04:06] true to God he was given the keys to the
[2:04:07] kingdom
[2:04:08] yes sir Paul a self-style Pharisee
[2:04:12] educated and trained in all the religion
[2:04:15] of the that there was in the world in
[2:04:16] that day one of the highest known
[2:04:18] scholars in the land but when he come
[2:04:21] before that Pillar of Fire one day the
[2:04:23] God that he had persecuted eagerly

[2:04:29] that God was the man he know God was a
[2:04:32] pillar of fire it led his people out of
[2:04:35] Egypt he had been with them all alone
[2:04:37] but when he saw this Pillar of Fire he
[2:04:39] fell on his face and he heard a voice

[2:17:10] temper it might be drinking might be
[2:17:13] smoking might be Gammon I don't know
[2:17:15] what it might be lust it might be
[2:17:16] anything I don't know what it is

[2:17:29] in the last days when he comes forth
[2:17:32] we'll come in his likeness once you do
[2:17:34] it now while we pray our heavenly father
[2:17:38] a little chopped up message by a tired
[2:17:41] weary servant
[2:17:44] but just thinking on the subject of
[2:17:46] dwelling in the presence of God
[2:17:49] and we see tonight the effect that is
[2:17:51] taken upon holy man to come into your
[2:17:54] presence
[2:17:55] what effect it had upon Him Sages
[2:17:59] great powerful Prophets
[2:18:02] ordained by God and said to preach the
[2:18:05] word and yet meeting face to face and
[2:18:08] fall to the ground like a dead man
[2:18:10] what are we going to do it that day Lord
[2:18:13] we thought it over we've been thinking
[2:18:15] it some 40 or 50 hands has been thinking
[2:18:19] it Lord for they just raise them hands
[2:18:21] or Hearts beneath the hands has been
[2:18:24] thinking about meeting him since we've
[2:18:25] been speaking what would they do if they
[2:18:28] had to meet him my hands Lords up what
[2:18:32] will I do now father I've got many
[2:18:35] things that I do wrong I've just
[2:18:37] confessed my sin this morning before the
[2:18:39] church as I confessed with you on top of
[2:18:41] the mountain the other morning when it
[2:18:43] was blowing and snowing and up there on
[2:18:45] top of the mountain the high cried out
[2:18:47] and asked you to forgive me for my
[2:18:50] stupidity and how I dreaded to come
[2:18:53] before my brother who some of them
[2:18:54] regard me as your Prophet servant and
[2:18:57] Lord how I hated to come to for them and
[2:18:59] tell them of a stupid act that I would
[2:19:02] do a thing like that but God is good for
[2:19:04] my soul that I confess my sins and not
[2:19:07] hide them so to be honest with you and
[2:19:10] right before the people I have confessed
[2:19:12] it Lord I'm wrong I'm all together wrong
[2:19:15] I pray forgiveness and then father I've
[2:19:18] been dilatory about you serving him many
[2:19:21] times maybe I could have went longer
[2:19:23] when I Didn't Do It father I confess my
[2:19:26] sins I want the angel of God to cleanse
[2:19:28] me from that of the blood of Jesus other
[2:19:31] hands went up tonight some of them maybe
[2:19:33] has never asked forgiveness before but
[2:19:35] I'm sure of this one thing if we'll
[2:19:37] confess our sins God will block them out
[2:19:40] put them in the sea of forgiveness and
[2:19:42] never remember no more
[2:19:45] and fathers I confess mine about
[2:19:47] misbehaving before them people I didn't
[2:19:50] carry on myself like a servant of Christ
[2:19:52] I didn't I afraid that man might be
[2:19:55] angry with me and think I didn't want to
[2:19:57] hurt his feelings but I didn't think of
[2:19:58] what I was doing to you Lord and I I
[2:20:01] prayed that you forgive me and now
[2:20:03] father I know that if I ask forgiveness
[2:20:06] I have forgiveness and you put him in a
[2:20:09] sea of forgiveness and you'll never
[2:20:10] remember that no more God I'm thankful
[2:20:13] for that and I pray that you'll let
[2:20:14] every person here that has sin or
[2:20:17] besetting sin of anything before them
[2:20:20] may they remove it and put the Lord
[2:20:22] before them like David did for now we
[2:20:25] cry woe is me for I have seen the glory
[2:20:28] of God I'm a man of unclean lips or a
[2:20:31] woman or girl of unclean lips boy or
[2:20:33] something whatever we might be we're
[2:20:35] unclean and we ask for the blood of
[2:20:38] Jesus Christ the appropriated sacrifice
[2:20:40] that cleanse us from all sin that we
[2:20:43] might ever dwell in his presence let us
[2:20:46] go from here tonight with our hearts
[2:20:48] rejoicing and our flesh resting in Hope
[2:20:50] knowing this that when Jesus does come
[2:20:53] we'll be raised with him in his likeness
[2:20:56] and shall meet him in the air in the
