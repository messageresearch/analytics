[58:55] you may be seated in the presence of the
[58:57] lord today we are so happy
[58:59] to be able to be here in fellowship and
[59:02] we know what's happening
[59:04] uh around the world we know what's
[59:05] happening in the country as well
[59:07] and it's it's so much to say about it
[59:10] uh but i'm i don't know how about you
[59:12] but i'm still feasting on the convention
[59:14] you're still feasting on the convention
[59:16] there was so much that was said that you
[59:18] could always just connect back and get
[59:20] some encouragement there and how many
[59:21] appreciate about obese message last week
[59:23] sunday the dynamics
[59:25] of that promise would oh what a
[59:28] tremendous time in the lord
[59:30] and on wednesday night if you missed it
[59:32] you need to get it the letter kill it
[59:34] but the spirit gave it life what a
[59:36] masterpiece on wednesday night
[59:38] put in the spirit in its place in the
[59:41] church because there's so much that
[59:43] people know there's so much knowledge
[59:44] there's so much information
[59:46] but and we'll see it in today's service
[59:49] it has to
[59:49] lead to something it has to produce
[59:51] something it has to do
[59:53] something there's a lot of people who
[59:54] have knowledge and information and can
[59:56] interpret this and interpret that and
[59:58] we'll see about it has to lead us into a
[1:00:00] place of action
[1:00:02] so it has to be the spirit that drives
[1:00:04] the action it can't just be
[1:00:06] word only because we know the gospel is
[1:00:07] not in word only but it is in power and
[1:00:09] demonstration so
[1:00:11] are you with me this morning so we see
[1:00:13] what's happening around us
[1:00:14] we see new cases coming into the country
[1:00:18] we knew
[1:00:19] we see the the news and the people and
[1:00:21] everything is happening at the same time
[1:00:22] there's there's
[1:00:23] in the political realm we have elections
[1:00:25] coming up and all of a sudden we have
[1:00:26] these new cases there's
[1:00:28] economic turmoil everything is building
[1:00:30] to something
[1:00:31] and it should not come as a surprise to
[1:00:33] us but we also have our
[1:00:34] our part to play we also have our
[1:00:36] responsibility
[1:00:38] and we have our responsibility to be
[1:00:40] ready
[1:00:41] that is the great responsibility the
[1:00:43] great responsibility is not measured by
[1:00:45] attendance in church that has its place
[1:00:47] but the great responsibility is to be
[1:00:49] ready
[1:00:50] because you don't want to pass the grade
[1:00:51] for attendance and not be ready
[1:00:53] you don't want to pass the grade for
[1:00:55] knowing the message and not be ready
[1:00:57] you don't want to pass the grade for
[1:00:58] being on fire and not be ready
[1:01:00] all of these things are important you
[1:01:02] don't want to pass the grade for praying
[1:01:04] and not be ready
[1:01:05] you don't want to pass the grade of
[1:01:07] being spiritual and not being ready
[1:01:09] it is important to do these things but
[1:01:11] make no mistake about it you need to be
[1:01:13] ready
[1:01:14] and that's why i read this scripture we
[1:01:15] have a responsibility to make our
[1:01:17] calling and election
[1:01:18] show that is a responsibility it's a
[1:01:21] daily responsibility
[1:01:23] when you wake up in the morning it's i
[1:01:24] gotta be sure
[1:01:26] i want to be sure i can't afford to take
[1:01:28] a chance not in this season
[1:01:30] not in this season when the enemy is
[1:01:32] moving around not in these seasons
[1:01:34] when we see plagues on every hand not in
[1:01:36] this season when the lid of hell is open
[1:01:39] and streams of demon powers are moving
[1:01:42] or not in this season
[1:01:43] i want to be very sure my confidence
[1:01:46] cannot be based on man
[1:01:48] my confidence cannot be based on the
[1:01:50] church i attend
[1:01:51] my confidence cannot even be based on my
[1:01:54] understanding
[1:01:55] or my revelation it has to be confident
[1:01:58] in the fact that he said
[1:01:59] not i said but he said this is my
[1:02:02] beloved son
[1:02:03] it is not us being identified with him
[1:02:05] but it is he being identified with us
[1:02:07] can the church say amen
[1:02:11] so i'm excited this morning because i
[1:02:14] see the season is changing
[1:02:16] and it's happening so quickly that if
[1:02:18] you don't have spiritual eyes you will
[1:02:20] see it as business as usual
[1:02:22] so may god anoint your eyes with eyes
[1:02:24] out this morning
[1:02:26] and i encourage you and for those on the
[1:02:27] internet i want you to know i'm
[1:02:29] preaching to the church this morning
[1:02:31] i'm preaching the headstone tabernacle
[1:02:33] this morning if you are blessed
[1:02:35] i welcome you i appreciate you i
[1:02:38] encourage you when i'm speaking to the
[1:02:40] church this morning
[1:02:41] and we are an open church we speak to be
[1:02:44] a blessing to anybody who wants to be
[1:02:46] blessed
[1:02:47] hallelujah we have no agenda we're not
[1:02:49] telling anybody attend this church
[1:02:51] join this church follow this church
[1:02:53] that's not the ministry here
[1:02:55] hallelujah we are preaching to this
[1:02:56] local church if it's a blessing
[1:02:59] to you then thank god and you worship
[1:03:01] god
[1:03:02] and use it as a blessing to you so i
[1:03:04] greet those who are connected to be
[1:03:06] blessed
[1:03:06] i also greet those who are connected who
[1:03:08] want to criticize because you can't stop
[1:03:10] the critics
[1:03:11] but i want to encourage you don't stress
[1:03:13] yourself out if you come to criticize
[1:03:15] we're not forcing anybody to connect to
[1:03:17] this we're not
[1:03:18] encouraging people to stress out
[1:03:20] yourself to find out what we're
[1:03:21] preaching
[1:03:22] we preach this on the revelation of god
[1:03:24] that he has given to us
[1:03:25] so if you don't like noise don't
[1:03:27] criticize the noise that we have here
[1:03:29] because
[1:03:30] from the limited understanding i have of
[1:03:32] the word but the branham said if there's
[1:03:34] no noise there's no god
[1:03:35] until i can see more than that
[1:03:37] understanding don't let the noise bother
[1:03:39] you
[1:03:40] don't let our worship bother you don't
[1:03:42] let that was standing up
[1:03:46] don't stress yourself out don't let your
[1:03:49] blood pressure
[1:03:50] go up high you don't have to connect to
[1:03:52] this service
[1:03:53] but if you connect to the service i can
[1:03:55] assure you you're gonna hear some
[1:03:57] shouting you're going to hear some
[1:03:58] singing you're going to hear some
[1:04:00] dancing we worship in a way that the
[1:04:02] world will call heresy
[1:04:04] even within the message they may call it
[1:04:06] heresy but don't try to tie me down
[1:04:09] by your interpretation or revelation of
[1:04:11] the word
[1:04:12] this is a sovereign church oh my god
[1:04:15] deals with individuals
[1:04:17] and this is an individual church made up
[1:04:19] of individuals who have seen their name
[1:04:22] because once you say your name it makes
[1:04:24] you act a certain way
[1:04:26] walk a certain way talk a certain way
[1:04:28] behave a certain way
[1:04:30] you may be seated
[1:04:32] [Applause]
[1:04:34] there are many people get stressed out
[1:04:37] but always said it about two bible says
[1:04:39] ago there's no space in his head for
[1:04:42] anybody else
[1:04:43] we're not bothered by what anybody else
[1:04:44] is doing every church is sovereign
[1:04:47] you could preach what you want to preach
[1:04:49] you could teach what you want to teach
[1:04:50] but you can't come and tell us what we
[1:04:52] have to preach or what we have to teach
[1:04:55] we are responsible for those who have
[1:04:57] made this church their home church
[1:04:59] that's the limits of our responsibility
[1:05:01] we have no other responsibility
[1:05:03] beyond the tight paying members of this
[1:05:05] church who have made it their home
[1:05:07] church so don't stress yourself out and
[1:05:09] say oh gosh that's what we're always
[1:05:11] preaching that's what the eyes are
[1:05:12] preaching
[1:05:13] we will preach this way until god tells
[1:05:15] us otherwise
[1:05:16] because we report only to god can the
[1:05:19] church say amen
[1:05:20] and your confidence must be peace and
[1:05:22] hearing from god you may be seated
[1:05:26] my confidence cannot be based on
[1:05:28] whatever it says
[1:05:30] he's the pastor of this church but paul
[1:05:32] taught us he said follow me
[1:05:34] as i follow christ i always teach that
[1:05:36] follow me as i follow christ
[1:05:38] so i'm watching the pastor but i'm
[1:05:39] watching christ i'm watching the past
[1:05:41] and i'm watching christ
[1:05:42] i'm watching the past and i'm watching
[1:05:44] christ because i gotta make sure
[1:05:46] because if he is leaving away from
[1:05:48] christ and i don't want to be there
[1:05:50] but if it's heading to christ if it's
[1:05:52] pointed to christ if it pointed to the
[1:05:53] rapture
[1:05:54] pointing to the resurrection pointing to
[1:05:56] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:05:58] pointing to revelation after revelation
[1:06:00] then you don't even try to stop me
[1:06:02] you you may be seated
[1:06:05] [Applause]
[1:06:09] there are 8 billion people on this
[1:06:11] planet and we're going to get into it
[1:06:12] why i'm going here
[1:06:14] why would you be stressed with what
[1:06:15] another church is doing
[1:06:19] 1.4 million people in trinidad and
[1:06:21] tobago
[1:06:22] there are a lot more people that you can
[1:06:24] go and testify to than stress out about
[1:06:26] what we're doing in this church
[1:06:28] and that applies around the world we
[1:06:29] need to have a bigger vision
[1:06:31] of the call of god on our lives can the
[1:06:33] church say amen
[1:06:34] can i preach now you know where i'm
[1:06:37] standing
[1:06:38] you know where you're standing may the
[1:06:40] lord bless you
[1:06:44] i'm feeling good
[1:06:46] [Applause]
[1:06:48] just to know i've been redeemed makes me
[1:06:50] feel good
[1:06:51] hallelujah you imagine if the if the
[1:06:53] wise man one bothered because
[1:06:55] he that brought up goldberg goldberg
[1:07:00] and the lord opened up frankincense and
[1:07:02] wondering if this frankincense message i
[1:07:04] have this morning has any place
[1:07:06] and whenever this message of murder that
[1:07:08] we bring in this morning have any place
[1:07:10] each one had their individual revelation
[1:07:12] but in the economy of god
[1:07:14] god is the one who connects the dots and
[1:07:15] when he connected it it brought a whole
[1:07:17] message
[1:07:18] can the church say amen so
[1:07:25] put on your spiritual hats this morning
[1:07:28] just to encourage the church a little
[1:07:29] bit
[1:07:32] i want to take us all back into history
[1:07:35] before i bring
[1:07:35] present tense
[1:07:38] the day was
[1:07:42] sunday december the 30th
[1:07:45] 1962 sunday december 30th
[1:07:52] 1962.
[1:07:55] just about four months before our
[1:07:57] country would have just achieved
[1:07:59] independence
[1:08:01] from the british john f kennedy is the
[1:08:05] president in the united states
[1:08:09] in that year history would record the
[1:08:11] cuban missile crisis
[1:08:13] the formation of the european space
[1:08:15] agency
[1:08:16] the release of the first beatles record
[1:08:20] in that year would signal the first
[1:08:22] k-mart
[1:08:23] the first walmart a lot was happening in
[1:08:26] that year
[1:08:28] and the day was sunday december 30th
[1:08:31] 1962 god's prophet had just finished
[1:08:35] preaching
[1:08:36] in shreveport the countdown and he
[1:08:38] followed that message a countdown with
[1:08:40] four messages in jeffersonville
[1:08:43] remembering the lord the falling apart
[1:08:45] of the world
[1:08:47] the reproach for the cause of the word
[1:08:49] and the absolute
[1:08:51] he finds himself in an evening service
[1:08:54] speaking about how long he would have
[1:08:56] kept the people that morning
[1:08:57] but he felt compelled to come that
[1:08:59] evening to address a few things
[1:09:01] he is speaking on a subject on this
[1:09:03] evening
[1:09:04] is this the sign of the ends
[1:09:08] as he goes deeper into his thought his
[1:09:11] message
[1:09:12] his subject he begins to touch on
[1:09:13] certain things
[1:09:15] for one of the few moments in his entire
[1:09:17] ministry
[1:09:18] he would say i don't know what i'm about
[1:09:20] to say i'm not sure what i'm doing and
[1:09:23] he said it's weird for a
[1:09:24] minister to say that to him that i've
[1:09:27] not been this way before
[1:09:29] and many things are said in that message
[1:09:31] she speaks about
[1:09:32] the blast that would signal his new
[1:09:35] ministry his new commission
[1:09:37] he first thought it meant he was going
[1:09:39] to die but this is 1962
[1:09:41] he is trying to figure out what's going
[1:09:42] on but something is pressing upon him
[1:09:48] in that message he touches certain
[1:09:50] things he said but tonight
[1:09:51] i'm going to speak on something that i
[1:09:52] do not know
[1:09:55] and now that's quite a thing for a
[1:09:57] minister to say that he's going to speak
[1:09:58] on something
[1:09:59] that he doesn't know about but i'm
[1:10:00] adventuring out to the best of my
[1:10:02] knowledge
[1:10:03] that this church might understand he's
[1:10:05] trying to bring them to a spot
[1:10:09] and he says later on we know that we are
[1:10:10] living in a glorious time for the church
[1:10:12] but a
[1:10:13] horrible time for the unbeliever and
[1:10:15] we're living in one of the most
[1:10:16] dangerous times of all
[1:10:18] all that ever was since the world began
[1:10:21] no prophet no apostle never in no
[1:10:24] time ever lived in such a time as we
[1:10:26] live now this is the end
[1:10:29] he said it's written in the skies it's
[1:10:31] written over the face of the earth
[1:10:33] it's written in every newspaper
[1:10:36] i was just seeing recently this whole
[1:10:38] covet 19 coronavirus situation they're
[1:10:40] talking about
[1:10:41] vaccine they're talking about treatment
[1:10:44] and recently just a few days ago the
[1:10:46] doctor saying they're realizing
[1:10:48] that this is something man has to live
[1:10:49] with for some time
[1:10:53] it could be years could you imagine
[1:10:57] when the world thinks there's an easy
[1:10:59] release or easy fix
[1:11:00] or an easy solution or it will just
[1:11:02] disappear it said it could be years
[1:11:05] we don't know and the world doesn't know
[1:11:08] but god is the one holding these pieces
[1:11:10] together
[1:11:11] it's written in every newspaper this is
[1:11:13] the end he said if you could read the
[1:11:15] handwriting
[1:11:16] i'm in a background i'm trying to get
[1:11:18] somewhere i haven't announced my title
[1:11:19] yet
[1:11:20] the prophets lived in the time when the
[1:11:22] handwriting was on the wall for a nation
[1:11:24] but we are living when the handwriting
[1:11:26] is on the wall for time
[1:11:29] so it's not just the end of a nation or
[1:11:32] the end of a people or the end of a
[1:11:33] government or the end of countries this
[1:11:35] is
[1:11:35] the handwriting is on the wall speaking
[1:11:38] to the end of time
[1:11:40] and the end of time means the all the
[1:11:42] end of all things that are temporal
[1:11:45] or temporary or created for this
[1:11:47] construct
[1:11:48] that we call time can the church say
[1:11:50] amen
[1:11:52] all nations earth everything time is at
[1:11:55] the end
[1:11:56] so we must search the scriptures to find
[1:11:58] the hour that we are living
[1:12:01] always a true prophet of god will go
[1:12:06] to the scriptures therefore he is
[1:12:08] absolute
[1:12:09] when it's going to be that way in the
[1:12:12] old testament when prophet said anything
[1:12:15] there always somewhere was a prophet
[1:12:16] with the word who stayed with the word
[1:12:18] he watched god for visions
[1:12:20] and if his vision was contrary to the
[1:12:22] word then his vision was wrong
[1:12:24] that's god's way of getting his word
[1:12:27] to the people and ibrahim would speak
[1:12:30] many things in this message and you
[1:12:31] should listen to it
[1:12:33] references junior jackson's dream he
[1:12:35] messing messa he
[1:12:36] mentions the banks of the ohio river he
[1:12:39] mentions all of these connections about
[1:12:40] his ministry
[1:12:41] the sign he was under he mentioned about
[1:12:43] going west he talked about all the he
[1:12:45] goes into the seven thunders and he goes
[1:12:46] in a lot of these things
[1:12:50] but that's not where i'm going this
[1:12:51] morning
[1:12:54] then there's a moment of fear in his
[1:12:57] preaching
[1:12:59] the prophet stumbles on a moment of
[1:13:01] reflection and concern
[1:13:04] this is this is almost now about 30
[1:13:06] years he would reference it that he's in
[1:13:08] this pulpit
[1:13:10] that he's been preaching he has been
[1:13:11] teaching
[1:13:13] and he screams out in this message it
[1:13:15] might be closer than you think
[1:13:18] it is and he says the word it got me
[1:13:21] scared
[1:13:25] i want you to see a prophet now who as
[1:13:28] he is now ministering
[1:13:29] reaches a point where
[1:13:33] he said it got me scared oh i haven't
[1:13:36] done enough
[1:13:39] where are we at time shall be no more
[1:13:43] he announces time is over
[1:13:46] the statement all i haven't done enough
[1:13:50] from the prophet is a shaking statement
[1:13:54] at that moment the prophet realized that
[1:13:56] there was more to be done
[1:14:01] he was speaking on a personal level so
[1:14:03] he was not
[1:14:04] at that point he's not talking about the
[1:14:06] church
[1:14:07] he's not talking about brother norman
[1:14:08] he's not talking about about about
[1:14:10] about uh but uh but a but a buzzword
[1:14:14] he doesn't want anybody else
[1:14:17] he realizes something i haven't done
[1:14:20] enough
[1:14:22] that's a realization
[1:14:25] he had had many encounters with the
[1:14:27] angel of the lord he had
[1:14:29] already ministered for many years around
[1:14:31] the world he had already been used by
[1:14:33] god for many mighty miracles
[1:14:35] and here it was the prophet is saying oh
[1:14:38] i haven't done
[1:14:39] enough i'm trying to talk to the church
[1:14:42] this morning this is one of those
[1:14:43] messages
[1:14:45] this morning with the lord's help i
[1:14:47] would like to take a title
[1:14:48] have we done enough
[1:14:53] that's the title have we done enough for
[1:14:56] my subject
[1:14:57] have you done enough and my inspiration
[1:15:01] have i done
[1:15:03] enough the question this morning is that
[1:15:06] have we heard enough
[1:15:10] because for years people have heard the
[1:15:12] message
[1:15:14] but when you watch the lives and the
[1:15:16] testimonies and the behaviors and the
[1:15:18] conduct
[1:15:19] clearly it is not just hearing
[1:15:25] i'm preaching to this church now there's
[1:15:28] a difference between hearing and doing
[1:15:30] the question and i'm challenging us this
[1:15:32] morning
[1:15:34] have we done enough have you done enough
[1:15:37] have i
[1:15:38] done enough i'm positioning that there's
[1:15:40] nobody else above it because if the
[1:15:42] prophet could admit
[1:15:43] that he did not do enough at that point
[1:15:46] in his ministry
[1:15:48] what about you what about me what about
[1:15:50] us this morning
[1:15:51] have we done enough have you done enough
[1:15:55] have i done enough but if branham said
[1:15:58] god don't make halfway preachers but a
[1:15:59] preacher could be halfway
[1:16:01] and to be halfway means a preacher is
[1:16:03] not doing enough
[1:16:06] but the man said god don't make half a
[1:16:07] christian but a christian could be
[1:16:09] halfway
[1:16:09] what he is saying is that that christian
[1:16:11] is not doing enough
[1:16:17] there's a difference between hearing and
[1:16:19] doing and that's what i want to get to
[1:16:21] is not
[1:16:21] have we heard enough
[1:16:26] not have we seen enough
[1:16:29] because we have seen enough we have
[1:16:31] heard enough
[1:16:32] for years we have heard this message we
[1:16:34] have seen what god has done
[1:16:38] have we done enough have you done enough
[1:16:41] have i done enough
[1:16:46] there's a difference between seeing and
[1:16:48] doing um challenging us this morning
[1:16:50] maybe to wake somebody up maybe to stir
[1:16:52] somebody cause when i saw this it got me
[1:16:54] scared
[1:16:56] it got me scared and i could see that
[1:16:59] the prophet now
[1:17:00] he is getting closer his ministry is
[1:17:02] expanding
[1:17:03] and his rears are realizing there's not
[1:17:05] much time left
[1:17:07] and there's so much to do and he can't
[1:17:10] afford to take chances
[1:17:13] it's not how much services you attend
[1:17:15] did i attend
[1:17:16] enough search
[1:17:19] people have attended church and backslid
[1:17:21] and went to the world and cursed this
[1:17:23] message
[1:17:25] people have sat in ministries for years
[1:17:28] and still have the audacity to ill-speak
[1:17:30] ministers
[1:17:31] ill-speak believers
[1:17:34] sat under this ministry not this church
[1:17:37] ministry
[1:17:38] the ministry of this great elijah
[1:17:40] prophet
[1:17:41] malachi 4 5 6. see in luke 17 30.
[1:17:45] revelation 10 7 sit under this
[1:17:49] so it has to go beyond hearing it has to
[1:17:52] go beyond seeing
[1:17:53] because even the prophet said what we've
[1:17:56] seen happen
[1:17:57] should put every soul into action
[1:18:02] that action is the doing part have we
[1:18:06] done
[1:18:06] enough what is the action that you are
[1:18:09] taking
[1:18:11] are we taking enough action are you
[1:18:14] taking enough action am i taking enough
[1:18:16] action it's a challenge to all of us
[1:18:18] here this morning
[1:18:20] i was seeing somebody speaking about
[1:18:23] jesus
[1:18:24] when he was ministering to his disciples
[1:18:27] and he called peter and he called him he
[1:18:28] says i will make you
[1:18:30] fishers of men
[1:18:34] fishermen a minister is supposed to be a
[1:18:39] fisherman
[1:18:42] a believer is supposed to be a fisherman
[1:18:47] i saw one time with the prophet support
[1:18:49] with how many souls he brought to christ
[1:18:53] and i sat there as i was going to say
[1:18:56] how many men have you fished
[1:19:00] because by definition if god is calling
[1:19:02] peter to be a fisherman
[1:19:04] then his success could only be measured
[1:19:06] by how many men he faced
[1:19:09] because that was a commission i call to
[1:19:10] be fishers of men
[1:19:12] i give you power to go and preach the
[1:19:14] gospel take this to every nation
[1:19:17] so failure to do that would have meant
[1:19:19] failure of what the call was
[1:19:22] anybody with me this morning have you
[1:19:24] done enough
[1:19:26] have we done enough have i done enough
[1:19:30] what we have seen happen should put
[1:19:32] every soul into action
[1:19:34] i'm sorry to disappoint you this is not
[1:19:36] one of those jump of the wall services
[1:19:40] this is one of those sirs is this the
[1:19:42] time of the end kind of message
[1:19:44] that we have to relook at what we see we
[1:19:47] look at what we do we look at how we
[1:19:48] live
[1:19:49] we look at how we act and i'm coming to
[1:19:50] your house in a minute
[1:19:53] what we have seen happen should put
[1:19:55] every soul in action it should make a
[1:19:56] church i would make a revival
[1:19:58] so that's a doing part
[1:20:06] that people would fly in from europe to
[1:20:08] see that what taking place they'd say
[1:20:10] there's a
[1:20:10] place in arizona there's something broke
[1:20:12] until the seven thunders of revelation
[1:20:14] 10
[1:20:14] that's not even wrote in the bible is
[1:20:16] being manifested
[1:20:19] there are many people who don't want to
[1:20:20] look for revival i
[1:20:22] i can't force somebody to look for a
[1:20:23] revival
[1:20:25] but you know something about have i done
[1:20:27] enough it means that
[1:20:28] that you could do and do and do and
[1:20:31] realize
[1:20:32] it's not enough
[1:20:35] that's scary yeah let me let me let me
[1:20:37] let me can i take my time a little bit
[1:20:41] the question is that have we learnt
[1:20:42] enough that's not the question
[1:20:46] the question is that have we preached
[1:20:48] enough
[1:20:49] and although these words may be doing
[1:20:52] words or action words or verbs
[1:20:56] there has to be more to it than this
[1:20:58] because of the fact that the prophet was
[1:21:00] making this statement
[1:21:02] after so many years of miracles teaching
[1:21:04] preaching that he was doing
[1:21:06] an assessment he was taking inventory
[1:21:10] more than that friends he wanted to be
[1:21:13] sure
[1:21:14] you see where i read the scripture make
[1:21:16] your calling an election
[1:21:18] sure are you sure today
[1:21:24] are you sure but i brought him in many
[1:21:27] places he said
[1:21:28] he spoke about anybody he would wrap it
[1:21:30] up he said if you were to get called
[1:21:32] right now could you answer
[1:21:37] are you sure the way you spoke to your
[1:21:40] husband this morning
[1:21:42] are you sure the way you spoke to your
[1:21:44] wife are you sure
[1:21:46] do we use death with your children are
[1:21:48] you sure do you conduct yourself in the
[1:21:50] workplace are you sure
[1:21:52] your approach to god are you sure you're
[1:21:55] approaching the ministry are you sure
[1:21:57] that you're ready
[1:21:59] you approach to the scriptures are you
[1:22:00] sure that you are ready
[1:22:02] you're approaching your prayer life are
[1:22:04] you sure that you are ready
[1:22:09] the prophet he was not taking things for
[1:22:11] granted
[1:22:13] the question of not doing raises
[1:22:17] deeper issues the question of not doing
[1:22:22] enough doing enough because he said i
[1:22:26] haven't done enough
[1:22:28] so it is not that he didn't do i want to
[1:22:30] make the point clear
[1:22:32] it is he did he was i didn't do enough
[1:22:35] in other words all my activities
[1:22:39] still haven't reached a level that could
[1:22:42] be enough
[1:22:43] no i wanted i want to drive this home
[1:22:45] friends
[1:22:47] let me take my time here to help us and
[1:22:50] to help the younger people maybe
[1:22:52] when you fail an examination
[1:22:55] it means one thing
[1:22:59] you did not do enough
[1:23:03] it's really simple
[1:23:06] and that is why it is so perplexing how
[1:23:09] children could go through five years of
[1:23:11] school
[1:23:11] and leave school without a certification
[1:23:14] because what it means is they haven't
[1:23:16] done enough
[1:23:18] and i can't take excuses because i heard
[1:23:20] somebody say recently there's a whole
[1:23:22] book on excuses
[1:23:24] but you could for every person who said
[1:23:25] they had a hard time growing up there's
[1:23:27] somebody with a harder time who made it
[1:23:32] anybody with me this morning i'm coming
[1:23:34] to your home now
[1:23:35] recently on the news somewhere i think
[1:23:37] was india or brazil or somewhere
[1:23:39] it went viral of a young boy he was
[1:23:42] studying under a street lamp
[1:23:46] because he had no electricity in his
[1:23:47] house
[1:23:49] but his determination to make it in
[1:23:51] school he would go at night and sit on
[1:23:53] the street lamp where there was light
[1:24:00] and then when you look at him
[1:24:01] successfully wants to know well well
[1:24:02] well
[1:24:03] what is your excuse
[1:24:06] i was sharing with my dad recently a
[1:24:09] lawyer passed away in our country
[1:24:12] and they were giving a recap of his life
[1:24:15] story
[1:24:16] they said he learned the alphabet at 17
[1:24:18] years old
[1:24:22] he learnt the alphabet at 17 years old
[1:24:27] and went on to be one of the most
[1:24:29] prominent lawyers and a judge in
[1:24:30] trinidad and tobago
[1:24:33] what was the difference between him and
[1:24:35] those who went to preschool
[1:24:37] primary school if he didn't even go what
[1:24:39] was the difference
[1:24:41] it is because he had a desire to achieve
[1:24:43] something
[1:24:46] and that desire pushed him against all
[1:24:48] odds so i shared with brother recently i
[1:24:50] said it is consistent in life and
[1:24:53] god and in church it's the same thing
[1:24:55] people who are late for work late for
[1:24:57] church
[1:24:58] many times
[1:25:01] they're laid for everything
[1:25:05] because it's a discipline of behavior
[1:25:08] and god's word brings discipline
[1:25:13] are you ready have a few done enough
[1:25:17] have we done enough am i doing enough
[1:25:22] in other words so i'm bringing a type to
[1:25:25] you now because i want to be careful
[1:25:26] the objective so you understand the
[1:25:28] objective of this message
[1:25:31] i don't want to do and then find out
[1:25:33] what i did was not enough
[1:25:35] that's the problem i have anybody
[1:25:38] with me you come to church all these
[1:25:41] years by the parents read these books
[1:25:43] listen to tapes worship pre-crowd
[1:25:45] and then realize lord i come to the exam
[1:25:50] and your capac
[1:25:53] and that is why you have to move by
[1:25:55] revelation because i was thinking about
[1:25:56] it and we have
[1:25:57] esteemed teachers here
[1:26:00] when every course of study has a
[1:26:03] syllabus or
[1:26:04] curriculum or but it's even am i right
[1:26:06] there's some structure
[1:26:08] of a body of knowledge that you are
[1:26:09] supposed to acquire at the end of the
[1:26:11] journey
[1:26:13] but you know what it is it's impossible
[1:26:16] on the exam to test you on every
[1:26:20] single thing that is in the curriculum
[1:26:22] on any syllabus
[1:26:23] it's almost impossible because the exam
[1:26:25] has a time limit
[1:26:27] so you are forced as a teacher to
[1:26:29] determine what comes in the exam
[1:26:31] anybody with me so if you had this
[1:26:33] experience in school
[1:26:35] sometimes teachers will tell you well in
[1:26:37] the exam we're only going to touch on
[1:26:39] these five topics in the exam
[1:26:41] during the year you would have done 15
[1:26:43] topics we'll be cut testing all 15 so
[1:26:45] so in general these are the areas and
[1:26:47] they give you these focus areas
[1:26:51] but that's what our prophet did also
[1:26:53] because but ibrahim preached many things
[1:26:56] but what is the exam
[1:27:01] what are we being tested on that's a
[1:27:04] deep question because people are going
[1:27:06] to church
[1:27:06] today in many churches and they don't
[1:27:09] know what's coming on the exam
[1:27:11] and they are comfortable thinking that
[1:27:13] my attendance is
[1:27:15] in the requirement for the exam is part
[1:27:18] of it but that's not the exam
[1:27:25] let me put it to you another way do i
[1:27:28] give
[1:27:28] all my money to the poor
[1:27:32] i am nothing if i don't have charity do
[1:27:35] i give my body to be burnt
[1:27:37] do i have all knowledge do i know all
[1:27:40] mysteries
[1:27:42] so it meant that the mystery and the
[1:27:44] knowledge and the body burning and give
[1:27:46] it to the poor
[1:27:47] that's wonderful but that's not the exam
[1:27:52] [Music]
[1:27:55] can i drive home this thing
[1:27:59] it brings a razor sharp focus now you
[1:28:01] could be a super student
[1:28:04] and the students who i know them in
[1:28:05] school they study everything
[1:28:07] they know the five points are coming but
[1:28:08] they know everything else too whatever
[1:28:10] you throw them they're good or not what
[1:28:11] if they're good
[1:28:13] they know everything every answer they
[1:28:15] read a book i think i shared it with the
[1:28:17] church here
[1:28:17] one time i studied so hard for
[1:28:20] combinations
[1:28:22] but a punch i don't know anybody who was
[1:28:24] yesterday they thought of me for coming
[1:28:26] entrance
[1:28:28] to this day i can't remember what yeah i
[1:28:30] do common entrance i can still remember
[1:28:32] the eclipse word for word
[1:28:34] part of my notes from my biology in
[1:28:36] common entrance
[1:28:37] because i took my notebook from common
[1:28:41] entrance
[1:28:42] and i read it and i taped it
[1:28:45] so i could listen back to the notes
[1:28:48] and the fullest part of the tip is the
[1:28:50] party would always listen to it because
[1:28:52] that part always come in first
[1:28:53] so that first part stuck in my head till
[1:28:56] this day i can't even take it out
[1:28:58] i've said it before not all plants and
[1:29:00] animals are eaten
[1:29:02] some die and fall back to the ground
[1:29:04] these dead organic substances are
[1:29:05] reduced as simple as substances the
[1:29:07] process by which this is done it's
[1:29:09] called the key
[1:29:10] decay is caused by small plants and
[1:29:12] bacteria called fungi
[1:29:13] like other living organisms bacteria and
[1:29:15] fungi need food to live
[1:29:16] they cannot get their own food like the
[1:29:18] green plants do so they get their food
[1:29:20] by attacking their plants and animals
[1:29:23] you know what years i leave school but
[1:29:25] for the life of me i can't take it out
[1:29:28] i can't undo it put me in that exam room
[1:29:31] i could still pass that exam
[1:29:33] because i did enough
[1:29:38] to ensure that it's stuck
[1:29:42] no this is the problem if you want to do
[1:29:45] what you want to do
[1:29:47] because brother branham preached many
[1:29:49] things preached about the poor peace
[1:29:51] about rome preaching about the mark of
[1:29:52] the beast
[1:29:53] and a lot of things there's a lot to do
[1:29:54] because as the prophet messenger of the
[1:29:56] age
[1:29:57] he had a responsibility to tie up all
[1:29:59] the loose ends
[1:30:03] but he also had another responsibility
[1:30:05] to prepare bride to leave this place
[1:30:09] so i have no problem with you lord in
[1:30:12] the entire curriculum
[1:30:14] there's nothing wrong with that it's
[1:30:16] wonderful we have food for days you have
[1:30:18] food every day
[1:30:20] but make sure that you pass the exam
[1:30:27] it doesn't make sense you have the
[1:30:29] knowledge and it will pass the exam
[1:30:32] make sure you make the main thing terry
[1:30:34] say make sure you keep the main thing
[1:30:36] the main thing
[1:30:38] everybody with me this morning is this
[1:30:40] helping anybody this morning
[1:30:42] this is not a deep message but it's a
[1:30:45] important one i believe
[1:30:47] have i done enough so i use the example
[1:30:50] of a school child
[1:30:52] so i said in other words the question
[1:30:53] have i done enough is the same question
[1:30:55] a student would ask before walking into
[1:30:58] an exam room
[1:31:00] but by then just as in the spiritual
[1:31:02] realm it's too late
[1:31:06] because you have no time left there's a
[1:31:08] countdown when they say exam started
[1:31:10] exams start boom the time to study is
[1:31:14] over
[1:31:15] the time to take note is over the time
[1:31:18] to ask questions is over
[1:31:19] the time to confirm your approach is
[1:31:21] over at that point you have to perform
[1:31:24] it's the same as he who is filthy filthy
[1:31:26] still he who is righteous righteous
[1:31:28] still
[1:31:28] he he's who knows what's coming in the
[1:31:30] exam and is prepared for the exam
[1:31:32] you can't change it at that point
[1:31:33] because it's already set
[1:31:36] everybody with me this morning have i
[1:31:39] done enough is the same question that
[1:31:41] should be asked by doctors would you
[1:31:44] want to be in an exam room and the
[1:31:45] doctor didn't do enough
[1:31:49] could you imagine i just finished it i
[1:31:52] still have one more course to do
[1:31:55] i still i think the examiner that course
[1:31:57] i was struggling with that course you
[1:31:59] know but
[1:31:59] here is we go try a thing here today how
[1:32:02] would you feel
[1:32:04] you might even get healed your feet
[1:32:06] might get healed
[1:32:08] at that point your feet might get over
[1:32:09] that red to say where you going he
[1:32:11] running straight or your feet make you
[1:32:12] hold this
[1:32:16] because that doctor if nobody but think
[1:32:18] about it a doctor could only speak with
[1:32:20] confidence because they know they have
[1:32:21] done enough
[1:32:22] if you meet that doctor buddy that they
[1:32:24] say what
[1:32:28] [Music]
[1:32:31] yeah this is automatically but here well
[1:32:33] i will get two types or not i'll get it
[1:32:34] and he said a gear prescription too
[1:32:41] so have i done enough is the same
[1:32:42] question that should be asked by doctors
[1:32:45] by teachers by lawyers by engineers by
[1:32:47] presidents by prime ministers
[1:32:49] this whole corona virus situation has
[1:32:51] raised to the four
[1:32:52] countries that have done enough and have
[1:32:54] not done it enough
[1:32:57] it's a real issue it's consistent
[1:32:59] through life
[1:33:02] though countries that did enough see the
[1:33:04] results of it
[1:33:05] the country did not do enough you see
[1:33:07] the results of it
[1:33:11] have i done enough is a question that
[1:33:13] should be asked and answered by husbands
[1:33:17] told her coming home
[1:33:20] but obviously i reach
[1:33:25] i reach have you done enough
[1:33:30] speaking to the husbands
[1:33:34] have you done enough
[1:33:38] is it a 40 percent is it a 50
[1:33:41] is it a 58 is it a trial my best
[1:33:47] as a father have you done enough
[1:33:51] we're inside the house now as a mother
[1:33:54] have you done enough
[1:33:58] as a wife have you done enough
[1:34:01] because these are great responsibilities
[1:34:04] they are not accidental
[1:34:07] it is responsible yet are given to you
[1:34:10] whether you think you're ready or not
[1:34:11] and you have to step up to the task
[1:34:15] and ensure that you do enough
[1:34:18] whether you were taught or not is still
[1:34:20] required to do
[1:34:30] have i done enough
[1:34:35] as you dig deeper into these things you
[1:34:37] realize sometimes it's some
[1:34:38] sometimes the question becomes more
[1:34:40] important are the answers
[1:34:43] because many of us we don't ask the deep
[1:34:45] questions
[1:34:46] for us to change our behavior
[1:34:49] somebody said to me and i'm not feeling
[1:34:51] the anointing
[1:34:52] out of the spirit have you done enough
[1:34:57] because what will work for me may not
[1:35:00] work for you
[1:35:01] you have to know if you doing enough if
[1:35:03] this thing really mean
[1:35:05] all to you
[1:35:09] anybody with me
[1:35:14] put another way what more can you do
[1:35:19] put another way what more should you do
[1:35:22] put another way what more must you do
[1:35:29] it is real friends
[1:35:33] and on this one question hinge is
[1:35:36] rapture
[1:35:36] no rapture on this one question hinges
[1:35:40] you making it and not making it
[1:35:46] because back when the death angel was
[1:35:47] passing through the land but abandoned
[1:35:49] made it clear he said
[1:35:50] the death angel wasn't asking the
[1:35:52] question what tribe he belonged to
[1:35:54] it was have you done enough because the
[1:35:57] requirement was clear on what to do
[1:36:00] it was not even based on your identity
[1:36:02] or your identification
[1:36:04] it was not based on your tribe or your
[1:36:06] belief
[1:36:07] because the belief and the tribe should
[1:36:09] have led you into action
[1:36:11] so the test was no longer belief and
[1:36:13] tribe the test was
[1:36:14] action have you done enough
[1:36:19] take the blood and put it on the
[1:36:20] doorpost i could imagine
[1:36:23] a dead angel is passing through the land
[1:36:24] the children in the house saying daddy
[1:36:26] did we do enough
[1:36:27] that firstborn child who know that if
[1:36:30] this thing wasn't done correctly
[1:36:33] i'm the one in trouble because it's dead
[1:36:35] to the firstborn
[1:36:36] for saying daddy did we do enough are
[1:36:38] you are you sure
[1:36:41] did did we put it on the right way did
[1:36:43] we take his open
[1:36:44] did we did we get alarm without blemish
[1:36:46] did we did we did we
[1:36:48] put everything in place because i'm
[1:36:49] hearing cries coming up a road
[1:36:51] coming closer to us have we done enough
[1:36:54] daddy have you done enough have i done
[1:36:56] enough because we know what's coming
[1:37:01] think back to the days of noah god have
[1:37:03] the family in the ark they're locked in
[1:37:05] the ark
[1:37:06] but ibrahim said it daddy are you sure
[1:37:09] we did all that god asked us to do are
[1:37:12] you sure
[1:37:13] this boat is going to survive are you
[1:37:15] sure that this is what we're supposed to
[1:37:17] do
[1:37:19] have we done enough
[1:37:25] elders ministers deacons
[1:37:29] mothers have you prayed enough
[1:37:33] fathers have you prayed enough deacons
[1:37:36] have you prayed enough
[1:37:41] believers have you prayed enough have
[1:37:44] you done enough
[1:37:50] what more should you do what more must
[1:37:52] you do
[1:37:55] throughout scripture back in genesis we
[1:37:57] see abel
[1:37:58] under revelation preparing to make his
[1:38:01] sacrifice
[1:38:02] trying to make sure that everything is
[1:38:04] in place wondering have i done enough
[1:38:07] and i can see the peace that came over
[1:38:09] abel when god accepted his sacrifice
[1:38:12] it was enough cain also brought a
[1:38:16] sacrifice
[1:38:18] but it was not enough
[1:38:22] is your sacrifice enough
[1:38:26] the bible says we bring a sacrifice of
[1:38:27] praise into the house of the lord it
[1:38:29] says this is not a jump on shout service
[1:38:34] it is a shake a reality in us that the
[1:38:37] things that we fight for and think may
[1:38:38] be important
[1:38:39] may not be as important as you think
[1:38:51] the rich young ruler came to jesus
[1:38:56] see what motion what what what what else
[1:38:59] can i do
[1:39:00] to have this eternal life to enter the
[1:39:02] kingdom of god he's true so jesus said
[1:39:04] to him
[1:39:06] keep the commandments he said but i've
[1:39:08] done all that
[1:39:10] so it was not like he wasn't doing he
[1:39:12] was in a backseating condition he was
[1:39:13] doing
[1:39:13] all that he was supposed to do and then
[1:39:15] when god realized when he realized that
[1:39:17] he was really looking now to make sure
[1:39:19] he had done everything he could do
[1:39:21] this is beyond the law now this is
[1:39:24] beyond the law
[1:39:25] this is now dealing with the inner man
[1:39:27] the man on the inside that nobody could
[1:39:28] see
[1:39:30] now god could discern to him there's
[1:39:32] more that you need to do you haven't
[1:39:33] done enough
[1:39:37] can i keep bringing it home so he was
[1:39:39] perfectly legal
[1:39:42] by the letter of the law as the pastor
[1:39:44] said he did all the commandments
[1:39:48] but this wasn't a law thing anymore
[1:39:51] all right can anybody with me they were
[1:39:53] alerting
[1:39:54] his satire a desire in his heart it was
[1:39:56] a little too much
[1:39:58] that was pushing down the place of god
[1:40:00] in his heart i got to say go sell all
[1:40:01] you have
[1:40:02] and the bible said he he left sorrowful
[1:40:07] but he was still
[1:40:08] trying to get this same question
[1:40:10] answered have i
[1:40:12] done enough
[1:40:15] nicodemus hiding out secret meeting
[1:40:21] he want to make sure that this eternal
[1:40:24] life
[1:40:25] this thing i come into church all these
[1:40:27] years i believe all these years good
[1:40:29] master
[1:40:29] how can i is that how you came to church
[1:40:32] this morning
[1:40:34] you want to be sure that you make any
[1:40:35] rapture not sure you're making church a
[1:40:38] lot of people this morning
[1:40:39] there are a lot of people who will
[1:40:41] mislead your friends
[1:40:43] this is real i want to bring this home
[1:40:46] with all these shouts and singing
[1:40:47] writing songs interpreting the word
[1:40:49] divine mystery
[1:40:50] will miss the rapture because they have
[1:40:53] not done enough
[1:40:55] god is no respecter of persons he is a
[1:40:58] respecter
[1:40:58] of his examination
[1:41:08] we know it matthew 25 10 virgins
[1:41:12] but a random nail this down ten versions
[1:41:14] five wise
[1:41:15] five foolish virgin he said chased
[1:41:18] pure you can't impute sin on them
[1:41:27] and it's very simple five did enough
[1:41:31] and five didn't do enough
[1:41:34] very very simple ahmed ibrahim said
[1:41:37] that what the oil the extra oil that
[1:41:40] extra
[1:41:41] that extra that was what made the
[1:41:44] difference
[1:41:47] so when god weighed in the balance what
[1:41:50] they were presenting
[1:41:51] he said the ones with oil they can make
[1:41:53] it they're ready to go
[1:41:56] and just like the exam we talked about
[1:41:57] it was too late now to add
[1:41:59] to your knowledge to your revelation to
[1:42:01] your character to your life
[1:42:03] because the call had come exam start
[1:42:05] time to go
[1:42:15] i'm not going to be too much longer with
[1:42:16] you
[1:42:19] i want to make sure that this
[1:42:24] this thing resonates in your heart that
[1:42:25] you need to do it more
[1:42:29] but abraham would speak many times of
[1:42:30] people who
[1:42:32] would come by to be healed and he said
[1:42:35] that they didn't have
[1:42:37] enough feet so he was making a point
[1:42:40] about doing enough having enough
[1:42:41] achieving enough
[1:42:42] so they had fear to know but it was not
[1:42:45] enough
[1:42:48] i want to challenge the church this
[1:42:49] morning there are people who have a
[1:42:50] testimony but they need to do more
[1:42:53] that testimony is not enough
[1:42:59] i want to challenge you thinking a
[1:43:01] little bit i was doing some research on
[1:43:04] the olympics and the way people train
[1:43:07] for the olympics
[1:43:09] and one athlete was saying that they try
[1:43:12] to figure out what they could do that
[1:43:14] they think the competition is not doing
[1:43:18] so it's not just about doing enough to
[1:43:20] make it now they want to do extra
[1:43:22] because they want to be sure that's the
[1:43:24] same thing with the
[1:43:25] wise version because they had extra they
[1:43:27] wanted to be sure
[1:43:28] what extra now i'm pushing beyond enough
[1:43:30] now to what extra are you doing
[1:43:33] on a daily basis to bring you closer
[1:43:36] to your destination what action did you
[1:43:39] do this week
[1:43:54] i know some people think that
[1:43:58] there's a lot of mysteries and different
[1:44:00] things and ideas and things and things
[1:44:01] but
[1:44:01] did you pray every day
[1:44:04] did you talk to god every day the way he
[1:44:07] would come long and cool in the evening
[1:44:08] with adam
[1:44:10] have you done that every day
[1:44:13] because an athlete who is getting ready
[1:44:15] for a competition trains every day
[1:44:18] have you prayed every day have you read
[1:44:21] the bible every day
[1:44:22] have you forgiven every day then you
[1:44:24] haven't done enough
[1:44:28] we feel in small exams how you will pass
[1:44:30] a big one
[1:44:33] situations come to us to forgive and
[1:44:35] you're all in stuff
[1:44:38] how we expect to pass a big exam and you
[1:44:40] can't forgive
[1:44:46] god sending all these exams to you every
[1:44:49] week
[1:44:50] upset and stop allowing stuff in your
[1:44:52] life to be upset
[1:44:53] and test comment little test
[1:44:54] communication with the children the
[1:44:56] bills the house eating
[1:44:58] and small tests
[1:45:04] have you done enough so i'm not just
[1:45:07] talking about praying and reading now
[1:45:09] but it's the daily life i want to get to
[1:45:11] because that's a test
[1:45:14] listen let me make it there's no rapture
[1:45:16] to go if a husband can't show love to
[1:45:18] his wife
[1:45:19] forget rapture forget it if your wife
[1:45:23] cannot reverence the husband
[1:45:24] there's no rapture
[1:45:29] because it's a life oh you don't hear me
[1:45:33] this morning
[1:45:37] children obeying their parents that's a
[1:45:39] life
[1:45:43] more so and especially out on top of
[1:45:45] that if the community helps you lord
[1:45:47] and the and you know they want you you
[1:45:48] want one best for you
[1:45:52] i thought it's not a short job message
[1:45:56] this question is hinging on your calling
[1:45:58] and election being sure
[1:46:00] have you done enough
[1:46:06] i don't want this to go on the road of
[1:46:07] having regret now because there's
[1:46:09] nothing we can do about the past
[1:46:11] we can't change the past what we did or
[1:46:15] did not do
[1:46:16] yesterday is already finished
[1:46:19] but the question from no no no no
[1:46:25] how much more time will you pray for
[1:46:27] your children
[1:46:28] how much more time would you spend
[1:46:30] praying for the holy ghost
[1:46:31] how much more time will you pray crying
[1:46:33] out for revival
[1:46:34] how much more time would you spend
[1:46:36] tearing off the tv it's not just what
[1:46:38] you do is what what you didn't do
[1:46:43] you're following all the political news
[1:46:44] you know everything with every candidate
[1:46:51] really now in this season
[1:46:57] have you done enough have i done enough
[1:47:00] have we done enough
[1:47:07] throughout life and history we find this
[1:47:10] recurring situation of doing enough
[1:47:12] and not doing enough many people who
[1:47:15] have achieved have done so against a
[1:47:17] backdrop of
[1:47:18] major disadvantages in life because they
[1:47:21] persevered to do everything they could
[1:47:22] do to achieve
[1:47:23] what they wanted if you remember the
[1:47:25] time that brother branham gave the story
[1:47:27] of the man who who he had a
[1:47:28] colored slave or whatever and he said he
[1:47:30] wanted to get the holy ghost because he
[1:47:31] saw the
[1:47:32] arrival on his man life and he said
[1:47:35] carry me i want to get the holy ghost
[1:47:37] and he carried him and show him he said
[1:47:39] well if you want to
[1:47:40] have to come come come come and when
[1:47:43] they reach a pigsty
[1:47:44] he said that we have to go recognize
[1:47:50] that he had to wonder if he really
[1:47:51] wanted
[1:47:52] if he was willing to do enough
[1:47:56] the very spirit of this layout to see an
[1:47:59] age
[1:48:00] is they believe they have arrived
[1:48:05] they believe they have need of nothing
[1:48:08] and that spirit is in the message
[1:48:11] we have a prophet we have a message we
[1:48:13] have and people walking around not doing
[1:48:14] what they're supposed to do
[1:48:16] they believe they have done enough i
[1:48:18] want to read the scripture slowly
[1:48:19] somebody slow down and take it can we
[1:48:21] talk a little bit more
[1:48:24] and unto the angel of the church of the
[1:48:25] laodiceans right revelation 3
[1:48:27] 14 these things say the amen the
[1:48:30] faithful and true witness
[1:48:31] the beginning of the creation of god i
[1:48:34] know thy works
[1:48:36] so i know thy works is now speaking
[1:48:38] about your activities
[1:48:39] about what you're doing thou art neither
[1:48:41] cold nor hot
[1:48:43] so it's not that people not doing stuff
[1:48:48] but they're not doing it all the way
[1:48:50] that's what the bible is saying
[1:48:51] come and take it slowly i would that dog
[1:48:54] were cold or hot
[1:48:57] so then because they were lukewarm i and
[1:48:59] neither call no heart i will spew the
[1:49:01] out of my mouth
[1:49:04] how zealous are you for the gospel i'm
[1:49:06] tired of hearing people talking about
[1:49:07] how it used to be
[1:49:09] and how zealous they used to be and i'm
[1:49:10] excited and they should testify when
[1:49:12] last of you testified that i have
[1:49:13] nothing to do with the church after you
[1:49:17] if you're not testifying every day but a
[1:49:19] branham said you're going to end up back
[1:49:20] sitting
[1:49:23] that is a daily part on this we have
[1:49:25] failed friends
[1:49:29] we have not done enough
[1:49:32] well last year testified to somebody
[1:49:35] some of us 10 years ago somewhere 20
[1:49:37] years ago somebody first come to the
[1:49:38] message
[1:49:38] and then and then what happened what's
[1:49:41] your excuse
[1:49:45] what's your excuse so then because our
[1:49:48] lukewarm
[1:49:49] what is it it's lukewarm because if
[1:49:52] you're truly passionate about something
[1:49:54] and you believe in something it'll be on
[1:49:56] your lips every day
[1:49:57] the end is here time is upon us
[1:50:04] see people love to hear this stuff about
[1:50:06] what they could get and what they will
[1:50:07] get and what they will be and what they
[1:50:09] will do
[1:50:10] but what are you doing now because to do
[1:50:13] then you have to do now
[1:50:14] to have them you must do now to live
[1:50:17] there you must do now
[1:50:20] he said only perfect love will be over
[1:50:22] there so if you do a perfect love now
[1:50:23] don't talk about over there
[1:50:24] until you fix it here fix it in your
[1:50:27] home
[1:50:28] fix it in your life
[1:50:38] this is a hard message you're preaching
[1:50:39] is not a message that that people want
[1:50:40] to run and preach
[1:50:44] have you done enough tell me yesterday
[1:50:48] what you did for the kingdom
[1:50:52] tell me what did you do yesterday for
[1:50:54] the kingdom of god
[1:50:56] and did you do all that you could do
[1:51:00] and on friday what did you do for the
[1:51:02] kingdom what did he do for your soul
[1:51:04] what did he do for your house what did
[1:51:05] he do for your life what did he do for
[1:51:07] your children for your marriage
[1:51:09] because all that is the basic family
[1:51:11] unit that god placed there in the garden
[1:51:12] of eden
[1:51:13] oh body work and the commitment and the
[1:51:16] pills
[1:51:17] that has its place too but don't
[1:51:19] compromise this thing
[1:51:22] make sure and keep the main thing the
[1:51:23] main thing friends
[1:51:26] that's why they said what shall the
[1:51:26] prophet the man to gain the whole world
[1:51:28] and to lose his soul
[1:51:29] because to lose your soul it meant he
[1:51:31] didn't do enough
[1:51:34] because you have to make your calling an
[1:51:35] election show
[1:51:37] i want to drive this home friends
[1:51:40] because the weak excuses god had taken
[1:51:42] it
[1:51:44] we saw it with moses moses city i say i
[1:51:46] can't talk and when he was done
[1:51:48] god says still going and god is showing
[1:51:50] and not accepting excuses
[1:51:52] there's no excuse for not having a
[1:51:54] prayer alive there's no excuse
[1:51:56] there's i want to say it again there is
[1:51:58] no excuse to not having a prayer life
[1:52:01] there is nothing you can present today
[1:52:03] of not having a prayer life
[1:52:07] i want to drill it to the church this
[1:52:09] morning
[1:52:11] no excuse for not reading the scriptures
[1:52:14] every day
[1:52:15] not by every day people do what they
[1:52:17] want to do
[1:52:18] make time to watch the news make time to
[1:52:20] watch your papers make time to call
[1:52:22] relatives
[1:52:23] turn the phone down and read your bible
[1:52:25] read the prophet message
[1:52:27] go and pray pray with your family talk
[1:52:29] to your husband
[1:52:30] talk to your wife call your children
[1:52:35] that's what i'm talking about that's the
[1:52:37] foundation of church
[1:52:38] wasting time gossiping foolishness
[1:52:44] have we done enough have you done enough
[1:52:46] have i done enough
[1:52:47] i'm preaching to this church i don't
[1:52:48] care what anybody else does this is
[1:52:50] sovereign
[1:52:51] i want to make it i want to be there in
[1:52:53] the rapture i want to be sure
[1:52:55] that i do all that i could do i don't
[1:52:57] want to go on here see
[1:53:00] i don't want to go on anybody else's
[1:53:01] revelation it has to be what the tapes
[1:53:04] say
[1:53:04] nothing else i don't care about nothing
[1:53:06] else give me liberty or give me death
[1:53:11] you may be seated on this same message
[1:53:15] on december the 10th 1962 but abraham
[1:53:18] said if you're unsure about something
[1:53:20] go listen back in the tape he said it
[1:53:23] clearly he says he don't say anything if
[1:53:25] you're not
[1:53:26] sure about it go back to the tape
[1:53:29] he put it on the tape for a reason
[1:53:39] have you done enough have we done enough
[1:53:43] have i done enough
[1:53:49] and seen it in a natural bit of george
[1:53:51] i'm seeing it in the spiritual
[1:53:53] people sit down in the workplace from a
[1:53:56] certain time to a certain time
[1:53:58] what's different between one employee
[1:54:00] and another employee
[1:54:02] what makes one more productive and the
[1:54:03] other productive
[1:54:05] what's the difference what are the
[1:54:08] things that separate people who are
[1:54:09] experts and professionals from those who
[1:54:11] are not
[1:54:12] and those same principles apply in the
[1:54:14] spiritual realm
[1:54:16] if you can't find time to pray what does
[1:54:18] that make you
[1:54:19] what's the difference because everybody
[1:54:21] have the same 24 hours
[1:54:23] so it's not as if japan who is praying
[1:54:25] has more time than you
[1:54:27] let me say that again is he seeing 24
[1:54:30] hours
[1:54:31] the man who has the most
[1:54:32] responsibilities and a man with no
[1:54:34] responsibility have the same 24 hours
[1:54:39] they're people with a little small shop
[1:54:41] and they can't figure out how to run
[1:54:42] this workshop
[1:54:43] and i have somebody with 800 businesses
[1:54:46] and in the same general was running this
[1:54:48] company that company that company
[1:54:51] what what is the difference does it seem
[1:54:53] 24 hours you know
[1:54:57] what they have done they have found ways
[1:54:58] to do more with their time
[1:55:01] they have found ways to prioritize
[1:55:03] what's important but what's not
[1:55:05] they don't have time to waste
[1:55:09] they don't have time to waste and that's
[1:55:11] what this message is about the brand of
[1:55:12] spirit you say sir this is santa the end
[1:55:14] time
[1:55:15] it's later than we think so if it's
[1:55:17] later than we think it means we need to
[1:55:19] do more with the little time we have
[1:55:21] whatever we are missing we need to get
[1:55:23] it fixed now
[1:55:32] fix your attitude fix your spirit
[1:55:35] fix your tone fix your approach but i
[1:55:37] believe when you approach to god
[1:55:39] he said i'd rather you be wrong in
[1:55:41] doctrine and
[1:55:43] right in spirit than right in doctrine
[1:55:46] and wrong in spirit in the word god
[1:55:48] rates the rightness of your spirit more
[1:55:50] than your belief
[1:55:52] because if you have the right spirit he
[1:55:53] could show you things that you never saw
[1:55:55] before
[1:55:56] but having the wrong spirit nothing will
[1:55:58] open your eyes because you have an
[1:55:59] approach to things
[1:56:00] that will destroy you and if that
[1:56:03] applies in the spiritual realm
[1:56:04] so it isn't natural you could be right
[1:56:06] as the husband any house
[1:56:08] but you have your wrong spirit with it
[1:56:10] oh come on now can i
[1:56:11] can i come back home now you could be
[1:56:13] right as your wife for the hobbit have
[1:56:15] you wrong spirit how
[1:56:16] god sees it in the same way
[1:56:25] listen church the home issues have to
[1:56:28] fix
[1:56:30] the issue with parents and children have
[1:56:32] to fix
[1:56:33] between brother and sister have to fix
[1:56:36] between bridge and have to fix
[1:56:38] because these things carla survive over
[1:56:41] there
[1:56:42] the kingdom is allergic to that kind of
[1:56:44] thing
[1:56:51] can the church say man i'm not going to
[1:56:53] wait too much longer
[1:56:56] i said i read the scripture here in
[1:56:57] revelation i know thy words that
[1:57:00] was neither cold nor hot i would that
[1:57:02] would cold or hot
[1:57:03] but because though it's lukewarm i need
[1:57:06] a cold heart i will spew the out of my
[1:57:08] mouth
[1:57:09] and it goes on because i am rich
[1:57:12] and increased with goods and have need
[1:57:14] of nothing and knoweth
[1:57:16] not that they are wretched and miserable
[1:57:18] and poor
[1:57:19] and blind and naked
[1:57:23] how many people in church right now
[1:57:24] think they have it all
[1:57:26] and have it put together and on the
[1:57:28] right track
[1:57:30] we'd have time to go into it in this
[1:57:32] service but friends if you go to the
[1:57:34] world and you look carefully
[1:57:35] at how the prophet lived and how far up
[1:57:39] we have gone
[1:57:40] from it for my life
[1:57:43] not having the quotes not having the
[1:57:46] books
[1:57:47] not having the tips but the life
[1:57:50] asking what would jesus do how would he
[1:57:53] handle this situation
[1:57:55] how would he deal with this when we hear
[1:57:57] that you couldn't tell the prophet's
[1:57:59] friends from his enemies god help us you
[1:58:02] know
[1:58:03] because we we we know and near there
[1:58:10] holy prophet would humble himself
[1:58:13] look at jesus i shared this before jesus
[1:58:16] the bible said
[1:58:17] when he went to open the scroll after
[1:58:19] coming off
[1:58:21] from being tested and he took the
[1:58:24] scripture to read
[1:58:26] the spirit of the lord is upon me the
[1:58:27] bible said it was his custom
[1:58:29] to be in the temple so it meant that
[1:58:32] from age 12 to age
[1:58:33] 30 jesus was present in every service
[1:58:37] because it was his custom to be in the
[1:58:39] temple
[1:58:42] can this sit home so it meant jesus the
[1:58:44] word
[1:58:45] made flesh sat in church
[1:58:48] for 18 years we call it the 18 years of
[1:58:51] silence
[1:58:52] and he said nothing while priests
[1:58:56] high priests junior priests aspiring
[1:58:59] priests
[1:58:59] would read the scrolls about him and he
[1:59:02] said nothing
[1:59:03] whether they were right whether they
[1:59:05] were wrong whether they were
[1:59:06] interpreting it whether they were
[1:59:07] injecting their own feelings he sat
[1:59:09] there and did nothing
[1:59:13] can we do that
[1:59:17] can we hear people lie about us
[1:59:20] and not respond
[1:59:24] can we watch people tell stuff about us
[1:59:26] that we know is not true or they get it
[1:59:28] the wrong way and not do anything about
[1:59:29] it
[1:59:31] because brother branham spoke about i
[1:59:32] say if the spirit of john dillinger is
[1:59:34] on you you'll deliver that we say we're
[1:59:35] supposed to be dead to christ
[1:59:38] that whatever people say there's no
[1:59:39] response he's a dead man he said if you
[1:59:41] get up from there and say well that's
[1:59:42] not me you're still alive
[1:59:45] i'll remember that in the message right
[1:59:47] so can
[1:59:48] have you can we reach that point where
[1:59:50] people could say stuff about us and we
[1:59:52] don't respond
[1:59:54] all that has passed have we done enough
[1:59:55] you know
[2:00:00] i'm bringing back to your memory what we
[2:00:02] know already
[2:00:06] have we done enough so that when we can
[2:00:09] stand and give an account as it were
[2:00:11] we could say lord and i read the
[2:00:13] scripture from
[2:00:14] paul i've finished my course
[2:00:17] i've run a good race i've done all he
[2:00:20] asked me to do
[2:00:22] and even the prophet felt comfort
[2:00:23] because he said when he was wandering
[2:00:25] about things he said i preach what paul
[2:00:26] preached
[2:00:27] so we are resting on that so the prophet
[2:00:30] in his ministry would reach that level
[2:00:31] of comfort
[2:00:32] that he did what he was supposed to do
[2:00:34] so when he was saying in 1962 i was it
[2:00:37] what have i done enough or haven't done
[2:00:39] enough when the prophet left he did
[2:00:41] everything he was supposed to do can the
[2:00:43] church say man because god don't take a
[2:00:45] man unless his ministry is finished
[2:00:48] where are we standing at friends i'm not
[2:00:50] going to be too much longer
[2:00:52] revelation 3 we're still there i counsel
[2:00:55] thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire
[2:00:58] that thou mayest be rich so he said the
[2:01:00] people who feel they established they're
[2:01:02] not established
[2:01:03] i constantly to buy of me go try it in
[2:01:05] the fire that thou
[2:01:06] mayest be rich and white raymond that
[2:01:09] thou mayest be clothed
[2:01:11] because the clothes you have on your
[2:01:12] naked and you think you have clothes and
[2:01:15] you don't know it
[2:01:16] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[2:01:18] appear
[2:01:20] i don't know in their eyes what i say
[2:01:22] that don't may i see as many as i love i
[2:01:24] rebuke and chase and be zealous
[2:01:26] therefore
[2:01:27] and repent
[2:01:31] have we done enough friends jesus
[2:01:35] fulfilled the word for his d
[2:01:37] brother branham fulfilled the word for
[2:01:39] his day every prophet fulfilled the word
[2:01:42] for their day when jesus came he was
[2:01:45] more than enough
[2:01:47] he was more than enough he did more than
[2:01:51] enough
[2:01:52] against his own will he will always be
[2:01:55] more than enough with what he did it was
[2:01:58] enough to break the power of sin forever
[2:02:01] it was enough to
[2:02:03] to not have to have to face death
[2:02:05] because now paul could say
[2:02:06] grave where is your sting the death
[2:02:08] waves in victory it was
[2:02:09] more than enough when he came he shot
[2:02:12] them out of the devil for all them years
[2:02:14] and they were moving through
[2:02:16] the satan struggling fighting up with
[2:02:18] this prophet this will work but when
[2:02:20] jesus came
[2:02:21] he brought the perfect antidote to the
[2:02:23] whole sin question
[2:02:25] that started there in genesis can the
[2:02:27] church say amen
[2:02:28] oh hallelujah when jesus came there was
[2:02:31] nothing
[2:02:32] else that needed to come because he was
[2:02:33] the fullness of what the prophet spoke
[2:02:35] about
[2:02:35] he was the fullness he was a the very
[2:02:38] mystery of god
[2:02:39] had long been made flesh the very
[2:02:41] presence of god had now been made
[2:02:43] evident
[2:02:43] come the church shame amen and when
[2:02:45] jesus was in his ministry
[2:02:47] he said my always not yet come in other
[2:02:49] words i haven't finished yet
[2:02:50] my always not here come don't touch me
[2:02:53] don't take me oh
[2:02:54] don't tell nobody about me what was he
[2:02:56] doing he knew what that line was
[2:02:59] that would be enough he was pushing back
[2:03:01] sickness
[2:03:02] he was pushing back diseases he went and
[2:03:04] took that man called
[2:03:05] that had those demons upon him legion he
[2:03:08] went to the other side
[2:03:09] to the maniac of gadara as it was he
[2:03:11] cast out those devils but he knew that
[2:03:13] was not enough
[2:03:15] oh come on now somebody say amen
[2:03:18] oh when jairo's daughter died and she
[2:03:21] came back to life
[2:03:22] he knew that was not enough he was
[2:03:24] moving towards something
[2:03:26] oh come on somebody preach back to me
[2:03:29] preach back to me the people hungry
[2:03:32] they're hungry
[2:03:33] he said what you have they say what we
[2:03:35] have is not enough
[2:03:37] oh we only have five loaves and two
[2:03:39] fishes he said bring it
[2:03:40] i'll make it more than enough i can take
[2:03:43] the little that you have
[2:03:44] and bring you to more than enough he
[2:03:46] took it he prayed for it
[2:03:48] he blessed him he said and when he
[2:03:50] started to share
[2:03:52] those five loaves and two fishes they
[2:03:54] realized what the terence
[2:03:55] that it was more than enough oh come on
[2:03:57] somebody
[2:03:58] preached back to me this morning oh
[2:04:01] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:04:05] oh my my mama you may be seated
[2:04:10] and you read a true scripture jesus bill
[2:04:12] into something
[2:04:13] and i've said before he didn't come just
[2:04:15] to heal the sick he didn't come just to
[2:04:17] raise the dead he didn't come to heal of
[2:04:19] the broken heart
[2:04:20] but when jesus was going to calvary and
[2:04:22] they thought he was about to be finished
[2:04:24] he knew he was going to hit that line
[2:04:26] that was going to make his presence
[2:04:28] enough oh come on now he knew he was
[2:04:31] honing in under something
[2:04:32] honing in into something and when they
[2:04:34] put him on the cross
[2:04:36] and he said it is finished he knew that
[2:04:39] he had done enough
[2:04:40] because when he said it is finished he
[2:04:42] meant it is enough
[2:04:43] i've done what i came here to do oh the
[2:04:46] sin question is answered
[2:04:48] when they could come for you they can't
[2:04:50] touch you anymore because to get to you
[2:04:52] they have to get through
[2:04:53] me oh hallelujah by his stripes we are
[2:04:56] now
[2:04:56] healed when the nails are in his hand
[2:04:58] and he's totally saying it is finished
[2:05:01] it was more than enough and it still
[2:05:04] didn't stop there
[2:05:05] it still didn't end there it was not
[2:05:08] finished there
[2:05:08] because when they put him in the grave
[2:05:10] he was not in the grave
[2:05:12] he dropped them to the lower reasons
[2:05:14] because he had more to do
[2:05:15] he was not satisfied with just a sin
[2:05:18] question being answered he wanted to do
[2:05:20] more than enough
[2:05:21] he went now to hell to where nobody else
[2:05:24] could have gone
[2:05:24] to do what nobody else could have done
[2:05:26] and took the keys
[2:05:28] took the keys of death took the keys of
[2:05:30] death
[2:05:31] took the keys of death so you could have
[2:05:34] life and have it more abundantly took
[2:05:35] the keys of death
[2:05:36] so that death has no power over the
[2:05:38] blood washed ones took the keys of death
[2:05:41] that death is now subject to us took the
[2:05:43] keys of death
[2:05:44] and the keys of hell
[2:05:47] oh hallelujah he unlocked those doors
[2:05:50] he unlocked those doors he unlocked
[2:05:52] those doors
[2:05:53] he unlocked all those doors all those
[2:05:56] who are there who said that's the wheel
[2:05:58] in the middle of the wheel
[2:05:59] that's a rock beneath the rocker he took
[2:06:01] the keys
[2:06:02] and he opened up every door and when the
[2:06:04] devil tries to put you in jail
[2:06:06] he has no keys to lock you in that jail
[2:06:08] jesus already did that
[2:06:10] he's not doing it and what he did back
[2:06:12] there is more than enough for today
[2:06:14] he doesn't have to do it again it is
[2:06:16] already done
[2:06:18] it is already finished
[2:06:22] anybody with me oh i'm now starting to
[2:06:24] preach and now starting to preach
[2:06:26] all that is just background because we
[2:06:28] are going to do enough we are not going

[2:08:47] but we are just getting started we are
[2:08:50] just warming up
[2:08:51] we are now getting ready satan you
[2:08:54] haven't seen
[2:08:54] anything yet you have not seen anything
[2:08:57] yet
[2:08:58] there's been churches churches prides
[2:09:00] prize churches prize
[2:09:01] but there must come one with dynamics
[2:09:04] and mechanics
[2:09:05] together
[2:09:06] [Applause]
[2:09:16] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:09:19] hallelujah so i wanted to shake you
[2:09:22] for the first part of the service for
[2:09:24] you to realize that there's no room for
[2:09:26] laziness
[2:09:27] there's no room for setting back there's
[2:09:29] no room for a pity party
[2:09:31] there's no room for what happened
[2:09:32] yesterday there's no room for how it
[2:09:34] used to be
[2:09:34] it is going for whatever backward never
[2:09:38] the devil must see smoke smoke because
[2:09:41] you're moving so fast
[2:09:42] into your position moving so fast into
[2:09:46] your authority
[2:09:47] move i shot glory
[2:10:02] [Music]
[2:10:04] [Applause]
[2:10:05] [Music]
[2:10:06] [Applause]
[2:10:12] maybe
[2:10:17] [Applause]
[2:10:18] [Music]
[2:10:19] [Applause]
[2:10:29] [Applause]
[2:10:39] [Music]
[2:10:40] listen jesus's first miracle
[2:10:44] didn't move the devil
[2:10:50] his first miracle didn't move the devil
[2:10:52] because the devil was used to miracles
[2:10:53] by the cliff
[2:10:54] over all the ages you know there were
[2:10:57] many signs
[2:10:58] there were many signs through the ages
[2:11:00] there were many things that took place
[2:11:01] through the ages
[2:11:02] can the church say amen but as jesus
[2:11:05] ministry began to expand
[2:11:07] and expand is that i get more and more
[2:11:10] is that i reached a critical mass that
[2:11:12] the devil's kingdoms had to go haywire
[2:11:14] he said this is becoming a little too
[2:11:16] much the conspiracy to kill jesus
[2:11:19] came in the later part of his ministry
[2:11:22] because it was becoming too much
[2:11:24] it was becoming a bit much
[2:11:32] when jesus died the devil thought enough
[2:11:35] is enough
[2:11:37] he thought it was finished but even that
[2:11:39] in the economy of god was small
[2:11:42] because he was going to reproduce
[2:11:43] himself so when jesus died in devil
[2:11:46] thinking it's over
[2:11:47] and in the upper room by the sheen and
[2:11:49] they're there for fear
[2:11:51] of what is going on around them bear in
[2:11:53] mind peter and all these
[2:11:56] jesus told peter that you will deny me
[2:11:59] you know how peter would have felt
[2:12:06] you know you know what a feeling it is
[2:12:07] bro punch after you see all that and say
[2:12:10] you're gonna before they call craig
[2:12:11] you're gonna
[2:12:11] know me peter wants to say no no way
[2:12:15] knowing peter and peter are probably
[2:12:16] saying not even anybody
[2:12:19] not me peter didn't realize you see and
[2:12:23] this is it
[2:12:24] god allows situations to come to show
[2:12:26] your vulnerability without him
[2:12:30] you see you can only know your
[2:12:32] vulnerability when situations come you
[2:12:33] know
[2:12:36] you see you don't know what you don't
[2:12:37] know
[2:12:43] you don't know what you don't know
[2:12:46] that's why you could you must never
[2:12:48] judge people
[2:12:50] because that would never happen to me
[2:12:52] now
[2:12:55] and you don't know where your
[2:12:56] vulnerability is
[2:13:00] and god to protect his kingdom will have
[2:13:03] to expose your vulnerability
[2:13:06] so that it could be protected it is not
[2:13:08] to expose your vulnerability for your
[2:13:10] embarrassment it's for your protection
[2:13:12] because you don't know what you have to
[2:13:14] defend against until it's exposed
[2:13:18] [Applause]
[2:13:20] so peter was living under the ministry
[2:13:23] of the
[2:13:24] greatest preacher that ever walked here
[2:13:29] and he had a vulnerability he didn't
[2:13:30] even know he had
[2:13:32] let me say that again under the greatest
[2:13:35] ministry that ever walked the earth
[2:13:36] brother peter didn't realize how
[2:13:38] vulnerable he was
[2:13:40] it was with disbelief he processed jesus
[2:13:43] statement that before the cockroach
[2:13:44] three times you'll deny me
[2:13:48] and he didn't believe
[2:13:53] you keep catching this sir so people who
[2:13:56] say well under this ministry or under
[2:13:57] that ministry honor that ministry
[2:13:59] under the ministry of jesus peter was
[2:14:02] still vulnerable
[2:14:07] until when he denied christ i said he
[2:14:10] wept bitterly
[2:14:12] in so much that when jesus wrote
[2:14:14] something he said go tell my disciples
[2:14:17] and peter because peter was a messed up
[2:14:22] he was in a condition
[2:14:26] after being told in matthew 16 the word
[2:14:28] peter upon this rock and peter feeling
[2:14:30] good
[2:14:30] then get him and said peter was an
[2:14:32] emotional roller coaster
[2:14:35] and here it was it's not any of the
[2:14:37] other disciples who deny christ
[2:14:39] it's brother peter only about peter
[2:14:45] this man here said you even know jesus
[2:14:49] this was not a separation from the
[2:14:51] revelation or the doctrine
[2:14:53] this was a total denial now in scripture
[2:14:57] this was
[2:14:57] because in old testament god is really
[2:15:00] big on
[2:15:00] if you deny me the consequence of denial
[2:15:07] because way back you read it there in
[2:15:09] the book of uh uh
[2:15:10] the book of joel my people shall never
[2:15:12] be ashamed
[2:15:13] and here it is peter is saying i what
[2:15:16] i'm embarrassed i'm not associated i
[2:15:18] don't know who it is so god had a
[2:15:20] special word for peter
[2:15:24] so that peter could be released from the
[2:15:26] guilt of the vulnerability he did not
[2:15:28] know he had
[2:15:31] or you don't hear me because god had to
[2:15:34] deal with it to be able to use peter
[2:15:36] more effectively than he was used before
[2:15:42] and that's why so careful you have to be
[2:15:44] because
[2:15:45] in by talking peter at that point in his
[2:15:48] life
[2:15:49] you don't know what peter was going to
[2:15:51] become similar
[2:15:53] you don't know who here is a soul that
[2:15:55] god will make a paul
[2:15:58] or jacob who god will make a israel only
[2:16:02] god has that playbook not even his
[2:16:03] prophets could see it unless god wanted
[2:16:05] him to see it
[2:16:06] so that's why the prophet himself had to
[2:16:08] be so careful when he was found himself
[2:16:10] in the in the restaurant or whatever
[2:16:12] and he looked at the woman there with
[2:16:13] his makeup and he said is this the world
[2:16:15] my daughter will live in
[2:16:16] and grew up and he said condemn her god
[2:16:18] had to come and talk to the prophet say
[2:16:20] listen
[2:16:20] let me show you about your life even as
[2:16:23] a prophet
[2:16:23] let me show you how whenever you sin how
[2:16:26] there's a blood bumper
[2:16:27] that protecting what i see about you
[2:16:30] how could he condemn this woman and the
[2:16:32] love of god dropped in his heart
[2:16:34] god was what was you he was exposing the
[2:16:36] vulnerabilities in his profit so he
[2:16:38] could close the gaps
[2:16:39] he could close the gaps he could find
[2:16:41] all the issues that he could seal it up
[2:16:44] so that this vessel could be properly
[2:16:45] sealed for service
[2:16:47] [Music]
[2:16:52] all of this was leading up and leading
[2:16:54] up so no wonder when the prophet had his
[2:16:56] test and he said he knew it was coming
[2:16:58] and the young people are making love in
[2:17:00] the church by now the devil
[2:17:03] is the devil who whipped that up because
[2:17:05] god don't order confusion he don't alter
[2:17:06] sin
[2:17:07] so god had to allow the devil to do that
[2:17:10] and what the devil does is within his
[2:17:11] confinement to do the same with job
[2:17:13] anybody with me this morning
[2:17:15] and god is now proud like job he could
[2:17:18] say look at my son branham
[2:17:20] he could deal with this test and a voice
[2:17:22] came to the prophet because
[2:17:24] god proven that he was ready for this
[2:17:25] exam he said whatever you say is what
[2:17:27] will happen
[2:17:28] say blindness say whatever is going to
[2:17:30] happen he had the power
[2:17:31] to do it because he had already been
[2:17:33] sealed up
[2:17:35] and he did what christ would do he said
[2:17:37] i forgive you
[2:17:39] i forgive you
[2:17:42] [Applause]
[2:17:44] you see how much more we have to grow
[2:17:47] how much more we have to
[2:17:48] expand our thinking and our approach
[2:17:51] to see the mind of christ
[2:17:54] have you done enough have we done enough
[2:17:58] we are building friends we are getting
[2:18:00] stronger
[2:18:01] but when the devil wants to hold things
[2:18:03] over you and this is where we want to
[2:18:04] kind of set you free now
[2:18:07] to condemn you and say well you didn't
[2:18:08] do this and he didn't do that he didn't
[2:18:10] do that
[2:18:11] this is why the word comes to open your
[2:18:14] eyes up
[2:18:14] to see that your world that you think
[2:18:17] you're in
[2:18:18] is so small what you do is break
[2:18:21] out the world that you are in into a
[2:18:23] realm because that's what spiritual
[2:18:24] measure is spiritual amnesia
[2:18:26] is a condition that you forget who you
[2:18:28] are
[2:18:30] and you are now limited like sarah by
[2:18:32] your own understanding
[2:18:34] and spiritual amnesia separates from
[2:18:36] god's understanding about you
[2:18:39] so you're there living thinking that
[2:18:41] this is my condition this is my sickness
[2:18:43] this is my trial
[2:18:44] this is my problem i'm going to break
[2:18:46] above that and tell you that you have
[2:18:48] the strength to put that under your feet
[2:18:50] it's just waiting for you to put it
[2:18:52] under your feet
[2:18:53] it's not even god to put it on the nose
[2:18:55] you put it under your feet
[2:18:57] because he said the moment the bride
[2:18:58] gets to know who she is then the rapture
[2:19:00] will go
[2:19:00] so there's this thing that's separating
[2:19:02] an awareness of who you are
[2:19:04] in god that has to be broken and the
[2:19:06] preaching of the world is a destroyed
[2:19:08] doubt
[2:19:09] the preaching of the word is to destroy
[2:19:10] unbelief that's what the preaching of
[2:19:12] the word is for
[2:19:13] so we are coming this morning against
[2:19:15] doubt against unbelief
[2:19:17] because some of you think your sickness
[2:19:18] you're gonna have it for much longer and
[2:19:20] i want to let you know that we're
[2:19:21] preaching against that doubt and
[2:19:23] unbelief to say that sickness has got to
[2:19:25] go
[2:19:25] and we are serving notice on the
[2:19:28] sickness
[2:19:29] we are serving notice on every problem
[2:19:31] we are saving notice in every situation
[2:19:33] and we are here to preach
[2:19:35] against the doubt that that will change
[2:19:37] we are saying it has to change
[2:19:39] it must change it will change because we
[2:19:42] will do enough
[2:19:43] and more than enough to change our world
[2:19:45] to change our situation
[2:19:47] to change our circumstances
[2:19:50] could you take some more i'm trying to
[2:19:52] wrap up somewhere can i all open some
[2:19:56] i don't know how this this message i'm
[2:19:58] in
[2:19:59] i think i have too much quotes but
[2:20:02] clearance if i show my notes i'm paid 16
[2:20:05] of 123.
[2:20:08] i think i think i copied e5 twice
[2:20:16] have we done enough can we do more
[2:20:20] i want to challenge you church what more
[2:20:22] will he do this week
[2:20:24] and before i get to this week what more
[2:20:26] you'll do today
[2:20:30] what more will you do today what change
[2:20:33] will you make today
[2:20:34] you see a lot of people don't realize
[2:20:35] that success in anything
[2:20:37] spiritual and it's scriptural you know
[2:20:39] meditate on the word day and night
[2:20:42] and you have good success that's a
[2:20:43] formula do you know what happens if you
[2:20:46] live by that formula
[2:20:47] day and night mentally with day and
[2:20:48] night and you have good success
[2:20:50] so before you deal with tomorrow what
[2:20:53] are you doing today
[2:20:54] and when you could live each day saying
[2:20:56] i did my best today
[2:20:59] is there anybody could say they did
[2:21:00] their best yesterday is there anybody in
[2:21:02] this room because
[2:21:03] i did my i know i do my absolute best
[2:21:06] yesterday was incredible i did my best
[2:21:10] when i look at my efforts and i
[2:21:12] recognize i really ordered my dear said
[2:21:14] when i already spent time with you
[2:21:15] and i pray and i did my family duties
[2:21:17] and i did this i went to the grocery
[2:21:18] but when i look at the day i really find
[2:21:20] it hard i had to
[2:21:21] find a way to improve i kind it's hard
[2:21:23] to find a room for improvement i know it
[2:21:25] has to be there but it's hard
[2:21:27] any anybody
[2:21:34] that's the conversation i want you to
[2:21:35] have with yourself every day
[2:21:38] what could i improve today
[2:21:41] what can i improve what what what what
[2:21:43] what can i do better tomorrow to be a
[2:21:45] better husband
[2:21:47] back in the house again what what what
[2:21:50] what can i do tomorrow to be a better
[2:21:51] wife
[2:21:52] you know that is what christianity is
[2:21:53] about
[2:21:55] it's not always you're noting and it's
[2:21:57] not producing in your life
[2:21:58] what can you to be a better worker in a
[2:22:00] world that people could see the life of
[2:22:02] christ in me
[2:22:03] anybody with me anybody with me how can
[2:22:06] i live in my neighborhood
[2:22:08] i want people next door look and say oh
[2:22:10] you're so happy
[2:22:11] oh yeah what can you do different
[2:22:17] because if your life not showing a light
[2:22:19] of bubble that people could get
[2:22:20] attracted to
[2:22:21] then how you intend to win how you doing
[2:22:23] the fish people see you there
[2:22:24] you just depress you you you can't leave
[2:22:27] the service depression
[2:22:30] people wonder where you went
[2:22:36] and even on your job you can have a hard
[2:22:38] day energetic bible say do all they do
[2:22:39] unto the lord
[2:22:41] so when i say there is no room for
[2:22:42] executive boy i'm a boss the devil boss
[2:22:44] the devil boss that's not scripture no
[2:22:46] no
[2:22:48] that is not bible that's it whatever
[2:22:51] work you do
[2:22:52] do it unto the lord you know even if the
[2:22:55] devil using your boss
[2:22:57] your work is a sacrifice unto the lord
[2:23:00] so you have no reason leaving you
[2:23:01] stomping on your word is devil i can't
[2:23:03] wait to go to
[2:23:04] rapture because you reason you want to
[2:23:05] get raped because you want to get away
[2:23:06] from the boss
[2:23:13] i want to help your church it's the
[2:23:15] practical life because
[2:23:16] that is where brother church this is
[2:23:19] where people message you know
[2:23:21] on sundays people can come to church and
[2:23:23] they feel good about the lord and then
[2:23:24] do any week
[2:23:26] but he gives lips
[2:23:30] wasn't the prophet that when the call
[2:23:32] came for him he went outside the house
[2:23:35] and he said tell them i'm not home and
[2:23:37] god was so upset with that
[2:23:41] we call it no docking calls don't let
[2:23:44] get down into the real
[2:23:47] don't let me come down to you see a
[2:23:50] miscourt
[2:23:51] listen this thing i heard somebody say
[2:23:52] yesterday it is any simple things
[2:23:55] or christianity is tested
[2:23:58] hey i'll call you and i'm thinking well
[2:24:00] i see him scott you know very well you
[2:24:02] saw the goal
[2:24:08] now people saying well don't go there
[2:24:10] don't keep pushing don't drive down that
[2:24:11] road
[2:24:13] don't drive down the road oh hit the
[2:24:15] reverse gear fast
[2:24:19] my phone had so much cause i somehow he
[2:24:22] phoned
[2:24:23] you every year this one the phone now
[2:24:24] working
[2:24:26] because trying to avoid a miscall how
[2:24:28] would that imagine the prophet had a
[2:24:29] cell phone
[2:24:31] here was he said tell them i'm not home
[2:24:33] and god say
[2:24:34] listen that behavior can't work in them
[2:24:39] because all lies have a father
[2:24:47] have we done enough have you done enough
[2:24:51] have i done enough friends we coming
[2:24:53] down to our life
[2:24:57] i've heard somebody saying recently you
[2:24:58] know god dispatches angels
[2:25:00] scripturally to protect you
[2:25:04] but the proximity of the angels is a
[2:25:06] function of your life
[2:25:08] so the angels are protecting you you
[2:25:10] know but you see whenever you do things
[2:25:12] that not pleasing to god
[2:25:14] it creates affliction with the angels
[2:25:17] because the angels are attracted to the
[2:25:18] holiness they are
[2:25:20] they serve a holy god they attracted a
[2:25:22] holy light in you that you didn't put
[2:25:24] there
[2:25:25] that's why i said grieve not the holy
[2:25:27] spirit that word grievous is the offend
[2:25:29] the holy spirit
[2:25:30] and you offend the holy spirit with your
[2:25:32] words with your actions with you even
[2:25:33] your thoughts
[2:25:36] because the words that your thoughts are
[2:25:37] loud in heaven and your words
[2:25:41] so we are walking now into a closer walk
[2:25:43] with have i
[2:25:44] am i living really this thing this
[2:25:46] message
[2:25:50] am i the message is the message already
[2:25:52] in me
[2:25:53] it's a different question i can ask the
[2:25:56] question are you in the message
[2:25:58] is the message in you because if the
[2:26:01] message is in you it will reflect itself
[2:26:04] because we are moving towards a
[2:26:06] destination of perfection
[2:26:08] so i would expect because it's a process
[2:26:12] walk before me and be thou perfect that
[2:26:14] walk means now it's a movement it's a
[2:26:15] it's a movement towards the perfection
[2:26:18] so but i would expect whether he could
[2:26:20] have every service you come every week
[2:26:21] that passed you're getting more and more
[2:26:23] like him
[2:26:24] until one day when you look in the
[2:26:25] mirror you'll recognize vietnam
[2:26:27] i see jesus looking back so every
[2:26:30] service for us
[2:26:31] is an opportunity for us to do an
[2:26:33] assessment like the prophet did
[2:26:35] i haven't done enough so you must leave
[2:26:38] the service saying i have more to do
[2:26:40] i have more work to do i have to improve
[2:26:43] anybody who live in here saying i'm
[2:26:44] ready
[2:26:46] you recognize you're missing it come the
[2:26:49] church see him and the musician can get
[2:26:50] ready
[2:26:52] trying to wear the clothes out is this
[2:26:56] helping anybody
[2:27:02] no in our day it is expected for us to
[2:27:04] do our part
[2:27:06] it is expected of us to meet the
[2:27:08] challenge of the hour
[2:27:09] it is expected of us to be able to
[2:27:11] answer the question with a resounding
[2:27:14] yes we have done enough
[2:27:16] just like paul to timothy i have fought
[2:27:18] a good fight
[2:27:20] i have finished my course i have kept
[2:27:22] the faith
[2:27:23] hence four days later for me a crown of
[2:27:25] righteousness
[2:27:26] which the lord the righteous judge shall
[2:27:28] give me at that day
[2:27:29] and not to me only but unto all them
[2:27:33] also that love his appearing
[2:27:36] so paul was able to reach that place
[2:27:38] just as brother branham was able to
[2:27:39] reach his own spot
[2:27:41] where he knew he did what god called him
[2:27:43] to do
[2:27:44] and friends i want to encourage you in
[2:27:46] this service if you have a revelation
[2:27:49] of what god called you to do and you
[2:27:51] should be able to look at yourself
[2:27:53] look at the word concerning you and know
[2:27:55] where you line up
[2:27:57] i'm not in a position to mark your
[2:27:58] papers you have to be in a position to
[2:28:01] look at the syllabus the curriculum at
[2:28:03] the exam and say lord
[2:28:04] i recognize i do have the holy ghost i
[2:28:06] recognize i do have patience i recognize
[2:28:07] that i answering back i recognize i've
[2:28:09] been disrespectful i recognize i've been
[2:28:11] praying and lord
[2:28:12] i've come today to really dedicate my
[2:28:13] life i continue to reboot my system
[2:28:15] my computer end up with a virus you see
[2:28:17] this coronavirus my life have a virus
[2:28:19] and i want to i want to get the
[2:28:21] antivirus in this service which is the
[2:28:22] holy ghost i want to get in the presence
[2:28:24] the atmosphere of god that i could not
[2:28:26] be more
[2:28:27] dedicated more consecrated more
[2:28:29] separated
[2:28:31] can the church see amen oh
[2:28:34] hallelujah hallelujah oh my
[2:28:37] in recognizing your day and his message
[2:28:39] you could begin to play something softly
[2:28:41] remember in my vision this is the
[2:28:43] prophet now beginning to speak and hint
[2:28:46] to the closer of his ministry begin to
[2:28:48] hint at what he had already achieved and
[2:28:49] accomplished under god
[2:28:51] he said if paul's people goes in look at
[2:28:53] the confidence so will mine
[2:28:55] hallelujah he said if paul's people went
[2:28:58] in
[2:28:58] so will mine because i'd done just
[2:29:00] exactly like he did
[2:29:02] i'm staying right with it the millions
[2:29:05] through their hands saying we are
[2:29:06] resting on that what
[2:29:08] recognize the day that we are living the
[2:29:10] time we are living the sign of the time
[2:29:12] that we are living in
[2:29:13] listen to the prophet this is now 64 now
[2:29:17] it may be later than we think one of
[2:29:20] these days
[2:29:21] let him that's outside stay outside
[2:29:25] still
[2:29:26] he that's inside must forever be inside
[2:29:29] still
[2:29:30] the door will close he said if there's
[2:29:32] some here this morning that hasn't never
[2:29:34] walked in yet oh
[2:29:35] in jesus name idea people don't look
[2:29:39] at this ignorant servant standing here
[2:29:41] speaking about himself
[2:29:43] illiterate unlearned uneducated don't
[2:29:46] look at that but look at the word
[2:29:47] that's been proven look at the great
[2:29:49] holy spirit who vindicated
[2:29:51] to be the truth we are the evening time
[2:29:53] it's later than you think
[2:29:54] women let your hair grow sister please
[2:29:57] take off them dirty clothes
[2:29:59] throw them cigarettes away for the hour
[2:30:01] will come that he that's filthy let him
[2:30:03] be filthy still
[2:30:04] and he that's righteous let him be
[2:30:05] righteous to him he that's inside his
[2:30:07] inside
[2:30:08] he's that outside it's outside that
[2:30:10] little closed margin if a
[2:30:11] righteous man will clearly be saved
[2:30:13] where will the sinner go ungodly
[2:30:15] appear where will they appear
[2:30:18] where will they appear friends
[2:30:22] as we look through the ages i'm closing
[2:30:24] out
[2:30:26] we had luther and luther brought a
[2:30:29] message
[2:30:29] of justification and then when wesley
[2:30:33] came
[2:30:35] the message that luther had was no
[2:30:37] longer enough
[2:30:39] it could no longer make the cut because
[2:30:42] the season had changed
[2:30:44] and if you had stayed in that day just
[2:30:46] like acts 19 he said
[2:30:48] have you received the holy ghost since
[2:30:49] you believe he said we where we are
[2:30:52] nobody's think all the holy ghost
[2:30:53] he said unto what we are baptized under
[2:30:55] john's baptism so those there were
[2:30:58] still living in the old age so so to
[2:31:00] speak
[2:31:01] and the same way that when wesley came
[2:31:03] it meant what luther brought was
[2:31:04] long enough and when the pentecostals
[2:31:06] came it meant that what wesley brought
[2:31:08] was no longer enough
[2:31:09] i remember the brahmana came it meant
[2:31:10] what the pentecostal had was no longer
[2:31:12] enough
[2:31:14] but now in this age this message is more
[2:31:16] than enough
[2:31:18] because it pulls up from all the ages
[2:31:21] and the prophet can scream on behold the
[2:31:23] bridegroom comment
[2:31:24] go out and meet him in other words you
[2:31:27] have everything available to you to get
[2:31:29] ready
[2:31:30] will you be ready will you be ready have
[2:31:33] you done enough to be ready
