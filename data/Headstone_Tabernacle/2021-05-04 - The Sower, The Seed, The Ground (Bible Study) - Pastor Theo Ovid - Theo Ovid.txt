jason we ask it amen and email oh blessed being with the lord i want to really appreciate how many appreciate uh what brother isaac has shared with us our last two um a a a bible teacher about talent and treasure and some time and truly i was thinking i was talking to my wife and sharing with her how you know everything to us is unknown and many times we don't see that we tend to say we have this and we own this and so but everything is unknown our wives our husbands our children our jobs our own life all that we have is unknown we are already stewards of god's grace stewards mean that we are accountable and responsible for what is placed in our hands gifts and talents just think tonight whatever gift you're born with whatever gift you have engineer architect doctor lawyer doesn't matter what talent you have that time come from somewhere that talent come from god and god give you the ability to earn to learn to study to serve him to love him to appreciate him and he values your response he values your response tonight i have something i'd like to share with you tonight and um uh it's uh the soar the seed the ground that's what i want to share with you tonight last sunday we had a stream service about data paid upon the lord showing you their strength and uh in such a time as this you can't be anxious you can't be uh you know wanting this to happen right away and want it to happen fast you just have to wait and be patient and this will continue along that vein tonight so you have your bibles i'd like you to turn to genesis chapter one we want to read from 11 to 12. so keep your bibles nearby we have some scriptures and we want to go straight into tonight and see how the lord will lead so it's the sore the seed the girl genesis chapter 1 reading from verse 11 and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herbal and seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so and the earth brought forth grass and herbald and seed and it was so and and the earth was grass and herbies of his kind and the tree healing fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and god so that it was good and lower down to 26 to 26 and god said let us make man in our image after all likeness let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fall of the year over the cattle over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeped upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god created him male and female crazily them and god bless them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish subdue it have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the air and over every living thing that moved upon his head now notice notice here that god when god give a command or give a pronouncement he covers the end from the beginning he actually give them the whole scope which was to be fruitful multiply replenish the earth subdue it have dominion over every living thing that covered up on the earth so that was a full comprehensive view of adam to be god over the earth but they had was to wait for further revelation of how this is so unfull and this is what we get from what brother branham shared so i'll be uh splicing in scriptures with what the prophet shared and he said now when god made every seed of this kind so that was a law god put there seed after it's kind so there's a kind of seed and every seed supposed to see in its own channel and reproduce itself and there was nothing like him god was a spirit so therefore god made man his own image or hear these words gold made every seed after his kind then when he made man in his image it was a seed of his word but jesus was made flesh he the flesh of the word of god and when we receive the word of god then we become god's word in our flesh the church should be in that condition so adam was a seed of the word jesus the flesh of the word the word itself made flesh so take note of that okay we want to go to genesis 3 and this is after the devil trap eve we're going to read from verse 9 this is adam backslidden adam out of the spirit adam out of his position and god calling out to adam the verse 9 of genesis chapter 3. if you want to find it and the lord god called unto adam and said on them where now and as well isaac shared with you that's not location that's where uh you from the realm that i leave you in and he said i heard a voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself and he said who told you the dog was naked has now eaten up the tree where i commanded thee the dog should not eat the man said the woman whom though gave us to be with me she gave me of the tree and i did eat and the lord god said unto the woman what is this that does done that woman said this sip and beguile me and i get eaten so they passed an e-book i don't say the woman the woman said his serpent and the lord sends the discipline because that was done this thou had cursed our cuddle above every piece of the field and this upright being upon thy belly shall go and thus shall thou eat all the days of thy life that is when he hit the dust this this is the words i want to get to and i will put enmity between d and the woman between thy seed and her seed and they shall bruise thy head and thou shall bruise his heel so the battle of angels not just became the battle of men but this battle come to the flesh level in which in genesis they have been identified two seeds between thy seed and her seed dye seed meaning the serpent seed and whose seed meaning from adam so right away this word that is a seed this word that is creative and god identifying this seed now on the earth in terms of a life and then verse 16 unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception and sorrow and shall bring forth children and that desire shall be to thy husband and everywhere he said and he shall rule over thee and under adam he said because i was hacking unto the voice of thy wife as eaten of the tree of which i commanded sin and thou shalt not eat of it curses the ground for thy sake and soul shall not eat of it all the days of thy life thorns also and tissues shall they bring forth to thee and those shall eat the hulk of the field and the sweat of thy face thou shalt eat bread till they'll return onto the ground for out of it was though taking dust out until dust thou shalt return now let's hear a little bit from he said no adam was not deceived but his bride was not deceived and he said he gave him a bride a type of second adam he gave the first adam a bride she fell he gave the second album christ a bright she fell she is not an original she's a vibrator the bride today so-called i'm saying so-called is a byproduct see she calls herself the bride but what she is she is made up of a material of organization not of the word so much word in it to make it a kind of byproduct to make it hypocritical he believed most of the word but she doubted one part of it adam bride could not wait so she mingled her seed illegally do you see why i am contending for that word word by word i repeat it again do you see why i am contending for that word word by word i have told you i believe that is god's truth god has protected the bible he's got to judge the world by something through jesus christ which is the word the word made flesh so adam bride couldn't wait you see there is nothing to it they say it's phony watch he says okay i'll back up a little bit that's the way the bride today she wants to manufacture something to say i'm adopted or i am in this position and i am that position i have this authority and this corona virus flattening all these supermen and all these who are feeling that power what will flatten them like pancake because god will get glory at the end of it through his bride so it had no man to raise up to iron this and beat his chest god would not have that so he said no she wants to manufacture something she's got to work it up on a platform she's got to have everything see what is she doing manufacturing something the way it's going you can see there's nothing to it it's a phony if it wasn't forget about this world would be a flame with the power of god and the church will be on fire oh what dead would be raised and all kind of things would be taking place so all this quiet gospel that people want to peddle because they don't have the power to manifest and they will ridicule those who anointed and claiming and believing and expecting that this same holy ghost that was on pentecost is just as real they want to make much of it but it doesn't change the fact that god that the prophet identified that if it was here as promised then all kinds of things will be taking place all kinds of things will take place deadly debris and everything else now but what did she get sold up before christ could get her before he got to her to plant his own seed oh so jesus have his own seed that's right where did she have weed seeds she got wool denominational seeds and that's the reason why she's reaping her harvest right now i hope that this doesn't make you upset i hope it gets right down to the place where i trust that god has given it to you what was she after wisdom god give a commission that cannot perish replenish multiply that was god's eternal purpose and the matter today he says you want some kind of phony makeup with screaming jumping speaking in tongues instead of waiting here we go for the real word of god to be made manifest to the bride so because many don't want to wait people claim certain things and what we ought to do is to anoint the promises that god made lord you promised this you promised me deliverance you punched me i breakthrough you promised me victory you can't lie your word can't feel you said your word carry turn void so it's an attitude of uh placing god right on top of what he has promised now you didn't promise you didn't make the promise is he made a promise he said behold i send you elijah you can say god you send me elijah i receive elijah i receive the message oh i want this message to be alive in me i know i am not a child of the enemy i'm not a super seed i'm a child of god and lord you promised me these things and i am claiming them not only for me but for my family and you are blind yourself to the hot pants the mini skirt the smoking the drinking whatever negative whatever world they're in that has nothing to do with the promise and i'll prove it to you tonight whatever condition your loved ones are in right now right now that has nothing to do with the promise of god the promise is true the promise is real god cannot lie but we say amen tonight so watch he says instead of waiting for the real word of god to be mean manifested bright then kind that takes the word is god's true bride bringing forth children they can't die a child the bride brings forth on the word can't die because it's the word did you get it she can't die that child can't die because he's a word child he's a sea child he's an eternal child and i find that it's so wonderful tonight so you see now watch the seed word here we go cannot grow in the atmosphere then of knowledge as soon as knowledge mixes with fate it dies right there oh i want you to see that tonight the true seed word cannot grow in an atmosphere of knowledge and the bible talk about in the last days knowledge shall increase what we have now is the fullness of knowledge has been loosed on the earth and the false bride or uh the impersonator bride in a condition of knowledge claiming to be bright that's not it that is why the devil fight worship they verified you get it in the spirit it fight a genuine atmosphere even some of these songs i hear sometimes it's just heavily intellectual and just words they fling woods at music or fling music words and make it a song and call it a message song and it's just you have to listen and hear and almost saying he meant to be song instead of something that is inspired by experience that that resonate over the heart like in this last song uh some song that but the guinea was talking about that isaac happened to sing and the person why the children died and his wife survived like how does he talk about when his wife died and and and this hallows he was on the fields doing evangelism and they called him and say your wife died he's all lord somebody tell him don't say lord say precious lord and right there he started saying precious lord take my hands leave me on and help me let me stand i'm tired i'm weak i'm warned to stop these are the kind experiences and these songs that is not from intellectual pertinent words on a piece of paper and call it a song not beated in that way but waited from the the experience that people go through these are song that has lived through the years and they're still anointed they're still inspired like like blind fanny cosby i shall know him by the prince of the nails in his hands oh my all these bloodstone there's a fountain filled with blood drawn from me manual where sinners punch beneath the flood and lose all their guilty stings all these are such inspiring songs and when you sing them and and play them and get in the spirit with them it keeps you in an atmosphere and these are the kind of things i want to encourage i mean there are other songs wordified songs i call them they have its place they remind every message and the word and the knowledge and so on but what you really want is the things that get you in the spirit in the spirit because the world spirit is very dominant the prince of the power of the air is very dominant you're fighting music the atmosphere people the noise are wrong it's demon activity everywhere because satan have a last ride hallelujah so you are fighting against hell on the earth and that is why i have to press your way to get in the spirit and that's why i certainly appreciate you being here tonight to hear this word tonight that we are bringing to you so therefore the seed word cannot grow in our atmosphere of knowledge so what obama's dramatizing here he says uh you you shall not surely die you think that good loving father god would do a thing like that what did she do she listened to reason took his wisdom a tree delight one can desire of it to be wise right this is until uh and so on eve you see the seed that she was holding and would have finally become a mother by the will of god through a spoken word would have finally become a mother but she couldn't wait and went into that yeah you see it again the holy ghost seeds of the bible i'll say it again the holy ghost seeds of the bible cannot grow in an atmosphere of wisdom that kills every seminary in the country so how does that line up with the bible talking about the last days they shall be silly women leading with divers lost want to heap unto themselves teachers have been itching ears ever learning and never coming to the knowledge of the truth come like oh the prophet says when you see the message the rest is filler material when you really see the message so i'm not trying to get filler material to kill time we're not trying to kill time and stretch out like a long movie a long drink and keep pouring water no no we're trying to get to the core what is this about because god are certain laws are certain principles and if you see these principles and laws and live by them then your life will be on the right track it will be rightly channeled are you with me tonight so therefore eve was to believe the word as it was given to her you know i was doing something yet on the computer as the installer program and whatnot and i find myself following instructions what has given the internet do this do this and afterwards i realize that i am following instructions to the letter because if you don't follow the instructions you wouldn't get the results if they say do this type in this put in this here do this here erase this here do this here do this here if you do the instructions you'll get the results and then when i did that i said look at that look how we could follow instruction because i am not a computer scientist i am not a programmer i am not a writer of code and whatnot we don't know what the writing name we don't know what they have behind there you know we're just doing what they say press this say i agree to this do this do this do this and i'm telling myself why is it that we can't take the word of god just like that just like that god the promising revival i want it i'm looking for it i'm expecting it god you promised to be a healer not you know you know like i got born sick like it's god's will for me to be sick not that kind of talk i want you to say i i'm going to be healed oh god i must be paying for my sins no i don't want that kind of talk i want to talk a redemption blood deliverance this is what we want to hear this is what we wanted to claim this is when you ask god i can't hold i go dead yeah you've got that but no no you can't claim that right now you might even mix the rapture before that hit you so you can't go and anoint that god here people 90 years old 92 years old god called abraham when he was old and bless abraham and change his body and so on so you have to be exercising your faith even in this chronic virus environment right you know and and we have to keep pressing on by god's grace so let's continue tonight so watch uh skip that now adam bright could not wait multiply and replenish the earth here we go and this part i want to get to it was on an uncommenting a promise remember i told you that god gave them the hopes whole scope multiply replenish subdue and different things like that the whole school but it was an uncommon promise and it come like god promised to pull when he first come down with 2.10 manifestation of god spoken word all these things but we can't run as if that is what we have now that is insane it doesn't work that way god told samuel anoint one of your son that jesse to be king but david got saying oh god you know that was going to end right they was going to take his head off so so in other words when god released the anointing of dominion the anointing of authority the anointing to be a manifested son the anointed to be adopted son because he has to do that first the anointing of your position of your calling have to come upon you another anointing is what helps direct you to where you're supposed to go but before you reach the fulfillment of where the anointing want to carry you and take you and place you you have to go to process and this here is the law of the seed the law of the seed because the seed itself goes through process you don't take a seed and say uh i'm looking forward for fruit tomorrow you know we just planted yesterday it doesn't work that way a lot of people wish it was that way but it doesn't work that way when you put down a seed you have to w-a-i-t you have to wait that's where patients come in because the sea demands that law of planting waiting unfolding and that unfolding is the life of the seed is unfolding isn't that right so this is the principle that god established since in genesis in the beginning so he said he told adam and eve multiply and replenish the earth it was an uncommenting a promise so it wasn't it yet i have it now no it was a promise she was not his wife as yet because he had never lived with her the bride of christ is not his wife yet so all these catchphrases and the eye and the bride and all these nice fancy words you see when you already get down in the scriptures you recognize that is not really what people think it is the bride of christ is not his wife yet the wedding supper is to take place okay now she got in a hurry she crossed her seed she mingled it with the sip and seed and what did she bring a child of death and she perverted every child after that after that amen so if you have a bible let's go to matthew 13 and we go to the new testament and we start to see how to unfold from here matthew 13 we want to read from verse 3 of matthew chapter 13 reading from verse 3. and he speak many things as a demon parable saying behold i saw went forth to sow when he sowed some seeds fell by the west side the fowl came and devoured them up some fell upon stony places where they had not much earth and fort way they sprung up because they had no deepness of earth when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away some fell among thorns and the torns sprung up and choked them some fell into good ground and brought forth fruit some a hundredfold some 64 some 34. what else to hear let him hear was stan and the disciples came and said unto him why speakers though unto them in parables he answered them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever have not from him shall be taken even that he had now when he amplified that scripture that verse 12 it reads for whosoever has spiritual knowledge to him will be given will more be given and he will be furnishly richly so that he will have abundance but from him who has not even what he has will be taken away so let's continue to verse 13. therefore speak eye into them in parables because they see and see not hearing they hear not nearly understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of isaias which said by hearing you shall hear shall understand and seeing you shall see and shall not perceive for this people's heart you know why hear why exactly prophecy for this people's heart is wax gross and the ears are dull hearing and the eyes they have closed at least at any time they should see where their eyes here with their ears should understand with their heart should be converted i would heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for very like unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desire to see those things which you see i've not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them verse 18 hear ye therefore the parable of the sewer and then jesus went to break it down to them now i could say tonight blessed are your ears what you hear and your eyes what you have seen you are seeing god release a 20th century prophet with a pillar of fire you have seen god release a message in this hour and revelation that even in ages gone past did not have you have seen the fulfillment of what god told daniel go that way the book is sealed till the time of the year people take it for granted now about books and the tapes and revelation but the fact is all through the ages of waiting for this house the return of the book which is the title leader of the earth back on the signs and it's so strange and unique that god the only way god could get this book to us not just as written or as spoken but as a seed that's why god told go to the prophet said the end time messenger he would sow the seed of the entire bible and the secret is what the word is in the bride so therefore it took some time but god's interest was to get the word into you because the pentecostal and i remember preaching on it some time ago with dynamics which was power which was the anointing they couldn't come to adoption because they did not have the seed so it's not so much the iranian is what's seen in you because the rain is coming nobody can't stop that today was quite a rainy day here in trinidad nobody cast up the rain and said put an umbrella and block the old sky and block the rain no they ain't coming but it's coming on seats is which kind of seed it's what kind of seed because we have a soil we have the seed and we have the ground now the sower is connected with the seed because the sower is the one who sows the seed and when you hear son of man you know who he is right he's his sower he had the sow of the good seed and that is what jesus came in this last day to do he came to a prophet to bring seed not just seed but original seed which is the spoken word and you know you see men ministers pastors and whoever else gives a lot of interpretation and their ideas because they feel quoting from the prophet is not good enough it needs a long stretcher you know like rubber band and you pull it and you spin it and everything else but the thing of it is if we believe god was veiled in that elijah and spoke out through that man that means what came out of his mouth was spirit given or spirit spoken words the spirit itself spoke those words and the words itself are seeds let there be let there be let there be let there be so what you have been receiving is not the words of a man you are receiving the words of the son of man spirit given words know when here we go when these spirit come back to find out and to hunt for those seeds oh glory hallelujah when when the holy ghost comes back he will be looking for the very seeds that was spoken and released by the saw because brother branham he brought part of it was historical because a lot of mysteries was missed back there that has absolutely nothing to do with the bride that have to do with information of revelation that was not understood so if we talk about sip and seed and we talked about uh uh other mysteries that have back there or come like okay the seas have been open first seal white horse red horse ego pilos rightos red horse and so on like that that is history fought seal prophecy fifth seal jews six seals judgment what concerns us is this seventh seal not for the seal that's information it have revelation under there you have understanding over there you have inspiration under there but that's not that's not easy for the bride then the end time seal is the seventh seal so therefore the seed of the entire bible had to be released under the seven seal for the end time bride all the mysteries had to be gathered up into a revelation of the son of man so that is why he said malachi 4 came to open six seals it's all gathered up into a revelation of sonoma besoa so once we cover the path which is the historical path which is the church ages past then you recover the sun they come like you saw a man lost he get deleted he get erased that's the first age son of man saw seeds the seeds that he sow become flesh and was made manifest in the book of acts so it wasn't like a book seed it was like peter had spoken books on his and explaining and explaining and talking they were the living word they were the seeds itself they were the word manifested could we say amen tonight so therefore when it was the seat fell in nicer and fell into the ground under the promise of i will restore kangawan caterpillar lucas and pamela it took four moves justification sanification baptism of the holy ghost and the word itself it took luther wesley the pentecostal and it took malachi for prophet to come and bring the word itself to bring us back on point to prepare for reign or prepare for manifestation or prepare for fulfillment the seed we're talking about so let me just look at just hasten a bit now but um jesus i think reached verse 18 here here you the idea for the parable of the soul when one heareth the word of the kingdom and understand it not then commit the wicked one cash it away that which was sown in his heart this is he which receives seed by the wayside so the first one is wayside you recite people wayside people recite church members you're hearing and the devil just snatching things from them and they are seize that by the wayside verse 20. he had received a deceit into stony places the same as he that hearing the word and are non-received but joy received it yet he had not rooted himself but drew it for a while enjoyed for a while and when tribulation or persecution arise it because of the word by and by is offended he also that receives seed among the torns is he that heareth the word and the care of those this world and this deceitfulness of the riches choke the word and become unfruitful but here that we see that seed into the good ground you see that here at the word understand it also bear fruit bring it forth 104 60 30. all right blessed be the name of the lord i want to go to luke 8 we want to take it from dear because it brings a different uh picture same story but we just have the condensed part luke 8 reading from verse 14 to 18. you want to go and find it luke chapter 8 was 14 to 18 and after tonight we're going to put this uh this this on thing that we're sharing here on the whatsapp group that you could get you could always go put this over luke 8 14 to 18. jesus speaking and that which fell among tones so i'm going to start from the torns in luke 8. that was full among torns a day which when they are heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of his life and bring no fruit to perfection so so so so this didn't come out that way in in the last scripture we read there but this is what brought over here the torns all right the torns a day which when they are heard go forth and are choked now the it grows it start to produce but because of cares riches and pleasures of this life bring no fruit to perfection so this word fruit to perfection is loud it is big because you can't get nothing with the wayside they just fall and they're gone you can't get much with this tony don't talk about perfection wrong stony at all they shouting and jumping and happy happy happy and then they disappear the last two and there in mind we say in wayside we're saying stoney we're saying tony are we saying good wrong all of these four categories represent heart conditions or be grown so you have wayside ground stoning ground tony ground and good ground so all of these these four categories represent heart condition nothing is wrong with the word or nothing is wrong with the seed so let's continue verse 15 but but that on the good ground a day which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring it forth fruit with patience no man when he lighted a candle covered with a vessel or put it under a bed but set it on a candlestick the day which enter may see the light for nothing in secret that shall not be made manifest neither anything hid that shall not be known to come abroad take heed therefore how you hear how you hear for whosoever hath him shall be given and whosoever hath not from him shall be taking even that which he seemeth to have the amplified of that last verse said be careful therefore how you listen for to him who has spiritual knowledge will more be given and from him who does not have spiritual knowledge even what he thinks and guesses and supposes that he has be taken away so here tonight we have the waysides these tonys the 20s and the good ground and i want you to understand tonight perfection is only coming out of the last group good ground this is brother branham and he's saying this from between exodus the seed that falls upon dry ground or upon rocks it will never do nothing hard stony heart that wants to be indifferent you ever encounter people who just want to be different they like to be different you say a they both be you say apple they bought you know they just don't want to be in harmony they want to argue they want to fight they want to be on the other side if they say up they sit down if they say in they say out they just want that just indifferent them they're not looking to harmonize they're looking how they could be so you know and this difference is what going to set them apart and in trying to be indifferent they're off-key they off-beat and then they probably talk about people who you don't want to be around they don't make you feel comfortable they don't make you feel welcome their spirit is not welcoming their spirit isn't different now their face might have a smile they might be normal they might be looking normal but what they give out their spirit atmosphere and that is where like the pentecostals quran says was the restoration of the leaves because when the devil eaten his back leaves the fruit first he took the fruit after the fruit was the leaves after these are the back which is the doctrine recovering and afterwards this life itself is what he eat so eat it right down so then afterwards go to the i restore so you have to bring back the doctrine which is the covering then you bring back the branches the leaves you get fruit yet you're clapping hallelujah glory glory glory so therefore the cactus behavior that people have when they have spikes on their lives and when they get close to them ouch because it's not a flow in life it's not an atmosphere of welcome this is the spirit of indifference so he said no but if it fall upon soft mellow ground of fate it will bring forth a christian bearing fruits of the spirit then he says some of the green wheat fell and grown the birds picked it up and others fell among torns and some was went on prepared ground or pre-prepared ground so he the last group program identified as pre-prepared grown now jesus you notice no man can come to me except my father draws him all the father give me will come he said now here is the predestinated plan is in plain view this should make his show tonight just as other seed the word of god is a seed and must have the grong prepared beforehand do you know that the seas season genesis was in the earth under darkness and when god said let there be light the light came and bring that seat alive so do you know that your heart has been prepared before let me better read it let me read it if there's to excite you i i don't know what will therefore if you sow seed just throw it any minute wrong it will do no good the birds will pick it up you threw it among tesla than torn it would choke up pretty soon jesus probably said so so the ground has to be made ready first okay your ground has to be made ready first and he says now he prepared you oh my so so god in sovereign grace prepares the heart first he prepared you before the foundation of the world to receive him in this age he foreknew you by his foreknowledge and ordained you to eternal life he knew you therefore he prepared you oh give the lord some praise and i just just stop right where you are right now and raise your hands and give god some praises he foreknew you that is why he prepared you to receive this word in this last day the baptist couldn't hold you you met this could know your catholic couldn't hold you and because i couldn't hold you you had to come out because your he prepared you and because he knew you oh my bless thank you lord thank you about tonight and then he said this here that is the reason you staggered out of these things and staggered into what you have now it was called leading you to the place where he has ordained for you to be if this groan isn't repaired beforehand it can't grow and that's the reason the seed of faith when you are preaching faith see the designers of the lord and see what takes place all the gifts of the bible people working themselves up how do i believe it and come up finally have disappointed the ground has to be for ordained and you know when it strikes it so i want to say it again perfection could only come to this last group and the lord told brother branham pick up heaven right and god give him these words he says what i'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction is to bring forth of its kind genesis 1 11 in these last days the true bright church comes to the headstone will be a super race a super race super church as she nears the headstone here we go there will be so much like him in his very image in order to be united with him now we know what the image is right faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness vertical is charity such a perfect man right they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the living god i'll just skip over them the first son was spoken seed word of god fulsome he was given a bride to produce himself see she fell the bride was given the purpose to produce himself again another son of god she felled by her breeding and it caused him to die the second son of jesus now a spoken seed word of god was given my bride like adam and before he could marry her she was formed she was put to free more agency like adam's wife to believe god wouldn't live and she doubted or don't die she did here we go then from yeah a little group of the true seed of the word god represent christ a beloved bride a virgin to his word notice he's not talking about church he's talking about the word now the true seed of the word and through them this bride and by them the bride will be fulfilled all that have been promised for his word in the virgin who knows no man made creeds or dogmas the word of promise is in himself like it was in mary god himself made manifest here we go hear the prophecy he will act himself by his own word of promise so to fulfill what has been written of him he said they will love him and will have his potentials for he is their head and they are his subjects subject to his head headship of christ as his notice what harmony jesus never did anything until the scene of the father of the father showed him first this harmony between god and christ in john 5 19 so will the bride he show his word of life he shows her she receives it she never doubts it nothing can harm her not even that let me say it again this breath nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again and i got a big great hallelujah here is the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of christ to know what he wants done with the word now that mind of christ there is the intelligence so that is charity that is dynamics that will be the capstone that will be the supreme anointing coming down upon the bride to show her what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name she has thus saith the lord then it is dramatized so the holy spirit waters it until it's grown and serve its purpose it is again so she has dusty lord one then it is dramatized so it's starting from seed so the holy spirit waters it one soul another water but god gives the increase waters it until it is grown and serves its purpose they only do his will this is the bright now they only do what his will no one can persuade them different they have thus said the lord what they keep still then they will do the works of god for it is is himself in them continuing his word to fulfill as he did compete in his days as he did complete in his days oh blessed be given some praises tonight give him some worship tonight oh blessed be the name of the lord no it's so unique in one of the texts i believe it was matthew same chapter 13 and we're going to get back to it right after jesus gave this parable and he explained this power of the soul he dropped another parable on them and if you want to find it that's matthew 13 verse 24. very interesting how he did this so he identified the first probably red sword the power of the soul of these four heart conditions wayside hearts stony hearts tony hats and heart that is good the other scripture we pick up in luke showed that this the tony cannot bring fruit to perfection so we know that once you are loved listen carefully once you allow the cares of life riches pleasures to tie you up you're not really getting fruit to perfection you might get some kind of fruit yes but not what is required so what is required by god fruit of perfection something 34 64 100 fold but jesus brought another parable matthew 13 reading from verse 24 to 30. and another probably put fortune is that the kingdom of heaven is like not a man which sword could see in his field but while men slept his enemy came and saw tears among the wheat i went this way when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tears also so the servants of the householder came and said unto him sir this is that thou so good feeling seed and i feel from whence then had it tears he said unto them an enemy had done this the silver inside of him without them that we go and guide them up he said me at least while you guard up the tears you root up the wheat with them let boat grew together until the harvest and in the time of harvest i will say to the reapers gather you together first tears buy them in bundles to burn them that guarded the wheat into my own bowel so this here is a different thing altogether this here is jesus sharing that another seed was introduced after the good seed was sold another seed was introduced after the good seed was sown this is what happened in genesis who put adam a seed a pull out eve a rib they fell and then all of a sudden you get another seed that is why with cain when seth was born the bible said and god has given him another son that set replaced ibel that died it wasn't that sep was kane's brother set replace either so whatever way of getting it right in terms of his purpose will stand regardless his purpose for your life will stand regardless regardless of what trap what smears what failures what shortcomings once your name is on that book and god has elected you in this hour for that eternal life nothing will stop the purpose of god in your life do you believe that tonight oh blessed be the name of the lord let's look at matthew chapter 13 and let's continue verse 36 where jesus explained this parable verse 36 to 43 we're going to read matthew 13 and then then jesus sent the away went into the house and his disciples came on them saying declare unto us the power of the tears of the field he answered and said to them he that's what the good seed is the son of man bullseye make no mistake about good seed salaman in charge of that easy so anytime you see santa man you have good seed the field is the world and here we go the good seed are the children of the kingdom so do you see how god see you tonight as a good seed could we give the lord a shout on that one tonight right in your room right in your house he said watch the field is the world the good seat are the churn of the kingdom but the tears are the chair of the wicked one the enemy that saw them is the devil the harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angels as therefore the tears are gathered and burning the fire so shall it be in the end of this world the son of man shall send forth his angels and she shall gather out of his kingdom all thing that offend and them which do iniquity and they shall cast them into fullness of fire they shall be willing national teeth then shall the righteous shine forth as a son in the kingdom of their father what heir let him hear but a broner he said notice in verse 41 the two are very close in the last days he could not depend on some student church to separate them methodist baptist pentecostal just no you say he was sent as angels to separate them an angel is coming to bring the separation the separation between right and wrong no one can do that but the angel of the lord he's the one that's gonna tell which is right which is wrong and god said he will send his angels as the last time not angels done true here but angels at the last time and he would gather together we know at the coming half this time an angel is really a messenger and we see there are seven angels of the seven churches to the church ages notice who he said that the swords were also what the seed was the sower was he the son of god who went forth so in seed an enemy came behind him which was the devil he sowed a seed of discrepancy behind the sowing of the right seed and friends that has happened to every age since we have had a world all the way from the beginning no he said the seed of god the word of god and jesus said in a certain place that the word is a seed and every seed will bring forth after is kind hallelujah now if the christian the children of god the children of the kingdom has become the seed of god then they must be the word of god okay if you stop right there it would look like just word seed almost like if it's text and just knowledge and information but this is what continues here i'll say it again if the children the children of god the children of the kingdom has become the seed of god then there must be the word of god the word of god manifested in the age that they're living in for the promised seed of that age god give his word at the beginning and each age has its seeds its time and its promises now when noah come forth he was the seed of god the word of god for that age when moses come he could not come with noah's message it wouldn't work because it was the seed of god at that time and when christ come he could not come at noah's age or noah's time message no so we have lived through luther's age resilience all done through the ages the pentecostal age and each age has given a promise of the word and the people of that age here we go that manifest that promised wood is the seed of that age let's think a little bit the people of that age that manifest that promised word is the seed of that age according to what jesus said here they are the children of the kingdom and then he made a statement the manifestation of the holy spirit operating through his children is those seed of the kingdom at that time all right so watch the sower come to sow a seed but that seed have to unfold that seed have to ripen mature die unfold until it becomes manifested and the manifestation of the holy spirit operating in those children are the seeds so all of a sudden it changes from what the source so to the seed being made manifest in your life could we say amen oh hallelujah do you understand that so after is not the seed in the bible it's not the seed and spoken with books the seed you become the seed manifested or the word manifested or you become the living word itself and that makes you deceived for the age be sewer the seed the ground now for this process to work this spoken word which is what came out the mouth in revelation 10. seven thunders after their voices it it roar out that is what catch the bride them thunders that is what gives the bright field those thunders that is what showed about how to repair those standards it came out from the amount of god not some man in america the mount of god the mighty angel the one with the sweat backwards the one with the seventh seer that spoken word is the seed that comes into you and that seed is just a perfection seed oh glory okay next year tonight that seed has to begin to work itself out to bring you into perfection because that is where this sewing is about no farmer is sowing not a reap no farmer isn't suing not to have a harvest every single farmer that's who's looking for others this is a law since in genesis nobody here planting and they expect nothing it's just that sometimes it fall on the wayside but it's taken sometimes they fall on the stones they jump up for a while and dry up sometimes fall among torns but what he's really interested in is the good ground because only good ground is the way you get fruit some 34 some 64 some 100 fold all may not bring forth at the same measure but fruit is guaranteed on the good ground listen it is guaranteed on your good groom oh could we give you some praises tonight i hope this encourages you and let's continue now now the green seed in the original fella nicea it was the first denomination notice here the life here we go that was in the stalk in the tassel now ends up in the seed so not what he's talking here now is the unfolding of the life the devil crushed the church through the dark ages it went on to grow devastated finish that time we know coming up the life they can turn forward to the tassel is tall now the original is the seed the pasta is not like the seed this talk is not like the seed but the life have to unfold and this life unfolding is the revelation of the seven churches so put it simply the revelation of the seventh church ages is the revelation of the unfolding life of the seed through seven ages where the seed goes on the ground and actually it unfold itself until they come back to the seed in the last days that is why this message had to be perfect this message had to be perfection you could have to come back to the original so only gift could bring this message in his last day was a prophet because the word of the lord come to the prophet and the spoken word of god which is original seed have to come from the mouth of god man shall live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded to the mouth of god so god's more peace was a prophet that had to be on the earth to bring spirit given word word that cannot be challenged because it does save the lord so what we have tonight is a dossier the lord message despite all the craziness on the internet and negan brother branham and negan what he did and negan message we despite all of that this message is true it will come to pass oh praise all the prophecies that were spoken shall surely come to pass so let's continue let's continue the life that was in the storm castle ends up in the seed the life that comes out of the original seed comes through different processes three different processes and then turned back in its original condition and then brown said hallelujah oh my i am the happiest person in the world that god will let me see this watch how perfect the word and nature works together the life that was in the husk in this talk in the tassel gathers up in the seed and the life that was in the stalk one went to make the other then he says this year justification made away for sanitification certification made a way for the baptism of the holy ghost and the baptismal holy ghost made a way for the holy ghost itself to come down right down imperfection and back to the word my my my my my oh give him some praises give him some praises tonight wow hallelujah thank you lord jesus thank you lord jesus blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord keep worshipping them sins please be to jesus there is a lie tonight wow thank you lord thank you lord all of a sudden it seemed like everything that seemed to have just disappeared just like that this is really kind of weird but god is good all right we see what's happening here now right okay here we go so watch no okay so justification we may have with certification solidification made away for the bathroom holy ghost and the batman holy ghost made a way for the holy ghost itself to come right down in perfection and back to the word again to manifest itself so so so he's seeing that we have got to come to this where we get to connect back with the holy ghost itself not the gift of the holy ghost but the holy ghost itself so here we go now the tassel or the puddle then the husk then the husk comes the original seed not a seed it was the life of the seed growing through this to come to the seed do you see it what is it a resurrection coming back to a masterpiece again pentecost came out of wesley because presley was an organization pentecost came out as an organization then turned to one it had to to make the husk the true word of life on it was on this way to the original green through these stages to the stalk through the pollen into the husk and then it was made seed now let me wrap up here the stock castle husk they produce they were a holder of a certain portion of that sea life but when they organize life move out of it how many understand that when the churches denominate and life leave them there is no way for god to get back in because god could only move by the word so when a man put an interpretation to the word the spirit can't move it almost like if you switch from an electric wire and put a pipe put a pvc pipe current car flow to the pvc pipe so it comes like you cut the line and you replace the if the line to carry the current with some other line that is what interpretation does that is why the holy ghost was born at the river euphrates by queens and dogmas because god couldn't come back in the dogmas would not allow him to move back in the only way god can move back in is to get back on the word and that is why he talked about this angel right the manifestation of the holy ghost is that angel trying to get the people back to the word because he could only manifest the word he could only work through the word so all these years god have been trying to protect us from interpretation man's idea man's influence number six now number six i'd like to reign and rule over others i have no temperance himself so therefore that has been challenged and that's the whole nicolaitan spirit anointing the pope anointing the roman anointing the bishop archbishop and the iraqi anointing that looked over into the message and influenced so many lives wrongfully because you see the bride is not the bride of a man he's a wife of the lamb that's who you are tonight oh blessed be the name of the lord so let's go let's continue you know notice the seed is coming up that life is coming up not going back there'll be no more resurrection after this the life is coming up to go into its perfection a resurrection so you could now understand why brother branham says without perfection there's no resurrection think about it now not church now we have to come to perfection which is that joseph seed made manifest okay let me on your own church right now okay to understand this subject more clearly it will not be wise to approach it from the standpoint of the church through the ages up until now we have been thinking in terms of removal of names of individuals now we want to consider not the individuals but the groups represented in the church to do so we would liken the church through the ages to the weak plant a grain of wheat is planted to the end that a single grain of wheat will reproduce and multiply itself through a certain process during a certain period of time that single seed will die but in dying the life that was in it will come up into a plant which in turn will be the bearer or carrier of that life which is to come back to originality in a multiplied form jesus the great royal caesars died that much less one with the life of the church stands in the midst of the church for all 72 ages giving his life to the church the carrier or the bearer to the end his very life will be reproduced in bodies like unto his in the resurrection it is at the resurrection that the royal seed will see many royal seeds like unto himself and they will be even as he is for soul says john we shall be like him that is what john was referring to now the record of this week plan here we go whose end is to reproduce the original seed in multiple form is the book of life he talked about the record i repeat and this is the bomb the history or the record of this wheat plant is the book of life of which a part of the book of life is the record of eternal life a section of the book of life this is convincingly seen by examining the wheat plant a beer seed is sown soon a blade is seen but that is not the wheat yet then it grows into a stone that is not yet to eat life is there but not wheat then at the end of this talk is a little spike that sends out a tassel still a wheat plant but no weekend then the plant is pollenized we see the chaff grow this looks mighty like the wheat but it's not yet seed then forms the wheat in the husk it is now back to what is originally now the wheat is ripened the ripening which is harvested now jesus christ died he gave his life that life was to come back upon the church and bring many sons like him unto himself into the glory of the resurrection but as the wheat seed had to have a carrier there we go to bring forth multiplied wheat seed even so there had to be a church which would be the carrier of the life of christ as the blade stalked castle and husk were the carriers for the seed but not the seed itself oh excuse me so the church corporate through the ages has been the carrier of the true seed do not deceive itself that is why we can see the book of life is the whole week plan let's go it over again here is the original wheat plant that was planted it produced a blade that wasn't it it produced a stalk not it either become the husk which is wheat is to form that isn't it the tassel appears and then the pollen falls on those pistils part of that plant is quickened something of that original seed that came up through the rest of the plant turns into a seed why didn't the whole plant go into seed because it was created to that end as part of that plant can go back to being seed because just that part of that wheat plant is eternal life wheat you have a perfect type israel even egypt they all came out two million strong all escaped the sacrificial blood all the baptized at the red sea all came up in the water enjoying holy ghost manifestation all eat angel food all drunk of the rock that followed them yet except for a few they were not but carriers of the children who should follow them and go into the carrick canaan land all israel is not israel just a tiny minority but their names are blotted out to the book of life we have the same thing today in church names are going to be blotted out of the book of life no names will be blessed out of the book of eternal life but that is another record do contain in the book of life this is the record god had given us eternal life and that eternal life is in his son he that had the son had life eternal he that had not the son had not life eternal and those who have that life or in him before the foundation of the world they were chosen him before the foundation of the world that great royal seed jesus christ was planted he died and that life that was in him here we go oh glory this is great that life that was in him came up through the wheat plant and is reproducing itself in multitudes of wheat seeds having the same life in them and being like the original here we go because by spirit they are original not by book but by spirit they are original so to go back to perfection we have to go back to the original spirit which come by the original word which produced the original seed so the original seed brought the channel of the original word that the spirit could flow and that is why an adoption he says where god can say dear is my spirit flowing freely because the man have no hidden agenda no hidden motive newton object a hidden objective he manages that pipe and you would make him that type because he died himself and he become a pure channel of communication for inspiration to flow through so goku said there is my spirit flowing freely i'll find one i look i'll find the next one here we're gonna find the next one here look at that one here i'm gonna do with church then i'm gonna do it with camps in this camp and that next campaign you're hungry with that i have to do a man on god and the word of god okay so let me see look at him is he home straight here right now now here we are coming to conclusion as the eternal logos god was manifested in the sun and then jesus dwelt all the fullness of the goddess bodily and that eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gain the title of son so we here we go eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many-membered spoken word seed manifest in flesh and those eternal torts now manifest in flesh are the sons of god even as we are so called we did not become seed by the reboot we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed as a reason we could be quickened in non-seed there is nothing to quicken or give the law some praise on that oh glory to god the holy ghost doesn't make your seed it's because you are seed you can be reborn all right revelation chapter 14 reading from verse 12 here is the patience of the saints here they that keep the commandments of god and the fate of jesus and i heard a voice from heaven sinners of me right blessed are the dead which die in the lord hence from henceforth he seeth the spirit that they may rest from their labors and their works do follow them and i looked and behold a white cloud and upon the cloud was one satellite under the son of man having on his head a golden crown and listen what he has and in his hand a sharp sickle and another angel came out of the temple crying with a lord voice of him that sat on the cloud trust in thy sickle and reap for the time has come for dee to reap for the harvest of the earth is ripe verse 16 and he had sat in the cloud trust in his sickle on the earth and the it was reaped and another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven he also having a sharp sickle and another angel came out of the altar which had the power over fire and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp secret saying trust him thy sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth for her grapes are fully ripe and the angel trust in his sickle under the earth guarded the vine of the earth and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of god and the winepress was strutting without the city and blood came out of the wine press him unto the horse's bridle by the space of a thousand and six hundred followed chapter fifteen verse one and i saw another sign in heaven great and marvelous seven angels having the seven last plagues for in them filled up the wrath of god so i want you to see how gorchy is the earth are seeds planted sickle coming to harvest harvest the wheat and harvest the tears james five do you want to read verse seven and we're gonna close verse seven to ten be patient there for brethren unto the coming of the lord i want to encourage you to be patient behold the husbandman waited for the precious fruit of the earth and had long patience with it until he received the early a lot be also patient establish your hearts for the come of the lord joy at night grudge not one against another veteran they should be condemned behold the judge standing on the door before the door take my brethren the prophets who are spoken in the name of the lord for an example of suffering affliction and patience and i'm closing josiah 10 12 says so to yourselves in righteousness reaping mercy break up your follow ground for it is time to seek the lord to the common rain righteousness upon you so to yourselves in righteousness break the mercy break up your follow ground that ground is the uncultivated uncultivated areas in your heart break it up what is not cultivated the stony parts of your life the hard part you know we talk about the softness of faith that the the atmosphere that the secret growing it is time to seek the lord remember luke 8 15 but that on good ground a day which is an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bringing forth fruit with patience there's two more we finish romans 8 says 22 for we know the whole creation grown it traveled in pain again until now not only day but ourselves also we have the first food of the spirits even we ourselves grown within ourselves it's waiting for the adoption to with the redemption of our body for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man see what yet that he hoped for our last scripture tonight from hebrews 12 it says wherefore and here we go scenes church all of you here tonight listen closely as we wrap up tonight wherefore seeing we have also are compassed about with so great a thought of witnesses let us lay aside every wheat and the sin which not so easily beset us let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the autumn finisher of fate over the joy that was set before him endure the cross despising the shame and he sat down at the right hand of the throne of god tonight i want you to consider a look at your own self in the mirror to see what type of heart you're dealing with whether it's wayside stony thorny or good ground with the good ground you can be patient because that's what gonna bring fruit to perfection patient on his heart a good heart that's what god find the call you know now we read the script in hosea we'll break up the following talk about sometimes people say if the law will develop from this the lord will take this evil spirit from me the lord will do this we'll all do that he said it's up to you there's a part that you have to do to deal with your own heart condition to get your heart right to get your heart soft to get your spirit mellow that your husband you know this thing about new heart and new spirit he says god give you a new spirit to see if he could get along with you because with the hard heart and the old spirit the spirit of god can't even get along with that so that's why he said i take out your story i'll give you a new heart i'll give you a new spirit that new spirit is not the holy spirit it's a new spirit the birds singing different they feel good everything with a new spirit is a new spirit to help you work with the holy spirit but your promise is that third one new heart new spirit his spirit and this is where he want to get to let's pour his word of prayer almighty god tonight i thank you tonight for the grace and the help to share these words with your children with your people about the sore the seed and the ground lord the seed is perfect we are not responsible for the seed lord what we are really responsible for is how we turn to the ground how we deal with the ground of our own hearts lord one time he told the prophet be more sincere and he took time to fast and to pray i pray help us as we look towards that fast and it is coming friday to have that zoom primitive lord be with us lord jesus you told your disciples not if you're fast but when you fast and how you must fast we become part of our lives a full consecration of full dedication and that we not blame others on other things but we accept responsible responsibility for the part that we need to play in this hour that i commit them into your hands tonight i commit the tape that we play tomorrow at night then into your hands i commit their lives in their hands they zoom for a meeting that they are praying fast is coming friday and the service coming on sunday god bless your children bless the ministry the officers the elders the deacons the trustees father bless
