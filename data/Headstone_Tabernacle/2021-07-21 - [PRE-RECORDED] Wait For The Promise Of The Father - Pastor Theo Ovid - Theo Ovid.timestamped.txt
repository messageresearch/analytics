[23:44] blessed day that do his commandments
[23:46] that they may have a right
[23:48] to the tree of life and may enter into
[23:50] the gates into the city
[23:51] for without a dogs and sorcerers and
[23:53] hormones and murderers idolaters
[23:55] whosoever love it and make it a lie and
[23:57] i jesus have sent mine angel
[24:00] to testify unto you these things in the
[24:02] churches
[24:03] i am the root and offspring of david and

[24:19] oh praise god it's such a blessing to be
[24:21] here tonight
[24:23] and together around the wood of god and
[24:25] that is what we gather wrong
[24:27] here we're not gathering around
[24:29] newspaper clippings
[24:30] or talk chats or talk radios talk shows
[24:33] we come here to hear the word of god
[24:36] the news is the same as the different
[24:37] people crooks
[24:39] bandits steals information just
[24:41] different people happening too but this
[24:43] word is eternal
[24:45] this word have deliverance in it this
[24:47] would have power and
[24:48] this would have the encouragement and
[24:50] strength and grace
[24:51] what you need amen praise god amen so
[24:54] tonight
[24:55] title have is wait for the promise of
[24:57] the father the promise of the father
[25:01] not some minister not some pope not some
[25:03] bishop wait for the promise because god
[25:05] came and gave you a promise
[25:07] it's the promise of the father god gave
[25:09] you a promise
[25:10] he said behold i will send you elijah
[25:13] the prophet
[25:14] he sent elijah to the entire world
[25:16] that's that means this message belonged
[25:18] to all of us
[25:19] and he that is that elijah shall turn
[25:21] the hearts of the children back to the
[25:23] face of the fathers
[25:24] and when he say he mean his message so
[25:27] we don't even have our own message
[25:29] we preach another man's message oh
[25:31] praise the name of the lord
[25:33] so this promise of the father is from
[25:36] act
[25:36] from luke 24 this is jesus he said
[25:39] behold
[25:40] i send the promise of my father so all
[25:42] this thing about turning the hearts back
[25:44] to the faith of the fathers you have to
[25:45] know what the father has had
[25:47] you have to know what was promised to
[25:48] the father and you have to know what
[25:50] you're going back to
[25:51] hallelujah you're not going back to
[25:53] school you're going back to the father
[25:54] the faith of the fathers
[25:56] because these guys they had the original
[25:58] fate
[25:59] hallelujah they had the power of god
[26:01] among them is not right
[26:03] so when jesus these are guys without the
[26:05] holy ghost now
[26:06] these are guys that following son of man
[26:08] ministry these are guys that once was
[26:10] preaching had signs one of the miracles
[26:12] but there was not
[26:13] they didn't have permanent power they
[26:15] were anointed with temporary power
[26:18] to have a ministry to work with jesus
[26:20] they were under training under jesus
[26:23] they were under teachings under jesus
[26:25] but they had not yet received
[26:27] that resident personal power that is
[26:30] promised
[26:31] to make sons of god manifest because
[26:34] jesus by the word he said in the
[26:36] beginning of the word the word was with
[26:38] god and the word was god
[26:40] that's good but the word became flesh
[26:41] that's even better
[26:43] and the purpose the word become flesh is
[26:45] that he could connect to us to bring us
[26:46] back into position
[26:48] and the word became flesh and dwelt
[26:49] among us he came unto his own one
[26:52] his although receive him his own reject
[26:54] him but
[26:55] have whoever received him to them
[26:58] give me power not just more words but
[27:01] power
[27:02] to become the sons of god so all this
[27:05] jesus coming word made flesh is to bring
[27:07] an atmosphere
[27:08] a channel that we could become sons of
[27:12] god
[27:12] now when god talking about become sons
[27:15] of god we are sons of god
[27:16] but the sons of god he's talking about
[27:18] his attribute sons of the spirit
[27:21] that's a different thing that's not
[27:23] attribute in you
[27:25] and taught in you and germany that's not
[27:27] that's what we're talking about
[27:28] we're talking about coming in to be a
[27:30] manifested son a confirmed son
[27:33] a vindicated son if the issue is not
[27:35] about the sons you know is if you're
[27:37] coming into a manifestation
[27:39] oh glory to god so talk over and when
[27:41] talk over you have to see the results
[27:43] behold i come quickly my reward is with
[27:46] me
[27:46] so god gave us space the time to see
[27:48] what these sons these last days sons
[27:51] what they will do oh give the lord a
[27:54] shout
[27:55] we have the same subject the prophetic
[27:57] vision of the end time
[27:58] and our inspiration is the same as
[28:00] sunday let us hold fast to the
[28:02] professional of faith without wavering
[28:04] because he's faithful that promise he is
[28:06] faithful that promise
[28:08] oh glory to god if the past is a crook
[28:10] it doesn't matter he is faithful that
[28:11] promise
[28:12] he gave a promise and he can't lie god
[28:15] will change
[28:16] man god will change bishops god will
[28:18] change whoever have the change shake up
[28:20] this
[28:20] and shake up that blood but he's not
[28:22] going to change his promise to be
[28:24] with you oh glory to god he said by
[28:28] myself have i sworn
[28:30] and when god swear it got to happen oh
[28:33] do you believe that
[28:35] so this year what jesus said behold i
[28:37] send the promise of my father upon you
[28:39] by tiring the city of jerusalem until
[28:45] until they have a clear understanding no
[28:48] that is what they had before
[28:50] jesus spent hours with them open up
[28:51] their understanding open up the word
[28:54] open the seas of the old testament to
[28:56] reveal to them what must be released
[28:58] hallelujah so after they understand and
[29:01] open up with the kangaroo
[29:02] after the word open up they have
[29:04] something to receive
[29:06] they have not understanding to obama say
[29:08] i have an understanding no
[29:10] no no no it's understanding of what
[29:12] you're going to receive
[29:14] shout out receive you have to receive
[29:17] something
[29:18] you have to get something when you come
[29:20] to church you come to get something
[29:22] oh glory to god and what you come to get
[29:24] is beyond the letter of the word
[29:26] you come to receive power oh glory to
[29:29] god not when the press come down that's
[29:31] not the promise
[29:46] when the press come down want you to
[29:48] pull them that is the press coming on
[29:50] that is that but this is this
[29:54] so i'm not looking for press i don't get
[29:56] very bright honda
[29:57] look at the haunted somebody haunted me
[29:59] hunting me i'm looking for power
[30:02] this is the promise of the father i will
[30:04] deal with that when that comes
[30:06] but i've taken this here now did you
[30:08] hear what i'm saying
[30:09] i will deal with the press i will deal
[30:11] with haunted persecuted i will leave it
[30:13] all over in that time come
[30:14] but you see no this is the promise and
[30:16] this nobody can change that
[30:18] nobody can remove that from cyber there
[30:20] and nobody could stop you from accessing
[30:22] that
[30:23] because when jesus died at calvary he
[30:25] bust away from the top to the bottom
[30:27] and kill all the old testament high
[30:29] priest stuff
[30:30] that you could have direct access no
[30:33] mary
[30:34] no secretary nobody oh give the lord a
[30:37] shot i want you to see that tonight you
[30:39] know
[30:39] [Applause]
[30:41] you have to see that you know because
[30:44] the nicolaitan spirit come because
[30:46] they put all their anointing and power
[30:48] over on
[30:57] i hate that because he's a god of the
[31:00] audience
[31:01] i want to be among my people i want
[31:02] gonna walk among them i'm gonna talk
[31:04] among them i'm gonna live among them
[31:09] oh give the lord a shout hallelujah
[31:12] hallelujah
[31:14] hallelujah hallelujah glory
[31:17] so jesus purpose of coming in the earth
[31:19] wasn't the parade himself
[31:21] i said i'm the messiah i am god i'm the
[31:23] son of god no no no it wasn't that no no
[31:25] he came up specifically to pay the price
[31:28] to release his spirit to get to produce
[31:31] other sons
[31:32] where adam failed jesus couldn't fail so
[31:35] adam was supposed to reproduce sons
[31:37] sons of god adam fell he couldn't do it
[31:40] fell into sex and the flesh and whatever
[31:42] it is but when jesus come
[31:44] he come to release the word because you
[31:46] have to be born by the word
[31:48] you must be born again by the word and
[31:49] spirit so jesus came to bring the word
[31:52] to bring us back to the garden of eden
[31:54] before the fall
[31:55] let us make man in our image and like
[31:57] this that was spoken word man that was
[32:00] man to be born by the word and spirit
[32:02] so when he sent a prophet to gather all
[32:04] this scattered word to tie back in the
[32:06] word
[32:07] to bring down the holy ghost was to
[32:08] bring back the image of god back on the
[32:10] earth again
[32:11] so we are not normal sons praise that's
[32:14] why paul said i didn't come
[32:16] among you with words of enticing man's
[32:18] words
[32:19] but i came to preach that power that
[32:21] your faith may rest not in man
[32:23] but in the power of god your faith can
[32:26] rest on a man
[32:27] or give the lord a shout i will say it
[32:29] again your faith
[32:34] your faith cannot rest on a man you have
[32:37] to rest in the power of god
[32:44] behold i send the promise
[32:48] of my father upon you
[32:52] that is a whole message myself behold
[32:55] let everybody else would be a lie don't
[32:58] listen to nobody else
[33:00] jesus talking behold i
[33:03] who talking i send the promise of the
[33:07] father
[33:08] upon you hallelujah i sent it to an
[33:11] ex-man
[33:12] i attended through some bishop i settled
[33:14] upon you
[33:15] hallelujah but tarry in the seat of
[33:17] jerusalem
[33:18] until you be endured poor
[33:22] from on high not powerful i'm shaking
[33:24] the pasta hand
[33:25] not perfume section or some taking hand
[33:28] power
[33:29] from where that power coming from that
[33:31] power not come from the earth
[33:33] that power comes on high and he led them
[33:36] as fast to bethany
[33:37] he lifted up his hands and blessed them
[33:40] and it came to pass now they saw him
[33:41] jesus they was crying about and they had
[33:43] one woman jesus jesus god he was dead
[33:45] and they're crying and they're sad and
[33:46] everything else you know this time he
[33:48] was saying he blessed them i bless you
[33:51] he says ascend the power promise of the
[33:55] father upon you wait for the promise of
[33:57] the father
[33:59] oh glory to god the breath of god is
[34:01] upon them
[34:02] the word is open up to them the faith is
[34:05] in their soul
[34:06] nothing could stop them they are afraid
[34:08] to shut the doors because
[34:10] them romans looking for them looking for
[34:13] these disciples looking for these type
[34:14] of jesus they close it off but they're
[34:15] waiting
[34:17] they're waiting until but they're
[34:19] waiting in a certain atmosphere
[34:21] they're waiting idling their way to
[34:23] frustrated are fed up
[34:24] how long are we saying no and all these
[34:26] 40 years no they're not talking that
[34:28] kind of talk
[34:29] they're not waiting in that spirit they
[34:31] know god is faithful
[34:32] they know god can't lie they know they
[34:35] could hold in the promise
[34:36] they know they can have confidence in
[34:37] what god said oh glory to god so they
[34:40] are waiting
[34:41] they're waiting on something people
[34:43] laughing at them but they're still
[34:44] waiting
[34:45] people claim to have this and claim to
[34:47] have that but they're still awaiting
[34:48] oh glory to god because man didn't make
[34:50] the promise and man can't keep the
[34:52] promise
[34:53] and god is big enough to promise if he's
[34:55] big enough to promise he is big enough
[34:56] to bring his promise to path
[34:58] or give the lord a shout tonight i will
[35:01] say it again
[35:02] if god big enough to make a promise he
[35:04] is big enough to bring that promise to
[35:05] pass
[35:06] i don't care what the circumstances look
[35:08] like
[35:10] [Applause]
[35:12] now we're getting excited glory to god
[35:16] that is why i read the scripture he that
[35:18] observed the wind shall not sow
[35:20] what does that mean it means
[35:24] you don't regard the circumstance you
[35:26] don't regard what your eyes see
[35:28] you don't regard what the heirs here
[35:31] that is
[35:31] nothing to you you're not regarding not
[35:34] what anybody else is saying
[35:35] you only oh glory to god when everybody
[35:38] watching you are sowing
[35:40] when you don't want to reap you are
[35:41] reaping you will do
[35:43] exactly opposite to what all the sense
[35:45] and humanistic realm
[35:47] is acting up hallelujah praise god
[35:50] [Applause]
[35:52] so we're not observing the wind
[35:57] we're not observing anything external
[36:00] focus on the promise
[36:02] the promise of the father and when you
[36:05] what we got
[36:08] he that observer the wind shall not sow
[36:11] correct
[36:13] i can't show but look at the condition
[36:17] everybody waiting for the right
[36:18] condition to act
[36:21] the right atmos right everything will be
[36:23] nice and
[36:25] and all with the eyes had to see and the
[36:26] heirs here they conde
[36:28] and just and the bride is completely
[36:30] opposite to that
[36:32] because when a man look at sarah if
[36:33] abraham take on sarah looks
[36:36] abraham you sure are you sure
[36:42] but because of what was revealed to
[36:44] abraham it was
[36:45] just looks and condition and wrinkle and
[36:48] age
[36:49] was irrelevant the baby said he called
[36:51] the things and not as though they were
[36:54] he flipped the script on the devil when
[36:57] the devil expect him to depress he was
[36:59] joyful
[36:59] when they expect devil expected to be
[37:01] sad he was happy when the
[37:03] devil expected to be sitting down he was
[37:04] standing up oh glory to god and
[37:07] god and god say that is faith and i have
[37:10] proven that and counting
[37:13] counting that kind of faith as
[37:15] righteousness
[37:17] do i hear a shout in the house do you
[37:19] see god
[37:20] working with this human instagram thing
[37:25] [Applause]
[37:25] [Music]
[37:28] so unless you come to this spot to
[37:29] demonstrate active faith
[37:31] you just in the flesh natural believer
[37:35] hallelujah that's why he said ultimate
[37:37] group of the true see the word god would
[37:38] present the beloved bride
[37:40] because in that group of the true seed
[37:41] of the word you have natural and
[37:43] spiritual
[37:44] and the spiritual could be called out
[37:46] because the spiritual is the seed of
[37:47] abraham
[37:48] oh glory to god do you believe that
[37:51] still trying to come to reception he
[37:52] came in the past he blessed them
[37:54] he passed from them tied up in the
[37:55] heaven and they worshipped him
[37:57] and they returned to jerusalem with with
[38:00] smiles
[38:01] no it didn't say that here you know
[38:03] smiles and joys are the same thing you
[38:05] know
[38:06] yeah yeah yeah smile and joy joy let's
[38:08] enjoy this bubble up joy
[38:09] people before i even say anything people
[38:11] know it up on you already
[38:13] great joy somebody said great joy great
[38:15] joy
[38:16] hallelujah the message short of that
[38:20] people just going through the motion but
[38:22] they had great joy
[38:24] and that great joy now they were
[38:26] continually in the temple
[38:28] continually in the temple it wasn't
[38:31] staying home continually
[38:32] temple praising and blessing god has
[38:35] some big shots staying home and just

[46:18] fanatic now all this adoption talk is
[46:20] not the question of sonship you know
[46:22] it's a question of behavior it's not the
[46:24] question of simmons
[46:27] and teachings and revelation speech will
[46:29] be
[46:30] any pulpit adoption is sovereignly based
[46:33] upon behavior
[46:35] i don't think you get that
[46:39] if that is not so then sisters can be
[46:40] adopted because is the preach
[46:42] so the mighty sermon that is behind the
[46:44] pulpit that's not being adopted you know
[46:47] god doesn't have to defend this money
[46:48] now go to adopt any person
[46:53] and for god to adopt the person the
[46:56] behavior of that person
[46:57] have to be examined not by men
[47:01] but by god so you have the holy spirit
[47:05] the tutor the guide to report back to
[47:08] the father
[47:09] on people's behavior so then he said
[47:12] behold i come with me my reward with me
[47:14] to reward every man according to his
[47:17] work shall be
[47:18] so we don't have to boast we don't have
[47:21] to raise a big flag
[47:22] the works will speak for itself the
[47:25] results will speak for itself
[47:28] one and one will always equal two you
[47:30] could never make one on one tree
[47:35] much after adam so when you say the
[47:37] master adding up you know something's
[47:38] not right
[47:40] and you must not add enough they must
[47:41] have to add up oh praise the name of the
[47:43] lord
[47:44] are you with me now so then the issue
[47:47] becomes not sons these are brothers your
[47:48] son these are sons of son no it's what
[47:50] kind
[47:54] do i hear man the issue is not sons and
[47:57] daughters is what kind of daughter
[47:59] is what kind of a son i know you're a
[48:01] son i know you're a daughter but what
[48:04] kind
[48:07] and that kind have to do with your
[48:09] behavior
[48:12] not belief that's a big one that's the
[48:16] big one
[48:17] let me say it again not belief
[48:21] but behavior because there are a lot of
[48:23] people confessing beliefs
[48:25] but the behavior is horrible
[48:28] the behavior is nasty the behavior is
[48:30] evil and jealous and wicked
[48:32] the behavior is intentionally evil and
[48:35] in church
[48:42] hallelujah so many are called by the
[48:45] shout
[48:46] but a few could be called by the voice
[48:50] hallelujah i say it this way they shout
[48:53] call three kind of believers
[48:57] william branham malachi for a short
[48:59] message it calls three kinds
[49:01] but only one can go into rapture they
[49:04] believe i believe they're kind
[49:06] hallelujah it's called virgins
[49:10] but only the wise because they're wise
[49:12] and foolish
[49:13] it's a wise behavior and foolish
[49:15] behavior hallelujah it have wise action
[49:18] and foolish actions
[49:20] oh god come on come on now come on now
[49:23] a wise version is a wise version not a
[49:26] stupid version
[49:27] not a foolish version but a wise version
[49:30] she knows she has to get extra oil
[49:32] [Music]

[52:34] revelation
[52:35] i can't give you revelation the holy
[52:37] ghost alone holds the key to revelation
[52:39] only the holy ghost will give you
[52:41] revelation
[52:44] hallelujah all
[52:46] the preaching jesus preached three and a
[52:48] half years when jesus died them fellas
[52:49] busted him
[52:50] then went back fishing normal normal
[52:52] normal after three and a half years i'm
[52:53] not fishing three other half years i
[52:54] know the ministry of
[52:55] shadow man ministry when jesus is dead
[52:58] and gone all everything all for long
[53:00] flat like a pancake guys who preach guys
[53:03] what signs and wonders
[53:05] guys who see devils run guys who rejoice
[53:07] because devils and subjects are them
[53:09] when jesus died then go on them because
[53:10] no more no i'm a fisherman
[53:12] sick
[53:27] on the right side right side god you
[53:29] don't know what to do with god already
[53:31] only on your own on your own and when
[53:34] you're on your own you have plenty
[53:35] trouble
[53:36] you're on your own because you're on
[53:38] your own which fish all night you get
[53:40] naked
[53:42] sweating out of the whole night they're
[53:43] casting out to the right side reading
[53:45] them inside the cast of the net so they
[53:46] had to call for help
[53:48] because god spoke just so they had no
[53:51] fiction
[53:54] had no blessing this all the time you
[53:56] had nothing you know
[53:57] and all of a sudden you had to get extra
[53:59] help to collect
[54:01] to pick up to gather to draw in
[54:05] the amount of fish god have inside of it
[54:07] for you oh glory to god hallelujah
[54:10] that could be a one-man show you can't
[54:12] be a one-man fisherman
[54:15] oh glory to god there could be no one
[54:17] man showing up the amount of fish got
[54:19] housed out there
[54:21] oh my god
[54:29] he was always a sinful mother
[54:33] when christ comes he sees he only
[54:35] recognize this fish thing is god thing
[54:38] every time you vision like when he
[54:39] recognizes the lord
[54:45] practicing apostle
[54:48] pastor boxing preachers
[54:52] take them back sending men and bring
[54:54] them in a room and start to teach them
[54:57] he said hear what and from genesis
[55:00] to malachi you start to break that
[55:02] within them through them joel too
[55:05] she show description 28
[55:08] with stamina lips and another tongue i
[55:10] speak to these people show them all
[55:12] these scriptures
[55:13] so they had it clear peter fisher man
[55:15] carried on right but you know the
[55:16] scripture
[55:17] you know what when he comes he said this
[55:19] is that that the prophet jordan speaker
[55:21] he get it from jesus jesus fit
[55:23] everything into them
[55:25] so that they will look for the correct
[55:27] thing but watch something teaching and
[55:30] doctrine couldn't bring clarity
[55:32] it takes the dynamics to kill the
[55:35] confusion
[55:36] who right where right where right and
[55:38] who wrong and when right and i think he
[55:39] writers say it so
[55:40] i i i gather understanding i never see
[55:44] it so all i ever see it so you see when
[55:46] this is that come you have no i
[55:47] see it so this is that
[55:51] that the prophet speak of i'm not
[55:53] hearing you tonight
[55:55] i'm not hearing you tonight you
[55:57] understand that
[55:58] so it's not teaching the holy spirit and
[56:01] dynamics
[56:02] it brings clarity and clears out the
[56:04] confusion
[56:05] because by then the manifestation will
[56:08] be the interpretation
[56:10] god is interpreting his word then you
[56:12] say this day
[56:14] this scripture is fulfilled oh
[56:17] hallelujah praise be to jesus
[56:20] thank you lord to watch he said no if
[56:22] you call me to be funny from
[56:24] fanatic from this night on that very
[56:27] thing that i'm speaking of will be done
[56:30] there will be a
[56:30] power prophecy
[56:34] coming to the church he didn't say fight
[56:36] for ministry
[56:37] he didn't say men he didn't say some
[56:40] bishop or some message pope
[56:41] you almost see me always someone messes
[56:43] poop they have them
[56:45] that's why i see it and some of them
[56:48] know who i'm talking about
[56:50] some of them know the self one brother
[56:52] say every time
[56:53] brother you say my support i talk about
[56:56] him
[56:58] so he knew i talking about him i didn't
[57:00] know anything about him and i just
[57:01] identify message pope so he say
[57:03] let him keep fit where he kept said
[57:05] where's it yeah
[57:06] yeah he catch a revelation i see i i
[57:10] didn't say he's here
[57:10] i just said message pope because message
[57:12] pope wanted to be boss overall
[57:15] and they don't recognize that rank this
[57:16] cut off long time
[57:18] when god blessed you nicolette and
[57:20] spirit do you think right now you're
[57:20] encouraging the holy spirit
[57:22] but i like fire them this listen those
[57:25] believers bless them for listening to
[57:27] them all these you know
[57:28] they say you're not preaching what paul
[57:29] preached you are false
[57:31] then believe now i don't appreciate the
[57:33] believers what's boston so-called
[57:35] apostles i know we found them who said
[57:37] they're personal from them to be liars
[57:39] line apostle they have a lion angel by
[57:41] them they say they meet angel and the
[57:43] lion angel
[57:44] lying to them and them lying too so he's
[57:46] lying
[57:47] wing angel lying man angel
[57:51] you say that can't be that cannot be
[57:53] going to scriptures and lying demons got
[57:55] permission to receive a whole bunch of
[57:56] them he said let me drop upon them let
[57:58] all them 400 prophets
[57:59] lie with a lion spirit asked permission
[58:02] to go and drop on them
[58:04] to make them lie to bring to pass the
[58:06] word of god so don't tell me do i have
[58:08] no lying spirit
[58:10] it's a spirit you know making people lie
[58:12] normal normal normal
[58:14] i'm saying to hearing from god
[58:17] that's like if you don't know the word
[58:18] you get messed up you have to know the
[58:20] word
[58:21] not sign the wonders you have to know
[58:22] the word when you know the way they can
[58:24] check every demon every spirit
[58:26] i write for if an angel come from heaven
[58:28] and say any other gospel
[58:30] let them be a curse so when i hear them
[58:32] and just talking i want to hear what
[58:33] gospel they're preaching
[58:35] if they're saying what the prophet said
[58:36] because the spirit and the prophet and
[58:38] the bride will say the same thing
[58:40] and what they say will already be said
[58:42] in the word
[58:44] oh give the lord our show know where we
[58:47] stand then

[1:02:39] paul explained why his teaching wasn't
[1:02:43] with
[1:02:43] enticing words of man wisdom because
[1:02:46] when mind brings wisdom you are
[1:02:47] impressed with the man
[1:02:49] but his teaching was wrapped up in the
[1:02:51] power of god
[1:02:52] that your faith may not rest on wisdom
[1:02:55] but rest on power
[1:02:57] oh glory to god because when you see the
[1:02:58] power come forward then you know this is

[1:03:18] writer

[1:03:27] you shall receive power when
[1:03:34] oh glory all glory
[1:03:37] when when when the press come down
[1:03:40] that's not the scriptures
[1:03:41] that is not the word not when the press

[1:03:45] you receive power after the holy ghost
[1:03:47] come down upon you
[1:03:49] upon you upon you not upon the minister
[1:03:53] upon you you have got to get power

[1:04:18] [Applause]
[1:04:20] [Music]
[1:04:27] when you press come know what you did
[1:04:28] well then well that time always the
[1:04:29] building but right now
[1:04:31] you shall receive power after the holy
[1:04:33] ghost i'm upon you
[1:04:35] no that's holy ghost is not pentecost
[1:04:38] 1906. that's not luto or wesley
[1:04:41] he said the seven angels came from
[1:04:43] eternity
[1:04:44] to gather all the scattered word to tie
[1:04:48] it back into the word
[1:04:49] to bring down the holy ghost
[1:04:53] the object is to bring down the holy
[1:04:56] ghost
[1:04:56] because with the scattered world the
[1:04:58] spirit couldn't work
[1:05:00] because the conduit was broken through

[1:21:40] men that has capped off by charity the
[1:21:43] love of god
[1:21:44] let me see let me wrap up here
[1:21:48] jesus said i am the vine you're the
[1:21:49] branches but if that tree ever puts
[1:21:52] forth another branch
[1:21:54] it will bear its original fruit
[1:21:58] and there has got to be a restoration of
[1:22:01] all these things
[1:22:02] right at the end of the vine there is to
[1:22:05] be
[1:22:05] prophecy comfort a restoration
[1:22:09] and evening light to light it up and to
[1:22:11] make it right but it will come out of
[1:22:13] the vine
[1:22:14] not a denomination that's grafted into
[1:22:17] it
[1:22:17] and there will be a light in the evening
[1:22:19] time because it takes light
[1:22:21] to ripen it here we see so there's got
[1:22:23] to comfort our power
[1:22:25] shout out power i want you to see this
[1:22:29] we had 40 or 50 years of teaching
[1:22:33] of the revelation of these things being
[1:22:35] made known
[1:22:36] so god wanted this teaching to unveil
[1:22:40] and reveal the things that the prophet
[1:22:41] has revealed make it known
[1:22:43] but there has to come an hour where you
[1:22:45] get a manifestation
[1:22:47] of the things that have been revealed
[1:22:51] hear the prophecy
[1:22:53] there's got to comfort power the holy
[1:22:56] spirit
[1:22:56] himself to ripen
[1:23:00] or to vindicate or to prove this is
[1:23:03] about around
[1:23:04] or to make manifest what he predicted
[1:23:06] would happen this day
[1:23:08] the evening light produces that water
[1:23:10] time
[1:23:11] oh give the lord may the lord i shout
[1:23:16] hallelujah hallelujah my lord can you
[1:23:18] take a little more
[1:23:20] glory of course you can take a little
[1:23:21] more you'll leave your house to come

[1:23:23] they come to go back home
[1:23:24] they come here to take something ezekiel
[1:23:27] 37 we know the spiral
[1:23:28] the heart of the law was upon me value
[1:23:30] of drag bones he caused me to pass
[1:23:32] a wronged them about and behold there
[1:23:34] were very many open valleys although
[1:23:36] they were very dry i like that
[1:23:37] description very dry
[1:23:39] very very dry he said let me solomon can
[1:23:41] these bones lift
[1:23:43] watch this god bring ezekiel the value
[1:23:47] for the dry bones
[1:23:48] and ask a question look at that
[1:23:51] look at the condition tell me if that
[1:23:54] could live
[1:23:58] now if you watch with your eyes nice
[1:24:01] bones
[1:24:02] let me walk over there that like a
[1:24:05] cemetery
[1:24:06] nice dry bones what you gonna say
[1:24:12] i say oh lord god don't do it
[1:24:18] he said unto me prophesy upon these
[1:24:20] bones and see unto them
[1:24:22] all dry bones hear the word of the lord
[1:24:27] not hear your feelings because your
[1:24:28] feelings you can't talk with your
[1:24:30] feelings
[1:24:31] just hear the word you're speaking the
[1:24:32] word to your dry condition you're
[1:24:34] speaking the word
[1:24:36] to your dry daughter son whatever
[1:24:38] condition whatever drawing you speak in
[1:24:40] your word your situation that's why you
[1:24:41] can't look at the style
[1:24:42] and the moon to speak a condition you
[1:24:44] have to look away from that
[1:24:46] to the circumstance here the man wow
[1:24:48] what is this how this could happen
[1:24:50] let's continue watch this prophecy under
[1:24:53] these bones and see under the bones hear
[1:24:55] there was the lord
[1:24:56] thus saith the lord unto these bones i
[1:24:59] want you to
[1:25:00] show you how god identified the end game
[1:25:05] and i answered and said don't know it he
[1:25:08] said unto me
[1:25:08] prophesy upon these bones and say unto
[1:25:12] them
[1:25:12] all ye dry bones hear the word of the
[1:25:15] lord
[1:25:16] thus saith the lord unto these bones
[1:25:17] behold i
[1:25:19] will cause breath to enter into you
[1:25:22] and ye shall live
[1:25:26] so from the very start he is saying
[1:25:29] bread
[1:25:30] is coming into them bones now he's going
[1:25:33] to go through the process
[1:25:35] of how the bread gonna come into the
[1:25:36] bones
[1:25:38] we know the bread coming but it have to
[1:25:41] have a process
[1:25:42] for it to come to the bread stage or
[1:25:44] give the lord a shell
[1:25:46] so when a prophecy comes it identifies
[1:25:48] the end you shall receive power

[1:30:21] i think i'm going to finish with this
[1:30:22] quote it's one of my favorites i have
[1:30:24] favorite quotes the one of my favorites
[1:30:27] like israel back in her homeland she was
[1:30:29] automatically
[1:30:30] she was just automatically put there why
[1:30:33] national force put her in her place
[1:30:37] true who hitler eichmann stalin god used
[1:30:40] them to drive his right back to the
[1:30:42] homeland
[1:30:43] he said a gentle hand of jehovah guiding
[1:30:45] them back
[1:30:46] oh glory to god a gentle hand six
[1:30:49] million jews died
[1:30:51] and it's called the gentle hand of
[1:30:53] jehovah guiding back to the promised
[1:30:55] land guiding them into position
[1:30:57] yes i'm going to say something are you
[1:30:59] ready he's a national force but israel
[1:31:01] in the homeland
[1:31:03] national force will put the church
[1:31:06] in the world of churches but the power
[1:31:10] of god
[1:31:11] will put the people in the bride
[1:31:16] you want to be in the bride it takes the
[1:31:18] power of god
[1:31:20] to put you inside a deer not a man not a
[1:31:22] church
[1:31:23] not a doctrine not a teaching not a
[1:31:25] revelation
[1:31:26] it will take the power of god let me say
[1:31:29] it again not a man
[1:31:31] not a church not a doctrine not a
[1:31:33] teaching but the power of god
[1:31:36] whatever we teach whatever we preach it
[1:31:38] has to produce
[1:31:40] the power of god let's finish the quote
[1:31:43] are we going to close
[1:31:45] so i'm going to get your song national
[1:31:47] forcept isn't on homeland
[1:31:49] national force will put the church in
[1:31:51] the world comes the churches
[1:31:52] but the power of god will put the people
[1:31:55] in the bride
[1:31:56] the world forces this way the world
[1:31:58] forces that way
[1:31:59] but god forces upward the spirit of god
[1:32:02] which is the word of god
[1:32:03] because my word is spirit and life will
[1:32:07] put the bride in her place cause she
[1:32:09] will recognize a positional word
[1:32:12] then she's in christ we'll put her in a
[1:32:14] place
[1:32:15] no national force will do it if all
[1:32:18] peter needed
[1:32:20] was his understanding to be opened
[1:32:23] and the book to be opened then there was
[1:32:25] no need for him to go in the upper room
[1:32:28] peter could have explained to people i
[1:32:30] know what god said in the word
[1:32:33] peter could have explained what jesus
[1:32:35] explained he could have shared what
[1:32:37] jesus said to them he can share the
[1:32:38] others
[1:32:39] but jesus tell them listen man with all
[1:32:41] you know
[1:32:42] with all your understanding no upper
[1:32:44] room
[1:32:45] you have to wait for the promise of the
[1:32:46] father hallelujah tarry in the city of
[1:32:49] jerusalem until
[1:32:50] until until you
[1:32:54] receive power from on high when you
[1:32:56] receive that you'll be positionally
[1:32:58] placed by power
[1:32:59] not by revelation but by power and
[1:33:02] brother branham said gogo calls him
[1:33:03] aside
[1:33:04] some sons aside by power by
[1:33:06] manifestation
[1:33:08] i know what some sons know is moving by
[1:33:10] revelation and by inspiration and so but
[1:33:12] he's going to call some sons
[1:33:13] by power being placed by power
[1:33:16] joseph was in prison oh glory to god
[1:33:19] interpret into the butler interpreting
[1:33:20] into the baker but he had to be placed
[1:33:23] by power through process hallelujah
[1:33:27] god had to leave joseph to struggle a
[1:33:28] little while suffer a little while
[1:33:30] drop a dream work up things that he will
[1:33:33] send for joseph
[1:33:34] let him interpret this thing and when
[1:33:36] god joseph interpreted he was placed
[1:33:39] in power you can't be in power with no
[1:33:41] authority
[1:33:42] put on the devil since sitting there
[1:33:44] poor one good liar sitting inside the

[1:34:11] [Applause]
[1:34:13] david had no listen they have no fear
