[21:40] scripture tonight Luke chapter 11 we

[21:45] Philippians chapter 3 I want to read
[21:48] from verses 13 to 14 and Ephesians 4 I
[21:52] want to read verse 11 to 13 and the
[21:56] title of the message tonight is
[21:57] perseverance there's one word as we have
[22:01] one would do we have one would run with
[22:05] perseverance reading from a look
[22:13] chapter 11 with one came the pass as he
[22:17] was praying in a certain place when he
[22:20] ceased one of these typos said unto Him
[22:22] Lord teach us to pray as John also
[22:25] taught his disciples and Jesus said unto
[22:28] them when you pray say our Father which
[22:30] art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy
[22:33] kingdom come thy will be done as in
[22:36] heaven so in earth give us this day by
[22:41] day our daily bread forgive us our sins
[22:44] for we also forgive everyone that is
[22:48] indebted unto us and lead us not into
[22:51] temptation but deliver us from evil and
[22:53] he said unto them which of you have a
[22:56] friend I shall go in unto him at
[23:00] midnight and seein time friend
[23:02] let me tree lose for a friend of mine is
[23:05] in his journey has come to me and I have
[23:08] nothing to set before him and he is from
[23:10] within shall answer troubled me not the
[23:13] door is now shut my children are with me
[23:15] in bed I cannot rise and give thee I
[23:18] send to you though he will not rise and
[23:21] give him because he's his friend but
[23:23] this part is very important he's not
[23:25] going to rise because he's your friend
[23:29] yet because of his importunity one on a
[23:34] line that were an opportunity he would
[23:36] rise and give him as many as he needed
[23:39] and I said to you ask it shall be given
[23:42] you seek ye shall find knock it shall be
[23:45] opened unto you for every one that
[23:47] asketh receiveth he that seeketh findeth
[23:49] and to him that knocketh it shall be
[23:51] opened we're gonna stop right there what
[23:56] about the next scripture and this is
[23:58] Paul speaking in Philippians chapter 3
[24:01] verse 13 brethren I count not myself
[24:03] table apprehended but this one thing I
[24:06] do forgetting those things which are
[24:09] behind and reaching forth underdosing
[24:11] who shall before I press towards the
[24:15] mark of the prize of the high calling of
[24:17] God in Christ Jesus our last scripture
[24:21] from Ephesians of the four was 11 and
[24:23] they gave some apostles and some
[24:24] prophets
[24:25] some evangelists and some pastors and
[24:29] teachers for the perfecting of the
[24:30] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[24:33] the edifying of the of the body of
[24:36] Christ till we all come into the unit of
[24:38] fate unity of the faith and of the none
[24:40] of God unto a perfect man unto the
[24:43] measure of the stature of the fullness
[24:45] of Christ may God bless his word you may
[24:47] be seated
[24:48] praise be to Jesus annalee amplified of
[24:53] Philippians of the tree
[24:55] Paul was seeing here in verse 13 I do
[24:58] not consider brethren that I've captured
[25:01] and made it my own yet but one thing I
[25:05] do it is my one aspiration forgetting
[25:09] what lies behind and straining forward
[25:14] to what lies ahead I like that part
[25:18] streaming forward towards lies I had I
[25:23] press on to what the goal to win the
[25:27] supreme and heavenly price to which God
[25:30] in Christ Jesus and calling us upward
[25:34] hallelujah that's how we press in
[25:37] straining not just waiting for something
[25:39] to come here with straining pushing
[25:42] press him he pressed towards the mark of
[25:45] the cycle so the ninety tireless
[25:47] perseverance the subject is the bright
[25:49] slippery cool another an inspiration the
[25:52] high calling in Christ Jesus hallelujah
[25:56] the high callin in Christ Jesus
[25:59] and there's another context if I wanted
[26:01] to use from sin John 15:7
[26:03] if he abide in me and my words abide in
[26:06] you you shall ask what you will and
[26:08] shall be done unto you herein is my
[26:11] father glorified that you bear much
[26:13] fruit so shall ye be my disciples so
[26:17] that much fruit is the target that much
[26:20] fruit is the goal Gordo just wants your
[26:23] beer he want to be a much fruit
[26:26] hallelujah believer no before he got to
[26:29] the much fruit part which is the target
[26:31] which is the goal which
[26:33] adoption which is God's purpose that he
[26:36] wants in your life
[26:37] he doesn't want Baroness he doesn't want
[26:39] never on food for life he wanted to be
[26:42] something he wanted to produce something
[26:44] he wants something from you before we
[26:47] get to the target he said I am the vine
[26:50] same chapter of 50 novel of John all
[26:54] right I am the true vine not vine the
[26:56] True Vine and my father is a husband man
[26:59] hallelujah
[27:00] every branch in me that beareth NOT
[27:03] fruit he taketh away if you know I be a
[27:06] nothing you go cut you off you don't
[27:08] want your unfruitful you can't be on
[27:11] your own
[27:12] hallelujah I have to find out how you
[27:14] could fulfill this will of God how you
[27:16] could connect to the program of God
[27:18] because this is the vision be made clear
[27:21] or being made plain because if you don't
[27:24] know what the goal is you can't press if
[27:26] you don't know what it is you can't go
[27:28] on to it you just making signals but you
[27:31] have to have a sense of direction of
[27:33] where is the goal where's the target
[27:35] what am I not hallelujah because in life
[27:39] if you don't have a target if you're
[27:40] over em you'll just go to life aimlessly
[27:42] just wonder and praise God making
[27:45] circles in the wilderness but when you
[27:47] have a target you holding our friends
[27:49] who connect it with that target you have
[27:51] Scripture committed to that target
[27:52] you're thinking about that target you're
[27:55] pressing towards that goal you're
[27:57] sleeping about it you're thinking about
[27:59] it you're dreaming about it you're
[28:01] talking about it you're eligible about
[28:03] it because in that target you wanna
[28:05] watch oh oh glory know God hallelujah
[28:07] and our target is a high calling
[28:11] not many a call to this thing you not
[28:15] calling everybody else some can be
[28:17] slackers but not you some could like but
[28:19] not you something put water and do that
[28:22] but not you
[28:23] because you have a higher calling or
[28:25] chlorine or go ahead and turn Mack your
[28:27] press on your veer towards this
[28:30] high callin every branch in me that
[28:32] beareth NOT fruit he take it away and
[28:34] every branch in me that beareth fruit he
[28:37] purges it that it may bring forth more
[28:40] fruit or glory Devon or fruit you're not
[28:43] gonna make it and when they started when
[28:44] food these are the purge
[28:46] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah poor
[28:51] glory does go when you see people when
[28:52] you see people going to stuff to know
[28:54] that they're in something so course at
[28:56] the place them because they have
[28:57] something that they start to produce
[28:58] something on us well I should have gone
[29:00] see something like separation but then
[29:02] here come here come here
[29:05] chop them here chop them here what's the
[29:07] purpose of that let's continue now you
[29:09] were clean to the world which I've
[29:11] spoken unto you abide in me and I in you
[29:16] as the branch cannot bear fruit of
[29:19] itself except it abide in the vine so he
[29:23] gives you know that you can be a fruit
[29:25] on your own you can feel led to bear
[29:28] your own fruit you in trouble hallelujah
[29:31] there's only one way to bear fruit you
[29:33] have to abide in me and I in you Oh

[46:24] fruit who laughing now they laugh at you
[46:27] The words were chosen and life

[46:41] talking about child trained
[46:44] sanctification in behavior conduct
[46:52] maturing right Ninh seasoned and
[46:58] adoption so in other words becoming more
[47:01] mature you handling your problems
[47:04] differently because you're not like a
[47:07] child when you're like a child you speak
[47:08] like a child you act like a child but as
[47:10] they become mature we seen issues that
[47:13] you're mishandled 20 years ago your
[47:15] copies doing the same stripping us now
[47:17] you have to handle it better because
[47:20] you're 20 years older in mine and spirit
[47:24] isn't that right hallelujah praise God
[47:29] so God is wanting his sons to come into
[47:32] this maturity of this wood Abidin and I
[47:37] want to get something because it's
[47:39] coming from my heart from this touch a
[47:41] perfect man
[47:41] I know his things that we heard before I
[47:44] don't want to take too long with you but
[47:46] here we go
[47:47] 72 changes seven steps God building his
[47:54] church is like one person individual so
[47:57] this is what God hid from the devil the
[47:59] seven steps the devil did not know that
[48:03] truly ages God was actually bringing
[48:06] steps
[48:07] that will be in his people as
[48:10] individuals so don't want to stare
[48:14] detail changes I want to bring it on to
[48:15] the individual so all these mysteries
[48:18] here we go
[48:19] that was hidden truly ages is
[48:30] he's in you because the mystery is
[48:35] Christ and every age Christ was the
[48:38] mystery that was hit and revealed
[48:49] you
[49:02] the mystery unfolded and what holy life
[49:05] thundered against the devil in every age
[49:07] because the devil did not could not
[49:09] pursue a canary age even in the Dark
[49:12] Ages when he was killing them thus he
[49:14] was going on
[49:23] you
[49:33] come pentecost up results on william
[49:36] alley and random so the devil lost about
[49:38] their age or chlorine up caught by the
[49:41] oxen item Pagal on anoint him
[49:43] spider-man anoint him by the eagle
[49:45] anoint him
[49:56] you
[50:52] is one buddy I know
[51:01] you
[51:23] that life and remain
[51:59] magneton to pay them
[52:10] you
[52:26] the same he brought his church up the
[52:28] same way he is bringing his people up
[52:29] here Peter said first seven things faith
[52:33] virtue knowledge temperance patience
[52:35] godliness brotherly love
[52:45] hissing of the Holy Ghost and you got
[52:48] all these virtues shielding you so the
[52:51] Pentecostals did not have the true
[52:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost they were
[52:58] still in the womb
[52:59] they were still be lucky because the
[53:01] word produced a bit and the Prophet had
[53:04] the word to produce the Brit so the
[53:08] pelicans I didn't have that bit or glory
[53:10] of God all right
[53:17] and you got all these what you see on
[53:19] you then then God lives in a tabernacle
[53:26] she wore it was come upon you then God
[53:30] lives in a tabernacle called the
[53:32] building the living tabernacle of the
[53:35] living costume Allen please when a man
[53:38] possesses these kind of things then the
[53:42] holy will come upon you now the Holy
[53:46] Ghost came upon Judas Peter all the
[53:52] sciples 82 of them but the deadly
[53:57] virtues in them that Holy Ghost upon
[54:01] them because Christ gave them power to
[54:05] work with him
[54:08] and you can work with Christ with books
[54:10] and tapes and hung out tracts you have
[54:12] to have got the anointing of Christ so
[54:14] he placed and anointed he said Judas
[54:17] ministries was not inferior to anyone
[54:18] else he was anointed with the same only
[54:23] cause Peter was anointed with but there
[54:25] was no virtues inside idea and he was a
[54:27] devil but he was anointed with spirit so
[54:32] he's not talking body anointing or
[54:34] spirit he's talking about the virtues in
[54:36] and the whole in compounds that that's
[54:41] different
[54:42] good we get it all that show that is
[54:45] different so do you see what you're
[54:49] fighting for
[54:49] you fighting for that you're not
[54:53] fighting for some anointing you're
[54:55] fighting for that to come into the
[55:02] measure of the stature of Jesus Christ
[55:07] that is the bright really cool to be a
[55:10] perfect 180 yeah I want to be perfect to
[55:13] go to heaven you you would have want to
[55:15] be perfect no you will be perfect on the
[55:17] earth
[55:18] what yes people look at me like a
[55:22] strange things I don't want to
[55:25] prove it to you membrane automata
[55:26] poofing manna needs God said so I can't
[55:29] explain that my intellect is that under
[55:31] figure at all I am going to be a perfect
[55:34] man on the do it
[55:37] [Music]
[55:39] thank my prophecy perfect man that's
[55:43] what promised
[55:44] I want nothing short of that I want a
[55:47] man hoping for the grace of God Oh
[55:48] perfect man
[55:49] got it yeah when my father glorified
[55:52] perfect man but I do wanna make a
[55:54] perfect man God will be glorified in you
[55:56] perfect man 170 please the reveal is
[55:58] shown on me Oh glory to God
[56:01] that's a parcel ran it pleased God to
[56:04] reveal his son in me
[56:08] perfect man only eight everybody go have
[56:11] that perfection like a preacher only you
[56:14] know the Bible said till we all come in
[56:16] the unity of the faith if there are none
[56:19] of the Son of God unto the measure of
[56:21] the stature of the fullness of Christ or
[56:25] glory of God so you have a goal to get
[56:27] the measure your measure of the stature
[56:31] of the fullness Oh glory to but not your
[56:34] measurement North in your measure of the
[56:36] stature Oh glory to God
[56:39] when a man possesses these virtues then
[56:49] the Holy Ghost comes upon him he said no
[56:52] matter what you might speak in tongues
[56:53] you might be poisonous any gift that
[56:55] God's got you might do that but until
[56:57] here we go but I can't lay these virtues
[57:01] here go into you you are off the real
[57:06] true foundation of feet now these words
[57:10] are deep they are weighted words I like
[57:14] to call it
[57:14] listen this party and when these virtues
[57:17] grow in little different not brilliant
[57:25] Faden in virtue but if there was seven
[57:28] breadsticks and personally I go home
[57:31] seven deep spreads when these virtues
[57:38] grow in you added that then you are a
[57:41] living monument you are a living moving
[57:44] either then he talked about we're not in
[57:47] an imaginary way but we proceed also
[57:50] before a living God and he said I live
[57:52] in future
[57:56] you cannot comment tell me better to you
[57:59] I see did I see I see this in you I see
[58:01] that in you I went to preach that the
[58:02] other night there's a confirmation of
[58:04] what I see about you and I know like
[58:05] like you had opted but you already knew
[58:07] it don't come with that foolishness I
[58:12] have to know what's living in me you can
[58:18] tell me that and I'll be a receiver to
[58:22] accept what you tell me about me and I
[58:27] accepted you know since a sister send an
[58:30] email or citizen a confirmation of my
[58:32] adoption yeah run alternately anything
[58:36] bombed when I bought them from an eye
[58:45] [Music]
[58:50] god I have no comment of general didn't
[58:54] like the cheesy and fundamental that we
[58:55] write them so reason that's imagination
[58:58] a man's man yell Balram speak he would
[59:02] in Italy type that was not option God
[59:05] has given him to protest
[59:07] give him faith to move mountains Porto
[59:10] but as you know I'm a graffiti monk and
[59:12] booth and he said faith can bring
[59:15] miracles and that in my spiritual heart
[59:18] it has some people have ridiculous wager
[59:21] then Pentecostal used to take
[59:23] Peter and all the foot until I moved and
[59:24] I walk there was already a no they might
[59:31] come from some crazy kind of regional
[59:35] meeting understand somebody went a well
[59:37] that never had water in it or the well
[59:39] drops along take a class or what can
[59:40] said this I do in the name of Jesus
[59:42] Christ poor glass of water he where they
[59:43] spring up as a double water all kind
[59:47] Americas with Vlad what are going on a
[59:51] man say he speak to the time as the
[59:52] water come forth and what is the
[59:53] commodified I can explain them things
[59:56] but there's an adoption
[59:58] Paul say do I have faith to move
[1:00:01] mountains
[1:00:02] and have not the holy ghost itself
[1:00:05] coming upon me
[1:00:07] and that only coming when these virtues
[1:00:11] are in so when God sees it is that come
[1:00:14] facility your Bosca is fact it has
[1:00:21] nothing more to be added
[1:00:23] oh I feel like preaching right now
[1:00:25] listen he said when you want to get
[1:00:27] closer to God what you already seeing
[1:00:29] you want to grow in God because he's on
[1:00:33] the seventh step so you're stepping
[1:00:36] Leroy in future knowledge to get in the
[1:00:38] era what presence more glory more
[1:00:41] anointed and when you're soaked into the
[1:00:43] the brotherly kindness not already for
[1:00:45] the anointed to cap it off then you're
[1:00:48] no longer you when you see me you see my
[1:00:50] father because the vine and the branches
[1:00:52] blend into one
[1:00:54] now they vine have a direct connection
[1:00:57] when the vine likes that the flow if you
[1:01:00] had job done like like you put a lock on
[1:01:01] valve lady branch the branch would
[1:01:06] evolved it when if I look at the Sun in
[1:01:09] life even a bombs come up you're a piece
[1:01:12] of hatred a port fight it or just make
[1:01:16] some big valley odds lock of the
[1:01:18] anointing day when many many florists
[1:01:20] prefer to move day and this brother here
[1:01:22] the next brother this minister customer
[1:01:26] next minister the viola from there and
[1:01:28] he preached in looking for the anointing
[1:01:30] no one noise he don't understand he can
[1:01:31] look of that that that little thing lock
[1:01:33] him off you know then you see the church
[1:01:36] against the next stage then the whole
[1:01:37] church lock off their mana channel now
[1:01:40] just he and them alone them all to
[1:01:42] divine all together enough nothing
[1:01:43] Florizel there you know just talk just
[1:01:46] will this interpretation that's just
[1:01:49] human element human effort human
[1:01:52] unknowing tell human whatever they have
[1:01:54] no vine connected to branch for the flow
[1:01:57] of the Spirit because the up
[1:02:06] you
[1:02:19] times yes exactly oh I thought it was
[1:02:23] repaired Nicki Minaj's and church and
[1:02:24] pews and everything else oh no no no no
[1:02:26] no daddy shall I run the preparation
[1:02:28] that is like when you have a Christmas
[1:02:30] gift and you have a box and you have
[1:02:31] nice flowers and written and it and card
[1:02:34] and thing I learned some time is that
[1:02:36] what I only care who send this and after
[1:02:38] insane Oh holy and use a dirty object on
[1:02:40] quantum level excitement people who won

[1:03:02] me when that child isn't no fool and
[1:03:05] nothing you know it's rip it apart and
[1:03:07] then you have some straws I wrong with
[1:03:08] her that even make it worse straw is
[1:03:11] going everywhere they want to get them
[1:03:13] to the real thing so all this is like
[1:03:16] straw because this is not the church you
[1:03:19] are the church it's not the tabernacle
[1:03:22] you are the tabernacle
[1:03:23] you are going to be the temple
[1:03:25] somebody's a temple the temple of the
[1:03:29] Holy Ghost in other words you have on
[1:03:31] the tabernacle God hallelujah what else

[1:03:37] throne on earth is my footstool what
[1:03:40] house will you build me where the body
[1:03:43] has not prepared
[1:03:44] let's continue ho praise God and then
[1:03:47] God makes a living man a living image in
[1:03:49] his touch of God what is he doing he's
[1:03:51] doing the same thing Jesus did because
[1:03:53] he's walked and the same things he did
[1:03:55] because he's not imaginary thing there
[1:03:56] is a reality here you go but hungry
[1:03:58] there's a reality proves it you see what
[1:04:00] I mean you see all these virtues and
[1:04:02] these materials
[1:04:04] type them with the church messengers but
[1:04:06] the church it is now one of these days
[1:04:07] we're gonna take each one of these words
[1:04:09] and study them I'm sure the proves that
[1:04:11] all goes together I want to say tonight
[1:04:13] it all goes together this is the house
[1:04:16] of God dwells in not a building with a
[1:04:18] big Bell on top of it a big steeple but
[1:04:20] a buddy has dough prepared me a body
[1:04:22] that God could dwell in God can walk in
[1:04:24] gore can see in God can talk in go I can
[1:04:26] work in a living instrument
[1:04:28] instrumentality of God go out walking on
[1:04:30] to
[1:04:31] in you God walking in you for you I
[1:04:35] ripped my pistols read of all men and in
[1:04:37] the life that's in Christ being you
[1:04:39] you'll be at the life of Christ isn't
[1:04:42] that right you take the blood of a man
[1:04:44] out and embalm him the trouble of out of
[1:04:46] it is a lot a man a lot of them never
[1:04:48] get on barrel you take the blood out of
[1:04:49] a man he's gone then the only thing you
[1:04:52] could do to put another blood but blood
[1:04:53] back in him he's gonna live again
[1:04:55] he took it but oh no we have got to put
[1:04:57] the blood of Jesus in see that brings
[1:05:00] the fate of Jesus the virtue of Christ
[1:05:02] the knowledge of Jesus the temperance of
[1:05:05] Jesus Christ the patience of Jesus
[1:05:06] Christ
[1:05:07] regardless of Jesus Christ the burn
[1:05:08] Kaiser's and I like how he specified
[1:05:10] like that because you have your own
[1:05:11] natural body kindness in natural

[1:05:15] not sure we not talk about your natural
[1:05:16] stuff we talking about this is of Jesus
[1:05:18] Christ see so the blood follows the way
[1:05:22] all through the book of redemption and
[1:05:23] when that blood comes the brings life
[1:05:25] it's not right
[1:05:26] he said there is a perfect man of God
[1:05:29] when he possesses these virtues I didn't
[1:05:34] think I get that there is this is a goal
[1:05:37] this is a goal there is the perfect man
[1:05:41] of God so when I say but over he will
[1:05:43] prove money this is what talking about
[1:05:45] you know when he possesses these virtues

[1:09:05] also bring the broader bride to the ages
[1:09:09] till he brings this one complete church
[1:09:12] into here this my feet moves because my
[1:09:14] head says oh it can't move like my hand
[1:09:17] because it's my feet which I can't do
[1:09:19] the things that we did neither can the

[1:17:54] the undefined that of the Spirit life's
[1:17:56] at the floor and when them fellows get a
[1:17:59] little they gather together again they
[1:18:01] say Lord God send down your power that
[1:18:04] we could call back out and be a more
[1:18:05] fruit
[1:18:06] and that you be glorified them fellas
[1:18:09] was taken blows like nothing but it was
[1:18:12] running and operating for God there were
[1:18:15] channels of communications reporters
[1:18:17] entropy and he was not mean courts
[1:18:20] erroneous house among us he dead the
[1:18:24] holy God see what he was born in it's
[1:18:28] one Lord what and once you whole if you
[1:18:33] had to go to anybody with what's being
[1:18:36] asked such simplicity
[1:18:39] he's a major posture of it and God said
[1:18:41] this being you have to have this being
[1:18:43] let me drop this bomb on you something
[1:18:46] you're familiar with always seen it
[1:18:48] he said the ministry has reached
[1:18:51] perfection when Christ is made manifest
[1:18:54] in natural
[1:19:01] that is the word mean
[1:19:35] listen the whole structure of your bein
[1:19:39] is governed and controlled by these
[1:19:44] things remember we spoke about when
[1:19:50] these things are upper region and you by
[1:19:52] the spirit not by repetition not by I
[1:19:58] know I have to behave myself so I'm on
[1:20:00] believers abusing myself or when with
[1:20:03] your cousin and aunt or your sister you
[1:20:04] carry on like if nobody the wrong
[1:20:07] sometimes people you behave today I
[1:20:09] believe seems like what that but when
[1:20:11] you're among the pigs and so on you show
[1:20:14] your colors and the mud you know you're
[1:20:16] in the mud like everybody else proven
[1:20:18] that these things not really in is the
[1:20:20] pig nature with a boat I enjoy
[1:20:25] well-behaved because of environment not
[1:20:29] because of Nietzsche when you hit the
[1:20:32] pig run on your head mud run yeah go you
[1:20:37] could see where your watch good will
[1:20:39] your water
[1:20:39] yeah yeah how much church friends
[1:20:41] because you have the worldly friends you
[1:20:43] have been natural friends because it's a
[1:20:45] setup beating them but once they enter
[1:20:47] chip on your bowtie and you get polish
[1:20:49] Dominus put some spray and you smelling
[1:20:51] good and so on like that
[1:20:53] and you put in your best foot forward
[1:20:54] god bless you oh yeah see they put their
[1:20:56] best foot forward we're not talking
[1:20:57] about that these things have to be
[1:20:59] operated in you by the spirit all right
[1:21:03] no less quality but you know he said the
[1:21:05] whole statue of your pian is governed
[1:21:08] and controlled by these things but it
[1:21:10] cannot be completely controlled till
[1:21:12] it's completely possess these qualities
[1:21:16] so we talking about not so much how much
[1:21:19] Holy Ghost you have but how much Holy
[1:21:21] Ghost have you where you're no surrender
[1:21:24] that's that's the Abidin you are abiding
[1:21:27] me in' and i by and by the you know
[1:21:28] param went in deeper now he's here team
[1:21:32] is the strongest of this weakest link so
[1:21:34] it's no strongest weakest thing no
[1:21:36] matter how much drawn these are built up
[1:21:37] this is built up its got if there is a
[1:21:39] weak link
[1:21:40] the 8 bricks nobody Bonham was referring
[1:21:42] to the chalkboard join which is that
[1:21:43] perfect man join if you possess you say
[1:21:45] you got this distance and don't have
[1:21:47] districts so you don't have patience at
[1:21:53] Greeks you have somebody rest but it
[1:21:56] bricks if you have got temperance
[1:21:57] control you're flying loose anything a
[1:22:00] your blood dais skin you running that
[1:22:03] blood transfusion you need a whole blood
[1:22:05] you blood little off on your skin there
[1:22:07] so somebody else I'm the Earl I mean so
[1:22:11] for me you saw some young you a small
[1:22:18] people know you're a big pit bull and
[1:22:20] any husband again bro so he said watch
[1:22:25] now if you possess this and this and
[1:22:27] this on doing out this it bricks if
[1:22:28] you've got this and I've got this you
[1:22:30] brick right here now you've got this
[1:22:32] haven't got this every brick now watch
[1:22:34] no hairy part want to get to now when
[1:22:36] you surrender your complete pian here we
[1:22:39] go
[1:22:39] then the holy spirit just push through
[1:22:42] you in these virtues so it's not very
[1:22:45] fluent in you know because the
[1:22:47] Pentecostal that's why when burns are a
[1:22:49] vision of the man speaking in tongues
[1:22:51] and then seem living with somebody else
[1:22:52] and so on they were being used by the
[1:22:55] Spirit of God but the lights was
[1:22:57] contrary
[1:22:57] so God decide to do something different
[1:23:00] he put the wooden men and used the
[1:23:02] wooden man so now we're looking at this
[1:23:04] know these virtues as a vehicle as a
[1:23:09] channel of God that God using this
[1:23:12] vehicle in you so then you becomes a
[1:23:15] channel of God not you in yourself but
[1:23:17] true these virtues in you the virtues
[1:23:20] become the conductor we are say the word
[1:23:22] as a conductor but the word and sprit is
[1:23:23] one so quote put the word and you the
[1:23:25] secret is what the word is in the pride
[1:23:27] now the word really is that so now was
[1:23:32] that what you have inside of you see by
[1:23:34] Molina the Bible is a Soria this
[1:23:38] physical Bible and the Perman so to get
[1:23:41] the primitive you the preaching of the
[1:23:42] word come to you so God put the word
[1:23:44] gospel spirit spoken word to come into
[1:23:46] you and God drop the word into your
[1:23:49] heart then you have the word in your
[1:23:51] heart that word in hack is also the
[1:23:52] pyramid in your heart
[1:23:53] so you already have the pyramid in
[1:23:55] mechanic's form which is the kingdom he
[1:23:59] said the kingdom is within you which is
[1:24:01] the word but the word of the telling the
[1:24:03] power to be the kingdom in you then
[1:24:05] there's a manifestation inside of you
[1:24:07] would mean flesh we attend the spirit
[1:24:10] taint the spirit and power so faith is
[1:24:13] in you see then God did not fare over
[1:24:16] the spirit then he spirit free things
[1:24:18] out of you hurt you inside of you see
[1:24:20] got in that fight with you over spirit
[1:24:23] your food your power knowledge and you
[1:24:25] see the spirit knowledge spirit all
[1:24:27] these things aspirational knowledge
[1:24:32] share that information you know is the
[1:24:33] knowledge of God by spirit temperance
[1:24:37] patience godliness and from temperance
[1:24:39] faith virtue knowledge what God give you
[1:24:41] temperance is where you are the diode
[1:24:44] that were to see when they did their own
[1:24:46] temperance where you have to tie out and
[1:24:49] exercise temperance control over the
[1:24:52] tongue and he first troubled people that
[1:24:55] tongue is trouble you know that from the
[1:24:57] doctor put a plane in trouble he's a
[1:24:59] master perfect man he can brighter his
[1:25:03] tongue see any wrong thing saying what
[1:25:08] we shouldn't say talking all the time
[1:25:10] and have a problem keeping silent have a
[1:25:15] boo
[1:25:15] listening that you can learn and some
[1:25:18] people not willing to learn so they're
[1:25:20] not willing to listen when its begin to
[1:25:21] listen when you certain listen is when
[1:25:23] you begin to learn I ain't talking oh
[1:25:25] yeah I hear ya
[1:25:28] let's give me put some comfort that you
[1:25:30] hear hear oh yeah yeah you know they say
[1:25:37] you know if we give them to them talk so
[1:25:44] for them to not to know you're suddenly
[1:25:46] hostile you see here because if they
[1:25:50] said not till my tongue like a rude
[1:25:52] see I Here I am I know nothing ball in
[1:25:56] overtalk emotional I know you know
[1:25:59] exactly why talking about some all you
[1:26:00] could see invented that what is any
[1:26:02] members
[1:26:05] when you're listening you're not hearing
[1:26:07] you're listening you want to know
[1:26:10] because sometimes a person can be seen
[1:26:11] something I did not seen it correctly
[1:26:13] you're not seeing it right did not bring
[1:26:15] any right words across the not have any
[1:26:16] right way to presented but you want to
[1:26:18] know what you really want to see I know
[1:26:20] you're seeing something what you want to
[1:26:21] see because you want to catch and
[1:26:23] listening hearing is when you understand
[1:26:25] you really see it that's my husband and
[1:26:28] wife are some of the issues sometimes
[1:26:28] wife seen son - she likes talking in
[1:26:30] tongues got a husband not hearing at all
[1:26:33] uni I hear you share the key got here
[1:26:38] the game to petition of those tones so
[1:26:40] I'm gonna be husband talk and me why 50
[1:26:42] gentle she not here in English yeah here
[1:26:45] she's not listening because about
[1:26:47] changes yesterday and she want to know
[1:26:50] why she behaving so when he said that
[1:26:52] yesterday but she didn't here like
[1:26:54] yesterday she was ready born here yeah
[1:26:55] she wasn't listening so instead of all
[1:26:58] these interpersonal tungsten wine talk
[1:27:01] I'm communicating well and why not
[1:27:04] listen well why not ask am I getting you
[1:27:07] I remember some time my wife will be Pat
[1:27:12] for marriage that was good she wanted to
[1:27:18] know how she coming across she wasn't
[1:27:20] taking what she's in for granted because
[1:27:22] sometimes husband neither interpretation
[1:27:25] because he busy busy year I was another
[1:27:29] sign talking from from reality from
[1:27:33] experience but afterwards I learned to
[1:27:36] busy on this so I could tell you that
[1:27:39] you need to listen some people here in
[1:27:41] Leawood and eyeballing me many memories
[1:27:49] a fall asleep in church already become
[1:27:50] hallelujah his first reaction when you
[1:27:54] wake up engine but if you are talking
[1:27:55] about the parents
[1:27:57] hallelujah he when he wakes up water his
[1:28:03] sleep with a hallelujah he hear nothing
[1:28:05] they look confirmation and nothing you
[1:28:07] can give the drunk man a gospel in he
[1:28:09] drunk he can hear it which over the
[1:28:12] enemies over so when you come you can be
[1:28:15] I'll be sober here distinctly and
[1:28:19] clearly that it could be clarified to
[1:28:21] you division can be care to you oh this
[1:28:24] is not about church this is about you as
[1:28:26] an individual commented that perfection
[1:28:28] let me speak a wrap up here no wow oh my
[1:28:33] so then you surrender your complete pian
[1:28:35] then the Holy Spirit just pours through
[1:28:38] you in these virtues then you are living
[1:28:40] tabernacle then people look and say
[1:28:42] that's a man full of virtue knowledge he
[1:28:45] believes the word temperance patience
[1:28:48] godliness brotherly kindness full of the
[1:28:51] Holy Ghost he is walking around what is
[1:28:53] it the stature that unbelievers can look
[1:28:56] and say there is a Christian that is a
[1:29:00] man or woman who knows what they're
[1:29:02] talking about
[1:29:03] you never see a kinda sweeter godly a
[1:29:07] person nice big words kinda that would
[1:29:13] have it a night way sweeter sweet ah
[1:29:18] sweet my godly a person you are sealed a
[1:29:24] scene shows on both sides whether you're
[1:29:27] going or coming
[1:29:28] you seem just the same there you are
[1:29:30] when a man a woman possesses this then
[1:29:33] the capstone comes down and seals them
[1:29:37] into the kingdom which is the Holy Ghost
[1:29:39] and that makes this a complete being a
[1:29:42] tabernacle of the Living God a walking
[1:29:45] living example of Christianity their
[1:29:48] life is dead hidden Christ to God seal
[1:29:52] there by the Holy Ghost
[1:29:53] you reckon and self dead you were born
[1:29:55] of faith and virtue and all these things
[1:29:57] is added to you till you are perfect
[1:29:59] limits image of God he said isn't that
[1:30:02] wonderful
[1:30:03] and God true that has brought seventy
[1:30:06] ages to show the seven steps and he
[1:30:08] brought building his individual into his
[1:30:10] image he built a complete Church in His
[1:30:12] image and at the resurrection this
[1:30:14] complete body will be raised up to live
[1:30:16] with him forever because it is the bride
[1:30:18] so he cuts it in every age every age
[1:30:21] that is to come Oh
[1:30:22] glory to God so to be persistent is
[1:30:26] make a goal and to put something over to
[1:30:28] try to do something you have to be
[1:30:29] persistent when you are persistent no
[1:30:32] all Christians here we go almost in
[1:30:34] oceans now all Christians must be
[1:30:37] persistent I want to see that to me all
[1:30:40] Christians must be persistent aha
[1:30:45] so that means it cannot be set down and
[1:30:47] Gordo will get out you know go go bless
[1:30:49] me God will help me you know trust me no
[1:30:51] no no all questions must be persistent
[1:30:54] that mean all Christians inaudible
[1:30:59] because you have to persist or something
[1:31:01] you have to vent or something to
[1:31:03] be persistent you have to have a target
[1:31:05] that way Paul said forgetting these in
[1:31:07] the past because you can't go back
[1:31:08] running forward at the same time you
[1:31:10] can't drive in a rearview mirror you'll
[1:31:12] get an accident you have to cut off at
[1:31:14] what is behind you fail you fall you'll
[1:31:18] slip your best behavior whatever it is
[1:31:20] that's the past
[1:31:21] where you going on where you hadn't
[1:31:24] known because once you have any right
[1:31:26] direction you could move on all
[1:31:31] Christian must be persistent
[1:31:32] there must be Verint and the only
[1:31:35] way to do this is the first have faith
[1:31:36] in what you are trying
[1:32:21] okay we have something here see
[1:32:24] no don't what perseverance everything is
[1:32:29] on now
[1:32:30] praise the Lord amen so watch and if you
[1:32:34] have no faith you're jumping at it you
[1:32:37] can't not be Verret but when you
[1:32:39] already know it's the truth
[1:32:40] there is nothing to stop you from ready
[1:32:42] people severan man of all ages that ever
[1:32:45] be able to do anything had faith in what
[1:32:48] they were trying to do more perseverant
[1:32:51] Moses was brilliant okay I'll gonna skip
[1:32:54] to quickly Crooked Stick was good enough
[1:32:56] he had me in the presence of God before
[1:32:58] he ran no presence stick position we're
[1:33:03] going Moses to Egypt to do what to take
[1:33:05] over a man with a stick Oh glory to God
[1:33:09] no matter how many treatment Egypt had
[1:33:12] it didn't mean nothing to Moses he had
[1:33:15] been in the presence of God and he was
[1:33:16] Lucy there and he was going on to take
[1:33:18] over again shields and trained man by
[1:33:20] tens of thousands nothing was going to
[1:33:22] stop him because he heard the voice of
[1:33:23] God he said check it out must be a
[1:33:25] scripture voice oh praise God and that's
[1:33:28] the reason he said with Sampson and
[1:33:30] that's the reason wasn't the Apostles
[1:33:32] Jesus chose to Jesus chose them
[1:33:34] practically every one of them without
[1:33:36] even enough education to sign their name
[1:33:39] what's the choice so he's not reading
[1:33:43] writing arithmetic
[1:33:44] it wasn't he educated punch and his
[1:33:47] disciples have degrees it wasn't that
[1:33:49] listen not one of them with education to
[1:33:52] sign a name he didn't choose freeze
[1:33:54] Bible study people he didn't choose to
[1:33:57] you know jumps between fishermen and
[1:33:59] herdsmen
[1:34:01] so he could take that in his hand take
[1:34:03] nothing and make something out of it now
[1:34:07] that this is Nietzsche he doesn't take
[1:34:10] train schools choose colors he takes
[1:34:12] something that realizes it is nothing
[1:34:14] and he gets him to it and make something
[1:34:16] out of it
[1:34:17] Oh glory to God hallelujah
[1:34:20] Samson music Tom please when they spray
[1:34:26] the Lord come upon him if he had nothing
[1:34:28] when
[1:34:30] the Sperry came upon him he feared
[1:34:32] nothing why he was persistent as long as
[1:34:35] he could feel the NASA I Bollywood
[1:34:37] forward him
[1:34:39] so when Sampson put back his head and
[1:34:41] feel the 7 lakhs he know nothing could
[1:34:46] stop him he beaten lion he bees in a
[1:34:49] thousand men with helmets on them he's
[1:34:52] taken away kids and I'm walking through
[1:34:54] gates why was upon him you say how much
[1:34:59] or the church didn't come around how
[1:35:03] much the church tonight that claims to
[1:35:05] be born of the Spirit of God stand in
[1:35:06] the meeting and see this vindication of
[1:35:08] the resurrected Jesus Christ and claim
[1:35:10] to be filled with the Holy Ghost and cut
[1:35:12] sit still and let's sit and push you
[1:35:14] along like he does hallelujah be
[1:35:16] persistent press stay with it
[1:35:19] whoo glory to God and today we claim to
[1:35:21] have the Holy Ghost and cowardly with it
[1:35:23] and free to move out we have got to be
[1:35:25] persistent if we got the genuine Holy
[1:35:26] Spirit we will be persistent about the
[1:35:30] clothes as a mission come up the whole
[1:35:31] arm of God is supernatural
[1:35:33] what is the arm of God love what is love
[1:35:34] you say love your love and so on it's
[1:35:37] supernatural
[1:35:38] Gordon supernatural you cannot sound a
[1:35:40] physically proved God no feat finds a
[1:35:42] source that others don't see so when you
[1:35:46] need faith finds a source that others
[1:35:50] don't see and that's the reason all this
[1:35:53] this is beautiful this is beautiful
[1:35:55] nothing else can do it nothing else he
[1:35:57] said no you said you have to see
[1:35:59] something otherwise scientific what you
[1:36:01] cannot do it is hid from you
[1:36:02] so forget about everything else when God
[1:36:04] has anything is really hidden and that's
[1:36:07] the reason that you are so hidden if you
[1:36:09] are Christian for you are dead and your
[1:36:12] life is hidden God - Jesus Christ
[1:36:14] see by the Holy Ghost how's it ever
[1:36:15] gonna find you he can't do it God have
[1:36:18] you hidden God hates you what a hiding
[1:36:22] place in the bosom of Jesus Christ no
[1:36:25] fear Oh glory to God hallelujah so this
[1:36:29] woman came to Jesus my daughter is
[1:36:30] texture than ever hallelujah praise God
[1:36:33] she worship he says it's not fit to take
[1:36:35] the transparent cast as a dog and she
[1:36:37] stood there she said you're not of my
[1:36:38] race your skin different you have a
[1:36:41] different race she called her she was
[1:36:42] called a dog

[1:36:45] with all her friends disappointed with
[1:36:47] her people all kind of things trying to
[1:36:48] hinder her but everything was trolling
[1:36:50] away that shows Satan trying to push
[1:36:52] back genuine faith but he can't do it
[1:36:55] don't care what anybody else says she
[1:36:57] was persistent she kept moving on
[1:37:00] she said truth Lord see it will always
[1:37:02] admit that the world is right regardless
[1:37:04] of what your situation is once the word
[1:37:06] speak to you she would admit that the
