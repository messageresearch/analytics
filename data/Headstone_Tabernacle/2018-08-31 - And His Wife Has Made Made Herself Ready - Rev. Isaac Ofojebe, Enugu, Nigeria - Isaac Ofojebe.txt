bless the vision of your word in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen I'd like to invite your attention to a few questions the Bible is a Matthew 25 and st. Luke 15 and Revelation chapter 19 salùte 25 is a very familiar scripture for this one they said that Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took the lamps a wet foot to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish dead at the wise took their lamps and took no oil with them but wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps why the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered a slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out but a wise answer saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves now why didn't went to buy the bridegroom came and they that we have ready but that's what they're there that we are ready went in with him to the marriage and it door was shut after what came also the other virgins saying Lord Lord open to us but it after I said verily I said to you I know you're not watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the sort of man commits sin Luke 15 thus if that what women have established of silver if you lose what is not on light a candle and sweep the house are sick deposit Leticia find it a when she had found it she call it a net for friends and her neighbors together saying rejoice with me for I found a piece which I had lost provision maintained verse seven let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of and love is come and his wife had made herself ready after I was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of sense and he said unto me write blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and it said unto me these are the truths say these are the true sayings of God and I fell at his feet to worship Him and he said unto me see that do it not I am thy fellow-servant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy what I would thank you for the reading of your ward we ask that you bless the preaching of it and hear about faith in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen god bless you you may be seated [Music] god bless you richly I've been having me a good child service of the service amen I believe the Lord has blessed us above measure in this convention and we can all testify to that amen so I'm not coming to bring a different message because our message is one message no matter what scripture you come from no matter where you pick it from our message is one message amen because were saying what a prophet says hallelujah amen so my title is and his wife had made herself ready and his wife Admiral chef ready and so watch my scriptures and Matthew chapter 25 and say Luke 15 and Robuchon my team is all about the bride it's all about you amen so it's all about what the Lord is doing for us today it's all about our is all about our division why we are here the very reason why God sent us a profit in this age hallelujah Amen to get a bride ready for the bridegroom praise be to God Amen hallelujah bless happy is one of her name so we know that in got no fear and God gave his first is a son in the wife but if I could come to Hashem fairer by taking reasoning instead of the world now sit on the Sabbats coming to the came into the garden and then was to suggest something to Eve because you never not have the word and they come in the walk he can only suggest amen and then it began to reason those words and began to do exactly what God told him not to do because God said that's risen that's what don't jump out we got word living the way it is because it did you push it that very day only died and God don't play with any of his words when God speak God made everyone he spoke how did we are praise be to God said that don't have the world he doesn't even have access to the world he's only trying to suggest and it suggested to Eve mmm and if considered what the enemy what is suffered was seen and then the devil planted a seed in there praise the Lord hallelujah and man fell because of that amen see and then God happened on the bride I shall fell again but there's a brightness coming on the policy and that right can never be like this that Branca never fell raise God so I believe you know we are coming from this afternoon hallelujah other contest scripture is a Luke chapter 17 verse 12 to 19 and there

there met him ten men that were lepers you know lepers Seema's rejected isolated which stood afar off they couldn't get close to the afar off and then fast at him and then lift up their voices and like that they were in gentle about it they spoke what was in their hearts they lifted up their voices and said Jesus master have mercy on us hallelujah have mercy on us praise the Lord you got to

place to him praise the Lord there was a student one time in a football game and some football lover was watching us question is as a surprised favorite team collected tree goes from the opponent and it was so discouraged until he gave up hope of their possible recovery from such deficit but he noticed that the players were not bothered about their three goals they have collected they kept playing the game anyhow and they kept giving it their very best glory they were plain as if nothing happened if everything was fine they never looked at what opponent has already collected given to them they were still play they kept playing the game as if nothing has happened the mud was washing on as they pulled one back and then they came back and put back the second one and then the finally they propagated good and they went ahead to score the winning goal [Applause] and I've got a match the man came today to one of the players and said what actually happened when you call it that three goes I thought to be have been discouraged and you have been confused but you kept play like as if not it happened and the man said yes whether it goes down but much wasn't over yet the game is not over yet so we complain because it literally has no bloody sign and whistle and I said a problem with many is that the blood of whistle the final whistle before LFL applauses for whistle and I give up and I surrender and then the opponent wins hallelujah is about a cap that came their best even though they went down but they never failed now they never stayed down and I have good news for you today
