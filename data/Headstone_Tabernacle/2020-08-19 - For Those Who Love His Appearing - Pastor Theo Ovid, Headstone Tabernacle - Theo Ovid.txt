1-8 the script you want to read isaiah chapter 60 read in verse 1 arise shine for thy light is come and the glory of the lord have risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee psalms 62 reading verse 1. truly my soul waited upon god from him commit my salvation he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be greatly moved how long will he imagine mischief against a man he shall be slain all of you as a bowen wall shall he be was a tottering fence the only consult to cast him down from his excellency they delight in lies they blessed with their mouth but they curse inwardly silla my soul weighed down only upon god for my expectation is from him he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be moved and god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god trust him trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before him god is a refuge for us sylla our last scripture from second timothy chapter four honorary verse one i charge ddfor before god this is timothy uh this is paul speaking to timothy and the lord jesus christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long suffering and doctrine for the time will come when that time is here now when they will not end your song doctrine but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned into fables but watch down in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy ministry for i am now ready to be offered and the time of my departures at hand i afford a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith henceforth there is leader for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day not only me not not to me only but unto them also that love his appearing may god bless his word you may be seated praise the name of the lord okay our title tonight and the title is for those who love his appearance that's the title tonight for those who love his appearance praise the lord i have an inspiration don't be wary the word manifested is the light of the hour oh praise the name of the lord and i want to share this with you tonight and uh god is my revelation my rock and the prophet shalom you're saying if you notice in the scripture the psalms it kept saying god is my rock do you know what a rock represent in the bible a rock in the bible represent the revelation of god god is my revelation the revelation of the word is the rock isn't that right goddess or rock and girls are a rock when god has been revealed to us that becomes a rock and we find out that god uh jesus told peter upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not reveal against it so not some man is iraq or the people is a rock or some headquarters in iraq god is the rock isn't that right and you say we are facing here uh arise and shine for the glory of god has come upon you the light is here and the very next verse he said gross darkness upon the people and when we are in a mixture of light and darkness and then my address to the church is shalom peace he said we are facing both darkness and light the world is in one of the most chaotic times of darkness that it ever stood in and yet it is standing and again the most blessed light that they ever shine in the difference is just like in the beginning and when there was gross darkness and upon the earth and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the water and god said let there be light and god separated the light from the darkness and i believe we are living in that hour again when god is separating light from darkness and he is pressing it to the other side of the world that the light might be made manifest oh glory to god and the reason i say shalom to them is because it is god's peace hallelujah we are looking forward to a break-in of a new day are you tonight or are you frustrated and fed up and you're amen you're tired you can't take it no more but we are looking forward hallelujah for a new day until there is something great laying ahead of us where the years has been the joy that we have looked forward to the pressing the coming of the great light oh glory to god my expectation is for that light not depressed that light hallelujah that power that presence isn't that something oh glory to god hallelujah now now we can see it breaking over the horizon the horizontal realm it is breaking between mortal and immortality we see it breaking between the heaven and the earth from earthbound sickness and trouble world onto a bright shining day of an immortal life an immortal body and immortal earth that shall never pass away oh glory it is shalom unto the church it's light coming to the believers but cross that is upon the people oh glory to god the people gonna be confused the people will be in frustration and fed up and they can't take it no more but light is promised to come upon you oh glory to god it will be seen upon you oh glory to god so don't be wary tonight no we find all the moon in this in the heavens is to reflect the light of the sun in the absence of the sun it's to give light around us it's not right it reflects it's not a perfect light because it's reflecting and the sun shine against the moon and the moon reflects its light in the absence of the sun but when the sun come up then the moon is not needed anymore and today the church is reflecting the light of the absent sun oh she says the church supposed to be reflecting the light isn't that right the church is the reflection of the light because he said a little while the will see it me no more but you want to see me and i'll be with you even in you to the end of the age and the works that i do hallelujah lights that he made manifest and no light you can't get no life except for light isn't that right and there is no light except through the word of god oh glory to god now the sun is the word of god in the beginning god said let there be light here we go and when the ma and when the manifested word of god when the word of god was manifested there was light but first god spoke it so when god said let there be light nothing move that was just spoken word you could write that down but when that light was manifested hallelujah praise god that was the light so when the word of god was manifested there was light first god spoke it what if he didn't what if it didn't manifest that it wasn't like yet but when he spoke it then it manifested vindicated his world was a vindicated light coming to existence so gross darkness blinding of israel was the lightning of the gentiles now the blind of the gentiles is the lighten up of israel oh glory to god forgot the light of israel gentle blindness and darkness of distract the gentiles do you believe that hallelujah and here we go now watch and the moon passing the way it did on the reflection of the darkness of the world blind and all this light is a reflection to us that the gentile church age is finished the church here we go is making the self ready he's been making herself ready for our time it's time for the rapture for darkness is fading upon the gentiles and the dawn will soon break upon the jews oh praise the name of the lord you love him tonight good people caught up in this thing good people sincere people like mary and joseph very sincere they went to the feast and jesus they were presuming he was with them but he wasn't good people today thinking the same thing they are organized in these churches and organization they think they're doing a good thing they are presuming he is with them when they are not see many people think he's with them they shook hands with the preacher put their name on the book but he wasn't oh glory to god they're good people mary and joseph good people but the facts was he wasn't there and here the bomb don't presume anything oh glory to god don't presume nothing that's what i said sunday i don't think i'm entitled to anything i'm only entitled to fight oh glory to god he tells joshua every place you put your foot is yours i am not here to take anything for granted church for granted people for granted amen believe us for granted praise god i have to stand here and preach to empty pews oh glory to god we're going to preach anyhow because there's an audience all day they'll have a heir to hear or what the spirit is saying oh glory to god as long as the spirit is speaking we want to be channels of communications for inspiration to flow right through oh hallelujah good people but the facts was he wasn't there with them don't resume anything oh glory to god what is like question the vindicated spoken word of god outside of that there is no light nothing what he says not spoken word vindicated spoken word outside of that there's no light you can't lighten the earth with flashlights it take god word made manifest they were good people notice the accuracy of the word now what about the light he said gross darkness would come upon the people and there would be light rise and shine for light just come how can there be darkness and light it's got to be separated and the only thing that separates it it's the word manifested separates so all this talk talk everybody talking everybody preaching everybody explaining and teaching right but there comes an hour when the world will be manifested and now go separate light from darkness because the word manifested oh give the lord a shout the word manifested is light hallelujah oh glory to god do you believe that the only one thing separates it the word manifested separates it presses it to the other side here there's darkness on the earth but when the manifested world the sun which was spoken in existence by the world shows itself darkness run to the other side another world has taken place now darkness separates itself from the light now to the elected church in the circle to the elected church in this dark hour in this corner of the vineyard in this while they press in every country every nation they're nothing against the bride and the pestilence come and take the whole will to try every man on the earth hallelujah with the attitude where they behave everything else and to see what your faith will do to see what you will anoint if you've got any frustration depression upset you can't make it weary tired fed up if you're annoying that oh and on these promises that this very hour we have a promise to rise and shine and produce a dynamic seven thunder revival that's our promise oh glory to god to see the adoption of sons see sons manifested she confinicated to see so god proud he said this is my beloved son i'm pleased to be identified with him i'm pleased to confirm him with my son i please give him to sign the check oh give the lord a shout hallelujah praise god praise god i say to the church shalom god's peace good morning how do you do it's a break in their church it's darkness upon the people but it's good morning to the church christ is appearing among us shalom peace shalom hallelujah so when we see darkness settling darkness does come when just before day just before the day break there's a darkness that's come and then in that mr doctors have a morning star that has arise and that morning start reflecting that the sun coming so the morning is the same that the sun is coming when you will see the morningstar hallelujah and to him that overcome it shall i give that morning star there's a morning start to arise hallelujah to reflect that the sun is coming oh this is beautiful tonight we know that the morning star is hanging under to introduce the coming sun and when the monastery shines it's going between it's always darkness just a few minutes before day the blackout comes the moon failed to sign the tackle before there is because the light is present in the darkness oh glory to all them virus no the sons of god going to come forward they want to stop sickness they're gonna stop diseases they're gonna stop cancer they're gonna stop them things in this track oh glory to god hell is a big battle going on you know oh hallelujah praise be to jesus he said but that's him among us his word being identified the great days fixing to break when the morning breaks eternal bright and fear when his chosen one shall gather to the home beyond the sky when the role is called up yonder i'll be there our names are on his book shalom good morning peace be unto you the darkness is separating some from the light god is causing it the light is doing it the light is pressing itself in such a way until the darkness have to congregate together they had a chance to accept it they wouldn't do it but isaiah 61 said i rise and shine for thy light has come that same light has come to what to manifest to make known to the people the promises he made for this day hallelujah glory to god when jesus come when he came he was the light of that day they were supposed to become a messiah he came just exactly like god said he was the light of the day he was the vindicated word that was spoken made manifest he was what the vindicated word that was spoken mean manifest oh glory to god for 50 plus years we speak in vindicated word from a 20th century prophet the word already vindicated because he was vindicated hallelujah we were echoing a vindicated word now the same vindicated word had to become manifest oh give the lord a shout what manifest the vindicated word that was promised so what jesus said he was the light of the world the bible said he is the word and the manifested or the vindicated scripture is the light the manifested or the vindicated scripture is the light then he gonna say normal life can come outside of light light produces life there can be no life outside of light so the seas was laying in darkness in genesis but then when god said let there be light that produced life in the seed to comfort after it's kind the life couldn't comfort except the light comes oh glory to god so you need light to produce life are you with me now so there is no life outside of light natural or spiritual there must be and the only light can come by the word of god and god's word is light when it is manifested oh give the lord a shout wherever you are god's word is light when it is manifested it is just a seedling in here as god planted all the seeds oh glory to god god said in this dark gloomy dismal mercy world that stood here without light he said let there be light and it wasn't light until that world was manifested then it was light the gospel doesn't mean the past tracks that is fine the gospel is not going about teaching the bible that isn't the gospel it is written in the scriptures that the gospel didn't come true word only but through the power and demonstration of the holy spirit the gospel that is the word but the letter kill it but the spirit gave it life noah seed laying here on the pulpit it's just a seed until it dies and become dramatized it will never do anything so to see the word has to be manifest in order to be the gospel that is why you hear me over the years say i'm longing i'm waiting for the hour when i'm going to preach the gospel that is why i've been saying that because what we have a seed oh glory to god but this word manifest is the gospel oh give the lord a shout feel good tonight in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god now depending upon the expression of thought now the word is the gospel is seed form oh let me just back up a little bit watch so god in the beginning give the thought of what it would be spoke the word of it to be we receive the word and it produces what god thought it was the word is the gospel in seed form so you say brother branham in our country you have acorn trees you would say would you give me a country i give you a acorn you have a country potentially but it is in seed form you can't say you absolutely got a tree until the seed produced the tree so regardless of what people claim that's just mo talking until it produced well preaching the word is the acorn but making it live is the gospel he promised the holy spirit that's the word and receiving the holy spirit will make it live and that is why he said no it pretends if these men if if they pick this up and go out they can make more sense to it to bring it to a place you would i just want to lay the seed and then i hope they make it come to life in other words he talked about men coming after him to make more sense to it not only to make more sense he said i hope they make it come to life hallelujah praise god let's continue the very next line is proof hallelujah that teaching the word wouldn't do it it said these signs shall follow them that believe you believe seven seals seven thunder seven mysteries seven what whatever steps you believe these signs shall follow them that believe these signs following you you have to be a little harder because this is the word here these signs shall follow them that believe that's a pentecostal there's a lie like the scriptures life of pentecost that's the word now who said that jesus said that now no man said that there's no explanation jesus said that these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils evil spirits speak with new tongues take up serpents drink their bleedings it wouldn't harm them lions and the sick they shall recover oh glory to god and i believe we are living in a day when the holy spirit is moving upon the heart of people regardless of how much criticism how much fanaticism god is on the obligation to take that church out of the gentiles i'm convinced there's going to be a unity of the faith not unity of the message of the fate not once delivered to the saints oh glory to god hallelujah and the only way as god was jesus was the manifestation of god's spoken word the light of the hour am i so you walk in that light you baptist this is the light of the hour the light has come rise and shine the word light the manifested word of god identified is light oh glory to god so william branham that was the word made manifest of malachi 4. oh glory to god malachi 4 prophesied for hundreds of years it was as lenient as a text but when william step out and connect with malachi for scripture then that word of malachi 4 became flesh he elijah shall forerun the second coming of the messiah all glory to god he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers oh glory to god hallelujah glory to god to all this world being scattered up all this loose has been tied up what's the layer platform of the conductor of the word that the spirit could feel freely oh glory to god there was no contingency of the word hallelujah all the pike was broken up so the spirit couldn't flow it was trapped by queens and dogmas every time the spirits had to do so it bunks are creed here it can't go it burns out interpretation here it can't go it bonks some man with some contrary life here it can't go but god promised in the last days that all the world will be tied up oh and tied back in the world to bring down the holy ghost and the entire holy ghost visited the church oh glory to god to make manifest luke's emptiness these son of man again come with the original seed to put it in a bride i'm excited tonight because this word gonna come to pass this word can return void oh hallelujah oh glory thank you lord jesus hallelujah don't worry a charge up here oh glory to god hallelujah thank you lord jesus i'm not turning on you page let's turn to the word see what the word promises for today see what the light of the day is supposed to be what we ought to do this year not go back to chris go back to our old nominations not go back to all denominations but turn to the world to see what kind of light supposed to shine today oh church turn to the word get back to the world flip the right switch which punching around electric lights and artificial man-made lights turn to this world and see the promise of today and then see the promise what the promise is and what's for his identification when it's vindicated you know whether in the light or not when it's what vindicated nobody explained i have to explain you're looking for the vindication oh glory to god to me i want to see what is promised for this day i want to know what the light of the hour is so i can know how to walk in it and i want to know where i am living what asia means and how far up the road i am oh my just exactly he showed us the seventh ages what would come and the revelation of it he sent seven angels to reveal the seven messengers that had been done to dear he showed the loose ends each angel coming each day and revealing the loose ends that luther left that wesley left the pentecostal left is all represented in there and the very type and shadow of the great shalom jehovah yahweh throw it in the skies shalom peace don't be wary jesus is here his great light has come to us and we are thankful for it yes his word the great mystery here he is today manifesting himself doing the same thing it did just the same thing doing the same thing we are creators of time he's the god of eternity we try to press ourselves we try to make something different this has got to be done remember he knows all about it it is going to happen anyhow let him do it just commit our yourself to him the world comes to churches they will tighten up there will be a press that's going to happen but there's a brighter manifest power that's going to happen too all these things happen los angeles that's going to happen too we can't change that that arrow of god's judgment already been loose from the bow and god not pulling it back it's already loose it's flying on his way to los angeles hallelujah the vials on his way to be poured out all glory god plays and pestilence and woes all that nobody could stop that but they cannot stop the sons of god coming forth when the whole creation is grown in for the manifestation of the sons of god when born sons feel some speak and their word is created just like that oh hallelujah remember he knows all about it let him do it just commit yourself to him look up and shine with the joy of the lord to know that you have been privileged your eyes your eyes have come to see this day trust him for your future i want to say that again trust him for your future there was so much uncertainty and he could stress you out and fear a hallelujah but trust him oh glory to god say the lord you are my rock hallelujah you have become my salvation my song my shield my buckler my stay in him will i trust trust the lord at all times oh glory to god giving praise tonight give him praise right where you are right now raise up your hands wherever you are and give god some praises trust him for the future you have seen him vindicate his word in this past he that vindicated his word in this past made all these things happen exactly to the hour we are living in to the seven angels message both shoulders and heaven and earth made it known three ways so there'll be no slip up he promised the word will be vindicated god promised it with two thousand years of waiting he will arrive on time oh i love that don't be wary he will be there as he vindicated his word in every age the churches shows the same thing and the revealing of our lord by the seventh message and so forth god revealed it manifested it and proved it and it's among us today he showed himself here with us and prove i vindicated this word so will it be oh my hallelujah oh glory to god unless you say so be sure friends don't play with this this is the gospel don't just say well i'll join church hallelujah i'll say any message don't talk that talk any message what is that god recognize that i any message what is that i believe in a prophet what is that did they ever believe and tremble see so it's not that he said don't just say well i believe i joined church there are thousands listen there are thousands of people joining churches that will never be in heaven i think i would say that again there will be thousands of people joining churches that will never be in heaven i preached that some time ago disappointments at the judgment i said the bootlegger and the gambler and the prostitute and so forth they will be surprised they won't be surprised they know what's coming to them but what's going to be a surprise is those fellows who think he's right and not when you see your name is not on the book that's when it's going to be hard when you think you are christian when you are not there's a way that seems right you believe intellectually that you are right you have done things you thought was right you have been good you have been kind that isn't it friends i'm trying to say it to the church today instead of while i'm wrong in justification and laying here on the altar the ought to be consecrated the time of miracles is at hand let me prophesy the time of miracles is at hand the time of healing the time of great things is at hand but where is the church to receive it hallelujah and i know that this brother branham prophesying about his own ministry and stuff and doing things and things like but that is also for the bride because the holy spirit already said i'll ride this trail once more there'll be one more ride oh glory to god i feel good tonight there'll be one more ride hallelujah oh brother a real predominating fate walks right in and takes its place right and if your heart isn't tender before the lord that's beautiful if it isn't something in your heart that just satisfied day and night no matter what goes what comes i am now ready to be offered up paul said hallelujah i fought a good fight i finished the course i have kept the fate and there's a crown of righteousness later to me that the lord the righteous judge will give me that that day not me only but for those who love his appearance did you ever think about that love his appearing oh glory to god you must love his appearance i want to see him oh i want to see him look upon his face i want to see him come among us i want to i want to love his appearance i can't wait to see my pee among us in healing and deliverance and casting out devils in revival i want to see his appearance i come in the church an expectation to his appearance oh glory to god is dead and empty to you anymore till they simply can't have any pleasure here nothing but just winning social christ is all you can get pleasure out of did you know a mocking angel was sent forth to seal with the holy ghost to seal only those who sigh and cry for the abominations done in the city ezekiel 9 did you ever read it i want to ask a question how many of your family many of members of your church tonight if that angel passed by and seen those people so consecrated to god that the lost souls was upon the heart day and night not television not movies not full around an idol on facebook and just wasting time and watching kind of coco pictures and fake news like all but the bible talk about in the last days they shall have itchiness they shall move from the truth they wouldn't enjoy song doctrine the age itching them for anything fables it's fake news fake promises people just write all kinds of internet is fake put pictures together fake hallelujah i got fake preachers fake men fake messages fake and god sent something real i don't want to fake nothing that's why i say the same holy ghost peter had that is the one i want same fire they had as you want to want i want a modern one i want a new one i want to explain in one i want the same one with the same emotions same signs same wonder same unction same inspiration oh glory to god hallelujah it's promised to the church oh blessed be name of the lord hallelujah same thing hallelujah now watch now remember we have already seen and are witnessing the appearing of the lord now remember appearing and coming is two different words to appear and then to come no is the appearance he has already appeared in these last days right here with us in the last few years no it's a sign of his coming or appearing is a sign of his coming that's right he's appearing in his church in the form of the holy spirit showing that it's him because people cannot do these things that you see the holy spirit doing oh glory to god no and and you see the holy spirit doing so that the appearance of the lord now remember in it it spoke in both places appearing and coming so if people are prepared in the wrong way what if soldiers went to the field not trained for the battle but to go there to dance though they would ever be good dancers they got to be trained to fight and what if they went and some kind of had a fear and know how not how to use the gun it would do a little good so i think that the workers in the harvest should be prepared to know how to train the people for the coming of the lord for there is none of us that wants to meet it now i believe here we go that we are living so close to the coming that these great miraculous things that we see appearing is the indication of his soon coming let me say it again he was saying i believe that we are living so close to the coming that these great miraculous things that we see appearing is the indication of his soon coming hallelujah oh glory to god so it was my desire to tell you many things happen that i don't speak but this was too outstanding for me to keep it from the church it must be told and before god who i stand is the truth i know that there is a god i know that jesus is the son of god emmanuel dwelling among his people today in the form of the holy spirit and i know that the coming of the lord is drawing nine when signs and wonders are appearing so we could preach to be blue in the face until the signs and the wonders and the miracles appear he's still coming but when those things begin to appear we know it's a sign of his coming and he said signs and wonders identify you are adult in christ that's a whole big thing by itself so we got just got through seven church ages and learning that we are in the last loud eastern age and the church would be indifferent get cold denominate be organized organization would take it over eat it up but a promise that there would be a little remnant left there would be a church watch scattered abroad everywhere but god would guard it together and erupted into glory a little sanctified group somewhere waiting on the lord oh hallelujah praise god hallelujah you love him tonight and here and when we he was on earth there were some greeks one time who came to say sirs we will see jesus and i believe that is the desire of every man and woman that ever heard of jesus want to see him and if he isn't the same we cannot see him but if he's the same we can see him he told oh he told us something wrong the other while the world won't see me no more but he shall see me even for i the personal pronoun i'll be with you even in you to the end of the age and here we go and then jesus promised to be in his church doing the same things he did then until the age end now he said this is important a little while the world see me no more well then how would we see him we have to see his spirit if you want to see jesus you have to see what his spirit if he's in us and that spirit would have to do the same that he did or it wouldn't be the same spirit so to see him you have to see the same works oh could i shout all you in the house shelter not one hallelujah i am the vine the other branches if the branch is in the vine the branch would be the kind of fruit that the vine produces to it and if that first branch that come out the divine was a pentecostal branch with visions powers healings baptism of the holy spirit great signs and wonders the next branch will have to be the same kind of branch oh glory to god so there's a big difference in the sign of jesus appearing and then jesus coming they are two different words mean two different things the appearing of the lord and the coming of the lord no the appearance of the lord is now when he's appearing in his people his spirit working among them proving it is him with them getting them ready for the rapture there's not no man getting it ready is the holy spirit is the lord himself descended with a shout appeared voice appearing trump is coming but the lord he sent himself oh glory to god he appeared in a prophet and he's going to appear himself in a bride do you believe that for to come the lord to catch away the bride they appearing and they're coming so the lord is now appearing among his people great signs and wonders raising the dead healing the sick doing the very same things that he did that hasn't been done for 2000 years see the church is horned through that and brought up till at the time the headstone is coming to meet the church then it all go together and be raptured this one fell asleep until it watched onto the seven watch the praying of the lord last night i touched it now if you can beat all the way you say lord god i believe exactly what you would say i believe that the appearance of the lord comes listen listen before the coming of the lord so we're talking about jesus coming the lord is coming we've reached preaching to the second coming of the lord and so on but before he comes he has to appear hallelujah isn't that right praise the lord so he said no that's the appearance of the lord before the coming of the lord for it's just two different words altogether no is the appearing as he promised in the last days that he be with us oh my hallelujah so the light that luther has neither the light was given to john wesley john wesley preached signification that luther passed over the light comes as we have need of light god says it and it isn't open up to us because it has hit to our eyes until the day that god is able to reveal it and i wonder he'll be after we leave ye he say i am persuaded glory let me back up that a little bit and the light comes as we have need of light god says it and it isn't open to us because it's hid to our eyes until the day that god is able to reveal it and i am persuaded here we go that there is very very much more that we know nothing about that is right there are seven seals if we just take the complete book of revelation that's seen in the back of the book it isn't even written in the book and them seeds are to be opened during this church age and the seven last mysteries of god will be made known oh glory i like that seven last not 27 last seven last mysteries to be made known are you ready as daniel heard the seven thunders and forbidden john heard the voices and this book was sealed and the back of the book was sealed with seven seals but in the days of these seasons to be open the mystery of god would be finished in other words god would be known to his church not in three people but in one person the mystery of god would be revealed here we go oh god i feel inspired tonight and when that was completely revealed glory to god all the written mysteries all the loose ends completely revealed then the seven mysteries would be open to the church because indeed the church would be living under the inspiration of the holy spirit him moving in and out and showing his signs of being alive and among us living among us and then we are worshiping the living christ what is he saying here that would be the appearing of the lord that's what he said what we see should make a church that would make a revival that people would fly from everywhere and say the seven thunders are not even written are being made manifest all glory to god so then you can't hold back that worship then you're worshiping the living oh you hold back that when christ is among you oh glory to god and you joined the four beasts you're joining 24 elders your joint thousands time thousands saying blessing and honor might and power dominion not sit down like a morse back church member remember sitting on the pew just sitting on the pew it cannot be like that jesus said oh i come and always woman when the true worship was going to worship the father in spirit and truth for seven ages they couldn't do it we have a revelation of the truth oh and then the spirit has come we can correctly worship god oh glory to god he is our god he is my god he's got to be your god god is the object of worship he was lord for this kind of worship worshiped by revelation god is my rocky hallelujah god is my revelation i wonder if this word reading again when it was completely revealed then the seven mysteries would open to the church because india the church would be living under the inspiration of the holy spirit him moving in and out and showing his signs of what what i'll do at 5 00 ministry what what what a little bit preacher man pastor man why are you with him this is number six that paradigm beef and paradigm beef what do i do with him listen again the church will be living under the inspiration of the holy spirit not man not sex not nicoletan not under message popes or bishops the church will be living where under the inspiration of the holy spirit him move it in and out so he could move in tonight we are with five almost five six here oh glory to god because where the truth and treats that god he could move into the night and heal you perform america in your life slam our door open that was formally closed oh glory to god and then we are worshiping the living christ him moving among us hallelujah then here we go again i know it's only repeating ourselves but it's to bring a certain emphasis this two different words the appearance of christ the coming of christ is two different words now christ is apparently different things he said while he's saying this that's why i'm bringing it back and christ is appearing his last days in his church bringing his church together in unity and faith and power in the word altogether that when he returns he would find the same church what the cancun left the caterpillar eaten that the caterpillar the look was eaten and i will restore he'll find back that same church oh glory to god that's why that's why when elohim came down even melchizedek and appeared to abraham i will return today according to the time of life was to bring a special consolation for a man who wait 25 years to tell him are coming to come again oh glory to god are coming appearing to you to come again but how are coming now we're not coming in man form and a community orphanage is dynamic power going to change your bodies oh glory next 28 days all glory to god the transformation will be in effect you'll hold on with that faith for 25 years and i've come to give you a blessed assurance that your time of life oh glory to god hallelujah all the time you had faith only time you had the seed no light was coming to him you identify a time of life next 28 days your time gonna come your egg gonna drop down and syria will conceive a great chance human power could change it back to young again and that was a tight of the bride being changed and transformed after being pregnant with god oh hallelujah with seed in this last day row your seas of abraham there is going to be a translation i'm convinced of it hallelujah oh glory to god thank you jesus we see the evening lights the coming the holy spirit coming in so strong in upon his church till till the ministry of jesus christ is knowing among the people and that's why he said the ministry has reached its perfection when christ is reproduced again in natural let me say that again the ministry has reached its perfection not because of lord of ministry are mysteries a man could preach but when christ is reproduced in the natural hallelujah he said we see even lights coming and the holy spirit coming in so strong upon his people till the ministry of jesus christ is knowing among the people they sat there with fate bringing him down powers and gifts working among them speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues and signs and wonders and miracles what is it christ among his church getting ready to take her oh hallelujah oh glory to god notice this is a big one the end time messenger his job will be to get the scenes ready the bride ready for the break room isn't that right that will be his message how you want to learn abc when you and you can study algebra later when these other seals in the back is open they'll be only revealed to them who do what learn the abcs now watch something bring back the church to the word now what is this messenger of malachi for to do are you ready church believers out there are you ready to hear it what is this messenger of malachi fought to do restore back the original faith and then he he quantified the resurrection faith that they seen jesus after he was raised from the dead seeing him working among them that's his resurrection fate after buddha man i'm gone after sonoma no longer identify himself because the bodies that holding that son of man gone you have to see jesus back among the bride working among them working among us and that he identified that as resurrection faith because not the same fate it had when jesus was walking with them this is jesus racially dead now hallelujah appearing among them saying peace be unto you oh as my father sent me so son are you oh glory to god that's a different kind of faith now that is resurrection faith now oh hallelujah you mean that had to be among the bride before the rapture yes before it's coming yes you mean all is you have to be identified yes so what are you supposed to be written for my lord jesus let me continue here god is in man and he's identifying himself today in his church in the born-again christian god identify himself that he remains god and the outside world will only know god as they see god and you and i that's the only way they will know god is when we are written epistles epistle of the scripture we are rid of all men and the life that we live reflects what's on the inside of us a man is identified by the works that he does so our work should be good always because we are representing our lord jesus oh hallelujah and the scripture is god's symphony only the composer knows what it really means hallelujah and the composers is getting the spirit and they write the script and act that musician giving us here hallelujah all them little quavers and semiquavers anybody who's a musician any part of the world i could read music reading the same thing oh glory to god they can't interpret this thing different no it says so it says so ping-pong how hard to do it or where to stretch it where to put it where to fling it and what they know all about that hallelujah because they understand to read the sheet music i have the ministers carry the music you know what men they play in a wrong tune they play in their own tune so the scripture is called symphony isn't that right only the composer knows what it really means he reveals it to those who are listening who are interested in knowing what the drama is you have to have to know about the symphony first the changing the junctions of the world or the music sometimes it's going this way for a while a certain beat after while it changes around what is it to you who wouldn't understand it or know nothing about it not interested in it it's racket it's a fuss but to those who know about it they're watching for it they know it is coming so we have these times of symphonies of god's word that the whole drama changes you who are interested listen for that change you know it's getting close you hear the way the drums are beaten hallelujah you know something going to change something's going to burst out in a few minutes you are watching for it you can tell the way the drums are timing oh god if you can hear the drums of the finish now you can hear the echo of the music of the heavenly word singing it out hallelujah the composer and those who are interested listen for the change that's what all this stuff is to us we are listening we are watching every time he appears something happens we see the time getting close we see back here not long ago when the churches were being drawn we were listening we've seen it was right with the word and it was vindicated we hear in the days of the seventh angel hallelujah we find out in revelation 10 in the days of the message of the seven angels the mystery of god shall be finished the seventh seal will be pulled back it should be there then all at once what happened a vision broke go to tucson great noise taking place hallelujah i'll shake up the earth then appeared in the sky shalom what is it a changing of beat it's a symphony remember the composer knows the end from the beginning he knows all about it and that's the reason you could write it now you must begin with him you must begin with him if you want to hear the symphony you begin with him like the music of the symphony you listen you know what it says it's going to be what the symphony is so if we preach our own interpretation and idea the people will never clue when they would begin the manifest you could find that force that off because that person that would be he not in the group he's nothing in his association he's not in this you know and that's what jesus that's all that's how describing fascists get blown out because they had their own interpretation of the scrolls and when the school itself come hallelujah which is jesus which are the scroll made flesh he was the odd man he was the admiral and he they expect messiah to come to them hallelujah and messiah was coming according to scripture and that same messiah promises over here will come according to scripture not according to no man's interpretation because god is suffering and he's a result and he's a revealer of the word itself so a man can't give you revelation and take the holy ghost to give revelation that why the devil is fight getting his spirit oh glory to god even in your house you have to be in your spirit you can't sit down like a lull off no no no you're better being your spirit inside your house i look how many spirits behind here i come here so i like to be in the spirit of minister to you minister angel's dropping here to give an option to minister to you inside the deal oh glory to god you can't sit down like a log like praise god you just take it then so it's not sure get in the spirit and if you get in the spirit god will reveal it to you like how god revealed it to me oh glory to god hallelujah no so anybody else that don't know nothing about what they're talking about they sit down it's just a bunch of nonsense rattling noise but the ones who know what it is it beats up with the music it's trumpets with the trumpets it is strong enough it is played with the violin it is beat on the bass it is strongly where the trumpet is beating the drums the whole thing is a rhythm and it makes the drama until they could close their eyes and live in it a man could close his eyes to earthly sight and live in the presence of jesus christ and you see his word being beat out in the great symphony that we are living in now you must begin with the symphony and the only thing you could do you you were in the symphony when you start you begin to get into rhythm i like that harlem you can't be out of timing you have to get in the rhythm of the thing oh you have to get any channel of the thing hallelujah and you don't stand there and look at it you're getting the rhythm of it how do you get there you are born into it it's the rhythm of the word and you become part of the word if you have to become in the path of a dance you have to get out there and dance you have to become the part of the ball game you're interested in you can talk to any bald game you have to become part of the word and the word know what the sympathy is it's plain for you to understand you're matching with the beat of time you are watching for it oh my hallelujah the works that i do shall do also oh praise god now they had the sheet in their hand but what did they do they take a portion that already played out back there so god controlling this infinity right paul martin lumber luther wesley and he played and they play in the symphony and then beats them gone already no it's over tuned ghost in a prophet isn't that right malachi 4 he already played on his part and he prophesied about a bride he said i see a bride called she's sealed to the kingdom of god the dynamics of this church will be receiving of the holy ghost what we see manifested temporarily will be manifested in his fullness when the press come down he see prophesying about this bride i wish i could lift to see it oh lord hallelujah when a man walked on the road and said silvan gold have like none such as have i given unto you we have to get into rhythm march into the symphony of the word i'm finishing now many people ask why they ask sometimes why why why must these things happen why did this happen to me why did i start and this happened i had this trouble here this upset me here i lost this here sometimes i've asked why why when i was a young minister for started out did god take my wife right out from under me take my baby right from beneath me right beneath my heart why did he do that i didn't know i do know i just held my hand and kept trusting he knows every junction he knows the rhythm when it must take place he knows what it takes to mold you he knows what kind of material he's going to use hallelujah the back side of the desert where god molds righteous men to sages and prophets that's where men are beat out men are beat out in the world when they got all kind of creed and stuff in them let them go come to the word of god and beat it right out of them and mose them i don't know how it goes but he knows he knows how it goes i don't but i look at here and say well it's just coming many of the afflictions are righteous but god delivered them out of them all god has moved to history with the rhythm of the promise of his word in each age in the same rhythm making his word that's how god moved through history and all the way from genesis to revelation he has moved to history with his word that's right with the rhythm of the power of the holy spirit vindicating his word to the elected remember he has never been able to touch the outside church it is only the elected as i close he permit him permit crossroads he may permit crossroads to try us to perfect us for his service he remember but permit you that now church both here and on tape he may permit crossroads for our service like he did daniel daniel lacrosse crush one day you know he's a great man and he let the king turn against him and truman alliance them it only perfected him sure did hebrew boys fiery furnace he may permit crossroads let them laugh at you for having long hair let them laugh at you for saying why you become a holy ruler whatever more let them laugh that's a crossroad a little junction and sometimes it takes hard trials to break the bands of the world off of us let me repeat that to all of you out there and that's for me too sometimes it takes hard trials to break the bands of the world off of us sometimes god let us have a little trial you know to see what we will do to take you out of the world other words let you have a little trial and knock you out of the organization and that idea that methodist is the only one the baptist the pentecostal that's the only group how much people do they believe that they're the only group any group of rapture and those are lies just sit and tell them that and if a man turned out to satan be any man talking about nonsense it'd have to be in christ has to be according to the word hallelujah praise god the only group they got and if you don't believe it like my church believe it you don't believe it at all sometimes he'll let all them trials happen maybe you got a sick baby maybe something takes place right at the end of death maybe someone taking from you what's it to do to break you away to show you something open your eyes maybe you come to criticize sometimes maybe you'll listen to this tape and just to criticize maybe god is doing that to break down some worldly band that got you bombed on like a drunken man in a river you have to take the man out of the river before you can get the revolt of the man you have to get him out of the river first then you get the river out of him sometimes god has to do it and that way he permits junctions and crossroads and stand on his promises and the world will never fail abraham was at his crossroads he knew that god could raise up his son from the dead and when he received him at the crossroads abraham come to his crossword and after he trusted god had seen all the miracles of god 25 years he waited for this boy a promised son and go tell him off him up and we know what happened and this last quote you did well a great audience hallelujah this is the final quote moses being bought with that great gift of faith moses born gift of faith he was anointed with commissioner of the burning bush to deliver god's people now sees what the great qualities this man had he was born for a certain thing god had a purpose in it god has got a purpose of you being here if you can only get to that place use how much trouble you're safe guarding yourself to moses born and then he afterwards he he brought the place where he was anointed notice the sea leaning there with an intellectual conception with all the faith he was born with deliver the people yet it never come to life until the light from that burning bush flashed across it until you see not something you read about but something is seen with his eyes something that spoke to him and he spoke back to it and i think that any man woman boy or girl in an intellectual conception of what they think the word is can never have a full foundation stand until they met that light that brings that word to reality i think no church in its practice no matter how intellectual and fundamental it might be that church cannot strive until the supernatural is made known among the people and they see it something they can talk to i will talk back to them that vinnicate has written a word oh let's wherever you are in your home just stand let's stand and give god some praise lord we bless you we thank you for those who love his appearance father may you drop down a love in the people's heart tonight for your appearing lord for either pee among us for you to appear in their lives and their
