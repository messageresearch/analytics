we are the light of the earth the salt of the earth lord so bless your people tonight touch your people tonight and raise us up in strength and confidence in your word in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen well it's certainly a great privilege and an honor to be here tonight and to see everyone out and uh we don't take it for granted thank you so much brother anthony for being so dedicated you're appreciated by the anthony o'brien this evening faithful soldier of the lord faithful servant of the lord and dedicated uh to to being ever-present support and truly we see the lord using him to create an atmosphere that he could just enter in that even though we're in our homes you know you could feel the anointing and to know that there are other believers that are connected you know it's it's a special strength that you know in this dimension this realm that we are in where we could all be connected around a central theme as it were we could be connected knowing that it's already done you know before i get into the teaching tonight um you know it's it's it's been it's been a time it's been a time you know we've been in this journey for over a year now and i can see you know they call it the new normal but it still doesn't feel normal you know there's there's no way i think the world can get accustomed to it as much as the world and who definitely you have to accept certain things there's this almost roller coaster context that you know we have started to get used to you know and and i've found and i realized that when you you know if you feed your spirit and your heart and your mind with with negativity and you feel your spirit in your mind with what's happening with the virus and these things it could make you feel a certain kind of way but i can assure you tonight if you feed on the word of god and you feed on god's promises and you feed on the plans that god has for you and you feed on what god says concerning you that your whole outlook on life will be different so i want to encourage you tonight while there is wisdom in being conscious and aware of what is going on it is critical that you fortify your heart and your mind and your spirit and your consciousness with who you are not with an arrogance and and a lack of wisdom but the truth and the reality that jesus paid it all our fate and our confidence in his word is real our trust is real and his sacrifice on khalp he was real we are not asking god to do what he has not already done he has already done it he has paid for your healing he has paid for your strength he has paid for your comfort so i want to challenge and encourage the church tonight lift yourself up out of the negativity lift yourself out of the mind battles the battle is in the mind you know i i've seen a lot of people struggling in recent times and it's easy to let your mind and and that's the devil playground you know he comes and say hey you're feeling too good you know and and this and that and before you know it you're in a state of being and and i want you to take faith and trust and confidence that god is in control god is in control he is sitting on the throne and nothing can happen that god does not allow to happen and if god allows something to happen it is for his honor it is for his glory and all things work together for good to them that love god and to them that are called according to his purpose the bible many times says fear not fear not fear not fear not for we have not been given the spirit of bondage again to fear so fear is not in our vocabulary it's not in our heart i'm not saying you're walking wrong scene i have feet and it's just brash walking around but i want you to understand that fear is not your promise faith is your promise healing is your promise strength is your promise confidence in god's word is your promise and having wisdom to navigate this time counts more than ever so by the grace of god tonight i trust that'll be an encouragement to you and that you could you know shake yourself and realize that although we may be virtual as it were god still expects us to grow he still expects us to learn he still expects as brother would say that process of character development because throughout all of this there are people who are growing and there are people who are dying there are people who are growing in god and the people who faith just getting crumpled up because you're not feeding your feet you're not building your feet so we come tonight by the grace of god to see our faith and our confidence built in the word of god tonight i do have a little thought um and if i could give it a little title tonight uh for this bible study it's spiritual leadership part one spiritual leadership part one and we are going to do a study of nehemiah tonight and before i get into that i just want to talk about leadership a little bit you know i remember speaking about leadership and preaching on leadership in the past and many times you know when we speak about spiritual leadership um they're really two sides of spiritual leadership there's firstly the more important side of being led so we talk about and and in the service i believe but over the last service or so he was speaking about simeon being led and blind anna being led that spiritual leadership that to know that your movements your actions your decisions you're being led by god so there's a difference with spiritual leadership versus being led by anything else being led by your boss being led by you know your gut instinct being led by fear the people who are led by fear you know fear drives people and when you release it wasn't leading you to make that decision it's fear or it's greed people are led by greed you know why did you buy that well i i i'm not sure and and when you really discern the root cause of it something is driving the action so if you find yourself doing something that you shouldn't be doing and you're not sure why you did it something led you you know you could call it influence you could call it whatever it is but the point is you can move from one state to the other without some type of leadership having an impact on it you may not realize you're being led but in reality there are only two categories in the world you're either a leader or your follower and if you realize that your state of being is not where you think you should be or you're not sure where you are or whatever then then something led you people listen to music and their behavior conforms to music and they don't discern and realize that the music led them to a certain state of being a certain emotional state so leadership is a multifaceted thing and we understand and we should appreciate being in this room tonight that spiritual leadership above all else is important because we want to be led by god we want to be influenced by god we want to be sensitive to that still small voice that tells us what to do and how to move and how to live and how to act but spiritual leadership has another dimension to it beyond just being led by god and being the receiving end of leadership we are all challenged to be leaders ourselves the reality is and i've been on this for a while where god told moses you'll be a kingdom of priests the role of king and role of priests abode leadership roles by the time you read your new testament the bible says you are kings and priests so if you are in this room i'm speaking to leaders tonight not followers as young people we challenge you that you shouldn't be following anybody peer pressure are words that doesn't affect us because we are the ones who put pressure on our peers and not the other way around because we are leaders and not followers leadership is a make-or-break type situation companies rise and fall on leadership governments rise and fall on leadership kingdoms rise and fall on leadership families rise and fall on leadership leadership is a vast study millions of dollars have been invested in analyzing what makes the perfect ceo from a leadership perspective countless hours of research people look at the largest companies in the world and look that people have the same 24 hours a day and because of leadership people accomplish different things you look through the scripture and you see god has a hand in who he chooses for leadership moses didn't apply for his position david didn't apply for his position elijah didn't apply for his position god was hand picking leaders leaders he can trust leaders he could have confidence in and leaders he can use now in this day we speak of the hardest age the toughest age the most difficult age god would have had to spend extra time to identify leaders that he could place in different companies in different neighborhoods in different families in different roles and responsibilities that he could call his leaders of today kings and priests as parents we are charged to lead lead by example lead by our choice of words lead by how we give comfort lead by how we negotiate lead by how we influence no matter your role no matter your responsibility whether it is leadership entitled or not you are still a leader leadership is not just about rank leadership can be situational i have certain skills i am not a hiker i am not a hunter if i take my team in my office out to hike or hunt although i am leader in the office i don't trust myself nor should my company trust me to be the leader on the hike because that is not my experience it is not my strength so leadership can be situational sometimes a situation happens and and somebody needs first aid the leader is the person who can administer the first aid isn't that right so depending on the situation depending on the context we talk about leadership but now let's bring into our theme on our topic tonight because by the grace of god we'll see how god will unfold this to us leadership is such a vast area of study but we want to hone in on a study here on nehemiah who is one of the most interesting interesting studies in scripture on the rise of a leader the growth of a leader and before i get into nehemiah himself i want to give a little bit of a background so around 605 or so to around 586 bc god would have chased on his people because of their continued unfaithfulness to his covenant you would know through the old testament there will be this valley and mountains of the children of israel being you know in line with god and then there's this decline there's this descent from point of victory to somehow something happening idol worship this that or the other and they descend so god is upset he's looking at what's going on and because of their unfaithfulness he allows the babylonians to suck and destroy jerusalem jerusalem the city of peace jerusalem where the temple is established god allows it however as god's word always is he promises his people that after 70 years of captivity they would be allowed to return context for this will be found in jeremiah 25 20 11. i'm just going to read it we will find our substantive text shortly but in jeremiah 25 verse 10 bible says moreover i will take from them the voice of muth so god is talking about his own people i will take the voice of myth mirth is is like laughter so the voice of laughter and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride the sound of the millstones that's working on the light of the candle and this whole land shall be desolation and an astonishment and these nations shall serve the king of babylon 70 years and it shall come to pass when 70 years accomplish that i will punish the king of babylon this reminds you almost as as the children of israel going into egypt and after 400 years god brings them out here it is goddess and i will punish the king of babylon and that nation said the lord for the iniquity and the land of the chaldeans and i will make it a perpetual desolation so this is the context and the background that we are building into and if you were to study the book of ezra which is deeply connected to the book of nehemiah we would see that within the book of ezra we see the recording and the elements of the recording or the fulfillment of this pro of this promise the return to jerusalem after the people would have been taken from jerusalem would have been supported through three persian kings cyrus darius and ataxis i'm not going to get too deep into that just some historical context before we come to our substantive text tonight cyrus would have overthrown babylon in 539 bc and in accordance with his policy of freeing people who were in captivity he would have issued a decree to allow jews to return to jerusalem historians say that around maybe 50 000 of them also would have gone back to jerusalem and the foundation or saw the temple would have been rebuilt with zerubbabel ezra would lead a second return to jerusalem in around 458 bc and our study tonight deals with the third return under nehemiah just about 12 years or so after ezra went back to jerusalem we find our text just before we get into it just for historical context daniel would have been taken about into babylon with the first exiles so this journey would have started with danielle going into babylon the complete fall of jerusalem most of the jews would be now in babylon cyrus will overthrow babylon zerubbabel will take some people back the temple would begin to be rebuilt queen esther would be around that time as well as we fade into closer to our text tonight ezra will carry the second wave back to jerusalem and here we meet nehemiah still there all right so let's go to the book of nehemiah chapter one and verse one nehemiah right between ezra and esther the words of nehemiah the son of hercelia and it came to pass that in the manchester in the 20th year as i was in shushan the palace now this month here is like is the ninth month in the jewish calendar which is like november december or wrongly in november december in in our in our context so it came to pass in the manchester in the 20th year as i was in shush on the palace that hannah and i one of my brethren came he and certain men of judah and of judah basically mean they came from judah and when they came and i asked them concerning the jews that had escaped which were left of the captivity and concerning jerusalem so here we find a situation and the bible doesn't give us a background of nehemiah how he grew up what his context was we find a snapshot of nehemiah saying he is in shushan which is like iran today he is in the palace and one of his brethren comes from judah so this is somebody who would have returned to jerusalem come to visit him it doesn't tell us why nehemiah is still there because they would have been all given the opportunity to go to jerusalem everybody with me but nehemiah finds himself still there in shushan the palace and he is visited so clearly he has some he still has his connection to his people but there's some connection as well to his his place where he's serving as it will all right so he asked a question and it's interesting he asked them concerning the jews that had escaped so he wants to know about the welfare about those who are left and he wants to know about what's happening in jerusalem in other words what's happening with my people not just my people but jerusalem is special what is happening with jerusalem and they said unto me verse 3 the remnants that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach the wall of jerusalem also is broken down and the gates thereof are burned with fire verse 4 and it came to pass so this is nehemiah speaking and it came to pass when i heard these words that i sat down and wept and mourned certain days and fasted and prayed before the god of heaven so i want to first highlight something here it means that when nehemiah heard this the news was so troubling to him that he was overwhelmed by it but i want us to notice his first response yes he sat down yes he wept yes he moaned but he fasted and prayed before the god of heaven many of us we go through different experiences where we get bad news because to nehemiah this was bad news not just bad news this was a series of bad news he has told that the remnants are in great affliction they are in reproach the walls are broken down and the gates are burnt that is like four pieces of bad news so the people are in trouble the city is in trouble and the city being in trouble is about the wall being broken down many times we hear about the wars need to come down the walls need to come down this is different this is where the walls have to go up here we're talking about the walls of defense because not only were his people in trouble but walls serve also as protection so we're not talking here about walls of jealousy and walls of envy and walls between churches and that's not what we're talking about here right now we're talking about jerusalem being unprotected what good is it to have a wall and the gate is not there so not only was the wall broken down but the gates also burned with fire so nehemiah is in sun as it were serving in his role which we will discover what it is as it were but he hasn't lost his burden anybody with me he hasn't lost his concern he hasn't lost his connection with what is important the people of god having a need he is interested in their well-being he's interested in how are things with them he's entrusted with the city that sacred city of jerusalem and what's going on there and it troubles him so much that he weeps he sits down and he mourns to mourn is a deep word because mourn is not it's not whale morn is when you realize something has died to him it is dead and that itself is a grief that comes with it but what i love about this he doesn't sit down there and stay in moping and stay crying he fasts and he prays anybody with me i want to go quickly into his prayer verse 5 and said i beseech thee oh lord god of heaven and i want to give us a context of prayer because therein in things like these or scriptures like these this is what should help us with how we structure how we pray because his situation was such that it's a great situation and we are seeing into who this nehemiah is not a priest nehemiah is not a prophet nehemiah is up to this moment and nobody let me be clear within the context of jerusalem nobody knows who he is anybody with anybody with me but he's a spiritual man because his default first response is prayer and fasting what is your default first response what is your first response when a situation takes place i want you to think about that these are the probing questions let's go his prayer and said i beseech thee o lord god of heaven the great and terrible god that keep it covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments let thine air now be attentive and then eyes open that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant which i pray thee now day and night for the children of israel thy servants and confess the sins of the children of israel which we have sinned against thee now both i and my father's house have sinned now bear in mind he hasn't asked for anything yet i want us to acknowledge the structure of his prayer he acknowledges who god is i beseech the o lord god of heaven the great and terrible god that keep it covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments so he said i acknowledge who you are i acknowledge your role i acknowledge who i'm coming to i'm not coming casually i'm not coming not with a revelation of who you are what you could do your power your grace your majesty your might your dominion and then he goes from who god is to the call to attention let thine air now be attentive it's like we're singing past be not or gentle savior hear my cry oh god an attendant to my prayer let daniel be intended by nine eyes open that domius here in the prayer of thy servant which i pray before thee day and night so we see already there's this connection and a consistency with nehemiah having a prayer life and we'll see it highlighted later on as we go on this is not like in recent times people like to take vitamins when they feel sick and i've realized that many of us say you take a bite when you take a vitamin c you take this you take that no i get enough feeling that i'm feeling that i'm feeling good and you're not taking it but the moment you get a bad feeling you have any emergency you have any reduction and and you take it for that period of time to try to get feeling a little better anybody with me so it's it's almost as if you're you're run to this thing because there's a crisis but people will tell you if you are consistently doing the right thing your immune system would be stronger so here it is many of us we go to prayer in an emergency but we're seeing a messaging coming from nehemiah and we're getting going to get deeper soon that he has a relationship with god because he's saying before thee now day and night for the children of israel we're going on thy servants and confess the sins of the children of israel which we have sinned against thee both i and my father's house have sinned now you see this here i want to capture this about taking responsibility i was speaking about over recently about a situation and i said part of the challenge with people is taking responsibility and i was sharing something i read in a book about total ownership i say at the end of the day until you take responsibility for where you are at it is extremely difficult for you to move to the next step nehemiah essaying is therefore is therefore even within his confession as it were he said for the children of israelite servants and confess the sins of the children of israel which we have sinned against thee both i and my father's house have sinned he said lord i accepted my part in this situation that we are in he's still praying we have dealt very corruptly against thee and have not kept the commandments nor the statutes nor the judgment which thou commanded thy servant moses but now he changed gear now he chew in the next gear remember i beseech thee the word that thou commanded thy servant moses saying if ye transgress i will scatter you abroad among the nations but if you turn unto me and keep my commandments and do them though they will of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven yet will i gather them from bring them under themselves place that have chosen to set my name there now that's powerful powerful powerful this man didn't go back to jerusalem he is in a position there in iran or shushan as it were but the word hasn't departed from his heart he knows his context he knows his scripture he knows the word he knows the wrong responsibility now these are thy servants and thy people whom thou has redeemed by thy great power and by thy strong hand o lord i beseech thee left now thine air be attentive to the prayer of thy servant unto the prayer of thy servants who desire to fear thy name and prosper i pray thee thy servant this day and grant him mercy in the sight of this man for i was the king's cobra now this is a powerful context in nehemiah 1 because now we begin to see and understand some light into how god operates here it was nehemiah could have returned to jerusalem but he stayed because he held a very trusted position as the king's cabera the king's cabera is one of the most trusted positions because the king's cabera in those days would typically have to taste the drink before the king drinks it to make sure that the king would be okay in those days whoever get close to the king the closer you had relation to the king is the more trusted you obviously had to be so nehemiah was a man of such character that he was the king's cabera the fact that he was a jew serving as it were a king or a heathen king if you want to say that spoke more volume of nehemiah's character because the king was willing to trust somebody who was not one of his own it speaks volumes of nehemiah's character anybody with me there's also a connection because this is ataxis ataxis would be the son effectively of xerxes xerxes his father was would have been you want to marry queen esther anybody with me so for context ataxis would have undoubtedly known about esther the relationship of esta of his people he would have understood the trust that would have been expressed by his father in somebody like morikai anybody with me i wanted to understand the experience that ataxis as a young boy would now have heard how his father would have been saved his life by a jew named mordecai so it would not be a stretch for him to have confidence in a jew maybe maybe just maybe this is why nehemiah stayed back because there was such a trust and a relationship he would have built with the king as it were that although he had the opportunity to go back to jerusalem he stayed there abiding his time and note his statements i pray thee thy servant this day and grant him mercy in the sight of this man so there's something he wants to get from this man who is king anybody with me now bear in mind our teaching today is on spiritual leadership leadership is about making decisions managing resources dealing with conflict dealing with how to negotiate how to make requests and all these things let's go chapter two and it came to pass in the month of nisan and for our bible scholars this would be about four months after because the month of nisan is like march april so and it came to pass in the month nissan just about four months after the events in chapter one in the 20th year of ataxis the king that wine was before him and i took up the wine and gave it unto the king no i had not been before time sad in his presence no that is that is something answer you know what it is for somebody to say but i never see that man sad boy you know there's some people soon you see them and say you don't want to even approach them they don't want to talk to them their countenance yes no when they push them it meant that the typical nehemiah was a person who wasn't sad he wasn't appearing to be stressed you know listen it's it's is that yeah everybody have a limited how much stress you can take in them people who bring stress is like a what's not is to look for the nearest window the nearest door and see how quickly you can get out of there you know so the king wasn't used to seeing nehemiah look in a certain kind of way i want to build a context it is not that nehemiah wouldn't have had rough days or bad days but he is making a point no i had not been before time sad in his presence we don't know how long nehemiah was kabira but he said in my whole history of working for this king the king could never say he saw me sad in his presence not only was it an issue of being sad in those days being sad in a king's presence was an offense oh come on now now hold on before i dig deep on this one being sad in the king's presence was an offense you know so i asked you a question tonight if this natural king would make it an offense to come in his presence sad what about our king what gives us the right to enter into the kings anybody with me tonight do we have anybody in the house tonight what gives us the right to approach our king sad when we know what he can do for us anybody with me we understand what our king could do for us what gives us the right to approach the throne of grace for which we have been granted access we're not begging for access we're not requesting access the access has already been granted bear in mind after xerxes father xerxes would have been the king who had to hold out his scepter for esther to come into his presence coming into the presence of the king was something that was controlled you couldn't just walk to the king so they came to allow a cupbearer to come into his presence had to be somebody he could tolerate at any point in time so the testimony of nehemiah was real i had not been before time saturday in his presence wherefore verse 2 the king said unto me why is thy countenance sad seeing thou art not sick so the king is saying there's only one exception to the rule if you're sick i could understand but i know you're not sick so why are you sad you you you you see the context and the king deserves this is nothing else but sorrow of heart sorrow of heart sorrow of heart something in your heart that affecting you so much your countenance your disposition your outlook you wear your walk you wear your shoulder look everything you just say oh gosh he the king said this is not that he might know something is bothering nehemiah then i was very so afraid so so nehemiah understanding the consequence of being sad said then i was so afraid you wouldn't be afraid if there was no potential consequence the king calling him is out on his sadness and i want to say it again god doesn't give us excuse to be sad in his presence he said let the weak say i'm strong enter into his gate with time given david said i was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of god i trust in this lockdown period that you will work on your smile working on how you lift your shoulder working out your leg so the next time you get it up you didn't go to the house of god god wouldn't say why are you coming to his presence looking sad but robert was preaching a service or so ago he said you can't come to church take a fight with the elder fight with the deacon fight with the usher not church not the house of god anybody with me i wish i could see some more faces you know thank you for the clearance but thompson but for the for the encouragement because i i feel like i have fire i look at it church if if if you could walk and put it on some cameras it will it will help i feel like somebody charged me pulpits it's not easy to preach your name there so so he said then i was very so afraid so so so nehemiah got petrified because he may not have even realized how his countenance had changed i want to highlight the fact that he was not deliberately looking sad but the burden he was carrying had become overwhelming the burden he was carrying had become so much that he could no longer pretend to be happy we're going a little deeper now so he was not trying to put on a show anymore he really had a need he was being affected so the king who is no fool calls it out he said then i was so afraid and said unto the king let the king live forever why should not my countenance be sad when the city the place of my father's focus in other words the place where my fathers are buried lie at waist and the gaze thereof are consumed with fire now this is where the shift takes place here and this begins to answer the question about relationship and about why he is still there and about what his role is and about what is happening all right he said let the king live forever and he explains this then the king said unto me for what dost thou make request now this here is one of the greatest leadership lessons in scripture because you can't be walking around sad and you're getting questioned what do you need and they say well here now i'm not sure you know i'm not i have a knee but i'm not sure i really you know i just so stressed out i don't know this was not nehemiah anybody with me here it is the king said unto me for what does thou make requests and listen to his answer so i pray to the god of heaven and i said unto the king so i ask you a question firstly what type of prayer is this in verse 4 we know that he has been praying for four months he is in the presence of the king and before he even starts to answer the bible says so i pray to the god of heaven and then i said to the king so in other words this is more than likely it's one of those inaudible prayers this is this is going any presence of the kingdom tell a king like this give me a timeout let me go and pray and come back that doesn't work here anybody with me so it meant that his relationship with god was such one that he could talk to the lord almost like i need the right words give me come on give me the right way to say it because it's not as if nehemiah didn't know what he wanted and we'll get into it because we're dealing with the making of a leader anybody with me then so i pray to the god of heaven so let me challenge you tonight do you have such a relationship in your prayer life that if you make a request in a few seconds you and god have a relationship that that that that built up over time that when you come to him he could recognize your voice right away because you have been building this thing over anybody with me so i prayed to the god of heaven and i said unto the king if it pleased the king and if thy servant have found favor in thy sight that thou were send me unto judah so listen listen he start to make his request remember the king asks what is the request so request number one based on relationship so now we see in the benefits of his decision to have stayed there for that period of time because he built a relationship he said if it pleased the king and if thy servant have found favor in thy sight that thou would ascend me unto judah unto the city of my father's sea falca that i may build it one and the king said unto me the queen also sitting by him scholars have argued over this queen sitting by him wondering if perhaps queen esther was still alive i've heard some say because she would have been still queen potentially if she was alive because this would have been her stepson or so but the queen was sitting with him for how long shall the journey be look at the question for how long shall thy journey be again leadership and when will door return so it pleased the king to send me and i set him a time so nehemiah was able to give him the time it will take to build it so it means that nehemiah was just praying he was praying and planning anybody with me you're currently king well king know your ass with this i didn't really think about it you know but give me two weeks and i will let you know i calculate i don't know what i need you see leadership here all right moreover i said unto the king so not only did he ask for permission to build and he got it not only was he able to answer the king's question about how long it will take because the king is saying for how long shall my journey be and when will dar return when will door return speaks to the gravity of the relationship between the king and his cabrera the goody king is hearing his desire seeing his sad countenance knowing what he wants to do for god and his people and the king don't want to break the relationship she asked him i will tell you no but here is not you need to come back along i don't have an excavator like you see the impact that you as a christian can have in your workplace oh come on somebody help me tonight you see the relationship you could have in your place of work in your job in so much and you could have such trust and confidence and such a testimony that this king would look at nehemiah and say i will allow you to go but when will you be back i'm not sure things will run the same way if you're not here it reminds us of joseph it reminds us of daniel it reminds us of characters in scripture who lived such a life that their absence was more painful anybody with me you remember in the case of joseph the king had to do 44 remember had to make no decision outside of what he had to eat remember we we answered that the hardest decision but if i had to make is no the king sorry the only king had to make was what he had to eat for how long should i like the journey and where would i return so it pleased the king to send me and i set him a time moreover i said unto the king if it please the king now this is how much request so clearly nehemiah had been thinking for the last four months on everything he would need to fulfill this burden in his heart so i want to create this balance in us between fate and action and when i trust in a workout i trust any workout he was trusting he was praying but he was running a calculator he was writing down what he needs to move from point a to point b his prayer was if the lord makes a way i know what i need to do to accomplish this thing anybody with me moreover verse 7 i said unto the king if it please the king let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river that they may con convey me over till i come unto judah in other words i want safe passage i want a letter that guarantees i can reach my destination one two that they will know i am coming under your instructions anybody with me verse eight now this is where it gets interesting and a letter under asaph the keeper of the king's forest that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates so now nehemiah is making a withdrawal from the king's treasury i want you to see the context nehemiah has a burden to go and fix things he stayed there for a reason now he's saying i need lumber i need material i need a letter because the king's forest was protected you can't just go and say i won two trees and cut it down and drive off in a horse with it so he had to get a letter so he clearly understood not only what he needed but what was required to get what he needed so you can't tell me you want to open a bank account and you don't know you need a job letter and you need your id card and you you need a utility bill you're praying in faith you want to work you're praying in faith you're paying your faith you need to still with all your faith bring your id card they need to know who you are any anybody with me he didn't say give me permission to go and get lumber no he said and a letter on the asap the keeper of the king's forest that he may give me timber you see the challenge with many of us believers we like shortcuts and we want god to do things for us and we're seeing here nehemiah understanding the context of his environment and he is praying because in the end of chapter one we saw he said lord help me to get faith in front of this man because i have to make certain requests and i need the right words to use and i'm working on what i need to have you see leadership planning context a letter unto asap the keeper of the king's forest that he may give me timber to make beams so not just timber i don't carry wood and i don't know what i needed for give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which i pertain to the house and for the wall of the city and for the house that i shall enter into so he's saying while i'm over there i need to live somewhere this is a cup bearer and that's what i'm saying it's a it's leadership and the creation of a leader this wasn't a architect this wasn't an engineer this is a spirit-filled spirit-led inspired man with a burden serving in his job with such a testimony that the king don't want to lose him we don't know if when they were leaving to go back to jerusalem the king begged him to stay but he stayed and maintained a testimony and he never lost his burden in lockdown don't lose your burden in your job don't lose your burden change of role position don't lose your burden when the opportunity presents itself for him to express his needs he doesn't come half-heartedly well i just need a touch i just need a blessing no he is clear he is precise he is detailed he is articulate before he even answers he prays before he starts to respond because he don't want to see the wrong thing he don't want to forget one piece of detail i don't know if he had it written on a paper in his pocket so that when the chance came to express what he needed he would have it but he was able to articulate i need timber for a number of reasons to make beams for the gates of the palace which i pertain to the house and for the wall of the city and for the house that i shall enter into and the king granted me according to the good hand of my god upon me verse 9 then i came to the governors beyond the river and gave them the king's letters the king's letters is the king's words the king's authority you can't challenge your king's letters you can't challenge a king's authority you can't challenge a king's word now the king had sent listen captains of the army and horsemen with me noticed this is not something he had asked for what relationship you have with the king that when it's time for you to go he is also sending protection you say this makes me examine my life you know are you effective in influencing people around you based on a relationship with god that they will go above and beyond because he is going to restore jerusalem and god is using a heathen king to pay for all he would pay for the protection for his silver nehemiah to go and lead the rebuilding all right now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me and when sun balat the horror knight and tobiah the servant the ammo knight heard of it grieve them exceedingly that there was come a man listen to seek the well fear of the children of israel so i came to jerusalem and was there three nights or three days it's about a 1100 mile journey between shushan and jerusalem could we take some more leadership so we see his life his testimony his understanding of his needs he is now in jerusalem with the resources that based on his prayer and planning have brought him there verse 12 and i arose in the night so as a leader he is now operating because he doesn't want everybody to understand his movements and i arose in the night i and some few men with me as a leader you have to know who to trust you can't tell everybody your business you can't trust everybody and some few men with me listen neither told i any man what my god had put in my heart to do at jerusalem so even these few men who were with him didn't understand what he was doing i want us to see it we're building leadership now you can't tell everybody there's some things that is in your heart and you need to know when to keep it in your heart and when to get it out of your heart neither was there any beast with me saved the beast that i rode upon and i went on by night so i want you to picture it he gets to jerusalem he's there for three days and when nobody's watching he gets a few men get up on his horse as it were and during the night he begins to ride around looking at the ruins of jerusalem he has heard about it he hasn't seen it for himself all he has is hearsay but he wants to know for himself what he's up against you want to understand what he has to deal with anybody with me because the best plans on paper is different when they confront the reality of the situation and i went on by night by the gate of the valley even before the dragon well entered a dung port and viewed the walls of jerusalem which were broken down and the gates thereof were consumed with fire he had heard about it but now he's seeing it for himself then i went on to the gate of the fountain at the king's pool but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass he talked about so much rubble so much decay so much everything then went i up in the night by the brook and view the wall and turn back i want you to picture picture him on a horse as it were walking around looking around trying to understand how this place get like this this is not how it's supposed to be i can't even pass here this thing is messed up look how horrible this thing is and this is jerusalem then i went up in the night by the brook and viewed a wall and turned back and entered by the gate of the valley and so returned and the rulers knew not whether i went or what i did neither had i as he had told it to the jews nor to the priests nor to the nobles nor to the rulers nor to the rest that did the work so he was just doing his research doing his analysis taking an inventory because you want to make the right moves you want to make the right step you're not doing things viki vik as we say here you're not doing things you're just doing something he wanted to be prepared he wanted to be precise we're building leaders now i want you to take lessons from all of these attributes now then said i unto them after he did his research in business recorded due diligence he did his due diligence then said i unto them you see the distress that we are in notice some scholars have brought attention to his use of weak and the significance of using we after being there for three days these jews he has speaking to have been there for at least 12 years he is there for three days and he's using you see that the stress that we are in so he identifies with the stress he didn't come and say how old i have it so only here for 12 years now you me to tell me in 12 years ola couldn't fix this you mean to tell me all i can paint this wall you mean to tell me at his approach leadership because he can do it alone and lead us understand you cannot do it alone this is not for nehemiah's honor it is not a nehemiah's glory his burden is for the things of god and he needs to win the support of those who have been there but may have lacked vision somebody help me tonight they have been there but maybe the burden maybe the frustration maybe for so long it's like that they lose sight of the glory of the temple and the glory of jerusalem then said i unto them you see the distress that we are in we are in how jerusalem lie at waste and the gears thereof are burned with fire come let us build up the wall of jerusalem that we be no more or reproached then i know after he involved them so he hasn't told them what he has come with yet he rallying support and then i told them of the hand of my god which was upon me as also the king's word that he had spoken unto me and they said let us rise up and build so they strengthen their hands for this good work anybody with me tonight let's build a little bit but when san balat the horror knight and tobiah the servant the ammonite and gershom the arabian heard it they laughed us to scorn no these are governors part of this is like part of jordan and different areas around that and despised us and said what is this thing that he do will he rebel against the king in other words are you coming to rebel against the king then answered i them and i want this identified here this here is the wisdom of nehemiah bringing the letters because these men know that if they touch nehemiah and what he's starting to do they'll be going against the king so they can only use words at this point so they're trying to discourage um what is the thing that you're here to do will he rebel against the king then answered i them and sell unto them the god of heaven he will prosper us therefore we his servants will arise and build but ye have no portion no right no memorial in jerusalem i love that he put him in their place he said you have no portion there's no peace there's nothing here you have no you have no right to anything here there's no memorial we have memorials here in jerusalem can we take a little more i'm gonna quickly touch on nehemiah because nehemiah 3 is about neiman workers i'm just going to read some of it then elias ship the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests so the priests get involved in the building and they build a sheep heat they sanctified it settle the doors of it even unto the tower of mir they sanctified it onto the tower of hane then next unto him building the men of jericho next to him bill zakir the son of imre but the fish gate the sons of hasanah built who ordered lady beams thereof and next unto them mary mart the son of origin the son of curse and next unto them muslim and it goes on name after name after name after name the wall of nehemiah tree is about the names and as i was reading this because i wouldn't read all of it in your own study i'm saying could your name be added because every every scripture has a reason and a purpose for all time eternity these names will be recorded as the men who rebuilt started the rebuilding of the wall and the bible says it's verse five and next unto them the checker the the techyoics repaired by their nobles put not there next to the work of their lord so the bible ultimately there were people among them who were who i get involved in the working you always have them what going on the people who they're getting and making me work there they're not interested in being involved in the work so my encouragement in this chapter is would your name be recorded that is the question i have about this chapter when there's an assessment on a roll call of those who are working will your name be called or will you be like one of them whose necks were not in the work meaning you had no burden you had no passion no zeal so chapter four and it's our last chapter for tonight if we could get it all true this is now the test on nehemiah's leadership is rising bear in mind his resume cup bearer by the time we reach chapter four he has successfully negotiated lumber resources for the rebuilding of the world he has successfully rallied a team together he has articulated a vision he has gotten support for division he has motivated the children of israel as it were to do work in the face of san bernardino laughing and saying what are they doing here so he is now developing and new challenges are now coming to him and let's go nehemiah 4 verse 1. but it came to pass that winston ballard hood that we builded a wall he was wrought builded past ten so work has progressed this is no longer we have an idea to build so at the beginning of the journey before the building started sunbala was throwing wood and taunting them saying what will they come for what are they trying to do and whenever you try to do something there'll be somebody will tell you what you're trying to do why are you trying to go into business why are you trying to get a promotion why are you applying for a new job why are you doing something different why are still at it words clearly failed because at this point from chapter three everybody now is part of the building so stand by let's realize this thing is happening it is no longer an idea the idea is now a reality so but it came to pass that when somebody heard that we built the world he was wrought rock means angry and took great indignation and mock the jews so he tearing up the heat that we first witnessed in chapter two and he speak before his brethren and the army of samaria and said what do these feeble jews so he's saying what these weak jews doing now if you're not grounded in your heart and you don't have confidence in what you're doing you will let words destroy you will they fortify themselves will they sacrifice so he's mocking them he's blocking them will they make an end in a day will they revive these stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned he taunting them now tobiah the ammonite so this is sun balot ammonite now is a different group now was by him and he said even that which they build if a fox go up he shall even break down their stone wall look at the disrespect so tobias say them fellas so not building good that if a little animal go up and climb in this wall you all coming back down you know how discouraging that could be when you know you're working hard with limited resources and somebody just watching you work there's nothing more infuriating than you putting out effort to do something you know i i saw a situation where somebody painted a nose and somebody passes you know who's that how are you painting it but i know how to paint it right wrong that's just wrong yeah and there are people who just will pass some comment make statements nobody ever teach you to do it good luck with that yes when i pass we're going to see your master and before and after is somebody like birthday balloon i feel so deflated what the about go back inside making very effort have no value so so at this point they're trying to demotivate the motivated children of israel say if a dog walk on the wall if a look at all your that me that concrete work is so horrible and if a dog if a forks go up he shall break down their stone wall but here now nehemiah is stepping into his role now he is being challenged because leadership is not knowing all the answers because you haven't met all these situations yet it is about being able to deal with challenges as they come up so this is not there was no playbook there was no book that they might say well the last time it's happened he is dealing with it as it comes he said here oh our god for we are despised he gone to prayer there's a consistency in nehemiah's responses to situations we will see the first time he heard the bad news in chapter one he went to prayer when he was challenged to give an answer he went to prayer now he is meeting a new situation because the fact that he goes to prayer means that there is some effect on the situation so there has to be a response so he goes into prayer he said hear o our god for we are despised and turn their reproach upon their own head and give them for a prey in the land of captivity and cover not their iniquity and left not their sin be blotted out from before thee this is a real aggressive prayer this is not like we pray in chapter one this prayer is nehemiah praying a prayer of i can almost say vengeance he say hear our god for we are despised you say we are under pressure turn their reproach upon their own head in other words they curse on us reverse it on them give them for our pray in the land of captivity in other words make them vulnerable to attack cover not their iniquity in other words notice what they're doing wrong let not their sin be blotted out from before thee in other words hold their sin against them for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders so nehemiah's saying god they provoking you before the builders so and nehemiah goes on now because this is written is him is a first-person experience here so built we the wall versus six and all the walls so he prayed and then continue building everybody with me so it's an encouragement to us as leaders something goes wrong pray and keep going pray don't lose focus pray and continue all right so we built the wall and all the world was joined together onto the half thereof for the people listen had a mind to in the amplified city had a heart to work so his prayer and the resilience and the fact that he didn't get discouraged of course you hear what they say they say if a walk on the wall you all come down well let's check that one shake it shake it see if it's standing up that was not his approach he prayed and kept on working listen to verse seven clearly the prayer and the action created a focus in them but it came to pass that when san ballot and tobiah and the arabians and the ammonites and the ashdodites heard that the walls of jerusalem were made up and that the breaches began to be stopped in other words they were closing the gaps closing the openings there was no room for anybody with me so so i want to encourage you and i don't stop don't stop praying don't stop building don't stop in the wood don't stop keep focused pray and keep moving when they saw it and the breaches began to be stopped then they were very wrought and conspired all of them come together united movement united nations multiple countries here to come and to fight no it's no longer words in chapter two as it were it was why are they doing this what are they doing this at the beginning of this chapter is all you're weak all your feeble no they are so angry they are conspiring to come to fight against jerusalem and to hinder it you think the enemy will see you making progress and not put up some resistance you don't think that if you push your mind battles aside and say this virus can't come into my house and this guy affect me in this season you don't think the devil will try to come and intensify his attack but we are warriors and now we're going to the warrior part of it now because brother branham say the devil will make you test all them we're choosing them he's not gonna let you just have the virtues and not test it these believers prayed and continued working and they come together for a war now verse nine can we take some more we we we we at home right nevertheless verse nine we made our prayer unto our god and listen they just didn't pray i want to get this to us now they prayed to get strength to keep working but now in verse nine nevertheless they didn't stop praying we made our prayer unto our god and set a watch against them day and night because of them so nehemiah's saying look they're trying to attack us we set on a watch we will pray and we will watch we will watch and pray anybody with me we're not just praying and say well we hope and work out no no no let's set a watch because if they move we want to know they're moving verse 10 and judah said the strength of the bearers of the burden is decayed and there's much rubbish so that we are not able to build a wall so there's a there's a physical exhaustion that's happening here now stress level is increasing and neymar has to counter all these things right and our adversaries verse 11 said they shall not know neither see till we come in the midst among them and slay them and cause the work to cease verse 12 and it came to pass that when the jews which dwelt by them came they said unto us ten times from all places whence you shall return unto us they shall be upon you therefore listen to the nehemiah set i in the lower places behind the wall and on the higher places i even set the people after their families with their swords their spears and their bows so he's arming the people and i looked and rose up and said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people be naughty afraid of them you see how we started the session be not afraid of them remember the lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brethren your sons and your daughters your wives and your houses hear the words of a cub bearer who has turned into a general he said be not afraid of them remember the lord that's my encouragement to you tonight as leaders in your house when your children stress when your wives stress when your family stress this is your message to them be not afraid whatever the situation is remember the lord don't remember the corona count that's not what you remember the lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brethren your sons and your daughters your wives and your houses and it came to pass listen when our enemies heard that it was known unto us and god had brought their counsel to north that we returned all of us to the wall everyone under his work so when the enemy realized that yes sit down and cry yesterday and pack up shop yes sir stop building and their council meaning their plans come to nothing because you're made of defense come on now you're reality troops we come tonight the reality troops to say fear not we are more than able we come tonight to remember our lord and we come to fight for our houses fight for our families fight for our healing fight for our revival fight for our breakthrough anybody with me i'm almost done can you take a little more whoo and it came to pass everyone rewind back that doesn't mean i want to read this again i don't want to miss these things and it came to pass when our enemies heard that it was known unto us this reminds of of when the syrian army was planning and they said it like if somebody always in the planning room and the record was elisha was was was there he wasn't there but he was there so whenever they do something they know what's going on you don't think god knows what's going on so when the enemy heard that it was known to us because how they know because your prayer life is stopped it increased you're not doing more you do it you're not doing less you're doing more you're not so in fear you're showing feet you're not backing down you're fighting for your family and god had brought their counsel to naught that we return all of us to the wall we come back to defense mode we come back to building up a defense for our homes for our families for this revival for what we fought for all these years everyone on to his work and it came to pass i love this part we almost done from that time fought that half of my servants wrought in the work and the other half of them held both the spears the shields the bows and the habitants so in other words nehemiah now is dealing with the situation he said know that we back out in force we're going to do this differently half of you will be building the other half you have your sword you have your spear you have your shield you have your bow only in in war mode form a wall of protection while the rest of us work in other words everybody doing something there's no room for doing nothing you're either building or you're fighting you're building or defending anybody with me all right and the rulers are behind all the house of judah i'm almost done 17. and listen listen they which build it on the wall and they that bare burdens with those that lead everyone listen with one of his hands wrought in the work and with the other hand held a weapon brother nick so 50 percent half of the church in defense mode protection mode the other half working but then they're not just working you know in one hand they're working on the other hand they have a weapon in the security profession they talk about soft targets and hard targets a soft target is an easy threat it's an easy place you can break it easy a heart attack is when you're barricaded you know it has an easier place to go after this place looking too tough when you looked at this group of people here it is every single man have a weapon in his hand half of them have a weapon working and the other half have more than one weapon because we send in a message this work is too important it's not stopping we could be at home but we have our weapons we could be on lockdown but this revival not stop him we could be at home but you can't take my joy we could be at home but we're not going to stop praying we will still have prayer meeting on friday we will still have live stream on sunday we're not giving up we're not turning back we're not we are getting ramped up anybody with me let me just one more time again they which build it on the wall and they that bare burdens with those that laid it every one not some not most not 99 everyone with his hands wrought in the work and with the other hand held a weapon everybody involved you cannot be part of this bride body and not have a work a responsibility a purpose there's no vocation this is not a vacation we are in the army of the lord we have a purpose a role a responsibility if in a building you're fighting even if you're building you're still fighting for the builders everyone had his sword girded by his side and so build it we're building with our sword at our side hallelujah no matter what i could build but if i need to fight i'll fight i got to run and find my sword i left it in the bedroom i left it in the kitchen no it's at the side at any point in time i could draw it if i need to any situation somebody feeling sick we can lay hands and pray we can't get to them we can pick up the phone and pray hallelujah whatever the situation we can deal with it when i'm in the road i'm in the car i'm in the house it doesn't matter sword always next to me you will never catch me undefended anybody with me that's that's us tonight huh and i said verse 19 i'm almost done and i said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people the work is great and large isn't the work we do in great and large isn't the calling that's upon us to make a bride to have a prize revival for the perfecting of the saints day without austin's main perfect isn't he worth great and large final voice to the final age the work is great and large and we are separated upon the wall one far from the other in what place thereof therefore you hear the sound of the trumpet resort you tether unto us our god shall fight first so basically nehemiah is saying is a massive work and we there's some distance between us on the wall some of us are full enough from the other and wherever you are when you hear this sunday trumpet come let us rally back together in other words just keep your ears open because we're tracking the movements of the enemy keep walking with your sword next to you but when you hear the trumpet know we into war mode and rally back and god shall fight for us verse 21 so we labored in the work friend it's a labor it's work it's work tonight is not a picnic we live in tonight you know i'm laboring you will you you are working to it's a labor prayer is a labor it's a work so we labeled in the work and half of them held the spears listen listen from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared i don't have a four hour shift is there a two hour shift can i can i get a half if i don't have working because here now i i'm not with this whole day thinking listen listen listen this is war this is soul yeah business you know i told you all some time ago earlier this year i already had in my heart desire to be in the army i always wanted to be a navy seal i didn't know the height requirement you fit this requirement but the lord happened to be another kind of seal let me talk about the kind of seal here so we labored in the work and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared listen likewise at the same time said i unto the people let everyone with his servant lodge within jerusalem so in other words bring everything you have your servants everything and that in the night there may be a god to us and labor on the day meaning we turning this thing into a 24 7 operation we're not turning down at all so listen listen listen this is the last encouragement to assume so neither i nor my brethren so nahim i say i don't know walk this road nor my servants nor the men of the god which followed me none of us cut off our clothes saving that everyone put them all for washing so you say listen we we were so alert we had to take time to go and take off clothes we'll have to change the not about the available for war trumpet sound and you there lounging in the shower 20 minutes you in the shower you there you are so you're making this is not a vacation so be ready stay ready if you stay ready you don't have to get ready anybody with me so in summary tonight as we close out this session we see the journey of a cup bearer who was so dedicated to his job as it were and it's a testimony that no matter what job you have you could be so effective in your job that you could find favor with divorce anybody with me this was a boss a king who was not christian he was not believer but nehemiah's testimony and his relationship and his honesty and his sincerity and his discernment and his wisdom as a as a cub bearer had such an impact on the king that the king was not only willing to grant his request but gave him more than he asked for how much more are working who is interested in our welfare for i know the plans i have for you he says in jeremiah plans of peace to give you an expected end not an unpredictable end not an end that you can't plan for but an expected end and here we see a man who didn't have the work experience as it were but he had a prayer life a spiritual man a man who understood the word that before he acted and he gave up examples and it would not have given every example but we see his first response i want to challenge us as church on our first response i have heard different people get feet bad feelings different sickness different and they feel too well and their first response is panic nehemiah's first response is prayer and every time did you pray did you commit to the tony lord did you did you did you commit to your lord his first response and even when he was asked the answer to the king even though he knew what he wanted he still prayed before he answered that's a lesson to us you go to the bank you go to somewhere and you you could answer but lord help me with the right words and then you begin to speak because you have a relationship you want god to help you we said it in church acknowledge him in all your ways he will direct your path that's what nehemiah was doing before he spoke he was acknowledging huh powerful he didn't want to speak without acknowledge he didn't want to speak without making sure that god was a part of that conversation and here it was he was able to articulate everything he needed do you know what you need for your next move do you know what you need to have to do the next thing in your business on your job whatever you're navigating this lock down here plan you can't do as much as you can in the road and do it plan go to paper work because god wants you to be blessed but do that sit down wait for it to come what where is your plan for god to come and bless your plan you have to have a plan for him to bless anybody with me and watch this natural hidden king not only give him everything that he needed but send security with him to give him safe passage he didn't answer it but god gave him safe passage and what did god say about you no weapon formed against you could prosper and he gave you safe passage angels and camp around you angels to protect you from every attack of the enemy including this virus this standing guard to protect your house to protect your children to protect your family anybody with me and as each challenge comes he has confidence he doesn't let words affect him there are two verbal encounters with san bala before it reached to sword and shield and the two first attacks were all verbal the power of the tongue and the attempt at words to discourage you to dissuade you to break you down to make you feel like giving up but yet still in the midst of that his first response was praying and there was prayer and more preparation and then pray and work and then sword and work and realize listen we will keep building and we will keep fighting and it closes off with him saying listen we didn't drop our guard he wasn't willing to drop a guard why this is more important than changing clothes it's more important than appearance because until the wall is up we are vulnerable this wouldn't last forever at some point in time the building of the war will be complete and we wouldn't need to do this anymore but the war will be complete and when the wall is complete the enemy cannot attack anybody with me so tonight i challenge you church close the breaches close the breaches into your home close the windows the doors of the ability of the enemy to attack your mind your heart guard your heart for out of it come the issues of life let us bow our heads for word of prayer oh gracious heavenly father we thank you tonight lord how you have placed this in scripture with so many examples too many lessons to us that in 2021 in this lockdown as it were we could get refreshed and inspired lord of how you want to develop leaders how we typed it through scripture a kingdom of priests and you challenge us in this day call us kings and priests call us leaders and leaders because kings have to lead priests have to lead we lead in our prayer life we lead in our prayer altar we lead in our jobs and our businesses we lead father because we cannot be followers because there's a god of this evil age who is leading people to hell but we want to subject ourselves as leaders under your spiritual leadership we want to subject ourselves as priests under you as our high priest we want to subject ourselves as kings under you as the king of kings and we want to mature to make the right decisions because leadership is having the confidence to make the right decisions when all hell is against us when there is pressure when there's tensions when they're stressed help us to develop our first responder ability our first response that of prayer of remembering the lord and as nehemiah challenge the people he said fear not remember the lord give us the courage to stand help us to be leaders in this world without leaders help us to be real men real women real daughters real sons give us the bonus and the courage and the confidence that comes from knowing you could take a cabera who had no experience in leadership no experience in management no experience as a general but his relationship with you and his growth and maturity under pressure develop one of the greatest leaders that the world has ever seen lord being part of the narrative of rebuilding the wall of the temple oh god the walls of jerusalem lord father may you bless your sons bless your daughters tonight father may you bless the service tomorrow night that will be streamed may you bless the prayer meeting this friday may you bless the service this sunday may you protect your people may you cover your church with your blood we live in perilous times and you told us perilous time will come but lord nothing untoward will come now your people may you cover your people may you protect your people for those that need healing may heal and rain pour out even now for our loved ones and our families lord may heal and reign may our cups run over to have an effect on those who are connected to us we commit your people into your hands we apply the blood on our houses lord we thank you for in advance lord for your protection we thank you in advance for your blessing we thank you in advance for strengthening our prayer lives for giving us a burden this narrative this story started with a burden nehemiah had a burden for the things of god a burden for the people of god a burden for jerusalem lord reignite the burden of our hearts for your people are burdened our hearts for your purpose a burden our hearts for the things of god especially now when we can't physically come together but lord nehemiah stood alone we don't know how many jews were left there in shushan but he was there in the king's palace and the burden never left him help us to stand as individuals in the king's palace in our workplaces in our families in this lockdown and still maintain the burden help us to pray and to fast and to hold on and to grow spiritually in this time we commit the church into your hands may you bless our pastor may you bless his wife may you bless the ministers the elders the deacons the trustees the sunday school the young people the caleb's lord may you lord pour out your spirit in our homes may the priest step up to the plate may the king step up to the plate lord may you be with us we commit your people into your hands in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen may the lord richie bless you tonight stay on the firing line be encouraged we love you god richly bless you good night you
