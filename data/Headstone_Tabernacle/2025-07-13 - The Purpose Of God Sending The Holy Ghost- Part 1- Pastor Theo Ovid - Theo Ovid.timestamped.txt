[17:45] Fill you with the Holy Ghost. seal you
[17:49] to the uttermost.
[17:51] Oh, lift up your hands this morning.
[17:54] Give the Lord a shout of praise. We
[17:57] praise God. Oh, for his goodness.
[18:01] Praise him for his life.
[18:04] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[18:07] Hallelujah. Let everything that had
[18:09] breath. Praise the Lord this morning.
[18:12] Let all creation cry out the name of
[18:16] Jesus. He is our redeemer. He is a king
[18:19] of all the earth. The saints shall crown
[18:22] him. King of kings, lord of lords, all
[18:27] ruler of all things. Hallelujah.
[18:30] Hallelujah. Oh, he is here this morning.
[18:34] We feel the presence of God in the
[18:36] atmosphere of God where miracles take
[18:40] place, where the sick are healed, where
[18:43] demons flee. We feel the fire of God in
[18:47] the atmosphere of God. Hallelujah.
[18:50] Hallelujah. There are angels
[18:52] [Applause]
[18:53] in this place this morning.
[18:56] Welcome to the house of the Lord. We're
[18:59] here to praise God. We're here to keep
[19:02] our motors humming.
[19:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Stay on fire for him.
[19:08] He is got right early with his promise
[19:10] this morning. He's here to meet your
[19:13] need. So, God bless you once again.
[19:16] We're so grateful for his mercy this
[19:19] morning. And as we turn our Bibles over
[19:22] to the Psalms, we want to read a psalm
[19:25] of praise this morning, as we get ready
[19:29] for service and we want to commit this
[19:31] service into the Lord in prayer as well
[19:36] after the scripture reading.
[19:39] So Psalms chapter 91
[19:43] which says, "He that dwelleth in the
[19:46] secret place of the most high shall
[19:50] abide under the shadow of the almighty.
[19:53] I will say of the Lord, he is my refuge
[19:57] and my fortress, my God, in him will I
[20:02] trust. Surely he shall deliver thee from
[20:05] the snare of the fowler, and from the
[20:08] noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee
[20:10] with his feathers, and under his wings
[20:13] shalt thou trust. His truth shall be thy
[20:17] shield and buckler. Thou shalt not be
[20:20] afraid for the terror by night, nor for
[20:22] the arrow that flyth by day, nor for the
[20:25] pestilence that walketh in darkness, nor
[20:28] for the destruction that wasteth at
[20:30] noonday. A thousand shall fall at thy
[20:33] side, and 10,000 at thy right hand, but
[20:38] it shall not come nigh thee. Only with
[20:42] thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the
[20:45] reward of the wicked, because thou hast
[20:48] made the Lord, which is my refuge, even
[20:52] the most high, thy habitation.
[20:56] May God add blessing to the reading of
[20:57] his word this morning. Why don't you
[21:00] just lift your hands and just worship
[21:01] him in your own way as we welcome the
[21:03] presence of the Lord and as we commit
[21:05] the service into the hands of the Lord.
[21:08] We ask for his presence this morning to
[21:10] fill our hearts, to fill our souls. You
[21:13] just worship him in your own way and
[21:14] just release your faith in this place
[21:17] this morning. We thank God for his
[21:19] presence. We we can't go without his
[21:22] presence this morning. And so we ask for
[21:25] him to bless us this morning. Amen.
[21:28] Almighty God, Lord, we are thankful
[21:30] today, Lord, we opened our eyes this
[21:33] morning to see your goodness, Lord, the
[21:37] light of the sun this morning coming
[21:39] through the window panes, Father, we
[21:42] know that it is a sign of your grace,
[21:44] Lord. Father, Lord, that the sun would
[21:46] rise again, Lord. Father, may the son of
[21:49] man, son of God rise this morning with
[21:51] healing in his wings this morning, Lord.
[21:54] May you arise a new in our hearts on
[21:56] this Sunday, Lord. We come to give you
[21:58] praise and honor and glory, Lord Father,
[22:01] that is due unto your name, Lord Father.
[22:04] Lord, there's not enough tongues that we
[22:05] have that we could praise you this
[22:07] morning for all that you have done for
[22:10] us, Lord Father. How you brought us
[22:12] through darkness, how you brought us
[22:14] through trials, how you brought us
[22:16] through testings, Lord. Times when we
[22:19] didn't think we would make it, but your
[22:22] hand was strong in the battle. Though we
[22:25] were weak, in your weakness, you were
[22:27] made strong this morning. We are only
[22:30] standing here this morning by the grace
[22:32] of almighty God. Nothing we did in
[22:35] ourselves. No power, no education, no
[22:39] greatness, Lord, no achievement, nothing
[22:41] we have, but in your hands we come and
[22:44] commit ourselves, oh God, the house of
[22:47] God, we give you praise this morning. We
[22:49] thank you this morning, Lord, for your
[22:52] goodness. And we just want to commit
[22:54] this service into your hands. Lord, may
[22:56] you have your way with us, Lord. Father,
[22:58] bless your people as they sing and
[23:00] worship your name, Lord. May your
[23:02] presence fall upon them, Father, and
[23:04] lift them up in a special way. Anoint
[23:06] them, inspire them, Lord, Father, today.
[23:09] Lord, may the word of God comfort and
[23:11] power, Lord. May you anoint it Aresh
[23:13] this morning, Lord. It may be, Lord, as
[23:17] bread to the eater, Lord. Father, Lord,
[23:19] as a blessing to the hearer this
[23:20] morning. We be careful to give you all
[23:23] of the praise and the honor and the
[23:24] glory. We commit this day into your
[23:27] capable hands today, Lord Jesus. We pray
[23:30] and ask it in your name. Amen and amen.
[23:34] Praise God. Do you believe it this
[23:35] morning? Hallelujah. Give the Lord a
[23:38] praise. Give the Lord thanks in
[23:41] everything. Give him thanks. Oh,

[45:19] You're powerful.
[45:20] [Music]
[45:21] Let your voice be heard.
[45:25] Change our hearts as we stand on your
[45:29] word. Holy Spirit,
[45:33] [Music]

[45:39] I trust that's your desire tonight.
[45:41] That's your prayer tonight. That the
[45:42] Holy Spirit would rain down. Praise the
[45:45] Lord. So God bless you. It's a privilege
[45:47] to be here tonight uh to be one more
[45:50] time in the presence of God and to share
[45:53] with you the word of God. Amen. Praise
[45:56] the Lord.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; So tonight we want to go to the
[45:59] scriptures. We want to read two portion
[46:00] of scriptures tonight from St. John
[46:02] chapter 14 verse 14- 26 and Luke chapter
[46:06] 16 1 verse verse 16. St. John chapter 14
[46:12] reading verse 14. If you shall ask
[46:14] anything in my name I will do it. If you
[46:16] love me, keep my commandments and I will
[46:18] pray the father. This is Jesus talking
[46:21] and he will give you another comforter.
[46:24] So referencing another comforter where
[46:26] he himself being among them, he was a
[46:28] comforter with them. But he's talking
[46:29] about another comforter. So he was the
[46:32] word and he's prophesying of the spirit.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; I shall give you another comforter that
[46:36] he may abide with you forever.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Even the spirit of truth whom the world
[46:41] cannot receive. This is not the spirit
[46:44] of error.
[46:45] It's not a spirit of lies. The spirit of
[46:46] truth and the world cannot receive
[46:48] because it seen not knoweth him. But he
[46:51] knoweth even you know him for he
[46:53] dwelleth with you shall be in you. I
[46:56] will not leave you comfortless. I will
[46:58] come to you. Yet a little while the
[47:00] world seeth you no more but you see me
[47:02] because I live you shall live also. At
[47:04] that day you shall know that I am in my
[47:07] father and he in me and I in you. He's
[47:09] saying to them you don't know that now
[47:11] but at that day you will know this.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Vers 21. He that my commandments
[47:15] and keepeth them, he that loveth me, he
[47:18] that loveth me shall be loved of my
[47:19] father and I belove him. I will manifest
[47:21] myself to him. And Jerusalem unto him,
[47:24] not his scar lord. How is it that thou
[47:26] would manifest thyself and thus not the
[47:29] world? Answer. Jesus answered and said
[47:31] unto him, if a man love me, he will keep
[47:34] my words, and my father will love him,
[47:37] and we will come unto him, and will make
[47:39] our bow with him. He that loveth me not
[47:42] giveth up my sins. And the word which
[47:44] you heard is not mine, but the father
[47:47] which sent me. These things have I
[47:49] spoken unto you being yet present with
[47:51] you. But but the comforter which is the
[47:56] Holy Ghost whom the father will send in
[47:58] my name. Send operating word whom the
[48:02] father will send in my name. He shall
[48:05] teach you all things and bring all
[48:07] things to your remembrance. was since
[48:10] that time the kingdom of God is preached
[48:13] and every man will speak to them. Take
[48:15] me out that Peter was uh responsible for
[48:18] what he shared by words to Cornelius's
[48:21] house. But Lord, he was not responsible
[48:24] for the moving of the spirit and the
[48:26] dynamic operation of the Holy Spirit
[48:28] that fell on Cornelius and the gathering
[48:31] at Cornelius home. Because the scripture
[48:34] declare why Peter yet spake these words.
[48:37] The Holy Ghost fell upon them that heard
[48:39] the word. It was such a shocking thing
[48:41] to Peter and the other Jews with him.
[48:43] They were astonished that the Holy Ghost
[48:45] itself was being poured out upon the
[48:48] Gentiles just as they had had it in the
[48:50] upper room. And it was an astonishing
[48:51] thing for them to see it. So Peter
[48:53] wasn't in charge of opening that pipe of
[48:55] the spirit. You are in charge of that,
[48:57] Lord. And we pray that you would come on
[48:59] tonight and open up in the people's
[49:02] hearts and lives right in their homes
[49:03] the fire of God, the healing virtue of
[49:06] Christ, the deliverance, Lord, the
[49:08] witness of your spirit, the power of
[49:10] God. Even right now while we are
[49:12] praying, let the dove sweep into every
[49:14] home, every heart, every life, Lord, and
[49:16] bring that victory to them, Lord. Oh
[49:18] God, we are depending on you tonight. Uh
[49:22] always will feel, Lord, but you always
[49:25] can't feel. And we believe that we're
[49:27] moving to that cycle, father, of the
[49:29] spirit uh having the preeminences of the
[49:31] spirit having the oversight for your
[49:34] deepest desire is to see the sons in
[49:37] such a position that you can say there
[49:39] is my spirit flowing freely. No hidden
[49:41] agenda, no politics, no unclean spirit,
[49:44] no crooked life, just a channel of God
[49:47] that you can flow freely. Father God,
[49:49] may you find such a a place tonight in
[49:51] our hearts where you knocked on all the
[49:53] doors and you are available to every
[49:55] crevice in our lives that with the
[49:58] freedom of spirit, Lord, the liberty and
[50:01] of God that that that the word can be
[50:03] operational tonight, Lord, in Jesus name
[50:05] we ask it. Amen and amen.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, tonight have a title, the
[50:13] purpose of God sending the Holy Ghost.
[50:16] That's the title tonight. The purpose of
[50:18] go and holy ghost and I have an
[50:20] inspiration. Every man must press.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Every man must press. I like to always
[50:27] find things that we are responsible for.
[50:29] You know like how the Bible says the
[50:31] secret thing belong unto God when things
[50:33] that are revealed belong to us. Isn't
[50:35] that right? So secrets God in charge of
[50:37] that. But what belong to us belong to us
[50:39] what have been revealed.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now uh let's let's go see what the
[50:44] Lord will do tonight.
[50:47] Now have you ever seen have you ever
[50:49] seen this? You see in our churches today
[50:52] even the groups where we have separate
[50:54] ourselves and make organization we see
[50:56] all of this. Have you seen a man here we
[50:59] go pick up a certain scripture and
[51:03] brother that man can take that scripture
[51:06] and make it live new. Make it live just
[51:09] exactly what is promising in the Bible.
[51:12] And the next man will see him do it. And
[51:15] he will come around and try to do it and
[51:17] fail. I hope you're reading now. He'll
[51:20] fail. Why? The scripture is not inspired
[51:23] to him.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; He's only trying to impersonate. He's
[51:27] trying to act like something. What?
[51:29] Watch. He said, "Now watch. But what
[51:32] about the church? What kind of Messiah
[51:33] is the church looking for today? The
[51:35] church has been crying the loudest. We
[51:37] holling about the Messiah. We are
[51:39] looking revival our time. What are they
[51:42] looking for to do it? What more do you
[51:45] want? What does the church want anyhow?
[51:48] We already cut it.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; God give it to us. It's his promise for
[51:54] this hour.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; We look in the Bible. We see it
[51:58] everywhere through the Bible. Anointed
[52:01] ones come on and make that word live
[52:04] again.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Listen to it.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Anointed ones.
[52:09] If it's not anointed, how could it
[52:12] really live?
[52:13] &gt;&gt; It will take the atmosphere, the
[52:15] presence, the power, the anointing to
[52:19] make that word live. Dry, dead, cold,
[52:22] formal. No life coming to that. It has
[52:24] to be the breath of God.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; So here it is now. Anointed ones, come
[52:29] on and make that word live again right
[52:31] in the hour for that hour. Now we have
[52:34] got the Messiah. This is him, the word.
[52:37] In the beginning was the word. The word
[52:38] was with God. The word was God. And the
[52:41] word remains God. The same yesterday,
[52:43] and forever. We are wanting the Messiah.
[52:46] And God give us the Messiah. What's the
[52:48] Messiah? His promised word for this day.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; It's just waiting for somebody with
[52:58] faith to anoint it and make it live
[53:01] again.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. So I
[53:05] want to encourage you tonight that all
[53:07] we have need of is in the message of the
[53:09] hour is in the books is in the tapes but
[53:13] it takes faith to anoint every divine
[53:15] promise and you have to claim it for
[53:17] yourself. Ain't that right? So he said
[53:19] he says no Martin Luther mechanics and
[53:22] dynamics of this day. John Wesley had
[53:24] them. Pentecostal had them of their day.
[53:27] What about our day? Yeah,
[53:29] &gt;&gt; this is another time
[53:31] &gt;&gt; the church should be fully grown now,
[53:34] ready to meet Christ with the
[53:37] manifestation of every blessing that he
[53:41] promised in the Bible, operating in that
[53:44] one great body where he promised he
[53:46] would meet the people and be worshiped
[53:48] in this great church of his.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. We
[53:52] believe that tonight that the church
[53:54] should be fully grown, ready to meet
[53:55] Christ with what? in books and tapes.
[53:57] No, with the manifestation of every
[54:00] blessing that he promised in the Bible
[54:03] operating in that one great body that he
[54:05] promised he would meet the believer, the
[54:08] people and be worshiped.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. So God's purpose of
[54:12] sending the Holy Spirit is one purpose,
[54:15] one purpose. That God himself might
[54:18] dwell in his church and continue his
[54:21] plans through the church. That's why the
[54:24] Holy Spirit told the prophet Peter the
[54:26] penant right by and through the bride
[54:28] will be fulfilled all that was promised.
[54:31] Isn't that right?
[54:32] &gt;&gt; That God was in Christ continue his
[54:34] plans through Christ out of Christ into
[54:36] the church continuing his work through
[54:38] the church. All God was he coming to
[54:41] Christ. All that Christ was he poured
[54:44] into the church. What is it? God working
[54:48] in you anywhere in the world that he
[54:51] would want to call on you, working in
[54:54] you to do his good will. Oh, we ought to
[54:56] thank God for that. Thank God the Holy
[55:00] Spirit is sent for the purpose of God
[55:02] living in his church, moving through
[55:04] each age. Isn't that right? He was
[55:07] lifted up between heaven and earth, died
[55:09] and redeemed everything and it bleeding.
[55:12] Hallelujah. He sanctified a church that
[55:15] he himself might live in. Not come to
[55:18] church. Now his blood is what sanctified
[55:21] the church because he can only come to a
[55:23] sanctified life. Oh, glory to God. And
[55:26] that's why it was so powerful. The
[55:29] testimony of Cornelius, he was just and
[55:32] devout and a man that was praying
[55:35] always. He don't know about Jesus.
[55:37] Hallelujah. You don't know what's going
[55:39] to unfold. But they God was so pleased
[55:42] with his prayer and his testimony that
[55:45] God sent visitation of an angel to tell
[55:47] him to send for Peter because Peter was
[55:49] part of this body of Christ. This
[55:51] operational functional acts this channel
[55:56] of God that life the mount of Peter. Oh
[55:59] glory to God. And Peter on new grounds
[56:02] was challenged to rise and kill and eat.
[56:05] And he was challenged to go to these
[56:06] Gentiles called to minister to the
[56:08] Gentiles. Oh, glory to God. And all
[56:11] Peter to do was to give a witness, a
[56:13] testimony by word of what happened. And
[56:16] while he was giving testimony, while he
[56:18] was speaking, while he was witnessing
[56:21] what he saw, what he experienced, the
[56:23] spirit bore witness. Oh, glory of God.
[56:26] And once more, the spirit will return
[56:28] and return and has returned to the
[56:31] witness of the Lord himself everywhere.
[56:38] My word is a blessing for you. I'm
[56:40] serving the word with signs following
[56:43] the Lord.
[56:45] Supernatural power, supernatural,
[56:48] supernatural presence. Oh, glory to God.
[56:50] People
[56:52] supernatural. But something supernatural
[56:55] has to happen to you.
[57:02] Something has to happen to you.
[57:06] is the operation of God that operated
[57:09] supernaturally
[57:10] desire
[57:12] to take
[57:14] a life God.
[57:17] Oh, hallelujah. Praise God. And he was
[57:20] lifted up in heaven, died and redeem
[57:23] everything. And indeed he sanctified a
[57:26] church that he himself might live in and
[57:30] fellowship and commune with that lost
[57:34] spot of fellowship from the garden of
[57:36] Eden where God came down in the cool of
[57:39] the evening. I can see why God leave
[57:42] these last day sons to receive the full
[57:44] revelation of the mystery of God that he
[57:47] could fully commune with them and have
[57:49] fellowship with them. What a privilege
[57:51] to be this hour. It's crazy outside
[57:53] here. It is crazy. It'll get crazy. But
[57:56] we are blessed and privileged because
[57:58] many wise men and we all could be just
[58:01] as
[58:02] Hallelujah. When the sons of God will be
[58:05] born into manifestation
[58:07] tonight. Hallelujah.
[58:09] Just think about it. And sons of God
[58:12] will be born into manifestation. Oh,
[58:15] glory to God. And he will touch the
[58:17] earth with the power and the
[58:19] supernatural presence of the Jesus
[58:21] Christ. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[58:25] [Applause]
[58:27] Because we are under.
[58:29] Hallelujah. He brought the light to us.
[58:32] Hallelujah. That we can walk in that
[58:34] light and manifest that supernatural
[58:36] light. Hallelujah. Tonight, that's the
[58:38] purpose of the Holy Ghost. is the father
[58:41] again. God the father dwelling in you,
[58:44] working out his plans to finish his plan
[58:47] of redemption, working through you,
[58:50] making you a coworker with him, giving
[58:53] you a place, giving you a part for your
[58:56] fallen lost brother. Today is not just
[58:58] to settle in church and my bets. You
[59:00] know this is giving a pack for your
[59:02] whole brother because one day the last
[59:05] name going to be called into that book
[59:07] from the book will be called and
[59:09] redeemed and that redeemer is unveiled
[59:11] all the way to charity redeemed. Then
[59:14] the book is closed but one more to be
[59:16] saved. Oh glory to God. The book is
[59:18] finished and then God to the Jews.
[59:21] Hallelujah. Praise God. Giving you a
[59:23] part for the fallen brother. Just
[59:25] imagine that we have a part still to
[59:27] play. Oh, glory to God to go after the
[59:30] lost lost after fallen. Those that
[59:35] lost the way. Oh, glory to God to go
[59:38] after come back. The spirit and the
[59:40] bride come. Oh, glory to God. The spirit
[59:43] is here and the bride is here. The
[59:46] spirit and the bride is coming. Oh,
[59:48] glory to God. Giving you a part
[59:51] with him. Giving you a place. Giving you
[59:54] a part for your foremost brother and
[59:56] sister. giving you his spirit and his
[1:00:00] love to go hunt the lost as he did in
[1:00:03] the garden of Eden. Not saying this one
[1:00:05] is shocked this one finished
[1:00:08] [Music]
[1:00:10] this one finished.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; I guess I guess when they s
[1:00:16] Christian they say finished
[1:00:20] with glory God going to do a mighty work
[1:00:23] and flip him from Saul to Paul.
[1:00:25] Hallelujah. Let the church member say
[1:00:27] what they want. God going and change
[1:00:29] that man. Oh, glory to God. Nobody
[1:00:31] didn't put your name in the book and
[1:00:33] they can't take it out. Oh, give the
[1:00:35] Lord a shout. That's why we are free
[1:00:37] this night. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:00:39] Giving you his spirit and his love to go
[1:00:43] hunt the lost as he did in the garden of
[1:00:45] Eden. Adam, Adam, where thou? That's
[1:00:48] what the Holy Ghost does to a man or
[1:00:52] woman when it strikes the heart and
[1:00:54] takes it abode. There's a thirst and
[1:00:56] hungering for lost souls. And then here
[1:01:00] we go. Then as soon as he gets his
[1:01:02] church in speaking conditions, Uhhuh.
[1:01:07] speaking conditions when you could speak
[1:01:09] and he could speak back. Then you
[1:01:11] qualify to access God. I have heard your
[1:01:14] prayer. I have heard your cry. Oh, glory
[1:01:18] to God. Speaking conditions, not a
[1:01:20] one-way thing where God talking and
[1:01:22] behind the pulpit you're hearing word,
[1:01:23] word, word. That speaking conditions is
[1:01:26] mean you're back almost like back to
[1:01:28] Eden where God could talk to you and you
[1:01:30] could talk back to him where the spirit
[1:01:32] is there. The Bible said Jesus said
[1:01:34] he'll another comforter and he will
[1:01:36] bring things to your remembrance
[1:01:38] conditions not a one-way
