[35:33] no word spoken by god is by accident
[35:36] hallelujah every seed will bring forth

[35:48] law in the sea to
[35:49] reproduce itself and to make possible
[35:52] what you didn't know was possible
[35:54] because
[35:54] there's a power in the seed and it's god
[35:57] working his way out it's like that lily
[35:59] that's pushing from under the muck and
[36:01] the maya that's going to push its way
[36:03] out
[36:03] no matter what you throw on top the lily

[2:03:20] uh from sister bernadette stirling good
[2:03:22] morning scenes please pray for my mom
[2:03:24] teresa stirling
[2:03:25] who has a blockage in the passageway
[2:03:28] leading from her brain
[2:03:29] which is causing fluid to build up in
[2:03:31] her brain this buildup has
[2:03:33] greatly affected her mobility and memory
[2:03:36] also her mood somewhat
[2:03:38] the doctor wants to do a procedure so
[2:03:40] that the fluid can flow from the brain
[2:03:41] into the body once again
[2:03:43] it must be done as soon as possible
[2:03:46] because her
[2:03:46] condition can continue to deteriorate
[2:03:50] i know that there is nothing too hard
[2:03:51] for god to do
[2:03:53] and i'm thanking him in advance for her
[2:03:55] complete healing
[2:03:57] and deliverance and also one more that
[2:04:00] was put in by my wife for
[2:04:02] a very good friend of hers she was here
[2:04:03] at our wedding on natasha charles for
[2:04:06] her husband

[2:04:14] covet 19
[2:04:15] virus and it's a very complicated
[2:04:18] situation
[2:04:20] with his pre-existing conditions and
[2:04:23] she's looking for a miracle
[2:04:24] they need a miracle in their lives so we
[2:04:27] want to remember them in prayer also and
[2:04:29] if there's anyone else this morning that
[2:04:30] you want to show by a raise of hands
[2:04:33] it could be a need for you or for
[2:04:34] someone in your heart
[2:04:36] that we could jointly approach the
[2:04:38] throne of grace this morning
[2:04:39] the bible said if two shall agree
[2:04:41] touching anything anything at all they
[2:04:43] could have what they asked for so

[2:05:24] bride and she could just speak and see
[2:05:25] it

[2:10:38] we worship you
[2:10:47] amen so just for a few announcements
[2:10:49] firstly
[2:10:50] uh voice of god recordings has made
[2:10:52] available
[2:10:54] uh the agapo tablet which
[2:10:58] uh as some of you or most of you should
[2:11:00] know
[2:11:01] has the entire message on it
[2:11:04] and it allows
[2:11:07] for you to leave listen and read
[2:11:11] uh the message and they're making it
[2:11:13] available
[2:11:16] specifically and focused on those who
[2:11:18] may not be able to purchase
[2:11:19] the agapu tablet so if
[2:11:22] you uh want to be put on that list uh
[2:11:26] you could give your name to the deacons
[2:11:28] downstairs
[2:11:30] and we would arrange to get those
[2:11:33] tablets which have
[2:11:34] uh the message on it that you could have
[2:11:37] access
[2:11:38] to the resources of the word of god the
[2:11:41] revealed word of god
[2:11:42] for this day and for this hour so um
[2:11:45] we'd have them come and
[2:11:46] do a presentation to the church as well
[2:11:48] as uh
[2:11:50] make these available and they also have
[2:11:52] a different version that's available for
[2:11:54] purchase as well so you could
[2:11:56] make it known to the deacons downstairs
[2:11:58] and we will make the
[2:11:59] necessary arrangements as quickly as
[2:12:01] possible to make this available to the
[2:12:03] church
[2:12:05] service continues on tuesday at 8pm our
[2:12:09] bible study
[2:12:10] are we looking for god to continue to
[2:12:12] minister to us from his word bible study
[2:12:14] on tuesday at 8pm
[2:12:16] uh service continues on wednesday
[2:12:18] pre-recorded
[2:12:21] it there'll be no service here at the
[2:12:23] tabernacle so it'll be a live stream
[2:12:24] service on wednesday
[2:12:26] come under great expectation in your
[2:12:28] home set aside and alter that space
[2:12:31] for god to minister to you and you'll be
[2:12:33] mean for a great blessing
[2:12:34] this wednesday night uh don't take it
[2:12:36] for granted friends
[2:12:38] the clock is ticking down there's a few
[2:12:40] seconds left and we are out of here
[2:12:42] so make it count make it matter the
[2:12:44] effort matters
[2:12:46] the activity matters the productivity
[2:12:48] matters
[2:12:49] we're redeeming that time now so bible
[2:12:52] study this tuesday series continues on
[2:12:54] wednesday live stream only
[2:12:56] and of course this friday uh our prayer
[2:12:59] meeting via zoom as well
[2:13:01] looking for god to continue that's where
[2:13:02] the stephen said it it matters
[2:13:05] and what you pray for he gave you some
[2:13:07] keys this morning
[2:13:09] hallelujah pray for divine revelation
[2:13:11] pray for this in mind
[2:13:13] you know he says anything you pray for
[2:13:14] pray for those things pray for the holy
[2:13:16] ghost pray for your children
[2:13:17] you have a reason to pray you have a
[2:13:18] reason to talk to god you have a lot to
[2:13:20] ask god for and he said
[2:13:21] in his word we have not because we asked
[2:13:23] not so what will begin to happen if we
[2:13:25] begin to ask and we ask in earnest and
[2:13:27] we ask with a purpose and we ask with a
[2:13:29] revelation of what we should be asking
[2:13:31] for what will god do for us
[2:13:33] when the revival as we know is not based
[2:13:35] on the preacher but is based in our
[2:13:37] homes in our own activities in our own
[2:13:39] effort
[2:13:40] and as we have exhorted so many times
[2:13:42] before don't let it be that the bible
[2:13:44] study and the prayer meeting and the
[2:13:45] services
[2:13:46] is your only effort you have to have
[2:13:49] that personal
[2:13:50] your personal plan your personal prayer
[2:13:52] life your personal time with the
[2:13:54] scripture your personal time with the
[2:13:56] word of god
[2:13:56] so that when you are already in the
[2:13:58] spirit and you come to a bible study
[2:14:00] or you connect to a service or you're
[2:14:02] here on a sunday
[2:14:03] then it explodes in your soul because
[2:14:05] it's already bubbling on the inside is
[2:14:07] that
[2:14:07] is that you believe that this morning
[2:14:09] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:14:12] and uh and of course if it continues
[2:14:14] this sunday uh the last sunday of this
[2:14:16] month of january
[2:14:17] it feels like very eclipse we just
[2:14:19] broken the 2021 and we're talking about
[2:14:21] the last sunday of january and before
[2:14:22] you know january is finished
[2:14:24] in february and before you know it if
[2:14:26] the lord tarries we're closing out
[2:14:27] another year
[2:14:29] i'll be one year closer one month closer
[2:14:31] one day closer to leaving here
[2:14:33] and leaving here with the devil under
[2:14:34] our feet leaving here with our family
[2:14:37] back into
[2:14:38] the position they're supposed to be and
[2:14:40] leaving here with your joy
[2:14:41] wherever you left it you're picking it
[2:14:43] back up because the joy of the lord is
[2:14:45] your strength
[2:14:46] hallelujah they hear your loss you're
[2:14:48] picking it up too
[2:14:49] hallelujah and the pain you picked up
[2:14:51] you're putting it back down
[2:14:53] hallelujah all the bad feelings that
[2:14:56] this past house
[2:14:57] would have picked up over time he's had
[2:14:58] to push it away all of a sudden you
[2:15:00] become allergic to sickness
[2:15:03] allergic to getting older because the
[2:15:05] seed in you
[2:15:06] hallelujah is an eternal seed that knows
[2:15:08] no sickness
[2:15:09] that knows no depression that comes from
[2:15:12] god and goes back to god
[2:15:13] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[2:15:15] lord maintenance team group three
