[54:19] I greet you this morning and the person
[54:22] name of Jesus Christ if you have your
[54:25] Bibles with it turn with me the one
[54:26] portion of scripture reading from the
[54:29] book of Romans chapter 8 thank you
[54:31] musicians thank you for that Anthony
[54:33] Romans eat and reading from verse 28
[54:43] rumors eat and was trendy and we know
[54:45] that all things work together for good
[54:48] to them that love God to them who are
[54:52] the called according to his purpose for
[54:56] whom he did foreknow he also did
[54:58] predestinate to be conformed to the
[55:01] image of his son that he might be the
[55:03] firstborn among many brethren moreover
[55:07] whom he did predestinate them he also
[55:09] called and whom he called them he also
[55:11] justified and whom he justified them he
[55:14] also glorified
[55:16] what shall we then sated these things if
[55:20] God be for us who can be against us he
[55:24] that spared not his own son but
[55:26] delivered him up for us all how shall he
[55:29] not with him also freely give us all
[55:31] things who shall lay anything to the
[55:34] charge of God's elect it is God that
[55:36] justified who is he that condemneth it
[55:39] is Christ that died yea rather that is
[55:42] risen again who is even at the right
[55:44] hand of God who also maketh intercession
[55:46] for us who shall separate us from the
[55:49] love of Christ shall tribulation or
[55:51] distress or persecution or famine or
[55:55] nakedness or peril or sword as it is
[55:59] written for thy sake we are killed all
[56:01] the day long we are accounted as sheep
[56:04] for the slaughter nay and all these
[56:06] things we are more than conquerors
[56:08] through him that loved us for I am
[56:11] persuaded that neither death nor life
[56:13] nor Angels nor principalities nor powers
[56:16] nor things present nor things to come
[56:19] nor height nor depth nor any other
[56:22] creature shall be able to separate us
[56:24] from the love of God which is in Christ
[56:26] Jesus our Lord
[56:28] me the Lord had a blessing to the
[56:30] reading of his word you may be seated
[56:34] amen amen
[56:37] many many many many men it is good to be
[56:40] in a house of the Lord this morning it's
[56:43] good to be in the presence of the Lord
[56:45] this morning and I'm at a great
[56:48] expectation for God to do a book we
[56:50] could even ask or even think because
[56:53] it's his word
[56:54] it's his people and it's his church it's
[56:57] his body it's his kingdom he is the boss
[57:00] he is in charge he's he's the one
[57:02] responsible he's the one moving things
[57:04] around he's the one shifting things
[57:06] around for his purpose to be
[57:08] accomplished she's the one moving things
[57:10] into position when you don't understand
[57:13] why you're being moved he's the one
[57:14] doing the movement put the things in
[57:16] place for his coming he's good evenings
[57:19] in place for his work to be made
[57:21] manifest and when he has put word out he
[57:24] will do everything to make sure that
[57:26] wood comes to pass so there's no reason
[57:29] to be worried this morning there's no
[57:31] reason to be depressed this morning we
[57:33] only have a reason to smile this morning
[57:35] we only have a reason to be happy this
[57:37] morning we only have a reason to be
[57:39] excited this morning because he foreknew
[57:42] you and because he foreknew you and
[57:44] because he foreknew me he could call you
[57:46] and he could call me and because he
[57:49] called us already justified Oh as if we
[57:52] never did it in the first place book
[57:54] when he looked up your story this
[57:57] morning there's nothing negative about
[57:59] you there's there's nothing anybody
[58:01] could say about you
[58:02] he's not interested in hearing what the
[58:05] devil has to say about you because he
[58:07] already for knew you he knew what
[58:09] happened to you before the devil to
[58:11] bring the report because he foreknew you
[58:14] and because people knew you he could
[58:16] call you and because they come he can
[58:18] they come out from the Baptist Church
[58:20] come up from the message church come on
[58:22] from the Methodist Church yes I said
[58:25] come up from the message come on a
[58:26] church into a body into my party enter
[58:30] his body he is the one who is doing the
[58:32] calling he is not calling a group he is
[58:35] not calling a church he's are calling a
[58:37] method He is calling individuals who
[58:40] will respond to that call
[58:42] can the church famous oh you may be
[58:47] seated
[58:48] I'm just testing the temperature in the
[58:50] house this morning I'm under great
[58:53] expectation
[58:54] I told but over in the office we already
[58:57] in the convention this is this is the
[58:59] beginning round of convention so the
[59:02] devil is already bad we already stirring
[59:04] things up what's happening the weather
[59:06] patterns it's not the meteorologist who
[59:10] reporting on the weather telling you
[59:12] what to do is because of the bride
[59:14] the weather is responding to our action
[59:16] because my Bible tells me the whole
[59:19] creation is groaning and travailing the
[59:22] whole world he is moving the trees are
[59:25] moving the animals are moving because
[59:28] some sons of korah
[59:29] coming into position and when these sons
[59:32] come as a position there has to be a son
[59:34] that these functions week two there has
[59:36] to be a storm that these funds should
[59:39] speak to it has to be a blood that these
[59:41] songs could speak to that has to be
[59:44] crippled that these tonsils picture
[59:46] there must be blind eyes that these
[59:49] songs could speak to there must be back
[59:52] cider that these tongues could speak to
[59:54] and yet thought not also there will be
[59:57] some sickness that some daughters of it
[59:59] will speak to God will raise up sons and
[1:00:02] daughters in this last age when all hell
[1:00:06] is on the earth all heaven will be on
[1:00:09] the earth also build inner people it
[1:00:12] seal in a bribe nail in an elective and
[1:00:15] the church payment has don't have an act
[1:00:19] allow in here this morning
[1:00:22] hey man you may be seated
[1:00:25] so I want to let go on it while I'll let
[1:00:29] the thing that's on let go and let God
[1:00:30] have his way because he is the director
[1:00:33] of the symphony he is the director of
[1:00:36] York Estrin we could have our own
[1:00:38] thoughts or own ideas our own feelings
[1:00:41] own emotions our own perspectives but
[1:00:44] all of that has to die to what he wants
[1:00:46] to achieve and what he wants to
[1:00:48] accomplish and I was so blessed last
[1:00:50] week with the message the key message to
[1:00:54] point to the convention that perova
[1:00:57] speech appreciate a pastor he is a holy
[1:01:01] convocation to key into the meeting and
[1:01:05] after today's service there's just the
[1:01:08] service of Thursday and next Sunday and
[1:01:10] we are into the convention and among the
[1:01:12] great expectation and biroba didn't know
[1:01:16] what was in my heart to speak but he
[1:01:18] said something powerful last week that
[1:01:21] that holy convocation the calls that our
[1:01:24] holy convocation is not just a call it's
[1:01:25] a it's a summons and in the legal sense
[1:01:30] of summons means you don't have an
[1:01:32] option means you have to responded
[1:01:35] Lazarus didn't have an option he was
[1:01:37] dead and he had to respond when Jesus a
[1:01:40] Lazarus come forth even his sadness
[1:01:44] couldn't stop the summons
[1:01:47] [Applause]
[1:01:50] and if God has to allow the situation in
[1:01:53] your life that your deadness would exist
[1:01:57] that when the summons come Lazarus come
[1:01:59] forth there's no room to complain
[1:02:02] there's no room to answer back there's
[1:02:04] no room even at home there's no room
[1:02:07] even how shall this be when that word
[1:02:10] came Lazarus come forth
[1:02:12] Lazarus started moving because it was a
[1:02:15] power that was activated when that voice
[1:02:17] was spoken you may be seated so I have a
[1:02:24] simple message this morning and really
[1:02:26] in my heart it is not so much in my
[1:02:29] heart of preaching message I really
[1:02:31] wanted a really kind of conversation
[1:02:33] with the church because as because our
[1:02:36] last week service there's a lot of stuff
[1:02:39] that gold in the preparation or
[1:02:41] preparing for anything and it is
[1:02:45] important as you prepare for anything be
[1:02:47] it your job is whatever you're doing and
[1:02:50] in our specific it is the convention
[1:02:52] that we don't miss the most important
[1:02:54] preparation that is required for the
[1:02:57] greatest blessing that we are supposed
[1:02:58] to get so I took for a title this
[1:03:01] morning responding to the call and as a
[1:03:05] subject the approach to God and as an
[1:03:08] inspiration God demands respects I'll
[1:03:15] see it again responding to the call as a
[1:03:18] subject the approach to God and as an
[1:03:21] inspiration God demands respects because
[1:03:24] the call goes out and there's an
[1:03:26] opportunity to respond to the call and
[1:03:28] many people they respond to the calls of
[1:03:31] different invitation the reason they
[1:03:33] respond to the call to be in surgery
[1:03:35] respond but but if you respond and your
[1:03:37] approach is not right and God cannot
[1:03:39] bless you and if you don't have the
[1:03:42] right amount of respect and the right
[1:03:44] approach to God there is no blessing to
[1:03:46] come so I want to start and we're going
[1:03:49] to share something so let's just let go
[1:03:51] this morning and let go so the world is
[1:03:54] preparing for funeral service
[1:03:56] isn't that right the world is preparing
[1:03:59] for the end of all things but there are
[1:04:01] some people I believe who are preparing
[1:04:02] for resurrection they're preparing for
[1:04:05] rapture they're preparing for the
[1:04:07] wedding support preparing for
[1:04:09] conventions and special meetings there
[1:04:11] are people are preparing because Jesus
[1:04:13] is coming for his bride and by feet this
[1:04:16] morning I'm declaring that the final
[1:04:18] call is on and there will be some people
[1:04:21] who are responded to this final call
[1:04:23] they will they will not let their jobs
[1:04:25] keep them from this call it was they
[1:04:27] were not met worldly desires keep them
[1:04:29] from this call if you will not let the
[1:04:31] pain that you're going to keep it from
[1:04:32] the call because they understand that
[1:04:34] responding to the call will be the
[1:04:37] solution to their sickness responding to
[1:04:40] the call will be the financial
[1:04:41] breakthrough they're looking for
[1:04:43] responding to the call will be the
[1:04:45] deliverance from the sin that night that
[1:04:47] they may be going through that
[1:04:48] responding to the call will be
[1:04:51] deliverance for their children
[1:04:52] responding to the call will be a
[1:04:55] spiritual breakthrough after me and my
[1:04:57] house we will serve the Lord so I'm on
[1:05:00] the expectation to believe us to respond
[1:05:04] to the call not the cause come to church
[1:05:07] but the cause in a resurrection the
[1:05:09] cause of the holy ghost calls it a
[1:05:11] wedding support the cause of the jubilee
[1:05:14] of the seven seals can the church same
[1:05:17] end so we have a purpose this morning we
[1:05:21] have a destination this morning our
[1:05:23] preparation for the convention is
[1:05:25] because God has made a promise it is
[1:05:28] because of his promise we can get ready
[1:05:30] it is because there's a prophecy hanging
[1:05:33] over us we could get ready without a
[1:05:36] promise without a prophecy all our labor
[1:05:39] is in vain all our effort is in Vienna
[1:05:42] all our work is in vain and God has
[1:05:45] never made a prophecy yet that has not
[1:05:48] come to pass god I've never made a
[1:05:50] promise yet that has not come to pass or
[1:05:52] if he promised a revival it's got to
[1:05:55] come to pass in fact with a Branham says
[1:05:57] if God promised a revival
[1:06:00] let's make ready fast
[1:06:01] and we have the climate for this island
[1:06:04] we have the climate for this children
[1:06:06] you have the climate for your house look
[1:06:09] you must claim it for your life yes you
[1:06:12] can have a personal revival you have to
[1:06:15] have your revival to tea
[1:06:17] forget about who's next to you the tea
[1:06:19] should be your revival the revival is
[1:06:22] supposed to be in you the ministers that
[1:06:25] are common I'm not bringing the revival
[1:06:27] because we're the random pop up the
[1:06:29] preacher could never bring the revival
[1:06:31] the revival has to come from the people
[1:06:33] I want to see something the video this
[1:06:36] morning who will respond to the call
[1:06:39] it's the old fashioned called
[1:06:41] if the Holy Ghost cause it's the drop
[1:06:44] everything and come call and the church
[1:06:46] payment
[1:06:48] [Applause]
[1:06:54] everybody with me this morning now God
[1:06:59] cannot you see whenever the prophet but
[1:07:02] the word cannot you know we describe God
[1:07:07] an infinite all-powerful
[1:07:09] but when you go deep into the scripture
[1:07:12] with a kindly there are limitations to
[1:07:14] God because they are certainly that God
[1:07:17] cannot do he is all-powerful but God
[1:07:23] also has his own limitations because God
[1:07:26] cannot like God cannot make a mistake he
[1:07:35] cannot speak and his words don't come to
[1:07:37] earth he is all-powerful but even God
[1:07:40] has his limits somebody help me somebody
[1:07:43] help in do we have Christians in the
[1:07:46] house this morning so when God made your
[1:07:49] family is coming he cannot tell it's got
[1:07:53] to happen and when God promised up seven
[1:07:56] thundering rival and Trinity it's got to
[1:07:59] happen it's got to happen it's got to
[1:08:02] happen
[1:08:05] and my hallelujah oh you may be seated
[1:08:12] to listen to the prophets God cannot
[1:08:16] make a decision today and tomorrow come
[1:08:20] back and make a better decision every
[1:08:24] decision he makes his public so when God
[1:08:27] put your name in the book and he
[1:08:29] foreknew you and he called you and it's
[1:08:33] dividing glorify you what the date and
[1:08:37] time you will get the Holy Ghost yes not
[1:08:39] that the decision oh just wait for it
[1:08:42] just wait for it it's gonna happen
[1:08:46] touch your neighbor and tell them I'm
[1:08:49] gonna be filled touch your other
[1:08:58] neighbor and say you are looking at the
[1:09:00] revival
[1:09:03] [Music]
[1:09:11] and just to confuse the devil tell your
[1:09:16] neighbor
[1:09:16] I am the revival
[1:09:19] [Applause]
[1:09:28] somebody semen somebody's Damon
[1:09:32] somebody's so hallelujah you may be
[1:09:36] seated
[1:09:36] the devil is afraid of when you speak up
[1:09:41] you notice a every time the devil open
[1:09:44] is multiplying every time you open your
[1:09:46] mouth you have power to change your word
[1:09:49] that's why the Bible says let the weak
[1:09:52] say let the port
[1:09:58] hey and when you speak it Lord
[1:10:02] begin to change the economy begins to
[1:10:06] change the stock market have to change
[1:10:08] why because it's power locked up inside
[1:10:11] of you and the church ceiling and the
[1:10:20] Bible said I am the Lord and I change
[1:10:23] not so if you speaking in the positivity
[1:10:27] what you want to happen what will change
[1:10:30] in your house when you begin to see my
[1:10:32] son he's coming back and you could smile
[1:10:35] with your sean's and the confidence it
[1:10:38] doesn't matter what he's doing right now
[1:10:40] to be he is coming back my daughter is
[1:10:43] coming back man my eyesight is coming
[1:10:46] back my blood pressure is getting back
[1:10:48] to normal my sugar level is yes I
[1:10:52] brought in my body got to go because it
[1:10:54] was not so from the beginning when God
[1:10:57] created me he made me perfect ah hey why
[1:11:02] have any Christians in the house it's
[1:11:04] gone
[1:11:06] you may be seated that's power in your
[1:11:10] speech that's power in your recipients
[1:11:13] power with how you say what you say you
[1:11:16] may be seated
[1:11:17] so don't tell the doctor my bakhtin and
[1:11:20] north of your is the devil's battery in
[1:11:22] ten o'clock for him it's my I'd ripeness
[1:11:27] acronym is love you are writing the
[1:11:29] devil's and right is going back to him
[1:11:31] because this body is predestinated to be
[1:11:35] changed from what house say mortality
[1:11:40] you may be seated in the house this
[1:11:42] morning with a random said how can you
[1:11:45] have seen for the rapture if you don't
[1:11:47] have people divine healing
[1:11:49] it means divine healing will become
[1:11:51] ordinary to the elect lady it will
[1:11:54] become normal to us to have somebody
[1:11:56] after testimony
[1:12:00] oh he's good in here this morning
[1:12:05] it feels good how did they feel in the
[1:12:07] front how does it feel in the back I
[1:12:09] love the ceiling the technicians good
[1:12:13] you want no room for the devil he can't
[1:12:16] hide anywhere we want to squeeze them
[1:12:18] out that's the kind of trip you want to
[1:12:20] have penetrates amen so God cannot make
[1:12:25] a decision today and tomorrow come back
[1:12:27] and make a better decision because the
[1:12:30] third decision is perfect he never has
[1:12:32] to change that powerful never has to
[1:12:35] change it so therefore we can rest upon
[1:12:38] whatever God says with the venom sending
[1:12:43] a message modern events I made clear by
[1:12:45] prophecy it has always been God's Way
[1:12:49] the let his people know what's going to
[1:12:53] happen by the power before he doesn't
[1:12:58] let everybody know but God let his
[1:13:00] people know what's going to happen
[1:13:04] before it happens he lets a
[1:13:06] predestinated people a call our people
[1:13:09] our chosen people God's people are never
[1:13:11] surprised that's what America you'll
[1:13:16] hear walls and ruins of walls where the
[1:13:18] end is not yet don't get moved by that
[1:13:20] don't be surprised with that we got a
[1:13:25] rain can fall in the days of Noah corner
[1:13:27] to let Noah what was going on
[1:13:28] nor was the surprise no one knew how the
[1:13:32] story was going to end before restoring
[1:13:36] no one knew the rain is going to come
[1:13:37] before the turnip is over even in
[1:13:40] bondage this knew that with a mighty
[1:13:44] hand they were going to be delivered
[1:13:48] but some days in your trial you could
[1:13:51] forget the promise you can forget the
[1:13:54] prophecy under stress and the pains of
[1:13:57] life and the struggles of life
[1:13:59] you can forget what God said about you
[1:14:01] so that's why but the Baron said that
[1:14:04] when the enemy comes a letter for the
[1:14:06] Spirit will raise a pendant by taking
[1:14:09] the same word that was spoken in the
[1:14:12] fifties talking in the 60s the same word
[1:14:15] from Malachi for that you observe all
[1:14:18] these years and make it more positive
[1:14:20] make it real to you I think you're
[1:14:23] hearing for the first time it becomes
[1:14:26] TSD it becomes tangible that you're
[1:14:29] going to have a revival that you're
[1:14:31] going to have a breakthrough that you're
[1:14:33] going to get the Holy Ghost you may be
[1:14:37] seated
[1:14:38] I want you to understand that for the
[1:14:40] tune of Israel for example after years
[1:14:43] are being beaten by the taskmaster
[1:14:45] please trust me believers law school
[1:14:49] they lost hope because the grandfather
[1:14:53] told him about this revival this
[1:14:55] deliverer the grandfather went on the
[1:14:59] father tell them about it and he went on
[1:15:01] until 400 years in bondage that
[1:15:03] generation say it no longer see anything
[1:15:05] come in I take them children you cannot
[1:15:08] fit to know but I don't know if it won't
[1:15:09] happen until Moses came in town we never
[1:15:14] arrived in town I mean what that love
[1:15:18] about God going to make anything easy
[1:15:20] because it's not his way as I shared
[1:15:23] with them in Nigeria the Bible said
[1:15:25] Jesus learned obedience by the thing
[1:15:28] that he suffered the Bible doesn't tell
[1:15:31] us what he suffered but he suffered
[1:15:34] enough
[1:15:37] to become obedient let me do that again
[1:15:41] there is no description with the candy
[1:15:44] of what Jesus suffered but whenever he
[1:15:47] suffered was enough to make Jesus
[1:15:50] obedience so the Prophet are in this way
[1:15:55] you could come the easy way or you could
[1:15:59] come the hard way but because it's a
[1:16:01] summons for the Benjamin there is no
[1:16:04] choice you have to come so if I have two
[1:16:07] choices learning of the easy way or the
[1:16:09] hard way
[1:16:10] Lord let me get it easier way but some
[1:16:15] through the waters sound through them
[1:16:17] come true great trial but all through
[1:16:21] the blood so the current Church it's
[1:16:24] going to be alright tip storm this too
[1:16:28] will pass this trial will have that seen
[1:16:31] in your body will pass the financial
[1:16:34] hardship will pass the test path because
[1:16:37] testing on the beginning and can see has
[1:16:39] an ending in at the beginning and pain
[1:16:42] as an ending army at the beginning and
[1:16:45] heart we have an ending for you you will
[1:16:48] before the beginning so you can
[1:16:49] withstand the pressure of time and the
[1:16:52] limitations of time because you are
[1:16:54] great opportunities you can withstand
[1:16:57] anything oh my god
[1:17:00] [Applause]
[1:17:04] you may be seated what the teller
[1:17:08] doesn't understand friends is you are
[1:17:09] older than you look
[1:17:12] [Music]
[1:17:17] before the devil one you will happy this
[1:17:20] morning before the Sun was put into
[1:17:23] space you existed in the fat part of God
[1:17:27] mind you are older and you look your age
[1:17:31] is all of your father
[1:17:37] [Applause]
[1:17:39] so let me ask you this you ever did it
[1:17:42] what new devil what new demon what new
[1:17:46] spirit the Challenger also like mine
[1:17:49] because before it was a muna wasn't ah I
[1:17:53] was an accident
[1:17:54] Sodom in his very DNA he released me
[1:17:58] before he released the Sun and the moon
[1:18:01] [Applause]
[1:18:06] you may be seated
[1:18:09] that's why the devil is so afraid of you
[1:18:13] coming to a full realization partial
[1:18:16] realization is ok you know but full
[1:18:18] realization is troubling to the devil
[1:18:20] because when you come to a full
[1:18:22] realization of who you are who God is
[1:18:24] who the devil is then it gives you
[1:18:27] confidence it gives you authority to
[1:18:28] speak a certain way my wing could be
[1:18:31] broken but it doesn't change the fact
[1:18:32] that I'm an eagle and you guys are the
[1:18:34] only animal that exists that the renewed
[1:18:37] es strength when it gets crusty and it
[1:18:39] gets blurry and you can't see your way
[1:18:41] because they've been coming for so long
[1:18:43] you couldn't beat your head against a
[1:18:45] rock he can head against a rock and the
[1:18:49] skin is beginning to fall off and you
[1:18:51] renew your strength I de Gotha a my
[1:18:54] treason to anybody this morning
[1:18:56] [Applause]
[1:19:00] you may be seated so before the rain is
[1:19:04] falling the days of Noah God had to let
[1:19:06] no one know what was going to happen or
[1:19:09] was not surprised Noah knew how the
[1:19:12] story was going to end and today we know
[1:19:16] how our story is going to end and the
[1:19:21] devil is the one going to be in for the
[1:19:23] surprise because part of his ending is
[1:19:26] hidden under the Seventh Seal and as we
[1:19:30] know the seven CEOs fear in silence
[1:19:33] every other seal there was some symbol
[1:19:36] expressed that the devil to try to has
[1:19:38] been abandoned said impersonate but the
[1:19:40] seventh CD could not impersonate has no
[1:19:42] pious sister even in pacifically he
[1:19:44] doesn't know what the original looks
[1:19:46] like to come up with a counterfeit but
[1:19:48] the original blueprint from under the
[1:19:50] Seventh Seal God hid it didn't write it
[1:19:53] because he waited for this day and this
[1:19:56] age was songs to come into position
[1:19:58] because only mature sons could eat this
[1:20:00] food from under the seventh seal it
[1:20:02] couldn't be released a day or time
[1:20:03] earlier than it should be released
[1:20:05] within the day and time when there was
[1:20:07] sons mature enough to handle it there'll
[1:20:09] be a power connected to the third pole
[1:20:11] that would bring all the weaker ones up
[1:20:13] those that are we can see there's power
[1:20:15] under that seventh seal four units
[1:20:17] there's food under there even when
[1:20:20] you're untended listen there are many
[1:20:23] things I don't understand
[1:20:24] ab c--'s it cakes that are so good I
[1:20:27] don't want to tell how to make it but
[1:20:30] the kick is good
[1:20:30] all ice it was heated you know and you
[1:20:33] hidden manna under the 7cu
[1:20:35] I don't need to know how it was mrs.
[1:20:36] Adams even or eating good it's tasting
[1:20:40] good its nutrients with a journey that's
[1:20:43] why the properties you don't need to
[1:20:45] know the mechanics you need to know the
[1:20:46] dynamics you need to be so surrendered
[1:20:48] to God and respond to this call with the
[1:20:52] right attitude and the right approach
[1:20:54] because somewhere along the journey
[1:20:57] people have missed at the right mental
[1:21:00] attitude towards every divine promise of
[1:21:03] God is what it takes to bring it to pass
[1:21:08] it leaves the right attitude above
[1:21:12] attendance a service it plays the right
[1:21:17] attitude towards even interaction with
[1:21:19] individuals
[1:21:21] there's something about a right attitude
[1:21:23] and this wrong attitude and as we
[1:21:26] prepare for this convention my burden in
[1:21:29] my heart but you see you have the right
[1:21:31] attitude and you can only have the right
[1:21:34] attitude towards something if you
[1:21:37] understand the importance of that
[1:21:39] something and when you truly understand
[1:21:44] the importance of something is ready to
[1:21:46] truly give that something the respect
[1:21:48] that it deserves that's why the
[1:21:51] propagating we all God respects and but
[1:21:55] the Branham actually said how you
[1:21:57] respect God is how you also respect the
[1:22:00] servants you respect for one another
[1:22:03] because God demands respect so as a
[1:22:07] church as the people in the videos
[1:22:09] getting ready to respond to this call
[1:22:11] the right wing because many people came
[1:22:14] into the message and God's prophet would
[1:22:18] say that he was something go to the
[1:22:20] mountains because he saw what people
[1:22:23] really will under the 16 elements what
[1:22:28] they were thinking what they were
[1:22:29] feeling their emotions and behind the
[1:22:31] god bless you good to see you what their
[1:22:33] heart is seeing is completely different
[1:22:35] it's as if they're speaking in tongues
[1:22:37] speaking of completely different
[1:22:40] language and the Prophet have to see all
[1:22:42] of that and still treat each one look
[1:22:46] how Jesus treated Judas you can even
[1:22:49] tell you say whatever you do do quickly
[1:22:52] the broader story was going at more food
[1:22:55] and jesus knew what he was going to do
[1:22:59] how we also be more like Jesus
[1:23:05] friends God isn't coming to a group he's
[1:23:10] not coming to a convention he's coming
[1:23:12] to individuals that I responded to his
[1:23:16] call that have nothing to do with
[1:23:18] anybody else has does newt your husband
[1:23:22] your wife your neighbor your son teaches
[1:23:23] you cancer it has to do with you
[1:23:26] recognizing who you are and what is
[1:23:28] required for this the chemistry of semen
[1:23:33] so the devil friends only has a short
[1:23:36] time to try to stop you to try to stop
[1:23:39] you but it is impossible to stop you
[1:23:40] because it is going to be a resurrection
[1:23:42] is going to be a rapture there is going
[1:23:45] to be a wedding supper you are going to
[1:23:47] receive the Holy Ghost you are going to
[1:23:49] be adopted you are going to be perfect
[1:23:51] you will have power to speak for your
[1:23:53] children you are power to speak for your
[1:23:55] house if you to create that power will
[1:23:58] be there but the random taught us when
[1:24:00] that time comes you won't even have to
[1:24:02] say in Jesus name but you will speak
[1:24:04] because I boys will be in you the power
[1:24:06] I was in Christ will be in you can the
[1:24:08] church say Amen listen to the Prophet
[1:24:12] and a message of blessing probably I
[1:24:14] love this because the demands and what
[1:24:16] we need today is not social regeneration
[1:24:18] it's not intellectual talks what we need
[1:24:22] to be is an all fashion God sent blood
[1:24:25] infusion from heaven the corn plasters
[1:24:28] won't do no good we are
[1:24:30] anemia we need a blood transfusion we
[1:24:33] need to come back to the old fashioned
[1:24:36] gospel that calls out repentance before
[1:24:39] God I'm not a dry eye hand shook
[1:24:43] profession but a godsend Holy Ghost
[1:24:45] revival with the possession of the
[1:24:48] cleansing of the blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:24:51] Christ into every human heart we need a
[1:24:54] revival to start in the children and
[1:24:57] sweep the nation across we're dive will
[1:25:00] perish we are gone without that type of
[1:25:02] revival all can the church same
[1:25:05] and I want to read it one more time
[1:25:08] because this is what we needed so what
[1:25:10] I'm looking for I don't know about you
[1:25:12] but it's what I'm looking for what we
[1:25:14] need I will do what I need to do is not
[1:25:16] social regeneration this is a purpose
[1:25:18] word it's not going to let your talks a
[1:25:21] little explanation needle eyes what we
[1:25:24] need to do is that all flashin blood
[1:25:26] transfusion from heaven for the brand if
[1:25:29] you take a life of junk dealers and put
[1:25:33] it into somebody they will act like John
[1:25:34] Dillinger anybody know the code so if
[1:25:36] you take the blood of Jesus and you take
[1:25:38] Isaac blood out and give me a blood
[1:25:41] transfusion because the life is in the
[1:25:44] blood that's what the devil didn't
[1:25:46] understand there was life in the Plus
[1:25:48] but their parents another chemistry but
[1:25:50] this God is different when this clerk
[1:25:53] comes in to you it changes your
[1:25:55] molecules it changes your ass on this
[1:25:57] changes your nature that's the blood I'm
[1:26:00] talking about what we need is a blood
[1:26:03] transfusion is anybody in the house this
[1:26:05] morning that needs a blood transfusion
[1:26:08] all mass unholy loads of passion
[1:26:13] cleanses all passion power god help us
[1:26:17] this morning you may be seated
[1:26:19] I'm friends that blood cannot be in you
[1:26:24] and your body could be sick no no no no
[1:26:26] no no no no because that what has power
[1:26:29] yes one drop of that blood has power
[1:26:32] that kind sin and sickness take away in
[1:26:36] we need a blood transfusion a blood
[1:26:38] transfusion will take away that right
[1:26:40] yes yes yes a blood transfusion take
[1:26:42] away lost them that's what the Holy
[1:26:44] Ghost is given for is the same thing we
[1:26:46] are talking about that's what the holy
[1:26:48] convocation is that's what plasticity
[1:26:51] means it's a blood transfusion it's a
[1:26:55] holy God himself
[1:26:57] taking his place not just in your soul
[1:27:02] but in every fiber every cell of your
[1:27:05] body or your feet won't go away
[1:27:07] shouldn't go your eyes wouldn't go any
[1:27:10] sudden go your hands won't go where a
[1:27:12] sudden go because it's all over you it's
[1:27:15] not just a temporary experience but it's
[1:27:18] a change of nature it's a change of air
[1:27:21] atop it's a change of behavior it's a
[1:27:24] change of conduct oh god help us this
[1:27:31] morning god help us this morning what
[1:27:36] can wash away my sins nothing but the
[1:27:39] blood of Jesus there are people in the
[1:27:41] message that have not met the flood of
[1:27:43] season they're people in church this
[1:27:45] morning who don't know their power in
[1:27:48] the blood of Jesus or there's still
[1:27:51] power
[1:27:51] there's wonder-working power yes power
[1:27:54] the devil is afraid of this blood of but
[1:27:57] when I see the Blood I pass over you the
[1:28:00] blood is our way of escape that's power
[1:28:02] in the blood of Jesus this morning
[1:28:08] we are me Mia our blood is weak the
[1:28:12] weakness in our blood is what keeps us
[1:28:14] from our full potential the weakness in
[1:28:17] our blood that's breaking connection
[1:28:19] that Adam had that's what a blood
[1:28:21] transfusion
[1:28:22] it's what those things out it
[1:28:24] reestablishes our connection with deity
[1:28:26] it's because publishers are connected
[1:28:29] with our original creation it
[1:28:31] established the connection with your
[1:28:32] theophany because there's a sin barrier
[1:28:35] that's presenting perfect communication
[1:28:37] but when that blood transfusion takes
[1:28:39] place now you can walk in the presence
[1:28:42] of God because sin can enter into that
[1:28:45] throne room no God help was a spawning
[1:28:51] in that throne of God is holy he is holy
[1:28:56] he is holy hallelujah he is holy he is
[1:29:00] righteous he is God all by himself and
[1:29:03] your best effort can put you in his
[1:29:05] presence your best efforts cannot meet
[1:29:08] what the standard is but get that blood
[1:29:10] transfusion then you can look at you and
[1:29:12] say yes you are my son you are mature
[1:29:15] you have coming to your book and this
[1:29:17] one Candace you hmm let me nail this
[1:29:20] down that's what we need today is that
[1:29:22] social regeneration it's not
[1:29:24] intellectual talks it's not disgusting
[1:29:27] quotes back and forth no what we need is
[1:29:29] an old-fashioned God's then blood
[1:29:31] transfusion from heaven the corn
[1:29:35] plasters won't do no good you know what
[1:29:37] the point class the corn party is
[1:29:39] talking about is trying to cover up your
[1:29:41] problem you cannot plaster here you pop
[1:29:44] plaster here you have this problem for
[1:29:46] that plaster here and in the windows
[1:29:47] plasters don't solve the root cause of
[1:29:49] the problem look at it said to somebody
[1:29:52] you could go to the mountain and
[1:29:53] meditate for 20 years look at the stone
[1:29:56] on a tree for 20 years put you back in
[1:29:58] the civilization you still have to deal
[1:30:00] with the lust of the eyes you love to
[1:30:01] the flesh the pride of life because
[1:30:03] staring at a tree or a stone or whatever
[1:30:05] it is doesn't take away that nature
[1:30:07] that's verse that in your soul God is
[1:30:10] the one who put that there because the
[1:30:12] Sun is designed to help you let's
[1:30:14] understand this when your body needs
[1:30:17] water
[1:30:17] that
[1:30:18] is to save your life how would you know
[1:30:21] you are dehydrated unless you feel
[1:30:23] thirsty that first exists to save your
[1:30:30] life
[1:30:30] it's because when your body is
[1:30:32] dehydrated it sends a signal to your
[1:30:34] bridge ba and the water and then that
[1:30:38] person's activity I need what you could
[1:30:40] drink juice and the breathing ethylene
[1:30:42] water that tells it to protect you but
[1:30:47] like many of us when you need water you
[1:30:49] drink intrusion against something so
[1:30:51] much sugar but isn't any water and God
[1:30:55] places earth in your soul for the Holy
[1:30:57] Ghost itself people turn a filler we're
[1:31:00] committed sure champion religious and
[1:31:02] peace but that's not the whole egos just
[1:31:04] it's not the Holy Ghost be in spiritual
[1:31:06] is not the Holy Ghost being in the
[1:31:08] messages of the Holy Ghost axis in your
[1:31:11] soul into the Holy Ghost which is God's
[1:31:14] own life to be inside of you and the
[1:31:17] church team
[1:31:20] Oh hallelujah let me move along I've
[1:31:28] quite a few things here but you're gonna
[1:31:31] let go this morning and let God have his
[1:31:32] way as we get ready to respond to the
[1:31:36] call with the right attitude now let me
[1:31:41] skip this year from a message the
[1:31:44] approach to God but the random said God
[1:31:45] has a way of approach you know if you're
[1:31:49] going to visit a king there's a way you
[1:31:51] approach a king some time ago if we have
[1:31:55] an answer and we said that when the King
[1:31:58] sat on the throne if anybody approached
[1:32:00] without being cause the king had to
[1:32:03] extend his scepter if he did not you
[1:32:05] were killed so there's a way of a
[1:32:09] approach but the round set is a way to
[1:32:11] approach all things there's a way it's
[1:32:14] approach God and if we don't know the
[1:32:16] approach to God will never listen to the
[1:32:18] Prophet now this is not church pastor
[1:32:21] messages listeners there is a way to
[1:32:23] approach all things and there's a way to
[1:32:26] approach God there are people in church
[1:32:30] I know I was into my wife they want him
[1:32:32] Prince the pastor they will bypass
[1:32:37] deacons elders together here in with the
[1:32:40] pastor because it wanted any pastors
[1:32:42] good books
[1:32:44] that's human behavior but listen what a
[1:32:47] prophetess or but it's not about
[1:32:49] personal this is there's a way to
[1:32:51] approach God ilysm if we don't know the
[1:32:56] approach to God we'll never be able to
[1:32:59] get an audience with God now what's the
[1:33:04] sense of coming to service being in a
[1:33:07] message and you never get an audience
[1:33:09] with God because I surely can solve your
[1:33:13] problems
[1:33:13] the pastor cannot solve your problems
[1:33:16] only God could solve your problems our
[1:33:19] responsibility is to make sure you
[1:33:22] understand you have to have the right
[1:33:24] approach
[1:33:26] so good and when you break God's rules
[1:33:29] and you do not direct approach then all
[1:33:32] of your blessings are cut off some of
[1:33:36] you will not be financially blessed
[1:33:38] because you are operating under a
[1:33:40] different law what works for the world
[1:33:43] cannot work for you because you are a
[1:33:45] different covenant so what they can get
[1:33:48] away with you cannot because you are
[1:33:50] under a different law and God has a
[1:33:53] different expectation of you anybody in
[1:33:58] the house this morning listen to the
[1:34:03] prophets in our course you just don't
[1:34:07] walk up and the judgment in Spanish he
[1:34:10] hey judge I want to talk to you a little
[1:34:13] bit somebody would throw you out of the
[1:34:17] courtroom lock you up for this orderly
[1:34:20] conduct that's the profit see there's a
[1:34:25] way you have to approach the judge and
[1:34:27] we must find the way of approach to the
[1:34:30] great divine judge God Himself now
[1:34:35] listen to the prophets understand why
[1:34:36] it's important because a lot of people
[1:34:38] who claim a lot of things and it's not a
[1:34:41] problem to claim in the prophetic but
[1:34:44] when you claim as if it's evident in the
[1:34:46] reality it actually is a word that is
[1:34:48] called illusion disillusion
[1:34:58] understand the difference renders one in
[1:35:00] same interpreting I am going to be an
[1:35:02] adopted son I'm going to be a manifested
[1:35:05] son that's my promise that's my
[1:35:08] inheritance I'm speaking it I'm coming
[1:35:09] that's your right to do so but you have
[1:35:12] to know when you make a claim I am
[1:35:14] something and you know that they are
[1:35:17] skeletons in your closet that's given a
[1:35:20] different story when you go into the
[1:35:27] presence of Almighty God he sees all
[1:35:30] things north all things and you need to
[1:35:33] be honest when you come to God and
[1:35:36] that's why I say all the time you don't
[1:35:38] come to church with the pretense if you
[1:35:40] know you need to be at the altar and as
[1:35:42] a nautical you should be running so fast
[1:35:44] the Deacons will be wondering where
[1:35:46] you're really going because you know you
[1:35:48] need help because in our human condition
[1:35:53] we have our of these we have our down
[1:35:56] days we have our days when we on top the
[1:35:58] mountain where these young in the valley
[1:35:59] God doesn't impress when you put it on
[1:36:01] your best face or your best message feet
[1:36:04] so your best Church face what God wants
[1:36:07] to see is your your best your honors DP
[1:36:10] approach to God because that approach to
[1:36:13] God now means you're coming humble you
[1:36:16] come and meet you being sincere it be
[1:36:18] honest the Lord I need help
[1:36:21] when you have tried all of your ways and
[1:36:24] you're ready to give up and let go and
[1:36:27] let God have his way am i reaching
[1:36:30] anybody because in my heart God knows
[1:36:36] that in the services that are coming up
[1:36:38] I want you to get the full benefit of
[1:36:41] the word that will be spoken upon your
[1:36:44] life that you can go into action I
[1:36:46] believe that in this convention we will
[1:36:48] see the sick healed I believe in this
[1:36:51] convention that the young people who
[1:36:53] will be delivered from all kinds of
[1:36:55] manner of conditions I believe that the
[1:36:58] young people filled with a baptism of
[1:37:00] the Holy Ghost
[1:37:02] but we must have the right attitude we
[1:37:05] must have the right approach we must
[1:37:07] have respect for God but the venom sin
[1:37:20] now when man sinned back in the
[1:37:22] beginning in the Garden of Eden he
[1:37:24] separated himself and severed himself
[1:37:28] from all approach to God so the sin that
[1:37:35] hidden is what brought that connection
[1:37:37] and destroyed that natural approach that
[1:37:42] Adam would have had to commune with God
[1:37:44] and Goro's come to becoming the cool of
[1:37:45] the evening to fellowship with adam no
[1:37:48] adam has to find a way and over the
[1:37:52] power phrase but brother branham said me
[1:37:54] see if i can find it quickly skip down
[1:37:58] here
[1:38:02] the venom says a lot in this message and
[1:38:05] I encourage you to read it but I said so
[1:38:07] just polishing and joining children and
[1:38:09] reading a whole lot and knowing a lot of
[1:38:10] books on orders and so forth
[1:38:12] doesn't mean that you're convicted
[1:38:13] because you have an intellectual mind
[1:38:15] that makes you have a mental conception
[1:38:18] that there's a god somewhere he said
[1:38:19] still you're not a Christian yet until
[1:38:22] actually you become personal in contact
[1:38:25] with Christ and that contact with Christ
[1:38:29] is dependent on your approach that chain
[1:38:31] is your heart and meet you then you
[1:38:34] become God's child and all things is
[1:38:36] passed away and all things become new
[1:38:38] again and but Abraham said it's not God
[1:38:43] it's unmanned ever Colin Gordon oh no
[1:38:45] today is the same thing today that man
[1:38:48] cannot come to Christ except God calls
[1:38:51] em first see his making if you ever have
[1:38:54] any nature any thought of anything
[1:38:56] listen carefully young people if you
[1:38:58] ever had any nature any thoughts of
[1:39:01] anything of coming to God God is dealing
[1:39:04] with you
[1:39:06] because that desire to even come here
[1:39:09] God has to put it this so the fact that
[1:39:13] you are in the house of God this morning
[1:39:15] it means God is dealing with you and if
[1:39:19] God is dealing with you this morning how
[1:39:22] far will you respond to that call
[1:39:24] because jesus said no man could come to
[1:39:27] the Father or can come to me except
[1:39:30] through crisis that right the Holy
[1:39:32] Spirit has to call us first or we'll
[1:39:34] never think nothing of it it will just
[1:39:37] be no the way that God made for Adam to
[1:39:42] approach now watch Adam made himself an
[1:39:44] approach and this is what I want to
[1:39:45] touch on briefly here you see now I've
[1:39:48] got to go out and meet good so this is
[1:39:50] what Adam thought so he made himself an
[1:39:52] apron or fig leaves that cover up Hashim
[1:39:55] because he know he couldn't go to go
[1:39:57] under the condition he was in and we
[1:39:59] found out I'm a better Branson he forgot
[1:40:01] God refused that approach so I want to
[1:40:05] say this morning friends you cannot come
[1:40:08] up with your own approach so go to
[1:40:11] Gordon a copy but among that have his
[1:40:15] approach but a George have his approach
[1:40:17] but a general have his approach with a
[1:40:19] Raymond of his approach there has to be
[1:40:21] one approach to boy so he made himself
[1:40:25] an apron of fig leaves the cover of his
[1:40:27] team and he founded a chord refuse that
[1:40:30] approach and today listen to the Prophet
[1:40:35] smooth my spot today if man thinks no
[1:40:38] I'll help mrs. Jones over here she's a
[1:40:40] widow woman she needs some coal I'll
[1:40:42] give it a red cross or some charity
[1:40:45] other my abundance our joint church that
[1:40:47] you are making yourself an approach that
[1:40:49] God will refuse there's only one
[1:40:53] approach now God refused Adams approach
[1:40:56] and then God went and made an approach
[1:40:59] for Adam he made an approach to himself
[1:41:02] and by doing that he slid some sheep or
[1:41:05] something and give them some skins and
[1:41:06] should a blood brought the first
[1:41:09] approach to the world to call person for
[1:41:12] without the shedding of blood there is
[1:41:14] no remission of sins that's right only
[1:41:17] lud can meet the week I'm God providing
[1:41:20] an approach therefore Adam in the Garden
[1:41:22] of Eden that's true the shedding of the
[1:41:24] blood of the innocents appropriate
[1:41:27] approach to him and Adam could once walk
[1:41:29] come through the shed blood of the Lamb
[1:41:31] - the approach to toxicities again with
[1:41:35] God through the blood through the
[1:41:36] approach that's God provided for him
[1:41:39] that was God's first method of approach
[1:41:42] to himself with the people through the
[1:41:44] shed blood can the church say Amen no
[1:41:49] we're not going to get too much in there
[1:41:51] because really is of consciousness that
[1:41:53] I'm trying to see the church reach a
[1:41:55] level of reverence and respect because
[1:41:58] back in the days of the tearing of
[1:42:00] Israel the high priests would have to go
[1:42:03] make sacrifice and kill a lamb once a
[1:42:06] year for the people and they had to be a
[1:42:08] certain reverence a certain approach it
[1:42:11] couldn't be our going in because God end
[1:42:14] up getting so upset with the casual
[1:42:16] nature with people offering sacrifices
[1:42:19] and it became so traditional that it
[1:42:22] honors literally kill something for me
[1:42:25] tuna it became normal
[1:42:28] it became ordinary and they lost the
[1:42:31] sincerity they lost the reverence they
[1:42:34] lost the respects it became a routine it
[1:42:38] became a ritual they begin to take it
[1:42:41] for granted it became normal
[1:42:43] it became ordinary it became something
[1:42:46] to do and that's what I want to see in
[1:42:49] your heart to search your heart this
[1:42:50] morning that every service for you
[1:42:52] should be approached with the same type
[1:42:54] of reverence and respect because every
[1:42:57] service the blood is being applied over
[1:43:00] your life every time the word is spoken
[1:43:03] from the pulpit is blood covering you
[1:43:08] this war is blood this one is power
[1:43:11] that's what is life can the church same
[1:43:15] Oh hallelujah are you getting it
[1:43:19] something this morning so the call has
[1:43:21] gone out and we must have the right
[1:43:23] approach to God with our attitude with
[1:43:27] our prayer life with how we see God with
[1:43:31] our attitude to one another and I share
[1:43:33] with the church in our closing comments
[1:43:35] last week about the five pillars of
[1:43:37] respect and with the Branham speaks on
[1:43:39] it I don't never get to the course today
[1:43:41] but about respect for God
[1:43:43] it starts with respect for God because
[1:43:45] if you respect Gandhi will approach his
[1:43:47] house a certain way you will approach
[1:43:50] his silver in the silicon way you will
[1:43:53] approach one another a certain way
[1:43:54] even your knife you will approach the
[1:43:57] situation that your body is a temple of
[1:44:02] the Holy Ghost are you giving your body
[1:44:05] to respect are you living a life that
[1:44:09] the Holy Ghost will want to comment do
[1:44:11] you respect God enough to understand it
[1:44:12] if it shows you that you don't belong to
[1:44:15] yourself your bodies that you owned your
[1:44:19] hands are not your own your feet and not
[1:44:22] your own so how dare you carry God's
[1:44:24] body where should not be because he paid
[1:44:29] for you on Calvary with blood he
[1:44:31] purchased your salvation he purchased
[1:44:34] your Redemption he made a way for you
[1:44:36] how could you throw it back in God's
[1:44:38] peace by taking what he people I'm doing
[1:44:41] what you want with it
[1:44:42] God forgive us this morning for not
[1:44:47] loving him as much as he loved us for
[1:44:51] not appreciating what he did for us that
[1:44:53] they could be a way for us to have an
[1:44:54] approach to him to be able to speak to
[1:44:58] him face to face
[1:44:59] oh how I want to see him to look upon
[1:45:02] his face as you tired of just coming to
[1:45:06] church and you want to see God and see
[1:45:09] the reality but a random set of the
[1:45:11] Living God can we check our approach
[1:45:14] this morning can we become a church
[1:45:16] built on respects respect for God
[1:45:20] respect for his service respect for one
[1:45:22] he said last week but the Branum taught
[1:45:25] us if you don't respect the man respect
[1:45:26] the office you'll because you don't know
[1:45:29] what the manners going through don't
[1:45:30] know what the person next to you is
[1:45:32] going through but if you live with
[1:45:33] respect them but the benefit is that is
[1:45:35] respect for people I love
[1:45:36] it's just trapping everybody the garbage
[1:45:38] man respect for the neighbor because
[1:45:40] cause demands respect we we owe him
[1:45:43] respect his kingdom is built on respect
[1:45:46] can the church say men and in this
[1:45:53] country in particular we are very
[1:45:55] disrespectful country I have seen and
[1:46:00] I'm travel to countries where the
[1:46:02] culture the people they are far more
[1:46:03] respectful in their natures respectful
[1:46:07] you see a line up here they all line up
[1:46:08] here you tell she means line up here you
[1:46:10] see five lines
[1:46:20] and that's my brother Bannerman let's
[1:46:21] see message I believe he said you know
[1:46:23] what he said he has traveled also and
[1:46:25] he's seen the same Holy Ghost the people
[1:46:27] who didn't know the right and on the
[1:46:28] left and where the Holy Ones come upon
[1:46:29] them they act the same way it doesn't
[1:46:32] matter what country they came from so it
[1:46:35] means that happens people in Trinidad
[1:46:37] I'm preaching into the church now god
[1:46:38] bless you those are the internet if
[1:46:39] people in shouldn't have tell me they
[1:46:41] have the Holy Ghost and they have no
[1:46:42] respect then dies not you do because the
[1:46:45] Holy Ghost brings humility the only war
[1:46:48] brings respect we wanna go swings love
[1:46:50] one for another not just one for another
[1:46:52] but equal to love your enemy so you can
[1:46:54] love me too that's what the Holy Ghost
[1:46:56] says can I get a witness in the house
[1:46:59] [Applause]
[1:47:04] the Holy Ghost brings one consistent
[1:47:07] behavior because it's the spirit from
[1:47:09] another dimension from a different world
[1:47:12] is not tied to your nationality or your
[1:47:14] race or how you grew up almost money I
[1:47:16] have the Holy Ghost has one behavior
[1:47:18] it's fully it has one behavior is
[1:47:21] respectful it has one behavior it's
[1:47:23] honest it has one behavior it wants to
[1:47:26] please God
[1:47:28] that's the Holy Ghost that's why the
[1:47:36] property if you want to get the Holy
[1:47:37] Ghost spend time with people who have
[1:47:39] the Holy Ghost if you want to attract
[1:47:42] the Holy Ghost and we preach it the Holy
[1:47:44] Ghost is like a dove it's preach right
[1:47:46] and the dog clone it is another lamb
[1:47:49] because that lamb spirit is what
[1:47:51] attracted of the dr. Lanning or no lion
[1:47:54] or ball no ox but that lamb spirit that
[1:47:58] meek spirits a lot of other purchases
[1:48:01] like a type of a butterflies it comes in
[1:48:04] gently and address on you but if you a
[1:48:07] cop it's gonna fly away so you want to
[1:48:09] be a sweet gentle humble spirit that's
[1:48:11] what God is looking for you're not drunk
[1:48:14] today not worried if he could take care
[1:48:17] of the birds and the bees he could Tiki
[1:48:19] of you there's no worrying there's no
[1:48:21] being upset is not being angry and
[1:48:26] you want to attract the holy laws we
[1:48:29] know I didn't cook it and go and put on
[1:48:31] loudspeaker brothers be where they are
[1:48:34] there's no I Quinn cook peace always
[1:48:40] humble be there when I say that and God
[1:48:43] met him and walking only meet you and in
[1:48:46] your eyes version if Peter was there all
[1:48:48] your wrongs we gotta wait in the tall to
[1:48:51] get any right spirit there's something
[1:48:54] to be said about being in the right
[1:48:55] spirit you mean the right crew even
[1:48:58] Jesus let us spend time praying because
[1:49:00] it brought an atmosphere when you talk
[1:49:01] to God can the church seaman is anybody
[1:49:03] here this morning so like I said this
[1:49:08] morning is not as much of preaching as
[1:49:10] having a conversation about your
[1:49:12] approach to God you can't have a court
[1:49:18] case and short on your own time you can
[1:49:23] have a court case and you dress how you
[1:49:25] wanna say well your honor this is how
[1:49:28] listen I leave my house so every day
[1:49:30] teachers don't want to hear that there's
[1:49:34] our order years ago some of the older
[1:49:36] brothers we know where there was a
[1:49:37] brother who had a court matter and went
[1:49:43] in the court in the message and wild
[1:49:47] judges in the courtroom he lifted hands
[1:49:51] as the Lord gory were the only true
[1:49:53] judge in the courtroom
[1:49:58] [Applause]
[1:50:00] and the judge waited until he finished
[1:50:02] and then it judge did what he had to do
[1:50:04] because in his courtroom he is like God
[1:50:07] in his courtroom and that's why
[1:50:10] scripture through history that white wig
[1:50:12] that the judges wore they were actually
[1:50:15] representing the judgment seat of God
[1:50:17] because God is the judge so how could
[1:50:21] you come to the house of God when the
[1:50:24] judge is watching every move you make
[1:50:27] and he send out a call because you
[1:50:30] couldn't come unless he call we read the
[1:50:32] court that if there is any desire in
[1:50:35] your heart to come to church to come to
[1:50:37] the words agree the Bible is because God
[1:50:39] please something in it if there was
[1:50:42] nothing please in there you would be
[1:50:43] drunk somewhere doing some craziness
[1:50:45] somewhere else doing whatever you wanted
[1:50:46] but the fact that you actually responded
[1:50:49] no requires an approach approach that is
[1:50:54] peace and respect so that approach would
[1:50:57] define how you dress that approach would
[1:51:02] define how you walk that approach to God
[1:51:06] would define what time you come to
[1:51:08] church that approach with the final you
[1:51:12] live and how you go to work in the
[1:51:14] morning because you are no longer living
[1:51:16] for yourself because you responded to
[1:51:19] the call you are no part of the economy
[1:51:21] of God
[1:51:22] and the balance that is reset because
[1:51:25] advertisement border so God has you in
[1:51:28] your company in your school in your
[1:51:30] neighborhood as a display of his glory
[1:51:33] as it is free of his grief as it is play
[1:51:37] of his mercy as a lighthouse in the
[1:51:40] darkness that even though it's that
[1:51:43] there will be light in the evening time
[1:51:45] because there's some individuals who are
[1:51:48] responded to the call with the right
[1:51:51] approach the right attitude
[1:51:54] [Applause]
[1:51:57] so this morning we're dealing with the
[1:52:00] right approach it would be strange and
[1:52:03] I'm sincere again there is a call that
[1:52:07] goes out to elect that you can only
[1:52:10] respond to if God please the desire in
[1:52:12] you to respond but even though people
[1:52:15] respond and they show up and they take
[1:52:17] up a seat in church there's an approach
[1:52:21] to taking it to the next level because
[1:52:25] that call is also looking to the unseen
[1:52:29] because you don't know where you want to
[1:52:31] go you don't know where this journey
[1:52:33] will take you but you are responding to
[1:52:35] a call but the one thing we know is how
[1:52:38] to approach we are brought through the
[1:52:41] blood we approach with humility and as
[1:52:44] we're balancing if there's a question in
[1:52:46] your heart about something leave it
[1:52:48] alone protect yourself because you're in
[1:52:53] sponding to our cause in a resurrection
[1:52:55] you're responding to the cause of the
[1:52:57] rapture and your life definition of what
[1:53:00] makes you operate is not a different a
[1:53:03] different rule book young people are you
[1:53:07] with me
[1:53:08] so I'm going to say it again because I
[1:53:10] want it to stick and I know after
[1:53:12] service we're gonna have some comments
[1:53:13] on it but people do wear things when it
[1:53:16] comes to conventions and meetings and
[1:53:17] services kind of fancy new hairstyles
[1:53:31] interesting outfits
[1:53:35] I'm just leave it like that
[1:53:45] is that your approach to God who are you
[1:53:48] approaches who you're trying to impress
[1:53:54] are you trying to impress man or good
[1:53:57] I need young people in here even if your
[1:54:01] parents won't tell you something and
[1:54:02] it's shame on your parent if they're
[1:54:03] doing because it means you're weak
[1:54:07] because even if you turn on activate
[1:54:09] it's still better to tell them the truth
[1:54:10] and let the truth hang over them we have
[1:54:15] in church this morning
[1:54:18] Babel T in the lattice chiral ruler
[1:54:21] Arizona talk about turning the script
[1:54:23] upside down and the disrespect the young
[1:54:29] people have to their parents God will
[1:54:30] judge that because the Bible has audio
[1:54:36] modern your father that is neither
[1:54:38] belong
[1:54:39] so disrespecting a parent is the fastest
[1:54:43] way to cut your life short the only
[1:54:46] command with the pump I don't care how
[1:54:48] old you are
[1:54:48] it doesn't matter what they do your
[1:54:50] parents deserve respect there's a new
[1:54:56] trend that exists where people discuss
[1:55:01] who is the man of the house because it
[1:55:06] is said in some relationships the woman
[1:55:07] might be more dominant and the man might
[1:55:09] be quieter
[1:55:11] anyway not talking about it was not true
[1:55:14] from the beginning
[1:55:16] be that as it may it doesn't matter if
[1:55:19] the money nose is quiet he still
[1:55:21] deserves respect because you still
[1:55:22] priests of the house God did not place
[1:55:24] that responsibility on the woman oh we
[1:55:29] we we we gonna get some feedback on this
[1:55:32] one but it is the truth only the truth
[1:55:38] will set us free you know
[1:55:41] and the approach to God and the approach
[1:55:44] must be built on respects
[1:55:46] how could you approach God listening to
[1:55:49] worldly music how could you approach God
[1:55:53] when you want to live different in the
[1:55:56] world to accommodate your approach to
[1:56:00] the world you have approach to your boss
[1:56:03] you have an approach to your co-workers
[1:56:04] and you want have your own approach to
[1:56:06] God your life has to be an approach
[1:56:10] because God is everywhere looking at
[1:56:13] everything the testimony you have is not
[1:56:17] supposed to be a church that's the money
[1:56:18] it must be a life kept the money they
[1:56:21] took not that they have been with Jesus
[1:56:25] can we keep it real this morning I guess
[1:56:29] I'm not preaching now this is having a
[1:56:31] conversation because if you don't
[1:56:34] approach the next few days of your life
[1:56:37] right you could be cut off because the
[1:56:41] Bible says he kita Lord while he may be
[1:56:44] found call upon him while he is named so
[1:56:48] godly is a time limit on Redemption and
[1:56:51] that's front seat it's not a mercy seat
[1:56:56] it's a seat of judgment and because
[1:56:59] there's blood under seat it's a mercy
[1:57:02] seat but it's really a judgment seat and
[1:57:05] judgment is hanging over the years these
[1:57:08] floods and this happening it's only
[1:57:10] gonna get worse one day there'll be such
[1:57:12] a flood that people won't be able to
[1:57:14] move around quick I prophesied wars and
[1:57:19] rumors of wars that come and that's
[1:57:21] happening the judgment is on the earth
[1:57:24] there's no time to quito for what the
[1:57:27] world has there's no time for this to be
[1:57:31] off ritual or formality this has to be
[1:57:36] your reality this has to be your

[1:59:51] God there are things of God have the
[1:59:53] right attitude to the servants of God to
[1:59:56] the past but the elders of the minister
[1:59:58] density - everyone has the right
[2:00:00] attitude not right nobody off because
[2:00:04] God is still working on you and he's
[2:00:06] still working on me Oh hallelujah
[2:00:11] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I'm
[2:00:14] getting ready to wind down oh my my my
[2:00:19] my mind I'm gonna skip through here mmm
[2:00:24] Oh glory glory glory glory hallelujah
[2:00:29] hallelujah hallelujah friend I believe
[2:00:35] the season has changed a change had to
[2:00:38] come for the disciples to go into the
[2:00:41] upper room they were not in the upper
[2:00:44] room and under the best of circumstances
[2:00:46] they were actually hiding and living in
[2:00:49] fear but they were right where God
[2:00:51] wanted them they had been rejected they
[2:00:55] were being ridiculed they were being
[2:00:57] persecuted but they were right where God
[2:00:59] wanted them and we have to be the
[2:01:02] reproach of this message we have to be
[2:01:05] at a reproach of our testimony that
[2:01:08] there will be a revival
[2:01:09] they are those that would have us
[2:01:11] believe the revival is already finished
[2:01:13] their doors I believe this message is
[2:01:15] just about getting ready so I don't do
[2:01:17] what because there's no burden there's
[2:01:20] no zeal there's no try there's no cry
[2:01:22] it there's no sign there's all worship
[2:01:25] but that's not our testimony friends we
[2:01:28] are on the expectation and really the
[2:01:30] promise of God until we fear come to
[2:01:33] pass we have lost too many young people
[2:01:35] and as I said in Nigeria we will not be
[2:01:38] silent we will break our silence and we
[2:01:42] will call for fire we will break our
[2:01:44] silence and we will call for charity we
[2:01:47] will break our silence and not sit and
[2:01:50] wait for something to happen but we are
[2:01:52] going to cause something to happen
[2:01:54] we are going to cause something to
[2:01:56] happen with our prayer we will cause
[2:01:58] some of the album with our worship we
[2:02:01] will cause something to happen with our
[2:02:02] spying on crime despite our child
[2:02:06] we all have child but that doesn't
[2:02:08] change the fact that God is still on the
[2:02:10] throne and he is still about to pour all
[2:02:12] the Holy Ghost waiting for individuals
[2:02:15] to approach him the right way and say
[2:02:18] Lord you made a promise of snow bring
[2:02:20] the promise of passes can the church
[2:02:22] amen
[2:02:23] Oh hallelujah are you free this morning
[2:02:28] and who the son of man set free is free
[2:02:30] indeed so it doesn't matter how your
[2:02:32] yesterday was how your past was that
[2:02:35] here we have a fresh opportunity every
[2:02:38] time the Sun rises in the morning it's a
[2:02:40] sign of a new day of a new chance
[2:02:43] it's a span of the resurrection that
[2:02:45] yesterday is over your past is over as
[2:02:48] they have since become an intensity and
[2:02:52] then this time that we have we have the
[2:02:54] opportunity to pull down charity we have
[2:02:57] the opportunity to make something happen
[2:03:00] we have the opportunity to catch a
[2:03:02] vision and the track team is for
[2:03:06] hallelujah mind you may be seated
[2:03:10] so friends just to nail it down there's
[2:03:15] a corner goes out and only those who
[2:03:17] have that feed that Jim who is born you
[2:03:21] can respond to our call but their
[2:03:23] response has to be with the right
[2:03:24] attitude so when God called Abraham gave
[2:03:27] a ham said yes sir he left his family he
[2:03:30] responded to his call he
[2:03:32] his family and he left the header city
[2:03:35] whose maker and below is God he didn't
[2:03:38] know where he was going he didn't know
[2:03:39] what Tony was going to live him he
[2:03:41] didn't know what house you're gonna have
[2:03:42] he didn't know what tires gonna thrive
[2:03:44] he didn't know what chop he was going to
[2:03:46] have but he was responding to the call
[2:03:48] and that's a piece we ought to have as
[2:03:49] believers
[2:03:50] I don't know what house I'm gonna live
[2:03:52] him I don't know what Tom would've tried
[2:03:53] but I'm responding to the call because
[2:03:56] they've caught call you he's more than
[2:03:58] able to take care of you if he picked
[2:04:00] you he's gonna make sure I bring you to
[2:04:02] your end that he plans for you don't
[2:04:05] disappear don't try to figure it out
[2:04:08] just keep on walking just keep on
[2:04:10] following because he is the one who's
[2:04:12] leading he said I'll never leave you
[2:04:15] that alone should be comfort that I'll
[2:04:17] never forsake you are to even look as if
[2:04:20] you are all alone here there you may not
[2:04:23] see him but he's there because he can
[2:04:26] alive he said I will never leave you
[2:04:29] I'll never forsake you so when you
[2:04:31] respond to the call he himself listen
[2:04:34] you may be seated
[2:04:36] listen friends the Bible says angels and
[2:04:39] camp around all that fear him I'm not
[2:04:42] even talking about that because Jesus
[2:04:45] said I will never leave you I will never
[2:04:49] take you so they are angels who are tend
[2:04:52] to protect you
[2:04:53] but the Lord Himself he is also with you
[2:04:56] because he is a comforter he is the guy
[2:04:59] he is the way he is the truth he is the
[2:05:02] life he is the light he is the way make
[2:05:05] up so every step that you take a picture
[2:05:08] the order by God because you're not
[2:05:10] responding to your own call you are
[2:05:12] responding to his calls and his call is
[2:05:14] a bright dog it's a resurrection call
[2:05:17] it's a cause of the rapture it's a
[2:05:19] quarter a wedding supper it's a course
[2:05:21] in a resurrection
[2:05:23] my and we look to the unseen listen when
[2:05:28] a man once catches the vision brother
[2:05:31] branham said and looking at your team of
[2:05:33] the invisible God
[2:05:34] I know he's always present that's what
[2:05:37] we're talking about now listen when a
[2:05:39] man recision to get ready one catches
[2:05:41] that vision of the invisible God and
[2:05:44] know that he's always present listen
[2:05:47] this summer that stabilizes that man
[2:05:49] sinking it stabilizes his actions and in
[2:05:54] the time of distress and trouble it will
[2:05:57] still make him look upward and above the
[2:06:00] things that are happening around him
[2:06:01] because he is looking at the unseen yet
[2:06:04] by promise now Abraham not ordinary
[2:06:08] speedy unseen the reason he believed it
[2:06:11] was because God said it and if we be
[2:06:14] dead in Christ we are Abraham's seed and
[2:06:17] it's a spirit that was in Christ wells
[2:06:19] in us it does the same thing it takes
[2:06:22] every divine promise of God that's in
[2:06:25] the Bible and calls it present tense and
[2:06:27] read itself right there and the church
[2:06:29] say Amen
[2:06:30] looking at the unseen mine II I'm get
[2:06:36] ready to close up T boom on the balance
[2:06:46] table there's the Living God and when we
[2:06:48] lose our disbelief and I will unbelief
[2:06:50] in him and past that place that the
[2:06:52] world is seeing that these are burglars
[2:06:54] past it makes you chic oh there's no
[2:06:56] such thing as the baptism of the holy
[2:06:58] ghost
[2:06:58] it makes you wonder but if you just look
[2:07:00] at the unseen to the God who promises
[2:07:02] for the promise is unto you and your
[2:07:05] children to them that is afar off even
[2:07:07] as many as the Lord our God shall call
[2:07:09] if you look to the blessed word that
[2:07:11] said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[2:07:12] today and forever turn your heads
[2:07:15] towards that and press on until you pass
[2:07:18] that vibration pass the unbelief
[2:07:20] barriers and the sin barriers and all
[2:07:23] the barriers that seems to hinder you
[2:07:25] then you will slide three in the face of
[2:07:27] God knowing that all things are possible
[2:07:30] then there is no limit they see hardly
[2:07:33] to the plane that will go if the
[2:07:35] no limit to the speed of play will goal
[2:07:37] there's no limit to the blessing that
[2:07:39] God will pour down upon a believer that
[2:07:42] will believe and the church CMM some
[2:07:45] speaking to believers this morning
[2:07:47] because when abandoned waters God could
[2:07:49] only prove his word by believers so God
[2:07:53] has to have some believers believing his
[2:07:56] word and because they believe they get
[2:07:58] into action because they responded a
[2:08:01] call and that call comes at the sound of
[2:08:04] a trumpet the truly trumpet and when
[2:08:08] that song comes as a jubilee trumpet all
[2:08:10] the teams around you have to be broken
[2:08:13] and the chains around you will begin to
[2:08:16] fall off and as a change again the fall
[2:08:18] off you be going to get lighter and
[2:08:20] lighter and your couldn't begin to go
[2:08:22] away and when your pledges begin to go
[2:08:24] away because God said it my yoke is easy
[2:08:27] and my burden is light it's getting
[2:08:29] ready for a meeting in the air that you
[2:08:32] become so like one of these days you'll
[2:08:34] get so light a rapture it's going to go
[2:08:36] and the rapture is going to take place
[2:08:37] but I always believe in my heart before
[2:08:40] we need this please we are not going to
[2:08:42] leave here merely making it we're not
[2:08:44] going to leave here ple hanging on we're
[2:08:46] gonna leave it with a shout we're gonna
[2:08:48] leave you jumping we're gonna leave yet
[2:08:50] handsome because of families have been
[2:08:52] delivered we're gonna leave knowing that
[2:08:54] the revival of we preach about has come
[2:08:57] to pass we're going to leave with such
[2:08:59] joy because not only will respond to the
[2:09:02] call but God Himself will answer and if
[2:09:05] we avoid a trumpet I will call out
[2:09:07] because the voice of God is a trumpet
[2:09:09] the voice recordings under the core
[2:09:12] voice of war was flash and we external
[2:09:14] eyesand Mina Lord richly bless you
