I want to read from Psalms 18 1 to 6 I'm looking there when one at 13 Psalms 18 and this is uh this is David the servant of the Lord will speak into unto the Lord the words of this song in the deed of the Lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul and he said it is David I will love thee O Lord my strengths the Lord is my rock and my Fortress this is Psalms 18. was true the Lord is my rock watch how David is personalizing it what shall David identifying himself right in all these precious promises and identification of who God is to him the Lord is my rock and my Fortress and my delivery my God my strength in whom I will trust my bakla and the Horn of my salvation and my high tower this tree I will call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praised no he is delivered from his enemies like yeah are we saying this I will call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praying so shall I deceived from my enemies the Sorrows of death Compass me and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid the Sorrows of Hell come past me about the snares of death prevented me in my distress I called upon the Lord and Cried unto my God he heard my voice out of his Temple and My Cry came before him even under his ears I like this this particular verse is not just talking to God or crying to God but he's singing you know what my words reach God's ears in other words he heard me or he heard My Cry Luke Chapter 11 verse 1. Luke 11 from verse one and it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased so Jesus was a Praying Soul a Praying person when he ceased one of the disciples said unto him Lord teach us to pray as John also taught to disciples and he said unto them When you pray not if but when see Our Father which art of him Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done as in heaven so in Earth give us day by day or Daily Bread and forgive us our sins for we also forgive everyone that is indebted to us and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil and he said unto them which of you shall have a friend and shall go unto him at midnight and say friend lend me three laws for a friend of mine in his journey has come to me and I have nothing to set before me and he from within shall understand said trouble me not the door is now shut my chair and I with me in bed I will I cannot rise and give thee I see unto you though you will not arise and give it because he's his friend yet because of his opportunity he will rise and give him as many as he needed and I see unto you ask shall be giving you seek and you shall find knock shall be open unto you for everyone that asketh receive it either she could find it unto him that knock it it shall be open this is for someone that come down to if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father will you give him a stone if he asks a fish will he if our fish give him a serpent or if he shall ask an egg will he offer them a Scorpio if he then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children or much more shall the heavenly father give the Holy Spirit and then that ask him give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him and tonight I have a little title I want to give this in my distress teach me how to pray and you'll hear this is the pet of the Prophet as he shared all we should pray and how we should talk to Gordon but the client shared with me and I said I'll share it in the primiton I'll do it today distress distressed is subject to Great strain or difficulties that may be your position tonight you're in distress to cause to worry or be troubled to afflict with great pain anxiety or Soul trouble worry bother distress great mental and physical suffering such as extreme anxiety sadness or pain or state of being in danger distress emotionally and financial distress some point in time we will be in distress where sometimes you don't even know what to turn you're on that stream but David amazing person he said in my distress I call upon the Lord and I cried onto my God and sometimes we feel safe we feel on our jobs on family home whatever environment we feel very comfortable and you expect things to work fine and good and smooth and then as the prophet could see sometimes that they come or dark days or I really can't come dismal time come and you find yourself under the weather in distress and you are challenged tonight to call on God to ask of him in your time of trouble and this is the prophet singing he said if the king of the prophets was here tonight the Lord Jesus in a physical form so you could look at him you are looking at us this woman here somebody will come why there'll be nothing could be done only he would have to tell them something as far as healing they could not heal them because he already done it his sacrifice was complete it was finished there but these gifts here we go these gifts are to bring you to what was finished at Calvary do you understand Say Amen okay something Gifts of preaching teaching all kind of a prophetic gifts are to bring you to the realization of what happened at Calvary that you just to enjoy and receive the attributes of country not produce the attributes but to bring you to the knowledge of what has been done the sacrifice has done been provided you just get to look that way and believe the Lord bless you so for the balance of this just act tonight as though the Lord Jesus was standing here somewhere in the room in I know you would be very reverent give your prayer as representing by Divine gift if the holy spirit will do it you say for the brand you're stolen so he's picking up people thinking he's just talking and stalling listen to what he said after this that's exactly right I am I am waiting till I feel his presence I know that the anointing is on me I have a way of yielding myself I stand on the street and do it I Stand Down by the lake side and do it when it is necessary and the Holy Spirit comes when I am talking to someone that's in distress and trouble and right there on the street or anywhere it meets it will tell them just exactly what they must do and so forth there's many people in here could raise their hands as to a witness of that knowing that's the truth how many knows that is true raise your hand see what I mean to the people who hasn't that only been in the meetings out there in the mountain side on the roadside meeting cars anywhere it is a yielding yourself to the holy spirit so brother grew to the point where he could make himself available to the Holy Spirit here we go now he is here the angel of the Lord it is here now the one you see on the picture is knowing the building be reverent don't move around please bring the patient that's what I have to give you here tonight in word form and I want to share with you now it's about 13 minutes or so a clip of the profit from the evening messenger and I want to empty and try to grasp every word because these things are given by the spirit and I don't feel this by chance we're going to hear that tonight so I want you to listen carefully and just get in the spirit and you'll see what the Lord will do praise the Lord so we want to go straight into this right now [Music] the evening lighter here back to the word now with your heads bound your heart's bound ask yourself this question do I measure up to this word to do my prayer is from the platform old God cut everything from me it's not like you oh God take away from me uh we're down here at the end of the road all right would you be that sincere to raise your hands and say God Cut From Me Everything Is Not Like You Make Me Lord yes Lord yes if there's anybody that isn't right it's a sinner is drifting in here tonight never accepted Christ a savior or a backslider or something it wants to come back you're invited to come stand here at the altar if you believe that God would hear my prayers for the sick I'll leave you to hear me and you and I together as we place our faith upon the sacrifice Jesus Christ the son of God and all for prayer I believe God will hear you're invited to come and stand for prayer our heavenly father we give to you this audience these broken up words has been lengthy large even many has gotten tired and weary and has gone home and maybe some felt a little bad and Lord I I just can't tell who's in the audience all the time and after all father it's your word and you know my heart so and um whoa is me if I don't do it and I I must do it Lord so I pray now that the people who has understanding of the word will understand clearly and I'm sure those that you've called a life well that it's not anything in the world but a Heart full of love for God and his church that I plead these things father practically every hand in here went up for a circumcision to be cut away all the Surplus that doesn't belong there God help us all I stand right with them Lord I'm one of them I'm watching for the coming of that glad Millennium Day When sin and shame shall be destroyed forever father while we're in this world we know that we're subject to these things we're subject to mistakes we're subject to sin we're still walking and yet we don't desire to do it as the Bible said faint not when you reproved but I pray father that the reproving of the word Cuts me just as hard as it cuts the rest of us and I pray father that they don't understand it that way I pray that you'll bless them now and may this as we prayed before Lord knowing and watching what we ask for because we don't want to ask the myth we don't want to ask something it's just to make up words because we're talking to you I asked you to bless our little brother here and opened his door for me to come in tonight uh three that you're your bless his church and may every one of his members Lord just may this be a lighthouse a place where the gifts of God are flowing and everything just running smoothly bless every minister to study here their churches and may there be such a shaken or a sounding in the mulberry tree of the spirit of God Crossing beings and bringing the churches to fellowship and to and to a great great Bible that the ministers won't be able to preach for the glory of God but when the saints come together early in the afternoon the crying and praying and testifying and messages just a real pouring of the spirit when the whole city will be attracted to come listen granted now heal the sick in our midst one give to them Divine Deliverance father through Jesus Christ's name now with our heads bound if there's any here that desires to stand right around the altar now and while we have our heads bound and we're just going to hum a little song uh uh the good old gospel song and we want to hum that and when we do it there's anybody desires for us to pray for you the deeper experience to receive the holy ghost or you're saved and have been Sanctified yet or whatever we'll be glad to do that while we hung this little song I love him and if you do love him let's respect his word now ah [Applause] here [Music] just my salvation [Music] [Applause] every bother coming on each one take their place shirt all right sisters I love him [Music] I love you because oh [Music] I know some of you sisters with short hair come up here and Blades to God won't you come say Lord I want to be writing all things I want to start right I want to get on the right Road and stay there I'm going to make a pledge to you tonight lord it's going to grow out now the Bible says a shame for a man to have long hair looks like a woman God made two covenants one with Adam and one with Eve he dressed them different they're different all together they've always been different these two covenants right on down to the Bible I like to preach on that devil Covenant one night sometime show you what the difference is oh my it's tremendous is even your marriage and divorce case if you only knew the truth on that would settle the whole matter that's right all right again now while we be sure now come won't she uh you need the Holy Spirit come on [Music] oh A Closer Walk With Me can't make a bow Stand By and keep it and you're no good to make the vow unless you keep it oh you can come make your bow God has to feel it hold your vows I'm going to ask my miniature Brothers if you'll walk down now around here stand right around these precious people while we breathe on your speak to each one as their needs and everyone's just as Reverend as you can be foreign [Music] [Music] ministers are gathering on both sides [Music] I'd like to see that Ministers of different organizations all in one now that's under the blood [Music] um [Music] I woke up Brothers right to your person you're standing by put your hand up on and ask them what they're wanting from God is a wonderful time you know when I see this look at your Ministers of different churches standing around together the sisters that was on the cons is up out gone praise the Lord so thankful for them standing in the name of the Lord now let the audience now everybody bow your hand each one of y'all in your heart just talk to God like you talk to me like you come and say brother Branham uh if you've done something wrong say I'm sorry brother Branham I did this will you forgive me for it I make a promise you brother Brandon I'll never do that against you again now this change from money from me to your lord Jesus Christ and if you need healing like if you come say brother Brandon uh I am broke I didn't have any supper tonight and uh uh yeah I know if you had a dollar you would give it to me I see you don't have to say to God if you've got healing power he hasn't see you'd have to say me if you've got it but to him you don't have to say if you have he has please so you say like brother Branham would you give me a dollar I I need something to eat well of course I will you know that if I had it I'd give it to you anytime I would have a horrible heart if I didn't have me being a cruel sinful man and would be that good-hearted to somebody like you what would God do if you being evil know how to give good gifts how much more will your heavenly father give them the spirit that it asks for you if you ask for a fish would he give you a serpent ask for bread would he give you a stone certainly not while you're just asking in that way with faith believing that you would get it from him a million times quicker than you'd get anything from me and you know what I'd help you I'd do anything I could in these brothers would would dig every penny out of our pocket to help you we'll do anything we could but this is something you've got to believe by faith now you believe that you receive it while we pray and you pray and the audience prayed and I believe God will come down and honor our prayer and the very minute that you feel that you have it and God's going to enter your prayer that if you made a cousin Lord I did wrong I won't do it no more I raise my hand I promise you I won't God will take it your word and you just leave it that way and it'll all be over then just raise up your hands and thank you Lord I've made my vow and I know all that it's yours and you promise to answer you can't say Heavenly Father we your servants stand over this group that has come forward needing your blessings and your attention at this time father they are trophies of the message the evening lifetime many of them are are confessing some of them are desperately in need I pray God that in Jesus name that you will not turn one of them away because you'll keep your word
