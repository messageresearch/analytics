ripened fruit unto perfection amen let me say one more time the perfect word seed in your soul is growing and will produce ripened fruits on to perfection amen let me say man this morning praise the Lord amen so praise God amen so this morning we are in a sea time it's harvest time it's fruit time amen Bob Arum says the church has grown it has grown from justification through sanctification into the baptism of the holy ghost and now into the restoration of the gifts coming to the bud here we are ready for harvest now amen hallelujah God shall come someday and we'll see him and love him can we say Amen hallelujah but how can we have a harvest of fruits if we never had a time of planting seeds hey man if you have an apple in your hand then that means it was picked from an apple tree somewhere amen and if you have an apple tree that means somebody planted an apple seed Oklahoma the god a man can we say Amen no seed no fruit no seed no fruit hallelujah no fruit means either there is no seed or something is wrong with your seed hallelujah but I believe this morning we have some real genuine seeds of God in this house this morning who are going to bring forth fruit hallelujah praise God a man Dana I wouldn't be long this morning maybe about an hour or so but I want you to see that see today a man now God wants a harvests our fruit what do you think he did turn around and tell you your neighbor what do you think Lord did if you wanted a harvest of fruit tell somebody hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah praise God amen yes that's right he planted season you deep deep down in your heart before the foundation of the world give the Lord a hand the praise glory recording that hallelujah every predestinated son and daughter of God has a seed planted inside your heart hallelujah and that seed cannot die that seed cannot fail that seed kind of blocked backslide this morning praise God a man what do you think holds you and you get low or when you feel down you can't hold yourself you can't keep yourself it's not predestinated seed in your soul hallelujah praise God thank you Jesus hey man you are no match for the devil you that carnal old 16 elements freshmen listen Satan has over 6,000 years of experience but when he comes into contact with that seed ouch hallelujah cannot be defeated invincible unstoppable praise God thank you Jesus hallelujah you cannot miss the rapture even if you try hallelujah hallelujah that's seed in you not sealing you hallelujah praise God amen hallelujah glory in a god a man thank you Jesus no wonder burn around I'm sad that you are not the real believer but it's the seed in you that is the real believer hallelujah praise God a man no wonder barber I'm sad when the bride gets to know who she is the rapture will go hallelujah praise God she will be an invincible army say man this morning I come from God and I'm going right back to God hallelujah hallelujah it's not me carnal old me it's not seed within me say man say man and Michael kicked that devil out of heaven but now the same seed in me which is part of God will kick that devil right out of here this morning praise God amen get out of my life get out of my home get out of my family you filthy devil praise God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah let's make the devil of football this morning he came around a man he came up praise God put your foot on his neck hallelujah by the authority of who you I am God hallelujah and who your father is give him praise give them praise glory to God hallelujah hallelujah come on it's C time it's harvest time praise God if God before us you tell me who can be against us give the Lord a hand of pray thank you lord thank you lord praise the name of the Lord thank you Jesus you may be seated [Applause] no God hello him all he knows this perfection amen he's the perfect one he is eternal made up of seven perfect spirits the function of infinity and that God created a perfect man in the garden in his very image and likeness can we say man notice when God formed man from the dust and breathed into his nostrils man became a living soul not a body Genesis 2:7 can we say man a living soul praise God mind so God made Adam a living soul there's something or the soul of man that God is interested in this morning hallelujah and I almost created in the image and likeness of God he was perfect he was the perfect creation of God he was the perfect fruit of God and sin brought a separation when Adam fell between God and man a man and the life line was broken the connection to perfection was cut and the image fell down from a perfect level to a human level a carnal level the fruit itself was no longer perfect my god Adam originally could never grow old now he can there was no sickness before the fall no he could get sick there was no death before the fall but a wages of sin is death and Adam died after 930 years my man God's fruit was now corrupted by sin it was no longer a perfect fruit my and all other fruits that would come forth through Adam would not be public fruits my God my god a man Moses was the greatest prophet not like him but he disobeyed God and struck the rock an imperfect fruit Jacob was a trickster he deceived many people imperfect fruit David committed adultery and murder are imperfect fruit so he was a man after God's own heart but still imperfect fruit hallelujah Joseph came very close to perfection so much so that he was used to type affection but he lied he told us but us to say that they were not Shepherds my brother all those Bible believers had some flaw to tarnish them from being perfect fruit glory to God my God my God my my my yet yet if we go across the Matthew 5:48 the Bible says be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect my brother Branham says God demands perfection God requires perfection no one could ever come to heaven outside of being perfect you must be perfect hallelujah amen yet the scripture says none is perfect we all have sinned and come short of the glory of God my how are we ever going to enter God's dwelling place when he requires perfection my god Branham says from the message the law having a shadow when sin was first given in the Garden of Eden the man was in a perfect state until he fell then he marred his perfection he marred his inheritance with God he lost his fellowship and was cut off away from God amen so the fruit was no longer perfect hey man Oh Luke chapter 8 verse 14 are you ready he talks of all those seeds and fell among thorns how they were choked by different situations and they brought no fruits on to perfection [Applause] my so God is interested in perfect fruit so you mean you can have bad fruit good but then there's fruits aren't to perfection perfect fruit amen you mean that God was not happy with it with those fruits that are not brought on to perfection he started me with any man so tell me where are you going without half the Christian life my brother say man you're not praying every day you're not in the word you're not seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost desperately praise God raise your fruits of the spirit love and joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness and temperance come on now say man where your fruits of the spirit is mourning and my nephew Daniel you told me I'm a rough guy so after pray for Gentiles amen amen praise God hallelujah but God once a perfect fruit amen Satan is laughing at you if you don't come to perfection because Satan knows the world amen he even believes the word my he knows it's the truth say man don't be fool now he knows more than some of you my hallelujah praise God Satan comes to church every Sunday morning hallelujah he takes notes he records it on his telephone my god Satanists in church every Sunday morning my so he knows what we are supposed to become a man so when he sees hypocrites or nice church members or pious lovely religious spirits he is happy with you he says very good you stay right there don't go any further my my glory to God the word says don't cut your hair sisters but just the devil oh but just cut just enough so that no one can see after all you won't be stumbling anybody Mart they can't see anything of stumbling them just cut it short enough that nobody could see a man somebody give it all on the praise very strong bracelet so Satan is coming to church not to become the word but to see how best we can tie up your head from what you have heard in church now you will bring reasoning you will prey on your affection your affection and emotions he will look at your conscience Amen hallelujah glory to God a man but all of it always says Satan is not afraid of who you are now with all your friends and your mistakes these are afraid of that but he's afraid of who you can become by the Word of God and by the spirit so his job is to distract you from focusing on getting the Holy Ghost and becoming the word say Amen hallelujah see but not one more days devil Oh glory to God Satan you're exposed today get out of here in the name of Jesus hallelujah I can see those demons pushing one another and scampering on the stairs praise God this place is getting too hot for the devil amen praise God a man you are going to be perfect you are going to be perfect give the Lord a hand the press thank you lord [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah come on now not one more day for the devil not one more day for the devil I'm on my way to perfection hallelujah glory to God Oh [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen so let's press on it's Z time it's fruit time it's harvest time amen praise God so in Saint John 15 verse 16 amen let's read it one more time you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain amen there are two things that are very important that God is saying to you this morning from that scripture are you ready are you ready are you ready amen what you have not chosen me but I have chosen you say Amen I feel so special this morning I feel so loved by God Oh glory took calling and blessed be the name of the law if you have to choose something it means that there are many in a group and I bought my pass all the others and selected this particular one this one over there not one over there running about to the black jacket that's why I selected I chose him Alleluia praise God praise God amen you mean to say that there are over seven billion people all over the earth and the core of eternity hello him Jehovah the creator of the universe shows me pouring of God praise God praise God praise God yes the Prophet said you are one in a million hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah a million people were lost when God chose you he bypassed a million people to choose you say man this morning hallelujah praise God you did not choose me but I chose you before the foundation of the world hallelujah good people nice people strong people intelligent people holy people and Lord you chose that were all insignificant me what do you see in below all I see is my faults and our failures and my shortcomings what do you see in me Lord hallelujah this is a good place right here to give God some appreciation and gratitude praise God stand up to your feet and give him a shout of praise that you never saw it before shouts unto the Lord and spoon give Him praise giving soda praise hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you did not choose me it was I who chose you thank you Lord for choosing me thank you Lord for loving me when I was unlovable guilty when I was a sinner he died that I can go free he looked beyond my faults and saw my need oh god I love you oh god I worship you praising this morning give him a shout of praise [Applause] give embrace them embrace express the appreciation express your gratitude hallelujah hallelujah what rid of God a man o blessed be the name of the Lord let's set be the name of the Lord Oh hallelujah marina God thank you Jesus Oh Prince groaning Oh hallelujah thank you Lord you may be seated praise God let us go back to sin John 15 again there's a second very important thing that God has sent to you from that scripture he says I have obtained you that you should go and bring forth fruit or danger or change you so I went to the dictionary to make sure I understood clearly what ordained means in this context and it says to a point so anoint to order to give a command hallelujah praise gonee man then I understood that after he chose me he commissioned me to go forth and bear fruit [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah in other words after he chose you he anointed and appointed you to bring forth fruit he is not asking you kindly it is a command and yes giving you what it takes to carry all the instructions hallelujah praise God blessed be the name of the walk glory now listen it's not just any fruit but fruit that should remain say man not in church today and tomorrow you're backslidden not today up to day and down tomorrow not fruit Sarah green not true Sarah tossed about by every wind of doctrine and fall off the tree and I my he wants fruits that would remain a man he wants mature fruits he wants ripe fruits amen if you don't remain in the presence of the hot to lie son how will you get right say man so he sends trials and tests and buckles on every side and you stand steadfast unmovable flat-footed grounded in the love of God praise God a many many men on your fruit sow remain Oh Lord of God thank you Jesus hallelujah in other words fruits on to perfection hallelujah given order hand the Prince [Applause] [Music] so God has ordained you to bring forth perfect fruit tell me say man not good fruit now but fruit unto perfection female espresso so now God wants a perfect fruit he had a perfect fruit son and the god Adam Adam was perfect before he fell now man becomes human amen to be human is to be imperfect that's why when we make a mistake and we are caught what do we say we are quick to say I'm only human I'm not perfect amen do we say that sometimes amen okay so man after the fall is human imperfect freshly and Conner amen the Bible says to be carnally minded is death death Romans 8:7 the carnal mind is enmity against God so God hates the carnal fleshly man my god amen hallelujah therefore God had to make a way to lift fallen man out of this mess called a humanistic realm or the human spirit Oh glory to God Amen hallelujah praise God praise God amen let me just stick with it God does not make mistakes if he makes some mistakes then he is not God he is a human just like you and me you don't want a god who's making mistakes like yourself a man car don't get surprised like we humans do he is infinite he's omniscient he knows all things hallelujah from beginning to end amen hallelujah he's Alpha and Omega amen God is not reactive because you do this let me see how I can fix this problem no no no God is proactive amen so when the devil thought he was finishing off God by introducing sin in the garden God was one step ahead of the devil ah louia praise God in it so before the beginning God said I know that ugly devil will try not silly trick in the garden mine to put an end to my perfect fruit harvest so you know what I will do I will choose my people before Satan even comes into the picture hallelujah praise God he got before Satan was created corner already chosen you do you praise God amen praise God amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so God chose even before he created the devil and because he wanted a perfect fruit a perfect harvest in the fullness of time or at the end of time or when time runs out because he wanted a perfect harvest he put a perfect seed in each of the ones that he chose hallelujah before the foundation of the world honey or take them to bring forth perfect fruit in the last days give the Lord a shout hallelujah Oh glory to God hallelujah no seed no fruit perfect scene perfect fruit hallelujah praise God amen if you want a public fruit they will rise up perfect see a man praise God so the fruit is a finished product amen praise God hallelujah let me say Amen praise God so when we are talking about seeds yes some laws which I call the seed laws praise God seed laws and the first one from Genesis 111 every seat must bring forth after its sky give the Lord a hand a brace thank you lord so whatever we are saying it's right in the Bible a man ma a man a mango seed brings for a mango fruit a cherry see bring forth a cherry fruit can we say man me sailors a serpent seed bring forth a silver fruit hallelujah praise God so whatever is locked up inside that seed will determine the type of fruit can be say man hallelujah but the seed that God placed in you before the foundation of the world was a perfect see it had perfection in it it has eternity in it it has the Holy Ghost in it but what kind of fruit will you produce fruits unto perfection say man a perfect fruit hallelujah glory to God amen another seed law Luke 8:11 the seed is the word of God say man what about says the Word of God is a seed say man praise God my so when God placed a seed in your soul was it a word seed was it but what I do know is that this bride will be a wood bride huh isn't it probably is because she has a word seed in her nuts up give a lot of Hana brace hallelujah hallelujah praise God do I hear a secret the word is in the bride who you praise God amen amen is that what a prophet said she will be word upon word upon word upon word a man in other words the word seed in her will grow and grow and grow a man hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and the Bible says that heaven and earth will pass away but my words shall never pass away amen then God's words are eternal Oh glory to God thy word our Lord is forever settle in the heavens hallelujah praise God let me tell you something you Bride of Christ you are carrying eternity inside of you hallelujah do you think you are ordinary human being going to work washing clothes fixing cars building houses off no no no you are current in eternity inside of you you are powering perfection inside of you praise God but it's locked up in a seed oh it's nothing a seed praise God hallelujah praise God it wants to be to grow outside you are not hearing what I'm saying why would you let the seed grow why would you let that seed grow eternity locked up inside of you in a seat perfection locked up inside of you in a seed and you won't let it grow you stifle asleep my god let it go this morning hallelujah some of you sit there silent and sad and down and always heavy and oppressed the seed can grow in our atmosphere Satan is making mincemeat out of you hallelujah praise God race car but let me tell you the third seed Lord if you take a red bean seed and you rest it on a puppet but you leave it there for five years you could polish it you can shine it up you could prove it but the only way for that red bean seed to begin to grow is to begin to put it in the right atmosphere under the right conditions Oh chlorine of God hallelujah hallelujah put in some soil throw some water on it maybe out of the heat praise God and brother that seed will begin to burst open hallelujah hallelujah and out will come the roots and the leaves hallelujah praise God those leaves will begin to dance on an a/c and sing and worship God [Applause] follow me [Music] question for Tina do you want your seat to grow this morning halleluyah halleluyah will start to water it with praises hallelujah somebody prays in this hall somebody praising hallelujah creates an atmosphere of praise and worship praise and worship hallelujah and joy in a the joy of the Lord is your strength how dare you come in here sad crazy story man when the joy of the Lord is your strength give him praise this morning but put about some praise [Music] hallelujah the soil is faith the seed in your soul thrives in the bed and ground of weight hallelujah a feet rich environment praise God now you are doing all you can do now you are getting started the mechanics amen start to pray start to worship repent get baptized anoint your feet forgive drop your ox love your brother love your enemies amen the mechanics is getting the conditions right it's doing all that you can do and watch that seed is ready to push for giving praise giving praise hallelujah but brother there's one more seed law Monsignor sorry no sir that's a son hallelujah you take an egg that was laid by a hand and you give it all the conditions you want all the walls whatever it the hen whatever the egg needs if that hand does not get the germ of life from the meal and we'll never had it it will remain warm it has all the conditions but there's something missing if that scene is death if it has not been German ties but I will never go it will remain beer dry word see by remember I'm said the disciples in the upper room would dry seats but they were worshipping and creating an atmosphere waiting for life itself to come to them the spirit man so they had the conditions but it will wake him on life itself did you in other words the letter killeth but the spirit gives life that see in spite of all the mechanics need some dynamics it needs some Pitman power to make it come alive hallelujah hallelujah glory to God and this morning we are crying out for the quick them power to quicker quicker quicker nut seed in our soul hallelujah get the Lord on the praise [Applause] from the message

was before the fall can you say Amen anybody sleeping see one I kind of closed along there somewhere and I've called names praise God but God had a plan which he pulled us to achieve in three Falls and bourbon call it the tree fool purpose of God or the tree fault mystery of God however you say God simply once man back in a perfect state so that he can come once again and have fellowship with him can we say man praise God now the Prophet said that we are living in a house soul body in spirit he said that is the way God lived in Jesus soul body and spirit so we know that in a human heart in the center is a little compartment where not even my blood cell touches the animal heart does not have it science says is the occupation of the soul that's where God dwells inside a heart inside the soul mmm that's where he wants occupy to come and occupy the throne in your heart this morning amen praise God that's where the seed of God is placed in there before the foundation of the world amen but that seed will remain dormant until it is sweetened by the Holy Spirit and that's when you are reborn or born again hallelujah hallelujah we did not become seed by the new birth but because we were seed therefore we can't be reborn can we say man glory notice a church member has no seed in their soul you have a soul because you're a human but there's no seed and only elected the ones that are chosen are ordained to bring forth fruits have a seed and can't be reborn say Amen so in the church member there's nothing to quit they are just happy to feel the anointing the sale was a good message but you go out and do their own thing they have nothing to do it bearing fruits on to perfection they just want to be nice good people they just want to be a good fruits but not interested in being perfect they can't take the cotton and the pruning on the shaping but you can say man hallelujah you can Tina you are not a church member he meant you have to know that my revelation Amen praise God amen so the spirit because the word in you and it begins to produce the life from inside the seed then your Christian life starts to grow now you have just become a Christian [Music] what about themselves after you get the Holy Ghost then make yourself into a purse then give a lot of hard to praise hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God amen hallelujah hallelujah so God wants to bring man back to perfection in terms of three fools one God reveals himself to the church through Jesus Christ to God wants to have the preeminence is in his church that he might live in us so that Christ will be manifested in his church 3 God wants to restore the kingdom to its rightful position in other words bring the original Adam and Eve again made out of the same blood and spirit so that we could go back to Eden again amen amen so now step one is complete God has already expressed himself in Christ Word made flesh God becoming less mysterious more tangible that we can handle him hey man he's our kinsman redeemer hey man great score bharanam said Christ is that seed that was produced by the Word of God the perfect fruit hey Manny man from spoken with his original see God manifested himself so perfectly in Jesus Christ because he was the seed word the germ itself the germ that's inside the seed that's the life that's the germ the germ is a spirit the Germans of water that's Christ can we say Amen hallelujah so step one is fear amen but it is step two where Christ the word not a crisis revealed Christ the word must come into our flesh and ooze out of us Christ was a very word which is God in flesh form now that same word Christ must become flesh in our lives and that's where most of us are amen you lord on the praise [Music] this is where the wood image Christ must be formed into you as to take the word that's see then you can't expand and grow it says give me the word give me the word word on top of word something in

over it came to give a short explanation the Blessed place and so so he said thank God for Stephen and so on but his next sentence was but your human spirit must be crushed this is at my tongues given

Bernadotte seed must fall to the ground and die and rot and disintegrate because in death this victory and that is new life say man praise God praise God so yes the flesh of this human spirit outside

my conscience is right do it you know bottom in the way the world says no but your conscience tells you all right you could go ahead go ahead that's all right go to the party even you won't dance avenging but your conscience all right go ahead but the world says no but if conditions allows you to go and you put your conscience above the word amen so the human spirit is a powerful thing don't tell me what to do I go to church every day I know already the scripture means this and that's how I think it is and that's not I love this worldly man and I'm marrying him don't tell me the Bible say don't be unequally you that's me I pray every day I read my Bible I know more coats than you but I still the human spirit I live a decent respect for life and that's what is important I live a decent respectful life I'm a respectful member of society that's what matters to me I give my goods to feed the poor I am a good person but that's just the human spirit it has nothing to do with God and it has got to die say man I know this little harlot gonna say because if it doesn't die you will stay right there with your good self to get spirit you will abide alone with your good fruits and never bring forth much fruit on to perfection and God rejects anything outside of perfection say men in other words the second step of the tree for mystery of all will not become accomplished through you you will never manifest Christ God cannot have the preeminence 'as through you because you want to do your own thing amen you've got to die to your good self no one that job said I hate myself and joke was pretty good but he I hate myself isaiah 64:6 we are all as unclean as an unclean thing and all our righteousness are as filthy rags a man filthy filthy unclean a man I'm not talking about committing adultery and fornication that's loss of the fleshly lust of the eyes but I'm talking about the pride of life the envy and jealousy and bitterness that you can't see outwardly yet you go to church every Sunday yet you never told a lie this morning no matter who you are die die die and praise God praise God let up human spirit name and praising him up a lot brother Steven Oliver you have to die first yes Lord I want to die come on give him praise give him praise you want to raise high this morning but you got to die hallelujah I'm not talking to going leader anyone there's one time

killing the flesh with a knife Amen praise God you know what I want to die but hope to die can somebody tell me how to die I always say yes how to die we need to die how to die Jesus showed us how to die amen the weight of the whole world was upon him he felt the pressure the agony the paying attention the embarrassment his human part in other words he wants spirit part try it out just scape Lord if it's possible take this cup away from me that's the human spirit the human part but any tied to his human spirit the human spirit died it was crushed and he said not my will but thy will be done all are hallelujah where Baron said that was that was where he overcame that was when he got a victory over the cross amen amen that's how you die my brother and Paul says we got to die daily daily amen every single day man don't say I'm dead already no no you are very much alive my you got to die daily amen you die everyday by denying the flesh and the human spirit and put in court first in everything say Amen so you're going back with something today don't say I don't know how to die you are you tired a by denying the flesh and a human spirit and putting God first in everything say Amen share all your rights away the right to defend yourself somebody does you something that's all right the right to get back had somebody what would God have me to do what do you want me to do Lord where should I go Lord what should I say where what shall i wear is my is my clothes too tight do you want me to wear this robe what is the right attitude that I should have in this situation what would Jesus do ha what Jesus behave in this situation as the song says to be like Jesus on earth I long to be like here manor hallelujah give the Lord on the praise Amen when Jesus had the woman at the well just by asking her go bring your husband where BOM said he was actually discerning of human spirit amen he saw what her trouble was amen amen he saw what kind of person she was hallelujah she was an ill-favored woman a prostitute but she was honest a man right so you see the human spirit has good in it and it has evil in it praise God it agrees with part of the word and disagrees with the other part that's the human spirit you see it comes from the tree of knowledge of good and evil amen and that is death so we must die a human spirit that humans world must die and rot and become and be crushed by a steamroller praise God hallelujah and this flesh which is controlled by all human spirit got to die die die and die again give the Lord a hand a breath [Applause] almost from the message the angel of the Lord Murano when the human element goes out the Spirit of God fills the vacancy where you empty yourself then the church will walk in the power of the resurrection of the Lord in his steps can we say Amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah to be like Jesus amen hallelujah glory amen and as I said before the greatest revelation is not how to live but how to die amen because once we die we can bring forth much fruit and in death there is life can we say Amen praise God amen praise God now the heart is the center of the emotions of a human being and from the message why some people can't keep victory b-bomb said God puts a new heart in the middle of the old man amen a new heart I will give you then he puts a new spirit in the middle of the new heart and then he puts his spirit in the middle of the Duisburg amen hallelujah many times we say as soon as you get your new spirit oh I quit stealing and lying and things like that you say hallelujah I've got it but the first time someone crosses your path a little bit almost see what a difference you blow up like a frog eating buckshot miss Wilbur I'm say how you say you step on my toe I'm not putting up with that it shows what spiritual got to do amen amen a good spirit and you spra but not yet demon he says I'll put a new spirit in you then now put my Holy Spirit into your new spirit amen so press more amen hallelujah hallelujah amen but you will take that word and die hallelujah and form yourself into the word image then the human spirit is home then Christ can have the preeminence as in your life hallelujah and that's the second fall of the threefold mystery hallelujah Christ in you the hope of glory now you are a living moving monument its Christ walking on two feet again God using your hands hallelujah God seeing through your eyes once again the world will see Jesus sirs would we see Jesus yes you will in the pride of Jesus Christ give the Lord a hand up ray hallelujah hallelujah

Matthew chapter 16 one of the most notable chapters in the book of Matthew prior to Matthew 16 the disciples had been with Jesus but it was not very clear as to what their understanding of who he was really was so he ventured to ask a question who do men say I am and they responded with the best of their knowledge with the best of their ability with the deepest of the revelation that they had in the sea some say you are this some say uija lies some say and it was all good things and Jesus went beyond that and posed the question to the individuals who do you say that I am you've been with me you've been to services you have seen me preach you have seen miracles now based on what you have seen and what do you experience who do you say that I am and there were silence Peter responded thou are the Christ and Jesus said to him flesh and blood did not reveal this to you but my father in heaven but as we progress through that scripture in Matthew 16 it's the first time Jesus opens up to them and tells them what's about to happen and then he speaks one of the most pivotal scriptures in Christendom if I could say that and and as brother Stephen was speaking he asks the question how can I die how can I die Hogan Hawking little me become smaller and smaller until Christ becomes visible what can I do every day what do I do in the morning and lunch them an evening on Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday and Thursday to make sure that that Christ can become visible so 1 lakh and look into the mirror of the world and see Jesus looking back at me and jesus said to his disciples in Matthew 6 he was 24 he said if any man any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me and whoever or whosoever shall save his life shall lose it and whoever whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it and then he asks a question that's supposed to be the great equalizer for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul and he brings it even more personal or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul and as where the stephan1 speaking this script it jumped out at me and I said I want to share it with the church because there are a lot of people trying to save their lives you work hard to see in your life because that's how you think you're gonna see or come out of the situation that you're in you wanna work harder you wanna do this you wanna you struggle to do this and and in the process of trying to save it your way you are losing it but Jesus made it claims there is any man who come after me let him deny himself and that there is where the death takes place where you deny yourself so as you're about to do something you ask yourself is this really me or is this the word and it is not a word you deny yourself that's how you die everyday by giving up the things that you want to do giving up the things that maybe you love to do and in doing so you make room for Claude to step in and direct how you should move how you should act and that's what perfection is because Christ directed service when he is in the control tower of your soul and he has control of the steering wheel of the car of your life this should not be a battle for the steering wheel Jesus shouldn't be pulling left and you are pulling right he should have total control there's no need of a backseat driver when Jesus is driving there's no need of a side driver when Jesus is driving Jesus doesn't need directions turn left turn left don't know is the second house on the right turn after that Jesus doesn't need directions he knows where everything is he knows where your blessing is he knows what time you need to get to your destination and he will never be late he will always be on time so let Jesus Drive the car of your life deny yourself let go of the steering wheel let go of the controls relax in his presence let him take the wheel put your hands up in the air say lord I give it to you I let go I let go I heard a testimony one time keep playing this if a guy who was driving very very fast he said was very late he was trying to get home and he said he may have started a drifter sleeping when he caught himself his car was just going out of control he said his human mind didn't know what to do so he just lifted his hand and said Lord take over and he said he cannot explain what happened he can't explain what happened next but he found himself back at the side of the road how do you explain stuff like and I don't know what condition you are going to right now and many of us our lives such as turning out of control when you are out of control there's one solution I will never feel put your hands up and say Lord fix it Lord fix it because you didn't place the seed in your soul you couldn't put it a he put the seed in your soul and all God wants and every service is designed to catch your attention so that for a few minutes you can focus on him as well the black man said when you take care of his business he'll Teke of yours he said seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and every other thing will be added unto you can we give the Lord a hand upraised you love him this morning will you serve him this morning will you worship him this morning give the Lord a shout of praise many many many men hallelujah you may be seated so service continues this evening at 3:00 p.m. we have the Lord's Supper and [Music] doors will open at 2:30 p.m. come reverently come in the spirit called a few minutes before and pray up the service let's see what the Lord will do for us tonight maintenance Group one police metered by the puffle after the second service to handle the cleaning of the church and from Addis even on behalf of the ministry my general reminder for contribution to the maintenance fund is a box located under the staircase towards the maintenance of the property and very important there'll be I want to call it a youth oriented service not a youth service because we don't want it limited by age in any way if the entire church could be there that's what we want button Saturday the 16th of September that's not this Saturday the following Saturday at 5 p.m. we want to have a youth oriented service and there are a lot of believers in the church who have a burden for the young people and they are others sadly who have no burden no interest in what takes place you know and whether Daly was speaking last week and he said the very sign that those who are under the altar would not bride he said they were crying for vengeance there is a nature that is attached to the seed in your soul that seed has certain behaviors that come with the seed as the seed begins to blossom and bring forth and expand and in its evolution if I can use the word towards bringing forth fruit but in your souls that have a burden you don't have to have kids to have a burden for young people if your children are not in church doesn't mean you have no burden I challenge you to catch a button I heard a preacher say recently people people don't like prayer meetings because they don't pray enough they don't know what to pray for if you don't know what to pray for for yourself pretty for the young people because what the young people have to go through us all on and I consider myself now and all the one we've never had to go through that so catch a burden for the young people that God could give them an experience with the supernatural because without an experience it's impossible to last but it's even said it in your human flesh you are no match for the devil it takes more than your intellect it takes more than you planning it takes more than your effort to make it it takes God Himself to pour fire so poorly on the seed for you to come to life and we are praying that God will lose something special for the young people and I'm charging you with the responsibility to spread the word about the youth service and every service you have responsibility that's part of our Christian walk in the book of Acts said be witnesses go into all the world and preach the gospel I challenge you call somebody up why did you miss service today call somebody I'm calling to make sure you'll be in next service we are our brother's keeper it's our responsibility but brother Isaac I really make it myself I was trying to encourage anybody else do you know when you encourage somebody you get stronger as weak as you might be when you will courage somebody gets wound up my dad says one time he was much younger I'm closing and he said he was thinking of giving up your you remember right he said it was tingling about her brother came to mind a party oh boy I feeling I feel it her back slightly finna give up I might have a backslide you feel it you cop a snide you by time you finish encouraging me he was so inspired so anointed so when you reach beyond yourself and stop looking at poor me me my mistake my situation and go beyond yourself you seek or begin to anoint you and renew your strength like the ego curry newest sweet can we give the Lord a hand o praise you love them meet a lord richly bless you give myself away [Music] even you loving this thing please go does your security to calm me man [Music] [Music] Oh oh I just give myself for so I can use to give myself away I'll just give myself away so you can use here [Music] lord is it y'all Oh long your desires reveal here give myself away I just give myself [Music] so yeah give myself away give myself Karen give myself more just kidding myself or so can you
