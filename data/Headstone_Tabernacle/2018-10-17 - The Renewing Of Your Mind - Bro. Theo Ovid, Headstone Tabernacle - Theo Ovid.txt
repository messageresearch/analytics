your knowledge understanding father come know tonight and blessed Jesus and we ask it amen and amen god bless you and welcome so good for you guys to be all cheer tonight amen all is bad whether somebody even call to find out if we survive in service but God is good we're so glad to be here we are not dry red of Christians email so Romans 12:1 re 2 vs. was 1 & 2 it's familiar scripture thing but Isaac read out on Sunday I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God that's pretty father we thank you for your word now we read it blessed that any man could read it well it takes you to come down and bring life and shine light on it granted father Jesus and we ask it shine your light on your word today and become alive in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen god bless you may be seated have a title the renewing of your mind that's a title tonight the renewing of your mind I was so blessed on Sunday I don't have words to describe how I felt about Sunday service there was such a tremendous blessing to me and now and something the Holy Spirit was speaking about thinking and but Isaac I afterwards I was telling myself no that wasn't on your notes that no he didn't write that that just come my pure inspiration he was the kept for me was very talking about Joshua and Caleb and he had a ten spice is the same line same groups same God same amount and they had no interaction with the Giants so therefore it wasn't as if they were intimidated by the Giants is a matter of what they told themselves so they told themselves we not able to take it they told themselves that the Giants to greet the tall them's of jazz until suppose the Giants was walking with heart failure a bad hat suppose they was behind one by one group they interviewed Giants is saying well you have had condition you're bigger Eddie you know how long you will last doctor and the Giants in well I quit I couldn't just no you know the instructor the chance all they tell themselves we cannot take it and what they thought affect the people what they preach affect the people what they thought affect the people because when Joshua new killer came back to the camp there was a better mountain that was there a depressive anointing that was there and it was over the whole people because they bought a report now I bring industry sharing the power of words and the power of influence over lines and Vava - hallelujah so if a negative word that came from a negative thought could producers and oppressive atmosphere what would a positive world that come from the intelligence what kind of atmosphere is that supposed to produce then that could produce some affect and influence upon your life that will do make you do great things for the kingdom because that's the most important thing if you're big you can see it you will come out of your selfishness and you will see the kingdom of God is at hand what are you doing about God's kingdom because what I want purposed to promote his kingdom not do you miss Kingdom he's blessing you for the kingdom he's adding to you for the kingdom doing here amen tonight he is making a way for you that you could be used for the kingdom or glory of God hallelujah we preach a kingdom message because our king is coming Oh blow a king must have a domain he must have a Dominion you yet about the Saudi or whatnot and they talk about the Prince of Sunday I know buddy kingdom say and the kingdom say I always smile when I hear or how they stop by the Saudis what they see is a kingdom never King the kingdom see this on the kingdom say that what about the kingdom of God [Applause] do you know your name and Branham taught us that the Hebrew word for former is mori isn't that right there's teaching reen and there is inspiration rain and he taught us that there will have former and latter in in the first at the same time for marine and latter rain we have been under teaching green and hardly people looking for the latter mean some people feel they have it already because what we've enlisted him and open this to them and Irena what that but that is not what the Prophet taught us he pauses the Lateran is coming our promise is coming I mean it's so boring but it's still the truth they come like Abraham after ten years Abraham preaching Isaac coming it's on in borås but that was coming it's just 15 more years later after 20 years you see Isaac preaching he say measure the people said repeatedly same thing over and over it's like boil an egg frying egg poach an egg assuming the same charity same dynamics simply because feel on a half of the Chinese ticket how I wanna flip it is the same promise is dynamics is Lateran it's all work in a bridge I've seen you wanna read the preaching water under under sacrifice you're looking for fire or glory of God Alleluia or glory not going to give a transforming power because God promises we not afraid to confess it praise God because we are not in the me I'm not delivering it got one delivered he has been his own with the bath water getting a fight tonight got a little problem stuff the manufacture listing he has people would you see when man had to deliver is one thing but when wanna deliver is another thing when he said a virgin shall conceive me take for the years it wasn't bought idle and what we same time the everything unseasonally is a time for everything under the heaven there's a time I see through everything so if you get excited and the Tigers not yet the other way don't wait till your change come don't wait in your transformation come if God choose tonight is your night tonight is your night look terrible stop you I'm cutting your bridge of the night and I sure you do connect it to us tonight you listening that's for you tonight also you have to believe that God will do it you know what I said if nothing happens to ask for a miracle a miracle working God what are you thinking rest you open up that was America well I see more disclose the Flies that was a miracle but was the cause of frogs that was a miracle hallelujah praise God praise God but it wasn't just nothing to say that Pharaoh died no miracle he could not his head but when he said let there be flies he flies that that comes over on a second I wanna fly a inch had a prawn offline you said one flight to fly and then it was a poke of my eye each or whatever it is let me figure out know what this thing is is no more mounting then frogs flies will attend to blood the cat drink water surgeon then come on make the point what already covered it in the blood hallelujah amen amen so what are you saying by Romans after the teaching ring it's gonna have green laughter here because the teacher main worry is to sow the seed so gotta put the seed in you so here i come from north do not yet so there's a big teaching ring gone for a national teachin dream communism soldier among the nation a rumen Reviver and then he prophesied he said if they give the eastern part of berlin back which did know that means the roman empire is exactly in the all circle it was to be time of jesus that already done when they break down the eastern wall and germany become one the Roman Empire is set that is known history because the power that is the Commish Rome that's the last force that the believers at the deal with not Russia not communism God raised up Russia's and even American Rome Rome is the enemy it has always been the enemy Roman killed 68 million Christians do need a cages Rome is who change parole taken become Papa Rome Rome who morality is not right who have brought as Rome spirit is what called the breaking of bread rain spirit of denomination room and anointing denominational spirit what about what a mother harlot mother prostitute have brought us live in the same way but he call a bride to be virgin not have a not prostitute not foolin here and foolin there a virgin bride that would stay with the word we gotta so what the mother say brother say since a bigger a family thing they supporting this is a word thing this is the kingdom thing or boring it this is a son of God King this men Methodist thing about this thing or Catholic thing this is the word is a seed we produce sons or give the Lord a show this little message believer this is sons and daughters of God God animates this is sons and daughters of God hallelujah listen or I fall in a profit this is sons and daughters of God this is the profit he's a messenger you have a message and this is the brain or give the Lord a shout the messenger confirming a message here comes opinion says he condemning a message to get the people ready out of every nation altar every tongue of people ready for the coming of the Lord Oh hallelujah praise God it won't be long soon we believe in here come the years as months cut them on such weeks come the weeks as days we'll be going home we believe in here Sunday we wouldn't be coming to service every week every Sunday no we believe in here we are preaching to leave here we are living here what paul william branham you have a message that will forerun the second coming the Lord a shout to you understand the message but that's not churches are on the world it's the run before this the world has been sold what is it denomination will reap denomination so therefore everybody will Gary sodomites denomination every man every seed have to get green to be manifested for there to be a manifest every seed because the rain does just fall to bring the seeds to life or glory no God that's a spirit to come upon the Pope he don't even know he get in that the rain at the fall to anointing with that spirit and the rain after fault or not you come on oh let me go there tonight you should be so good tonight I'm not talking negative is not a negative message you know there's a positive message you know yeah we can go negative but we're not going negative we have time to talk about them oh there we talked over you hear the word I've been shown what is it the nomination will read nomination that makes them consider themselves together but the Word of God has been so long so are you ready are you really ready said to the SMSC be ready and when the Spirit of God begins to fall not if when the word of God will live in the people come on church let your mind begin to be transformed tonight let your mind be didn't renew tonight that the Spirit will surely soul that's the share the Lord that's thus here the spirit that's the see at the prophet tonight have a word for you the spirit will surely fall be careful what's eating your heart [Applause] Loreena cordovan evil people before Eve look if it would get the complete yes [Applause] [Music] [Applause] every ministers were called manifest when the fire falls because it will bring alive this see that the man was so in if he was showing himself he could read that if he was swimming his own ideas he gonna read that but if he was suing Jesus Christ he will read that because the secret is the word is in the brag that means somebody somewhere has been so in the word line of my mind yeah the elephant the prophet and the bride and the tip will say the same thing or get the Lord a shout we are convinced tonight that we are preaching the my message we are convinced tonight this is the word of God it can't fail the book is now open we could go to any Scripture and anoint him any stretch any vests I'm talking to anointed because we are the anointed to anoint it we have to say to unlock the prophecy call him and you may be seasoned John the Baptist voice of one carnival at least nobody got knowing that all the time a man wrapped up in seven organic or he's done about this with the message I know I just knowing I just think I feel like my script yes I feel it as playing last night and I read a scripture I feel like me that's an impersonation when John Gotti had no intent in cell metabolism because you are the composite wilderness the amount in seven that they are packed because when you see people and you're compromised and your human spirit upon what you're getting connect with emotions you can already behave all you want to behave go out the five emotions go to cut that off and all the conscience and affection yes because they just turn free would why you think gonna send a trainer so hot and heavy to make sure it bring out that you have a yes whether you love God or your family when you put your husband for sources if what gods say a husband disagree with it you have to forget what he said is that every man would be a lion my would be true friend or no friend friend or no friend let Christ live in me O Lord is my friend who want to go grab a Oh glory to God what shall separate me from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus where they are money or not that doesn't change who you are as we said job had what he had because of who he is but who he was god bless him god no Borden bless him and because he blessing the Lord God bless me what the trip everything would you say himself yeah because when you get a lot of stuff sometime I get over they will try okay overtake me because it lessens too much no yank here you get insensitive pride puffed up and then what this particular and off on you're moving through life on your own and join your own life until God stretch you out someday yeah stretch just a condition that the money can handle you say money running after you Monica deal with that then you need supernatural no no your prayers your prison to live and fight in the will and then you live him today glory to God my life is too short to live it up happily oh I'm going to live with the joy of the Lord I'm going to live it up freezing them summative put my best foot forward or glory to God I want to make my mark for the kingdom or glory look what it around me this Mac she committees Mike Scioscia's ladies my you Schmidt is my a mostly this back as I am it is back what about you new to me this man mostly miss MA so medium ah William animate is not what about YouTube right oh Jesus Christ don't tell me you I forget tire your mind could be renewed your thinking could change oh boy I said you're taken could change I can I will I do believe oh my so when the Spirit of God begins to fall the would would live in the people and that false bride in the false bride it gets it it know that commit adultery oh dear and brought herself in the creeds and so the boot wise will read what a confirmation of churches to be born and burn like to intestines but where the Word of God has been shown in the people's heart it will reap a bright for Christ as certain as I'm standing here where the Word of God is sown in the people's heart it will reap a bride for Christ a sinner and I'm standing here that's what a prophet said all glory the dog even first daunted it when the will come to Mary she never doubted it she said Behold the handmaid of the Lord be done on me ik wanted I word she never said no you wait and I feel life and then I go testify you wit and I'm positive about it that's the way we Christians so-called do today wait till I'm positive wait and I begin they get better I see something happen then I'll do it that's not the question you have to believe it please you have to do what so you're not with my feelings

towards any divine promise of God will bring it to pass the right mental attitude but you've got to have their attitude the attitude is what bring the results if you say yes I believe it but I don't know no that's not the right attitude the right value is to receive it and say stop seeing the Lord then it is right or glory no God don't say the Lord tell me that's right my man is gonna work out

five senses control the body five senses control your soul conscience and so forth your body cts smell on here there's only one channel to be inside of that soul you are soul body and spirit one Avenue is the free moral agency that you receive it or reject it hallelujah praise God so you know what happened the mind was chosen at the battleground the police were selected to fight because that is where the decisions are made in the mind so that is where God put it for you to get fight who would win the choice of what you accept and what you reject isn't that right the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle I cannot fight in my mind I see groans you don't understand what going on but that is the Conqueror chosen you suppose the girl fight every day that will be fighting fighting like a mushroom is just like some teddy bear yesterday we've in some ways the been yourself life it just is so why you know fighting you not press in you'll overcome in because overcoming keeps life in you oh my unity who does unity jumps yes any obstacles you catch a crime and I catch a active [Music] Oh glory to God amen Humana was chosen for the peace of the battle because we're that way it was begin that is because decisions are made from the mind the head they never started from some organization praise God and there was a woman who was sick and a pallet dear in about a rampage a message the great battle before and I keep preaching and looking at her we should not look another bite I'm finished she wore hot chic overcome rainy day on the ground no you could see what you want you seen on your seat you had that nut but in you because he only grown and she want to walk she want to come on her condition and when he finished she was free man just get up and walk off did not even pray for her she overcome right there and you could overcome right in your seat Oh glory to God nothing changes the decision you decide to save God Almighty not because of your husband not because they are children not because their mother father whatever it is but because of him he called you equality for a purpose and that purpose is about everything else all glory to God amen we are body soul and spirit the outside the body the shell inside the conscience of art and then it's the soul soul the spirit and spirit governs the other you can accept doubt or you can accept feet either one you want to work on therefore season began at the principal part that caused the spirit of man to dalgo it's worth it that's what Seton did and God begin at the principal part the lay his would in that spirit so she a time job is a contest ready to bring down so first he asked Eve what did God say what are you going so become God not talking to me and she simply saying God say we should eat to the tree but I shall not sure I wish I shall not eat because a day we eat we shall die then says you shall not surely time God knows you know when you eat that tree you shall be you know both sides which was information and knowledge and moving either way from feet because all she knows to do was believer God said as usual test it and God's originally dying so talks focused Teddy story walking I'm not accepting a different test concerning what was said if God said it I may not understand it but I believe it and as long as coming out of perfect smoke I believe it because my prophet doesn't speak his own thoughts save a property speak it it has to come to pass I don't need a full explanation of it if I got the revelation that's fine but if I still wanna start it I believe it and what he was supposed to say if this church right now can be put together knitted together with such that everyone would be in one Accord not one shuttle or anywhere there would not be a feeble please enormous in another five minutes there would not be nobody a desiring the Holy Ghost but what we receive it if we could get a certain thing fixed now there is where the battle begins right in your own mind it's not christian science mind over matter the main accepts the life which is the word of god and dear brings the life just your thought doesn't do it but the word of god brought into the channel of your thought so when the would spit down to the channel you thought my life freedom your mind accepted it grasp it what is your mind controlled by your spirit and your spirit catches the Word of God and that is what that got life in it it brings life to you when your spirit catch the Word of God then you receive it not open the informally but inwardly unwillingly you receive the Word of God you welcomed the Word of God you embrace the Word of God you receive it as God and you receive our spirit as servants of God bringing you the Word of God but over time you gotta take all we see and he seeing that gonna train words to me train wheels for you like one better felt like was Christine woods and seeing things and romantic I said well you really think I'll be time to think

we'll just one will do it you get five stone and then he ran the good night that's when you're sure you attack it he no gala he can miss that target Galahad coming on boop-boop-boop any guy on CD gonna collapse what David he's a Mad Dog is that I've seen it events that was the event that was to put fear but not even anointed talkin I talking to the speaking I speaking to so when will a star feel it about a black shadow just corner like that send an atmosphere when David said I'll cut it off light static one hit that shadow voice pusses voice with versus fools and mountain faces a point to them who's gonna win this battle David Hawk has already been turned back to the fate of the feathers that fit prophesize that's it declares that it is anointed oh boy the photo must prophesy again

life Davis and my cup runneth over Bangla Trickett half cup and then win the couplet resources the canova like your family when anybody a touch they get anyplace because this this is a tease of awkward want your life much of barely making it your PID our virtue when when Peter when Peter made a man you talking about bringing people out to take conditioned upon you that's the position you want to be in not yet uh spoken book Rises along listen to a tip rise up and more I give you your need supplier you what you are neither a [Music] [Applause] repetition of the bride again a repetition of Christ a massage let me finish please musician sober I'm talking with cleaning up the channels watch from the middle of the heart which is the soul it goes what feed in the devii channel the trouble of it is we're standing in there with a lot of doubt trying to act supported out there you've gotta stop that come down that channel with the children of God and then it goes on automatically it's only inside it's the inside that counts you said I thought the Bible says out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks it's what in your hand if you're rude and an saying back it's in your heart get it out and okay your mouth will come the right words so instead of accelerating forces on Coral you will cool it down because there is no virtue in putting an accelerant to quarrel and fasten your label crime of passion somebody gets so angry they do something under necessary and jvd rested life because of a wrong attitude and decision and think in an atmosphere what is up wasn't thinking through is it worth it of course not it wanted are in a story about a woman Jeff some dominating bore some boss always talking about not really a boss but a co-worker a terrible experience and she just couldn't get away it was a horrid Spencer I know she said she changed her thinking and asked herself what could I learn from this person so she didn't try to change him she changed herself and it comes tolerable she was able to overcome because she changed her thinking on the matter the Cyprus and the boat storm coming they sing this song and sing a special and cut the hands and so on but he didn't have fear the doctor was gone Jesus was in the boat he's tired he's sleeping and snoring he is out cold when he had enough to say go with Jesus Jesus wake up from sleep but I know in every cup holders be here sail a big one think I would have prayer exercise them to a faith and was he just weaker sleepy I peace be still and tell that storm roll up full of Eastern be stoned asleep he put away the storm and when I can sleep and say oh ye of little faith if you have faith you could do this you could do that you could do the other don't you want to have faith to do this do that to the other this is faith is a living faith now these are faith that is lies all glory to God amen so you have to close the channel when God gets a man in his hands till you can get these senses the conscience and everything in doubt until it stands with God behind it in the spirit there's not a very little work and Puka dog in there when court could get a man not even your conscience even going out the flue is so clear it shows Alleluia the open blows are wasted glory to God it shines out just clean and clear it's the fourth quarter the main is the gate to the soul the gate of the Spirit rather your mind opens up and accept the Spirit or reject the spirit you can have these conferences and little feelings and sensations all these things that has not to do with it that's just sensation but when it comes to reality your mind opens it up your mind either accept it or reject it easier God may not miss it it's your mind that open up the door or closes the door and listen to your conscience listens to your memory listens to your affection but when your mind closes itself to these things and let God the spirit of God the word come in it blows the rest of the stuff out every doctor's gone every fear is gone every sensation is doctors gone every feeling is gone nothing standard about the Word of God and see that kind of buckle against that when somebody completely blew know there is a woman a physical and there's a woman for this spirit did you believe there's a spiritual womb and there's a physical womb the mind is the womb to the spirit Oh glory to God how adultery is committed spiritually when you knowing better by the Word of God by the intercourse of your mind take a lie of the devil and again and that's what brands say when Eve receive the devil line and major changed immediately it was instant when Adam forsake the word he lost the earth immediately because court no longer control of him he had no control of the earth as long as God was in control of Adam because control the earth once he lost the control he lost the book lost the authority lost the many when the restoration of the book come the restoration of the control of God over your life that's why he said the bride will have the mind of Christ the intelligence that means the control come back over which is the headship that governed the body so when the headship comes to govern the body then God have control over you then you will have dominion over others and other things about Oh glory to God hallelujah praise be to Jesus so we are shown with the word someday it will bring the life into the earth it will replenish the earth where he failed Mary did she took the word if top sitting like Mary took God's word unto Mary seed repeat again to his bride true the word will bring up the Millennium therefore on the same thesis she could take God's Word and said God said not to do it get away from here not what I mean alright but instead she tried to hide it with seat in line Mary didn't do that she said be done unto me I wanted I would oh my hallelujah watch I'm almost done they're talking about the latter rain not the scattered you laughter in between that's not nothing if the Lateran would have been here the poor glow destructing she would have struck the world then loitering is fixin to come and I say tonight the latter rain is fixin to come Oh glory to God we have got to do something to make ourselves in it keep your hands off of it let God do it take his word believe it wallet in your heart and when the real biggest of all life will take a whole and the word will manifest itself normally factor in hallelujah no manufacturing just speak in the word and I was listen to our tape we were I'm talking about he preached the wood and people just was healed just like the boot being preached this is what I look in the scene not even hands me he look at not even hands laid not hands laid just the word going for hallelujah the promise was not only made to Abraham and his seed not his seed Isaac it field it proved it did but the seed the faith that he had here we go no matter what the circumstances was how against nature it was how much the doctor said it was and so Abraham had the promise given to him when it was impossible oh praise God and if the church is soared with something else beside the word it can't go to meet him he hasn't got a free body with fungus on it he's got a perfect body he's the perfect word and the church will be showed and believed in the perfect word and the perfect word and the perfect world will unite together one flesh one body husband and wife I am NOT even in myself I believe it that you know the former rain man thought there we go the faith the rain is fixin to fall what is going to bring for you watch the same Sun that rises in the West is when horizon with watch the Sun is should know in the Western Hemisphere - what there we go to ripen the seed that has been planted to bring forth a bride if you do not have those seeds to pay something if you do not have those seeds if you're here tonight and you're not a Christian maybe you belong to church don't you take that chance brother don't you listen to those things that's a hybrid of fear the Word of God has got to live a new supremely like I did in Jesus Christ for he is the head is but it can't be one thing I said another you have to get the seed so when we talk about the same P this 11th hour Gentile worker it means that that worker got the word because the word is the spirit that work I received the word you have to have this season you to leave here nothing much short of it up years ago Diaz people came from other groups and so on and they were so ignorant of this message I was so ashamed the whole kind of foolishness economy man ideas that was teaching a man preaching to them and when I kind of share stuff they didn't know what the message said listen but around which the entire nation from just the revelation but there are certain greater promises that you must receive and this is what we're trying to get the finda seeds to show because that is what we're going to anoint when the spread began to move into looking for those seeds think about it now God know what he said to the Prophet the spirit do what was spoken so the spirit know what you're gonna fall on the son of mice will come up the Abrams will come up every see gonna come up in the rain at the for philosophy is a sink everything I wish Stein you know really begin to fall the bride could be saved they still looking for missing
