every one of you here this morning and this morning I have a special tape I'd like to share with you and a prophecy from the message of Grace I like to present to you this morning because I believe that this prophecy have to do with this end time bride you know sometimes you listen to a message and you might hear a prophecy and just let it go by but this one is a little different so at this time I want to I want to get that prophecy on the audio and the writing of the prophecy again I have spoken to you this morning by my spirit again calling to your remembers that I will talk to you this morning by the voice of my Prophet I have given him a message this morning that my speaking be strange to him yet it has been ordained of me that your understanding might be made fruitful that you might look upon my work of righteousness and I'm working in my church this day that your hearts might be lifted up that your understanding might be made fruitful that you might be recepted to these things that I'm going to speak to you this morning that you might become encouraged in the way that I Des are you to walk in that you might lift up your voices in praise and thanksgiving to me at the close of this service and know that I have been here that my spirit is in the midst of you even now look unto me the true and the Living God because I'm standing in the midst this morning I'm rejoicing with you in my spirit and I will lift you this morning by my strong right hand to the place where you can let the said and walk beside me in Heavenly places because my desire this morning is to you that your hearts might be lifted up that you might Rejoice with me in spirit and gain this Mighty knowledge and this spiritual wisdom and the understanding that you are going to need when the time comes of the persecutions that's going to come just before I Rapture my bride you will not endure my wrath my children but persecutions will come upon you and will Bes set you on many sides you will be tried you lift up your hands and raise your voices in my behalf and testify when the going is hard I will come down and witness to you I will W over you the evil devices of the wicked one because I have spoken to you for my spirit and if you will listen to my voice as I believe in you this morning you will have no cause to regret it thus sa my spirit amen praise the Lord so just want to go over the words a bit I will put on a tape and you'll hear it back again so the first part was the speaking in tongues and the other part you hear was the interpretation interpretation again I have spoken to you this morning by my spirit again calling to your remembrance that I will talk to you this morning by the voice of my Prophet I have given him a message this morning that might even seem strange to him yet it has been ordained of me that your understanding might be made fruitful that you might look upon my work of righteousness that I am working in my church this day that your height might be that your heart might be lifted up that your understanding might be made fruitful that you might be Reed acceptive to these things that I'm going to speak to you this morning that you might become encouraged in the way that I desire for you to walk in that you might lift up your voices in praise and thanksgiving to me in the close of this service and know that I have been here and my spirit is in the midst of you even now look unto me the true and living God because I am standing in the midst this morning I am rejoicing with you in my spirit and I will lift you this morning by my strong right hand in the place where you can represent and walk beside me in Heavenly places because my desire this morning is unto you that your hearts might be lifted up that you might Rejoice with me in spirit and gain it it is gain this Mighty knowledge and this spiritual wisdom and the understanding that you are going to need need when the time comes so this wasn't for the group that was listening hearing that then this is for this group here amen let me read it again that you might Rejoice with me in spirit and gain this Mighty knowledge and the spiritual wisdom and the understanding that you are going to need when the time comes and the persecution that is going to come just before I Rapture my bride so if the people in this message think that because of the pressure I want to go I want to go home all glory that's not what we saying that's not what is taught there's a process and this what people don't want to identify there's a process and that is why I feel that this is very weighted this morning to share this with you listen to these words next you will not endure my wrath my children God rra is different you know this is persecution they not the rra of God that's something different you will not endure my wrath my children let me interject this here part of God's nature and we read that sometime back that God doesn't judge a man before was warning him that's just how he is before somebody gets taken off the Earth God warns them that's course's nature part of God's nature is that he's longsuffering the Bible talk about the longsuffering and it is a Noah so God is very patient you know we get impatient we get vexed we write off somebody we finish with them we done God is not like that because he have no rejoicing in the death of a sinner what he wants people to is to come to repentance he has no desire for people to a sin you know he want them to come to repentance so he has a burden and he has this long suffering that he bear long with people foolishness and nonsense and everything else until he says the cup of the iniquity is not even full so so when people cup of iniquity is being filled up he is H hoping that they come to repentance if they come to repentance it emptied out but when it come full he had to deal with that now because the cup is full I have to deal with all that behavior now because the cup is not full are you understand what I'm saying then so he says here now you will not Endo my wrath my children but persecution will come upon you and beset you on many SIDS you will be tried you will lift up your hands and raise your voices on my behalf and testify when the going gets hard I will come down and witness through you I will ward off of you the evil devices of the wicked one because I have spoken to you by my spirit and if you would listen to my voice that I am bringing to you this morning you will have no cause to regret it thus sayeth my spirit could we praise the Lord this morning amen and amen okay just two little captions and we go straight into the tape God can take the vest Sinner and make him white as snow and don't have to ask anybody about it because he is Sovereign did you get that the violent sinner the worst condition you can think about God could take that and correct that and don't have to appe peep to nobody that's the God we serve why he is Sovereign so God could sovereignly heal you this morning sovereignly deliver you this morning sovereignly free you this morning sovereignly baptize you this morning sovereignly bless you this morning whatever it is he could do it for you this morning without asking anybody permission or any sister or or any brother if he could or should bless you oh give the Lord some Praises this morning think of it love and grace is Twin Sisters twin sisters you can't have Grace without having love de twin sisters before you can have Grace you have to have love before you can actually show somebody a favor you love them right or wrong you have to love them anyhow so love and grace is the same thing they are sisters love and grace we can't see one without the other so God so Lov the world he gave his only begotten son he shed Grace abroad into our hearts through the Holy Ghost there is just nothing you can do without working one with another grace of God is what saves us and then he read the scripture and you're going to hear it about the two olive trees and and what are these know my Lord and he said not by might nor my PA but my spirit there's the next prophecy here from the word he says okay now we read further that zerbu zerel has laid the foundation with his hands he shall also bring forth The Headstone I want you to notice he never said he shall bring forth the Cornerstone he shall bring forth The Headstone that's what we're looking for right now The Headstone to cap the pray in our lives The Headstone to anoint and empower the church just as the Beast have a image and the image will come to life the bride have a image look at right there that image there will come to life that image is his statue of perfect man before the Beast come into action the the Beast have to be empowered and before you come to action you have to be empowered do you understand this thing is real there's not fancy and fairy tale this is the word This Can't Fail God can't lie the prophecies will come to pass all right here we go he shall bring forth The Headstone and we know the scripture say that Jesus is the Chief Cornerstone he is also the headstone now if you will think for a few minutes this is but Brom now he's drilling down that the seven Church his messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers am and then he explains it in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit so the church was built by word word word word word but he promised Hallelujah do you see it now there's a prophecy here now he promised that the church will be rebuilt under the power of the spirit amen not by might not by power but by my spirit sayth the Lord not by organization not by denomination but by the Holy Spirit God will bring forth the church in the last days so God will speak by this message it's a powerful message uh uh uh hold on to every word but Shan just go straight into it now oh by the grace of God the message is the message of Grace God bless you thank you brother NE Lord bless you good morning friends certainly a privilege to be here again this morning in the service of the Lord and just sorry that we don't have any room to place the people in the little Church it doesn't hold very much but we are very glad that you're here and willing to make sacrifice to to be patiently to wait on us and we'll do our very best to bring you the word of the Lord the best that we know how to bring it and now I just this little lady just walking in and she had a baby to be dedicated this morning and then she seemed that it was kind of running late and she said she'd just wait I never seen the woman before but I pray that God will bless her and give her the riches of His blessings in her heart because of her being patiently to wait now it's coming time of the year want to get cooler and it won't be so hot when we're jammed up in the church and we are trusting that God will richly bless all of you now I would like to say just the a few things here just before I speak I had given out that I was going to speak this morning at the Lord willing on the subject of the winds in the Whirl wind but he just changed it for me I never know what I'm going to say until uh just maybe a few minutes before coming to the meeting and I've tried the second time now on that subject and I failed to get the answer back from God I don't know why I always like as all you ministers here know that you have to wait on the Lord for what you're going to say last evening on the private line I had a a call come all the way from down somewhere in Arkansas some people wanted to move up here this next week said they heard we was going to start a meeting on the Seven Seals I just got through the seven Church ages to The Strangers and her husband is coming Monday to get him a job in Louisville so he could work while they stayed close enough to hear those Seven Seals I said that take about 3 months lately we don't have any place here to advertise a meeting and so forth nothing take care of it you're in the city nothing for to seat the people I'd like to sometime maybe if God being willing to uh have that out in the campaign somewhere set up about a 3 months meeting and just start right through those seals like that out in the campaign and people could just stay right through it and here it runs from the sixth chapter of Revelations through the 19th so you get the Seven Seals the seven plages the three walls the woman setting on the Scarlet cover Beast 144,000 oh there's just so much of it goes in to tie those before the seventh um seal is given seventh plague Falls seventh trumpet sounds and there so many of those things that all tie that together and each one of them is a great day lesson in itself now let us bow our heads just a moment for a word of [Music] [Applause] prayer before we pray would there be some in here would like to be remembered in this prayer and you would make known by raising up your hands and in your heart thank to God just what you have need of now I pray that he will give it to you Almighty and gracious God who is the prayer answering God a father that knows all his children has need of you notice before we were born and you have our footsteps numbered the very hairs of our head are numbered and our words are all weighed in th bounds so Lord God let us this morning take heed to these things this solemn obligation that we have before thee many of those hands is raised up this morning here in this little assembly perhaps was for prayer for their sick bodies a lost loved one thou knowest their hearts and all that is within them for when you good year on the earth in form of a human being called Jesus our lord you know the very secret of the heart everything that the people could imagine in their minds you could tell them right back what they were thinking about why reason ye in your heart of these things Jesus perceived their thoughts and we read in the scripture that thou art the same yesterday today and forever and it is also written that wherever two or three are assembl together there I'll be in their midst so you're here this morning in the form of the Holy Spirit and know ever desire that's on the people's heart I pray thee father God that you'll speak back to them and say it is finished your request has been answered and I I'm sending you the Assurance this day that all that you have asked for has been granted God we remember especially those who are unsaved raised up their hand may this be the hour that they'll receive Christ as their savior before the meeting closes today May there be something happened Lord that would bring your presence so close to the people that they would know that that same Jesus that walked in Galilee stands in the midst of his people amen they might go away from here today with the same assurance that those who came from EMAs that time when they were on the road back after walking with him all day long talking to him and him talking to them and yet they had a little idea that it was him oh God so many times we are like that you speak to us in the setting of the Sun in the singing of the birds in the rustling of the leaves in the blooming of the flowers in the hymns of the church and we so little recognize that it's you in the sick rooms in the hospital many other places you speak to us and we so little realize that it's you now Lord as we return to our homes this morning may we like they did recognize may you do something today in our midst just like you did back there hallu they knew the thing that you did there before them you did it before your crucifixion and they didn't knew that that was the Risen Lord they went back to their groups rejoicing and praising God for they knew that he was alive and they said did not our hearts burn within us as he talked to us along the road Lord You're appearing there and doing something like you did before your crucifixion proved your resurrection that you was the same Jesus it caed them to remember all their conversation with you you've talked with us all week Lord now appear in our midst and make yourself KNN to each needy heart for we ask it in Jesus name and for his sake amen am again I have spoken to you this morning by my spirit again calling to your remembrance that I will talk to you this morning by the voice of my Prophet I have given him a message this morning that my speaking be strange to him yet it has been ordained of me that your understanding might be made fruitful that you might look upon my work of righteousness and I'm working in my church this day that your hearts might be lifted up that your understanding might be made fruitful that you might be receptive to these things that I'm going to speak to you this morning that you might become encouraged in the way that I desire you to walk in that you might lift up your voices in praise and thanksgiving to me at the close of this service and know that I have been here that my spirit is in the midst you even now look unto me the true and the Living God because I'm standing in the midst this morning I'm rejoicing with you in my spirit and I will lift you this morning by my strong right hand at the place where you can LIF set and walk beside me in Heavenly places because my desire this morning is into you that your hearts might be lifted up that you might Rejoice with me in spirit and gain this Mighty knowledge in spiritual wisdom and the understanding that you're going to need when the time comes of the persecutions that's going to come just before I Rapture my bride you will not endure my wrath my children but persecutions will come upon you and Bes set you on many s side you will be tried but you lift up your hands and raise your voices in my behalf and testify when the going is hard I will come down and witness to you I willward off you the evil devices of the wicked one because I have spoken to you for my spirit and if you will listen to my voice since I plead in you this morning you will have no cause to regret it thus say my spirit thank you now the congregation shall pray Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us of our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen [Music] that if my pen should be a sculptures tool and my paper would be flint and these words that I say now should be engraved upon this that it might go to All Peoples God's holy spirit has strange ways of dealing with his people many times Sue wonders and through gifts and callings which are without repentance that God gives them to his people by his grace I'm home now kind of a little vacation like I usually take this time at home for along this time of year C I like to relax when I go squirrel hunting now I've been down in Kentucky with my friends this week squirrel hunting my favorite spot somehow I was discouraged not exactly because I could find no squirrels but I just felt discouraged something was telling me I must return home and I slept in the car coming back last year as all of you know which is on print and also in testimon into tapes I was sitting at a place here in Indiana where the Lord God came down and spoke to me that my second Ministry that was ready to take place in the near future and there was spoken into existence Three Squirrels all of you know the story I'm sure somehow going up the road I while I let the rest of the boys off goinging Hunting I I had a strange feeling to go to this place again it was before daylight raining I didn't even know whether they get to hunt or not but that I would get over in the field there hunting means to get along to yourself to pray and I stopped the car and got off and walked across the road and went over into the bush and just before it would have been daylight it's kind of gray Dawn I'd stopped and it all for a little word of prayer as usual in telling father that just what I have need of to provide it I don't believe in wasting anything or destroying never shot a bird in my life for a target practice or anything else what I hunt I eat or give to someone that does eat it I don't believe in wasting anything I don't believe in doing those things because it's not right then as I turned and started along a familiar little pathway by the side of a pastor that crossed over to an L shape in the woods that something strange took place all my experiences I've never had anything like that I looked at the top of the hill to my left from where I was standing and they're coming up out of a like the top of the hill came three rainbows and they were running some 30t high first I looked and seen the light and I just turned back because I thought it might be the sun raising on the second thought it wasn't towards the sun it was towards the South and another thing it was smooth cloudy rain raining all over that was August the 25th last Friday morning and you know how it was raining and it's smooth clouds everywhere and I looked again and there it was growing taller and taller three rainbows I took off my hat I sat down my gun I started walking towards it with my hands up something you seemed to tell me this is close enough I was going to sit down and take off my boots that I had on to see if I could walk a little closer but I got within a few yards of it and I seen the color of it missing like a fog moving around I Stood Still for a few moments is coming right out of the top of the little mountain and I watched as the three one to the right one to the left and one in the center running down into one bowl L every what it was was alive it was moving and making its motions and I stood there just as it was graying Dawn I turned and looked again and I screamed out oh God what would you have your servant know just then the spirit of the Lord came in and said Jesus of the New Testament is Jehovah of the old he only changed his mask from Spirit to man that was confirming of course my message of him amen letting me know assured that these 31 years hasn't been in vain as I started to approach it began to go away went down into this bow like Affair and then disappeared I walked up close I was afraid to go any closer because he'd stopped me before I got there I turned to notice that that light the way it was shining for me was just exactly in line with the tree where I set last year where the squirrels appeared some 35 or 40 minutes later I went down through the woods and over the creek bottoms and so forth till I got to this tree that separates in four directions east north west and south four prongs of the tree running out and I climb into this prong and sit down where I was when he told me of that scripture if you say to this mountain be moved Hallelujah and as I stood there a little bit not thinking yet of the rainbow it had left my mind I stood there and this has been a very bad year for squirrel hunting uh everything is late no squirrels I thought right here is where God gave me them squirrels last year to speaking to existence I took off my hat again and I said Lord God you are still the same Jesus you are still God and something said to me how many do you need this time I said just as I did the other time the limit and then I said I shall have this limit before 10:00 today and strange as it seems just then I was in a very bad mosquito area where it was invested with mosquitoes and kind of a swamp land the great big mosquito came to bite me right by the eye and I said not one of them will bother me this day no repellent or anything with me and before I knew it I said the sun will shine within 30 minutes and no more than i' said that till just behind me a squirrel exactly like that in last year Young Red jumped out on the limb about 70 yard away and began barking I turned around at those long distance I could barely through the powerful scope see his eye just shocked that's all I didn't even have aim at no more than over the squirrel and the bullet would just exactly smack with the eye where it was the other time on down through the woods I went and it exactly 3 minutes of 10:00 I shot my third squirrel just like it was last year just exactly the same at 3 minutes before 10 amen God being my solemn judge not one mosquito even Buzz all day long right where they just tons of them I suppose that they could be weighed out and I never even seen or heard one I was listening for them to see if I could and I heard a huming I thought there's one somewhere and I listened and it was a truck way back on the highway and exactly 30 minutes from that time the sun Shone out good and bright amen and I came back to the place and I've been thinking when I said limit that meant five squirrels which is the limit in Indiana but I remember last year when he asked me how many did it take for me a mess I said three and I just got the three so yesterday I went back was going to the same place again and something something said do not go across the road and at exactly 10:00 on the exact dot 10:00 with my watch I shot the Indiana limit the fifth squirrel amen I want you to notice there was three rainbows and there was three things said Three Squirrels gotten there was three things Three Squirrels by 10:00 no mosquitoes the sun would shine in 30 minutes and U there were three to give witness of it brother Banks Woods my son Billy Paul and his son David to give witness to it when I seen them rainbows about as wide across as that Halo is that angel of the Lord but there were three of them running into one oh how it helped my heart to know that God Jesus is not just a man as people think he is just the prophet as this modern idea today thinks that Jesus is just a prophet he's Jehovah of the Old Testament made flesh and dwelt Among Us Hallelujah there that sure did comfort me then thinking on that subject that God had s so many people now there is a group of people call themselves The Oneness or the Jesus only I don't agree with them upon their Theory neither do I agree with that trinitarian group that says that there are three different gods the extreme of the trinitarian but I believe that the three Father Son and Holy Ghost is one amen that they are three offices of one God he lived in the fatherhood in the pillar of fire he lived in the sunship in Jesus Christ and he lives now in the Holy Ghost in his church the same Lord Jesus that was made flesh and dwelt Among Us is with us this day amen Among Us in the form of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah of all the experience when I turned first and seen thinking first it could be the sun peep through a cloud somewhere but it was before the suntime then when I turned back again and seen it wasn't a light it was rainbows and then when I looked and seen that I become numb all over just someone said to me did not you feel like shouting no I didn't feel like shouting those experiences never make you feel like shouting they just make you feel anchored just where that you know that there's something that tells you just a satisfied feeling now those things are truth I know we have things that said that many times some people say I don't believe in such stuff as that I can't voucher for that I don't know I can only voucher for what I know to be the truth and God Almighty who wrote this Bible and I his servant he knows that that is the truth think of it that the day that we are living in just before the coming of the Lord Jesus said there will be signs in the skies and in the earth great sights flying saucers missiles perplex of time distress between the Nations and fearful sights upon the Earth and we're living in that day to see those things now for the message this morning that I have chosen I want you to turn with me in the scriptures over to Zachariah it was my Zachariah the the 4th chapter I is my desire to tell you these things many times things happen that I don't U don't speak it don't say it but this was too outstanding for me to keep it from the church amen it must be told and before God who I stand it's the truth amen hallelujah I know that there is a God and I know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God Emmanuel dwelling amongst his people today in the form of the Holy Spirit and I know that the coming of the Lord is drawing nigh when signs and wonders are appearing ammen we just got through the seven Church ages and learning that we're in the last and latest seean Church age when the church would be indiffer get cold denominate and be organized organizations would take it over eat it up but a promise that there'd be a little Remnant left there would be a church it would be scattered abroad everywhere but God would gather it together and Rapture it into Glory amen a little Sanctified group somewhere waiting on the Lord praise His name then the other day when I got Daniel 70 weeks standing right here in the pull pit something struck me I've never been able to get away from it to see the hour that we're living in I want to go somewhere and do something else keep it off my mind I got too many loved ones that's unsaved knowing what can I do to get them saved what Israel I can do I have preached the gospel God has done great signs and wonders like he's never done since the world since the days of the Lord Jesus as he never did it in all the history of time and around the world it's went and still the world continually gets worse but then I have to remember that we're living in the lady oan Church age where they will get worse and it said they would then I chose the morning being that that message was so attacked and another thing that I'm so gotten after about is preaching Grace I want to speak on that this morning as I read the fourth chapter of Zechariah a portion of it and the angel that talked with me came again and awakened me as a man that is waken out of sleep and he said unto me what seest thou and I said I have looked and behold a Candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps there on and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees by one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof so I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my Lord and the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and I said no my Lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord of host do you see the message will not come by some great mights or Powers but by the spirit of God last verse seventh verse who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shouting crying Grace Grace unto it Hallelujah Grace Grace unto it we are all acquainted with this scripture that reads the Bible we know that this was during the time of the preparation of the restoration of the temple anzer was a great Prince amongst the people who had laid the foundation of the building now you want you to put on your spiritual thinking anointing jacket this morning as we think and this great Prince had determined to rebuild the house of the Lord and then when he did he had laid the foundation stone and as we read on farther we find out that God said zerubabel has laid the foundation with his hands he also shall bring forth The Headstone amen I want you to notice he never said he shall bring forth the Cornerstone he shall bring forth The Headstone and we know that the scripture says that Jesus is the Chief Cornerstone and he's also the headstone now if we will think for a few minutes that the seventh Church m messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit Hallelujah not by power not by might but by my spirit sayeth the Lord not by organization not by denomination but by the Holy Spirit God will bring forth the church in the last days hallelujah zerubabel the prince with Joshua was the one that was to Bringing forth this headstone he had laid the foundation he had tuck the people back to the foundation in tight which we all know that these candlesticks and so forth represented both Jewish and church they were Olive branches the Bible said here and the Olive Branch we are the wild branch that was grafted into the root of the tamed Olive Tree Gentile and out of these two branches come sensor pipes going into the seven golden candlesticks to give life to the seven Church ages now remember in our teaching on the lessons that we just been through that we took the Great Pyramid and studied that for a while that Enoch must have built and The Headstone was never put in the pyramid I've been there the architectur of it could never be replaced to this day we have no machines that could build a pyramid no powers less the atomic power that could build pyramid because it's too gigantic stone that will weigh tons and tons and tons stands way in the air so put together that even a thin razor blade cannot and they're not cemented they're just cut so that they Join one with another that's the way the body of Jesus Christ should be so cut by the Holy Spirit but God's Great instrument and tool that we be joined as one person we are not divided we should be one person and it goes to show that no Machinery can do that that way it takes God to do that no mechanics of organization no lodges none of these things can ever do it as good as their intentions are they can never do it because that it takes God to do this the Holy Spirit I don't think I have a dollar bill in my pocket but there is yes I do I have a dollar bill I'm sorry on the back of this dollar bill you'll see the Seal of the United States on the left side looking towards you from me it be on the left side yours is right it's the eagle and also in there the coat of arms and so forth but on this side here right side to me you see the pyramid and you notice above the pyramid is the Capstone and beneath there says the Great Seal even on our currency that we have to recognize no Infidel can stamp out Christianity every letter that you date dates the birth of our Lord every calendar everything speaks of him even on our currency The Headstone which is Christ why did not they put the headstone on the pyramid because the headstone was rejected when he come but now according to the prophecy there will come The Headstone amen now I want you to notice that when The Headstone comes the prince that's going to cry out the message will cry Grace Grace Hallelujah for it's by grace are we saved that not of works any man should boast Hallelujah and the message of Grace has been traed under the feet of man until it's become a disgrace some of them runs out into eternal security some runs out into everything but the true message of Grace Remains the Same and there where Satan tries to knock it out from the church but it's the grace of God that we're all saved by so in the deity of Jesus Christ if the Lord God could come there and confirm that that is the truth not only that but by his word he confirms it the truth and by signs and wonders he confirms it's the truth then all so Grace is the truth then why could anyone criticize and say that Grace is wrong that we're saved by works we are saved by grace that through faith not by works works shows that you have been saved but what saves you is the grace of God grace saves you Grace is what God does for you works is what you do for God to show appreciation of what God did for you but by grace are you saved some people thinks because I go jar Church put my name on the book that's all I have to do some people thinks because I shout that's all I have to do do others think because I speak with tongues that's all I have to do some thinks because I got power to heal the sick that's all I have to do it's not it's a grace of God that saves you amen God's Amazing Grace Hallelujah I could not trust in any marriage some said oh there's a great man that man I've heard him stand up and do this I've heard him stand up and do that Paul said in 1 Corinthians 13 though I speak with tongue of man and Angels though I I have discernment though I have gifts to feed I'll take all my goods to feed the poor though I can move mountains with faith though I have knowledge to understand all things I am nothing the love comes in which is Grace Hallelujah God has to do it you can do all these things and still be lost it's Grace that saves you God's grace to the human race Hallelujah the think of him I was thinking of that Grace immediately after that appeared Friday morning just at the break of day up there in that field when I sit on a log later in tears come down in my eyes thought oh God your grace is stoop to save me why did you ever have such pity upon a poor illiterate wret like myself how did you ever come down to our humble little Tabernacle or peace and people of low Walk of Life poor have nothing in this world and still your grace is spread AB in our hearts by the holy spirit that you heal our sickness and save our sinsu save us from our sins rather and make us your people deal with us then I thought of David how that when he took a otion to build a house unto the Lord said it's not right for me to live in a house of Cedar and the Ark of the Covenant of my God under sheep skins and a tabernacle God told the prophet go tell my servant David I Tu you from the Sheep coat from feeding them few sheep out there of your daddies and made you a great name like great man in the earth I thought of the grace of God how that he could do that save to the uttermost Hallelujah and then would take a poor Rich like myself and give me the opportunity to preach the gospel and to see others saved see them healed see homes that's been broke up straightened up again see lives has been ruined made right again and they give me Grace IO oh it's amazing grace amen then come to a DE gred low squirrel Hunter out into the woods and form himself in a form of the rainbow which means a covenant with a message that he gave me to preach and form it there in a covenant that he's behind it he'll be behind it because the message is of Jesus Christ Hallelujah his glory how he's let me go all over the world around the world to the Nations to the millions of people seen Millions coming to the Lord and accept him as personal savior seen him filled with his goodness and Sanctified by his power Hallelujah see him healed by his great omnipotent power then I can cry like the prophet and said it's not by power not by might but it's by the spirit of God hallelujah not by education not by theology but by the spirit of God he saves the People by the spirit of God he heals the people it's a spirit of God that gives a message to the people it's the spirit of God that confirms the word we've got theologians today we've got doctors of divinity we've got great man all over the world Hallelujah that's smart intelligent and educated but it takes a Simplicity of believing God to make his word speak out to show that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen takes a humble heart dedicated to God bring Jesus Christ unto present s amen hallelujah if it taken theology what would the Presbyterian Methodist Baptist Catholic and so forth we wouldn't have a chance us poor unlearned people but it doesn't take knowledge not the power or the might but by my spirit sayith God I'll unfold this mystery amen hallelujah and he'll cry to it Grace Grace was shoutings and crying Hallelujah that's what it is today God's Amazing Grace to his people how he takes the illiterate the unlearned and shows that Jesus is the same when he came he never come to the great theologians neither did he go to caas as a high priest only to be condemned by him but he Tau fisherman man over poor in Walk the common life so there he revealed himself and said follow me and I'll make you pictures of manall show that his grace still reach down even from the Jews to the Gentiles to call a people for his name in this last day as we have just been through an amazing grace How Sweet the Sound GL Grace is old Grace is as old as the world is Grace was first shto the human race when we had a beginning of the human race when the human race was first created in the Garden of Eden on that dark morning when that little woman had stepped across the separating line and had gone against God's Commandments and enticed her husband to do the same thing and the law was broken the law must have a penalty or it isn't no law the law was the day you eat thereof that day you shall surely die remember the first judgment seat was up on the earth and it was in the Garden of Eden and the last judgment seat will be upon the Earth at the end time the white Throne Hallelujah but when Jehovah come down I could imagine there wasn't even a star to shine it was so dark in that light little garden that once was because sin had blotted him out had taken the light from among them that's what's the matter with the church churches today that's what's matter with the peoples today sin has blotted out the light of the Living God show Christ still the same yesterday and forever and he lives to save to the uttermost and to heal to the Lord's sick person Hallelujah yes we oh how it was terrible that morning Darkness hanging in the garden I'd imagine fog of black sack cloth I'd imagine every leave never moved there was no wind stirring it was darkness and terrible because sin had blotted out amen that come Jehovah down like a roar of Thunder walking through the garden crying Adam Where Art Thou that's when Adam realized he is naked and had sinned before God he hid himself and tried to make himself a religion but it didn't work God killed some sheep Tu the skins and showed that something had to die to cover sin jining church will never cover sin no dry confession will ever cover sin it takes sorrow and repentance and the grace of God to cover sin while the blood of Jesus Christ the one that God killed at Calvary to cover sin there in the garden that morning When sin was so black Jehovah come in there stood his couple standing condemned there would be no more human race they had to die death on the human race give the world back to wild beast and there have been no human race but in that darkest of hour in that time when all hopes is gone Grace come pouring through Hallelujah said I'll give you a savior and Messiah oh it's a wonder how God could ever do it God's Amazing Grace in the Garden of Eden that give him the promise of a just one who could come through the woman the woman's seed shall bruise the Serpent's head the guilty one and his head shall bruise her heel shall there be an Affliction to the church but he promised a Triumph what provided a savior Grace Grace hallelujah what could they show to Mary Grace what could they show to do it the Army expression excuse it I only want to make it from a pull pit there to make a point passing the buck Adam said the woman you give me did it the woman said the serpent beg me one laid it to another there was no hopes for him but God provided Grace and it come breaking through and he said but I'll Make A Way somehow I'll save you regardless you've done wrong you've trespassed my laws and my laws will have to be the Judgment from my laws will have to be executed therefore it will have to be death because I've said death now my Christian friends and these tape here that's being made will spread across the world let me ask you something you who try to make God be three gods are you who try to make him to be one like your finger he's one in person it would not be right for God to make an angel die he could not be the right kind of a judge and make an angel die for a human being that still doesn't cure it because his great law demands death and something's got to die and an angel can't die neither could he say Eve because you caused Adam to do this I'll make you die let Adam live because Adam was partaker also amen like someone said was justified he washed his hands you can't wash the blood of Jesus Christ off your hands you'll never leave this building this morning and go to heaven if you die in your sins on your hands so it isn't right there was only one just way there's only one way that could be God's Great Law demands could be met he had to meet it himself amen he he had to do it God's a spirit and he can't die am so God had to be made man and he died in human flesh in the form of a man called Jesus Christ and that was the promised Messiah that brought the grace there where you see that God in Christ is the same person God dwelling in Christ I am my father and one my father dwells in me not me that speak of the word but my father that dwelleth in Me God in Christ certainly the grace was PR in the Garden of Eden and Grace came Grace to Adam and Eve no where to go no which way to turn and yet Grace made way amen let me say this my sinner friend you may be here this morning a prostitute you may be here this morning a woman Chaser you may be here a drunker or a gambler or a murderer you might be here as an impure husband an impure wife you might be the bolest of Sinner you say I'mma pass that stage of redemption no you're not or you wouldn't be at the church this morning Hallelujah Grace will make a way for you this dark hour if you'll just accept it Adam had to be willing to accept it so do you accept it the grace of God reached over in Noah's time Noah just an ordinary man he and his family but because Noah feared God he believed God you can't fear God without believing how can you fear something you don't believe am you've got to fear God Solomon said the fear of God's beginning of wisdom yes amen now just the fear of God you're beginning to have wisdom and the fear of God Noah feared the Lord and he believed the Lord amen and that's what God honors is your faith him that's right then when the fear of God come upon Noah God called him by grace and saved him in his house because it was Grace that did it not because Noah was a great big handsomer man than all the rest of them not because Noah went to the best Church there was in the country not because he belonged to the best in organization not because he could dress better not because he had more money not because he is some special person but because of the grace of God God saved Noah Grace saved Noah not his works but his grace and also saved his family we call another character where God's grace was extended many of them we just speak of a few Abraham Abraham no special man come down from the Tower of Babel perhaps come out of an idolatry Bunch his father come down in the land of shanar down there to dwell in a city of AA and while he was there God spoke to him by Grace not because he's different not because he's a better man but by Grace God call him Bible clearly makes that known oh Abraham how Abraham tested God's patience told him said Abraham stay in this land don't you go out of it but as soon as a famine come Abraham run Abraham spoke of us God take God took Abraham by grace and saved him and that's how he takes you by grace and how do we test these patients today we're up tomorrow we're down one day we believe the next day we're wandering today we're a Methodist tomorrow we're a Baptist today we believe in Divine Healing tomorrow to tummy a comes and we don't know where we believe it or not but yet in the midst of all that God wants us to stay put but he saves us anyhow if it was the grace of God we'd all be gone sure God Saves Us by his grace Abraham was supposed to stay in that land but he went down into this child ends or not child ends but the Philistines went down there to souljourn to get out of the famine things are a little hard up in his country so he went down there to Journey down there with them done exactly what God told him not to do but yet the grace of God appeared to him kept Pharaoh from the uh the king from taking his wife grace of God when Abraham said it's my sister lied about it but yet the grace of God held him because he repented amen he was willing to repent and anybody's willing to repent the grace of God still goes for you the grace of God is churching for you so that goes for you backsliders this morning Hallelujah the grace of God is still looking for you if you'll just repent God's grace is sufficient I good old Abraham brought him back and remember Abraham was not saved by his Works he was saved by grace Abraham was saved by faith which is Grace and God saved Abraham because of his grace not because of his behavior he saved him because of his Grace amen oh how good he was saved by grace let's take Israel I've got a scripture written down here I write it down that I can just refer to it in my mind if you want to put it down this will be a good one to remember if you want to Deuteronomy 7:7 um God gave Abraham uh his promise or gave not Abraham pardon me gave asrael and told him if you will not associate with idolatry if you will not do these things if you will stay away from all these Pagan ceremonies if you'll do all these things then I'll bring you to a good land I'll take care of you I'll feed you I'll lead you I'll do these things if you do such and such if you'll love me if you'll keep my Commandments my statutes my ordinances I'll do all these things if you'll just do something keep my Commandments and love me just like a husband taking a wife and saying if you'll be a good woman if you'll take care of the house if you'll be true to me if you'll keep my clothes clean if we have children if you'll be a mother to them if you'll do things I'll work till my hands bleed to make you living if you'll do it but then think what if that woman turns WR look lazy won't work won't do nothing then it takes Grace to keep that family together oh God it taken the grace of Jehovah to keep his family together that's the only way we're Jehovah's family today is because of the grace of Jesus Christ we'd all be gone but it's Grace oh [Music] Grace now but they didn't keep it but they were never did come to the full promise not that generation no the one that promis is made to perished in the wilderness but God fed him God took care of him God loved him he moved around why his grace did it his grace because of his promise his promise and the grace that went with his promise but they never did come to the full value of The Promise Land and neither does this church come to its full value the grace of God holds us but he wants to get a church that'll obey a people that'll take his word and say it's a truth regardless of your Argan ation he wants a people that will not say well I'm just as good as you are I'm Presbyterian I'm Methodist I'm Catholic I'm as good as you are that's not Grace that shows you something wrong but a person regardless that'll read God's word and see that you've got to be born again and filled with the Holy Ghost they'll believe that they'll take it by the word they'll take the word exactly what it says like in baptisms from sprinkling baptism is right there's nobody in the Bible ever sprinkled no such a thing in the scripture neither was there ever anybody baptized in the name of father son holy ghost in the Bible is everyone baptized in the name of Jesus Christ so there's not one not even one Speck of history for if anybody can show anywhere anywhere in the history where any person was ever baptized in the Bible are 300 years after the death of the last disciple until the Catholic Church if anybody can show anywhere that anybody was ever sprinkled or baptized in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost until the Catholic Church you're so Duty bound to come tell me it's not there but what do we do we've been through the church agents to see where they had to do that so you see God wants somebody that will obey him if it's not in the scriptures then it's not a man it's a man-made Doctrine and not a Bible Doctrine see so regardless of what the church is how wrong you've been what difference does that make it's how right you can be now God's Grace has showed it to you then walking God's grace remember Moses also that great leader God should have killed him when he went down there to glorify himself but Smite in that rock and said you see what I can do in other words you rebels must we fetch your water from this rock and he smoted it and the waters didn't come he smoted it again what did he do he testified of the weakness of the of Christ because Christ was that rock That's The Headstone instead of smiting it or speaking to it it was smitten once remember God told Moses over in Exodus go out and I'll Stand before before you up on the Rock and smite The Rock and he smoked the Rock and brought forth Waters God said the next time go speak to the Rock and he'll bring forth his Waters but Moses want to show he had a little authority a little power so he said I'll bring you water out of this Rock God should have killed him far God should have separated him now he broke God's law right there because he spoke of the weakness of Christ he has to be smitten the second time Christ is only smitten once now we speak to the Rock and it brings forth its water but what was it let's look at the old man he's 120 someone said to me not long ago said God is an unjust God said because he let Moses down that told them Hebrews for 40 years and that Wilderness out there he let him down and then would he let him go to Promised Land all nonsense no he didn't let Moses down he went to the promised land about 700 years later he was saw up on top of Mount Transfiguration as loud as he ever was standing talking to Jesus before he went to Calvary him and Elijah standing together talking to Moses Elijah appeared to Jesus Peter James and John on Mount Transfiguration he was not dead he was alive God didn't let him down he was in Palestine now look before he died he climbed up Mount Neo that morning when he knew he was going you done stripped Aaron put his clothes up another took his own Rob put up Joshua commanded him to stay with them precepts and when he climbed up to the top of Mount Neo went through the valley in the plains knowing he's going up there the die and climbed up on Mount nebor and up to pisga while he was standing up there God said look over in the land I want you to see it Moses you could have went over there but you know what you did down there at the rock that day you glorified yourself I think that's why it's going to be a great trouble with a lot of us people today go down there at the Rock and you glorify yourself but no when he got ready to die there stood The Rock Amen he must just stepped over on the Rock there at pisan and God buried him but he must have rose again somewhere because he was alive he's the type of Christ there he was then on Mount Transfiguration hundreds of years later over in Palestine see the grace of God provided the Rock Amen oh my when I think of Abraham of all the mistakes that he made and Moses and his mistakes but when Abraham's commentary was written when the Divine commentary was written when Paul wrote Abraham's commentary he never mention one thing about Abraham's unbelief no no there wasn't even accounted to him he said Abraham standard not the promise of God through unbelief but with strong giving praise to God Amen my humble prayer is before for the grace of God that you're this morning I hope mine wrote like that that he won't see my mistakes that when my commentary is written in my obituary that it won't be read out I made mistakes and done wrong but it'll only see the things that I tried to do for him may they just be coming what does that he'll take the grace of God that I believe in and that's where I'm solely trusting for my own marriage I can no more go in and unrest but upon the grace of God I'm depending yes it's Grace Hallelujah that I'm depending on there was a rock there when Moses got ready to die what could we say of David the grace of God that great warrior to whom God himself he said he's a man at of my own heart that great warrior David how could he do such a thing he he done to take Ura he Soldier when he had a handful of Gentiles out there as soldiers listen close to this little story just for a moment when they had the soldiers out there and Ur was one who stood by David Ura was a proelite he was a hatip a proelite to the Jewish religion and that man loved David so much they seen the anointing was up on him although he was a he was a fugitive he was Ed out from his own country had to live with the fisting Saul was hunting but yet those men they saw the anointing upon they know what he's coming into Power amen glory to God I'm so glad to be a fugitive today because I see that Christ is coming in to be king you're going to El all the kennedies and whatever more you want to but Christ will be king the dawning is upon Him upon his message of his coming amen and he'll be king what did he do one day he would stand up there thirsty for a drink of water from the gate out there Bethlehem where he used to go her the sheep and you know what two of those men took a swords and cut two 15 miles of human flesh to get him a bucket of water Hallelujah because why his least desire was a commandment to them think of that and they cut through those men always in the top of that mountain to where they said he was standing he'd be about 15 miles they went through there and every man raised up they du with him till they killed him went on through and took his bucket and got a bucket of water right through the enemy's line two men to get their King their brother a drink of water when he had water up there drink but he wanted that water oh God let me take the sword of the word and come through every organization the bring the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ in the power of the resurrection and the Holy Ghost back to the people regardless Hallelujah he's coming into Power Hallelujah he's coming into Power you'll stand alone but cut through every organization cut through every Theory every man-made Creed until you bring the Savior back a sheep that's gone astray somebody bring back the Bible doctrines again of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the grace of God look at David how could he done one jumped into a pit and killed a line how could David take your eyes wife the beautiful basba when he had 500 of his own but senior taking a bath and there's the negligence uh she just forgot to pull the shades down when she's taking her know that King made a trip there by there every day down over that wall that's what's m I don't think women today so neglected are so well they just simply go out naked that's all in the streets little old clothes on it's a disgrace amen then wonder why a man blow and whistle why they do that to make him whistle and car on they know that they got sense enough to know that they do it just because they want to it's in their heart you tell them they're immoral they might dispute that but they might not being moral they might be as pure as the Lily when it comes sexually but remember there's a spirit on them that lining of the devil sending some man's Soul To Hell remember the Bible said whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her and his heart already remember Sister you'll answer for committing adultery though you never done it actually in all your life of that sinner that looked at you the way you dressed be guilty of adultery you'll answer the day of judgment for committing adultery when he has to say he say he wrote on his book committing adultery with who Miss John Doe now miss John do what about that I swear I you know my record I never live with another man but my own husband but you dress yourself you caus this man to commit adultery you're guilty of adultery with him that's who he done it you are to blame you was the one who presented yourself B Shea done wrong just like Eve done wrong but Adam was included in it I think we're always hard about women too you sons of God man I know you're the stronger Bunch that's right the stronger say you're over the women that's true so act like it don't overpower and try to take some little girl and ruin her life but be a Son of God tell her she's in the wrong and stand like a Son of God she's your sister yes sir what we try to do what so-called sons of God today belong to churches take every little girl out they can remember because it there's an imal a woman May because some married man ruined her too so pot can't call K black so just remember it's sin that does it all we're all subject to death and should die for it when David did that evil thing his own judgment should have killed him when that Prophet came up there he thought it was hid when not Prophet come up there and stood before me and said David is everything going right so everything's fine David in his high robes in his big crown and he had joab out there a great gentle and all the fighting going on he's keeping all the enemies off the Border Lines and things everything is going right he had a baby with this basba and had poor little Ur go out there and had joab to stand by his side until he withdrew from him and and and the boy died when the sun went down with a battled knife in his hand blood on his shield for he stood for Israel yet a proelite he was to the religion then when joab come back and told him that that David had di that U had died David thought everything's all right now I've got his wife and everything will be all right got a baby but the baby tuck sick the baby started dying and he did everything he could to save the baby's life perhaps ever doctor come no good finally the baby died they was afraid to tell uh David that the baby is dead and he died then he thought her everything was heed so he comforted BBA he'd already taken her for his wife after all those other wives this old Prophet old baldheaded fell stomped in Old Nathan out of the Wilderness sat down and said David how's everything going said fine fine oh prophet of God live forever hallelujah oh he was just he thought everything is fine he thought he could hide it but you can't hide from God he knows what you're thinking right now he knows your thoughts for he's God that Holy Spirit that's in the building this morning knows your thoughts who you are where you come from what you've done for Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen God had revealed it to that prophet he said David there was a rich man lived on this side of the road he had a whole lot of sheep oh he's very rich man lived on this side of the road was poor he had one lamb he treated like a daughter he fed it out of the same spoon he eat with he slept with the lamb everything is just he's just like a daughter to him and one day a visitor came so instead of the rich man taking one of his own sheep and and making a feast for the visor well instead of that he went over took the poor man's lamb and by force took the lamb and slated it and made a feast now that was David's passions he had 500 wives but when he's seen 's wife instead of taking one of these 500 wives to appease or satisfy his passion you might talk this other man's wife then kill her you or I when she become a mother David didn't know what he was doing while David is ready to pronounce judgment that that's the way we are we can always judge the other fell but when it comes to us oh that's different David said the man will pay with his ey that old Prophet them eyes SAR down he said David surely you'll not die what's Grace to go to work right quick the spirit struck the prophet save David's life Grace Hallelujah surely you'll not die but the sword will not leave your house till let thoroughly purged your heart for you are that rich man yes oh it was different then wasn't what saved David when his own judgment said the man will die he'll pay to the uttermost and he'll pay for it with his life and the prophet said surely Grace you'll not die you'll not die David Grace has saved you it was Grace to David that saved him oh my it had been for Grace where would we all be is that right certainly solent Grace Grace is from a solvent one solvent Grace from a solvent one solvent what can it do Sovereign can do whatever it wants to am listen to this now Sovereign Grace can only be given by one that's Sovereign and God is Sovereign so he can give Sovereign Grace therefore being Sovereign Grace don't have to ask anybody amen amen don't has to it does what it wants to is that wonderful it don't has to ask can I do this

another back to blood tears Agony Grace took a hold and said today shalt thou be with me in Paradise Oh Glory Grace did that how could that Thief help himself no more than Adam could help himself no more than Eve could help herself no more than you could help yourself no more than I can help myself Hallelujah no more we can jerk our up the mil white way with her bootstraps we couldn't do it but the grace of God can do something about it amen and it does it amen the grace of God the sovereignty of the grace of God come to that dying Thief today shalt thou be with me and Paradise oh think of it that's wonderful think of it love and grace is sisters twin sisters you can't have Grace without having and love they're twin sisters they're exactly right before you can have Grace you have to have love before you can actually show somebody a favor you love them right or wrong you have to love them anyhow or you can't see so love and grace is the same thing they're just twin sisters that's all love and grace they walk work we can't see one without the other God so loved the world gave His only begotten son he shed his grace brought our hearts to the Holy Ghost see there's just nothing you can do without working one with the other Grace Grace of God is what saves us now we find out the grace there like that dying thet no wonder it's inspired poets when they seen him one poet said

it is Grace a grace of God the grace of God is brought forth a Shad God brought Grace into our lives by his love for us here's something else Grace Can't Do Grace cannot be bought Grace cannot be sold

church that's all you won't be saved Grace has to save hallelujah hallelujah our talents does not rest and our talents cannot be our our our talents that we have we cannot earn uh Grace by Talent if God made me a preacher that I don't sh his grace has been with me no no it's his grace alone that saved me not because I preach the gospel I'm saved not because you speak with tongues you're saved oh no not because you because you preach you're not even saved it's because you preach you're you're not saved because you speak with tongues you're not saved because you do any of these things 1 Corinthians 13 proves so though I speak with tongue of man and Angels do I understand all the mysteries of God a preacher do I do all this and have faith to move mountains I am nothing until charity comes in which is love love is Grace the grace of God that does all some people have talents like some of these rock and roll kings that just makes me sick at my I don't know my spiritual gastronomics I'll tell you when I hear these Rock and rolls stand up on Saturday night and sing a rock and roll and dance all night then the next morning come to the face uh the audience and things like that with a try to put on a long sanctimonious face and stand up there before the people and sing some hymn and think they going to go to heaven I could call many names that I don't have to the tape's going everywhere but you all know a boy you're not long ago in Hollywood wouldn't kiss a girl because it was against his religion against his religion and make rock and roll pictures and things is disgracefully and things things like that do you think that you can take your 30 pieces of silver and Merit something in God's grace Judas won't buy nothing but a place in Hell For You God's grace cannot be bargained for neither be can be taled into it s Grace nothing in my arms I bring simply through thy cross I naked wounded I just come as I am just as I Am Without One Plea but that thy blood was shed for me and that thou bids be come to thee Oh Lamb of God I come that's all just Grace brought me hallelujah hallelujah Grace didn't Grace is like another thing that I'd like to say sometimes Grace is these big churches they think that you go down there they think well we built the biggest church in the city we've got a lady's Aid Society here that makes poor clothes for the poor and sends them overseas we feed the poor we do all this Paul said I can do the same thing and nothing they said well we we're an old organization we've been here for 2,000 years we are 500 years old John Wesley Alexander camel these great Founders back there they founded our church Hallelujah well Jesus Christ founded this church the baptism of the Holy Ghost and told them to go up to Pentecost and wait till they receive the power from on high Hallelujah and still you can belong to the Pentecostal church should be lost Pentecostal church is no more than any other Church right the thing of it is there's only one church that's the church that you're born into by the baptism of the Holy Spirit but for one Spirit we're all baptized into one body 1 Corinthians 12:13 that's right first 1 Corinthians 12 now we are baptized into that church but people think that they can Merit it well we I I went to school and I learned to do this and I went to seminaries and I done that don't mean one thing you can't buy God's grace God's grace is like this let me tell you a story in ending God's grace is like this this one time there was a mighty king and this mighty king had a son and it was his only son and one day a murder killed that boy and through that Kingdom went the delegates hunting for that murder they finally found that murder when they found him they brought him back and imprisoned him and when they did a trial was set and a sentence was made oh it was a terrible thing he had murdered the King's son and he knew what was coming to him they put him into the inner cells they locked the doors they put pads on it so no one the guards around it CU we know what kind of a horrible punishment this boy was going to receive because he killed the King's son the Royal King's son guards is placed all around the doors he put an inner cell stripping nothing but a loin cloth on there he was set there in that condition and starv and wouldn't give him nothing to eat and sitting in that condition then they brought him out to a trial he was found guilty and proven guilty a sentence is made that he is to be executed under horrible capital punishment he is to be killed by inches until his mortal life is gone sentenced by the judge he is to die and he begged and he cried and he said though I am guilty though I am guilty I'm sorry that I did that I wish I had never done it I'm sorry that I did in a moment of a rage of temper I did it I didn't mean to do it that way one day the king went down to the place to visit the boy to tell him talk to him and tell him about killing his own son the only son he had he'd kill that boy he said I'm going down to talk to him and when he went down there he looked back in that cage like a caged in animal he saw it little skinny body laying back in the corner crying his face all sunk in Jaws sank back his eyes way back matter was all in his eyes his mouth was all whed over no water thirsting laying back there on his face crying the king said stand up he come up to him he looked at him he said why did you kill my son what did my son do to you what did he do to marry such a death as you killed him stabbing him to death with a spear he said nothing my heart not one thing just my own impotence just my own ways I killed him because I was jealous of him and I got a temper fit and I kill him so I'm to die under your Justice sir I realize that and I deserve to do it only thing I'm crying for and I'm just sorry that I kill that Royal man like that without a cause the king turned on his heels and walked out went out to the desk and said destroy all the records you know put them in the sea of forgetfulness Hallelujah destroy all the records wash him up clean him up I send on a robe for him Hallelujah after a while a great big limousine drove up to the door when it did a carpet was spread out to the prison cell the king stood the end of the limine and said come my son and ride home with me to the Palace put the king's robe around his shoulder he said from henceforth you are my son because he had pity that's Grace that was me Hallelujah that was you we killed the Son of God with our sins we were alien dirty filthy laying in the cells of the world God washed Us by the blood of his own son and cleansed us put on the road of the Holy Spirit and now the great charot of God will back up to the door someday and we'll go home to live with him all records are destroyed we can't be judged no more burn them up he put them in the sea of forgiveness rememb about more Hallelujah no wonder we can sing Amazing Grace how sweet

others you may see this one finished you may see this one can't make it and this one God doesn't want you to see that way you have to still look now for others Through The Eyes Of God to see that his grace could reach to the lowest to the deepest to the viest to the Whatever It Is God grace could still reach and bring them out that's why we say don't write off anybody don't cut off anybody God God

time where would I be where would I [Music] be God Only Knows glad you see true Eyes Of Love Eyes Of Love Oh uness empty space empty space [Music] not Thomson God bless you Saints well we at that Junction again where we making physical preparations for convention coming but I want to put that in the context of uh a general awareness of what it takes to keep us going this is from a financial perspective and um over the last I would say even couple years a lot of our offerings and I want to at this Junction thank people who have extended themselves but I thought I would provide a little more background so that people in making decisions to Avail yourself your resources in whatever kind Financial or otherwise that you would make a more informed decision with regard to what we're doing and what we trying to achieve um many of you would have seen coming in this morning that we have begun the con some construction at the back this is for additional toilets for sisters um this has been on our heart to do for several years the pandemic kind of inter interrupted the program somewhat um because there's a greater need we have more sisters Among Us and there's a greater need need especially at convention time this is heightened where it's a strain on the current set of toilets that we have we've tried to rent in the last few years but that is always proving kind of a shaky we thought we would put something that is uh more permanent in place something that is more accommodating to the sisters our deserving sisters um our offerings and stuff generally speaking going over the last couple years have not always met recurring expenditure and um this is something that always proves a challenge I know that sometimes people come lights are on a air condition is going stuff is happening and we think that um okay you know I'm okay I don't need to do anything more but I'm seeing that it has not met our recurring expenditure and we want people in terms of when you're thinking of any sacrifice that you're making or further sacrifice that it is against the backdrop of listen more needs to be done and then the question comes on on a personal level what can I do more can I make myself more available to assist I'm a trades person I'm a this I'm a that I'm a that can I make financial resources available and um it always comes down to some form of sacrif sacrifice you know the the giving of ease I in in Reading when Solomon was constructing the temple they reached a point where they have to tell Believers listen don't don't bring anything more we we we have enough we are not from there we are not there we are far from that and um my sharing this with you this morning is to encourage people to make a more informed decision inquire about we've put out notices about um the pledges for convention and we we are not in the habit of making um taking up five offerings and saying well this one is for the toilet this one is so that we we we are not about that as you would know here you see that the focus is on the word but in order for the word to be received by those that we have coming into the Tabernacle there has to an environment that's created and it from a trusty perspective this is very physical it's dollars and cents it's it costs so we want people to think along a certain line more needs to be done and the next question is can I do more so I'm just giving a a overview this morning we were supposed to have done this a while back but I'm thinking that we at the junction where we we need to say it and reinforce it and hope that this would result in some positive response from all present you can share this with those who are not here today and um I want to say that want to thank all the people who have been extending themselves all the people who have come forward and volunteered to do things and given of their substance we want to thank you but we want to be able to State also that listen we need more more needs to be done and we want to thank you in advance for your positive response thank you very much God bless you that same song where would I be has been dismissed at this point in time [Music] well so we dismiss ushers mothers
