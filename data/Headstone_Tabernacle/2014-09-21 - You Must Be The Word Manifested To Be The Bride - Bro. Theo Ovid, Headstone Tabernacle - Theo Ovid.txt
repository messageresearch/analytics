land and we are not going to stumble into that another Ephesians yes we're going to be guided by the spirit of Truth amen into it because Jesus promised to release the spirit of truth that going to lead us and guide us in all truth amen now uh Sunday last I said something that Moses was bringing dust say the Lord to the people Dusty the Lord dust say Lord Dusty Lord and afterward it was Dusty at Moses and God didn't like that and on Thursday I found where the Prophet said that uh Moses failed before because he glorified himself that's right so men could fail men could fall men could fail man is not infallible God is he say I am God and beside me there is none else when God look to his left look to his right there is none else because he's God and God Alone Hallelujah he doesn't need the help for man to make him God he is God and God Alone he purpose and Define what he purpose and release his purpose and that comes to pass and if he purpose that you'll be delivered this morning nothing going to stop that not even what happened last night what even happened last week last year last 20 years that does not stop or anal the purpose of God oh praise the name of the Lord I don't care if the doctors give up on you that does not anal the purpose of God I don't care if you don't feel you're going to get well that does not anal the purpose of God because he said my word shall not return unto me void Nothing Stops the purpose and the defined will of God it will stand kingdoms rise kingdom fall but God word will stand he said he raised up pharaoh to bring him down because God will withstand oh you may be seated praise God Hallelujah why you think faar was the mightiest land the mightiest country the most industrial most advanced God wanted to challenge the most advanced country in the land so God make sure he raise up Egypt big and powerful everybody is afraid of Egypt every country fears the pharaoh of Egypt who is like the evening and The Morning Star who is like unto Pharaoh but Loose the mud God the god of them Mudders loose the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob loose that God he's not a man that that he can lie oh I love him this morning Hallelujah he's about to perform signs he's about to perform wonders he's about to perform Miracles that you have not yet seen so you better start to get excited about what he's about to do whether you're ready or not he's going to do it because the mouth of the Lord has spoken it and once you speak it it must come to [Applause] pass Oh Glory to God you may be seated you understand what about to take place we about to defy sickness defy kingdoms defy man's word defy the history of your past all of that is about to be defied just as the Hebrew boys defi the Lions to defy the fiery furnace to defy the king's commandment to defy whatever man have to offer we represent not ourselves we represent another kingdom Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah what you may be seated one thing I like with the Ten Commandments is that the king's people were bringing in the stuff and so on to pharaoh and resting it down I'm from this King I'm from Greece I'm from this and what not and here come and they ask him what kingdom do you represent he said the kingdom of the most high [Applause] God and instead of bringing pearls or cloth or whatever it is Moses said I bring the word I come with the word Pharaoh let my people go give the Lord a shout people glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated now those were just a few words let my people go just for words people say that's words man what you have a sck a stick what you have long beard what you have I have Aon as a prophet in me and that is what you come with yes now phoh what do you have I have thousands and thousands of horses I have thousand thousand and thousands of soldiers I have thousands and thousands of men I have thousands and thousands of of palaces and people and everything else and I have the slaves in my hand what do you have again Moses I have the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob come again I have the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob no I didn't hear you I didn't hear you I didn't hear you where are your people that's why I come to tell you I come for them I come to let them go what do you have again a word just let my people go Hallelujah we going to start the battle tomorrow get the Lord some Praises people oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah church God is about to do things that going to blow people mind out this is the battle that God was waiting for Oh Glory to God Battle of angels have become the Battle of men we taken the war to the devil we taken to the war wherever we're going to take the war do you know that Joel prophesy a mighty Army do you know there's a mighty Army to rise up that will rise up in God's name in God's power with God's presence he said my people shall never be ashamed some of you are ashamed to testify some of you are ashamed to live for him some of you say asham of this and ashame but he said my people when I'm finished with them when I pour out my spirit it shall come to pass I'll pour out my spirit and my people Oh Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory hall hallelujah hallelujah you struggle you may be you struggle to live you struggle to pay the bills you struggle with life you struggle with different issues within your own life mind battles your struggle you have to struggle that's why he put us on the earth and if you understand that that's why I told you be comfortable with being uncomfortable you have to struggle you have to feel uncomfortable you have to feel like you don't belong when God called Abraham out he called him out among the people that he did not know you call him to a country you have never been he said come on come on come on Keep On Walking Keep On Walking you're meeting new people a new way of behavior a new way of life a new way of worship a new kind of aggression a new determination a new sense of purpose oh Hallelujah your life shook from being comfortable where you are because God loves to do that take you out of your comfort zone make it stressful make it tough make it pressing make it frustrating to see who is who because that's the only [Applause] way that's why that's why teachers give tests that's why school give exams to filter who is who who playing the fool who skying who playing games and song then the test come everybody got nervous they have to get the pens ready it's ATT tension isn't that right it's within one hour have a time period for the test is that forever ever ever No have a time period so what you're going through have a time period don't let the devil tell you up like if you condemned to be how you are because you always what don't let the devil tie you up there's a time for everything a time to born a time to die time to shout a time to break out a time to go free a time to be loose from your infirmities a time for you to be healed a time for you to be sealed Give the Lord some Praises there a time under heaven for everything under the sun a time for your husband to be delivered a time for your wife to be delivered a time a time for your children to be delivered they are going to be delivered how long the devil going to hold [Applause] them oh Hallelujah time Hallelujah time oh glory to God hallelujah so this promised land is to live in the land of the Holy Spirit and this Promised Land is What is the promisees the Holy Spirit I'll P my spirit up that's the promise isn't that right and then Joshua told them uh clean up your lives don't come to your wives sanctify yourself every one of you let no man come at his wife or within 3 days you will see the glory of God it's a process of getting ready a lot of people you see it's a process God God Moses presumed because his mother told him stuff that he was a special child that he was deliverer intellectually he knew that but he didn't have the empowerment to do that and you have to be empowered to fulfill God's purpose that's why it's called virtue power for service not your service God's service power to be in service for the Lord that's when God put you in his service that's when he sign you up and he rank you and he put the little tag on you I don't know what that put the tag on you and so on that you have ranked now cuz you're now empowered then you could stop power to stop the demons that get out so so take left take left go right you this one go right you take left that's power that's what what Jesus had is isn't that right power to cast out Devils is that power to prophesy power to overcome power to pray some of you can't pray and you can't pray and you can't pray you can talk long on the cell phone but you can't pray and you can't pray and you can't pray and can't pray can't talk to God but when power come you have power to pray you have the power power to forgive and here there big one there's a big one coming now power to say I'm sorry there a big one there a big one lots of people don't like that [Applause] lot of people don't like to say the sorry because sorry means like you're wrong and you don't want to be wrong you want to be right so sorry means that you're little less down or you're lower down or you make a mistake make it out you don't want to say sorry but sorry means you're little it's small if you want to how powerful are take a bucket of water and take your big fist and punch in that bucket of water and see the whole you remain when you pull it out if you have a hole when you punch that bucket of water and come out you're really powerful yeah you didn't get that one take a bucket of water in it and take your fist and punch a ho and just see if you see a hole there if a hole is there you are really powerful if the hole is not there you have to come and rethink the kind of power that you have so you have to be conscious of your littleness conscious how small we are conscious of the grace of God conscious if wasn't for the grace of God we couldn't be here this morning conscious of the blood of Jesus that amen died to redeem us and to reconcile us back to God because because we lost the connection and and God restore back the wireless connection and you do have no room in charges to pay amen When you pray it's all Wireless you don't you don't have any connection to plugin and so on you don't have to pay for the connection you just you just call on Jesus and the antenna is active hallelujah it's not shut down because when Adam fell he sent angels to guard the tree but now he sent angels to try to drive you back to the tree so God line his Wireless line is always alive and active nothing is that brick in the channel is when you ready to call he's ready to answer glor that's why you had to be ready to pray Hallelujah and while while you're waiting for the door to open you could still praise him in the corridor come on now give the Lord some Praises even if the door is not open yet and you're in the corridor waiting to enter in and the door is not open yet let him hear you let him hear your worship let him hear your Thanksgiving let's all stand and give God Praises this morning Hall Glory GL list sing I love him I love him because he first loved me as we approach the word this morning I love him you must love him love the Lord not just come to church but love him he's a person he loves you this morning love him everybody I love [Music] him because he [Music] hallelujah thank you Lord thank you [Music] Lord on cence Street amen could you turn your Bibles with me to St John chap 1 and St John chapter 14 two portion of scriptures this morning St John 1 we want to read from 29-33 and St John 14 12- 21 the next day John see Jes see Jesus come unto him and said Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world this is he of whom I said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me and I knew him not but that he should be made manifest to Israel therefore am I come baptizing with water and John bear record saying I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it Abode upon him and I knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom Thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost and reading in John 14 reading from verse 12 verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if he shall ask anything in my name I will do it if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he shall give you another another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but he know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world see me no more but ye shall see me but because I live he shall live also at that day he shall know that I am in my father ye in me and I in you he that ha my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him I will manifest myself to him let's pray father we thank you for your holy word and Lord we are right under a promise of another comforter even the spirit of Truth they were already comforted by Christ among them the Living Word but he promised another comforter which was the spirit to be indwelling in them oh God release that comforter here this morning and fill every Hungry Heart in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen you may be seated oh blessed be the name of the Lord thank you Lord oh blessed be the name of the lord it's so good to have a praise in your heart you always have something to thank God and I think I saw noticed somebody said um once you're above ground you have you have something to praise God you're above the ground you're alive you still have health and strength you're above ground you have something to praise God about amen so this morning I have a title you must be the word manifested to be the bride amen that's my title this morning you must be the word manifested to be the bride and have an inspiration until you are convinced you cannot be concerned until you are convinced you cannot be concerned now praise God so God will never be able watch we will never be able to have a church until God gets a foundation to lay on he will never build his church and a bunch of nonsense he has to come on his word or he won't won't come at all amen isn't that right I'm only building the all is close at hand when you're going to see something happen when something is going to take place and all this background here has only been laying a foundation for a short quick message that will shake the whole nation so for God to build for God to add for God to work there have to be a foundation for him to work with isn't that right and if God is to work with you there has to be a place prepared and that's why John the Baptist was sent he was sent to prepare a place for messiah so God always have preparation made he doesn't just come he come on what has been prepared isn't that right amen now in St John 663 it says it's the spirit that Quicken it the flesh propit at nothing the words that I speak they are spirit and they are life amen Jesus is saying words are also spirit amen words are also life amen it's not just words amen now watch 1 John 56 says this is he that came by water and blood even Jesus Christ not by water only but by water and blood it is the spirit that bear witness because the spirit is truth amen not information Spirit is truth amen that's why in court you said speak the whole truth nothing but the truth and and so help me God and so on because it have whole truth and you could speak something that goes beyond what is true things that you want to color it and flavor it with so they ask you to speak the whole truth and not take back the truth isn't that right so when Jesus say I am the way and the truth he's not just talking from a letter standpoint he's talking about the spirit itself so it's not just words it's Spirit life makes it truth and Jesus said You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free now a lot of people know the words a lot of people know what is right and what is wrong but they're not empowered to live what is right so when he say you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free he's not talking about something intellectual he's not talking about some understanding he's talking about that Spirit to come inside of you to release you from your past to release you from your sin to release you from your guilt and set you free and who the son of man set free is free indeed [Applause] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so truth come to release you isn't that rightall now Luke 8:4 and when much people were gathered together they would come to him out of every city he spake a parable a saw went out to se he swed some fell by the wayside it was strutting down fowls of the air devoured it some fell upon a rock soon as it was sprung up it withered away because it lacked moisture some fell among Thorns The Thorn sprang up and choked it others fell on good ground sprang up bear fruit 100 fold when he had said these things he cried he had an air to hear Let Him hear and the disciples asked him saying what might this Parable be amen and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God but unto others in Parables that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand so a parable is really Hidden Mysteries that's right veiled as stories but in them have Hidden Truths to be revealed to who is elected which is the children of the Kingdom isn't that right so then Jesus begin to interpret that he said unto you is given to know the Mysteries he said now the parable is this the seed is the word of God that's right amen now watch he said my words are Spirit my words are life but now he said my word is a seed amen so God takes Spirit Make It Word take word make it seed yes amen and that seed is what comes into you that's right could we give the Lord a praise than those by the wayside that adhere then come at the Devil take it out the word out of their hearts least they should believe and be saved the under the rock a day when they hear receive the word with joy but they have no root which for a while believe in time of Temptation fall away and that which fell among tor a day which when they heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to Perfection but that on good ground are they which here we go which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience fruit with patience oh Hallelujah the husband man waited for the rain waited with patience for the fruit of the earth to come forth oh Hallelujah this is not instan thing because character is not a gift character is a victory and character means that you went through something so God is interested in you going through something and not asking him to take you out of something but asking you to help you give the grace to go through the stuff that you need to go through in order to have character because character is not a blessing from the Lord character is a victory oh could I hear some Praises in the [Applause] house so God's son this un spoke Original Seed was his example seed and that's why when we want to look at the template we look to Jesus when we look to see how God handled his sons and treat his sons we look to Jesus because he was the example seed son and when Jesus received the spirit we know when Jesus went Jesus didn't went and put the advertisement on papers and said here am I I am the Messiah Jesus was led by the spirit Into the Wilderness for his place of trying to be tested by the word dry word and Jesus overcame by it is written not I'm feeling this he had no feeling to feel it was dry it was Desert all he had was Rock word it is written it is written it is written you feel something I have no feeling in this it is written it is written it is written and when the devil start to quote he said it is also written glory to God are you with me now so this was the example seed son behavior and operation so watch what is life was when the spirit poured upon him after his baptism and the Holy Ghost came upon him the very life that he produced that same here we go that same watering Spirit of the Holy Ghost will bring forth the same kind of life doing the same thing that he did so now we find out the spirit is also watering spirit so the Holy Ghost is the watering spirit and if you have the watering spirit that Spirit coming for seed right that mean not God just sending water to water no you have to have seed for that watering Spirit to come upon and if that water in Spirit come upon that seed something has to take place because water and Seed does connect a certain way something has happened when water strike seed oh give the Lord some Praises people so you have a seed it's dry it looks like it's dead it has no power in it it looks like it's just a seed laying there that could be a oak tree that could be a coconut tree whatever it is it's looking dry you could walk past it you could store it in the cupboard you could St there for years but if you only let water touch it if you only let water come on it if you only let that water in spirit strike that seed something going to happen because Jesus said my ways are Spirit oh and they life is the spirit that Quicken it oh so you have to sit here and get in the spirit when you understand that nothing going to stop you from worshiping when you understand that nothing going to stop you from praising your God because it's the spirit that quickened the flesh profited [Applause] nothing hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah do you understand so there's a bit of teaching this morning the word is a seed amen Jesus now watch watch so watch the same watering Spirit of the Holy Ghost will bring forth the same kind of life doing the same thing that he did if it is if it's the same seed son of God's seed will bring forth a son of God's seed in other words every seed after its kind according to Genesis 1:11 Hallelujah so son of God's seed will produce son of God's seed isn't that right now Jesus already prophesied and we read it in John 14:12 the same works I do I'm not hearing you shall you do also so what is Jesus saying the same seed that I have going to be inside of you and a watering Spirit going to come upon you and the same life that I have going to be living in you and the same works that I did you going to do [Applause] too oh could we thank the Lord for that could we praise God for that do you understand all the same Works he did you going to do it's not you trying something it's not you experimenting with something it's another comforter oh Hallelujah that going to abide with you forever okay now watch see what it is that why I believe the word is a seed and if the rain falls upon the seed it will bring forth after its kind Hallelujah the holy spirit will water and bring forth that seed it's the water to the seed and if the seed has been planted and the water falls on you oh Hallelujah it know was the spirit going to fall on planted W the spirit not falling on this Bible this Bible have to get in you come on now come on now come on now so God have to wrap the Bible up in a Capstone revelation [Applause] you will be seated there are only three Bibles the Zodiac the pyramid and this Bible that's right well this physical Bible is that Bible so when this Bible become that Bible and that Bible comes inside of you then that becomes the full seed inside of you then the s t Revelation is the Capstone revelation of the entire Bible and it must so Jesus Christ any Revelation that doesn't reveal Jesus Christ is the wrong Revelation Oh Glory to God this is Jesus Christ that's the life that Jesus had oh worship him this morning give the Lord some Praises this morning that's the life that Jesus had hallelujah hallelujah that's that's the Thunder oh that's the Thunder that going to shake the devil that that that's a live voice that going to come alive a living faith a living virtue a living knowledge a living Temperance a living patience that's the voice that going to come alive that's the voice of God that's what Pharaoh heard let my people go it was Mor than words it was the voice of God oh hallelujah hallelujah once more the world will hear direct from God what will it be it will be the voice of God in the last days and the spirit and the prophet and the bride will say the same thing and the spirit and the prophet and the bride will say the same thing there shall be a final voice to the final age seven thundering voices seven Living Voices oh seven voices to shake the devil's King you may be seated God devil saw in the beginning Hallelujah that's what Genesis is the beginning in the beginning devil slipped down to

look at you say oh I go if God if God was thinking like us and he look he like go like look look what he tell Moses he said Moses how long are you going to stand them people no it's God people Moses bring them and the people carrying on go tell mes Moses he kill them and raise up a whole new punch greater than them then Moses had a bargain with God he said but God if you kill them as one man man all the nations will say that you bring them out but you couldn't bring them in that's why you kill them how we could look God pardon them read the Bible Moses was bargaining with God on behalf of the people God said okay I'll forgive them because of your word but as I live they shall not see that land do you understand God is real do you understand we are not talking about a pope we not talking about a bishop we are not talking about the Evangelist we are not talking about a pastor we talking about God [Applause] himself it's amazing how this omnipotent all powerful God subject himself to his own laws it's amazing that he doesn't break the laws that are set in motion Hallelujah he has to come by the word he have to lose a prophecy a virgin shall conceive for he himself to come by prophecy Hallelujah even Jesus had was to go into David's prophecy and the David said I shall not suffer my holy on in corruption and Jesus had to connect with that prophecy to say destroy this body in three days I'll raise it up Jesus connect with David in order to say a testimony of where he is at that's how interconnected the word is this word is God every page is God God is the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the word is a seed and the prophet bring the word to get that word inside of [Applause] you he sent his word and heal them power of the world sir some people have a discernment of it some people recognizes it and they could respond to it like that Centurion came up to Jesus and he said master I have a servant he is sick I'm not worthy for you to come under my roof now there a big shot you're talking about Ian not worthy man had the best porch in the country you know I mean everything looking nice but he is saying you see he's belittling himself he's getting the right Viewpoint you see when you recognize how small you are and this get this big shot spirit and this arrogant attitude and this proud and you you and like like God owe you something and and and no no you have to get out of that atmosphere Al together and get a humble heart get honest heart get a simple Heart Lord you see because see the guide have to come to lead you and if you can't take instructions by the word now when the guide come and say I'm taking you up the up the den is Lions there you say Lions where I'm going back there see so when you see you come to this place place where you could be led by the tutor led by the guide and he says there's Lions up there they say Lord as long as my hands is yours I have no problem with the Lions just keep on leading see you want to take instructions if the pastor give you instructions that the pastor that's not the guide that's the pastor and you don't want to listen follow through and Obey I mean when the guy come you will say no you see what I'm saying now you got to be able to obey in the little things isn't that right isn't that right read the Bible somebody ask brother a question how can I get deeper in the love of God he said read the Bible and pray every day read your Bible and pray read the word and it's very simple you say put a thing on your ears no read the Bible and pray that is all get a prayerful Spirit commit your life into the Lord you start the day right you put God in front and you're looking to trust him yeah you're looking to trust him and and he becomes your trust and you recognize afterwards you start to let see God active in your operation active in your life you see when God is out is you running your show you on your own you going here you're doing this and you're doing that and it's you and you and all about you but when but when you surrender and this is what God wants then you begin to see God you have a miserable class you could pray God cool L children down so you're a teacher and you don't say well you know God have nothing to do with you teaching no God in the teaching too because you have an opportunity to put seed in those children that will set them in the right part of life so all of that is that you're concerned sometime they come from stressful families stressful home nobody care for them nobody love them and the day somebody take time off to show some love and some care and concern you're surprised to know at that response and that's the whole thing some people come and they beat the people up beat the people in church up because that's the easy thing to do everybody know they're born in sship iniquity they have issues in their own life the pastor come on big sck and put licks you know put licks and everybody say yes yes yes yes and especially those who can't control theel they like people to control them they people like that that is why dictators are necessary in some cases not me I know not applying for that post I have no desire to be there that's why have dictators because people don't want internal self- discipline so they need a strong man and when the strong man come the strong man say left turn they say yes sir right turn yes sir and they feel in obedience to the strong man but God like to say will thou be made whole Peter love as thou me oh you know I love you feed my Lambs feed my love is D me P how they get a little pressure CU Jesus PES them on you really love me and that kind of pushing pushing pushing Lord know his all things you mean give my break out of that now pressing some Nubs are disturbing me and I don't want to be disturbing in my spirit like that but Jesus was pushing an emphasis to show him he has to go deeper than where he's at come on now come on now come on now and and and and as we go forward you have to go deeper than where you're at and that's why I had to challenge you this morning oh Hallelujah Oh Glory my my my okay let's go now watch so the watch okay let me go further now the AR Noah AR was made of go go for wood and him wood it's Hollow everything is taken out of it but anybody seeing the material that Noah used were they going to laugh at him because that material was going to take in water and sink now God is not a fool God is the fun of wisdom so God let Noah take a soft wood that is very absorbent because God is bringing a further Revelation to pitch it on the inside and outside because God want the pitch to soak in to make the bo waterproof sealed from sinking you understand what I'm saying so god holds the revelation of what's looking porous in your life because because he want you absorbent to the [Music] spirit so making sure there are some holes around you I'm not hearing I'm not [Applause] he that's why when you're strong you get God trouble prise God so God have to mash you up and let you fall let it break up a little bit oh God that's what you want to hear oh God it wasn't it wasn't saying that all the time you was only going in the power of yourself but when God break you oh God help me you say yes you're now getting in tune you're now getting in the condition so when people are broken I am broken don't think God crying because they broke me know God said they now getting ready they now getting ready you weeping you crying you're broken God say you're now getting in shape because I can't work with that stubborn attitude you have I can't work with that self will that you have I can't work with the what you're pushing and pedaling no no no when you get broken and God have to break people's Spirit am you know God s up Jero Hallelujah they have the walls they feel insecure like when you have your walls you feel very secure they to run Chariot race on the wall of Jericho that houses shops in the walls of Jericho nobody challenging Jericho Jericho on their own when you see the walls alone you just walk just pass Jericho hey we're not fighting there you know what God did God let reputation go ahead of them fellas so they only hear and Report oh God you hear what happen they take out the king of eye they take out this King that King that King people ins J shaking you know all them walls you have they shaking you know because these man moving Fearless they know God is with them when when they start to know God is with you that that is that is different not not the court with you you know not the books with you you know not you have tapes you know I'm not talking about that I'm talking about this living God when is start to hear what the children of Israel doing to this King and that King and this nation and that nation and the Conquering sickness and the Conquering diseases and the Conquering and the blind seeing and the deaf hearing and the dumb speaking when know the god of Israel do [Applause] live Jero Jericho only holding up because of the walls so Joshua says lose spice inside of to see what's going on inside of there Joshua lose to men inside of there to go and spy out the land you see before you take the land you have to spy it out you can't go blind go going you get busted you get conquered you can't just go in the land like that there's an approach to take what you have to take come on now help me preach somebody come on now come on now you're not just going to take it you want to know the key Hallelujah you want to know how to take it you want to know battle [Applause] strategy God is a strategist Hallelujah hallu go Str one time one time he want to take a city you know what he did he let the fellas run in front some and them come back out and when they come back out the city they do like they running away and that time Israel have men on the the other side like that there and when they City come out they see fire burning God is a strategist he tell them how to take it how to possess it so before you take Jericho God to soften them up by testimonies by hearing what God is doing that's what this message they need some testimonies not paper testimonies you know real ones real healings real deliverances real baptisms real Miracles real signs real wonders real Pillar of Fire coming down real Angels standing on the platform real discernment real calling out sin real calling out spirits real setting the captive free real breaking the BS of wickedness how many wants [Applause] that if you are not convinced of this you wouldn't be concerned about it that why Jesus say If any man want it come unto me and drink Jesus didn't say that he If any man thirst that's different wanting to drink and thirsty is different when you real thirsty you drink from the drain before you're so desperate when you're thirsty you are desperate you have water for a long time you say I need a drink I've got to have it that's when you're tting how many thirsting and Jesus said oh I love that Jesus said Jesus said blessed the day that hunger Hunger and thirst after righteousness they shall be faithed come on now give the Lord some praise His people in other words if you are thirsting for righteousness you are blessed Shout for being blessed this morning if you are hungering for God you are already blessed shout oh for the thir in your soul God going to fill you yes go going to seal you God going to fill you Hallelujah I didn't make the promise I'm not saying that that but it said that Jesus said that he said I'm going to give you another comforter another scripture he said if I don't go to comfortable that come I've got to go for the comforter to come you have to got to cross over Jordan you got to cross on the word into the spirit we need people that are convinced of these promises convinced that God going to keep his word sir convinced what what will make a old man like Abraham testify he going to have a son and you know his wife is as Bur as bar could be what he was convinced it was PE to him it was a revelation to him even his wife laugh Hallelujah but God didn't talk to his wife God talk to him so because his wife was laughing he had to have faith for himself and her also if he not allow her to throw his Fe off then all fall down if if Abraham was an emotional man and a man p a like a fleshly kind of man when your wife say boy you know you believe that you see how old I am you will get to in that but but the thing about it is that Sarah end up tying up Abraham to go with hagga because he he leave that the interpretation had to come that way but God says true Sarah thy wife it have no other interpretation than that that is how I saying it and saying No Other Woman it's true Sarah that is my mind concerning this issue and if God say to you come on now come on [Applause] [Music] now that clap sounds so halfhearted and weak you laughing just like Sarah don't let 10 spy tie you up you know 10 spy bring report you know 5 sens to the Flesh and five sens to the spirit see taste smell touch feel imagination conscious imag you listen to them spies then SP will tell you you can't make it you see what happened last night you get V with your wife this happened you quarrel your Force you complain all that is part of the SP technique all we talking about outside spies we talking about the inside spies things that talk into your mind telling you you're not going to make it you struggle here struggle here not going to work out and you start to believe those things are not going to work out I'm just bringing a type but when you shake them senses off imagination you have nothing to do with this conscience don't even raise his head memory don't even bring back anything at the past and feelings you better take a seat this morning because I believe the word so you put all them senses in their [Applause] place and tell imagination don't even think about it I am not imagining nothing about it God said so I'm going to be F I'm going to be sealed glory to God let them let us take the heads off those dogs [Applause] off Hallelujah then you are free you're not move you're not motivated by your feelings and your emotions and your conscience and your memory and your affection and your reasoning You're motivated by the promise of God because John was so convinced of the expectation and fulfillment of the promise John said there was one standing among you I don't know who he is but he going to baptize you with [Applause] fire what what what would mck John say that he was convinced he was so convinced that he begin to speak at present tense he said I don't know him but the one who told me to baptize with water told me the one that you see the spirit coming on and remaining on him that is the one that going to baptize with the Holy Ghost John see John living by faith preaching my faith he don't know if Jesus is tall dark fair skin fat thin he don't know what Jesus look like he don't know what the promise look like all he know the one who told him to be baptized told him that the one you see the spirit so John only looking for Spirit he is baptizing but looking for Spirit he is hearing word or looking for Spirit he is baptizing and preaching but he looking for the spirit you looking for somebody that the spirit will coming upon you looking for some son that God could said I am pleased some man somewhere some son somewhere somebody on the earth God going to be pleased with to send on that dve but ask we God going to do it God promise it somebody somewhere on the earth God have to come down Hallelujah and said this is my [Applause] son if you're not convinced you just come to church if you're not convinced they go home and you just act the same way but when you're convinced you make preparation come on come on now you you you have some family overseas and they haven't been in Trin for a long time and they call you a three 4 days and said I'm coming on Wednesday I'm coming to visit you and and you say you sure you say you're playing games I'm not sure you're going to come say yeah I'm coming and because they coming you start to make preparation because they coming my God you start to clean the place start to prepare the place you said check out where you're going to take them where you're going to carry them because they coming to have a time and you are going to be there oh you're going to be welcome they going to be your [Applause] guests look Hallelujah you might be seated John was so disconnected to the numbers of people coming to get baptized that would have impressed a human Spirit human Spirit Pastor the among the people land to get baptized oh what a bless there plenty likes but there plenty votes there plenty people there plenty membership and so on John said you better be for fruit fruit meet to repentance the ACT is Lay to every tree yes John only rough it up somebody said John cool it now you see who coming out thaty Pharisees daughter you know Hallelujah you can't preach so this morning you know you know who that man come and get baptized he's the right Reverend something neighbor uncle whatever it is and this one is a high one that one a listen the Pharisees saw John's Behavior they knew something was a mess so they say they say they say they say I I who are you Hallelujah are you the Messiah or or should we look for another John said no I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare you the way of the Lord go read your Bible I'm Isaiah 43 Hallelujah so John was putting himself in the scriptures just if you read that that me that's right could you could you read a book and say that that's you come on now come on [Applause] now that is place in Christ John could say go and read about me in Isaiah 40 well I want you to find where you are written come on now brother you should be screaming on that one after a while you going to find where you are written because you are the words of the book come on now I'm in the word this morning Oh Glory God you kind so when John took the book you were the words in the book and his words is spirit and life isn't that right so you are just bypass your theophany come down on the earth to be tested and tempted but now s John 14:20 at that day you're going to know I'm in the father you in me and I in you you're going to get a revelation of who you are where you come from where you going amen amen and you will know as you are known oh my God bless you so real seed of God is absorbent to the spirit isn't that right when God here we go and his word becomes one amen that is when God's spirit Waters the seed of God it produces God it's not the individual it is God you are dead Hallelujah you are not yourself no more you reckon Yourself Dead hollowed out waiting for sejm then what is it it isn't you no more it isn't the man it's God in the man it's the SE germ like the beginning spoken word god spoken word made manifest in the man then it isn't the man it's the man that died oh Hallelujah and then Christ come alive Christ means the anointed one a man that was anointed oh Hallelujah and God dwelling in him what was it the germ with the flesh the anointed one the flesh being Anointed with the spirit of God produced the word of God made manifest the flesh so Jesus was the Flesh of God the word he was the word but he needed the spirit to come upon him to make it manifest so the fullness of the Spirit came down upon that son you are not going to get the fullness you are going to get your measure oh give the Lord some Praises people Hallelujah Jesus receiv received the fullness but you receive the measure just like the ocean that's right just like the water and the ocean you take a little spoonful of water and you have all the ocean there the contents of it if you take chemicals of the ocean water you have in a spoon the same content of that spoon of water is what is in the ocean you are not the ocean the what the content is what you have so when you have a little bit of God in you all that was in God all the content of God all the mechanics and the chemicals of God is inside of you a little of God is God he you hear what I'm saying you have the chemistry of God inside of you a little on of God is God inside of you Hallelujah you you have the fullness but you have a measure a measure of power a me measure of overcoming a measure of witness Hallelujah a measure of strength oh Glory Hallelujah so listen to this so watch so then watch Christ mean right the anointed one flesh be with the spirit of God produce the word of God he here we go he was God's word made manifest and now he died here we go in order to pay the debt of your high breeding that you could die to yourself until you are no more yourself but be filled with his word believing his word then the holy spirit that was in him comes down to water that word to make it grow Hallelujah so you see all this money gospel all this blessing gospel it can't work because all the blessing doesn't give character it has to come to a place that's why I get it I'll just say it the Dynamics have to drive the people to Calvary people need to die who do you hear saying I hate myself but all these selfie cameras now taking a picture of themselves they love themselves and then technology come to make could even help theel some more don't they have selfies people love themselves but job say I hate myself I Repent in dust and Ashes it's a stripping of self that man must come to which is the cross because only there you really meet Jesus it's only there you get the Breakthrough into the Holy Ghost you are restored to Eden by The Altar and through the [Applause] altar so watch that he might reconcile us back to the Sons and Daughters of God that through the church through the church might flow the same life by the word continuing listen the word made being manifested as it was in Christ Christ was God's word made manifest say that after me Christ Christ was God's word God's word made manifest man say it again Christ Christ was God's word word made manifest so therefore the bride going to be the word made manifest because she is part of Christ not just the [Applause] word not just the word so this this is to shake the babies off their Pampers and make them TR away the pacifiers am that you can't just sit here believe in the word the word have to become manifested in your life could we give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah you must be convinced of that that you want your wife to see it amen the word hanging out to you a she must jump and say wo that that that that that's not you I marri you long enough I know your behavior I know your walk I know you talk so you see what I see in there I go in and pray that is the effect of that that that is the effect when when the husband start to get in the groove of the word wife she have to pray because she start to see God then she start to see God oozing out and you don't want to cross that you know I mean you you want to walk right what about wife now husband offbeat and she's had to manifest Christ it's time for he to pray because he know he can't cross that that's God you see we had to see that s we will see Jesus so we will see Jesus we want we see Jesus we see man long enough 40 years we see the parade of the beef I call it the parade of Flesh and Blood there's no need for beef parade there's no there's no need for flesh parade we need to see Jesus and to see Jesus somebody have to die somebody have to die anytime you see Christ somebody die Christ not a favor Christ is not a flavor and somebody paint something on your have a button christu the button we talk no button Christ we're not talking about no testimony Christ postbook no we're talking about a life that begins to flow virtue begins to flow a power begins to flow as about to pray for the sick of power comes there when you come into a sick room as you walk in the devils in that sick room of sickness the devil's know time to leave just get ready get get ready we we have to go now other Devils talking to other Devils saying let's go let's go they are coming they are coming they are coming we feel them coming nearer because virtue is emanating all around you virtue power as you walk into the hospital room as you walk into the sick room a power is going inside of there with you and them Devils know to eject exit take the leave and they leave before you even get there and by the time you get there it's time to pronounce the blessings of God don't you want to see that I want to see that don't you want to see that that's what God promised a perfect Church walking in order oh Hallelujah okay let's continue here now now watch watch and he died he gave his life that he might send the spirit take his body up and send the spirit back to water pay the redeeming Price He that believeth in me then he comes the Holy Spirit to water the same word now watch the word itself was lost Through the Ages so when the spirit come the spirit couldn't come to water the word because the word itself was lost so God have us to come to gather up the scattered word and tie up the Loose Ends to restore the seed of God back again so all that Luther left off CU Luther believe he was justified but he was still drinking beer and smoking they wasn't Sanctified they were saved because the word for that time was justification then Wesley come and said you can't just be saved and smoking and drinking clean up get Sanctified and Wesley brought the sanctification message and they went on further isn't that right so in every age had loose end had things that was not clean and clear after they were Sanctified like a wash glass here come to Pentecostals God poured the spirit and then they feel they speak in tongues and so on that's as far as they go set of baby stuff and they play with gifts and so on and here comes a prophet to bring the word now because the word comes to Prophet the word don't come to a pope the word doesn't come to a church the word doesn't come to denomination the word of the Lord came unto Noah the word of the Lord came unto Moses the word of the Lord came unto Isaiah right the word of the Lord came unto William Mar and Bram a 20th century Prophet according to Malachi 4 behold I send you Elijah the prophet isn't that right so the word came to a prophet to the prophet brought the word the full word hallelujah so that word could become a seed again so the first part of our ministry was T BL right are you with me the first part of his ministry was tying up six seals of loose ends just going back and dealing with Genesis serp and seed and all different stuff he had to clean that up and then he had a message for the bride which are seven tenders that will gather the bride would show the bride how to Bear would give the bride Faith would UT to the bride would give the be bride Revival in other words he had a special message for the bride amen not not wasn't his message because the Lord himself is send with a shout so the Lord himself which was the husband the revealed word came for his wife God has sent somebody he sent Malachi for to call out a bride but he descended with the message himself do do you Recon when they get a when they get a wedding invitation is a message Hallelujah is a is a piece of cardboard or or paper or whatever inviting inviting you to a wedding it's written well that's what brother was he came as a messenger to bring the invitation to the wedding supper of the Lamb Hallelujah for the bride to get a call to respond isn't that right so the seven Thunder is an invitation of life for your life to be changed God is not forcing anything about on you you could stay a church member if you want you could stay ordinary if you want or you could be like Samson when the spirit Came Upon him you hear what I said you could stay ordinary or you could be like Samson Samson was not ordinary he had Seven Locks he had seven tunders he had seven virtues he had seven Mysteries he had seven [Applause] voices you see those seven lucks was the key to his power and strength that was sealed as a mystery to Samson alone amen Samson alone held the secret that's right of the power that he had now Samson wasn't a big small muscular man like what you see on paper big HK HK muscles that will be dishonorable to God come like the man strong that why he moving this and moving this Sams was an ordinary guy but when the spirit come upon him hallu he did some extraordinary things one time they caught Samson inside and they closed the gate you know how the gates are those times big Gates Samson take off the gate with the post and carry it on a hill Samson didn't even B to even check to see the days how heavy the gate is he just take the gate out with the post and continue walking and take the gate and they can't lock Samson in Samson beating lion Samson thousand men getting beat down with Samson was just different why the spirit Came Upon him Hallelujah and activated the power inside of him Spirit he was a channel to which God could flow through when God sees Samson God said there is my spirit flowing freely or I could use him Hallelujah I could work him the devil sat down in his boardroom and said this cannot continue we can't allow this man to embarrass us Jesus get a plan amen call his agent get his spies interview the Lila in the spirit Realm and and decid to set a Honey Trap they call it for Samson Honey Trap did I looking good walking good talking good and Samson get activated with liking Thea that was the beginning of his fall but God had another plan besides the devil have a plan God was planning on top of his plan because God had a plan to put Samson in the right position to get more results that he could ever get before so while the devil is working God say moving so I will move so let's move let the battle [Applause] roll you may be se he Thea say Samson where's your secret Sam to play games with Thea if youe a cord I lose my strength tie the cord he break it he laughing it's a joke for him because even though he lying the power still they with him because God is say if you lie there'll be no power God said don't cut the hael and the power will be with you don't break the secret keep it silent don't let the devil know nothing about itall Samson had to do other little games and so on you know and Thea wear him down and that devil does you know we you down until Samson decided to give away the secret he break that seal of Silence over his life of the secret of his power give it to theila and theila now fully anointed get the man to cut off his locks and Samson wake up as if he going to wake up with power and only recognize the power was not there amen he was ordinary and I hope you understand this you Christians sitting here without God's grace and presence and power you are ordinary amen so really come with a grateful heart have a graceful Heart A Grateful heart a thankful heart you may not be where you want to be now but be grateful don't act arrogant and rude as if God owe you [Music] something so know the story the bind Samson dig out his eyes s is not blind and God watching Samson has some years to go through his stuff Samson is grinding but God have a plan that's right and afterwards they want entertainment and said Bing on Samson my you see where you are doesn't mean where you going to be that that way devil don't understand and you have to understand your present condition doesn't mean that next 2 years or next 6 months you will be still be in that condition so even though Samson was bong let's say for 5 years blind weak that time the secret Delux going back I will restore say the lord the devil could cut some but not all he can't go down in The Roots because the roots Gone Too Deep Hallelujah you see the devil only came in the beginning but you were before the beginning the devil could only stop when he digging he going dig up to in the beginning but once he reached in the beginning he can't go beyond that but but we could go before there was a beginning we before the foundation of the world we could we have all Roots got deeper than in the beginning so the devil can only cut off up there in the beginning but Samson had deeper Roots than that so those roots brought back the heal it brought back the strength it brought back the word it brought back the seed but there was no visible evidence of power they thought was the same weak man that he was 5 years ago they thought he was the same weak man that he was 7 8 10 years ago but this time what was restored the word was restored he was waiting for the watering Spirit of the Holy Ghost but more than that he was waiting to be positionally placed placed in Christ Hallelujah you may be seated so here come Samson the entertaining people they call him to entertain the crowd 3,000 plus people and stuff isn't that right and then they said bring him Hallelujah used to be servant of God used to kill lion used to be feared bring on onetime former Champion for God ex Holy Ghost Man X powerful man xman on fire xman pressing and saying amen bring him out dry as a biscuit dead as a d look at him let's have a good laugh little did dece through his suckless eyes the tears they didn't see the tears Samson wasn't weeping for himself he was convinced the word was restored he was convinced of God's power he was convinced God is his father and he was concerned that he could bring back glory to God once more once more once more he had failed but he wanted to bring Glory back to God he fell but he wanted to bring Glory back to God it wasn't about Samson it was about God it wasn't about Samson it was about God's power God's presence called omnipotent you may be [Applause] seated stripped Hallelujah powerful man amen led by a little boy he's blind God tell little boy lead me to the pillars that holding up the building lead me there positionally Place me there hallu I'm I'm going to pray in a while I'm going to pray in a while it's something when a son who have blood over him there's something when a son who feel the access right to God when you loging you can't be denied when you put your name you can't be denied when you put your name to log in God's program and to go L into God's website he can't tell you try a next name no no no no no would not be denied and Samson asked the little boy to put him positionally between the post and you could see Samson and they laughing and while they laughing s is crying he's not weeping for himself he is saying Lord remember me they had no right to take out my eyes avenge me once more show your power show your glory Samson was waiting for the water in spirit Samson was waiting for Dynamics and his mechanics Samson was waiting for his word to become spirit and when the fire fell Samson throw down the whole thing give the Lord a shout of [Applause] Praise oh give the Lord some worship Give the Lord some Glory oh hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah glory to God glory to God glory to God glory to God glory to [Applause] God you might be seated hey huj hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you must be convinced that this is the word of God this is the spirit speaking to you amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah ordinary men you may be seated doing extraordinary things Ordinary People it wasn't people because they have a degree it wasn't because they have an engineering degree or some lawyer degree or doctor degree ordinary men that God pick up and use look at David ordinary guy seen about the sheep and God because of Saul who was anointed to be king and because Saul out of the spirit despising the will of God out of tune with the program of God God tells Samuel I have an anointed one of the son of Jesse to be king over Israel nobody could stop that nobody could change that when God speaks it got to materialize Oh Glory to God sit down a minute please listen here it is a king in power a king on his throne a king in his Palace a king that God allowed to be there and the same God that put that King there say I have find a better man God does raise up Kings and God does pull on Kings God does raise up people and God has shift people the angel of God is on the Earth fixing things around moving things around for the kingdom of God for the coming of the [Applause] Lord friends you may be seated you can't serve God from a historical perspective you can't say you were blessed 5 years ago and you are forever blessed because God blessed you 5 years ago you got to serve God daily you got to serve him still you can't go back because when the same people that God brought out God killed because of their unbelief Samuel was told to go and anoint one of the son of Jesse Hallelujah Samuel is trembling he said if sa hear that soul will kill me them days you talk against the king they will kill you you don't don't cross those guys they will kill you amen yes that's right they playing games in those days God told Samuel just have a feast invite Jess and his sons tell them you come to sacrifice come to worship God give him a cover to use in order to bring the sons there God knew David was going to be there he knows all things here come Jesse Samuel with the Horn of oil and he saw the first son come by eliab by name I believe it was and Samuel says surely this is he and God whisper in his ears God don't see the way man says man see the suit man see the tie man see how long men preaching man see so much reputation and the view of others but God sees the heart Hallelujah Samuel have the Horn of oil to anoint one of the son of Jesse to be king right because in those days you have to be anointed to be King you can't take a crown and put on your head and say I am King that is dictatorship that when you take Crown in God's program you have to be anointed to be king Hallelujah you can't just say I am the leader says who you appoint yourself leader we go ahead feel free God have to anoint to be king So Samuel is there waiting what he waiting for Spirit witness the spirit is what Witnesses the spirit not the is the spirit so you can't look at height you can't look at teachings and preachings and gift and talent he's looking for heart so this man passed that man passed all of them pass Samuel say but I ain't get no witness do you have any more Sons because God can't lie if God tell me come and anoint one of the sons of Jesse they have to be one of the sons they say we had one more David he out there with the Sheep he says send for David I'm not going to sit down until David come now you know those days is not right day to have sheep y wait you got to wait until Hallelujah until David come so Samuel say know him sitting down so Sam tension right now when David coming this is he hall now watch what Samuel did he poured the hor oil in the presence of David's Breen I mean the whole Hall everybody seeing David when God want to do it for [Applause] you God don't have to ask permission from anybody how to bless you when to bless you hallelujah hallelujah I feel somebody going to get blessed this morning the I feel somebody going to be blessed this morning oh receive it receive your oil listen David is now now anointed king but could he rule no like a character right too young he ready for no Throne he's anointed if David run say let's say David run to sa say Saul God ano me King now lose his head that's right that's right that would be a dead King David David can't run up and say you speak in tongues and said I am now King so he open a king service his church name Kingdom King King David King David assembly and he preaching that Saul sent his men everybody in assembly get clean out you don't do that so David just went and see about his sheep until the time you see you see God to work this thing out because when David get anointed an evil spirit come up on Saul and Saul said to be here so badly that they say you know what you need some music it don't not iPod or iPhone here yet it don't have them MP3 yet but David has play real good send for David so David God had David gifted with music gifted to play so they send for David and David going in his Palace not yet but it's his Palace David playing is his throne his a wrong Soul so don't even know his replacement has come I'm

Saul feel ued so Saul want David to come more and God want David to come more because God want David walk in the palace God want David see the throne God want David see the steps see where he have to be operating from God want David to see where his kingdom going to be established from what a mighty God we serve God will take it from the back and God will bring you to the front God will take it
