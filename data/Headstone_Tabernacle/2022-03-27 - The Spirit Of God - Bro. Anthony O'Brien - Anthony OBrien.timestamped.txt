[42:29] just a couple of us is here to hone in
[42:31] on our text this morning say in john 3
[42:34] we'll read from verse 6
[42:37] and it says that which is born of the
[42:38] flesh is flesh
[42:40] and that which is born of the spirit is
[42:42] spirit
[42:44] marvel not that i said unto thee he must
[42:47] be born again
[42:49] the wind bleweth where it listeth
[42:51] and thou hearst the sound thereof
[42:54] but can't not tell whence it cometh
[42:57] and wither it goeth

[45:30] of god amen glory to god
[45:32] so we encourage our hearts this morning
[45:35] amen and comfort ourselves with these
[45:37] things amen so i have a title this
[45:39] morning
[45:41] uh
[45:42] and my title is the spirit of god
[45:44] amen and amen the spirit of god and i
[45:48] have a subject born of the spirit
[45:50] led by the spirit
[45:52] amen and amen now saint john 3 8 here we
[45:54] read
[45:55] talking about the wind blew it where it
[45:57] listeth i'll read it again just for
[45:59] context because i wanted to kind of
[46:01] i wanted to kind of walk around the text
[46:03] this morning
[46:05] and bring some things out here
[46:06] concerning it
[46:08] and i just felt like it would be a help
[46:09] to us today
[46:11] the wind blew with where it listeth
[46:14] and thou here is the sound thereof
[46:16] but can't not tell
[46:18] whence it cometh
[46:20] and whether it goeth
[46:22] so is everyone
[46:24] that is born of the spirit and this to
[46:27] me was a very fascinating passage of
[46:30] text
[46:31] because here is where jesus is speaking
[46:33] to nicodemus concerning the spirit of
[46:35] god as we know
[46:37] and this comes jesus after jesus
[46:39] testifies to nicodemus
[46:41] that he must truly be born again
[46:45] amen and amen nicodemus
[46:47] with a natural understanding now he's
[46:50] trying to catch
[46:52] what jesus means
[46:53] or what he is saying by being born again
[46:57] and jesus replied saying that which is
[47:00] born of the flesh is flesh
[47:02] and that which is born of the spirit is
[47:04] spirit in other words i'm not talking
[47:07] about a flesh thing i'm talking about a
[47:10] spirit thing a spiritual transformation
[47:14] flesh is flesh
[47:16] amen that is what the world is of the
[47:18] world you have your money and you have
[47:19] your car and you have your house but i'm
[47:21] not talking about that i'm talking about
[47:24] a change
[47:25] amen last week we heard about changing
[47:28] amen isn't that right but isaac's
[47:30] message man how many appreciate that a
[47:32] changing world a change in people
[47:35] amen so this morning i want to kind of
[47:37] uh come behind there and talk about this
[47:39] change
[47:40] praise god just change from who you are
[47:42] to who god wants you to be
[47:44] amen god didn't come for you to just
[47:47] occupy a church pew pray and to stay as
[47:49] you are no no no no you can't come in
[47:52] the presence of god and stay exactly as
[47:54] you are
[47:56] something has to happen
[47:57] because it's god we're talking about
[48:00] when his presence dropped oh something
[48:02] have to happen
[48:04] something have to take place you cannot
[48:06] leave as you are hallelujah some change
[48:10] has got to take place and i pray this
[48:13] morning a change takes place inside of
[48:16] you this morning oh
[48:19] hallelujah
[48:20] and i'm confident that god can perform
[48:23] this change
[48:24] inside of you this morning oh
[48:27] hallelujah hallelujah i know he can do
[48:30] it
[48:30] i know he will do it oh hallelujah
[48:34] hallelujah isn't that right oh glory
[48:37] amen amen one time they came to jesus
[48:40] and they said jesus if you were wait
[48:42] what else here my brother would not have
[48:44] time isn't that right if you would have
[48:46] been here my brother would not have died
[48:50] that is a powerful saying because that
[48:52] means they understand that if jesus is
[48:55] here the dead cannot stay dead if jesus
[48:59] is here then the sick cannot stay sick
[49:01] if jesus is here then the blind cannot
[49:04] stay blind but he stayed away
[49:07] for about four days hallelujah
[49:10] hallelujah because he wanted oh he
[49:12] wanted to do the will of god and god
[49:15] wanted to prove that the dead cannot
[49:17] stay dead oh hallelujah no no no no no
[49:22] no oh hallelujah but i am the
[49:24] resurrection i am the life and when he
[49:27] said lazarus come forth the voice of god
[49:31] snatched lazarus
[49:32] soul from wherever it was and brought it
[49:36] back to the body oh
[49:38] hallelujah hallelujah and i don't care
[49:41] how you feel this morning i don't care
[49:43] how down you feel i don't care how low
[49:45] you feel the voice of god can reach down
[49:49] to the lowest valley
[49:51] oh
[49:52] he reaches
[49:53] to the highest mountain
[49:56] and he reaches
[49:57] to the lowest valley oh the blood
[50:01] that gives me strength
[50:03] from day
[50:05] to day
[50:07] it will never
[50:08] it will never
[50:10] somebody say never
[50:12] somebody say never
[50:14] never lose its power
[50:16] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[50:19] hallelujah hallelujah
[50:22] oh we're getting a lot of praise
[50:27] whoa
[50:28] amen hallelujah
[50:31] oh my
[50:33] so the wind bloweth word listen
[50:36] that means to say
[50:38] that you could if you interpret it back
[50:40] he's saying the spirit which is a win
[50:42] goes wherever it chooses to go
[50:45] amen listeth it means wherever he choose
[50:48] wherever he desire wherever you put it
[50:50] in and you can't you can't hold it back
[50:52] you can you can't control it
[50:54] you might in other words you can't put
[50:55] god in a box
[50:57] and say stay here
[50:58] you can't push god in some church and
[51:00] say stay here because no church could
[51:02] hold the holy ghost they could hold the
[51:04] honey but you can't hold the holy ghost
[51:07] the holy ghost is moving brother you got
[51:09] to move with the cloud if the holy ghost
[51:11] decides to move this morning pack up
[51:14] your tent

[52:17] is not something that can be controlled
[52:20] that's why i love this verse
[52:22] here of scripture brother brings it out
[52:24] so many times
[52:26] you see
[52:27] because people feel like they could lock
[52:28] down god
[52:29] kind of control god
[52:31] and tell god pour out
[52:33] between 11 05 and 11 10.
[52:36] then after 11 10 we have kicks and
[52:38] drinks downstairs
[52:40] so time is when we stop no no
[52:44] that's not how it works amen amen praise
[52:46] god the spirit of god moves

[52:50] you've got to ride the anointing
[52:52] praise god you got to ride it praise god
[52:53] hallelujah amen it comes from god right
[52:57] it didn't come from man
[52:59] so you can't tell the wind where to blow
[53:02] amen you could strike a match and get
[53:04] fire praise god you could pour water in
[53:06] a bottle praise god but you can't tell
[53:08] you win where to blow up to no science
[53:10] haven't figured out how to make the wind
[53:12] blow
[53:13] it just blows
[53:15] it blows where it wants to and that's
[53:17] how the spirit of god is
[53:19] it does what it wants to it moves where
[53:21] it wants to the rain falls on the just
[53:25] and the unjust you can't stop that
[53:27] that's just the grace of god but that's
[53:30] just his spirit that's just his
[53:32] anointing
[53:33] hallelujah
[53:34] [Applause]
[53:36] manifest in itself
[53:38] in whatever way it chooses to
[53:40] amen
[53:41] revelations in 1961 prophet said here
[53:44] now watch what i'm saying now closing
[53:46] i'll have to let the rest of it go but
[53:48] closing i want to say this i've kept you
[53:49] so long okay let me skip down here said
[53:51] watch now said watch and this wiccan and
[53:53] dalton's generation he said this
[53:54] generation will receive a sign he said
[53:57] now watch how it lines with the rest of
[54:00] the bible the sign of jonah jonah was in
[54:03] the belly of the whale three days three
[54:04] nights so must the son of man be in the
[54:07] belly of the earth three days and three
[54:09] nights and what will it be
[54:11] the sign of the resurrection
[54:14] see the sign of the resurrection will be
[54:16] done in a wicked and adulterous
[54:18] generation like this one now is that
[54:20] right and it was done in the book of
[54:23] acts now here's what he says here now
[54:25] jesus raised from the dead
[54:28] come into peter
[54:30] james and john and the apostles
[54:32] and they did this book of acts
[54:35] he said it wasn't the acts of the
[54:37] apostles but it was the acts of the holy
[54:40] ghost
[54:41] working in the apostles oh
[54:45] it's not you
[54:46] but it's christ living in you
[54:49] it's not your of your works lest any man
[54:52] should boast and have no boasters in
[54:54] here this morning no flesh shall glory
[54:58] in his presence oh there's come in a
[55:00] glorious time friends when the spirit of
[55:02] the living god is gonna take over take
[55:06] over the scene
[55:07] take over the star the layla of the land
[55:10] oh
[55:11] man has had his say for years and years
[55:14] and years but we're going to switch over
[55:16] to the ministry of the spirit and it's
[55:19] going to make that word real it's going
[55:21] to make that world alive it's going to
[55:23] take control it's going to begin his
[55:26] reign
[55:27] michael will drop her and begin to
[55:29] deliver every name that is on that book
[55:32] and once your name is on that book you
[55:34] are going to be delivered there's not
[55:37] enough devils in the universe that can
[55:39] stop you from being delivered that can
[55:42] stop you for hallelujah from receiving
[55:44] your holy ghost portion from out of the
[55:47] seventh seal
[55:48] [Applause]
[55:51] hallelujah glory to god amen amen
[55:55] oh hallelujah
[55:57] hallelujah
[55:59] isn't that right
[56:01] hallelujah because before it was word
[56:03] it was spirit
[56:04] elohim spirit that dwelt alone in
[56:07] himself
[56:08] that brought alone with his thoughts
[56:10] that was there for how long i don't know
[56:12] eons and eons but it couldn't stay like
[56:15] that because in order for god to have
[56:17] fellowship with his expression he had to
[56:20] express something he had to say
[56:22] something he had to speak something oh
[56:25] hallelujah thought became a word
[56:27] hallelujah isn't that right and that
[56:29] word spoke and said let there be
[56:32] and there you come forth
[56:35] oh hallelujah
[56:37] because he thought about you
[56:39] and when he thought about you he loved
[56:41] you when he thought about you he formed
[56:43] what you would look like what you would
[56:45] talk like he was up there in his
[56:47] thoughts but when he spoke it it
[56:49] materialized and once it's spoken it
[56:53] cannot go back to being a thought
[56:54] anymore
[56:56] because it's already done spoken
[56:58] oh hallelujah what are we saying this
[57:01] morning you are going to be the express
[57:03] thoughts that elohim had in the
[57:05] beginning and those express talks was a
[57:08] royal priesthood those expressed
[57:10] thoughts with the victorious people
[57:13] praise god of people without sin are
[57:15] people around idols are people who
[57:17] worship the living god day and night
[57:20] pray without ceasing oh hallelujah are
[57:23] perfect people
[57:24] on the edge
[57:26] hallelujah
[57:28] do you believe it this morning
[57:30] not perfect in yourself
[57:32] but perfect in christ
[57:34] amen
[57:36] in christ perfection
[57:38] his work of perfection amen wonderful
[57:41] so it's not a man today prophet said
[57:44] it's the holy ghost
[57:45] working through a man or man see
[57:49] that does the work
[57:50] amen it's not the man
[57:52] the man's just a vessel
[57:55] see just something you carry it in he
[57:57] carries it but the holy ghost is the oil
[58:00] that is in that vessel
[58:02] that's what the holy ghost is and that's
[58:04] what we come for this morning pray god
[58:07] will settle for nothing less hallelujah
[58:09] than the glorious wonderful baptism of
[58:12] the holy ghost and fire in your soul oh
[58:16] that puts you anew oh hallelujah gets
[58:18] rid of the old man oh behold i make all
[58:22] things new
[58:24] praise god many many man hallelujah
[58:27] hallelujah
[58:28] hallelujah
[58:30] amen god is in control of it amen has
[58:32] nothing to do with man see man is out to
[58:35] the picture amen man can debate the word
[58:39] but he cannot debate
[58:41] the spirit of god
[58:43] he can't debate it
[58:45] one time brother brown told a man
[58:46] because you challenge
[58:48] the spirit of god you will fall at my
[58:51] feet
[58:52] praise god he wasn't challenging a man
[58:55] the man the maniac man who was standing
[58:56] there saying what he was saying was
[58:58] deceived because when he look he saw a
[59:00] man praise god what he didn't see was a
[59:02] god that was in that man hallelujah the
[59:05] spirit that was around that man he
[59:07] didn't see that oh hallelujah if he saw
[59:10] that he would talk different but he was
[59:12] deceived the spirit upon him was
[59:14] deceiving him oh hallelujah
[59:23] [Applause]
[59:28] he takes control wherever god is he
[59:30] takes control he told joshua take
[59:33] hallelujah be reverent take your shoes

[1:00:03] reverence

[1:00:08] bells ringing holy holy holy anoint

[1:06:58] okay let me move on
[1:07:00] wind blows see watch it shake the trees
[1:07:03] you can see the tree shaking
[1:07:04] i see wind blowing
[1:07:06] you know a man up up in there trying to
[1:07:08] shake
[1:07:08] the trees
[1:07:10] especially when they're all shaking at
[1:07:11] once
[1:07:12] that had to be army of men
[1:07:13] but i don't see no man in the fire that
[1:07:16] means something inside the fire
[1:07:18] here's a narrative when moses saw the
[1:07:20] flaming burning bush
[1:07:21] he said go to sea he wanted to go to sea
[1:07:23] because he no fire as burn bush but the
[1:07:26] bush is not consumed the bush is not
[1:07:28] being burned up then that means this is
[1:07:30] not a natural thing praise god what we
[1:07:33] see
[1:07:34] should put every soul into action what
[1:07:36] we see or to make a church that'll make
[1:07:40] a revival because we see in something
[1:07:43] that not natural it's not man doing this
[1:07:46] man doing that but it is called
[1:07:49] doing a work
[1:07:50] amongst the people
[1:07:52] getting you ready for a rapture
[1:07:58] [Music]
[1:08:00] it's not right okay
[1:08:02] spirit of god
[1:08:03] makes you worship
[1:08:05] see that's not the work of a man
[1:08:07] it's a work of the wind the holy spirit
[1:08:09] when you feel the spirit of god like we
[1:08:11] feel the spirit of god this morning
[1:08:14] moving upon us that's what makes you
[1:08:16] stand up on your feet that's what makes
[1:08:18] you agree with this or it's something
[1:08:19] inside your soul it's registering it's
[1:08:22] bearing witness with what you hear
[1:08:24] coming forth hallelujah because not the
[1:08:27] thought of man it's a word of god and
[1:08:30] your spirit agrees with that
[1:08:32] but more than that he wants to take out
[1:08:33] your stony heart give you a heart of
[1:08:35] flesh hallelujah i want to take out your
[1:08:38] spirit give you a new spirit
[1:08:40] and then you want to put his spirits
[1:08:43] in there
[1:08:44] that is the holy ghost that is zoe
[1:08:47] eternal life hallelujah in your body
[1:08:52] in your heart of flesh
[1:08:54] in your new heart
[1:08:56] in your new spirit
[1:08:58] in his spirit
[1:09:00] hallelujah hallelujah that only
[1:09:02] recognizes the word
[1:09:04] when it is presented his spirit
[1:09:06] praise god in you
[1:09:08] is what speaks back
[1:09:09] dawah the christ
[1:09:11] the son of the living god amen
[1:09:14] peter spoke it by revelation but he
[1:09:16] still had to go in the upper room
[1:09:18] because he had his struggles he had his
[1:09:21] challenges he cut our mind off he was
[1:09:24] hot tempered and he needed to get
[1:09:26] tempered down he needed to get his
[1:09:28] spirits oh hallelujah he denied christ
[1:09:31] hallelujah is not right he needed to get
[1:09:33] his spirit praise god in order to truly
[1:09:36] please god
[1:09:37] oh isn't that right
[1:09:39] amen
[1:09:40] that's what we're looking for this
[1:09:42] morning
[1:09:43] amen when the spirit of god begins to
[1:09:44] manifest itself in the true church of
[1:09:46] the living god that'll be the work of
[1:09:48] the holy spirit
[1:09:50] in the church
[1:09:51] amen let's move on to this verse here it
[1:09:54] says but you can't not tell from when to
[1:09:55] comment or whether it goes that's
[1:09:57] because god is mysterious
[1:10:00] amen he works in a mysterious way isn't
[1:10:02] that right ecclesiastes 11. says as don
[1:10:06] know west not what is the way of the
[1:10:08] spirit
[1:10:09] nor how the bones do grow this is
[1:10:12] ecclesiastes 11 5.
[1:10:14] i don't know it's not what does the way
[1:10:15] of the spirit or how the spirits do
[1:10:18] group how the bones do grow in the womb
[1:10:20] of her that is with child
[1:10:22] even so
[1:10:23] thou knowest not the works of god who
[1:10:27] maketh all
[1:10:28] oh hallelujah
[1:10:30] whatever he wants to do he will too
[1:10:32] brother pray he is sovereign hallelujah
[1:10:34] who told philip to go down to the
[1:10:35] ethiopian eunuch that was called god
[1:10:38] translated philip and drop him off there
[1:10:41] and say talk to that one he read any
[1:10:43] bible but he don't understand the spirit
[1:10:45] of god knows what our ethiopian unique
[1:10:46] have need of because he drawing from the
[1:10:48] word but he need a supernatural element
[1:10:51] he needs to understand what's taking
[1:10:53] place and it take the spirit to
[1:10:54] interpret so god drop off one of his
[1:10:57] emissaries named philip to go and talk
[1:11:00] to that ethiopian eunuch to give him an
[1:11:03] understanding of what he is reading and
[1:11:06] begin to connect the dots and when he
[1:11:08] connected the touch they stop off the
[1:11:10] trip they stop off the journey to make a
[1:11:13] little baptism hallelujah ceremony and
[1:11:16] philip baptizing there the utopian
[1:11:19] eunuch and he received the spirit and
[1:11:22] the bible says quickly when the work was
[1:11:24] over god translated philip and he ended
[1:11:27] up somewhere else in antioch hallelujah
[1:11:29] praise god the spirit of god is on the
[1:11:31] move oh have this one baptize this one
[1:11:34] teach this one reproof this one correct
[1:11:36] this one instruct this one it is called
[1:11:39] on the move this morning
[1:11:42] oh
[1:11:44] hallelujah
[1:11:46] prophet said we'll be worshiping the
[1:11:48] living christ
[1:11:49] him moving in and out among us
[1:11:53] oh isn't that right
[1:11:55] so that means you're going to come into
[1:11:56] such a condition
[1:11:57] where you will please the spirit of god
[1:11:59] for him to move in any time
[1:12:02] move in freely and begin to anoint and
[1:12:04] minister and move things why because
[1:12:07] you're letting yourself subject to the
[1:12:10] moving of the spirit oh hallelujah and
[1:12:13] the prophet said on god called man he
[1:12:14] said that's the kind of man we need
[1:12:16] today
[1:12:17] god trained man man who trained not in
[1:12:20] the school of theology but trained to
[1:12:23] know the spirit trained to know his
[1:12:25] presence trained to know how it works
[1:12:28] train to wait on god train to wait for
[1:12:31] god until he comes the prophet said you
[1:12:34] know what i'm waiting on
[1:12:36] i'm waiting on him i can't do it without
[1:12:39] him and he's coming for the ministry
[1:12:42] that knows how to wait on him they can't
[1:12:45] do nothing in themselves but god is
[1:12:47] going to trust himself
[1:12:49] in his commanding officers and become
[1:12:52] apostles or prophet teachers
[1:12:55] to the people
[1:12:57] oh
[1:12:58] ministering an entrance into the kingdom
[1:13:00] to you abundantly to the everlasting
[1:13:04] riches of his grace
[1:13:05] amen
[1:13:07] that's what god's doing that's what he
[1:13:09] wants to do anyway
[1:13:10] he did it once before
[1:13:12] in the apostolic age and he's gonna do
[1:13:14] it again in this omega bride in this
[1:13:17] last day amen praise god it's gonna
[1:13:19] happen
[1:13:20] because that's the kind of church jesus
[1:13:22] christ is coming for in the last days
[1:13:24] he's not coming for a dead church he's
[1:13:26] not coming for people who can't worship
[1:13:28] people who don't know how to lift their
[1:13:29] hands people don't know how to pray no
[1:13:31] no no no so you better begin to exercise
[1:13:34] yourself in the spirit this morning

[1:14:11] [Music]
[1:14:13] do you believe that
[1:14:14] all right okay so that is uh can't tell
[1:14:17] from when to come away and go and see
[1:14:18] mysterious but that's his spirit and we
[1:14:21] move with it because we trust his
[1:14:23] program we trust what he's about to do
[1:14:26] we lend ourselves fully over to the holy
[1:14:28] spirit
[1:14:29] isn't that right
[1:14:30] isn't that right and joshua joshua in
[1:14:32] the book of joshua over there
[1:14:33] represented the holy spirit isn't that
[1:14:35] right and the god told joshua this day
[1:14:37] will i magnify thy ministry and the
[1:14:40] sight of all israel
[1:14:42] do people know that as i was with moses
[1:14:45] so shall i be with you hallelujah isn't
[1:14:47] that right so that means joshua the holy
[1:14:49] spirit is gonna take you over into your
[1:14:52] promised land and divide an inheritance
[1:14:55] for you
[1:14:56] because when jesus died he left you an
[1:14:59] inheritance
[1:15:00] when he died he left you a will
[1:15:03] and testament he left something for you
[1:15:06] oh and i come this morning to find out
[1:15:08] what is my portion
[1:15:10] in his will
[1:15:12] what is my portion in his inheritance
[1:15:15] hallelujah there's a portion of the holy
[1:15:16] ghost for you
[1:15:18] there's a portion of healing for you
[1:15:20] there's a portion of deliverance for you
[1:15:22] there's a portion of restoration for you
[1:15:25] oh somebody's saying man
[1:15:28] [Applause]
[1:15:32] huh
[1:15:33] so we come to find out what is that god
[1:15:36] has for us and when we see it we could
[1:15:39] possess it
[1:15:40] because we know it's our own
[1:15:42] by revelation isn't that right
[1:15:44] so is everyone
[1:15:45] that is born of the spirit
[1:15:48] amen is not right
[1:15:50] you must be born again
[1:15:52] it's a birth from above
[1:15:55] amen amen so let's nail this down

[1:17:43] tongue takes the wafer and the priest
[1:17:45] drinks the wine and and then he becomes
[1:17:47] that but he said oh brother but on the
