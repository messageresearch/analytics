[1:20:06] amen
[1:20:11] you may be seated just for a short while
[1:20:13] greeting
[1:20:15] my
[1:20:21] so uh yeah I'd like to greet the
[1:20:23] convention in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:20:25] Christ
[1:20:26] especially brother Theo brother Isaac
[1:20:28] you know the headstone Ministry
[1:20:31] they've always been a tremendous
[1:20:32] blessing to us in South Africa and I
[1:20:34] think around the world
[1:20:35] and so it's uh it's an honor
[1:20:39] and a privilege to stand here this this
[1:20:41] morning
[1:20:42] now I think maybe I should actually tell
[1:20:44] you the story of how I ended up here
[1:20:46] this morning
[1:20:48] uh I think three or four days ago I was
[1:20:51] on the airport in Milan so it was just a
[1:20:54] layover to get to the meetings
[1:20:57] and I get a message from my dad
[1:21:00] and all it says is it says the the third
[1:21:03] service chorus leader and Minister and
[1:21:05] it says Luke Thompson
[1:21:10] no no more explanation just just that
[1:21:12] message comes
[1:21:14] and then a couple of minutes after that
[1:21:15] brother Theory the same message comes
[1:21:17] from Prada and I said to myself no ways
[1:21:21] because you know mentally you try to
[1:21:22] prepare yourself if you know you're
[1:21:24] going to speak you know this is this is
[1:21:26] out of us so it was quite a surprise
[1:21:28] but uh then I was thinking to myself you
[1:21:31] know I seem to have not had any say in
[1:21:33] this it was like
[1:21:34] I decided already
[1:21:36] so it doesn't even matter if I say
[1:21:39] listen I wasn't even consulted
[1:21:43] and then I thought okay you know what if
[1:21:45] you if you're a soldier
[1:21:49] and you get a command from a superior
[1:21:52] officer
[1:21:54] all you have to do is
[1:21:59] sir yes sir
[1:22:04] so uh I mean I'm standing here feeling
[1:22:07] that you know there's so much other
[1:22:09] minutes that I'm sure is a lot more
[1:22:11] capable
[1:22:12] but uh it's full in my lot
[1:22:16] and uh I have to
[1:22:19] obey what the superior officers said so
[1:22:23] the order came through I can't say
[1:22:24] listen no you have to send this one
[1:22:27] so Lord send me you have to pray for me
[1:22:29] you have to preach with me
[1:22:32] amen

[1:23:05] and I just want to appreciate them you

[1:23:19] been standing for years and years and
[1:23:22] years

[1:23:27] so we just want to appreciate them
[1:23:30] and uh you know and I also appreciate
[1:23:32] all the ministers that had greeted

[1:23:39] wow and brother Norris thank you for
[1:23:41] that you basically preached my old

[1:23:59] [Applause]
[1:24:01] so yeah uh
[1:24:03] that's the greetings I just also want to
[1:24:05] create again like all the local
[1:24:06] ministers as well and everyone that's
[1:24:09] online on the live stream
[1:24:11] uh I know that most is Tuning In from
[1:24:14] from back home as well so on behalf of
[1:24:16] my wife the family the Palm my pastor
[1:24:19] that's here as well we want to greet you
[1:24:21] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:24:22] let's rise to our feet through the
[1:24:24] scripture reading
[1:24:34] so I've got three portions of scripture
[1:24:38] the first one is in Saint Luke 24 from
[1:24:41] one to six
[1:24:43] and then we'll just go further down to
[1:24:46] verses 29 to 32
[1:24:48] and then x18 if you want to find that
[1:25:01] said Luke chapter 24 from verses 1 to 6
[1:25:04] reads as follows now upon the first day
[1:25:07] of the week very early in the morning
[1:25:10] they came unto the Sepulcher bringing
[1:25:13] the spices which they had prepared and
[1:25:15] certain others with them
[1:25:17] and they found the stone rolled away
[1:25:19] from the sipica and they entered in and
[1:25:22] found not the body of the Lord Jesus
[1:25:24] and it came to pass as they were much
[1:25:27] perplexed there up there about behold
[1:25:30] two men stood by them in shining
[1:25:32] garments and as they were afraid and
[1:25:35] bowed down their faces to the Earth they
[1:25:37] said unto them why seek ye the living
[1:25:40] among the Dead
[1:25:42] he is not here but he is risen remember
[1:25:46] how he speak unto you when he was yet in
[1:25:50] Galilee
[1:25:51] and then this is go to verse 24 sorry 20
[1:25:55] 29-32
[1:25:59] but they constrained him this is now the
[1:26:02] road to Emmaus
[1:26:05] abide with us for it is toward evening
[1:26:09] and the day is fast spent
[1:26:12] and he went into Terry with him and it
[1:26:14] came to pass as he sat at meat with him
[1:26:17] he took bread and blessed it and break
[1:26:20] and gave to them
[1:26:24] and the eyes were opened and they knew
[1:26:26] him and he vanished out of their sight
[1:26:29] and they said one to another did not our
[1:26:32] heart burn within us while he talked
[1:26:35] with us by the way and while he opened
[1:26:38] to us the scriptures
[1:26:40] and then the last one in Acts 1 8 just
[1:26:43] the one verse
[1:26:47] but ye shall receive power after that
[1:26:50] the Holy Ghost has come upon you and he
[1:26:53] shall be Witnesses unto me both in
[1:26:55] Jerusalem and in all Judea and in
[1:26:58] Samaria and unto the uttermost part of
[1:27:02] the earth may the Lord add a blessing to
[1:27:04] the reading of his word you may be
[1:27:05] seated amen
[1:27:17] amen
[1:27:19] so I want to just take a title
[1:27:22] the resurrected living Jesus Christ
[1:27:26] now the scriptures that were read is
[1:27:28] normally like a Easter message so I just
[1:27:30] want to uh you know forewarn you it's
[1:27:33] not an Easter message
[1:27:34] the prophet calls it he says it's an
[1:27:36] eternal spring
[1:27:39] and uh you know looking at the
[1:27:41] inspiration of the of the convention
[1:27:43] contending for the faith and I mean the
[1:27:45] again like I said the ministers that has
[1:27:48] gone before and even the ministers that
[1:27:49] had greeted
[1:27:51] how we understand that you know even the
[1:27:53] clip that brother Isaac and then put out
[1:27:55] you it's not
[1:27:56] a faith
[1:27:58] it's the faith
[1:28:01] so in other words there's one Faith one
[1:28:03] Lord one baptism and that is what we
[1:28:06] want to contend for
[1:28:07] now if the prophet had restored that
[1:28:09] faith
[1:28:11] we want to look at what that Faith was
[1:28:13] in the alpha bride
[1:28:15] to understand what it is because in
[1:28:18] containing for the faith the prophet
[1:28:19] says we we want to we want to know what
[1:28:22] it was what did the way what were they
[1:28:25] contending for
[1:28:27] and then he goes in in that message
[1:28:29] where he talks about he says you know
[1:28:31] that that when you was on Earth he was
[1:28:34] the faith he was the representation of
[1:28:35] the faith and when he was on Earth
[1:28:40] he disrupted Satan's kingdom
[1:28:44] in other words every time he would come
[1:28:46] across a funeral procession he would
[1:28:49] raise the Dead
[1:28:51] if you come across someone that is sick
[1:28:53] he would heal the sick
[1:28:55] if he comes across someone that's got
[1:28:57] blind eyes you would heal the blinded
[1:28:59] eyes
[1:29:00] that was the faith
[1:29:03] and so
[1:29:05] with his death burial in his
[1:29:06] resurrection so he dies
[1:29:09] but there was a promise of the father
[1:29:12] that was to come after
[1:29:15] and that the prophet says was also the
[1:29:17] faith now he says now now now this was
[1:29:19] when he was that one man he wreaked
[1:29:22] havoc
[1:29:24] on Satan's kingdom
[1:29:27] just in that one man
[1:29:29] he says so in other words Satan never
[1:29:31] got a chance just to be able to sit down
[1:29:33] because he had to be running up and down
[1:29:35] because God was creating havoc in his
[1:29:38] kingdom
[1:29:39] he was running a mock on humanities from
[1:29:41] the Garden of Eden
[1:29:44] and all of a sudden this man came he
[1:29:46] came into the flesh this was the word
[1:29:48] that he had become flesh he says and on
[1:29:51] the day of Pentecost the prophet puts it
[1:29:52] this way he says when three thousand
[1:29:54] Souls came to the to the Lord he didn't
[1:29:57] move one inch
[1:29:59] Satan
[1:30:01] but there was one thing that made him
[1:30:03] jump up from his seat
[1:30:05] he says that day when Peter and John
[1:30:07] came to the gate of beautiful
[1:30:09] after the day of Pentecost
[1:30:12] what was it he realized that okay now
[1:30:14] it's not just in this one man it's now
[1:30:16] in 120
[1:30:18] . so what are they going to be doing to
[1:30:20] Satan's kingdom
[1:30:23] that was the face
[1:30:25] [Applause]
[1:30:27] the prophet says he jumped up because he
[1:30:30] realized now that these this is the same
[1:30:32] thing
[1:30:33] that Jesus was doing
[1:30:35] and now they're doing the same thing Why
[1:30:38] by that same life
[1:30:40] by that same anointing
[1:30:44] and the prophet came to restore that
[1:30:48] and that's the reason why he said to us
[1:30:50] he said I'm not here to build an
[1:30:52] organization
[1:30:54] I'm not here to build a message
[1:30:55] organization he says but he sent me to
[1:30:58] build individuals
[1:31:00] to become what powerhouses
[1:31:03] and a Dwelling Place
[1:31:05] all the Spirit by his word
[1:31:09] because that's what they were
[1:31:11] they were powerhouses
[1:31:13] and the prophet says if I represent that
[1:31:16] Faith that's what I come to do
[1:31:20] so this is what he said he says also now
[1:31:22] remember that when they were walking
[1:31:24] with Christ for that three and a half
[1:31:25] years
[1:31:26] they were being the son of man seed was
[1:31:29] being planted into them
[1:31:32] so in other words at the time when the
[1:31:34] Dynamics coming to us to Quicken that
[1:31:36] seed that was in them
[1:31:39] and that's the reason why the prophet
[1:31:41] said
[1:31:43] he says I was zealous of the kind of
[1:31:45] seed that I've been planting
[1:31:47] for the body
[1:31:52] why because the real rain is going to
[1:31:55] come
[1:31:56] he says and when the real rain come it
[1:31:58] needs seed to fall on
[1:32:01] in order to do what to produce Sons and
[1:32:04] Daughters of God
[1:32:06] now in earnesty containing for the faith
[1:32:08] the prophet says a little while in the
[1:32:09] world will see me no more yet you shall
[1:32:12] see me for I personal pronoun will be
[1:32:15] with you even in you until the end of
[1:32:17] the world he says the faith that he
[1:32:19] represented he delivered to the church
[1:32:23] he says now that kind of Faith the
[1:32:26] things that Jesus did
[1:32:28] the faith that he had in God
[1:32:31] in other words he had that Faith the
[1:32:34] father that was in him he had that kind
[1:32:36] of a faith in God that was dwelling in
[1:32:39] him
[1:32:39] he says he delivered that same thing to
[1:32:42] the Saints
[1:32:43] so notice the things that I do shall you
[1:32:46] also
[1:32:47] and this is what he delivers to you
[1:32:50] so according to Luke 24 20 49 Terry and
[1:32:55] wait
[1:32:55] up at the city of Jerusalem before you
[1:32:58] go to all the world with this gospel I
[1:33:01] want to go up to the city of Jerusalem
[1:33:03] and wait there until I come
[1:33:06] that was the promise
[1:33:08] if he's the one that's going to be in
[1:33:10] you it was him that come in spirit form
[1:33:14] so go up and wait for I'm going to send
[1:33:16] that promise of the father Mama let's
[1:33:19] give the Lord and a praise
[1:33:25] [Applause]
[1:33:30] earnestly containing 53. and this is
[1:33:33] where I got the inspiration for this
[1:33:35] message he says they had a faith in a
[1:33:37] resurrected living Christ
[1:33:39] someone who had rose from the dead and
[1:33:42] was living amongst them
[1:33:45] he says just the same as he ever was
[1:33:48] even before he died
[1:33:50] so the day that he died
[1:33:52] the heavens declared it the Earth
[1:33:55] declared that he died
[1:33:58] he says but they were because they they
[1:34:00] were they were the faith that they had
[1:34:03] was in a resurrected Christ
[1:34:07] he says and that is what they were
[1:34:09] contending for he says it wasn't some
[1:34:11] historical affair
[1:34:12] but they were contending for a living
[1:34:15] Christ
[1:34:16] they were contending for a resurrected
[1:34:18] Christ
[1:34:19] because he was in the midst
[1:34:22] now he says they believed that what he
[1:34:25] was in the flesh
[1:34:27] he was also an even more in spirit
[1:34:31] my my
[1:34:33] that's that's a powerful one
[1:34:35] he says that's what they that's what
[1:34:38] they believed and that's what they
[1:34:40] practiced he says and that is what God
[1:34:43] confirmed
[1:34:44] [Music]
[1:34:46] so for you and I it's not just a
[1:34:48] ritualistic affair
[1:34:51] absolutely a real living reality of the
[1:34:55] resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:34:57] he is living amongst men
[1:35:00] [Applause]
[1:35:02] that's the phrase that I'm trying my
[1:35:04] best to contain for today this is the
[1:35:07] prophet
[1:35:08] that Jesus is the same yesterday today
[1:35:11] and forevermore
[1:35:15] now he says he done two things with his
[1:35:17] death
[1:35:18] he says the one was that he died for The
[1:35:21] Sinner
[1:35:22] so in other words he came to complete
[1:35:25] the Redemption plan the requirements for
[1:35:27] the perfect lamb to die
[1:35:29] he says by that second thing was to
[1:35:31] restore the faith
[1:35:33] to restore the power and to restore the
[1:35:36] authority in the church let's give the
[1:35:39] Lord and Prince
[1:35:46] in fundamental foundation for Faith he
[1:35:48] says what did Christ redeem us for did
[1:35:51] you ever think what he redeemed us for
[1:35:54] why didn't he just make you the
[1:35:55] atonement and say now there's no need of
[1:35:58] giving them deep powers
[1:35:59] there's no need in making this man a Son
[1:36:01] of God there's no need in doing that I
[1:36:04] will just ask him to believe it and
[1:36:06] write his name in the book of heaven and
[1:36:08] that will settle it he says but he gave
[1:36:11] us these redeemed blessings that we
[1:36:13] might operate
[1:36:15] the work of God
[1:36:18] that you and I might operate the work of
[1:36:21] God this is why brother Norris is
[1:36:23] speaking about
[1:36:24] he says by what by the energy of the
[1:36:27] Holy Spirit
[1:36:29] my my
[1:36:31] why because I'm the vine you are the
[1:36:34] branches
[1:36:35] and the prophet says he throws his life
[1:36:38] into the branches because you are to
[1:36:40] obey the fruit
[1:36:43] so you are to operate the work of God by
[1:36:46] the energy of the Holy Spirit
[1:36:49] [Applause]
[1:36:50] let's give the Lord and the praise
[1:37:03] now if we come to do to my subject the
[1:37:06] scripture that we read
[1:37:09] they were all Witnesses of the
[1:37:12] Resurrection
[1:37:13] in a message proof of his resurrection
[1:37:15] the prophet speaks about it this way he
[1:37:17] says the resurrection is just as vital
[1:37:20] today
[1:37:22] just as real to every human heart that
[1:37:26] believes it
[1:37:27] so in other words if we preach it and we
[1:37:29] believe it
[1:37:31] we don't deny the power thereof
[1:37:34] he says it is absolutely vital for today
[1:37:37] he says as it was to Mary Magdalene and
[1:37:40] him that stood at the grave that morning
[1:37:42] who seen him
[1:37:46] and what happened he says and there her
[1:37:48] name is called
[1:37:51] so she was a witness to the resurrection
[1:37:53] he says and when she seen him she heard
[1:37:56] her name Mary
[1:37:58] the prophet says she turned around and
[1:38:00] said rabboni
[1:38:02] or master
[1:38:04] he says that's just as real to every
[1:38:06] artist morning that is Born Again of the
[1:38:09] spirit of God by the resurrection power
[1:38:14] now as it was to that woman standing
[1:38:16] there at that morning so it's just as
[1:38:19] vital for you and I today and what
[1:38:21] happened in this day in this age in this
[1:38:23] evening time message the prophet says
[1:38:25] that he is the seals that was open
[1:38:28] in other words when you open up the
[1:38:30] seals and he preached the Mysteries did
[1:38:33] you hear your name
[1:38:35] he said not all my Neville will leave
[1:38:37] Vail the mystery was preached but what
[1:38:40] did you hear you heard your name
[1:38:42] [Applause]
[1:38:44] so you are a witness to the resurrection
[1:38:46] of God
[1:38:48] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:38:50] forever
[1:38:52] my my mind
[1:38:54] that's the scripture that's what I
[1:38:58] believe to be the truth and that's what
[1:39:00] I accept
[1:39:01] he's the same in principle he's the same
[1:39:05] in power he's the same in his love he's
[1:39:08] the same in every way that he was then
[1:39:13] now God raised him up and if God hadn't
[1:39:16] been with him he would have never raised
[1:39:19] him on the third day
[1:39:21] he says the father that sent him was
[1:39:24] always with him
[1:39:27] went with him
[1:39:29] to the grave and he says and raised him
[1:39:31] up on the third day
[1:39:33] now I want to get to the road to be
[1:39:35] amazed because that's our type and I
[1:39:37] love it the way the prophet brings this
[1:39:38] one he says now
[1:39:41] they were followers of Jesus disciples
[1:39:44] cleopas and his friend is now
[1:39:46] downhearted
[1:39:48] on the road to Emmaus
[1:39:50] a man joins them
[1:39:56] and ask him why are you so sad
[1:40:01] and cleopas and his friends turns to
[1:40:03] this man and says but are you a stranger
[1:40:06] don't you know what happened
[1:40:09] Jesus the master
[1:40:11] has died he says he was this man that
[1:40:14] was approved of God by signs and wonders
[1:40:18] he says then we were following his
[1:40:20] ministry he says but now he's dead
[1:40:24] and this man tells to them and says but
[1:40:26] don't you know the scriptures
[1:40:29] don't you know that he was to come into
[1:40:30] the world to do this
[1:40:32] he was to come into the world to fulfill
[1:40:35] this
[1:40:36] [Applause]
[1:40:38] in order to do what he says to bring
[1:40:41] back that power to the church
[1:40:43] [Applause]
[1:40:47] now he says in proof of his resurrection
[1:40:48] he says do you know that he walked out
[1:40:50] under disguisement
[1:40:52] why am I
[1:40:55] he says and he appeared to them in the
[1:40:57] form of a man
[1:40:58] [Applause]
[1:41:00] if this is our type he appeared at this
[1:41:02] end time in the form of a man
[1:41:04] [Applause]
[1:41:05] but in the evening time
[1:41:08] he made like he was going to go by
[1:41:12] what did they do they said abide with us
[1:41:15] the prophet says and as soon as they
[1:41:17] come on the inside and the door is
[1:41:19] closed he said then he made himself made
[1:41:22] manifest
[1:41:22] [Applause]
[1:41:26] then he showed
[1:41:28] [Applause]
[1:41:30] so that they were so sad that it died
[1:41:33] I'm alive today just as I was
[1:41:37] in that day
[1:41:39] now this is our type now
[1:41:41] he says he made himself known to them by
[1:41:44] the way of doing something when he took
[1:41:46] the bread and he broke it
[1:41:48] in other words the opening of the word
[1:41:51] this was Christ is the mystery of God
[1:41:53] revealed and all along the road to
[1:41:56] Emmaus he was preaching he said the
[1:41:58] prophet says that was the church ages
[1:42:00] because all he was doing to them he was
[1:42:02] showing him in Luther that was me
[1:42:05] Wesley that was me
[1:42:07] Pentecost that was me now we're here now
[1:42:09] and now we're on the inside and now he's
[1:42:12] gonna reveal himself
[1:42:15] let's give the Lord and a praise
[1:42:19] and their eyes were open
[1:42:21] and they knew him
[1:42:24] now it'll be light in the evening time
[1:42:27] and what is the prophet says the path of
[1:42:29] Glory we will surely find
[1:42:31] now that email's experience is for you
[1:42:34] and I
[1:42:35] he says we know our Lord is risen from
[1:42:36] the dead for we've seen him and we know
[1:42:39] that he is real
[1:42:41] proof of his resurrection what it is is
[1:42:45] the last days that God is going to raise
[1:42:47] men with messages with power with
[1:42:50] Deliverance with the power of the Gospel
[1:42:52] to prove that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:42:54] yesterday today and forevermore
[1:42:58] the prophet says I know it sounds
[1:42:59] excitable no wonder we're living in an
[1:43:02] exciting time
[1:43:04] my my
[1:43:05] yes it is we're living in the last days
[1:43:08] when God through every holy prophet
[1:43:11] through all the Old Testament through
[1:43:13] the New Testament has prophesied that in
[1:43:15] the time or in the end time the same
[1:43:17] things that took place in the beginning
[1:43:19] would happen in the end time
[1:43:21] my my
[1:43:22] and as the darkness would Fleet away and
[1:43:26] the Gospel Light will shine across the
[1:43:28] corridors of the earth once more before
[1:43:31] the coming of the Lord
[1:43:32] and that was the ministry of the Prophet
[1:43:34] at the end time
[1:43:35] and that was the faith that He restored
[1:43:38] now
[1:43:40] I want to continue in Witnesses
[1:43:43] can you just give me a bit more volume
[1:43:45] on the monitors
[1:43:51] in promise of witnesses
[1:43:55] the prophet continues there he says they
[1:43:57] heard the Holy Spirit coming like a
[1:43:59] mighty rushing wind
[1:44:01] they saw tons of fire set upon each of
[1:44:04] them
[1:44:05] and they were both in I and in ear
[1:44:08] witnesses that God had fulfilled the
[1:44:10] promise
[1:44:12] of the father so in other words they
[1:44:14] were Witnesses of the Resurrection
[1:44:16] a coming Kingdom of Witnesses in a
[1:44:18] Witnesses of his resurrection there will
[1:44:21] be Witnesses of his power there will be
[1:44:23] witnesses that he is alive
[1:44:25] you are my Witnesses according to acts 1
[1:44:28] 8 Christ spoke of of it being his
[1:44:31] kingdom that was coming in power
[1:44:33] in the 16th chapter of Matthew verily I
[1:44:36] say unto you some standing here shall
[1:44:39] not see death until they see the coming
[1:44:42] of God
[1:44:43] of the king the the kingdom of God
[1:44:45] coming in power
[1:44:46] why because you shall receive power
[1:44:49] after the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[1:44:51] that's the witness that God was looking
[1:44:53] for
[1:44:54] he says a witness after the Holy Ghost
[1:44:56] has come upon you but a witness of what
[1:44:59] a witness of the resurrected king that's
[1:45:01] the True Church of the Living God
[1:45:04] now he says if there is no Holy Spirit
[1:45:07] to vindicate it then I couldn't believe
[1:45:10] the resurrection
[1:45:11] I wouldn't have nothing but the theology
[1:45:14] I wouldn't have nothing but a mental
[1:45:16] conception he says but we have a direct
[1:45:19] Witness
[1:45:21] a direct Witness
[1:45:23] he says the holy spirit is the witness
[1:45:25] of the resurrection of Jesus
[1:45:27] because that's what he sent he said it's
[1:45:30] experience that I go
[1:45:32] so that I can send the promise of my
[1:45:34] father
[1:45:35] now the very things that I shall do you
[1:45:39] will do also even greater than this why
[1:45:41] because I go unto the father
[1:45:44] now for you and I he says that's the
[1:45:46] thing tonight he says not arguing of
[1:45:48] religion
[1:45:49] he says we don't want to be arguing
[1:45:51] about different phases or arguing about
[1:45:53] different church denomination he says or
[1:45:55] arguing about our different nations what
[1:45:57] the world needs to hear tonight or needs
[1:46:00] to know tonight is that Jesus has risen
[1:46:04] from the dead and he lives amongst men
[1:46:07] my mama let's give the Lord and a praise
[1:46:09] [Applause]
[1:46:17] so as the father and it will satisfy us
[1:46:21] now this is the same life force that was
[1:46:24] that produced the fruit so in other
[1:46:26] words if we look at what had happened in
[1:46:28] the alphabra the prophet says petite was
[1:46:30] an unlearned man you couldn't even sign
[1:46:32] his own name
[1:46:33] he says but what he was endured with
[1:46:35] power from an eye he says up until the
[1:46:38] time when he was his very Shadow would
[1:46:40] heal the sick
[1:46:41] the prophet says what was that that was
[1:46:43] the Dynamics in the quickening power he
[1:46:45] says that was the spirit of Christ in
[1:46:47] the apostles what was it it was the
[1:46:49] spirit of Christ in the apostles and
[1:46:52] that is the faith that they had
[1:46:54] in other words that this was a
[1:46:55] resurrected living Jesus Christ in the
[1:46:59] apostles
[1:46:59] [Applause]
[1:47:03] and he says now the spirit of Christ in
[1:47:06] the apostles was what was doing that
[1:47:10] 33 years later Jude said continually
[1:47:13] condemned for that face
[1:47:17] my my
[1:47:18] [Applause]
[1:47:19] God's provided away that's what it is
[1:47:21] today friend so many people are trying
[1:47:24] to get in but they're not taking God's
[1:47:27] provided entrance
[1:47:31] and if you go any other way besides
[1:47:33] Jesus Christ and when the apostles come
[1:47:35] into Jesus Christ when the early church
[1:47:37] came into Jesus they received the
[1:47:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost it made them a
[1:47:42] different people
[1:47:44] it made them act different
[1:47:46] it made them live differently
[1:47:49] their whole life was motivated
[1:47:52] different
[1:47:54] they had different motives
[1:47:56] they had different objectives everything
[1:47:59] was different when they come into Christ
[1:48:02] so that's what we want to do we want to
[1:48:04] come into Christ and the prophet says
[1:48:07] how he says by one Spirit are we all
[1:48:09] baptized into that same body
[1:48:12] my mama let's give the Lord and the
[1:48:14] praise I'm trying to go quick
[1:48:17] because we got three services for today
[1:48:20] so I don't want to take up too much time
[1:48:25] the Seal of the Holy Ghost is God's true
[1:48:28] Easter seal
[1:48:29] he says it's a man's credentials
[1:48:32] so a credentials is it your
[1:48:34] qualification
[1:48:36] the Seal of the Holy Ghost is a man's
[1:48:38] credentials in in other words he says
[1:48:41] it's your Birthright
[1:48:43] Miami
[1:48:46] he says it's your Birthright it's your
[1:48:49] credential that you have passed from
[1:48:51] Death unto life and God is now working
[1:48:53] through you the same way that he did
[1:48:57] with Jesus
[1:48:58] why because that's your credentials and
[1:49:01] these signs shall follow them that
[1:49:03] believe
[1:49:05] what were they they were believers
[1:49:07] they were Believers in the living Jesus
[1:49:10] Christ a living resurrected Jesus Christ
[1:49:12] and what did God do he says he confirmed
[1:49:15] it with signs following so the Lord
[1:49:18] himself went with him confirming it
[1:49:24] what was it it was the life that was in
[1:49:27] Christ that was raised up has come now
[1:49:30] and it quickened this church
[1:49:33] and lives in the church to do the same
[1:49:36] signs
[1:49:37] my my mind let's give the Lord and a
[1:49:39] praise
[1:49:46] now the prophet says that I represent
[1:49:48] that faith
[1:49:49] in through Easter seal the prophet says
[1:49:51] this
[1:49:53] if he can reveal now he's in discernment
[1:49:56] he says if he can reveal to me by his
[1:49:58] holy spirit the resurrected Christ
[1:50:01] who come here and give me a temporary
[1:50:04] Resurrection by my spirit
[1:50:07] listen to the prophet
[1:50:09] that my spirit goes away now and his
[1:50:12] Spirit comes in
[1:50:13] then to let you know whether he is alive
[1:50:15] or not
[1:50:17] why am I I represent this Faith the
[1:50:20] prophet was demonstrating it
[1:50:23] he says he gives me a temporary
[1:50:26] Resurrection by my spirit that my spirit
[1:50:27] goes away and ye Spirit comes in and
[1:50:30] then to let you know whether he is alive
[1:50:32] or not
[1:50:34] now I don't know you
[1:50:37] he says that's me and my spirit
[1:50:40] I don't know you he says we don't know
[1:50:43] you but he knows you
[1:50:46] now he wants to just borrow my body to
[1:50:49] prove that he is the resurrected Christ
[1:50:52] my my
[1:50:54] I'm so happy to loan it to him
[1:51:01] I'm so happy to loan my body to him so
[1:51:05] that the resurrected Christ can work
[1:51:07] through me
[1:51:08] oh this is our wave Chief this is the
[1:51:10] this is the faith that He restored you
[1:51:13] are showing exactly what they were doing
[1:51:14] he says I'm so happy to loan it to him
[1:51:17] to give it to him and anything he can
[1:51:19] get out of it
[1:51:21] and then he continues in the discernment
[1:51:23] he says you've seen somebody coming from
[1:51:25] a distance but I couldn't tell just
[1:51:27] where it was at yeah it's the man
[1:51:29] sitting right here I see him now he's a
[1:51:31] stranger to me also you got gallbladder
[1:51:34] trouble sinus trouble you're not from
[1:51:36] here you from Georgia a place called
[1:51:37] like aubamol Georgia all right believe
[1:51:40] now and go back home and be healed
[1:51:44] now the prophet was showing it now
[1:51:46] again I'm firing quickly because uh I
[1:51:49] don't want to take too much time
[1:51:50] in
[1:51:52] earnestly containing 56
[1:51:56] the prophet says if a woman touched His
[1:51:58] Garment and he felt virtue go out of him
[1:52:00] and he does this and he doesn't do the
[1:52:04] same thing today then he's not the same
[1:52:07] but the scripture says that he's the
[1:52:08] same yesterday today and forever in
[1:52:11] other words he is immutable in all his
[1:52:12] way he's unchanging
[1:52:14] and the prophet says if that same Spirit
[1:52:16] dwells in you it will Quicken your
[1:52:18] mortal body but it will also do the very
[1:52:20] same thing that he done that that Spirit
[1:52:23] done when he was in his body
[1:52:25] now he says what did they touch him with
[1:52:28] they touched him with a face touch and
[1:52:30] brother Peter touching all of this he
[1:52:32] says even with blind but the Muse he
[1:52:33] says it was a faith cry because he had
[1:52:36] faith
[1:52:37] in the living Jesus Christ thing
[1:52:40] he says and that's how he touched him in
[1:52:42] Masterpiece he says now
[1:52:46] again I want to bring it back to the to
[1:52:48] the prophet now saying that he
[1:52:49] represents his face he says no to hear
[1:52:50] the life that was in the husk and in the
[1:52:53] stock and in the tassel uh is all
[1:52:55] gathered up now into the seed and the
[1:52:57] life that was in the stock went one went
[1:53:00] to make the other justification made a
[1:53:02] way for sanctification sanctification
[1:53:04] made a way for the baptism of the Holy
[1:53:05] Ghost we know this quote the baptism of
[1:53:07] the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy
[1:53:09] Ghost itself
[1:53:10] to come right down in perfection
[1:53:13] back to the word again to do what to
[1:53:16] manifest itself in other words to
[1:53:19] manifest the word again
[1:53:21] and I was thinking about it this way you
[1:53:23] know if the prophet was it was was was
[1:53:24] that wave shift to bring it back and and
[1:53:28] immediately I thought of Tommy Osborne's
[1:53:30] uh uh testimony speaking on brother
[1:53:33] Branham he says I saw Christ in that man
[1:53:37] I mean this this this was the wave Chief
[1:53:40] and he was showing exactly what kind of
[1:53:42] a faith they had the hand of faith in
[1:53:45] the in the living resurrected Christ
[1:53:47] that was in them
[1:53:50] he says until until you know the the
[1:53:53] character that he that he showed
[1:53:55] Tommy Osborne said I saw Christ in that
[1:53:58] man
[1:53:59] and that is what we want to come to as
[1:54:01] the as the Omega Prime this is what we
[1:54:03] want to contend for we want to contend
[1:54:05] to have the living resurrected Christ
[1:54:08] working in this bright body he says
[1:54:11] working in you waking working through
[1:54:13] you
[1:54:14] [Applause]
[1:54:16] now through Easter seal
[1:54:21] I don't care how many seals you try to
[1:54:24] put over it
[1:54:25] and he's talking about the Roman seal at
[1:54:27] the time when they when when he died
[1:54:29] they put him in the Tomb they sealed the
[1:54:31] tomb
[1:54:32] because they knew that there was a
[1:54:34] prophecy
[1:54:35] and they were scared that okay no the
[1:54:37] disciples will steal the body
[1:54:39] and say okay he's risen
[1:54:42] the prophet says now he broke that seal
[1:54:44] of the Tomb
[1:54:46] he broke the Seal of hell he broke the
[1:54:48] Seal of death he broke the Seal of the
[1:54:51] grave and he arose forevermore and
[1:54:54] triumphed over the grave deaths held
[1:54:56] tombs every manner every man might think
[1:54:59] that there was to show that he was God
[1:55:02] and cannot be sealed away from the
[1:55:04] people anymore
[1:55:06] he cannot be sealed away from the people
[1:55:08] anymore my my
[1:55:11] now God forever he says nothing can hold
[1:55:13] him the grave couldn't
[1:55:15] he says be dug deep enough or Hell
[1:55:18] couldn't be hot enough to keep him away
[1:55:21] for he that believeth in me the works
[1:55:24] that I do shall you do also and even
[1:55:27] greater than this because I go unto my
[1:55:30] father this gives the Lord and a praise
[1:55:38] what is the works of God
[1:55:40] it's the fullness of the power of the
[1:55:43] resurrection of Jesus
[1:55:44] the light has come out and the same holy
[1:55:47] spirit is the same
[1:55:49] move that it moved in the first church
[1:55:52] in the east
[1:55:56] the Eastern people has come out at the
[1:55:58] setting time on the western people
[1:55:59] bringing the same gospel that it that
[1:56:02] that it is to say the Full Gospel the
[1:56:04] fullness of the power of the
[1:56:06] resurrection of Jesus Christ we're
[1:56:07] living in the setting of the Sun in
[1:56:10] other words the same way that that
[1:56:12] gospel came to them not in word only but
[1:56:14] in power it's come to you and I in that
[1:56:17] very same way
[1:56:18] now again coming back to the prophet now
[1:56:20] he says now
[1:56:22] again in Discerning he says she's here
[1:56:25] for some purpose now God knows that I
[1:56:28] don't know but if he reveals it then the
[1:56:32] Christianity of ad33 is in operation now
[1:56:36] in 1955.
[1:56:38] that's what he was demonstrating
[1:56:40] because that's what He restored
[1:56:43] I mean we can say the very same thing
[1:56:44] that same Christianity of 1833 operation
[1:56:48] in 1955 we're looking for it to be in
[1:56:51] operation in 2023
[1:56:54] because that's the faith that was
[1:56:57] restored
[1:56:59] and the prophecy is that the bride
[1:57:02] coming of Christ
[1:57:03] and that's what we're going to be seeing
[1:57:05] and that's what we want to see that's
[1:57:06] what we want to contend for
[1:57:10] then it is the rising of the sun he
[1:57:12] speaks about the gasoline
[1:57:13] he says well you say the power is in the
[1:57:16] gasoline brother Brennan but I don't
[1:57:18] care how much power is in the gasoline
[1:57:21] unless there's a spark
[1:57:23] to manifest that power
[1:57:25] [Applause]
[1:57:28] there's a power there to confirm that
[1:57:30] that's gasoline
[1:57:32] in other words it can be a can of
[1:57:34] gasoline but how do we know that there
[1:57:35] might be water in there he says put a
[1:57:38] spark on it and then you'll see
[1:57:41] in other words we need them the the
[1:57:43] Dynamics to make that thing come alive
[1:57:46] he says the gasoline represents the word
[1:57:49] it's the truth but without the spirit it
[1:57:52] won't move
[1:57:55] so we need that Spirit to make it move
[1:57:58] we have we have put too much stress on
[1:58:01] the mechanics and nothing on the
[1:58:02] Dynamics it needs the dynamic power of
[1:58:05] God he says the resurrection power of
[1:58:08] Jesus Christ upon the church to do what
[1:58:12] to manifest to bring to pass that this
[1:58:15] is gasoline
[1:58:19] we want the spark
[1:58:21] to prove to Satan that this is gasoline
[1:58:24] [Applause]
[1:58:26] why because the church is the word she
[1:58:29] is him
[1:58:30] [Applause]
[1:58:32] the prophet says he says
[1:58:35] listen to this
[1:58:39] it could still be water he says but the
[1:58:41] only proof of it is put this life on it
[1:58:44] in other words bring that life and put
[1:58:46] it on top of that day he says that will
[1:58:48] prove whether it's gasoline or not
[1:58:57] he says I'm so glad that there is a ten
[1:58:59] thousand octane power the word of God
[1:59:02] and the Holy Ghost to light it up
[1:59:06] to resurrect the power of God into a
[1:59:09] man's life or a woman's life or into a
[1:59:12] church that shove that Cadillac down the
[1:59:15] road Yonder under the Dynamics power of
[1:59:17] the Holy Ghost which came back and was
[1:59:19] waved over the people on the day of
[1:59:22] Pentecost making him what the same
[1:59:25] yesterday today and forever
[1:59:28] and he was waved in our day making him
[1:59:30] the same yesterday today and forever why
[1:59:33] because it was a combination of Dynamics
[1:59:35] and mechanics
[1:59:37] now the prophet says in the rising of
[1:59:39] the Sunday has been churches churches
[1:59:41] Brides brides he says but there has got
[1:59:45] to come one
[1:59:47] there has got the Dynamics and the
[1:59:49] mechanics together
[1:59:51] there has to come a real Pride
[1:59:55] that's God booth he says it makes that
[1:59:59] church move
[2:00:00] in the power of the Resurrection
[2:00:03] [Applause]
[2:00:06] if that Pride tree ever puts forth
[2:00:11] another Branch it will be exactly the
[2:00:14] same
[2:00:14] as that first Alpha bride
[2:00:17] why because she will move in the power
[2:00:20] of the Resurrection
[2:00:22] why because the Dynamics is what's
[2:00:24] moving her
[2:00:26] and the prophet says that will prove to
[2:00:28] Satan that he's alive a resurrected God
[2:00:31] in his church until that church becomes
[2:00:35] both mechanics and Dynamics the spirit
[2:00:37] of God that moved him to do the things
[2:00:39] that he did if he hit on 16 cylinders
[2:00:42] she must also
[2:00:45] he hit on 16 cylinders the bride will
[2:00:48] also eat on 16 cylinders
[2:00:51] he that believeth on me the works that I
[2:00:54] do shall you do also
[2:00:57] why because I give you my charge of my
[2:01:00] Dynamics
[2:01:01] he says into your mechanics and the
[2:01:04] world will not be able to withstand it
[2:01:07] let's give the Lord and the prison the
[2:01:10] world will not be able to withstand it
[2:01:13] he says because I give you my charge of
[2:01:15] Dynamics
[2:01:16] into your mechanics
[2:01:19] he says now remember the mechanics
[2:01:21] without the Dynamics is no good and
[2:01:23] neither is the Dynamics without the
[2:01:25] mechanics no good
[2:01:26] he says well Paul said the gospel came
[2:01:28] to us not in word only in other words
[2:01:31] not through the gasoline only but
[2:01:34] through a spark
[2:01:35] to make it move
[2:01:37] my mind there you are it came to us in
[2:01:41] that manner and that is what this old
[2:01:43] Mega bride is going to have
[2:01:46] in the mechanics and the Dynamics
[2:01:48] together
[2:01:48] I want to read this quote here he says
[2:01:50] in the bride coming of Christ
[2:01:53] the coming out of the church they will
[2:01:55] have to be a sheath waived in the last
[2:01:57] days the waving of the Sheaf the first
[2:02:01] one that come to mature is the first one
[2:02:03] that proved it was wheat and that it
[2:02:06] would prove it was a chief I'm sure you
[2:02:08] see what I'm talking about it was waived
[2:02:11] over the people
[2:02:12] and the first time they will come forth
[2:02:14] for the bright age for a resurrection
[2:02:17] out of dark denomination will be a
[2:02:20] message
[2:02:22] [Applause]
[2:02:23] [Music]
[2:02:24] [Applause]
[2:02:29] the full maturity of the word has turned
[2:02:32] back again
[2:02:33] in its full power
[2:02:36] and being waved over the People by the
[2:02:39] same signs and wonders that he did back
[2:02:42] there why because I love you will love
[2:02:45] also he says he's speaking of his wife
[2:02:48] because I love you love also what a
[2:02:51] resurrection that was
[2:02:54] he says what the resurrection this is to
[2:02:57] be quickened from dead to be made alive
[2:03:00] in Jesus in Christ Jesus by what the
[2:03:04] quickening power my my he was waved to
[2:03:07] them the word which he was was waved
[2:03:09] back to them on the day of Pentecost
[2:03:11] then the word came into a manifestation
[2:03:13] and it is waved again in this day
[2:03:16] praise
[2:03:19] we almost there
[2:03:24] in a second-handed Robi says we've got
[2:03:26] Pentecost he says but where is the god
[2:03:27] of Pentecost
[2:03:30] he says what's that's the next thing in
[2:03:33] other words if the baptism of the Holy
[2:03:35] Ghost gave away for the Holy Ghost
[2:03:37] itself to step forward the person of the
[2:03:39] Holy Ghost if Elijah is out typed in
[2:03:41] what did Elijah say they said where is
[2:03:43] the god of Elijah
[2:03:45] so in other words where is the god of
[2:03:48] Elijah we want the person of the Holy
[2:03:50] Spirit to step forth into his bright
[2:03:52] body if the servant of God does the work
[2:03:55] of God he has to have the power of God
[2:03:59] my my
[2:04:02] so the quickening power is what will
[2:04:04] produce it he says
[2:04:06] watch a perfect god with a perfect heart
[2:04:10] keep a perfect Promise by the perfect
[2:04:12] word he says which is sharper than the
[2:04:14] two-edges sword and a discerner and the
[2:04:16] thoughts on the intents of the heart
[2:04:17] we're coming now to the Perfection
[2:04:19] because the people has to come to this
[2:04:21] in order for the rapture
[2:04:24] that's what's holding it away right now
[2:04:26] is waiting for that church to come into
[2:04:29] that perfect raptured faith he says
[2:04:33] looking for it it means a lot of Shaving
[2:04:34] down for me it means a lot for you but
[2:04:37] together we're going to make it by the
[2:04:40] grace of God
[2:04:42] that's a promise
[2:04:44] that's a promise the prophet preached in
[2:04:47] perfect faith
[2:04:48] he says together we're gonna make it by
[2:04:51] the grace of God he says the Holy Ghost
[2:04:53] he says Christ in the person of the Holy
[2:04:55] Ghost comes upon you in true baptism of
[2:04:59] the Holy Ghost and you got all these
[2:05:01] virtues sealed in you then God is living
[2:05:04] in a tabernacle called the building
[2:05:08] he says the living Tabernacle of the
[2:05:10] living God's dwelling place that's the
[2:05:13] powerhouse
[2:05:14] that's the dwelling place
[2:05:16] that's this bright body that is going to
[2:05:19] produce himself through
[2:05:21] a body that God can dwell in he says a
[2:05:25] body that God can walk in a body that
[2:05:27] God can see in he says he can talk in
[2:05:30] God can work in living instrumentality
[2:05:33] of God walking on two feet in you the
[2:05:38] footsteps of the righteous is ordered of
[2:05:40] God he says God is walking in you for we
[2:05:43] are written a person's red of all men
[2:05:45] and if that life that's in Christ is in
[2:05:47] you you will bear that life that Christ
[2:05:51] born
[2:05:52] my my and what is it that's the Thunder
[2:05:56] that will shake the devil
[2:05:59] the prophet says a holy consecrated life
[2:06:02] he says in the very same way that he
[2:06:05] shook the devil's Kingdom that time
[2:06:07] that's the Thunder that will shake the
[2:06:09] devil and listen let's say let's stand
[2:06:11] off if the musicians can come
[2:06:14] my my
[2:06:16] I wanted to fire quick I think we went
[2:06:18] well
[2:06:20] musicians can come up
[2:06:23] I wanna end up with this one thing and I
[2:06:25] mean it's two two short quotes
[2:06:27] proof of his resurrection the prophet
[2:06:29] speaks about this and and when I came
[2:06:31] across this quote you know it really
[2:06:33] blessed me because I was just thinking
[2:06:34] of it it sounded very familiar
[2:06:38] if you go to X3
[2:06:41] Peter
[2:06:42] [Music]
[2:06:43] Peter and John comes to the gate
[2:06:45] beautiful
[2:06:47] and they see this lame man standing
[2:06:49] there and he's begging for arms
[2:06:52] and in the Scripture it says they turned
[2:06:54] and said to him look on us
[2:06:58] and the prophet says he says he was he
[2:07:00] thought okay by them saying that like
[2:07:01] you know he was going to be receiving
[2:07:03] something
[2:07:04] why did they turn around and they said
[2:07:06] he said they said but let's he said
[2:07:08] solvent gold every nun
[2:07:10] he said but there's something that we've
[2:07:11] got
[2:07:13] they had something that they were able
[2:07:15] to depart
[2:07:17] so in other words look on us
[2:07:19] and he turns expecting arms
[2:07:22] he says but this Peter turned around and
[2:07:25] said rise up
[2:07:27] and walk
[2:07:28] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he
[2:07:31] says that was the life that they were
[2:07:33] imparting
[2:07:34] [Applause]
[2:07:35] why because they had a faith in a
[2:07:39] resurrected living Christ
[2:07:41] the very same way he was when he was on
[2:07:44] Earth before he died he was living
[2:07:47] amongst men
[2:07:49] now then I came across this scripture
[2:07:51] and that's why I said it sounded so
[2:07:52] familiar according to X3 the prophet
[2:07:55] brother Branham is in the discernment
[2:07:57] line again
[2:07:58] in 5504-10 you can play something first
[2:08:02] that's right but you see that he has
[2:08:05] raised from the dead you see that I've
[2:08:07] told you the truth
[2:08:09] then the prophet turns around and he
[2:08:10] says now look on me sir
[2:08:13] does that sound familiar
[2:08:15] I represent that faith
[2:08:18] he was demonstrating that faith
[2:08:22] he says look on me just a minute
[2:08:25] just in order that you and I could come
[2:08:28] in contact with the Lord Jesus the
[2:08:30] resurrected Lord Jesus
[2:08:32] if I be his servant Jesus said the
[2:08:35] things that I do shall you do also
[2:08:39] a little while in the world will see me
[2:08:41] no more that's the unbeliever that won't
[2:08:43] see him no more
[2:08:45] he says they're out
[2:08:46] at the ball games and swimmings and so
[2:08:49] forth they'll never see him
[2:08:51] but ye shall see me for I'll be with you
[2:08:55] in you to the end of the world then if
[2:08:57] he's raised from the dead and he is
[2:09:00] standing here this morning
[2:09:02] this is the prophet he says he's raised
[2:09:04] from the dead he's standing here this
[2:09:06] morning in the discernment line
[2:09:08] and this anointing that I have isn't
[2:09:11] mine
[2:09:13] does that sound familiar
[2:09:15] according to X3
[2:09:18] he says this anointing that if isn't
[2:09:20] mine but it's his
[2:09:21] then you couldn't even hide your life if
[2:09:24] you had to because we in contact with
[2:09:27] one another by spirit being
[2:09:30] if God can reveal to me what you're
[2:09:32] standing there for will you accept it
[2:09:34] with your heart the brother says yes he
[2:09:37] says you will do it
[2:09:39] and then this is my final quote
[2:09:43] the quickening power wasn't only in the
[2:09:45] soul
[2:09:46] but it was all over them
[2:09:49] not only the Dynamics comes in to
[2:09:51] Quicken but it quickened the mechanics
[2:09:54] you see what I mean they were so quick
[2:09:56] until their tongues begin to speak in
[2:09:59] another language
[2:10:00] they were so quickened by the power of
[2:10:02] the resurrection of Christ until they
[2:10:05] laid their hands they were so quick and
[2:10:07] with the quickening power so when they
[2:10:09] laid their hands upon the sick they got
[2:10:11] well
[2:10:12] it quickens your mortal body
[2:10:16] they were healed by the laying on of
[2:10:18] hands the spirit quickened their
[2:10:21] Fellowship together with God told they
[2:10:23] also was so quickened into the presence
[2:10:25] of God until when a person died
[2:10:28] their soul had gone off
[2:10:31] it could be called back to life again
[2:10:33] that is the quickening power
[2:10:36] now brother sister that deity now is in
[2:10:39] you
[2:10:41] a little while in the world would see me
[2:10:43] no more yet you shall see me for I will
[2:10:46] be with you even in you to the end of
[2:10:47] the age Christ is in a Manger no it is
[2:10:50] Christ in you we're not worshiping
[2:10:53] Christ in a Manger but Christ in you the
[2:10:55] Holy Ghost the hope of Life The Creator
[2:10:58] God himself dwelling in the human being
[2:11:00] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[2:11:04] but we'll see him as is for will be made
[2:11:07] like him the spirit in the human being
[2:11:11] the resurrected living Christ may the
[2:11:13] Lord bless you
[2:11:14] my mama
[2:11:15] [Music]

[2:15:56] word Lord God
[2:15:58] we are thankful for the inspiration Lord
[2:16:02] earnestly contending for the faith
[2:16:06] Lord we are living in a time where some
[2:16:11] oh God have departed from this fate
[2:16:15] but Lord we are thankful Lord that there
[2:16:19] are people
[2:16:20] gathered here today Lord
[2:16:22] and there is a bride around the world
[2:16:25] that contending for the Faith Lord God
[2:16:29] lord not just for the letter of the word
[2:16:32] Lord God not just for the letter of the
[2:16:35] the message Lord God not just for oh God
[2:16:39] a mechanics Lord God but one a bride
[2:16:43] Lord that's contending to be a bride
[2:16:47] exactly as the alpha church was exactly
[2:16:52] as the alpha bride was we are have a
[2:16:55] people Lord contending to be an Omega
[2:16:59] bride oh God and we know oh God that
[2:17:03] this Omega bride that the glory of the
[2:17:06] Omega bride is going to be greater than
[2:17:09] the glory of the alpha bride father we
[2:17:12] have received our perfect word and there
[2:17:15] is a people here oh god with the ability
[2:17:18] to receive this word dong in a soul we
[2:17:22] are contending for your righteousness oh
[2:17:26] God that the mechanics could be formed
[2:17:29] in our heart the divine nature of Christ
[2:17:33] so that the Dynamics the Holy Spirit
[2:17:36] could come and see the bride oh God we
[2:17:41] thank you for the inspiration we thank
[2:17:44] you for the messages thus far and we
[2:17:46] thank you for what will come for we know

[2:18:14] come Lord May the word go may we go from
[2:18:17] Faith to Faith from Revelation to
[2:18:20] Revelation oh God that at the end of
[2:18:23] this convention your people the Dynamics
[2:18:27] would be more established oh God as we
[2:18:30] wait upon the mechanics we know the
