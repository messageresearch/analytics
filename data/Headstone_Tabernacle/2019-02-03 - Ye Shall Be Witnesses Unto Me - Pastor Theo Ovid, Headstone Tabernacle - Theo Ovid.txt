to come out to come out join us in that time of Prayer you can the Lord on Friday so this morning we wanted to know by bus the matchup defines sin John chapter one and Acts chapter 1 for scripture reading this morning we will mark five reading from verse 25 on a certain woman which had an issue of blood twelve years had suffered many things of many physicians who spent all that she had and was nothing bettered but rather grew with when she had heard of Jesus came in the press behind and touched His garment for she said if I may touch but his clothes I shall behold and straightway the function of a blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague and Jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him turn him about in the press and said who touched my clothes and his disciples said unto Him those years the multitude thronging thee and says thou who touch me and he looked around about to see her that had done this thing and the woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done in her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth he said unto her daughter thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace and be whole of thy plague Saint John one we informed with eleven to fourteen he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth on our last Scripture one verse was acts 1:8 familias scripture and ye shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and he shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and to the uttermost part of the earth may God bless his word we may be seated praise the name of the Lord o blessed be the name of the Lord as we said on Wednesday night in going forward a once I'm preaching I'll be making reference to Azusa Street and some pointers of Azusa Street revival revival that took place in 1906 where the Holy Spirit God came down enough powerful way and what I didn't even realize that the brother Seymour he prophesied that there were going to be another revival it will be about a hundred years from now because I've revival has died out and then go send a prophet messenger because he needed that atmosphere for the Prophet messenger to come into it so 1906 by 1946 rival dead gone the angel of the Lord appeared unto brother Branham and give him a message to bring to a Gentile bride that is how you got called out because a Pentecostal was like shocked and brother Branham brought the word which was the seed so he we have a message what by a 20th century prophet and the message itself is dost see at the Lord the message itself is not word only the message itself is not teaching only it is not information only on books only that's what we have had for 4050 years the message is a little more than that my title tonight is ye shall be witnesses unto me that is Jesus words to his disciples ye shall be witnesses unto me and I have an inspiration virtual powerful service were cheap awful our witness is to see something experienced something to be there a person who is present say a car it cannot be a here see you have to be here to be a genuine witness and Jesus he's totally disciples you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me not your own witness your witness and Christ hallelujah you are going to represent Christ you are going to see Christ and I realize this is the problem with many people today the burden is not Christ it's a selfish thing it's about you is about your story is about how you feel and how you think is not about the Lord but you are promised to become a true witness I witness unto Jesus and that is why when Pizza healed a man he said you think by my power this man is made whole but in the name of Jesus it's not me it's Jesus so Peter was bearing witness of Jesus and as Jesus reflect God you shall reflect Christ as Jesus reflects and reveal God you can reveal Jesus Christ because Christ is the mystery of God revealed halleluja is going to be priced in new amen praise the name of the Lord please God so pride and selfishness and I was given a thing that was in permitting that Seymour who started this revival as user Street revival is a Negro man and he had he was half blind so a one-eyed man and God called him the first church he went to was a kind of radical Church the church had black and whites worship him and in those times at a segregation White's here blacks here so he went to a church that didn't believe in that was a white pasta but he did not believe in segregation so therefore he was there for a while he went to another Church and this church no preaching and teaching the baptism of the Holy Ghost but that preacher white preacher he believed in segregation so he believed that black and white not supposed to be together but Seymour was a humble man and he wanted to hear what to beat what is being taught about the baptism only goes so he was contented to be sitting on outside the church separated from the congregation to listen from outside what the man was teaching hallelujah glory to God and he learned something from the both sides once I was preaching unity when he went back to them they don't believe any button will use but they believe in unity this I don't believe energy but additionally baptism labels so he was able to draw from both sides and come down the middle with unity and power of the baptism of the Holy Ghost to activate a revival that we still feeling the effects of chlorine over because Mandan started revival is thought study reliable Alleluia the fire of the Holy Ghost was so hot over the roof people were seeing fire they were calling fire services to oak the fire that was on top that building or brewery record but it wasn't a natural fire it was a Holy Ghost fire and I am believing that same Holy Ghost that same fire but come W oh hang over the building come over you or give the Lord a show [Applause] marilla go as long as you remain separate and selfish the spirit cannot come hallelujah what would happen if we come to a unity of defeat hallelujah what would happen if the walls of partition is broken down and people begin to see themselves as brethren sons of God sons of the kingdom a kingdom that cannot be moved hallelujah what a power is gonna be a man were either God but a Branham was talking about what we need to do is some fire in the boiler you know damn long time try and use a Mumbai steam to get steam yada hot the water not warm water when water go produce steam it has to be boiled in water boiled in hot water and then the steam come out to produce a power to get that engine moving and the church avoid nowhere with lukewarm water oh come on now come on dings after gets hot in here [Applause] things things have to get hot in your life if you want things to move it has that's my cell rather hot on your call because if you're cold you're dead look what they're moving no train but if you're hurt we can just steal twice serious morning let's raise the temperature of praise let's raise the temperature of Prayer let's raise the temperature of worship and see what God's gonna do a favor here oh boy hallelujah here's a testimonial night I know but Abraham said Mr Lim will be restored but I didn't realize that that was done in the associate revival one man in the factory got his arm cut off everybody know it went to the Azusa Street and his arm grow back in seconds and Roboto when he went back to the factory everybody get baptized included manager of the factory this is not too hard because God watch dust and and bring a man o to dust don't open your eyes too big he said let us make man and he brought man out of the dust that God could give you a new kidney a new pantry us appear new eyes [Applause] that boy could dissolve cancer humor whatever sickness he is the same yesterday today and forever Oh glory to God hallelujah glory to God Amen hallelujah reflecting on Azusa Street when the power struck the saints they begin to speak in tongues Japanese people came in Bahia in Japanese here in the gospel in Japanese Russian coming back here the gospel in Russia a sister who never played piano before never read music before when display leaders come upon her she paint beyond he'll be home tomorrow what to speak any language god knows what you are made of [Applause] do you want to see that same power do you want to see that same anointing the other promise you

totem put some planets and those various that are silly the anointing was so powerful people coming off the train blocks away was feeling the power of God people will fallen on the street not by some

position on that seat there's only a Matta [Applause] but his shower AC power [Applause] therefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely he was afraid of him but all Israel and Judah loved David because he went out and came in before him before them oh praise God bless may God bless this world Oh hallelujah hallelujah so let's continue verbum says from a rising listen no matter how much the halogens clean oh well you got your church set how much education you got how much the Bible until that wave sheaf until the Holy Spirit comes upon that person to quicken the word the gasoline represents the word it's the truth but without the Spirit it won't move we have put too much stress on the mechanics and nothing on the dynamic it needs the dynamic power of God the resurrection power of Jesus Christ upon the church to manifest and bring to pass that is gasoline so regardless how people are taught how much mysteries they are taught how much revelations they are taught it needs that fire it needs the power to know if it is gasoline because if it is water you scratch how much on top I decided early much Auto [Music] it may be in a gasoline can but daddy - whoo - Selena the can outside my gasoline putting tape I'm printing gasoline stickers they make a gasolina playing box I'm playing careful making gasoline oh no laughter I read acid in on the inside so Amanda Lepore carries apostle or coal carries a pasta or coal carries evangelist that make me mentally let me stick on the outside there's a child a spirit gonna to vindicate it that is ready that so the previous gasoline at already met and when their chocolate it was gasoline boom you're here explosion you're gonna see fire if it's gasoline it is like a silly people just sit and steer old order your favorite even gasoline upon you and that might hit you you have to do something but these are hundre go up at least had my shake a little bit even even if you stiff neck the whole bloody night Musel but something I mean listen one time there was buried a dead man and he has some rubbers and vendors coming and he lies a grave I was there and they chopped the dead man denies any mental math alike on because it was written in Paulo not that power that was gasoline gasoline gasoline then I might come back to life equipment power that's what you're here for tonight till we see power oh poor little dead within a scripture he came unto his own and his own received him not they rejected him but as many as received him as many you know every right as many as we see them to them to them to those people see their power [Applause] to become the sons of God but to become backslidden not to be defeated but to be songs of God how have you received them have you received the way then power is promised the Spirit is promised to you who are received Christ the wind let's have receive the word first all glory that God Alleluia so much so this church is emphasizing the dynamics if anybody are so worried doing so we emphasizing dynamics tell them we have 50 years of mechanics and we think we we ready no for dynamics tell them the rims polish this decal looking good tell us they were first paint job but the engine we wanted started [Applause] and when he got to do that [Applause] to do that we're in the right direction here gonna hit my target oh yes [Applause] Alleluia saya no fool I'm

will not be manhandled poor will take the man handle oh my god like the Bible goes free look we give there are some phrases from revelation book of symbols brahms a gourd is waiting and trying and pressing to get the mystery of God revealed to his church that is what holding about the coming of Christ known and the great millennium is this great supernatural power that readily is dormant in the church he is seeing the mysteries are revealed what for was the purpose to say we have mysteries or attrition to have as much missiles we have plenty mysteries tons of it no that's not the purpose no is to get activated this great supernatural power that's why what about him says the mission of the seven thunders he say exists a mystery that will bring back a power into the church will we leap and run over walls not miss it at all and say well we talk I'm a famous no no no is this the mystery doctor bring back come on sunken power bring not a bra into the tricks Wow laughter come into the church so after the mysteries we have to see that mystery connecting to power not poverty reveal more mysteries so help me God people stuck in some time walk mystery board is a mystery only still wrapped up in mechanics it's a mystery and they don't want to leave a general because we see we see when Jesus came he made these fantasies with the mysteries of the Old Testament and and they had long had tall hats long beards nice guns no books no signs of wonders no miracles or nothing so when Jesus come on Jesus either just blast them he see you by default cut he's only looking keen on Sarah like didn't Boone's onions oh he busted them and sudden manifest what they hated him because he was showing them up they say we are Moses children our fathers eat manna in the wilderness he son everyone dead he said mood for Moses what I am moisés on my day and so forth it was a side of you who he was the people who was Scripture in the world you rejected him and those sinners like pita fisherman Kozma much you all them guys tax collector these are the kinds of receive Jesus because their name was a nut book you can't be a Christian really unless Lord in you to be that's why you in charge this morning consider the privilege and honor to get the opportunity just hear this word [Applause] [Music] so Christ he's not over stickin distance some of you are back slit and done that which is wrong you have lost that joy your water is dried up he is still in speaking distance of him he follows you yes I'd you're done you're depressed but he's following you he follows you he knows every move you make and everything you do he is longing to hear you call him on the scene of course sittin job is to make sure your moat get tight and your clothes when the birds get wounded the flying away that is the wind pressure and the bullet is wounded the flying a constellation a certain kind of a way certain job is to get you aside from the constellation of the group of the fine Birds and when it catch you on your side where you have no real guidance and leadership and so on picture in the corner there and you find yourself suffering all alone it doesn't have to be that is why you nimona people that's why in a group where you can get the help and support and the encouragement and in nutrient and his shrink them this one can be fed but it could be edified or you can be inspired it's more than just hearing words there's a community that is here there's a family that is here there's a blood flow of these in the same blood is the blood of Jesus hallelujah that brings life give us an opportunity to say you're my brother you my sister I'm praying for you hallelujah your chairs is my tears your pain is my pain when you suffer I am suffering hallelujah I have a point to prove that I am better than you the blood is for all of us the same blood for me is the same blood for you I love you I care for you I am gel with you I want to be have your back he's long and to hear you call on him on the scene and this great Pentecostal moved today God is waiting for you to call him on the scene you are not okay speaking distance with him don't you have done wrong sinned turn our backs on him don't things we ought not to do yet he is with us Christ said he is we will be with us isn't it strange that God wants the people to have a pattern to it when Jesus look upon the harvest he said the harvest is right the laborers are few you pray the lord of the harvest look the vision we talked about burner Brown 12 year old girl she was the day that very day the Lord tucked the prophet and tell him pray for her that that doesn't happen so God couldn't stop it because I was destiny that was what was supposed to happen but if a prophet tree if somebody pray you could flip it so I could now see how prophesies could feel the clock there could be a prophecy against your life you could have won more retailers but God because I prayer God flip that over and time filled that assignment whatever assignment on your life prayer could come and cancel that prayer to change the mind of God or go in a God if you read a cancer in this morning you can have it you will even know the forces of that is an evil that coming your way and it traps and snares that's it and set up and you don't even know the reinforcement that got about to put on you because this coming we gonna be

like a real soldier ma'am I'll not not not put the peeling potatoes in him Bakunin but going on the battlefield hallelujah isn't it strange that God wants the people to have patented when to use look upon the harvest he said harvest is right the laborers are few you pray the lord of the harvest that was him you pray to me that I will send laborers into my harvest it is some part you have to do this thing about prayer is not just saying prayers is to connect the preen in such a way that you have a prayer life a prayer life is different from prayers or seeing prayers let me see it again a prayer life is different from seeing prayer a prayer life is a life of prayer you don't eat breakfast once a week so how are you pretty once a week the living with breakfast lunch and dinner he may ease up on the breakfast if add any lunch that can make up for the back for such a mess and the lunch is like your crush their muddy dinner you see them real hard so what I'm saying is this if the Muslim could pray three times are there four times a day you are Christian on math algebra or if you're missing in the morning you had a crush up during the day whether you have to go to work back to

minister there do not kind of wrong take nobody's saying nothing nobody repentant no sincerity and God shall hit your face I hate your new moon heated this your Sabbath I recognize it because there's no sincerity because to really offer up sacrifice you're supposed to lay hands upon the lamb and that land represented you that is supposed to die you resting your hands on the lamb before he died so you know it's alive so when the priests cut the neck of the Lamb and the bloodsucker spits out and you'll feel the life leaving the lamb the way that supposed to be you you get identified blood is on you you know that supposed to be you you supposed to die but the lamb is in your stead the lamb taken your place giving you an opportunity to be free it was something our sacred it was something that

but if I'm talking about the beasts and any time the devil put up our white horse red horse dealers cores release a power also to come back to the enemy so when God so the first Antichrist was riding with a teaching was teaching his writing with the God sent the teaching of the word the Lion of the tribe of Judah which is the word made manifest by the Holy Spirit that is what God news to compact what the devil had to offer he lose what the word made manifest by the Holy Spirit that was the Lion of Judah oh praise God thank you Jesus in the scripture hallelujah so remember he keeps his

come built from God as the word of God and that is what is taught and preached and that is what inside of you or glory to God so listen I believe that Christ has a church and the church is the field

p.m. make every effort to be here and if you can't be sure to connect to the service on the livestream and this coming Friday we will have a prayer meeting again here at the Tabernacle so we under great expectation for that we had a tremendous time on Friday for those who were here the Holy Ghost was all over their building what a tremendous time we had and Wednesday night was also really really powerful so we Tang God for what he's doing in this season certainly want to take this time to salute all the technical team that's been working behind the scenes summer were here for about 12 hours or sold 1012 hours yesterday doing some work behind the scenes and we have a vision of perfection vision because God wants things done a certain way and as we endeavor along that path of learning and growth and of setting them before growth always comes at the price or the cost of being uncomfortable you have to be prepared for discomfort for you to go away you've not gone before most of us it's comfortable to stay in your comfort zone that's why it's called your comfort zone but if you want anything more than you have now you have to be prepared to be uncomfortable you have to be prepared to do more than you've done before and as we're over we're speaking about Azusa Street see more than the five hours that's that's the sacrifice that doesn't come easy seven hours of praying every day that's that sacrifice that's effort things have to move around to make time to to spend that quality time with God so there's a cost as a price and with everything we do with the musicians with the technical team with the live-streaming with different aspects of it and we certainly tango out for that and we really appreciate we have been getting some tremendous help from our brothers at connects with us assembly so we really appreciate their support and their blessing and better Timmy de Allen but a good show member Acadian and the brothers over there lending of their hearts on their fellowship to be with us to really you know continue to fight for this great body there's only one body friends and by one spirit we are baptized into that one body and when we get over there and be one bribe one body canach it's a man so we love what God is doing and will continue to serve him with our all with our everything with our breath with our lives that our strength with our substance to do all that we can do while we can do it because there'll come a time when we won't be able to do anything there come a time we will have no more church services we become a time we will not be able to gather like this but while we can gather like this wanna put two hundred five hundred seven hundred percent not even a hundred percent you want to put your all into it knowing that you are investing in eternity you are investing in the eternal things that can never pass a week and the church say Amen maintenance team group three please meet with brother Andy Henry after the second service and just a reminder about the fellowship you tree treats Carnival Monday Tuesday that our period there from the Sunday before Carnival actually right there Sunday Monday Tuesday marrow we've already made announcements about it but just to remind you that it is used oriented but all are welcome and we're gonna have a service on Monday night you'll have a service on Tuesday morning we will have some activities some Bible quizzes some different studies those activities for the young people and stuff so we can get closer to God and get closer to one another it's better if it was speaking talked about this this family of God this this family that comes together every Sunday and in the week to grow together to learn together to sharpen iron sharpens iron as the Bible says and to manifest like you said the virtue of this age of forgiveness somebody has to mash your corn so you want to create as many corn mashing opportunities as possible so you can effectively manifest the virtue of the each you know so trials testing situations must come to allow you to forgive and you can't have the opportunity forgive if you lock yourself in a room and nobody ever interacts with you so God created this unique situation for us to come together and bring our different personalities and backgrounds under the headship of the Holy Spirit and under that headship that headship is the benchmark for measuring how we grow and how we mature until we all come into the unity of their feet until we all come into the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ can the church say Amen hallelujah so we would also like to encourage you if you are participating in this special retreat for your people we like very much if you can start to make your contributions from the D to the sisters below to downstairs one hundred and fifty dollars as a contribution towards this by no means is this contribution or all-inclusive cost is really a contribution it really will cost more than this to be able to put this together so beyond this course we certainly want to appreciate those who would contribute food items and their leo and their time and their substance to ensure that this is a success and there for some reason you have not put your name down just yet please do so we really want to you know spend this quality time strengthening one another as we approach the coming of the Lord so may the Lord richly bless you looking for some great continuation of what God has planned for us so stay on fire stay prayed up make that effort to do all that God said to do amen Lord I want
