bless you may have a [Music] seat Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah [Music] yes you know God loves to be worshiped God loves to be worshiped you need have other gods but Isaac uh last Sunday spoke about the Battle of altars sacrifices and trees amen and that is what is happening right here right now we come Jesus told the one well woman we know what we worship we know who we worship for salvations of the Jews and when you come to church you have to come to show you know who you're worshiping some Churches they worshiping Devils there's all kind of contrary Spirits behind the scenes but Jesus said we know what we worship we worshiping the Living God the one who wake us up this morning the one who Quicken us today the one who kept us alive and through all what we have been through we are still alive to give him praise we confess he's the Living God we confess he's not dead this morning he's alive this morning he's alive to confirm his word he's allive to vindicate his word that's the God we serve this morning oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah Bible speaks about men going to be hey and high minded lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God they have their own Gods I used to call it the god of their own imagination the god of their mind the god of their thinking they have their own God as an idol they could worship a car as a god a house as a god a woman as a god a husband as a God your children as a god money as a god anything you can make a god once you have that how they call it inordinate affection for things giving giving things more attention than God deserves and he deserves all the glory all the honor 70 years is short thing three 10 is a short thing you know because thousand years is just one day so that 70 years and that 100 years or 90 years a little flash a little FL just a little light come on just we we passing like little flashes in God's sight just born and you out what God see know lights flash out flash out oh praise God so it's good to be here this morning amen and I want to I know brother is said it I want to really appreciate you and your support for the convention it was a tremendous time and uh I was so happy to see how all these different Brothers uh came with what's upon on their heart and they were able to freely share it uh to the people of God and God did Bless but a common underline team there was the Holy Ghost I was so tremendously blessed uh last Sunday brother Isaac's message I think is one of the greatest messages I've heard him preach the battle of the altars priests and sacrifices nobody could break that nobody could break that but that's is what Elijah said you know let the god that answer by fire let him be God you have your God show off with your God show the power of your God and we will show the power of our God sacrifice versus sacrifice altar versus altar priest versus priest because you cannot go to the altar unless you are priest so for them to offer they have to be priests Oh Glory to God all the Hollywood people they have priests I was listening to testimony war in Africa she was in Nollywood or whatever they call the African Nigerian ollywood and they wanted to offer a sacrifice and she says the more unclean she live the more men she go and sleep with the more doors open for her so they're pulling it into this sexual depravity in order for God for for for the for doors to open and when her final break came she went through all kind of stuff they wanted to sacrifice her and she said that God come and delivered her because they say after the sacrifice her her record or the movie going be a big hit because have got to ser and that God want offering that offering is blood do you understand what I'm saying and when Jesus had to pay the price he had to offer blood this one man offer up his own blood as a sacrifice once for our Redemption who is worthy to take the book you can't take the book without a price it was a blood price that was required and no man could pay that price but the lamb was found worthy and he died that's why he have a right to judge this world because he died himself to pay a penalty to give you an opportunity to come with your foolishness and your nonsense not to be a church member oh give the Lord a shout that's why he going to be angry that's why he going to be vengeful that's why his rra going to be heavy Oh Glory to God because he came down he became flesh he paid a price you was going to hell when he paid that price how dare you not worship him oh give the Lord how dare you not give him praise how dare you not honor him yes buy whether you feel like it or not whe you feeling sick or not where you feeling good or not this morning it doesn't matter he's still worthy he is still God with all your problems he is still God oh give the Lord I shout weeping may enjoy for a night but joy comes in the morning glory to God hallelujah there's got to be a breakthrough for the Sons and Daughters of the Living God hallelujah hallelujah Glory Glory Glory Glory I feel the fire in the building this morning you may be [Applause] seated we not afraid of this this is what we born for not dead church not dead worship not dead praise glory to God hallelujah praise God Jesus told a bunch of them in the message in that day in vain do you worship me Teach it for doctrines the Commandments of men right Doctrine is supposed to bring right worship oh give the Lord a shout right doctr can make a dead church that's a lie that's a lie right Doctrine have to bring the right kind of worship he said the hour come and always when the true worshippers going to worship the father that worships some man worship the father in spirit and in truth in Dynamics and mechanics in word and spirit glory to God press and play not giving you this you can press how much you press press and play not giving you this oh the Lord I shout in the house maybe seated Hallelujah this was such an important message Lord because in the Garden of Eden God put cherubim to guard the Tree of Life to guard the altar even approaching God they are gods and the prophet said he put Gods so not no scallywag could partake of the anointing and come back no scallywag you got to be IFI to get inside a de that might to be received it have the burners not the washers you know the burners fire you don't hear that message you talk and talk and Mysteries and Mysteries and Revelations and Ukraine and Russia and all kind of simmi and and Illuminati and all kind of talk long long talk three four hours of talk but where's the fire sh out fire it have that you know water was the noest day you know it's fire next time Fire coming to burn the Earth burn the Earth but before behold I send you Elijah before the great and Oh Glory to God he promises an Elijah glory to God to get us a way out because I want to show you today there's no way out except this message of the hour that God releasing this out there's no way out I can't see any way out you know long time you know see movies man copy passport have a could print passport and print this and print that you long time thing you escape and you escaping movies they not real I say remember was a convention in Nigeria had a fire one side building about four five stories up and I was studying it to take a bed and diet and go down and whatnot and like that and after was down the corridor smoke it could hardly see and whatnot a man tried to run through a glass I he watching too much of movies Hur pies got bust everything went well but this here but must in here now notice these chabin that John saw here must have been interested in keeping the tree of life so they must be interested in human beings so watch they kept the Tree of Life guarded it the way of life the way of life he said I am the way I am the bread come out of heaven now at I want to show you now and make this sure it's an altar right and this must have been an altar at the Garden of Eden let me stop right here so the Western World don't know much about altars the Africans know because the Africans had the wit doctor and the priest back there they know about offering altar all kind of demonic thing but they they know about altars but the Western World don't know about the altars the Catholic priest know about that though cuz the same the Catholic priest is priting they sacrifice see SL [Music] Al they do the things so and they hold up the business all that the ceremonies oh hallelujah praise when you come to church don't come to church like if is a Catholic Church is a Catholic Church up up of a Catholic Church go that one this is not that no this is a place to worship there's a place where you want to get [Applause] right I told someone yesterday I said drawing a line because we're not forcing and begging anybody inside of here have an exit you don't like it it have exit just walk straight out and don't look back remember twice just keep walking straight out amen amen amen just keep walking just keep walking Hallelujah we are saying when you come here you come here for the word yeah come here to teach the pastor yeah come here with no touch like to show us no light you come here because you want to hear from God about your life you a come here to blame anybody you come here to own up to you stop blaming yeah liar blaming you're immature blaming you're not coming for that you're coming to grow in God to get mature in God you're coming to get Christian maturity not your foolishness and IR message because a long dress we have nothing to do with that we'll throw you out with your long dress oh give the Lord I shout in the house the pastor is in the house in this morning oh [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah I 66 going on I old right they call me a senior and I have low tolerance for foolish watch this must be an altar at the Garden of Eden yes sir do you remember both can and Abel came up to worship oh they came up at the altar to worship that's right watch so that shows that God's altar was moved and set here at the Garden of Eden and the only way back to Eden is by the altar here you are again back to Eden through the alt and they were to keep the way to get it and they couldn't get back there until this altar was covered with blood oh God can people see it nothing but the blood there has to be an atonement a mercy seat this altar of judgment must become a mercy seat and when this altar its blood is lifted then distance judgment so all this I know it was the blood Amazing Grace all that swe the song and so on that's as long as blood is on the altar but once that blood is removed judgment and now I understand and more getting to understand more and more the justice of [Music] God God is Not fear I see people who killed a long time ago 30 years and so on they finding DNA and you know Finding who the person is and arresting them some man run from the law rape somebody kill somebody and 30 years ago living a new life different life and still catch him how you think is catching people you think God sleeping murder nobody see nobody nobody but God sees God sees your heart you can't hide from God oh yes you could hide from the pastor but you can hide from god let's all stand if we want to go in the scriptures 1 Corinthians 10 want to read V 11 Romans chapter 15 I want to read 4 to 7 I so blessed on Wednesday night with brother Anthony examples and to use one scripture and you will realize I'm reading the same scripture this morning the whole from 1 to 11 but it was right out of what I have in my heart so when I I said where you going I said what you preaching he say examples and he give me the script say wow that is something anyhow 1 Corinthians 10:1 moreover Brethren I would not that ye should be ignorant how that our fathers were under the cloud all passed through the sea and were all baptized into the Moses in the cloud in the sea same message same book same tapes all did eat the same spiritual meat all drink the same spiritual drink they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them that rock was Christ and many of them God was not well pleased though they any message for they were overthrown in the wilderness and these things were our examples to the intent we should not lost after evil things as they lusted need to be Idols as was some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink they had fast food in them times they can talky whatever it and Rose up to play neither let us commit fornication of some of them committed and fell in one day 3 and 20,000 neither let us temp Christ are some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents neither murmur ye some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the Destroyer now this the verse we want to get to these things happen unto them for examples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come Romans 15 want read from verse 4 this is a beautiful scripture Romans 1544 for whatsoever things were written a time were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope now the god of patience and consolation Grant you to be likeminded one towards another right according to Christ Jesus that he may with one mind and one mouth glorify God even the father father of our Lord Jesus Christ wherefore receiveing one another as Christ also receive us to the glory of God let's pray father we thank you for your word interpreted father God and may you Minister and meet every need here this morning in Jesus name I ask it I'm waiting upon you may your spirit drop down in a special way in Jesus name I ask it amen you may be seated praise God hallelujah this same scripture Romans 15:4 in the Amplified it says for whatever was thus written in former days was written for our instruction that by our steadfast and patient endurance and encouragement drawn from the scriptures we might hold fast to and cherish hope now may the God who gives the power of patient endurance and that is steadfastness and who supplies encouragement so you could see this is the context of you going through stuff and the word is addressing it and saying the God who gives the power of patient endurance and who supplies encouragement Grant you to live in such a mutual Harmony and such full sympathy with one another Amen in accord with Christ Jesus that together you you may unanimously with United hearts and one voice praise and glorify the God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ the Messiah welcome and receive to your hearts one another then listen even as Christ has welcome and receive you for the glory of God so this scripture alone should eliminate a lot of bad attitude and bad spirited people because if Christ receive you receive others it come like as God forgive you forgive us as we forgive those and if God forgive you how come you're bringing up what others have done to you have you dropped it or you you're mining it you're keeping it you're warming it up then you know what I mean you have light the food container you have a little mini light a little pilot light and you're warming up the O you keep the O warm you getting cold at all you know so easily speakable okay here we go good to see B praise the Lord have a title this morning a reminder a warning we are at the end time yes this is what I have upon my heart this morning a reminder a warning we are at the end time the Bible speaks about admonition it's a warning it's a warning to avoid aberant Behavior it is used three times in the New Testament Paul give us the example about Israel being punished for disobeying God it were written for our instructions so we do have to be stupid like I told someone we you could correct ignorance with knowledge somebody don't know you could correct ignorance with knowledge but you can't correct stupidity that's that's a tough one you can't commit you can't you can't correct stupidity if you're acting like an idiot you can't correct that you have to come into some kind of understanding and knowledge and wisdom ignorance knowledge could address that because you don't know and then you come that you may know or that you might learn and that's why Jesus said learn of me so you come that your ignorance could be correct that you could get a knowledge of God the promise is that we will come from partial realization into full realization that you will know as you are known because God know you a certain way like I keep talking to my wife about and looking backwards looking back and see how things unfold over the years and the journey of life doesn't allow you to see everything but what it gives you is the power of choice and depending upon what you ch CH the thinking your attitude your mindset you see the fruit down the road this didn't drop down from the sky we didn't just arrive here was a journey to get to this spot and if we get into Rapture preparedness it has to be a journey also note note Israel was in bondage just like we were in sin and in bondage but God sent a deliverer to bring them out now the out is not just out it's the out to put you in amen the message come and catch us in Baptist Methodist Catholic World whatever it is to get us out but it's not just to pull you out it's to get you in God don't want to take you out he want to take you out and get you in to the place he want you to come which is the promised land or the land of promises or give the Lord a shout in the house in the natural they came out of Egypt to go into Canaan land in the spirit spiritual we coming into this land of promise where there is Faith and virtue and knowledge and Temperance and patience and godliness wherever you put your foot that is yours oh give the Lord a shout if you want to stay baby and have bottle and pacifier and Pampers and whatnot they can stay at Faith but if you want to grow in God you have to go to Virtue and knowledge and Temperance and patience and get like a man oh give the Lord a shout you can't stay in child form whenever the child speak like a child that's what children supposed to act like talk like live like but when I became a man what do you do what do you do you put away talish and give the Lord a shout in the house of God want to pull us into maturity into manhood amen so this word that identifies admition I wouldn't go into thing of it but it has a word that carries the meaning of discipline admonition and discipline and instruction to train and to undergo discipline literally to train for physical exercise but use figuratively or spiritual and mental exercises and therefore mean to train or undergo discipline now we are not born discipline if you leave human beings they just do what they feel and what they like that's right not what needs to be done this is a church we have different areas different sections different things have to be dealt with and if everybody say well just do what you want to do everybody might line up in a particular place maybe Under the Tent picking up leaves or something like that but there are other things to be done and God have a plan and program that's why you have Pastor Prophet teaching evangelist that why he have different gifts tongu speaking in tongues healing and in other words the body functions the same way we have nose eyes mouth and whatnot if your whole body was an eye it looks terrible you understand ey behind ey in front you're looking like horrible and you're looking so you're seeing everything behind and you see so what I'm saying is God temper the body a certain way that the hand is functional the nose is functional the teeth The Taste and everything else is functional and that is how the body of Christ supposed to be Hallelujah God tap it that way so the hand feel I Ain feeling to be handed not feeling let to be the foot the hand on your own you I'm saying then everything is in order and this is what God wants to get us to I'm going to show you something my God amen so you have to get how the prophet say fitted into the headstone to be fitted in you have to be cut or honed or shaped or formed to be placed inside of there everybody who want to do their own thing they on their own because there's a vision when when people climbing up they start to slip off and slide off so you are to be able to want to take the pressure to go all the way because if you think this is pressure more pressure coming I think this summer was the hardest summer ever the hottest summer ever in America that temperatur over I think 35 degrees terrible for days things are heating up not just climate change thing and what not you talking about around the world and God is heating things up he doing the heating up too oh praise the name of the Lord because judgment is next so this thing here is for admission and admonition upon whom the end of the world is come so then if we coming on to the end and I know that may not resonate with a lot of people because the Bible said people say where the sign of his coming talk come in come in come in come in watch number one Malachi 4 Elias is already come Daniel was told go thy way seal the book until the time of the end the book is now unsealed the in other words the coming of the Lord is nearer than when we first believe so the bride have received this prophetic Spirit spoken word message into our heart yes sir the ministers who Faithfully take the word and bring the promises from the message is they are the ones who God used to get the seed into the bride amen this whole thing about the word is in the bride that could only come by the promises that is promised to you and I coming from behind the pulpit and coming to you that's why you supposed to know your promises not know the pastor know the promises not know the church know the promises because the pastor dead you you messed up but if you know the promises you know he just part and was used to the capacity and he's finished now and press on as normal glory to God so God don't want you titer a man any man God want you to titer him so the fold Ministry is a channel to reconcile men back to God not men back to them Ministry or men back to church men back to God so at the end of the day God must be the theme and the central point of our worship of our attention of our focus it must be him because he is promised to be among us him moving in and out and then we are worshiping the living Christ Oh Glory Glory to God do we give the Lord a shout in the house this has nothing to do with what the message has this have to do with what is prophesied and then we are worshiping the living Christ he could move in this morning he could move in and deliver you this morning he can move in can heal you this morning him moving in and out praise God praise God praise God so just as Lucifer in his panoramic screen offer Jesus all the kingdom of this world God sent a prophet to bring a prophetic vision and to give us a panoramic screen brother kangali that we could see the program of God oh glory to God we can see where it starts and where it's finishing and where the bright supposed to be in this very hour that's what he brought Revelation 19:10 and this is where we have the authority this morning to speak the way we speak 19:10 says and I fell at his feet to worship Him He said unto me see thou do it not I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy so we were supposed to connect with that testimony of Jesus Spirit of Prophecy 1910 and Revelation 228 says and I John saw these things and heard them when I heard and seen I fell not to worship before the feet of the Angel which show me these things then said he unto me see thou do it not I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren the prophets and said un and of them which keep the scenes of this book worship God he said unto me here we go seal not the sins of the prophecy of this booken for the time is at hand I don't have the ministry to explain why brother BR went to son and he went on this house and he walked on that road and go give my sign that's not my calling somebody else will do that my calling is to find these promises and preach it to you but Bram had a was a normal man he have a story he has testimonies he has meetings and everything else but outside of his natural life and story which Full of experiences and Supernatural he had a message amen God tell him your message will forun my second coming Hall so we could deal with the filler material around the message or we could deal with the message itself so we try to zero in on what matters most or say it this way to let the main thing be the main thing oh give the Lord I shout in the house no thrills just getting to the meat of it or the Lord I shout so seal not what the sayings of the prophecy of the book Revelation 10 8-11 and the voice which I he from Heaven speak to me again said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel it did not say go to jonville it did not say go to a man in Trinidad or any man anywhere in the world it says go to the angel and said and take the little book with Open Hand of the Angel and when I went unto the angel verse 9 and said give me the little book he said unto me take it eat it up it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up it was in my mouth sweet as honey as soon as I eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me here we go thou must prophesy again before many peoples Nations and tongues and Kings so I shown you by the scriptures the anointing of the testimony of Jesus which is the spirit of Prophecy supposed to be in the church to prophesy according to rans 108 11 to prophesy according to Revelation 228 according to Revelation 19 that is the authority that we have to prophesy of The Nearness of the coming of the Lord but BR for Masterpiece what did he say in Revelation 10 that would take place why the trip to Tucson to open to the church in the days of the Seven Angels m message the whole word of God would be made manifest the seal that was all the stock had left off why all about it will be made manifest at this time is that what the word said congregation say Amen then we see it then where are we at where are we at there's only one thing the Harvest is here she is dead ripe she is ready now for the coming so that word is a word of Prophecy yes sir she's dead R she's ready for the coming let's go at the Harvest Time the seed is back to its original condition why did he say that because the original seed that fell in the Pentecost when it fell it went through processes like a corn seed you take a corn seed and you bury it into the ground it go through processes when you plant a corn seed you don't see corn seed spitting up like it's popcorn that's on the pack you can get that they just popping and whatnot no when you bury the corn seed it go through a talk it grow it matures it get tall it get a flower it get the all the little silting and whatnot and you come back to the original you understand that so the church ages is really the history of the unfolding of the life of the seed so what we call Seven Church ages is really the unfolding of this tree we talking about and you shout out amen you you are the seed that is prophesied to come at the top of the tree oh give the Lord I shout in the house Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah the Pentecostal was the shock but you are the seed that's why the son of man had to come to you the message had to come to you seed to seed oh the Lord I shout the son of man is the sore of the good seed and you had the potential in you the attribute the thought the gene was in you that's why you couldn't help it you had to respond Oh Glory to God where there's a deep deep calling there got to be a deep to respond glory to God you might be struggling but there's a seed in you you might be dun but there's a seed in you you may be backslid but there's a seed in you the devil didn't put it and the devil can't take it out oh give the Lord a shout the devil didn't put it the devil can't take it out God put that inside of [Music] you so you can understand now how Jesus so confidently said all that the father hath given me shall come not some but all what is Jesus saying all of them have a gen in them oh glory to God in the thought a word of the thought Express hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah

am not Messiah listen she was so excited she got stimulation of Revelation that's what Revelation does it wasn't water it was wine why to stimulate you it wasn't water what church you belong to Jesus I want to remember a pastor she wasn't that foolishness she didn't looking for a pastor she was just stimulated by the revelation of who the Messiah is and she ran she couldn't walk she ran she began to testify that's when something get a hold upon you you a looking for change your dress you're looking to testify of What the Lord Has Done she ran and said come see a man the canal one say oh God

Oh Glory to God was the Holy Ghost it was the Holy Ghost it still is the Holy Ghost something [Applause] Glory Glory you may be seated praise [Applause] God the seed in Harvest Time end time time of the end the seed is back into his original condition what did God have to do you had to send seven angels from eternity to GA all the scattered word to tithe back into the word to bring down the Holy Ghost the object of gathering all the scattered word and tying up the Loose Ends what was missed back there is the object of it is to pull down the Holy Ghost without the Holy Ghost we doomed we allly ghost we are Atomic father waiting for Putin to press the big bums because he going to loose it Hallelujah and Putin team up with China right now B flying in the sky nearby America I know all you reading that by reading it Hallelujah so as I read I'll tell all you judgment is set American Judgment will not cannot be cancelled at the Harvest Time the seed is back to its original condition and must have all the word in order to be the seed I believe Thunders well we leave the Pope in the tribulation period you get some assistance because you must have all the world to be deceived I believe ghost because GH4 hours and be lost yeah let them get that tampy smoke that marijuana and get high on that smoke that ganja and get high on that and and don't ask the question where that baptism was on the Flesh on the spirit or on the soul because Peter didn't talk that talk Peter went into the upper room to get the Holy [Applause] Ghost because Jesus told him you shall receive power when after the Holy Ghost not message books not pressing play after the Holy Ghost come upon you the Holy Ghost still have to come upon you oh give the Lord I shout oh God my God I rocking up here this morning hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Oh [Applause] Glory they had power before they were in Jesus ministry before they cast out Devils before they had operation and Supernatural them before but this was different Jesus hit them the word open the understanding he hit them the word open the word and say don't even preach don't even think about it go get something more more than reading Seven Seals more than reading seven Church ages more than listening to all the tapes more than press and play more than going back and visit the the grave in jville and go around all the all the all these sites and message forget that get power power to pray power to repent power to say forgive me power to say I'm sorry some people have don't know they came that came come in them M liar you're [Applause] Wicked Don't Clap now you're still Wicked if you repent you're Wicked Oh Glory to God God say I don't want nobody to perish I want him come to repentance do you understand the attention of God he wakes up with a humble and contrite heart he wakes interet a repentant Spirit he always [Music] does but you must have all the word in order to be seed you can't have half a seed it won't grow it's got to be the whole seed it's got to not manifest I believe in the B Holy Ghost Hallelujah I believe speak in tongues that is part of the seed but now there is added to that the life he said said to the baptism of the Holy Ghost you have to add something the life that's what the Pentecost didn't have that is why they could be adultery and fornication and live up to now they're still doing it up to now they are still identify with who they are no real conversion no real change notice the life that was in the husk in the stalk in the tassel gathers up in the seed the life was in the stalk one went to make the other justification went to make sanctification sanctification away from the B Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in Perfection up to now I a see no man from train yet I don't know if my glasses need attention I don't know if I need adjustment or something so I need need some adjustment up to now I a see no man from jville there you I see the B was made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come down right down in Perfection and back to the word again what for to manifest itself so this back to the word is not to say well yeah I have PL Revelations you to come here to hear it that's a lie is back to the word to manifest itself shout out manifest itself so again manifest itself manifest itself the word has to manifest itself oh my one time the prophet said I think it was he says the the sick is healed the dead is rais a BL because the word is in the church in the person so that that that Vindication is evidence the person is back in the church Hallelujah who who person the person of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah Daniel 128 and9 said I heard I understood not then I said oh my Lord what shall be the end of these things he said go that way for the book which are closed up and sealed till the time of the end so you understand when brother brandham came he came at the time of the end so we belong to at the end time people yes sir that means somewhere it going to be a closing everybody wouldn't be big know they got babies they got toddlers they got children they go adults have old people have sick people rich people poor people everybody go be it but they will see the whole drama and the whole closing and this is what this message is about yes sir to remind you and to warn you that we are in the end times I know you're planning for your house and you're planning for your next car and you're planning for this and planning for that I know no problem keep planning because we planning too but be conscious that any day now something different will happen but Bram says notice for the End of Time message he's talking to seven seal this seal he revealed all the six seals but they don't say nothing about the seventh but the end time seal yes sir when it starts it will be a secret not when it finish when it starts right it will be absolutely total secret according to the Bible but remember Revelation 10 1-7 at the end of the seven Angel's message all the mysteries of God would be known we are at the end time the opening of the seventh seal so the open of the seventh seal identify that we are actually at the end now because we are in time and we counting months years dates and so on and hours and seconds we don't understand God's timing because from 1960 to now it's like a blink God are not hor with the time you we have hor because we see we getting old and gray and dying and whatnot but God they getting old and GRE and dying he have a clock what is a number of perfection we all know that tree is God's number in numerology God is known by his numbers Tre is perfection seven is worship 20 for his worship 40 is Temptation 50 is Pentecost Jubilee all of his numbers his numerals of God is perfected is imp Perfection tree is perfection now the little baby Jesus was born three stars went together one was the morning star that reflected the coming of the infant Christ a perfect one now what happened we see a roar in the paper across television across the Nations we five stars this is 1962 and time sign seed he said when five stars just fell in line with the world what is five Grace every time those stars come something happen on the earth now watch what it says Germany almost wash off the map some of the ma said the world would burst like a watermelon every distressful thing prophesied by them in the last days he said what it is California like to wash into the ocean what is it the beginning of Sorrows earthquakes has picked up everywhere five stars come in Grace God's grace what happened 1962 listen to these words an infant Church Hallelujah a bride infancy that the power of God has begin to fall on her she is taking form a bride for this bridegroom so the five stars lineup 1962 identify a bride seed bride taken form oh Hallelujah we are in 2024 oh blessed be the name of the Lord what is happening I might say this friends the church is coming forth God prophecy is going to have a church without spot a wrinkle and she is predestinated God said so he would have it that makes it right who's a member I don't know I am trusting to be myself you see that humility I'm the I the bride when you see me you see the father a Calypso where they going with that that kind of Trinity I I jesus so is that what kind of foolishness is that everything I going through is the Lord is the Lord liar God told me and God told me God didn't speak to you yet God tell theming some Spirit talking to them enticing Spirit lying to them and God show me and these false prophets and and internet they always say you know it came to me that the Lord was telling me the Lord has talk so you hear Isaiah talk like that it was coming to me and know you think you mean a no Prophet talk like that these Jokers and them and people reading the Bible and want just listen to these nonsense we have a message that we don't have to experiment with I feeling me it so and we twist it so I you a mechanic yeah span on spanning you're breaking n in the prophet message you revealing Revelation and next minute is your own message own message you know have nothing do Prophet say because he say say what the tape say because God speaking through him I can be more God than than God in him God speaks through the prophets and if I speak what the prophet speak is speaking what God say then the prophet's voice is on my lip then his words are on my tongue and God know what he speak to that prophet and God know what we are saying this morning and God will honor his word one thing I'm convinced of he will honor his word because God is not a man that would lie God would shame the critics he would shame the Liars he will embarrass them in his time let them grow let them carry on let them let them do what they want to do your time coming oh give the Lord some some Praises hallelujah hallelujah I believe that these Latter-Day signs and things that's happening every one of them is peeling together to show that Christ is ready to come for his bride as God in his word made manifest in a man a perfect man so is God and His word coming again and making himself manifest in a bride not will do like Eve did I breed it but the unadulterated born word of God will be born into that church amen amen the same Sun that shines there in the East the same sh sign that shine there with his same power upon Pentecost is to ripen the seed that he planted so look at the layers you have to get the word scattered to get the seed and then when you get to the seed you're hearing now that the seed have to be ripen because people get seed want to have seed W manifestation is the seed right the seed in nature turn from green to Brown you can't plant a green corn seed when you have green corn we call that we boil it Hall when it cor harder you roast it if you had to plant it and I used to plant corn I love planting corn and peas you used to hang it up until the whole thing get dry because that that that corn is what you're using to plant for the next crop God had to ripen and get the greenness out of us when you're green you're sappy and only the sun shout out son that son is Trials and Tes and tribulation no shout out now you see son you say son but then when I convert the son to what the son really is shout out right right it takes to righten [Applause] so your trial should have you Hallelujah Glory but your trial is [Applause] this and you know what God doing God watching you and Bing hallah it takes these test to dry you and ripen you and if your egg come to the test you have to [Applause] repeat you have to repeat the exam [Applause] thenu one timeall Peter disciples come Lord Lord I have a question for you if a brother s against me Lord how much time a day I supposed to for seven times a day he put out a number all right Peter they put out a number my brother trouble hey hallu how much time I should forgive them they come and say seven times number there a number you know 70 Bible you know a number Jesus said 70 * 7 and and he say a day [Applause] H yeah I did no you we say that we laugh but could we do that so how come after before the day done you're Hing because you're H you're Vex you're so Vex you call somebody and tell them about it you break the rules right there if your brother and friend you go to him you add you add a third party [Applause] now you add a witness against your ODS you have a witness then that you have not forgiven because you called somebody you what you know he do remember he's say and she's say and what not when Jesus hit them that bomb 70 * 7 take that in your pipe and smoke it 70 Time s we don't smoke it go go and look for pipe now the p take pipe and smoke it and make it shock of all my grounds Brother people could take whatever and go with it next me you still they smoking and Grandy I know people smoking message it's spiritual ganja they high on the pastor the high on the church they high on the Revelation they high on God man I tell you Donald Trump get in the ears I know what that is about he had a big big p and in the convention s them patch to them going in sympathy they paint a picture of Jesus with they worshiping you know that man is a God to them Christian you know soal they worshiping they have a altar somebody have a big Jersey Trum and Jesus have my back when go take a with Trump yeah I wonder if Jesus had back but Brown remember we have shown clearly All Through the Ages even as Adam and Eve fell because they left the word so the Ephesians age fell by turning slightly from from the word until you see that how he use that terminology slightly not no big you know when he get somebody off now you might bother with that little but when you walk at 10 miles with that instead of going so you're going show and people traveling message years off and they don't want to admit that they have been deceived and the years off watch this we have the final reputation of the word by the World Church system the loudest and age ends in a blackout of the word thereby causing a departure of the Lord from the midst so off the word means god pull his hands off because he and his word is one you have the word you have the spirit the spirit follows the word if the word being preached the spirit is present because the spirit is looking over his word if the person go off the word Spirit walk away because that is what the ni uh Nan counsel and so on because they break the word and went off the word there was no conduit for the spirit to come so the Bible talk about the at the river Euphrates the holy was bound for almost 2,000 years Bound by Crees and dogmas Crees and dogmas with Crees and dogmas the spirit can't work so the spirit is trapped the spirit is not operative with creas interpretation and dogmas intellectual information and all kind of explanation that was going forward but the spirit itself could move he said the evening time message is to lose the Holy Ghost that's what the message come to do to lose the Holy Ghost not to put the holy gohost in the background and a Trinidadian coming in front that know we end message for or some flesh and blood in front the end time mess is to lose the Holy Ghost words the enti mess is to kill men kill flesh Hallelujah and God come forward and the man go backward Jesus said it this way John said this way he must increase and I must decrease the Holy Ghost must increase and we must decrease Dynamics must increase oh give the Lord some [Applause] Praises but this lisian age ends in a blackout of the word sir thereby causing a departure of the Lord from the midst he stands outside calling to his own who follow him by obedience to the word this's the part I want to get to after a short and Powerful demonstration of the spirit this little haunted and persecuted group will go to be with Jesus 30% say amen that's okay because in this have hunted and persecuted hallu if you don't want this you could have a choice it have a you could flip now to the tribulation where you'll be killed is that fair Choice let me say again after after a short and Powerful demonstration of the spirit this little hunted and persecuted group will go to be with Jesus I want to go to Matthew 24 I pick up something here that there something else Jesus went out verse one departed from the temple the disciples came to him and showed him the buildings of the temple Jesus said unto them see ye not all these things very like unto you they shall not be left here one stone one on another that shall not be thrown down and as he sat on the Mount of Olives the disciples came at him privately saying tell us when shall these things be one two what shall be sign of th come in tree and of the end of the world three things that was asked Jesus answered and then them first thing Jesus talk about take heed that no man deceive you watch them dogs watch them men for men many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall receive many many and many he shall hear of war and of War see that be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet then Jesus go down deeper Nation shall rise against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom there shall be famines pestilences earthquakes and diverse places all these things are the beginning of Sorrows but then this is interesting if this is sequential look what next then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you you shall be hated of All Nation for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another I I know where the p number 26 I no longer believe I could tell you where brother so and so living and this was and get you want your phone number this is real you knowbody that dream people was burning the spoken books you try to burn it faster like Peter Peter said not not me when Peter see Jesus getting licks Jesus you know the next parallel scripture with it says God said I will give you a mouth to speak when they question you and talk to you I have something a statement I have at the very end of this message because I cannot see any escape from the system that about to be set up that you can't buy or sell unless you take the mark of the beast I can't see any way of Escape in terms of you're ducking you're hiding yeah when your name know and I have it written the devil set up social media that's right social media without your control know all your contacts know all your family and friends potential friends and Associates it is built like that it looks good everything else you could connect this one and this one saying and they always tell you uh your friend they make the I don't know what mag magician they have behind there but they always get not your family and members and sometime the name might be different but they put all the connection whe it's artificial intelligence whatever you use inside you might know this's one you might and all the time he show you might you know yeah want to talk to them you know them I don't to nobody I have no friends on Facebook sorry I have I I am I do have time for that I said before the devil is not omniscient he doesn't know all things this technology and artificial intelligence system that's about to set up for the whole world gives him the opportunity to access total knowledge he know where your house is if you go to Google Maps and search for his it will Zoom right here you see the tents in front of all they taking that from the sky so if they want to send the pope to the church he know ja where to go when he land in the airport he said take me straight where you going to run where you going to hide America is about to be bummed up America is about to be destroyed for years I've been saying B angly we're not even sure if America Mak tribulation no I don't believe they will but AB Bram saw he call it the annihilation he said America was just bummed up with cratus and smoke that's supposed to be the land of the bra and free everybody want to go there under President Obama the legalize sodomy legalize what they had in the Bible there Sodom and gomorra this is a land that came up and and Bo out a England and and get freedom of religion this is a land that went free and now they binding other people no longer free the whole thing will change you know a dictatorship is about to set up you know because the Bible talk about you can't buy or unless you take the mark you but R say it will be a for sin a for sin and that is why they will close down the churches who knows we might be zooming away when that time come nothing about rapt I don't word connection and zoom we don't know but one of these days they're going to close us down I could see why now why brother we are actually at the end time let's continue and many false prophet shall arise and shall deceive many and because of iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he that shall endure until the end the same shall be saved and strange enough at verse 14 he said this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for us witness I want to tie that in to what bam says after a short display of spirit this haunted persecuted group would go on to be with the Lord so I'm wondering to myself if after all this Nations or nations offended false prophets iniquity you're going to get the gospel being preached it will be you know it has to preach to people who reject it people who was once in it people have to get an opportunity to see God in its power demonstrate and turn down for the one last time oh my let me see how we could you know God provided place of worship notice here we go not only does he come in by the holy spirit with The Learning of his word he manifest that word so he comes in by the Learning of his word yes so when you come to church you come to learn of God amen understand this you know I've said it so much times they come of Egypt God said bring them down to this mountain they don't know this God Moses met this God they don't know his name his shape his form okay pillar fire in Conta with Moses the people come from a mighty hand they see plagues they see frogs and flies they know a power with them a presence with them a prophet with them they follow in when they come to the mountain and Moses went up to seek God they find he staying long they say Aon come we not even sure that man dead you say Aon make us a God the woman come with the earrings and all the gold and whatnot and he melting melting you know he wrong you know he melting under conviction he had heavy heavy but he melting gold and of all the thing they going build is a calf a golden one Egyptian anointing still on them when Moses come down and Moses see re now you see God know they're doing that but God dealing with Moses when Moses come down you saw Ten Commandments and Moses come and he said all who are the Lord said come with me and and he take the Commandments and and throw it down and some of them just disappeared on the earth K and them lost their Barber Shop they lost their um position in Egypt and they come out and they recognize that they can't set up shop again in the wilderness so as far as they concerned any anything come let's go back now I was supervisor I was CEO of the babers association whatever he was running I don't know where he was running let's go back and there are people like that every opportunity they want to go back they want to go back they want to go back they want to back why go back why go back and these disturbance ones because you see when Moses called them out he called out three kind of Believers that what happen in the message right now you know don't message don't talk that talk you know that's some Rascals in the message you there three kinds tell already is one wife I had not this year my wife have a name name isar one all right so he doesn't come in only with the learning of his word he manifests the word now remember the prophets believe the word they received the word of God and God the Holy Spirit came into them I'm still reading and fired yeah gang fire that promise out and made it come to pass so brother Ram came to fire out promises so so when I hit a spoken book I am look in my eyes anointed to see what he what was given to the bride as a promise in the book he may talk plenty stories different kind of things he went here there this happened and that happened fine but what what's the promise in that book Jesus said who can condemn me of sin sin is unbelief whatever God wrote and whatever the prophet said I am the answer and they said he came to his prophet he came as a prophet the son of man that's exactly what he was and what he proved to be why the dyam dyamics was dear to fire off the mechanics he was the mechanics the son himself and the father was the Dynamics so he given an example of what we have to have here the sons here have to become the mechanics and the father become the Dynamics to fire out the sons so now you will see empowered Sons anointed Sons inspired Sons Holy Ghost filled and anointed Sons not above not in front not behind but God in them Fire coming out the mount the word coming out the mount the word is assur coming out the mount hallelujah hallelujah three things happen when the Lord begin to descend shout voice and trumpet what is the shout it's the message going forth first the living bread of life bringing forth the bride so the shout which is the seven Thunders is the living bread so you know what you're feasting on all these years while the minister fighting it you're feasting on living bread the shout hallelujah said it this way and brother stepanus said it I wasn't the one that appeared on on the river I was only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one that performed these things and forell these things that happens as perfect as they are I'm only one that is near when he does it I was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew it was I what I surrendered to myself too he spoke to it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that God unfolded it's not a man it is God the angel was not the son of man he was a messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he is the one you are feeding on you are not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you are feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man could we give the Lord some Praises Church headstone Tabernacle that is what you're feeding on this morning Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah praise God but brandham now this great Pillar of Fire that absolutely identifyed by scientific cameras is here on the Earth today there's the picture of it hanging there then watch The Works of it among us provs the same Jesus that once live in Palestine The Same Spirit was upon him as come up to a body until it come back to headship again which he is coming soon to claim the body amen watch I am not he I am his servant the pillar of fire is not he it is Spirit form which was upon the son of man has come down now to anoint here we go sons of men purpose what's the purpose to bring back a Ministry just exactly like he said it would be what's the purpose of this ministry in order for the head and the rest of the body to connect together and that's why for years I was saying this is to bring back the ministry of Jesus Christ the fivefold ministry will be the ministry of Jesus Christ hallelujah praise God praise God hallelujah all of this bilding now into this a woman will become president I want to read a couple of quotes that brother brandham have have said with us so you can put on this picture praise God want you take a look at this woman that woman I can take it down now now I remember you could take it off now I remember preaching two messages one was the intelligence in which I was talking about I didn't always was had a question about bid and this woman and so like that but I never saw it um you know that he was ready to bring her on really and I was saying that that that that she is a Heartbeat Away from becoming president so now she is the Democratic nominee and she's not the Democratic nominee by the way or the order it's supposed to be by competing and whatnot she's almost handed the throne it's almost like handed to her you see but listen to this but br just remember this I predict this that a woman will be president before we are annihilated amen I said that in a 199 1933 Vision let go quickly that was from God's covenant with Abraham then teaching on Moses woman has become an idol after a while America would be ruled by a woman mark it and see if it is not right a woman will take the place of a president or something some high power in America by fit Moses there the one I read when I spoke about uh um an end the end is come I was talking about uh the self-driving software that they have and there was something that I overlooked and I bned it up here I didn't some of my eyes didn't see it but R talk about the the cars were had a glass top and I drive Tesla car when I go to the states rent and so on and the whole top of it is glass it's not like if it's um what we normally will know and that would they have now watch and this year he said now there are just two things left in one of those prophecies that is for cars to be on the road with remote control looking like an egg you don't have to drive it it controls itself and there will be a great woman rise up because America is a woman nation and a great woman rise up will be president or something like that in the nation and then there will be a total Annihilation the entire nation will be wiped out this is not me saying that this is prophecy from why we are not an nomination he said the cars will keep getting more like a egg it shall come to pass that those cars will not run by steering wheel it will be something other than run them and the new cars I think supposed next two months which will be the robo taxi wouldn't have any pedals wouldn't have any steering wheel there's no need for it because you able to summon the car call with your cell phone and something like that and pun your destination take you to where you're going you pay whatever whatever right so watch in them cars they're bringing out right now remote control for safety and so on then he says there'll be a great powerful woman raised up either be president or dictator or some great powerful woman in United States and she will sink under the influence of women now remember that is thust sayth the Lord this is where he said that thust say the Lord that is thust sayth the Lord another one this from this time so I won't have time in this meeting to tell you in 1933 this is a woman's nation is number 13 appears 13 chapter of Revelation 13 stars 13 stripes 13 everything is 13 everything is woman and remember thus sayth the Lord there will be a woman rule before the end time and this is where I come to remind you that we are at the end don't just live loose live sober live thoughtful live with restraint understanding that the days are evil let's continue thus sayeth the Lord there will be a woman rule before the end time she'll either be president vice president it be Catholic Church as a woman I Seena a great woman the nation bout her it'll be one before the end time thus sayth the Lord write it down and find out you young people see if it happens if it isn't I'm a false prophet conference he said here now they'll have an automobile perfected into a place I seen a family driving an automobile that was glass topped some of I didn't I missed that glass topped and didn't have any strain wheel in it now bear in mind in 1933 around that time was the Ford and that was square and black top and it was one color when you're choosing just one color black for but he saw the glass top they didn't have any steering wheel in it almost done here look at the prophecy the Lord give me 933 how they permit the V to vote in voting they will elect the wrong person seven things was given five of them already happened the next thing was a great woman a church a power or something will take United States to rule then I seen it just like ashes laying there at the end it was the end time what brandham talk about he says there was a man and woman in the car sitting there with their backs turned to one another playing cards and the Machine traveling itself something on the bumpers that it couldn't hit the others going down he talk about radar but we know his sensors they have so it was breaks it break itself that it wouldn't hit the next car I think the last one we have you know from the center beak of Daniel and then after that I turned and looked and I saw this United States burning like a smolder rocks had been blown up it was burning a heap of fire in logs or something just set it a fire looked as far as I could see she had been blown up and then the vision left me five out of the three has happened five out of the seven has happened oh praise the name of the Lord so this is to challenge you and to warn you to think again what time you putting with the Lord what time you putting in prayer we need the Holy Ghost to get out of here we need Dynamics to get out of here he said the power of the Holy Ghost is what will put the people in The Bride to be the bride is not to be in the message to be in the bride is not to be under the best pastor or the or the most revelated man that not to be in the bride to be in the bride the power of God have to put you inside of day so I trust this stir you to hunger and thirst after righteousness that God could fill you that you could recognize that you don't have to fulfill all your dreams all your dreams don't have to come what you think and supposed to be because any day now going to break out and I feel like Russia and Ukraine just like a holding me Russia being held back by Ukraine Russia Russia could drop a bomb in UK and all this thing and no time at all in know but yet it continues on this week Israel went and take out some leader some some some fighter hammmer or something like that leader in Teran in Iran yeah I mean that's that's that's very brave but right them people crying they blood going to flow in Israel things are heating up and even though you may think it doesn't affect you it will eventually it will affect the entire world because Jerusalem will become a burdensome Stone oh praise the name of the Lord praise God let's see if you could try to wrap up here what the time is going I wasn't looking at time now the coming of the Lord Jesus is so close at hand so it's two things running in here now the natural vision that you could see and the spiritual part that you need to understand we supposed to have as I say long time you know you could copy passport copy identity and all kind of that you could hardly do that right now everything is digital you have to put up your identity in other words privacy is dead because you can't be private in the Beast system Every Man Poor Bor Rich free all take the mark of the beast exit what kind of people we going to be for this to face this end time end time demands end time Spirit end time condition you know we have to get in the spirit to deal with the end time condition you can't do like if you're in Sodom you know I like to dramatize it you so so what something Abraham interceding on behalf of lot lot s lot a good time he's me he a post but he he fed up he's sick of what he see Angel dispatched to get lot and his family out lot wife know that is Angelic being lot wife know it's supernatural just come out just come out and just keep walking don't look back don't look back but you see your heart if your heart not right if your heart corrupt if your heart you know like how Jesus said there's nothing in me that the devil there's nothing in me the devil could pull so we have to be purged enough that there is nothing there's no strings there you could pull there's no desire there that you could pull that's how much you want to be like Jesus that's how much you want to be close to God I do have to see that I can't see that God have to see that inside of you there's nothing there to pull you no world no man no money no nothing you love God you want to serve God you want to make it glory to God glory to God you want to make it youth is not an asset in this time I say mothers and so wicked they to leave the child own life andad of nonsense give them have a control have remote on each child life and they send each child Straight to Hell instead of fighting for the soul of the child to serve the Lord let the Child live life or what in church and church and church is God you're talking about not church it's to serve the Lord I get the call of God AG 17 I wish it was 12 I wish it was 10 I wish it was 8 I wish it was N9 you have to be concerned because the children can't going on your testimony I don't care how strong you as a Christian your children your children to face the music themselves once they underage you could pray for them and believe God for them and seek God for them because you want them to make it too they are your loved ones oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah glory to God thank you Lord Jesus so brother brand I'm talk about notice the coming of the Lord Jesus so close at hand until what this is the operation the spiritual side now until the spirit from way down here B justification sanctification baptism of Holy Spirit now right into the time of the coming of The Headstone the church has got to be so perfectly like Christ what have to do with the message that you seeing around the message the church has to be perfectly like who Christ like who Christ shout it out like who Christ like Christ until Christ and the church can unite together the same spirit that is what we fighting for not you and your wretched Behavior Oh Glory not you and your wickedness yes but you fighting to bring Christ back into the church Oh Glory to God let your life make a way for him to come forward glory to God if Christ come into your life you going to respect your husband you would never disrespect your husband because Christ is in your life if Christ come into your life you will love your wife oh give the Lord a praise if Christ come into your life you're going to respect your parents because Christ coming into your life Oh Glory to God that's the word now because he and his word is the same Oh Glory to God because Christ coming into your life Hallelujah not talk Christ and watch and if the spirit of Christ is in you it makes you live the life of Christ act the Life of Christ do the work of Christ he that believeth in me the works that I do shall do also and then he prophesied we got a Ministry coming that's exactly like the Life of Christ oh give the Lord some Praises that is what I've been prophesying about we have a Ministry coming Oh Glory to God that Ministry is on its way oh give the Lord some Praises we have a Ministry coming that's exactly like the Life of Christ what does that Ministry identify the coming of the Lord the shout The Voice the Trump oh praise the name of the Lord glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord so this prophetic vision is what brought the seeds to be swn for the entire bride the rain is not the issue the issue is if you have the seed if the word and the spirit is one why is it that the foolish virgin couldn't make it because the kingdom of God is the word turn power in your life so you have to have the word in you to get the kingdom in you the Holy Spirit talk to the prophet pick up a pen and write the secret is the word is in the bride well that is what has been going into you the word and someday that going to be turned into spirit and you will be empowered what the scripture says in John one as many as receed him to them give to become the sons of God oh give the Lord a shout not receive a book not receive a tape but receive power power to become the sons of God power to become a real daughter of God you're going to receive power leave here with the Consciousness and the faith that power is destined for you power is highing over you oh glor you shall receive power you got to get that power God promised it Hallelujah brother here we go me see where I'm at hallelujah oh we have something pages I think I'm page 12 all right we're going good my stop here a minute I believe that the people here we go are in the preparation of the last great destruction this world will ever know I believe we are the end you can speak to people you can put bigram in every city in the United States they will still drink whiskey smoke cigarettes laugh at you and everything else the same here we go they are in the spirit of the last days so for the last days to be fulfilled the people have to come in the spirit of it and God here we go cannot send destruction before the people are in the spirit for Destruction so you recognize now the people getting in the spirit of it you see like when Carnival come in just's go to the mass band go and singing and Calypso go to fet and what not because they're tuning up for Monday and Tuesday when Monday Tuesday come now they they explode the carnival time then Wednesday do for ashes by the priest until next year notice the end time messenger here we go his

he want to get into fatherhood because that was he he that was his burden to be a father and he had no Sons that's why he bured adamah Hallelujah and set up Eve because he wanted to have children that
