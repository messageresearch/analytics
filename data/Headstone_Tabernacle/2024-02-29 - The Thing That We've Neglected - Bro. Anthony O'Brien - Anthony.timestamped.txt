[0:00] amen and my people have to be delivered
[0:02] am my people have to be set free isn't
[0:06] that right now here's the thing let's
[0:09] come to our context now now God want to
[0:12] deliver the people in order to deliver
[0:15] the people he had to have a man to do it
[0:18] and in order for that man to do God's
[0:20] job that man had to be straightened out
[0:24] that man had to be corrected that man
[0:26] had to be brought into alignment with
[0:29] God's requirement ment that man had to
[0:31] be lining up with God's word Paul said
[0:34] walk worthy of the vocation wherewith
[0:37] you are called there is a vocation there
[0:40] is a call of God upon your life tonight
[0:44] I don't know what it is when Dynamics
[0:47] come he will positionally place you in
[0:50] your vocation and calling by fire but
[0:53] until that come we have to get ourselves
[0:55] in alignment with the word of God and
[0:59] with what God requir Ires for our lives
[1:01] because the only way for us to be used
[1:03] is for us to be broken it's for us to be
[1:06] stripped is for us to come to a debt
[1:09] death of a corner of wheat death to
[1:11] yourself Death to Your attributes de to
[1:14] your flesh de to your ways de to your
[1:17] opinions de to what you want de to how
[1:20] you feel that's why every trial and
[1:24] every test that come your way was to
[1:27] burn the flesh off of you was to burn
[1:30] the desires off of you what to tame you
[1:33] what to groom you to come into obedience
[1:37] oh to the voice of God oh
[1:41] Hallelujah if God spared not his son and
[1:44] every son that cometh to God must be
[1:47] tested must be tried must be persecuted
[1:51] must go through hard things in order to
[1:54] come out the way God wants it in order
[1:57] to be formatted the way God needs you so
[2:00] that if he touch you by your shoulder
[2:02] you could respond and say Here I Am
[2:04] father you can't be going to the shop
[2:06] you can't be going to the bakery when
[2:09] there's people to be
[2:10] delivered you got to be about your
[2:13] father's business isn't that right
[2:17] amen even little Jesus at age 12 said
[2:21] don't you know I'm about my father's
[2:24] business we don't know about Jesus much
[2:27] about Jesus Amen in that 18 years a
[2:30] silence but one thing we do know he was
[2:33] about his father's business not much is
[2:36] wrote of him I don't know he played in
[2:37] the streets I don't know if he went to
[2:39] school maybe he learned carpentry
[2:41] there's not much that's told about him
[2:43] but one thing we do know is that he was
[2:46] about his father's business we know
[2:48] enough to know about Jesus Oh and he was
[2:51] the example seed son and he is the
[2:54] example that we follow tonight so it
[2:56] doesn't matter what you get caught up in
[2:58] in this world Hallelujah but this world
[3:00] is not our home we have jobs we have
[3:02] legitimate things but tonight be about
[3:06] your father's business we're here
[3:08] tonight to see about our father's
[3:10] business we made it our business to come
[3:12] to church tonight we made it our
[3:14] business to come and worship God we made
[3:16] it our business to pray we made it our
[3:19] business to worship we made it our
[3:21] business to see about the things of God
[3:24] oh do you believe that tonight that's
[3:27] wonderful that's wonderful
[3:30] we need more of that the fields are
[3:32] white to harvest but the laborers are
[3:34] few we need more people who are willing
[3:37] to surrender themselves right that's
[3:39] wonderful but now here's the
[3:42] thing maybe there's something that we've
[3:44] neglected to do now Moses firstborn
[3:50] gusan was born in the wilderness isn't
[3:52] that right he's born of of
[3:55] zapor isn't that right and um that's
[3:58] written in Exodus 2 says right
[4:01] here he says uh this when he God married
[4:03] to zor Moses was content to dwell with
[4:05] the man and he gave Moses zor his
[4:07] daughter and verse 22 said she bear him
[4:10] a son and he called his name gersam for
[4:13] he said I have been a Stranger in a
[4:17] Strange landall
[4:19] amen so now
[4:23] uh his name became a testimony of what
[4:26] was going on in Moses's life at that
[4:29] very time
[4:30] is that right strange man in a Strange
[4:33] Land praise God he was learning new
[4:36] things about his
[4:38] people but I'm pretty sure by the from
[4:41] the time he was born to the time that we
[4:44] come down in scripture here where the
[4:46] angel or where where the angel of the
[4:48] Lord speaks to Moses isn't that right
[4:50] where God speaks to Moses out to the
[4:52] burning
[4:53] bush up to this point gersam hasn't been
[4:58] circumcised I don't know how how long
[5:00] this took here between scripture could
[5:02] have been years since this boy was born
[5:06] but there was something that Moses had
[5:08] neglected to
[5:12] do and he found every other thing to do
[5:15] it seemed he was mining jetro's flock he
[5:18] had that to do every
[5:20] morning he had the plans to water he had
[5:22] he he courts the Court's bill to pay he
[5:24] had the mortgage to pay he had the tires
[5:26] to see about he's doing everything else
[5:30] everything else that seemed
[5:33] legitimate isn't that right but it was
[5:35] something he neglected to
[5:37] do something you keep putting off and
[5:41] maybe Zapora his wife probably mentioned
[5:44] it a good few
[5:45] times and you know how man are I'll get
[5:49] it when I have time don't pass to me now
[5:54] I have something more important to
[5:56] do isn't that right I'm guilty of it too
[5:59] too I'm
[6:01] speaking
[6:04] experience you know we always find
[6:06] something more important to
[6:08] do yet fail to see about God's business
[6:12] fail to see about what God wants or
[6:14] requires of us in our lives so this is
[6:17] the thing I this is the reality I wanted
[6:18] to kind of bring tonight what I saw in
[6:21] the scripture here and I know this
[6:22] scripture is kind of like a roadless
[6:25] travel not a lot of people preach on it
[6:28] but it just jumped out at me that after
[6:31] God come down in this Burning Bush and
[6:34] has this glorious conference with Moses
[6:37] Moses is able to see speak to God almost
[6:40] face to face almost as it were isn't
[6:42] that right and he hear the voice of God
[6:44] directly and get uh gets this great
[6:47] charge to go down to Egypt land god ask
[6:51] Moses what that you have in your hand he
[6:52] says a rod he says right this is the rod
[6:54] you're going to use to do Miracles
[6:56] whatever you have I'll use it if you
[6:59] have a Rod I'll use it if you have a
[7:01] stick I'll use it whatever you have I
[7:03] I'll use your shoes I I'll I'll use your
[7:05] your your staff what whatever you got in
[7:07] your hand God is able to use tonight oh
[7:11] Hallelujah any little thing don't
[7:13] despise the day of small things tonight
[7:16] and the day you hear his voice Harden
[7:19] not your heart tonight oh as in the
[7:21] provocation in the wilderness where God
[7:23] is speaking to us to get ourselves right
[7:26] with the word of God oh and here was
[7:29] Moses
[7:30] oh he came back with a countenance
[7:32] shining after having met the glory of
[7:35] God and after all of that just before
[7:38] he's getting ready to head over to Egypt
[7:40] land god comes and meets with him almost
[7:43] in secret it seems almost in private and
[7:47] has a situation that he has to bring to
[7:49] moses' attention and this is scary
[7:52] because this is a man that was supposed
[7:54] to go down to deliver God's people this
[7:56] is the man God rais up this is the man
[7:59] God waiting almost 40 years in the
[8:00] wilderness to
[8:02] get and over this issue the Lord met him
[8:07] verse 24 and sought to kill
[8:15] him in other words God was willing to
[8:17] risk his life even though he was called
[8:20] of God to do the work that he had called
[8:22] him to do he was willing to kill him
[8:25] over this issue amen something he
[8:28] neglected to do here's a prophet that
[8:31] said here in Israel and the church 1953
[8:35] he said there they are going down to
[8:36] Egypt talks about the story here he says
[8:39] and now watch he said how neglectful a
[8:42] man can get in the end Prophet said God
[8:46] met him down there in the inn and would
[8:49] have slayed him and Zapora and and it
[8:52] would have slayed him he said and theor
[8:55] went and took a sharp Rock and
[8:57] circumcised the the two children with a
[8:59] sharp Rock and throw the force skin
[9:01] before Moses and said you're a bloody
[9:03] husband to me only save Moses life her
[9:08] actions in other words in that moment
[9:11] because she was able to spring into
[9:13] action amen and this thought right here
[9:15] remind me of what brother Isaac over
[9:17] preached so massively amen talking about
[9:19] David and Abigail a women of God who
[9:22] were willing to spring into action and
[9:24] to do what was necessary to save life to
[9:27] preserve life there's another powerful
[9:30] woman of God who God raised up to spare
[9:33] life oh my my this wonderful I want to
[9:36] tie that in there amen praise God so she
[9:39] rose up did what was necessary and she
[9:42] said what and he said what was Moses
[9:44] doing Prophet said what Moses got in
[9:47] such a hustle and bustle of the day till
[9:49] he was in such a place had to go down
[9:51] there and the prophet said he forgot the
[9:54] Seal of
[9:55] circumcision what a situation to be in
[9:59] come like you're going for application
[10:01] and you need your passport and you have

[10:49] body and forever more abide God wants a
[10:53] church full of the Holy Ghost and if God
[10:57] only gets a church full of the Holy
[10:59] Ghost then God will do in one year what
[11:02] all the theologians fail to do in 2,000
[11:06] years God will do it if he has a church
[11:09] that is surrendered to God by the Holy
[11:13] Spirit a church that he could use a
[11:16] church marching and step a church
[11:18] marching according to the Beats to the
[11:20] program of
[11:21] God is not right isn't that right the
[11:26] voice of God speaks to John in re
[11:29] ations of all the churches isn't that

[11:41] but there was always something they
[11:42] lacked each one of them lacked something
[11:45] and he had to pull them up on it each
[11:47] one of them neglect something and he had
[11:49] to pull them up on it oh H you have
[11:51] fallen from your first love but I say be
[11:53] jealous therefore and repent oh

[20:19] Ghost spirit since you believe there's
[20:20] something wrong somewhere God gives
[20:23] everybody every believer the baptism of
[20:26] the Holy Spirit that's right that's

[20:56] we have to be led the same way
[20:58] as sheep to the slaughter oh H you are

[24:46] send us a
[24:49] Revival just before the great and
[24:51] terrible
[24:52] day of the
[24:55] Lord God prise God believes on the
[24:58] message the prophet talk about the great
[25:00] coming
[25:01] revival and on that message hallu he
[25:04] talks a lot about
[25:05] judgment the truth and reality is that
[25:08] God always sends a
[25:09] Revival before he sends a
[25:12] judgment truth is Russia turned down
[25:14] their
[25:15] Revival they were judged amen they
[25:17] receive a spirit yes an antichrist
[25:19] spirit in the nation it's still right in
[25:23] there the prophet identified because
[25:24] they turned on the Holy Ghost that's why
[25:27] that happened
[25:28] as a result because they
[25:31] neglected something God had revealed to
[25:34] them oh my don't neglect friends
[25:37] Hallelujah don't be neglectful don't be
[25:39] slack oh my isn't that right he said God
[25:43] is Not slack concerning his promise
[25:44] isn't that right that's second Peter 3
[25:47] I'll read it verse 9 says the Lord is
[25:49] not slack concerning his promise as some
[25:53] men count slackness but his
[25:55] longsuffering to us word not willing
[25:58] that any should perish but that all
[26:00] should come to repentance but the day of
[26:04] the Lord he says we come as a te tonight
[26:07] oh what a scripture so in the first
[26:10] script you talk about slackness
[26:11] concerning his promise and then right
[26:13] the next scripture comes in with
[26:15] judgment there's a reason for that
[26:18] because goday up braides us and he and
[26:21] he uh edifies us and pulls us up to let
[26:24] us know that there are things that he
[26:26] requires before he comes comes he says
[26:28] behold I come quickly because my reward
[26:31] is with me to give every man according
[26:34] to his
[26:37] work so you can't be caught with your
[26:39] work undone isn't that
[26:42] right because some people like to reap
[26:44] what they have not sown it's impossible
[26:47] to reap a harvest and you have not sown
[26:49] seed isn't that right you come like a
[26:51] philistin you come like you waiting for
[26:53] the Harvest to come in the fullness
[26:55] ripeness when the wheat blowing in the
[26:57] win and you come with your sickle as if
[27:00] you was working all the time God had a
[27:03] judgment for that you know God raised up
[27:05] shanga with a ox gold Ox gold for them
[27:08] thieves who like to come and reap where
[27:11] they have not sown for every Philistine
[27:15] is having the message who want to reap
[27:17] where they have not sown God going to
[27:19] raise up a Shamar to chase them Devils
[27:22] out oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[27:25] oh glory to God this is a bride's

[27:43] about your children praying about your
[27:45] family praying about your loved ones you
[27:47] are going to reap a harvest for the
[27:49] seeds that you have sown in this message

[41:06] could examine our own lives and see the
[41:08] things that we're neglecting maybe we're
[41:11] neglecting our prayer life maybe we
[41:13] neglecting to do things or or for God
[41:15] maybe neglecting to worship when we
[41:17] ought to have a better attitude when
[41:18] things go wrong in our lives when things
[41:20] go contrary May we're neglecting to see
[41:23] that he has his hand in all things maybe
[41:25] we neglecting to be thankful maybe we're
[41:27] neglecting to be grateful for the things
[41:29] we do have even when God takes it away
[41:31] from us or when God sees that is not fit
[41:33] for us to have it yet what is our
[41:36] attitude are we grateful to give him
[41:38] praise anyhow because his goodness his
[41:40] Mercy endure it forever doesn't matter
[41:43] what situation faces me what
[41:45] circumstance faces me even if he don't
[41:47] answer my prayer he's still worthy of
[41:49] all the praise worthy of all the honor

[41:57] him uh though I can't see anything uh
[42:00] the dark skies are not a sign of his
[42:02] disapproval the bright skies are not a

[42:07] my Acceptance in the Beloved he has
[42:10] accepted me by a glorious baptism of the
[42:13] Holy Ghost and though I go through the
[42:15] sunshine he is there with me though I go

[42:35] praise God for tonight there's something
[42:37] to worship God for tonight yeah yeah
