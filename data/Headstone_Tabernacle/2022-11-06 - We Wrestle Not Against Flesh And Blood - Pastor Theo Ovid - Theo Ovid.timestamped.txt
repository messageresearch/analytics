[2:50] all I can do in the Bible is Ephesians
[2:52] chapter 6 verse 10 to 12 when the
[2:54] current when just now there told by
[2:56] Stephen go straight into the communion
[2:57] if that is it because we were expecting
[2:59] that to go since this morning we don't
[3:01] know what happened
[3:02] I see it's like a miracle TN Tech all
[3:04] about and so on so we know we got
[3:07] notification that we see the current and
[3:08] so on like that but I thank God I was
[3:10] seeing I hope that her income if
[3:12] rainfall
[3:13] TNT can't work
[3:15] so
[3:16] part-time interquartering because you
[3:18] know what I mean is no but God has been
[3:21] good to us just get a little scared here
[3:23] but God is good so Ephesians chapter 6
[3:27] we don't lose 10 to 12. finally my
[3:29] brethren be strong in the Lord and the
[3:31] power of His might
[3:32] put on the whole armor of God that we
[3:35] may be able to stand against the Wilds
[3:38] of the devil for irrational against
[3:41] flesh and blood but against
[3:43] principalities against Powers against
[3:45] rulers of Darkness of this world against
[3:47] spiritual wickedness
[3:49] in high places and one more scripture I
[3:51] want to read then put up with Russian 3
[3:53] 22 he doesn't have an ear
[3:55] let him hear what the spirit says under
[3:57] the churches father we thank you for

[4:00] hearts and Jesus amen may be seated o
[4:03] praise God it's good to be here this
[4:04] evening
[4:05] praise God it's good to see all of you
[4:07] out here for this evening service it's
[4:09] coming your service
[4:10] and this evening I have an exhortation
[4:12] for you we wrestle not against flesh and
[4:14] blood
[4:15] now we know that scripture
[4:17] but I think the Consciousness that this
[4:21] is what it is
[4:22] sometimes we miss that
[4:24] that is not a flesh and blood battle
[4:26] that we're in
[4:27] but we're wrestling against
[4:28] principalities and Powers
[4:30] sometimes principalities Powers using
[4:32] your wife your husband your children
[4:34] your family your neighbors your boss
[4:35] cousin Auntie all kind of people chooses
[4:38] remember Peter
[4:48] and then Jesus talked about him being
[4:50] crucified
[4:51] all of a sudden he said no no he said
[4:53] get behind me Satan just after
[4:56] Revelation the devil jumped on Peter
[4:59] and Jesus rebuked that Spirit Get Behind
[5:03] Me Satan
[5:04] Jesus wasn't against Peter
[5:06] Jesus knew a spirit Came Upon him that
[5:09] was telling him something contrary to
[5:11] you the will of God for his life do you
[5:13] get that the will of God for his life
[5:16] was to die
[5:17] the will of his God for his life was to
[5:19] go to chemistry and her spirit will say
[5:21] no no
[5:22] don't go
[5:24] this dinoting enough for you
[5:27] you have a shortcut
[5:28] it have another way we have to be
[5:31] sensitive that we are not wrestling
[5:33] against flesh and blood
[5:35] but against principalities and Powers
[5:38] and I want you to be convinced tonight
[5:40] and today you could only overcome by the
[5:42] word

[13:22] let's go maybe seated
[13:24] I belong with you
[13:28] people don't believe even demons in this
[13:29] day
[13:32] that's why Halloween is a sport
[13:36] and a commercial thing the most ugliest
[13:38] faces the Hideous skeletons and
[13:40] everything about and the children will
[13:42] not get in frightened
[13:46] because that Halloween and all them all
[13:49] those um skeletons or them frightful
[13:51] looking things they not Lucifer you know
[13:53] that's how he used to be long time
[13:54] mostly
[13:56] that same devil has disguised himself
[14:00] in deceit
[14:03] and deception
[14:05] as the spirit of
[14:07] ever says the spirit of Truth
[14:09] because truth is not just a letter word
[14:11] you know there's a spirit of Truth
[14:13] Bradley kindness is not a quote or
[14:15] saying you know there's a spirit of
[14:16] forgiveness

[17:39] that's when money couldn't count that's

[17:56] but yes right now
[17:59] ready to say afraid not

[18:15] told us to a prophet
[18:17] to have a Revival God told us to a
[18:20] prophet that we could be a super Church
[18:22] a super praise God told us to get back
[18:24] to this scriptural land this word land

[18:29] going to stop us is every place you put
[18:31] your foot is yours Oh Glory to God

[18:49] tonight we wrestle against flesh and
[18:51] blood we must see in Flesh and Blood we
[18:53] only see what God has said we have a
[18:56] promise to go back to Eden we have a
[18:57] promise God can have the preeminances we
[19:00] have a promise that your head stood

[19:03] Pride we have a promise has so
[19:05] Tabernacle of a holy ghost Revival no

[19:28] training for a contest
[19:30] it's just like a boxer his enemy is
[19:32] going to meet out there in a contest to
[19:34] fight a real good fighter usually knows
[19:38] and studies his opponent have you ever
[19:40] studied your opponent
[19:43] he studies his licks he knows where he
[19:45] fights whether he leans forward hangs
[19:48] back fights right-handed or left-handed
[19:52] he studies all this and if he's a good
[19:55] smart fighter he gets him a sparring
[19:57] partner that will fight just like the
[19:59] opponent and he will know all the licks
[20:02] when he get to that place so God has
[20:04] given some spying partner sometimes
[20:06] something inspired father might be a
[20:08] wife might be a husband might be your
[20:10] son might be a daughter they are not the
[20:13] enemy but they aspiring partner might be
[20:16] a brother in the church might be a
[20:17] sister in the church might be your aunt
[20:19] might be your uncle you don't know who
[20:21] God put as hisparent partner but that
[20:24] person is not the enemy we rational
[20:26] against flesh and blood that person is
[20:28] not the enemy God training here how to
[20:31] fight because a bigger enemy coming we
[20:34] have the world come through our churches
[20:35] we have the Press that's coming we are
[20:37] looking at demon activity but today we
[20:40] rational against flesh and blood finally

[22:16] people anything better to defeat any of
[22:18] it he would have done it so as I've
[22:20] always said what God makes the first
[22:22] decision is the best he can't alter his
[22:24] decision now watch we have to study a
[22:27] strategy so the best thing God could
[22:28] have give us what's the word if
[22:31] everybody leave here with our word
[22:32] Consciousness but the word is God

[32:44] spiritual repentance began to hit you
[32:46] hit this church from the pulpit to the

[32:51] failed we have fallen short we need your
[32:53] mercy send on your power send on your
[32:56] glory once more Lord strip us hallelujah
[32:59] break us melt us mold
[33:03] something gonna break Something's Gonna
[33:05] take place
[33:08] let me see if I get out of here
[33:10] so Satan studied Eve he had the best
[33:13] strategy he could use upon her what a
[33:15] reason with the word now you never want
[33:17] to reason with God's word just believe
[33:19] it don't try to explain it don't try to
[33:21] figure it out you know many people say
[33:23] today there's no such thing as a devil
[33:25] they believe that the holy spirit is a
[33:27] good thought
[33:28] the Devil is a bad thought but if you
[33:30] notice when the Bible speaks of the Holy
[33:32] Spirit it says when he
[33:34] the Holy Spirit has come and he is not
[33:38] pronoun so he is a person and the Devil
[33:41] is a person and demons are persons
[33:45] and those persons are personalities
[33:50] different demons have different
[33:52] personalities
[33:56] there are demons they come in many ways
[33:59] whenever the spirit is speaking he
[34:00] speaks through the scriptures oh my
[34:03] that's how God you know God's speaking
[34:05] when you can find it back in the
[34:06] scriptures and people like Revelations
[34:09] who not in the scriptures God tell me
[34:10] and God tell me go tell them not any
[34:13] scriptures so you know what happened
[34:14] there go they tell them nothing it's a
[34:17] lying spirit
[34:18] that no scriptures complicated impact of
[34:21] it see oh my hallelujah praise God we're
[34:26] going to finish
[34:27] all right
[34:29] I'm thinking he went to India and he
[34:31] talked about I show you the Creator
[34:32] could speak and I could have said that
[34:34] and if the vision hadn't been dear by no
[34:36] means but if the one let him be God come
[34:39] and give him his sight the blind man was
[34:41] in India he said now I challenge any
[34:43] priest or Raja or holy man or any that
[34:46] may be come give him his sight and I'll
[34:49] follow your philosophy and you've made a
[34:51] converge he said that was the quietest
[34:53] bunch of people I ever heard
[34:55] man blind from worshiping his son he
[34:56] said challenge him come on come on
[34:58] openness and I said what is required
[35:00] about I see the reason you are because
[35:02] you can't
[35:05] you can't I hear him now neither can I
[35:09] but the god of Heaven
[35:12] who raised up his son Jesus Christ whose
[35:15] servant we are has just showed me a
[35:18] vision that the man is going to receive
[35:20] his sight and I said now if that be not
[35:23] so then you can order me out to India
[35:25] but if it is so every one of you owe
[35:27] your life to Jesus Christ I would like
[35:29] to ask you how many here would give
[35:31] their life to Christ if this blind man
[35:33] receive his sight you see your priest
[35:34] nobody come up here why don't they come
[35:36] they told you their religion is so big
[35:38] and great why don't somebody come and
[35:40] say something nobody come then you
[35:42] people out here if you see this blind
[35:44] man standing here the doctors examine
[35:46] his eye he's blind as he certainly is
[35:48] blind and if God give him his sight how
[35:50] many of you will serve Jesus Christ and
[35:53] just as far as I could see oceans of
[35:54] black hands as I said Lord Jesus let it
[35:58] be known that thou art God the man
[36:01] grabbed me around the neck and there
[36:03] said the male Bombay sitting there grab
[36:05] him around the neck and see as good as
[36:07] anybody
[36:08] he said what is it it's actually a power
[36:12] I know letter Dino mystery word and I
[36:15] see it so and how I see a show he says
[36:18] actually a power
[36:20] God is God
[36:21] and Satan is Satan oh if you don't
[36:24] believe in the devil he said when I
[36:26] first started I rod and headlong into
[36:28] him every day don't tell me there's no
[36:30] devil because I know better I have to
[36:32] fight with him every day
[36:34] I have to fight with him I have to fight
[36:37] with him I have to fight with him shout

[40:29] and go on you're going to be worse off
[40:30] than ever but get that place where Satan

[51:37] for I have received of the Lord that
[51:40] which also I delivered unto you
[51:42] but the Lord Jesus the same night in
[51:44] which he was betrayed took bread
[51:48] and when he had given thanks broke it
[51:50] and said take eat this is my buddy which
[51:54] is broken for you this do in remembrance
[51:57] of me
[51:58] after the same manner also he took the
[52:01] cup when he had stopped saying this cup
[52:04] is the New Testament in my blood this do
[52:07] ye as often as he drink it in
[52:10] remembrance of me
[52:12] for as often as he eat his bread and
[52:13] drink this cup he do shoe the Lord's
[52:16] death till he comes
[52:19] wherefore whosoever shall eat his bread
[52:22] and drink this cup of the Lord
[52:24] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[52:26] and blood of the Lord
[52:29] but let a man examine himself
[52:32] eat of that bread and drink of that cup
