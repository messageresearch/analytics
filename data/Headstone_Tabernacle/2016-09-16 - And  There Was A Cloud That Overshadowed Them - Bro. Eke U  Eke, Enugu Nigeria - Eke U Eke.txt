morning Lord anding on way your great bring them down safely hand over the remaining part of this service I wish to greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ one of my sons my church is on the way com I want to apprciate my brother people and he said unto them verily I say unto you shall not test of death till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power and after six days Jesus take with him Peter and James and John into high by themselves and he was transfigured before them and his rment became shining exceeding white as snow and appearto them elas and Moses and they were talking with Jesus and Peter answered and said to Jesus Master is good to be here and let us make here make let us make three Tabernacles one for the one for Moses one for for he wish not what he what to say for they were so afraid that overshadowed them came out of the saying this is my beloved Son suddenly when they had looked around round about no man anymore Jesus only with themselves God bless I have a title this morning and there was a cloud that overshadowed them now this meeting is not going to be overshadowed by circumstances this meeting is not going to be overshadowed by side talk we are gathered here for a purpose the holy spirit is going to overshadow you and there's no way you will leave this meeting sometimes even in peace talks Shadow theace talk will overshadow it shall be completely when the superal was displayed got so excited all he could think about building three Tabernacle that was not the purose and God would let that idea drop before and a cloud of the CL tell them that there's no man in the picture again they saw no man again Jesus only when the supernatural is displayed to have P's idea somebody say Amen building around the B personalities the personality one for Moses one foras and one for you and God say I have a purpose did you hear me ye the power of God was present everyall and I believe that that same power that existed there that interrupted human ideas of God to pass Resurrection listen God likes to consult with people he can meet with 500 and meet with 12 this time meeting with three and nothing stopped God come on sisters and nothing will stop godall Hallelujah let me tell you something not nothing will defeat the purose of God before you can go too far all your plans they cannot work Jesus Christ is the same today and forever same in power he can still heal better better better realize this world this top of the overow out and prove the love of God because you can't even love God do you believe it before you love God watch we came here to be and let me tell you every time God God was created within they didn't see any again time you this meeting Hallelujah listen listen listen you may be let me just come here we need a Cheng we need someone to display the love of God we need some church some groups of people this Valley here needs a group of people every of the world needs a group of people that real loyalty has overshadowed you by the Holy Ghost you love when God really overshadows you up here on the mountain is not where we talk about building tab here we want the presence of God up because down there the challenges are waiting the epileptic man is waiting overshadow to speak faith will be displayed live voice it w just be talk about you simply have to have the reality of it Glory you we have acted we have tried and those disciples kept trying epileptic person was there kep trying and kept trying the hour had come when the Son of God walk down from Mount Transfiguration suffer with you brother nothing can kill this bring him here Satan out and the demon knew hold that guy in this bride and the red say and the redeem say Glory GL so always when the power of God comes in the walls that you built around you your denominational walls will crush will be known again is the same yesterday and he said Samson Samson wanted God's what manifested before that Jezebel come to the church again yeah he wasn't praying for a new order the word of God might again so you know people want power and really they don't know what power is they don't really know what the Way Up Is Down all not sometimes not when it suits me always if you want Power see how humble you can just get away from all your wly thinking and then you've got more power a big lot of noise because you been yourself and I cannot conquer you until I conquer myself so God gave us a message something that will shape us up like a brother said want some kind of quality control that won't just be any kind of character somebody say amen amen Jesus was an embodiment of character so young people you are a challenger walk out of this meeting at the end of Sunday you're not going to see yourself as somebody that cannot you're going to see somebody that is overshadowed by God and you are going out with l o v e the only thing that can make it in there perfect love I can't go ahead and hate you that's not true and I mean he told the people he met that had passed on I God I preached what Paul well of that it's got to be what Paul preached it's got to be fitted back in the word somebody say amen amen so if brother Braham preach what and we are preaching what brother Braham preach we are also resting on that we are going to no way we can fail as somebody say Amen let me read a quote here from ad paragraph e32 now as we are coming right down how many I I believe this woman here raised her hand she studied the pyramids you know the pyamid never was capped and they rejected the headst the builders were building this one will throw it this way it doesn't this one will be pick it up it this that they had to start looking for that stone and we cannot make it without that stone so the stor that the build has rejected has become The Headstone of the this is the Lord's doing and it's marvelous in our and the people of God saying over here say something let's give a hand of praise that's why the pyramid was never CT but he left an opening that no other Stone could fill up amen amen this journey will finish and what you do for Jesus Christ is not in vain don't you ever give up Beauty calls whether you are sick whether you are tired whe the circumstances are not Lord your reps for Duty God has no other hand but your hands God has no other legs but your legs God has no other mouth final voice to the final age somebody say Amen somebody say Amen you are the gospel and the gospel didn't come in words so you will leave this meeting to go and demonstrate come on sisters come on Brothers remember that you are overshadow by God and that's something something that's no man and he has a purpose so this voice interrupt everything they were trying to fix so let's go on and finish our quote you know the pyamid never did have a cstone put on couldn't even find but it was there in the first place just that the thought it was building is almost completed we don't want the building shaking can you say Amen amen there wouldn't be many put in there you do let that perfect love be in your heart amen amen they don't know whatever happened to it why put on it Stone top of because he was rejected when he come it will be we are resting on this it will be that's right and then those stones that fit around The Headstone have to be stones that will be so completely like the pyramid is so perfect you can't run a razor blade where them Stones go together merary of this will be achieved Satan cannot so seed of discrepancy into this this is original seed spoken word is the or and would you have this Malachi four seed so keep pressing on getting narrower God will confirm his word quote the Seal of the Antichrist Los Angeles California California um 1955 March 11 because that we dance or was happy or people can shout and hit their neighbor refuse to speak to one another I don't want to hurt you but it must be told the Holy Spirit giving the gift of going forth Discerning spirits and things to the place I want tell you the truth about they got a wonderful group fine because of evil you shouldn't be that amen amen so the hour is upon us let's get down to business let's get down to business amen amen Lord do something about turn me around more let us not just be business as usual let a change come over me because because I'm overshadow let me leave this meeting a challenger not with SW but with love a proof that I evil spirits are not Caster out by they cast out by love amen amen oh I want to tell you the truth about things a wonderful separated we should be warning heart one in purpose all one Church of that's what keeps us all separated evil amen amen braham's yearning was how these walls could be broken and instead of breaking them down are multiplying them so God has to step in on the scene by overshadowing you and said this is not the e e e e e e e e e e and you speak just one and with love of God we will finish this journey of we cannot finish this J leave man alone and man wants to promote himself and God out of the picture but man wants to be recognized and John said from now I must decrease and he must increase can we willingly stay down while we keep lifting him yes we will will you love him and serve him I will in sickness yes I will in riches yes I will in poverty yes I will in disappointments in tiredness I'm not hearing you and Braham said see so we base it all upon wrong thing B solidly upon thought sayth the Lord upon the word will so um talking about a condescending God coming down now God so in love with his creatures and that Jehovah God that created all those things in the heart of you before he did that he had to clean his road to show then he had to come down and show them love and then break his way right in the heart of man is in us that's right now we are his hands we are his eyes on we are his gospel on earth and the gospel is not Al together by the word what made manifest is the gospel go into the world and Demon the power of the Holy Spirit to all the nations you gospels here ye him if I don't have anything to say I'll close my mouth shouldn't be I rather have preach and how can God send you without ability to demonstrate what you're out there for it hasn't changed it hasn't changed he will stand with us to the end of this road will be I didn't say that God said so amen amen Capstone of Love Capone of hatred the same God that overshadowed Mary with his AUST presence no matter what the brother did what the sister did 70 times how many times will I keep forgiving as your off you are the gopel of Jesus Christ not the gospel of a church I'm not ashamed the gopel the Gospel of Jesus Christ I'm will to should I believe your T to give your I'm ready to do what he wants me to do I was a good singer I just want Christ to understand that I'm not going to give up I've come too far nobody has ever told me that the road will be easy and I don't believe he brought me this far hallelujah hallelujah on my Transfiguration one day when there was Peter James and John standing shadowed with a CL and spoke out this is when Jesus when brother Elijah was ready to go up a CL of fire came down brother in this Resurrection time one more time our God is not in v will come down with wav after W live this Earth it's all bundled up in love praise the Lord the love God had in his plan when he was he wanted to show us that love that nothing was going to stand on his way nobody ever believed God nobody ever without God giving you your expected end the word of God canot fail praise God Amen let let me tell you brother the word of God is inspired the word of God is eternal the word of God is Everlasting the word of God is nonfading nonfading declaration from God the Bible we read now the Bible we read now that Wesley read saw it from his own day's point this is our day when we read the same scripture that the apostles read is a finishing PA is a makes more meaning to it PA then said time is short but brother they had a lot to look up to or look forward to brother Place wrote a sign post some things that will actually get us to much Miss the time or the season and now friends you can achieve anything by your own power it has to take the presence it has to take behind your skin Hallelujah that same God that was failed behind Peter's King fell behind Apostle Paul's behind all these Messengers that same God is the final what he started doing he will keep doing it until he does it for the last time and if you are here sick you can't stay sick God is if you here you can't stay God is a restorer if you are here with hatred God is not associated with hatred so he will deliv you somebody saying if you need a Revival that overshadowing presence will revive you remember Ron R forgotten overnight it blows on
