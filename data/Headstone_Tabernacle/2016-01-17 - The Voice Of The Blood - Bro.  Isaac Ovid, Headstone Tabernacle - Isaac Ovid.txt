you Lord Jesus amen you may be seated for a few minutes before I get to the message this morning are you happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning there is life in the house of the Lord there is peace in the house of the Lord there's victory in the house of the Lord there's an anointing in the the house of the Lord there is Deliverance in the house of the Lord there is healing in the house of the Lord there is breakthrough in the house of the Lord David said I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord are you happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning amen you came to the house of the Lord to be edified to be strengthened to be encouraged to be built up and to make spiritual progress the saddest thing is a Christian is to be in the same position the same condition that you were in last week and you're in the same condition this week I pray that that cycle is broken today and every day becomes sweeter than the day before every day you see something clearer every day more Revelation every day more faith every day your faith is Anointed every day you are more a way that you are getting out of here and everything around you is a distraction and you recogniz that you are focused on that prize focused on the Holy Ghost can the church say Amen what can we say about the message last Sunday the Tim of the Gentiles you appreciate the pastor brother ID what a masterpiece and it was really such a blessing to see the grace of God to us that God blinded the eyes of the Jews to graft the Gentiles in so that we could have an opportunity to partake of his goodness that we could have an opportunity to access his goodness that we could have an opportunity to be HS as Royal seeds of Abraham because we didn't have a chance to begin with but God had certain attributes that he had to express so he had to stop the Jews to bring you in and the time is about over but before we leave this place God is going to do something for you he's going to do something for your family he's going to do something for your house he's not going to leave you unfinished but when it's finished he's going to go back to the Jews but he's still working on me he's still working on you and if you don't have the Holy Ghost count down it's coming count down it's coming you may not be healed yet physically seeing it but he paid for your healing all the way back on Calvary the devil is still a liar this morning the devil is still defeated this morning the devil is still a bluff this morning the devil still doesn't know who you are this morning but I believe we have a revelation this morning of who God is who we are and who the devil is and with that confidence we could come to church boldly we could come to church in faith we could come to church to possess What God Says belongs to us somebody say [Music] [Applause] amen and uh it's really mindblowing I shared this in maraval and in kupi as well well you don't have to find it yet but in Matthew 24:3 the Bible said as and as he sat upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be because the disciples had a revelation that time had to come to an end everything that had a beginning had to come to an end and the disciples didn't ask Jesus the question when everybody else was around they waited until they had him privately because these were the same disciples bear in mind this is Matthew 24 this is after Matthew 16 who do men say that I am these were the disciples coming to make sure that they don't miss it they didn't want to take a chance and miss it so when the crowd went away when the make Believers went away when the Pharisees and the sadu sees and those who just come to church because they want to come to church the disciples say Jesus Hallelujah there's nobody else here tell us what's about to happen what shall be the sign of thy coming and the end of the world and Jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you the first phrase he said and that's what I shared on Thursday night in canopia take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many many shall be deceived thinking that coming to church is all that is required many will be deceived thinking that because they're in the message that they're okay many shall be deceived thinking that's doing this or that will be all right but he goes on and says for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many and he shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that ye be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in diverse places so that's why I always say the bride is not supposed to be surprised because these things are supposed to be happening there're supposed to be Kingdom against Kingdom there's supposed to be famine and God will turn the heat up because these things are supposed to happen he said all these are the beginnings of Sorrows they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all Nations for my name's sake then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he that shall endure until the end the same shall be saved and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the End come so church I believe that the the time has come for us to take our position as the bride because we are not waiting on the world Russia is in its place America is in its place Isis is in its place the diseases are in their place all the criminals and the crime and the evil and the lust and the pornography it's all in their place but this gospel has got to be preached and then the end is going to come and my Bible tells me this gospel is not in word only but it's in power and demonstration so the gospel will be preached in power and demonstration and then the end will come in other words this gospel will be preached and the sick will be healed and then the end will come the gospel will be preached and the blind eyes will open and then the end could come so the end has to wait this morning because there are some Sons and Daughters who need healing this morning so the end has to wait you didn't hear me this morning the end has to wait until there's a demonstration of the Holy Ghost in your life the end has to wait so don't worry about the ending because God is waiting on you and I he wants to pour His holy ghost in [Music] you oh Glory Hallelujah hallu so I'm excited this morning because we are here to get marching orders we are here to get ready and we are here to give the devil the final knockout punch and I'm here to encourage your faith this morning because many times as a Christians we go through our ups and downs and our trials and our situations but this morning I want to preach about the blood because there's power in the blood and the blood prevails many time we forget that it's all about the blood and brother brandom said it's only under the shed blood we could have Fellowship so we are Under The Canopy of the blood this morning because the blood the Bible says speaks better things it speaks better than you could speak it speaks better than your family could speak when you you need a recommendation from somebody they could only say certain things about you but the blood is the best recommendation you could ever get because in your sickness the blood speaks of your healing in your depression the blood could speak and say you're coming out of it because there's power in the blood there's Life In The Blood there's blood for you there's blood for your children there's blood for your house there's blood for the back Siders there's blood this morning there's power in the blood the devil is afraid of the blood but the blood is going to Prevail thank God for the blood thank God for the cleansing blood so if you came in this morning and you came in with sin and condemnation there's blood this morning blood for your mistakes blood for your past so I don't care what happened yesterday I don't care what happened last week there's blood this morning put it under the blood and March all the way to the resurrection put it under the blood and receive the Holy Ghost put it under the blood under need the blood where the devil could do me no harm no harm no harm no harm that's the message it's a bleedy bloody message that's the gospel there's blood for you and when I see the blood I'm going to pass over you we got to apply the blood that's what we're going to speak in this morning we're going to apply the blood because when he sees the blood he doesn't see your mistakes oh when he looks through the blood uh he doesn't see your failures when he looks through the blood he doesn't see what you did 5 years ago when he looks through the blood uh he doesn't see that no he looks through the blood and under there there's something happening and I believe this morning God has some young people he's going to raise up because they are covered by the blood you may be seated Oh Glory to God when you get a revelation of the blood you get a revelation the devil is finished you got a revelation that the devil is the accuser of the Brethren you got a revelation that the devil is still walking about to and he and his demons accusing you you did that you made this mistake trying to get you to forget that there's a blood sacrifice for you he walks around reminding you of this thought and that problem that's his job to remind you but this morning we are here to remind you about the blood because the blood is life and the blood is the word and when you apply the blood the devil has to let you go Oh Glory to God so I pray that this morning you get a renewal of your mind a renewal of your heart as David said restore unto me the joy of my salvation it's hard to have joy if you're feeling condemned it's hard to have joy if you worrying about what you did but if you could apply the blood this morning the blood makes a way to free from condemnation the blood makes a way you don't have to sin no more you don't have to backslide no more you don't have to be any kind of way this morning you don't have to be a church member this morning because of the blood you could be a bride member this morning because of the blood you are predestinated this morning before there was a world before there was a moon a star the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and he wrote your name in blood oh blessed be the name of the Lord we have a note of Praise You may be seated from Sister nairon giving God praise for a successful operation after prayer was prayed was offered for her sister may the Lord bless you we thank God for that amen so just to remind you service continues this week on Tuesday in maraval make

so if you have your Bibles can we stand to our feet and we're going to read two portions of scripture amen we're going to read from Exodus chapter 12 Exodus chapter 12 and reading from Revelation chapter 5 Exodus 12 and verse 12 for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will will Smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and Beast and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt I reading from Revelation CH 5 and reading from verse 1 and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not Behold a lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and low in the in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the ELD still a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and the four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them HS and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of saints and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and Hast redeemed Us by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and priest and we shall reign on the Earth shall we bow our heads for a word of prayer our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your grace for your love for your mercy that we could be gathered in your house this morning Lord to give you praise to give you glory to give you honor Lord and any man could read the scriptures but it takes the Holy Spirit to bring it to life may you speak to your children this morning we are a needy people Lord I am needy this morning we are needy this morning may you move through the house Lord may you move through the internet to those who are connected those who will hear this tape and Lord may you bless your people may you open our understanding to the scriptures Lord May life Zoe even Zoe itself moved through the camp made charity Lord the Capstone of Love made the Holy Ghost itself Lord move through the camp and search Our Lives search our hearts may you deliver the captives if there's anyone back sliden this morning Father may you break the chains of the captives Lord the enemy try to bind the people but father we rebuke the enemy this morning in the name of Jesus Christ and we say House of Hell give weight in the name of Jesus Lord may you speak to your people may you deliver your people may you touch your people may you have the preeminence may you take me completely out of the way and hide me behind the cross and may you speak to your church in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says amen and amen and amen you may be seated this morning Hallelujah so for a title this morning the voice of the blood the voice of the blood my subject this morning when I see the blood and my inspiration apply the token apply the token the voice of the blood all that we experience now is as a consequence of sin that entered in Genesis amen and after sin and man fell the Bible says in Genesis 4 and chapter 3 that in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground and offering unto the Lord and Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell and the Lord said unto Cain why art thou wroth and why is thy countenance Fallen if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lith at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him and Cain talked with abrel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him and the Lord said unto Cain where is Abel thy brother and he said I know not am I My Brother's Keeper and he said what hast thou done the voice of thy brother's blood cry it unto me from the ground now brother brandham taught us that the devil hates two books of the Bible in particular he hates the Book of Genesis and he hates the Book of Revelation because Genesis is where it begins and Revelation is where it ends but hidden there in the Book of Genesis there's a phrase that I love the voice of thy brother's blood cth unto me from the ground so way back in Genesis God is speaking about the the voice of the blood so Abel was dead but there was a voice in his blood that was speaking and this morning we want to speak about the voice in the blood because brother brandham said in the token he said Paul tells us speaking about the blood that the blood could speak he said you believe the blood speaks he said in Genesis God told Cain where is your brother the blood his the voice of his blood calls out against you and now we also find in Hebrews the blood speaks better things the blood is speaking then the blood has got a voice and the voice of the blood is the word hallelujah that's what makes it whether it's right or wrong the word is identified by the voice of the blood remember the brandom goes on he says the voice of the blood is the holy ghost that brings life it is life and it brings life to the word and quickened it so sure the blood speaks it speaks a better thing in the Old Testament the blood spoke of guilt in the New Testament it speaks of redemption in the Old Testament it spoke of death and sorrow in the New Testament it speaks of resurrection and life it speaks of healing it speaks of Joy it speaks of power that's the prophet it speaks of life it speaks of heaven so the voice of the blood has something to say this morning and that same blood brother brandham said that was shed upon the ground that called out after his dead brother or called out after his brother had killed them the blood of Jesus Christ covers all of our sins and speaks peace and Resurrection the power and the life and healing and brother Brandon said what we need is a blood transfusion so right now your blood is speaking something your life is speaking something but if you get a blood transfusion and the blood of Jesus Takes complete control of you then that blood has a voice and that voice will speak and when that voice speaks everyone has to take note because it is the voice of God and brother Bram said the voice of God is the Holy Ghost so God wants to bring a transfusion inside of your soul put you on the operating table and take out your blood take out your spirit take out your ideas take out your feelings so that his blood his power his Spirit his word his mechanics his Dynamics can begin to flow through you and the church amen oh Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord It's All About the blood the devil wants us to get tied up in your past and in your mistake but it's because of the blood you don't have to look at your past you don't have to look at your mistakes even brother branam had forgotten for a moment about the blood one day he said he was hungry and he went into a restaurant to eat you know the story and he went in there and and he saw a young girl and he said she was hanging over exposing herself and young men were flirting with her and he looked to this side and there was a old lady with all kind of makeup on her foot he spoke about it makeup on her hands dressed with a short skirt he looked this way he saw this he looked that way he said God aren't you going to judge this filthy world aren't you going to destroy this world is this the kind of world that my children have to grow up in and God tapped him on the shoulder and took him up into another realm and he showed him the whole earth and he showed him a red streak over the Earth and he showed him that streak represented the blood and every time he sinned but the brandom said God took him back to when he was a young man when he was a young boy and he was doing things he shouldn't be doing but God wasn't seeing them because every time he did it it hit the blood and it never reached to God so it's because of the blood so whatever your need is this morning put it under the blood put your situation under the blood you may be seated because the blood will speak when the devil says you're guilty the blood is your lawyer the blood says not guilty I don't have every evidence I don't have any evidence because the blood is speaking this morning so your doctor says you are sick but the blood says you are well this morning the can the Church Say Amen oh Hallelujah brother brandom said we must believe for ourself like they did down there in Egypt for the house like they did in Egypt and Jericho and so forth we find out I got a scripture here acts 16 this is where the r I'm speaking where the Roman Centurion was to take his own life and he was going to stab himself to death and Paul told him believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and die and thy house will be saved it's got to be a household so brother brandom was kneeling down about the blood applying to your household so I don't care what condition your son your daughter your family is in if you apply the blood on the household it covers your household stop worrying stop talking and just apply the blood it's all about the blood the devil wants you to look at them and God is only looking at the blood can the church amen listen to The Prophet what makes so many women on the street what makes so much juvenile delinquency it's because we're not able to get our household under the blood amen amen Amen brother Bram goes on some people say well I belong to church mother went up there I was dedicated as a baby brother brandham said you must display the token yes sir move out all the worldly trash all the things of the world because you can't love the things of the world all your unbelief in God's words remember he promised that these last days anything in your life that's against that move it out and get ready to bring the token in then apply the token how in prayer with Consecration and be convinced and concerned about it can the church say amen amen so I want you to understand Hallelujah man fell that's and once man fell sin entered in the camp and because of sin a sacrifice must be made because sin has consequen sin must be judged God is a just God sin must be judged so God is waiting for somebody to get a revelation to deal with this sin problem so by Revelation Abel recognized that his condition wasn't worthy to go in the presence of God he's by Revelation he recognized that he just he could just come to church with his past and his job he had to come to church with a certain approach he had to have a certain approach and by revelation he got quickened with understanding and he went and he looked for a lamb and he found one and he killed the lamb and God was pleased because God said yes you should have died but that lamb took your place I should have killed you but that lamb took the place and when I saw that blood I realized that I could spare you because that lamb took your place do you understand that you were born in sin shaped in iniquity and every mistake you made God had every right to kill you if it wasn't for the blood you'd be dead already but there's a blood sacrifice there's a blood offering offered for you that you could have life and have it more abundantly somebody say amen that's why brother the brandom said it's nothing but the grace of almighty God we should even be here this morning but he left the glory come down as a former from man and put his body on Calvary and he died and he paid the price and he shed his blood because there were some people that had to come forth you may be seated God was not going to let the devil have the final statement about what happened there in Genesis God was not going to let the devil have the final say God is saying my blood is going to speak when you are depressed and you can't even talk the blood is going to speak whenever you can't even worship the blood is still speaking because there's power in the blood is life in the blood oh [Applause] Hallelujah so Abel got that Revelation Kain also had a revelation brother brandom said they were both spiritual that's right Cain wasn't in a party Kane came to church that's right to bring his sacrifice but his sacrifice was the fruit of the field his sacrifice was his intellectual conception of what God would want because God is looking for fruit and Kain said it has to be this kind of fruit so he went to get all the natural fruit and put together nice presentation Hallelujah and many times we want to bring our beautiful idea to God and say Lord take this I've studied so hard take this this is My Sacrifice I've done this and done that and God I want you to take this and God is looking for the blood can the church say Amen so there's power this morning in the blood Hallelujah but the hard thing was before Jesus came they were under the law that's right that's right and they had to kill the Bulls and the goats and the law was hard in Galatians 3 Paul says Christ ha redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us because the law was hard do this don't do that do this don't do if you do this no one could be pure enough under the law Hallelujah no one could be good enough under the law no one could be holy enough to obey the law the law held men in bondage and showed almost every imperfection in humanity but the blood of Jesus freed us from the curse of sin and freed us from the curse of death every other day under the Old Law you have to kill a lamb you have to kill a goat you have to kill a but when Jesus came and shed his blood that took care of everything no more you to go through the routine his blood conquered everything it was no longer a ritual it was no longer a tradition but his blood broke the veil to the holies of holies his blood give you access his blood give you rights because when you apply the blood you could access your healing can the church say Amen oh Hallelujah I hope this trigger something in your heart this morning that's what Redemption is all about the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world everything in the Old Testament with a shadow or a type of the Lamb that was going to come when Jesus walked the Earth they didn't realize he was the lamb that was filling all fulfilling all scripture he said I don't come to fight the law I come to fulfill the law because there are some people they're not born under the law they are not natural Jews but they are spiritual Jews but my blood will make a way for them My Sacrifice will make a way for them listen it's not how much you read it's not even about that but it's because of the blood can the church say Amen Adam lost the title deed Adam lost his right Adam lost his inheritance and that deed went back in the hands of the original own that book was sealed and John wept because he looked to the left he looked to the right he looked up he said in heaven on everywhere under the Earth there was nobody found worthy John by Revelation he knew that that book was the key to the power he knew that that book was the key to Restoration John knew he wasn't in the position he was born for but he knew way back in Genesis when Adam stood he could speak and whatever he said had to happen John by Revelation knew from the moment he was born there was something wrong with the world by Revelation he knew when he got sick this cannot be how it's supposed to be he knew when the devil brought thoughts to his mind this cannot be what my life is about so John wept because by Revelation that book held the mystery of redemption that book held the mystery of restoration in that book was the power that was for you in that book was the power for you to speak to your children come back preach back to me this morning oh you don't hear me this morning so John was crying John was in the spirit he was caught up he wasn't in the world he was crying he was in the spirit and he was waiting for somebody is there anybody who could unlock the mystery of who I am is there somebody who could open the book because my name has to be somewhere is there somebody who could unlock the key to my future is there somebody who could unlock the key to where I come from because I come from God I know I come from God I know I'm going back to God but I don't know because I can't see my name hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated and in the midst of John's turmoil in the midst of John's questions in the midst of John's depressions John was caught up in another place but he wasn't happy he was caught up in another place because he couldn't go back to where he came from because that book had to be unsealed for Redemption complete Redemption to take place and that's what we are looking for total Redemption Total Restoration total Deliverance can the church say amen that's what I need to go back back to where I would have been if Adam didn't [Applause] fall oh Hallelujah you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah nobody could redeem nothing unless there's a kinsman redeemer only a family only somebody like you could redeem you so God left glory and put on 16 elements and the Bible said he was tempted just as we were tempted he walked the road just as you walked the road he saw sin and he turned away he lived just as we did he got depressed he got upset he was hungry he went to a fig tree there were no figs on the tree he cursed the tree it died from the root at the grave of Lazarus he cried and wept because he felt the pain and the loss of what death represented but locked up in him was resurrection and life but he had to die and blood had to be shed blood was the password blood was the key blood was the key to unlock it so John he didn't see the full mystery but all of a sudden of voice screamed out stop crying John stop being depressed John come on John stop worrying about your problem come on John stop being upset stop being frustrated stop being confused of if you're going to get the Holy Ghost stop worrying about whether you're going to get adopted stop worrying about your children weep not weep not hallu Hallelujah everybody feeling fine this morning morning Hallelujah Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David have prevailed and instead of a lion walking out here comes a bleedy bloody lamb here comes the bleedy bloody Messiah here comes the word of all ages here comes the god of creation Here Comes L Elohim Here Comes El Shai Here Comes Jehovah chyra here comes the lily of the valley here comes the bright and Morning Star here comes the fairest of 10 th Here Comes God himself bleeding bloody a lamb and he took the book he took the book he took the book that held your name he took the book that held the mystery of who you are because the devil could only hold you but once that book opens the devil has got to let you go if you don't know who you are the devil could hold you but when that book opens he has no right he has no power he has no Authority because if your name is in there if your name is in there you got to be over there oh you don't hear me this morning Hallelujah and the lamb he be to open one seal he opened another seal he opened another seal he opened the fourth seal he opened the fifth seal he open the six seal he opened the seven seal you may be seated hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah because of the blood because the sacrifice was paid the key to the seals were unlocked and in 1963 seven angels come up from eternity but the BAM said each angel came to him to speak about each Church age God opened his mystery to his Prophet but his Prophet couldn't say it in full every seal had a people every seal had a mystery first seal second seal third fourth fifth to the Jews come on six is the Judgment seal Hallelujah but when you open the seven sealen there was silence there was a mystery there was no noise there was no sound when you open a seven [Applause] seal silence space of half hour brother brandom said mystery people got confused in the message because everything that had a beginning has an ending at the beginning of the seventh seal it was a mystery but there's a finishing of the seven seal when it will no longer be a mystery when the silence will be over and there will be a people who were hidden under there hidden under that seal you Jesus you may be seated everybody feeling fine everybody know where they come from you are the Fulfillment of Prophecy the devil has no clue because John was told to seal it don't write it thank you Jesus because if the devil only finds out who the secret agents are on the earth who will take over who will overthrow the political system and the religious system God deployed some secret agents from under the seven seal the CIA a't got nothing on the seven seal the FBI ain't got nothing on the seventh seal secret agents predestinated from before the foundation of the world some of them don't even know each other but all of a sudden you find yourself gathering with strange people God bless you where you come from I don't know where your family is but there's a pull from on high something sto me when I was drinking one day I I read a book I heard a tape somebody invited me I didn't even know I was an agent but I have by Revelation I see my name on the book I don't know how it's all going to unfold just yet but I know I'm a man on a mission I know I'm a man on a mission because they are sick that are going to be healed there's blind that eyes have to open and God has no eyes but your eyes he has no feet but your feet can the church say Amen do we have fire in the house this morning do we have sons and daughters who know who they are this morning you may be [Applause] seated [Applause] hallelu Hallelujah I'm not too old but when I was younger I used to love to read books about secret agents when I was younger when I saw Ten Commandments I wanted to be Moses when when I saw Ben her I wanted to be Ben her when I read about secret agents I wanted to be a secret agent little did I know that I'm a secret I'm a mystery I come from God and I'm going back to God the devil couldn't even figure out who Jesus was if thou be if thou be and the devil is morning he's looking around he already has the world but he's wondering if thou be the bride then do this I got no answer for the devil I'm not argue with the devil there's a power coming into the church and now it's coming in when the bride will speak and whatever they say will you may be [Applause] seated so God Amen kept me from being a natural amen secret agent amen amen this country is too small anyway to have real secret agents but in the bigger countries they have whole secret units that go around the world and stuff to protect the country and protect the kingdom but what's interesting about these secret agents sometimes countries may send a child in yes at a young age and have them grow up in that other country as if they are living there their whole lives and they're just waiting to be activated sometimes they don't even know where their Heritage are they think they might be adopted and maybe from this country and that country and they go to school there because the country wants them to be like that country but then one day they get the instructions now you've been activated we need to go and do this and do that and do that so God had to find a way to slip some people in through the seven seal he played some in ARA played some in portter Spain play some in Maro slip them in the jobs in this job and in that job and you went to school like everybody else and you went to your job like everybody else and you ate in KF like everybody else and you eating chaps like everybody else but little does the devil know that there's some secret agents moving around the town waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God when born Sons filled Sons [Applause] speak can the church say Amen you appreciate the Lord this morning you thank God for the blood made a way for you to be here this morning [Applause] you may be seated we're doing good this morning last week the Pastor said make sure and eat breakfast yes and buckle your seats in that's right because we come to get ready for Spiritual takeoff Hallelujah spiritual astronauts getting ready to leave this place and we should at least give God a day or two or three in the week because we getting ready to get out of here so we're supposed to be so happy to come into the house of God the presence of God God we we can get instructions on how to Leave the World Behind and disconnect all the cords they're trying to hold their spaceship down you got to cut all the cords God so that when the magnet comes to pick you up there's no hindrance there's no obstacle your job doesn't matter your mortgage don't matter your mortgage is not your problem it'll be the bank problem when that time comes Hallelujah amen so listen carefully I believe it's March 24th 1963 but the random said the third pull is coming up but certain signs had to take place now if you followed by the br's message in the summer of 1963 he began to preach certain things the seven seal itself couldn't break to the people because certain signs had to come forth certain people had to be here because every seal has a people so brother Brandon was speaking to a people that were Yet to Come can the church say amen and you have to realize that when a man speaks by faith like Paul Paul says we who are alive and remain Paul put himself in there he wasn't say you who are alive and remain he thought he was going to be there but you have to speak by faith because now Faith is so you don't push it to the future but you speak by faith so but the Bram is beginning to put things in place so he preaches in warning then judgment then he speaks to Third Exodus then he preaches why Christ speak he's moving on he's waiting for something to happen every message was leading up to something then he moved into a specific message called the token which by Brother bram's own words he called it his greatest message the token he said you must apply the token amen can the Church Say Amen he told us by faith to apply the token because the token is all about the coming of Christ it's all about the third pull it's all about the seven seal and the token could have only been applied after the prophet in the fullness because the Full Life of Christ the full word had now been restored and now God could come to claim his own so with said the blood this Blood we're talking about is in the person of the word so every service that you come to you are applying the token upon your house by feasting on the word in other words when you make a mistake and you fall short and you put a tape on and you get in the spirit that's applying the token hallah to your life covering your life with your blood and then all of a sudden conviction hits your heart and you say wait a minute I didn't know that was wrong something convicts you and then you repent that's the blood atonement that's right Hallelujah because this thing we're talking about there will be no impersonation to it amen hallelujah this is not something you sign up for and say sign me up sign me up put my name down no it's not that it's something that you have to do apply the blood to your house Hallelujah yourself amen I said this on Tuesday night in maraval I said the Pastor cannot apply the blood on your house Moses told the people kill a lamb prepare yourself put the blood on your house Moses had to make sure the blood was in his house that's right you have to make sure the blood is in your house that's right your children may understand it but the blood that's right has to be on the house because they can be contrary but if they are underneath the blood when I see the blood I'll pass over you somebody say Amen so this mystery is a total secret because God always had an elected bride who would hear the countdown and they would make ready hallelujah thank you Jesus it'll be the word age it'll be the bride age it'll be the call out age headd there at the end of the Le ofan age and not one word can be broken that's right many people say all kind of things in the message and they say all kind of stuff but this is still the message of Luther plus the message of Wesley plus the message of the Pentecostal plus what brother manam restored amen so the requirement for this age is everything that is gone because we have the fullness of the word and the fullness of the word brings a fullness of the atonement can the church say [Applause] Amen don't break one word of it so God hid the message he hid the blood on books and tapes prise God Waiting for the End of the Age Hallelujah waiting for the seven seal the finishing of the seven seal waiting for you to be here waiting for everything that has taken place to take place for what a short quick message that will shake the whole nation can the church say Amen so we are in the called out time and we have a hope this morning the signs are all around us and we are in the time of his coming Hallelujah and God is pulling a gentile bride into her position it is because of the blood we could have Fellowship that's right friends if under the blood of bulls and goats Moses could speak flies if under the blood of bulls and goats Moses could speak frogs if under the blood of bulls and goats Joshua could say son stand still what about our day when we have the fullness of the atonement hallelujah what power will be locked up in this bride Hallelujah now listen carefully the word in each age is the blood of that age that's right that's right so if you receive the word the blood sanctifies you the blood cleanses you but there's another element yes tell us because brother brand and through the scripture we see it's water blood spirit so God baptized the Earth in the days of Noah when Jesus came the blood fell on the earth and there's something remaining which is what fire water Blood Fire so friends the blood takes away your sin but there's still a desire in your heart that has to be changed and only fire could deal with that desire so that's why you need the Holy Ghost you need an experience you need a baptism you need fire because even though there's blood speaking for you the blood is speaking for you until you get in touch with the fire and the fire takes complete control and now you are evidence of the whole mystery of God in your life when you repent you're baptized the blood speaks for you and now fire takes over completely Burns that demon in your heart out and now you are son Pillar of Fire in your heart adopted son when you speak the Devils tremble you don't even have to speak because the light is the thunder that shakes the devil when you walk the street the devil crosses the street because you are a manifested son of God Amen that's it so the word for each age is the blood for each age which means there's a blood for our age yes because the word for our age or the virtue for our age is brotherly kindness that's it amen that's it so it's only through brotherly kindness only through the blood of the age of forgiveness we could even talk about charity Hallelujah because charity is where we need to reach because when you read the Bible you could have all kinds of gifts all kind of Revelations speak in tones amen amen and have nothing you could have an experience and you still up one day you still down one day you're on fire last week and this week the devil get run for your money under the blood you have a perfect standing but there's a perfect state to come and under the perfect state which charity brings you to the perfect State there's no more backsliding there's no more depression there's no more frustration there's no more sickness there's no more sadness because you are now totally transformed redeemed complete can the church say Amen so God wants you to not only have a perfect standing Hallelujah but a perfect State no more ups and downs no more in and out no more toss to and fro by every wind of Doctrine no more being confused no more wondering if you're going to make it no more I don't know where I stand no more fighting to get time to pray no more you don't know where your Bible is no more you don't know what the prophet said all of a sudden you have a perfect standing you have a perfect State the devil knows don't mess with that one don't mess with that one and all God is saying there's my spirit flowing freely there's my spirit flowing freely he's 12 years old but my spirit is Flowing freely she is 16 years old my spirit is Flowing freely he is 99 years old and my spirit is Flowing freely can the church say Amen hallu oh walking in charity so this message this morning is to the individual amen for every man to examine himself because they are lost sheep right here in the church people who sit and come to church every service and they have yet to apply the token the only encounter with the Supernatural is when they come to church on a Sunday but applying the token is a everyday walk hallelujah hallelujah you can't put on the blood today and take it off tomorrow because you don't want anybody to see it we may get to it but brother brandham said when they told him to apply the blood and the door post God wanted it visible [Music] and that's why I say to the young people a people have to wonder if you're a Christian something is wrong because the evidence of your Christianity should be displayed people must look at you and say that one is different that one is different because the token is undisplayed the token must be displayed when I see the blood I'll pass over you so there should be no question about who your father is who your God is you are not ashamed to a testimony you're not ashamed to dress like a Christian walk like a Christian worship like a Christian pray like a Christian because you know who you are and you have applied a token on your house from the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed look only in an individual this is but random never in a group an individual not in a group his identification is with an individual you get that not not with the Methodist not with the Baptist not with the Presbyterian not with the Lutheran not the Pentecostal but as an individual and it's so important that you get grounded with this because you will have to stand alone that's right the test is when you alone many of us pass what I call the church life test that's just that's you you're in church on Sunday and everybody knows you're Christian for that period of time that you're in church that that's called The Church Life test but God is not judging you on how you are when you in church hallelujah what God wants to see is how you are on Monday how you are on Tuesday what happens on Wednesday when the boss gets you upset he wants to see how you are then that's what he's interested in when your wife says something to you and you know you didn't like it and you you have the best response ready to go but you're still your tongue and temperance takes over that's what he wants to see amen when your children get you up a wall but yet you have patience and they don't even know why you have this Comfort but you have a comforter because he promis to never leave you or forsake you to be a comfort that's what he wants to see you could wait on God to answer your prayer because God as brother over said a few weeks ago he is not going he's not here to answer your greed he's here to answer you need yes so have the things you want God said you're not getting it Hallelujah that's why your press should be Lord not my will but th will be done you will stop getting disappointed when you start to pray for his will to be done Lord I want this I want this and God say no denied denied you know you apply for something and you're waiting for approval God say denied denied not that not that because God wants the best for you he knows what's best for you he knows what you need to bring out a character in you so stop asking for stuff he not going to give you but say Lord not my will but thy will be done but what he promised you you have every right to claim it he promised you your family he promised you Joy he promised you peace he promis you the Holy Ghost he promises Supply your needs can the church say amen hallelujah hallelujah I'll take one I'll leave one I'll separate them that's right there'll be two in the field I'll take one and leave one there'll be two in the bed I'll take one and leave one it's not a group no so to go in the Rapture friends you must display the token that's the only way the token must be displayed the devil has a response to your scriptures the devil has a response to your quotes but the devil has no response to the life Hallelujah when that life tunders Out the Devil have no answer he just have to walk away but you could debate scripture all day long and that's why listen I'm so careful now people who say all kind of stuff about the prophet and the message and they have this position and this opinion and the simple basic script is they don't want to live it show me the life amen show me the life years ago brother keman said show me a church with the fullness of the signs and the wonders in it show me if not we are contending for it we are contended for the life we are contended for a manifestation so don't get upset with me when I'm crying and I'm pleading and say Get Right with God we are contending for something because judgment the Bible says begins in the sanctuary judgment begins in the church and brother brandham said God will send situations into the church send situation into your family send situation into your house just for one purpose to prove the character that you have because power has got to come and God will not give power to people with no character can the church say Amen so this morning the devil thought you'd be backslid but you are here because the blood is speaking for you this morning the devil taught you to be depressed but you are here because the blood is speaking the devil taught you to be dead but there's a blood sacrifice for you and because of that blood sacrifice we have access access rights to God this morning can the church say Amen from the message the world is falling apart but said friends we are not promised a system Jesus wouldn't have nothing to do with a system we wasn't promised a system we are promised a kingdom and how do you get into it by one Spirit we are all baptized into this Kingdom it's the kingdom of God it's the kingdom of eternal life can the church say amen and brother brandham screams out in the messenger token apply it church now don't fail will you now Jesus and brother Bram says it with emphasis don't don't don't let the sunset is this your prayer today amen don't let the sunet Hallelujah don't don't don't don't he says this four times rest day or night don't take no chance and that's why I read at the beginning the disciples came to Jesus they didn't want to take a chance they say tell us what the signs are because we want to be ready Hallelujah and butom is pleading with random Tabernacle it won't work children it won't work you must have the token you say I believe yes I go I yeah I believe the message that's all right that's good but you must have the token do you hear Bram Tabernacle and this morning I said Do you hear headstone Tabernacle Hallelujah you must have the token displayed without it all your believing is in vain that's right you know when I was sharing this week in the midweek services but brought it out so beautifully that those who follow the pillar of fire will be a persecuted Bunch Hallelujah the squeeze and the Press will come and the bride will have power to deal with the challenge it'll be a short quick message the Rapture will go and the but the said the brid A persecuted hunted group so I want you to see on the road to the Raptor and the Resurrection The Bride will almost be running power will come the devil will be after but the devil doesn't know who's in The Bride because brother bham taught us well he told us when the Dynamics stri when the spirit Falls are going to bring up false anointed that's right so he say signs and wonders will not be the evidence of who's in The Bride the only evidence of the Bride is the rapture it so understand the picture with the kangali Believers would be there all over the message Hallelujah and the devil will just be waiting my God and the bride will go and the devil will come after the remnant those who were there listen to the message and they fail to apply the token something else was more important when Moses said kill a lamb put Blood on the door they had something else to do that they thought was more important Hallelujah and this morning the CES the same cry that brother had in brother Bram had in 1963 don't fail Church apply the token because judgment is hanging over the church judgment is hanging over the world because the times of the Gentiles is about over hallelujah amen praise God without it all your believing is in vain that's right see you live a good life you listen to Listen to The Prophet you listen to what the word says you go go to church you try to live right that's fine but that's not it when I see the blood that's the token hallah don't come this far and say I believe the message you obey the messenger come into Christ well I believe every word said brother the random that's good but that's just being able to read that's just being able to hear that's just being able to be here in this service and not in a Pentecostal church or a Baptist Church but that's not good enough take the message Hallelujah take the message this morning take it into your heart that you must have the token the very life that was in Christ be in you and when I see that I'll pass over you I pray that this morning if you came in here with condemnation that you could put it under the blood amen and begin to cry out for the fire yes cry out for the Holy Ghost whatever your past your situation what you feel and fell that's what the blood is here for to put it under there and now the blood is covering that take that away now you can go and cry out for the Holy Ghost can the church say Amen so my desire My Prayer Young Brother young sister mother father neighbor friend visitor is that you come through the blood today with a clean heartall with a pure heart with a consecrated heart and you could now approach boldly the Throne of God and say Lord I've been in church a long time I've been in the message a long time and this holy ghost thing that I've keep hearing about I need it for myself I don't want to sleep without the Holy Ghost I don't want to live without the Holy Ghost I can't go back home without the Holy Ghost but I need the Holy Ghost I need amen an experience with God can the church say Amen in the message of token brother brandom said to the world it's a bunch of foolishness Hallelujah but to God is the only way the only thing that he requires is that token it must be there and you cannot have the token until the fair is paid then you are a possessor of the token butam said no matter how righteous it was but Isaac why you kneeling his down but we we know this but are you desperate for the token are you desperate for change are you desperate to get out of here or why you so caught up and building your kingdom and Earth that you miss the whole purpose that you are here brother BR said there will be people who will be in the message that would miss the whole thing he said all your believing is in vain what's the sense you believe all this years and you have no evidence Oh Praise Lord but brother Bram said you cannot get desperate until God speaks to you Hallelujah so I pray that this morning God would speak to your heart and bring you into desperation that if you need to repent and bring something under the blood you repent today you need to make something right with somebody you make it right today you need to tell somebody I forgive you today if you know you have not been living right today Hallelujah because the sealing Angel is moving through the camp looking to put a mark upon all those that sigh and cry for the abomination in the city you know what that means when you sigh and cry for the Abomination it means the stuff that's happening in the world supposed to disturb you amen supposed to negatively affect you understand what I mean we have become so insensitive to what's going on somebody dies okay somebody dies something happens it's just another news item but put a mark upon those who sigh and cry for the Abomination because death is not God's plan for people to be killing one another sickness is not God's plan for people to be sick so you are sighing and you're crying because sin has taken hold of your house you are sighing and crying because your prayer life is not an order you are sighing and crying because you are under spiritual attack you are sighing and crying you're not satisfying to just be in the message you are sighing and crying because you want to make things right you are sighing and crying because everywhere you look you see the enemy at work you are sing and crying because you need a Revival you are sing and crying because you need restoration you are sing and crying because you know you're not where it's supposed to be you're sing and crying because you know your house needs an experience with [Applause] God can the church say Amen the blood amen was the token or an identification the blood identified that the worshipper had slain the lamb accepted the lamb and applied a token to himself Hallelujah that he was not ashamed I want to say that again he was not ashamed amen he was not ashamed amen amen he was not ashamed to display the token he didn't care who saw it this is the prophet he didn't care what people said in fact this listen to the prophet he wanted everybody to see it he want everybody to know that the token is applied Hallelujah Glory young people stop hiding your testimony in your schools stop hiding your testimony in your jobsall because when you hide your testimony the devil has a room to get at you but when you display the token now you have something to defend you have a testimony to because you don't want to bring a reproach to Christ Hallelujah when you say you are a Christian that's supposed to mean something Hallelujah many people say they're a Christian when the life you live you know they're not a Christian but when you say that you are Christian you have to live something speak a certain way talk a certain way act a certain way live a certain way can the church say Amen but the B said Christianity has to display its token see publicly in public life at the office on the street when trouble is around anything in church everywhere else the blood is the token and the token must be applied see or the Covenant is not in effect can the church say Amen I'm not going to be too much longer with you the musicians can get ready Hallelujah butam said I told you last Sunday I had something I want to talk to you about he said this is it we love you the time when you just can't play with it it's got to be done if it's ever going to be done is got to be done now amen because we can see that the Wrath is about ready to pass through the land and everything from under that token will perish yes L can the church say Amen Hallelujah the said therefore as the evening Shadows are appearing and the Wrath is ready to be poured out from on high upon the ungodly Nations Hallelujah and upon the ungodly unbelievers upon the professors without a possession those who just talk about it upon these things and I've tried to unfold myself and live right among it to see where it was standing Hallelujah before I said these things now we are living in the shadows and the Wrath is ready to strike and God is requiring a token that you yourself have received his token the Holy Ghost it's the only way the only sign that God will ever pass because it is the literal life of Jesus Christ we turn back amen into the believer can the church say Amen brother Brown said in the same message the Holy Ghost is our identification amen it is what identifies us as Christians not our membership in churches not our understanding of the Bible not how much you know about the Bible it's how much you know about the author how much the author is living in you it's yourself gone you are no more you reckon yourself dead and the token is what lives in youu it's not your life it's him Paul said the life I know live he lived a different life from the one he had before it's not me it's Christ Living in me is that your prayer this morning you want his life living in you oh what a positive token can the church say Amen brother abam said Israel was commanded to stay under that blood until marching orders come don't go out from under it when Once under that token you were sealed in there don't leave that they stayed right there until the midnight struck and the trumpets blowed and when the trumpets blow the old ram horn begin to blow each one marched out go into the promised land so does a man or woman who is filled with the Holy Ghost he is sealed away and secured from all harm and danger his whole life displays what he is wherever he walk talks whatever business he does whoever he talks to friends this is real now this is not Sunday church I'm talking about listen carefully his whole life if your whole life is not displaying this you need an appointment with the altar Hallelujah you need an experience with God his whole life displays what he is wherever he walks whatever business he does whoever he talks with when he comes in contact with women when he comes in contact with Associates when he comes in contact with everything the token is laying there amen not compromising not playing games Hallelujah can the church say Amen remember brother Bram said if the token was not displayed the Covenant was ened that's right that's right but saying there might be many Jews who could say come here I ain't got no blood at my door but I want to show you something I'm a circumcised Jew but the BAM said that don't mean that you might say I'm Baptist I'm Presbyterian I'm in the message doesn't mean that when I see the token you see I'm a Believer my mother is a member of the church my daddy is a member of the church I've been a member since I was a child that don't mean that I don't lie I don't steal I don't do this that don't mean that I belong to brandham Tabernacle I do this that I believe all the word but the said I don't care what you are without that Covenant the wrath of God is upon you and that's what we need friends because only the truth will set you free we could have a service and make you feel all wonderful but the wrath of God is upon you unless you display the token how desperate must we be how sincere must we be how honest must we be honest even now to say Lord I have not been living right but I want to make it right because I cannot live without the token amen amen hallelujah brother bam said see that's right it's caught up with you amen your sins will find you out what is in unbelief you have disbelieved the message you have disbelieved the word you have disbelieved a witness of the token when it's identified itself in the midst of us he said have you been disbelieved that no matter how much it's got to be applied you might say I believe it I believe it I believe it's the truth I accept it as a truth then that's all good but yet it's got to be applied amen amen that's why my inspiration this morning but the night say apply the token yes apply it to your house apply it to your family apply it Hallelujah Glory Glory praise God thank you hallelujah amen hallelujah Glory Hallelujah G GL thank you Jesus God then brother ROM goes even deeper he said I don't care you might have cast out Devils you might have healed the Sick by your prayer of Fate you might have done all these things but if that token is not there you under the wrath of God that's right you might be a believer you might stand in the pulpit and preach the gospel many will come to me in that day and say Lord Lord have I not prophesied in your name preach in your name have not I cast out devils in your name Jesus said depart from me you workers of iniquity I never even knew you it's a scary time friends a scary moment friends but when I see the token I'll pass over you it's God's requirement of the hour the evening time message is to apply the token the whole purpose of brother brandom came and tie up the Loose Ends and to point it to the Rapture is for you to apply the token because what good is it to tie Loose Ends point to the Rapture and there's no way for you to get there the only way for you to get there is through the blood apply the token hallelujah hallelujah brother brand said Satan has thr us all kinds of counterfeits Hallelujah and that's why he said unto tonight take heed that no man deceive you nobody is comfortable this morning because God does never say you have arrived amen and your only certificate of achievement is the adoption ceremony when God can say this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased hear he him that's your adoption ceremony that's your confirmation ceremony that's when you know your ticket your passport is set Pillar of Fire dwelling in the hearts of your adopted sons friends we have to grow up this morning we have to make our young brother young sister flirting with the world playing games with the boys and the girls in the school you know it's wrong get right with God if you are living unclean this morning get right with God if you know you have not been living right get right with God I don't care Minister Elder Deacon trustee whatever it is get right with God because judgment is beginning in the house of God brother Isaac preach me happy say something to lift me up you are promised the Holy Ghost that's as happy as you're going to get you have promised Deliverance you have promised a breakthrough God promised you a land you have got to clean it up you have got to get desperate you have got to get consecrated there has to be a desire in Your Heart Lord I don't want to be this way anymore I don't want to play games anymore as for me and my house we will serve the Lord hallelujah I'm almost done Satan has Str all kind of counterfeits of shaking hands and evidences and everything like that forget it the hour has arrived Hallelujah that the token itself not some counterfeit make believe substitution the token itself is behavior it's conduct it's how you act the hour is here when the token himself is identifying himself right Among Us and proving that he's the same Jesus yesterday today and forever Hallelujah doesn't matter what you are how good you are how many times you jumped up and down I'm still reading the prophets words how many churches you've joined how many good things you've done it won't mean one thing to you if the token isn't apply this is the evening time that worked all right in the days of Luther it worked all right in the days of Wesley but it wouldn't work now would not work now but the B said the Jew could show that he's a Believer but he has to have the token but the brandham said the theme of every Apostle has been have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe you could begin to play something softly hallelujah thank you Jesus from the message leadership brother Ram said now look at yourself don't look at anybody else don't look at who's next to you who's at the side of you this is between you and God right now pleas something softly amen amen look at yourself really are you a genuine Bible Christian Hallelujah full of love of of God remember the Bible said in the last days when this time takes place he said a marking Angel went through the churches went through the cities and sealed only those who sighed and cried for the Abomination that was done in the city is that right Ezekiel 9 we know that's truth the mark and Angel went forth and put a mark on their head forehead seal them them that cried and S and after that come the slaughtering angels from the four corners of the earth which is coming right away we see it coming Wars moving right that will kill the whole earth Hallelujah there's nothing that they couldn't touch but them that had to Mark I wonder this morning if the cealing angel would move through this church today I wonder how many would be marked I wonder how many this morning are sighing and crying looking for the Holy Ghost friends you can't blame anybody you've got to get the token you've got to get into rapturing condition the Rapture is for individuals friends not a group not the church not you could have knowledge and miss the Rapture you could speak in tongues and miss the Rapture that's right you could feed the poor and miss the Rapture amen you could give your body to be burnt and miss the Rapture you could preach and miss the Rapture you could prophesy and miss the Rapture but you must have the token charity the Dynamics the life to make it into the r hallelujah hallelujah my last quote from a message God doesn't call man to judgment without first warning him and but the brandom is praying and this is my prayer for the church this morning I pray God that tonight and I say I pray God that today if there be some here who doesn't know you who's never made their peace and maybe today while we've been speaking a little voice has been speaking down in their heart Hallelujah I feel a warning that I can't be around much longer oh God may they put their house in order right now may everything be set maybe the call is maybe they're Christian but they just haven't they've lived under they so long and seen so many things that they have lost the value of it the things that they take it lightly instead of real deeply and sincerely oh God let us check up tonight granted knowing that these things are only warning us of the soon rapturing Church Hallelujah and if we are Laden with sin with unbelief and with forness we shall not make that rapture we know it Lord so we pray that you'll
