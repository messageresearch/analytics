[39:22] word I have no small talk you a come
[39:24] here to hear from me they come here to
[39:26] hear from God okay
[39:29] Isaiah 58 1 verse
[39:32] verse2 Zechariah 41-6 and Luke 4 1-4 and
[39:36] 13- 14 we want to read these scriptures
[39:39] this morning Isaiah vers
[39:42] :12 and they that shall be of thee shall
[39:47] build the old wayte
[39:49] places Thou shalt raise up the
[39:51] foundations of many
[39:53] generations Thou shalt be called the
[39:56] repairer of the
[39:58] breach the restorer of parts to dwell
[40:03] in Zechariah Chapter 4 reading verse one
[40:07] and the angel that talk with me came
[40:09] again and wed wake me as a man that is
[40:11] waken out of his sleep and said unto me
[40:14] what seest thou and I said I have looked
[40:17] and behold a Candlestick all of gold
[40:19] with a bowl upon the top of it and there
[40:21] seven lamps there on and seven pipes to
[40:24] the seven lamps
[40:27] and which are upon the top there on and
[40:29] two all of trees by it one upon the
[40:31] right side of the bowl and the other
[40:33] upon the left side thereof so I answered
[40:35] and spake to the angel that talked with
[40:37] me saying what are these my Lord then
[40:40] the angel that talk with me answered and
[40:43] said unto me knowest thou not what these
[40:45] be I said no my Lord then he answered
[40:48] and spake unto me saying this is the
[40:50] word of the Lord under zeruel saying not
[40:53] by might nor by power
[40:57] but by my spirit sayth the Lord of hosts
[41:01] all last scripture is from Luke chapter
[41:03] 4 reading verse 1 to 4 and then read 13
[41:06] and
[41:08] 14 and Jesus being full of the Holy
[41:11] Ghost returned from Jordan and was led
[41:15] by the spirit Into the Wilderness being
[41:19] 40 days tempted of the devil and in
[41:23] those days he did eat nothing and when
[41:26] they were ended he afterward hunger the
[41:30] devil said unto him if thou be the Son
[41:32] of God command this stone that it be
[41:36] made bread and Jesus answered him saying
[41:38] it is written that man shall live bread
[41:40] alone but by every word of God for time
[41:43] I'll just go down to 13 and 14 but we
[41:44] know the other scripture in between we
[41:46] strike it verse 13 and when the devil
[41:49] had ended all the
[41:51] Temptation he departed from him for a
[41:53] season and Jesus
[41:56] returned in the power of the spirit unto
[41:59] Galilee and there went out a Fame of him
[42:03] throughout all the region round about
[42:06] let's pray father we thank you for your
[42:07] word we thank you for your people here
[42:09] and every need here may be met every
[42:11] sick person here may they be healed any
[42:14] bound person here may they be set free
[42:16] every sinner here may they be saved and
[42:18] any backsliders here may they be
[42:19] restored in Jesus name I ask it amen you
[42:22] may be seated oh praise God praise God
[42:26] Oh Glory to God this is the place to
[42:28] shout we do go Carnival and B and fet
[42:31] and thing this the place we just shout
[42:32] and jump and praise and worship god oh
[42:35] glory to God hallelujah hallelujah
[42:38] hallelujah glory to God so after Jesus
[42:43] answered the devil it is
[42:45] written man shall not live by bread
[42:48] alone but by every
[42:50] word of God praise God so Jesus overcome
[42:54] the Devil by the word so if you're don't
[42:56] know the word how you overcome if you're
[42:58] not interested in the word how you
[42:59] overcome if you're not conscious of what
[43:01] the word is how you going to overcome
[43:03] you have to get the word to deal with
[43:04] the Devil by the word because Jesus did
[43:07] not overcome the Devil by anything else
[43:08] but the word he said it is written it is
[43:11] written it is written so the devil
[43:13] didn't know who he was because he was
[43:14] telling the devil go read it oh praise
[43:16] the name of the god go and see for
[43:18] yourself so when the devil realized
[43:20] Jesus was getting on in the word the
[43:22] devil take him to a high mountain this
[43:23] is verse 5 showed him all the Kingdom of
[43:26] the world in a moment of time so you can
[43:28] see the devil have a real nice curved
[43:30] big screen all them big big screen TV
[43:32] screen a nice Curve screen to show him
[43:35] in a moment of time he said all these
[43:37] kingdoms of the all the kingdoms of the
[43:39] world and the devil said unto him all
[43:42] this power will I give thee and the
[43:45] glory of them for that is delivered unto
[43:47] me to whomsoever I will give it if thou
[43:49] Willl worship me and all shall be dine
[43:52] in other words he's telling Jesus don't
[43:54] go to Calvary you don't have to die you
[43:56] don't have to pay a price I going be the
[43:58] director and you will be the manager
[44:00] praise God had to go to no trial no
[44:02] testing and then all his Minds right and
[44:07] Jesus answer said unto him get thee
[44:09] behind me Satan for it is written thou
[44:12] shall Worship the Lord thy God and him
[44:14] only shall thou serve so he straighten
[44:17] out the devil and tell the devil where
[44:19] to get off there right it is written so
[44:22] watch this now and he brought him to the
[44:25] Jerusalem set him on the Pinnacle of the
[44:26] temple and said unto him if thou be the
[44:29] Son of God cast thyself down from Den
[44:32] for it is written devil start to quot
[44:34] now he a foolish you know not no stupid
[44:36] devil you know he's to read the word you
[44:38] know so he want to get Jesus now to be
[44:40] popular to play himself to parade his
[44:43] beef and Jesus was in none of that are
[44:46] you getting me now for it is written he
[44:48] shall give his angels charge over thee
[44:50] to keep thee and in their hands they
[44:52] shall bear thee up least at any time
[44:54] that Dash thy foot against a stone word
[44:56] by word the devil quoting word by word
[44:58] he is quoting to Jesus and Jesus said
[45:01] praise God and it is said Thou shalt not
[45:05] tempt the Lord thy God oh glory to God
[45:08] and when he ended all the Temptations He
[45:10] departed for a season and Jesus returned
[45:12] in the power of the spirit so here it is
[45:14] Jesus he just got filled with the Holy
[45:16] Ghost John the Baptist baptize him he
[45:18] got filled with the Holy Ghost and this
[45:19] Holy Ghost he got filled with led him
[45:21] into the Wilderness the spirit is on him
[45:24] isn't that right and when the spirit
[45:25] when he hit the Wilderness here the
[45:27] spirit turned to word it is written it
[45:30] is written it is written it is written
[45:33] he's traveling it is written the spirit
[45:35] it is written and when he come out
[45:38] in out of the Wilderness the Spirit come
[45:40] back upon him and return in the power of
[45:42] the spirit praise God to go and face
[45:45] them Pharisees and scribes and Sadducees
[45:48] Oh Glory to God and then the spirit led
[45:50] him to the book of the prophet Isaiah
[45:52] and then J begin to read the spirit of
[45:54] God is upon me he's quoting the script
[45:55] scriptures for he had anointed me to
[45:58] bring Good Tidings to Open the Eyes of
[45:59] the Blind and to make the crippled walk
[46:02] and the deaf to hear and the D to speak

[1:00:03] message go the testimony of Jesus is the
[1:00:06] spirit of Prophecy you have to hear that
[1:00:08] you must hear that you're member of this
[1:00:09] church you need to listen to that
[1:00:12] message I'm going to start here for this
[1:00:14] message this morning we leave off from
[1:00:16] Wednesday night you said here now in the
[1:00:19] beginning was the word in John one the
[1:00:22] word was with God and the Word was God
[1:00:24] and the word became flesh and dwell
[1:00:26] Among Us now before a word it's a
[1:00:30] thought a thought has to be created so
[1:00:34] God thoughts became become creation when
[1:00:37] it's spoke by a word that is when he
[1:00:40] presents it to you as a thought his
[1:00:43] thoughts it's revealed to you then it's
[1:00:46] still a thought until you speak it you
[1:00:49] have to speak it so when
[1:00:52] Isaiah heard God thoughts of virgin
[1:00:54] shall conceive if he had let the torch
[1:00:57] hang in his head he was going to pause
[1:00:59] and say but that can't happen you know I
[1:01:03] mean logic doesn't allow that to happen
[1:01:05] a virgin can conceive but the thought
[1:01:07] came from God into his heart is still a
[1:01:11] thought until he speaks it so he spoke
[1:01:14] it a virgin shall conceive and be a son
[1:01:18] then shall be called wonderful counselor
[1:01:19] because Jesus had to come outside of
[1:01:22] this sex thing outside of this Fallen
[1:01:24] thing
[1:01:24] that's why a virgin had to conceive
[1:01:26] Jesus God had to create egg and sperm to
[1:01:28] make Jesus what he was he was God he was
[1:01:30] the word made flesh because he had to
[1:01:32] come outside of this perverted blood
[1:01:34] that we have right now he was the blood
[1:01:37] of God oh that's why this from his blood
[1:01:39] come his Spirit life could come back
[1:01:41] upon us oh give the Lord some Praises Oh
[1:01:43] Glory we we couldn't take the life on of
[1:01:45] another human being we had to get a
[1:01:46] different human being all together which
[1:01:48] is Christ Jesus so he came in the blood
[1:01:50] of God if Satan only knew what blood he
[1:01:52] had he never let him die a Calvary Let
[1:01:55] Jesus died of old age but when he died
[1:01:57] and the blood was shed his Spirit was
[1:01:59] released and that's why we here this
[1:02:00] morning because his Spirit has be
[1:02:02] released Oh Glory to God to pull us to
[1:02:07] him you be seated remember this you
[1:02:09] couldn't come if your trying know he
[1:02:11] said no man could come except the father
[1:02:13] draw him so you can't come on your own
[1:02:16] the spirit itself have to come upon you
[1:02:18] to give you a desire oh give the Lord
[1:02:19] some Praises some people don't have the
[1:02:22] desire but you have the desire God put
[1:02:24] that desire in you that was desire when
[1:02:27] you was smoking when you was drinking
[1:02:28] when you was partying that desire God

[1:02:56] time so watch so we must speak first by
[1:03:00] Revelation all the promise revealed by
[1:03:03] the son of man through the prophet of
[1:03:04] Malachi
[1:03:05] 4 every word in the Bible is God
[1:03:08] thoughts laying in seed form and when
[1:03:11] Jesus the first Parable Jesus give was
[1:03:13] what the SE and the seed some fell among
[1:03:16] Sony ground rocks and everything else
[1:03:18] and then he say if you don't if you
[1:03:20] don't understand this Parable you
[1:03:21] understand no Parables because it's the
[1:03:22] key is that right the key is the seed

[1:03:31] create sir so God's that's why he said
[1:03:33] my word shall not return to me void his
[1:03:36] word must be expressed that's why he
[1:03:38] could say we were with him before the
[1:03:41] foundation of the world because the
[1:03:42] world came in the beginning but before
[1:03:45] the beginning Oh Glory in the beginning

[1:04:01] word the logos so you were like a seed
[1:04:03] in
[1:04:05] Christ and God sent it to your natural
[1:04:07] mother and father but and you had a germ
[1:04:09] a gene a seed that only the word could

[1:08:04] Malachi 4 William brandham had to anoint
[1:08:06] every bride promised seed from Genesis
[1:08:08] to Revelation and presented to the
[1:08:11] bride
[1:08:13] oh
[1:08:15] okay so I you have 14 pages related this
[1:08:18] morning are still at page one but we
[1:08:22] just on page one now watch here
[1:08:26] this in the beginning was the word that
[1:08:29] as far as we could go by theology now he
[1:08:31] said first he thought he spoke the word
[1:08:35] and the Word was made manifest how
[1:08:37] infallible God is this the word made
[1:08:39] flesh in the report and Jesus no wonder
[1:08:42] when he come up the hill there was no
[1:08:44] food on the tree he said no man eat from
[1:08:46] thee and he walk away the next day
[1:08:49] coming back the tree had
[1:08:50] withered God's mind was a thought before
[1:08:54] it was a word that expressed Jesus
[1:08:57] Christ the same one was expressing that
[1:08:59] word back again and every word there a
[1:09:02] quote now in the Bible is God's thought
[1:09:06] laid in seed form and if receive into
[1:09:11] the human being and spoke by the same
[1:09:15] thought that materialized the Bible it
[1:09:17] brings the things to pass see what I
[1:09:21] mean how powerful could be could the
[1:09:24] church
[1:09:25] be listen say it
[1:09:28] again all of God thoughts in the Bible
[1:09:31] is God's word in seed form if received
[1:09:34] in the human being and spoke by the same
[1:09:37] thought that materialize the Bible
[1:09:39] remember Moses didn't have the blood of
[1:09:40] Jesus know Moses was under the Bloods of
[1:09:43] bulls and goats and he spoke for
[1:09:47] flies you are more anointing on on you
[1:09:50] than Moses you know in that sense you
[1:09:52] because you are the under the blood of
[1:09:54] Jesus you know the blood of Jesus takes
[1:09:57] away your sin as if you never did it you
[1:09:59] know Moses was being covered by Bloods
[1:10:03] of B by the blood of bulls and goats and
[1:10:05] yet he spoke for
[1:10:08] flies under the anointing Samson take a
[1:10:11] little old Ox gold um bone and beat down
[1:10:14] a thousand Philistines with steel helmet
[1:10:18] yes because he knew he was called for a
[1:10:20] purpose and the devil can't defeat him
[1:10:23] and the Philistines can't defeat him
[1:10:25] nothing could defeat him and even though
[1:10:27] he have a old bone it could be anointed
[1:10:30] and God could use anything oh give God
[1:10:33] could use you a old bone oh give the
[1:10:36] Lord some Praises Oh Glory to God
[1:10:39] hallelujah don't tell me
[1:10:41] [Applause]
[1:10:46] you now listen hold the Propet getting
[1:10:48] deeper here now the Bible said see okay
[1:10:53] let this
[1:10:54] mind that was in Christ be in you now as
[1:10:59] a man thinking in his heart so is he or
[1:11:02] so he is so if you think he will fail
[1:11:05] you can't pass
[1:11:06] him like a man speak for the mountain
[1:11:08] and said just as I thought it's still
[1:11:11] there he speak for it to move but he he
[1:11:13] believe in his heart sometime we speak
[1:11:16] things but we don't believe it in our
[1:11:17] heart we speak it because it's a head
[1:11:19] thing know it's right but it's not from
[1:11:20] the heart so you see you could tell
[1:11:22] somebody forgive but not from the heart
[1:11:25] you speak it because you know supposed

[1:15:26] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[1:15:28] what you say will come to pass you can
[1:15:30] have whatever thou
[1:15:33] sayest you shall have it not me you
[1:15:36] shall have it what power has been given
[1:15:39] to the
[1:15:41] church now you can express it by a
[1:15:44] mental conception but if it becomes real
[1:15:47] a real revelation of God you see it
[1:15:52] before it happen
[1:15:54] and express it in word form that's what
[1:15:57] a real Revelation does a real Revelation
[1:16:00] Mak you see it before it happens and
[1:16:02] then express it so when God called
[1:16:05] Abraham an old man his wife is old 60
[1:16:08] 6575 she's past child bearing age and
[1:16:11] God revealed to Abraham not to Sarah to
[1:16:14] Abraham you have a son because it was
[1:16:16] revealed to him because as real to him
[1:16:19] he could express we going to have a son
[1:16:22] now she could question and query because
[1:16:24] she didn't get the Revelation but he had
[1:16:26] it and because he had it he could
[1:16:28] express it he could go to the doctor and
[1:16:30] say check me up the duck doctor say
[1:16:32] you're still old your wife's still old
[1:16:35] you still have a son after 15 years give
[1:16:37] me a check up dock doctor stop wasting
[1:16:39] at time I'm not even taking your money
[1:16:41] go back home but that to do with Abraham
[1:16:44] Abraham still checking cuz you're
[1:16:45] working the faith now then Abram has
[1:16:47] somebody making booties and making crib
[1:16:49] and he he nuts now he gone he gone he
[1:16:52] going clear after 25 years don't come an
[1:16:56] angel don't come a man walking to
[1:16:59] Abraham and tell him I will return unto
[1:17:01] thee according to the time of life in
[1:17:04] other words Sarah will go into a monthly
[1:17:06] cycle again next 28 days I'm going to
[1:17:09] return un the according to the time of
[1:17:11] life and Sarah going to have a son what
[1:17:14] happened what happened is not a man
[1:17:16] coming next 28 days woo a spirit coming
[1:17:20] next 28 days Oh Glory to God so Abraham
[1:17:24] was transformed in his body by Spirit
[1:17:26] Sarah was transformed in her body by
[1:17:29] Spirit when Abraham looked in the mirror
[1:17:31] who's that young man standing there oh
[1:17:33] glory to God Sarah Sarah was so
[1:17:35] beautiful that some old Pharaoh General
[1:17:37] wanted to take out of wife oh give the
[1:17:39] Lord some Praises was no old woman you
[1:17:41] know he fancy Sarah and God shut up
[1:17:44] every woman in the house and said
[1:17:45] restore unto my Prophet his wife he said
[1:17:48] but he man tell me the sister he said I
[1:17:49] know that but I tell you that let him
[1:17:51] pray for you oh give the the Lord some
[1:17:53] Praises don't mess with my servants
[1:17:55] don't mess with my sons oh give the Lord
[1:17:57] some Praises oh
[1:18:02] Hallelujah spirit so after Elohim visits
[1:18:06] to give a reminder or an assurance or a
[1:18:11] consolation that is not too far off
[1:18:14] Spirit have to come now to make that
[1:18:17] amen that that breakthrough so watch
[1:18:19] something me you can express it by a
[1:18:21] mental conception but if it's become
[1:18:23] real revelation of God you see it before
[1:18:26] it happened and express it in word form
[1:18:30] so when you express it in word form what
[1:18:31] that gives you the testimony of Jesus
[1:18:34] which is the spirit of Prophecy because
[1:18:36] it's a revelation that's been bued into
[1:18:38] you so even though your husband don't
[1:18:41] understand it like the woman in blood
[1:18:42] issue her husband tell her leave that
[1:18:44] small Church alone what she going to
[1:18:45] that church for now she pay she doctor
[1:18:47] doctor say come next time come and he
[1:18:49] come and he like that because he get
[1:18:50] money every time he go but he not
[1:18:52] helping her her money ran out and her
[1:18:54] husband was no encouragement so she told
[1:18:56] herself sometimes when you see people
[1:18:58] there telling you the right thing you to
[1:18:59] talk to yourself you know sometimes
[1:19:01] they're jealous they're lying they don't
[1:19:03] want you to prosper they don't want to
[1:19:04] break you they don't want you to be he
[1:19:05] they don't want the best for you and she
[1:19:07] told herself if I could just touch the H
[1:19:09] of his G I been made whole and when she
[1:19:12] come out brother Lyndon is because there
[1:19:14] people crowd Around Jesus so she had to
[1:19:15] push scroll through the leg big hardback
[1:19:17] men tall men fat men strong men and she
[1:19:20] say excuse me and you know what I mean
[1:19:22] we dramatize it me throw a hand back
[1:19:23] there and say hand back there you know I
[1:19:25] mean all she want to do is get to Jesus
[1:19:26] hallelujah oh glory to God and she don't
[1:19:28] want to touch him Is His Garment you
[1:19:30] want to touch that's the Garment so she
[1:19:32] had Faith to pull virtue through him let
[1:19:34] through the Garment and receive it when
[1:19:36] she touched the Garment oh God she was
[1:19:38] healed right away Jesus said who touched
[1:19:40] my clothes somebody touched me he said
[1:19:43] everybody touching he said no no no no
[1:19:44] no something different something
[1:19:45] different he saw the woman he said thy
[1:19:47] faith he didn't say his power he said
[1:19:48] thy faith had made the whole not his
[1:19:50] power thy faith you have to have faith
[1:19:52] to draw the power oh give the Lord some
[1:19:54] Praises do you see why God sent a
[1:19:56] prophet to turn our hands back to the
[1:19:57] faith of the fathers because the faith
[1:19:59] going to draw the power you can't leave
[1:20:02] you the same way you came you have to
[1:20:04] leave you today different Oh Glory to
[1:20:07] God say Amen
[1:20:08] [Applause]
[1:20:10] somebody all right watch this
[1:20:14] now you see it before it happen and
[1:20:17] express it in word form and that word
[1:20:21] takes a whole
[1:20:23] and becomes material a thought expressed
[1:20:27] now watch if your heart and your mind is
[1:20:31] so infilled with God's spirit until your
[1:20:34] thoughts become his thoughts there you
[1:20:37] are when your mind you're leading you're
[1:20:41] guiding becomes a direct place or a
[1:20:44] direct inspiration of the holy spirit
[1:20:46] that moving in your mortal being what
[1:20:48] kind of people should we be if the very
[1:20:51] Holy Spirit has you so embol bodied or
[1:20:54] empowered that you don't use your
[1:20:56] thoughts you don't use your mind you
[1:20:58] don't use your own opinion but the Holy
[1:21:01] Spirit had you so built until your
[1:21:03] thoughts and your being is God Spirit
[1:21:07] expressing itself through you what kind
[1:21:10] of church would we
[1:21:12] be what kind of people would it be this
[1:21:14] morning if this brandom Tabernacle this
[1:21:16] morning was so filled with the presence
[1:21:17] of God why you didn't even use your own
[1:21:20] mind didn't even use your own thoughts
[1:21:22] didn't have no alternative of your own
[1:21:23] just to be led by the spirit and they
[1:21:25] that are sons of God are led by the
[1:21:28] spirit hear this part now when the human
[1:21:31] element goes
[1:21:33] out and the spirit of God fills that
[1:21:36] vacancy remember we talked sometime ago
[1:21:38] about the woman who was fooling around
[1:21:40] still in church and playing piano and
[1:21:42] whatnot and then she was in a dead bed
[1:21:44] preacher come to tell her well you know
[1:21:45] you're right with God and she said I a
[1:21:46] send for you picture come here go your
[1:21:48] way and whatnot when she begin to die
[1:21:51] her spirit start a breakup and the first
[1:21:54] thing is is the mind so that human
[1:21:56] spirit all the GC CXC doctor degree all
[1:21:59] your money car and where feeling who you
[1:22:01] think you are that's how to break up and
[1:22:03] her soul start to come up now then she
[1:22:05] start to SC I'm
[1:22:06] lost I'm lost you see all that assurance
[1:22:10] and all that thinking you're okay is at
[1:22:12] the head level but at death and dying
[1:22:14] that breaks up so you better be sure
[1:22:18] it's at the Heart level because that is
[1:22:20] where the soul is at oh give the Lord
[1:22:22] some Praises so he's talking about you
[1:22:24] now when the human element goes out and
[1:22:28] the spirit of God fills that vacancy
[1:22:31] when you empty
[1:22:33] yourself then will be when the church in
[1:22:37] its power of the resurrection of the
[1:22:38] Lord Jesus you he about Kangle when when
[1:22:41] when when you empty yourself out when
[1:22:44] the spirit of God fills its
[1:22:46] vacancy watch and you will walk in his
[1:22:50] steps talking about Jesus in his power
[1:22:53] in his thoughts in his being you see
[1:22:57] what I mean then your thoughts will
[1:22:58] become words and your words will become
[1:23:01] material let's take it to Peter now he's
[1:23:04] a fisherman Jesus tell him come
[1:23:07] following Jesus he a cuss fisherman does
[1:23:10] cuss and smoke and drink and thing so
[1:23:12] Peter is a normal human being Jesus give
[1:23:14] him an anointing to work with him for
[1:23:16] the ministry he's not yet converted
[1:23:18] isn't that right so crucifixion day now
[1:23:20] uh crucifixion day get some Any Time
[1:23:24] Peter deny Christ three times Co Crow
[1:23:25] Peter cry and everything else he tell
[1:23:27] Peter wait in the upper room until I get
[1:23:30] power from on high not books and tapes
[1:23:34] not reading Old Testament scripture he
[1:23:35] couldn't read and write power from on
[1:23:37] high when that power hit Peter so Peter
[1:23:40] Ste on and said these people are not
[1:23:42] drunk as you suppose because they were
[1:23:44] like drunk men in early in the morning
[1:23:46] how you drinking so early morning he
[1:23:47] said no not that kind of
[1:23:49] drinking he said this is that that the
[1:23:52] prophet V okay no problem Peter going
[1:23:55] out to the temple as usual is a big
[1:23:59] dear man Peter put his hand in his
[1:24:02] pocket and he recognized he have no
[1:24:03] money his
[1:24:06] first poor
[1:24:10] Apostle a man couldn't get a bottle of
[1:24:12] water he couldn't buy a bottle of water
[1:24:13] for any man he had no money whatsoever
[1:24:15] so then Peter said listen to what he
[1:24:17] said remember what we just read you're
[1:24:19] thinking you're leading he says silver
[1:24:21] and gold I don't have but what I
[1:24:25] have I give unto you no watch he didn't
[1:24:29] praying for know he said I give unto you
[1:24:32] what I have I have it and if I have it I
[1:24:36] can give it well the same thing with you
[1:24:40] god want to give you that you could give
[1:24:41] it so Peter said rise up and walk and he
[1:24:45] held a man in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:24:47] and the Man start to jump and shout and
[1:24:49] carry on that is what shook Jerusalem
[1:24:53] that is what rocked them not saying this
[1:24:56] is that the scripture and Joel no no no
[1:24:58] no no it's when the lame man walk
[1:24:59] because everybody knew he was that lay
[1:25:01] man in front of the temple everybody was
[1:25:04] giving him coins oh give the Lord a
[1:25:06] shout in the house but when they saw
[1:25:08] that man walk they know another powers
[1:25:10] in the land and Jesus was not there oh
[1:25:13] give the Lord a praise Oh Glory the god
[1:25:17] the Messiah was not around but this were
[1:25:19] Messiah this were little Messiah
[1:25:23] little ones on the
[1:25:25] earth God want to make you that God want
[1:25:28] to make you a witness God want to make
[1:25:30] you a messiah a small one a small
[1:25:32] version and then hear the prophecy now I
[1:25:36] believe it's on this road when the
[1:25:38] church will be so wrapped in Christ the
[1:25:42] Holy Spirit mankind so away from
[1:25:44] themselves they don't see themselves
[1:25:46] they don't have they don't have no
[1:25:48] thoughts but to serve God their thoughts
[1:25:50] move on they refuse to things of the
[1:25:52] world they just move in the spirit live
[1:25:55] in the spirit walk in the spirit to
[1:25:57] fulfill the law of Christ then the love
[1:26:00] of Christ in the human heart moving in
[1:26:02] the Holy Ghost oh I love that because
[1:26:06] you can have faith without love but this
[1:26:08] bright faith is Faith at work by love so
[1:26:10] love have to come oh glory to God in the
[1:26:12] human heart moving in the Holy Ghost
[1:26:15] this is divine love now oh glory to God
[1:26:18] hallelujah there's a love that conquered
[1:26:20] the bull conquered the Beast conquer

[1:31:39] unless his own seed is in that person
[1:31:41] that's
[1:31:44] right now remember what happened in
[1:31:46] Pentecostal right holy ghost fell on
[1:31:49] them gifted men some of them were one on
[1:31:51] one woman men because the rain of Fallen
[1:31:53] the just and unjust they didn't have the

[1:32:07] to L something toty to reveal seed that
[1:32:10] when you get the seed in you the secret

[1:52:03] see a
[1:52:05] trying my Lord on page
[1:52:09] four so the Bible is manifested again
[1:52:12] like in the early days of Christ cause
[1:52:16] and there's a quote we emphasize
[1:52:17] sometime in the past you are
[1:52:20] a predestinated seed just like Christ
[1:52:23] was and when the rain falls on the seed
[1:52:29] the life produces itself when the Holy
[1:52:33] Spirit Falls so don't be frustrated
[1:52:36] because you're still waiting for this
[1:52:38] rain he's talking about here this is
[1:52:40] what he promised you use what you have
[1:52:43] in the measure that God give it to you
[1:52:45] while you're expecting this rain because
[1:52:48] Abraham had Faith to believe God and
[1:52:50] walk a faithful life until he got the
[1:52:53] confirmation so right now you walk a
[1:52:55] walk of Faith because you know God going
[1:52:58] to confirm your faith by the Holy Ghost
[1:53:00] upon your life now you know need this
[1:53:02] Holy Ghost more than you think because
[1:53:04] you have to apply it to your family and
[1:53:05] to your children they can't apply it you
[1:53:07] have to apply it for them you have to
[1:53:08] believe for them oh give the Lord a
[1:53:10] shout in the house so if you think you
[1:53:13] have no work to do your walk about to
[1:53:14] get started Oh Glory to God hallelujah
[1:53:17] praise God who going to apply for your
[1:53:19] children you're 6y old 5y old 10y old
[1:53:22] who going to apply for them you have to
[1:53:24] you have to stand in the Gap glory to
[1:53:26] God when when that that angel was
[1:53:28] passing and you're hearing screams of
[1:53:30] death down the street and coming Closer
[1:53:32] Closer Closer I can hear a six-year-old
[1:53:34] a seveny old asking Daddy Daddy are you
[1:53:36] sure that that that angel not going to
[1:53:37] catch us in this house he said son I am
[1:53:39] sure because the blood is on the
[1:53:41] doorpost the blood is on the lintel and
[1:53:43] Moses said when I see the blood I'm
[1:53:45] going to pass over you and I know that
[1:53:48] God going to see that blood because that
[1:53:50] blood the token was on display oh God
[1:53:53] somebody had to put it up there oh give
[1:53:54] the Lord a shout in the house come on
[1:53:57] you sons of
[1:54:00] God come on you
[1:54:03] fathers somebody got to put it up there
[1:54:06] glory to God I expect the woman to come
[1:54:09] there and put blood and whatnot is the
[1:54:11] man had to do that and the man is under
[1:54:13] attack that's why pornography is to
[1:54:15] attack the man Hallelujah everything is
[1:54:18] to attack the man the throw down God's
[1:54:20] man Hallelujah and you have to fight
[1:54:23] right back filth is to take throw down
[1:54:25] the man that's why the family has been
[1:54:29] wrecked man being stripp of the manhood
[1:54:32] in this present society and we have to
[1:54:34] fight that back because God said I find
[1:54:37] a man I found a man a better man oh
[1:54:40] glory to God God always looking for a
[1:54:41] better man you don't just want to be a

[1:57:04] way how to say
[1:57:07] it because these attributes was in him
[1:57:10] to be a father with no children to be a
[1:57:13] savior nobody lost it was a certain way
[1:57:16] in that being called Elohim that was
[1:57:18] before the beginning that was before the
[1:57:20] word so he wanted to be God and he
[1:57:23] created angels angels worship him God is
[1:57:26] the object of worship that made him God
[1:57:28] he wanted to be a father he wanted to be

[1:57:38] beasts and bears and dinosaurs and
[1:57:40] everything else but there was no man to
[1:57:42] represent God so he made a spirit man
[1:57:44] Adam was a spirit man in Genesis 1 then
[1:57:46] he make a dust man out of the earth and
[1:57:49] put that Spirit man in the dust man and
[1:57:51] Man became a living Soul Eve was locked
[1:57:53] up in that man because Eve was part of
[1:57:55] Adam in spirit form but is was in one
[1:57:57] body called Adam Oh Glory to God and
[1:58:00] Adam was learning the word and learning
[1:58:01] to work work and word not woman yet work
[1:58:04] and word and then after Adam was working
[1:58:07] after Adam had the word he put Adam to
[1:58:09] sleep he said not good for man to dwell
[1:58:10] alone he pull out Eve a wife she was a
[1:58:12] byproduct of the original Adam was

[1:59:12] can't manufacture adoption manufacture
[1:59:14] fivefold manufacture this and

[1:59:48] don't know interpret that
[1:59:52] that when we see the Life of Christ
[1:59:54] lived out that's a different thing when
[1:59:58] you see you encounter your enemies and
[1:59:59] you could treat them as if they're a
[2:00:01] friend you know Jesus them disciples
[2:00:03] didn't know Judas was the
[2:00:05] devil when Jesus tell them go and what
[2:00:07] th do is do quickly they thought he went

[2:00:19] such a way he couldn't separate his
[2:00:20] friends from his
[2:00:21] enemies I want
[2:00:24] that because you see at the subconscious
[2:00:27] level if you don't have it right when
[2:00:28] the enemy
[2:00:30] come eyebrow
[2:00:32] twist your mouth shift and
[2:00:37] because God
[2:00:40] bless that's a performance that's a God

[2:00:44] real thing that husband calling and like
[2:00:46] that and knock door Hallelujah Glory
[2:00:47] Hallelujah God bless he just calling
[2:00:51] right see but it have to be the writing
[2:00:56] constantly you choose right right is not
[2:00:58] easy but you choose it there's no right
[2:01:01] way to do the wrong
[2:01:04] thing let me say it again there's no
[2:01:06] right way to do the wrong thing stick
[2:01:09] with what is right now okay now so when
[2:01:11] they were in the upper room they haul
[2:01:12] themselves up familiar quot in the upper
[2:01:14] room these seeds to word and the wood
[2:01:16] was laying there without life in it all
[2:01:18] of sudden all of a all of a sudden there
[2:01:21] came a song from Heaven Hallelujah as
[2:01:24] the ministers from forign came down no
[2:01:26] no no no no from as the waters begin to
[2:01:28] gush down and it actually fill all the
[2:01:31] house where they were sitting and the
[2:01:32] seeds begin to grow it begin to manifest
[2:01:35] itself the word of God manifested the
[2:01:37] word was in them the dry and whatnot but
[2:01:39] holy ghost come transform them all right
[2:01:42] now watch we live through Luther's age
[2:01:44] Wesley age Pentecostal age and watch and
[2:01:47] each age is given a promise of the word
[2:01:49] and the people of that age that manifest
[2:01:51] that promised word is the seed of that
[2:01:53] age according to what Jesus said here
[2:01:55] they are the children of the Kingdom
[2:01:56] that's right the manifestation of the
[2:01:59] Holy Spirit operating to his children is
[2:02:02] those seed of the kingdom of that age oh
[2:02:05] praise God Amen so you have to become
[2:02:08] that the Holy Ghost operating through
[2:02:10] you we keep your long in all right all
[2:02:12] right let's go so I got this to repair
[2:02:14] of the breach a phrase Isaiah 5812
[2:02:20] it shall be the build the old way spaces
[2:02:22] thou shal raise up foundations of many
[2:02:24] generations thou shal be called the
[2:02:25] repairer of the breach the restorer of
[2:02:28] past dwelling and this is something I
[2:02:30] search out here the phrase refers to a
[2:02:32] role of characteristic of a person who
[2:02:34] is dedicated to mending or restoring
[2:02:37] what is broken or damaged whether it is
[2:02:40] physical emotional spiritual it implies
[2:02:43] someone who works to reconcile divisions
[2:02:46] heal relationships and bring about rest
[2:02:48] Restorations and unity praise God you
[2:02:52] shall be called the repairer of the
[2:02:55] breach ancient walls were made of stone
[2:02:57] or brick reinforced with towers and
[2:02:59] Gates and M and ditches they were often
[2:03:01] attack and Siege by Siege Batten Rams
[2:03:03] and catapults to defend these The
[2:03:05] Defenders would use counterweight
[2:03:07] machines and so like that and that wall
[2:03:09] was fortified in case of war the enemy
[2:03:12] Bes the city made efforts to breach the
[2:03:15] wall with a Batton Ram the goal was to
[2:03:17] force a breach wiing up for the troops
[2:03:19] to enter into the city oh praise God
[2:03:23] here we go hallelujah hallelujah so
[2:03:25] that's the devil job now to see where
[2:03:27] you're strong not where you're weak to
[2:03:29] see where you're weak rather and see
[2:03:30] where he could break you down more so if
[2:03:32] you have a chance to attack he will
[2:03:34] attack and break your walls to see if
[2:03:35] you could get inside all right so here
[2:03:38] Jesus brought God to human lives God has
[2:03:40] made human when Jesus was born he became
[2:03:43] man isn't that right now you are not
[2:03:45] converted until you receed the Holy
[2:03:46] Ghost Bible said so after Peter had both
[2:03:48] been saved sa and Sanctified given power
[2:03:50] to cast out on spirits and to preach the
[2:03:52] gospel Jesus plainly told him he was not
[2:03:54] converted until he receiv received the
[2:03:55] Holy Ghost now the Holy Spirit we're
[2:03:57] going running quickly now will not
[2:03:59] misbehave itself in one person and
[2:04:00] behave itself in another it makes each
[2:04:02] person come into into its character
[2:04:05] because it's the spirit that leads you
[2:04:07] so somebody have Holy Ghost and among of
[2:04:09] foolishness and another person behav in
[2:04:10] the it's not the same is that right all
[2:04:13] right so when God plac men here in the
[2:04:14] days of Jesus he give men a true road
[2:04:16] map to power you ready a road tells you
[2:04:19] which way you're headed he said I've
[2:04:21] crossed the country so much my old wife

[2:04:24] last few years I could mention where you
[2:04:26] want to go I could tell you any road
[2:04:27] that leads to it within 15 minutes of
[2:04:29] time you'll arrive isn't that right
[2:04:31] that's what he said it and that's the
[2:04:32] way God want us to know his
[2:04:34] word where every pothole is once you
[2:04:37] keep driving a place after Poole you see
[2:04:39] them Maxis that why some they driving
[2:04:41] the best thing going a new place follow
[2:04:43] somebody who who know the road when they
[2:04:46] swing so swing so too cuz they know it's
[2:04:48] a PO day you don't know the road that's
[2:04:49] right they know the road that's right he
[2:04:51] said that's the way God wants us to know
[2:04:53] his word we travel it we know it we have
[2:04:56] tested it we have tried it we know it
[2:04:58] leads to here we go the Bible is the

[2:07:29] just must it have no excuse so get
[2:07:34] ready so Jesus as soon as he received
[2:07:37] the fullness of the spirit he
[2:07:39] immediately went to the minister
[2:07:42] Association I start to give a testimony
[2:07:44] we oh
[2:07:45] we no no we
[2:07:49] immediately he was led by the spirit
[2:07:52] Into the Wilderness to be tested on the
[2:07:54] lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh
[2:07:58] and the pride of
[2:07:59] life which is all that is in the world
[2:08:02] oh give the Lord a praise offering he
[2:08:05] was tested without a another Minister
[2:08:08] without Elders without deacons without
[2:08:10] any assistance whatever he CAU in other
[2:08:11] words he was tested with the devil face
[2:08:13] to face and he overcome him he overcame
[2:08:17] him oh give the some Praises it is
[2:08:20] written it is written it is written and
[2:08:22] when we are prophesying by the testimony
[2:08:24] of Jesus we are really saying it is
[2:08:26] written it is written Oh Glory to God

[2:08:41] break out you're going to bust
[2:08:43] out
[2:08:45] glory glory to God
[2:08:50] hallelujah praise God praise God praise
[2:08:54] God there we go you go through a testing
[2:08:58] time the church goes through a testing
[2:09:00] time each individual goes through a
[2:09:02] testing time before it can ever possess
[2:09:05] the Gate of the enemy Abraham went
[2:09:07] through it Christ went through it after
[2:09:08] Christ was filled with the Holy Spirit
[2:09:10] on the River Jordan he went through a
[2:09:11] testing time after Abram was called out
[2:09:13] put into the land to be a pilgrim and
[2:09:15] circumcision God met him time after time
[2:09:17] yet he had to go through testing and God
[2:09:20] here was doing that we call in the Bible
[2:09:22] the placing of a son he was born a son
[2:09:24] and he was fell air to his father
[2:09:26] Kingdom or possession he had to be
[2:09:28] raised and tried God he find out whether
[2:09:30] the son is true or not or simply a rust
[2:09:33] about and this son would be would never
[2:09:35] be a if he wasn't qualified to take the
[2:09:37] father's place but if he was qualified
[2:09:39] and took the father's place all the
[2:09:41] father had given was to the son and I
[2:09:43] think many of us Pentecostal people has
[2:09:44] made a mistake we think as soon as we
[2:09:46] become sons and daughters that settles
[2:09:48] it we just come into a place of trying
[2:09:53] so the Pentecostals couldn't get the
[2:09:55] character to be endued efficiently and
[2:09:58] effectively with power because they
[2:10:00] didn't take the chastisement and the
[2:10:01] discipline they r on gifts they still
[2:10:03] speaking tongues and they give money oh
[2:10:05] praise the name of the Lord he said we
[2:10:07] just come into a place of trying the
[2:10:09] Methodist said as soon as they shouted
[2:10:10] that settle it the Lutheran believe
[2:10:12] faith and justification thought that
[2:10:13] settled it no matter what kind of
[2:10:15] position God put you in you are still
[2:10:16] growing on towards perfection
[2:10:19] so until you have arrived you're
[2:10:20] pressing you're fighting you're
[2:10:23] struggling can somebody say Amen so
[2:10:25] don't sit on Moses seat to judge me or
[2:10:27] judge the church or judge this one don't
[2:10:28] sit there come on from Moses seat let
[2:10:30] Moses be Moses you are not Moses come on
[2:10:32] from Moses seat oh give the Lord and
[2:10:34] shout hallelujah praise God hallelujah
[2:10:38] praise God Amen if you're Abraham seed
[2:10:41] and you look at the promise of God what
[2:10:43] God Said to do about it he said that's
[2:10:45] Abraham's seed now you got to come
[2:10:47] through those testings Abraham first was
[2:10:49] tested then sealed then given the
[2:10:51] promise the thing of it is we can't
[2:10:53] stand the tested and that's the reason
[2:10:56] that or organizations cannot stand the
[2:10:58] test it is not the will of God God has
[2:11:01] blessed it but it isn't the will of God
[2:11:03] because you've got a whole company of
[2:11:05] men here A whole company of ideas they
[2:11:07] pull together and come out the best of
[2:11:09] what they can some say this is a big man
[2:11:11] you can't his word and so on like that
[2:11:12] right all right Abraham never look at
[2:11:14] one thing but God's promise that's the
[2:11:17] reason we don't find more an
[2:11:19] organization here we go can't possess
[2:11:22] the Gate of the enemy so there's no
[2:11:24] group Revelation is individuals getting
[2:11:27] Revelation there's no church Revelation
[2:11:30] so watch organization can't possess the
[2:11:32] G an enemy there are too many fungle
[2:11:34] Minds in there it's got to take an
[2:11:36] individual that possess the gates of the
[2:11:38] enemy the thing you have to overcome oh
[2:11:41] my is yourself your idea before you
[2:11:45] blame this one and that one why don't
[2:11:47] you blame you why don't you look in the
[2:11:49] mirror stop making excuses it's always a
[2:11:51] aunt a uncle a tanty a father a mother
[2:11:53] brother your husband your this you no
[2:11:55] money you the car cut that rot out it's
[2:11:59] you do like Jonah I am the man throw me
[2:12:02] overboard it's you the thing you have to
[2:12:06] overcome is you oh glory to God overcome
[2:12:09] your idea your thing surrender yourself
[2:12:11] to him to overcome he knows the way we
[2:12:14] don't Oh Glory to God thank you Jesus
[2:12:17] I'm page nine Oh Glory we speed up real
[2:12:20] fast Hallelujah only 14 pages all right
[2:12:23] let's go here this in Noah's time eight
[2:12:25] Overcomers that went in they were caught
[2:12:27] inside eight Overcomers whatever you do
[2:12:31] who listening now who would listen
[2:12:32] Hereafter the always very late you have
[2:12:35] good intentions but don't be caught
[2:12:36] outside not him that will let or run it
[2:12:39] just let God just yield yourself to him
[2:12:42] walk on with a perfect satisfied faith
[2:12:44] that what God has promised is able to
[2:12:46] perform now we are expected in D
[2:12:50] Daniel's time there were four Overcomers
[2:12:52] that could stand a test of fire and lion
[2:12:54] we are expected to be tested that's a
[2:12:56] good lesson for my brother back there
[2:12:58] also he that comeing to God must first
[2:13:00] be tested you can't overcome L there a
[2:13:03] test given to
[2:13:05] you that why you have CXC you have GC
[2:13:08] you have Advance they must test you you
[2:13:09] go to school and you don't want to test
[2:13:12] how they will know what you
[2:13:14] do some of these children I see them
[2:13:16] with almost nothing in in school
[2:13:19] like one copy book or something so they
[2:13:20] going to school they Lear they leaving
[2:13:23] every day they going to school but
[2:13:25] they're not learning but they're on
[2:13:28] their way to school don't we that in
[2:13:30] church stay
[2:13:34] home no I begging nobody to be here we
[2:13:36] have no free Bible to give in Kentucky
[2:13:37] if I chicken
[2:13:38] gosts free chips no you have to want
[2:13:42] this thing as a
[2:13:44] reality all right let's hit the home
[2:13:46] session now all right
[2:13:48] you can overcome at least there's a test
[2:13:50] given to you and when a test is given
[2:13:53] it's to see whether you can overcome or
[2:13:56] not and Jesus said to him that overcome
[2:13:59] it the test is the greatest thing that
[2:14:01] ever happened to
[2:14:03] you two people say amen to the greatest
[2:14:06] thing to them
[2:14:11] the as I say somebody and they sue the L
[2:14:16] people for winning it
[2:14:20] they say ruined their
[2:14:22] life they they wi millions of pounds and
[2:14:26] they blow all the millions and mess up
[2:14:28] their life they're suing them like
[2:14:29] you're not supposed to have so much not
[2:14:31] I'm not supposed to win
[2:14:34] that so how could we return in the power
[2:14:37] of the
[2:14:39] spirit if there is no test
[2:14:43] given Jesus said come and say come the
[2:14:45] spirit no no no no no he passed your
[2:14:47] wilderness
[2:14:48] so to return in the power of the spirit
[2:14:52] it has to come true
[2:14:55] test Prophecy from perfect Faith the
[2:14:58] church has to lift itself in the power
[2:15:01] of
[2:15:03] God did you hear
[2:15:05] that the church has to lift itself in
[2:15:08] the power of God we are to close to the
[2:15:10] end now and I believe the church is in a
[2:15:12] condition where we can teach a little
[2:15:13] deeper things and rub some of the MC
[2:15:16] belief out and I believe that too oh
[2:15:20] glory to God
[2:15:21] hallelujah let's go notice Jesus did he
[2:15:24] heal everybody no sir when his was given
[2:15:27] power to heal the sick raise the dead
[2:15:28] cleanse the leper cast what Devils they
[2:15:29] were given did they heal everybody they
[2:15:31] come in t with no did they heal
[2:15:33] everybody they prayed for no miserably
[2:15:36] failed after they had was given power
[2:15:39] there it was laid the church has the
[2:15:41] power but not the Fate
[2:15:44] operated
[2:15:46] oh so when the man wasn't healed and
[2:15:49] they ask J why he wasn't healed he said
[2:15:51] because of your unbelief that's the same
[2:15:53] thing today Christ don't change people
[2:15:55] change your faith
[2:15:58] changes and from perfect Faith you know
[2:16:00] this quote they had power but not the
[2:16:02] faith to use the power there is the
[2:16:03] brandham Tabernacle there is the church
[2:16:05] the bride today the holy spirit is here
[2:16:07] with the power but you haven't got any
[2:16:09] faith to move it it takes Faith to move
[2:16:11] it so if Malachi 4 came to turn our
[2:16:15] hearts back to the faith of the PS the
[2:16:17] faith is to move the power so you can't
[2:16:19] talk that Faith you have to manif oh my
[2:16:21] God hallelujah you have to manifest that
[2:16:25] Faith oh do you get it now hallelujah
[2:16:28] praise God we almost reach a cap of what
[2:16:31] we have here
[2:16:32] now hallelujah hallelujah I believe the
[2:16:37] age has come now that the miraculous the
[2:16:40] phenomenal the baptism of the spirit and
[2:16:42] power and signs and wonders this great
[2:16:45] pouring out of God's spirit in the last
[2:16:47] days
[2:16:48] that's the thing that will bring Faith
[2:16:50] into the people I thought these
[2:16:52] Mysteries these seven T Mysteries
[2:16:55] literally turn the CH back to the F fast
[2:16:58] yeah that's one part but you had to take
[2:17:00] this part too you can't leave this part
[2:17:01] out he a great point out of the God's
[2:17:04] spirit that's the thing that will bring
[2:17:08] Fai into the people that will take a
[2:17:11] Rapture in faith that will take the
[2:17:12] church into
[2:17:13] Glory what great old point of the spirit
[2:17:16] they don't want to talk about that but
[2:17:17] I'm going to talk about that because God
[2:17:19] promis it God can't lie oh praise God
[2:17:22] praise God here we go when home Str now
[2:17:25] we zero now how can the church be
[2:17:27] raptured when we haven't even got faith
[2:17:29] for the healing we have got to have
[2:17:31] rapturing faith first what do he say how
[2:17:34] could you believe that your body will be
[2:17:35] changed and you can't believe cancer
[2:17:36] could
[2:17:40] dissolve your family had cancer this one
[2:17:42] had tumor this one had that that one had
[2:17:44] that we have to have faith for them
[2:17:45] things we have to demonstrate
[2:17:48] to the devil what kingdom we are

[2:19:20] another kingdom all together they said
[2:19:23] he cast out Devils by Bob the king of
[2:19:27] devils and then Jesus made an
[2:19:29] astonishing
[2:19:32] statement he said no
[2:19:34] Kingdom divided against itself can stand
[2:19:39] and if I cast out the Devils by the

[2:21:03] house of the Lord and when he did he had
[2:21:05] laid the foundation stone and as we read

[2:21:13] Headstone I want you to notice he never
[2:21:15] said about the Cornerstone you shall
