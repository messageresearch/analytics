[1:08] Oh,
[1:09] hallelujah. We're here to praise him.
[1:12] We're here to worship him this morning.
[1:15] We're here to give him all the glory
[1:17] that is due unto his name. Oh,
[1:20] hallelujah. Hallelujah. I thank you,
[1:23] Lord.
[1:25] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:28] Oh, tribute the praise.
[1:31] I offer you this morning. I lay it on
[1:34] the altar. Oh, hallelujah. You are the
[1:37] God of all my days.
[1:41] I thank your pray Lord. Amen for your
[1:44] goodness and your mercy. Are you happy
[1:47] to be in the house of the Lord this
[1:48] morning?
[1:50] Are you happy to be found alive in his
[1:52] hands?
[1:53] Doesn't matter what happens. As long as
[1:56] I'm in his hands,
[1:58] I know I'll be all right. God bless you
[2:01] this morning as we find our Bibles.
[2:03] Welcome to the house of the Lord.
[2:06] Uh we'd like to turn our Bibles over to
[2:08] Psalms chapter 100, our scripture
[2:11] reading this morning.
[2:13] a psalm of praise this morning. Amen.
[2:16] And I know you're familiar with it. So
[2:18] if you know it, say it along with me as
[2:20] we read this morning from the Holy R.
[2:23] Psalms 100. It says, "Make a joyful
[2:25] noise unto the Lord, all ye lands. Serve
[2:31] the Lord with gladness. Come before his
[2:34] presence with singing. Know ye that the
[2:38] Lord, he is God. It is he that had made
[2:41] us and not we ourselves. We are his
[2:45] people and the sheep of his pasture.
[2:49] Enter into his gates with thanksgiving
[2:52] and into his courts with praise. Be
[2:55] thankful unto him and blessed his name.
[2:59] For the Lord is good, his mercy is
[3:03] everlasting
[3:04] and his truth endureth to all
[3:07] generations. May God add blessing to the
[3:10] reading of his word this morning. Can we
[3:11] praise him? Oh, hallelujah. Glory to
[3:14] God. Thank you, Jesus. We're here to
[3:16] make a joyful noise this morning. Let us
[3:19] bow our heads and pray. Amen. Heavenly
[3:23] Father, we thank you, Lord, to be here
[3:26] this morning, to be alive in your grace,
[3:28] Lord. Father, we did not bring
[3:31] ourselves, Lord. We did not call
[3:32] ourselves, Father. We did not save
[3:35] ourselves. Neither could we choose
[3:36] ourselves. You chose us, Lord Father,
[3:40] before the foundation of the world.
[3:41] Lord, Father, you brought us forth,
[3:43] Lord. You took us out of the miry clay.
[3:47] You put our foot on a rock this morning,
[3:49] and that rock is Jesus Christ. Oh,
[3:52] there's no great thing of us, Lord
[3:54] Father, that we could exalt this
[3:55] morning. There is nothing higher than
[3:57] you today. We give you the highest
[4:00] praise, Lord, Father, because you
[4:02] deserve it, Lord Father. Because there's
[4:04] no one else like you this morning. So we
[4:07] come into the tabernacle today. We come
[4:10] to lift up holy hands, Lord Father, to
[4:12] acknowledge you, Lord as God and Savior,
[4:16] as creator of our lives. Oh God, Father,
[4:18] you are founded it upon the seas and
[4:20] establish it upon the floods. Lord, we
[4:23] pray that you establish your word here
[4:24] this morning. Establish your anointing
[4:26] in us this morning, Father, as we
[4:29] surround, Lord, the throne of God this
[4:31] morning with praise, honor, and glory,
[4:33] joining with the angels that never cease
[4:35] to worship you, dear God, for all of
[4:37] your goodness and your mercies, Lord,
[4:40] for the generations and generations. We
[4:42] praise you this morning. We give you
[4:44] glory. We give you honor. We come to
[4:46] worship and adore you this morning. We
[4:48] come to create an atmosphere in the
[4:50] house of God that you would be pleased
[4:51] to come down in and dwell with us, Lord,
[4:54] and minister to our hearts and lives,
[4:56] Father, as we look to you, God. Our eyes
[5:00] are steadfast upon you, Lord. Father,
[5:02] Lord, to see what you would speak to us,
[5:04] Lord. We are ready in waiting this
[5:07] morning. Pour out your spirit this
[5:09] morning. Pour out your anointing,
[5:11] Father. May you touch lives today, Lord.
[5:14] Touch us in the physical realm. Touch us
[5:17] in the spirit, Lord. Father, touch all
[5:19] weary souls this morning. Give strength
[5:21] to the weary. Give grace to the humble.
[5:24] Father, may you pour out healing upon
[5:26] those that are sick. May you raise up
[5:28] the town and Lord, may you bless, oh
[5:30] God, the mothers, the fathers, the
[5:32] husbands, the wives, Lord, the children,
[5:34] oh God. Father, may you fill this place
[5:36] with your with your holy presence. Even
[5:39] those that are on the internet this
[5:40] morning hooking in, Lord, listening
[5:42] online, we pray you bless them wherever
[5:45] they may be. Father, may your anointing
[5:47] poured upon him also. Bless your servant
[5:49] as he yields himself to be used mightily
[5:52] of the spirit. Lord, we want today to be
[5:54] a glorious and blessed day. We surrender
[5:56] it to you, Lord, that your mighty works
[5:59] would be done in it, Father. All that is
[6:01] to happen thereafter, we commit it into
[6:03] your hands. We pray, Father, have your
[6:05] way in Jesus Christ's precious name. We
[6:08] pray and ask and commit these things.
[6:10] Amen. And amen and amen. Can we give the
[6:13] Lord a praise offering? Amen. Glory to
[6:16] God. Hallelujah.
[6:18] Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Father.
[6:21] Hallelujah. You could raise the key up
[6:23] just one. Amen.

[9:46] grace. I need your love. My love is not
[9:50] enough. My power is not enough. I can't

[34:25] our heart's desire to be just like you,
[34:27] to live like you, to love like you, to

[34:31] your prayer message this morning in
[34:33] Jesus name I ask it. Amen. What a song.
[34:37] What a presence we feel this morning and
[34:39] we are grateful. Amen. Praise God. God
[34:42] bless you. It's good to be home. I know
[34:45] you were blessed last week with the
[34:47] message from Pastor Ulu
[34:49] the house that love built.
[34:53] Amen. Brother Steven Oliver sent me this
[34:55] testimony.
[34:57] God bless you brother. I have a small
[34:58] testimony. I was listening to uh brother
[35:02] Abraham's message this week and at the
[35:03] end he was praying for the sick and each
[35:06] time he was saying do you believe me to
[35:09] be God's prophet God's servant I asked
[35:12] myself for a moment why is it that he
[35:15] had to ask each person that questioned
[35:18] on my mind a bit but today God in his
[35:21] great love for me explained the answer
[35:23] in such great detail it could not have
[35:26] been a better explained it was truly God
[35:29] for the meeting every need through his
[35:31] word and through his ministry. So,
[35:33] praise God. He was really blessed with
[35:34] brother's message and also we had three
[35:38] baptisms last Sunday and I was very
[35:39] pleased how this unfolded in the absence
[35:42] of brother Isaac and I. God bless you
[35:44] all and was very happy to hear the
[35:46] report. Amen.
[35:50] Also want to thank brother Steven for
[35:53] overseeing the baptism service
[35:56] and for brother Adrian for conducting
[35:57] the baptisms and so on.
[36:02] You know when I was heard about the
[36:03] baptism and and out
[36:08] when we come back said not not at all
[36:09] the church have to move on. This is what
[36:11] we want to see. We want to see that
[36:13] nothing must hinder what has to be done.
[36:17] Praise God. Not the church is not built
[36:18] upon us. It built upon Jesus Christ the
[36:21] rock of revelation. Amen. Okay. So we
[36:25] also want to thank
[36:28] also for songs at the baptism service.
[36:31] Isaac was in Lagos Nigeria where he
[36:33] ministered
[36:34] church and also church. The Lord did
[36:37] bless tremendously.
[36:40] So last weekend I was in Miami two
[36:42] churches in Miami and I preached on the
[36:44] latter to fall and Another message the
[36:49] restoration of the person of Christ to
[36:51] the bride by
[36:53] now in the latter of the fall just want
[36:56] to read a quote from it. What is the
[36:57] seed of life? The word of God. Therefore
[37:00] for life you can't come through a creed.
[37:04] You can't come through a denomination.
[37:06] You have got to come back to the word.
[37:08] This thing church you go to tabernacle
[37:11] have nothing to do with that. You've got
[37:12] to come back to the word. Now the seed
[37:14] of life. All right. His word is a seed
[37:17] and his spirit is the water. So it's not
[37:20] just word word. The word is a seed but
[37:24] the spirit is the water. Right back to
[37:26] John 3:13. Jesus is the word of God.
[37:29] Yeah. Yeah. We're going to and he was to
[37:31] be busted open
[37:33] that life. So Jesus just just didn't die
[37:37] at Calvary and pay the price. His that
[37:39] seed had to break open that life could
[37:42] be released. And that's why you in this
[37:44] building this morning.
[37:45] Because his life is what reach you
[37:48] because no man could come except the
[37:49] father by his spirit pulls and draws and
[37:53] woos. So if the spirit had draw you
[37:54] can't come.
[37:57] If the spirit haven't drawn you, you
[37:59] cannot come.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; You can only come because something is
[38:02] moving you. Remember the devil pulling
[38:03] too. You know
[38:05] &gt;&gt; devil pulling downwards, God pulling
[38:06] upwards.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; So God pulling you to get you where you
[38:09] are.
[38:12] You might be broken, but he still got
[38:14] you.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; You might be wounded, but he still got
[38:16] you. You may have dirt and mud on you,
[38:18] but he still got you.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; He could clean you up, but he got you.
[38:22] Give the Lord some praises. There's no
[38:25] reason for anybody inside of here not to
[38:27] praise God this morning.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; Because he got you.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Whatever condition is, he got you.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; He have your back. He got you.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Hallelujah.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Here we go.
[38:39] Therefore, if the spirit of God comes
[38:41] forth to water the seed, if it's a seed
[38:43] it's watering, it will produce a life in
[38:45] the seed. Is that clear? It produce the
[38:48] life of the seed. And that's what is
[38:49] given for. Amen. And the restoration of
[38:52] the person of Christ by the bride by
[38:54] Malachi 4. God didn't say God didn't
[38:56] send a prophet William Brandham for us
[38:57] to be preaching William Brandham.
[39:00] That's not the object. Brandon Brham.
[39:03] That's not the purpose. He sent a
[39:04] prophet. A prophet is for purpose. No,
[39:06] as John the Baptist was sent to forun my
[39:09] coming, first coming. You have a message
[39:12] that was for on my second coming. God
[39:14] sent William Brandham to introduce Jesus
[39:16] Christ.
[39:19] Let me say it good. God sent William
[39:22] Brham to introduce the person of Jesus
[39:24] Christ. The Pentecostals only had gifts.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; They didn't have the person because the
[39:30] person comes by the word
[39:31] &gt;&gt; and the word is in that pyramid there.
[39:33] faith and virtue and knowledge and
[39:35] temperance that's Jesus Christ.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; So let me give you his own words here
[39:41] now and my inspiration in that message
[39:43] was from the prophet to his prophecy.
[39:45] People stuck at the prophet. What about
[39:47] the prophecy? The prophet that come to
[39:49] say I'm a prophet. I'm a prophet. I'm a
[39:50] prophet. You have a prophet. What are
[39:51] you doing with that? The prophet come to
[39:52] prophesy.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; You have to get from the prophet to the
[39:56] prophecy. All the time they were
[39:58] prophesying. Messiah coming. Messiah
[39:59] come. Here come John the Baptist. He
[40:00] said behold the lamb of God. And right
[40:03] there it switch from the prophet
[40:05] &gt;&gt; to the prophecy.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; Follow him. Who him? Jesus Christ. Oh
[40:10] give the Lord some praises. This is the
[40:12] words of William Brham. We are not
[40:14] building an organization. I am not here
[40:17] this morning to build an organization.
[40:20] Christ never sent me to build an
[40:23] organization. Christ sent me to build
[40:25] individuals to the stature of Jesus
[40:28] Christ that they might be a powerhouse
[40:31] and a dwelling place of the spirit by
[40:34] his word. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[40:37] Hallelujah.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; That's what God wants you to be. A
[40:40] powerhouse, not a dependent house, not a
[40:43] loose house, a slack house.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; I'm not hearing you.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; God sent you to be a powerhouse.
[40:54] Powered by the spirit,
[40:56] &gt;&gt; powered by the word,
[41:04] &gt;&gt; not we Christians. All these drones they
[41:07] flying on all these drones with Ukraine
[41:08] and attacking. These things are very
[41:10] accurate.
[41:14] You could be emotional about essay
[41:16] writing and thing at 90. You see
[41:18] mathematics, it have no mystics with
[41:20] that. Four and will still equal eight.
[41:23] You know, unless you say 4 is 44 like
[41:26] one. Oh yeah, I see in that. But 4 + 4
[41:28] will always be 8. You know 2 + 2 will
[41:30] always equal four. You know it's 100%.
[41:32] You know this pride will hit the
[41:34] cylinders 100%. You know
[41:37] &gt;&gt; it's no mistake. You know seven is no
[41:39] mistake. Five is no mistake. Three is no
[41:42] mistakes. Five is grace. Three is
[41:44] perfection. Seven is completion. There's
[41:46] no mistakes in God mathematics.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Seven churches.
[41:52] It's finished.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; Let me be seated. This bride age in is a
[41:59] mystery. You know it have no scripture
[42:01] say bright. You only have loud know but
[42:04] God pull you out on top of brotherly
[42:06] kindness. Have that Holy Spirit slot.
[42:09] God pull you out to put you into the
[42:12] Holy Spirit slot that you could be
[42:14] capped by the magnet of the Holy Ghost.
[42:17] Christ coming to take you up. Nothing
[42:20] loud is here. You have to come out of
[42:21] that.
[42:26] Hallelujah.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; Let's say again, Christ has not sent me
[42:29] to build organization. Christ sent me to
[42:31] build individuals to the statue of Jesus
[42:34] Christ. Not to follow some man, not to
[42:36] follow some church.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Because this is the age of maturity.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; I can't say it here now. There's a whole
[42:43] message by itself. The reason the
[42:44] Pentecostals couldn't get the mysteries
[42:46] because he said they were begotten. You
[42:48] know what that means? They were in the
[42:49] womb. the baby born yet. Up to now with
[42:52] all the million dollar billers they
[42:54] have, all the million dollar
[42:55] congregation they have, all the
[42:56] thousands and thousands, they still
[42:58] failing and falling. They have no life
[43:02] because the life come by the word and
[43:04] the word comes to a prophet and they
[43:05] turn on the prophet. They turn on their
[43:07] life. They have church, they have
[43:08] million, they have airplane, they have
[43:10] this that everything you think about it
[43:11] and they still falling one by one. It
[43:13] has to fall, has to fail because man
[43:16] kingdom has coming down. Daniel say, "I
[43:18] see a rock cut out without the hands of
[43:20] man." What you about to see is without
[43:22] the hands of man. No message man, no
[43:24] message pop, no pastor man, no man at
[43:27] all.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Christ said upon this rock I
[43:31] will build.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Look at me start here this morning. My
[43:34] church Jesus have a church. You know,
[43:37] &gt;&gt; that church is a kingdom and the kingdom
[43:39] is word and utter power.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the kingdom of God.
[43:44] And he is the head of the body called
[43:45] the church. No man, no head of you.
[43:48] Okay, the Lord has shouted the house. No
[43:51] man is no head of no pride and no man
[43:54] head nowhere.
[43:57] No American man, no Europe man, no
[43:59] African man, no
[44:02] South American man and no Trinidad man.
[44:05] Let me say it good in case they hear it.
[44:08] He say it good. No man in charge of this
[44:09] bride. He is the head of the body.
[44:14] Man can hold the church but not the
[44:16] bride.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You may be seated.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; These stars falling into the
[44:27] constellation back under that angel
[44:29] coming. I said and John the Bapt was
[44:31] sent to wind up the Old Testament and to
[44:34] bring forth the introduction of Christ.
[44:36] A message will wind up the loose ends
[44:40] and introduce the Messiah.
[44:43] just before his coming. Introduce who?
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Aha. You mean brother Brandham came to
[44:49] the Messiah? That's right. The Messiah
[44:51] came down in Revelation 10. The Lord
[44:53] himself descend from him with a shout
[44:56] with the book open. And seven thunders
[44:59] bust out them books. Bust out those
[45:01] voices. Those voices was loosed to
[45:03] gather the bride together to give the
[45:05] bride faith to show the bride how to be
[45:07] pure. That is only bright thing, not
[45:10] bride maid thing. bright thing. He come
[45:13] to get that bride. Go get that bride.
[45:15] There are millions of church members,
[45:17] but the bride is a minority. Hallelujah.
[45:20] Praise God. So, I was blessed to have to
[45:23] be in a ministers meeting over there
[45:25] also. So, praise God. Uh very happy for
[45:29] what the Lord is doing and we can only
[45:31] expect greater things. So, let's stand.
[45:33] We want to go into the word. One
[45:34] scripture. This is the first time I
[45:36] think I'm only reading a one verse
[45:37] scripture.
[45:39] So,
[45:42] Galatians 4:19, just one verse.
[45:54] My little children
[45:56] of whom I travail in birth until Christ
[46:00] be formed in you as God. Almighty God,
[46:03] we thank you for your word and your
[46:05] scriptures. I pray you come down in a
[46:07] special way on the people.
[46:10] I know what you have on my heart and
[46:12] what to share. I pray that you would
[46:14] honor your word this morning with signs,
[46:16] wonders and miracles and pour the Holy
[46:19] Spirit upon the lives of the children.
[46:21] Their lives be changed here be
[46:23] transformed that many come to hear. They
[46:24] go back home and all they do is hear.
[46:26] But I pray today you would arrest them
[46:29] that they go beyond hearing and they go
[46:31] to acting upon the word and receive it.
[46:33] Father in Jesus name I ask. Amen. You
[46:35] may be seated. Praise God.
[46:38] Okay.
[46:40] I got a a note from a brother
[46:45] a question I'd like to read for you.
[46:48] Greetings brother over in the precious
[46:50] name of Jesus.
[46:52] I pray that this correspondence meets
[46:53] you in good health and strength. I
[46:55] choose to write rather than speak so
[46:58] that my thoughts will be properly
[47:00] ordered and not come across as
[47:03] in the latter part of 2025. have been
[47:05] making it a daily habit
[47:09] to listen to a message from the prophet
[47:12] or to one of our church services in its
[47:14] entirety.
[47:16] Did you hear that
[47:19] I get
[47:22] because it say here I made it a daily
[47:26] habit. You see before it comes
[47:29] unconscious habit or conscious doing you
[47:31] have to consciously do it
[47:34] because habit actually produces
[47:35] character in life
[47:39] to listen to a message from the prophet
[47:44] or to one hour church services in its
[47:46] entirety.
[47:48] On January 19th, 2026, around 7:15 p.m.,
[47:52] while searching through YouTube under
[47:54] the tab title righteousness, I came
[47:55] across a trailer for our July 2020
[47:58] virtual convention. I allowed it to play
[48:02] to its entirety. Immediately after it
[48:04] ended, it transitioned into a sermon
[48:06] preached by you on May 15 prior to the
[48:09] convention. The title of the sermon was,
[48:11] "Let us cross Jordan
[48:13] to an open vision of another Ephesians."
[48:17] What struck me as unusual was that the
[48:19] sermon began playing from the middle of
[48:22] the service. From that message, what
[48:25] stayed with me most was that as
[48:27] Christian believers seeking to attain
[48:29] the crown of adoption, we must cross
[48:32] Jordan with no shortcuts. The central
[48:35] theme of the sermon was death to self.
[48:38] Early the next morning, I awoke with a
[48:40] question pressing strongly upon my
[48:43] heart. Is the approach to Jordan
[48:46] intentional
[48:47] or is it by conditions?
[48:50] This brought to mind the prophet's
[48:51] statement. If love does not get us
[48:55] desperate,
[48:57] conditions will.
[48:59] This question arose directly from what
[49:02] was preached in the sermon, particularly
[49:04] concerning debt to self and forsaking of
[49:06] certain comforts and desires of this
[49:08] life before crossing Jordan. Now, as the
[49:11] Lord Jesus said in Matthew 19:29, that
[49:13] every one of you that had forsaken
[49:15] houses and brethren and sisters or
[49:17] father, mother or wife, children or
[49:19] lands for my name's sake shall receive a
[49:22] hundfold and shall inherit everlasting
[49:25] life. The scripture I felt pressed to
[49:28] read that morning was Romans 8 in its
[49:30] entirety with verses 1 and 12 and 15
[49:35] especially remaining with me. There is
[49:37] therefore now no condemnation to them
[49:39] which are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[49:42] after the flesh but after the spirit.
[49:44] Therefore, brethren, we are debtors not
[49:46] to the flesh to live after the flesh.
[49:48] For if you live after the flesh, you
[49:49] shall die. But if you through the spirit
[49:52] do mortify the deeds of the body, you
[49:53] shall live. For as many as are led by
[49:56] the spirit of God, they are the sons of
[49:58] God. For you have not received the
[50:00] spirit of bondage into fear, but you
[50:02] have received the spirit of adoption,
[50:04] whereby we cry, "Aba, Father." So my
[50:06] question remains
[50:14] or by intentional
[50:17] surrender and obedience.
[50:19] I also reflected on brother Brandham's
[50:21] experience with his first encounter with
[50:23] Jesus own only Pentecostal people when
[50:27] his mother-in-law warned him not to take
[50:29] her daughter among that. She considered
[50:32] such
[50:38] was extremely severe the loss of his
[50:41] wife and daughter. I will appreciate I
[50:45] would greatly appreciate your thoughts
[50:46] and spiritual insight on this question.
[50:48] Yours sincerely in Christ brother Shane
[50:50] Williams. I love this question. So when
[50:52] I got this question I said brother Shane
[50:53] I'll answer it but I want to read this
[50:55] for the church. So if so I have this
[50:58] here is crossing to Jordan by condition
[51:03] or by intentional surrender and
[51:06] obedience. So I want to answer this
[51:08] because this is important
[51:10] because of what I had in my heart to
[51:12] preach and this ties in straight
[51:14] perfectly. So let me give you the title
[51:16] of what I have here this morning.
[51:20] Title I have is when you are dying
[51:23] and Christ is coming to life.
[51:27] And the subject I have the age of dying
[51:29] out the death of a corner. That's the
[51:32] subject I have. Amen. The age of dying.
[51:35] I know there's not.
[51:41] So let's just answer this question.
[51:43] Is crossing the Jordan by condition or
[51:46] by intentional surrender and obedience?
[51:48] Joshua 1 2 and3 God speaks. Moses my
[51:52] servant is dead. Now therefore arise, go
[51:56] over this Jordan. Now we say in Jordan,
[51:58] but Jordan represent debt. Do you
[52:01] understand that? All right. Go over this
[52:03] Jordan and all this people into the land
[52:05] which I do give them, even to the
[52:07] children of Israel. Every place that the
[52:09] soul of your foot shall tread upon, that
[52:11] have I given unto you, as I said unto
[52:13] Moses. That is the big print. Every
[52:18] place you put your foot is yours. Right?
[52:20] The fine print is later on. We're not
[52:22] going to read it. It says meditate on
[52:24] the word day and night to have good
[52:27] success. So if you read the the top
[52:30] print all is yours and everything that
[52:32] sounds great, that sounds good. But you
[52:34] have to always look for the fine print
[52:37] where you're going to meditate and
[52:39] you're going to think about these
[52:40] things. Isn't that right? And the other
[52:42] scripture I have from 2 Kings 2 and we
[52:45] know the story when Elijah told Elisha
[52:47] stay here and stay here and so on. But
[52:49] this these three verses here and Elijah
[52:51] said unto him t I pray thee for the Lord
[52:53] has sent me to Jordan. So the man say
[52:55] stay at Beta stay at Gal stay at Jericho
[52:58] and he said I'm not staying. Now that's
[53:01] a brother with revelation. He's not
[53:03] saying the prophet tell me stay here I
[53:05] am moving
[53:07] along. So he's still moving. He dead
[53:09] where he is. You have to move sometimes
[53:12] but you have to have revelation to move.
[53:14] And he had a revelation. He want more.
[53:16] Where that come from? Because Elijah
[53:18] took his mant and dropped it on him and
[53:19] pull it off. So something touch him.
[53:22] Something hit him and I hope something
[53:24] hit you this morning that you will want
[53:28] you would want more of where that come
[53:29] from.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me? So watch. Elijah
[53:33] said unto him, Tyrie, I pray thee for
[53:35] the Lord had sent me to Jordan. And he
[53:37] said, as the Lord liveth, as thy soul
[53:38] liveth, I will not leave thee. And the
[53:40] two went on. And 50 men of the sons of
[53:43] the prophets went and stood to view a
[53:46] far off and there two stood by Jordan.
[53:50] So there's all people to witness
[53:53] your dying.
[53:56] There will always be people to witness
[53:58] your transformation. You're not going to
[54:00] be transformed in the dark. You know you
[54:02] No, no, no. There will be people seeing
[54:04] you dying that you're changing that your
[54:06] hot not the hot mouth not so hot no more
[54:10] about 60 amen on that one
[54:16] you wouldn't be rude no more you
[54:17] wouldn't be in discipline no more all
[54:20] right so watch this and Elijah took his
[54:22] mantle wrap it together smoke the waters
[54:24] and they were divided hither and they
[54:26] two went on dry ground here we goal
[54:30] battle Jericho
[54:32] Then Jordan,
[54:35] three steps then die.
[54:38] Luther, Wesley, Pentecost, and then the
[54:41] word the corner wheat. The instruction
[54:45] was arise and go over this Jordan. So
[54:48] it's not a question if we should die. We
[54:51] have to die. It's not taught in the
[54:54] message or preach much in the message.
[54:56] What you hear your bride and you the eye
[54:58] in the bride.
[55:01] I not nothing.
[55:04] The bride is the Holy Ghost punch.
[55:07] The bride have the extra oil. The bride
[55:10] is not the foolish virgins or the stupid
[55:13] virgins.
[55:18] Brother, some of the prophets said to
[55:21] Elisha, "Do you know your master will be
[55:23] taken from you?" He say, "I know it, but
[55:25] hold your peace." He said, "I like that.
[55:27] I am going to stay right with him no
[55:29] matter what the rest of them say. Elijah
[55:32] turned around and said no you t here for
[55:33] God is sending me to Jordan then go
[55:36] around speak this three places
[55:38] justification gigal sanification the
[55:42] school of the prophets and to the
[55:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost at Jordan
[55:47] where Jordan represents death notice
[55:51] Martin Luther John Wesley Pentecost and
[55:54] down to the Jordan dying out time
[56:00] so there's There are time for you to
[56:01] receive the word. There are time for you
[56:02] to die out. You start first with
[56:04] receiving the word and hearing the word.
[56:06] You because you see, you don't know God
[56:08] until God revealed himself to you. When
[56:10] Moses brought the people out, they had
[56:12] no clue who God is. Moses met God, not
[56:15] the people. The people were following a
[56:18] prophet called Moses because he met the
[56:20] pillar of fire. But God told them,
[56:22] "Bring them to this mountain that I
[56:24] could talk to them,
[56:25] &gt;&gt; that I could show myself to them, that I
[56:28] could prove myself to them. bring them
[56:29] to this mountain.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Therefore, when the Rexi was in front of
[56:34] Moses, Moses was supposed to know better
[56:37] because when God give you a commission,
[56:39] nothing stops it. Nothing could hinder
[56:42] it. Nothing could block it. So when
[56:44] Moses began to cry, he said, "Why cry
[56:46] unto me? Speak and move forward."
[56:49] &gt;&gt; And then the rest had to open up because
[56:51] God gave him a return ticket to that
[56:54] mountain. Oh, give the Lord a shout in
[56:56] the h
[56:59] God didn't give him a one-way ticket to
[57:01] Egypt. He gave him a return ticket. Go
[57:03] to Egypt and bring them out. Bring them
[57:05] to this mountain. Hallelujah. And God
[57:09] brought us a mountain. Mount Pyramid.
[57:12] Look at there. That's the mountain we
[57:14] come to now. Oh, give the Lord a shout
[57:17] in the house.
[57:23] The third stage is coming on. The church
[57:26] still follows on.
[57:28] Elijah
[57:29] Elisha followed Elijah down to the
[57:32] Jordan. Jordan the meaning of of se is
[57:35] separation or debt. You heard many times
[57:37] when I come down to the chili Jordan.
[57:39] Jordan was dead. The Lutheran age
[57:41] followed by so did the Methodist age.
[57:44] But we come to another age now.
[57:48] I never said this before. I'm reading
[57:50] the age of dying out.
[57:57] You see Wesley was dynamics to the
[57:58] Lorra.
[58:00] Pentecost was dynamics to the Wesley.
[58:03] Every time God come on the scene, it
[58:06] changes what was passed. So when the
[58:08] word come, the Pentecostal birth was
[58:10] nothing. God pushed it back in the womb
[58:12] because now the word is required. You
[58:14] see, you can't go back and build a ark
[58:15] from like Noah's day saying rain coming.
[58:18] Young people say out of timing them.
[58:20] That was for Noah's time. You understand
[58:22] I'm saying? You have to find out what is
[58:24] promised for this day
[58:26] &gt;&gt; and fight up with God's requirement for
[58:27] this day. And this day, God requirement
[58:30] is perfection.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; I want you to say amen. Right with me
[58:34] now. Right with me now. This is not
[58:37] church. Pentecost to Jehovah Witness and
[58:39] Baptist. That's church. We're talking
[58:41] about perfection.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; We're not even talking about salvation.
[58:49] We talking about redemption. Redemption
[58:51] is to bring you back to where you were
[58:52] before.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; It goes beyond being saved. It is going
[58:56] back to what Adam had. Let us make man
[58:59] in our image, our likeness. Let that man
[59:01] have dominion over the fish, over every
[59:03] creeping thing. You have to have
[59:05] dominion. Not on the other side.
[59:07] Dominion is not for the other side. Oh,
[59:09] get the Don't get me started this
[59:10] morning. Dominion is not for the other
[59:12] side. Love and joy is not for the other
[59:15] side. You have to have it here. You have
[59:17] to exercise it here. You have to display
[59:19] here. Goodness, graciousness.
[59:26] You're mean as the devil. You're stingy
[59:28] as Satan himself. You don't want to give
[59:30] nobody nothing. When you don't give when
[59:32] you go in your side, I will give. Who
[59:35] you giving to?
[59:38] Who you deceiving?
[59:39] I could love when I love your side. I
[59:41] hate it now.
[59:45] Blood capt
[59:48] you are to want to love your enemies.
[59:52] Therefore, you can't be gossiping about
[59:53] your enemies. Oh, God. She's the enemy.
[59:54] Oh, God.
[59:57] I thought you want to love your enemies.
[59:59] God set up the enemy's face of love. But
[1:00:01] you only complain about your enemy. Oh
[1:00:02] God, the enemy of God. Are you calling
[1:00:04] this one that? Stop it. Cut it out.
[1:00:07] Enemy. How you going to love that?
[1:00:10] Let me stick you now. How you can love
[1:00:11] God who you can't see and you have a
[1:00:14] problem to love your brother and your
[1:00:16] sister who right in front of your face
[1:00:17] who next door to you who behind you. You
[1:00:19] ain't want to shake the hand. Oh, don't
[1:00:20] get me started this morning. You know
[1:00:21] you have to do better than that. You
[1:00:23] have to get more mature than that. You
[1:00:25] have to grow harder than that.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:00:48] The age of dying out.
[1:00:51] Are you ready? All your worldly
[1:00:53] pleasures. God has got to do something
[1:00:55] with you in order for he could give you
[1:00:58] the Holy Ghost. You're going to die out
[1:01:00] and get dead. You don't die. You see,
[1:01:02] that is why the message will like Mary
[1:01:04] be it done unto me according to your
[1:01:06] word. They love that.
[1:01:08] because they have no work to do there.
[1:01:12] They have no work. That's nice baptis.
[1:01:17] Yeah. Why Mary had to go in the upper
[1:01:19] room? Because B say she had to die out,
[1:01:22] you know.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; She had to get all the price. She's the
[1:01:24] mother of Jesus and you know she had to
[1:01:26] sit down next door to Mary Magdalene who
[1:01:28] had who live with who and who had who
[1:01:29] and who had who. She say Mary and B
[1:01:32] hallelujah glory and so on you know.
[1:01:36] Oh God, don't get me here. Started here
[1:01:37] this morning, you know. Amen.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; So you can't hoy and you're proud and
[1:01:44] you feel you're better than somebody.
[1:01:45] Yes. Spit them here. What? You don't
[1:01:47] care. Hallelujah. Who you think you are?
[1:01:49] You never fornicate. You never
[1:01:51] adulterate. You never not a word. But
[1:01:52] you never did. You never that that
[1:01:56] make you special.
[1:01:58] All have sinned. In case you're
[1:01:59] misreading the Bible, not some. All have
[1:02:02] sinned
[1:02:04] and come short of the glory. Behave
[1:02:07] yourself.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Even if amen.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Behave yourself righteous self.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Behave your holier than thou self.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Behave your Pharisee self.
[1:02:34] Go say amen. I still coming. I ain't
[1:02:36] done yet. I still coming. I still
[1:02:37] coming. I still come. I still on my way.
[1:02:39] I'm coming. I coming. I coming. I'm
[1:02:41] coming. God want you stripped.
[1:02:45] God want you on the cross. God want you
[1:02:48] humbled.
[1:03:05] Out of death comes life. Out of the
[1:03:08] death of Christ come the resurrection of
[1:03:10] life. And the only way you can tonight
[1:03:12] become alive of faith in God is die out
[1:03:14] to yourself and symptoms and everything
[1:03:17] around you and become alive. Die out.
[1:03:20] Die out to your symptoms. Die out to
[1:03:23] your circumstances. Die out with
[1:03:25] everything else and become alive in
[1:03:27] Christ.
[1:03:28] Sometime I was preaching about Isaac on
[1:03:30] Isaac planting in the time of famine.
[1:03:32] That just boggles my mind.
[1:03:35] Rain falling, you know. And that man dig
[1:03:38] up the ground and put the seed out.
[1:03:40] Anybody looking at him say, "You a mad
[1:03:42] man.
[1:03:43] We in dry season,
[1:03:46] famine." And he's still planting. But
[1:03:49] you know what? Isaac had faith.
[1:03:52] Faith doesn't make you look at the
[1:03:54] weather.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Faith doesn't make you look at God.
[1:03:57] Because God controlled that.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; You see, we have a responsibility, as I
[1:04:01] said on Friday, to till the ground.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; We have a responsibility to put the
[1:04:06] seed. And only God could send rain.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Man don't control rain.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; God does.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; That's why he said, "Your figures shall
[1:04:16] bring forth fruit, and I will restore,
[1:04:19] and I will send you rain in the first
[1:04:21] month, even the former rain and the
[1:04:22] latter rain. And it shall come to pass
[1:04:24] afterwards. I will pour out my spirit
[1:04:27] upon all flesh. And your son, let them
[1:04:29] laugh. Your rain is the seed is in the
[1:04:31] band. Let them laugh. The seed is inside
[1:04:34] of you, but the rain is fixing to fall.
[1:04:37] When that rain fall, life will come
[1:04:39] forth. Hallelujah. Jesus already
[1:04:41] prophesied, "Out of your belly shall
[1:04:43] flow rivers of living water." This key
[1:04:46] of the spirit.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:04:50] We not crazy here.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; This is the truth.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; This is the word.
[1:05:03] But thank you for that question.
[1:05:06] Is it? But some people waiting for
[1:05:08] pressure. There some people like that. I
[1:05:12] not accusing anybody. There some people
[1:05:15] like to um study the day before the
[1:05:17] exams. Do you know who I talking about?
[1:05:21] I I know who I talking about. I know
[1:05:23] specific
[1:05:24] all the time during the months they
[1:05:26] study close exam time final week
[1:05:31] and and they're so gifted. You know the
[1:05:32] things the study has come
[1:05:35] amazing gifted the blessed lucky I'm not
[1:05:39] talking about
[1:05:42] but
[1:05:43] you don't have to wait for circumstances
[1:05:47] to act so I will take the approach of
[1:05:51] intentional
[1:05:56] word intentional means done on purpose
[1:05:59] deliberate
[1:06:01] like some people I wouldn't say they
[1:06:03] intentionally be wicked
[1:06:06] but they do things and they doing like
[1:06:07] if they intend to do it you did intend
[1:06:09] to do it
[1:06:12] plotting and planning and
[1:06:15] I mean I'm not in that area
[1:06:20] but intentional means done on purpose
[1:06:23] being intentional means making
[1:06:26] deliberate choices
[1:06:29] to reflect what is most important to
[1:06:33] Becoming intentional can help us
[1:06:36] maintain a positive mindset, reach
[1:06:38] goals, experience more clarity. It can
[1:06:43] also increase our focus and commitment
[1:06:45] and bring more purpose and meaning to
[1:06:48] our lives.
[1:06:49] That's the problem today. People are not
[1:06:51] focused. They're mind everywhere.
[1:06:54] They're not intentional.
[1:06:57] Something intentional was done on
[1:06:59] purpose.
[1:07:01] If a crime was intentional, it was no
[1:07:04] accident.
[1:07:06] Remember,
[1:07:07] if you follow Christ, you'll be hated by
[1:07:10] people. For all that live godly in
[1:07:13] Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.
[1:07:16] If you come to Christ, you will not come
[1:07:18] by any church or denomination or creed.
[1:07:21] You'll come by the blood. That's the
[1:07:22] only avenue. You cannot bring no one
[1:07:26] with you. You will come alone and stand
[1:07:28] on your own confession and your own
[1:07:30] faith. You have to confess with your
[1:07:32] mouth. Hallelujah. Jesus Christ. You
[1:07:35] have to confess with your mouth your
[1:07:37] deliverance and your breakthrough and
[1:07:38] your healing and your blessing and
[1:07:39] restoration. You come as an individual
[1:07:42] when you come to God. And many times we
[1:07:44] make those foolish choices. Let me
[1:07:47] continue. What if Lot when he seen
[1:07:50] everything easy, he saw where there was
[1:07:52] money and popularity? We know the story.
[1:07:55] God called Abraham. Abraham bring along
[1:07:57] family and the blessing fall on Abraham
[1:08:00] family too. Family prospering or what
[1:08:01] not then fight among the horsemen.
[1:08:03] Abraham the bigger brother come and tell
[1:08:06] let's not fight. Let's let's say family
[1:08:09] we don't need that. Let us let us take
[1:08:12] take a part. You go to the east I go to
[1:08:15] the west. You you choose. God called
[1:08:17] Abraham and Abraham tell you choose.
[1:08:20] Abraham look the eyes. He look and see
[1:08:21] all the what's Sodom. He look and see
[1:08:23] all the wells. You see desert so you see
[1:08:26] what your eyes see now you see in desert
[1:08:28] so you see water and well towards so he
[1:08:30] start going this way say fine what
[1:08:35] he he because what he was a smart man
[1:08:38] what I've got faith in God I just go
[1:08:40] down into Sodom I'll make some extra
[1:08:42] money I become a great man make a
[1:08:44] wonderful preacher but you have a choice
[1:08:45] to make the ley have a choice to make
[1:08:49] but Abraham Lot didn't see his family
[1:08:51] breaking up Lot couldn't see his wife
[1:08:53] turning the assault. Lot couldn't see
[1:08:55] the secondary consequences of the
[1:08:57] decision to go to what sort of so many
[1:09:00] times our decisions and our choices have
[1:09:02] consequences that are far reaching.
[1:09:07] That's why I say ask God to lead you in
[1:09:09] your choices and decisions. Sometime the
[1:09:10] choices make it look hard but you make
[1:09:13] the right choice. It's the harder way.
[1:09:16] It's the narrow way. Sometime people
[1:09:18] mock that way and they quarrel and they
[1:09:20] try to put seeds but you stand with your
[1:09:22] choice when God lead you the way God
[1:09:24] leading you.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:28] My son Isaac and Sarah say listen I
[1:09:31] recognize do your damn don't your damn.
[1:09:33] I either do or don't. I do as I feel led
[1:09:36] because you can't please everybody.
[1:09:38] Everybody looking to be pleased. I
[1:09:40] cannot please everybody. So I please no
[1:09:41] one. I pleasing God. As long as God is
[1:09:44] happy I am happy.
[1:09:46] Who vex loss? As you say, hux loss.
[1:09:49] Hallelujah.
[1:09:51] Anytime you're catering for others, your
[1:09:52] life will be manipulated. When you're
[1:09:55] catering for others opinion and ideas,
[1:09:56] your life could be controlled. But when
[1:09:58] you hold steady with what God has
[1:10:00] revealed to you, you could stand as a
[1:10:02] rock. I shall not be moved. How David
[1:10:05] said it. Do 10,000 fall on my right
[1:10:07] side. I shall not be moved.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Look what David say. Can you come in
[1:10:14] here and get a fight with this one? A
[1:10:15] fight with that one. A fight
[1:10:19] inside here.
[1:10:22] You see a giant inside of here. Please
[1:10:24] don't leave without telling me and show
[1:10:26] me that giant.
[1:10:28] Don't come here and get fight. You know,
[1:10:29] get all your fights home and they come
[1:10:30] and come and rejoice. You fight with the
[1:10:33] deacon, you fight with the user, you
[1:10:34] fight with the preacher, you fight with
[1:10:35] the elder, you fight with everybody that
[1:10:36] people like that, you know, they come to
[1:10:38] fight. They not come for harmony. They
[1:10:39] come not come for fellowship. They come
[1:10:41] for faults.
[1:10:44] And if you want to live a false come to
[1:10:45] me I could show you. I will help you. I
[1:10:47] will show you all the falls. I know
[1:10:49] them. Yeah. I will help you. Come and
[1:10:51] see and all. Yeah. I will help you. I
[1:10:53] will escort you. Then you escort you
[1:10:55] straight out.
[1:10:59] If I can't understand people criticizing
[1:11:00] this preacher, criticize him, criticize,
[1:11:02] criticize it. But what they're doing,
[1:11:04] they're criticizing the preachers all
[1:11:05] around.
[1:11:07] So the people will tell theelves that
[1:11:08] man
[1:11:11] everybody else all he right everybody
[1:11:13] else wrong he's right because the people
[1:11:16] that's what cutting the mind this one
[1:11:17] off that one off that one off that one
[1:11:19] off that if Christ was doing like that
[1:11:21] when you see Peter so he
[1:11:28] Jesus was in the same vein of how we
[1:11:30] think
[1:11:34] he will deny me I want
[1:11:37] Brother,
[1:11:43] I ain't going to use Paul because you
[1:11:45] fight the church.
[1:11:49] God said, "My thoughts are not your
[1:11:50] thoughts. My ways are not your ways.
[1:11:54] People who you think not going to make
[1:11:55] it, they're going to make it. People you
[1:11:57] think wouldn't come, they're going to
[1:11:58] come. People you think God wouldn't
[1:12:00] deliver, God will deliver.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; I look how hard it is. Don't look at
[1:12:05] that."
[1:12:07] Hallelujah.
[1:12:08] Thank you. Thank you for amen to that.
[1:12:10] You say amen to me. Amen to the word.
[1:12:13] The lady has a choice to make. I going
[1:12:15] to sit in church and everybody in
[1:12:17] tongues thinks is the best church and
[1:12:18] mayor of the city belongs to this
[1:12:19] church. But you still have to judge that
[1:12:22] church and its people by the scriptures.
[1:12:24] Notice this. Abraham the only thing he
[1:12:28] could do was to take a second choice.
[1:12:32] Sometimes the second choice is better
[1:12:35] than the first.
[1:12:38] I get two on that.
[1:12:40] Abraham could I take first choice. You
[1:12:42] know people just see one man just right
[1:12:45] now to get the front of the picture
[1:12:47] easy. I wouldn't call his name
[1:12:51] among world leaders and
[1:12:54] so Abraham could say listen God called
[1:12:56] me. I am the man that God has called
[1:12:59] Lot. and go behave yourself. Go in that
[1:13:02] corner there. And Abraham straightened
[1:13:04] Lot and put Lot in his place.
[1:13:08] You hear me? But what did Abraham do?
[1:13:10] Lot you choose. Give Lot first choice.
[1:13:14] Give Abraham second choice. And Abraham
[1:13:17] take second choice. And second choice
[1:13:19] are better than first choice. So
[1:13:21] sometimes stop complaining. I was the
[1:13:22] first choice. I was the first choice.
[1:13:23] Cut that crap out. I just read for you.
[1:13:26] Second choice is better than first
[1:13:27] choice because second choice put you in
[1:13:29] God's plan in God's program. Lot got
[1:13:32] messed up. His family got messed up. His
[1:13:35] wife turned a pillar of salt. Stop
[1:13:36] complaining. God saving you from
[1:13:38] yourself. Okay. The Lord a shout in the
[1:13:40] house. Hallelujah.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:13:45] But
[1:13:48] it only notice it wasn't long. Lot seen
[1:13:50] a big city. He didn't see his wife turn
[1:13:51] the pillar of salt. Though he didn't see
[1:13:52] the fire burning of the city. But
[1:13:54] Abraham took the way of the lost his
[1:13:55] wife. He stayed in the desert. So being
[1:13:58] intentional
[1:14:00] is living purposefully,
[1:14:02] deliberately,
[1:14:04] and in alignment with God's word and
[1:14:06] will. You get up in the morning, you're
[1:14:08] not
[1:14:10] doing
[1:14:11] poke, you're nothing. You can't wake up
[1:14:14] in the morning and start to figure out
[1:14:15] what you're going to do. Your planning
[1:14:17] should be the night before.
[1:14:21] I want to hear more amens than that.
[1:14:23] Your planning for your tomorrow day is
[1:14:24] supposed to be the day before.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; You can't wake up on Sunday morning to
[1:14:28] plan to go to church.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Six. Amen.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; When you're living intentional, you have
[1:14:39] to write down things
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; because your peanut brains are going to
[1:14:43] remember everything. I don't put nothing
[1:14:46] up there.
[1:14:51] Don't think I'm a joking because had
[1:14:52] something to get this morning. I put
[1:14:53] that inside my phone.
[1:14:55] He gave me an alarm because in my bag
[1:14:59] and if I come with it in my bag and I
[1:15:00] don't give it to him, I'll forget. But
[1:15:02] when it pop up, so I put it alarm at
[1:15:04] 10:00
[1:15:07] pop up soon as they come in the office
[1:15:10] for you that done my brain too much to
[1:15:14] deal with. So I have this Google form.
[1:15:20] I just offload everything on that so my
[1:15:23] brain's clear to get fresh inspiration.
[1:15:27] I don't want my brain having a hole. I
[1:15:29] had to go to the bank. I had to go here.
[1:15:30] I had to visit once here. No, my brain I
[1:15:32] I don't my brain have all them things.
[1:15:38] Some of you know what that is for. Okay,
[1:15:41] this morning offload
[1:15:45] I remember the church was about six
[1:15:47] seven people and boy was pressure
[1:15:48] thunder
[1:15:52] said Lord Jesus
[1:15:54] I wouldn't say was terrorism but was
[1:15:56] quite a charact
[1:15:58] one day I said Lord Jesus I put it into
[1:16:01] your hands I offload them and after that
[1:16:04] never pick them up again
[1:16:07] for
[1:16:12] So being intentional is living
[1:16:14] purposefully,
[1:16:16] deliberately in alignment with God's
[1:16:19] word and his will. The opposite is
[1:16:22] living by reacting,
[1:16:24] acting by impulse, acting by feelings,
[1:16:28] emotions, drifting on the sea of life or
[1:16:31] just reacting.
[1:16:34] The Bible said lazy man. He said there's
[1:16:36] a land in the street. That's why he not
[1:16:39] going out. He pull the sheet over and
[1:16:41] take an X.
[1:16:44] Okay.
[1:16:45] So this is to live on purpose
[1:16:48] not by chance but by forethought. This
[1:16:52] is you choosing to obey. This is you
[1:16:55] choosing obedience on purpose not by
[1:16:59] chance. Choice is a great thing. In many
[1:17:02] things of life we have a given choice.
[1:17:04] The way of life itself is a choice. We
[1:17:06] have a right to make our own way. Choose
[1:17:08] our own way that we want to live.
[1:17:10] Education is a choice. We can choose
[1:17:12] whether we going to be educated or
[1:17:14] whether we are not going to be educated.
[1:17:16] That's a choice. Right and wrong is a
[1:17:18] choice. Every man, every woman, boy or
[1:17:21] girl has to choose whether they are
[1:17:23] going to try to live right or not live
[1:17:25] right. It's a choice. Choice is a great
[1:17:28] thing. And your eternal destination is a
[1:17:31] choice. And maybe tonight some of you
[1:17:33] might make that choice where you will
[1:17:34] spend eternity before this service might
[1:17:36] end tonight. There'll be one time if you
[1:17:38] turn God down many times. There'll be
[1:17:40] one time you will turn him down the last
[1:17:42] time. This is the line between mercy and
[1:17:44] judgment. It's a dangerous thing for a
[1:17:47] man or woman boy or girl to step across
[1:17:49] that line. There's no return. There's
[1:17:50] another choice we have in life. The life
[1:17:53] a life companion. A young man, a young
[1:17:55] woman stepping out on life has been
[1:17:57] given a right to make a choice. The
[1:17:59] young man chooses. The young woman has a
[1:18:01] right to accept or reject. It's still a
[1:18:04] choice on both sides. Both man and
[1:18:06] woman, they have a right to choose. And
[1:18:07] you have a choice as a Christian. You
[1:18:10] have a choice of the church. Choose any
[1:18:12] church you want to belong to. That's
[1:18:14] your choice. There's nobody can tell you
[1:18:16] or make you come to a certain church.
[1:18:19] That is our freedom. Every man can
[1:18:21] choose for himself. Freedom of religion
[1:18:23] is a great thing. Then he said his word,
[1:18:25] God, help us to keep it as long as we
[1:18:27] can. So when you choose this church, you
[1:18:29] can choose whether you were in this
[1:18:30] church, whether you will choose a church
[1:18:32] that will guide you to eternal
[1:18:33] destination. You can choose a church
[1:18:35] that has a certain creed that you might
[1:18:37] think that creed is just what you want
[1:18:39] or the other church has their creed. And
[1:18:41] then there's the word of God. You have a
[1:18:43] choice. You have to make that choice.
[1:18:45] There's some people love the church.
[1:18:46] There's some people love the word. The
[1:18:48] church people love the church. They love
[1:18:50] the pastor. They love everything and
[1:18:51] whatnot. They in church. They are the
[1:18:53] same as Catholics in the message. They
[1:18:56] are same as Baptist in the message. The
[1:18:58] Catholic they go they go and play the
[1:19:00] cannival. They come and get the ashes
[1:19:02] and they get normal normal. They go to
[1:19:03] church. They're not missing mass.
[1:19:06] And you missing mass.
[1:19:13] The people come, they smoke up the place
[1:19:14] and whatnot. They do all that ritual
[1:19:17] light and they smoke and they sing him
[1:19:20] and do things like that. People feel
[1:19:23] religious
[1:19:25] and Thousands go to that every single
[1:19:27] Sunday.
[1:19:30] I know I was part of it.
[1:19:34] I was an acolyte.
[1:19:38] All right. So you watching a here
[1:19:40] exacolyte.
[1:19:45] I come out and become I come out to walk
[1:19:47] in the light.
[1:19:52] Okay, here we are. So watch. I believe
[1:19:55] it was Elijah one time at Mont Caramel
[1:19:58] with the showdown. But there will come a
[1:20:00] time when you will have to make a
[1:20:01] choice. And you men here, he said the
[1:20:06] hour going to come or you're going to
[1:20:07] make a choice. You're going to either go
[1:20:09] to go to World Council or you're going
[1:20:11] to go into the denominational or you're
[1:20:13] not going to be at the nomination
[1:20:14] anymore. You're going to have to do
[1:20:15] that. That choice is coming soon.
[1:20:19] It's a dangerous time to wait till the
[1:20:21] last hour because you might take on
[1:20:23] something that you could never shake out
[1:20:24] of it.
[1:20:28] And you talk about the jubilee when the
[1:20:29] jubilee comes and the priest road song
[1:20:31] to go free. And people don't want to
[1:20:32] hear and go free. They had their ears
[1:20:34] bored and they could hear it and they
[1:20:36] can't go free anymore. Elijah said,
[1:20:37] "Choose you this day whom you shall
[1:20:39] serve. If God be God, serve him. If Baal
[1:20:42] be God, serve him." So I think I want to
[1:20:44] conclude there. So listen, Jordan
[1:20:46] crossing Jordan dead has to be
[1:20:48] intentional.
[1:20:50] When they was trying to press Jesus one
[1:20:51] time, she said, "My hour is not yet
[1:20:52] come." In other words, you can't touch
[1:20:53] me. You can't hold me. When his hour
[1:20:56] come, he said, "My hour is now come."
[1:20:58] Jesus whole temple changed because now
[1:21:01] he know he set out towards Calvary. So
[1:21:03] the first part of his ministry casting
[1:21:05] out devils, healing the sick,
[1:21:07] multiplying the bread and fish and so
[1:21:08] on, healing the people and so on,
[1:21:09] blessing them and so on. He knew he was
[1:21:11] on a mission. He knew this path was
[1:21:13] temporary. He knew it's coming to a
[1:21:15] purpose. He told the disciples privately
[1:21:17] if I don't go, the comforter will not
[1:21:18] come. I will not give you
[1:21:19] comfortlessness. I have to go. But I
[1:21:21] send him back something. I have to go
[1:21:23] for it to come. So don't try to hold me
[1:21:25] back. I have to go for it to come. If I
[1:21:27] don't go, it will not come. If I don't
[1:21:28] go, it will not come. You have to wait
[1:21:30] for it to come.
[1:21:32] Give the Lord some praises. So when he
[1:21:34] rose from the dead, he start to talk to
[1:21:37] them and tell them, "Behold, I send the
[1:21:39] promise of my father upon you. carry in
[1:21:41] the city of Jerusalem until you get
[1:21:43] power from on high. You need power to
[1:21:45] deal with them devils. You need power to
[1:21:47] deal with your children. You need power
[1:21:49] to deal with that husband, with that
[1:21:50] wife, oh, with that family, with that
[1:21:52] boss. You need power to deal with them
[1:21:54] sex spirits and all them demons that
[1:21:55] have out there. You need power in your
[1:21:57] life.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. Then you
[1:22:02] come to church and be empowered.
[1:22:11] Let's go.
[1:22:15] All right.
[1:22:19] John 12 20-24 scripture. And there were
[1:22:23] certain greets among them that came to
[1:22:24] worship at the feast.
[1:22:26] The same came therefore to Philillip
[1:22:28] which is a basa of Galilee and desired
[1:22:30] him saying sir we worship Jesus.
[1:22:33] Philip comes telling Andrew again. And
[1:22:36] John Philip tell Jesus and Jesus
[1:22:38] answered them saying the hour is come
[1:22:42] that the son of man shall be glorified.
[1:22:45] Verily I verily I say unto you except a
[1:22:47] corner we fall into the ground and die
[1:22:50] it abideth alone but if it die it
[1:22:52] bringeth forth much fruit.
[1:22:55] So these people come to see Jesus and
[1:22:57] one is sealed. Why? They heard about it.
[1:23:00] So the hearing part wasn't the issue.
[1:23:03] Faith come by hearing hearing the word.
[1:23:05] The issue wasn't what they heard. They
[1:23:08] didn't come to hear about him or hear
[1:23:10] him. They wanted to see him or meet him.
[1:23:13] They came to the disciple and unlike
[1:23:16] these modern disciples now taking um let
[1:23:19] me tell you about it. But
[1:23:23] that's not what they did. He said these
[1:23:26] disciples representing the true five
[1:23:28] ministry bring the seeker to Christ.
[1:23:33] All right, let's go.
[1:23:35] He said, "Except a corner be fallen to
[1:23:37] the ground and die that alone. If you
[1:23:39] want to bring forth fruit, here we go.
[1:23:41] Die to yourself and your own man-made
[1:23:44] theology and be born again of the spirit
[1:23:47] and the resurrection." That's right. Get
[1:23:49] rid of that old spirit of selfishness
[1:23:53] and dryness that is in you.
[1:23:56] Take on new life. There are too many
[1:23:59] people just coming to church hearing and
[1:24:00] going back home. They're not even
[1:24:02] examining what they are hearing as a
[1:24:06] applied to themselves.
[1:24:09] When you hear this here old spirit of
[1:24:11] selfishness,
[1:24:13] you have to examine yourself.
[1:24:18] You have an antisocial spirit. Got to
[1:24:20] examine yourself. You can't mix.
[1:24:24] You can't. So, what happened to heaven?
[1:24:27] Heaven play. You up by seven heaven.
[1:24:31] mixing. Stay down here with that. That
[1:24:34] can't make heaven.
[1:24:36] You follow what I'm saying? So, we have
[1:24:38] to come out of us. You have to come out
[1:24:41] of your Trinidad thing.
[1:24:43] Some people love the train. I want to
[1:24:45] get on that a
[1:24:48] that terrible train. It's terrible
[1:24:50] train.
[1:24:52] Don't fool yourself.
[1:24:56] One man say that bride had perfected by
[1:24:59] train flesh.
[1:25:02] That come from the botless pit of hell.
[1:25:05] That the kind of demon doctrines of
[1:25:07] devils that was better in this message.
[1:25:09] Train that bride has been fed by train
[1:25:11] flesh. Flesh flesh.
[1:25:15] You're crazy.
[1:25:19] All right. Unless a grain of corn falls
[1:25:22] into the ground and rots. Unless a man
[1:25:24] rots to his own theology. Listen to this
[1:25:28] now. So they heard that God was using
[1:25:32] used this miracle work in Hebrew, God in
[1:25:34] the land. This is Greeks. So it
[1:25:35] attracted the attention to come to see
[1:25:37] Jesus. And notice usually the way that
[1:25:41] people want to find Jesus is to find
[1:25:42] somebody who knows how to take them to
[1:25:44] him. And if he ever chooses a servant,
[1:25:48] he always chooses somebody that will
[1:25:49] bring the people to him. We find that
[1:25:52] here we go. They brought they were
[1:25:55] brought into his presence. How much
[1:25:58] years of human preaching that this is
[1:25:59] what the people need to get into not
[1:26:02] into theology, not into mystery and all
[1:26:05] kind of revelations, but to come into
[1:26:06] presence.
[1:26:08] The fight is to get you into presence.
[1:26:10] In the Old Testament was dead to go in
[1:26:12] now is dead to be outside his presence.
[1:26:14] The churches are struck by the kangali
[1:26:16] with spiritual debt. That why they sit
[1:26:17] dead in church this morning.
[1:26:20] And the excuses the preaching mysteries
[1:26:22] and the preaching histories and
[1:26:23] revelation
[1:26:25] four hours burning out the people
[1:26:28] weary after that jars as a biscuit.
[1:26:33] No worship, no atmosphere, no moisture.
[1:26:35] And the prophet taught us it will take
[1:26:37] the water. The water the water is the
[1:26:40] praises.
[1:26:42] When you worship, you create an
[1:26:44] atmosphere on the seed that you're
[1:26:46] receiving.
[1:26:51] If you keep quiet, you fall in the
[1:26:53] amorph. You just fall asleep just cool,
[1:26:55] cool, cool. And an angel, some angel
[1:26:56] will come and find some air condition
[1:26:58] breeze right over you there. And your
[1:26:59] top lip got sealed up there and then
[1:27:00] your head just n day and no word going
[1:27:04] subconscious and you're dead as a don
[1:27:05] inside the church. Go and put a
[1:27:07] toothpick and open your eye. Go and wash
[1:27:09] your face and come back up or something.
[1:27:11] But start to give God praise and create
[1:27:12] atmosphere. You wouldn't do that in
[1:27:14] football. You wouldn't do that for
[1:27:16] cricket. You went do your house and
[1:27:17] you're watching cricket. You went be
[1:27:19] dead. Oh god. Goal or cricket or ball. I
[1:27:21] don't know football or whatnot. Or
[1:27:22] cricket or score or you know wicket.
[1:27:24] Wicket wicket.
[1:27:33] World Cup is
[1:27:35] people looking good.
[1:27:39] I say that
[1:27:42] thousand of people they paint their
[1:27:43] face. They paint the color. They they
[1:27:46] call it the flag and whatnot. They're in
[1:27:47] the spirit. They're in the atmosphere of
[1:27:49] it. When you come to service, you have
[1:27:51] to come to see your goal.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; You have to come to see Jesus score. You
[1:27:56] have to come to see miracles and signs
[1:27:57] and wonders. You have to come out of
[1:27:58] expectation. You have to come out of the
[1:28:00] excitement. Your hand all them in the
[1:28:01] stadium with your hand going so and make
[1:28:04] a look at the old noise. They don't know
[1:28:06] what they worshiping. But we know what
[1:28:08] we worship. We know who we worship. We
[1:28:11] know why we worship. Oh, give the Lord
[1:28:13] some praises.
[1:28:15] Let Jesus call that goal this morning.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You come here
[1:28:24] with no plane ticket.
[1:28:27] You got to go and get no visa to go to
[1:28:29] America cuz you know the problems with
[1:28:31] the visa thing already
[1:28:34] right here. You can get in the
[1:28:36] atmosphere right here. Don't know what
[1:28:39] the preacher have to do with you.
[1:28:43] The woman with the blood issue wasn't
[1:28:44] bothered by all those big hulking men
[1:28:47] standing there with no faith whatsoever.
[1:28:49] She wasn't bothered by the sisters who
[1:28:51] come into gossip and mock and whatnot.
[1:28:52] She wasn't bothered by the crowd around
[1:28:54] Jesus. She was concerned that the blood
[1:28:56] issue need to be stopped. She was
[1:28:58] concerned that she needed a healing. She
[1:29:00] was concerned she needed a breakthrough
[1:29:03] and nothing was going to stop her this
[1:29:05] morning. Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:29:08] When you get that focus, when you got
[1:29:10] the determination, when you got that
[1:29:11] intention, she was intentional. Oh,
[1:29:13] glory look good. She said, "If I could
[1:29:15] touch the hem of his garment, I'll be
[1:29:17] made whole." Give the Lord some praises.
[1:29:20] That woman was intentional.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; She wasn't going by her feelings. She
[1:29:33] told herself something. And when she
[1:29:36] come to court around Jesus, If she was
[1:29:38] in the feeling, she say I'll come back
[1:29:39] tomorrow less unbeliefless people.
[1:29:42] Tomorrow wasn't coming. She said, "Today
[1:29:44] is the day." When she left the house,
[1:29:46] she said, "Today is the day. I want you
[1:29:48] to leave your house like that.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; I want you to come to church like that.
[1:29:50] Stop coming to church. Stay home.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; If you don't have an expectation, stay
[1:29:54] home. We don't begging you to be in your
[1:29:55] church. You come here by your choice.
[1:29:57] You come here because you want something
[1:29:59] from God. You come here to teach the
[1:30:01] pastor. You come here to explain nothing
[1:30:02] to the pastor. You come here to show the
[1:30:04] pastor nothing.
[1:30:06] You come here because you need help. You
[1:30:08] come here because you need a
[1:30:09] breakthrough. You come here because you
[1:30:11] need deliverance.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:30:24] I was expecting a better sermon than
[1:30:26] that this morning. You know, go with
[1:30:27] expectation.
[1:30:30] I'm not here to fulfill your
[1:30:31] expectation.
[1:30:37] So they brought them into Jesus presence
[1:30:42] not the vials wolves trumpets and when
[1:30:44] the man finish so that why Paul said I
[1:30:46] come to you not with enticing words
[1:30:49] because I don't want your faith rest on
[1:30:50] me I your faith rest on the power of God
[1:30:53] so I come to bring that you will impress
[1:30:55] my my my my explanation and revelation
[1:30:58] when your friends so I see I have been
[1:31:00] in meetings where people just shake
[1:31:01] their
[1:31:02] shake their head not because they
[1:31:03] believe Not not because they getting
[1:31:05] revelation. It's because unbelief taken
[1:31:07] them. They don't even know what the man
[1:31:08] saying. I see men I don't think they're
[1:31:11] conscious of it. They're scratching
[1:31:12] their heads though. Do you understand?
[1:31:18] Totally confused.
[1:31:20] And God is a God of clarity.
[1:31:23] If you ain't get nothing else, get this.
[1:31:25] God wants to get it to you clear. When
[1:31:28] you have clarity as a business person,
[1:31:30] as an individual, as a teacher, lawyer,
[1:31:32] what clarity is clear before you, you
[1:31:34] could effectively execute.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; But punch know if a mechanic doing
[1:31:40] something and he can't get through. He
[1:31:42] don't know what going on here and he get
[1:31:44] something and he unfold and what what
[1:31:46] it's clear.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Break this nut, break this nut, do this,
[1:31:48] put this here, put this here. It's over
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; because they get clarity.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; What did Habac say? Write the vision.
[1:31:55] Make it plain
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; that you will reach and run.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Not make it complex.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. Make it
[1:32:03] plain.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; God loves clarity.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Vision brings clarity.
[1:32:17] That why Jesus operate by vision. That
[1:32:20] Bible said without a vision you perish.
[1:32:22] Vision means you before it happens.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; This church is built by vision. What you
[1:32:32] see here was vision materialize.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; I ask you on Friday to say and repeat
[1:32:43] after me, make me a revival.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Let the revival be in me.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Revival for the church. You know, you
[1:32:49] you
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; individual.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're poor father, poor
[1:32:55] mother, poor husband, poor wife. But
[1:32:58] make me a revival.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; It will change your whole atmosphere
[1:33:02] around you.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; You were brought into the presence of
[1:33:13] Abraham. Just as soon as these Greeks
[1:33:17] was pointed to Jesus, Jesus did not
[1:33:19] point to himself.
[1:33:22] So why all these ministers pointing the
[1:33:24] church
[1:33:26] never say aha they want to see me I am
[1:33:29] you know I'm Jesus oh I'm so glad to
[1:33:31] meet you God bless you no Jesus didn't
[1:33:34] do that listen to this
[1:33:37] he did not make himself known to them
[1:33:40] because you cannot know Jesus in that
[1:33:43] way Jesus is known in that way but we
[1:33:47] see here in the scripture when the
[1:33:50] Greeks was brought up to Jesus Jesus.
[1:33:52] Here we go. And was in his presence.
[1:33:55] We're not talking about brought up to
[1:33:56] books and tapes and I believe the
[1:33:58] message. We're not talking about that.
[1:34:00] We're talking about beyond the word.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; We're talking about presence.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; See why we fighting for? That's why I
[1:34:08] say praise God, worship God. Because
[1:34:11] normally and naturally, you're not into
[1:34:12] that. You in your flesh, you're in
[1:34:14] yourself.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; You're in your human.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; But to praise God is to defy gravity, to
[1:34:20] lift your hand. Say, "Praise him."
[1:34:22] Praise him in the good time. Praise him
[1:34:24] in the bad time. Hallelujah. Praising is
[1:34:26] not about you. It's about who he is.
[1:34:29] Worship is not about you. It's about who
[1:34:31] God is. He's the object of worship.
[1:34:34] Hallelujah. Whether things working out
[1:34:35] or not, you're still worshiping. Then
[1:34:37] the God could say, "Look at them. They
[1:34:39] worshiping me regardless. They cut their
[1:34:42] pay, they worship. They lost their job.
[1:34:44] They worship. They get two flat tires
[1:34:47] and they're still worshiping. I have to
[1:34:49] bless that person. I have to back that
[1:34:51] person up. Let the angels go forward.
[1:34:54] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; You think that farfetched? Let me tell
[1:34:59] you something. Don't the bros
[1:35:02] shaken.
[1:35:04] God didn't tell them how whism
[1:35:07] praying, busting the door open. They
[1:35:09] wasn't backst
[1:35:23] and show I raise their hands. I wouldn't
[1:35:24] ask that
[1:35:27] three times a day and they make a
[1:35:29] commandment because them jealous them
[1:35:30] fellas and them fell so blessed they
[1:35:32] want to out the light and when them fell
[1:35:34] the commandment bust it open let them
[1:35:37] hear him pray
[1:35:39] normal
[1:35:41] when they say we go send in the fire
[1:35:43] they say no problem they answer you know
[1:35:46] if you're not in the faith
[1:35:49] think about it a call this evening at
[1:35:52] 4:00 not fellow No call 4:00. He said,
[1:35:55] "We want to let you know we not go bow.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; We're not bowing down."
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Take us one time. We not
[1:36:03] bowing down. Our God is God. He is able
[1:36:06] to deliver us. Listen. The angels heard
[1:36:08] it.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Did you hear what I said? The angels.
[1:36:13] That means your words does bust through
[1:36:15] dimensions. Hey, your words move from
[1:36:19] natural into supernatural. The angels
[1:36:21] heard that. Brother Brandham said the
[1:36:24] angel controlling water said let me go
[1:36:25] down and next say I want to go down too.
[1:36:28] Everybody want to go down because that
[1:36:30] testimony rock in heaven we are not
[1:36:32] going to bow down. Our able God is able
[1:36:34] to deliver us. And if we don't deliver
[1:36:36] us we are not going to back out. Our God
[1:36:39] is able to send dynamics. Our God is
[1:36:41] able to send down fire. Our able is God
[1:36:43] going to send down miracles. We are not
[1:36:45] going to back down. We are not going to
[1:36:47] give up.
[1:36:49] Listen,
[1:36:55] you may be seated. It was so impressive.
[1:36:58] God has tell them, "Hold back, hold
[1:36:59] back, hold back. I going down myself."
[1:37:02] Hallelujah. I going down myself. And
[1:37:04] when they push them fellas in the fire,
[1:37:06] their bands were loosed and they saw a
[1:37:08] fourth man. They threw three men in the
[1:37:10] fire. They saw a fourth man in the fire.
[1:37:13] Oh, he said it looked like the son of
[1:37:15] God. When devil want to push you in his
[1:37:17] fire, God going to step into your fire.
[1:37:20] God going to step into your trial. God
[1:37:22] going to step into your condition.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Come on saints, have faith in God.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. I believe the angels
[1:37:41] are looking in. I believe angels looking
[1:37:44] into this service this morning.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; I believe the pillar of fire is here.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; I believe God give us the uncction to
[1:37:50] function. Hallelujah. I believe God
[1:37:52] given us the uncction to speak.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I believe that
[1:37:57] God given us what to say.
[1:38:08] as soon as they were brought into his
[1:38:11] presence. That's the main thing. Get the
[1:38:14] people in his presence.
[1:38:19] I told his ministers in M right that I
[1:38:21] said I don't want to hear all the
[1:38:22] revelations. I want to hear what the
[1:38:23] prophet say.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; I don't want to hear no private
[1:38:27] revelation. God sent a prophet for me to
[1:38:29] bring a private revelation. God bring me
[1:38:32] God has sent me to do that. I dream last
[1:38:34] night and dream last night and that
[1:38:36] certain things I don't touch. I touching
[1:38:38] the star, the moon, the comet and I
[1:38:40] don't touch them things at all. They
[1:38:42] have enough external signs for people to
[1:38:43] fight up with. I want to know what's
[1:38:44] supposed to be inside are here.
[1:38:47] I want to know what is the bright sign.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; It have people food is on astrology and
[1:38:54] diet of of stars and Venus and Mars and
[1:38:57] where this is this blue blood moon and
[1:38:59] all kind. I blood moon, stars, water,
[1:39:01] then I might call them.
[1:39:04] Oh, Rome doing what? Putin doing what?
[1:39:05] All them doing the thing. I want to do
[1:39:08] my thing.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; The thing that God want me to do. Putin
[1:39:11] do anything. I got Trump doing anything.
[1:39:13] Anybody doing the thing?
[1:39:17] Trump say and back down. He could do
[1:39:19] that. We can't do that. God can't do
[1:39:22] that. When God says thing, he don't back
[1:39:24] down on it. He said, "My word shall not
[1:39:27] return unto me void."
[1:39:28] God don't back down when he said his
[1:39:30] thing. He said seven thunders of bright
[1:39:32] revival. He can't back down on that.
[1:39:34] Hey, glory to God. I don't care who
[1:39:38] don't want to say it. I'm saying it
[1:39:40] because you can find where it's written.
[1:39:42] You can find where it's spoken. Seven
[1:39:44] tunnels is the bride revival. That is
[1:39:46] not for the church. The church have no
[1:39:48] revival to get. But the bride, oh, give
[1:39:52] the Lord a shout. Those seven voices
[1:39:55] will be made known to the true church.
[1:39:58] Could I hear shout tabernacle?
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:40:09] Glory.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:13] Where there is God, there is noise.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; No noise. No God. Wherever Jesus is
[1:40:19] hosana. Hosana. Hosana.
[1:40:25] Give the Lord some praises. I am not
[1:40:28] ashamed of the son of man. Know his
[1:40:30] words. I am not ashamed of this message.
[1:40:33] I am not ashamed of this gospel.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; That's the main thing.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; What's the main thing? Get the people in
[1:40:50] his presence.
[1:40:52] As soon as in his presence Jesus said
[1:40:56] except a corner of wheat falls to the
[1:40:57] ground and die it's abide alone. What an
[1:41:00] unusual thing. Instead of accepting the
[1:41:02] introduction the thing he done was
[1:41:05] pointing them to the place where they
[1:41:07] could find him.
[1:41:10] He pointed them to that great truth how
[1:41:13] to see him. They could not see him in
[1:41:16] that eternal life standing there the way
[1:41:18] he was. He was a man. But he pointed
[1:41:21] them in his presence Christ. Oh, I now
[1:41:24] get it. Because the people not coming
[1:41:27] into presence, they're not seeing
[1:41:30] Calvary
[1:41:32] where they're supposed to go and die
[1:41:34] to see Jesus. So then they fall in love
[1:41:37] with the church. They fall in love with
[1:41:40] the doctrine of the church. The creed.
[1:41:42] That's the creed. You know, Catholic
[1:41:44] church have decreed that messes with the
[1:41:46] creed. You see?
[1:41:50] He pointed them there in his presence.
[1:41:51] Christ pointed them to the truth. He
[1:41:54] said how to see him was to go to the
[1:41:57] cross except a corner wheat falls. It
[1:42:00] abides alone. And if he did not die,
[1:42:03] listen with Christ now. If he did not
[1:42:06] die, he would have to abide alone
[1:42:08] himself. If he did not die, but him
[1:42:11] being the corner wheat that fell into
[1:42:13] the ground, then if it falls into the
[1:42:15] ground, it will bring forth an
[1:42:17] abundance. If it falls into the ground
[1:42:19] and die, first it has to be a germatized
[1:42:22] grain.
[1:42:23] That means have to be a grain with the
[1:42:25] spirit baptism in it to be a corner
[1:42:28] wheat.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; So first you have to identify what this
[1:42:31] corner wheat is. He said first it must
[1:42:34] be a Germanized grain or it won't bring
[1:42:35] forth nothing. But he had to give his
[1:42:37] own life in order to bring forth life.
[1:42:40] So Jesus wasn't just going across to die
[1:42:42] just to die for the sins of man. He was
[1:42:44] dying to release life. He said, "I come
[1:42:47] that you might have life and have it
[1:42:48] more abundantly if the devil only knew."
[1:42:52] What was Jesus was going to do? He was
[1:42:54] going to let Jesus die of old age. He
[1:42:56] was going to let not one blood drop a
[1:42:57] blood drop a blood fall from Jesus. But
[1:43:00] when he died and that blood cell was
[1:43:02] broken and the life was released, that
[1:43:04] life went throughout all the earth.
[1:43:06] Seven perfect spirits hunting them
[1:43:09] seeds. That spirit found you in
[1:43:11] Trinidad. Oh, glory to God. That Holy
[1:43:14] Spirit found you. Oh, glory to God.
[1:43:17] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:43:20] Hallelujah.
[1:43:21] He got a hold of me and he won't let me
[1:43:24] go. He got a hold of you and he won't
[1:43:28] let you go. Hallelujah. Praise God. But
[1:43:32] Abraham,
[1:43:34] he said, "Watch you." You say, "How
[1:43:36] could one grain of wheat?" Here's what
[1:43:37] happens. One grain falls in, it bring
[1:43:40] forth 100 grain. 100 G falls in, it
[1:43:43] bring forth a thousand grain. A thousand
[1:43:45] grain fall in, it bring forth a million.
[1:43:47] A million great falls in, it bring forth
[1:43:49] a badge load. On and on until it feeds
[1:43:52] the whole world. That is what he meant.
[1:43:54] If I live my life alone and when I'm
[1:43:57] reading it, think about you. Think about
[1:43:59] your selfishness. Think how selfish you
[1:44:01] have been all these years. Right now,
[1:44:03] selfish is like bloodstream running
[1:44:04] through you.
[1:44:06] Don't say amen now.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; I still coming.
[1:44:10] They not for everybody here. They for
[1:44:12] the selfish one among us. And you know
[1:44:14] who you are.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; You want me to come punch you out?
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; I don't have authorities.
[1:44:21] I don't know what I don't know who
[1:44:23] selfish selfish.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; So don't get frightened about but you
[1:44:26] coming for me coming from me. Yes, you.
[1:44:28] The word coming for you. Don't believe
[1:44:29] me? All right. So here if I live my life
[1:44:32] alone and die this way and just live my
[1:44:35] life alone, there will be no fruit after
[1:44:37] me. But if I fall into the ground under
[1:44:41] the will of God, here we go. I will
[1:44:43] bring forth a new birth. And in that new
[1:44:46] birth, it will bring forth another with
[1:44:48] a new birth. another with a new birth
[1:44:51] until the whole world will be
[1:44:53] missionared and gospel preached. So he
[1:44:56] was showing that the death of Christ is
[1:44:59] what made a way for the 120 in the upper
[1:45:02] room. And when they died out, they made
[1:45:04] a way for 3,000 to be saved. And that is
[1:45:07] how it keep multiplying because they
[1:45:10] were genuinely converted by the spirit.
[1:45:13] When the Holy Ghost fell on Cornelius's
[1:45:15] house upon Cornelius, he said the Holy
[1:45:18] Ghost the The same Holy Ghost that fell
[1:45:21] on us fell on them. That man was never
[1:45:24] even baptized yet. He got baptized after
[1:45:27] he got the Holy Ghost because of his
[1:45:29] heart condition. His heart was right.
[1:45:32] His heart was ready. He was a given man.
[1:45:36] God recognized his giving. His gift of
[1:45:39] giving. The Bible said arms was
[1:45:41] recorded. And that man was never in
[1:45:44] church, never hear a spoke word, listen
[1:45:46] to a tape, read a spoke word book,
[1:45:52] but God sent Peter to him. Hallelujah.
[1:45:56] Let's go. You will never see him by
[1:45:58] joining the church. Some book of laws
[1:46:00] you keep, some creeds that you serve,
[1:46:02] you will see him when you die.
[1:46:05] Why is this not being preached? Because
[1:46:07] death does kill him. When you say die,
[1:46:10] you mean
[1:46:12] you
[1:46:14] man behind. He get
[1:46:19] to die. You know this dino one trying to
[1:46:23] kill you.
[1:46:28] What he pointed them to a place to find
[1:46:31] him. Hallelujah. Jesus at the cross
[1:46:35] where you are crucified with him. Today
[1:46:37] we try to find him. Everything we try to
[1:46:40] find him in church building. Try to find
[1:46:42] him in denomination. Try to find him in
[1:46:44] saying some creed. Try to find him by
[1:46:46] keeping certain days, obeying certain
[1:46:48] rituals. But we cannot find him till we
[1:46:50] come to Calvary.
[1:46:52] There we are crucified, fall into the
[1:46:55] dust of the earth and die to ourselves
[1:46:57] and then reborn again. Then we find
[1:47:00] Jesus.
[1:47:03] All right.
[1:47:05] Today they bring you to some other
[1:47:06] place, to some statue, some church, some
[1:47:08] organization, some doctrinal laws, but
[1:47:10] never get you in the presence of Christ.
[1:47:13] A real true disciple, here we go,
[1:47:15] church, would bring you right straight
[1:47:17] into the presence of Christ and from
[1:47:19] there Christ will show you what you have
[1:47:22] to do. Christ himself pointed people to
[1:47:25] his death and said, "Except a corner
[1:47:28] which falls into drunk, it abides
[1:47:29] alone." How different it is. You don't
[1:47:32] find him by doing better.
[1:47:35] I didn't anybody was bad last year but
[1:47:38] this year
[1:47:43] that's a big one.
[1:47:46] Your better is not good enough. Some
[1:47:48] people continue to do the best. They're
[1:47:50] not learning. They're not willing to
[1:47:52] shut up and listen.
[1:47:55] Some of you talk too much. You talk
[1:47:57] because you want to feel that you know
[1:47:59] and you don't want let people know you
[1:48:01] don't know.
[1:48:03] And you don't know what you don't know.
[1:48:05] So just push
[1:48:07] and listen and learn. Jesus said, "Learn
[1:48:11] of me." A lot of things you don't know.
[1:48:14] A lot of things I don't know. I am
[1:48:16] learning.
[1:48:19] I want to learn. I choose to learn. I
[1:48:22] choose not to be dull. I want to be
[1:48:25] sharp.
[1:48:28] Again, old. What that means? My mind not
[1:48:31] old. Not old
[1:48:36] I don't I if I keep anointing old man I
[1:48:38] look for a rocking ship by retirement
[1:48:40] rocking ship old what
[1:48:44] how old Abraham was the parents laughing
[1:48:46] behind the cars the cars are feeling old
[1:48:51] you can't talk that talk you have to
[1:48:54] talk purpose what God want you to do
[1:48:57] David said I was young now I'm old never
[1:48:59] seen the righteous forsaken
[1:49:01] Hush him out. Stop talking negative or
[1:49:04] you see beg bread. David said that.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Find out about your purpose. If you have
[1:49:12] no purpose, take your exit. But find out
[1:49:14] about your purpose.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; You cannot cancel experience.
[1:49:28] We grow into where we are.
[1:49:30] We learning to where we are. We have
[1:49:32] been led into where we are. And God is
[1:49:34] want to take us further. Praise God.
[1:49:37] Praise God. All right, let's continue.
[1:49:40] All right, let me see what Peter
[1:49:42] 8 or 14.
[1:49:46] Christ is here in the form of the word
[1:49:49] and the word brings life because he is
[1:49:52] the word. Christ is the word.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Are you ready? And when you die to
[1:49:57] yourself with Christ like a corner
[1:49:59] wheat, then the word lives in you.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Therefore, here we go. In the seed's
[1:50:05] birth, the old seed must die before the
[1:50:09] new one can be born. Therefore, death is
[1:50:12] hard any time. So, we not saying that is
[1:50:15] easy. Nobody's saying I'm looking to
[1:50:17] dead and looking box.
[1:50:20] I buy a box. I look into dead.
[1:50:28] Jesus didn't say, "Oh, Calvary, I'm
[1:50:30] going down." No. Jesus say, "If if it's
[1:50:34] possible,
[1:50:35] let's go past." That that is human.
[1:50:39] That's how we supposed to put it. I tell
[1:50:42] my wife driving up, I remember mother
[1:50:43] when she was dead in the hospital, she
[1:50:46] complained about the kind of food, how
[1:50:47] the food tasted so terrible. In my mind
[1:50:49] I said but look at she
[1:50:52] and she be out and she a good taste in
[1:50:54] she mouth she them hospital food she
[1:50:57] don't want them hospital food
[1:50:59] and I watching my mother 90 something
[1:51:01] years old on the bed complain about
[1:51:02] hospital food
[1:51:05] so even though she's old she have taste
[1:51:06] in her not because you're old taste
[1:51:13] you looking like a strange
[1:51:16] maybe not old
[1:51:22] That is hard.
[1:51:25] It is painful.
[1:51:28] It is distressful.
[1:51:30] Birth is the same because you are
[1:51:32] bringing life into the world. It is
[1:51:34] painful.
[1:51:37] So that is why in the message sister
[1:51:39] Oliver they prefer this not this dead
[1:51:42] thing. They want to know the IR and the
[1:51:46] IR
[1:51:49] just a letter I inside.
[1:51:52] It sounds good. It sound like a nice
[1:51:55] catchphrase, but that is not the word.
[1:52:13] This is for you to think.
[1:52:17] You have a hot mouth. You know hot mouth
[1:52:18] is
[1:52:21] very quiet.
[1:52:25] That husband's on the maners with the
[1:52:26] white mouth.
[1:52:28] I accusing anybody
[1:52:33] and you feel your mouth is very
[1:52:34] powerful. But God looking at your mouth
[1:52:37] and God hearing your mouth.
[1:52:39] among us
[1:52:44] every dangerous
[1:52:48] time about somethingness.
[1:52:52] I said, "Yeah, I know."
[1:52:55] When I call it sting,
[1:52:59] but I know from before.
[1:53:03] That means that you have to see your
[1:53:05] temper, see your anger, see your short
[1:53:08] fuse, see your blood close to your skin
[1:53:11] and die.
[1:53:17] This has to be intentional.
[1:53:24] You cannot stop half all them half naked
[1:53:26] women on the streets.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; They wear all kind of things now.
[1:53:30] Totally insane. I said they mad. That's
[1:53:32] their business. My business to turn my
[1:53:35] head.
[1:53:38] You can't tell them wear long dress and
[1:53:40] dress neat and nice and sat and have
[1:53:41] them. If you want to look Sat and have
[1:53:44] you too,
[1:53:46] you have a choice. You have to be
[1:53:48] intentional of whether or not you will
[1:53:51] allow that to throw you down. Oh, give
[1:53:53] the Lord some praise to somebody.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:00] We can't change the world, but we could
[1:54:02] change us.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; You could only be responsible for what
[1:54:10] you are responsible for.
[1:54:14] You know much time I get tempted to ask
[1:54:15] someone where nothing in your nose.
[1:54:20] I can't figure out the beauty of that.
[1:54:22] It's like it's like a a covering.
[1:54:29] I wish but I can't
[1:54:34] see a man walking half
[1:54:38] here. You pull it up here. Pull it up
[1:54:39] here. Pull it up. What kind of
[1:54:41] foolishness is that? You want but
[1:54:43] listen, you can't. They may cough you
[1:54:46] down or c you. You can't you can't do
[1:54:50] that.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; You have to leave them alone. Leave them
[1:54:54] alone.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; We living in dangerous times and you
[1:55:00] have to protect your spirit and
[1:55:00] yourself.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; If you trip at everything out there, you
[1:55:05] go nuts in. You will stay home and lock
[1:55:07] the door and eventually see a line out
[1:55:10] there. You go inside at all. But this is
[1:55:14] where Jesus give the example. He was
[1:55:17] plugged into man and plugged into God.
[1:55:20] And he prayed for the disciples that
[1:55:22] they are not taken out of the world but
[1:55:24] God will keep them in the world. I was
[1:55:27] in school teachers teachers was telling
[1:55:29] me over um all your Christian only want
[1:55:31] to um die and go to heaven. I said not
[1:55:33] this one. I said I want to overcome
[1:55:36] right here because they feel that
[1:55:37] Christians only want to escape. We going
[1:55:39] to glory going to heaven with no
[1:55:41] testimony. They will
[1:55:43] when we I mean that kind of die where
[1:55:45] you going. You have a testimony. Make
[1:55:49] sure before you kick the bucket. You got
[1:55:50] a testimony.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; Don't kick the bucket yet. You got a
[1:55:53] testimony first.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; Have a witness to the world. You shall
[1:55:56] be witnesses unto me.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord some praises. The seven C.
[1:56:00] Be a witness of God.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; I want to live for God.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; I told you on my job, the first thing I
[1:56:07] tell people is I'm a I'm a Christian.
[1:56:10] I wasn't living Christian privately in
[1:56:12] my job.
[1:56:15] I'm a Christian.
[1:56:24] There's a reason why I did that. I
[1:56:27] wanted to put my testimony on the line.
[1:56:30] I wanted to put my confession on the
[1:56:31] line. The girls will know. The woman
[1:56:33] will know. One girl want me to call you
[1:56:35] by your first name and I refuse. Miss
[1:56:37] you by you miss.
[1:56:38] You know to keep a woman for you because
[1:56:40] she want me call first name and I
[1:56:41] refuse.
[1:56:43] It's a choice.
[1:56:45] It's a choice how you conduct yourself
[1:56:47] as a man, as a woman, as a girl. It's a
[1:56:50] choice.
[1:56:52] And I see you put God first, God will
[1:56:55] bless you. You put God first, God will
[1:56:57] reward you. You put God first, God will
[1:56:58] make a way for you.
[1:57:04] And brothers wanted to find wife from
[1:57:06] don't do that.
[1:57:08] Don't go there.
[1:57:14] There's a brother testimony. He had a
[1:57:16] girlfriend outside or whatnot and he
[1:57:18] come to the altar and he put the
[1:57:20] girlfriend right at the altar then leave
[1:57:22] her right there. Walk out with the alter
[1:57:23] and leave her. She was outside. When she
[1:57:25] get out the altar, he see his future. So
[1:57:28] his future wife be outside and inside at
[1:57:32] the same time.
[1:57:35] That is hard. Let me close up.
[1:57:42] It will never be until every person that
[1:57:44] professes to be a Christian will forget
[1:57:46] his own ability and heal himself to God.
[1:57:49] And this is what brother was asking
[1:57:50] about surrender and being intentional.
[1:57:55] Then God can achieve his purpose by
[1:57:57] sending not a revival. What we need to
[1:57:59] do first is send a killing. He needs a
[1:58:02] killing of ourselves. This tabernacle
[1:58:04] needs a killing and me with it.
[1:58:08] This is brother Brandon speaking. All of
[1:58:10] us, we need a killing so we can be
[1:58:12] revived into new life. We need a place
[1:58:16] of yielding to the spirit instead of so
[1:58:19] much of schooling and programs and so
[1:58:20] on. We have to do that. He said I said
[1:58:24] that we have to surrender our souls and
[1:58:26] lives. That's the word where I've seen
[1:58:28] use surrendering intentional.
[1:58:31] watch. Surrender our souls and lives
[1:58:33] even to the housewife, to the farmer, to
[1:58:37] the mechanic, whoever we are, we got to
[1:58:40] completely surrender ourselves and know
[1:58:41] that we are nothing and let God start
[1:58:44] from there. Oh, praise the name of the
[1:58:47] Lord. Praise God. So when we are in the
[1:58:50] flesh, Romans 7. Come on, please. The
[1:58:53] motions of sins which were by the law
[1:58:55] did work in our members did bring forth
[1:58:57] the fruit unto death. But now we are
[1:59:00] delivered from the law that made being
[1:59:02] dead wherein we were held and we should
[1:59:04] serve in the newness of spirit and not
[1:59:07] the oldness of the letter. Romans 7:18.
[1:59:10] For I know that in my flesh dwelleth no
[1:59:12] good thing. To will is present with me,
[1:59:15] but how to perform that which is good I
[1:59:16] find not. For the good that I would do,
[1:59:18] I do not, but the evil I would not do
[1:59:20] that I do. Now if I do that I would not,
[1:59:24] it is no more I don't do it, but sin
[1:59:26] that do it in me. I find in a law then I
[1:59:29] would do good, evil is present with me.
[1:59:31] So I delight in the law of God after the
[1:59:34] inward man. But I see another law in my
[1:59:36] members born against the law of my mind
[1:59:38] and bringing me into captivity to the
[1:59:40] law of sin which is in my members. Oh
[1:59:42] wretched man. This is all I am. Who
[1:59:45] shall deliver me from the body of this
[1:59:47] death? I thank God through Jesus Christ.
[1:59:49] So then with the mind I myself serve the
[1:59:52] law of God or with the flesh and law of
[1:59:54] sin. So he's explaining in Romans 7 the
[1:59:56] battle that's in the carnal mind, the
[1:59:59] battle that's in the flesh. But when he
[2:00:00] go into Romans 8, everything changes.
[2:00:03] There is therefore now no condemnation
[2:00:05] to them that are in Christ Jesus who
[2:00:07] walk not after the flesh but after the
[2:00:10] spirit. So what is he saying? You can
[2:00:12] walk as a believer, as a person after
[2:00:14] the flesh, or you could walk as a
[2:00:16] believer after the spirit. What do you
[2:00:18] walk after? It's a choice. Hallelujah.
[2:00:21] For the law of the spirit of life in
[2:00:23] Christ Jesus has made me free from the
[2:00:26] law of sin and death. For what the law
[2:00:27] could not do in that it was weak through
[2:00:29] the flesh, God sending his own son in
[2:00:32] the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin
[2:00:35] condemn sin in the flesh. What for? That
[2:00:37] the righteousness of the law might be
[2:00:39] fulfilling us who walk not after the
[2:00:41] flesh but after the spirit. Here we go.
[2:00:44] For they that are after the flesh do
[2:00:46] mind the things of the flesh. But they
[2:00:48] that after the spirit the things of the
[2:00:50] spirit. For to be connally minded is
[2:00:52] death, but to be spiritually minded is
[2:00:54] life and peace. Because the connal mind
[2:00:56] is enmity against God. For it's not
[2:01:00] subject to the law of God, neither
[2:01:01] indeed can be. For deals in the flesh
[2:01:03] cannot please God.
[2:01:08] The corner wheat has to fall into the
[2:01:10] ground and die. I'm saying not only die
[2:01:12] but rot. I'm I'm finishing.
[2:01:15] So, as long as there's any human
[2:01:16] injections,
[2:01:18] human ideas, then God's germ of life,
[2:01:21] the Holy Spirit cannot work. You cannot
[2:01:24] be healed as long there's a fraction
[2:01:26] somewhere that is not rotten yet. He
[2:01:28] says, "You not only have to die, but
[2:01:31] rot." And then he explain what rot is.
[2:01:34] Rot is completely done away with.
[2:01:37] It is finished.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Your car divorce
[2:01:43] and have the flesh inside the cupboard
[2:01:44] in the cupboard there. You're going back
[2:01:46] to the old husband. Instead of cutting
[2:01:48] him off and bury him, they still have
[2:01:51] him there. So when things happen now,
[2:01:52] you go back to pull pull him out the
[2:01:54] closet.
[2:01:57] I thought you dead to him, but he's
[2:01:59] still alive. You have to die,
[2:02:02] brother. I'm going to skip down 12. All
[2:02:06] right.
[2:02:07] This is where I get the title from. Are
[2:02:10] we going to close this?
[2:02:12] When Christ was being formed in Mary,
[2:02:16] that is when the persecution set in.
[2:02:18] That is when the persecution started.
[2:02:21] When and then the scripture we read
[2:02:22] Galatians 4:19 when Christ the hope of
[2:02:26] glory is formed in you, Christ being
[2:02:31] formed in you when you are dying
[2:02:35] and Christ is coming to life.
[2:02:40] So in this age of dying out, you're
[2:02:42] seeing that there come a hour when you
[2:02:44] are dying and as you are dying, Christ
[2:02:47] is coming to life in you.
[2:02:51] When you are dying and Christ is coming
[2:02:54] to life, watch the persecution set in.
[2:02:58] Watch trouble sat in every hand. Watch
[2:03:00] the devil go on a rampage. When Christ
[2:03:03] is being formed in Mary, quickly came
[2:03:06] the king's commandment. Hallelujah. the
[2:03:09] full baby to be delivered right at the
[2:03:11] great persecution. Then he said these
[2:03:13] words here the baby have been formed for
[2:03:15] a long time in the womb. But this is the
[2:03:17] coming of the last days when the
[2:03:19] completeness when the fullness of the
[2:03:22] Godhead when the fullness of Christ is
[2:03:24] to be manifested among his people. Just
[2:03:27] the time
[2:03:29] that the church is beginning to get to
[2:03:31] its feet where the supernatural is
[2:03:34] beginning to work. They are going to try
[2:03:36] to stop this stuff. For all these years
[2:03:39] I've been telling you they are not going
[2:03:40] to close us down because we preaching
[2:03:41] this message.
[2:03:43] Because as far as they're concerned,
[2:03:44] that's not our group, not our church.
[2:03:45] But brother George, you know, when the
[2:03:47] church begins to get to its feet, when
[2:03:49] the supernatural begins to move among
[2:03:51] the church,
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; then they're going to try to stop that.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; Not giving out books and giving out
[2:03:55] tapes and pressing play that stopping
[2:03:57] the church for that. When the same
[2:03:59] power, silver and gold have I none, such
[2:04:01] as I have I give it unto you. When that
[2:04:04] same power is manifested, when it
[2:04:06] vindicates the voice of God, which will
[2:04:08] be a manifestation of the prophet's
[2:04:10] word, when we can say this is that that
[2:04:12] the prophet spake of not press play,
[2:04:15] this is that you're pressing and
[2:04:17] playing.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Okay, the Lord I shout in the house.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Death is what going to
[2:04:23] stop.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:04:26] Thank you Jesus. I'm done. Praise God.
[2:04:29] Let's all stand and give God some
[2:04:31] praises this morning. Father, we praise
[2:04:32] you and bless you. When you are dying,
[2:04:36] what are you saying? Preacher begin.
[2:04:39] It means we have to come to that place
[2:04:43] that we see the reason for the death of
[2:04:45] a corner.
[2:04:47] You die, your family lives. You die,
[2:04:50] your loved ones because Christ will come
[2:04:53] alive in you. Let's bow our heads and
[2:04:55] close our eyes. Heavenly Father, we
[2:04:56] thank you for this truth of your word.
[2:04:59] Your word can't fail. Father, your word
[2:05:01] is true. Your word is sure. May anchor
[2:05:05] into every heart tonight. Have your way
[2:05:07] and bless him in a special way and
[2:05:09] commit their lives unto you. As we see
[2:05:12] when that woman came with an alabaster
[2:05:14] box and anoint Jesus and someone says,
[2:05:19] "Why didn't she sell it?" And Jesus
[2:05:22] said, "She's anointed me for my burial."
[2:05:26] He was anointed to die. Father, may a
[2:05:29] special anointing sweep inside of here
[2:05:30] this morning that people would look into
[2:05:32] their hearts and they'll have a desire
[2:05:34] to intentionally walk towards Calvary.
[2:05:38] Intentionally to say, "I'm sorry.
[2:05:40] Forgive me." Because to say, "I'm sorry.
[2:05:42] Forgive me," is a debt. It's a debt to
[2:05:45] admit that you're wrong. It's a debt to
[2:05:47] say, "Forgive me." It's a debt to say,
[2:05:49] "I shouldn't have acted that way. I
[2:05:51] shouldn't have spoken that way. I
[2:05:52] shouldn't have treated you that way. I'm
[2:05:54] I'm sorry. Forgive me and pray for me.
[2:05:56] It's a debt to do that. And only the
[2:05:58] bride will come to that place of full
[2:06:00] repentance and full surrender and full
[2:06:02] healing to you. Father, may they see is
[2:06:04] not by chance. May they see is not by
[2:06:06] condition. May they see intentional that
[2:06:09] we serve you. Intentional that we yield
[2:06:12] and surrender ourselves to you. Have
[2:06:14] your way with your people even now in
[2:06:16] Jesus name I ask it. Amen. God bless
[2:06:17] you. Thanks again for coming. Why you
[2:06:19] turn around and greet somebody in Jesus
[2:06:21] name
[2:06:24] in this world of sin.
[2:06:32] I am so
[2:06:35] needy.
[2:06:39] Make me pure.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God bless you. I am so
[2:06:46] needy. I am so needy,
[2:06:51] Lord.

[2:09:15] reasoning. Die out to my feelings. Die

[2:09:21] what I think is true. Lord, let me live
[2:09:23] what you want me to live, Lord. Forget
[2:09:25] everything else. Let every word be a
[2:09:28] lie. Let my Let God's word be true this

[2:18:43] today. Amen. You appreciate the message.
[2:18:46] You appreciate the service.
[2:18:50] Wonderful. Well, it's certainly great to
[2:18:52] be back home in the house of the Lord.
[2:18:54] And it's certainly great to see the
[2:18:56] church on fire for God and looking for
[2:18:58] God to continue to do something
[2:19:00] tremendous in our midst. So we have some
[2:19:03] notes of praises. Uh good morning
[2:19:05] saints. I'd like to give thanks for
[2:19:08] prayers that were offered for my sister
[2:19:10] for medical condition. She has recovered
[2:19:12] and was discharged the same evening from
[2:19:15] sister Nai. Thank God
[2:19:23] from Sister Crystal Sabu. Greetings
[2:19:25] saints in the precious name of Jesus.
[2:19:27] I'd like to thank God for his
[2:19:29] faithfulness and his protection.
[2:19:32] This morning around 2:00, I heard my
[2:19:36] dogs barking. When I looked outside, I
[2:19:39] saw someone stealing three of my goats
[2:19:41] and a sheep. first uh uh just bought we
[2:19:46] were calling the police and not getting
[2:19:47] through and we called a police officer
[2:19:50] friend of ours. He called the police on
[2:19:51] patrol and they came and found the
[2:19:53] animals in the savannah near us. The
[2:19:55] thief saw the police and ran. So I'm
[2:19:58] grateful to God for the safe return of
[2:20:00] the animals and for keeping us safe as
[2:20:01] well.
[2:20:03] Amen. And that's not something to take
[2:20:05] lightly because in this time of home
[2:20:08] invasions and people coming on in the
[2:20:10] area. So to know that the hand of God is
[2:20:12] is not too short to protect. He is more
[2:20:15] than able to preserve. We have a reason
[2:20:17] to thank God this morning. Keep playing
[2:20:20] something. So hopefully we have uh two
[2:20:24] prayer requests
[2:20:28] from sister Richardson
[2:20:30] requesting prayers. Saints please pray
[2:20:32] for me. I'm not feeling well and
[2:20:35] thanking God for answered prayer
[2:20:39] from sister
[2:20:42] Greetings in the precious name of the
[2:20:43] Lord. I'm asking for prayer for healing
[2:20:45] and deliverance from a chronic lower
[2:20:48] back pain. Thanking God for victory,
[2:20:51] believing that it's already done. And if
[2:20:54] there's anyone here this morning you
[2:20:57] want to show by raising your hands as we
[2:20:58] approach the throne of grace with our
[2:21:02] requests, with our needs,
[2:21:05] spiritual
[2:21:07] healing, natural, it doesn't matter what
[2:21:09] it is. He is still a the great
[2:21:10] physician. He's still a way maker. He's
[2:21:12] still a restorer. He's able to break
[2:21:15] chains. He's able to break shackles.
[2:21:18] Shall we pray? Oh heavenly father, Lord,
[2:21:22] the word has gone forth and the word is
[2:21:24] sharper than any two-edged sword.
[2:21:25] Father, Lord, the word clears the
[2:21:28] pathway for the spirit to move because
[2:21:30] through the message of this great Elijah
[2:21:32] prophet, we have the fullness of the
[2:21:34] restored word which gives us divine
[2:21:36] access to the fullness of the power with
[2:21:38] the word being the conductor of the
[2:21:40] spirit. So we are father looking for
[2:21:42] your grace and your mercy upon your
[2:21:44] people. We have stood behind this sacred
[2:21:47] desk so many times father Lord and seen
[2:21:49] prayer requests become notes of praises
[2:21:52] father. So Lord, we bring Sister Sister
[2:21:55] Richardson before you. Lord, she's not
[2:21:57] feeling well. And Lord, she's reaching
[2:21:59] out to El Shadai. She's reaching out to
[2:22:01] Jehovah Gyra, Jehovah Rafa. She's
[2:22:04] reaching out to the great physician this
[2:22:06] morning. Lord, you said you are the God
[2:22:08] that heals. So Father, may you, Lord,
[2:22:10] perform a work of healing upon your
[2:22:12] daughter this morning. Lord, for Sister
[2:22:15] Esther Root with that chronic lower back
[2:22:17] pain. May today be the last day Lord of
[2:22:20] that back pain. and we come against it
[2:22:22] in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. He
[2:22:24] said there's power in the church of the
[2:22:26] living God over every sickness, over
[2:22:28] every disease, over every attack of the
[2:22:30] enemy. The enemy has been given
[2:22:32] permission to attack, but we also
[2:22:34] understand our authority to repel every
[2:22:36] attack and to push back the very
[2:22:38] onslaught of the enemy. So with the
[2:22:40] power vested in us as the church of the
[2:22:42] living God, we declare healing upon your
[2:22:45] people. We declare Lord deliverance upon
[2:22:48] your people in the mighty name of Jesus
[2:22:50] Christ. Satan, take your hands off of
[2:22:53] God's property today in the name of
[2:22:56] Jesus Christ. Father, for every hand
[2:22:58] that was raised, Father, every need that
[2:23:01] was elevated, Lord, every request that
[2:23:03] has been made, Lord, either articulated
[2:23:05] or in the depths of the souls of your
[2:23:07] people, Father, may you answer the cries
[2:23:09] of your saints, Father. Lord, may you
[2:23:12] touch each one, every brother, every
[2:23:13] sister. Lord, every Caleb, every child,
[2:23:16] every mother, every father, every
[2:23:17] mother, every daughter, every
[2:23:19] granddaughter, Lord, everyone here under
[2:23:21] the sound of our voice this morning. May
[2:23:23] every request come back as a note of
[2:23:25] praise. And may you bless us, Lord, as
[2:23:27] we prepare to transition to the question
[2:23:29] and answer service. May you be with us,
[2:23:31] Lord. May you be with your church. May
[2:23:33] you be with your people. May you touch
[2:23:35] our pastor today, Lord, standing behind
[2:23:37] the sacred desk. Father, may your
[2:23:39] anointing, even your aos presence, even
[2:23:42] the shikina glory, even the pillar of
[2:23:44] fire drop down upon him even now, Lord.
[2:23:47] And may you, Lord, get glory and honor
[2:23:49] to your name, Lord, in the precious name
[2:23:50] of Jesus Christ. May you bless us, Lord,
[2:23:53] as we transition. And Lord, maybe
[2:23:55] there's someone who needs to leave,
[2:23:56] Father. May you be with them and bring
[2:23:57] us back at the appointed time in the
[2:23:59] precious name of Jesus Christ. And the
[2:24:01] church says, "Amen and amen and amen."
[2:24:05] You may be seated for a few
[2:24:07] announcements. Before
[2:24:09] I get into the announcements, I want to
[2:24:12] try to do something a little different.
[2:24:13] Uh we at the end of the month of
[2:24:15] January, if your birthday was in the
[2:24:18] month of January, I'd like you to stand.
[2:24:21] If your birthday was in January, during
[2:24:24] the month of January, don't be ashamed.
[2:24:27] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[2:24:32] All of the January birthdays either has
[2:24:34] been celebrated already or about to be
[2:24:36] celebrated this month. and we want to
[2:24:38] sing happy birthday for you. And I want
[2:24:42] to follow that song with never grow old.
[2:24:45] So
[2:24:47] happy birthday
[2:24:49] to you.
[2:24:52] Happy
[2:24:58] birthday
[2:24:59] all of these believers.
[2:25:02] Happy birthday
[2:25:04] to you
[2:25:06] and never grow. Hallelujah.
[2:25:12] Never grow. We're going to a land in a
[2:25:17] land that will never grow.
[2:25:23] You believe that? One day you won't get
[2:25:24] old anymore. Oh, never
[2:25:28] grow.
[2:25:41] Wonderful. Let's put our hands together
[2:25:43] for all of those who celebrated their
[2:25:45] birthdays in January.
[2:25:48] You may be seated. You know, there are
[2:25:50] some of these things we don't ever want
[2:25:52] to take for granted. You know, there are
[2:25:54] people who did not make it to 2026, and
[2:25:57] we thank God that we are here. We're in
[2:25:59] the land of the living. And as much as
[2:26:01] we have trials and testings and
[2:26:03] oppositions and problems, we will still,
[2:26:05] if you count all your blessings and name
[2:26:07] them one by one, you could see what the
[2:26:09] Lord has done. Your blessings will
[2:26:12] always outnumber your trials, your
[2:26:14] testings, your obstacles. Your blessings
[2:26:16] will always outnumber them. So by the
[2:26:18] grace of God, we'll keep switching
[2:26:20] things up. We'll keep the enemy
[2:26:21] guessing. You know, he wouldn't know
[2:26:23] what coming next because that's who we
[2:26:24] are. We are we are creators. We are born
[2:26:26] to create. Can the church say amen?
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. So I would like to welcome
[2:26:32] Savian. I believe it is Savian Campbell
[2:26:34] to the Habac this morning. God bless
[2:26:36] you. Welcome. So happy to have you.
[2:26:39] I trust you have been blessed. Trust
[2:26:42] that we were able to put a smile on your
[2:26:43] face and that we could extend a right
[2:26:45] hand of fellowship that we are called to
[2:26:48] be oddballs. We are unique bunch of
[2:26:49] people but the random taught us that we
[2:26:51] are oddballs. So forgive our shouting
[2:26:53] and our jumping and our smiles in the
[2:26:55] midst of our trials.
[2:26:56] is our genetic makeup because our
[2:26:58] genealogy traces back to God. So, so
[2:27:01] happy to have you here and welcome by
[2:27:02] the grace of God. I have a note as well
[2:27:05] and uh as Bovit said, we were not here
[2:27:08] last Sunday for the baptism service. Um
[2:27:11] but it was such a tremendous blessing
[2:27:12] and I saw some of the videos from it,
[2:27:14] but we already have uh another candidate
[2:27:18] um who is ready for baptism. I don't
[2:27:21] believe he's here in the tabernacle
[2:27:22] today. But it we will have a baptism
[2:27:24] service coming up soon in February, but
[2:27:27] we want to acknowledge that brother
[2:27:28] Elijah Holder, 13 years old, after
[2:27:31] having a conversation with our elder,
[2:27:33] brother Terren, is ready to be baptized.
[2:27:35] So, we are so happy that God is still
[2:27:38] calling and we look forward for the next
[2:27:41] baptism service uh tentatively. It's
[2:27:44] scheduled, I believe, for the 15th, but
[2:27:45] Anthony, we said the 15th. Is that
[2:27:47] Sunday? It's the 15th of February. So if
[2:27:49] there's anyone else who wants to join
[2:27:50] that baptismal service, certainly speak
[2:27:53] with one of the ministers or elders so
[2:27:54] we can uh facilitate that in the baptism
[2:27:57] service uh right after this service
[2:28:00] straight away uh being expeditious with
[2:28:03] time. We want to go directly uh into our
[2:28:07] question and answer service. It is the
[2:28:10] first uh of this year and by the grace
[2:28:12] of God we want to have a number of them.
[2:28:14] We have quite a number of questions. We
[2:28:16] uh will not be able to get through them
[2:28:18] all, but we invite you all to stay um
[2:28:21] and be blessed by them. And of course,
[2:28:24] service continues this Wednesday live at
[2:28:26] the tabernacle. And this coming Friday,
[2:28:30] uh we will have Bible study for
[2:28:34] or next week.
[2:28:36] Yeah. This this coming Friday, we'll
[2:28:38] have Bible study by the grace of God.
[2:28:39] This coming Friday and this coming
[2:28:41] Sunday, we'll have uh double service
[2:28:43] will be the first uh of February. This
[2:28:46] coming Sunday maintainers group four is
[2:28:48] scheduled for today and next week Lord
[2:28:51] willing group two is carded uh to serve
[2:28:54] which is about a Joel Straer's group. So
[2:28:56] I believe I got all of my announcements.
[2:28:59] So may the Lord richly bless you. So, we
[2:29:02] are going to transition uh the technical
[2:29:04] team over
