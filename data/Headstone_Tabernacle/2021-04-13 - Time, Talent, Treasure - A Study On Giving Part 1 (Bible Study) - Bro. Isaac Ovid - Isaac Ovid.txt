to change lord we want to be able to give an account lord for this great message that you are brought to us through this prophet lord this malachi 4 prophet this saint luke 17 30 prophet this revelation 10 prophet lord that you lord send a message to us to catch a bride that we could see lord in the written word things that others cannot see lord because we have the eyesight lord true that fought light lord true lord that prophetic eye to see lord what you want us to see so may you speak to us tonight and lord open our understanding that we could be stronger in our faith lord and rest confident that lord you are more than able to do what you said you would do we commit the study tonight into your hands in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen and amen it's certainly a great privilege to be here thank you so much uh for your support for your commitment for your dedication and we are trusting god to do something tremendous uh for us tonight and um really i don't know um how you feel but i was truly truly truly blessed uh uh on sunday service it was truly a wonderful uh masterpiece not just of a message but to see you know how god is unfolding so much uh in the wood to us and the importance of of that daily life that that priestly responsibility that we have and that golden altar and you have to go past the brazen altar and and all that god has laid out in his plans for us that that we could live a certain way and and there's so much that was said you know in in the message on sunday and i want to encourage you if you have not um seen sunday's message you need to see it and if you haven't seen it and you just see it you didn't see that at least twice and if you were there you saw it before you need to get it again because there are a lot of lessons in there i spoke about all of it i said we could spend a whole month um going through that message and and coming out of that message because there's there's a lot in there you know and you know coming down towards um the end of the message on sunday but ovid was speaking about god's anger was kindled kindled at the attitude of the people and the murmuring of the people and god was so angry that he just acted out judgment without hesitation you know what we would see a scripture unfolded over i think 14 000 people were killed and what stopped that judgment was when moses instructed aaron to go and get the incense you know and stand between the living and the dead stand between judgment and the people you know and i was sharing with you having a fellowship and i was saying you know not any and anybody could have gone and take the incense you had to be qualified to go get it you know and and when you really think about it you know you couldn't be a priest if your life was not in order you know so to be able to go to bring incense and to stand you know for anybody and and in our case now that we are kings and priests it means that our lives must be in such a way that we could be counted worthy to be able to go you know into that place and be able to to to take the incense and you know and stand for our family and stand for our loved ones you know and it is such a reminder to us you know but robert said that the christian walk is a life of maintenance you know god starts the fire he starts to work in us there's nothing that we could do to start the work we didn't call ourselves we we didn't we didn't we we we didn't find a message a message found us you know god has done his part he said all that the father has given me must come you know but there's a great work of maintenance you know of of the morning sacrifice and even sacrifice and there's so much so much in there so um by the grace of god um i i didn't know the extent of what we would have preached on sunday um but i shared with him you know a certain direction that i wanted to go with bible study and i realized that you know by the grace of god we are we are overlapping in so many ways so i want to connect um to what borobi preached um on sunday and i'll have to divide this bible study into into two parts i believe by the grace of god and i said to him before this study i say i've have so many pieces of the ways that this can go so i'm trusting god to to help me take it through to be a blessing and an encouragement to us you know and um you know we really want to thank god for the convention as well the ivory coast convention and the inspiration of the convention and and um what a blessing it was a tremendous blessing so god is is good he's good to us to be able to give us the opportunity to feast you know at jesus table you know and get encouragement and to get insight and to be inspired in the middle of this pandemic and you know i saw the evening report with how many cases um and it looks as if we on an upward trend you know and i i i caught a little piece of the global news this evening and you know on a global level you know they're saying that you know the pandemic is at a critical turning point you know where worldwide cases are rising you know in some countries more than others and it's just a a tough situation and it's a situation and you see the frustration you see the anger you see the despair you see you know different countries taking different actions with with the different types of vaccines you know um you know the u.s saying not this vaccine and this other one and not this age are not this and only this age should take it and this aid shouldn't take it and and and it really requires a deeper anchor than the news to be able to stand now it takes a deeper anchor than somebody's recommendation and somebody's advice because man can't even agree with man and in one minute he will have the organization saying something would in the next minute the u.s saying something canada is saying something you know the canada approved the astrazeneca virus the u.s has not approved it different countries and and you see a situation where who do you go to who is right who has the right answer who will you trust where will your fate rest will it rest on the system on the government or the on the doctor on the health ministry will it with it rest where because you don't know the agenda you don't know the purpose you don't know what's behind it there are things that are not available to us with natural eyesight but we thank god that because of spiritual hindsight and spiritual eyesight and spiritual insight we can rest our faith and our trust in god who has kept us thus far and who is a god of preservation he's a god of healing he's a god of deliverance he's a god of restoration and god wants us to put our trust in him you know and if you put your trust in him that is a true walk of faith you know a true walk of faith is when you cannot see him and somebody said to me recently he said if you close your eyes can you see i see well obviously if you close the eyes you can't see see well that's what the faith walk is you know you close your eyes and you begin to walk and that is very difficult it's very difficult to just close your eyes and and and walk and we read it in scripture to walk by faith and not by sight but if i tell you now close your eyes and walk around your house you know it it it takes you will do it with a little bit of caution because you're not familiar to walking or with walking without looking you depend on sight to make a lot of decisions you depend on sight to know when to cross the road you depend on sight to know if if your number is called you depend on sight for all these things and god is is looking for us to walk by feet and faith is a walk of trust in him to take us where we need to be to help transform our thinking to transform our attitude to transform our approach you know so i want to encourage you tonight with this with this teaching it is somewhat uh how do i say it it is it is a teaching that i have not seen done much um a lot of people you know don't spend time studying it but i saw it coming out of easter and some of my own you know looking at the scripture and then when i saw what beloved approached it um so i want to take a a study tonight uh if i wanted to give it a title it's the title is time talent and treasure a study of giving part one time talent and treasure a study of giving part one and you know sometimes you only see things when you really look for it which means it may not be obvious but it's only when you begin to look for certain things you begin to see things in scripture and in your words so i want to i want to start off by connecting as well to easter and understanding for us that calvary was a sacrifice it is it is it was also a gift it was also god-giving because and i recall as a sunday school student one of the very first scriptures that i learned was sin john you know it john 3 16 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believe it in him should not perish but have everlasting life and in there we see god giving you know and we know through scripture uh paul would reference jesus saying it is better to give than to receive and we live in a very selfish world you know we live in a very selfish world you know and i was having a conversation recently with someone and they were describing a situation they had with somebody else and i s and i said to him that's our next level of selfishness boy i say savages you would you say boy i don't have the word for that boy that is beyond selfishness you know and it kind of stood with me it stirred me a bit about selfishness and what selfishness is what selfishness does what selfishness causes and sometimes to look at something you need to look at the opposite of it so if the opposite of being selfish is being a giver you know there are there are things that we could give you know so you could give your time and this is where i took the title time you could give your talent and you could give your treasure and in looking through scripture i want to understand how god sees things because my mind was blown when i looked at paul dealing with a specific situation and by the grace of god we'll get to it tonight and it blew my mind how somebody could miss it because you could have certain things lined up a certain way and because of a failure in another aspect of your life god looks at it in a different kind of a way you know so i want to challenge us all because no matter what your position is tonight there are three things that you have that you could give right now you are giving time your presence here is time you are giving of your time to the lord because you are sacrificing other things you could have done with your time there are people who are not here because they have made a choice with how to use their time i can't judge the use of anybody's time because i don't know what else you have going on but the reality is you have a choice with what you do with your time you could choose to give your time to god you could choose to give your time in church you could choose to give your time to support your family you could choose to give time to support your friendships time is a resource time we are living in time as a break from eternity so time is a currency that has a beginning and it has an ending time is like a bank account you are born with an allotment of time but robert speaks of it and he referenced in scripture there are certain barriers that you can't cross boundaries you cannot pass and that's time we say it when we speak at times that when you look at a grave or tombstone you see the year of birth you see the year when someone passes on and you see a dash that separated two numbers and that dash represents all the time that they had on the street that one dash represents the time and how it was spent that dash represents everything that was done within time that time is a cap it's a limit it's a context it's a framework you waste the time it's captured there nobody remembers you use the time effectively use your time wisely it's different it's a legacy it's a testimony it's a story time time your time is connected to your talent because if you have a talent or skill and any gift or talent or skill and we'll get to the scriptures but i feel like to just kind of have a conversation sometime we just want to that's the liberty we could take in these studies i hope you don't mind we can just have a conversation your talent the gift that you didn't give yourself because it's a gift it's a talent it's something that you do that nobody else could do is the way you do something that nobody else could do so you might be a trades person you might be a craftsperson you might be a chef you might be a whatever it is it doesn't matter what it is it doesn't matter if a hundred people have that skill it is not just the skill it is you and the skill makes it different because that is you and the gift that god deposited in you but just as you have a choice with time you have a choice with your talent stories go on and on and on and on and on about musicians in the secular world who many of them speak of i started as a musician in church i can't tell you how many stories i've heard of what we call worldly singers worldly musicians who say well i started playing in church that that's that's where it started that was the beginning of the story but somewhere along the line the story changed on a ph 2 then a chapter was written and a story is crafted and the connection to church or the root or the umbilical cord of what was the beginning is no longer the trajectory they have given up that first love that first connection that was experienced and followed a different pathway in other words they have taken that talent and use it for something else use it for a different impact use it for a different influence use it for a different cause use it for a different purpose the talent is there but the use is a choice i'll say it again the talent is there but the use is a choice one of the hardest things for me is the misappropriation of scripture misuse of scripture misapplication of scripture misrepresentation of scripture as a young bible student as a young student i've heard a lot of people use the scripture gifts and callings are without repentance and i've heard a lot of people use that to mean that people have gifts but they need to repent that is not what that scripture means the scripture gifts and callings are without repentance means that when god gives a gift he god doesn't repent of giving the gift so the gift and the calling is without god's repentance in other words the bible said god repented he made man anybody with me but gifts and callings are without repentance means god doesn't take back the gift or the talent or the skill that he deposits in you it is the same way somebody could have the gift of a musician and they could be a musician in church and there's still a musician in the world the gift is there it is just a different employer different paycheck they move from a reward in heaven to the wages of sin being debt they transferred a different company was the prophet to see a different influence because there are only two influences but the reality is this all of us in this room tonight have time you can't tell me you don't have time we have time and it's how we choose to use the time we have talents different gifts different talents different skills and god is so wonderful he doesn't compare one gift to the other through many scriptures he makes a distinction between the arm and the feet and he knows and he mouth and he gives references and examples to these different things because they all have their purpose they all have their place they're all they all have a part in this whole thing so it's not for me to look at you and you to look at me or look at somebody else it is god gives gifts and talents god gives time and just some people use their time better than others some people use their gifts and talents better than others anybody with me tonight we are trying to go into a study of giving and i would see by the grace of god because i just feeling you know someone whether you really rob where is the wrestling mulberry tree yeah yeah your movie when you russell you know just to kind of have a conversation before we get into the scriptures and see which ones we're going to get into tonight time time time talent skill gift god gives you what you need to have to achieve what you need to achieve but ibraham would reference the challenge of the award challenges of the hour challenges of today what a husband needs now to be a good husband is different from what a husband needed 20 30 years ago to be a good husband the skills that are required to be a successful entrepreneur or accountant or or chef or whatever it is because knowledge has increased they have different things you need to do you can't operate on the principle that existed if new principles exist now that require new things anybody with me time talent and last treasure what do we treasure what do we do with our treasure what is your treasure is it is it yours what do you do with it how do you use your resources i believe in the last bible study we read scripture where jesus said listen if you can't even manage the natural treasure how you can manage your spiritual treasure so if you can manage your financial resources if you don't understand where it comes from understand why you have it understand how i want you to operate with it understand the principles that you're operating with you will miss the mark of your purpose on the it time talent treasure a study on giving part one i want to jump into some scriptures i want to try to see if i could go through this part a little quickly because i really want to get to the new testament but over it blew me away uh in that message on sunday and you know he read a scripture at the beginning of his message in exodus 25. and i want to just touch it a little bit and um before i get a little deeper into this thought tonight i hope you bear with me and i hope you're you bring your bibles and and you'll love this word and this word as you see the clarity of how god unfolds things you know that you begin to get a deeper appreciation of what it means to us and i don't know how it was for you but sunday's message really brought back to me how detailed god is i don't know if anybody else caught that that when god was describing the the candlesticks and describing these steves and describing how how much goal and the way it was and how it was one piece and you couldn't come and say well lord already you know it done it done that is not what i asked for i was very specific with what i wanted it you know there are people who you give things to do for you eh brother mikey imagine here you get something to walk with you and i tell them i want you to put on your work a certain way i wouldn't do the work i said no way i i've given it instructions i want this color tile and then this color tile cut this way and i want you to grout it this way and i might do a half piece work you say well that is not what i ask you to do the way god described what he wanted was so detailed it makes me wonder how detailed he is with describing us when god thinks about us and the details he put into us and the qualities he wants in us if he would spend so much time on the natural tabernacle how much more would he spend on the living tabernacles anybody with me tonight shaping and honing and and perfecting this this living tabernacle that he could dwell in anybody with me so just to to to know connect about uber's message and then to go a little bit there you know but we read in exodus 25 and it said and the lord speak unto moses i want to rewind a little bit to give a bit of context so in exodus 24 down to the tlm the end of exodus 24 from verse this is verse 15 and moses i'm going to go to this path a little faster because i want to get in the new testament right exodus 24 and verse 15 and moses went up into the mount and a cloud covered the mount and the glory of the lord aboard upon mount sinai and the cloud covered it six days and the seventh day he called unto moses out of the midst of the cloud and the sight of the glory of the lord was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of israel and moses went into the midst of the cloud and got him into the mount and moses was in the mount 40 days and 40 nights so i want to give a context to where moses was when god is now speaking to him starting in in exodus 25 and we would have read this on sunday and i'm going to kind of just browse through some of these quickly to just kind of paint a picture and the lord speak unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel that they bring me an offering of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart you shall take my offering i want to underline the word willingly because giving whether it is time whether it is talent or it is treasure god don't want you to give it because you're feeling pressed to give it god don't want you to give it because you're feeling convicted to give it god want you to give it because you understand the connection between what you're given unto the lord and a willingness to hit anybody with me so god had to lay down the condition upon which he operates and he starts to build a framework of why he wants it right he said speak unto the children of israel that they may bring me an offering of every man that given it willingly with his heart he shall take my offering and this is the offering which we shall take of them gold and silver and brass and blue and purple and scarlet and fine linen and goats here and ram skins dyed red and badger skins and and wood oil for the light spices and this is where you see the detail of god yes in bring whatever you want bring it how you want it he is being very specific and for sweet incense onix stones and stones will be set in the ephod and in the breastplate and let them make me a sanctuary that i may dwell among them all right and he goes on and on so the wall of exodus 25 is focused on what god wants to see but ambrose would have stopped i think around if i'm right uh around verse 22 of of exodus 25 round 22. so i i went on and reading and it goes on if you read beyond it and you can do it in your own private study down to verse 29 and downside make the dishes thereof and spoons thereof and covers thereof and bowls thereof to cover with a of pure gold outside make them so so on and on you see god given instructions he said this is what i want i want you to notice the detail he's giving him and then took quickly chapter 26 moreover though shall make that tabernacle with 10 curtains of fine twine linen and blue and purple so exodus 25 it starts the whole of exodus 26 is more detailed this is like a written blueprint it's like a blueprinted words all right so when you read this the entire of exodus 26 it's explaining the details of the description of this thing but god doesn't stop there no goes on to exodus 27 speaks now about the altar and it goes all even more and and and and not and the breadth of the court and the and i say but wait a minute look at the time and the effort and the care and the level of detail that god wants and how he requires this i want you to catch this now he in order for this to be accomplished he needs three things you need time he needs talent and he needs treasure because that is what he needs to be able to put this in place all right by the time we reach verse 28 he god is no longer describing and i want you to picture this moses is in mount sinai caught up being given instructions on what god wants by the time he reads verse 28 god says and take unto thee aaron thy brother and his sons and he goes on to describe the garments the detail of the garment so he's not even taking him for granted what aaron and the priest supposed to win all right so by the time he reached exodus 20th and was four and these are the garments which they shall make a breastplate and an ephod and a robe an embroidered coat a mitchell and a girdle and thou shall make holy garments for aaron thy brother and his sons that he may minister in unto me in the priest's office and they shall take gold and blue and purple so god keeps building and i want you to see now it is something he's trying to manifest it's something he's trying to display so why this is the kind of stuff why is it god didn't just create and put it there and you begin to understand by the time we reach the new testament that god put us here to achieve certain things not for our glory but for his glory for his honor all right so we're in verse 28 uh chapter 28 by by timothy chapter 29 it's a whole chapter now on the customs of the unleavened bread the ram and all these sacrifices still supposed to be done by the time you go to exodus 30 he spent an entire chapter speaking about the altar of incense the lava to wash so that they don't die and we went through that on sunday service i want you to see how many chapters god dedicated to this issue of the tabernacle the natural tabernacle the physical tabernacle don't you know you are the tabernacle of the temple of the holy ghost so god is unfolding a plan here okay so let's go on by the time we reach exodus 31 to see how god operates let us take a look at this exodus 31 verse 1 and the lord spake under moses saying see i have called by name bisalir the son of yuri the son of her of the tribe of judah and i have filled him with the spirit of god in wisdom and in understanding and in knowledge and in all manner of workmanship to devise cunning works to work in gold and in silver and in brass and in cutting of stones to suck them and then carving of timber to work in all manner of workmanship and i behold i have given with him aholia the son of so much of the tribe of dan and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted i have put wisdom that they may make all that i have commanded thee so god gave moses a road map the blueprint you tell him take up the treasure the offering for the plan the roadmap it's gonna take time to do it so you need time to do it you need treasure now god describe any talents in them god say i give you a man and i've given you his name who have given you wisdom listen that they make all that i've commanded you verse 7 the tabernacle so god now is describing to moses the skilled men and what they will be able to accomplish in verse seven the tabernacle of the congregation and the act of the testimony and the mercy seat that is there thereupon and all the furniture of the tabernacle and the table and his furniture and the pure candlestick with all its furniture and the order of incense and the altar of bird offering with all his funny team and the liver and his foot and the clots of service and the holy garments for aaron the priest and the garments of his sons to minister in the priest's office and the anointing oil and the sweet incense for the holy place according to all that have commanded thee shall they do so god not leaving anything to chance he's telling moses you will pick up the offering this is the plan you're going to have to take time to do it i'm giving you the talent to do it in other words moses is getting instructions on all the resources to be able to achieve god's purpose time talent treasure friends time talent and treasure is the same thing you need for a natural business anything you're trying to achieve you want to build a house you need to get it'll take some time to build your house you're going to have to get somebody scaled to build your house you're going to have to get the resources to build the house anything in life these principles are there so that's 31. interestingly verse 32 so just to seek context imagine this we just went from 25 to 31 and for those who see ten commandments ten commandments as you know left out a lot ten commandments portrays moses going up getting the the the two tablets are coming back don't be mounting you now see in the whole picture when moses went up all of this took place before he came down the mountain because verse chapter 32 says and when the people saw that moses delayed to come down out of the mount remember we read in 24 he was there 40 days and 40 nights getting the instructions in chapter 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 over the span of 40 days and 40 nights moses now wrapping up and while this is going on at some point in time when the people saw that moses delayed to come down out of the mount the people gathered themselves together on the arrow and said unto him up make us gods which shall go before us for as for this moses the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt we what not what has become of him again human behavior moses is gone as far as he concerned we don't know we're gonna be moses let's do something else and everyone said unto them break all the golden earrings which are the on in the ears of your wives of your sons and their daughters and bring them unto me and the people break off the golden earrings which were in the ears and brought them under aaron and he received them at their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool and he made and this is the golem calf i want to highlight something here quickly but over mentioned on sunday as well the children of israel came out of hundreds of years of bondage they had nothing so what they are giving up to make this golden calf is what they took from egypt there's a strong contrast with this passage of scripture here and what we'll get to briefly in exodus 35 about the willingness because here it doesn't mention willingness as a condition of people giving it doesn't say iran asks them all those who willing to bring something it doesn't say any people who were willing brought it it it just goes into saying these people just brought gold because this was in their heart to do it anybody with me so it is down to verse 7 the lord said unto moses go get thee down for thy people which god brought us out of the land of egypt have corrupted themselves so i want to now create this picture here you have moses spent 40 days 40 nights not 40 minutes not four minutes 40 days 40 nights in the presence of god god is describing the tabernacle the sacrifice how it's supposed to be and and moses has to now leave that august presence to deal with revelry and chaos and confusion and the people who he believes should be waiting on him to bring the word of the lord but the whole camp back season i don't want to spend too much time there because that's not where i really want to go but it is not until exodus 35 that we come back to the closing of the story that begins in 25 with the offering and i want to highlight something here now exodus 35 and moses gathered all the congregation of the children of israel together and said unto them these are the words which the lord have commanded that you should do them and he goes on verse five take e um take thee from among you and offering it to the lord listen again whoever is of a willing heart and that bothered me not in a negative sense but i'm thinking these children of israel didn't earn what they had and the fact that moses have to be seeing willingness speaks to the fact that there would have been people there who were not willing the only time eater mentioned willingness is if there are people who are not willing you know let him bring it an offering of the lord gold and silver and it goes into all of it right so i want to drop down and we're going to bring it close to this section of it verse 20 exodus 35 verse 20 and all the congregation of the children of israel departed from the presence of moses verse 21 and there came everyone whose heart stirred him up now i want to pause there the fact that the bible says and they came everyone whose heart stirred him up means that there were people whose hearts were not stood there's no need for it to see whose heart stood him up if everybody hat was stood and they came everyone whose heart stood him up and everyone whom his spirit made willing so it would have those who were not stood it would have those who not willing and they brought the lord's offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation and for all his service and for the holy garments and they came listen both men and women as many as were willing-hearted i'm seeing a recurring thing here so you could have time and not be willing you could have talent and not be willing you could have treasure and not be willing moses came from the presence of god and explained to the people check this what it was for what he needed done what god was trying to achieve and you had people who were not willing think about it just dropping quickly to verse 25 and all the women that were wise-hearted did spin with their hands that's talent spinning with your hands is not treasure treasures who bring in gold and these things but all the women ever whites did spin with their hands that is time and that is talent and broad that which they spun both of blue and of purple and of scarlet and of fine linen and all this in verse 26 and all the women whose hearts stirred them up in wisdom sponge go tear so in other words there's a skill to spin and there's a willingness to give the time to spin i want to i want to i want to make your point clear so it means that because only those who had certain in wisdom spun goats here so it'd have some sister somewhere who could spin but because of heart and still anybody with me any house tonight i don't know if this happened i know we never already preached this this way and spend time in this thing but i want you to really consider how you're using your time using your talent are you able to spin goats here whatever that is in your context you know situation but because your heart is still you better find a student tonight because what they were working towards was the kingdom you know it was the tabernacle of the lord it was the whole thing where the holy of holies was and there were people who were not willing who said i have fear nothing tonight you know martial still man i feel less stirring you wasted so i could say it this way we will know if you stood because it will show in how we use your time how we use your talent and how you use it your choice because this is what the script is unfolding here the three great resources that we have your time to pray sunday service brought a sacredness to the role of priests and prayer how much time do you give to prayer verse 29 he's still in exodus 35 verse 29 and he true enough israel brought a willing offering unto the lord every man and woman whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work which the lord had commanded to be made by the hand of moses can the church say amen so i don't want to jump from the old testament it's another section i want to get to in the old testament but by the grace of god maybe the next teaching but i want to jump to the new testament to kind of begin to bridge this because you have to look at the whole book to kind of see now how things begin to unfold and how it matters to us in this day as well we're talking about time we talk about talent we're talking about treasure and we have established that god and any way moses operated didn't just want the extra time or the extra talent or the extra treasure anybody with me it wasn't the the time that because you have extra time it's why you're here tonight you already didn't have anything to do you know you were just sitting there and you remember bible this wasn't planned you you you want someone talking about time talent and treasure willingness of heart means it's now important to you it's a priority to you you're willing it's important to you so you make the time you make a choice to use your talents your gifts these skills that god give you you don't want to use your talent and skill only for the world what can you do for the lord how can you help somebody how can you have a brother a sister somebody anybody with me there's a few scriptures before i bring to the next section talking about time ephesians 5 and verse 15 see that you walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise redeeming the time because the days are evil i want to read that you know i love going to the amplified to really amplified of that therefore see that you walk carefully living life with honor purpose and courage shunning those who tolerate and enable evil not as the unwise but as wise sensible intelligent discerning people making the very most of your time on earth recognizing and taking advantage of each opportunity and using it with wisdom and diligence because the days are filled with evil you hear the quality of that scripture the amplified version of that scripture so we're talking about this time resource and it's so touching because you know our dear friend and brother mundus is in a better place and i was talking to to gideon after the service and gideon said you know what struck him boy when you listen to what was said you could see the testimony and alive and he didn't say you know what i was thinking about what will people say about me boy in other words what people say about you is purely a function of how you use your time talent and treasure you know he was a party man he was a he was a fetter he was a dis he was at that nice time or he was in church in a prayer meeting encouraging somebody seeing what's going on with the brotherhood of fellowship dice time reading his bible in bible study having a positive conversation that time he was gossiping is time all of his time you know because actions live in time i want you to look at your time most people don't do a time audit of their lives it is amazing that very successful people people who run multiple companies you know they do have more time in a day than you do right than i do right people running five six seven 20 companies in the same 24 hours i said that somewhere before somebody's struggling to run their little shop and somebody else at the same time running 29 different businesses 5 000 employees is the same time but they have a deeper understanding of how to use time the bible talks about redeeming the time how we use our time how we spend our time our approach to time who do we spend time with but i'm saying you want to get the holy ghost spend time with people who have the holy ghost you want to learn new things spend time with people who can help share positive new things at the beginning of this pandemic we raise the point that people doing this pandemic during this lock don't do doing being at home they would spend their time watching youtube watching netflix watching movies watching i have other people who pick up courses and training and they grow and they start a business and it's the same time is this challenging anybody tonight the strength of your friendships of your relationships of your marriage of your connection of your fellowship with believers all of that is a function of your time i don't have any friends in church how much time do you spend calling people talking to people saying hello hi how was your day how was your week how are you coping how are you managing is there anything is there any way i could help is there any way i could bless you you you want me to pray for something for you that is time are you available for the lord it's a sacrifice anybody with me that was ephesians 5 15-16 first corinthians 10 23 and this is also tied to time and paul is speaking to the corinthians all things are lawful for me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but all things edify not and in the amplified itself all things are lawful that is morally legitimate permissible but not all things are beneficial or or advantageous all things are lawful but not all things are constructive to character and edifying to spiritual life so you have to know what are the activities the actions that would qualify as constructive to character and edifying the spiritual life i look forward to bible studies maybe more than some than some of you not as a teacher you know not as the person delivering bible study but i'm a student of the bible and i want to know if god give me a road map on how to smile in a dark moment and how to deal with adversity and how to make better choices how to make better decisions how to overcome conflict how to resolve challenges how to be a better planner i think i shared it with you before in my business i i personally don't like to take notes i'm not a no taker fans are real somebody frustrated and think they take notes you know and but you need notes you need to take notes so normally i would have somebody help take notes in a meeting until i see it in scripture how god tell moses write it down well when i was like a rebuke to me that was like your bone muslims right if god tell moses who leaving me two minutes take notes who am i i know i know moses if god tell poses i better i have to fix my stories i need to get better i need to improve i have to learn to take notes and that that inspires me it challenges me because i don't have i'm not leaving two million people moses had to take notes and he had two million people and he could have delegated it but god said no more says you do it i say lord help me but the word is there to inspire us to maybe do what we never thought we could do but when we see god dealing with people in different ways it will apply to us in different ways but coming to bible study isn't this qualifying as constructive to character and edifying the spiritual life haven't we spent a lot of time going through how god is interested in every area every facet of our life not just the revelation of the word and the mysteries but the daily life i'm still trying to get to maria taught tonight i reached it yet right so let's continue a little bit here right so we talk a little bit about time let's talk a little bit about talent and we find a touch on talent to a little bit of it in romans 12 but straight to eight just very quickly for i say through the grace given unto me paul speak to the real monster every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god had dealt with every man the measure of faith for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in christ and everyone remembers one of another i said this in the opening statement we all have different skills we all have different talents we all part of the same body we are all part of the economy of god we're all part of the machine of god we are part of the body of christ anybody with me right having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us so you can't learn the gift or acquire the gift this is gifts we talk about the grace of god being given anybody with me right heaven then gives differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith or ministry that is waiting on ministering or he that teach it on teaching or he didn't exhort it on exhortation he that give it so even giving is a gift oh no that's that's a that's a teaching on our teaching so he is describing a gift of giving let me say that one more time he is describing gifts and in the gifts that he is describing he is describing there's actually a gift of giving so that even if your gift is not ministering or exhortation or teaching you still have a gift to give of your time to give of your talent to give of your treasure anybody with me he that give it let him do it with simplicity he that ruleth so there's a gift that is given to rule that everybody is a ruler that everybody's a manager if it's a leader it could be situational but god is speaking about gifts he gives to rule with diligence he that showed mercy with cheerfulness all right so i want to just now dive a little bit now into my text tonight a little bit and i find it very interesting situation because a lot of people may not spend time really looking at this uh so i want to go to second corinthians second corinthians 8. and it's a really interesting powerful context of paul using some great wisdom to express something here and um i find it's interesting study because it it is also i think contextual too now and the situation and the pandemic and life in general so let's take a look at it and i'll be reading from the king james and with some port from the on the amplified version all right so second corinthians 8 and verse 1. so paul is speaking and if you don't read this slowly and carefully you will miss how critical what paul is addressing here so paul is saying in second corinthians eight and verse one moreover brethren we do you to wit of the grace of god be stored on the churches of macedonia so i actually went and looked at the meaning of the word wit in the context of the sentence and i checked within the amplified to understand that we know when god picked paul as the first messenger he took a man who was a student of gamaliel he was a he was a writer he was an academic he was a theologian he's very careful in his choice of words the word wit w-i-t is typically tied when they see somebody there's a quick wit it is tied to mean a certain level of intellectual understanding but the use of the width in this context really is tied to the association of ideas in a manner natural but unusual and striking so as to produce surprise joined with pleasure all right so this width is is in other words it's presenting an idea in a new and unexpected manner all right so in the amplifier let me read the same one versus one in the amplifier it says because paul is leaning a foundation for what he's about to teach and i trust that it helps us to relook at our situation and see how paul is presenting it he is speaking to the corinthians about the macedonians all right so he says again in the king james moreover brethren we do you to wit of the grace of god be stored on the churches of macedonia all right so in the amplified it says now brothers and sisters we want to tell you about the grace of god which has been evident in the churches of macedonia awakening in them a longing to contribute all right now verse two there's a there there is a theologian who has described this as a formula this is this is the wit this is the unnatural truth that is presented in another way listen to verse two how that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality that's the king james let me read it one more time so this is this is what paul so again i i don't know why this is really exciting to me because it really is paul is saying so much he says i want to tell all the believers in corinth about us what's happening in macedonia and and just to give a bit of background this scripture is dealing with a situation in jerusalem so you have to kind of i can't get it all but basically these believers in jerusalem are in trouble and paul is on a mission to help the brethren in jerusalem who going through deep hardship prior to this conversation with the corinthians the corinthians would have said we will help the macedonians would have said we will help everybody saying we will help however when paul and they now say well brethren and macedonia all they said only will help this is what paul observed how in a great trial of affliction and historians will say because of the gospel the macedonians were oppressed they lost a lot their businesses were under pressure they were being persecuted so they couldn't operate as they would so how in a great trial of affliction that's what they're referring to the abundance of their joy so in their affliction they have joy you see what paul is saying in the great trial of affliction they are bonded to their joy and now we contrast again and their deep poverty abounded onto riches of their liberality no you have to go and check the dictionary again that word liberality is not let me get the exact definition for you it speaks to it speaks to the quality of giving so it's not just giving so paul is speaking to the corinthians about the master doing and saying listen they're in a big trial but they enjoy they have lost a lot so they have deep poverty but the quality of their giving is different now i'm building into something yeah let me read it in the amplified for during a ordeal of severe distress their abundant joy and their deep poverty together overflowed in the wealth of their lavish generosity history king james for to their power idea record ye and beyond their power they were willing of themselves so paul is speaking to the corinthians about the mastodon and sing and then he amplified it says for i testify that according to the ability and beyond their ability they give voluntarily verse 3 praying us which much in treaty that we will receive the gift and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the sins now this praying here is not praying to god this praying when you really think every fight said begging us insistently for the privilege of participating in the service for the support of the saints in jerusalem that's the amplified so in other words when the brethren meet the macedonians and recognize the situation with the macedonians they became reluctant to even receive the gifts that the macedonians wanted to give them in so much that the macedonians began to beg and insist to still be part of the privilege of giving to the brethren in jerusalem now i'm building something and i want to connect something and i want you to understand where i'm going very carefully verse five and this they did not as we hoped but first gave their own selves to the lord and unto us by the will of god so paul is saying in the amplified not only did they give materially as we had hoped sorry not as we hope meaning paul expected them to just give a financial contribution to the believers in jerusalem but he's saying not only did they do that but first they give themselves to the lord and to us as his representatives by the will of god disregarding their personal interests and giving as much as they possibly could so they not only gave the treasure for the believers in jerusalem but they gave up their time they gave up their fellowship they made themselves available to them they made paul and his brethren feel welcome anybody with me so but understand this paul is related now to the corinthians the testimony of the macedonians but i want you to see where this is going to end up for paul's teaching huh and this they did not as we had hoped but first gave their own selves to the lord so we're talking about i raise it do you give your time to the lord do you give your prayer to the lord do you give your effort your talent to the lord she said it's not just stranger well i just put that offer in but i'm not available i'm i'm not available i'm not any service i'm not coming to help i don't want to clean the church i don't want to do anything else in so much this is now verse six that we desired titus that as he had begun so he would also finish in you the same grace also so paul is saying now titus was paul's associate he was his right hand in this context the last time titus clashed with the corinthians was in rebuking them on behalf of paul but now he's saying titus coming to finish this thing because titus is the one who is arranging this thing very bridging in jerusalem now this verse 7 is the challenge to us all this is what blew my mind completely so paul now is no so he's so at the end of verse five he is he stops speaking of the macedonians so from from verse one to verse five it's all about macedonians anybody with me from verse one to verse five it's about macedonians verse six he lets them know that titus remember this is a letter this is paul's letter to the corinthians so he's writing to the corinthians in verse 1 to verse 5 about what happened with the macedonians who despite their troubles their afflictions their pressures their their issues they have not reneged on their commitment their their their commitment to time talent and treasure to the sake of the kingdom he said titus is coming who are no only no titus in verse six all right now verse seven is where i look at my life your life our lives as believers and he says here therefore as ye abound in everything in faith and utterance and knowledge and in all diligence and in your love to us see that he abound in this grace also no you see this scripture right here this scripture is i have not heard anybody present this personally in in the context of what paul intends is here to to to see it in this way paul from verse one to verse five and verse six is speaking about the macedonians giving and now he now switches to the corinthians and says and i'll read it in the amplified but just as you excel in everything and lead the way in faith in speech in knowledge in genuine concern and in your love for us see that you excel in this gracious work of giving also so paul is saying your faith your testimony your knowledge your diligence your love if you have all that covered you still need to also be a giver this is not giving in response to judgment or if you don't give it a listen to now verse 8 i speak not by commandment i love it you say i'm not telling you to do this you know it's not a commandment but by occasion of the forwardness of others and to prove the sincerity of your love so paul is this is a master stroke of a letter because he's challenging his believers and a theologian wrote that paul was addressing because the believers in current wasn't feeling divish the willingness to give or the promise to give or he said he was dealing with that's why he would have had to adjust the issue so paul is saying here i speak not by commandment i want to come and tell you all you have to do it you know why because way back in in exodus we read god wanted to do it willingly so paul now who understands the principle say i speak not by commandment because i don't want you to do it because i'm telling you to do it but i have a reason to do it which is by occasion of the forwardness of others which means the macedonians are set a good example for us and to you you need to prove the sincerity of your love let me read it in the amplified i'm not going to be too much longer i am not saying this as a command to dictate to you but to prove by pointing out the enthusiasm of others the sincerity of your love as well so paul is saying holy show your loved one don't make it a commandment look what other virgin are doing what are you doing with your time with your talent with your treasure to support the believers to support the brethren this is a body kingdom and then now paul goes on because now we give him now supported now now he's going into the deeper things verse nine for we know the grace of our lord jesus christ that doki was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that he through his poverty might be rich and herein i give my advice so this is the first time paul is now speaking now if you want my advice on the matter if you want my position on the matter for this is expedient for you who have begun before not only to do but also to be forward a year ago now let me read this in the in the amplified so you'll see what this is here from verse 9. for you are recognizing more clearly this is verse 9 are going in the amplified for you are recognizing more clearly the grace of our lord jesus christ his astonishing kindness his generosity his gracious favor that though he was rich yet for your sake he became poor so that by his poverty you might become rich abundantly blessed i give you my opinion in this matter that's advice in the king james this is to your advantage who were to the first to begin a year ago not only to take action to help the believers in jerusalem but also first a desire to do it so paul is saying to them you in corinth were the first of the groups to say i want to help i'm not only acting like you don't want to help but i want you to understand how paul is dealing with his situation and presenting to them that listen all you have mysteries although you have knowledge all you have to have do you think if you don't do this part of the other thing too you're missing the whole story you know i'm almost done verse 11. now therefore perform the doing of it in other words get it done that as there was a readiness to will so there may be a performance also of that which he have in the amplified so paul now saying so now finish this so that your eagerness in desiring it may be equaled by your completion of it according to your ability so i'm wondering why is it paul now have to appeal this is paul the apostle paul the first messenger first appealing to people listen all your promise you say you will help you see you will support you see you will give you time you see he will give you a talent you'll see it give you trouble oh gosh keep your word now you have knowledge you have wisdom you have a but would you be so selfish all this in scripture you know context all right i'm almost done let's go i want to go to the next chapter in second corinthians second corinthians nine and just three verses from verse six and just to see and even i don't have the time to get into all of it now the pentecostals misappropriate these scriptures but what i have found in the message people have so want to distance themselves from the pentecostals mockery that they miss the fact that this is still a truth not because somebody abused the truth changes the fact that it is the truth whatever you spend your time on you will get the results of it whatever you spend your talent on you'll get the results of it whatever you spend your treasure on your sp you're getting results of it so paul is saying in second corinthians uh verse uh second recording nine verse six but this i say he would sow it sparingly shall reap also sparingly and he which sow it bountifully shall reap also bountifully it's a law it's a principle every man according as he purpose it in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or of necessity for god love with a cheerful giver now this so i want people just talk about god love our cheerful giver but this is actually still addressing the issue from the previous chapter you know so i don't want it out of context goal of our chair forgive us god was dealing now this chapter just very quickly starts in in verse one for us touching the minister into the scenes it is superfluous for me to write to you in the amplified just so you understand he's not talking about preaching to these sins you know in the army i said no it is unnecessary for me to write to you about the offering that is to be made to the scenes in jerusalem for i know your eagerness i'm reading the amplified because it'll be a little easier to catch for i know your eagerness to promote this cause and i have proudly boasted to the people of macedonia about it telling them that akaya has been prepared since last year for this contribution and your enthusiasm has inspired the majority of them to respond still i am sending the brothers to you so that our pride in you may not be empty boast in this case so that you may be prepared just as i told them you would be otherwise if any macedonians come with me and find you unprepared we say nothing of ourselves will be humiliated before being so confident this is why i thought it necessary to urge these brothers to go to you before i come and make arrangements in advance for this generous previously promised gift of yours so that it will be ready not as something extorted or wrong out of you but as a voluntary and generous gift that is the context leading up to this and now verse 6. now remember this he who so sparingly will also reap sparingly and he who sows generously this is believers he talking to you know so i want in this teaching tonight we will look at these three things these three levers that we have time talent treasure because it's a choice the fact that paul was pleading to them was connected to the fact that he knew they had a choice of how to give their time how to give their talent how to give their treasure he said the believers in macedonia have issues and they made the commitment not only make their commitment but they welcome us they were hospitable to us they they they they they they more than we expected from them anybody with me let me jump to the last section of this jesus speaking matthew 6 verse 1 and between [Music] this matthew 6 chapter is where you find the lord's prayer and a deep part of praying has to do with sacrifice giving something you bring in a lamb you bring in something that's how the sacrifice was done we bring a sacrifice even praises and sacrifice you know when you begin to see that then you begin to worship and praise differently because you realize that god can't bless you without something you can't come empty-handed to the lord let me see it again you can't come with your hand open to receive from the law without bringing something anybody with me so the salmon is a sacrifice of praise that it serves as a sacrifice and what makes it a sacrifice is when you don't even feel like you have something to praise god for but you're still praying so there's a cost to that praise you lost something but you still praise god that's a sacrifice you praise him for the loss it's count you into it it's against expectation it's not what people expect you to do you're supposed to be sad but you're praising god anyhow you're supposed to be depressed but you're worshiping god anyhow it's a sacrifice i want to draw your attention we can go very quickly as we close out matthew 6. and in this matthew 6 by the time you reach uh verse 9 we enter the lord's prayer right i want to identify so matthew 6 so this is how jesus actually so this is the sermon that leads to the lord's prayer and you wonder why of all the things that god can speak about when he's on it before the lord's pray he starts off matthew 6 with take heed that you do not your arms before men this is your giving that's what arms is your financial giving before men to be seen of them otherwise you may have no reward of your father which in heaven therefore when thou does thine arms not if it's not if you're doing it he said when you do it do not sign a trumpet before the as the hypocrites do in these synagogues and in the streets that they may have glory verse three but when don't do this don't let your left know the right thing to do it that your arm may be in secret and my father would see it in secret will reward the openly and now he is building something he switches down from arms to wendell prius now you trying to understand the mind of god he is bringing he is walking towards the lord's prayer and his tying sacrifice and your operation and your tying your talent on your treasure all of it connected of what you give he said okay noah dealt with the arms issue by verse nine when thou prays thou shalt not be as he approaches the same thing like the arms and by time he come down to verse six everybody want to go into the secret closet but verse six is the same thing of being giving in secret in verse four that then arms may be in secret in verse four is the same thing when the prayers in verse six enter in thy closet that went out shut this door pray to the father with in secret god parallel the same thing and then by verse nine he's like and after this manner therefore pray he our father which art in heaven prayer is giving time prayer is itself a sacrifice giving your time your talent your treasure i trust tonight you will look at your position on things i trust tonight if your position was like the corinthians with knowledge and revelation and understanding so paul would say with all your knowledge understanding and a given you are leaders he said you are first in these things be first also in your giving most of us don't give enough to the kingdom of god i'm just i'm just talking financially i'm talking about your time your talent and your treasure all three and they're just talking about attendance in church but when last year find out can i help somebody is there somebody in need because helping somebody in need could be giving them some time helping them in some way give them some talent they need something that you can help them facilitate you giving them some treasure many people go into struggles in this pandemic time talent treasure a study on giving can we bore our heads heavenly father we thank you tonight lord for helping us to see through scripture lord who you could do anything that you want to do you are sovereign there's nothing limiting what you can do what you can achieve what you can put in place lord father when [Music] the disciples needed to pay taxes you made it possible that you could find gold in a fish when jonah needed to go to nineveh you provided a fish for him lord there are so many examples through scripture of how you did what would be considered the impossible but when you wanted to interact with man and man to interact with it's fellow man and you wanted to have a tabernacle to dwell in lord you wanted to use talent time and treasure to take your blueprints that you had in your mind that you expressed to moses and say moses this is what i wanted done it's so shocking to see that after moses brought the people out and he spent time in your presence and got insight into your thinking the details of the blueprint but even when he presented it the bible has to show us there were people who were not willing there were people who were at the time who didn't come people who had the talent who didn't come people who were the treasure and they didn't come they were just not willing lord and to see the examples in a new testament with paul finding himself as an apostle a messenger a star having to plead over two chapters we read with the believers in corinth who understanding the responsibility the ministry the challenges they knew the situation in jerusalem they knew the situation the challenges even after hearing the trials of the macedonians and and what they did paul said had to plead and press them and say listen i know what you have but you can do better you can do more you can give more to the cause of this gospel what we have lord is not our own it's for your glory it's for your honor it's for your purpose help us to be givers lord to see how much you have given to us when we have nothing had nothing and you give your love to find us make us more like you help us to be true christians in every area of our lives not just to have a testimony of of how we live and how we move and and what
