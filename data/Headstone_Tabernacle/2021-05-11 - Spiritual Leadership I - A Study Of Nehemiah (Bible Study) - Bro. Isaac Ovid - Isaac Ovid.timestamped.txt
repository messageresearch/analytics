[16:03] take it for granted thank you so much
[16:04] brother anthony
[16:05] for being so dedicated you're
[16:07] appreciated by the anthony o'brien this
[16:08] evening
[16:11] faithful soldier of the lord faithful
[16:14] servant
[16:15] of the lord and dedicated uh to
[16:19] to being ever-present support
[16:23] and truly we see the lord using him to
[16:26] create an atmosphere
[16:27] that he could just enter in that even
[16:29] though we're in our homes
[16:30] you know you could feel the anointing
[16:32] and to know that there are other
[16:33] believers that are connected
[16:35] you know it's it's a special strength
[16:38] that
[16:38] you know in this dimension this realm
[16:40] that we are in where we could all
[16:43] be connected around a central theme as
[16:45] it were
[16:46] we could be connected knowing that it's
[16:48] already done
[16:49] you know before i get into the teaching
[16:52] tonight
[16:53] um you know it's it's it's been
[16:57] it's been a time it's been a time you
[16:59] know we've been
[17:00] in this journey for over a year now and
[17:03] i can see
[17:04] you know they call it the new normal but
[17:07] it still doesn't feel normal
[17:09] you know there's there's no way i think
[17:12] the world can get
[17:13] accustomed to it as much as the world
[17:16] and
[17:16] who definitely you have to accept
[17:17] certain things there's this almost
[17:20] roller coaster context that
[17:23] you know we have started to get used to
[17:27] you know and and i've found and i
[17:29] realized that when you
[17:31] you know if you feed your spirit and
[17:33] your heart and your mind with
[17:35] with negativity and you feel your spirit
[17:37] in your mind with what's happening with
[17:39] the virus and these things
[17:40] it could make you feel a certain kind of
[17:42] way but i can assure you tonight
[17:45] if you feed on the word of god and you
[17:48] feed on god's promises
[17:50] and you feed on the plans that god has
[17:52] for you
[17:53] and you feed on what god says concerning
[17:56] you
[17:57] that your whole outlook on life will be
[17:59] different
[18:00] so i want to encourage you tonight while
[18:03] there is wisdom
[18:04] in being conscious and aware of what is
[18:07] going on
[18:08] it is critical that you fortify your
[18:11] heart and your mind
[18:12] and your spirit and your consciousness
[18:15] with who you are
[18:17] not with an arrogance and and a lack of
[18:20] wisdom
[18:21] but the truth and the reality that jesus
[18:23] paid it all
[18:25] our fate and our confidence in his word
[18:28] is real
[18:29] our trust is real and his sacrifice on
[18:32] khalp he was real
[18:33] we are not asking god to do what he has
[18:36] not already done he has already done it
[18:38] he has paid for your healing he has paid
[18:40] for your strength he has paid for your
[18:42] comfort
[18:43] so i want to challenge and encourage the
[18:45] church tonight
[18:46] lift yourself up out of the negativity
[18:50] lift yourself out of the mind battles
[18:54] the battle is in the mind you know i
[18:56] i've seen a lot of people
[18:58] struggling in recent times and it's easy
[19:01] to let your mind and
[19:02] and that's the devil playground you know
[19:04] he comes and say hey you're feeling too
[19:06] good you know
[19:06] and and this and that and before you
[19:08] know it you're in a state of being
[19:10] and and i want you to take faith and
[19:12] trust and confidence
[19:14] that god is in control god is in control
[19:17] he is sitting on the throne
[19:19] and nothing can happen that god does not
[19:21] allow to happen
[19:22] and if god allows something to happen it
[19:24] is for his honor
[19:25] it is for his glory and all things work
[19:28] together for good
[19:29] to them that love god and to them that
[19:31] are called according to his purpose
[19:34] the bible many times says fear not fear
[19:36] not
[19:37] fear not fear not for we have not been
[19:39] given the spirit of
[19:40] bondage again to fear so fear is not in
[19:43] our vocabulary it's not in our heart
[19:45] i'm not saying you're walking wrong
[19:46] scene i have feet and it's just brash
[19:48] walking around
[19:49] but i want you to understand that fear
[19:51] is not your promise
[19:52] faith is your promise healing is your
[19:55] promise
[19:55] strength is your promise confidence in
[19:58] god's word
[19:59] is your promise and having wisdom to
[20:01] navigate this time
[20:03] counts more than ever so by the grace of
[20:06] god tonight i trust that'll be an
[20:08] encouragement to you
[20:09] and that you could you know shake
[20:12] yourself and realize that although we
[20:14] may be virtual as it were god still
[20:17] expects us to grow
[20:18] he still expects us to learn he still
[20:20] expects as brother
[20:22] would say that process of character
[20:24] development because
[20:25] throughout all of this there are people
[20:27] who are growing
[20:28] and there are people who are dying there
[20:30] are people who are
[20:31] growing in god and the people who faith
[20:34] just getting crumpled up
[20:35] because you're not feeding your feet
[20:38] you're not
[20:38] building your feet so we come tonight by
[20:40] the grace of god to see our faith and
[20:43] our confidence built in the word of god
[20:44] tonight
[20:46] i do have a little thought um
[20:49] and if i could give it a little title
[20:50] tonight uh for this bible study
[20:53] it's spiritual leadership part one
[20:56] spiritual leadership part one
[20:58] and we are going to do a study of
[21:01] nehemiah tonight
[21:02] and before i get into that i just want
[21:04] to talk about leadership a little bit
[21:06] you know i
[21:07] remember speaking about leadership and
[21:10] preaching on leadership in the past and
[21:11] many times
[21:13] you know when we speak about spiritual
[21:15] leadership
[21:16] um they're really two sides of spiritual
[21:18] leadership
[21:19] there's firstly the more important side
[21:21] of being led
[21:23] so we talk about and and in the service
[21:25] i believe but over the last service or
[21:26] so
[21:27] he was speaking about simeon being led
[21:30] and blind
[21:31] anna being led that spiritual leadership
[21:34] that to know that your movements your
[21:36] actions your decisions
[21:39] you're being led by god so there's a
[21:41] difference with spiritual leadership
[21:43] versus being led by anything else being
[21:46] led by
[21:46] your boss being led by you know your gut
[21:49] instinct being led by
[21:50] fear the people who are led by fear you
[21:52] know fear drives people and when you
[21:54] release it wasn't leading you to make
[21:55] that decision
[21:56] it's fear or it's greed people are led
[21:59] by greed
[22:00] you know why did you buy that well i i
[22:03] i'm not sure
[22:04] and and when you really discern the root
[22:06] cause of it something is driving the
[22:09] action
[22:10] so if you find yourself doing something
[22:12] that you shouldn't be doing
[22:13] and you're not sure why you did it
[22:15] something led you
[22:17] you know you could call it influence you
[22:20] could call it whatever it is but the
[22:21] point is you can move from one state to
[22:23] the other
[22:23] without some type of leadership having
[22:25] an impact on it
[22:27] you may not realize you're being led but
[22:29] in reality there are only two categories
[22:31] in the world you're either a leader or
[22:32] your follower
[22:34] and if you realize that your state of
[22:35] being is
[22:37] not where you think you should be or
[22:38] you're not sure where you are or
[22:40] whatever then
[22:41] then something led you people listen to
[22:42] music and their behavior conforms to
[22:45] music
[22:46] and they don't discern and realize that
[22:47] the music led them to a certain state of
[22:49] being a certain
[22:50] emotional state so leadership is a
[22:52] multifaceted thing
[22:54] and we understand and we should
[22:56] appreciate being in this room tonight
[22:58] that spiritual leadership above all else
[23:00] is important
[23:01] because we want to be led by god we want
[23:03] to be influenced by god
[23:05] we want to be sensitive to that still
[23:08] small voice that tells us
[23:10] what to do and how to move and how to
[23:12] live and how to act
[23:15] but spiritual leadership has another
[23:17] dimension to it
[23:18] beyond just being led by god and being
[23:22] the receiving end of leadership
[23:24] we are all challenged to be leaders
[23:26] ourselves
[23:27] the reality is and i've been on this for
[23:29] a while where god told moses you'll be a
[23:32] kingdom of priests
[23:34] the role of king and role of priests
[23:36] abode leadership roles
[23:39] by the time you read your new testament
[23:40] the bible says you are kings and priests
[23:43] so if you are in this room i'm speaking
[23:45] to leaders tonight
[23:46] not followers as young people we
[23:49] challenge you
[23:50] that you shouldn't be following anybody
[23:52] peer pressure
[23:53] are words that doesn't affect us because
[23:56] we are the ones who put pressure on our
[23:57] peers and not the other way around
[23:59] because we are leaders and not followers
[24:02] leadership
[24:02] is a make-or-break type situation
[24:05] companies
[24:06] rise and fall on leadership governments
[24:09] rise and fall
[24:10] on leadership kingdoms rise and fall
[24:13] on leadership families rise and fall
[24:16] on leadership leadership is a vast study
[24:20] millions of dollars have been invested
[24:22] in analyzing what makes the perfect ceo
[24:25] from a leadership perspective
[24:29] countless hours of research people look
[24:32] at the largest companies in the world
[24:34] and look
[24:34] that people have the same 24 hours a day
[24:40] and because of leadership people
[24:42] accomplish different things
[24:44] you look through the scripture and you
[24:46] see god has a hand
[24:47] in who he chooses for leadership
[24:50] moses didn't apply for his position
[24:53] david didn't apply for his position
[24:55] elijah didn't apply for his position god
[24:59] was hand picking
[25:00] leaders leaders he can trust leaders he
[25:03] could have confidence
[25:04] in and leaders he can use now in this
[25:08] day
[25:08] we speak of the hardest age the toughest
[25:11] age
[25:12] the most difficult age god would have
[25:15] had to spend
[25:16] extra time to identify leaders that he
[25:18] could place in different companies
[25:20] in different neighborhoods in different
[25:22] families in different roles and
[25:24] responsibilities
[25:25] that he could call his leaders of today
[25:28] kings and priests
[25:30] as parents we are charged to lead
[25:34] lead by example lead by our choice of
[25:37] words
[25:38] lead by how we give comfort lead by how
[25:41] we negotiate
[25:42] lead by how we influence no matter your
[25:46] role
[25:46] no matter your responsibility whether it
[25:49] is leadership entitled or not
[25:52] you are still a leader leadership is not
[25:56] just about rank leadership can be
[25:58] situational
[26:01] i have certain skills i am not a hiker i
[26:04] am not a hunter
[26:05] if i take my team in my office out
[26:08] to hike or hunt although i am leader
[26:12] in the office i don't trust myself nor
[26:15] should my company trust me
[26:17] to be the leader on the hike
[26:20] because that is not my experience it is
[26:22] not my strength so leadership can be
[26:24] situational
[26:25] sometimes a situation happens and and
[26:28] somebody needs first aid
[26:29] the leader is the person who can
[26:31] administer the first aid
[26:34] isn't that right so depending on the
[26:37] situation
[26:38] depending on the context we talk about
[26:41] leadership
[26:43] but now let's bring into our theme on
[26:45] our topic tonight
[26:47] because by the grace of god we'll see
[26:49] how god will unfold this to us
[26:51] leadership is such a vast area of study
[26:53] but we want to hone in
[26:55] on a study here on nehemiah who
[26:59] is one of the most interesting
[27:01] interesting studies in scripture
[27:04] on the rise of a leader the growth
[27:08] of a leader and before i get into
[27:10] nehemiah himself i want to give a little
[27:11] bit of a background
[27:13] so around 605 or so
[27:16] to around 586 bc god would have chased
[27:20] on his people
[27:22] because of their continued
[27:23] unfaithfulness to his covenant
[27:27] you would know through the old testament
[27:29] there will be this
[27:31] valley and mountains of the children of
[27:34] israel being
[27:36] you know in line with god and then
[27:38] there's this decline
[27:39] there's this descent from point of
[27:42] victory
[27:42] to somehow something happening idol
[27:45] worship this that or the other and they
[27:47] descend
[27:48] so god is upset he's looking at what's
[27:50] going on
[27:51] and because of their unfaithfulness he
[27:53] allows
[27:54] the babylonians to suck and destroy
[27:58] jerusalem jerusalem the city of peace
[28:02] jerusalem where the temple is
[28:04] established
[28:05] god allows it however
[28:09] as god's word always is he promises his
[28:12] people that after
[28:13] 70 years of captivity they would be
[28:15] allowed to return
[28:17] context for this will be found in
[28:19] jeremiah 25
[28:21] 20 11. i'm just going to read it we will
[28:23] find our substantive text shortly
[28:25] but in jeremiah 25 verse 10
[28:28] bible says moreover i will take from
[28:30] them the voice of muth
[28:32] so god is talking about his own people i
[28:34] will take the voice of myth
[28:36] mirth is is like laughter so the voice
[28:38] of laughter
[28:40] and the voice of gladness the voice of
[28:43] the bridegroom
[28:44] and the voice of the bride the sound of
[28:47] the millstones that's working on the
[28:49] light of the candle
[28:50] and this whole land shall be desolation
[28:53] and an astonishment
[28:55] and these nations shall serve the king
[28:57] of babylon 70 years
[28:59] and it shall come to pass when 70 years
[29:01] accomplish
[29:02] that i will punish the king of babylon
[29:05] this reminds you
[29:06] almost as as the children of israel
[29:08] going into egypt and after 400 years god
[29:11] brings them out
[29:12] here it is goddess and i will punish the
[29:14] king of babylon
[29:15] and that nation said the lord for the
[29:17] iniquity
[29:18] and the land of the chaldeans and i will
[29:20] make it a perpetual desolation
[29:25] so this is the context and the
[29:27] background that we are building into
[29:29] and if you were to study the book of
[29:30] ezra which is deeply connected to the
[29:33] book of nehemiah
[29:34] we would see that within the book of
[29:36] ezra
[29:37] we see the recording and the elements of
[29:40] the recording or the fulfillment of this
[29:41] pro
[29:42] of this promise the return to jerusalem
[29:46] after the people would have been taken
[29:48] from jerusalem
[29:50] would have been supported through three
[29:52] persian kings cyrus
[29:55] darius and ataxis i'm not going to get
[29:58] too deep into that just some historical
[29:59] context before we come to our
[30:01] substantive text tonight
[30:03] cyrus would have overthrown babylon in
[30:05] 539 bc and in accordance with his policy
[30:10] of freeing people who were in captivity
[30:13] he would have issued a decree
[30:14] to allow jews to return to jerusalem
[30:20] historians say that around maybe 50 000
[30:22] of them also
[30:24] would have gone back to jerusalem
[30:28] and the foundation or saw the temple
[30:30] would have been rebuilt with zerubbabel
[30:32] ezra would lead a second return
[30:36] to jerusalem in around 458 bc
[30:40] and our study tonight deals with the
[30:42] third return
[30:44] under nehemiah just about 12 years or so
[30:48] after ezra went back to jerusalem
[30:52] we find our text just before we get into
[30:55] it just for historical context
[30:58] daniel would have been taken about into
[31:00] babylon with the first exiles
[31:03] so this journey would have started with
[31:05] danielle going into babylon
[31:07] the complete fall of jerusalem most of
[31:10] the jews would be now in babylon
[31:12] cyrus will overthrow babylon zerubbabel
[31:15] will take some people back
[31:16] the temple would begin to be rebuilt
[31:19] queen esther would be around that time
[31:21] as well as we fade into closer to our
[31:23] text tonight
[31:24] ezra will carry the second wave back to
[31:26] jerusalem
[31:27] and here we meet nehemiah still there
[31:31] all right so let's go to the book of
[31:33] nehemiah
[31:35] chapter one and verse one
[31:40] nehemiah right between ezra and esther
[31:48] the words of nehemiah the son
[31:52] of hercelia
[31:55] and it came to pass that in the
[31:58] manchester
[31:59] in the 20th year as i was in shushan
[32:02] the palace now
[32:07] this month here is like is the ninth
[32:10] month
[32:10] in the jewish calendar which is like
[32:12] november december
[32:14] or wrongly in november december in in
[32:15] our in our context
[32:17] so it came to pass in the manchester in
[32:20] the 20th year as i was in shush on the
[32:22] palace
[32:24] that hannah and i one of my brethren
[32:26] came
[32:27] he and certain men of judah
[32:31] and of judah basically mean they came
[32:34] from judah and when they came
[32:37] and i asked them concerning the jews
[32:40] that had escaped
[32:42] which were left of the captivity and
[32:44] concerning
[32:45] jerusalem so here we find a situation
[32:51] and the bible doesn't give us a
[32:52] background of nehemiah
[32:55] how he grew up what his context was we
[32:57] find a snapshot
[32:58] of nehemiah saying he is in shushan
[33:01] which is like iran today he is in the
[33:04] palace
[33:05] and one of his brethren comes from judah
[33:08] so this is somebody who would have
[33:10] returned to jerusalem come to visit him
[33:14] it doesn't tell us why nehemiah is still
[33:16] there
[33:18] because they would have been all given
[33:20] the opportunity to go to jerusalem
[33:22] everybody with me but nehemiah finds
[33:25] himself still
[33:26] there in shushan the palace
[33:29] and he is visited so clearly he has some
[33:33] he still has his connection to his
[33:34] people but there's some connection as
[33:37] well to
[33:38] his his place where he's serving as it
[33:41] will
[33:41] all right so he asked a question and
[33:45] it's interesting
[33:46] he asked them concerning the jews that
[33:48] had escaped so he wants to know about
[33:50] the welfare
[33:52] about those who are left and he wants to
[33:54] know about what's happening
[33:56] in jerusalem in other words what's
[33:59] happening with my people
[34:02] not just my people but jerusalem is
[34:04] special what is happening
[34:06] with jerusalem
[34:09] and they said unto me verse 3 the
[34:11] remnants that are left of the captivity
[34:14] there in the province are in great
[34:16] affliction and reproach
[34:20] the wall of jerusalem also is broken
[34:22] down
[34:23] and the gates thereof are burned with
[34:26] fire
[34:29] verse 4 and it came to pass
[34:32] so this is nehemiah speaking and it came
[34:34] to pass when i heard these words
[34:37] that i sat down and wept and
[34:40] mourned certain days and fasted
[34:44] and prayed before the god of heaven so i
[34:48] want to
[34:48] first highlight something here
[34:51] it means that when nehemiah heard this
[34:55] the news was so troubling to him
[34:58] that he was overwhelmed by it but i want
[35:01] us to notice
[35:02] his first response yes he sat down
[35:07] yes he wept yes he moaned
[35:11] but he fasted and prayed before the god
[35:13] of heaven
[35:15] many of us we go through different
[35:17] experiences where we get bad news
[35:19] because to nehemiah this was bad news
[35:23] not just bad news this was a series of
[35:27] bad news
[35:28] he has told that the remnants are in
[35:30] great affliction
[35:32] they are in reproach the walls are
[35:35] broken down
[35:36] and the gates are burnt that is like
[35:38] four pieces of
[35:40] bad news so the people are in trouble
[35:43] the city is in trouble and the city
[35:46] being in trouble is about the wall
[35:48] being broken down many times we hear
[35:51] about
[35:52] the wars need to come down the walls
[35:54] need to come down this is different
[35:56] this is where the walls have to go up
[36:00] here we're talking about the walls of
[36:02] defense
[36:04] because not only were his people in
[36:07] trouble
[36:08] but walls serve also as protection
[36:12] so we're not talking here about walls of
[36:14] jealousy and walls of envy and walls
[36:16] between churches and that's not
[36:17] what we're talking about here right now
[36:18] we're talking about jerusalem being
[36:20] unprotected
[36:22] what good is it to have a wall and
[36:26] the gate is not there so not only was
[36:28] the wall
[36:29] broken down but the gates also burned
[36:32] with fire
[36:33] so nehemiah is in sun as it were
[36:39] serving in his role which we will
[36:42] discover what it is as it were
[36:44] but he hasn't lost his burden anybody
[36:46] with me
[36:47] he hasn't lost his concern he hasn't
[36:50] lost his connection with what is
[36:52] important
[36:53] the people of god having a need
[36:56] he is interested in their well-being
[36:58] he's interested in how are things with
[36:59] them
[37:00] he's entrusted with the city that sacred
[37:02] city of jerusalem
[37:04] and what's going on there and it
[37:05] troubles him so much
[37:08] that he weeps he sits down and he mourns
[37:11] to mourn is a deep word
[37:13] because mourn is not it's not whale morn
[37:15] is when you realize something has died
[37:20] to him it is dead and that itself is
[37:23] a grief that comes with it but what i
[37:25] love about this he doesn't sit down
[37:27] there and stay in moping
[37:28] and stay crying he fasts and he prays
[37:32] anybody with me i want to go quickly
[37:34] into his prayer verse 5
[37:36] and said i beseech thee oh lord god of
[37:38] heaven
[37:40] and i want to give us a context of
[37:41] prayer because
[37:43] therein in things like these or
[37:45] scriptures like these
[37:46] this is what should help us with how we
[37:48] structure how we pray
[37:50] because his situation was such that it's
[37:53] a great situation
[37:54] and we are seeing into who this nehemiah
[37:57] is not a priest
[38:00] nehemiah is not a prophet nehemiah
[38:04] is up to this moment and nobody
[38:08] let me be clear within the context of
[38:12] jerusalem
[38:13] nobody knows who he is anybody with
[38:15] anybody with me
[38:17] but he's a spiritual man because his
[38:19] default
[38:20] first response is prayer and fasting
[38:22] what is your default
[38:24] first response what is your first
[38:27] response
[38:27] when a situation takes place i want you
[38:32] to think about that
[38:33] these are the probing questions
[38:36] let's go his prayer and said i beseech
[38:39] thee o lord god of heaven
[38:41] the great and terrible god that keep it
[38:44] covenant and mercy for them that love
[38:46] him
[38:47] and observe his commandments let thine
[38:50] air now be attentive
[38:51] and then eyes open that thou mayest hear
[38:54] the prayer
[38:55] of thy servant which i pray thee now
[38:58] day and night for the children of israel
[39:01] thy servants
[39:03] and confess the sins of the children of
[39:05] israel
[39:06] which we have sinned against thee now
[39:10] both i and my father's house have sinned
[39:14] now bear in mind he hasn't asked for
[39:16] anything yet
[39:19] i want us to acknowledge the structure
[39:22] of his prayer
[39:24] he acknowledges who god is i beseech the
[39:27] o lord god of heaven
[39:28] the great and terrible god that keep it
[39:31] covenant and mercy
[39:33] for them that love him and observe his
[39:35] commandments
[39:36] so he said i acknowledge who you are i
[39:38] acknowledge your role i acknowledge who
[39:41] i'm coming to
[39:42] i'm not coming casually i'm not coming
[39:45] not with a revelation of who you are
[39:47] what you could do your power your grace
[39:49] your majesty your might your dominion
[39:52] and then he goes from who god is
[39:56] to the call to attention let thine air
[39:58] now be attentive
[40:00] it's like we're singing past be not or
[40:02] gentle savior
[40:03] hear my cry oh god an attendant to my
[40:06] prayer
[40:08] let daniel be intended by nine eyes open
[40:10] that domius here in the prayer of thy
[40:12] servant
[40:12] which i pray before thee day and night
[40:15] so we see already there's this
[40:19] connection and a consistency with
[40:22] nehemiah having a prayer life
[40:24] and we'll see it highlighted later on as
[40:26] we go on this is not
[40:27] like in recent times people like to take
[40:31] vitamins when they feel sick
[40:34] and i've realized that many of us say
[40:36] you take a bite when you take a vitamin
[40:37] c you take this you take that
[40:39] no i get enough feeling that i'm feeling
[40:40] that i'm feeling good and you're not
[40:41] taking it but the moment you get a bad
[40:43] feeling
[40:43] you have any emergency you have any
[40:45] reduction and and you take it for that
[40:48] period of time
[40:49] to try to get feeling a little better
[40:51] anybody with me
[40:53] so it's it's almost as if you're you're
[40:56] run to this thing
[40:57] because there's a crisis but people will
[41:01] tell you if you are consistently doing
[41:03] the right thing
[41:04] your immune system would be stronger so
[41:07] here it is
[41:08] many of us we go to prayer in an
[41:10] emergency
[41:12] but we're seeing a messaging coming from
[41:15] nehemiah and we're getting going to get
[41:16] deeper soon
[41:18] that he has a relationship with god
[41:20] because he's saying before thee now day
[41:22] and night
[41:23] for the children of israel we're going
[41:24] on thy servants
[41:27] and confess the sins of the children of
[41:30] israel
[41:30] which we have sinned against thee both i
[41:34] and my father's house have sinned
[41:37] now you see this here i want to
[41:40] capture this about taking responsibility
[41:43] i was speaking about over
[41:45] recently about a situation and i said
[41:47] part of the challenge with people
[41:49] is taking responsibility
[41:52] and i was sharing something i read in a
[41:54] book about total ownership
[41:56] i say at the end of the day until
[41:59] you take responsibility for where you
[42:02] are at
[42:03] it is extremely difficult for you to
[42:05] move to the next step
[42:09] nehemiah essaying is therefore is
[42:11] therefore even within his confession as
[42:14] it were
[42:14] he said for the children of israelite
[42:16] servants and confess the sins
[42:18] of the children of israel which we have
[42:20] sinned against thee both i
[42:22] and my father's house have sinned he
[42:25] said lord i accepted my part
[42:27] in this situation that we are in he's
[42:29] still praying
[42:31] we have dealt very corruptly against
[42:33] thee and have not kept
[42:35] the commandments nor the statutes
[42:38] nor the judgment which thou commanded
[42:40] thy servant moses
[42:43] but now he changed gear now he chew in
[42:45] the next gear remember
[42:47] i beseech thee the word that thou
[42:50] commanded thy servant moses
[42:52] saying if ye transgress
[42:55] i will scatter you abroad among the
[42:57] nations
[42:58] but if you turn unto me and keep my
[43:01] commandments
[43:02] and do them though they will of you cast
[43:05] out unto the uttermost part of the
[43:07] heaven yet will i gather them from
[43:10] bring them under themselves place that
[43:12] have chosen to set
[43:14] my name there now that's powerful
[43:16] powerful powerful
[43:18] this man didn't go back to jerusalem he
[43:20] is in a position
[43:22] there in iran or shushan as it were but
[43:25] the word hasn't departed from his heart
[43:27] he knows his context
[43:28] he knows his scripture he knows the word
[43:31] he knows the
[43:32] wrong responsibility now
[43:35] these are thy servants and thy people
[43:37] whom
[43:38] thou has redeemed by thy great power and
[43:41] by thy strong hand o
[43:43] lord i beseech thee left now thine air
[43:46] be attentive to the prayer of thy
[43:48] servant unto the prayer of thy servants
[43:51] who desire to fear thy name and prosper
[43:54] i pray thee thy servant this day and
[43:56] grant him mercy
[43:58] in the sight of this man for i was the
[44:01] king's
[44:02] cobra
[44:06] now this is a powerful context
[44:09] in nehemiah 1 because now we begin to
[44:13] see
[44:13] and understand some light into how god
[44:16] operates
[44:18] here it was nehemiah could have returned
[44:21] to jerusalem
[44:22] but he stayed because he held a
[44:25] very trusted position as the king's
[44:28] cabera the king's cabera
[44:32] is one of the most trusted positions
[44:35] because the king's cabera
[44:36] in those days would typically have to
[44:38] taste the drink
[44:39] before the king drinks it
[44:43] to make sure that the king would be okay
[44:46] in those days
[44:47] whoever get close to the king the closer
[44:49] you had
[44:50] relation to the king is the more trusted
[44:52] you obviously had to be
[44:53] so nehemiah was a man of such
[44:57] character that he was the king's cabera
[45:01] the fact that he was a jew serving
[45:04] as it were a king or a heathen king if
[45:08] you want to say that
[45:09] spoke more volume of nehemiah's
[45:12] character
[45:13] because the king was willing to trust
[45:15] somebody who was not one of his own
[45:19] it speaks volumes of nehemiah's
[45:21] character
[45:23] anybody with me there's also a
[45:26] connection because this is ataxis
[45:29] ataxis would be the son effectively
[45:33] of xerxes xerxes his father was
[45:36] would have been you want to marry queen
[45:38] esther
[45:41] anybody with me so for context ataxis
[45:45] would have undoubtedly known about
[45:47] esther
[45:48] the relationship of esta of his people
[45:51] he would have
[45:52] understood the trust
[45:56] that would have been expressed by his
[45:57] father in somebody like morikai
[46:00] anybody with me i wanted to understand
[46:03] the experience
[46:04] that ataxis as a young boy would now
[46:07] have heard how his father
[46:08] would have been saved his life by a jew
[46:11] named mordecai
[46:13] so it would not be a stretch for him to
[46:15] have confidence in a jew
[46:18] maybe maybe just maybe this is why
[46:20] nehemiah stayed back
[46:23] because there was such a trust and a
[46:24] relationship he would have built
[46:26] with the king as it were that although
[46:29] he had the opportunity to go back to
[46:30] jerusalem
[46:31] he stayed there abiding his time and
[46:34] note his statements
[46:35] i pray thee thy servant this day and
[46:37] grant him mercy
[46:39] in the sight of this man so there's
[46:41] something he wants to get from this man
[46:43] who is king
[46:44] anybody with me now bear in mind our
[46:46] teaching today is on
[46:47] spiritual leadership leadership is about
[46:50] making decisions
[46:51] managing resources dealing with conflict
[46:54] dealing with how to negotiate how to
[46:56] make requests and all these things
[46:58] let's go chapter two
[47:01] and it came to pass in the month of
[47:04] nisan
[47:06] and for our bible scholars this would be
[47:09] about four months after because the
[47:11] month of nisan
[47:12] is like march april so and it came to
[47:16] pass in the month nissan
[47:17] just about four months after the events
[47:20] in chapter one
[47:21] in the 20th year of ataxis the king
[47:25] that wine was before him and i took up
[47:28] the wine
[47:28] and gave it unto the king no i
[47:32] had not been before time sad
[47:35] in his presence no that is that is
[47:37] something answer
[47:38] you know what it is for somebody to say
[47:41] but i never see that man sad boy
[47:46] you know there's some people soon you
[47:48] see them and say you don't want to even
[47:50] approach them they don't want to talk to
[47:51] them their countenance
[47:52] yes no when they push them it meant that
[47:57] the typical nehemiah was a person who
[47:59] wasn't sad
[48:01] he wasn't appearing to be stressed you
[48:04] know listen
[48:05] it's it's is that yeah everybody have a
[48:06] limited how much stress you can take in
[48:08] them
[48:09] people who bring stress is like a what's
[48:12] not
[48:13] is to look for the nearest window the
[48:15] nearest door
[48:16] and see how quickly you can get out of
[48:18] there you know so the king wasn't
[48:21] used to seeing nehemiah look in a
[48:23] certain kind of way i want to
[48:24] build a context it is not that nehemiah
[48:27] wouldn't have had rough days or bad days
[48:30] but he is making a point no i had not
[48:33] been before time sad in his presence
[48:35] we don't know how long nehemiah was
[48:37] kabira but he said in my whole
[48:40] history of working for this king the
[48:42] king could never say he saw me sad in
[48:44] his presence
[48:46] not only was it an issue of being sad in
[48:49] those days
[48:49] being sad in a king's presence was an
[48:51] offense
[48:53] oh come on now now hold on before i dig
[48:56] deep on this one
[48:58] being sad in the king's presence was an
[49:01] offense you know
[49:03] so i asked you a question tonight if
[49:06] this natural king
[49:08] would make it an offense to come in his
[49:10] presence sad
[49:12] what about our king what gives us the
[49:15] right
[49:16] to enter into the kings anybody with me
[49:19] tonight
[49:19] do we have anybody in the house tonight
[49:22] what gives us the right
[49:23] to approach our king sad when we know
[49:26] what he can do for us
[49:27] anybody with me we understand what our
[49:31] king could do for us
[49:32] what gives us the right to approach the
[49:35] throne of grace
[49:36] for which we have been granted access
[49:38] we're not begging for access
[49:40] we're not requesting access the access
[49:43] has already been granted
[49:44] bear in mind after xerxes father xerxes
[49:47] would have been the king
[49:48] who had to hold out his scepter for
[49:50] esther to come into his presence
[49:52] coming into the presence of the king was
[49:54] something that was controlled
[49:56] you couldn't just walk to the king so
[49:58] they came to allow a cupbearer to come
[50:00] into his presence
[50:01] had to be somebody he could tolerate at
[50:03] any point in time so the testimony of
[50:06] nehemiah was real
[50:07] i had not been before time saturday in
[50:10] his presence
[50:12] wherefore verse 2 the king said unto me
[50:15] why
[50:16] is thy countenance sad seeing thou art
[50:19] not sick
[50:22] so the king is saying there's only one
[50:23] exception to the rule
[50:26] if you're sick i could understand but i
[50:28] know you're not sick so why are you sad
[50:32] you you you you see the context
[50:36] and the king deserves this is nothing
[50:38] else but sorrow of heart
[50:40] sorrow of heart sorrow
[50:44] of heart something in your heart
[50:47] that affecting you so much your
[50:50] countenance
[50:50] your disposition your outlook you wear
[50:53] your walk you wear your shoulder look
[50:55] everything you just say oh gosh he the
[50:58] king said this is not that he might
[51:00] know something is bothering nehemiah
[51:05] then i was very so afraid
[51:08] so so nehemiah understanding the
[51:11] consequence of being sad
[51:13] said then i was so afraid you wouldn't
[51:16] be afraid if there was no potential
[51:18] consequence
[51:19] the king calling him is out on his
[51:21] sadness and i want to say it again
[51:24] god doesn't give us excuse to be sad in
[51:27] his presence
[51:28] he said let the weak say i'm strong
[51:30] enter into his gate with time given
[51:32] david said i was glad when they said
[51:34] unto me let us go into the house of
[51:36] god i trust in this lockdown period
[51:39] that you will work on your smile
[51:43] working on how you lift your shoulder
[51:45] working out your leg so the next time
[51:46] you get it up you didn't go to the house
[51:48] of god
[51:49] god wouldn't say why are you coming to
[51:50] his presence looking sad
[51:52] but robert was preaching a service or so
[51:54] ago he said you can't come to church
[51:56] take a fight with the elder fight with
[51:57] the deacon
[51:58] fight with the usher not church not the
[52:00] house of god
[52:01] anybody with me i wish i could see some
[52:04] more faces you know thank you for the
[52:06] clearance
[52:06] but thompson but for the for the
[52:08] encouragement because i
[52:09] i feel like i have fire i look at it
[52:12] church if if
[52:13] if you could walk and put it on some
[52:14] cameras it will it will help i feel like
[52:17] somebody charged me pulpits it's not
[52:19] easy to
[52:20] preach your name there
[52:25] so so he said then i was very so afraid
[52:29] so so so nehemiah got petrified
[52:32] because he may not have even realized
[52:35] how his countenance had changed
[52:37] i want to highlight the fact that he was
[52:39] not deliberately looking sad
[52:42] but the burden he was carrying had
[52:45] become overwhelming
[52:47] the burden he was carrying had become so
[52:50] much
[52:50] that he could no longer pretend to be
[52:52] happy
[52:54] we're going a little deeper now so he
[52:56] was not
[52:58] trying to put on a show anymore he
[53:00] really had
[53:01] a need he was being affected
[53:04] so the king who is no fool
[53:09] calls it out he said then i was so
[53:11] afraid and said unto the king
[53:12] let the king live forever
[53:16] why should not my countenance be sad
[53:21] when the city the place of my father's
[53:25] focus in other words the place where my
[53:27] fathers are buried
[53:29] lie at waist and the gaze thereof are
[53:32] consumed
[53:33] with fire
[53:38] now this is where the shift takes place
[53:39] here and this begins to
[53:42] answer the question about relationship
[53:45] and about why he is still there and
[53:48] about what his role is
[53:49] and about what is happening all right he
[53:52] said
[53:53] let the king live forever and he
[53:55] explains this then
[53:57] the king said unto me for what
[54:00] dost thou make request
[54:03] now this here is one of the greatest
[54:06] leadership
[54:07] lessons in scripture because
[54:10] you can't be walking around sad and
[54:13] you're getting questioned what do you
[54:15] need
[54:15] and they say well here now i'm not sure
[54:17] you know i'm not i have a knee but i'm
[54:19] not sure
[54:19] i really you know i just so stressed out
[54:23] i don't know this was not nehemiah
[54:26] anybody with me here it is the king said
[54:30] unto me
[54:30] for what does thou make requests
[54:35] and listen to his answer so i pray to
[54:38] the god of heaven
[54:39] and i said unto the king so i ask you a
[54:43] question
[54:43] firstly what type of prayer is this
[54:49] in verse 4 we know that he has been
[54:52] praying
[54:54] for four months he is in the presence of
[54:56] the king
[54:58] and before he even starts to answer
[55:01] the bible says so i pray to the god of
[55:03] heaven
[55:04] and then i said to the king so in other
[55:06] words this is
[55:07] more than likely it's one of those
[55:09] inaudible prayers this is
[55:10] this is going any presence of the
[55:12] kingdom tell a king like this
[55:14] give me a timeout let me go and pray and
[55:16] come back that doesn't work here anybody
[55:18] with me so it meant that his
[55:20] relationship with god
[55:23] was such one that he could talk to the
[55:25] lord almost like
[55:28] i need the right words give me
[55:31] come on give me the right way to say it
[55:33] because it's not as if nehemiah didn't
[55:35] know what he wanted and we'll get into
[55:36] it because we're dealing with
[55:37] the making of a leader anybody with me
[55:41] then so i pray to the god of heaven
[55:45] so let me challenge you tonight do you
[55:48] have such a relationship in your prayer
[55:49] life
[55:50] that if you make a request in a few
[55:52] seconds you and god
[55:54] have a relationship that that that that
[55:57] built up over time that when you come to
[55:59] him
[55:59] he could recognize your voice right away
[56:02] because you have been building this
[56:03] thing over
[56:04] anybody with me so i prayed to the god
[56:07] of heaven and i said unto the king
[56:09] if it pleased the king and if thy
[56:12] servant have found favor in thy sight
[56:15] that thou were send me unto judah
[56:18] so listen listen he start to make his
[56:20] request remember the king asks
[56:22] what is the request so request number
[56:24] one based on
[56:25] relationship so now we see in the
[56:28] benefits
[56:30] of his decision to have stayed there for
[56:32] that period of time
[56:33] because he built a relationship he said
[56:35] if it pleased the king
[56:37] and if thy servant have found favor in
[56:39] thy sight
[56:40] that thou would ascend me unto judah
[56:45] unto the city of my father's sea falca
[56:47] that i may build it
[56:49] one and the king said unto me the queen
[56:52] also sitting by him
[56:54] scholars have argued over this queen
[56:56] sitting by him wondering if perhaps
[56:59] queen esther was still alive i've heard
[57:00] some say
[57:01] because she would have been still queen
[57:03] potentially if she was alive
[57:04] because this would have been her stepson
[57:07] or so
[57:08] but the queen was sitting with him for
[57:11] how long shall the journey be look at
[57:12] the question
[57:13] for how long shall thy journey be again
[57:17] leadership and when will door return
[57:22] so it pleased the king to send me and i
[57:24] set him a time
[57:25] so nehemiah was able to give him the
[57:28] time it will take to build it
[57:30] so it means that nehemiah was just
[57:33] praying
[57:33] he was praying and planning
[57:37] anybody with me you're currently king
[57:39] well king know your ass with this
[57:40] i didn't really think about it you know
[57:42] but give me two weeks and i will let you
[57:44] know
[57:44] i calculate i don't know what i need you
[57:47] see
[57:47] leadership here all right moreover
[57:51] i said unto the king so not only did he
[57:53] ask for permission to build
[57:55] and he got it not only was he able to
[57:57] answer the king's question about how
[57:59] long it will take because the king is
[58:01] saying
[58:02] for how long shall my journey be and
[58:04] when will dar return
[58:06] when will door return speaks to the
[58:09] gravity
[58:10] of the relationship between the king and
[58:12] his cabrera
[58:15] the goody king is hearing his desire
[58:18] seeing his sad countenance
[58:20] knowing what he wants to do for god and
[58:23] his people
[58:24] and the king don't want to break the
[58:26] relationship she asked him
[58:28] i will tell you no but here is not you
[58:29] need to come back along
[58:31] i don't have an excavator like you
[58:36] see the impact that you as a christian
[58:38] can have in your workplace
[58:39] oh come on somebody help me tonight you
[58:41] see the relationship you could have
[58:43] in your place of work in your job in so
[58:46] much and you could have such
[58:47] trust and confidence and such a
[58:48] testimony that this
[58:50] king would look at nehemiah and say i
[58:53] will allow you to go but when will you
[58:55] be back i'm not sure
[58:56] things will run the same way if you're
[58:57] not here it reminds us of joseph
[58:59] it reminds us of daniel it reminds us of
[59:02] characters in scripture who lived such a
[59:05] life
[59:05] that their absence was more painful
[59:08] anybody with me you remember in the case
[59:12] of
[59:12] joseph the king had to do 44 remember
[59:15] had to make no decision outside of what
[59:18] he had to eat
[59:21] remember we we answered that the hardest
[59:23] decision
[59:24] but if i had to make is no the king
[59:27] sorry the only king had to make was what
[59:29] he had to eat
[59:34] for how long should i like the journey
[59:36] and where would i return so it pleased
[59:37] the king to send me
[59:38] and i set him a time moreover i said
[59:41] unto the king if it please the king
[59:43] now this is how much request so clearly
[59:47] nehemiah had been thinking for the last
[59:49] four months
[59:50] on everything he would need to fulfill
[59:53] this burden in his heart
[59:55] so i want to create this balance in us
[59:58] between fate and action and when i trust
[1:00:01] in a workout i trust any workout he was
[1:00:04] trusting
[1:00:04] he was praying but he was running a
[1:00:06] calculator
[1:00:08] he was writing down what he needs to
[1:00:10] move from point a to point b
[1:00:12] his prayer was if the lord makes a way
[1:00:16] i know what i need to do to accomplish
[1:00:18] this thing anybody with me
[1:00:21] moreover verse 7 i said unto the king if
[1:00:23] it please the king
[1:00:25] let letters be given me
[1:00:28] to the governors beyond the river
[1:00:31] that they may con convey me over till i
[1:00:34] come unto judah in other words i want
[1:00:36] safe passage
[1:00:38] i want a letter that guarantees i can
[1:00:40] reach my destination one
[1:00:42] two that they will know i am coming
[1:00:44] under your instructions
[1:00:46] anybody with me verse eight now this is
[1:00:49] where it gets interesting
[1:00:51] and a letter under asaph the keeper of
[1:00:54] the king's forest
[1:00:57] that he may give me timber to make beams
[1:01:00] for the gates
[1:01:02] so now nehemiah is making a withdrawal
[1:01:05] from the king's treasury
[1:01:07] i want you to see the context nehemiah
[1:01:10] has a burden to
[1:01:11] go and fix things he stayed there for a
[1:01:14] reason
[1:01:15] now he's saying i need lumber
[1:01:18] i need material i need a letter because
[1:01:21] the king's forest was protected you
[1:01:23] can't just go and say i won two trees
[1:01:24] and cut it down and drive off in a horse
[1:01:26] with it
[1:01:27] so he had to get a letter so he clearly
[1:01:30] understood not only what he needed but
[1:01:33] what was required to get what he needed
[1:01:35] so you can't tell me you want to open a
[1:01:37] bank account and you don't know you need
[1:01:38] a job letter
[1:01:39] and you need your id card and you you
[1:01:41] need a utility bill
[1:01:43] you're praying in faith you want to work
[1:01:44] you're praying in faith you're paying
[1:01:45] your faith you need to still with all
[1:01:46] your faith bring your id card
[1:01:48] they need to know who you are
[1:01:53] any anybody with me he didn't say
[1:01:56] give me permission to go and get lumber
[1:01:58] no he said
[1:01:59] and a letter on the asap the keeper of
[1:02:02] the king's forest
[1:02:03] that he may give me timber you see the
[1:02:05] challenge with many of us believers
[1:02:07] we like shortcuts
[1:02:11] and we want god to do things for us and
[1:02:13] we're seeing here nehemiah
[1:02:15] understanding the context of his
[1:02:16] environment and he is praying because
[1:02:19] in the end of chapter one we saw he said
[1:02:21] lord help me to get faith in front of
[1:02:23] this man
[1:02:24] because i have to make certain requests
[1:02:26] and i need the right words to use
[1:02:27] and i'm working on what i need to have
[1:02:30] you see leadership
[1:02:31] planning context a letter unto asap the
[1:02:35] keeper of the king's forest
[1:02:36] that he may give me timber to make beams
[1:02:39] so not just timber
[1:02:40] i don't carry wood and i don't know what
[1:02:42] i needed for give me timber
[1:02:44] to make beams for the gates of the
[1:02:47] palace which i pertain to the house
[1:02:49] and for the wall of the city and for the
[1:02:51] house that i shall enter into
[1:02:54] so he's saying while i'm over there i
[1:02:56] need to live somewhere
[1:02:59] this is a cup bearer and that's what i'm
[1:03:02] saying it's a
[1:03:02] it's leadership and the creation of a
[1:03:05] leader
[1:03:06] this wasn't a architect
[1:03:09] this wasn't an engineer this is a
[1:03:11] spirit-filled spirit-led
[1:03:13] inspired man with a burden serving in
[1:03:17] his
[1:03:17] job with such a testimony that the king
[1:03:20] don't want to lose him
[1:03:21] we don't know if when they were leaving
[1:03:23] to go back to jerusalem the king begged
[1:03:25] him to stay
[1:03:28] but he stayed and maintained a testimony
[1:03:31] and he never lost his burden
[1:03:34] in lockdown don't lose your burden in
[1:03:37] your job
[1:03:37] don't lose your burden change of role
[1:03:40] position
[1:03:41] don't lose your burden
[1:03:44] when the opportunity presents itself for
[1:03:46] him to express his needs
[1:03:48] he doesn't come half-heartedly well i
[1:03:51] just need a touch i just need a blessing
[1:03:53] no he is clear he is precise he is
[1:03:55] detailed he is articulate
[1:03:57] before he even answers he prays before
[1:03:59] he starts to respond because he don't
[1:04:00] want to see the wrong thing
[1:04:02] he don't want to forget one piece of
[1:04:03] detail i don't know if he had it written
[1:04:05] on a paper in his pocket so that when
[1:04:07] the chance came to express what he
[1:04:09] needed he would have it but
[1:04:10] he was able to articulate i need timber
[1:04:15] for a number of reasons to make beams
[1:04:18] for the gates of the palace
[1:04:19] which i pertain to the house and for the
[1:04:22] wall of the city
[1:04:23] and for the house that i shall enter
[1:04:24] into and the king
[1:04:26] granted me according to the good hand
[1:04:30] of my god upon me
[1:04:33] verse 9 then i came to the governors
[1:04:36] beyond the river
[1:04:37] and gave them the king's letters
[1:04:40] the king's letters is the king's words
[1:04:42] the king's authority
[1:04:44] you can't challenge your king's letters
[1:04:45] you can't challenge a king's authority
[1:04:47] you can't challenge a king's word
[1:04:49] now the king had sent listen captains of
[1:04:52] the army and horsemen with me
[1:04:56] noticed this is not something he had
[1:04:58] asked for
[1:05:01] what relationship you have with the king
[1:05:04] that when it's time for you to go he is
[1:05:07] also sending protection
[1:05:11] you say this makes me examine my life
[1:05:15] you know
[1:05:18] are you effective in influencing people
[1:05:21] around you
[1:05:22] based on a relationship with god that
[1:05:24] they will go above and beyond
[1:05:26] because he is going to restore jerusalem
[1:05:28] and god is using
[1:05:31] a heathen king to pay for all he would
[1:05:35] pay for the protection for his silver
[1:05:38] nehemiah to go and lead the rebuilding
[1:05:39] all right
[1:05:41] now the king had sent captains of the
[1:05:42] army and horsemen with me
[1:05:44] and when sun balat the horror knight
[1:05:48] and tobiah the servant the ammo knight
[1:05:51] heard of it grieve them exceedingly
[1:05:54] that there was come a man listen to seek
[1:05:57] the well fear of the children of israel
[1:06:01] so i came to jerusalem and was there
[1:06:03] three nights or
[1:06:04] three days it's about a 1100 mile
[1:06:07] journey
[1:06:08] between shushan and jerusalem could we
[1:06:10] take some more
[1:06:12] leadership so we see
[1:06:16] his life his testimony his understanding
[1:06:19] of his needs
[1:06:20] he is now in jerusalem with the
[1:06:21] resources that based on his prayer and
[1:06:23] planning have brought him there
[1:06:27] verse 12 and i arose in the night
[1:06:30] so as a leader he is now operating
[1:06:33] because he doesn't want
[1:06:35] everybody to understand his movements
[1:06:36] and i arose in the night
[1:06:38] i and some few men with me as a leader
[1:06:41] you have to know who to trust you can't
[1:06:44] tell everybody your business you can't
[1:06:46] trust
[1:06:46] everybody and some few men with me
[1:06:50] listen neither told i any man
[1:06:53] what my god had put in my heart to do at
[1:06:55] jerusalem
[1:06:56] so even these few men who were with him
[1:06:59] didn't understand
[1:07:00] what he was doing i want us to see it
[1:07:01] we're building leadership now
[1:07:04] you can't tell everybody there's some
[1:07:06] things that is in your heart and you
[1:07:07] need to know
[1:07:08] when to keep it in your heart and when
[1:07:10] to get it out of your heart
[1:07:13] neither was there any beast with me
[1:07:14] saved the beast that i rode upon
[1:07:17] and i went on by night so i want you to
[1:07:19] picture it
[1:07:20] he gets to jerusalem he's there for
[1:07:23] three days and when nobody's watching
[1:07:25] he gets a few men get up on his horse as
[1:07:27] it were
[1:07:28] and during the night he begins to ride
[1:07:30] around looking
[1:07:31] at the ruins of jerusalem
[1:07:35] he has heard about it he hasn't seen it
[1:07:37] for himself
[1:07:39] all he has is hearsay but he wants to
[1:07:41] know for himself
[1:07:42] what he's up against you want to
[1:07:44] understand what he has to deal with
[1:07:45] anybody with me
[1:07:46] because the best plans on paper is
[1:07:49] different when they confront the reality
[1:07:50] of the situation
[1:07:54] and i went on by night by the gate of
[1:07:56] the valley
[1:07:57] even before the dragon well entered a
[1:07:59] dung port
[1:08:00] and viewed the walls of jerusalem which
[1:08:02] were broken down
[1:08:04] and the gates thereof were consumed with
[1:08:06] fire he had heard about it but now he's
[1:08:08] seeing it for himself
[1:08:09] then i went on to the gate of the
[1:08:11] fountain at the king's pool
[1:08:13] but there was no place for the beast
[1:08:15] that was under me to pass
[1:08:17] he talked about so much rubble so much
[1:08:18] decay so much everything
[1:08:20] then went i up in the night by the brook
[1:08:23] and view the wall
[1:08:24] and turn back i want you to picture
[1:08:26] picture him on a horse as it were
[1:08:28] walking around looking around trying to
[1:08:30] understand how this place get like this
[1:08:33] this is not how it's supposed to be i
[1:08:35] can't even pass here
[1:08:37] this thing is messed up look how
[1:08:38] horrible this thing is
[1:08:40] and this is jerusalem
[1:08:43] then i went up in the night by the brook
[1:08:45] and viewed a wall and turned back and
[1:08:47] entered by the gate of the valley
[1:08:49] and so returned and the rulers knew not
[1:08:52] whether i went
[1:08:53] or what i did neither had i as he had
[1:08:56] told it to the jews
[1:08:57] nor to the priests nor to the nobles nor
[1:09:00] to the rulers
[1:09:02] nor to the rest that did the work
[1:09:05] so he was just doing his research
[1:09:08] doing his analysis taking an inventory
[1:09:12] because you want to make the right moves
[1:09:13] you want to make the right step you're
[1:09:15] not doing things viki vik as we say here
[1:09:17] you're not doing things
[1:09:18] you're just doing something he wanted to
[1:09:21] be prepared
[1:09:22] he wanted to be precise we're building
[1:09:24] leaders now
[1:09:25] i want you to take lessons from all of
[1:09:27] these attributes now
[1:09:29] then said i unto them after he did his
[1:09:32] research
[1:09:32] in business recorded due diligence he
[1:09:35] did his due diligence
[1:09:38] then said i unto them you see the
[1:09:40] distress
[1:09:41] that we are in
[1:09:44] notice some scholars have
[1:09:48] brought attention to his use of weak
[1:09:52] and the significance of using we after
[1:09:54] being there for three days
[1:09:57] these jews he has speaking to have been
[1:09:59] there for
[1:10:01] at least 12 years he is there for three
[1:10:05] days
[1:10:06] and he's using you see that the stress
[1:10:08] that we are in
[1:10:10] so he identifies with the stress he
[1:10:12] didn't come and say how old i have it so
[1:10:14] only
[1:10:14] here for 12 years now you me to tell me
[1:10:17] in 12 years
[1:10:18] ola couldn't fix this
[1:10:22] you mean to tell me all i can paint this
[1:10:24] wall
[1:10:25] you mean to tell me
[1:10:30] at his approach leadership because he
[1:10:32] can do it alone
[1:10:34] and lead us understand you cannot do it
[1:10:37] alone this is not for nehemiah's honor
[1:10:40] it is not a nehemiah's glory
[1:10:42] his burden is for the things of god and
[1:10:45] he needs to win the support
[1:10:47] of those who have been there but may
[1:10:49] have lacked vision
[1:10:50] somebody help me tonight they have been
[1:10:52] there but maybe the burden
[1:10:54] maybe the frustration maybe for so long
[1:10:56] it's like that they lose sight of the
[1:10:58] glory of the temple and the glory of
[1:11:00] jerusalem
[1:11:01] then said i unto them you see the
[1:11:03] distress that we are in
[1:11:05] we are in how jerusalem lie at waste
[1:11:08] and the gears thereof are burned with
[1:11:10] fire come let
[1:11:12] us build up the wall of jerusalem
[1:11:16] that we be no more or reproached
[1:11:19] then i know after he involved them
[1:11:23] so he hasn't told them what he has come
[1:11:25] with yet
[1:11:26] he rallying support and then i told them
[1:11:30] of the hand of my god which was upon me
[1:11:34] as also the king's word that he had
[1:11:37] spoken unto me
[1:11:40] and they said let us rise up and build
[1:11:44] so they strengthen their hands for this
[1:11:47] good
[1:11:48] work anybody with me tonight
[1:11:52] let's build a little bit
[1:11:56] but when san balat the horror knight and
[1:11:59] tobiah the servant the ammonite
[1:12:02] and gershom the arabian heard it they
[1:12:05] laughed us to scorn
[1:12:08] no these are governors part of this is
[1:12:10] like part of jordan
[1:12:11] and different areas around that and
[1:12:14] despised us and said
[1:12:15] what is this thing that he do will he
[1:12:18] rebel against the king in other words
[1:12:20] are you coming to rebel against the king
[1:12:22] then answered i them and i want this
[1:12:24] identified here
[1:12:25] this here is the wisdom of nehemiah
[1:12:28] bringing the letters
[1:12:29] because these men know that if they
[1:12:32] touch
[1:12:32] nehemiah and what he's starting to do
[1:12:35] they'll be going against the king
[1:12:37] so they can only use words at this point
[1:12:40] so they're trying to discourage
[1:12:42] um what is the thing that you're here to
[1:12:44] do will he rebel against the king
[1:12:47] then answered i them and sell unto them
[1:12:49] the god of heaven
[1:12:51] he will prosper us therefore we his
[1:12:54] servants will arise and build
[1:12:55] but ye have no portion no right no
[1:12:59] memorial in jerusalem i love that
[1:13:02] he put him in their place he said you
[1:13:03] have no portion there's no peace
[1:13:05] there's nothing here you have no you
[1:13:07] have no right to anything here
[1:13:09] there's no memorial we have memorials
[1:13:11] here in jerusalem
[1:13:13] can we take a little more i'm gonna
[1:13:15] quickly touch on nehemiah
[1:13:17] because nehemiah 3 is about neiman
[1:13:20] workers
[1:13:23] i'm just going to read some of it then
[1:13:26] elias ship the high priest rose up with
[1:13:28] his brethren the priests
[1:13:30] so the priests get involved in the
[1:13:31] building and they build a sheep heat
[1:13:34] they sanctified it settle the doors of
[1:13:36] it even unto the tower of mir they
[1:13:38] sanctified it
[1:13:39] onto the tower of hane then next unto
[1:13:43] him
[1:13:43] building the men of jericho next to him
[1:13:46] bill zakir the son of imre
[1:13:48] but the fish gate the sons of hasanah
[1:13:50] built who ordered lady beams thereof
[1:13:53] and next unto them mary mart the son of
[1:13:55] origin
[1:13:56] the son of curse and next unto them
[1:13:58] muslim
[1:14:00] and it goes on name after name after
[1:14:03] name
[1:14:03] after name the wall of nehemiah tree is
[1:14:06] about the names
[1:14:07] and as i was reading this because i
[1:14:08] wouldn't read all of it in your own
[1:14:10] study
[1:14:11] i'm saying could your name be added
[1:14:14] because
[1:14:15] every every scripture has a reason and a
[1:14:18] purpose
[1:14:19] for all time eternity these names will
[1:14:22] be recorded
[1:14:23] as the men who rebuilt started the
[1:14:25] rebuilding of the wall
[1:14:28] and the bible says it's verse five and
[1:14:31] next unto them
[1:14:32] the checker the the techyoics repaired
[1:14:34] by their nobles put not there next to
[1:14:36] the work of their lord
[1:14:37] so the bible ultimately there were
[1:14:38] people among them who were who i get
[1:14:40] involved in the working
[1:14:42] you always have them what going on the
[1:14:45] people who
[1:14:46] they're getting and making me work there
[1:14:47] they're not interested in being involved
[1:14:49] in the work
[1:14:50] so my encouragement in this chapter is
[1:14:54] would your name be recorded that is the
[1:14:56] question i have about this chapter
[1:14:58] when there's an assessment on a roll
[1:15:00] call of those who are working
[1:15:03] will your name be called
[1:15:06] or will you be like one of them whose
[1:15:08] necks were not in the work meaning you
[1:15:09] had no burden
[1:15:11] you had no passion no zeal so chapter
[1:15:14] four and it's our last chapter for
[1:15:16] tonight if we could get it
[1:15:17] all true this is now the
[1:15:21] test on nehemiah's leadership is rising
[1:15:24] bear in mind
[1:15:26] his resume cup bearer
[1:15:30] by the time we reach chapter four he has
[1:15:33] successfully
[1:15:34] negotiated lumber
[1:15:38] resources for the rebuilding of the
[1:15:40] world he has successfully
[1:15:42] rallied a team together he has
[1:15:44] articulated a vision
[1:15:46] he has gotten support for division he
[1:15:48] has motivated
[1:15:50] the children of israel as it were to do
[1:15:52] work in the face
[1:15:54] of san bernardino laughing and saying
[1:15:55] what are they doing here
[1:15:58] so he is now developing and new
[1:16:01] challenges are now coming to him
[1:16:03] and let's go nehemiah 4 verse 1. but it
[1:16:06] came to pass
[1:16:08] that winston ballard hood that we
[1:16:10] builded a wall he was wrought
[1:16:12] builded past ten so work has progressed
[1:16:15] this is no longer we have an idea to
[1:16:16] build
[1:16:18] so at the beginning of the journey
[1:16:20] before the building started
[1:16:22] sunbala was throwing wood and taunting
[1:16:24] them saying what will they come for what
[1:16:25] are they trying to do
[1:16:26] and whenever you try to do something
[1:16:28] there'll be somebody will tell you what
[1:16:29] you're trying to do
[1:16:30] why are you trying to go into business
[1:16:32] why are you trying to get a promotion
[1:16:33] why are you applying for a new job
[1:16:35] why are you doing something different
[1:16:36] why are still at it
[1:16:39] words clearly failed because at this
[1:16:41] point from chapter three
[1:16:43] everybody now is part of the building so
[1:16:45] stand by let's realize
[1:16:46] this thing is happening it is no longer
[1:16:49] an idea the idea is now
[1:16:51] a reality so but it came to pass that
[1:16:53] when somebody heard
[1:16:54] that we built the world he was wrought
[1:16:56] rock means angry and took great
[1:16:58] indignation
[1:16:59] and mock the jews so he tearing up the
[1:17:01] heat
[1:17:02] that we first witnessed in chapter two
[1:17:04] and he speak before his brethren
[1:17:06] and the army of samaria and said what
[1:17:10] do these feeble jews
[1:17:16] so he's saying what these weak jews
[1:17:18] doing
[1:17:19] now if you're not grounded in your heart
[1:17:22] and you don't have confidence in what
[1:17:24] you're doing you will let words destroy
[1:17:25] you
[1:17:27] will they fortify themselves
[1:17:30] will they sacrifice so he's mocking them
[1:17:33] he's blocking them
[1:17:34] will they make an end in a day
[1:17:37] will they revive these stones out of the
[1:17:40] heaps of the rubbish which are burned
[1:17:43] he taunting them now tobiah the ammonite
[1:17:46] so this is sun balot ammonite now is a
[1:17:49] different group now
[1:17:50] was by him and he said even that which
[1:17:54] they build
[1:17:55] if a fox go up he shall even break down
[1:17:58] their stone wall
[1:18:00] look at the disrespect so tobias say
[1:18:03] them fellas so not building good that if
[1:18:06] a little animal
[1:18:07] go up and climb in this wall you all
[1:18:09] coming back down you know how
[1:18:10] discouraging that could
[1:18:12] be when you know you're working hard
[1:18:14] with limited resources
[1:18:16] and somebody just watching you work
[1:18:18] there's nothing more infuriating
[1:18:21] than you putting out effort to do
[1:18:22] something you know
[1:18:24] i i saw a situation where somebody
[1:18:26] painted a nose and somebody passes you
[1:18:27] know who's that how are you painting it
[1:18:29] but i know how to paint it right wrong
[1:18:32] that's just wrong yeah and there are
[1:18:33] people who just will
[1:18:34] pass some comment make statements nobody
[1:18:37] ever teach you to do it
[1:18:38] good luck with that yes when i pass
[1:18:40] we're going to see your master and
[1:18:41] before and after
[1:18:43] is somebody like birthday balloon i feel
[1:18:45] so deflated what the about go back
[1:18:46] inside
[1:18:49] making very effort have no value so
[1:18:52] so at this point they're trying to
[1:18:54] demotivate
[1:18:56] the motivated children of israel say
[1:18:59] if a dog walk on the wall if a
[1:19:02] look at all your
[1:19:02] that me that concrete work is so
[1:19:04] horrible and if a dog
[1:19:06] if a forks go up he shall break down
[1:19:08] their stone wall
[1:19:12] but here now nehemiah is stepping into
[1:19:14] his role
[1:19:15] now he is being challenged because
[1:19:17] leadership is not knowing
[1:19:19] all the answers because you haven't met
[1:19:21] all these situations yet
[1:19:23] it is about being able to deal with
[1:19:25] challenges as they come up
[1:19:27] so this is not there was no playbook
[1:19:29] there was no book that they might say
[1:19:31] well the last time it's happened
[1:19:32] he is dealing with it as it comes he
[1:19:34] said here
[1:19:36] oh our god for we are despised he gone
[1:19:39] to prayer
[1:19:40] there's a consistency in nehemiah's
[1:19:43] responses to situations we will see
[1:19:45] the first time he heard the bad news in
[1:19:47] chapter one he went to prayer
[1:19:49] when he was challenged to give an answer
[1:19:51] he went to prayer
[1:19:52] now he is meeting a new situation
[1:19:56] because the fact that he goes to prayer
[1:19:58] means that there is some
[1:19:59] effect on the situation so there has to
[1:20:02] be a response
[1:20:03] so he goes into prayer he said hear o
[1:20:05] our god
[1:20:06] for we are despised
[1:20:09] and turn their reproach upon their own
[1:20:12] head
[1:20:13] and give them for a prey in the land of
[1:20:15] captivity
[1:20:17] and cover not their iniquity and left
[1:20:20] not their sin be blotted out from before
[1:20:22] thee this is a real aggressive prayer
[1:20:24] this is not like we pray in chapter one
[1:20:27] this prayer is nehemiah praying
[1:20:30] a prayer of i can almost say vengeance
[1:20:33] he say
[1:20:34] hear our god for we are despised you say
[1:20:36] we are under pressure
[1:20:38] turn their reproach upon their own head
[1:20:40] in other words they curse on us
[1:20:42] reverse it on them give them for our
[1:20:44] pray in the land of captivity in other
[1:20:46] words
[1:20:47] make them vulnerable to attack cover not
[1:20:50] their iniquity in other words
[1:20:52] notice what they're doing wrong let not
[1:20:54] their sin be blotted out from before
[1:20:56] thee in other words
[1:20:57] hold their sin against them for they
[1:21:00] have provoked
[1:21:01] thee to anger before the builders so
[1:21:04] nehemiah's saying god
[1:21:05] they provoking you before the builders
[1:21:09] so and nehemiah goes on now because this
[1:21:11] is written is him is a first-person
[1:21:13] experience here
[1:21:14] so built we the wall versus six and all
[1:21:18] the walls so he prayed and then continue
[1:21:21] building
[1:21:21] everybody with me so it's an
[1:21:24] encouragement to us as leaders
[1:21:25] something goes wrong pray and keep going
[1:21:28] pray
[1:21:29] don't lose focus pray and continue all
[1:21:31] right so we built the wall
[1:21:33] and all the world was joined together
[1:21:35] onto the half thereof
[1:21:37] for the people listen had a mind to
[1:21:41] in the amplified city had a heart to
[1:21:43] work
[1:21:45] so his prayer and the resilience and the
[1:21:48] fact that he didn't get discouraged of
[1:21:49] course you hear what they say
[1:21:51] they say if a walk on the wall
[1:21:52] you all come down well let's check that
[1:21:53] one
[1:21:54] shake it shake it see if it's standing
[1:21:56] up
[1:21:58] that was not his approach he prayed and
[1:21:59] kept on working
[1:22:02] listen to verse seven clearly the prayer
[1:22:06] and the action
[1:22:08] created a focus in them but it came to
[1:22:10] pass
[1:22:11] that when san ballot and tobiah and the
[1:22:14] arabians
[1:22:15] and the ammonites and the ashdodites
[1:22:18] heard that the walls of jerusalem were
[1:22:21] made up
[1:22:22] and that the breaches began to be
[1:22:25] stopped in other words
[1:22:26] they were closing the gaps closing the
[1:22:28] openings
[1:22:29] there was no room for anybody with me
[1:22:33] so so i want to encourage you and i
[1:22:34] don't stop don't stop praying
[1:22:37] don't stop building don't stop in the
[1:22:39] wood
[1:22:40] don't stop keep focused pray and keep
[1:22:42] moving
[1:22:43] when they saw it
[1:22:48] and the breaches began to be stopped
[1:22:49] then they were very wrought and
[1:22:51] conspired
[1:22:52] all of them come together united
[1:22:54] movement united nations
[1:22:55] multiple countries here to come and to
[1:22:59] fight no it's no longer words in chapter
[1:23:03] two as it were it was why are they doing
[1:23:05] this what are they doing this
[1:23:07] at the beginning of this chapter is all
[1:23:09] you're weak all your feeble
[1:23:11] no they are so angry they are conspiring
[1:23:15] to come to fight against jerusalem and
[1:23:17] to hinder it you think the enemy will
[1:23:20] see you making progress and not put up
[1:23:22] some resistance
[1:23:25] you don't think that if you push your
[1:23:27] mind battles aside
[1:23:29] and say this virus can't come into my
[1:23:30] house and this guy affect me in this
[1:23:32] season
[1:23:33] you don't think the devil will try to
[1:23:34] come and intensify his attack
[1:23:38] but we are warriors and now we're going
[1:23:40] to the warrior part of it now
[1:23:42] because brother branham say the devil
[1:23:45] will make you
[1:23:46] test all them we're choosing them he's
[1:23:49] not gonna let you just have the virtues
[1:23:50] and not test it
[1:23:53] these believers prayed and continued
[1:23:55] working and
[1:23:56] they come together for a war now verse
[1:24:00] nine
[1:24:00] can we take some more
[1:24:03] we we we we at home right
[1:24:07] nevertheless verse nine we made our
[1:24:09] prayer unto our god
[1:24:11] and listen they just didn't pray i want
[1:24:14] to get this to us now
[1:24:16] they prayed to get strength to keep
[1:24:19] working but now in verse nine
[1:24:21] nevertheless they didn't stop praying we
[1:24:24] made our prayer unto our god and set a
[1:24:26] watch against them
[1:24:29] day and night because of them so
[1:24:32] nehemiah's saying
[1:24:33] look they're trying to attack us we set
[1:24:35] on a watch
[1:24:36] we will pray and we will watch we will
[1:24:38] watch and pray
[1:24:39] anybody with me we're not just praying
[1:24:41] and say well we hope and work out no no
[1:24:43] no let's set a watch
[1:24:45] because if they move we want to know
[1:24:46] they're moving
[1:24:52] verse 10 and judah said the strength of
[1:24:55] the bearers of the burden is decayed
[1:24:58] and there's much rubbish so that we are
[1:25:00] not able to build a wall
[1:25:02] so there's a there's a physical
[1:25:05] exhaustion that's happening here now
[1:25:08] stress level is increasing and neymar
[1:25:10] has to counter all these things
[1:25:12] right and our adversaries verse 11
[1:25:15] said they shall not know neither see
[1:25:19] till we come in the midst among them and
[1:25:21] slay them and cause
[1:25:22] the work to cease verse 12
[1:25:26] and it came to pass that when the jews
[1:25:29] which dwelt by them came they said unto
[1:25:32] us ten times from all places
[1:25:35] whence you shall return unto us they
[1:25:36] shall be upon you
[1:25:39] therefore listen to the nehemiah
[1:25:42] set i in the lower places behind the
[1:25:45] wall
[1:25:46] and on the higher places i even set the
[1:25:49] people
[1:25:50] after their families with their swords
[1:25:52] their spears and their bows
[1:25:54] so he's arming the people and i looked
[1:25:57] and rose up and said unto the nobles and
[1:26:00] to the rulers
[1:26:01] and to the rest of the people be naughty
[1:26:05] afraid of them
[1:26:06] you see how we started the session be
[1:26:08] not afraid of them
[1:26:11] remember the lord which is great and
[1:26:13] terrible
[1:26:14] and fight for your brethren your sons
[1:26:18] and your daughters your wives and your
[1:26:20] houses
[1:26:22] hear the words of a cub bearer
[1:26:26] who has turned into a general
[1:26:31] he said be not afraid
[1:26:35] of them remember the lord that's my
[1:26:38] encouragement to you tonight
[1:26:40] as leaders in your house when your
[1:26:42] children stress
[1:26:43] when your wives stress when your family
[1:26:45] stress this is your message to them
[1:26:47] be not afraid whatever the situation is
[1:26:51] remember the lord don't remember the
[1:26:55] corona count that's not what you
[1:26:57] remember the lord
[1:27:00] which is great and terrible and fight
[1:27:02] for your brethren
[1:27:04] your sons and your daughters your wives
[1:27:06] and your houses
[1:27:09] and it came to pass listen when our
[1:27:11] enemies
[1:27:12] heard that it was known unto us and god
[1:27:15] had brought their counsel to north
[1:27:19] that we returned all of us to the wall
[1:27:21] everyone under his work
[1:27:24] so when the enemy realized that yes sit
[1:27:27] down and cry
[1:27:28] yesterday and pack up shop yes sir stop
[1:27:31] building
[1:27:32] and their council meaning their plans
[1:27:34] come to nothing
[1:27:36] because you're made of defense come on
[1:27:38] now
[1:27:39] you're reality troops we come tonight
[1:27:41] the reality troops to say
[1:27:43] fear not we are more than able we come
[1:27:45] tonight to remember our lord
[1:27:47] and we come to fight for our houses
[1:27:49] fight for our families
[1:27:50] fight for our healing fight for our
[1:27:52] revival fight for our breakthrough
[1:27:54] anybody with me i'm almost done can you
[1:27:56] take a little more
[1:28:00] whoo and it came to pass
[1:28:04] everyone rewind back that doesn't mean i
[1:28:07] want to read this again
[1:28:08] i don't want to miss these things and it
[1:28:10] came to pass
[1:28:12] when our enemies heard that it was known
[1:28:14] unto us
[1:28:16] this reminds of of when the syrian army
[1:28:18] was planning and they said it like if
[1:28:20] somebody always in the planning room
[1:28:22] and the record was elisha was
[1:28:25] was was there he wasn't there but he was
[1:28:26] there so whenever they do something
[1:28:28] they know what's going on you don't
[1:28:30] think god knows what's going on
[1:28:33] so when the enemy heard that it was
[1:28:35] known to us
[1:28:36] because how they know because your
[1:28:38] prayer life is stopped it increased
[1:28:40] you're not doing more you do it you're
[1:28:41] not doing less you're doing more
[1:28:43] you're not so in fear you're showing
[1:28:45] feet you're not backing down you're
[1:28:47] fighting for your family
[1:28:49] and god had brought their counsel to
[1:28:52] naught
[1:28:52] that we return all of us to the wall we
[1:28:55] come back to defense mode
[1:28:57] we come back to building up a defense
[1:28:59] for our homes
[1:29:00] for our families for this revival for
[1:29:02] what we fought for all these years
[1:29:05] everyone on to his work and it came to
[1:29:07] pass i love this part
[1:29:09] we almost done from that time fought
[1:29:12] that half of my servants wrought in the
[1:29:15] work
[1:29:16] and the other half of them held both the
[1:29:19] spears
[1:29:19] the shields the bows and the habitants
[1:29:23] so in other words nehemiah now is
[1:29:25] dealing with
[1:29:26] the situation he said know that we back
[1:29:28] out in force
[1:29:29] we're going to do this differently half
[1:29:31] of you will be
[1:29:32] building the other half you have your
[1:29:34] sword
[1:29:36] you have your spear you have your shield
[1:29:38] you have your bow
[1:29:39] only in in war mode form a wall of
[1:29:42] protection
[1:29:43] while the rest of us work in other words
[1:29:45] everybody doing something
[1:29:47] there's no room for doing nothing you're
[1:29:50] either building
[1:29:51] or you're fighting you're building or
[1:29:53] defending
[1:29:54] anybody with me all right
[1:29:58] and the rulers are behind all the house
[1:30:00] of judah i'm almost done
[1:30:01] 17. and listen listen
[1:30:04] they which build it on the wall and they
[1:30:08] that bare burdens
[1:30:09] with those that lead everyone
[1:30:12] listen with one of his hands wrought in
[1:30:15] the work
[1:30:17] and with the other hand held a weapon
[1:30:23] brother nick
[1:30:26] so 50 percent half of the church
[1:30:30] in defense mode protection mode the
[1:30:33] other half
[1:30:34] working but then they're not just
[1:30:35] working you know in one hand they're
[1:30:38] working on the other hand they have a
[1:30:39] weapon
[1:30:40] in the security profession they talk
[1:30:42] about soft targets and hard targets
[1:30:45] a soft target is an easy threat it's an
[1:30:48] easy place you can break it easy
[1:30:49] a heart attack is when you're barricaded
[1:30:52] you know it has
[1:30:52] an easier place to go after this place
[1:30:54] looking too tough when you
[1:30:55] looked at this group of people here it
[1:30:59] is
[1:31:00] every single man have a weapon in his
[1:31:02] hand
[1:31:03] half of them have a weapon working and
[1:31:05] the other half have
[1:31:06] more than one weapon
[1:31:09] because we send in a message this work
[1:31:12] is too important it's not stopping
[1:31:16] we could be at home but we have our
[1:31:18] weapons
[1:31:19] we could be on lockdown but this revival
[1:31:22] not stop him
[1:31:23] we could be at home but you can't take
[1:31:25] my joy we could be at home
[1:31:27] but we're not going to stop praying we
[1:31:28] will still have prayer meeting on friday
[1:31:30] we will still have live stream on sunday
[1:31:32] we're not giving up we're not turning
[1:31:33] back
[1:31:34] we're not we are getting ramped up
[1:31:36] anybody with me
[1:31:43] let me just one more time again they
[1:31:45] which build it on the wall
[1:31:47] and they that bare burdens with those
[1:31:49] that laid it every one
[1:31:51] not some not most not 99
[1:31:55] everyone with his hands wrought in the
[1:31:58] work
[1:31:58] and with the other hand held a weapon
[1:32:01] everybody involved
[1:32:03] you cannot be part of this bride body
[1:32:06] and not have a work
[1:32:07] a responsibility a purpose there's no
[1:32:10] vocation this is not a vacation
[1:32:12] we are in the army of the lord we have a
[1:32:14] purpose a role a responsibility
[1:32:16] if in a building you're fighting even if
[1:32:18] you're building you're still fighting
[1:32:23] for the builders everyone had his sword
[1:32:26] girded by his side
[1:32:27] and so build it we're building with our
[1:32:30] sword at our side
[1:32:33] hallelujah no matter what i could build
[1:32:36] but if i need to fight i'll fight
[1:32:38] i got to run and find my sword i left it
[1:32:41] in the bedroom i left it in the kitchen
[1:32:42] no it's at the side
[1:32:45] at any point in time i could draw it if
[1:32:46] i need to
[1:32:48] any situation somebody feeling sick we
[1:32:50] can lay hands and pray
[1:32:52] we can't get to them we can pick up the
[1:32:53] phone and pray hallelujah
[1:32:56] whatever the situation we can deal with
[1:32:58] it
[1:32:59] when i'm in the road i'm in the car i'm
[1:33:01] in the house it doesn't matter
[1:33:03] sword always next to me you will never
[1:33:06] catch me undefended
[1:33:08] anybody with me that's that's us tonight
[1:33:10] huh
[1:33:12] and i said verse 19 i'm almost done and
[1:33:14] i said unto the nobles
[1:33:16] and to the rulers and to the rest of the
[1:33:18] people the work is great and large
[1:33:21] isn't the work we do in great and large
[1:33:23] isn't the calling that's upon us
[1:33:25] to make a bride to have a prize revival
[1:33:28] for the perfecting of the saints
[1:33:30] day without austin's main perfect isn't
[1:33:32] he worth great and large
[1:33:33] final voice to the final age
[1:33:40] the work is great and large and we are
[1:33:41] separated upon the wall
[1:33:43] one far from the other in what place
[1:33:45] thereof
[1:33:46] therefore you hear the sound of the
[1:33:48] trumpet resort
[1:33:50] you tether unto us our god shall fight
[1:33:52] first so basically
[1:33:53] nehemiah is saying is a massive work
[1:33:57] and we there's some distance between us
[1:33:59] on the wall
[1:34:01] some of us are full enough from the
[1:34:03] other and wherever you are
[1:34:05] when you hear this sunday trumpet come
[1:34:08] let us rally back together
[1:34:10] in other words just keep your ears open
[1:34:12] because we're tracking the movements of
[1:34:14] the enemy
[1:34:15] keep walking with your sword next to you
[1:34:17] but when you hear the trumpet
[1:34:18] know we into war mode and rally back and
[1:34:22] god shall fight for us
[1:34:24] verse 21 so we labored in the work
[1:34:27] friend it's a labor it's work it's work
[1:34:29] tonight is not a
[1:34:30] picnic we live in tonight you know i'm
[1:34:33] laboring you will
[1:34:35] you you are working to it's a labor
[1:34:37] prayer is a labor it's a work so we
[1:34:39] labeled in the work
[1:34:40] and half of them held the spears listen
[1:34:43] listen from the rising of the morning
[1:34:46] till the stars appeared i don't have a
[1:34:50] four hour shift
[1:34:52] is there a two hour shift can i can i
[1:34:54] get a half
[1:34:55] if i don't have working because here now
[1:34:57] i
[1:34:58] i'm not with this whole day thinking
[1:35:03] listen listen listen this is war this is
[1:35:06] soul yeah business you know
[1:35:08] i told you all some time ago earlier
[1:35:10] this year i already
[1:35:11] had in my heart desire to be in the army
[1:35:13] i always wanted to be a navy seal
[1:35:15] i didn't know the height requirement you
[1:35:17] fit this requirement but the lord
[1:35:18] happened to be another kind of seal
[1:35:21] let me talk about the kind of seal here
[1:35:23] so we labored in the work
[1:35:25] and half of them held the spears from
[1:35:27] the rising of the morning
[1:35:29] till the stars appeared listen likewise
[1:35:32] at the same time
[1:35:34] said i unto the people let everyone
[1:35:37] with his servant lodge within jerusalem
[1:35:41] so in other words bring everything you
[1:35:43] have your servants everything
[1:35:44] and that in the night there may be a god
[1:35:46] to us
[1:35:47] and labor on the day meaning we turning
[1:35:50] this thing into a
[1:35:51] 24 7 operation we're not turning down at
[1:35:54] all
[1:35:56] so listen listen listen this is the last
[1:35:58] encouragement to assume
[1:36:00] so neither i nor my brethren so nahim i
[1:36:04] say i don't know walk this road
[1:36:05] nor my servants nor the men of the god
[1:36:09] which followed me none of us cut off our
[1:36:12] clothes
[1:36:14] saving that everyone put them all for
[1:36:16] washing so you say listen
[1:36:17] we we were so alert we had to take time
[1:36:20] to go and
[1:36:21] take off clothes we'll have to change
[1:36:23] the not
[1:36:37] about the available for war trumpet
[1:36:40] sound and you there
[1:36:41] lounging in the shower
[1:36:45] 20 minutes you in the shower you there
[1:36:47] you are so you're making
[1:36:48] this is not a vacation so be
[1:36:52] ready stay ready if you stay ready you
[1:36:55] don't have to get ready
[1:36:56] anybody with me so in summary tonight as
[1:36:59] we close out this session
[1:37:01] we see the journey of a cup bearer
[1:37:04] who was so dedicated to his job as it
[1:37:07] were
[1:37:08] and it's a testimony that no matter what
[1:37:11] job you have
[1:37:12] you could be so effective in your job
[1:37:15] that you could
[1:37:16] find favor with divorce anybody with me
[1:37:20] this was a boss a king who was not
[1:37:22] christian he was not believer
[1:37:24] but nehemiah's testimony and his
[1:37:26] relationship
[1:37:27] and his honesty and his sincerity and
[1:37:30] his discernment and his wisdom as a
[1:37:32] as a cub bearer had such an impact
[1:37:35] on the king that the king was not only
[1:37:38] willing
[1:37:39] to grant his request but gave him more
[1:37:40] than he asked for
[1:37:42] how much more are working
[1:37:46] who is interested in our welfare for i
[1:37:49] know the plans i have for you he says in
[1:37:50] jeremiah
[1:37:52] plans of peace to give you an expected
[1:37:54] end not an
[1:37:55] unpredictable end not an end that you
[1:37:57] can't plan for but an expected
[1:37:59] end and here we see a man who didn't
[1:38:02] have the work experience as it were
[1:38:05] but he had a prayer life a spiritual man
[1:38:08] a man who understood the word that
[1:38:10] before he acted
[1:38:12] and he gave up examples and it would not
[1:38:14] have given every example
[1:38:16] but we see his first response i want to
[1:38:18] challenge us as church
[1:38:19] on our first response
[1:38:22] i have heard different people get feet
[1:38:24] bad feelings different sickness
[1:38:26] different
[1:38:26] and they feel too well and their first
[1:38:28] response is panic
[1:38:31] nehemiah's first response is prayer and
[1:38:34] every time did you pray did you commit
[1:38:36] to the tony lord
[1:38:36] did you did you did you commit to your
[1:38:39] lord
[1:38:42] his first response and even when he was
[1:38:44] asked the answer to the king
[1:38:47] even though he knew what he wanted he
[1:38:49] still prayed before he answered
[1:38:51] that's a lesson to us you go to the bank
[1:38:53] you go to somewhere
[1:38:54] and you you could answer but lord help
[1:38:57] me with the right words
[1:38:58] and then you begin to speak because you
[1:38:59] have a relationship you want god to help
[1:39:01] you
[1:39:02] we said it in church acknowledge him in
[1:39:04] all your ways
[1:39:06] he will direct your path that's what
[1:39:09] nehemiah was doing
[1:39:10] before he spoke he was acknowledging huh
[1:39:14] powerful he didn't want to speak without
[1:39:16] acknowledge he didn't want to speak
[1:39:17] without making sure that god was a part
[1:39:19] of that conversation
[1:39:21] and here it was he was able to
[1:39:22] articulate everything he needed
[1:39:24] do you know what you need for your next
[1:39:26] move do you know what you need to have
[1:39:28] to do the next thing
[1:39:30] in your business on your job whatever
[1:39:32] you're navigating this lock down here
[1:39:34] plan you can't do as much as you can in
[1:39:36] the road and do it
[1:39:37] plan go to paper work because god wants
[1:39:40] you to be blessed
[1:39:41] but do that sit down wait for it to come
[1:39:43] what where is your plan
[1:39:45] for god to come and bless your plan you
[1:39:47] have to have a plan for him to bless
[1:39:49] anybody with me and watch this natural
[1:39:53] hidden king
[1:39:54] not only give him everything that he
[1:39:56] needed but send security with him
[1:39:58] to give him safe passage he didn't
[1:40:00] answer it but
[1:40:01] god gave him safe passage and what did
[1:40:03] god say about you
[1:40:04] no weapon formed against you could
[1:40:06] prosper and he gave you
[1:40:08] safe passage angels and camp around you
[1:40:11] angels to protect you from every attack
[1:40:13] of the enemy
[1:40:14] including this virus this standing guard
[1:40:17] to protect your house to protect your
[1:40:18] children to protect your family
[1:40:21] anybody with me and as each challenge
[1:40:24] comes
[1:40:24] he has confidence he doesn't let words
[1:40:26] affect him
[1:40:29] there are two verbal encounters with san
[1:40:32] bala before it reached
[1:40:33] to sword and shield and the two first
[1:40:36] attacks were all verbal
[1:40:38] the power of the tongue and the attempt
[1:40:40] at words to discourage you
[1:40:42] to dissuade you to break you down to
[1:40:45] make you feel like giving up
[1:40:47] but yet still in the midst of that his
[1:40:49] first response was praying
[1:40:51] and there was prayer and more
[1:40:52] preparation and then pray and work
[1:40:55] and then sword and work and realize
[1:40:57] listen we will keep building
[1:40:59] and we will keep fighting and it closes
[1:41:02] off with him saying
[1:41:03] listen we didn't drop our guard he
[1:41:06] wasn't willing to drop a guard why
[1:41:07] this is more important than changing
[1:41:09] clothes it's more important than
[1:41:11] appearance
[1:41:13] because until the wall is up
[1:41:16] we are vulnerable this wouldn't last
[1:41:19] forever
[1:41:20] at some point in time the building of
[1:41:22] the war will be complete
[1:41:24] and we wouldn't need to do this anymore
[1:41:27] but the war will be complete
[1:41:29] and when the wall is complete the enemy
[1:41:30] cannot attack anybody with me
[1:41:32] so tonight i challenge you church close
[1:41:35] the breaches
[1:41:36] close the breaches into your home close
[1:41:39] the windows the doors
[1:41:41] of the ability of the enemy to attack
[1:41:43] your mind your heart
[1:41:46] guard your heart for out of it come the
[1:41:48] issues of life
[1:41:49] let us bow our heads for word of prayer
[1:41:52] oh gracious heavenly father we thank you
[1:41:54] tonight lord how you have
[1:41:56] placed this in scripture with so many
[1:41:59] examples too many lessons to us
[1:42:01] that in 2021 in this lockdown as it were
[1:42:05] we could get refreshed and inspired lord
[1:42:08] of how you want to develop leaders
[1:42:10] how we typed it through scripture a
[1:42:12] kingdom of priests and you
[1:42:14] challenge us in this day call us kings
[1:42:16] and priests
[1:42:17] call us leaders and leaders because
[1:42:19] kings have to lead
[1:42:20] priests have to lead we lead in our
[1:42:22] prayer life we lead in our prayer altar
[1:42:24] we lead in our jobs and our businesses
[1:42:26] we lead father
[1:42:28] because we cannot be followers because
[1:42:29] there's a god of this evil age who is
[1:42:31] leading people to hell
[1:42:33] but we want to subject ourselves as
[1:42:35] leaders under your spiritual leadership
[1:42:37] we want to subject ourselves as priests
[1:42:40] under you as our high priest
[1:42:41] we want to subject ourselves as kings
[1:42:43] under you as the king of kings
[1:42:46] and we want to mature to make the right
[1:42:48] decisions
[1:42:49] because leadership is having the
[1:42:50] confidence to make the right decisions
[1:42:52] when all hell is against us when there
[1:42:54] is pressure when there's tensions when
[1:42:57] they're stressed
[1:42:58] help us to develop our first responder
[1:43:01] ability
[1:43:02] our first response that of prayer of
[1:43:05] remembering the lord
[1:43:06] and as nehemiah challenge the people he
[1:43:10] said
[1:43:10] fear not remember the lord give us the
[1:43:13] courage to stand
[1:43:15] help us to be leaders in this world
[1:43:17] without leaders
[1:43:18] help us to be real men real women real
[1:43:21] daughters
[1:43:22] real sons give us the bonus and the
[1:43:24] courage
[1:43:25] and the confidence that comes from
[1:43:27] knowing you could take a
[1:43:28] cabera who had no experience in
[1:43:31] leadership no experience in management
[1:43:34] no experience as a general but his
[1:43:37] relationship with you
[1:43:39] and his growth and maturity under
[1:43:41] pressure
[1:43:42] develop one of the greatest leaders that
[1:43:44] the world has ever seen

[1:45:14] know how many jews were left there in
[1:45:16] shushan
[1:45:16] but he was there in the king's palace
[1:45:19] and the burden never left him
[1:45:20] help us to stand as individuals in the
[1:45:23] king's palace

[1:45:26] this lockdown
