just and we are more precious brother Peter Chandler they're going to bless you this morning know that you'll be blessed I just my comes just a few thoughts - sure just a few words on the Branham we're speaking about the token and said pastor Moses spoke and said you have got to get beneath the blood for God said blood as a token it's a token no matter how much you believe how much you're circumcised that's the covenant God gave to Abraham and so forth that's the covenant but you've got to get beneath the blood that's the token when I see the Blood I will pass that's the nomination either one you must come beneath the blood Methodist Baptist Presbyterian and the costal on denomination whatever you are it's for an individual you've got to come beneath the blood not just to talk about it may I use his words all outside of Christ will perish how do you get into Christ first Corinthians 12 by one spirit not by one handshake not by one membership but not by one denomination that's what they're trying to make it but by one spirit we are all baptized into one body and if an angel from heaven teaches anything else Paul said let him be at least that's the message come into Christ look any person outside of the token God was not responsible and God is not responsible for any person big or small popular or unpopular rich or poor bond or free male or female he is not responsible for anyone from under that token covenant he's not responsible you say lord I did this I cast out Devils I preached the gospel depart from me you not work iniquity I never knew you he only recognized a token do you hear the coalition said amen so now it's upon you he said sitting down in the woods the other day the boys was wondering here's two days I even didn't even shoot a squirrel they said what was the matter see what it was he said please sit upon them said no longer was the burden of the Prophet it was the burden of the people to begin to apply the token he's a play set upon them no it is in your lap it's in yours he won't recognize nothing but that covenant of the Holy Spirit and you cannot receive that covenant unless you are saved sanctified and then baptized into the body you only recognize the token that's the message of the hour that's the message of this day that's the message of this train in the name of Jesus receive it God is your joy God is your strength knowing the message knowing the truth that's our sufficiency he's my all sufficiency in him all things I have needed in him that's our strength my he'll come from the Lord you Christians look to him for your joy look to him for your strength look to him for your happiness he is my peace he is my joy he's my love he is my life that's the Covenant remember only safe when the token was displayed and if a man was here under here and his son was across the street he was in danger he would perish his daddy would be saved or if their son was over here and as daddy was over there his daddy would perish only the token when I see the token I will pass over you that's the only thing less horse town is gonna bring God's servant to the platform praise God through the blood through the blood we can come into his presence through the blood [Music] me into his wrath [Music] his breath [Music] just one more time just one more time I was singing [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

Bible says he is the mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for redemption a man of the Congressional to the first Testament they might receive the promise of eternal inheritance where there is a testament there must also of necessity be the death of the testator hallelujah because a testament is of force after men are dead when they die it has more power hallelujah otherwise it is of no strength while the testator lives but when the testator dies it has power hallelujah it has power hey man his voice is even louder glory to God a testament what do we call this in plain English we call it a will if that's right shout amen we call it a will hallelujah this is God's will concerning you God's will he wants you to be healed he wants you to be refilled he wants you to be perfect

[Applause] I like this next one by the naked says he says the Old Testament which is still good it's the moon the New Testament is like the Sun amen the old the blood sure the blood speaks and it

Cosway hallelujah glory to God I feel so happy to have better things amen [Applause] certainly the blood speaks amen what's the next one brother Nick here's what I want to get to you yes it points a man back to the cross but the New Testament speaks of this hour the New Testament speaks of this hour it's saying something's coming something's coming that something is you I'm gonna prove it to you the New Testament speaks of this hour Jesus Christ speaks of this hour who is it then some man this is not about a man this is the spirit of man this is the Eagle anointing it's Jesus Christ the Son of God manifesting reflecting the light of the word that he promised for this day shut him in somebody hallelujah glory to God I just give God the glory he speaks now where's the next one amen he says God only meets you today in one place and that's Jesus Christ and he is the word the waters of separation now here comes a big statement are you ready his blood was shed for seven Church ages and then and then come your shout and then by the Holy Spirit we enter into that fellowship I feel that fellowship tonight we're in a fellowship tonight Oh which is only given to the church God's only provided place of worship hallelujah we give God glory and praise that his blood has been shed let's move on brother brother Nick amen but token is the blood that that has been applied because it follows the blood it follows the blood it follows the blood every age hallelujah mapa every age he follows to see that it is brought forth hallelujah they could not be made perfect without us now can we shout now the entire Holy Spirit amen visits the church making God in human flesh in other words this is going to happen every demon is finished this is going to be made flesh there's not enough powers that can stop you what shall separate us from the love of God nothing shall separate us God is in control hey let's move on quickly brother Nick praise be to God the voice amen many people be seated for a moment many people love the same brother Branham gave us the sign but what about the voice where there's a sign there's a voice of that sign is that correct where this is the sign was great but all brother the voice has followed and watched the voice of the sign there is a voice to decide so when brother branham starts talking about the Sabre church ages I say a man broke when he starts talking about capstone and say Amen brother the section Amen that's the voice of the side there is a voice to the sign there is a voice to the blood hallelujah because the blood speak from the earth and the blood of Abel's spoke out against Cain the blood has a voice and that is the voice of the sign hallelujah amen let's move out quickly now amen he says does the blood speak can it speak come on church can I speak but token cannot speak Amen yes sir if we look in Genesis of course the blood of Abel cried against Cain the blood of Jesus speaks better things the blood of Jesus speaks how can chemically speak the red chemistry can't speak that's the life in the blood that does the speaking hallelujah the blood speaks he spoke in Ephesus it's spoke in Samana he spoke in Pergamos he spoke in

the blood speaking saying you need to apply the token hallelujah shout Amen somebody shout Amen glory to God hallelujah oh praise be to God I can't keep up amen brother Nikki's doing a great job amen the New Testament does not reveal another God it is a further revelation of the one and same God amen Christ did not come down to make himself known he spoke of the Father amen he didn't come to exalt himself and to say I'm wonderful Amen we we Jared he does not vote itself when you go on YouTube it wants to give you an ad but you press that button which says skip the ad you don't want the ad you just want the real thing and we don't want any ads we just want the word just give us the word hallelujah just skip the ad Jesus never came to say I'm something he came to say my father my father and I hallelujah let's get to this beautiful part here you know just back a bit brother Nick I just want to finish off this and now in this last age we have come back to the capstone revelation the most important revelation of the Godhead in the whole Bible Jesus is God and he and the father are one and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ amen isn't that true that is wonderful carry on brother Nicholas get this next one amen why who are we who was Jesus Jesus was the masterpiece of the Old Testament he said such the scriptures they testify of me he was the masterpiece he was the masterpiece of the
