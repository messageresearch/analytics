[12:01] prayer
[12:02] request for cl you Heavenly Father we
[12:07] thank you for your presence tonight and
[12:08] this great opportunity that we could
[12:10] take this time aside for this small
[12:13] portion to come together in prayer i'
[12:17] present kzia clock before you that you'd
[12:20] visit her and touch her from the CR of
[12:21] her head to the S of her feet the
[12:24] platelets go up and may all be well Lord
[12:27] in Jesus I ask it and as we
[12:29] approach your word may we be be with us
[12:31] in a special way in Jesus name amen amen
[12:35] it's a blessing and privilege to be here
[12:37] and thank all of you for joining this
[12:40] virtual room it's an opportunity it's an
[12:43] opportunity we may not always have this
[12:45] opportunity but it's an opportunity for
[12:47] the moment we want to take full
[12:49] advantage of it now I want to read a
[12:52] scripture from Matthew chapter 6 ver 6
[12:55] on Romans 12
[12:59] verse one Matthew 6:6 reads but thou
[13:02] when thou prayest enter into thy closet
[13:05] and when thou has shut thy door pray to
[13:09] th thy father which is in secret and thy
[13:12] father which Sees In Secret shall reward
[13:14] the openly these is Jesus words we know
[13:17] it can't fa Romans 121 I beseech you
[13:21] therefore Brethren by the mercies of God
[13:24] that you present your your bodies a
[13:28] living sacrifice holy acceptable to God
[13:33] which is your reasonable service may God
[13:35] bless his word now this morning I sent
[13:38] out uh from the pastor's desk and I I
[13:42] said these words which I want to repeat
[13:45] this tonight today as you fast and pray
[13:48] May there be a restoration a renewal a
[13:51] return to your first love as the
[13:53] scripture says nevertheless this is from
[13:56] Revelation uh 2:4 nevertheless I have
[13:59] somewhat against thee because th was
[14:01] left thy first love so it's something
[14:02] that God is seeing about our love for
[14:05] him not just love going to church all of
[14:07] the Breen all love singing specials all
[14:10] hearing the word but first love love for
[14:12] him and I said this all social media by
[14:16] Design is intended to grab your
[14:18] attention the cares of Life by Design is
[14:22] intended to weigh us down the enemy's
[14:25] trick is to distract you causing you to
[14:27] lose focus on God and the surrendered
[14:30] calling on your life this destruction
[14:34] can lead to making many idols and
[14:37] serving other gods and I I put the
[14:40] scripture from Leviticus 261 ye shall
[14:43] make no Idols no griev image neither
[14:46] rear you up a standing image neither
[14:49] shall you set up any image of stone in
[14:52] your hand in your land to bow down unto
[14:55] it for I am the Lord your God and we
[14:59] discover a word inordinate inordinate
[15:02] means unusually or
[15:05] disproportionately
[15:06] disproportionately large and excessive
[15:10] and I extract that from the scriptures
[15:12] inordinate affection excessive love for
[15:16] anything or a disproportionate
[15:19] attachment to anything can lead to
[15:22] idolatry and the scripture given is
[15:24] Colossians 3:5 mortify Therefore your
[15:28] members which are upon the Earth
[15:30] fornication uncleanness inordinate
[15:33] affection evil cusp sense and
[15:36] covetousness which is
[15:38] idolatry but Bram said anything can be
[15:40] of
[15:42] God anything can be of God to the word
[15:45] God you can make an idol of God you can
[15:48] make a piano of God you can make
[15:50] anything of God return to your first
[15:52] love okay so let's go on
[15:55] tonight for the BR don't you like
[15:57] getting alone with God
[15:59] to be alone he says I can tell him all
[16:02] my trouble is all alone and that's the
[16:05] way he wants to get you alone to
[16:10] himself your prayers as much as you um
[16:15] you for instance out in the public here
[16:17] we go when you are praying like in the
[16:19] church or around the altar get alone you
[16:22] will pray a different prayer when you
[16:25] are by yourself than what you do when
[16:28] you're in public
[16:29] slip alone all of you go out and just
[16:34] have a secret place a secret meeting
[16:37] place where you and the Lord meet
[16:40] several times and brother Isaac spoke
[16:43] about the war of the altars the war of
[16:47] sacrifices and the war of the priests
[16:50] what this time of prayer is or this
[16:52] secret place is you finding your altar
[16:55] an altar unto God let's continue so in
[16:58] the time of fellowship and communion
[17:00] that is where God spoke to me that is
[17:03] the way we want to get into the spirit
[17:06] of it you like to pray through and get
[17:08] in the spirit that's the only way you
[17:10] can do it shut yourself off from the
[17:12] rest of the world and get alone with God
[17:15] and that's the reason that you like to
[17:17] do that because when the first couple
[17:20] came on Earth Adam and Eve that's what
[17:21] they did in the cool of the evening they
[17:24] came in from their Vineyards and got
[17:26] down under the trees the great C as it
[17:29] was as the sun perhaps was setting
[17:31] streaking down through the bushes God
[17:33] came down in the cool of the evening and
[17:36] fellowed with Adam and Eve oh my that
[17:39] comes right on down knowing yet when you
[17:42] get in contact with God when men when
[17:45] you come in contact with your friend and
[17:48] God is your friend so you love to
[17:51] commune with him and talk with him you
[17:53] know there's something about getting
[17:55] alone to yourself many people never pray
[17:57] until they come to church
[17:59] many people think that's the only place
[18:01] to pray is at church but the Bible said
[18:04] for to pray everywhere lifting up holy
[18:06] hands and then when we get by ourselves
[18:09] we usually pray different than when we
[18:11] would be praying a church it is a secret
[18:14] prayer that Jesus spoke saying enter ye
[18:18] in the secret closet and close the door
[18:21] and when you have did so pray to your
[18:23] father who sees in secret and he that
[18:26] sees in secret shall reward thee openly
[18:28] so tonight I don't want to just take it
[18:30] as a scripture but I want to take it as
[18:32] an order as instructions from Jesus
[18:34] himself let's continue when we are
[18:36] praying like that there seems to be
[18:39] something to the prayer that takes all
[18:43] the hypocrisy out of it it seems like we
[18:46] get in a better connection with God to
[18:48] get alone and there have been many times
[18:51] in my life and perhaps in your life that
[18:53] you just have to get alone once in a
[18:56] while with Jesus I've took my car
[18:59] drove down the road just studying after
[19:01] I got to the highway where it was free
[19:03] and off to some Countrywood till I will
[19:06] come so fill with his mercies and
[19:08] goodness till I'll stop the car and held
[19:11] the wheel and WEP like a baby that is
[19:13] being alone many times I've climbed up
[19:15] into the mountains where every man Tau I
[19:18] was going hunting up go up there and sit
[19:21] on a rock and just look up to the sky
[19:24] until it looked like my whole innermost
[19:27] being become filled with something that
[19:30] you could just feel everything of the
[19:32] world seemed to pass away for those
[19:34] precious hours alone with God and it is
[19:37] dear that is when the greatest
[19:39] Revelation and inspiration comes it is
[19:42] when we alone with God we will take more
[19:45] time on that I'm sure and we would live
[19:48] a better life more Victorious Life of
[19:50] Christ now the title I have for tonight
[19:53] is the kind of Christian that you ought
[19:55] to be that's the title of this
[19:57] exhortation tonight
[19:59] but brand you see when you pray don't
[20:02] stand like the Hypocrites do he says the
[20:06] way to have secret prayer that is what
[20:08] he said do now listen to this now don't
[20:13] let the washing hinder don't let the
[20:16] work hinder don't let nothing hinder
[20:20] don't let nobody know what you're doing
[20:22] just go before him get up in the wood
[20:24] somewhere get out on the side of the
[20:25] road go in a secret Closet close the
[20:27] door when the kids get at school then
[20:29] getting on your knees you have heard all
[20:31] kind of voices everywhere just get down
[20:34] and stay there here we go until those
[20:36] voices are
[20:38] silenced and you begin to lift up it
[20:42] will change you it will make you
[20:45] different like it did little Samuel it
[20:48] will do something to you if you will
[20:51] just do it now now it will make you what
[20:54] you should be this is a quote it will
[20:57] make you the kind of Christian that you
[21:00] ought to be what is he talking about if
[21:03] we could say long enough to shut down
[21:04] the voices you have the voice of
[21:06] WhatsApp um uh this thing Tik Tok um
[21:10] Instagram Facebook all these social
[21:13] media phone calls talk text all these
[21:16] things all these distractions voices to
[21:18] get them silenced long enough now I want
[21:20] to ask you a
[21:21] question what good does it do to us to
[21:24] come to church and set in the meeting
[21:26] and Ponder and maybe discouraged because
[21:28] we didn't get a prayer card or maybe be
[21:31] discouraged because of some little ill
[21:34] thing a neighbor did or discouraged
[21:36] about one little matter or the other
[21:38] that keeps Christ away from you so
[21:42] discouragement depression frustration
[21:45] anxiety he cannot come in that
[21:48] environment he say it is when you are
[21:50] thinking on him that is when the
[21:53] disciples after the resurrection was
[21:55] going down the road to Emos as they were
[21:57] speaking about
[21:59] that's when he appeared to them we got
[22:01] our minds on too many things of the
[22:03] world if we could throw those things off
[22:05] our mind and think about him and his
[22:08] soon coming we'll be there'll be more
[22:11] Revelations and Power in the church but
[22:13] we keep thinking about things what am I
[22:16] going to do tomorrow what will I do next
[22:18] week will I hold my job will this be all
[22:21] those things are in the hands of God
[22:23] think on Christ and you know usually
[22:27] when we are thinking about God and
[22:29] keeping our minds on God that God come
[22:31] close to us and I think that's one of
[22:33] the great Troubles of the people of this
[22:35] day we have too many other things on our
[22:38] mind even when we come to a healing
[22:41] service we seem to think well are going
[22:43] to get a prayer card tonight or perhaps
[22:44] I'll not be prayed for we will never be
[22:47] able to accomplish much as long as we
[22:49] keep those kind of thoughts oh if we
[22:53] didn't have so much other things on our
[22:55] mind you know sometime we go to church
[22:57] and thinking about tomorrow I got to do
[22:58] this next day I've got to do this when
[23:00] we come to church we ought to lay aside
[23:02] every thought and everything of the
[23:04] world and enter into a fellowship with
[23:06] Christ and worship meditating worshiping
[23:10] in our hearts giving songs and praises
[23:13] to Him thinking of his goodness and what
[23:16] he means to us worshiping the spirit
[23:18] singing spiritual songs making Melodies
[23:21] In Your Heart even the Bible said if
[23:23] there's any Afflicted let them sing
[23:25] songs be happy be in meditation always
[23:28] here we go expecting God at any moment
[23:31] to appear to you are you doing it just
[23:34] now before this healing service talk
[23:37] about Mary as she was thinking not
[23:40] noticing who was around her little lady
[23:42] perhaps with a PE of sandals she was
[23:44] thinking all of a sudden that feeling
[23:45] got so great around her she just raised
[23:48] her hands and when she did standing was
[23:50] a light and standing by the light was
[23:52] Gabriel the Angel the Archangel of God
[23:55] hear these words now almost true if you
[23:59] want angels to appear to you keep your
[24:02] mind on God and off the things of the
[24:05] world go about your business go to your
[24:08] church go to washing of dishes wherever
[24:12] you are keep your mind on him all day
[24:17] and all night long then God will do
[24:20] something you are drawing close to him
[24:23] you have got the world shut out now you
[24:25] and he are together I was talking
[24:28] this one is beautiful I was talking to a
[24:30] noted evangelist brother TL he said I
[24:32] was thinking brother Bram of how that my
[24:35] whole objective is to save souls and
[24:38] give all my time to save Souls of
[24:40] Christ he said then I happen to think
[24:44] but what about my own love and Devotion
[24:47] to Christ you see that there so in other
[24:49] words he think about going out and
[24:51] evangelizing and so on like Souls but
[24:53] then he asked himself what about my love
[24:56] and Devotion to Christ
[24:59] Christ loves him too he loves us we put
[25:02] a lot of time and things but God want us
[25:06] to come apart and sit down and worship
[25:10] him and talk with him and talk it over I
[25:15] love that that is sweetness that's the
[25:18] greatest time of anybody's life it's
[25:21] just to sit down and meditate take
[25:23] everything off your mind if you would do
[25:26] that there wouldn't be so much of
[25:27] nervousness around the country if we
[25:30] could just think on God and then he use
[25:33] the scripture Draw N unto me I'll Draw N
[25:36] unto you now that blind
[25:40] woman Anna could be led to that spot
[25:43] with natural eyes to see the fountain
[25:45] filled with
[25:46] blood look he will be able to lead you
[25:49] tonight that's got good Sight To the
[25:52] Cross to see with your spiritual eyes
[25:55] here we go don't look for the applaud of
[25:59] the world you won't have it but be
[26:01] willing to sacrifice your
[26:03] prestige everything you are sacrifice it
[26:07] to the kingdom of God sacrifice your
[26:10] time for prayer sacrifice your life
[26:14] sacrifice your card game sacrifice all
[26:17] the things of the world give it over to
[26:19] the devil let him have it it belongs to
