[28:53] only happy to see all of you out and for
[28:56] your prayer and I remember they're not
[28:58] eating Easter greetings and says shortly
[29:01] we'll be back in the house of God and
[29:02] here we are not in the same way not in
[29:06] the same system and we have to work with
[29:08] it and what we have we have to work with
[29:12] and I just fit in a new verse inside
[29:16] here and kinda emotional but I'm
[29:21] thinking how this God that we serve no
[29:27] one who understand against this is the
[29:31] to think that all these superpowers with
[29:34] all their weapons and all the fast
[29:35] planes and all the all the all the
[29:38] technology and whatnot could crumble
[29:41] with something that can't see and Dictys
[29:45] them and so on what would happen when a
[29:48] bride get into hurting with something
[29:51] that the world can't see and they don't
[29:54] know that you have and they don't know
[29:57] it's in you and and God beaten at his
[30:01] appointed time to do something in your
[30:03] life to empower you to put that blessing
[30:08] and spirit upon you Oh glory to God
[30:11] nothing going to stop it I am so excited
[30:14] because I recognize that man is dust
[30:18] Oh glory of God man is just possible
[30:22] hallelu be mighty America brings garlic
[30:26] a nickel Ibaka Banana Republic
[30:30] hallelujah and it all condones the
[30:32] leadership and one thing I'm sure of God
[30:36] will not have that in his kingdom God
[30:40] will not have a man in position without
[30:42] character that ain't working that is not
[30:47] going to happen and God will I am
[30:49] convinced now where exact that there'll
[30:52] be no man handling of God's bride I am
[30:55] convinced that God has to have enough
[30:58] supernatural power to mess up the mind
[31:02] of man and to push him aside by the
[31:05] currents Oh Doris
[31:07] [Music]
[31:12] [Applause]

[31:20] much thing that ever tried it and even
[31:22] he did not succeed how much time hold on
[31:25] hold on but just help it back up how
[31:28] much time each jump on your heavy he
[31:30] even knocking on here but just say Amen

[31:59] let me season I'm feeling so great even
[32:03] so excited not just to be in the house
[32:05] of God but God called me since 1975 I
[32:08] don't say if I die anymore you know I am
[32:11] happy for time know what could happen
[32:13] I live in a happy man if I shall revisit
[32:15] all these it was worth it
[32:18] my god you see Daniel saw strong and it
[32:22] was not faithful
[32:23] brainless tone it wasn't some man
[32:25] constructing that stone the Bible
[32:28] specifically said it was a stone cut out
[32:30] without hands a man and when God told
[32:34] Abraham I will return unto thee
[32:39] according to the time of life and that
[32:43] promise of activate when t five years
[32:44] ago Sarah going to have a manifestation
[32:48] you gonna have a manifestation because I
[32:51] sa no man to do that this part of this
[32:55] journey has to be no man flesh and blood
[32:59] ha not
[33:01] flesh and blood have to back up back up

[33:26] the letter of the word almond but
[33:30] something turn something is turning
[33:34] something has to tell Oh Gloria I am
[33:38] convinced of it wherever God is there is
[33:41] supernatural
[33:42] listen all the men are impersonating God
[33:45] Vail and who be gone more real than real
[33:47] and who villain God and all that stories
[33:50] let's look at something I quickly but
[33:54] the Brennan said this when omnipotence
[33:57] speak the miraculous takes place not
[34:06] maybe it test takes place and he said
[34:10] the miraculous vindicates omnipotence so
[34:17] a man can claim omnipotence are nothing
[34:19] doing you have to see God I come to see
[34:24] God this morning you know

[44:25] forth and preached everywhere the Lord
[44:26] working with them and confirming the
[44:30] word with signs following our last
[44:32] scriptures from Judges chapter 16 we
[44:35] read from verse 27 now the houses house
[44:38] I was full of men and women and all the
[44:40] laws of the Philistines were there and
[44:42] they were about a roof about three
[44:44] thousand men and women that be held by
[44:46] Samson made sport and Samson call unto
[44:49] the Lord and said O Lord God remember me
[44:51] I pray thee and strengthen me I pray
[44:53] thee only this once
[44:54] o God that I may be at once avenge of
[44:57] the Philistines of my two eyes and
[44:59] Samson took a whole of the two middle
[45:01] pillars upon the house where the house
[45:03] stood and on which there was borne up a
[45:05] wooden one with unfinished right hand
[45:07] the other with his left and Samson said
[45:09] let me die before these lines and he
[45:11] bowed himself with all his might and the
[45:13] house fell upon the Lord's and upon the
[45:15] people the padorin so the dead which he
