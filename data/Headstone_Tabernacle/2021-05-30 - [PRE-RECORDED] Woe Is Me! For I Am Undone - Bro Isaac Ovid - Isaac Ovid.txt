opportunity to come to your throne of grace lord and lord despite our problems despite our failures despite our mystics lord we stand naked in your presence because lord you could see all right through us father you could see our thoughts our desires our wicked ways what's wrong what's affecting us what's influencing us what's around us and lord the stuff that we are going through and we come this morning to get mercy from your throne we come to plead for mercy from your throne this morning because you alone could give out mercy lord mercy in the midst of our failures mercy in the midst of our sins mercy lord for the things that we should do but lord we do not do mercy for the things that we keep on doing that lord we want to break away from we come this morning to get mercy to access the bounties of heaven to break past the pain and the suffering and the sickness and the mental turmoil and the sufferings of this present time even understanding that the whole creation is groaning for for the manifestation of the sons of god lord we come to your presence this morning lord looking lord for more of you father we come this morning looking lord for fresh experience a fresh encounter with calvary lord we come this morning lord not just for another service but we come this morning for you to lord take the coals lord and put it on our lips we come this morning for transformation of the inner man we come this morning lord because we are not enough on our own and we need something more and we realize that all our efforts have failed we realize that all our ambitions have failed and lord we have no choice this morning but to come to you father we have no choice this morning but to acknowledge you we have no choice this morning we have ran out of options we have exhausted our resources we have exhausted our ideas we are empty this morning our efforts have failed our our ambitions have failed our actions have failed and lord it will always fail until we come to confront the king on the throne and we realize that you are on the throne this morning you are god all by yourself and glory want to be taken into the holys of holies past the outer court pastor holy place the lord come face to face with your presence because only in your presence you could wash over us only in your presence you could transform us only in your presence you could change us we have been in the presence of our co-workers we have been in the presence of our family we have been in the presence of church members we have been in the presence of the world up we have been in the presence of our neighborhood but father this morning we want to come into your presence lord where you are king of kings come into your presence where you are lord of lords and in your presence you have supreme control of in your presence their supreme authority in your presence is supreme power and in this anointing we take every spirit up on our control for the almighty glory and power of the living god we bring sickness to his knees this morning we bring depression to its knees this morning we bring sin to its knees this morning you already conquered sin we already counted sickness you already conquered death and the grave you already conquered our past up you already made a provision for blood to be sprinkled up you already made a provision that when you look through the blood you don't see your mistakes you already made a provision there's already a provided way we are here this morning walking in that provided way we are here this morning lord reaching up lord knowing that you are reaching down and waiting to make a connection with your sons and daughters who true spiritual amnesia have forgotten who they are but we come here this morning to be reminded that we are sons and daughters of the living god we come this morning to be reminded that we are kings and priests offering holy sacrifice up just like the seraphims saying holy holy holy holy are you lord god almighty lord you are holy in this place up you are mighty in this place of lord we lift up a sacrifice of praise up it's a sacrifice up because our hands may not want to move but we lift them up anyhow and we bring a sacrifice of praise up and we offer it to you this morning father may you bless the service this morning lord may you take complete control lord you know my desire you know my burden this morning may you walk out the pages of the bible and speak to your people this morning we commit the service into your hands in the precious theme of jesus christ and the church says amen and amen amen you love the lord this morning let you sing one song before we read the scriptures take me into the holy of holies but anthony could you just sing this song [Music] to the holy place past the brazen altar lord i want to see your face take me past the crowds of people and the priests who sing their praise oh i hunger and thirst for righteousness and it's only found one place take me to the holy holy [Music] take me [Music] here i am [Music] of holies is the only ghost to tell the mighty presence of jehovah and not a prisoner of love oh help me you may rise in me a capstone of

hope take the cold so take the cold cleanse my lips here oh hallelujah take the quote cleanse my lips here i am god bless you this morning and welcome to service this morning if you have your bibles thank you by anthony thank you musicians would you tune with me to one portion of scripture reading isaiah 6 reading from verse 1 to 8 inclusive isaiah 6 and verse 1. and isaiah 6 1 in the year that king uzziah died i saw also the lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above its to the seraphims each one had six wings with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with twain he did fly and one cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that crying and the house was filled with smoke then said i was me for i am undone because i am a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphims unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongues from off the altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said lord this had touched my lips and an iniquity is taken away and i sin purge also i heard the voice of the lord saying whom shall i send and who will go for us then said i here i am send me may the lord at a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning in the presence of the lord and it's certainly a great privilege to be in the house of the lord this morning to take time away from what's not important to spend time doing what is most important because we appreciate as sons and daughters of god that we are here temporarily temporarily to prove to the devil that even though this is satan's eden that this bride will not be deceived will not be like eve and in the midst of the sin in the midst of the evil in the midst of the adultery and the fornication and spiritual wickedness in high places that god is pulling out a bride out of satan's eden god is pulling out a people for his name's sake and he is more than able to do it he has done it before and he can do it again in every age and every dispensation in every season god has always had a witness he has always had somebody who he could send forth whether reluctantly or willingly he has had somebody that he could send forth when moses was here moses was somewhat reluctant he said i can't talk i can speak but but he still went forth because he was sent for a purpose gideon had his own complexes but god will always have a witness so rather willing or unwilling whether reluctant or pushed like jonah he had a ministry and he ran away from it he was the unwilling prophet but if god has called you for something whether you are willing or unwilling whether you are prepared or unprepared whether you feel like it or don't feel like it when god puts his hand upon you there is nothing that you could do about it because he calls base on his foreknowledge and his foreknowledge allows him to see what you cannot see his foreknowledge allows him to understand what you don't yet understand because his ability is to see your future his ability to see your past your present his ability is to know what you dreamt last night that you can't even remember because he knows everything about you he is concerned about the animals he is concerned about who's in government he is concerned about where you work he is concerned upon where you live he is concerned about what you ate he is concerned what happens tomorrow and he is able to factor every single thing into his plan and he is able to make all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are he called according to his purpose and the love to god you couldn't even put it in your heart because you could never understand love because he is love it takes a while to reach the kind of love that he had when you didn't even know him he still loved you when you had not met him he still loved you before you were born and you could even come to consciousness of who you were his love left glory and sent his son to die for you when you could not even appreciate it he died for you when you could not say thank you he died for you when you couldn't write your name up he died for you when you didn't even know yourself somebody say man hallelujah so don't let the suffering of this present time weigh you down for you to stay in spiritual amnesia it's one thing to have spiritual amnesia it's another thing to stay in spiritual amnesia we were born in spiritual amnesia we were born not knowing who we were we were poor not knowing who our father is we were born not knowing that we were royalty we were born not knowing that we were sons of the king we were born not knowing that royalty was flowing through our veins we were born could not appreciate of who our heritage was and understand that david and joshua and everyone who went before wish they could have been here we were born not understanding that because we forgot where we were we forgot where we came from and the same way god had to remind job where was thou when i laid the foundation of the earth morningstar sang together we are here this morning to be reminded of where we come from reminded of where we are going reminded of what's for us that's greater than what's against us that there's a power in you that your situation cannot stop there's a power in you that your past cannot stop there's a power in you that your mistakes cannot stop there's a power in you that your children cannot stop there's a power in you that your bank account cannot stop there's a power in you then your boss cannot stop there's a power in you that hypocrisy cannot stop there's a power in you that your sin cannot stop because the sin that you have in your members was already conquered by the mighty conqueror and he said because i live not because you live but because i live up you will live also you are the result of his life you are the result of his ministry you are the result of his victory you are the result of his overcoming and because he overcame you could overcome because he is victorious you could have the victory because oh somebody help me this morning [Applause] hallelujah so don't look next to you don't look who's around you that's totally unimportant this morning don't look backward don't look forward don't look left or right i want you to look up look up because that's where your redemption coming from your redemption is not coming from the pulpit your redemption is coming from god god will move every prop around your life he will move everything you're leaning on until you could only trust him he is not compromising his trust he's not compromising his love because this is bright time and because it's bright time it means it's an understanding of his husband time also because bride and husband have to become one can the church say man everybody feeling fine so i promise you today i'll not be too long with you i have a sunday school message this morning to steal our hearts to remembrance and to make us conscious of not only the battle that we face but the gravity of the situation that we are in this morning and i believe it's a crossroads for us how many appreciate that over this morning and the services for the last few services every service a masterpiece and i shared with him what my thought was going to be this morning so i want to take a title this morning woe is me for i am undone reading from isaiah 6 verse 5 and we understand that and we have heard it and i'll just talk for a bit that it is impossible for your walk with god to be one that's really genuine until you have an experience with god you could read about god you could know about god and until you have your own individual experience with god it's just heresy it is just hearsay you are rejoicing perhaps on what somebody else went through and you hear what peter went through and what moses went through and how david had an experience and moses had an experience and joshua had an experience and brother branham had an experience and the experiences over the years since the prophet left and yes they are an encouragement to us but all of that until it becomes an experience with us and god it's just hearsay but ibrahim said he said you cannot be warmed by a painted fire so knowing what happened over the years is great information it is a great understanding and there are those who have specialized and gotten their phds in church history but church history without a personal experience with god is just that church history and our whole desire is to have an experience with god moses had an understanding that that he was one of them doubles and he made his limited attempt to bring some kind of relief and he ended up killing one man and ran away and he had basically given up on his ministry given up on his objective given up on his burden because his human effort had failed but when he had an experience with god via meeting the burning bush there was a transformation that he could not undo and you cannot undo an experience with god you cannot reset an experience with god it will change you forever so if you find yourself struggling trying to make sense of what's going on in your life you need an experience and and if you have had one experience there is room for another experience and another experience and and and there's room to be filled and there's room to be refilled and and refilled and refill them and the room filled once more again with the present and the spirit of god can the church say amen moses had an experience joshua had an experience before he could go and deal with jericho there in his alone time here's nobody around him he's meditating wondering how to take it he is trying to figure it out because it's human nature to try to figure it out every time we wake up in the day we're trying to figure out how to live how to make it how to make ends meet how to pay the bills it it's in our nature to figure stuff out how to get marriage for work how to save more money how to fix the car how to make it through the traffic how to buy food how to cook everything is about figuring it out and joshua was there trying to figure it out he didn't have an experience but all of a sudden the captain or the chief captain came by to give him an encounter with god of hosts and and joshua as any vigil and soldier will do drew his sword and challenge one time because he want to make sure that he's done being deceived he wants to make sure that nothing slipped past him so he asked the question are you for us oh are you against us are you for our purpose are you for our plan because i want you to know we're about to take over jericho if you don't know it i'm here meditating on how to take these people to the land that was promised so are you for that or are you against that because if you are against the rapture and the resurrection and you are against perfection and adoption and you are against the manifestation of the sons of god then we have means and ways to deal with it but if you are trying to make it to canaan's land and you are trying to overcome them separate yourself from the world and [Applause] you may be seated and the angel of the lord responded i'm the chief captain i'm the one with the plan i'm the one who already has the tape of what already took place so i'm coming to just rewind the tape for you so you could know how to approach it we already know what you need to do we already know how you need to approach it so you don't have to worry anymore because i've come to give you a set plan on how to overcame this situation that you are trying to figure out on your job i'm come to give you plans from the world on how to deal with the situation that you're trying to figure out in your family this mountain that's in front of you this wall that's in front of you this barrier that in front of you there's jericho in your life and the angel gave him what he needed to do an experience with god gideon had an experience with god the mighty man of allah he didn't believe it just like many people come the series this morning and no matter what we say or what we preach it is all on an intellectual level until gideon say well listen if show me something give me a sign give me an experience give me something that i could rest my feet on because you have to have some of the rest your feet on that is between you and god alone nobody else has to know this is this is you and god and your confidence something that you rest your feet on because if your faith is on the pastor and something happens to the pastor then your faith will fail if your faith is on your mother or your father then if they are not there then your faith will fail that's why people backslide because their faith was on something that could not last but if your faith is on an experience a personal experience with god whether the pastor goes whatever it takes hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord brother francis can i get a little bit more on the monitors please thank you paul had an experience that was so powerful to him he actually kept it a secret for 14 years until the corinthians dragged it out of him so personal so unbelievable that he never said anything about it it was an experience where he was caught up in heaven to the paradise of god where he heard divine secrets that was almost beyond the capability of man to utter and even when he started to express it he shared it as if he was somebody else he was talking about he said i know a man in christ who 14 years ago was caught up in the third heaven and the way he was talking about it they could have thought that he was talking about somebody else it was only after a while they realized that he was sharing an experience that he had what experience have you had the church say amen keep your mottos coming i'm not going to be too long with you but we're going somewhere this morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah if you have your bibles let's read it i said it's a little sunday school i'm going to get to my tech shortly 2nd corinthians 12. and verse 1. second corinthians 12 verse 1 it is not expedient for me doubtless to glory i will come to visions and revelations of the lord i knew a man in christ above 14 years ago whether in body i cannot tell or whether out of body i cannot tell god know it such and one caught up in the heaven something happened to paul and he is sharing it and i knew such a manner whether in the body or out of the body i cannot tell god know it how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for man to utter of such and one will i glorify yet of myself i will not glory but in my infirmities for do i would desire to glory i shall not be a fool for i will say the truth but now i forbid lest any man should think of me above that which you see at me so paul was saying i've been keeping this thing to myself because i don't want no glory i don't want you to see me bigger than i am i don't want you to have no no fourth understanding of my ministry and paul goes on and on in this scripture so you read it as your homework but pauline experienced and it took him 14 years before he was willing to share it with the people that he was ministering to and these are the experiences that shape us these experiences these encounters is what makes us having a walk with god so different that you could weather the storm of time because you're not leaning on anybody can the church amen so can we talk about isaiah a little bit this morning isaiah the prophet said is one of the greatest prophets there is in the bible in the message in his presence there are 66 books of the bible there are 66 chapters in isaiah isaiah starts off in genesis the middle of isaiah he brings in the new testament at the end of isaiah he brings in the millennium just exactly genesis the new testament and revelation perfect isaiah was one of the major prophets those are the prophets words and he is meditating in the courts of the temple in jerusalem trying to gain some perspective on what had just transpired the recent death of king uzziah dangers and threats from foreign empires when all of a sudden he is caught up in his own experience and the bible says in the year that king uzziah died i also saw the lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple what it is to see the lord friends that's why we came here this morning not to see the preacher or to see one another but to see the lord and if you ever get an encounter to see the lord suddenly your world changes it will never be the same again but to understand the context of this buildup the book of second chronicle tells us that is that uzziah was 16 years old when he took the throne and he would reign in jerusalem for 52 years under his leadership the nation rose to incredible heights of power military power financial power and as long as uzziah saw the lord the kingdom had prospered the people had flourished the kingdom was strong but king uzziah but ibrahim said he went above his estate he went above his station and and the king did something that the priest is supposed to do and he went into the temple and he offered incense and over 80 priests warned him king if you do that you'll be violating the way we operate and i want us to understand our history from the beginning of time god had ruled from the days of moses onwards and and drawed by the prophets it had never been god's plan to have a king over his people that was a manly king it was just before the dawn of the age of david that the children of israel had looked outside of themselves as is often the case looked at the kingdoms around them and said why don't we have a king like the philistines do why don't we do things the way the world is doing it why are we why are we restricting ourselves to hearing from the prophets and samuel who was the prophet at the time felt so bad about it god had to come for this prophet and say samuel they have not rejected you they have rejected me it had been god's plan to give them a king but that king was going to be king jesus that had been his plan to give them a king and his name is going to be jesus but the choice of the people they want a man they want a man they want a man to lead him and that's how we end up with king saul and then we know all the kings so by the time king uzziah is there these kings and the prophets supposed to be working hand in hand for different roles different responsibilities what the king is supposed to do is not for the priest to do what the priest and the prophet supposed to do is not for the king to do god has an order the kingdom has a order but usia went outside of the order and because he went outside of the order the bible said leprous seek him upon him brother branham brought out that isaiah used to lean on you sire rely on uzziah's counsel rely on isaiah's advice because for the most part he was a great man the prophet said he was a great man until he got too big for himself and once you get too big for yourself god has a way of stripping you down i want you to understand this is isaiah the prophet he's a prophet but gifts and callings are without repentance so there's profit as a call is profit as a gift but the gift and the call comes without repentance isaiah didn't realize what was happening in his life as a prophet this is not a church member this is not somebody in israel or judah or tribe this is a prophet a major prophet the prophet would say years later he would speak about a virgin shall conceive and be a son but this is not that time this is in the year that king uzziah died isaiah is troubled because his anchor as it were his support system as it were where he went for advice as it were where when he feeling down you want to talk to somebody that person who according to history was also family to him god had removed what he was leaning on god had removed that structure to force isaiah to be alone just like jacob had to be left alone just as moses had to be left alone just as paul had to be left alone jess and esther had to be left alone go through the bible god is a god of the individual he doesn't look at the group he doesn't even look at your family he's a god of the individual and wants an individual relationship can the church say man is this helping anybody this morning to show to what extent god is about the individual in acts 5 with ananias and sapphira even though ananias lied and died his wife was in judge because of him she was given the opportunity as an individual to represent her position to stand before the throne that was in peter's heart and she also lied and god judged her on the merits of her actions and god had wanted to deal with isaiah just as he wants to deal with every one of us he has individuals up but isaiah had been hiding behind uziah he had been leaning on uziah he had been depending on usaid if you died in core i don't know how he felt if he was troubled and god stripped it away everybody with me sunday school this morning we're not getting into too much of the deep things this morning but we are coming to your home we're coming to you in your bedroom we're coming to you when nobody else is there to you being alone with god and many times things block our vision of god sometimes we lean on our jobs we lean on the comfort of our home we we lean on on a leader we lean on somebody we know god we love god we trust god but we are not really depending upon him many times god has to remove our props allow us to become ill allow us to lose a job allow the leader to die allow chaos to happen to see how we're going to do and and isaiah did what was the best thing to do he found himself in the temple and in the temple something happened he said i saw the lord can the church say amen and the lord is was sitting on the throne hallelujah this is not any throne this is this room this is the throne above every other throne this is this is not just a throne but god was on the throne and once he is on the throne he is judged once he's on the throne he's the king of kings he is the presiding judge on the turn and isaiah stood there everybody with me this morning we make decisions and our decisions are judgments when a judge makes a decision it's called a judgment your choices your decisions with what you do when the day comes and who your friends are these are your judgments based on the information that's presented to you you make a decision this is going to be my friend and that's a judgment but as isaiah stood there in front of the lord and he saw the lord sitting on the throne and the throne was not empty god is on the throne he's in control in the presence of the lord isaiah started to feel uncomfortable isaiah started to feel naked as he decided to feel what he didn't realize all along and he screamed not woe is me in other words i'm in trouble before he saw the lord he didn't realize that he was in trouble whoa is me i am undone it was only in the presence of the lord that he realized that he was undone many people come to church and they don't realize that they are undone that word undone means unfinished unwound incomplete is like your shoelaces untied he thought everything was okay going through the routine in the absence of king uzziah but in the presence of the lord and there it was the bible said he sees the seraphims two wings over their faces in reverence two wings over their feet in humility and two wings they are flying they are in action and that's attributes of true worship and they're saying holy holy holy is the lord holy holy holy is the lord and the prophet said these angels didn't know what sin was but yet they covered their faces in reverence these angels are servants but yet they covered their feet with wings and these angels are in action many of us we have action without reference action without humility we come to church how we want to we speak to one another how we want to not realize that when we come into the house of god we are coming into the presence of god he was in the same temple not a different temple it was the same temple but then he saw something that he hadn't seen before may god uncover your eyes this morning to see what you have not seen before to see god upon his throne to see what's happening around us to see the signs of the time to see that no matter what you are going to right now there's still something that you need to do to be complete oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isaiah was alone above the thrones to the seraphims each one had six wings between he covered his face and between he covered his feet and with twain he did fly and brother branham said in the message but when he got there in the temple that day and he's seen those cherubims waving these wings back and forth and realized that these angels ministered in the face of god and them angels didn't even know what sin was and to stand in the presence of god they had to cover their holy faces hallelujah to stand in the presence of god hallelujah how did you come to the house of god this morning are your faces covered in the presence of god this morning did you come with reverence in the house of god this morning did you come knowing that he is here this morning to heal to deliver to break the chains to break the curse of sin did you come covered did you come this morning in total reverence because you realize that he is god and this is not just a church service but there is an approach to god and he is sitting on his throne this morning his throne is above the prime minister his troll is above the precedent his throne is above your doctor his truth is above your natural father his throne is above the pastor his children is above the country he is the king of kings he is the lord of lords he got all by himself and he is still sitting on the trauma he is moving things around this morning to bring deliverance to set the captives free this morning hallelujah hallelujah and one cried unto another verse three and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is filled of his glory holy holy holy is the lord of hosup the whole earth is full of his glory the whole earth is full of his glory this morning he is holy this morning your condition doesn't change the fact that he is holy in psalms 99 the lord reign it up let the people tremble he sitted between the cherubims let the earth be moved up the lord is great in zion and he is high above all the people let them praise thy great and terrible name up for it is holy the king's strength also love it judgment don't just establish equity to execute this judgment and righteousness in jacob this is the king we are talking about this morning exalt he the lord our god and worshipped his footstool for he is holy it is impossible for you to get anything from god without a revelation that he is holy hallelujah and in his holiness it makes us weak in his holiness it shows who we really are in his holiness we lay naked before god you cannot hide in his holiness you cannot deceive in his holiness you can't just play church in his holiness he is here this morning and he is on his throne hallelujah hallelujah and one cried unto another said holy holy is the lord of hosts and the whole earth is full of his glory church if the angels who don't know what sin is would spend all of their time saying holy holy holy holy is the lord holy holy holy holy is the lord and they don't know what sinners they didn't make a mistake yesterday but they'll live their lives saying holy holy holy is the lord god almighty they didn't lie last week but they stand there saying holy holy holy is the lord god almighty they didn't have an argument with their spouse this morning but they are saying holy holy holy is the lord god almighty how can you come into the presence of god and not be reverent and not be saying holy holy holy is the lord god almighty i know you're in trouble but that doesn't change the fact that holy holy holy is the lord god almighty i know you are tired but that doesn't change the fact that holy holy holy is the lord god almighty you should be walking every day holy holy holy is the lord god almighty holy holy holy is the lord god almighty there is none like him there's none like him and only earth holy holy holy is the lord god almighty holy holy holy is the lord god on my team it's reverence it's worship it's acknowledging god and that creates an atmosphere it's not trying to work the people up it's a revelation that he is holy and if angels who didn't make mistakes of sing praises unto him what about us who were created the worship and with a different gratefulness of we could say worship that the angels cannot even sing hallelujah hallelujah he is holy he is holy he is holy he is holy because he is holy that's why you dress reverently to come into the house of god because he is holy it's why you speak a certain way when you come around the tabernacle because he is holy and you realize that he sits on his throne it's why you even in your house you operate a certain way it's because he is holy because he is holy is why the prophet would say there's clothes you're not supposed to even wear in your house you figure that out but he was speaking about the consciousness of the holiness of god the consciousness about the throne of god the holiness of god his holiness has nothing to do with your condition his holiness has nothing to do with your mistakes his holiness has nothing to do with how long you're in the message or how long you're in church he is just holy he is just holy so you have no excuse this morning to not worship what is your excuse to not worship this morning what is your excuse what stress you have that you cannot say holy is the lord what problem you have that you cannot worship and give god praise this morning you have no excuse this morning you have no excuse i'm not talking about you this morning i'm talking about him because that's what isaiah saw when he's when he saw the lord and he saw the angels and he saw the seraphims he was so moved when he saw the building begin to shake the bible said the pause of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke the incense of worship the house was filled it was milky white because praise was in the tabernacle it was milky white [Applause] it may be seated it's a sunday school message the smoke and the worship and the praise didn't mean that sin was not there because the smoke and the worship and the praise uncovered uncovered the sin that was there because it was the smoke and the moving of the posts and the angels that were were flying around and the lord being present that that forced isaiah to stop looking around him the atmosphere had changed so much that isaiah stopped looking at the throne he stopped looking at the angels he had forgotten about king uzziah and all of a sudden he started to look at himself he was so overwhelmed with what he felt he was so overwhelmed with what he saw he was so overwhelmed with what he heard he was so overwhelmed that what was happening around him that he stopped looking around him and he looked at himself and when he looked at himself in that presence when he looked at himself in that anointing when he looked at himself in the presence of the king on the throne in the throne room and the seraphims and the angels around that he said war is me i didn't realize i was in trouble i thought i was okay i thought i'm in the message i thought i'm a worshiper i thought i'm a believer war is me i'm in trouble i didn't realize that i'm here in the temple he wasn't in a bar he wasn't on the street he wasn't with a prostitute he was in the temple and the temple uncovered the sin and the shame the temple uncovered the filth that was in his mouth the temple [Applause] but random said one day we have a church where sin cannot stay in the church because the king on this throne will uncover will expose will lift up what's going on in your life lift up your situation you see in that presence isaiah couldn't blame anybody people still talk about well it have hypocrites and this won't do this and this one do that and i don't know how he living and he deacon did this and the elder did that and the minister did this and this person say this but in the presence of god it was not about anybody else isaiah looked at jess himself not his child his wife his cousin his brother his neighbor nothing he said lord was me i didn't realize it i didn't think i was in this much trouble i thought i was all right i'm a spiritual man this is a prophet a major prophet who found that there was sin in his members a prophet who found it that he was in trouble and didn't realize it it was not that he didn't know the word or didn't know the law didn't know the scriptures yes was called for this purpose he was born for his purpose can the church say amen then said i worries me for i am undone he came to acknowledge his problem god didn't say this is your problem it wasn't the pastor saying this you know what your problem is here this morning you don't need a pastor to tell you what your problem is the word opens up what your problem is he said i am undone and he came to his problem he said because i am a man of unclean lips he identified what was his problem can you identify your problem in the presence of god what you need help with what you want change in your life can you identify your struggle that you know has been there but this morning the presence of god is lifting off the covers to bring you directly to confront who you are when everybody else because nobody had a reason to point at isaiah to question his life his integrity this was usaid's prophet this was an anointed man of god but in the presence of god there's a conversation taking place that nobody else is around for and my desire this morning for me as an individual is lord show me show me where i am undone this morning show me what i like this morning show me what i need this morning i didn't realize that i was just empty i didn't realize that i was this needy i didn't even know what i need but in your presence i'm a man of unclean lips i'm i'm a man struggling with whatever it is this morning oh god oh god oh god and isaiah the prophet said the prophet said he started to confess what was his problem he started to confess what was his need he started to admit what he was doing he started to confess where he had gone wrong he said i am undone because i am a man of unclean lips so he was not just saying well pray for me he was never seen remember me in prayer this was this was not that he had come to confront the reality say i am a man of on clean lips i'm not afraid to admit it i'm not afraid to confess it because i can't get help if i keep it hidden any longer but abraham spent a lot of time preaching about unconfessed sin but when you confess the devil cannot hold it on you anymore for i am undone because i'm a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips and then he places it into context from mine eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts so when people are hiding what's going on in their lives it's because they have yet to see the king the lord of hosts because once you see the king the lord of hosts it means you have stopped looking at man there are no more desires in your life and all that left to see that could help you along your journey to the rapture is to see the king because only in the presence of the king can you get the help that you need so my simple objective this morning is to point you to the king and to remind you that he is here and to remind you that he's on his throne and to remind you to check yourself because i'm trying to check myself this morning i can check you too oh let me say that one more time i'm not here this morning to tell you what you're doing wrong i'm trying to solve my problem this morning just like isaiah i'm trying to come to terms in the presence of god with what i need to do hallelujah i'm losing my i'm losing my voice a little bit because the devil doesn't like to get exposed switch on the light and all the insects and stuff go scampering we are here this morning switch on the light in your life because he is the light in the true room it's light there's smoke there's incense there's worship there's praises and friends don't be afraid of it don't be afraid of it it's like telling a child take the bitter medicine it might burn now but you're gonna get better if you don't take it you're gonna stay in trouble if you don't take it you're gonna stay in pain but if you take the treatment this morning from the master surgeon who's on the throne from the doctor on the throne this morning you'll be all right can we take a little more war is me i'm in trouble if a prophet could be in trouble don't you think preachers could get in trouble if a prophet could get in trouble don't you think ministers could get in trouble if a prophet could get in trouble don't you think elders would get in trouble if a prophet might get in trouble don't you think deacons are getting in trouble if you think a prophet could get in trouble do you think usher gets in trouble there are young people who look at their parents and they know that something is not right and instead of praying that god help them they disrespect them not knowing that their parent needs an experience just as the young person needs an experience with god the attitude changes when you get the picture that every single person in this room is not here to show but here to get an encounter with god i'm the first to say i'm undone can you admit it when the prophet spoke about they say i'm undone woe is me they stripped the self-righteous skirt to the floor feeling like nobody knows the trouble you're seeing and deep down inside you're being eaten up because you have been leaning on other stuff and god is systematically breaking all the stuff around you until you have nothing to lean on until nobody else when you look around you there's nobody there left alone i'm undone i am unfinished i am incomplete i am not okay all scriptures have to be taken in its correct context when moses was about to open up the red sea stand still and see the salvation of the lord that was appropriate then when potiphar's wife was coming to joseph you say stand still and see the salvation of the lord but did you say why quote in scripture isn't that what moses wrong scripture there's a time to say let the weak say i'm strong that has its context but it's a time to say lord who is me i'm undone i need help i'm not okay i'm here this morning because i need deliverance i'm not trying to impress anybody i'm not trying to people to think i'm i'm because i'm shouting i'm shouting that everything is all right lord who is me because i'm in your presence this morning and i cannot afford to go home the same way that i came i said it's a sunday school class this morning very simple i want to make sure i just nailed this down so you get a picture of that scenario that scene a vision of what took place not just to see it externally but to put yourself in that same place isaiah was a religious man spiritual man living in a religious nation a spiritual nation god's nation god's people there had been no switch from the jewish dispensation to the gentile dispensation to that time they were still god's people he had responsibility with the holy things of god yet until that moment he had never fully seen the holiness of god he had been operating in his ministry and had never seen the lord let me say that one more time isaiah had been operating in his ministry and had never seen the lord have you seen the lord have you had that experience with god that growls you and becomes your anchor that you could say like the old ones do but my anchor holds despite the storm because the storms will come suddenly in the presence of the lord he understood that all of our human righteousness is as filthy rags he understood that there's nothing that we can do of our own accord there's no sacrifice that we could make no good thing we could produce nothing that will ever give us the right to even stand in the presence of god he didn't even activate the presence of god god chose to show himself to isaiah like he has come to show himself to you this morning [Music] i'm not going to be too much longer may this still your heart this morning and for those who really catch it they will hold on to the horns of the altar and say lord who is me i'm undead the prophet and the messenger anointed once at the end time he is praying cleanse our heart lord is this your prayer cleanse our heart lord from all filth of the world lord i stand ready for cleansing this is the prophet i stand ready for cleansing i stand ready with this church and with all the listening in and whoever will listen to this tape i stand lord and ask for cleansing lord take me to the potter's house and break me up mold me a servant this is 1965 after the prophet and met with the angels and still he is lord i stand ready for cleansing seals broken open mysteries reveal every mystery is spoken july 25th 1965 the greatest prophet since paul walked the earth it saint claims our heart lord from all filth of this world i want you to listen to the prayer because similar yes and i said what took place with isaiah it takes god to do the cleansing you cannot cleanse yourself that's your mistake you kind of cleanse yourself you need to come and lay at your altar for god to perform the surgery and you have to surrender all the problems we come and we put things at the altar and then we pick it back up and go back home with it take the calls cleanse my lips here i am that's why i asked but actually just sing that song because this is where this song comes from this is where this song comes from take me past the outer court through the holy place into the holy of holies it's the holy ghost itself is the lord or this throne mighty in tower in the seraphim's in their place and in that place i realize that i'm empty i'm wanting i'm nothing and i pray that the angel will take the calls with the i stand lord i'm still reading a prayer from the prophet and asked for cleansing lord take me to the potter's house and break me up mold me a servant that you would want for lord jesus i'm a man of unclean lips as isaiah cried dwelling with people of unclean lips and war is me for i see the revelation now he's placing it in context for us in the message for i see the revelation of god being made manifest as isaiah saw the angels in the temple i see the end time lord and war is me and my family war is me and my people o eternal god have mercy upon us i plead for myself and the people let us not perish with those who believe not but may we live with the believers hallelujah is this your prayer this morning hallelujah hallelujah the musician get her get ready i'm not going to meet too much longer then flew one of the seraphims unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken from the tongues with the tungsten of the altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said lo this has touched my lips and then iniquity is taken away and i sin perched in other words beyond isaiah recognizing his own uncleanness and that of the people isaiah actually saw the willingness of god to forgive anyone who would turn back to him anyone who would confess to him all god was looking for from isaiah was a confession [Music] a confession of the desire to be changed a confession of what you know to be wrong a confession of your need isaiah didn't have to plead for it he didn't have to beg for it mercy came and touched him and he became aware that it was the delight of god to forgive and to cleanse in a message god's power to transform but iran said isaiah's lips he was just an ordinary man of unclean lips he said lord i'm among unclean people and i got unclean lips woe is me because i've seen the lord and an angel came down got the fire holy fire off of god's altar and transformed his lips from the lips of a wandering man to the lips of a prophet with thus saith the lord god's power hallelujah thank you jesus hallelujah hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord in the message influence pretty much said then what you can begin to play something softly when he confess his sins then come the cleansing oh you cannot be con you cannot be clean from your sin until you confess it sin till you recognize it sin then come the cleansing as soon as he said woe is me for my eyes i've seen the vindication of a great god the angels the burners the sacrifices are here and the post is moving at their voice and here they are in this vision flying back and forth he had saw something real a vision had come down he said i'm a man of unclean lips and i dwell among unclean people said he cried out for mercy and called himself a sinner then what happened one of the cherubims went over to the altar and took the tongues you could be in a play take me into the holy of holies one more time and took the toms and pick up a live coal and picked it on his hand not carried in a tongue now picked up the call put it in his hand and come and laid it upon the prophet's lips and said that iniquity what is iniquity brother branham said iniquity is something that you know it's wrong and still holding on to it we know your creed's around or your behavior is wrong and still hold on to it he said that's iniquity but when he confessed that he was wrong there was a cleansing power he took a coal of fire we see how god sets his servants in order and what he fixed him with how he kept being humble reverent and put himself in action watch when he cleans a silver he never done it by a seminary he never done it by a bunch of books we find here that god cleans his servants by fire a call of fire touched a prophet cleanse his lips god cleans his servants by holy fire not by books not by education technology but he cleans his servants by fire and this morning we are an expectation for fire fire to move through the tabernacle fire to move through your life fire to move through your heart may the coals of fire be placed this in this morning through this tabernacle upon your life to cleanse to transform to open access to you to receive the baptism of the holy ghost let's all stand our feet this morning [Music] every head about every eye closed
