[31:01] amen
[31:03] amen once again i want to thank again uh
[31:07] brother paul and nigerica for this great
[31:09] opportunity
[31:11] for this easter meeting convention
[31:14] the team of which is
[31:16] the manifestation
[31:18] of christ in you will be the vindication
[31:22] of the rapture
[31:24] what a wonderful uh team that has just
[31:27] been selected much in the hour we are
[31:29] living in
[31:31] uh i believe
[31:33] that through the scriptures that we have
[31:36] read
[31:38] we have joined all the way from genesis
[31:41] down to revelation
[31:43] in the sequence of the timing of the
[31:46] church ages
[31:48] and
[31:49] it has come to the point
[31:52] that
[31:54] we are all everything we hear everything
[31:57] we see is pointing to us about the
[32:00] coming of the lord
[32:03] and if the lord is coming
[32:05] there had to be a people he's coming for
[32:08] and if there have to be people they're
[32:11] coming for
[32:13] it has to be that the bible has made us
[32:15] to understand that everyone has to
[32:17] prepare
[32:19] i could just imagine
[32:21] sometimes
[32:23] when we want to make a trip
[32:25] we will always get ourselves a prepared
[32:27] prepare prepare and everybody is
[32:29] preparing for a time because you know
[32:31] you're going to move at this particular
[32:33] time
[32:35] but we are in a strange world today that
[32:37] the same voice
[32:39] is calling from heaven
[32:41] and speaking all around
[32:43] and getting the people to get ready get
[32:45] ready get ready
[32:48] and it seems by the way things are going
[32:51] that some people
[32:52] are not understanding the readiness and
[32:55] how serious it is
[32:57] the voice that is still
[32:59] speaking to us
[33:01] that we should be ready
[33:04] and the only identity the only guarantee
[33:06] that we have
[33:08] is that even if everybody begins to get
[33:10] ready and whatever he thinks he wants to
[33:12] be ready about
[33:14] there is only one assurance one one
[33:17] thing that's that would assure you
[33:18] assure us
[33:20] that we be a manifestation of the
[33:22] readiness
[33:24] that we are the ones
[33:27] to be
[33:28] in the rapture
[33:30] what makes you to be
[33:32] what gets you to be
[33:34] now that brings about what we call the
[33:37] common statement people always said
[33:40] they say satisfaction is guaranteed
[33:43] that brings me back again to a liberal
[33:45] explanation and understanding of what is
[33:47] guaranteed what is warranty
[33:51] amen
[33:52] so we find that warranty and guarantee
[33:57] they speak too close about the same
[34:00] thing and i would like to say what is
[34:03] a
[34:04] warranty a warranty is a
[34:08] a guarantee
[34:09] from a seller
[34:12] that a defective product
[34:14] will be repaired
[34:16] or replaced
[34:17] within a specific time that is your
[34:20] warranty
[34:23] now we are talking about products
[34:26] and we are human beings
[34:29] we cannot see ourselves as products but
[34:31] like as a
[34:32] type and then what is
[34:35] a guarantee
[34:39] according to the ashford
[34:41] dictionary
[34:43] we find that
[34:49] a guarantee
[34:53] is a more general time
[34:56] and a warranty is a more specific
[35:00] it's more specific that is written
[35:03] and it's legal
[35:05] so the warranty is
[35:09] like a guarantee
[35:12] like i said before
[35:14] of the integrity
[35:17] of a product
[35:19] and of the maker's responsibility for it
[35:25] now
[35:26] in the team
[35:28] of this meeting he said that
[35:32] the life of christ in you
[35:36] is the total assurance
[35:38] what guarantees the rapture is a
[35:41] manifestation is what proves the
[35:43] manifestation that you are in the
[35:46] rapture
[35:48] many believers today believe that they
[35:50] are believers because they go to church
[35:53] they do all kinds of things
[35:55] they can act anyhow so long as they flow
[35:57] along with the religion of what flows
[36:01] within the church that is the assurance
[36:03] they're going to make a rapture
[36:05] everybody keeps saying oh i'm in the
[36:07] bride i am in the bride i am in the
[36:09] bride
[36:11] all right it's going to be not that way
[36:14] there is an assurance
[36:17] there is a specificity of some a
[36:19] specific thing
[36:21] that we really have to confirm you
[36:24] a true believer
[36:26] that is prepared
[36:28] to be raptured
[36:30] the bible say christ in you
[36:33] the hope of glory
[36:35] and we are waiting for this glory
[36:37] manifested
[36:39] to be manifested in us
[36:41] the glory plan
[36:44] god sent forth elijah
[36:48] the prophet in this end time
[36:51] william abraham according to malachi
[36:53] chapter 4
[36:55] from verse
[36:56] 5 to 6
[36:58] of a total restoration
[37:00] the hearts of the children
[37:02] to of the fathers to the children and
[37:04] the house of the children to the fathers
[37:06] said at least i
[37:08] come and smith the whole earth with the
[37:11] curse
[37:12] what is this restoration
[37:14] the full restoration of god's word
[37:16] because we knew in jewel we realized
[37:20] that there had been the eating down of
[37:22] the bryce tree
[37:24] this vice tree had always been the same
[37:27] tree that made manifested in the garden
[37:30] of eden
[37:32] and we saw how the locals the palma won
[37:34] the the
[37:36] the caterpillar they all came to really
[37:39] wash it down but thank god
[37:41] there was still life in the roots
[37:44] and at a point in time
[37:47] god promised that he's going to restore
[37:49] again
[37:51] and the restoration
[37:53] that he's bringing back again to his
[37:54] church is the restoration of his word
[37:57] by the holy spirit
[38:00] the reason why we must
[38:02] do all we can to get the holy ghost
[38:06] according to second peter chapter one
[38:09] from verse two
[38:11] and we have to look at what the
[38:14] scripture said there
[38:16] and he said to your fate at
[38:18] virtue to virtue knowledge to knowledge
[38:21] temperance temperance patience patience
[38:23] godliness godliness broadly kindness
[38:27] and then the holy spirit comes in
[38:30] to inspect all these virtues
[38:33] which is the true statue of a perfect
[38:35] man
[38:37] with the prophet made us to understand
[38:39] whether i'm able to feed my family or
[38:41] not let these vicious live in me
[38:44] and at the selling of this by the holy
[38:47] spirit because the holy spirit still
[38:49] leads the way from the beginning
[38:51] from the time of being converted
[38:54] and the holy spirit leads the way
[38:56] to begin to bring this additions adding
[38:59] of these virtues right into our lives
[39:02] so the quality of a believer
[39:05] that we really make the rapture
[39:08] that will bring the manifestation of the
[39:10] rapture is the one
[39:11] that has this life of christ in him
[39:14] these victims of christ in his life
[39:17] and that is the one the holy spirit is
[39:19] going to seal you become a finished work
[39:23] that would be the manifestation
[39:26] not one that we go we are in church
[39:29] you are in the bottom line
[39:31] we don't know where you are going to
[39:33] you know where you are going to
[39:35] we must be very specific in this hour to
[39:38] know that there is only one satisfaction
[39:41] that has been guaranteed for us
[39:44] christ
[39:45] that life of christ
[39:47] is the satisfaction guaranteed
[39:50] and that is the specific thing we need
[39:53] the entire world has been restored in
[39:55] this hour
[39:56] god sent forth his prophet
[39:59] and
[40:00] let it be your thai post today
[40:03] many people are in church are now living
[40:05] the life
[40:06] many people are in church and they don't
[40:08] want to do what the world says do
[40:11] many people are in church and they are
[40:13] worshipping other gods some are
[40:14] worshipping money some are worshiping
[40:16] all kinds of things somebody doing
[40:18] anything and whenever you bring up any
[40:20] issue they will have to question it
[40:23] it's not the time to make any question
[40:26] but it's the time
[40:28] that the manifestation of these virtues
[40:30] because you are not going to force it
[40:32] into your life
[40:34] it will be a thing that will operate in
[40:36] a very simple way because it has to be
[40:38] god in simplicity again
[40:40] so my brothers my sisters
[40:43] before i round up
[40:45] and as i wish as the ministers will be
[40:47] coming to minister the word of god
[40:51] i want to
[40:53] really address your mind back again
[40:56] to understand
[40:58] that there is only one thing that is
[41:00] guaranteed in your life
[41:02] and that is the life of jesus christ the
[41:04] start of a perfect man
[41:07] and so long as that has to be in you
[41:10] everything will be all right
[41:13] but if you
[41:15] do not have this
[41:17] you are not going to get it from your
[41:19] backyard or from the market or from the
[41:21] supermarket or buy with your money
[41:24] you only need to surrender your life
[41:27] to christ
[41:29] you need to repent
[41:30] repent of your sins
[41:33] call him into your life
[41:35] tell him to change your life
[41:37] let him change your life
[41:39] to what he wants to be done total
[41:42] surrendered life to him and let him feel
[41:44] you all completely
[41:46] and by so doing
[41:48] his life will completely enrich your
[41:51] life
[41:52] and when that is done
[41:54] the holy spirit god himself will be
[41:57] satisfied
[41:58] that when he come
[42:00] as a trumpet sounds
[42:02] that same voice the holy spirit will
[42:04] identify that's some word you have put
[42:07] in your life and from there up into the
[42:10] rapture
[42:11] may god richly bless you

[48:02] you you are welcome to his presence amen
[48:07] um i will humbly request that will rise
[48:10] up for the reading of the scriptures
[48:12] this morning
[48:19] if you have your bibles with you
[48:21] i want us to thank to the book of exodus
[48:25] chapter 19.
[48:29] exodus chapter 19.
[48:40] i was wondering now if i should read the
[48:43] old chapter
[48:45] but if i didn't do i hurt everyone to
[48:49] read the whole chapter
[48:52] but i will get my thoughts very clear
[48:55] from the scriptures
[48:57] exodus 19
[49:00] i'll read from verse one
[49:02] in the third month when the children of
[49:05] israel were gone fought
[49:07] out of the land of egypt
[49:09] the same day came day into the
[49:11] wilderness of sinai or sinai
[49:15] for they were departed from rephidim and
[49:18] we had come to the desert of sinai
[49:21] and that pitched in the wilderness
[49:24] and there israel camped before the mount
[49:28] and moses went up unto god
[49:30] and the lord called unto him out of the
[49:33] mountain saying
[49:34] thus shall say to the house of jacob
[49:38] and tell the children of israel
[49:41] ye have seen what i did unto the
[49:43] egyptians
[49:45] and how i bear you on egos wings
[49:48] and brought you unto myself
[49:51] now therefore
[49:52] if ye will obey my voice indeed
[49:56] and keep my covenant then you shall be a
[49:59] peculiar treasure unto me above all
[50:03] people
[50:04] for all the earth is mine
[50:08] and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of
[50:11] priest
[50:12] an unholy nation
[50:14] these are the words which thou shalt
[50:17] speak unto the children of israel
[50:20] i think this has a new testament also
[50:22] similarity
[50:24] when opposed to peter said that we're
[50:27] peculiar people a royal priesthood a
[50:30] holy nation
[50:32] separated unto god amen so we now know
[50:35] the secret
[50:37] of how to meet this qualifications the
[50:40] secret is very simple he said if you
[50:44] will obey my voice indeed
[50:47] amen let's not pay lip service to the
[50:49] world
[50:50] let's obey indeed then we shall be a
[50:53] peculiar treasure
[50:56] a treasure with distinction
[50:59] amen a unique treasure unto the lord
[51:03] oh wonderful
[51:05] verse 7 a moses came and called
[51:08] for the elders of the people
[51:11] and laid before their faces all these
[51:13] words which the lord commanded him
[51:17] and all the people answered together and
[51:19] said
[51:20] all that the lord had spoken we will do
[51:24] and moses returned the words of the
[51:26] people unto the lord
[51:28] and the lord said unto moses
[51:31] lo watch this verse
[51:33] lo i come unto thee in a thick cloud
[51:38] that the people
[51:39] may hear when i speak with thee
[51:43] and believe thee forever
[51:49] god said he will come down in the cloud
[51:52] thick one
[51:54] for the purpose of doing one thing
[51:57] for the purpose
[51:58] of
[52:02] vindicating
[52:04] his servants
[52:06] for the purpose of establishing
[52:10] the words of his servants
[52:12] he said let me read that again
[52:15] he said and the lord said unto moses lo
[52:18] i come unto thee in a thick cloud
[52:23] that the people may hear when i speak
[52:26] with thee
[52:27] and believe thee forever
[52:30] and moses told the words of the people
[52:33] unto the lord we must finish this
[52:35] passage
[52:36] and the lord said unto moses
[52:38] go unto the people and sanctify them
[52:41] today and tomorrow
[52:43] and let them wash their clothes and be
[52:46] ready against the third day
[52:48] for the third day the lord will come
[52:50] down in the sight of all the people upon
[52:54] mount sinai
[52:56] and thou shall set bounds onto the
[52:59] people round about
[53:01] saying take it to yourselves
[53:04] that ye go not up
[53:06] into the mount or touch the border of it
[53:09] whosoever touches the mount shall be
[53:13] surely put to death there shall not an
[53:16] end touch it but it shall surely be
[53:19] stoned or short through whether it be
[53:22] beast or man it shall not leave
[53:26] when the trumpet sounded long they shall
[53:29] come up to the mount and moses went down
[53:32] from the mount
[53:33] unto the people and sanctified the
[53:36] people
[53:37] and they washed their clothes and he
[53:39] said unto the people
[53:41] be ready against the third day
[53:44] come not at your wives and it came to
[53:47] pass on the third day in the morning
[53:50] that there were thunders and lightnings
[53:53] and a thick cloud
[53:55] amen
[53:56] upon the mount
[53:58] and the voice of the trumpet exceedingly
[54:01] loud so that all the people that was in
[54:05] the camp trembled
[54:07] and moses brought forth the people
[54:10] out of the camp to meet with the
[54:14] god
[54:15] and they stood at the nether part of the
[54:18] mount and mancini was all together on a
[54:22] smoke because the lord descended upon it
[54:26] in fire
[54:27] and the smoke thereof accented
[54:31] as the smoke of the furnace
[54:34] and the whole mount quick greatly
[54:37] and when the voice of the trumpet
[54:39] sounded long and works louder and louder
[54:42] moses spake and god answered him by his
[54:45] voice and the lord came down upon mount
[54:48] sinai on the top of the mount and the
[54:51] lord called moses up to the top of the
[54:54] mount and moses went up and the lord
[54:58] said unto moses go down charge the
[55:01] people lest they break through
[55:04] unto the lord to gaze and many of them
[55:07] that and many of them perish and let the
[55:10] priests also which come near to the lord
[55:13] sanctify themselves lest the lord break
[55:16] forth upon them and moses said unto the
[55:19] lord the people cannot come up to mount
[55:22] sinai for thou church or saying set
[55:26] bounds about the mount and sanctify it
[55:29] and the lord said unto him a way get
[55:32] thee down and thou shall come up thou
[55:35] and aaron with thee but let not the
[55:37] priest and the people break through to
[55:41] come up unto the lord lest he break
[55:44] forth upon them amen
[55:47] verse 21 verse 20 chapter 20 verse 1
[55:49] says
[55:50] until and god spake all these words
[55:53] saying i am the lord a god which have
[55:56] brought thee out of the land of egypt
[55:59] out of the house of bondage thou shall
[56:02] have no other gods before me
[56:05] and on and on he gave all the entire
[56:10] commandments amen
[56:12] and when he has
[56:14] fully given the entire commandments
[56:17] it went into the ordinances and statutes
[56:21] and all
[56:22] the instructions and principles and
[56:25] everything
[56:26] right when it came down in the cloud and
[56:29] still on the mount so the fellowship
[56:32] stretched up to chapter 22
[56:35] chapter 23 somewhere there before it was
[56:38] over may the lord add his blessings to
[56:42] the reading of his holy word god bless
[56:44] you you may be seated
[56:55] this moment if the lord will be our help
[56:59] which i trust he always has and he
[57:02] always will
[57:05] i want to speak on
[57:07] the subject that i called
[57:10] the easter cloud
[57:12] of our redemption
[57:15] the easter cloud
[57:17] of our redemption
[57:20] amen
[57:23] from the chapter where we reach
[57:26] we saw israel
[57:30] been brought out and they have actually
[57:33] come out
[57:37] and in their coming out
[57:40] god took them through the wilderness
[57:43] but the wilderness
[57:46] was not meant
[57:48] to be the end of their journey
[57:51] the wilderness is a place of
[57:54] sanctification
[57:56] a place of purging
[57:58] in order to really sift out
[58:01] the people for whom the exodus
[58:04] was actually meant
[58:08] because the bible told us
[58:10] that when the journey began
[58:14] because many people saw it as a great
[58:17] new revival
[58:19] just as a song that we do sing says
[58:22] i'm going through i'm going through
[58:25] lord i have started to walk in the light
[58:28] shining upon me from heaven so bright i
[58:30] begged the world and it follows at you
[58:32] i've started with jesus and i'm going
[58:35] through in another verse he said so many
[58:38] started to run in the race
[58:41] many believed it because it is new
[58:44] but not very many expect to go through
[58:49] and the only reason for this is because
[58:52] every revival
[58:54] always attracts all kinds of seeds
[58:59] every revival attracts all kinds of
[59:02] people it will attract the genuine ones
[59:06] who will be able to go through
[59:08] completely
[59:10] it will attract those
[59:12] number who will only stay within the
[59:14] range of the message
[59:17] they can go past the range of the
[59:18] message of the hour
[59:20] it will also attract those people
[59:24] who will come in just to take offense
[59:27] at the message
[59:29] all these things i'm saying the message
[59:32] had already for warned us about each
[59:34] and that is why in the message unveiling
[59:37] of god
[59:38] the prophet said
[59:40] sometimes we need to speak
[59:43] or do things
[59:45] in a certain way
[59:46] and the prophet said it is done
[59:49] intentionally
[59:51] it is done deliberately in order to do
[59:54] what thin down the crowd
[59:57] but you see everybody will hear the same
[59:59] thing
[1:00:00] just like abel and kane heard the same
[1:00:03] thing
[1:00:03] but came with different response
[1:00:07] to the same gospel that they had
[1:00:09] because one will be hearing by
[1:00:11] revelation the other will be hearing
[1:00:14] carnally
[1:00:15] everybody will hear the same thing but
[1:00:18] the prophet said there is going to be
[1:00:21] different type of reactions to the same
[1:00:24] thing that will be heard
[1:00:26] god is not going to
[1:00:28] call some people somewhere else or put
[1:00:31] some people another place to talk to
[1:00:34] them if we talk to them the same thing
[1:00:37] the same way the same time
[1:00:40] but each will pick their understanding
[1:00:43] of the same thing by the type of seed
[1:00:46] that they have
[1:00:49] this is why the prophet said this one
[1:00:51] thing they will hear will make some
[1:00:54] people to ponder we make some people to
[1:00:57] get annoyed and work out
[1:00:59] when they walk out they stay in the
[1:01:01] compound weather
[1:01:03] wondering whether to live permanently or
[1:01:06] to come back inside but the same thing
[1:01:09] and it will make some people to just
[1:01:11] walk out to the gate and go forever
[1:01:14] never to come again
[1:01:15] and it will make some people never to
[1:01:18] leave their seats
[1:01:19] but to sit there and to ponder and say
[1:01:22] lord have mercy upon me
[1:01:25] and the prophet said that thing is said
[1:01:27] intentionally
[1:01:29] in order to achieve that
[1:01:31] why because every revival
[1:01:34] is also attractive
[1:01:36] not only to the genuine ones but to the
[1:01:39] mixed multitudes
[1:01:42] and this exodus here
[1:01:44] and its revival was no different
[1:01:47] in the scripture the bible told us
[1:01:50] that when moses came with many mighty
[1:01:52] signs and wonders
[1:01:54] which there were signs miracles and
[1:01:56] wonders to the real exodus people but a
[1:02:00] judgment to the egyptians
[1:02:03] the plagues were signs and wonders amen
[1:02:06] it punished the egyptians but it was a
[1:02:09] blessing to the true israelites now all
[1:02:12] those great things attracted some
[1:02:15] parties from even people who are
[1:02:17] non-israelites
[1:02:20] for people who do not even know what the
[1:02:24] content the context and the and the and
[1:02:28] the fact of that revival is
[1:02:30] it attracted them because as in every
[1:02:33] situation
[1:02:34] many will be attracted to a revival
[1:02:37] for different reasons
[1:02:40] when martin luther had a mighty revival
[1:02:43] a lot of people were attracted to it not
[1:02:45] because they understood
[1:02:47] the message of justification
[1:02:49] not because what martin luther was
[1:02:52] saying was anything to them
[1:02:55] but because they saw it as an avenue to
[1:02:58] be free from the yoke
[1:03:01] of the roman system
[1:03:03] whether spiritually or physically and
[1:03:05] they are seeing a man who was
[1:03:07] championing the cause of coming out of
[1:03:09] that system and is not getting out he's
[1:03:12] not getting killed nobody is disturbing
[1:03:14] him they said this is an opportunity for
[1:03:17] us to also do what for to also come out
[1:03:19] of it
[1:03:20] some wanted to be free from the burden
[1:03:23] of penitents from wanted to be free from
[1:03:26] the burden of offerings and the levies
[1:03:29] that they have been put on them amen and
[1:03:31] that was the reason they left luther and
[1:03:34] that was why it was said the greatest
[1:03:36] victory in luther art was not to protest
[1:03:40] the catholic church and get by with it
[1:03:43] but to be able to rise above the
[1:03:45] fanaticism that greeted his revival
[1:03:48] because in that revival mixed motion
[1:03:50] also went with him
[1:03:52] mixed multitude are people who do not
[1:03:55] understand why we are doing what we are
[1:03:56] doing they just wanted to be free so
[1:04:00] they consider that revival
[1:04:02] a means to their own end
[1:04:05] so in this revival also the scripture
[1:04:08] made it clear to us that a lot of mixed
[1:04:11] multitudes went with them
[1:04:12] we don't know their number but they were
[1:04:14] in that number
[1:04:16] they sang with them
[1:04:18] they enjoyed the water from the rock
[1:04:20] they were eating manna with them
[1:04:22] every blessing that god send that upon
[1:04:25] the people it was sent unto them even
[1:04:28] when god was given instruction he said
[1:04:30] this instruction these ordinances are
[1:04:33] not only meant for you israelites even
[1:04:35] for the strangers who are in your means
[1:04:40] folks also a lot of them perhaps they
[1:04:42] were first born and so forth
[1:04:45] they you know they saw the revival
[1:04:47] started with the blood of the passover
[1:04:49] lamb do you know what they did they also
[1:04:51] put themselves under age and because the
[1:04:54] deal is when i see the blood i will pass
[1:04:57] over you they also escape the death
[1:05:00] of the passover night so every blessing
[1:05:03] that a true israelite is enjoying was
[1:05:07] also enjoyed by the mixed multitudes
[1:05:12] but then the seed cannot be aired with
[1:05:15] the shock
[1:05:17] mixed multitude could go very far
[1:05:20] but it can never go to the end
[1:05:22] judas's carriage went very far but he
[1:05:25] never went to the end
[1:05:27] and as such these guys are going so far
[1:05:31] this is the reason god did not just take
[1:05:34] its people out of
[1:05:36] egypt
[1:05:37] and just put them straight into the land
[1:05:40] of canaan
[1:05:42] what did he do he allowed a gap period
[1:05:45] of a wilderness journey
[1:05:48] the wilderness journey
[1:05:50] is like a sanctifying time
[1:05:53] wherein we test virtue and we test
[1:05:56] rebellion
[1:05:58] your own individual sanctification is
[1:06:01] also a testing time to test whether you
[1:06:04] will be a rebellious child or a general
[1:06:07] child of god that we go through
[1:06:10] that is the message of the prophet and
[1:06:11] the message of our present water from
[1:06:14] the living rock so it's a period to test
[1:06:17] the genuinely of the people because
[1:06:20] redemption itself has two harms as most
[1:06:24] of us know it involves coming out of a
[1:06:27] place and going into another place
[1:06:31] are you here church
[1:06:32] so you must come out of somewhere and
[1:06:34] you must be taken to somewhere if you
[1:06:37] are brought out and you are left hanging
[1:06:40] your redemption is not complete
[1:06:42] so god has brought israel out of egypt
[1:06:46] their journey cannot end in the
[1:06:48] wilderness but the wilderness experience
[1:06:51] is essential because it will prove
[1:06:54] it will save
[1:06:56] amen
[1:06:58] it will separate it will cut it with
[1:07:01] lies
[1:07:02] so that only those who are genuine
[1:07:05] enter into god's inheritance
[1:07:08] [Music]
[1:07:09] there is nothing wrong with the message
[1:07:11] of the hour
[1:07:13] this is the third exodus
[1:07:15] if the first exodus went through that
[1:07:18] the last must go through it
[1:07:20] exodus is actually a redemption
[1:07:23] because it involves a calling out and
[1:07:25] bringing into somewhere the prophet said
[1:07:28] if god brought you out of a place and he
[1:07:30] didn't take you to where issues he would
[1:07:33] have done a poor job he brought israel
[1:07:36] hallelujah out of egypt is taking them
[1:07:39] into the land of promise
[1:07:41] amen when he came in flesh in the second
[1:07:44] exodus he brought the church out of
[1:07:47] religion amen
[1:07:50] he brought them out of religion and he
[1:07:53] brought them to the church amen he
[1:07:55] called them out of the religion and they
[1:07:57] make a church out of them hallelujah in
[1:08:01] this last one he is calling the bride
[1:08:03] out of the church
[1:08:05] and if he calls us out of the church
[1:08:08] there must also be a homeland
[1:08:11] amen
[1:08:12] there must be a fresh canaan
[1:08:15] a spiritual land of the baptism of the
[1:08:18] holy ghost that he must bring you and i
[1:08:20] into
[1:08:21] and so the journey is just the same but
[1:08:24] you see i want us to watch something
[1:08:25] here
[1:08:26] very important
[1:08:30] when he brought them out
[1:08:34] they have crossed the red sea
[1:08:36] they have sung the song of victory amen
[1:08:40] they have enjoyed all the goodness of
[1:08:42] the lord
[1:08:43] god knew
[1:08:45] that for these people to be sustained
[1:08:48] he must give them something for their
[1:08:50] journey
[1:08:54] the signs and wonders
[1:08:56] up through the crossing of the red sea
[1:08:59] up to the water from the rock
[1:09:01] up to the manor from heaven
[1:09:04] up to the flesh and the meat that they
[1:09:06] ate
[1:09:07] when they cried for a variety of meals
[1:09:11] they were all signs miracles and wonders
[1:09:16] i want you to follow me
[1:09:18] because if you understand the first
[1:09:21] exodus
[1:09:23] you will understand your own exodus
[1:09:26] as i've always said the first exodus was
[1:09:29] the planting exodus
[1:09:32] the last one here is the harvest of all
[1:09:35] the planting
[1:09:37] and if you planted one seed in the
[1:09:39] planty season you are not going to rip
[1:09:41] just one seed you are going to read
[1:09:44] plenty seeds
[1:09:45] out of that one seed if it is a maze or
[1:09:48] icon from your one seed you have the
[1:09:51] potential to reap 612 seats
[1:09:55] if you plant two that is
[1:09:57] 1224 seats and many more like that so
[1:10:01] there is always more
[1:10:03] of whatever goes down
[1:10:06] in the planting coming up in the harvest
[1:10:10] so like i said before where you see one
[1:10:13] coral expect several colors today where
[1:10:16] you see one dayton expect several
[1:10:19] daytimes today where you see one abhiram
[1:10:22] expect many abyrams today and where you
[1:10:25] see one joshua expect many joshuas
[1:10:29] [Applause]
[1:10:32] expect many calibers
[1:10:35] those who will never come up with an
[1:10:36] evil report
[1:10:38] those whose report will not only bless
[1:10:41] them it will preserve them
[1:10:44] [Applause]
[1:10:45] and the prophet said the bible said they
[1:10:48] were able to give a better report
[1:10:50] because they have another spirit
[1:10:53] so we can begin to see the working of
[1:10:55] the holy spirit even from the old
[1:10:57] testament
[1:10:58] it might come upon them as an anointing
[1:11:01] or as an inspiration and is these last
[1:11:04] days is coming upon us as a baptism
[1:11:08] it's coming inside of us
[1:11:10] so if you show forth a greater life
[1:11:13] a more glorious life than it was under
[1:11:16] shadow
[1:11:17] after all if you see the shadow of
[1:11:19] something a man it is still not very
[1:11:22] clear until the substance declares it
[1:11:26] you are the substance of all the shadow
[1:11:28] that was in the first exodus
[1:11:31] so this age presents a more glorious age
[1:11:34] [Applause]
[1:11:37] you love him
[1:11:39] all right this is where i'm coming
[1:11:42] in that wilderness
[1:11:44] there were many outstanding things that
[1:11:46] took place
[1:11:48] and all these things we had done to
[1:11:50] prove the people
[1:11:52] in other to separate
[1:11:55] between the genuine siege
[1:11:57] and the falsies
[1:11:59] between the people for whom the revival
[1:12:02] is meant
[1:12:03] and the mixed multitude
[1:12:06] so whatever happened then expect a
[1:12:09] repeat of it now if that is god's
[1:12:12] pattern and program it is going to be
[1:12:14] exactly the same thing now
[1:12:17] in the first exodus
[1:12:19] the ministry that brought the exodus
[1:12:22] suffered both from within and without
[1:12:27] balaam attacked from outside
[1:12:30] but dayton quran and abiram attacked
[1:12:33] from within
[1:12:34] amen if those are the characters and if
[1:12:37] that is the shadow
[1:12:38] you would be expecting to see the same
[1:12:41] thing in this substance
[1:12:43] now here we come to one of the most
[1:12:47] crucial aspects of that exodus
[1:12:50] you will appreciate it as we go on
[1:12:53] in fact the redemption of the exodus
[1:12:57] was sealed by this aspect
[1:13:00] you heard god he said
[1:13:02] if you will indeed
[1:13:06] acting unto me
[1:13:08] and obey my words
[1:13:10] do you know that up till that moment he
[1:13:13] has not given the word for that hour
[1:13:21] go search the bible
[1:13:23] they have only been living
[1:13:26] by the first two blessings
[1:13:29] of every ministry
[1:13:32] they were living by the signs that we
[1:13:35] can say the sign in the end
[1:13:37] the messianic discernments
[1:13:40] which the prophet called the healing
[1:13:42] service
[1:13:43] that was why the face of moses ministry
[1:13:47] up to that point
[1:13:48] revolved around signs and wonders
[1:13:54] i want you to follow this very closely
[1:13:57] it will help you in your journey
[1:13:59] [Music]
[1:14:01] they saw the plagues
[1:14:03] they saw the passover
[1:14:05] amen
[1:14:07] they saw the manner
[1:14:09] they received water from the rock
[1:14:12] hallelujah
[1:14:14] they saw all those external blessings
[1:14:18] now
[1:14:19] when god was given all these things is
[1:14:22] to be able to gather faith
[1:14:25] in a bracket for the main thing
[1:14:29] i want to tell the church this morning
[1:14:32] that as powerful as those things were
[1:14:35] that even elicited so much revival
[1:14:38] until sisters and brothers were singing
[1:14:41] the song of victory
[1:14:43] and it looks like every supernatural god
[1:14:46] heart he was pouring upon the church
[1:14:50] by which he put the fear of that church
[1:14:53] upon all the people around
[1:14:55] yet that was not the main blessing
[1:15:01] that didn't make them a peculiar
[1:15:04] treasure to god
[1:15:07] oh listen to me for your good church
[1:15:10] it didn't make them watch a peculiar
[1:15:13] treasure to god
[1:15:16] as god was settling down with those
[1:15:18] things
[1:15:20] god raised the stakes
[1:15:23] and it came with an ayah with a higher
[1:15:25] standard
[1:15:27] then he began to tell the church
[1:15:29] if indeed
[1:15:33] not by much
[1:15:35] because there's a generation that will
[1:15:37] pay leap service to the message
[1:15:41] there is a generation that will not go
[1:15:43] for
[1:15:45] you will see big banners and mighty
[1:15:47] signbots
[1:15:48] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:15:50] angel when it shall begin to sound
[1:15:53] and yet in the midst of that
[1:15:55] congregation the voice of the seventh
[1:15:57] angel will be so despised and hated
[1:16:04] who will deceive who here
[1:16:06] church you have been amped with the word
[1:16:08] of the lord
[1:16:10] if you fought for deception it is your
[1:16:12] fault
[1:16:14] you see mighty banners
[1:16:17] you see great imprints on bosses
[1:16:20] in the voice of the sadness of the
[1:16:22] seventh angel when it shall begin to
[1:16:24] sound
[1:16:25] and it is an aberration to even read one
[1:16:29] quotation of the prophets
[1:16:30] in the midst of such a congregation
[1:16:33] what is the voice of the seventh angel
[1:16:38] who is that voice
[1:16:42] friends don't pay lip service to the
[1:16:44] message of the hour
[1:16:46] whatever the word says
[1:16:48] amen
[1:16:49] must be an absolute must take your
[1:16:52] absolute consideration
[1:16:55] whatever the word says
[1:16:58] must be swallowed and accepted lying ook
[1:17:01] and sinker
[1:17:05] we have no better formula for redemption
[1:17:08] than that which the lord has given unto
[1:17:10] us
[1:17:12] you could enjoy your signs you could
[1:17:14] enjoy your wonders and yet your heart is
[1:17:17] far from the lord
[1:17:21] those are simple patterns even from the
[1:17:23] message of our lord jesus christ
[1:17:26] people followed him for signs and
[1:17:28] wonders
[1:17:29] for mighty miracles the bible declared
[1:17:32] at a point they ever wanted to make him
[1:17:34] king
[1:17:35] but you know what is the bible said he
[1:17:38] said all this great emotional outpouring
[1:17:41] is not because of his words but it's
[1:17:44] because of the miracles of bread and so
[1:17:46] on and so forth
[1:17:49] but there is a generation that is
[1:17:51] designed
[1:17:53] to move beyond these levels
[1:17:58] many we hence their journey in the
[1:18:00] wilderness
[1:18:02] we cannot help it
[1:18:03] but by the grace of god there's a
[1:18:05] generation that we go through
[1:18:09] i'm going through
[1:18:10] friends by stranger we go through
[1:18:14] no matter what comes no matter what goal
[1:18:16] i will go through
[1:18:17] [Applause]
[1:18:18] because if we cannot go through we have
[1:18:21] failed
[1:18:22] if we cannot go through we have not made
[1:18:24] it there will never be a second chance
[1:18:27] for a man who has heard the truth who
[1:18:30] has acknowledged it is the truth and
[1:18:32] refused to walk in the light of the
[1:18:34] truth it is an unpardonable sin
[1:18:38] that's what the word says
[1:18:40] [Applause]
[1:18:40] [Music]
[1:18:42] so make up your mind to serve the lord
[1:18:46] prepare
[1:18:47] to meet your lord
[1:18:52] so these people have enjoyed all those
[1:18:54] blessings till that very moment
[1:18:58] i want to drill this so hard
[1:19:00] so that you can see what is happening in
[1:19:02] your own day
[1:19:04] now
[1:19:05] but all the things they have enjoyed has
[1:19:08] not made them a peculiar treasure
[1:19:12] to god
[1:19:14] while we make them a peculiar treasure
[1:19:17] that god will do many mighty things for
[1:19:20] as he said in the book of exodus 19
[1:19:23] is if indeed
[1:19:28] they will obey and follow his words
[1:19:32] we will obey and follow his conduct we
[1:19:35] will obey and follow his order we will
[1:19:38] obey and follow his doctrine
[1:19:41] [Applause]
[1:19:41] [Music]
[1:19:43] if there is nothing in us to do that
[1:19:47] oh you are fierce for handing it in the
[1:19:49] wilderness
[1:19:54] exodus 19.
[1:19:57] so it follows
[1:19:59] that the signs and wonders and all the
[1:20:02] mighty things
[1:20:03] attracted all kind of congregations
[1:20:07] it was the same thing in the second
[1:20:09] exodus
[1:20:10] and it is the same thing in the third
[1:20:12] exodus are you following me
[1:20:15] when the prophet was going around the
[1:20:17] world healing the sick doing mighty
[1:20:19] things outstanding great miracles such
[1:20:22] as have never been heard before except
[1:20:25] in the bible days amen
[1:20:28] they still urge the prophet today as the
[1:20:31] person that started the post-world war
[1:20:34] healing
[1:20:36] and revival
[1:20:37] by which the nations of the earth we are
[1:20:40] healed
[1:20:41] both in mind in body and in their
[1:20:45] spirits
[1:20:47] because the messenger by the ministry
[1:20:49] represented a new hope
[1:20:52] for a world that has been bedeviled
[1:20:55] by the effects of war
[1:20:57] thank god for the message of the hour
[1:20:59] thank god for sending a messenger thank
[1:21:02] god for brother abraham
[1:21:03] i am not ashamed to mention his name
[1:21:06] i mentioned apostle paul freely i
[1:21:08] mentioned prophet moses freely and i
[1:21:11] must mention brother brown freely
[1:21:13] if that is offensive oh my
[1:21:16] it shows you are prone to offence
[1:21:24] amen
[1:21:26] but you see all those things that he did
[1:21:30] they were just to attract
[1:21:33] a lot of people who we attracted we get
[1:21:36] stuck there
[1:21:37] they will never be able to move beyond
[1:21:39] that
[1:21:41] all some people asked today was god sent
[1:21:44] us brother abraham
[1:21:45] all some people have today is a water
[1:21:48] baptism in jesus name beyond that they
[1:21:51] can't go any further
[1:21:54] and it is in that father that there is
[1:21:56] actually redemption
[1:21:58] because the redemption of the last days
[1:22:01] will take you beyond
[1:22:05] the healing service ministry
[1:22:08] it will bring you to the abundant
[1:22:10] revelation of the world it is that
[1:22:12] revelation that can change you
[1:22:15] it is that revelation that can give you
[1:22:17] a true healing that can give you true
[1:22:19] conversion that can give you genuine
[1:22:22] salvation and i can plant your feet
[1:22:25] into the land of promise
[1:22:28] outside of that you cannot make it
[1:22:31] it is that revelation that will make you
[1:22:33] a peculiar treasure
[1:22:36] in other words it is that revelation
[1:22:38] that vindicates you
[1:22:40] as the hillage of the hour
[1:22:46] you will appreciate why i'm drawing this
[1:22:48] background shortly
[1:22:50] you love him
[1:22:51] [Music]
[1:22:53] now
[1:22:55] when they got to that place
[1:22:58] [Music]
[1:23:00] god told moses
[1:23:02] i called your attention to it in the
[1:23:03] scripture
[1:23:05] he said i'm going to come down in the
[1:23:07] thick cloud
[1:23:12] amen
[1:23:14] if you can put it on the on the screen
[1:23:16] for me
[1:23:17] i'm going to come down in the word thick
[1:23:20] clouds
[1:23:23] so clouds will be associated with this
[1:23:26] journey
[1:23:30] are you with me
[1:23:32] cloud will be associated with this
[1:23:34] journey
[1:23:36] fire will be associated with this
[1:23:38] journey
[1:23:39] and by the grace of god in these last
[1:23:42] days we have the witness of a cloud
[1:23:45] and we have the witness of the pillar of
[1:23:47] fire
[1:23:51] the pillar of fire brought them out
[1:23:55] the cloud will take them in
[1:24:03] the generations of the earth must
[1:24:05] understand this
[1:24:07] the pillar of fire will bring them out
[1:24:11] amen
[1:24:12] because in exodus chapter 3 he said i am
[1:24:15] come down
[1:24:17] amen
[1:24:18] and whom did i see whom did moses see he
[1:24:22] saw a bush that was burning
[1:24:24] and the leaves were not consumed
[1:24:27] amen that was the pillar of fire
[1:24:30] in the midst of the bush
[1:24:32] come down to do what he said i have
[1:24:35] heard the cry of my people
[1:24:37] and now i am come down for the purpose
[1:24:40] of what delivering them
[1:24:43] i am going to take them out
[1:24:45] amen
[1:24:48] at ohio river in 1933 the pillar of fire
[1:24:52] came down
[1:24:53] and he gave a commission
[1:24:56] amen
[1:24:57] of watch or for running of christ
[1:25:00] amen that which is aimed at bringing
[1:25:03] people out
[1:25:06] people cannot be brought out without
[1:25:09] some sort of signs and attraction
[1:25:13] and that was why moses asked the lord if
[1:25:15] i get to that place
[1:25:17] what do i say
[1:25:19] say i am the i am send you
[1:25:23] what will be the vindication that you
[1:25:25] sent me
[1:25:26] if they want to see something because
[1:25:28] moses knew people would want to see some
[1:25:31] vindication
[1:25:32] they would want to see some things and
[1:25:35] god began his vindication with his rod
[1:25:38] amen
[1:25:39] they saw signs of supernatural by the
[1:25:41] road
[1:25:42] because the road was given over to god
[1:25:45] it then god gave him two signs
[1:25:48] one by the road one by his arm and he
[1:25:50] said if they do not believe the voice of
[1:25:52] the first they will accept that of the
[1:25:55] second
[1:25:56] and from that road came many other
[1:25:58] mighty miracles and signs of wonder
[1:26:01] which really attracted the people that
[1:26:04] god must have been with this man
[1:26:06] because even though god came down it was
[1:26:09] not god himself that went to confront
[1:26:12] vero
[1:26:13] it was moses pharaoh saw
[1:26:16] hallelujah and the vessel of moses
[1:26:20] became a confusion to pharaoh
[1:26:22] he took the words of moses as the watch
[1:26:25] of a man instead of taking it as the
[1:26:28] words of god he didn't realize that
[1:26:31] moses felt the pillar of fire
[1:26:36] in these last days the messenger filled
[1:26:38] the pillar of fire
[1:26:40] to interpret the words to you
[1:26:43] it is the interpreted watch that will
[1:26:45] make you a peculiar treasure
[1:26:48] a holy priesthood a royal nation that
[1:26:51] will vindicate you as the seed of god
[1:26:54] when you have problem with that
[1:26:56] interpretation you are oh you are a
[1:26:58] wilderness man
[1:27:00] and many are wandering in the wilderness
[1:27:02] today that is why they were devising all
[1:27:05] kinds of programs in order to keep up
[1:27:07] alive but there is nothing that will
[1:27:10] sustain the believer than the revealed
[1:27:12] world
[1:27:13] it is the revival of the oblige
[1:27:18] [Music]
[1:27:20] so moses had all his first second pools
[1:27:25] but it is the church
[1:27:28] which is the opening of the wedge
[1:27:31] that would actually produce the treasure
[1:27:35] the first and the second pulse the mixed
[1:27:38] multitude and the real seat enjoyed it
[1:27:40] alike
[1:27:42] is it getting clear to you they all
[1:27:44] enjoyed the blessings but it's the
[1:27:47] blessings of the thought pool is
[1:27:49] eventually to sieve out of mixed
[1:27:51] multitude so that only the peculiar
[1:27:54] treasure
[1:27:55] makes its inside and that is the real
[1:27:58] redemption
[1:28:00] this is the reason the prophet said i
[1:28:02] want this easter to mean more to you
[1:28:05] than any other easter
[1:28:07] how many ever read that in the
[1:28:09] quotations
[1:28:10] it is the in the message it is the
[1:28:12] rising of the sun if you look at the
[1:28:15] topic of that message alone
[1:28:18] and you are spiritual you will realize
[1:28:21] that god was announcing the beginning of
[1:28:23] a new day
[1:28:25] because the horizon of the sun announces
[1:28:27] the beginning of a new day
[1:28:29] begins the beginning of a new
[1:28:31] dispensation or the beginning of a new
[1:28:34] economy
[1:28:35] are you following me
[1:28:37] so both the topic and the content for
[1:28:39] the spiritual mind means a great deal
[1:28:42] sometimes in order to enjoy the content
[1:28:44] you must have the revelation of the
[1:28:46] topic
[1:28:49] a new day was declared
[1:28:51] hallelujah
[1:28:53] just as it was for israel also a new day
[1:28:57] a new month the new season was declared
[1:28:59] and this declaration
[1:29:02] inside this declaration
[1:29:03] the prophet using this horizon of the
[1:29:06] sun
[1:29:06] to explain
[1:29:08] what is
[1:29:11] to the believer
[1:29:13] the easter we celebrate is not what the
[1:29:16] world does
[1:29:19] amen
[1:29:20] in fact the easter of the water become
[1:29:22] polluted and it has become commercial
[1:29:26] they don't even remember christ as such
[1:29:29] in the entire thing if they are fasting
[1:29:31] there is a commercial excellence they
[1:29:33] will advertise things that will help you
[1:29:35] retain your body nutrients so to the
[1:29:37] people of the world is for them to make
[1:29:39] money at such times amen and also to the
[1:29:43] church but to the believer islam means
[1:29:46] much more than that
[1:29:50] the prophet said for many years
[1:29:53] what we have been celebrating is the
[1:29:55] resurrection of the groom
[1:29:58] of the lord jesus christ
[1:30:00] but in the easter of 1965 he said i want
[1:30:03] to call you attention to another easter
[1:30:06] egg
[1:30:07] amen then they began to say the same
[1:30:10] watch that applies
[1:30:12] to the groom applies to the blight
[1:30:15] amen
[1:30:17] he said because the bride will be word
[1:30:19] of his words
[1:30:20] life of his life
[1:30:22] power of his power
[1:30:24] in fact she will be him
[1:30:29] so where the bible said he is risen
[1:30:33] he is not here i can safely say she is
[1:30:36] risen
[1:30:38] she is not here
[1:30:40] because the bride is part of the groom
[1:30:43] and if that took place for the groom the
[1:30:45] blood must also manifest each
[1:30:48] where was the blight dead in the blood
[1:30:51] was dead in denominations
[1:30:53] hallelujah there are so many blights in
[1:30:56] the denomination that will have their
[1:30:58] easter
[1:30:59] we all were once in that
[1:31:02] but because we carried the seed of
[1:31:03] election
[1:31:05] the signs and wonders were not enough to
[1:31:08] bring us out
[1:31:09] but this bride will hear the voice of
[1:31:11] the mama eagle
[1:31:13] and deep we call to the deep
[1:31:16] at the noise of the water spout
[1:31:19] and the real blood will not be
[1:31:20] comfortable again
[1:31:22] because when that deep cause makes the
[1:31:25] call
[1:31:25] he's going to ignite something in you
[1:31:28] was it igniting the seed of god
[1:31:31] once that seed is shaken and come alive
[1:31:34] amen it's like the dry bones of ezekiel
[1:31:38] the bible said the moment is caught life
[1:31:41] it never remained dry
[1:31:43] there was motion in progress
[1:31:46] there was thing there were things taking
[1:31:48] place it was progressing and progressing
[1:31:51] until it progressed to a statue to a
[1:31:54] point of a full-blown man
[1:31:56] radius and harmony
[1:31:59] [Applause]
[1:32:02] i don't know what this does to you
[1:32:03] believers
[1:32:04] but once that seed is struck
[1:32:07] life has begun
[1:32:09] you cannot stop life you cannot in their
[1:32:12] life let life be on the rock it will
[1:32:14] come out
[1:32:16] i've seen plantations come up on the
[1:32:18] rock i would happen i do not know but
[1:32:21] these are god's supernatural
[1:32:23] signs and evidences to show that life is
[1:32:26] unstoppable
[1:32:28] this life of god in us once ignited by
[1:32:31] the word of god
[1:32:32] my goodness
[1:32:39] you love him this morning
[1:32:44] so this church that has received so many
[1:32:47] abundant powers signs and wonders
[1:32:51] having been brought up by the pillar of
[1:32:52] fire
[1:32:54] need something
[1:32:56] to take care of them
[1:32:59] in the wilderness and beyond the
[1:33:01] wilderness
[1:33:04] it will be a permanent blessing
[1:33:06] to establish them and show them fought
[1:33:10] as a different people
[1:33:13] a royal priesthood a peculiar treasure
[1:33:16] among all the people of the earth
[1:33:20] these blessings came out of the clouds
[1:33:30] god said i will come down in a thick
[1:33:32] cloud amen
[1:33:34] lord i come unto thee the thick cloud
[1:33:37] that the people may hear
[1:33:39] when i speak within and do what and
[1:33:42] believe thee forever
[1:33:46] [Music]
[1:33:46] [Applause]
[1:33:51] we must believe this message
[1:33:54] for whatever
[1:33:56] because by the opening of the wedge
[1:34:00] it has the content
[1:34:02] to take your force throughout time
[1:34:05] and throw us into eternity
[1:34:08] this is why the prophet said that seven
[1:34:10] seal
[1:34:12] is like a rocket
[1:34:14] that drops air that drops there that
[1:34:16] drops there and drops there and what
[1:34:18] does it do again he said that seven seal
[1:34:21] is the end of time
[1:34:24] is the end of a struggling watch
[1:34:26] is the end of everything so as long as
[1:34:30] we are here
[1:34:31] waiting for eternity we shall be in the
[1:34:33] seventh seal
[1:34:35] amen and the seventh till it's a
[1:34:37] revelation designed
[1:34:41] to take care of you forever
[1:34:43] so we will that exodus church will have
[1:34:46] no alternative
[1:34:48] than the message of their hour
[1:34:51] oh they are not getting this you will
[1:34:54] have no alternative
[1:34:56] to the teaching of
[1:34:58] moses because god wanted to come down in
[1:35:02] a cloud
[1:35:04] to vindicate his servant
[1:35:06] and put him in a position
[1:35:09] that the church before him
[1:35:11] must believe him forever
[1:35:14] whether he is there or not
[1:35:26] moses didn't even live to enter into
[1:35:30] canaan
[1:35:31] physically he saw it
[1:35:34] but his feet never got in there
[1:35:36] are you catching it
[1:35:38] but something will survive
[1:35:40] moses amen it is not the presence of
[1:35:44] moses
[1:35:46] that will be blood will be important
[1:35:48] than the teaching the word moses brought
[1:35:51] amen so in the absence of moses the word
[1:35:55] must remain believed
[1:35:58] forever
[1:35:59] because it's got the content
[1:36:02] to take care of them all the way
[1:36:04] through the wilderness into the
[1:36:07] inheritance and establish them in their
[1:36:10] inheritance
[1:36:14] this was why when joshua came
[1:36:17] listen to me
[1:36:18] god want joshua
[1:36:20] he said this book of law
[1:36:23] i will tell you what came out of the
[1:36:25] cloud so you will appreciate it he said
[1:36:28] this book of law
[1:36:30] hallelujah must not depart from your
[1:36:33] mouth
[1:36:34] day and night
[1:36:36] you must meditate dearing church of the
[1:36:39] living god this message of the hour
[1:36:43] must not depart from your mouth
[1:36:46] must not depart from your family must
[1:36:49] not depart from your church you must
[1:36:51] meditate therein
[1:36:54] day and night
[1:36:55] till when till jesus comes
[1:36:58] there must not be an alternative to the
[1:37:02] message of the hour it follows the
[1:37:04] pattern
[1:37:05] of the biblical exodus that was the
[1:37:08] shadow this is the substance
[1:37:11] [Applause]
[1:37:17] do you see why it is difficult for us to
[1:37:20] leave off the message
[1:37:22] do you see why we must do everything by
[1:37:24] the message do you know why we must
[1:37:26] loyal to the message because it is the
[1:37:29] same commandment
[1:37:30] if club vindicated moses to be believed
[1:37:34] forever i want to tell you cloud has
[1:37:36] come again
[1:37:38] [Applause]
[1:37:39] [Music]
[1:37:40] [Applause]
[1:37:43] this cloud was not signs and wonders
[1:37:46] it wasn't the festival it wasn't the
[1:37:48] second pro it wasn't an healing service
[1:37:51] it was the revealed world that was why
[1:37:55] before the cloud took place god won the
[1:37:57] church
[1:37:59] amen
[1:38:00] if you will indeed
[1:38:08] do you know friends
[1:38:10] when the prophet or our lord jesus
[1:38:12] christ was having the ministry of
[1:38:15] healing service the signs and wonders do
[1:38:18] you know it gathered all kind of
[1:38:20] congregations
[1:38:22] do you know everybody was attracted to
[1:38:24] each i've shown you that of jesus our
[1:38:27] lord in the bible how about that of the
[1:38:29] prophet
[1:38:30] a lot of people were attracted to him
[1:38:33] the full gospel the united pentecostal
[1:38:36] the oneness the assemblies the
[1:38:38] foursquare and many other mighty
[1:38:41] assemblies of god mighty denominations
[1:38:44] they were the one who sponsored them
[1:38:45] around the world seven times
[1:38:48] you know why because the message then
[1:38:51] they can manage it
[1:38:53] because then it wasn't much of the
[1:38:55] message
[1:38:56] that was the measure it was the
[1:38:58] attraction of the signs and wonders
[1:39:00] are you catching it but that could take
[1:39:03] care of denominations
[1:39:05] that cannot take care of the seed
[1:39:07] it could attract the seeds to come close
[1:39:10] but the seed needs something more
[1:39:14] for his own redemption for his own body
[1:39:17] change for his own conversion for his
[1:39:20] own deliverance
[1:39:24] this is what the prophet said the
[1:39:26] evidence that you have the holy ghost is
[1:39:29] that you have the ability to follow the
[1:39:32] watch to the storehouse all the way
[1:39:34] through
[1:39:35] amen many had had a claim that they have
[1:39:38] the holy spirit before the opening of
[1:39:41] the wedge
[1:39:42] the evidence that they truly have the
[1:39:44] spirit is their ability to follow the
[1:39:46] wage
[1:39:47] completely in conduct in order in
[1:39:51] doctrine if they cannot do it he put a
[1:39:54] question mark
[1:39:56] on their conversion
[1:40:00] this must not be the opinion of man
[1:40:02] this was what the prophet said at the
[1:40:04] opening of the word you got no thought
[1:40:06] coming it is no longer your faith in the
[1:40:09] son of god
[1:40:10] but you will live by the faith of the
[1:40:12] son of god the conviction of the son of
[1:40:15] god the belief of the son of god the
[1:40:18] revelation of the son of god because
[1:40:21] you've denied your own thinking you have
[1:40:23] no more opinion in this matter you only
[1:40:26] want to think what god says and nothing
[1:40:28] more
[1:40:37] this is how we are delivered to church
[1:40:40] we were attracted like the others amen
[1:40:44] it's like a fisherman's bait you get
[1:40:46] that
[1:40:47] the fisherman threw the night in the
[1:40:48] water amen
[1:40:50] what attracted the fishes and all kinds
[1:40:53] of water things
[1:40:55] crabs and all kinds of things
[1:40:58] is not the net
[1:41:00] is the bait in the niche
[1:41:03] are you catching it the is always
[1:41:05] nice and attractive sweet smelling
[1:41:08] hallelujah
[1:41:10] but you see when they are attracted they
[1:41:12] all come into the ledge
[1:41:14] but is the fisherman interested in all
[1:41:16] sick creatures
[1:41:18] no sir
[1:41:19] the people he really wanted is fish
[1:41:22] he is not a crab man he is a fisherman
[1:41:25] so when they pull out his net what does
[1:41:27] he do
[1:41:28] he separates
[1:41:30] hallelujah so the message of separation
[1:41:34] is what came in exodus 19. the message
[1:41:37] of separation today is the tadpole
[1:41:40] is the opening of the word
[1:41:43] and it came from the cloud
[1:41:46] until that moment the real bride is not
[1:41:49] identified do you know up till this
[1:41:52] moment you don't know who is who
[1:41:54] it was after the giving of the message
[1:41:57] that some people began to become obvious
[1:42:00] date and quran and aberrant became
[1:42:02] obvious
[1:42:03] it was at the giving of the message that
[1:42:06] you realize that some people can still
[1:42:08] come up with golden calves
[1:42:11] are you here
[1:42:13] it's after that you realize that after
[1:42:15] two years of journey some people are
[1:42:17] still ready to go back two years
[1:42:19] backwards instead of two weeks forward
[1:42:22] into the inheritance as a matter of fact
[1:42:25] they began to look for a captain to take
[1:42:27] them back to egypt
[1:42:29] it was after this exodus 19 that you saw
[1:42:32] some elders who brought evil reports you
[1:42:36] will never know there's a congregation
[1:42:38] like that you will never know that there
[1:42:40] are no men like that great preachers
[1:42:42] like that who could preach just one
[1:42:44] service in few hours and convert the
[1:42:48] entire church into worldliness
[1:42:51] and convert the entire church into egypt
[1:42:54] so much inspiration until people were
[1:42:57] ready to look for a captain to take them
[1:42:59] back to egypt after two years
[1:43:02] journey to kadesh bernier
[1:43:07] exodus 19 is very important
[1:43:10] do not play with the message of the hour
[1:43:14] if you don't have a conviction of it you
[1:43:16] better go on your knees
[1:43:18] pray for revelation
[1:43:20] if you take everything and you become a
[1:43:22] cesspool something is wrong
[1:43:28] watch this church
[1:43:32] i will come onto the in a thick cloud
[1:43:35] and what did he do
[1:43:37] he told the folks is that moses tell the
[1:43:39] people this is my plan
[1:43:42] so god gave it in advance
[1:43:45] so it looks like a what a prophecy
[1:43:48] there's going to be a mighty
[1:43:50] visitation a mighty blasting so rocky so
[1:43:55] tremendous it will shake everywhere
[1:43:57] prepare the mind of the people
[1:44:00] didn't god told william brown to prepare
[1:44:03] our mind
[1:44:05] are you spiritual
[1:44:07] he told him to bring a message says is
[1:44:09] this the time
[1:44:11] it was a message to prepare our mind
[1:44:14] for the visitation of the cloud
[1:44:19] in the message is this the time the
[1:44:21] prophet said i saw a terrible blast
[1:44:24] are we together
[1:44:26] he said this blast was so rocky
[1:44:29] until the prophet thought it was the end
[1:44:31] of his life
[1:44:32] and brother brown began to guess many
[1:44:34] things that blas could be
[1:44:37] could it mean this could it mean that
[1:44:40] could mean the other why which why would
[1:44:44] there be such a concern because it is
[1:44:47] coming to a
[1:44:48] need to edge point
[1:44:52] for the church at that hour it is coming
[1:44:55] to such a point
[1:44:57] a pointed edge a thin razor hedge that
[1:45:01] is difficult to stand
[1:45:03] and maintain your balance without a
[1:45:05] supernatural end holding you forth
[1:45:09] it is coming to the edge of the cliff
[1:45:15] but most of what the prophet thought it
[1:45:17] could mean it never meant
[1:45:20] because god held it in his chest
[1:45:23] hallelujah
[1:45:24] but as he told moses in exodus 19 to
[1:45:27] prepare the art of the people he also
[1:45:30] told willie abraham to prepare the heart
[1:45:32] of his people even william brown
[1:45:34] prepared his house
[1:45:36] he told his wife that he believes this
[1:45:39] he gave a valedictory message
[1:45:43] and now she should leave her life and
[1:45:45] cope with the children after he is gone
[1:45:47] i think sister meadows saw a lot in life
[1:45:50] no wonder she grew gray healthier than a
[1:45:53] time
[1:45:54] oh my god
[1:45:55] so much pressure from the ministry
[1:45:59] but you see what the prophet never
[1:46:01] realized was that it was meant to be a
[1:46:04] change
[1:46:06] of the ministry
[1:46:08] it was meant to be
[1:46:10] a time to be giving commission
[1:46:13] and a vindication that the people might
[1:46:16] believe him forever
[1:46:19] up to that time the message of the hour
[1:46:23] wasn't perfected listen to me church
[1:46:28] up to that moment
[1:46:30] that the prophet was preaching that says
[1:46:34] is this the time the message of the hour
[1:46:37] wasn't perfected
[1:46:41] i am not one of those who will tell you
[1:46:44] to throw away the messages
[1:46:47] before 1963.
[1:46:50] are you listening to me
[1:46:52] god uses prophet all the time
[1:46:56] but india before 1963
[1:46:59] the prophet said still there were things
[1:47:01] that we guessed art
[1:47:06] amen
[1:47:07] in other words there were things we
[1:47:10] guessed at
[1:47:11] we've not had the absolute truth of it
[1:47:14] [Applause]
[1:47:15] it's not because
[1:47:17] the ministry has problem it's because
[1:47:20] the program of god must run like that
[1:47:24] to bring it to perfection
[1:47:26] and those were the seasons we even
[1:47:29] called the white house rider the lord
[1:47:31] jesus christ
[1:47:33] because in those times we were also
[1:47:35] appealing to the great teachings of
[1:47:37] theologians like uriah smith
[1:47:40] to understand some facts of the bible
[1:47:43] are you catching it amen but it doesn't
[1:47:46] mean there were not many
[1:47:49] blessings that came by inspiration at
[1:47:52] that time but the prophet was an honest
[1:47:55] messenger while he was waiting for the
[1:47:58] truth of many things he said we guessed
[1:48:00] at some things
[1:48:03] which we believe we are so right and
[1:48:05] that was why he said when those angels
[1:48:07] came down
[1:48:09] the things they gave me came better than
[1:48:11] my personal understanding and judgment
[1:48:15] and he said that makes my bible a new
[1:48:18] book in my hand
[1:48:20] we must appreciate that we must realize
[1:48:23] that that the cloud experience is
[1:48:27] important to our redemption
[1:48:30] it's important to our perfection
[1:48:33] is important to bringing us to full
[1:48:36] stature
[1:48:37] because it was by the cloud that we
[1:48:39] received our full resurrection
[1:48:42] what is easter easter is a resurrection
[1:48:45] and the prophet said this easter what it
[1:48:48] means to us is that it is not the easter
[1:48:51] of the groom again
[1:48:53] it is the easter of the blight
[1:48:56] that has been resurrected out of what
[1:48:59] dark dead denominationalism
[1:49:02] into the glorious age
[1:49:06] we have been taken out of the wilderness
[1:49:08] into our inheritance
[1:49:11] into our land of promise into our
[1:49:13] homeland into our spiritual canon which
[1:49:17] is not heaven but the heads
[1:49:22] into the dispensation of the open world
[1:49:26] into the age of the bride
[1:49:29] where we could feed on things that we
[1:49:31] have been given
[1:49:33] by the clouds
[1:49:38] so don't get stuck church of the living
[1:49:40] god
[1:49:41] don't stop there because the prophet
[1:49:43] never stopped there when you say things
[1:49:45] like this it annoys the people
[1:49:48] and you get annoyed maybe because you're
[1:49:49] a generation that must get stalked am i
[1:49:52] not coaching the prophet
[1:49:54] it is the prophet i'm coaching the
[1:49:56] prophet came to a junction in as i was
[1:49:59] with moses is he said either to where we
[1:50:02] have gotten we've gotten to jordan
[1:50:05] amen
[1:50:06] how many ever read that isabel you see
[1:50:09] the inheritance of some people were
[1:50:11] given before jordan
[1:50:13] amen
[1:50:15] two and half tribes got their
[1:50:16] inheritance
[1:50:18] before jordan do you realize that but
[1:50:20] there's a generation that the
[1:50:22] inheritance is across jordan
[1:50:26] amen i am part of that generation
[1:50:29] pentecostal got their blessings before
[1:50:32] jordan because laudacian h is in twofold
[1:50:36] the pentecostal age of laodicea and for
[1:50:39] the believer the blind age of laudacia
[1:50:43] my inheritance is not in that period
[1:50:46] is not in the era of the healing service
[1:50:49] something in me tells me that there is a
[1:50:51] greater blessing
[1:50:53] and that is exactly what he told the
[1:50:55] prophet is that there is something more
[1:50:58] than this
[1:50:59] there is something more than water
[1:51:00] baptism in jesus name
[1:51:02] amen
[1:51:03] amen
[1:51:04] after water baptism if we truly receive
[1:51:07] the spirit it should give an hunger for
[1:51:10] something greater and the prophet says
[1:51:12] something tells me my inheritance is
[1:51:15] across jordan he said as many as feels
[1:51:18] that way come over with me let us cross
[1:51:21] this jordan
[1:51:22] so jordan means death that means we are
[1:51:25] going to pass through the death die to
[1:51:28] the things of the world die to the
[1:51:30] church die to creeds die to dogma and be
[1:51:34] resurrected out of denominationalism
[1:51:37] into the glorious age of the blood of
[1:51:40] jesus christ
[1:51:41] [Music]
[1:51:44] where our opinion no longer counts
[1:51:46] we are our beliefs no longer count it is
[1:51:49] the word and the word alone where we say
[1:51:52] be eaten to me according to your words
[1:51:57] we are every man's word is a lie
[1:52:00] and only the word of god be the truth
[1:52:03] glory to god
[1:52:05] [Applause]
[1:52:06] this is exactly where this brethren were
[1:52:09] in exodus chapter 19.
[1:52:16] in one church
[1:52:18] the lord actually descended
[1:52:21] amen
[1:52:23] the bible said it descended in a world
[1:52:25] thick cloud
[1:52:27] when it descended it descended as a
[1:52:29] pillar of fire
[1:52:31] into the clouds and there were smokes
[1:52:33] everywhere
[1:52:35] there were blastings there were rockings
[1:52:38] everywhere but it didn't consume moses
[1:52:45] moses of 33 bird brahms for 33 years a
[1:52:49] fellowship with a pillar of fire he
[1:52:51] never got used to it
[1:52:53] amen
[1:52:54] every experience leaves him shaken
[1:52:57] amen but it never consumed him
[1:53:01] oh glory to god
[1:53:02] this pillar of our message only consumes
[1:53:05] sin
[1:53:06] it consumes hypocrisy he consumes
[1:53:08] unrighteousness he consumes indifference
[1:53:11] it consumes prejudice it consumes
[1:53:14] complex it comes in fornication it
[1:53:16] consumes adultery it consumes lying it
[1:53:20] consumes all works of the flesh
[1:53:22] it exposes them it drives them out from
[1:53:25] the camp of the believers
[1:53:28] but it attracts holiness
[1:53:30] purity joy
[1:53:32] faith
[1:53:33] long suffering loving kindness
[1:53:36] blessings unspeakable
[1:53:38] [Applause]
[1:53:44] you love him this morning
[1:53:47] so friends
[1:53:48] he actually came down
[1:53:52] and when he came down he told moses
[1:53:56] set boundary
[1:53:58] before he came inside set boundary
[1:54:01] there's a limit to which the five-fold
[1:54:03] goes in this matter
[1:54:05] the people who we attracted to come
[1:54:07] within the range of the boundary were
[1:54:09] not of ordinary people
[1:54:11] they were all priests
[1:54:13] he said tell them to come amen
[1:54:16] and some renowned people
[1:54:18] is about you and aaron come up a bit
[1:54:20] higher because aaron is the high priest
[1:54:23] a type of the lord jesus christ amen so
[1:54:26] figuratively the high priest the lord
[1:54:29] jesus christ is the one that takes moses
[1:54:32] into the cloud of himself
[1:54:34] are you catching it all right
[1:54:37] then moses got to a range he entered
[1:54:40] into the cloud
[1:54:43] what is this cloud experience for
[1:54:47] this is what is important to me
[1:54:51] it was in the cloud
[1:54:53] of exodus 19
[1:54:56] that god gave the message of that hour
[1:55:02] did you hear me
[1:55:04] i better read something here to prove
[1:55:07] that
[1:55:08] to establish that to you
[1:55:11] you love him church
[1:55:14] it was in that cloud
[1:55:17] that the message of that hour came
[1:55:23] the prophet calls
[1:55:25] the message that came from that cloud
[1:55:28] as the seals
[1:55:32] this is what i wanted to be patient to
[1:55:33] read if you can bear with me
[1:55:36] let's read
[1:55:41] in the message the unveiling of god
[1:55:43] paragraph 299
[1:55:46] the unveiling of god 1964
[1:55:48] 14th of june
[1:55:50] the prophet said
[1:55:52] and think of it
[1:55:54] the same pillar of fire that come upon
[1:55:56] those men that wrote the bible
[1:55:58] is the same pillar of fire here today
[1:56:01] inter preaching the bible
[1:56:03] amen
[1:56:05] are we thank him for that same
[1:56:07] what a comfort what identification i'm
[1:56:11] so glad to be identified in that
[1:56:14] i don't know what to do i would rather
[1:56:16] be identified in that than all the
[1:56:19] baptists methodists
[1:56:21] presbyterian lutheran and all the rest
[1:56:25] of them identified in death where the
[1:56:28] shekinah glory
[1:56:30] and revelation lays
[1:56:33] [Applause]
[1:56:34] [Music]
[1:56:35] amen
[1:56:36] the pillar of fire appearing visibly
[1:56:39] among us
[1:56:41] identifying that the message is right
[1:56:44] like it did at mount sinai
[1:56:48] mancine is exodus 19 20
[1:56:52] dear from is that right
[1:56:54] like it did we're on mount sinai
[1:56:58] remember watch this
[1:57:00] before the true message come forth
[1:57:04] moses preached and let them out of egypt
[1:57:10] are you spiritual
[1:57:11] [Applause]
[1:57:13] can you beam it on it
[1:57:15] before the true message
[1:57:18] oh remember
[1:57:21] before the true message come forth
[1:57:24] moses preached
[1:57:26] and he led them out of egypt
[1:57:29] so the message of that exodus hadn't
[1:57:32] come
[1:57:33] when moses led them out of egypt
[1:57:36] what did they leave them by he left them
[1:57:38] by instructions by signs and by wonders
[1:57:43] the healing service
[1:57:47] the first pool
[1:57:49] the second poll
[1:57:51] he brought them hard by each
[1:57:53] amen but certainly those two pools
[1:57:56] cannot take them into the promise and
[1:57:59] keep them in their land of inheritance
[1:58:03] you catch an age
[1:58:04] now listen he said but there
[1:58:07] before the real commandment was laid
[1:58:09] down
[1:58:12] what did he call the real commandment
[1:58:14] the seals was brought in
[1:58:18] so the first exodus at their seals
[1:58:22] oh church
[1:58:24] oh bride of jesus christ
[1:58:27] the first product had their seals
[1:58:30] before the seals was brought down what
[1:58:32] did god do god came down before the
[1:58:35] people
[1:58:36] and proof that moses was sent from him
[1:58:40] isn't that the scripture we have reached
[1:58:43] amen he said behold i come down in what
[1:58:47] thick clouds
[1:58:51] that i may prove you before the people
[1:58:54] and the people might believe you forever
[1:58:58] so you will agree i'm not preaching
[1:58:59] outside of the message of the hour
[1:59:03] are you catching it you must understand
[1:59:05] the program of your own easter
[1:59:08] you must understand the program of your
[1:59:10] own redemption
[1:59:11] amen
[1:59:13] god in the message christ is the mystery
[1:59:15] of god reveal
[1:59:16] the prophet said everything god wanted
[1:59:19] to do he has shown its truth types and
[1:59:22] shadows throughout the entire scriptures
[1:59:25] he said i'm proof that moses was sent
[1:59:28] from him
[1:59:29] in a pillar of fire that moses said he
[1:59:32] had seen in a bush and talked to him
[1:59:35] so that same pillar of fire of exodus 3
[1:59:38] came upon the mountain in a thick cloud
[1:59:42] so moses entered into the cloud to
[1:59:45] fellowship with the pillar of fire
[1:59:47] and what was the product outcome of the
[1:59:50] fellowship the giving of the true
[1:59:52] message
[1:59:53] for that hour
[1:59:55] the seals of that hour that we put
[1:59:58] legitimacy
[2:00:00] to everything
[2:00:02] moses had spoken about
[2:00:04] from the beginning
[2:00:06] till the end
[2:00:07] even beyond moses
[2:00:12] it will make it so true unto them until
[2:00:15] after moses leaves they will keep
[2:00:17] believing it they will keep saying moses
[2:00:20] said that was what joshua couldn't but
[2:00:22] said moses said
[2:00:24] he even divided the land by moses search
[2:00:28] common church
[2:00:30] why you are not with brahms search
[2:00:33] can you ever get into your inheritance
[2:00:36] without brahms saying
[2:00:38] your problem is that you think it was
[2:00:40] the watch of willie abraham
[2:00:42] willem brown was a man
[2:00:44] but god
[2:00:45] god came through him
[2:00:46] evade god to interpret the word the
[2:00:50] interpretation is sure and the message
[2:00:53] it brought is correct
[2:00:56] and it was until it was not until that
[2:00:59] time
[2:01:00] that everything
[2:01:02] mercy said was certified by god
[2:01:07] it was the open seals that satisfied the
[2:01:10] entire message to us
[2:01:12] as the perfect truth
[2:01:15] because when the sins became open
[2:01:17] things we need to pull back upon
[2:01:20] to adjust to correct to put in a better
[2:01:24] light we did
[2:01:26] that is not my watch that is the watch
[2:01:28] of the prophet
[2:01:29] he went back and touched correctly the
[2:01:32] 70 weeks of daniel
[2:01:34] it brought the truth of marriage and
[2:01:36] divorce correctly he went back into the
[2:01:38] for us riders and showed to us that this
[2:01:42] ride that white house rather is not
[2:01:43] christ
[2:01:44] is satan
[2:01:46] in his deceptive form
[2:01:49] [Applause]
[2:01:52] so we need the cloud
[2:01:54] to certify the entire message so that we
[2:01:57] can believe it forever
[2:02:01] so the
[2:02:02] price will not be perfected by signs and
[2:02:05] wonders
[2:02:06] their redemption is not that
[2:02:09] it only attracted them to see what is
[2:02:11] going on when they came around then the
[2:02:14] true message of perfection was given
[2:02:17] and that is why we hold tenaciously
[2:02:19] today
[2:02:20] to what the word says
[2:02:23] it might be instruction it might be
[2:02:25] cancer even if it's an advice
[2:02:29] [Music]
[2:02:32] everything paul said
[2:02:34] he told the church is that all scripture
[2:02:37] was given
[2:02:38] by watch by inspiration
[2:02:41] and it's profitable
[2:02:43] amen including that which paul said this
[2:02:46] is i not the lord
[2:02:47] it form part of our scripture if any man
[2:02:50] took it for his opinion and disobeyed it
[2:02:53] oh god you will incur the wrath of god
[2:02:56] so whether it's a decision not the lord
[2:02:59] or he said that which i received from
[2:03:01] the lord it form part of all scripture
[2:03:06] that supersede your opinion that
[2:03:08] supersede your belief that you must
[2:03:11] accept it that you must accept because
[2:03:14] moses was vindicated by god to be
[2:03:17] believed forever
[2:03:19] [Applause]
[2:03:20] if that was what happened in the first
[2:03:22] exodus let's see our exodus
[2:03:24] you are happy you didn't take offense
[2:03:26] with the first one don't take offense
[2:03:29] with the last one
[2:03:30] you are the generation that will not
[2:03:32] take offense
[2:03:34] because you are not prone to offense
[2:03:37] you are prone to believing blessed are
[2:03:39] those who are not offended
[2:03:45] have i shown you a pattern
[2:03:47] have i shown you the program of god have
[2:03:49] i proven from the scripture
[2:03:51] as a prophet gradually not be bringing
[2:03:53] it to our day let's follow him he told
[2:03:56] us that what moses got
[2:03:58] the true message he got after a mighty
[2:04:01] revival was what
[2:04:04] was the seals
[2:04:05] and that seals were the ten commandments
[2:04:08] and the expansion of it into over 600
[2:04:12] ordinances and statutes
[2:04:16] do you know even the building of the
[2:04:18] tabernacle this specification they were
[2:04:21] all given in that fellowship
[2:04:23] moses never came down until 40 years
[2:04:25] brethren 40 days brethren so it wasn't a
[2:04:28] small time fellowship
[2:04:30] it was a real fellowship without food
[2:04:32] without water being taken care of
[2:04:35] supernaturally
[2:04:36] in the realms of glory bride we are no
[2:04:39] man we are not fivefold could approach
[2:04:41] untrue
[2:04:45] [Applause]
[2:04:48] you love him
[2:04:50] then here we come
[2:04:52] in this last exodus
[2:04:54] which was to be the substance
[2:04:57] the great signs and wonders and
[2:04:59] supernaturals
[2:05:01] have also taken us far until 1962.
[2:05:06] glory to god
[2:05:08] somewhere around 1962
[2:05:11] the god told the prophet by a vision to
[2:05:13] forewarn the church because he saw a
[2:05:16] vision of a blast that's what says is
[2:05:18] the time was all about
[2:05:20] the prophet left it finished that
[2:05:22] message presuming he couldn't bring you
[2:05:25] exactly
[2:05:27] what the blast means
[2:05:29] he gave many postulations
[2:05:32] but you see if god gives a sound it's
[2:05:34] got to be certain
[2:05:37] amen
[2:05:38] so all that taught the prophet was to
[2:05:40] wait for god's appointed time
[2:05:43] when he will reveal the certainty of all
[2:05:46] that he had seen
[2:05:47] you love him
[2:05:49] then in february 1963
[2:05:52] four to six months later
[2:05:56] just what he saw in the vision
[2:06:00] like in picking a boss from all of his
[2:06:02] trousers
[2:06:04] before witnesses like genuine and fred
[2:06:07] sotman if i have the names right
[2:06:10] amen fred suttman if i have their names
[2:06:13] right
[2:06:15] then he saw circling
[2:06:19] some white something circling down
[2:06:22] and they turned out to be angels
[2:06:26] amen
[2:06:28] february 1963
[2:06:30] you can even i'm going to read few
[2:06:32] things about that cloud
[2:06:34] it is important i do
[2:06:36] because
[2:06:37] if the cloud
[2:06:39] that god came down
[2:06:42] god's intention by it was to make people
[2:06:45] believe moses forever
[2:06:48] then we must certify that the cloud that
[2:06:50] we receive is genuine
[2:06:53] otherwise our soul
[2:06:55] and our life lang hangs in the balance
[2:06:59] because today
[2:07:01] we see a lot of generation of people
[2:07:05] generation of mixed multitudes i have no
[2:07:08] apology for saying that
[2:07:11] that are coming up
[2:07:13] with contradictions battling at
[2:07:18] the mystery cloud
[2:07:21] i want to take the battle back to them
[2:07:23] this morning
[2:07:24] [Music]
[2:07:25] but we are not going to be vulgar
[2:07:28] we'll prove it with facts
[2:07:30] i've taken it from scriptural points
[2:07:32] tracing it for you church
[2:07:34] is that right
[2:07:36] do i have the witness
[2:07:37] that we have seen it from the scripture
[2:07:40] and do i have the witness
[2:07:42] that the prophet is beginning to connect
[2:07:44] it
[2:07:45] to what happened in our day
[2:07:47] is that moses brought them that far
[2:07:49] but the true message that will take care
[2:07:51] of them in that exodus hasn't been given
[2:07:54] yet
[2:07:55] oh glory to god and they call that
[2:07:57] message the seals
[2:08:00] my goodness
[2:08:01] how else could the world be this plane
[2:08:06] he called it the seals so the first
[2:08:08] exodus had their sales
[2:08:10] that took care of them in the journey
[2:08:12] that showed them the tabernacle
[2:08:14] specification you aren't going to come
[2:08:16] to full stature today in this spiritual
[2:08:19] temple god is building without the seals
[2:08:23] the earlier you start embracing the
[2:08:25] messages
[2:08:27] that came out of the experience of the
[2:08:29] seals the better it is for your life
[2:08:33] your stature is not what you are going
[2:08:34] to walk yourself into
[2:08:36] your stature is a message
[2:08:39] the prophet in the message touch of a
[2:08:40] perfect man he said when he say heart he
[2:08:43] doesn't mean it like literally like that
[2:08:45] it's a quotation the addition is you
[2:08:48] taking more of the wage and more of the
[2:08:50] world begin to blossom in your life this
[2:08:53] is your easter church of the living god
[2:08:58] what we release the materials is the
[2:09:01] seals
[2:09:02] amen so instead of looking for materials
[2:09:06] look for the seals
[2:09:08] when you see what the seals unfolded
[2:09:10] into and you embracing the revelation
[2:09:13] that came out of the seals automatically
[2:09:15] the material is building in your life
[2:09:20] church
[2:09:21] the program couldn't be more planar
[2:09:24] from the commandments that was given
[2:09:27] came several ordinances and statutes
[2:09:30] there are from their experience came the
[2:09:32] building of the tabernacle in the
[2:09:34] wilderness came all the specification
[2:09:37] came even the specification of the
[2:09:39] levites and the levitical orders and the
[2:09:42] priesthood even to their government to
[2:09:44] their services and to their offerings
[2:09:47] one encounter moses got everything
[2:09:49] complete
[2:09:50] before it came back
[2:09:53] that the people might believe in what
[2:09:56] forever so everybody adds their portion
[2:09:59] so this encounter of the prophet with
[2:10:01] the cloud is important for us because
[2:10:04] india leaves everything
[2:10:06] complete to put perfection on the
[2:10:09] messages before them and what we will do
[2:10:12] after then
[2:10:13] [Applause]
[2:10:15] [Music]
[2:10:19] so what did you see
[2:10:21] it's a seven ninjas came down while in
[2:10:24] that circle like a light
[2:10:26] and when they came down they took him up
[2:10:30] in the pyramid of themselves
[2:10:32] amen
[2:10:33] because it was high up
[2:10:35] that moses got the revelation from
[2:10:38] so they took him the prophet said the
[2:10:41] revelation of the word only known to
[2:10:43] them
[2:10:44] so is god of fellowship in the midst of
[2:10:47] those angels
[2:10:49] in order to get the words
[2:10:52] the message
[2:10:53] the true message as the bible said for
[2:10:56] that hour
[2:10:58] in our own exodus
[2:11:00] [Music]
[2:11:03] and this was i
[2:11:04] when they brought him back after the
[2:11:06] encounter how long it was i don't know
[2:11:10] they brought him back with the church to
[2:11:12] go back where
[2:11:13] east
[2:11:15] he was in the west arizona where he had
[2:11:18] that experience they said go back it's
[2:11:21] jeffersonville to go and declare a new
[2:11:23] day
[2:11:26] and he went back and for seven nights
[2:11:30] he was having angelic visitation to do
[2:11:32] what to open the seals
[2:11:38] which you get the church of the living
[2:11:39] god
[2:11:40] that was what is edge
[2:11:43] that was what happened
[2:11:46] and this experience came out of where
[2:11:49] it came out of the cloud
[2:11:53] when these angels were going back
[2:11:57] they formed a cloud
[2:12:00] a ring of mystery
[2:12:02] let me read
[2:12:04] what people said
[2:12:06] this is not message of the hour
[2:12:09] this was which you can google yourself
[2:12:12] this was an account
[2:12:15] amen
[2:12:17] of witnesses that have been passed down
[2:12:19] from generation to generation
[2:12:22] i have the original look magazine
[2:12:25] that carried this may 17 19 edition of
[2:12:28] 1963 i have it in my house
[2:12:31] the original magazine that carried that
[2:12:34] event
[2:12:35] now i was going through
[2:12:37] such google or what you call it
[2:12:40] to even see
[2:12:41] if in the internet
[2:12:44] if on the search
[2:12:46] i would see anything like that so i
[2:12:48] searched mystery cloud in history
[2:12:52] and they brought out ten
[2:12:54] and out of the ten this one was number
[2:12:57] five on number six
[2:12:59] in the ascending what you call it indeed
[2:13:02] in the order of events that has happened
[2:13:05] and this is what they said about the
[2:13:06] ring of mystery
[2:13:09] in the closing hours of february
[2:13:12] you can go through this in the
[2:13:14] wonderlist wonderlist.com it is not a
[2:13:17] message website
[2:13:19] amen
[2:13:20] it is just
[2:13:22] people who are gathering facts
[2:13:24] of history
[2:13:25] they said in the closing hours
[2:13:28] of february 1963
[2:13:30] the residents of arizona are reported to
[2:13:33] have seen a mysterious cloud formations
[2:13:36] that in scientific time
[2:13:39] defied all rational explanation
[2:13:45] [Music]
[2:13:46] i'm coming for backsliders
[2:13:49] who are attacking this cloud but i told
[2:13:51] you i will bring my case in the most
[2:13:55] humble only way
[2:13:57] we are not going to go vulgar
[2:13:59] like they have done
[2:14:00] we are not of the same material
[2:14:03] but no amount of vulgarity and attack
[2:14:06] can take this blessing from us
[2:14:09] every article of redemption in every
[2:14:12] exodus had always come under attack
[2:14:16] they attacked the red sea
[2:14:18] they said it never happened it was just
[2:14:21] a dry land a bunch of reeds that moses
[2:14:24] you know took people through friends
[2:14:26] they attacked
[2:14:28] they attacked uh
[2:14:30] they also attacked once again they also
[2:14:32] attacked the virgin birth
[2:14:34] of jesus christ they said it was not
[2:14:37] virgin born the day they attacked that
[2:14:40] and 500 preachers
[2:14:42] denied virgin birth it wouldn't change
[2:14:44] my position on virgin birth
[2:14:47] if you take the red sea out of the
[2:14:49] experience of the fair excess with us
[2:14:51] that means they never came out there was
[2:14:54] no redemption
[2:14:55] if you take the clouds out of that
[2:14:57] experience that means they never entered
[2:14:59] into anywhere else because nothing to
[2:15:02] take care of them so if you take the
[2:15:04] virgin birth out of redemption in the
[2:15:07] second exodus no redemption for you no
[2:15:10] redemption for me if you take the clouds
[2:15:12] out of these last days it shows we are
[2:15:15] not better than denominations but it was
[2:15:17] from the cloud that we received the
[2:15:19] message that separated us
[2:15:22] as a peculiar treasure as a holy people
[2:15:25] that proved to us that we are the jin
[2:15:28] siege father spiritual gene
[2:15:31] that gave us the open word you can't
[2:15:33] take it from us regardless of what you
[2:15:36] say thank you for putting it on the
[2:15:38] board let's read it together this is not
[2:15:40] message people this is just ordinary
[2:15:43] people gathering fact of history this
[2:15:46] archaeology work amen we are not
[2:15:49] following the conley device people
[2:15:51] church of the living god if you are
[2:15:53] still having doubts and the message
[2:15:55] having come this far there is little
[2:15:57] hope for you
[2:15:59] listen to me he said divide all rational
[2:16:03] explanation
[2:16:05] [Music]
[2:16:08] the cloud was reported to be 48
[2:16:11] kilometers
[2:16:13] that is 30 miles across white it was
[2:16:17] such a large that was why it stretches
[2:16:20] from tucson to phoenix into mexico
[2:16:26] that was how why they could see it from
[2:16:27] mexico because it was so high also so
[2:16:30] why i'm 41 kilometer 26 miles high in
[2:16:35] the bright dark cloudless sky
[2:16:38] according to witness the clouds suddenly
[2:16:42] appeared to have been drawn by an unseen
[2:16:44] entity
[2:16:46] [Music]
[2:16:50] hey i'm coming for you backsliders
[2:16:53] who are saying this is the smoke of
[2:16:55] aeroplane
[2:16:57] i'm going to prove it by science and i'm
[2:16:59] going to prove it by fact of history
[2:17:03] just give me a few minutes by fact of
[2:17:05] history
[2:17:07] that you are a liar you are a backslider
[2:17:10] and you are a blasphemer
[2:17:13] [Music]
[2:17:16] don't keep company with these folks
[2:17:19] unless you partake in their sin
[2:17:22] some of you are having sympathy for them
[2:17:24] for whatever reason don't be a partaker
[2:17:27] of their sin
[2:17:28] let their sin be only upon their head
[2:17:31] let me say one thing categorically clear
[2:17:36] brother the lord jesus said i did things
[2:17:39] and you call it beautiful he said i will
[2:17:42] forgive you for it
[2:17:44] he said but the spirit of truth
[2:17:47] when he returns in the last days
[2:17:50] and he do it does things
[2:17:52] one word against age
[2:17:54] will never be forgiven
[2:17:56] on this earth or in the world to come
[2:18:00] those of you who entered into the
[2:18:02] military
[2:18:03] and think that your ministry can only
[2:18:05] survive by attacking the prophet or the
[2:18:08] message of the hour oh
[2:18:10] i i pity your ministry
[2:18:13] i pity you
[2:18:15] oh i feel for you i feel for your
[2:18:16] destruction
[2:18:18] because it will come i'm not crossing
[2:18:21] i'm speaking the truth every i do watch
[2:18:25] the bible said against the spirit will
[2:18:27] not be forgiven
[2:18:29] be very very careful who you accompany
[2:18:32] with who you keep friendship with
[2:18:34] friendship must not be at all cause
[2:18:37] are you listening to me
[2:18:39] cause behind the friendship where the
[2:18:41] word of god is at stake
[2:18:45] [Applause]
[2:18:47] [Music]
[2:18:47] [Applause]
[2:18:52] these are ordinary men
[2:18:54] testifying
[2:18:55] these are not christians
[2:18:58] they said according to witnesses
[2:19:01] people who saw that thing they said the
[2:19:03] cloud suddenly appeared
[2:19:06] to have been drawn by an unseen entity
[2:19:09] so it wasn't like a graduate
[2:19:13] and it's forming
[2:19:15] could only seven ninjas have done that
[2:19:19] did you catch that
[2:19:20] all of a sudden they just saw it
[2:19:24] oh glory by an unseen entity and was
[2:19:27] visible
[2:19:29] for several minutes
[2:19:31] smoke
[2:19:32] disappears smoke have no retention
[2:19:37] smoke are like vapor
[2:19:39] they move away very fast
[2:19:42] hallelujah
[2:19:44] but this one stayed
[2:19:46] so it formed for several minutes to
[2:19:50] leave a witness to this art that god
[2:19:53] came
[2:19:54] in the thickness of a cloud
[2:19:58] to prove his messenger
[2:20:00] that we might believe what he brought
[2:20:02] forever
[2:20:04] as john the baptist
[2:20:05] was sent to forum
[2:20:07] the first coming of christ you are sent
[2:20:10] with a message
[2:20:11] that we for on his second coming
[2:20:14] until he physically
[2:20:16] appears in the sky to take his children
[2:20:19] home we must believe the message
[2:20:22] forever
[2:20:24] [Applause]
[2:20:30] listen
[2:20:31] courier citizens immediately
[2:20:34] flooded the university of arizona
[2:20:37] institute of atmospheric physics
[2:20:40] for answers
[2:20:42] but the scientists were amateurs as well
[2:20:47] [Applause]
[2:20:49] didn't the prophet said they were
[2:20:50] looking for answers
[2:20:52] did you not read it on the pages of the
[2:20:54] message
[2:20:55] so did the prophet tell a lie
[2:20:57] he told the truth
[2:20:59] amen
[2:21:00] if he said this way if he said that way
[2:21:02] it was intentional
[2:21:04] in order to take care of those who are
[2:21:06] prone to offence
[2:21:07] but the believers are not prone to
[2:21:09] offence
[2:21:10] some people we are saying he said it was
[2:21:13] there on that day when it appeared why
[2:21:16] and it was not there the first public
[2:21:18] comment of the prophet
[2:21:20] on this thing
[2:21:21] message of come follow me is a distance
[2:21:25] upon either two days before or two days
[2:21:28] after i was there
[2:21:30] then in the standing of the gap when he
[2:21:33] has done his research to know when he
[2:21:35] said these things happened when the
[2:21:38] angels who came down we are going back
[2:21:44] how long it took them to go back and
[2:21:46] flood that thing and keep their
[2:21:48] visibility
[2:21:50] it's up to him
[2:21:52] amen what is that right under where that
[2:21:55] thing appeared was where we were two
[2:21:57] days before
[2:21:59] so where did this say that it was there
[2:22:01] when it was happening
[2:22:03] it is the way you were reading it
[2:22:06] you never read with revelation i
[2:22:08] challenge you to bring it where he said
[2:22:10] so
[2:22:11] he said i was under it amen
[2:22:14] under it meaning we are nothing up here
[2:22:16] when they draw the geographical location
[2:22:19] of where the prophet stood with the
[2:22:21] angels it was right under it
[2:22:24] but you see if you have prone to offense
[2:22:27] and if you are pro to contention every
[2:22:29] little little thing got that momentum
[2:22:31] for you
[2:22:32] he said this it does this it because you
[2:22:35] are just looking for fault
[2:22:38] you are seeking location many of you
[2:22:40] have contentious spirits it's a demon
[2:22:44] you pick at words the prophet said take
[2:22:47] me for what i mean not sometimes what i
[2:22:50] say it's still a quotation of the wage
[2:22:55] [Music]
[2:22:55] [Applause]
[2:22:57] but this is another thing that intrigued
[2:22:59] me
[2:23:01] the article writer said unsurprisingly
[2:23:05] in other words without surprise a tele
[2:23:08] evangelist called
[2:23:10] and confessed to have been visited by
[2:23:12] seven angels
[2:23:14] who made the cloud as they flew back
[2:23:18] to their heavenly approach
[2:23:20] did you hear that
[2:23:22] amen
[2:23:24] because they couldn't explain
[2:23:27] amen
[2:23:28] the rate
[2:23:30] at which this thing formed
[2:23:32] because they couldn't explain
[2:23:34] the height at which this thing is
[2:23:37] they couldn't explain the whiteness of
[2:23:40] this thing it was beyond scientific
[2:23:42] explanation
[2:23:44] when somebody now offered a clue they
[2:23:46] said they are not surprised in other
[2:23:48] words they accepted it as a supernatural
[2:23:52] occurrence
[2:23:54] we are in backsliders
[2:24:01] i am not done yet
[2:24:05] amen
[2:24:06] i am not done yes
[2:24:08] i want to bring another one
[2:24:10] they told you
[2:24:12] some of you dock your hedge on the
[2:24:13] internet
[2:24:15] they told you you see
[2:24:17] he said i'm trying to listen to many
[2:24:20] so that i can take my opinion let me
[2:24:22] tell you who are the people
[2:24:24] to form an opinion on the prophet for
[2:24:26] you
[2:24:29] who is the backslider that we form an
[2:24:31] opinion
[2:24:33] on the prophet
[2:24:35] are you okay
[2:24:38] what is their call
[2:24:40] what is your vindication
[2:24:43] why are you touched on through
[2:24:46] why isn't there anything that's settled
[2:24:48] it for you
[2:24:50] amen
[2:24:51] could it be the messenger wasn't sent to
[2:24:53] you
[2:24:55] so doesn't vote for whom he sends they
[2:24:58] don't doubt
[2:25:00] they don't look for anybody to validate
[2:25:02] the prophets
[2:25:03] no no no no no no no no no no no
[2:25:06] the validation of the prophet comes from
[2:25:09] god and i'm showing you his validation
[2:25:12] even in exodus 19 the prophet said
[2:25:14] throughout the entire bible i can show
[2:25:16] you the seventh seal
[2:25:18] here is it brethren
[2:25:23] i've debunked it for you he never said
[2:25:25] it was there the same day they took the
[2:25:27] picture i've debunked that for you
[2:25:29] say that two days before two days after
[2:25:31] first public comment later on it said it
[2:25:34] was the angels
[2:25:37] that formed when they were going back
[2:25:39] after their message
[2:25:42] amen to which
[2:25:44] to which wonderlist.com
[2:25:47] amen
[2:25:48] history researchers attested to
[2:25:51] they said the tele evangelists
[2:25:54] said this was what happened they are not
[2:25:55] surprised
[2:25:57] because that event was too supernatural
[2:26:00] for it to have any other explanation
[2:26:03] apart from that science couldn't explain
[2:26:06] it think about that for a minute
[2:26:08] then latter day backsliders are coming
[2:26:11] to tell you it is a smoke of aeroplane i
[2:26:14] want to bring another fact
[2:26:16] when they cut this morning
[2:26:21] hallelujah how many enjoy in this court
[2:26:23] session
[2:26:26] i'm bringing another fact
[2:26:28] now this is from time magazine
[2:26:32] for me to have a position because if the
[2:26:35] prophet told me
[2:26:36] that i'm in exodus 19
[2:26:39] amen that's exactly what he was saying
[2:26:42] that i'm in exodus 19 by the mystery
[2:26:44] cloud
[2:26:45] then i must be sure
[2:26:47] what came out of there i could put my
[2:26:49] life my entire bet on it
[2:26:52] now backsliders have come
[2:26:55] to tell us that it is the smoke of
[2:26:57] aeroplanes
[2:26:59] is that right
[2:27:00] whereas in the message the prophet said
[2:27:03] it was beyond the height of aeroplane
[2:27:06] how many ever read it in the message he
[2:27:09] said it was beyond the height of where a
[2:27:10] plane could fly
[2:27:13] and even till today i want to proceed
[2:27:16] i want to submit that it is still beyond
[2:27:19] the height of aeroplane
[2:27:21] despite our advancements
[2:27:24] i went back to do a research
[2:27:28] how i do planes actually fly in the 50s
[2:27:36] and here is what i found
[2:27:40] i would like to read a little
[2:27:42] amen
[2:27:49] oh we have to enjoy this a little
[2:27:52] over 42 000 planes take flight in the
[2:27:54] u.s every day
[2:27:57] with 5000 in the sky at any given time
[2:28:00] according to the federal aviation
[2:28:02] administration coordinating the many
[2:28:05] arrivals departures and okay
[2:28:08] here is what to know about how i plane
[2:28:11] really fly
[2:28:13] listen to this church
[2:28:15] one reason that planes cruise above the
[2:28:18] clouds is so they can fly fast
[2:28:21] the higher airplanes climb the thinner
[2:28:25] the air gets
[2:28:27] and the more efficiently they can fly
[2:28:30] because of less resistance in the
[2:28:32] atmosphere
[2:28:34] with these larger jets
[2:28:37] when they take off from the airport
[2:28:40] their first job is essentially to get
[2:28:42] out and get as high as possible
[2:28:45] as quickly as possible
[2:28:48] commercial aircraft typically typically
[2:28:51] fly between 31 000
[2:28:54] to 28 000 feet today
[2:28:58] those of you who have bordered planes
[2:28:59] traveling overseas can attest to that
[2:29:02] they don't go past that
[2:29:04] and that is just about 5.9 to 7.2 miles
[2:29:14] today
[2:29:16] i and usually reach their cruising
[2:29:18] altitude
[2:29:19] in the first 10 minutes of a flight
[2:29:22] a cut of a flight planes can fly much
[2:29:25] higher than this altitude
[2:29:28] but
[2:29:28] that can present safety issues
[2:29:32] flying aya means it will take a long
[2:29:34] time to return to a self-altitude in
[2:29:38] case of an emergency
[2:29:40] like rapid decompression it also isn't
[2:29:43] the most efficient use of well to fly
[2:29:46] that eye in the first place he said
[2:29:48] since planes can fly at a lower altitude
[2:29:52] with the assistance of wind are we
[2:29:54] together
[2:29:55] i want you to continue
[2:29:57] reading that later i will give you
[2:29:59] decide i want to see in 1958
[2:30:06] they told us in the 50s
[2:30:08] that planes don't fly
[2:30:11] beyond 19 000 feet
[2:30:14] which is less than four miles
[2:30:21] history said so
[2:30:24] that it was in 1958 they introduced jet
[2:30:27] and concord
[2:30:28] who could fly a little higher than that
[2:30:31] and they don't go past 38 000 feet
[2:30:36] they haven't shown up in history
[2:30:39] which one went past 40 000
[2:30:42] except you are doing rocket launching or
[2:30:44] something like that are you here with me
[2:30:48] now
[2:30:49] for a smoke
[2:30:52] to form today
[2:30:54] it will form around 38 000 feet
[2:30:59] which is like
[2:31:01] 7.2 miles
[2:31:04] of line
[2:31:05] but do you know what they said we had
[2:31:07] this the height of this cloud
[2:31:10] 26 miles i
[2:31:14] the cloud was higher
[2:31:17] than the height of a plane by about four
[2:31:20] times
[2:31:21] that is about 123
[2:31:23] 000 feet
[2:31:27] so where will it become a smoke
[2:31:30] of an aeroplane
[2:31:32] and even at this time we are saying
[2:31:36] is researched as that before 1958
[2:31:40] no plane flies higher than nineteen
[2:31:42] thousand feet
[2:31:44] which is less than four miles
[2:31:48] but the cloud formed at 26 miles eye
[2:31:52] do you see why science said they become
[2:31:55] and they became an amateur to explain
[2:31:58] what happened
[2:31:59] they found no answers
[2:32:01] it defied all logic
[2:32:05] so can you get it out of your head
[2:32:08] backsliders and blasphemous
[2:32:10] that this cloud i'm seeing here is not a
[2:32:14] smoke of an airplane
[2:32:17] the smoke cannot set
[2:32:19] and retain itself on the same spot
[2:32:23] in thickness for several minutes
[2:32:27] it is your box living condition
[2:32:30] inspired by satan
[2:32:32] in your heart
[2:32:33] amen that makes you talk ill
[2:32:36] of a god-given vindication
[2:32:39] to prove his servant forever that we
[2:32:42] might believe the words
[2:32:43] that he gave forever
[2:32:46] [Applause]
[2:32:46] [Music]
[2:32:50] but we see every falsehood we have
[2:32:52] sympathizers
[2:32:53] god has allowed us to take care of some
[2:32:55] people
[2:32:56] but not us
[2:32:58] [Music]
[2:32:58] [Applause]
[2:33:00] no matter the level of opposition
[2:33:03] the believer is moving on
[2:33:06] the prophet foretold it before it
[2:33:08] happened
[2:33:09] amen
[2:33:10] god won the church we saw the warning in
[2:33:13] exodus 19
[2:33:14] so as to prepare for the event amen and
[2:33:17] the prophet said the events they were
[2:33:20] being worked for is to bring the true
[2:33:22] message of that exodus
[2:33:25] and from the cloud came the ten
[2:33:26] commandments
[2:33:28] came the ordinances six hundred and
[2:33:30] something ordinances from the cloud came
[2:33:32] the levitical orders from the cloud came
[2:33:36] the specification of the tabernacle the
[2:33:38] building plan and all the materials that
[2:33:40] we go into it to build a total message
[2:33:45] for a perfect exodus thanks be to god
[2:33:50] let's see what came back from the clouds
[2:33:53] let's see what came up from this cloud
[2:33:55] that they are trying to deny us off are
[2:33:58] you ready to see what came out from the
[2:33:59] cloud
[2:34:01] you will see why the devil is fighting
[2:34:02] the clouds
[2:34:04] and why the people are yielding
[2:34:05] themselves
[2:34:06] amen
[2:34:07] as a servant to satan
[2:34:10] amen
[2:34:12] you love the lord
[2:34:14] you love the lord
[2:34:16] if you love him
[2:34:18] rejoice in him
[2:34:21] oh glory to god
[2:34:22] [Applause]
[2:34:24] in the message that third eggs with us
[2:34:27] let's start from here i'm winding down
[2:34:29] now but you must get this
[2:34:31] amen in the message he told exodus
[2:34:36] the prophet said paragraph 265
[2:34:39] the second exodus he brought a prophet
[2:34:42] anointage which was his son god prophet
[2:34:46] moses said he would be a prophet
[2:34:49] and hurt the pillar of fire and done
[2:34:51] signs and wonders
[2:34:53] and that same prophet said whosoever
[2:34:56] believeth in me
[2:34:57] the works that i do will he do also
[2:35:01] and here he promised the same thing in
[2:35:04] the exodus in the last days and they
[2:35:06] cannot change it and by scientific proof
[2:35:10] by the witness of the spirit
[2:35:13] by the works of the spirit
[2:35:15] we see it today
[2:35:17] the great pillar of fire moving among us
[2:35:20] and the signs and wonders and of the
[2:35:23] resurrection of jesus christ calling the
[2:35:25] people from denominationalism
[2:35:28] into the presence of jesus christ

[2:35:34] no mistake friends amen
[2:35:37] it's not what i'm saying i'm just your
[2:35:39] brother but it's what god is proving to
[2:35:42] you
[2:35:42] what makes it the truth same pillar of
[2:35:45] fire he used for the other two is
[2:35:48] brought it among you today and prove it
[2:35:51] by scientific
[2:35:52] as you know life magazine
[2:35:56] packed it last month over there how many
[2:35:58] was there and heard me tell about that
[2:36:02] what happened before it did i think
[2:36:04] about everyone in the church there it is
[2:36:07] is coming to the cloud again
[2:36:09] they don't know what it is all about
[2:36:12] the science are trying to did we read it
[2:36:14] now did we read their research amen
[2:36:17] anybody got a picture of it
[2:36:20] according a cloud we have it here
[2:36:22] 26 miles yeah i
[2:36:25] in the shape of a pyramid

[2:36:41] just as they brought moses the seals
[2:36:44] for his own day
[2:36:46] under the inspiration
[2:36:48] he tells you these hours that you are
[2:36:50] coming and living in this spiritual mind

[2:36:57] is it it is on
[2:37:00] it is an
[2:37:02] so what called out our exodus
[2:37:04] the ring of mystery
[2:37:07] god came down in a thick cloud to give
[2:37:10] us the message of exodus the prophet

[2:38:14] judgment we know all the wars and the
[2:38:16] epidemics and the pandemics we are
[2:38:19] loosed under the sixth seal
[2:38:21] and all the calamities that are
[2:38:22] befalling man came under the sixth seal
[2:38:25] then he also told us the seventh seal
[2:38:28] and he said the fault of it is the seven
[2:38:30] thunders so the seven thunders
[2:38:32] revelation came out of where came out of
[2:38:35] the thick cloud
[2:38:38] divinely revealed mystery truth
[2:38:41] that we do a literal work of changing us
[2:38:44] let us see the unfolding contents
[2:38:46] amen i've given part of the content let
[2:38:49] the prophet give the rest
[2:38:51] okay why they are looking for that
[2:38:53] paragraph one sum of the six this day
[2:38:55] the scripture is fulfilled
[2:38:57] he said that morning
[2:38:59] when those seven angels come down
[2:39:02] amen and blasted the earth
[2:39:06] did they bless the earth
[2:39:08] they blasted the earth amen
[2:39:11] and rocks flew everywhere
[2:39:14] just exactly as it happened in exodus
[2:39:16] 19.
[2:39:17] you know when it happened in exodus 19
[2:39:20] do you know god achieved his name do you
[2:39:22] know what the people said after the
[2:39:24] encounter
[2:39:25] they said god don't speak to us
[2:39:28] is that right
[2:39:29] church are we together
[2:39:31] the saints in the world he said they
[2:39:34] said god don't speak to us directly
[2:39:37] let moses speak to us
[2:39:39] because they found the voltage too high
[2:39:42] for them to absorb
[2:39:44] and any voltage that comes from a power
[2:39:46] generation center is always too high
[2:39:50] for any man to absorb are you following
[2:39:53] me this is why they give you
[2:39:55] transformers
[2:39:56] on your streets or in your houses in
[2:39:59] other words the transformer absorbs the
[2:40:01] voltage
[2:40:02] and steps it down and begin to regulate
[2:40:05] it and give it in the content that you
[2:40:08] are able to receive
[2:40:10] that transformer is the messenger of the
[2:40:12] howard the prophet of god who absorbed
[2:40:16] of the energy of the voltage who kept
[2:40:18] some truth until you arrived to receive
[2:40:21] it he knew marriage and divorce two
[2:40:24] years before he preached it he said if
[2:40:26] we preach it earlier it will it will
[2:40:29] destroy it with scatter
[2:40:30] god keep those things in that attend
[2:40:32] vessel and they preserve it there until
[2:40:35] the people have matured
[2:40:38] to be able to accept it
[2:40:40] we thank god for our transformer
[2:40:42] that is given in to us in regulated
[2:40:45] content so that our houses our temple is
[2:40:49] not destroyed by what was sent
[2:40:52] to redeem you and her
[2:40:55] the people never wanted to hear god
[2:40:57] directly again
[2:40:58] they said let god speak only to moses
[2:41:01] and you moses speak to us what was god's
[2:41:04] intention to achieve that he said that
[2:41:07] they might listen to you
[2:41:09] and hear you forever
[2:41:14] that money when those seven ninjas come
[2:41:16] down and blasted the earth and rock flew
[2:41:19] every way seven ninjas two there and
[2:41:22] said return back to jeffersonville

[2:41:50] seals
[2:41:51] here we are today
[2:41:53] understanding seven seals in few days if
[2:41:56] god willing we will understand the
[2:41:58] correctness
[2:41:59] of marriage and divorce
[2:42:01] things you need to teach the church to
[2:42:04] place it positionally not by your touch
[2:42:07] your church tradition objection or sense
[2:42:10] but by the revealed world to build a
[2:42:12] total church a total people who will
[2:42:15] know how to approach every situation but
[2:42:18] the council of the world you are
[2:42:20] ignoring that and chasing shadows you
[2:42:23] ain't going to walk anybody up to come
[2:42:25] to full stature these are the things
[2:42:28] that we bring them to that statue
[2:42:30] the supernatural ingredients

[2:43:31] opened

[2:44:33] to a position of hearing him
[2:44:37] that they might believe him for
[2:44:39] [Applause]
[2:44:41] did he do that to our lord jesus christ
[2:44:43] in the second exodus in the third exodus
[2:44:46] it must be the same thing
[2:44:48] so what was taking place among sunsets
[2:44:50] another abduction

[2:45:04] peter james and john is the prophet
[2:45:06] saying it himself don't be skeptical
[2:45:09] accept the review word
[2:45:11] forgive witness stood there and watched
[2:45:14] it when it happened and seen it done
[2:45:17] there it is hanging in the sky
[2:45:20] you see it again
[2:45:22] so far there is no humidity
[2:45:25] no moisture or nothing to make a fog
[2:45:29] how could they come there
[2:45:31] it was the angels of god
[2:45:33] returning back after their message
[2:45:41] this day that prophecy
[2:45:43] has been fulfilled in our midst this day
[2:45:46] this scripture has been fulfilled watch
[2:45:49] seven seals has been opened
[2:45:53] the one wind is to the west coast now
[2:45:56] don't miss it
[2:45:57] like they did back yonder don't miss it
[2:46:00] like they did back yonder do you know
[2:46:02] god also vindicated this not by just the
[2:46:05] vision of the blast in sas is this the
[2:46:08] time he also vindicated it by junior
[2:46:10] jackson's dream
[2:46:12] some say he didn't have the dream some
[2:46:15] say he didn't how why did you wait for
[2:46:17] junior jackson to pass away before you
[2:46:19] start speaking nonsense
[2:46:21] where was junior jackson when the
[2:46:23] prophet was referring to him
[2:46:25] or are there all rebellious
[2:46:27] collaborators or forcefuls
[2:46:30] oh you are a backslider
[2:46:32] for speaking tomiroz
[2:46:35] for speaking nonsense
[2:46:41] you are filling up the cup of your
[2:46:42] fathers
[2:46:44] generation of mixed multitudes
[2:46:46] hallelujah
[2:46:48] i close with junior jackson
[2:46:51] do you know jackson saw a period media
[2:46:52] stone amen
[2:46:55] on that many things we were written on
[2:46:57] age
[2:46:58] and brethren gathered and the prophet
[2:46:59] was fellowshipping around those things
[2:47:01] and everybody was rejoicing
[2:47:04] amen
[2:47:05] and when they were settling down
[2:47:06] thinking that was all of it
[2:47:08] the prophet took a crowbar to do what
[2:47:11] knock off the edge
[2:47:13] and inside
[2:47:16] that thing which is inside brother
[2:47:17] brother connected it to the opening of
[2:47:19] the entire thing
[2:47:20] is there in the pages of the world
[2:47:23] it said that inside was revealed a stone
[2:47:26] looking so innocent and precious
[2:47:29] as if no light has ever flashed upon it
[2:47:33] initially thought it was something
[2:47:35] outside the bible
[2:47:37] amen but the spirit of the lord came to
[2:47:39] correct him
[2:47:41] that no revelation could come outside of
[2:47:43] the word
[2:47:45] then he realized that it was the truth
[2:47:47] in the bible
[2:47:48] upon which nobody
[2:47:50] has attempted to bring revelation
[2:47:55] did you catch his church
[2:47:57] and he told the generation that we're
[2:47:59] with him to do what
[2:48:00] [Music]
[2:48:01] to watch and look on this
[2:48:04] until he does watch until he comes back
[2:48:08] and he started going what west
[2:48:11] are you catching it
[2:48:12] west was sunset
[2:48:15] was where oh hallelujah
[2:48:18] west was where we have the encounter
[2:48:20] with the angels
[2:48:22] in order to bring the thick cloud
[2:48:25] and as it was going i want to show you
[2:48:27] something
[2:48:29] as i close
[2:48:31] west was where
[2:48:33] he had that encounter with the angels
[2:48:35] amen
[2:48:36] he was going up down the hill down the
[2:48:38] hill until he disappeared
[2:48:40] when he disappeared
[2:48:42] the people are told to look
[2:48:45] started looking away with a corner eye
[2:48:49] and they begin to ask themselves how far
[2:48:51] is he
[2:48:53] where is he gone
[2:48:54] what is it doing
[2:48:56] until a whole lot of them
[2:48:58] many did watch
[2:49:00] many left
[2:49:02] many thunder away
[2:49:04] and disobeyed the instruction
[2:49:07] are you catching it
[2:49:09] when they disobeyed the instruction the
[2:49:12] prophet said they left that place
[2:49:15] with their private interpretation of
[2:49:18] what they thought that meant
[2:49:21] they never waited for the messenger to
[2:49:23] return
[2:49:24] to bring the truth of age listen to me
[2:49:27] church watch it carefully
[2:49:30] now
[2:49:31] years later
[2:49:33] the prophet referred back to that dream
[2:49:36] and he said many people have begin
[2:49:39] to say things and teach things today
[2:49:42] that i am not responsible for he said do
[2:49:45] you remember junior's jackson dream when
[2:49:48] i told them to wait
[2:49:49] they were coming up with theories and
[2:49:51] great interpretations that looked like
[2:49:54] it but it was not exactly it and the
[2:49:56] only thing it succeeded in doing is to
[2:49:59] arrest giants again
[2:50:01] a generation of old fighters who started
[2:50:04] posse lighting and making denominations
[2:50:07] out of the message of the hour knowing
[2:50:10] that the message cannot be denominated
[2:50:13] they unconsciously and deceptively took
[2:50:17] people out of the message when they
[2:50:19] thought they went the message
[2:50:21] if you have ever been caught in such
[2:50:23] error your redemption is to throw away
[2:50:26] those opinions and come and embrace the
[2:50:28] message and start all over
[2:50:31] [Applause]
[2:50:33] then the prophet said do you remember
[2:50:35] the golden calf scream
[2:50:38] do you know before moses came out of the
[2:50:41] cloud
[2:50:42] there was a generation that said as for
[2:50:44] these moses
[2:50:45] we don't know what has become of him
[2:50:48] and they used the force of jezebelism to
[2:50:51] intimidate the high priest to submission
[2:50:54] to do what to erect a golden calf
[2:50:57] those things are shadows they are
[2:50:59] playing out perfectly today hallelujah
[2:51:02] and until and i present the old
[2:51:04] israelite your god that took you brought
[2:51:06] you out of egypt
[2:51:08] this is why people became high dogs
[2:51:10] today amen people can die for their
[2:51:13] pastors even if it's contrary to the
[2:51:16] message
[2:51:17] because as far as they are concerned he
[2:51:19] is the one that has the understanding of
[2:51:21] the message there is no private
[2:51:23] interpretation or private understanding
[2:51:26] to this it is true we shall make more
[2:51:29] sense to it
[2:51:30] that is the job of the fight for about
[2:51:32] not one person god will give grace here
[2:51:35] he will give grace here it will give
[2:51:37] grace here stretch of the living god you
[2:51:40] must raise your heads above the
[2:51:42] fanaticism of this revival to be a
[2:51:45] peculiar treasure take the message in

[2:51:49] opened the entire world has been
[2:51:51] revealed feed on these eternal things it
