brother Anthony for this inspiring tonight let us bow our heads word a prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for bringing us together tonight Lord this virtual pray meeting and I pray that it'll be a special word a special presence a special power minister to your people tonight in a special way have your way with them have your way with us tonight Lord and may the spirit of prayer and supplication be poured Upon Us in a special way in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God bless you and thank you for being here tonight and I'd like to read some scriptures uh we want to read Ephesians 3 14-1 17 and we want to look at Ephesians 6 just one verse verse 10 and then we want to go to to Jeremiah 12 verse 1-5 Ephesians 3 reading from verse 14 and in the prayer meeting try to of your Bible that you could follow through in the scriptures and this is Paul Paul saying for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named that he may Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the Inner Man note that Paul is asking for the Believers to get that strength in the Inner Man now the amplifi this verse 16 reads like this may he Grant you out of the rich treasury of his glory to be strengthened and reinforced with Mighty power in the Inner Man by the Holy Spirit himself indwelling your innermost being and personality verse 17 that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith being rooted and grounded in love now if God seeing us as Christians Believers to be rooted and grounded it means that he want us to go strong firm steady Ephesians 610 a scripture we familiar with finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might and Ephesians that same verse in the Amplified says in conclusion be strong in the Lord be owered through your union with him draw your strength from him that strength which his boundless might provides and this is the main text we're going to read tonight from Jeremiah 12 reading verse 1 to5 and and it's it's a powerful scripture Jeremiah we know know is a prophet that's was under so much persecution and pressure and everything else and he was getting weary and tired and impatient and he began to speak to the Lord and he said this here righteous are thou oh Lord when I plead with thee yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments so he's asking God about his judgments wheree that the Way of the Wicked prosper wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously thou has planted them ye they have Tak me root they grow ye they bring forth fruit thou near in their mouth but far from their RS that's far from their hearts but thou oh Lord knowest me thou has seen me and tried my heart towards thee pull them out like sheep for the slaughter and prepare them for the day of Slaughter how long shall the land mourn and the herbs of every field wither for the wickedness of them that dwell therein the beasts are consumed and the birds because it said he shall not see our last end and God spoke here in verse five if thou has run with the footmen and they have weary thee then how can thou contend with horses and if in the land of Peace wherein thou trusted be we theep how Willl thou do in the SW of Jordan may God bless his word and we want to proceed I want to read this verse 1 to5 in the Amplified of Jeremiah 12 just listen carefully the first line is it just so powerful to me it says in verse one of the Amplified of this same chapter I'm going to read this verse one and I'm going to go down to what the Lord rebuke Jeremiah about the first verse Jeremiah says uncompromisingly righteous and rigidly just are you oh Lord when I complain complain against and contend with you yet let me plead and reason the case with you why does The Way of the Wicked Prosper genuine concern he seen people in wickedness seem to be happy going well why are all they at ease and driving who de very treacherously and deceitfully you have planted them yes they have taken root they grow yes they bring forth fruit you are near in their mouths but far from their hearts so he is saying how long you to go and judge these people why take them out and prepare them for Slaughter and everything else then God rebukes in verse five the Lord rebukes Jeremiah impatient saying if you have raced with men on foot and they have tied you out then how can you compete with horses if you take to flight in a Land of Peace where you feel secure then what will you do when you tread the tangle Maze of jungle haunted by Lions and the swelling the flooding of Jordan so I want to say this to you tonight and tonight I couldn't wait to get here to share this with you and I believe this is such an important one the title I put for this tonight is to run with the horses you have to keep up with the footmen so you could imagine you know when you have a kind of army going out you have footmen walking soldiers left right left right and in front of these footmen have men on horses and they may be on a TR faster pace so the Bible God rebuked Jeremiah and tell her if you have raced with men on foot and they tied you out how can you compete with horses and I want to share this with you tonight the first difficulty the first disappointment the thing that does not work out as you expect the same drama does it have to be the same drama from you the same carome the same behavior if now and you can sit outside and comfort under sunshine what about when the floods come We complain too much we are still looking for easy way out be prepared for tougher times if you can't stand in this easy coffee break time that's how I place it coffee break time how are you going to stand when the going gets tough God's response to Jeremiah's imp patience you cannot run with the horses if you cannot keep up with the footmen so Believers get T tonight you have to keep up with the footman in Christ here we go is where your blessing lies it does not matter the season or time we must be able to endure we must be able to be strong and to be resilient and four words that struck me I was meditating on it the scriptures and these four words we're going to look at them tonight steadfast that word steadfast means firm and unwavering the cinnamon of of that word steadfast is loyal faithful committed devoted dedicated Dependable reliable constant trusty determined [Music] stalwart Relentless single-minded and uncompromising Saints each one of us we have to become steadfast the other word I have here is immovable not able to be moved the cinnamon is fixed secure stable rooted you know the Bible talk about the 54 Ministry and people move with every wind of Doctrine and so on they always shaky shaky shaky but this word immovable means mored anchored set firm set fast stuck jammed stiff unbudgeable the other word I have here is resilient able to withstand or recover quickly from difficult condition it has been said that I have a a very resilient disposition I could preach say four Services straight and still be just a strong when I started out is is something that you could bounce back quickly C in strong tough Hardy quick to recover quick to bounce back buoyant difficult to keep down irrepressible adaptable flexible and the last word I have here is strong and they have different levels of it but this is one I chose to pick out able to withstand Force pressure or wear and the synonymous is wellb built indestructible well fortified well defended well protected impenetrable Fortress like solid durable hard wearing heavy duty tough sturdy well-made substantial rugged resistant imperishable longlasting enduring that was good so Saints Brethren Believers this is uh if I could say a desire or this is what God wants for we to become steadfast immovable resilient strong why because he was telling Jeremiah it have tougher times ahead and if what you're going through wearing you you can't handle what's coming next this is the issue and it's amazing how God almost like Tre use two references he use the Horseman reference and he talk about the time of peace and the how how you call it uh let me just go back and find it again and he talking about uh if in the land of Peace wherein th trust they we the how will thou do in the S of Jordan and you could imagine you're comfortable you could sit outside you could look up and see the sun the sky the moon relax yourself no trouble peace and if you run out on that if you can't manage that what about when the Storm come or let's say a tsunam something that you're not expecting because this is life life journey is a space of time when everything seems to be normal in steady Rhythm everything seemed to be quite normal nothing out of the ordinary all of a sudden when you didn't expect it a tsunamy storm a unpredictable Challenge and if you can manage what you have now you will be finished with what's coming next so Jeremiah got a rebuke from God a a a a heavy rebuke from God but listen to Paul in Philippians chapter 4 you want to look at it 11 to 13 Paul speaking not that I speak in respect of want for I have learned this is Paul now in whatsoever State I am there to be content I know Bo how to be a beast I know how to abound everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and this suff a need I can do all things through Christ which strength at me now listen to this in the amplifier and you have to catch this Paul speaks and the amplify not that I am implying that I was in any personal want for I have learned how to be content satisfied to the point where I am not Disturbed or disired in whatever state I am that is a seron by said that line is AUM by itself in other words that satisfaction he has is on the inside and it doesn't matter what is on the outside whatever state he's in and in verse 12 contining Amplified he said I know how to be a based and live humbly in straightened circumstance do you know how to live that way or you could only live in Pride or you can only live with certain things Paul is saying I know how to be a beast and to live humbly in straighten circumstance I know how to enjoy plenty and live in abundance I have learned here we go in any and all circumstances this secret of facing every situation whether wellfed or going hungry having a sufficiency enough to Speare or going without or being in want I have strength for all things in Christ who empowers me I am ready for anything and equal to anything through him who infuses Inner Strength into me I am self-sufficient in Christ sufficiency or this is a beautiful thing tonight he was saying in every circumstance he is ready to face any situation whether he's hungry whether he's wellfed whether he have plenty or whether he's in straighten circumstance straightened circumstance is when things are tough things are tough things is not as you expected you are in straighten circumstance so in straighten circumstance you don't have to cuss and Carry On and fuss because that will not be always a circumstance in times of plenty you don't have to gloat and do like if you know you don't care about nobody else in the world no you have to learn to have plenty and you have to learn to be hungry too you have to learn to have straighten circumstance you have to learn whatever state it is that you could handle it so it is a Consciousness here we go to realize you have to face greater challenges or difficulty than the one you already encountered the prophet Jeremiah complained to God about wickedness and Injustice in the world that complaint was rebuked by God telling him if the horsemen Tire you out how are you going to contend with the horses in other words get ready get prepared for even harder trials that will come your way don't lose Fai or courage in the face of evil and this is where I'm going to kind of wrap up here from Daniel 9 and Daniel he is in bondage with all the rest he's in bondage and he is in the word he's in the books he's looking what Jeremiah the prophet said that 70 years will be in the Desolation and in verse three of n he said I set my face unto the Lord God to seek by prayer supplication with fasting sa and ashes and I prayed unto the Lord my God and made my confession and said oh Lord the great and Dreadful God note the selflessness of his prayer note he was going all out he right he said he said we have sinned have committed iniquity have done wickedly and have rebelled he wasn't saying you know I'm not too bad you know I you know I you know no we have sinned committed iniquity have done wickedly have rebelled even departed from thy precepts and thy judgments neither have we had now let me just pause here a minute note the Consciousness and the awareness in his impr praying that he's talking to God he's talking to the almighty he's not talking to a president or a prime minister or another human being he's talking to the lord of the earth he said we neither have have we harkened unto thy servers the prophets which spake in thy name to our Kings or princes or fathers oh Lord I just summarize it let's jumping a bit oh Lord we said righteousness belong unto thee but unto us confusion of faces as of this thing to the men of Judah the inhabitants of Jerusalem all Israel that are near that are far off all the countries where was driven them because of their trespass that trespass against the oh Lord to us belong at confusion of fa to our Kings because we have sinned against the to the Lord Our God belong mercies and forgiveness neither have we obeyed the voice of the Lord Our God to walk in his laws ye all Israel have transgressed we have sinned against him I'm going to skip down a bit then he said verse 15 oh no Lord God th has brought our people forth of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand but has gotten the Renown at this day we have sinned we have done wickedly and also I want you to observe the reminders that came throughout the scriptures and I believe brother U had interjected it in his sermons about God saying remember me when they come into land remember me it know it come like generation after Generation The Generation that came out and saw the mighty hand they were fully aware of the miracle working power of God and then you have a generation that don't know that haven't seen that they born and you know they not seeing any Supernatural not seeing certain things and they have a lesser intensity in serving God and and and this is has been the habit and then it just fall to the evil but the fact remain is the history show what God brought you out from and and if you look at your own life tonight you will look back and see where God has brought you from now you might be where you want to be but what is our attitudes now towards God that's why he said come back to your first love because when we first came out and God was dealing with us as individuals we had that passion to know the word that cry to get in the spirit that f is that to please God that's what we had and afterward you get cold formal after you get wife or children or or house and car and money and whatever it is we get settled into this world as if this is it but this is not it and now Lord th has brought for thy people and then verse 16 oh Lord Accord to righteousness let me skip then he said I prayed now therefore oh God verse 17 hear the prayer of thy servant and his supplications and cause thy face to shine upon thy Sanctuary that is desolate for the Lord's sake oh my God incline thine ear open Thine Eyes Behold our desolations and the city that's called by my name what this is challenging us to is come out of this let's say this entitlement it's a curse but Isaac preach about it where you feel it's supposed to happen this way who says oh God incline thine ear open Thine Eyes Behold our desolations and the city which is called oh God here oh Lord forgive is not some watching a prayer and reading a prayer he is poting out oh Lord forgive oh Lorden and do defer not for th old sake oh my God for thy City thy people of the called and while I was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of My People Israel and presenting my supplications unto before the Lord my God yeah while I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel angel came now whom I had seen in the vision caused to fly inform me and talk with me saying oh Daniel I'm now come for to give the skill and understanding and un finish just one more verse I want to get here Daniel l32 say but the people that do know their God shall be strong and do exploits I want to challenge you tonight Saints God want us to be strong not to be worried but to be strong in God God wants us to be the people that know him and to know him is to know him by his word and know him by experience to become strong like an exercise you have to work out to exercise your muscle have to go what the pain point and when you do the exercise and get that pain point then you could build more muscles and tonight I want you to exercise your muscles of prayer tonight your faith muscles in praying tonight ask for big things ask for things that stretches your faith to believe that God could make a way for whatever it is don't limit God to the regular praying that you have been praying but ask God for your own personal Revival ask God for your own personal Victory ask God for the fire to be in the church for people to be delivered and set free go beyond you pray for someone else in your time of prayer let us bow our heads tonight heavenly father I thank you tonight for this word oh if we can't keep up with the horsemen how are we going to keep up with the horses you are challenging us tonight to become strong to become resilient to become a force to reckon with and we have a word from Daniel the people that know their God shall be strong are we know you by Revelation by the word by knowledge and also by experience may you give each one here tonight a fresh experience of Your Love a fresh experience of your power a fresh experience of the unfolding of your word you are God and God Alone Oh I thank you your word is true your word is pure you are just you are uncompromisingly righteous and we thank you tonight you see every heart gathered here Lord when that when Jeremiah was complaining and talking about the wicked and the prospering and the wicked and the happy and the wicked and doing all kind of stuff and they only talking word and talking God but the heart is far how could that be and you could tell Jeremiah hold on take courage take comfort H there there are tougher times ahead and we have to keep up Lord May each person here keep up with the footmen May each person not behind not to say I'm wary I'm tired they even young men shall be wary I'm tired but they that wait upon the Lord sh you their strength oh Jesus May there be a brick you here in prayer tonight as the people get on in prayer that they will wait upon you and they will never forget these words to keep with the horses we have to be able to keep up with the horsemen granted father bless them Lord as they pray bless them as they crowd Lord May there be a special visitation to every home every heart every family every husband and wife every mother and father children young people Lord God and bless the upcoming youth service we going to have on the 24th Lord granted father in Jes we asking amen and amen so I trust tonight that this will mean something to you this is not but we trying to figure out something this is God speaking Jeremiah saying you know what you got to keep up so if you're lagging behind tonight get
