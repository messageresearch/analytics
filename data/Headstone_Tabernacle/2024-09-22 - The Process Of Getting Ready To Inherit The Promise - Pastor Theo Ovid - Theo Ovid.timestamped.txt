[1:04:05] praise the Lord God bless you and
[1:04:07] welcome thanks for
[1:04:09] coming thanks for coming this
[1:04:17] morning last Sunday I preached a message
[1:04:20] the r return to the land of promise amen
[1:04:24] something that you should listen to
[1:04:29] again because you're trying to
[1:04:30] understand what God how God sees
[1:04:33] things I'll say it this way you have
[1:04:36] your point of view and I have
[1:04:38] mine that's okay but what does God
[1:04:43] sees I ain't seen it so I ain't seen it
[1:04:45] so good that's fine you see it however
[1:04:48] you want to see it but always remember
[1:04:50] there are treatings your view my view
[1:04:52] and God's view my view is nothing that's
[1:04:55] not important the main view is how God
[1:04:58] sees
[1:05:00] things Prophet said God sends a guide
[1:05:02] God want you to remember his appointed
[1:05:04] guide I will send you another comforter
[1:05:06] he will guide you to the truth isn't
[1:05:08] that right the church today reject that
[1:05:11] how can you ever expect to go to heaven
[1:05:13] when the Holy Spirit was sent to guide
[1:05:14] us what we take some Cardinal some
[1:05:17] Bishop some general overseer somebody
[1:05:20] like that to guide us when the Holy
[1:05:22] Spirit was given to guide us so the but
[1:05:25] the man above the word the man above God
[1:05:28] the man above the spirit brother BR in a
[1:05:31] guide now the Holy Spirit speaks the
[1:05:34] word I've got many things to tell you
[1:05:36] you cannot understand it now this Jesus
[1:05:39] speaking that but when he comes he will
[1:05:41] guide you to it that's the reason the
[1:05:45] coming of the seals at the finishing of
[1:05:48] the seventh seal the mystery of God
[1:05:51] should be finished here we go to know
[1:05:53] who God is what what he is how he lives
[1:05:59] his
[1:06:00] nature his being you're supposed to be
[1:06:03] all the way up there by that time to
[1:06:06] bring us into the full stature of sons
[1:06:08] of God Amen if you know who God is how
[1:06:13] he lives what you doing in a
[1:06:17] bar because we supposed to know who God
[1:06:21] is what he is how he lives his
[1:06:26] nature his being your own body is not
[1:06:30] even
[1:06:31] yours your body the Bible call it the
[1:06:34] Temple of the Holy Ghost how you ganja
[1:06:37] that
[1:06:38] up how you going smoke that up you
[1:06:41] understand what I'm saying and you will
[1:06:42] see what the devil wants to do I've seen
[1:06:44] it clean so we spoke about returning to
[1:06:47] the land of promised and I just want to
[1:06:49] just just touch that a little bit what
[1:06:51] is the promise to the New Testament
[1:06:53] believer hold on
[1:07:18] okay what is the land promised to the
[1:07:21] New Testament believer so in the Old
[1:07:23] Testament they coming from natural land
[1:07:24] to a natural land isn't that right but
[1:07:27] what is the land promised to the New
[1:07:28] Testament believer the promise is the
[1:07:30] holy spirit Joel 2:28 it shall come to
[1:07:34] pass I'll Port my spirit upon All Flesh
[1:07:37] your sons and daughters shall prophesy
[1:07:39] now the Holy Spirit not come to come to
[1:07:41] Port upon dogs and cats and chickens and
[1:07:46] goats that's have flesh too you know the
[1:07:49] Holy Spirit Come depart upon individuals
[1:07:55] amen but God cannot pour it on filthy
[1:07:59] vessels filthy
[1:08:01] people that's why there is a processed
[1:08:03] inherit this land and you have to
[1:08:06] understand the ways of
[1:08:08] [Music]
[1:08:10] godall I read scripture in Psalms a very
[1:08:12] notable scripture they say Moses know
[1:08:14] his ways the people saw his acts the
[1:08:17] people saw God sent plagues and FES and
[1:08:20] frogs and they they saw the acts of God
[1:08:23] but they never met God they wasn't ever
[1:08:26] in the presence of God they didn't see
[1:08:28] the pillar of fire they didn't know the
[1:08:31] ways of
[1:08:33] God that is what they had was to learn
[1:08:35] and be taught and some when and when you
[1:08:38] think you know you don't know you don't
[1:08:40] know what you don't know that's why God
[1:08:42] sent a prophet that you could be taught
[1:08:45] the ways of God people see the acts of
[1:08:48] God and still reject God they see
[1:08:50] plagues they feel this and they still
[1:08:52] went and make golden Calen
[1:08:55] yes because they didn't know who God was
[1:08:58] and today people seeing acts and they
[1:09:00] want to do that why people caught up in
[1:09:01] things and manifestations and all kind
[1:09:04] of crazy stuff without even inquiring if
[1:09:06] that is God or
[1:09:12] not but
[1:09:14] Abraham watch the promised land to the
[1:09:18] New Testament believer the promise is
[1:09:20] the holy spirit did you notice Joshua
[1:09:23] before the Cross Jordan he said go to
[1:09:26] the midst of the camp clean your clothes
[1:09:30] sanctify every one of you let no man
[1:09:33] come at his wife for within three days
[1:09:35] you will see the glory of
[1:09:38] God it's a process of getting ready to
[1:09:43] inherit the
[1:09:44] promise that's where I get the title
[1:09:46] from the process of getting ready to
[1:09:48] inherit the promise the another Carnival
[1:09:50] B you're tripping it you jumping church
[1:09:51] and you're chipping down the
[1:09:53] road this is another
[1:09:56] man they not even a message man this
[1:09:59] have nothing to do with what the message
[1:10:01] world has and what it think is supposed
[1:10:04] to be this is to find out what God
[1:10:06] thinks about how we supposed to be this
[1:10:10] is this is not matching up to me
[1:10:12] standard this is matching up to what God
[1:10:13] say in the Bible
[1:10:14] [Applause]
[1:10:16] here he said you are the Temple of the
[1:10:19] Holy Ghost don't defile it you are the

[1:20:55] Jesus said it this way sanctify them yes
[1:20:58] sir by thy truth Glory they couldn't
[1:21:01] escape that they couldn't say well I
[1:21:03] following Jesus I following Jesus where
[1:21:05] you going have a process he says
[1:21:08] sanctify them by thy truth that word is
[1:21:11] truth so even the disciples have to be
[1:21:13] Sanctified by the word so where you
[1:21:15] going all right all right you have to
[1:21:17] come out the
[1:21:18] condition that you in
[1:21:22] [Applause]
[1:21:25] some Christ of God listen to this the
[1:21:28] church is the blood of
[1:21:31] Christ by the
[1:21:34] spirit because the life is in the blood
[1:21:38] that is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:41] that baptizes us into his body right
[1:21:43] that recognize his only his body his
[1:21:47] flesh is word so if somebody is truly
[1:21:50] baptized with the Holy Spirit they can
[1:21:51] only recognize the word you know
[1:21:55] anything else outside the word have
[1:21:57] nothing to do with that because the
[1:21:59] spirit and the word is
[1:22:00] one so if you have God's spirit you
[1:22:03] going to recognize God's
[1:22:09] word put BR some church order 7th
[1:22:13] October 195 we believe in justification
[1:22:16] by faith Romans 51 we believe that a
[1:22:18] after a person is being justified by
[1:22:20] faith he has peace with the Lord Jesus
[1:22:22] Christ but it is possible here we go
[1:22:25] that this same person could have habits
[1:22:29] all right such as drinking smoking doing
[1:22:32] things they should not do God called
[1:22:35] them they are Justified they are
[1:22:37] predestinated they elected but they
[1:22:39] could have habits he call it filthy
[1:22:42] habits of the
[1:22:45] flesh then we believe that the blood of
[1:22:48] Jesus
[1:22:49] Christ sanctifies this person amen for
[1:22:53] service to the
[1:22:56] Lord so come you come God take you as
[1:22:58] you are you're still smoking you still
[1:23:00] want to do this and that's okay but it
[1:23:03] doesn't stop there because it's a
[1:23:06] process you don't take a egg and some
[1:23:08] flour and put some sugar just Str in
[1:23:10] your over and say
[1:23:13] kick you just make a over mess
[1:23:17] that you don't do
[1:23:19] that you want it quick so you just fling
[1:23:22] it in the OV fling the egg fling the
[1:23:24] flow fling and say
[1:23:27] cake aush and a rush and a hurry the off
[1:23:31] not respecting that and those materials
[1:23:33] are join to do that it to put you a
[1:23:35] process you had to crack the eggs put
[1:23:36] the flour put the sugar put the this put
[1:23:38] it that put it that blend it
[1:23:42] together then get the right
[1:23:45] temperature all of that you know is
[1:23:50] process then after the timing and you
[1:23:52] pick it out oh that's smelling good boy
[1:23:54] that that a good one almond
[1:23:57] cake
[1:24:03] already so watch this we believe in
[1:24:07] sanctification according to Hebrews
[1:24:09] 13:12 where Jesus also that he might
[1:24:13] sanctify the people with his own blood
[1:24:15] suffered without the gate we believe
[1:24:17] that sanctification is taught in the New
[1:24:19] Testament and meant for the Believers
[1:24:22] through the New Testament age we are not
[1:24:24] living am and we believe that after the
[1:24:27] person have been
[1:24:29] Sanctified unclean habit has gone from
[1:24:33] that person all right he is a Believer
[1:24:35] on the Lord Jesus Christ his habits are
[1:24:38] gone we believe that
[1:24:41] then he is a candidate for the
[1:24:45] baptism of the Holy Spirit which comes
[1:24:49] as a filling of the
[1:24:52] believer so let's go over that slowly
[1:24:54] let's take it slowly and put a
[1:24:56] magnifying glass on
[1:24:57] there so it's not like a carnival B we
[1:25:00] say just e b band moving and your
[1:25:02] dancing chipping to inste pay for the
[1:25:04] mask and pay for the costume just hear
[1:25:06] the music and they jumping and you
[1:25:07] chipping and you part of that band this
[1:25:09] is not that leave carnival on the street
[1:25:13] this is God's
[1:25:14] plan the habits are
[1:25:17] gone why because the bu is now
[1:25:20] Sanctified we believe that then not
[1:25:23] before
[1:25:26] so if you're not becoming Sanctified you
[1:25:28] ain't want no Holy Ghost yet you're
[1:25:30] lying to
[1:25:31] yourself you don't believe you're going
[1:25:33] to get any Holy Ghost if you're
[1:25:35] believing you going to get the Holy
[1:25:36] Ghost you're looking to receive the Holy
[1:25:38] Ghost you will get
[1:25:39] yourself
[1:25:41] Sanctified all habits G on we believe
[1:25:44] that then he is a
[1:25:47] candidate for the baptism of the Holy
[1:25:49] Ghost which come as a filling to the
[1:25:52] believer many times as I've it like
[1:25:54] picking up a glass out of a chicken yard
[1:25:57] justification is picking it up to use it
[1:25:59] with a purpose in heart that's what God
[1:26:01] does to The Sinner he's still filthy so
[1:26:04] you pick up a glass God pick you up with
[1:26:06] your smoking with your drinking with
[1:26:07] your running around with all your life
[1:26:08] all your filthiness he pick you up and
[1:26:10] because he elected you and he chose you
[1:26:12] he pick you up then what happen after
[1:26:14] that he washes the glass that
[1:26:17] sanctification he cleanse the glass not
[1:26:19] you in your natural ha will not pick up
[1:26:21] a filthy glass and just take P me some
[1:26:22] water a thirsty
[1:26:25] as miserable as you might be this
[1:26:27] morning not one of you are mentally
[1:26:30] upset cucko in your head to pick up a
[1:26:32] glass more you go say give some water I
[1:26:34] want to drink I drink
[1:26:36] it you would first wash the glass so God
[1:26:40] have to wash you before he could use
[1:26:43] you I only hear 10% people amen is you
[1:26:46] I'm talking to
[1:26:55] then he is cleansed by the blood of
[1:26:57] Jesus Christ and the word sanctify is a
[1:27:00] compound word it mean clean and set
[1:27:03] aside for service let's go to party
[1:27:05] tonight no I am clean and set aside well
[1:27:10] you know who come in is a party in all
[1:27:12] and
[1:27:13] white that's not the clean we talking
[1:27:16] about and not a clean party because they
[1:27:18] were in White I am
[1:27:20] clean and set aside for service
[1:27:25] hallah we believe that the holy spirit
[1:27:28] is putting the same vessel in service
[1:27:31] that the holy spirit is not another step
[1:27:33] of Grace but more of the same Grace that
[1:27:36] fills the believer to the extent where
[1:27:39] that signs and wonders such as the
[1:27:41] apostolic gift spoken 1 Corinthians 12
[1:27:44] manifest themselves through this
[1:27:46] believer when the Holy Ghost comes in to
[1:27:49] take up those gifts I believe that the
[1:27:50] scripture teaches that gifts are calling
[1:27:53] without repentance that we are born in
[1:27:55] this world we are sent here by one
[1:27:57] purpose that is of god and we are even
[1:28:00] become adults when we were children the
[1:28:02] gifts that we have of God is in us then
[1:28:05] and only the filling of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:07] put these gifts into operation but we
[1:28:09] have them in the beginning such as
[1:28:11] teachers and apostles and Prophets and
[1:28:13] Gifts of tongues nine spiritual gifts we
[1:28:15] believe that these gifts are in
[1:28:17] operation today and they should be in
[1:28:18] every local
[1:28:20] church well but over not feeling
[1:28:24] your feeling becomes
[1:28:26] filthiness when your feeling questions
[1:28:28] the
[1:28:32] word well why thinking he said my
[1:28:35] thoughts are not your thoughts what are
[1:28:36] you thinking you have to say Lord I
[1:28:38] Repent of my own
[1:28:40] thoughts I want your thoughts I want
[1:28:43] your mind oh praise God praise God look
[1:28:48] in Acts 10 we know this story about man
[1:28:50] called Cornelius he was a devout man man
[1:28:52] that feared God with all his house give
[1:28:54] much arms to the people and pray to God
[1:28:58] always coming up in the car I was talk
[1:29:01] to my wife telling them about how on the
[1:29:04] other side there will be some which say
[1:29:08] Jesus will tell them I was sick and
[1:29:10] never he to come and look for me and I
[1:29:11] was in prison you never visited me I was
[1:29:13] hungry never fed me he said when Lord he
[1:29:16] say as you have done it to the least of
[1:29:17] these ones you have done to me I say I
[1:29:19] tell my wife I say it's just pure
[1:29:21] wickedness when people in a position to
[1:29:24] help and they
[1:29:27] don't God sees at that and then people
[1:29:29] walk with the Bible in
[1:29:31] church but they're
[1:29:37] Wicked somebody hungry and your pass say
[1:29:41] because you don't want to help
[1:29:43] them and is a position to do that God
[1:29:46] see that as wickedness you see that
[1:29:49] money thing where the servant buried the
[1:29:51] money and the master went away this one
[1:29:53] half five he bring five this one 10
[1:29:55] bring 10 this one have one he bury it
[1:29:57] he's so
[1:30:01] inspired when he Master come back he say
[1:30:03] look your one day one look it's safe and
[1:30:06] S you say you're Wicked man at least if
[1:30:10] you had put it in the bank to get
[1:30:11] interest it right now have 5% .1% almost
[1:30:14] no perc interest at least you get little
[1:30:16] thing
[1:30:18] on the banks are all Wicked
[1:30:25] I'm not going
[1:30:28] there but this man was devout listen he
[1:30:31] wasn't a Christian you
[1:30:34] know he wasn't belonging to the message
[1:30:37] of the hour in that
[1:30:39] day he was a
[1:30:41] gentile so that come like me people
[1:30:43] looking at a gentile
[1:30:45] man H and he doing better
[1:30:50] works just and loving his Saints yes and
[1:30:55] people inside of here loving nobody they
[1:30:57] loving I myself and me and my
[1:31:02] family help us
[1:31:06] Lord and this man praying that God he
[1:31:09] never
[1:31:11] met a god he don't
[1:31:14] know but he's not praying and just
[1:31:16] praying like a air prayer people playing
[1:31:20] air guitar just doing something
[1:31:27] I guess have air
[1:31:29] Christians they just air Christians is
[1:31:32] just making
[1:31:35] motions devil will just laugh at that
[1:31:37] you
[1:31:38] know he a testing that he
[1:31:45] said God told this
[1:31:48] man die
[1:31:50] prayers and D arms
[1:31:54] that's what he's
[1:31:56] given his
[1:31:58] contribution I come up for a memorial
[1:32:00] before
[1:32:02] God so you could do things on
[1:32:05] earth that influences and recognizes in
[1:32:13] heaven but Gideon preacher message the
[1:32:16] power of
[1:32:16] one let me add a little back to that the
[1:32:19] audience of
[1:32:22] one if we could live
[1:32:24] for the audience of for the audience of
[1:32:26] one God himself you're not pleas in
[1:32:30] family friends you're not pleas in
[1:32:31] school friends nobody you are pleasing
[1:32:34] the audience of
[1:32:38] one but give an
[1:32:40] illustration of a man who was doing some
[1:32:42] music piece and when he finished so
[1:32:46] everybody clapping and shouting and he
[1:32:48] moving because he watching a man up
[1:32:51] there he want to know what that man
[1:32:53] think
[1:32:54] because that is the man that taught him
[1:32:57] that is the man who's the master he's
[1:32:59] not interested in people who don't know
[1:33:00] F note from C note as far as they
[1:33:03] concern it's sing good and that's the
[1:33:05] problem in the message brother George
[1:33:06] people don't know F note from C note and
[1:33:08] they find the preacher sing
[1:33:11] good they know Genesis the Revelation
[1:33:13] they know nothing in the Bible but they
[1:33:15] like the man he could say anything to
[1:33:18] them but this
[1:33:20] man then he watching he watching the
[1:33:22] audience are one
[1:33:24] when that man was satisfied and he
[1:33:26] raised his hands he know he
[1:33:30] IM who are you
[1:33:33] pleasing Oh Glory to God do you
[1:33:36] recognize the audience of one God must
[1:33:39] be first your family second and you must
[1:33:43] come last oh give the Lord a shout he
[1:33:47] said give me a farmer give me a preacher
[1:33:50] give me a housewife give me any man that
[1:33:52] will put God first I will show you
[1:33:54] somebody that is successful despite
[1:33:57] whatever the devil put in front of
[1:33:59] them oh give the Lord I show we are free
[1:34:04] [Applause]
[1:34:11] today brother
[1:34:15] brand you are begotten of the spirit at
[1:34:20] sanctification I preach this I share
[1:34:22] this so much times I hope it come across
[1:34:23] different this
[1:34:25] time begotten is when the baby is being
[1:34:28] formed in the
[1:34:30] womb birth is when the baby come true so
[1:34:34] the formation of eyes and Limbs and
[1:34:37] whatever inside of that he says you are
[1:34:39] begotten at
[1:34:42] sanctification so what a punch if
[1:34:44] somebody not Sanctified what happening
[1:34:46] inside they be big
[1:34:51] bigboot you are begotten
[1:34:54] of the spirit at
[1:34:55] sanctification but never born of the
[1:34:58] spirit until the Holy Ghost comes a baby
[1:35:02] got life in the womb of the mother
[1:35:03] little muscles are quivering it's a life
[1:35:06] but it's a different life when it
[1:35:08] breaths the breath of life into his
[1:35:11] noil he said my dear Methodist Brother P
[1:35:13] Holiness Nazarene the baptism of the
[1:35:16] Holy Ghost is different from
[1:35:18] sanctification sanctification is the
[1:35:20] cleansing which is the preparation of
[1:35:22] life but when the Holy Ghost comes it is
[1:35:26] life preparing or Preparation is the
[1:35:29] cleaning the vessel the Holy Ghost is
[1:35:32] filling the vessel sanctification means
[1:35:35] clean and set aside for service the Holy
[1:35:37] Spirit it puts it in service you are the
[1:35:41] vessel that God has cleaned
[1:35:43] up oh glory to God you must have a
[1:35:46] testimony God has not you stop smoking
[1:35:49] stop drinking you know God has clean me
[1:35:52] up oh give say Lord I shout you could
[1:35:54] stop doing this and stop doing that but
[1:35:56] when the work is done by God you have a
[1:35:59] testimony that gives glory to God and
[1:36:01] give a witness that he's the same
[1:36:03] yesterday today and
[1:36:05] [Applause]
[1:36:07] forever
[1:36:09] glory glory to
[1:36:12] God hallelujah hallelujah praise God
[1:36:15] praise
[1:36:16] God so without sanctification you really
[1:36:19] not even the
[1:36:20] message because the blood not effective
[1:36:23] to you
[1:36:24] is a mind thought that believe what the
[1:36:26] God said and God s a prophet that a mind
[1:36:28] thing that a life thing and when you
[1:36:32] come into the message to reflect the
[1:36:33] message you have to have a blood show
[1:36:36] and the blood for the age is brotherly
[1:36:38] kindness which is totally
[1:36:40] absent wh you had to look you had to
[1:36:43] look that why you say when the chch find
[1:36:45] it because they lost it that is totally
[1:36:47] absent Breen crossing the street ducking
[1:36:49] one kind of thing forget it and D bride
[1:36:52] know that bride what
[1:36:57] that is quality tribulation
[1:37:01] Saint you hear what I said that is
[1:37:04] quality tribulation Saints they have a
[1:37:07] ticket to the tribulation it almost like
[1:37:10] a
[1:37:12] cruise there was the VIP rest of the
[1:37:14] Pentecost and the other mates people
[1:37:16] other people behind
[1:37:18] them and this is where I find such a
[1:37:20] powerful deception because you have to
[1:37:22] see what God requ
[1:37:26] requires the people see in Acts but
[1:37:28] Moses know his
[1:37:30] ways when there was complain about Moses
[1:37:32] wife what you think God come and tell
[1:37:34] them are you
[1:37:36] serious are you coming against a man
[1:37:38] that I talking
[1:37:42] to be
[1:37:45] serious God straightened them out
[1:37:55] Satan has an
[1:38:00] agenda and I'm realizing
[1:38:03] that
[1:38:05] H you know the prophet talk about the
[1:38:07] person of Christ yes sir and you can see
[1:38:11] people don't understand God have a
[1:38:14] personality God is Not abstract you know
[1:38:16] like you know God everywhere and you
[1:38:20] spitting your hands through he's not
[1:38:23] that you know
[1:38:24] amen he has feeling about
[1:38:28] things he has determination about things
[1:38:31] one time he was so upset he repent he
[1:38:33] made
[1:38:35] man but Noah found Grace in his
[1:38:41] sight if God didn't make man the Earth
[1:38:44] in in
[1:38:46] normal the Stars was normal it was good
[1:38:49] for good heaven good dinosaurs
[1:38:53] everything everybody
[1:38:54] good fish
[1:38:58] good everything running good he said oh
[1:39:01] gosh but there's nothing in my image and
[1:39:04] likeness let me make something in my
[1:39:06] image and
[1:39:07] likeness let us make
[1:39:10] man when he put
[1:39:12] man then outter man he p a
[1:39:16] woman devil see that
[1:39:21] good he see opportunity that he has
[1:39:24] somebody to work
[1:39:26] with God give them word eat of every
[1:39:29] tree the tree limits don't touch it
[1:39:32] because the day you eat that day you
[1:39:35] shall surely
[1:39:37] die ad I'm going to work Adam tilling
[1:39:40] soil devil come by Eve to ask Eve what
[1:39:43] God say because God not talking to Satan
[1:39:46] Satan get boots away from Heaven no chat
[1:39:48] no talk no no
[1:39:50] inspir then when she Express what God
[1:39:53] say she said You shall not surely die
[1:39:55] look at us
[1:39:59] today young people don't think they
[1:40:01] dying
[1:40:06] now Bible
[1:40:08] says know you not that your body is a
[1:40:11] temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you
[1:40:15] which you have of God that you are not
[1:40:17] your own you were bought with a price
[1:40:21] therefore glorify God in your body and
[1:40:23] in your spirit which are God's so in
[1:40:27] looking at Satan's
[1:40:30] character and the person of his being
[1:40:33] this anointed
[1:40:36] cherub Satan can never get back his
[1:40:41] position you know sometime if you know
[1:40:43] you can get back a position you could
[1:40:47] beg he gets sign off the pink slip he
[1:40:51] get out of Heaven he has no access to
[1:40:53] get back up there to get back to the
[1:40:55] position he had he got boots and he not
[1:40:58] going back so he has nothing to
[1:41:05] lose so his job is to
[1:41:09] corrupt the
[1:41:11] Tabernacles the
[1:41:13] temples the houses that God cannot get
[1:41:18] access and Liv in
[1:41:25] his job is to corrupt what is inside of
[1:41:27] you so that you cannot be acceptable to
[1:41:33] God and once you cannot be acceptable to
[1:41:36] God then Satan has won
[1:41:42] amen the value of your
[1:41:46] house do you know the value of your
[1:41:49] house all right all right all right
[1:41:54] if you don't it's time to get
[1:42:01] valuation don't sell yourself
[1:42:04] cheap time to do a
[1:42:07] valuation Satan's work is for the house
[1:42:12] to lose value by
[1:42:15] fornication
[1:42:17] adultery G ganja smoking lies corrupt it
[1:42:22] until God reject
[1:42:31] so Satan hates this thing called
[1:42:34] process the process of
[1:42:38] sanctification it cost to sanctify and
[1:42:41] we read it Jesus said I sanctify
[1:42:45] myself some of you give up
[1:42:48] nothing that why I tell young people
[1:42:51] long time if your mother and father
[1:42:52] don't deal with you life will cut your
[1:42:56] tail all way you get away with and you
[1:42:58] think you get through life will come and
[1:43:01] whip you because life have a way of
[1:43:04] balancing things
[1:43:11] off so Satan is at
[1:43:15] work he could be very
[1:43:17] patient he could wait you out because he
[1:43:21] have a specific agenda and that's why
[1:43:24] the prophet went and said What Hurts The
[1:43:26] Devil is to see a
[1:43:29] consecrated dedicated
[1:43:32] life Hallelujah that hurt that's the
[1:43:36] Thunder that shake the
[1:43:38] devil because as a life the devil can't
[1:43:41] touch he could only watch but he can't
[1:43:43] touch his job is to pervert the
[1:43:46] Tabernacle like you are the house that
[1:43:48] you are the temple that you are that God
[1:43:50] can't lose you
[1:43:55] that's why the prophet said if you can't
[1:43:57] live it then stop preaching
[1:43:59] it because the preacher suppos to live
[1:44:01] it and preach it
[1:44:12] too I've preach it often that you it
[1:44:15] easy to see the the outside
[1:44:18] sins Lord yes
[1:44:21] sir it easy to see the visible
[1:44:25] sins the bigger sins is the one that you
[1:44:27] can't
[1:44:35] see the sins of
[1:44:38] resentment
[1:44:41] bitterness
[1:44:44] unforgiveness the inner jails that
[1:44:46] people are
[1:44:48] in sin is bondage
[1:44:54] sin is what affects your worship to
[1:44:57] God your service to
[1:45:00] God and God hat
[1:45:03] sin we not talking about loving the
[1:45:05] sinner now we not talking about that
[1:45:08] part we talking about what God
[1:45:17] hates Matthew
[1:45:20] 12 vers 22 is the script before four
[1:45:24] then was brought unto him one possessed
[1:45:25] with a devil blind and dumb and he
[1:45:27] healed him in so much as the Blind and
[1:45:29] dumb both spake and saw and all the
[1:45:32] people were amazed and said is not this
[1:45:33] the son of
[1:45:35] David and when the Pharisees heard it
[1:45:37] they said this fellow does not cast out
[1:45:39] Devils but by Bel the prince of devils
[1:45:42] know they know the
[1:45:44] prince and Jesus knew that
[1:45:47] thought and said unto them every Kingdom
[1:45:50] divided against itself is brought
[1:45:53] desolation and every city or house
[1:45:56] divided against itself shall not stand
[1:45:59] and if Satan cast out Satan he is
[1:46:02] divided against himself how shall then
[1:46:05] his kingdom
[1:46:16] stand and if I by B cast out Devils by
[1:46:19] whom do your children cast them
[1:46:21] out therefore they shall be your judges
[1:46:25] but if I cast them out by the Devils by
[1:46:27] the spirit of God then the kingdom of
[1:46:29] God has come upon
[1:46:30] [Music]
[1:46:32] you but these are the words he said
[1:46:34] closing or else how can one enter into a
[1:46:38] strong man's house and spoil his Goods
[1:46:42] except he first bind a strong man and he
[1:46:44] will spoil his
[1:46:46] house oh my
[1:46:48] Hallelujah so Jesus clearly identifies
[1:46:51] sat of a kingdom
[1:46:53] and S Satan have order in his kingdom he
[1:46:56] no fool not he not running no hey move
[1:46:59] so move so no no no he have
[1:47:02] structure he has a system he has an
[1:47:05] order do you have a
[1:47:06] order do you have a
[1:47:09] structure Matthew 12:43 45 says when the
[1:47:12] unclean spirit this the part I want to
[1:47:14] get to is gone out of a
[1:47:17] man he walth through Dry places seeking
[1:47:20] rest and findeth none so all these
[1:47:23] spirits that was kicked out of
[1:47:26] heaven they already don't belong here
[1:47:27] you
[1:47:28] know they're looking for
[1:47:31] bodies they're looking for
[1:47:33] houses so when an unclean spirit is gone
[1:47:36] out of a man he walk through Dry places
[1:47:37] seeking rest find it none he says I will
[1:47:40] return unto my house from whence I came
[1:47:43] out and when he has come he found it

[1:55:54] morning
[1:56:05] Hallelujah God has his idea of what
[1:56:08] respects
[1:56:11] is respect you're talking
[1:56:16] about God has his idea of what Holiness
[1:56:20] is
[1:56:22] God has his idea of what sanctification
[1:56:25] is so it's not your thoughts on Holiness
[1:56:29] it's not your thoughts on sanctification
[1:56:31] it's not your thoughts on respects it is
[1:56:34] God thoughts on the
[1:56:37] [Applause]
[1:56:44] matter the wiow
[1:56:46] woman who offered a pen in the offering
[1:56:50] and Jesus watching everybody
[1:56:53] contribution as the putting as the
[1:56:56] basket is
[1:56:58] passed you can't
[1:57:00] even

[1:57:10] money for the offering you say rub it
[1:57:12] and TI and off not just TI alone TI and
[1:57:14] offering Jesus watching what that woman
[1:57:17] put and put in a coin and she said she
[1:57:20] put in more money than all of them
[1:57:23] amen because she put in all that she had
[1:57:27] my point is this God to see
[1:57:29] sacrifice God will see honesty God to
[1:57:33] see truth God to see sincerity that's
[1:57:37] what God saw at the woman of the well
[1:57:39] when Jesus said go call your husband she
[1:57:40] said have none he said he spoke the
[1:57:42] truth in other words even though she was
[1:57:44] living a filthy life she had an honest
[1:57:46] heart she wasn't lying she was telling
[1:57:49] the truth and Jesus released her
[1:57:52] woman go and sin no more woman that Loos
[1:57:56] woman you are free and she could say
[1:57:59] come see a man who told me all that I
[1:58:00] did so I am saying in this message
[1:58:03] there's a God that is look at the human
[1:58:05] heart and God looking at your heart this
[1:58:08] morning God looking at your condition

[1:58:47] more because it becomes a lust not to

[2:13:10] good my my my my my for Darren Romans 1:
[2:13:15] 17 says for daring is the righteousness
[2:13:17] of God revealed from fith to fate as it
[2:13:20] is written the Jos by faith watch Paul
[2:13:23] in next verse for the wrath of God is
[2:13:27] revealed from Heaven against all
[2:13:30] ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
[2:13:34] who hold the truth in
[2:13:36] unrighteousness the Amplified for God's
[2:13:40] holy wrath and indignation are revealed
[2:13:43] from Heaven against all ungodliness and
[2:13:47] unrighteousness of men now Satan knows
[2:13:49] this
[2:13:51] so Satan knows if he could pull you into
[2:13:55] unrighteousness pull you into
[2:13:57] ungodliness rat coming for
[2:14:03] you it have these systems now these
[2:14:05] technological systems like apply for
[2:14:08] something and it rejects you is not a
[2:14:09] human doing that you know the system
[2:14:12] gets the information I think even now I
[2:14:15] think even to apply for the US Visa to
[2:14:17] know if you could come into the
[2:14:18] interview the systems will actually
[2:14:20] ident it's not a human checkin and going
[2:14:22] through that you know the system working
[2:14:25] automatically it will give you a a a
[2:14:27] tick to say will come for interview or
[2:14:29] not or whatever it is it will do that
[2:14:31] well God's
[2:14:33] nature he can't help it he has to
[2:14:37] respond a certain
[2:14:43] way do you understand that it's not that
[2:14:47] God it's not that God sh and loved them
[2:14:49] God get a fight no his word demands he
[2:14:52] keeps
[2:14:53] it so he told Adam the day you eat that
[2:14:56] day you die in other words the system or
[2:14:59] the law is already in place to affect
[2:15:01] death if you touch
[2:15:04] that and I can't change
[2:15:08] it for God's holy wrath and indignation
[2:15:11] are revealed from Heaven against all the
[2:15:13] ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
[2:15:16] who in their wickedness repress and
[2:15:20] hinder the the truth and make it
[2:15:24] inoperative
[2:15:26] enablers and complicit persons becomes
[2:15:30] enemy of God Amen how could you become
[2:15:32] an enemy of God James 4 says he
[2:15:35] adulterers and adulter say know you not
[2:15:38] that the Friendship of the world is
[2:15:40] enmity with God whosoever therefore will
[2:15:43] be a friend of the world is the enemy of
[2:15:45] God James 4 the amplifi says you are
[2:15:48] like Unfaithful wives having illicit
[2:15:50] love affairs with the world and breaking
[2:15:53] your marriage vow to God do you not know
[2:15:56] that being the world's friend is being
[2:15:58] God's enemy so whosoever chooses to be a
[2:16:01] friend of the world takes his stand as
[2:16:03] an enemy of God the Bible say God has
[2:16:06] resist the proud is not proud outside
[2:16:09] it's proud right inside the
[2:16:11] church but there a demon that's a spirit
[2:16:13] to you know that's the original spirit
[2:16:15] that Satan got caught up with pride I
[2:16:17] will be like the most high I will be
[2:16:19] like God he exalt himself you have to be
[2:16:22] able to walk
[2:16:23] humble you have to walk to humble
[2:16:25] yourself put a mark upon those who are
[2:16:29] not enablers or complicit with sin God
[2:16:32] will not put a mark upon those who are
[2:16:40] enablers Hebrews 12:5 says and you have
[2:16:43] not and this is a verse we are touched
[2:16:45] before you are and and he have forgotten
[2:16:47] the exaltation which speaketh unto you
[2:16:50] as as children children my son despise
[2:16:52] not the chasen of the Lord or faint when
[2:16:55] th rebuke for him that's for children
[2:16:59] that not for God not rebuking any
[2:17:00] Sinners outside you know the Sinners
[2:17:02] need to come to get saved but the sons
[2:17:04] in the churches who get
[2:17:07] rebuked the sons and churches who get
[2:17:10] corrected the Sinners don't sin you know
[2:17:13] they they are sinners is the people in
[2:17:15] ch that
[2:17:19] sin if you in your chasten God deal with
[2:17:21] you as with sons for what son is he whom
[2:17:24] the father chasteneth not the Amplified
[2:17:26] for the Lord corrects and discipline
[2:17:28] everyone whom he loves and he punishes
[2:17:32] even scores I didn't check the meaning
[2:17:34] of the word scores but I think there's
[2:17:35] plenty licks on your
[2:17:37] back every son whom he accepts and
[2:17:40] welcomes to his heart and
[2:17:46] cherishes you must submit to and endure
[2:17:49] correction for
[2:17:53] discipline so therefore we running a
[2:17:55] mark because we doing our own thing your
[2:17:58] mother get away father get away you get
[2:18:00] away you
[2:18:03] loose and you come to the Lord and his
[2:18:06] hand come upon you now yes you must
[2:18:08] submit to and endure correction for
[2:18:12] discipline God is dealing with you as
[2:18:13] with sons for what son is there whom his
[2:18:15] father does not train and correct a
[2:18:18] discipline they come like you don't want
[2:18:20] to correct your son or daughter because
[2:18:22] you don't want to them to feel bad but
[2:18:26] the problem with that is this later on
[2:18:27] in life they will make you feel
[2:18:30] bad do you get that your daughter or son
[2:18:35] misbehaving in public and instead of you
[2:18:37] straighten them out and get them on the
[2:18:38] right footing and they go cry and cry
[2:18:40] and know put up a show and let them put
[2:18:42] up the show but you let it go and
[2:18:46] afterwards that little thing gr up in
[2:18:47] one big monster later on they going to
[2:18:49] embarrass you in public
[2:18:51] so it's better you straighten them out
[2:18:53] now sometime ago we say it's better you
[2:18:55] work with a young child than to try to
[2:18:58] correct a Broken
[2:19:01] Man deal with your son when he is Young
[2:19:04] than when he's
[2:19:06] broken so sin must be
[2:19:08] confessed and
[2:19:11] forsaken you can take some more I am

[2:19:28] hours away so you're
[2:19:32] safe all right Bible says now no
[2:19:36] chastening for the present seem it to be
[2:19:39] joyous but Grievous nevertheless
[2:19:42] afterwards it yielded the Peaceable
[2:19:44] fruit of righteousness unto them which
[2:19:45] are exercised thereby now Romans
[2:19:49] 1 and I think this is a powerful one
[2:19:52] Romans 1: 24 it says wherefore God give
[2:19:56] them up to uncleanness through their
[2:19:57] lust of their own Hearts note it's
[2:20:00] inside of the people it's inside of
[2:20:04] people lust of their own Hearts to
[2:20:07] dishonor their own bodies between
[2:20:08] themselves who change the truth of God
[2:20:10] into aive verse 25 and worship and serve
[2:20:13] the creature more than the Creator who
[2:20:15] is blessed forever and amen for this
[2:20:17] cause God give them up unto vile
[2:20:20] affection even their woman did change
[2:20:22] their natural use in the that which is
[2:20:23] against nature likewise also the men
[2:20:26] leaving the natural use of the woman
[2:20:27] burning their lust one towards another
[2:20:30] men with men working that which is
[2:20:32] unseemly and receiving in themselves
[2:20:34] that recompense of their error which was
[2:20:36] meat and even as they did not like to
[2:20:38] retain God in their knowledge God gave
[2:20:41] them over to a reprobate mind to do
[2:20:45] those things which are not convenient
[2:20:47] being filled with all here we go
[2:20:49] unrighteousness
[2:20:52] fornication wickedness
[2:20:55] covetousness maliciousness full of Envy
[2:20:58] murder debate deceit maginity Whisperers
[2:21:03] backbiters haters of God despiteful
[2:21:07] proud boasters inventors of evil things
[2:21:11] disobedient to Parents Without
[2:21:14] understanding Covenant Breakers without
[2:21:16] natural affection implacable unmerciful
[2:21:21] hallah that's the whole hug that's
[2:21:24] everything inside of there verse 32
[2:21:28] there's the part who knowing the
[2:21:30] Judgment of God so this is not people on
[2:21:32] the
[2:21:34] outside who knowing the Judgment of God
[2:21:37] that they which commit such things are
[2:21:41] worthy of
[2:21:44] dead not only do the same but have
[2:21:48] pleasure in them that do that in other
[2:21:52] words they are complicit with others who
[2:21:56] are doing those
[2:21:58] things Romans 1:22 in the Amplified said
[2:22:01] though they are fully aware of God's
[2:22:03] righteous
[2:22:05] decree that those who do such things
[2:22:09] deserve to die they not only do them
[2:22:12] themselves but approve and applaud
[2:22:15] others who practice them let's continue
[2:22:21] Brown Pentecost is not a denomination
[2:22:24] Pentecost is an experience it is the
[2:22:27] Holy Ghost it is not an organization you
[2:22:30] couldn't organize the Holy Ghost he
[2:22:31] wouldn't stand for it you are not even
[2:22:33] converted till you get the Holy Ghost
[2:22:35] that is what the scriptures said Jesus
[2:22:37] told Peter ask anyone read your
[2:22:39] scriptures he was justified by Believing
[2:22:40] on the Lord Jesus becoming a follower an
[2:22:42] apostle Jesus G him the keys to the
[2:22:44] kingdom St John 17:17 he Sanctified them
[2:22:47] with power and send them out to cast out
[2:22:49] devils and sanctify them
[2:22:51] and sanctify them Father to thy truth he
[2:22:53] said I sanctify myself because of them
[2:22:56] Jesus said these words I sanctify myself
[2:22:59] because of them he said that's one of
[2:23:01] the sweetest words that I ever heard
[2:23:02] father I sanctify myself for de sake do
[2:23:06] you know here we go do you know he had a
[2:23:09] right to have a home he was a human do
[2:23:13] you know he had a right to have a wife
[2:23:15] he was a man he had a right to have all
[2:23:18] these things he said father I sanctify
[2:23:20] if y myself for their sake I
[2:23:25] sanctify
[2:23:26] myself Jesus was training 12 men those
[2:23:30] 12 men has to was to take the gospel to
[2:23:32] the world and he said for their sake I
[2:23:35] sanctify myself and then he said these
[2:23:38] words make yourself for your neighbor's
[2:23:42] sake for somebody else sake that's the
[2:23:45] problem we live too little too small
[2:23:48] because we are selfish and when you live
[2:23:50] selfish lives you don't have no
[2:23:52] motivation to really support and help
[2:23:54] others am me and I we learn over the
[2:23:56] years you could never help others you
[2:23:58] can help
[2:24:00] yourself when you bless others you see
[2:24:02] blessing come back yourself you support
[2:24:04] others you support come back yourself
[2:24:06] you're not looking for support you're
[2:24:07] not looking for blessing you're just
[2:24:08] doing the right thing doing what needs
[2:24:10] to be
[2:24:11] done that's why I say how could you see
[2:24:13] somebody hungry and to help them and
[2:24:15] feed them somebody without clothes and
[2:24:17] you wouldn't want to give them clothes
[2:24:18] and you can afford to
[2:24:20] amen is
[2:24:22] wickedness God seizes as such watch this
[2:24:27] get this get
[2:24:29] this if you meet your enem okay let
[2:24:32] let's read it again make yourself for
[2:24:34] your neighbor's sake are we hearing this
[2:24:38] for somebody else sake don't use your
[2:24:41] Liberty for a cloak Paul said but
[2:24:44] sanctify yourself behave yourself in the
[2:24:46] neighborhood
[2:24:51] like a real Christian ought to let your
[2:24:55] communication it come like he people

[2:26:07] truth hear
[2:26:09] this if you meet your enemy sanctify
[2:26:11] yourself okay
[2:26:13] okay so God tell the
[2:26:16] prophet be more
[2:26:18] sincere you have been given power to
[2:26:20] bind the M now listen he didn't tell him
[2:26:23] if he be sincere he get the power he
[2:26:26] said you have been given power be more
[2:26:27] sincere but the M couldn't affect him
[2:26:30] the M was going after
[2:26:34] Brethren so his sincerity and he going
[2:26:37] and fast and pray to get more sincere
[2:26:39] understand this God tell him be more
[2:26:41] sincere nobody else in the world could
[2:26:43] tell the prophet be more
[2:26:44] sincere nobody could see that the saying
[2:26:46] as a prophet but when God looked down
[2:26:48] God see stuff inside of there that have
[2:26:50] to get thrown
[2:26:54] out and we have to understand is not
[2:26:57] what we think not what we feel is what
[2:26:59] God
[2:27:00] sees and when he went and sanctify
[2:27:03] himself and fast three days he was
[2:27:05] binding the mama to protect Brethren
[2:27:08] from being affected by that thing that
[2:27:09] when it hit you it kill
[2:27:11] you some of you will get killed if you
[2:27:15] don't come under protection because this
[2:27:17] here in this church is not the battle I
[2:27:20] some of you think that but not the
[2:27:23] B so please don't get fight with
[2:27:26] me do get fight with me because the
[2:27:28] battle is not me I I look like
[2:27:31] Lucifer I have any resemblance to what
[2:27:34] Lucy looking
[2:27:37] like you are here to get
[2:27:40] equipped you are here to get empowered
[2:27:43] you are here because your battle is
[2:27:45] about to start
[2:27:47] [Music]
[2:27:53] H I won't want to worry you out but I
[2:27:56] have some things here that I
[2:27:58] really the placing of a son the first
[2:28:02] thing after the son was in he become a
[2:28:04] son then we find out we find here we go
[2:28:07] his behavior is what set him to adoption
[2:28:11] whether he behaved right or not note not
[2:28:14] his
[2:28:15] sermon not his message not his jacket
[2:28:19] not his shoes not the what he wear his
[2:28:24] behavior not his
[2:28:29] podcast this is God thoughts in matter
[2:28:32] not a preaching for 4 hours and it's
[2:28:33] mystery after mystery and you have the
[2:28:34] head your head SP
[2:28:40] Jes
[2:28:42] Behavior you mean after all this gospel
[2:28:44] after all this word after all this Bible
[2:28:47] after all this teaching it come down to
[2:28:48] behavior yes
[2:28:51] [Applause]
[2:29:00] we find out his behavior is what setting
[2:29:03] to adoption whether he behave right or
[2:29:06] not a minister come to the pit and say
[2:29:09] I'm
[2:29:10] adopted like a
[2:29:11] fool and people believe that foolishness
[2:29:14] he adopted because his mouth say
[2:29:17] so sometime they get others people to
[2:29:20] you know he want to
[2:29:26] see when Jesus was adopted a voice
[2:29:31] thundered this is my beloved Son hearing
[2:29:37] him God is ashame of his son to say I
[2:29:40] approved his
[2:29:42] son so no real son adopted have to say
[2:29:46] you know say want to say it you know but
[2:29:48] I you know that um
[2:29:51] Cho so he
[2:29:53] nothing he he wasting time he's just
[2:29:55] idle and he have no
[2:29:57] message and he want you to to believe
[2:29:59] him just just like
[2:30:02] that say it will speak for
[2:30:09] itself so his behavior right not his
[2:30:13] gift not his talent not his
[2:30:17] ability his teaching gift no Pastor gift
[2:30:21] Apostle gift length of time in the
[2:30:25] ministry his
[2:30:27] behavior this man 40 people 40 50 years
[2:30:30] and then
[2:30:32] fail the
[2:30:35] come for
[2:30:38] wife all
[2:30:43] right but R say what worries me is to
[2:30:46] take people and preach to them this God
[2:30:48] send truth and they turn right back
[2:30:50] around and just keep on doing the same
[2:30:51] thing and say to God the holy ghost that
[2:30:53] ruins you we should be so on fire for
[2:30:57] God we should be going day and night
[2:31:00] nothing should be able to stop us we
[2:31:02] should be so

[2:31:39] that the hell s sell
[2:31:44] honey some people literally get honey
[2:31:47] and that wouldn't make it sweet
[2:31:50] the perfume of forgiveness a clean heart
[2:31:54] that can make you
[2:31:56] sweet amen you talk about sanctification
[2:31:59] in the westan church in West time

[2:32:03] Sanctified that the Holy Ghost come upon
[2:32:05] them come upon the Believers and they

[2:32:11] service have a bucket of water and
[2:32:12] waiting when the Holy Ghost hit them so
[2:32:14] you water them to wake them up can't let
[2:32:17] them break into the Holy Ghost just yet
[2:32:19] Sanic attracts the Holy Ghost he said we
[2:32:21] should be so on fire for God we should
[2:32:23] be going day and night nothing should be
[2:32:25] able to stop us we should be so sweet so
[2:32:27] pleasant so kind so Christlike in our

[2:32:40] sins but the church commits
[2:32:43] sin the church is who does wrong gets a
[2:32:46] wrong thought wrong impression make
[2:32:48] Scruples wobble up like a child trying

[2:33:03] Brown
[2:33:05] notice Jesus says sanctify them Father
[2:33:07] by thy truth Thy word is truth after
[2:33:10] they were
[2:33:11] Sanctified he asked them to T in the
[2:33:14] city of Jerusalem Luke 24:49 until they
[2:33:18] were endured from on high am in other
[2:33:20] words they were Sanctified then uper
[2:33:26] room he said the devil don't okay how
[2:33:28] loud you holler the devil don't care how
[2:33:29] much you jump how much you can do this
[2:33:31] that and Shout What Hurts The Devil is
[2:33:33] to see a Sanctified holy life
[2:33:35] consecrated to God say anything to him
[2:33:38] call him anything just as sweet as can
[2:33:39] be move right on that throws him away
[2:33:41] that's the Thunder that shakes the
[2:33:45] devil if he could preach like Billy
[2:33:46] Graham devil laugh at that he said
[2:33:49] sometime the devil just laugh at that he
[2:33:50] don't he don't pay more attention to
[2:33:52] that like nothing he said you could have
[2:33:54] all the theology all the Seminary
[2:33:55] training the devil just sit back and
[2:33:57] laugh but when he sees that lifeall oh
[2:34:01] praise the name of the Lord praise God
[2:34:03] do you believe that second Timothy 2 19
[2:34:06] to 21 nevertheless the foundation of the
[2:34:08] Lord standeth sure having the seal the
[2:34:11] Lord knoweth them that are his and let
[2:34:13] everyone that nameth the name of Jesus
[2:34:15] Christ depart from iniquity and iniquity
[2:34:18] is when you know to do right and doing
[2:34:20] wrong you know it's iniquity that's
[2:34:22] iniquity from inside your heart you have
[2:34:23] to ask God take that out of me cleanse
[2:34:25] that from inside of me you have to do it
[2:34:27] now you have to do it today praise God
[2:34:29] you don't want to trim your tree of
[2:34:32] sin because all the leaves will go back
[2:34:36] we want to get it at the very Roots do
[2:34:38] you hear that God has not called for the
[2:34:40] pruning of the tree of
[2:34:43] sin but in a great house here we go
[2:34:46] there are not only vessels of gold and
[2:34:48] silver but also of wood and of Earth
[2:34:50] some to honor some to dishonor if a man
[2:34:54] bride are you getting me if a man

[2:34:58] himself the pastor to purge you if a man
[2:35:02] therefore Purge himself from these he
[2:35:04] shall be a vessel unto honor so you
[2:35:07] cannot go by your predestination you
[2:35:08] cannot go because God elected you you
[2:35:10] cannot go because you believe the
[2:35:11] prophet and you believe Malachi 4 and
[2:35:13] you have a book and all he said all as

[2:35:16] that amen amen
[2:35:20] P
[2:35:21] yourself is not an automatic thing you
[2:35:24] see how far off the mark people are
[2:35:28] talking about that their bride they
[2:35:30] going
[2:35:32] nowh if a man therefore Purge himself
[2:35:34] from these he shall be a vessel unto
[2:35:36] honor Sanctified meat for the Master's
[2:35:40] use prepared for every work praise the
[2:35:44] name of the Lord Bible talk about water
[2:35:46] blood and spirit these trees agree in
[2:35:48] one what that means you could be
[2:35:50] justified without being Sanctified you
[2:35:52] can be Sanctified without having the
[2:35:54] Holy Ghost oh praise the name of the
[2:35:55] Lord praise God hallelujah praise God
[2:35:57] are you seeing it now so that devil come
[2:36:00] into the message with Baptist Doctrine
[2:36:01] when you believe it you have
[2:36:08] it I'm on home Str
[2:36:11] now page 15 that mean we have five more
[2:36:13] page P
[2:36:15] 20 Ezekiel 18:4 says behold All Souls
[2:36:19] are
[2:36:20] mine as the soul of the father so also
[2:36:23] the soul of the son is mine the soul
[2:36:26] that sinth it shall
[2:36:28] die God said All Souls are mine Ezekiel
[2:36:33] 18:20 the soul that sinth it shall die
[2:36:37] the son shall not bear the iniquity of
[2:36:39] the father neither shall the father bear
[2:36:41] the iniquity of the son the
[2:36:43] righteousness of the righteous shall be
[2:36:44] upon him and the wickedness of the
[2:36:47] wicked shall be upon him pray praise
[2:36:51] God so God sees what he
[2:36:54] sees God cannot stand on
[2:37:00] clean that is why he lives under
[2:37:03] Holiness that is why when the fire hit
[2:37:06] Isaiah he B wo is me I'm a man of undone
[2:37:09] I'm a man of unclean
[2:37:10] lips because God is
[2:37:13] Holy he's not the Prime Minister he's
[2:37:16] not the president he's not the teacher
[2:37:18] or the principal of the school he is
[2:37:27] God so unclean is the opposite of
[2:37:34] Holiness I
[2:37:37] want this one this one was quite
[2:37:40] striking Genesis 4 Adam knew his
[2:37:44] wife of time he had can and Abel we know
[2:37:47] verse three of Genesis 4 in process of
[2:37:50] time it came to pass that Cain brought
[2:37:52] the fruit of the ground and offering
[2:37:53] unto the
[2:37:54] Lord verse four of Genesis 4 and he also
[2:37:59] brought Abel brought the first one of
[2:38:01] his flock and the Lord had respect unto
[2:38:04] Abel and his offering so the boys are no
[2:38:06] longer boys they're men now and God I
[2:38:09] want you to worship me one bought plants
[2:38:11] fruits whatever or one what blood from
[2:38:14] the first of the flock unto Cain and his
[2:38:17] offering he had not respect remember I
[2:38:20] just told you God have his thoughts
[2:38:21] about
[2:38:22] respects this is how it demonstrated
[2:38:24] here Cain was very rough very angry his
[2:38:28] countenance fell so it was showing he
[2:38:31] wasn't like you know I mean smiling
[2:38:32] normal normal he he was falling count
[2:38:35] hear this now verse six and the Lord
[2:38:38] said unto King why at thou
[2:38:41] R why is thy countenance Fallen if thou
[2:38:45] doest well shall not thou be accepted
[2:38:49] if thou doest not well here we go
[2:38:53] sin lith at the
[2:38:57] door and unto thee shall be his desire
[2:39:01] and thou shall rule over
[2:39:03] him so God is almost come like God War
[2:39:07] King
[2:39:09] King King if if you're doing wrong S at
[2:39:12] the door you
[2:39:13] know you don't have to let them get
[2:39:16] you you don't have to let them bite you
[2:39:19] near you it's right by your door look at
[2:39:22] the next verse and Cain talked with his
[2:39:25] Able's brother came to pass when they
[2:39:26] were in the field Kain rose up against
[2:39:28] his brother and slew
[2:39:30] him God just talk to the man and say
[2:39:35] sin lying at the door
[2:39:39] friends sin does move you
[2:39:43] know sin do snatch people you
[2:39:47] know and sin could be lying
[2:39:51] right at your
[2:39:54] door and the Lord s to King where is
[2:39:57] brother he said I am I know
[2:39:59] not am I My Brother's Keeper this dust
[2:40:03] man talking to the god of
[2:40:05] Heaven that he don't know he just
[2:40:09] G but this is the cap one that I want to
[2:40:12] get to Esther chapter 2 we want to read
[2:40:16] from verse one Vash with his show
[2:40:19] feminine rights she want to go to she
[2:40:21] husband and she playing the fool reading
[2:40:23] all them feminine magazine all them wom
[2:40:25] power
[2:40:26] thing the king had enough of
[2:40:29] that they say if we let her get away
[2:40:31] that every wife in the Kingdom go start
[2:40:33] to act just like vashi get rid of that
[2:40:36] woman and Esther chapter 2 begins and
[2:40:38] and these things when the wrath of King
[2:40:40] Asar was appeased remember vashi what
[2:40:43] she had done and was decreed against her
[2:40:46] then said the king servants that
[2:40:47] minister to him let there be feir young
[2:40:48] virgins sought for the king so they try
[2:40:50] to get new women young virgins let the
[2:40:53] king appoint officers skip down to verse
[2:40:55] four let the maiden which pleases the
[2:40:57] king be Queen instead of Vash and the
[2:41:00] thing pleased the king and he did so my
[2:41:04] God
[2:41:06] hallelujah all
[2:41:10] right and there's okay verse five was
[2:41:13] morai the Jew all right let's skip down
[2:41:15] now so Mori right verse seven and he
[2:41:18] brought up hadassa that is Esther his
[2:41:20] uncle's
[2:41:22] daughter for she had neither father nor
[2:41:24] mother so this was a caring
[2:41:26] man and the maid was fair and beautiful
[2:41:29] whom Mori when her father and mother was
[2:41:31] dead took for his own daughter so it
[2:41:33] came to pass when the king's commandment
[2:41:35] and his decree was heard that many
[2:41:37] maidens were gathered together into
[2:41:39] shushan the palace to the custody of
[2:41:40] Hagi that Esther was brought also to the
[2:41:43] King's house to the custody of hegi
[2:41:45] Keeper of the woman and the Maiden
[2:41:47] pleased him and she obtained kindness of
[2:41:49] him and he speedily give her things for
[2:41:54] purification is the part I want to get
[2:41:57] so in other words it wasn't like if the
[2:41:59] king put away vashti and you pretty
[2:42:01] girls are around oh she looking
[2:42:03] pretty look pretty one coming no the ton
[2:42:07] of them was
[2:42:08] pretty but now they had to go through
[2:42:12] process you know how long the process
[2:42:14] was was 12
[2:42:17] months 12 months before selection
[2:42:20] process let's go and the Maiden pleased
[2:42:23] him verse 9 and she obtained kindness of
[2:42:25] him and he speedily give her the things
[2:42:27] for purification which such things as
[2:42:29] belong to her seven maidens which were
[2:42:31] meat to be given her out of the's house
[2:42:33] and he preferred her and a maid unto the
[2:42:36] best places of the House of
[2:42:39] women Esther had not shown a people for
[2:42:42] her Kindred nor modai had charged her
[2:42:43] that she should not show it and morai
[2:42:45] walked every day before the court of the
[2:42:47] woman's house to know how Esther did he
[2:42:49] himself couldn't go in but there was
[2:42:51] somebody in charge of the woman and he
[2:42:52] would inquire of Esther verse 12 this is
[2:42:54] the part we going to get to and when
[2:42:56] every maid's turn was come to go into
[2:42:59] king hasus after she had been 12 months
[2:43:03] this is where I get it here from
[2:43:05] According to the manner of woman for so
[2:43:08] were the days of the purification
[2:43:09] accomplished to with six months with oil
[2:43:12] of M and six months with sweet orders
[2:43:16] with other things for the purifying of
[2:43:19] the
[2:43:20] woman so I am saying it have a ton of
[2:43:24] soal
[2:43:26] bride or church call them woman but
[2:43:31] there's a
[2:43:32] process that when you come through this
[2:43:34] process you're supposed to be smelling
[2:43:41] good because you see have to see
[2:43:44] Jesus you have to begin to see Christ we
[2:43:47] too far down the road to see
[2:43:57] you so this want to get
[2:44:00] that so Esther was taking on The King
[2:44:02] House in his house Royal in the 10th
[2:44:04] month which is the month of tith in the
[2:44:07] seventh year of his Reign and the King
[2:44:08] loved Esther above all the wom and she
[2:44:11] obtained grace and favor in his sight
[2:44:13] more than all the virgins so that he set
[2:44:15] the Royal Crown upon her head and made
[2:44:16] her Queen is vashi so I want to
[2:44:19] challenge you is it you going to a fight
[2:44:22] or you're reluctant to obey
[2:44:24] God what is your
[2:44:27] fight your F be
[2:44:33] me is it that you are going through a
[2:44:35] fight and people no going through and
[2:44:37] the pressure and the pressure and
[2:44:38] whatnot are you fighting up with
[2:44:40] yourself or are you really resisting to
[2:44:43] obey
[2:44:47] God consecration
[2:44:50] I have this here consecration for
[2:44:51] transation I'm going to close Mission
[2:44:53] come
[2:44:54] please 1 Thessalonians 43-5 says for
[2:44:57] this is the will of God even your
[2:45:00] sanctification that you should abstain
[2:45:03] from
[2:45:03] fornication and that every one of you
[2:45:06] should know how to possess his vessel in
[2:45:10] sanctification and honor so in other
[2:45:13] words you as a young sister should be
[2:45:17] interested how you supposed to be
[2:45:19] reflecting on your
[2:45:21] job how you supposed to be acting you're
[2:45:24] in a job with worldly people everybody
[2:45:27] they have the earring and the lipstick
[2:45:28] and everything else and the makeup and
[2:45:30] everybody who but you have to stand out
[2:45:33] different if you IR
[2:45:36] them look at what they have they pulling
[2:45:39] you in to their thing instead of you
[2:45:42] attract them into your thing because you
[2:45:45] don't know the value of your house it's
[2:45:48] time you
[2:45:54] valuation God sees you as his
[2:45:57] house and you can't put a value to God's
[2:46:00] house because God want to step into your
[2:46:02] shoes step into your dress step and put
[2:46:06] on your tie he wants to step inside your
[2:46:12] shoes for this is the will of God even
[2:46:14] your sanctification that you should
[2:46:15] abstain from fornication that everyone
[2:46:17] of you should know how to Poss possess
[2:46:19] his vessel in sanctification and honor
[2:46:21] not in lusp of cence even was a gentile
[2:46:24] which know not
[2:46:26] God the PS 37 says he made known his
[2:46:29] ways unto Moses his acts unto the
[2:46:32] children of men it's so unfortunate that
[2:46:35] when Moses came and BR the people to the
[2:46:38] mountain and he went up the mountain to
[2:46:40] seek God and while he's getting the Ten
[2:46:43] Commandments they ordering Aon to make
[2:46:47] golden Cal and some body find it was a
[2:46:49] brilliant idea bring your goal let's
[2:46:52] melt it and make a cal and they said
[2:46:54] this is be our God that brought us out
[2:46:56] of Egypt the god of heaven looking down
[2:46:58] at this foolishness that these bunch of
[2:47:01] people that come out of pharaoh saw all
[2:47:03] his acts but they don't know him Moses G
[2:47:07] for the word for the to get a concept of
[2:47:11] this God how he operates how he lives
[2:47:13] his nature his being all about him am at
[2:47:16] the end of it all we supposed to know
[2:47:18] all about about him not because a
[2:47:20] prophet say and Shar this know but
[2:47:22] because of the experiences that God has
[2:47:24] helped us and take us through in our own
[2:47:26] lives that we could
[2:47:28] know who this God
[2:47:32] is Colossians 1 says for this

[3:17:56] amen and amen you may be
[3:17:59] seated so before I get to the
[3:18:01] announcements just for a few minutes
[3:18:04] last week Sunday we would have announced
[3:18:06] that we wanted to speak to the parents
[3:18:10] of the Sunday school and brother and I
[3:18:13] spoke so we I'm just going to do it to
[3:18:16] the general Church um dedicated to the
[3:18:19] parents of course and to the Sunday
[3:18:20] school program in general but certainly
[3:18:23] to put on record a few things that we
[3:18:25] want to get on the same page on uh for a
[3:18:28] few minutes before we get into the
[3:18:30] announcements so two Sundays ago uh had
[3:18:34] a meeting with the Sunday school team
[3:18:36] how many appreciate the Sunday school
[3:18:41] team and it is a sacrifice and I was
[3:18:44] sharing with them that
[3:18:47] the same way that a minister just can
[3:18:50] come to the pulpit and wing it it's the
[3:18:52] same way that we have to take a duty of
[3:18:55] care and responsibility to how we
[3:18:57] approach the Sunday school and the
[3:18:59] ministry and the responsibility of it
[3:19:02] and in having a conversation with the
[3:19:04] entire team we thought it fit and
[3:19:07] important to also have a conversation
[3:19:09] with the parents because it's two sides
[3:19:12] of the equation to make this work is for
[3:19:14] the same reason within the natural
[3:19:17] school system there's a PTA or parent
[3:19:20] Teachers Association where there are
[3:19:21] conversations between what parents are
[3:19:24] responsible for and what the teachers
[3:19:26] are responsible for so we went into a
[3:19:29] few things including clearly having a
[3:19:32] conversation and defining what our
[3:19:35] children must know before they move to
[3:19:37] the next stage in the program of the
[3:19:39] Sunday School Etc and ensuring that our
[3:19:42] children are equipped fully because the
[3:19:44] attack is intensifying and you can't be
[3:19:47] winging it in 2024 and Beyond you have
[3:19:49] to know what ground you're standing on
[3:19:51] you have to know what is the scriptural
[3:19:53] support for what we stand for what does
[3:19:55] the message say about certain things so
[3:19:58] we want to be very precise through every
[3:20:00] stage of the Sunday school and ult
[3:20:02] ultimately map out what graduation looks
[3:20:04] like throughout every stage of the
[3:20:05] Sunday school and into um the youth
[3:20:08] ministry as well and I shared a few
[3:20:10] scriptures with the Sunday School
[3:20:13] teachers and I want to share it with the
[3:20:15] entire church as well and these are
[3:20:17] scriptures that guide what we do but
[3:20:19] there are scriptures that you know even
[3:20:21] in line with what with preach this
[3:20:22] morning it it kepts it helps guard us
[3:20:25] and protect us and gives us a context
[3:20:27] within which we could firmly operate
[3:20:29] many of these scriptures we are familiar
[3:20:31] with I'm not going to read all that
[3:20:32] would I would have shared with them but
[3:20:34] certainly the objective of this is to
[3:20:37] ensure that the parents understand that
[3:20:40] they have a part to play in this thing
[3:20:42] I've always made the point that you know
[3:20:45] in the natural school system a parent
[3:20:47] could take the position at the the when
[3:20:49] a child goes to school that the teacher
[3:20:50] is responsible for the education of the
[3:20:52] child but the children who do well in
[3:20:54] school are the ones where the parents
[3:20:55] are involved in the process when they
[3:20:57] come home you ask them what's the
[3:20:58] homework you make sure it gets done Etc
[3:21:01] and there is this this issue of
[3:21:03] responsibility and blame that takes a
[3:21:06] position that well it's the Sunday
[3:21:08] school supposed to do it or the school
[3:21:09] teacher supposed to do it and the
[3:21:10] parents kind of pull themselves back
[3:21:12] many of times and statistically when we
[3:21:14] look at how the children perform form
[3:21:16] both in natural and in the Sunday School
[3:21:19] the children that shine are the ones
[3:21:20] where there's more support at home so
[3:21:23] Proverbs 226 familiar scripture train up
[3:21:27] a child in the way he should go and when
[3:21:29] he is old he will not depart from it
[3:21:31] this is the scripture that everyone
[3:21:33] should hold there to their hearts but as
[3:21:35] parents and as a church in general
[3:21:38] relook at this scripture there's an
[3:21:40] element of work in the process of
[3:21:43] training we talked about process BR
[3:21:45] Peach about process this morning so that
[3:21:47] training is not YouTube training it's
[3:21:49] not go Ando IT training it's an active
[3:21:51] participation in the process of training
[3:21:54] up a child in the way he should go and
[3:21:56] when he is old he will not depart from
[3:21:58] it and by virtue of the Sunday school
[3:22:00] program the teachers are committed to
[3:22:04] Preparing the courses the programs the
[3:22:06] training to help with this but the
[3:22:08] parents have a role to play in it as
[3:22:11] well Deuteronomy 6: 6-7 and these words
[3:22:15] which I command this day shall be in
[3:22:19] thine heart and thou shalt teach them
[3:22:22] diligently unto thy children so this is
[3:22:25] not just teaching to the children and I
[3:22:26] want us to understand that when you see
[3:22:29] children begin to go astray it is
[3:22:30] because the concern the Bel the care the
[3:22:33] knowledge because as simple as it is my
[3:22:35] daughter is in primary school now and
[3:22:37] she's coming back to me with Daddy they
[3:22:38] said this or they said this and and and
[3:22:40] she's questioning do we believe this and
[3:22:42] 5 years old and I'm and I'm saying if
[3:22:44] the questions are asked and the correct
[3:22:47] answers that presented in a year in two
[3:22:49] in three in five in 10 years we have a
[3:22:51] problem so the Bible says here in
[3:22:54] Deuteronomy 6:6 and these words which I
[3:22:57] command thee this day shall be in thine
[3:23:00] heart and thou shalt teach them
[3:23:02] diligently unto thy children and shall
[3:23:05] talk to them when thou sest in thine
[3:23:07] house so this is not Sunday school we're
[3:23:10] talking about now we're talking about
[3:23:11] the conversations that take place inside
[3:23:14] of the home and if we don't take take
[3:23:16] the care in our homes to have the right
[3:23:18] conversations to ask the questions there
[3:23:21] are questions I ask my daughter when she
[3:23:23] comes home from school how was your day
[3:23:25] did anybody talk to you did anything
[3:23:27] happen let me know because I want to
[3:23:29] have the right conversations but here it
[3:23:31] is and I want to kneel this down just
[3:23:32] two or three scriptures to give a
[3:23:34] context of that balance between what we
[3:23:37] expect our children to come to church to
[3:23:39] learn and the work that takes place
[3:23:41] every single day of the week because
[3:23:44] they're here for one day two days or a
[3:23:46] week that's it but 7 days a week 5 days
[3:23:49] they in school they're getting hours and
[3:23:50] hours of communication in the school
[3:23:53] words from the teachers and the teachers
[3:23:55] are anointed and inspired yes and if we
[3:23:58] let the teachers in the natural school
[3:24:00] system just talk to them for six seven
[3:24:02] hours or whatever and share seeds to
[3:24:03] them they're going to come back every
[3:24:05] day and we have to go and dissect and
[3:24:07] impact and these are the things that
[3:24:08] cause issues so I want us to be very
[3:24:10] sensitive of the responsibility this is
[3:24:12] not saying the ministry do have a
[3:24:15] responsibility and the school have a
[3:24:16] responsibility but as parents what level
[3:24:18] of care and I'm repeating the word and
[3:24:20] these words which I command the I
[3:24:23] command thee this day shall be in thine
[3:24:26] heart and thou shalt teach them
[3:24:28] diligently unto thy children and shall
[3:24:31] talk to them when thou sest in thine
[3:24:33] house and when thou walkest by the way
[3:24:36] so you're going down the road you're
[3:24:37] driving in the car you whatever you do
[3:24:39] but but it's part of your conversation
[3:24:41] the conversation cannot always be the
[3:24:43] politics and the news and the media and
[3:24:45] the gossip but these words which I
[3:24:48] command thee this day shall be in thine
[3:24:50] heart so if it's not even in your
[3:24:52] parents' heart how could it be in your
[3:24:53] children's heart are you with me this
[3:24:56] morning so This Is Us calibrating and
[3:24:58] aligning because we want to create a
[3:25:01] situation where when they come to the
[3:25:02] Sunday school they're able to follow up
[3:25:04] on the last lesson they're excited
[3:25:06] because this has to be the excitement
[3:25:08] the excitement must be that you're not
[3:25:10] from here you you you want to go to
[3:25:12] heaven you want to make it to Eternity
[3:25:14] and and these are the principles here so
[3:25:16] these words which I command thee this
[3:25:17] day shall be in thine heart and thou
[3:25:19] shalt teach them diligently unto thy
[3:25:21] children and shalt talk to them when
[3:25:23] thou sest in thine house and when thou
[3:25:25] walkest by the way and when thou liest
[3:25:28] down and when thou risest up you see how
[3:25:32] much aspects it is so I want you this is
[3:25:33] your homework this evening parents and
[3:25:35] children Deuteronomy 6 ver 6-
[3:25:39] 7 2 Timothy 3:15 and that from a child
[3:25:43] thou Hast known the holy scriptures
[3:25:46] which are able to make thee wise unto
[3:25:48] salvation through faith which is in
[3:25:50] Christ Jesus so Paul in his conversation
[3:25:53] to Timothy is saying and that from a
[3:25:54] child thou has known the holy scriptures
[3:25:56] so we have a responsibility to take this
[3:25:59] parenting thing more
[3:26:01] seriously they are those who have gone
[3:26:03] out of our care they have grown old
[3:26:05] Ronaldo celebrating 18 years he's an
[3:26:08] adult so now he have to accept full
[3:26:10] responsibility sister Katy half of her
[3:26:12] responsibility done now he's a big man
[3:26:15] so he now have to hunt in the word for
[3:26:17] his stand but for those who are not
[3:26:19] adults who are under the care of homes
[3:26:21] and under the care of parents there's a
[3:26:23] great responsibility upon us to ensure
[3:26:26] that our children know the holy
[3:26:27] scriptures and they understand the
[3:26:29] message and they know what we believe
[3:26:30] can the church say
[3:26:32] Amen Psalms 11 1911 Thy word have I hid
[3:26:35] in my heart that I might not sin against
[3:26:42] thee I will stop with that for now and
[3:26:46] our Sunday school program officially
[3:26:48] starts for the year 2024 2025 next
[3:26:52] Sunday um the parents you should have
[3:26:54] all already received communication but
[3:26:56] for the church in general Sunday school
[3:26:58] officially starts next week Lord willing
[3:27:00] and our Sunday school program runs every
[3:27:03] term we should have a graduation
[3:27:05] ceremony as they move from stage to
[3:27:07] Stage we're excited to support them and
[3:27:09] most importantly you need to come on
[3:27:11] time it makes no sense that we are
[3:27:14] putting the resources in for Sunday
[3:27:16] school and you comeing in when you want
[3:27:17] to come
[3:27:18] in we are holding the teachers
[3:27:21] responsible for preparing the resources
[3:27:23] to teach them effectively and the very
[3:27:25] least you could do is ensure that they
[3:27:27] come on time so they could benefit from
[3:27:29] the teaching can the church say Amen
[3:27:31] this also helps you to come in time to
[3:27:33] also pray up for the service so they
[3:27:35] should be part and parcel of while they
[3:27:37] are in the Sunday School you praying for
[3:27:39] them because as bov said the devil has
[3:27:41] an agenda he wants to knock them out one
[3:27:43] by one he want to find a way to make the
[3:27:45] house lose value
[3:27:46] and we are here to make sure the house
[3:27:48] has value every service we come we want
[3:27:50] to add a paint we want to add something
[3:27:51] we want to add word upon word line upon
[3:27:54] line precept upon precept until your
[3:27:56] house becomes so valuable the devil say
[3:27:57] I can't afford this thing because it
[3:27:59] already been paid for it paid for with a
[3:28:00] price can the church say Amen so may the
[3:28:03] Lord richly bless you Sunday school team
[3:28:05] we love you we appreciate you you have
[3:28:06] our support do let us know for the
[3:28:09] repeat you know you know sometimes you
[3:28:11] there's why there's a reason that in the
[3:28:13] workplace there's a line in the book
[3:28:16] when people reach
[3:28:17] late and they signing registers and
[3:28:19] because if these things didn't exist the
[3:28:22] system that exist would fall so Sunday
[3:28:25] school I'm officially putting a let us
[3:28:26] know who coming late and missing the
[3:28:28] whole class all the time and going be
[3:28:29] last two minutes so we could have the
[3:28:31] conversation just like the schools would
[3:28:32] do because we really want the children
[3:28:34] to benefit and we want at the end of the
[3:28:36] term they know something that they could
[3:28:37] stand up and say I learned this I learn
[3:28:39] this scripture I learn this quote and
[3:28:40] know this story understand how this
[3:28:42] connected and they are in a position to
[3:28:44] stand can the Church Say Amen
[3:28:47] wonderful so now let me get to the
[3:28:49] announcement can we give a hands clap
[3:28:51] one more time for the Sunday school team
[3:28:53] as well as for the
[3:28:54] [Applause]

[3:29:09] a.m. which is which is which if you
[3:29:12] really studied that you're supposed to
[3:29:13] be here hour before the service
[3:29:17] we already have no excuse to be bringing
[3:29:19] our young children late for Sunday
[3:29:20] school so 9:45 a.m. sharp our Sunday
