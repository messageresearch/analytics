[30:16] testifying god be with them
[30:23] of it is inspired that people
[30:27] have opportunity to testify and we're
[30:29] appreciate that we're not worthy of that
[30:31] but we uh we say we're unworthy but
[30:34] we've been called to say something
[30:38] just share something
[30:40] i know that each one of you have a
[30:41] testimony but god wanted me to or wanted
[30:45] us to speak
[30:47] here
[30:48] i am i'm not born in a christian family
[30:53] i
[30:54] was not a christian
[30:56] but i met with the men's siege and i was
[30:58] baptized in 1997.
[31:01] you know brother
[31:02] this message is not
[31:05] catholicism it's not catholic this is
[31:07] the thought of god that was spoken in
[31:09] this end time we're living in
[31:11] and the devil will always attack what is
[31:14] from the lord
[31:16] that's why young people you must be
[31:17] strong
[31:19] the what i just read in the book of
[31:21] joshua when god spoke to joshua after
[31:23] moses died he said trafficking yourself
[31:26] be strong and take this
[31:28] book of the law turn not on left on on
[31:31] on right
[31:33] if you do that you will prosper whatever
[31:36] you do are not coming it's messy to have
[31:39] a good position in the church
[31:42] neither to be a follower
[31:43] because
[31:45] you must know what you believe this
[31:48] message and very soon when i was going
[31:50] to school and i believe this message i
[31:53] was so
[31:54] uh sunk into the message that can wake
[31:56] up early in the morning at 5 00 a.m
[31:59] praying and testifying the word of god
[32:01] everywhere at worst at school
[32:04] and when i get
[32:05] in my class
[32:07] i
[32:08] i will pray five
[32:10] three or five minutes and then say i
[32:12] commit the day to the lord not because i
[32:16] was afraid for the uh of a demon but i
[32:18] wanted
[32:19] everybody to know
[32:21] that i am a christian because everywhere
[32:24] you display yourself
[32:27] they will respect you and then at work
[32:30] don't be afraid to show who you are just
[32:32] imagine
[32:33] if the president of this country was my
[32:36] father what would i do
[32:38] everywhere i go i will say this
[32:40] president is my father i will just now
[32:44] imagine the great god of heaven the
[32:46] creator of heaven and earth the man whom
[32:50] who established the president is my
[32:53] father
[32:54] and the bible said that we are a
[32:56] stranger and peregrine on this spirit if
[32:58] you send your
[33:00] son to a foreign country do not leave
[33:02] him alone amen
[33:05] you're not going to leave him alone
[33:07] if there's something he'll call you
[33:09] amen to tell you daddy there's something
[33:12] wrong
[33:14] i need money i need this or that
[33:17] how much more how god will place us on
[33:21] this earth where he knows that the devil
[33:23] has come down
[33:24] in revelation 12 the bible said the
[33:26] devil came down on earth he was chased
[33:29] out he was kicked out from heaven
[33:32] because when he found no room in heaven
[33:34] and it is
[33:35] on his earth you think that god will
[33:37] leave you alone with the devil knowing
[33:38] all this going on when you you take your
[33:41] son somewhere in foreign country you
[33:44] expect him to call you when he have
[33:46] problem you can have a problem of
