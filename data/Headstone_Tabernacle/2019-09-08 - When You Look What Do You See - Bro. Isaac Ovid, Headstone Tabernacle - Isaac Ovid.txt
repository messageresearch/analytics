go on maybe catch a clearer vision of who we are merely catch a clear vision of what we are born to do maybe catch a clear vision of who you are maybe catch a renewed vision may you live the scales

spirit on our control for the honor and glory of Almighty God Father if there's a visitor minor myths of backsliding or missus ciller and omits me they come to know you by power and by experience and by revelation me you bless the word and the reading of the word we commit this service into your hands and the church says amen and amen I greet you this morning in a precious name of Jesus I'd like to read the scriptures and then I'll give my greeting this morning so I'd like to go to four portions of scripture reading Jeremiah 5 proverbs 29 sin John 3 and revelation 1 Jeremiah 5 and verse 20 declare this in the house of Jacob and publish it in Judah seeing here now this or foolish people and without understanding with her eyes and see not which have he ears and hear not je not me saith the Lord will inna tremble at my presence which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree a perpetual is a continuous decree that it cannot pass it and though the waves thereof toss themselves yet can they not prevail though they roar yet can they not pass over it but this people have a revolting and rebellious heart dear revolted and gone neither see they in their heart let us now fear the Lord our God that give a dream for the former and the laughter in his season he reserved it unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest reading proverbs 29 and verse 18 where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he sin John 3 and verse 1 there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with him jesus answered and said unto Him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God and our last reading revelation 1 reading from verse 1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John who bare record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written beer in for the time is at hand John to the seven churches which I need your grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the Dead and the Prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and it made us kings and priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion for ever and ever amen behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all Kindred's of the earth shall wail because of him even so amen may the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated even so I greet you this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ it's certainly a great privilege to be in the house of God are you happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning amen and what a time and a season and I have not been here for about two weeks which is a rare very rare occurrence it's very uncomfortable to not be in the house of God not because you're a religious person but because there's something that pulls you to the word and to fellowship and the communion and being with the Brethren and in fellowship but I had responsibilities new responsibilities a new ministry present stage of my ministry so I'm really happy to be here and bring greetings from my wife and my daughter and both Karen and the baby are doing fine and it is it is new it is different no amount of books could prepare you for this no amount of advice could prepare you for this you know why I attended the Lamaze classes that did not prepare me for this i sat with my father many times that did not prepare me for this in in comfort they tell you every experience is different so that's how you come for yourself well my rule is different you know but it was a interesting experience because I had the opportunity to be in a labor room and I was saying to her Ovid afterwards i see you know you read a quote where the prophet talks about a laborer is a boot boot ISA as a messy thing and how did she grow into their labor pains they get tremendous sometimes and as and as preachers you read these quotes and you could identify with it but being in the labor room these tremendous times thinking a whole different perspective you see what really how how serious it is and and and there the nurse said something that struck me and she said because the labor that Karen had to go to us was quite long and I said to her accordingly because you have to work because you have to work and I'm there and I'm trying to be an encouragement and I'm a support and but it still work and as much of words and encouragement that you could put in there I couldn't do the work that she had to do and I realized that many times we come to church every round I would talk about appreciated get blue in the face but they still a work that that you have to do because the minister is doing his work but you still have to go to your labor pin you still have to go through the process you still have to go through the mess there's no shortcut there's no bypassing it it is just the way God designed it to be at one point Karen said to me Brina do something pretty do something do something so I'm there and I'm conflicted because my mind goes back to in Pina have childhoods so it's like how do you pray because God instituted the Pina Capri funny people to go away because they you can circumvent the process so then we pray become God give me the strength to impure and many times through our trials we say Lord take the pain away but God they're breaking the rule because I fell I told at one point and say Karen please just plain easy but you can't bypass the process the process is the process but then as the time was cooking now remember the prophets see when the woman is about to have put a sweet spirit comes down and an angel from the presence of God drops down to clean this life you remember that so I'm a witness to this transition that took place to see this sweet spirit come down and just like enter this child and at that point I just broke down in tears Karen it was good I said you ever know but something happens to you I walked out the room and what came over me was a level of selflessness because I realized my life was even less about myself and more about others because I was know had a new responsibility all of a sudden I was ready to fight but never were in a fight before if anybody had come near that room he was in trouble because I had a new outlook a new responsibility a new attitude and when you think about how God feels when he calls you and he's working on you and when did ever try to mess with you the kind of emotion that he calls true because he stopped as father that anybody could ever have and the church here man hallelujah they may be seated so I may get in trouble for sharing all of this when I get back home but I love to let them know that I'm I was reported that high authority can the church say Amen so I have a very simple message this morning and before I even go into that I really how many appreciate but the riemann Thompson's two messages that we heard a man coming to church and I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord what what masterpiece of masterpieces hallelujah he was bustin left and right and it's the word outside of this process people want to bypass the process stay in home is not part of the process you know you have to come to be in the environment there's no perfection outside of coming to the ministry there's no perfection all said I have an apostolate pastillas people walking around talking about again perfected to go in which rapture why else would God say athletes pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the scenes feed the stream and perfec yourself God is a God of order so I really appreciate the messages and then how many appreciate by the Congolese they were like - I believe Wednesday night executions I was their connection as like wow contact were loving one time I say we need to use work Alyssa Moorman every gift of the vine is placing them there gives hiding in here and have to find that place to listen and you guide when cadre to call you Gideon there doing his own thing quiet no mining is business and go say Gideon mighty man of Valor I didn't say yes Lord you say who me so only who means in the church God is coming to knock on your door because you have a part to play before we leave this please the devil may try to write you off but you have a part to play and if you have a part to play the devil does not Bharati you may be seated I'm a little bit what a message on Wednesday nights my my my my my what a masterpiece of a masterpiece for groups which one if you haven't heard that message me to hear it again and again if you heard it listen it again and again because you got to know which group you belong to because he spoke about a group I don't know about you but I can speak for me he spoke about a cool names I even be removed who names are irremovable get names copy blotted out kind of the eeriest Oh though he slay me yet still I trust him I could go to child's I can go to test him I could go to ups and downs but my name is on that book and because my name is on that book the devil better be scared the devil better be scared because God had to place a power in me to stand in such a time Isis and the church Amon o mine three may be seated so I have a encouragement for you this morning and I believe will be a blessing to you it's a message that I talked about over this morning because you didn't know what thought I had I told him this is a message you preached a long time ago you push it in chi wall so I can't remember it but if we shouldn't kind of walk many years ago and then I believe I took the same text or wrong 9899 around this so the Lord placed it on my heart to bring it back this morning so for a title when you look what do you see when you look what do you see and I read a number of scriptures to build a context because Jeremiah spoke of people who had eyes but they could not see and by the time you reach the book of Revelation they said all eyes will see and by the Brandon brought to our understanding that the words see that Jesus used when Nicodemus walked up to him was not to see with visualize but it was to understand so there's a difference between having sight and having vision is the difference between looking and actually seeing can the church say Amen without a vision the people perish if you don't have a vision for your life your vision for your house of vision for your marriage a vision for your business a vision for your career a vision for what you do when you wake up you will Paris and Paris thing is not just death in the natural that is perishing of your dreams perishing of your of what's inside of you because without a vision you cannot achieve anything and the church is hey man you can have eyes and have no vision or you can have no eyes and have a vision can the church say man there are many examples that I mentioned this morning I've used this before there were two salesmen who went somewhere to sell shoes but whoever has mentioned many times and one guy saw that nobody had shoes he looked at the situation he looked at the market he said nobody has shoes I cannot sell to these people they don't wear shoes and he went back to the boss and the boss I feel these people told wear shoes I've come back home we need to find another market I'm not as here's one mental scheme area look at the same situation and it's like these people to rent shoes I can sell everybody they looked at the same situation they looked at the same condition they looked at the same problem and they left with two different conclusions and that's how life is we look and what do you see Oh hallelujah can the church amen and the question of what we see is also asking another question what don't you see and that's a deeper question when you look what do you see is also asking a deeper question when you look what don't you see and I would venture to tell it's not just morning your success lies in what you do not see your failures also lie and what you do not see I don't have as much experience and by the way but I have done a few weddings and I've never met a couple coming up to the altar who don't believe they have seen everything enough to convince them that this is the best decision to me sometimes only years later they say no I didn't really see and if I'd only seen what I see no hmm if it wasn't for you would let's not go there this morning all of your success lies and what you do not see all of your failures lie and what you do not see because if you know that there's a ditch day and you do any of you know and you go into denies your fall you can't even call that failure because you make a choice to go to the dish but if you do not see there's a bottle and you're driving at night and you didn't see the pothole and you hit it and you're mash of the car you didn't see it you're feeling alive and the fact that you did not see the pothole that was there so it is important to be able to look for the right thing I'll give you another example can we just talk a little bit most people and I was sharing but over that in in Joshua is a medikit underwood day a night that merit it doesn't mean reader that merit it is spend time with it and you're thinking in your heart you're meditating you're trying to figure out how it applies you meditate and that's a problem most of us because if you think long enough about your situation you'll make better decisions most people don't think to fire a lot bicha step toward Sodom and what he did not see was the effect on his family when not looked at Sodom he saw opportunity he saw business prosperity he saw he didn't expect to end up in trouble he didn't expect to lose his wife when he looked he did not see his wife not coming out with him somebody help me preach this morning that Sodom didn't think he was gonna lose some of his daughters the men who lived in Sodom when you knocked this morning what do you see when the British Empire went into India there was a problem with the king cobra to sneak they had a meeting the Solent said let's have a plan to deal with these snakes that are around the villages so they came out with a very good idea let us tell the villagers for every snake they kill we'll give them a little bit of money plan and started the villagers keep bringing snakes dead snake collect money dead snake collect the money and then somebody will just say Whitner if we kill out all these things we will have no more money to get the British didn't see how this was going to unfold so the villagers started building cages and raising king cobra snakes mine in them so they had a distribution line from a nice snake farm trudi British bring in this snake and collect any money so the bridge is same but with knotty population has gone now but this economy seems to me it seems to be a tribe in economy when they realized what was happening they made another decision let us stop paying them for these things so the villagers say why are we mining all these things if nobody's gonna give us money from my name is six so the villagers did what they release or listenings so the net effect of the first decision to the final conclusion was an actual doubling of distinct population and the point of this is when the British sat down to plan out this they did not see what the second-order and third-order consequences have to or will be I'm gonna say a few things this morning we're gonna get into the courts and suffer worry but I've seen a lot of men in the message in church make what I call selfish decisions not thinking about their families I'm not thinking of the second-order consequences of decision that they may be called intensify enough when you look what do you see this one and it depends on what you are looking for Samson did not see what was going to unfold when he started messing around with Delilah he did not see his eyes being removed he didn't see it if he did he would not have done it if you know the trouble you are gonna end up in half the stuff that you have done or in right now you get out of it so fast but it's because we don't see where it's gonna end up we continue to do nonsense until it gets too late and the reality is as the book of Revelation says eventually you'll see you to them but when you do see it it could be too late because it's easy to see everything in hindsight it's easy to see but I see I went wrong there see I went wrong there see you went wrong there see you ever and you can look at the past and talk about what went wrong but what are you doing now and have you thought about what happens when you don't pray in the morning because that has consequences have you thought of what happens when you don't spend enough time with your family have you seen the effect of it or will you have to wait for five years and see well is when you know I see what you was talking about anybody in the house this morning when you look what do you see we make most of our decisions based on what we see and somehow we try to filter what we can't see or can't understand and make me push it to the side because we don't want to deal with it so we have people who want to go into business they only tell you what could go right this is how much money we could make this is how we could grow this way and they do at the top of what you go wrong but if you could understand what you go wrong it will equip you to make a better plan anybody in the house would be this morning [Applause] we are often surprised when we realize we did not see something before and it's not just in the natural this is also in a spiritual and we gonna get it up in a bit for the world to make sense to ask me we filter many things out we are afraid to confront the reality of ourselves other people God or walk with God and we accept what we think to be okay because we'd already see the consequences and the potential consequences can the church say Amen when you look this morning what do you see do the names Shinhwa Shafaat ego party gari el gari mal settle Nabi I'm Gil ring a bell to anybody this morning that's it one more time do the name Shamu I Shafaat Eagle party Gary Gary I'm al said to not be unreal ring a bell anybody anybody you know who these men are you know these men you may not know that name but you know them because they were leaders in the Bible in it you don't remember their names because they looked at something and saw all the wrong things Helen Keller who was buying you remember Helen Keller was once axe is there anything worse than not having your sight and she said yes there is it's having sight but having no efficient these men's names and I just read are not well-known today because each of them had great sight but they had no vision anybody knows who I'm talking about yet the children of Israel had just left Egypt they are heard about this Promised Land for a long time they are heard about how good Island is there's everybody milk and me honey I'm get heard about all the possibilities of the land I'm just at the point when they were supposed to enter in they came together to a point 12 liters 12 of these Sharples soldiers 12 of the best men from each tribe didn't pick people who were not solid any wood and then pick people who were backsliders to pick the best out of 12 tribes those 10 names I called Willie 10 men from me 10 tries that went with Joshua and Caleb and all 12 went and tcd groups all 12 went and eat of the milk and honey all 12 came back and City land is good but 10 an emergency listen riccati when we look at it we see too much enemies we see too much diets we see too much problems we see too much obstacles we not see any land and I'm gonna know but the problems are too much the battle is gonna be too fierce we can take it on trust for who spend more time because a long time they eat grapes like this it's been a longer time is a long time they then have this come back late in time to see the people depressed and they say wait a minute what does he cry I hear inside of here we are more than able to go up right now we don't need we'd ever need to get ready we go up right now we are able to go up right now we went through too much to reach here to go back now we are ready we are we're able to go up right now and this for what the others did not see when you look this morning do you see the possibility of revival when you look this morning are you looking at your problems and your situations who are you looking at what God said because just one he left this for the land they saw the evidence and the nothing was gonna move them and the church seemed and how I feel this morning I'm looking at holy enemy has pushed people back against the wall but I don't see that I'm looking at it but I see you stronger than you realize I look and I see some of your children nothing here but I'm not seeing that I'm seeing them being deliver I'm seeing them being restored I'm so come on now Oh hallelujah hallelujah every day I'm looking I'm waiting to see the manifestation of this glorious gospel the world might look at you one way and you might even see yourself one way but we want to find out this morning how does God see us because if we could just see what God sees it'll change our whole perspective it'll change to walk it'll change our talk because God doesn't look the way we look God doesn't see the way we see because he knows the end and he knows the beginning and he knows what he did we're back before there was a moon we're back before there was a star and you wrote some names in the book when you look what do you see maybe you're not seeing everything this morning but from the word may your spiritual eyes open up that you can see what I'm seeing and you can see what a prophet saw somebody say man you may be seated Oh in the Bible one time the Syrian army we're having a hard time dealing with it universe regular story whenever they made a plan brother Anthony to attack Israel somehow Israel always knew where they were coming from Israel knew what direction they were coming from Israel knew how many people they were coming with Israel knew what weapons they were bringing nothing seemed to be working to be able to see Israel and the king of Syria so what is going on is this somebody among us who is going and tell the children of Israel what our plans are you know the story and this is your majesty I get to break the news to you I don't know how we getting around this one over this one this one we never had to deal with this before but whenever we have a planning meeting a strategy meeting to take out it's showing of Israel there's a profit in the land named Elijah he has the ability to step into this room and see what's going on and no weapon that we could ever use ever form a spark and stem and I want to tell you this morning when I wasn't ever gathers his demons man against you there's an angel on the ground who is able to cause that ring somebody please back to me somebody please watch for me this morning and you know what you may be seated they couldn't see Lysa when he was moving through their meeting room they couldn't see Lysa when he was taking notes or so this is where you're coming from and this is how you want to take me out and this is what he's trying to do he likes her couldn't be seen but God open his eyes so he can see what was going on that's why the Bible can say no weapons for against you could ever prosper somebody please flat to me this morning you may be seated the definition of strategy is away systematically and deliberately move from point A to point B with the objective of solving a problem it is incomprehensible to me if the Syrian army is dealing with an enemy who could see the plans and the best plan that they can come up with is let us go and kill him every man seeing all your plans you listen you see a common but totally blind literally blind so the Syrian army leaves information after defeat after defeat after defeat after defeat after defeat they have nothing on this video record the completely defeated record but it's still coming that's what the devil is no defeat after defeat buddy still coming until he came to Sunday morning maybe like this one and I don't know I don't know what it was Elijah woke up he likes a stretch Elijah turn on the stove and put some water to boil he was feeling some coffee with prema and some other up [Music] Elijah's had to put crack some eggs and cut up some Tomatoes to make an omelet and he knows what happening but this one move a man of God he's had to turn me up left open turn it around make sure that with me please in the meantime as little servant boy Joe has he come running inside Massa Massa master the horse of Syria outside he likes a cheetah on that one more time put it on and split kicks fix this napkin some people need to eat with napkin later maybe fix this napkin I'm chasing why not upset why not getting agitated you don't want to eat afterwards you say Lord open up this boy hands go ahead look again and tell me tell me you see because I can see what you're not seeing that's why I could I can feel this way this morning that's why I can worship just way this morning because I've seen what you cannot see when you look this morning what do you see Church of the Living God and that boy ran outside and this speed here on out here unbroken he realize they are for us I don't know where they come from I don't know who they are but they are on our side there are more for us than against us and the church say man I pray this encourages you this morning when you look what do you see what do you see this morning I am encouraged and I'm compelled to tell you I don't care what you have done how God sees you it's different from how your husband sees you different mom how your wife sees you different my how your co-workers see you can we just talk this morning the Bible said Jesus had me it's passed by Samaria we know the story but I want to connect it this morning and he went before this woman came he didn't go by accident he went there because this woman's name her name her name was written in the book nobody knew it she didn't even know it and she chose to go at a time when nobody else was there she couldn't look at herself because she didn't feel good about herself she was bothered by how people looked at her how do I know you may be seated if she was not bothered by how people looked at her she would have gone when everybody else was but clearly it bothered her that she waited till the good people tell the church people tell the nice people will finish taking their water and when nobody else was looking because she was ashamed don't tell me she was ashamed she was ashamed Oh God but she moved to the water and she met a different kind of man a different kind of man a man who could see what she couldn't see me a man could see deeper than she could ever see and that man open the pies when you look what do you see this morning do you look at your physical condition and say this is my portion I'm sick or do you see the healing do you see the healing I was reading the profitable see any may be seated many times people come to the prayer line and after two days it gets worse you see that's when you have to see that the healing is in its way that's really gonna see that God is working its way up you've got to keep seeing with the spiritual eyes of it every decision has consequences seen an unseen seen and unseen but a better peace many messengers look into the unseen you know it put on spiritual eyes like Joe has a spiritual eyes to see what a natural eyes cannot see Jesus was tired so tired that they had to lift him and the Bible in the King James was used carried him to the boat and in the translation carried men physically lift I would you take a picture that for a minute the man who could break bread break fish and feed 5,000 the man who had stand at the grave of Lazarus and say Lazarus comfort was now so tired that he couldn't carry himself to the boat but the disciples had to physically lift Jesus have you been so tired at you fact that you had to be lifted Jesus was so tired that he had to the boat so tired that the devil tried to take a chance because Jesus had broken his pattern and I was heading towards the city of Gandhara which is over the water which was a city that the Jews never went to because it was a Gentile city was an unclean City they raised pigs in that city it was not a place at Peter and James and John and his brothers would have ever gone to but you said take me there and it was asleep because he was seeing what they could not see but Roman said something powerful reading from the Prophet about that group who would have access an opportunity because they treated the bride right I set about over this morning we don't know who Breit is so how could I take the risk of treating anybody bad it's too great of a risk the risk is too high don't risk is too high [Applause] that's why better man said I respect the garbageman I respect the milkman there are people in the message who don't want to talk to because they're unbelievers how you're not told you not know they're bright sometimes you have a witness come to people's houses and evening my son they run them vote for me I know they would you don't know that's bright at least they're going wrong testify and when less of you testified because the Prophet said if you don't testify you're find yourself back sitting you will not see it right now but that's the direction you're gonna get into if you can see what he sees he sees you back sitting because you're not testifying to anybody anybody in the house is Smalling [Applause] when you look what do you see this morning Jesus saw a man who had a legion his name was not Legion he had a legion of demons and Jesus saw beyond that a man who would tear his clothes off Jesus saw beyond his activity and saw into his heart saw into his need saw his cry when you look what do you see let's bring it closer to home the Bible doesn't tell us really what day it was but there was a group of people gathered I can imagine someone hiding in the shadows some were crying as they led Stephen into the courtyard to stone him for heresy blasphemy coming against the understanding of the wood that the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the e seems have possessed and they're presiding over this stoning this killing is a man who the Bible call of Pharisee of Pharisees whose name was soil a man of conviction a man so convinced that he was right he was willing to kill for it and he stood there looking at Stephen being killed Stephen looked up he said a few words and he died and I can imagine all the people who were there saw this man saw and I can imagine the emotions it this man killed deacon Stephen this man made the decision stood him to see how God has operate totally different from us God chose to not reveal to anybody who this man Saul was in fact the Prophet said on the road to Damascus as Saul was about to do more damage God interrupted soil with a pillar of fire and when everyone said the others around so didn't even see it to show that God is such an individual card with who he allows to see no one he said he hid it from the eyes of the wise and anybody in the house is snoring Bible goes on to see that when Saul became Paul and by the proper went brother Paul came to church you know they had a better real fight it was not your fight it was not like and God had to take them through the process and go ahead to elevate Paul's ministry to such an undefeatable level that those brothers who had witnessed this had to acknowledge it had to be good [Applause] I can imagine when Paul Lewis Camus it was never there so I had to try this bird see this right all kinds of thoughts would have gone through this brother no doubt Stephen had friends maybe family we don't know who save listen if so legacy spoiled but a soul boy I don't know what I wanna call him because I know he was like we caught meself all know when you'll is this all poor fella it just shows that an enemy time God is looking at this as a star in his hand before the foundation what is one of these stars in the right hand of God and the church people didn't know I believe is where the Terri was exhausting some time ago and he said but the Branham was standing in a pulpit and the minister said that they thought he was just another minister they were looking but what did they see when you come to church and when you look what do you see I'm not speaking a group nobody was an individual it doesn't matter who God places in the pulpit and for whatever time or how he uses them that's God he makes the call as I heard somebody seriously I'm just a mailman oh no this message is from God you have a problem in a message to infects with me I am just delivering I just deliver any package when the word say husband love your wife look FX with me why reverence your husband don't get next with me cheering obey your parents or their backs with me come to church on time dog FX should be this is just me delivering messages sending whatsapp messages to you to remind you of this journey that we on and you're supposed to be in the house of God dog FX with me and the church say Amen but when you look what do you see because if you want to see faults and mistakes it have plenty but the Raymond spoke about it you want to let your experience be based on what you see with somebody who is an unbeliever or a big believer and you do so turn off these church people is just people when you look what do you see when you look into the world how do you and I know because it's making your calling and your election show chemicals amen so we care for this morning with how you look at things and how you look at people can the church say Amen and be careful not just with what you see but what you don't see Samson did not see where his journey was going to end up he thought he could have played the game until he lost everything can the church same [Music] this is a message Rita ponder and to reflect when Goliath appeared King soil all of the Philistines they looked and they saw and what this looked and this or send them into an immediate fetal position all of the trained men curl up turn their backs they will not seen him in so much of her forty days he coming out this in what happened to these people send me one man to fight me and everything every night when identical look they could see him at me you you wanna go you wanna go King Saul himself didn't wanna go when David came to them he looked as if he wasn't fit to be in the army but about him said that he come to bring reasons but about him said to his brothers and delivered his reasons and him he gave him his reasons and they run him they say who my name is sheep we're doing here because they didn't see him as a chastity enemy didn't see much and that's yes testing about it just think about it they didn't even see David as a as a potential candidate to fight Goliath they say go back and do mine any sheep she can mine themselves go and see what he she dropped the raisins and go and David Satter walk back walk back walk

uncircumcised Philistine not only the uncircumcised philistine [Applause] [Music] David saw something totally different he said what can I do they say well listen go home why he is scared yeah he said

necklace is a it's a well prepared package God has blessed us with different gifts listen to Padova's mission on Wednesday night that was a Sunday message but God allowed it to be on Wednesday night this is just a little appetizer I was strong meat when you look what do you see genuine of Israel about to go into the Promised Land Jeffersons are two spies to go and look at Jericho and the only place they can find refuge is by the house of a harlot whose name was rehab when the people of Jericho looked at her she was a harlot this is not now describing her to believers this these are all even looking at her and seeing her as a harlot but because listen because she treated these men right [Applause] because she treated them right and give them logic when they had to have it give them refuge when they have to hand those men were in a position to give her life and say we can not come we coming but hang this red cord outside of your window and all our people know because when we came out of Egypt we were told about a red streak on all of our houses so they know what this means they know this means Redemption they know this means salvation this means them come on somebody help me this morning and not only that bring your family in with you it's to you and your children to them bring your family because when we come we wag not everything but for everything that's underneath this blood cord underneath this spoken yet shall not pass your me yet shall not come nigh thee how much I say man and I wonder maybe maybe because their chickens are believers they've never ever not been chickens the believers they left Egypt whole bunch of people I wanna kill a bunch of make it anyway thought I would listen the data like Egypt the order they do believe is I believe but it's coming out so they all left well George just thinking they were going through I was not alone nobody left Egypt saying I will die he will listen it is their unbelief and here is Benina that sentence and the decimal because God charged them all the 10 spies were judged for the evil report the people were judged for accepting the evil report above the promised would so that's my judgment will be getting this active area both to the preachers and people really received the preachers I was sharing with a minister last night I said the problem is that people follow ministries above the wood and that is the fatal flaw because at Universal they had the wood they had even scripts on Iran them spy just went to just confirm what he knew already you know it was a new information they were going to collect it was verification of can we go now or should we go tomorrow shall we go tonight exactly what time to resettle move things into the into our property that was the conversation so these people had the word didn't knew it was theirs and it's always embarrassing after God take it through the Red Sea after go take it true swim and wilderness and please and I've only reached not a doubt so I can imagine a certain like connect rehab back in this thing maybe there is somebody who has seen this Jerry Cole DD all they bring up any camp I'm not sure about it a you know he's like I don't know alright once she's there I'm here I'm good yes to let her come you know some people have you know church folk when they look they may have seen a lot of her resume or her job description or whatever it was but little did they know that this simple lady was gonna marry a general and out of her line was gonna be a man named obey who was gonna be got Jessie who was gonna have a man called dizzy and alter the line of David was gonna come one who would be called a messiah when you look what do you see how could you write off anybody I just became my poet when you look what do you see how could you write off anybody did know that I want this should give everybody encouragement this morning that if you are willing now listen carefully the issue is not God could yes yes 15 of you pass but you have to be willing to leave it there you can't continue down you're part of foolishness and expect God to keep blessing you the issue is this however colorful your past may have been he's able to turn it as white as snow if y'all wanted to repent and repent me to change your behavior the change you are thinking the change what you understand it what you see let's see what you go after canach it's a man there's a few one I'm done I'm not gonna be too long with you we know what Moses looked out the window where the man talked about it Pharaoh looked out the window and Pharaoh saw mud daubers but Moses or people that good rumen but there was something about them that just stood at his heart but till he couldn't take it no more when he looked what did he see from the message the 6-volt purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel this is where they've done it he was making an end of symptom how could he do anything else but forgive them talking about Jesus knowing that he had to blind the eyes talking with the Jews that we could come in it's like his own children calling for his blood and they were blinded and he knew they were blinded that's the reason he cried for forgiveness for them forgive them father they don't know what they're doing they were blind for our sick they were me blind so they were looking at Jesus and they couldn't even see that he was a fulfillment of every prophecy from any prophet that have gone us not because they were ignorant not because they were unlearned but God thinking of the grafting of the chan type branch blinded them blinded them so they could not see them so that we could see him he came for you he came for me in garden with all their sight to see who he was we wouldn't stand a chance we will have no hope in the world he would have come and gone and we would have not ever been but because of us he painted eyes of the Jews so that they wouldn't see him that they were mocking him I laugh at him and he include all of that for our sake for our sake for you and for me a few weeks ago I wrote down the words he came for me he came for me he came for me I wanted to say those words he came for me that's a revelation friends he came for me he blinded the eyes of the Jews at those spiritual men there were people who were looking for Messiah and when he walked in front of them they could not see him because he didn't want them to he said not yet not yet not yet not yet there are people that need to see me before I get on field and I'll cover your eyes I'll come back for you I come back to my people you are my people but there's another branch there's another people there's a Gentile group that I love them also and I can't put them all so the blood I shed is for you but it's for them also I need all up on you for a minute to go get them I came for them I came for you but I came for them what love what Greece oh Jesus better balance it in their unbelief they did it when they were crying for Jesus's blood it was their unbelief and their unbelief mustard even their fault it wasn't their fault God was hiding what was going on from them hiding what is going on from the devil hiding what is going on because of some individuals who weren't even born yet some individuals who never stood a chance because they were never born from the loins of Abraham but they will because seeds of Abraham they will not have his direct bloodline but it would be a spiritual bloodline they would be able to claim benefits they would be able to claim benefits Oh hallelujah when you look what do you see this morning do you see the sacrifice he made listen so I want to present to you two sacrifices this is not a doctrine now but Jesus sacrifice his son and he sacrificed his own people for our sake I wanted to register a minute friends he sacrificed his own son and he sacrificed his people even seeing him it must have been painful these were the people he had protected from Egypt to the promised land to the Babylonians and the Persians and the Medes and the Romans and the Greeks and he carried them through and when he finally arrived he said I can't let you see me in so much of a Nicodemus came and said what shall a man do he said unless you born again you cannot see the kingdom you can't even understand this you can't even experience this without a new birth God had the chest a handful of people to lay a platform for these church ages to unfold pizza James John all of them stood there what they were doing they were waiting for Paul to get into his place because he had been a messenger after for this age and gotta pick somebody out of the group that was around him who was that even connected with the group that was around him because his ministry was not to the people who around him he was to want to go to the Corinthians to the Ephesians somebody reached back to me this morning [Applause] and when our prophet Kim he said that Paul was the gold standard he said there was never a prophet like on the Paul when our prophet Kim he said that was the gold standard that was his tender for the Alpha Church and when our prophet Kim he was the greatest prophet to ever walk and he sent a message to tie up all the loose ends to bring up the closing of the Gentile dispensation and to hand the baton back to the shoes again oh come on now when you look at this great gospel what you see when you look how it's dripping with blood do you see the sacrifice that Jesus made for you and me do you see the sacrifice that Peter James trying to choose their families made for this bride to be where we are this morning it's not by chance it's not by accident but called so all of this unfold before you even born before you made a mistake before you fell in sin before you committed fornication before you fell into adultery before you knew who he was he knew your name before you knew his name he knew your name you see him but he could have seen you when you lock this morning what do you see [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] come on now come on now young brother young sister can you see what I see this morning I see chains breaking I see scales falling off of eyes and sworn [Applause] that's why the prophets and those who were crying for Jesus blood they will always forgive him that's why I said forgive them because they don't know what they're doing they don't understand they don't see what's happening they didn't know I had to put them on pause put them on pause for a while put them on pause for a while because I have to pick up this other group of people who didn't deserve it who did nothing to earn it but they are still my people what have you done to earn this this morning what have you done to ever deserve this just spawn it there's nothing we could do to deserve it and man we can just all sing the same song nothing but the blood of Jesus because if it wasn't for the blood we wouldn't stand a chance so why could I hold a horse or a grudge or hold your past against you because he's done holding my past against me he's not holding your past against you how could you hold your past somebody pass against them when he has already released them and Jesus said if you don't forgive I can't let you go he said your forgiveness it's depending on how you forgive others you hear that I'll see it one more time he said hope he said if you don't forgive how could your father never forgive you so you wanna feel release release others and feel the release release feel the relief as you release your wife release your children release your boss release the tickle who put in a seat they don't wanna be in release your neighbour release your father release your mother release release the unbeliever the stranger release release it all this morning and watch the release of God made possible by the blood he wants to release you from sin release you from release your daughter this morning release your son this morning release your past this morning release it and feel the release of God upon your life hope this helps somebody this morning the Prophet goes to eat one day and he sees a woman - autumn makeup on and everything he gets almost half righteous he said Lord is this the world that my children have to drop it he was looking at this woman and he saw condemnation he saw it and then God lifted his eyes and showed him what he couldn't see showed him his own sins dear was the Prophet condemning this woman and God showed him his own sins and show him the blood pumper now whenever sin came up it was being blocked by the blood pump up and that blood pumper God put D etre blind his own eyes that he doesn't see us and he said I don't even condemn you how you could condemn and his whole perspective change because he started and see what God was seeing and when he went you walked up to that woman he began a talk talk she said I was a Christian one time I gave my life to God one time but I fell off I Blaxland at 10-under like was it when you look this morning what do you see maybe you have had a hard time a rough time maybe you've suffered a lot of losses family this that the other and you only see the negative I want you to assess and look for the positive this morning but the Branham goes on they did not believe that was the Messiah talk about the Jews they could not see him to be Messiah yet he done every sign the Messiah was supposed to do there was not one sign that Jesus did not do and he was supposed to do he did every one of them but they could not see it they were blind so when you see people say I don't believe in divine healing I can't see it I can't see this baptism of the Holy Ghost don't be angry with them he said they are blind they say I can't see this message of him coming I can't see this baptism of the Holy Spirit I can see the Serpent's see I can see this stuff they are blind and they don't even know it I'm Betty Brown said that's a sign of this age I've spoken in the book of Revelation they lay off the leaders in line wretched miserable and don't even know it blind and don't even know it but listen to the prophet in their unbelief when they see him when he comes again it will make an end of the unbelief hallelujah brother BAM say I love this good old gospel and that's why I read the scripture all eyes will see him that's why everything you will bow every tongue confess because what they have not seen either through God blinding them or through their predestination to not ever see it they will end up seeing it because everything will be revealed Branson now we know whoever yet we see things happening I'm not going to longer in a message look could he take some more we see things happening that to the world is just blind to them as it was in the days of Noah this is the prophet the message look but to we who look for Christ the second time it's an ensign that he is soon coming we see something fixing to happen and it depends on what you're looking at now Noah knew by the Word of God that there was coming a flood by faith he saw it because he had no evidence there was no newspaper article that went on about a flood somewhere else so he had to see it by eyes of it with his entrusting God's would write he knew that was going to be because God's would promised it now Noah himself by faith saw what God's Word said but the world could not see it because it could not be scientifically proven that there was water up in the sky but no one knew it was there because God said so and that's a church the Bride a call out to thee knows that the coming of the Lord is at hand regardless of how much we've been able to go in progress and so forth and succeed in splitting an atom and sending a ray the message of the Moon that means nothing to the believer only a sign that the coming of the Lord is at hand we see nations breaking and nations coming falling apart and the world coming apart and the church move coming up then we are told we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved but as these things begin to happen the church binds itself together tighter and tighter by the Word of God it's a great data we are living in everybody's looking for something everybody's looking for something you might be looking the deer - a time to get home to eat denies anybody within trying to get home to eat lunch nobody nobody there might be a picnic this afternoon the property speaking that you're taking your family to maybe it's something another next week I'll be looking for a neighbor to come or some friend but everybody's looking for something what are you looking for and when you look good what do you see and as a group of believers today assemble together the Prophet said we want to fix our thoughts our principles and things upon the coming of the Lord looking for Christ who shall appear the second time without sin unto salvation to those that believe and are looking for him to come so he will only come to those who are looking for him because the word has already come to us to know and to point us to the fact that he's coming so it's now our responsibility to be looking for him are you looking for him do you look for him when you're on your job do you look for him when you're on your school when you when you're driving home or what are you looking for what are you looking for what are you looking for when you're going down on your knees to pray what are you expecting what are you doing about an expectation you just want to be in the world or do you want something more you just want to be in church but you want something more you want to be in a message or you want something more what are you crying out for when you look at all of these things do you see that judgment is hanging over do you see the raft is close at hand in the days of Noah and so Noah building the boat and they looked and they saw that's enough but it didn't see the judgment didn't see the rain and then courts shut the door so that the awkward I am four days in breach and the people still DCC look easy Italian no I just went crazy but when the first drop of rain fell this saw they saw what more was speaking about and when they saw I can imagine they say no I know I let us in can we come in Noah but I know you know you're my neighbor no you know we went to school together no I came to the services no I heard you preach but it's too late friends don't see this thing to leat see it today if you don't have the Holy Ghost see it today if you have not been born again see it today if you have not forgiven someone see it today if you have someone to make right see it today cuz I'm that same the Jews could not see that be in their Messiah and yet they were scholars and theologians men of great renown scholarship they read the same Bible at you read now after it's been me known to us we see it plain that that was the Messiah so with our natural ability we would not even know it's a messiah for you to know that Christ Jesus was the Messiah your eyes had to be open your spiritual eyes because outsider is just intellectual honor and even the Prophet intellectually people here in the message didn't know it intellectually but it hasn't dropped down to a revelation of he came for me he came to he came to deliver me he came to perfect me he came to adopt me he came for the virtue to live in me me individual the church this day is prophesied to be blinded to reject the even time message revelation she said to Noah wretched miserable notice the bride the Commission the other night or the church naked plan and didn't know it Lord Jesus but Abraham's true that be merciful to us with the Balan but but the Bible said they was naked I never saw it till now he was naked can the church say I'm getting ready to wind up when Jesus came John the Baptist preaching say there's one standing among you whose shoes I'm not even worthy Jesus whether they had nobody kids even see him maybe you look what do you see Jesus comes out of being tempted and tried and walks into the temple they looked at him I could imagine they ushered him into his seat he looked the same way he did two weeks before could have ever said he was in a temple as was his custom it was his custom to be in the temple he found a script a waiter's written many had read the same theater before me he had looked at this but when Jesus began to read he was seeing something different it was not personal to him by revelation by experience and by Commission and authority that he could say the Spirit of the Lord upon me for he has anointed me and when he said this day the scripture is fulfilled he was seeing what nobody else had seen and then the people said what is this what is what is going on he was a fulfillment of Scripture now the man said no in the words see doesn't mean to look at the words see means to understand that's right like Jesus said to Nicodemus except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of heaven he said you have looked at a lot of things I just don't see it that means understand it you can't understand it until you are born again when you are born again you realize what makes these people act like this you have to accept it yourself and have a personal experience is anybody looking for Pulis on experience this morning a personal experience so you could see the word plainly friends for you to put your place to put your foot on every spot I've grown you have to see the ground for this before he could put your foot on it listen to what God told Abraham in Genesis 13 after lot had left and the laws in AD Abram after that lot was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward for all the land which thou seest that you see all that you see is that he will I give it and to thy seed forever now Aaron can I say well I just seen here no that is it that good so Abraham was challenged by the currents to see further because by seein he was actually beginning to claim he was defining the borders of his territory by what he was able to see so I want to challenge you this morning just like Samson when Samson was led to the pillars the musicians didn't get ready to come when they looked at Samson they saw finally they had defeated an enemy that had kept them under pressure for a long time when they looked at the pillars that Samson was being led to this other pillars as a place to just contain this entertainment and as Samson was being led to the pillars where the Branum said Samson began to see not with sight but he began to see a possibility he began to see a possibility but a random said that one small God could do something for him he had lost everything he had lost his natural eyesight but he didn't lost the vision to see the possibility that court could restore that God to deliver he saw the possibility that his mission could still be accomplished to destroy the Philistines so as whatever him said he study and tears may have began a stream to a socket less eyes he couldn't see anybody and he wasn't looking for them he was just looking at the possibility that once more God could work for him I don't know your situation this morning but I want to challenge you to see the possibility that once more court could do something for you then once more he could do something for your family that once more he could do something for your children that once more he can do something in your heart let's all stand to our feet we gonna play something listen to the prophet and a message once more with a brand said little close now at this remark he knew that his present Thomas Sampson Beck's ill-conditioned could never be the challenge of the hour yet he was just as much man as he ever was in his muscles his frame was as big as it ever was he was just as big a muscle that ever could raise up on his arm at any time it was probably lodged because he had been grinding doing heavier work but Branson we got better churches better building and everything but where's our strength spiritually speaking we can take a vote in the nation sure we can do these things but that ain't what I'm talking about I'm talking about the presence of God being recognized among us that's what we ought to live for he knew that his backslidden condition could not be the challenge of that hour he had lost his focus he had lost what he was supposed to be looking for looking too caught up in the cares of life but about him said so does the church know it now we can't do it under this condition you can do it [Music] but the band said I've just got a little minute or two longer but notice as I hurry now and keep my word all the time where they were all standing there and these totes were going through their mind I hope it sends some through yours they never noticed well Samson his torch went through his mind maybe they passed the bottle took a drink again they fine Hollywood woman's today with a cigarette in their mouth as it was such a thing like they I don't think they cut quite that low in a day but pushed up their hand took another drink and whoring hello chosen by John you up there we played cards together why are they doing this but around say there's a possibility this is what Samson went through that God will hear me there's a possibility that while he taught the fella times have not noticed him this little boy had untied his hands war bison lay my hands upon the booze there's a possibility oh my I wish the church could see that there is a possibility of a real revival what did he do he raised up his sockets he had no eyes but he raised up his socket towards God he said they never noticed the moving of his lips as he was sincerely confession they never notice that he was talking to God I don't know where last time so that prayed or cried or talked but didn't even realize that he had begun to talk to God whatever Adam said we don't need just a little Lord forgive me and Jim and Joe and all of us he said we need a sincere cleaning up from the pulpit to the janitor he said I never noticed the tears running down from them sockets where he once had eyes you never noticed the moving of his lips his eyes brightly tears streaming down the sockets he wanted God to make his would once more vindicated to prove as I say this Delilah to the other side of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever once more he thought it would happen not a new denomination not a new sectarian but a vindicated world from you God I know you are still good I'm blind I've got all tract I'm not willing to live let me die with this enemy you raise me up to destroy that I've failed your Lord but there's a possibility you'd hear me once more Lord once more Lord in dead earnest in dead earnest it means deep sincerity it means forgetting who's next to you it means forgetting who else was here in tenderness he prayed he knew what was coming Lord Justice once more once more let me see Jesus Christ as he was yesterday when he breathed that brand the tears rolling from his cheeks with deep sincerity of confession but a pen said that's what the church needs confess you're wrong don't care what dr. Jones hands or what anybody else else if you're out of the word of God confess it that your own cry or once more Lord once more Lord Lord once more avenge my blindness upon these denominations and give me strength Lord the shake this denominational world with your vindication give me strength Lord once more prove it but a parent said he knew what was gonna happen if his prayer was answered do you know what's gonna happen if your prey gets answer this morning do you know what will happen if caught answers your prayer if could with the grandeur in size of your heart do you know shackles would break off of your house off of your children off of your family do you know of the Holy Ghost today given you what is gonna happen if his prayer was answered he knew Ted earnest crying once more Lord and while he was praying and making it on his confession every fiber in his body begin to vibrate while he was praying I'm making his confession the Prophet said every fiber in his body began to vibrate the frequency began to change the atmosphere began to change something began to happen in the realm that cannot be seen with naked eyes something began to happen but Philistines could not see something begin to happen that the devil could not see something begin to happen that the world could not see number the Brennan goes on oh god oh god if the body of Jesus Christ could stand as one and this is my bread is morning or go order if the body of Jesus Christ could stand as one and every fiber and every member begin to vibrate with the literal baptism of the Holy Ghost again not with new members and shaking hands and some Creed and as a strength begin to move into those muscles every fiber began to twist he began to feel himself Agana and he twisted out and when he did the big walls hell all we need to do today is to see these denominational walls for is to get deeply sincere before God to heal these blinded eyes that's been blinded from the Word of God that was Samson's greatest victory the Prophet said he ever had because he was willing to confess over every enemy first that he was brought up to destroy Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah my-my-my Oh hallelujah in the message Oh Lord just once more he said if the church can get in that condition if you are ready right now if you're sincere if you really mean business if your eyes are open to what I'm trying to tell you in a roundabout way but the Pan Am is screaming out you see this a roundabout way but I want you to see it and won't even see you can receive the Holy Ghost I want you to see and you can live above sin you can live above condemnation you can live above the pastor you can live above the pressure on you deliver but frustration you can live above the weight and the burden of sin because the wages of sin instead Oh hallelujah hallelujah reach out to him right now keep your eyes closed you talk to him in your own way you talk to him in your own way I challenge you to leave this service with your eyes closed don't leave this service without seeing the possibility don't leave this service without knowing you're gonna make it don't leave this service without making a heart right with God if you need to come to the altar come to the altar even if the meal know where you are to do that whatever it takes [Music] oh my listen to the prophets instructions hallelujah hallelujah he said if the church can only get in that condition if you are ready right now is anybody ready right now are you ready right now to separate from the world are you ready right now to put the world behind you to put the past behind you to put your feelings behind you to put the cross in front of you are you ready right now to walk towards the Holy Ghost are you ready right now to walk into your inheritance are you ready right now he said ISM if you are ready right now if you are sincere if you really mean business if your eyes are open to what I'm trying to tell you in a roundabout way if you're sincere dancing lord I don't care what it is I'm ready I see the sign I know that it's later than we think and it's time to come it's time to come this morning Oh hallelujah [Music] [Music]
