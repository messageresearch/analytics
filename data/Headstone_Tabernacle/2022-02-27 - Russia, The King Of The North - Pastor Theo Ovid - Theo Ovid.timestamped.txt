[25:44] to 4.
[25:45] read in daniel 11
[25:48] reading from verse 15.
[25:50] so the king of the north shall come
[25:53] and cast up a mount
[25:54] and take the most fenced cities
[25:57] and the arms of the south shall not
[25:59] withstand
[26:00] neither his chosen people neither shall
[26:02] there be any strength to withstand
[26:05] but he that cometh against him shall do
[26:07] according to his own will and none shall
[26:09] stand before him and he shall stand in
[26:12] the glorious land
[26:14] by which his hand shall be consumed
[26:16] he shall also set up face his face to
[26:19] enter
[26:20] with the strength of his whole kingdom
[26:22] and upright ones with him thus shall he
[26:24] do and he shall give him the daughter of
[26:27] woman corrupt in her but she shall not
[26:30] stand on his side neither before him
[26:33] after this shall he turn his face onto
[26:35] the isles and shall take many but a
[26:38] prince for his own behalf shall cause
[26:40] the reproach offered by him to cease
[26:43] without his own reproach he shall cause
[26:45] it to turn upon him
[26:47] then he shall turn his face towards the
[26:48] forth of his own land but he shall
[26:50] stumble and fall
[26:52] and not be found
[26:54] then shall stand up in his estate eraser
[26:57] of taxes in the glory of the kingdom but
[27:00] within a few days he shall be destroyed
[27:02] neither in anger nor in battle but in
[27:05] his estate shall stand up a vile person
[27:08] to whom they shall not give the honor of
[27:10] the kingdom but he shall come in
[27:13] peaceably
[27:14] and obtain the kingdom by flatteries
[27:17] and with the arms
[27:18] of a flood shall they be overthrown
[27:21] from before him and shall be broken ye
[27:24] also the prince of the covenant
[27:27] and after the league made with him
[27:30] he shall work deceitfully for he shall
[27:32] come up and shall become strong with a
[27:34] small people he shall enter peaceably
[27:38] even with the fattest places of the
[27:39] province and he shall do that which his
[27:42] fathers have not done
[27:43] for his father's father nor his father's
[27:46] fathers he shall scatter among them the
[27:48] pray
[27:49] and spoil
[27:51] and riches ye he shall forecast his
[27:53] devices against the strongholds even for
[27:56] a time
[27:57] and he shall still up his power and his
[27:59] courage against the king of the salt
[28:00] with a great army and the king of the
[28:02] soul shall be stood up to battle with a
[28:04] very great and mighty army but he shall
[28:07] not stand for they shall forecast
[28:09] devices
[28:10] against him he they shall feed the
[28:13] portion of his meat shall destroy him
[28:15] let me read again yea they that feed of
[28:18] the portion of his meat shall destroy
[28:20] him and his army shall overflow and many
[28:23] shall fall down slain
[28:25] and both these king's hearts
[28:27] shall be to do mischief and they shall
[28:30] speak lies at one table but it shall not
[28:33] prosper
[28:34] for yet the end
[28:36] shall be at the time
[28:38] appointed
[28:39] then shall we turn into his land with
[28:41] great riches and his heart shall be
[28:43] against the holy covenant and he shall
[28:45] do exploits and return to his own land
[28:48] at the time appointed he shall return
[28:51] and come towards the salt
[28:53] but it shall not be as deformer or as
[28:56] the latter for as the ships of chittim
[28:58] shall come against him therefore he
[29:00] shall be grieved and returned have
[29:02] indignation against the holy covenant so
[29:04] shall he do he shall even return and
[29:06] have intelligence with them that forsake
[29:09] the holy covenant
[29:11] and arms shall stand on his part and
[29:13] they shall pollute the sanctuary of
[29:15] strength and shall take away the daily
[29:17] sacrifice and they shall make place the
[29:19] abomination that make it desolate and
[29:22] such as do wickedly against the covenant
[29:24] shall be corrupted by flatteries but the
[29:27] people
[29:28] that do know their god
[29:30] shall be strong
[29:32] and do exploits and they that understand
[29:35] among the people shall instruct many yet
[29:37] they shall fall by the sword by the
[29:39] flame by captivity by spoiled amenities
[29:43] now when they shall fall
[29:45] they shall be halted with a little help
[29:47] but many shall cleave to them with
[29:49] flatteries
[29:51] some of them of understanding shall fall
[29:53] to try them and to purge and to make
[29:55] them white even to the time of the end
[29:58] because it is yet for time
[30:00] appointed and the king shall do
[30:02] according to his will he shall exalt
[30:04] himself and magnify himself above every
[30:06] god and shall speak marvelous things
[30:08] against the god of gods and shall
[30:10] prosper till the indignation be
[30:13] accomplished for that is determined
[30:15] shall be done neither shall he regard
[30:17] the god of his fathers nor the desire of
[30:20] woman nor regard any god for he shall
[30:22] magnify himself above all
[30:24] but in his estate shall he honor the god
[30:27] of forces and a god whom his fathers
[30:29] knew not shall be honored with gold
[30:31] silver pressure stone unpleasant things
[30:33] thus shall he do in the most strongholds
[30:35] but strange god whom he shall
[30:37] acknowledge and increase with glory and
[30:38] he shall cause them to rule over many
[30:40] shall divide the lamp again and at the
[30:42] time of the end shall the king of the
[30:44] salt push at him and the king of the
[30:46] north shall come against him like a
[30:48] whirlwind with chariots with horsemen
[30:50] with many ships he shall enter into the
[30:52] countries and shall overflow and pass
[30:54] over he shall enter into the glorious
[30:56] land and many countries shall be
[30:58] overthrown but thee shall escape out of
[31:00] his hand even edem and moore and the
[31:02] chief of the churn of ammon he shall
[31:04] stretch forth his hand upon the
[31:06] countries and the land of egypt shall
[31:08] escape but he shall have power over
[31:10] treasures of gold of silver over all the
[31:13] pressure of things of egypt and the
[31:14] libyans and the ethiopians shall be at
[31:16] his steps but tidings out of the east
[31:19] out of the north shall trouble him
[31:21] therefore he shall go forth with fury to
[31:23] destroy and utterly to make away many he
[31:26] shall plant the tabernacles of his
[31:28] palace between the seas and the glorious
[31:31] holy mountain yet he shall come to his
[31:33] end and none shall help him and at that
[31:36] time shall michael stand up the great
[31:39] prince which standeth for the churn of
[31:40] thy people and there shall be a time of
[31:43] trouble such as never was since there
[31:45] was a nation even to the same time and
[31:47] at that time thy people shall be
[31:49] delivered every one that is found
[31:51] written in the book and many of them
[31:53] that sleep in the dust of the earth
[31:55] shall awake some to everlasting life
[31:57] something everlasting shame and
[31:59] everlasting contempt final scripture
[32:01] revelation chapter 7 1-4 after these
[32:04] things i saw four angels standing in the
[32:05] four corners of the earth holding the
[32:07] four winds of the earth that the wind
[32:09] should not blow on the earth nor on the
[32:11] sea nor any tree and i saw another angel
[32:14] sailing from the east having the seal of
[32:16] the living god and he cried with a lord
[32:18] voice to the four angels to whom it was
[32:20] given to her the earth and the sea
[32:22] saying hurt not the earth neither the
[32:24] sea nor the tree still we have sealed
[32:26] the servants of our god in their
[32:28] foreheads and i hear the number of them
[32:30] which was sealed and they were sealed a
[32:32] hundred and forty four thousand of all
[32:34] the tribes of the children of israel may
[32:36] god bless this word you may be seated
[32:39] praise god thank you again for being
[32:41] here oh blessed be the name of the lord
[32:44] well i have a title this morning russia
[32:46] the king of the north
[32:48] praise god that's the title of this
[32:50] morning i'd have an inspiration to
[32:51] compliment that the seal in time
[32:54] praise the name of the lord russia the
[32:56] king of the north praise god you know
[32:59] guess by now all the lord the news about
[33:02] russia invading ukraine
[33:04] praise be to jesus so we're not talking
[33:06] about putin we're not on him we're
[33:09] talking about russia
[33:11] amen that that that that king now of
[33:13] russia
[33:14] all right
[33:15] so just want to share this with you and
[33:16] we're going to head straight into the
[33:18] way
[33:19] your obedience to god
[33:21] proves your spirit
[33:24] whenever the word comes it's not just
[33:25] come to hear you could hear it
[33:27] and you know a lot of people hear the
[33:29] word but they're not possessing it the
[33:30] same way
[33:32] you know like you tell a child you could
[33:34] tell you have your own children and you
[33:36] can tell the child um you can't make it
[33:39] and those same words you can't make it
[33:42] have two different effects on two
[33:44] different type of children
[33:46] the one child that hears that they can't
[33:48] make it that that that's just flow them
[33:51] another child will prove
[33:53] that they could make it
[33:55] just because you said you coming
[33:58] it's the same words
[33:59] but how it is processed
[34:01] you see same words same gospel but how
[34:03] which is received how it is applied
[34:06] amen isn't that right because if you say
[34:08] you believe and you don't follow the
[34:10] instructions of the word then you don't
[34:12] believe it
[34:14] so the word just come forward that is
[34:15] not a story book
[34:17] the word always come for you to apply
[34:20] and only in your application it could
[34:23] become effective
[34:25] that's why jesus said describing
[34:26] pharisees they preach the word of god of
[34:29] no effect
[34:30] they make the word of god of no effect
[34:33] whatever they do they're playing game
[34:34] with words but it's not effective so
[34:37] when the word come the way it's supposed
[34:38] to come it's supposed to have an effect
[34:41] upon your life it's supposed to shake
[34:43] you make you tremble praise be to jesus
[34:46] right now in ukraine a 44 all elected
[34:49] president who never had any political
[34:51] experience standing there as a war
[34:53] president and people admire him for his
[34:55] courage because mighty russia thought
[34:57] they was going to overrun him a long
[34:58] time ago and he's still standing but
[35:01] isaac was telling me
[35:02] biden offered him to get out to extract
[35:04] he and his family out and he said no i

[42:01] they were a bunch of ignoramuses big old
[42:04] siberians would bear over their face
[42:06] and did no right hand from left
[42:08] russia
[42:10] and she recognized her place
[42:12] she had to do it to fulfill the
[42:14] scripture
[42:17] you know my prophecies of what i said
[42:19] what happened how all of them would
[42:21] gather in communism
[42:23] now she leads the world in science

[42:28] of the world is behind her she leaves
[42:29] her place she just recognized she had
[42:31] some brains too
[42:34] the reason russia came to herself she
[42:36] had to
[42:38] just like israel had to get to the
[42:41] homeland
[42:43] god had to drive israel back to the
[42:45] homeland for the trumpets
[42:48] oh glory to god and god had to drive the
[42:52] bride back to the homeland for the
[42:53] thunders

[42:56] to give the right feet to show them how
[42:59] to prepare oh give the lord a shout i

[43:04] the word we are preaching we're not
[43:06] telling you something new we tell you

[43:17] have to drive russia up there in
[43:19] communism
[43:21] to do exactly what being prophesied to
[43:23] do
[43:24] why did russia wake up
[43:26] why did the nations wake up

[43:30] bride
[43:32] right hannah and
[43:34] they were sleeping you said we'll take
[43:36] them seven thunders to break up the

[44:23] at the same time
[44:24] the bride has recognized the evening
[44:26] light
[44:27] just begin to recognize
[44:29] the hungry pentecost remember the last
[44:31] quote we read to share with you about
[44:34] it shall be like the preaching the word
[44:35] but no manifestation
[44:37] and then even time it shall be light the
[44:39] light is when the word becomes
[44:40] vindicated and manifested it is light to
[44:42] vindicate the word so it can't just be
[44:44] word word word would it have to be a
[44:46] manifestation
[44:47] and you see that your man don't want to
[44:49] go to because you see you'll take god to
[44:50] do that
[44:52] you see man could come with brains and

[51:23] every isn't going to heap up into russia
[51:26] oh glory to god why russia has nothing
[51:29] to do with the antichrist
[51:32] nothing
[51:36] that's communism
[51:38] the falsely of protestants and
[51:41] catholicism has produced communism
[51:44] the reason russia had drawn them out of
[51:46] there because they had all the money all
[51:48] the prayers to them saints they build
[51:50] the biggest buildings had all the wealth
[51:51] and bundle it up and they lived no
[51:53] different and was not different from the
[51:54] rest of the world so russia throw them
[51:56] out and not make russia form communism
[51:58] because of catholicism criticism
[52:02] i'll prove to you
[52:04] that communism
[52:06] is working straight in the hands of
[52:08] almighty god
[52:10] to destroy
[52:12] the roman system

[55:42] exercised all the power the first beast
[55:44] had before him the red dragon and caused
[55:47] all that was on the earth that dwell
[55:49] upon the earth to worship the beast
[55:51] and he does great wonders to make fire
[55:53] come down from heaven the atomic bomb
[55:55] hydrogen smart intelligence
[55:58] the united states
[56:01] will come to a time
[56:04] that church and state will unite
[56:06] together
[56:09] that way you get this religious right
[56:11] and this so-called conservative group in
[56:13] america
[56:14] that want to see what uh what things are
[56:17] and how it's supposed to be and so on
[56:19] the plane straight into god's hand
[56:22] church and state has been a part but
[56:23] listen to the prophecy
[56:24] the united states will come to a time
[56:28] that church and state we unite together
[56:30] how else could they close this down
[56:34] if it's neutral everybody see me but
[56:37] they're bible religious you know and
[56:38] whatnot but when they state and church

[1:19:43] the world will set my room crying
[1:19:46] and receive the baptism of the holy
[1:19:48] ghost
[1:19:49] to make arrangements with billy graham
[1:19:50] to come to my house
[1:19:52] as soon as he come to louisville i got
[1:19:54] his name and thing to come over to seek
[1:19:55] and talk about the baptism of the holy
[1:19:57] ghost and its power
[1:19:59] not quoting this billy said in one place
[1:20:01] a woman standing crying with a big
[1:20:03] quaiter he said something struck him and
[1:20:05] he rushed forward to pray for i said
[1:20:07] what happened to me oh my
[1:20:09] god
[1:20:10] in the last days is going to draw true
[1:20:12] hearts from everywhere
[1:20:14] no matter how much counterfeit and chaff
[1:20:16] the devil has
[1:20:17] god will rise his church right out of it
[1:20:20] it will be a ceiling for sure
[1:20:24] as i'm standing in this platform
[1:20:26] you're going to rise this is how
[1:20:28] it going to be a ceiling
[1:20:31] for sure
[1:20:32] you mean this ceiling is really promised
[1:20:35] yes
[1:20:37] even if the businesses don't want to
[1:20:38] preach about it this is what is promised
[1:20:41] this is what you have to look for
[1:20:43] this is what you have to look to
[1:20:45] the hour is at hand the coal and formula
[1:20:47] is wearing away
[1:20:48] watch the evangelical and the social
[1:20:50] gospel and all these things are gone the
[1:20:53] fantastic side is going in such radical
[1:20:54] financing anybody blind could see it
[1:20:57] watch
[1:20:59] so is the church of the living god
[1:21:00] that's been borne down in the middle of
[1:21:02] fantasism and chaos but she found how
[1:21:04] she won the way through the grime until
[1:21:06] she's on top of the thing now spelling
[1:21:08] for the wings many shall run to and fro
[1:21:11] the people that know their god shall do
[1:21:12] great exploits in this day
[1:21:14] god's revelation to his church sets the
[1:21:16] little flock since the great jesus is
[1:21:18] saying keep holding on don't worry god
[1:21:20] is waiting trying pressing to get the
[1:21:22] mystery of god revealed to his church
[1:21:26] that is what is holding back the coming
[1:21:28] of christ now
[1:21:30] this great supernatural power that
[1:21:32] really lays dormant in the church
[1:21:34] because but around seven the poor begin
[1:21:35] to manifest it can't last more than 30
[1:21:37] 40 days
[1:21:38] the power among the people sleeping sins
[1:21:41] began to rise and appear
[1:21:43] the earth can't hold that anointing
[1:21:45] so go ahead and take it and take it away
[1:21:47] and leave the world without the holy
[1:21:49] spirit
[1:21:50] then people could do whatever in their
[1:21:51] heart whatever they want to do you have
[1:21:52] no spirit to restrain them
[1:21:54] oh my many man standing in the pulpit
[1:21:56] this morning preaching social gospel but
[1:21:58] dong in his heart he really believes and
[1:22:00] brother he has the power to preach it
[1:22:02] but what he wants to see is to put in
[1:22:04] its power in its beauty
[1:22:06] so glad to see it being made manifest
[1:22:09] the revelation of jesus christ you hear
[1:22:11] those words it's so glad to see it
[1:22:13] manifest
[1:22:14] the revelation of jesus christ not
[1:22:16] talking faith
[1:22:18] manifest
[1:22:20] hallelujah
[1:22:21] oh my

[1:25:55] that's what the matter with the church
[1:25:56] the hope of glory the baptism of the
[1:25:58] holy ghost has come in the people's
[1:25:59] heart they don't recognize what it is
[1:26:02] they think it's still joining
[1:26:03] but that is the god of heaven living in
[1:26:06] you
[1:26:07] given you all the powers
[1:26:08] you are in possession of anything that
[1:26:10] he had
[1:26:11] so it is in you to abstain from evil to
[1:26:14] do good to shun evil the fruit of
[1:26:16] righteousness to turn away from
[1:26:17] temptation all malice hatred strife envy
[1:26:20] so forth turn away from it
[1:26:22] for that will take him from your heart
[1:26:25] if you will receive him embrace him love
[1:26:28] him hold him in your heart love him i
[1:26:30] can tell you the church together in that
[1:26:32] kind of power has the power to bind the
[1:26:34] heavens heal the sick open the blind
[1:26:35] eyes and the death speak dumb speak the
[1:26:37] death here cripples walk blind see
[1:26:40] it is god in you it is deity
[1:26:43] and then they begin to sing amazing
[1:26:44] grace and they begin to pray
