ask it amen and amen god bless you tell your bibles i'd like you to turn to luke chapter 21 and isaiah chapter 60 for reading this evening luke chapter 21 and isaiah chapter 60. are we thank god for this morning service the good shepherd and the good shepherd leading the life for the sheep oh my gosh see a few things about that just a minute let's read the scripture first luke 21 verse 32 says very very verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass away till lord be fulfilled heavenly shall pass away but my words shall not pass away and take you to yourselves least at any time your hearts be overcharged with the fighting and drunkness and cares of this life and so that they come upon you unawares for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth watch ye therefore and pray always that even we are counted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man oh blessed be the name of the lord praise his holy name and let's go to isaac chapter 60 praise be to jesus arise and shine for the light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness to people but the lord shall rise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon him he god the blessed reign of his word you may be seated o praise the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord praise god what a time this morning in the word and what a contrast of that good shepherd from ezekiel 34 where god says son of man prophesy against the shepherds of israel prophesy and say unto them thus hear the lord god unto the shepherds would be to the shepherds of israel that feed themselves should not the shepherds feed the flock you eat the fat they clothe you with the wool you kill them that are fed but you feed not the flock the disease have you not strengthened neither have you healed that which was sick neither have you burned up that which was broken neither have you brought again that which was driven away neither have you sought that which was lost but with force i would cruelty have you ruled them and they were scattered because there is no shepherd and they became meat to all the beasts of the field when they were scattered my sheep wandered through all the mountains upon every high heel year my flock was scattered upon all the earth and none did search or seek after them therefore these shepherds hear the word of the lord as i live saith the lord god surely because my flock became a prayer my flock you see what god keeps it my flock my flock my flock this is not meant churches the people don't belong to men it's my flock it's my people my people that's called by my name praise god holly in the last days true shepherds will be a hidden mystery and barbara and preach a message called why it had to be shepherds and reveal a hidden mystery that goku would have true shepherds in the last day born to the false shepherds hallelujah so what the shepherd's supposed to do is the healed broken-hearted to restore those that are lost to go after them in other words they're supposed to have a heart of a shepherd a true shepherd that will lay down his life for the sheep and stand for what is right and stand for what is true and stands for what is righteous that is the kind of heart that god gonna put in the last days oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god amen listen to this as i live to say the lord god surely because my flock became a prey and my flock became me to every piece of the field because there was no shepherd neither did my shepherd search for my flock but the shepherds fed themselves and fed not my flock therefore o shepherds hear the word of the lord dost say the lord god behold i am against the shepherds i will require my flock at their hand and cause them to cease from sending the flock neither shall the shepherds feed themselves anymore but i will deliver them from their mouth for thus here the lord i even i will both search my sheep and seek them out god promised the lord himself to descend from heaven with a shout to come and seek his own sheep out so you don't belong to no man you don't belong to no system you belong to the lord god almighty oh glory to her praise god do you believe that tonight hallelujah so you have to ignore who find you god himself push back this one push back that one he don't care if he was in a bar he don't care if he wasn't adultery if it wasn't fornication either kevin was drunk and drinking god himself he said i myself going to come down and find my sheep glory to god hallelujah he is the good shepherd oh glory to god hallelujah all that the father had given me will come glory to god and i will raise them up so no devil could hold you back you are going to come out you are going to be free you're going to be anointed with god oh hallelujah glory to god amen didn't either praise the name of the lord so this morning this evening a little message the word manifested is the light of the hour that's the title and the word manifested is the light of the hour from search is the time of the branham it might be closer than you think it's got me scared i haven't done enough where are we at time shall be no more he announces the time is over what happens is this real yeah it's already in the scriptures and the time shall be no more we'll be talking about this and that and all we want to plan time shall be no more russian position isn't that right the sodomites in position is not right everything is getting into position what about that bride that right has to get in position glory to god i'm going to prove it to you before judgment struck egypt they had a ghost shell the judgment didn't strike goshen goshen was the only place of safety you have to get the goshen if there's one place it got to go and hide is in kosher and kosher had the blood and moses to kill the lamb it caught they apply because the angel told moses to tell the people when i see the blood i'm going to pass over you praise god that is time they had a prophet they had prophetic utterance they had a word from the lord and if ever there was a time to get a word from the lord it's a time like this because the bible said there's gonna become a famine in the last days all glory not for books and tips we have a lot of that not for preachers we have lots of that but for hearing the true word of god they're gonna run to the east they're gonna run to the west they're gonna run to the north they're gonna run to the south they can't find it but there's gonna be a people that are gonna be well fed my people shall eat and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord dear god why because the good shepherd going to feed his flock okay the lord the praise offering oh hallelujah and the manner that the sheep is gonna get is found under the seventh seal that was reserved for the sheep is seven thunders under there banging one two three four five six seven one two three four five six seven one two three four five six seven seven thunders under there that's for the sheep oh glory oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to god you may be see then time shall be no more you know that time is over what happened could that be so seriously think if it is then the pyramid here we go it's capped by the seven thunders and if the pyramid is kept by the seven thunders then the seven thunders is the holy spirit i'm not hearing you i am not hearing you if the pyramid is kept by the seven thunders then the seven thunders is the holy spirit and the seven thunders is the capstone oh hallelujah it's the capstone revelation turn it into a capstone manifestation oh give the lord praises jesus jesus said my words they are spirit and they are life what he did not say is the process for it to turn from word into spirit because any time god about to do something he doesn't give you the full fulfillment of it if you want a savior he said hold a baby [Music] come on now if you want a deliverer he said hold a seat and watch it unfold everybody want the full thing complete everybody want a full deliverance but he said the footage shall conceive you want a deliverer he's then baby moses watch him grow he's coming he's coming he's not ready yet he's coming look how god is work when he gets fed up on saul he told samuel go to the hostel jesse anoint my king i have a king there not a little boy a king god's here complete come on now come on now god see god sees your adoption complete god sees god sees your healing complete god sees god sees your deliverance complete my fear of faith in the building tonight i feel an anointing in the building of light oh glory to god it's good to be here it's good to be here glory you may be seated god what's going on to anoint david to be shepherd over israel david was god shepherd isn't that right but watch this when samuel came a boy was coming but god saw a king you see god loves to see the seed unfold itself you see god knows that once the word goes thought the word is a seed and the word just can't return void god knows when that when that word is spoken [Applause] that word have power in itself come on now come on now let's go down to genesis let's let every seed bring forth after it's kind god i don't have enough this church is too small for me today oh glory to god is too small [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that's why remember that's why the devil is always interested in killing babies [Applause] because the babies have the potential you see a little eagle is a big one in small form [Applause] i'll say it again a little eagle is a big one in small form or if you only get big if the church only get to know who he is if they get to know who you are if you get to know your potential you will see why the devil is fighting you two-time nail every single day of your life because he knows that if you come into an understanding and a revelation of who you are and you can do the greater works you let me see adam adam was a seed of the word adam did not know what you please are trying to just was born let there be man man became a living soul let a man have dominion hallelujah a man with dominion a man with power a man with god a man who filled with god fell so you think you've fallen in a surprise i'm surprised you mean you don't want to see a man on there that's okay you are surprised of what i'm saying that's why jesus didn't get no fight with the one as well he's so cool he's five man [Music] oh i gone see jesus have no problems because you were born in sin [Applause] all have come short of the glory not some all right all all all have come short of the glory not some oh so don't play righteous inside of here with like you have some wings to fly somewhere we will clip them wings and make you sit in your seat [Applause] [Music] like sparks over anger and the people got excited they said don't look at us we about men it's not by our holiness this man is made whole but by the power in the name of jesus this man walks before you peter knew what he did peter knew how he came through and he knew it wasn't by might or power but by the spirit oh my god my jesus oh glory bring a new time win a new season and you didn't know we're going to say the right thing and we're going to dash into the questions for anything now anything any service now any service now the right way going to be spoken the right thing is going to be done do you believe that [Applause] listen to this there is no church is our standard there is no church we can look up to there is none all i have is the word this is a new season when joshua cross over he said we have not been here before this is a new time altogether nobody could teach us where to put our foot we know every place come on now every every place every place every place from this day forward every place yeah yeah every place you put your foot is yours [Applause] every place every place every place you tell you what happened to us now we become dangerous men in satan's kingdom we are dangerous people we are atomic bombs we are god's weapon of warfare we are god's judgment sword on the earth the spirit is upon me for he has anointed me to bring a word to you today oh give the lord some praises oh we're in the spirit this evening we're in the anointing this evening [Applause] remember caesar hallelujah hallelujah we speak to you because we don't want the day to take you unaware like a snail that will trap people upon the earth those that are unguarded those who are not vigilant it will catch them like a trap set for an animal like a snare to gather all men on the earth but you are not one of those you are escaped once you escape the pope you escape rome you accept the nomination you escape false prophets you escaped interpretation you escaped man's idea and now you are in the holy ghost of the seven thunders to utter their voices to you you will be seated if it is then the pyramid is capped by the servant thunders you remember the previous message it's a caption what did it do the holy spirit capped off the individual and sealed it when we have added faith righteousness godliness and so forth we kept adding until we got seven things and the seventh one was love watch and then watch that's how he makes the individual he caps him and seals him with the holy spirit then if that be so if this individual is kept and sealed with the holy ghost what does this individual have if that be so then he has got seven church ages that he had seven mysteries that have been sung it away and they fought to bring them back and the heads don't come the cap of the church does the thunders mean that my brethren serves where we are at so we find out the seven thunders cap the pyramid is not right praise god god talked to moses chicago listen to this and i believe that the age has come now the miraculous the phenomenal the baptism of the spirit and power and signs and wonders this great outpouring of god's spirit in the last days that's the thing that will bring faith into the people that will take a rapturing fate that will take the church into glory you heard what he says the baptism of the spirit the baptism of the holy ghost that's the thing to bring faith into the people and seven thunders gives faith so seven thunders is the holy spirit [Applause] i am not hearing you i'm not hearing you then the same seven thunders that caps the pyramid that's the thing to bring the faith so the baptism of the holy ghost is the thing to bring to faith in the people therefore the seventh thunders must be the holy spirit because the seven things get fate and the holy spirit gains fate so therefore the thunders is the dynamics in mechanic form in word form super saiyan that whenever the light struck rebecca she knew something within her that brought her to isaac she veiled the face she wanted no more to do with her own thinking isaac was the thinking from then on and the church itself here we go when it strikes the power of god the baptism of the holy ghost out of the national churches out of the catholic church wherever it is when the baptism of the holy ghost is made real to the people damn that's predestination like you people here to life sees it and walks in it what's it a super sign and you possess the gates of the enemy so the baptism of the holy ghost has to be made real to the people rising of the sun he came to redeem or to bring to life those predestinated seed of god that he's seen before the foundation of the world and put their names in the book of life so he put their names in the book of life he come down on the earth and looking for those seeds he's a great shepherd looking for the seas looking for sheep he had sheep in trinidad so the great shepherd had to bring the seven thunders from under the seventh seal and throw it over this island to see them seven thunders pick up the seed because the seventeen are gonna gather the bright together the seven dollar will give the bride fate seven are gonna utter the voices of that group the seven thunder to show how to prepare those seven thunders have to be loose seven perfect spirits across the whole earth to get every pedestrian of the seed it's the great shepherd it's the great holy spirit it's the great elohim moving brooding like it was in the garden of eden when cross darkness covered the earth and the spirit of god move upon the face of the water and god said let there be light oh come on now come on now god said let there be light it was dark i want you to notice the darkness didn't intimidate god god didn't hide this person but it's so dark i can't see anything that god that wasn't intimidated by the darkness and isaiah isaiah said close darkness cover the earth gross darkness cover the people but the light gonna come the light going to shine when god saw the darkness the bible said darkness was upon the face of the deep but the spirit of god move upon the face of the water the spirit of god and the waters which those source at the multitude of the people the spirit of god begin to move upon the waters or when the spirit begin to move upon you you're gonna hear the voice of god that's why you've got to get in the spirit that's why you've got to worship that's why you've got to honor his name that's why you got to press your way you can't just watch and stare you got to watch and praise [Applause] listen to brother branham he not only come to be a blessing but to share the blessing with every predestinated seed oh hallelujah now the mystery was the seed was always in the earth you hear what i said in genesis the seed was already there that was a hidden mystery darkness was covered in it and once darkness covered the seed it can come to life ethnic light to bring it into a manifestation so the word manifested brings light to bring forth the seed as long as darkness is covering the seed they can't produce anything but when god rolled back to darkness when god rolled back the darkness when god rolls back the darkness you're gonna hear let there be light [Applause] and that light going to strike that seed inside of you oh hallelujah listen to this jesus he was god's first corner wheat that had been raised from the dead the first corner wheat by god's quickening power god has quickness life raised him from the dead and he was the first fruits of those that slept the first sample the first taste of others that come to raise he was the first fruits of them that slept and that's why they had to waive that chief because it was the first one that come to maturity it was wave as a memorial of thanksgiving to god believing that the rest of them would come so in the old testament when you plant your crop and you get the first chief come to maturity you take it and wave it before the lord and like a wave offering lord more is coming yes they are ready yet but they're coming they have all the potential but they're coming they're in bondage but they're coming they're looking for a breakthrough but they're coming they fall here they fall there but they're coming because this is the first one that comes to maturity and if this one can make it all the rest could make it if this one could overcome all the rest could overcome if this one could have power all the rest would get power or the first one come to maturity was waved [Applause] how many see the power of love [Music] god with him see that's why oh this is good that's why jesus had no fight to tell disciples what they need to know and what they're not prepared to handle as yet he watched them and said the same works i do shall you also and these guys have all kinds of spirits on them they don't even know what spirit of jesus told them this if you shall say this mountain be moved and don't doubt their heart you can have what you say they can't touch that yet but he hit it in the promises he's just hitting them with it that's like algebra you're beating them with it and they're doing no mathematics and they give them algebra because it belongs to them [Applause] you see all what god is he poured into christ and all his christ he put into the church so everything christ did we have the potential to do it's just you don't know it yet it comes like you have amnesia and you forget your name you forget where you're staying they forget where your fire is you forget what street you're living on and you don't know and somebody know where you belong and they keep telling you walk here keep on walking here that's a fifo ministry it doesn't strike you yet if they hit you yet you're still dazed because the devil bump you on your head but we're going to bump that thing off and your head will come back in order and you're going to stop your foolishness and you'll get to know who you are come on say i met somebody you may be seated by the political son he was ambitious he said look how much christian you are you still have self-will god can't force nothing you want to go so you go so because you want to go so you should love yourself well but you have to die up too so you could be swedish christian you're hearing psalms bible every day you end up going to work you're just staying in the spirit backslidden as ever because if a man don't work you can't forget about it so you could stay there and you're waiting to be wrapped in a bush somewhere and some mugged in by yourself somewhere still ourselves will all right isn't that right so you have to want the will of god you say yourself of course jesus had his own so when get somebody hit him so he said lord i'm coming i'm coming i'm coming that's not in the bible i'm coming through i'm coming through you just said there's so many i'm coming no he said it's possible let this a serious thing this is not going to a picnic this is going to a cross you have to make up your mind if jesus wasn't sure he said god just give my two months on that two more months become am i not ready yet but jesus if it's possible it is good pass give it a pass in the lord give me some time how many you run on calvary calvary street this way every other street that way you're looking so you're looking so is that this way you're looking so but so is calvary but you're not focusing so you're looking looking so you don't want to see it it's always there calvary lane hasn't moved [Applause] the sign is still there this way to calvary this way to the cross this way the place are trying this way to test them come on now help me somebody help me somebody because this is the only way for characters [Applause] let me say this to me i've seen it different ways you could have the galvanized the sea man the sign and whatnot and you could boost this is all the garbage for the house all the sea men for the house or the ground for the hogs except you said to mix that thing up all it will be is galvanized cement and everything else so it's not formed into a building yet it's building potential but if you leave it there too long somebody might even steal it so in order for them to steal it you better start to build it you have to take the trench you have to put the pole you have to put the post and so on and the iron mix the cement point put foundation but that's the same thing inside of you that's a building a holy building god wants to build that in you it has to be formed inside of you and the child of your faith stop complaining the trial of your faith stop complaining the child of your faith is more precious than gold and perisher god love to see you in the battle god is getting excited i know you run sometimes i know you get scared sometimes but when god see your sons and daughter in the battle he could tip the angel off look at them look at my son he's in the heat of the fire but he's managing it come on so you could sing the song nobody knows the trouble i see nobody know about jesus yeah nobody knows but god won the trouble you see hallelujah because the best the trouble i see bring all the best in me right that's that's a rhyme i don't make that fresh the trouble i see bring out the best in me they bring on the best in you too so therefore they've got to have troubles so welcome them [Applause] my god ten percent say remember the problem ten percent now when you start to welcome trouble the devil finished devil can't get you off guard the devil he wants to impose frustration depression crying tears you're fed up you can't take it who god can't take it no more i want to say that's right that's why i'm with you on that they were talking you know i'm with you on that you really can't take it no more several times give up on them don't pray for them no more i am with you supreme i am with you on that but when you move in a way where the devil don't know if you're up or you're dumb [Applause] the devil had to get secret here you have to monitor your movements [Applause] yeah they got stalkers just talk to you he don't know what to press he don't know what button the press he pressed him this way though he's saying me and i'll trust him he pressed him this way the lord give the lord take it away he pressed him this way when the devil recognized he can't move you the devil said give up back up just leave him give up on that him try somebody else oh man i feel like running through the building that's why god told the devil look at my son job there is none like him in all the earth [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so some of you sons are looking beat up tonight i could see the devil could see it too and when the devil see you're beating up it's more like you know he had no mercy hallelujah if he could get a sick kick sick and get a sicker and then if you're complaining you know your teen is sick and sick a sicko saints are sick and if you're sicky and you start to talk that sickness so never say yes you're really sick i need to help you with your sickness but when you miss your sickness you said i am healed never said this is a strange confession when brother branham couldn't eat and the dev the doctor tell him if he even killed him he pushed it down humbled by his child i'm healed pushing the line straight up here push it over my eyes tight from the hill push it over my stripe how do you know every time you open his mouth why i challenge you this evening to take the bare word of god and stand by it oh glory to god somebody asked what i brought unto the lord tell you to run through that wall will you do it he said i will do it and by the time i get there a whole gonna be there in the world come on give the lord some praises when joshua tell those levites go down to jordan and they put the ark over their shoulder they wasn't looking at the water they were looking at what god said and those levites took the ark on their shoulder and when they start to walk down when the foot touched the jordan river the drawer don't open up you've got to walk the walk come on no i want a shout in the camp stop talk decide to walk stop talking the eldest tell joshua listen you may be seated the elders in that day joshua if they wait till april month the water will go low down we could just

and the lord tell us [Applause] there is a burden to bring back a reality of the gospel of the kingdom for 400 how much years between malachi and jesus there was nothing moving just tradition long robes and the fightful of that day so-called posing and imposing the interpretation of how messiah would come but god said john the baptist would come and cut down the mountains and make it low and a rugged man come out try to blast them as they get baptized you say bring food to me repentance don't even come to get free bibles i have nothing to offer you but the word he said he accelerated the root of every tree so he was ripping form and he was so powerful and dynamic they wanted to know if he was the messiah he said me you're here not me you won't see nothing yet he said who coming after me i'm not even worried to untie his shoelace he said he come in with fire baptism he come up with power he comes with fire he gonna baptize you with fire i put that with water but this is the fire baptizer this this has burned the snakes out they spun the demons out this burn what's wrong is putting it out [Applause] i just come to make a way because there must be a way prepared for the manifestation and brother branham said it this way amen for proving his word in the last days there's got to be a place prepared for the word to remain manifest or we are now living by the evidence of the new land amen the son of man so brother branham life was evidence of the land we go into so we can't say we don't know what it looked like he healed the sickie castle devils little fish are giving

of pentecost and there came a song from heaven so the son of man came and then the spirit came and waved over them and each one got the pillar of fire they wasn't just in the atmosphere the tongues of fire settle upon each one of them so each one of them had their kingdom had the fire had their portion had god failed and that is what this promise pillow fire back in the church who is the church you are the church till the fire back in you and when you are fire and he has fire and she has fire and i have fire and that fire come together that's the pillar of fire that's the bride [Music] so what about him says anderson wave again we realized they look something in the sunday again the sun will be revealed now watch who is the son of man in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and well among us watch and that word again is wave over the people here we go that the dead tradition of man is dead and the son of god is alive again with the baptism of the holy spirit right among us and is giving us life so i'm sure when you're right true and true praise god that the baptism of the holy ghost is what is promised judgment was fallen all over egypt and if you notice no ministers you must disagree with me on this but before the judgment started hitting egypt god sent israel to goshen they were in goshen no plague fell on them a perfect time of the church carried over through the tribulation and the last enemy the last plague that struck the earth was death now this is something we may overlook listen to these words and the last enemy that going to strike the church is depth spiritually speaking those who will not follow christ in the baptism of the holy spirit will spiritually dry up and die and that is why i am against any teaching any doctrine that quenched the desire for the holy ghost in the people any doctrine any teaching that quenched the desire for the holy ghost and the people is antichrist it is false it is demonic because any church that don't follow you with the holy ghost will spiritually die [Applause] why do you say that because isaiah prophesied that god's dark discovery earth gross darkness covered the people darkness taken over homes darkness taken over ministers darkness taken over churches take darkness they are blind leaders of the blind they are not seeing they can't lead the people because the light is not there when you turn on the word you walk into darkness oh hallelujah but arise and shine thy light is come and the glory shall be seen upon you [Applause] isaiah didn't talk no glory hidden in you the glory gonna be seen they're gonna have seen you see your glory your cop gonna run over god could be a table in the prison of your enemies you didn't know your enemies right of course you have enemies you're thinking that you think you're nice to me is that right then you don't belong to god you belong to the enemy if you don't know enemies but once you have son of god every devil in hell is against you the devil will drop on your son on your husband on your wife on your uncle on your aunt on your neighbor on the boss on whoever god ever will jump on them try to mess you and tie you up the devil job he come to steal to rob and destroy he's a dog [Applause] he's a highway robber some accident happen in your home this happened you're breaking up you're broken up you're in tears and you say good good good that is where i want you like when you're messed up like that you're in your human spirit but jesus and brother branham seem to have the mind of christ for every situation so nobody could show them off because they're dealing with the intelligence you see i caught something when samuel went to anoint david when samuel went to anoint david he didn't know was david god says one of the sons of jesse that's how god does think what can i tell him david is a man just go down there and pour you all on him before [Music] to go at all because he saw here that's what would kill him god tell him listen just tell him to come to prepare feast and invite the house of jesse so go around the whole thing just just make a spin around so when the first man come when them adamant bible whatever his name is man he's put his cologne on forget it he checks the mirror and fix his tie say good lord the anointing coming for the prideless time and then walk out there with a little punks and samuel himself saying this had to be he so is the harmony going on there he feeling like he and samuel think is he but when the intelligence dropped down god said no that's not him because god doesn't see us mansi god but this is the problem because man sees a certain way so he was teaching the prophet samuel you have to have a dissent don't go by outward appearance and holy cologne smelling and how his tie is well fixed matching his shoes and mashing his socks don't go by that but go by the inward part of the heart and you've got to be in the spirit to discern that so when when when samuel caught it he said i checked him out now on the inner man not him not him not him keep on walking keep on walking next next next next when the last one passes wait a minute all done he said i ain't got no witness he said you have any more where is god they say yeah we are one he gave everybody he's a little shepherd [Applause] he's seen about sheep he says sign for david i wouldn't sit down until david come when they will come david stink up david smelly david they have no cologne david young david looking so out of it hallelujah god said this is he no no these other guys know their passing tests they know they pass through they they know they failed they know they didn't make it so they can't flex with what god has to do now so they got a he man samuel take the hold on and just pour it and leave it we call it that oil long he just get the whole oil or just go right down hallelujah just oil him down david do you even know what's going on david just oh what what is this they may come back to the sheep david is no anointed king [Applause] now watch what is happening in the spirit realm the same hour david anointed the same hour evil spirit come upon saul gave it gift it's predestinated to play the harp his gift is predestinated to run them demons so when saul gets his upset and his problem they say we know somebody's skillful in the heart this is sent for david and i'm telling you they're going to send for you come on i i want to i want to kind of finish off here eventually they're going to send for you so here come the david playing harp in his castle david playing up you're not hearing what i'm saying saul don't know the kingdom has already been removed it's only a matter of time you see this is what the devil didn't cater for he thought he we could cut off in the 70s but george he thought we're going to finish in the 80s when the 90s hit he said we're not going to make it but here we are 2014 and we just as strong as when we started out oh hallelujah just as strong [Applause] [Music] [Applause] say lord don't use my eyes use my heart give me the discernment oh that's why you're supposed to look at the person's motive and objective what somebody want to achieve oh hallelujah so my god hallelujah praise god praise god god provided a place called goshel and there is coming a spirit of death upon the land that's what i was scared of all along to be caught up in a spirit of death where people going to church in formality they're going to church because they have no place else to go it can't be that jesus i come that you might have life and have it more abundantly not come to you to exist and struggle and get fight in church or you come to church and fight in the church this is a place to be empowered this is a church to get your sword this is a church to be sharper this is what the house of god is for [Applause] praise god not a bunch of confusion when you finish from the house of god you're supposed to feel empowered as a father when you go home to your children as a husband when you go back to your wife as a wife when you go back to your husband you're supposed to feel empowered as a daughter of sarah as a son of abraham as a priest of the most high god [Applause] having the ability to bring your sacrifice [Applause] [Music] [Applause] or some elder or some deacon you understand by revelation that he didn't come to be a blessing he come to share the blessing you understand by revelation when the lamb took the book he didn't take it for himself he wasn't feeling bookish he wasn't going to hold a book he liked book he liked to read books it wasn't about that it had names in the book he wanted to release those names those names were in captivity those people didn't know who they were you had to have to release who you are and you are the word you are the german you are to be released from the thoughts of god by the word of god [Applause] i don't know i want to finish off listen to this a word had to be created a thought is in the mind of god a word had to create it god said let there be light was a word seed and that word could have remained a thousand years but all of a sudden that word have life in itself all of a sudden that word manifests itself and the word produce light that's the word being vindicated that's the word being manifested the word have to be vindicated in order to be light people could say what they want but when the light is made manifest when the word is made manifest that is the light [Applause] see it again the word itself is not the light the word manifested that is the light so when god speak a word to you that's a word to you but when that word is manifested [Applause] that's the light that's the light oh hallelujah oh glory to god watch god provide a place called goshen there's coming a spirit of death upon the land death is the reason we die israel had to have something to keep them from dying and it was the blood over the door that god could remove the debt it was sentenced it was the penalty it was released the angel itself was released by the gerald to take out anyone who's not under the blood god had no jurisdiction upon anyone who was not under the blood he said when i see the blood i'm gonna pass over he released that angel to knuckle to kill everyone who was not under the blood and the seven thunders is the blood of jesus the seven thunders is the blood that god has covered all these years that's why we are alive [Applause] do you understand without the seven thunders we'll be reaching six seals on our way to the tribulation i know it did not but because we have a blood because of the fullness of the atonement not just the atonement but the atonement in its fullness no blood no anointing no blood no power no blood no authority the blood give us authority right now we don't need more power but we have authority by the blood we have confidence that when we speak we speak through the blood there is no sin when the blood is dear because the blood speaks better things than the blood the blood of god speaks faith in your doubt speak weak virtue in your weakness speak knowledge in your ignorance it's the blood of god over your life it's a pyramid in your soul it's the word pyramid in mechanic form let me try to finish off here oh hallelujah oh glory to god but listen to this bomb when spiritual darkness gets upon the earth it is time for the enemy to attack the devil is born when the spiritual darkness come upon the earth it's time for the enemy to attack watch we see fearful sights earthquakes tidal waves falling away gross darkness heavy high-minded lovers of pleasures watch that's what the world is pointing to but the church has another sign a blessed call outside he promised here we go he promised you want to hear your sign you want to hear your sign he promised that there will be laterin in the church the church spiritual in the last days he will pour out put the former and the lattering the former income first the lateran comes second both former and later in in the same season he promised it so what i'm supposed to look for some man coming no man could pick a revival if man could i bring it we had it already it takes the people to bring the revival you got to know who you are [Applause] oh my god well here we go the sun is the word of god yes in the beginning was to let it be light and when the manifested word here we go when the word of god was manifested there was light first god spoke it what if it didn't manifest that it wasn't like yet but when he spoke it and then it was manifested or vindicated his word was vindicated light come to existence and that's the only way it can be done now is when the word is vindicated god's written word vindicated it shows light oh blessed be the name of the lord do you believe that hallelujah gross darkness blinding of israel was for the lightning of the gentiles not the blind of the gentiles it's the lightning of israel god blind the jews that the gentiles might see no quarters about the blind the gentiles that the jews might see cross doctors but i miss all of that darkness there's going to be light oh hallelujah light in your life because the spoken word manifest is the light coming to your life oh hallelujah praise god praise god good people caught up sincere people watch like mary and joseph they were sincere they were presuming jesus was with them but they missed jesus isn't that right and there are many preachers people put their names on the book many thought they were sprinkled and confirmed baptism fires on holy ghost but the fact is that he wasn't there what is light question the vindicated spoken word of god outside of that there's no light it takes god word made manifest how can there be darkness and light it can't be dark and light together they can't fellowship together and the bible said and god separated the light from the darkness and the lackness he called night and the light he called thee so god has separate the light from the darkness he don't want to mix up light and darkness he does separate the light from the darkness so once light start to come he'll have to separate it and light just push back darkness that's why the darkness of a revival the attackers have to be pushed together when the lights have to come something got to move people will never come together they have to come together because light is pushing light is coming as the light coming the doctors have to gather together and somebody because the light is coming oh hallelujah what's that like that's the morning starlight that's the light of the uncommon sun reflecting upon the stars of god him not overcome it will like bring the morning star and that star gonna reflect the light and as the sunlight hit that star you are that star and at the sunlight at you you're gonna reflect the uncommon sun you're gonna reflect the coming of the lord oh give the lord some praise people oh hallelujah glory the darkness is separating itself from the light god is causing it the light is doing it god is causing it the light is doing it the light is pressing itself in such a way until the darkness has to congregate together they had a chance to accept it and they won't do it so it condenses itself so today we are now living god has to come on the scene here we go now ah let me hope stretch god has to come on the scene to vindicate and prove his promises it's the light of the hour so we can rise and shine the light shines upon us today the world is being manifest that is the light oh hallelujah oh hallelujah just a few more minutes again and we'll be done this is important the world had to unite titus this roman general half the united armies together after these jews rejected the god-given sign to them that's the time titus united his army together and come to take the city they have to be a uniting of god's people so-called against the word of god so listen before national force come in effect before the press come down it has to have the people in this message fight the true word in this message [Applause] everything is hinged upon the inner battle [Applause] let me read it for you oh hallelujah watch this they rejected him turn him out crucify him when they rejected the salvation that was sent to them they united themselves together all that in mind united themselves together to reject the message of the hour they had to do that and when they did that then the national sign come in what did baran says national force will put the world forces in the church and the welcomes are churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride you understand what national force government edict [Music] and how do they have all these southern mice in america right now if they pass that as a national law federal law it means to say you cannot deny marrying those characters because i will be contrary to federal law then they could shut down the churches they could close that down that because that would be the law that i'm going with god's law that's man's stuff amen and god see that as sad among the more repeat thank you just that brother martin luther king had a community spirit upon him i will cause what he writes all to die and people to die and stuff but wrong talk about that or what happened now that seed was so in the 60s look at coming to harvest today it's a spirit so therefore all the riots whatever it is in the spirit coming to a harvest the sodomite is the spirit coming to harvest what about the bride every seed have to come into a harvest and that perfect man's statue have to come to a harvest glory to god hallelujah there is one light musician come on please there is not methodist baptist person christ is the light and the light is the life and here we get it from and the word manifested is the light of the hour last quote from ephesians 2 and i'm done but receiving could come to the side here and let them hear what the spirit said in the churches how tragic it is that this first age did not listen to the spirit instead of listening to man but thank god in the last age there will be a group rise up the true bride of the last day she would listen to the spirit in the day of gross darkness the light will return by the pure world and we will return to the power of pentecost to welcome back the lord jesus christ that's my final quote god bless you [Applause] oh let's all stand and worship the lord [Applause] [Music] thank you lord blessed be your
