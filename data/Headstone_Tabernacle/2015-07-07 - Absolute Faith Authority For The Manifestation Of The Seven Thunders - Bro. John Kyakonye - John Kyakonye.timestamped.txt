[1:03:05] Matthew Chapter
[1:03:13] 2 first and second
[1:03:18] [Music]
[1:03:19] verse now after J after Jesus was born
[1:03:23] in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of
[1:03:26] Herod the king behold wise men from the
[1:03:30] East came to
[1:03:41] Jerusalem
[1:03:42] saying where is the where is he who has
[1:03:46] been born King of the
[1:03:48] Jews for we have seen
[1:03:51] his we have seen
[1:03:54] his in East and have come to worship Him
[1:04:07] amen amen amen you may be seated God
[1:04:11] bless the reading of the
[1:04:14] word
[1:04:17] so I I I have
[1:04:21] thought men of
[1:04:24] vision amen
[1:04:26] what it's important
[1:04:29] today what our strength
[1:04:33] today what is our power
[1:04:37] today is a
[1:04:41] vision and every one of
[1:04:44] us must have the
[1:04:48] vision I don't speak about each man each
[1:04:54] Vision each man a
[1:04:57] vision I have a vision you have another
[1:05:01] Vision this one have another Vision I
[1:05:04] don't speak about I speak about the
[1:05:13] VIS now there is a
[1:05:16] difference between
[1:05:18] Revelation and
[1:05:20] vision Revelation is something that is
[1:05:24] here yeah here
[1:05:27] something that is
[1:05:29] here but you need a revelation to see
[1:05:33] it but the thing is
[1:05:36] here but you need a revelation from
[1:05:40] God vision is
[1:05:43] different vision is something that is
[1:05:47] coming something that is not here
[1:05:51] yet but you need something from God to
[1:05:55] see
[1:05:57] it and you must see it before he
[1:06:01] comes there is a great difference
[1:06:04] between Revelation and
[1:06:06] vision the time of the Revelation
[1:06:10] is beginning a long
[1:06:15] time now we come to the time of
[1:06:19] vision to let the word of God the promis
[1:06:23] go of
[1:06:24] God
[1:06:26] be
[1:06:27] accomplished be
[1:06:33] manifested amongst the Bride of Jesus
[1:06:37] Christ we have we need to have
[1:06:42] vision and there is only one Vision
[1:06:46] there is not so many
[1:06:49] Vision that's the problem with the
[1:06:51] message so many
[1:06:54] vision but God sent
[1:06:59] men
[1:07:01] men with a
[1:07:04] vision do you
[1:07:07] understand this is very
[1:07:09] important I hope you this is uh sealed
[1:07:14] in your
[1:07:16] heart until the coming of the
[1:07:19] Lord
[1:07:21] hallelujah amen I
[1:07:24] speak
[1:07:26] no we don't have personal
[1:07:29] Vision the vision the vision we receive
[1:07:33] is from the word of the
[1:07:37] lord it's not personal
[1:07:39] Vision so the three wise men had
[1:07:46] vision and you
[1:07:48] know they all sees the same
[1:07:53] vision brother spoke
[1:07:57] about the three

[1:08:05] ago and now they produce the same three
[1:08:10] stars on
[1:08:13] June and the men saw
[1:08:17] them
[1:08:19] Hallelujah and the three wise
[1:08:22] men because this is this this is a great
[1:08:25] sign for
[1:08:26] us in the last
[1:08:30] months in the last
[1:08:32] year many things signs many signs come
[1:08:38] come above the the the
[1:08:41] Earth and many signs are above the

[1:50:43] Here uh my title is the absolute Faith
[1:50:48] Authority for the manifestation of the
[1:50:51] seven Thunders
[1:50:57] yes the absolute Faith
[1:51:00] Authority for the seven Thunder
[1:51:07] manifestation and my
[1:51:09] inspiration is that fear is the greatest
[1:51:11] robber of our
[1:51:17] blessings blessed be the name of the
[1:51:20] Lord so what can we say about brother's
[1:51:23] testimony
[1:51:26] yesterday brother God bless
[1:51:29] you surely love produces
[1:51:35] faith that was
[1:51:37] wonderful and what can we say about
[1:51:39] brother
[1:51:41] zigma brother zma God bless
[1:51:45] you for that
[1:51:47] testimony about the Holy Ghost
[1:51:51] experience
[1:51:53] and surely that's what we
[1:51:57] need not to be scholarly
[1:52:02] believers who who are dead
[1:52:09] for and brother bam said when you are
[1:52:12] born
[1:52:14] again he said you will never be
[1:52:17] satisfied
[1:52:19] with Creeds and doctrines
[1:52:24] you will always thirst for the
[1:52:30] Supernatural That's why we are crying
[1:52:32] out for a
[1:52:35] manifestation of the
[1:52:38] seven blessed be the name of the
[1:52:41] Lord and brother Z thank you for the
[1:52:45] vision sure we have a
[1:52:48] vision bless be the name of the
[1:52:51] Lord now I have a little quotation
[1:52:56] here um it is from the message um um
[1:53:00] possessing the gates of the enemy after
[1:53:05] trium brother bam was preaching about
[1:53:13] organizations and he said he told us how
[1:53:15] that the
[1:53:17] organization religious
[1:53:21] organizations actually followed those
[1:53:23] great spiritual
[1:53:26] men men like
[1:53:29] no men like
[1:53:32] Billy men like Luther
[1:53:37] Wesley men like
[1:53:40] M they never started those
[1:53:45] organizations but those organization
[1:53:48] followed
[1:53:50] them after they died
[1:53:53] the people that remain
[1:53:56] behind cut their ways into what those
[1:54:00] men
[1:54:04] preached they said
[1:54:06] this and said
[1:54:08] that cut away
[1:54:11] this and added
[1:54:13] this and very soon they ended up with an
[1:54:18] organization but then brother bam says
[1:54:22] but the real spiritual minded
[1:54:27] people the real humble
[1:54:30] people who had the mind of
[1:54:34] Christ he said they never looked to
[1:54:38] that they looked to the
[1:54:42] word that's
[1:54:44] why we are looking back to what malach
[1:54:50] say we are not hearing what a bunch of
[1:54:53] men are
[1:54:55] saying you either give us what
[1:55:00] said all give us
[1:55:03] death blessed be the name of the
[1:55:06] Lord therefore we
[1:55:09] know that the seven Thunder
[1:55:13] Revival is not going to be a
[1:55:18] denomination going to end up to end up
[1:55:20] an organization
[1:55:24] because we have a
[1:55:26] vision the word must be
[1:55:29] manifested everything God spoke through
[1:55:34] Malachi we we are here waiting for the
[1:55:40] manifestation of the seven
[1:55:43] promises oh blessed be the name of the
[1:55:46] Lord we have a
[1:55:48] vision you can be
[1:55:50] seated now listen to what the prophet
[1:55:53] said
[1:55:55] here now in the
[1:55:58] message the way to have
[1:56:02] Fellowship preached
[1:56:08] 1955 he preached it
[1:56:12] 1955 paragraph
[1:56:14] 26 it says that's the trouble with man
[1:56:19] tonight that's what's the trouble with
[1:56:23] people
[1:56:25] tonight you are
[1:56:27] scared that's the
[1:56:31] biggest there is on the Full Gospel
[1:56:35] people all on any other
[1:56:38] people is because they are
[1:56:42] afraid God has made it a
[1:56:46] provision but you afraid to take his
[1:56:48] word for
[1:56:50] it if he wasn't afraid
[1:56:54] tonight why would you take your healing
[1:56:57] by
[1:56:59] faith and know that God promised
[1:57:03] it and the thing would just go Plum away
[1:57:06] from
[1:57:08] you afraid
[1:57:12] scared and have
[1:57:14] not and that's the reason I'm such a
[1:57:17] believer in
[1:57:20] healing I know that if you can get away
[1:57:23] from that
[1:57:26] scare and get love in its
[1:57:30] place something is going to
[1:57:33] happen blessed be the name of the
[1:57:36] Lord now in this
[1:57:40] quotation is talking about the
[1:57:44] provision God has given us the
[1:57:49] provision which is his word
[1:57:53] the
[1:57:54] promises the seven Thunder
[1:58:01] seeds we know what the prophet spoke
[1:58:03] about the
[1:58:08] bride we know what he promised the
[1:58:13] brain but he said the
[1:58:16] problem is that people are
[1:58:21] scared and he says they are afraid to
[1:58:25] take God at his
[1:58:28] word and he said that is the greatest
[1:58:33] Cur being
[1:58:36] scared to take God at his
[1:58:40] word being
[1:58:42] afraid to take God at his
[1:58:45] word brother says it is the greatest
[1:58:51] C am that's where I got the
[1:58:55] inspiration that fear is the greatest
[1:59:01] robber of our
[1:59:05] blessing in another place brother I'm
[1:59:07] talking about
[1:59:10] fear he says fear is the greatest
[1:59:16] plague today in the world everybody is
[1:59:19] afraid of
[1:59:21] abor
[1:59:23] but e is not the greatest
[1:59:26] plan
[1:59:29] fear brother said fear is the greatest
[1:59:34] plague and in another place brother said
[1:59:37] fear is of the
[1:59:40] devil and in another
[1:59:43] message the state of the perfect
[1:59:47] man showed us why fear is
[1:59:51] deading
[1:59:54] because because he said what you fear
[1:59:58] happens and what you believe
[2:00:02] happen
[2:00:05] actually fear is perverted
[2:00:10] fa fear is the opposite of
[2:00:15] Faith so fear is
[2:00:19] deadling it is the greatest C
[2:00:23] it is the greatest
[2:00:25] plague and in another place brother bam
[2:00:27] says fear is the greatest
[2:00:32] hindrance actually what is hindering
[2:00:36] us to see the
[2:00:40] manifestation of the Prophet
[2:00:43] prophecy what is hindering
[2:00:46] us to see the
[2:00:49] manifestation of the word PR to the
[2:00:53] bride is
[2:00:56] fear the word is
[2:00:59] right God keeps his
[2:01:02] word brother saying when God speaks
[2:01:08] something isound to his
[2:01:12] [Music]
[2:01:14] word to his
[2:01:17] word to fulfill
[2:01:19] it God is under obligation
[2:01:25] to God is under to his
[2:01:30] word
[2:01:32] to if it
[2:01:35] God to live the heavens
[2:01:40] bankrupt to leave the heavens
[2:01:43] empty God will rather leave the heavens
[2:01:49] empty than to let his word f
[2:01:54] blessed be the name of the
[2:01:56] Lord God's word can never
[2:02:00] fail that's why God says in the
[2:02:03] Bible shall my word
[2:02:06] be proceeds out of my
[2:02:08] mouth it shall never turn to me
[2:02:14] void
[2:02:16] it what I sent it

[2:19:06] bride that had the manifestation of the
[2:19:09] word of
[2:19:11] God because a
[2:19:14] Revival 77 Church

[2:19:25] power blessed be the name of the
[2:19:28] Lord we have talked and talked and
[2:19:31] talked and
[2:19:33] talked but now we want to
[2:19:37] manifest the world is not waiting for
[2:19:41] talking is waiting for
[2:19:43] [Music]
[2:19:45] manifesting of what the prophet
[2:19:47] say blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:19:51] our reputation is at
[2:19:54] stake our names are at
[2:19:58] stake and the only thing that is going
[2:20:00] to save
[2:20:02] us a
[2:20:05] manifestation of what the prophet said
[2:20:07] about
[2:20:09] the bless be the name of the
[2:20:12] Lord when the critics see the
[2:20:17] manifestation when the world see the
[2:20:19] manifestation
[2:20:22] what the prophet said about
[2:20:23] [Music]
[2:20:25] the then the critic's mouth will be
[2:20:30] closed so that's why we we we we need a
[2:20:36] manifestation it will take your
[2:20:40] faith the word is
[2:20:43] right the seven promises are
[2:20:46] right and God is dy bound to his word
[2:20:52] to manifest it God is under obligation
[2:20:56] to his

[2:21:10] fail Jesus said Heaven and Earth shall
[2:21:13] pass
[2:21:14] away but my word shall never pass
[2:21:18] away shall be fulfilled
[2:21:29] fear is the greatest
[2:21:32] robber of our
[2:21:34] blessings fear is the
[2:21:37] greatest fear is the greatest
[2:21:41] plague fear is the greatest
[2:21:44] hindrance the word is
[2:21:47] right but we are afraid to take God at
[2:21:52] why blessed be the name of the
[2:21:55] Lord hallelujah hallelujah you can be
[2:21:59] seated so God is God is waiting on
[2:22:04] us the Dynamics is
[2:22:07] here the mechanics is
[2:22:09] here and so is the
[2:22:13] Dynamics but God is waiting on
[2:22:18] us to get started
[2:22:22] and the Lord will do the
[2:22:25] rest blessed be the name of the
[2:22:28] Lord oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah you can
[2:22:31] be
[2:22:33] seated I want to read another quote
[2:22:37] here blessed be the name of the
[2:22:41] Lord oh hallelujah oh
[2:22:44] Hallelujah listen to
[2:22:49] this
[2:22:51] you know when I came in I came in with
[2:22:53] my tablet
[2:22:56] [Music]
[2:22:58] but yesterday he just stopped
[2:23:05] working so I'm using one which I'm not
[2:23:08] very much used
[2:23:11] to brother
[2:23:15] brother brother Johny got me one that
[2:23:17] I'm
[2:23:19] using
[2:23:21] so I'm trying to tr for my quotes
[2:23:27] here I know them I can speak
[2:23:34] them but you know when you read
[2:23:38] them then people know you are not making
[2:23:41] them
[2:23:44] out you are
[2:23:49] exonerated bless the name of the
[2:23:52] Lord so there's a quotation
[2:23:55] here it is in Hebrews part
[2:23:59] three Hebrews part
[2:24:03] 3 the prophet was speaking
[2:24:07] about the power the bride
[2:24:16] has and he was saying he was saying oh
[2:24:22] if the church only
[2:24:25] recognize its power to do the
[2:24:29] things Matthew chapter
[2:24:33] 18 whatever you bind on
[2:24:36] Earth shall be bound in
[2:24:39] heaven and what whatsoever you lose on
[2:24:44] Earth shall be loed in
[2:24:47] heaven so that is the quote I'm looking
[2:24:50] for
[2:24:53] if the church
[2:24:57] recognizes to do these
[2:25:02] things it says but instead there's so
[2:25:05] much
[2:25:08] fear and so much
[2:25:11] doubt and so much
[2:25:14] trembling they are
[2:25:17] wondering if these things can be
[2:25:22] which things the promises
[2:25:27] PR they look at the
[2:25:30] promises but they wondering can they
[2:25:36] be and there's too much faith in the
[2:25:39] bride and
[2:25:42] trembling and
[2:25:45] doubt it's l it is Hebrews chapter 7
[2:25:48] part 3
[2:25:52] that's the state the bride is
[2:25:54] [Music]
[2:25:56] in but I wanted to read it because it is
[2:25:58] very
[2:26:02] powerful but I'm failing to operate this
[2:26:05] thing
[2:26:09] man blessed be the name of the
[2:26:13] Lord I'm failing to operate it it's a
[2:26:17] very powerful
[2:26:18] quotation see
[2:26:22] so the point that brother is bringing
[2:26:24] out of that
[2:26:31] quotation is talking about the
[2:26:35] potential the
[2:26:37] power The
[2:26:40] Authority the blessings the
[2:26:44] Privileges that we as Believers
[2:26:49] have and at the same time he's
[2:26:54] wondering that instead of the Bride
[2:26:56] recognizing the power that she
[2:27:00] has there so much
[2:27:04] fear and
[2:27:06] doubt and
[2:27:08] trembling and wondering whether these
[2:27:10] things can
[2:27:13] happen and then he says as long as that
[2:27:18] exist as long as what
[2:27:21] exist fear doubts and
[2:27:24] trembling as long as it exist in the
[2:27:27] brain it say the chur will never stand
[2:27:34] upright we will never stand
[2:27:36] upright then he goes on and says when
[2:27:39] all talk of fear is
[2:27:43] gone spirit is in full control of the
[2:27:49] church said that's when we shall have
[2:27:53] power and he says all Heaven is behind
[2:27:56] [Music]
[2:27:58] us all what heaven
[2:28:02] owns is behind
[2:28:05] us why do we sit
[2:28:09] torment blessed be the name of the
[2:28:12] Lord blessed be the name of the
[2:28:14] Lord oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah God
[2:28:17] bless you brother
[2:28:19] Elijah
[2:28:20] it says
[2:28:22] here all powers of Heaven and Earth is
[2:28:25] given into my
[2:28:28] hand go and I will go with
[2:28:33] you whatever you bind on
[2:28:37] Earth are bind in
[2:28:39] heaven and what you lose on
[2:28:43] Earth I will lose in
[2:28:45] heaven then he says
[2:28:48] oh the Great
[2:28:51] church if oh if the great holy
[2:28:57] church only realize it
[2:29:01] power to do these
[2:29:04] things but there is so much
[2:29:08] doubt Mark The Prophet's
[2:29:11] words he never said there is a
[2:29:15] doubt he never said there is a little
[2:29:18] doubt he never said is some
[2:29:21] doubt but he says but
[2:29:24] oh if the great holy
[2:29:27] church only realiz it power to
[2:29:31] do but there is so much
[2:29:35] doubt and
[2:29:38] fear and
[2:29:40] trembling and
[2:29:43] wondering if it
[2:29:45] will could it could it
[2:29:49] happen as long as that
[2:29:53] exists as long as what
[2:29:57] exist much
[2:30:00] doubt and fear and trembling and
[2:30:05] wondering if it will if it will could it
[2:30:09] happen as long as that
[2:30:12] exists the church can never stand
[2:30:17] upright and when every talk of is
[2:30:21] vanished and the Holy Spirit is
[2:30:23] completely in
[2:30:27] control of the church then all fears are
[2:30:31] gone and that and and that church has
[2:30:35] the
[2:30:38] power why they have everything that
[2:30:41] heaven owns behind
[2:30:44] it ambassadors of the
[2:30:48] throne absolutely ABS an ambassador of
[2:30:53] Christ has the
[2:30:55] authority and anything that Christ
[2:30:58] owns belongs to that
[2:31:01] Ambassador and he
[2:31:03] said
[2:31:05] go into all the
[2:31:07] world you are my
[2:31:10] Witnesses after the Holy Ghost is come
[2:31:12] on
[2:31:14] you and what is a
[2:31:16] witness is an
[2:31:18] ambassador is to come and witness
[2:31:23] something all powers of
[2:31:26] heaven right in your
[2:31:31] hands why do you
[2:31:34] set and the church is
[2:31:37] bar and and we sit
[2:31:41] Tor it's because that we don't recognize
[2:31:45] these
[2:31:47] things oh blessed be the name of
[2:31:52] so you see fear
[2:31:54] doubts

[2:32:01] word blessed be the name of the
[2:32:04] Lord oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah so

[2:32:21] to
[2:32:26] us but we are pushing it to the Future

[2:32:37] fear doubts and
[2:32:40] trembling and being afraid to take God
[2:32:43] at his
[2:32:46] word we have no more time
[2:32:51] and
[2:32:54] remember that we have to begin with the
[2:32:58] small
[2:33:01] punches before we can be
[2:33:05] able to knock out our
[2:33:15] opponents am let us not
[2:33:18] think manifestation of these
[2:33:22] promises would drop like a
[2:33:26] bomb boom and it will start shaking the
[2:33:28] world with the power of

[2:34:12] growing time will
[2:34:14] come too much
[2:34:17] power and we shall shake it world
[2:34:21] the dead will be
[2:34:23] raised bless be the name of the

[2:35:10] bride to
[2:35:13] maturity and those who will bring the
[2:35:17] tears to maturity

[2:41:55] fasting standing on the
[2:41:57] promise she stepped out and went into
[2:42:00] the
[2:42:03] king and
[2:42:05] said if I perish I

[2:43:06] Lord then listen you can be
[2:43:09] seated in this message God called
[2:43:14] man I have all the quotes here but I
[2:43:16] failed to operate it
[2:43:20] it says he he says this is what he says
[2:43:23] it says people are crying for
[2:43:26] [Music]
[2:43:28] Revival and and surely we in the
[2:43:32] Thunders we are crying for
[2:43:36] Revival and don't
[2:43:41] forget
[2:43:43] churches a Revival is a move of God in
[2:43:48] power
[2:43:49] blessed be the name of the Lord and he
[2:43:52] says people are crying for
[2:43:54] Revival and he said I
[2:43:58] wonder whether their
[2:44:01] prayers are not just blocking The
[2:44:04] Fountains of
[2:44:08] blessings they praying for Revival they
[2:44:12] crying for
[2:44:13] Revival instead of their prayers losing
[2:44:16] the Fountain of bless
[2:44:21] their prayer just closes the
[2:44:26] fountain why because they are afraid to
[2:44:31] take his
[2:44:34] word they crying for Revival
[2:44:37] but to take God at his
[2:44:41] word yet the scriptures
[2:44:46] de that Jesus Christ it's the same
[2:44:50] yesterday it's the same
[2:44:52] today and it's the same
[2:44:55] forever so however much we cry for
[2:45:01] Revival if we remain
[2:45:04] scared and
[2:45:07] Afraid and
[2:45:09] doubting and
[2:45:12] trembling We Fear to take God at his
[2:45:16] word those prayers just close the
[2:45:23] fountain do you see where the problem
[2:45:28] is
[2:45:30] fear the word is
[2:45:33] right God is Duty bound to his
[2:45:37] word obligation to his
[2:45:40] [Music]
[2:45:42] word to his
[2:45:45] word Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[2:45:48] forever
[2:45:50] the problem is we are afid we are afraid
[2:45:53] to take at his
[2:45:56] word on the word of the Living
[2:45:59] God Be The Name Of The
[2:46:02] Lord yet the
[2:46:05] scriptures Jesus Christ is
[2:46:09] the oh blessed be the name of the
[2:46:12] Lord so it is the
[2:46:14] fear that's where the problem
[2:46:17] is we are not lacking
[2:46:21] power we have
[2:46:23] power in that message the ever water
[2:46:27] from the
[2:46:28] [Music]
[2:46:30] rock the everes water from the
[2:46:34] Rock
[2:46:35] brother in that message the ever present
[2:46:38] water from
[2:46:40] the it speaks about any believer that is
[2:46:44] born
[2:46:46] [Music]
[2:46:47] again any believer that is born
[2:46:51] again and how are you born
[2:46:54] again by receiving the Holy
[2:46:58] Ghost it says every believer that is
[2:47:01] Born
[2:47:03] Again In
[2:47:05] you you have enough
[2:47:09] power to create another
[2:47:14] world in you you have enough power
[2:47:20] to raise the
[2:47:22] dead to heal the
[2:47:24] sick because he says in God there is no
[2:47:27] two
[2:47:32] parts there's no weak little
[2:47:36] part and there is no strong powerful
[2:47:40] part so Brothers there is no
[2:47:43] excuse sister there is no
[2:47:46] excuse once you are born again
[2:47:51] you have God in
[2:47:53] you the holy spirit in
[2:47:55] you and that is enough power in
[2:47:59] you to create a new
[2:48:02] world to put stars in the
[2:48:06] Orit to raise the
[2:48:08] dead to heal the
[2:48:11] sick but he
[2:48:13] said even if you just have a shadow of
[2:48:16] God in
[2:48:17] you
[2:48:19] even if it is just a shadow of God in
[2:48:23] you that is enough power in
[2:48:27] you bless be the name of the
[2:48:30] Lord hallelujah hallelujah but it takes
[2:48:33] your
[2:48:35] faith Tak your
[2:48:38] fath it takes your
[2:48:40] fa bless
[2:48:43] Lord that's why Jesus say all things are
[2:48:48] possible
[2:48:50] to them that
[2:48:51] believe all things are
[2:48:54] possible to them that
[2:48:57] believe it is your
[2:49:00] faith you can be seated God bless
[2:49:03] you hallelujah oh Hallelujah and the
[2:49:06] scripture we read in
[2:49:09] James James 1 verse
[2:49:14] 5 it says if anyone of you lacks wisdom
[2:49:22] let him ask of
[2:49:25] God who will he hold
[2:49:28] not but gives Liber to
[2:49:32] all but with a
[2:49:35] caution let him ask in
[2:49:39] faith nothing
[2:49:43] wavering because the person that
[2:49:46] wavers is like a wave d
[2:49:49] by the wind on the
[2:49:54] sea is a double minded
[2:49:59] person in his
[2:50:02] ways then he
[2:50:04] says let not that person
[2:50:08] think he will get anything from the
[2:50:16] Lord let him ask in faith
[2:50:22] if the world is ever going to see the
[2:50:24] god of
[2:50:27] Elijah we have to wake
[2:50:30] up somebody has to wake
[2:50:34] up and take
[2:50:38] promises take God at his
[2:50:42] word proclaim that the word is
[2:50:46] Right Proclaim that God does
[2:50:50] exist that the message the Bible is
[2:50:54] true and that Mal message is
[2:50:59] Right blessed be the name of the
[2:51:02] Lord hallelujah hallelujah so
[2:51:06] fear is the greatest
[2:51:09] robber that has robbed us of our
[2:51:16] blessing blessed be the name of the Lord
[2:51:20] and in that
[2:51:21] message perfect
[2:51:24] faith
[2:51:26] brother when he preached that
[2:51:29] message in his
[2:51:31] court the pocket of his
[2:51:35] court he had a
[2:51:39] shell a
[2:51:42] bullet he took time to go
[2:51:46] out and get the r material that makes a
[2:51:53] bullet the prophet took
[2:51:56] time to look for the material that they
[2:51:59] use to make
[2:52:04] bullets he got the
[2:52:08] explosives he got the
[2:52:12] shell and he got the
[2:52:17] projectile that pointed the part of the
[2:52:23] bullet and he took time to study the
[2:52:25] science of
[2:52:30] ballistics which is the science of
[2:52:32] bullets and
[2:52:36] firearms in order to know the power of
[2:52:39] that bullet he
[2:52:40] [Music]
[2:52:44] made and he put it
[2:52:47] together and made that
[2:52:51] bullet and the day he preached the
[2:52:53] perfect
[2:52:54] fa he came with it in his
[2:53:02] pocket and that message perfect faith
[2:53:05] has many highlights in
[2:53:10] it so when he touched the highlight of
[2:53:15] the power being present in the church
[2:53:22] to demonstrate what he was
[2:53:27] saying he took that bullet out of his
[2:53:31] pocket and raised it
[2:53:34] up to the
[2:53:37] congregation and he says here in my
[2:53:41] hand I have a
[2:53:45] shell which I hand loed myself
[2:53:50] and by
[2:53:52] ballistics I know what it can
[2:53:57] [Applause]
[2:53:58] do and he went on and said
[2:54:02] but it cannot do
[2:54:04] anything until the
[2:54:07] Fire gets to the
[2:54:10] [Applause]
[2:54:12] powder and explodes it
[2:54:16] out and then he said it's the same thing
[2:54:19] with the
[2:54:21] church the Bride of Jesus
[2:54:24] Christ he said the power is
[2:54:28] present the holy spirit is present in
[2:54:31] the
[2:54:34] church but there is no
[2:54:37] faith to fire
[2:54:39] it and send it
[2:54:42] off in order that we can see great
[2:54:47] works
[2:54:48] that's where it
[2:54:51] is and he says the disciples had the
[2:54:57] power but they did not have faith to
[2:54:59] move the
[2:55:04] power there is theam Tabernacle
[2:55:09] today in that same
[2:55:11] condition with the power but without the
[2:55:15] faith to move the
[2:55:17] power church
[2:55:19] today in that
[2:55:21] condition the power without faith to
[2:55:25] move the
[2:55:29] power and my
[2:55:32] brothers ever since I came to the sth th
[2:55:34] inspiration in
[2:55:36] [Music]
[2:55:39] 1991 if there are people on Earth that
[2:55:42] have the Holy
[2:55:44] Ghost it is the Believers of the seven
[2:55:47] Thunder inspiration
[2:55:50] because it is our cure almost in every
[2:55:54] meeting to cry out for the Holy
[2:56:02] Ghost refering of the ho
[2:56:05] ghost wave after wave of the Holy
[2:56:10] Ghost but what are we using it
[2:56:17] for is
[2:56:19] there the power is
[2:56:22] present but there is no faith to move
[2:56:25] the
[2:56:27] power instead there's too much fear
[2:56:30] doubts and
[2:56:34] trembling we are
[2:56:36] afraid we are
[2:56:39] scared to take God at his
[2:56:42] word be the name of the
[2:56:45] Lord that's where the problem is
[2:56:50] and we are pushing it to the Future
[2:56:52] pushing it to the
[2:56:55] future we have to start
[2:57:01] now blessed be the name of the
[2:57:04] Lord we have to start
[2:57:08] now we want to see a
[2:57:12] manifestation of the seven Thunder
[2:57:15] promises we have to start now
[2:57:19] the power is
[2:57:21] present the word is
[2:57:25] here God cannot
[2:57:28] deceive blessed be the name of the
[2:57:32] Lord and listen to just two quotes and I
[2:57:36] [Music]
[2:57:40] finish seven Church
[2:57:44] ages
[2:57:47] 300
[2:57:50] huu listen what the prophet said
[2:57:52] here P
[2:57:55] 301 he says who dare to deny the mighty
[2:57:58] minister of
[2:58:02] Philip who dare to deny the mighty
[2:58:05] ministries of
[2:58:11] Iranians Patrick the Patrick andoun
[2:58:14] andoun scores of
[2:58:17] others
[2:58:18] who have had God's anointing upon
[2:58:22] them yes the Bible
[2:58:26] Way is the real
[2:58:30] way of the open
[2:58:33] door and I want to add my testimony to
[2:58:37] that the reason I have to do
[2:58:40] that because I can always
[2:58:44] speak with
[2:58:47] assurance concerning what God has done
[2:58:49] in my own
[2:58:51] life so if you will excuse a person not
[2:58:56] here I will tell you how I know
[2:59:02] for that Jesus is the same yesterday
[2:59:05] today and
[2:59:08] forever and that the power of
[2:59:11] God is still
[2:59:14] available to those who will believe and
[2:59:17] receive
[2:59:20] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[2:59:22] and
[2:59:23] forever the power of
[2:59:26] God still
[2:59:28] available to those that will believe and
[2:59:33] receive and P
[2:59:36] 302 listen what he said he was preaching
[2:59:40] to the Muslims in South
[2:59:45] Africa South
[2:59:47] Africa
[2:59:48] I began to speak to
[2:59:50] her and to all those
[2:59:54] thousands through the
[2:59:56] interpreters I said is it not
[3:00:00] so that the
[3:00:02] missionaries have told you over
[3:00:05] Jesus who came to save
[3:00:07] you you should have seen the people look
[3:00:09] at each
[3:00:12] other when when I said
[3:00:15] that then when they had answered
[3:00:18] that that was
[3:00:20] correct I went on and said but did the
[3:00:24] missionaries to you out of this
[3:00:28] book and I I held my Bible up for them
[3:00:31] to
[3:00:33] see that this same
[3:00:35] Jesus was a mighty
[3:00:38] healer now listen get
[3:00:41] this did I read it to
[3:00:43] you out of this
[3:00:46] book and I held my Bible a LOF for them
[3:00:50] to
[3:00:53] see that this same
[3:00:56] Jesus was a mighty
[3:01:00] healer and that he would live in his
[3:01:06] people down Through the
[3:01:09] Ages until he came again to receive them
[3:01:13] unto
[3:01:16] himself
[3:01:18] did you get
[3:01:19] it it's telling them Jesus was a mighty
[3:01:24] healer and that he would live in his
[3:01:29] people down Through the
[3:01:34] Ages until he will come to receive them
[3:01:37] unto him
[3:01:39] say did they tell you that because of
[3:01:43] that same spirit in
[3:01:46] them that was Ines
[3:01:49] Jesus that they would be able to do
[3:01:51] Mighty
[3:01:53] works even as Jesus
[3:01:56] did did they tell
[3:01:59] you that you can be healed even as you
[3:02:02] can be
[3:02:05] saved how many of
[3:02:07] you would like to see the same
[3:02:10] Jesus come down Among
[3:02:14] Us and do the same
[3:02:16] things that he
[3:02:19] did when he was here on Earth long
[3:02:23] ago they all wanted
[3:02:27] that that is one thing they Sur agreed
[3:02:32] on and then P
[3:02:36] 303 it says now the
[3:02:39] muhammadans are descendants of
[3:02:42] Abraham they believe in one
[3:02:45] God but they they reject Jesus Jesus as
[3:02:48] the Son of
[3:02:50] God and instead they take Muhammad as
[3:02:53] his
[3:02:56] Prophet they say that Jesus never
[3:03:01] died and rose
[3:03:04] again they are taught that by their
[3:03:07] priest and they believe
[3:03:11] it but I
[3:03:13] said but Jesus did die and Rise
[3:03:16] Again
[3:03:18] he sent his Spirit back upon the
[3:03:24] church that
[3:03:26] spirit that was in
[3:03:28] him is the very same
[3:03:31] spirit in the church
[3:03:35] now and it
[3:03:38] can and will
[3:03:41] produce what Jesus
[3:03:46] produced
[3:03:50] so we are not lacking
[3:03:55] power but the
[3:03:57] problem
[3:03:59] fear is the greatest
[3:04:02] robber let me finish with this
[3:04:06] testimony one day I went to a certain
[3:04:10] Town certain in ugandauganda that is
[3:04:15] just one among the many
[3:04:21] testimonies because I've broken the
[3:04:23] barrier of
[3:04:30] fear and that
[3:04:32] town had many Witch
[3:04:40] Doctors I know which is in developed
[3:04:44] countries it's no longer something you
[3:04:47] you know
[3:04:48] [Music]
[3:04:52] about but in Africa they are
[3:04:58] everywhere and the the first two
[3:05:05] days those witches those witches ganged
[3:05:09] together against our
[3:05:14] meetings and they really brought down
[3:05:17] the power of
[3:05:21] Satan until we couldn't preach for two
[3:05:27] days dark clouds could just come from
[3:05:34] nowhere and the terrible powerful
[3:05:38] wind blow the dust until the whole place
[3:05:42] du
[3:05:46] up
[3:05:49] and then it was followed by
[3:05:54] heaving the first day it was like
[3:05:57] that and the second
[3:06:01] day and when the Lord revealed to us
[3:06:04] what was going
[3:06:06] on we took the
[3:06:09] promise Jesus said whatsoever you bind
[3:06:12] on
[3:06:14] Earth shall be bound in heaven
[3:06:17] whatsoever you lose on
[3:06:20] Earth lose in
[3:06:22] heaven we are not going to use that
[3:06:25] Authority at the mar
[3:06:31] supper Jesus said as the father sent
[3:06:36] me soend I
[3:06:39] you the Lord Jesus
[3:06:42] say works I
[3:06:44] do shall you do also
[3:06:49] Jesus was not playing with
[3:06:51] words he meant what he
[3:06:54] [Applause]
[3:06:58] said in Luke chapter
[3:07:01] 18 no Luke chapter
[3:07:05] 10 Jesus said I beheld
[3:07:09] Satan fall from Heaven
[3:07:12] as but
[3:07:14] behold I give you
[3:07:16] power trle over
[3:07:19] serpents and over pois
[3:07:22] scorpions and over all the powers of
[3:07:26] the nothing shall in any wise hurt
[3:07:32] you Jesus said these sign shall follow
[3:07:35] them that
[3:07:37] believe in my
[3:07:40] name shall cast out the
[3:07:44] devil adoption P one and P two
[3:07:49] brother said we are God's
[3:07:53] ambassadors and all
[3:07:56] Heaven is behind us all God's
[3:08:01] power is behind us all God's
[3:08:06] angels are behind us God
[3:08:11] himself is standing right behind
[3:08:14] us Jesus said this
[3:08:18] Rock I build my
[3:08:20] church of Hell shall not Prevail
[3:08:24] against those are our
[3:08:29] promises and we are not going to use
[3:08:31] them in
[3:08:34] heaven in heaven there will be no devil
[3:08:36] to
[3:08:37] bind in heaven there will be no devil to
[3:08:40] cast
[3:08:42] out in heaven there will be no Satan to
[3:08:46] fight there will be no sick people to
[3:08:50] heal we have to use them
[3:08:54] here so we went into
[3:08:58] prayer and
[3:09:01] intercession until God give us the
[3:09:05] victory until we f a breakthrough in the
[3:09:12] spirit and that
[3:09:15] day many people gathered
[3:09:19] because they saw what happened the two
[3:09:24] days they came to witness what is going
[3:09:27] to happen on the
[3:09:31] third little did they know we already
[3:09:35] had the
[3:09:39] victory so I took the
[3:09:42] Bible and stood on the
[3:09:45] pit in the open air
[3:09:51] and I
[3:09:53] said this
[3:09:56] Bible is either the truth or it is
[3:10:04] false
[3:10:06] god that the churches preach
[3:10:11] about and the preach
[3:10:16] about exist or he does not
[3:10:21] exist and today we want to
[3:10:26] see it's not my
[3:10:29] duty to prove that the Bible is God's
[3:10:33] word I was born in
[3:10:37] 1965 I found the Bible
[3:10:40] here I found the churches and the
[3:10:43] MOs I found them talking about God
[3:10:49] but if it is God's
[3:10:50] word it God's
[3:10:53] Duty God
[3:10:56] responsibility to come forth and
[3:10:58] manifest
[3:11:01] it God does
[3:11:03] exist God is
[3:11:06] alive it is his duty
[3:11:09] today to prove
[3:11:12] it and everybody was looking at
[3:11:16] me and then I
[3:11:18] said anybody that is Dea come
[3:11:24] forward and we began singing a
[3:11:28] song as those who were de were coming
[3:11:33] for 12 people came
[3:11:37] forth 12
[3:11:40] people 11 were deaf in one
[3:11:46] ear and one was deaf in both
[3:11:51] ears a girl of about 12 14 years
[3:11:57] old so she came with the
[3:12:00] mother and the mother stood behind
[3:12:06] her and I I started building their
[3:12:11] faith why do I use deaf
[3:12:16] people
[3:12:19] particular those who are in
[3:12:22] one I'm demonstrating to
[3:12:26] them Mark
[3:12:30] 9:23 all things are
[3:12:33] possible to them that
[3:12:38] believe that's why the angel told
[3:12:41] Brother take the gift of Divine Healing
[3:12:44] to the whole
[3:12:46] world
[3:12:49] but the
[3:12:50] healer is Jesus Christ and he's the same
[3:12:53] yesterday today
[3:12:55] forever but your duty your duty is to
[3:13:00] get the people to
[3:13:01] believe if you can get the people to
[3:13:05] believe no will stand before
[3:13:10] you because Mark
[3:13:13] 9:23 all things are possible to them
[3:13:16] that
[3:13:18] and then how does faith
[3:13:21] come Romans 10 verse
[3:13:24] 17 Faith comes by
[3:13:27] hearing and hearing the word of
[3:13:30] God that's why
[3:13:34] listen that's why in that message
[3:13:37] diseases and
[3:13:40] affliction brother took the
[3:13:43] pit he told the sick people
[3:13:48] give me your undivided
[3:13:51] attention because if you lose what if
[3:13:54] you lose what I'm going to
[3:13:56] say you have as well lost your
[3:14:01] healing give me your undivided
[3:14:04] attention because if you lose what I'm
[3:14:06] going to
[3:14:08] say you have as well lost your
[3:14:12] healing why because the faith comes by
[3:14:16] healing
[3:14:17] the word of
[3:14:19] God once the people get to the
[3:14:22] faith once the people get to the
[3:14:25] faith the people get to the
[3:14:27] Fai no sickness can
[3:14:31] stand no demon
[3:14:33] can because all things are
[3:14:36] possible to them that
[3:14:40] believe so now those
[3:14:44] people one ear could hear one ear was
[3:14:48] death so so with one here with one ear
[3:14:52] they heard the
[3:14:55] word because faith comes by
[3:14:58] hearing they got the faith and the faith
[3:15:01] opened the second
[3:15:05] ear and the other the other girl who was
[3:15:08] de in both
[3:15:11] ears the mother stood in the gap for
[3:15:15] her and when she heard about the
[3:15:20] promises how God Alone is the
[3:15:24] Healer and how that our healing is
[3:15:26] already finished work of
[3:15:30] car and she got the
[3:15:33] faith God to open the ears of her
[3:15:37] daughter the the second thing we
[3:15:40] did I told them to put their fingers in
[3:15:44] the DEA
[3:15:45] ear
[3:15:47] so these 11
[3:15:49] people because they were deaf in one
[3:15:52] ear they put the finger in the deaf
[3:15:56] ear but the other girl because she was
[3:15:58] not
[3:16:00] hearing the mother had the word and got
[3:16:05] the she was convinced my daughter is
[3:16:08] going to
[3:16:10] hear so the mother put both fingers in
[3:16:13] her
[3:16:15] ear
[3:16:17] brothers sisters sir don't lose what I'm
[3:16:22] bringing to
[3:16:27] you
[3:16:29] fear is the greatest
[3:16:31] robber of the
[3:16:33] blessings if we can master
[3:16:37] that Master that fear and cast it
[3:16:40] out and we take the
[3:16:44] pr we are going to begin to see a man
[3:16:51] so we called on the name of the
[3:16:55] Lord and at the end of the
[3:16:58] prayers I as them to check their
[3:17:04] ears our God is a big
[3:17:07] God it's not by our
[3:17:12] righteousness God is D bound to his
[3:17:15] word God is under obligation to his
[3:17:20] word under to his
[3:17:24] word is not your
[3:17:27] word in the message perfect
[3:17:32] Faith somebody asked
[3:17:35] him brother are you not
[3:17:38] afraid when you see the sick people
[3:17:41] everywhere
[3:17:43] before this was answer
[3:17:47] I'm not
[3:17:48] afraid because if I was
[3:17:52] afraid I would not walk into that
[3:17:57] door to get in the auditorium when where
[3:18:00] the sick people
[3:18:02] are number two if I was
[3:18:06] afraid I would have no business Behind
[3:18:09] The
[3:18:11] Bu number
[3:18:13] three the reason I'm not afraid
[3:18:17] because it is not my
[3:18:20] word God's word it's not my
[3:18:24] word God's
[3:18:27] word God isound to his
[3:18:31] word to fulfill it God is under
[3:18:35] obligation to his
[3:18:39] [Music]
