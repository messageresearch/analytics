[1:18:10] you know about Warrior but you ever look
[1:18:13] at what a warrior is you start to look
[1:18:15] up and check what a warrior is awaria is
[1:18:17] someone who is courageous and strong
[1:18:22] and fights for a Cause
[1:18:25] or goal
[1:18:27] not your personal grievances
[1:18:29] ain't no worry I think
[1:18:32] historically a warrior is someone who
[1:18:35] has extensive skill in Wolfie and combat
[1:18:39] foreign
[1:18:42] boots
[1:18:48] you know cleaning the weapon and stuff
[1:18:50] a warrior have to have experience
[1:18:53] so that's why when David stepped forward
[1:18:55] he said when I will see him about my
[1:18:58] sheep I'll beg him a lion king and an
[1:19:02] unconquered live with the lion and a
[1:19:04] deal with that Lion and the call that
[1:19:07] delivered me from that Lion and the god
[1:19:09] of the woman told me that from that bill
[1:19:10] he is one unable to deliver this Goliath
[1:19:13] into my hands because he had experience
[1:19:15] you see to have genuine Faith you have
[1:19:17] to have genuine experience okay the Lord
[1:19:20] has shout I'm not hearing you I'm not
[1:19:23] hearing you he'd come back here in the
[1:19:25] wood but you've got to get experience
[1:19:27] shout out experience I know them
[1:19:30] intellectual ministers don't like it but
[1:19:31] we shout to not experience we want to
[1:19:34] meet that Pillar of Fire we want to meet
[1:19:36] a praise God the same God that Moses met
[1:19:39] on that mountain you want to meet that
[1:19:42] same God
[1:19:44] change your life
[1:19:47] historically the warrior is someone who
[1:19:49] has extensive skin and Wolfie and come
[1:19:51] back often a soldier
[1:19:53] for a shoulder-like figure in modern
[1:19:55] terms the terms has come to refer to
[1:19:57] anyone who exhibits strengths and
[1:20:00] courage in a variety of situations not
[1:20:04] one situation a community service

[1:27:58] possess a strong sense of loyalty and
[1:28:00] Justice and strive to protect those who

[1:28:27] doesn't like to see that writing
[1:28:29] bitterness has come and Watchers come

[1:28:58] want to see themselves in the mirror so
[1:28:59] they say she he them the pastor and like
[1:29:02] how we say it and this and that and all
[1:29:04] kind of foolish excuses when you get rid
[1:29:06] of that God listen God every Moses dying
[1:29:10] he said Joshua no more than my servant
[1:29:12] is dead no death Joshua come and take
[1:29:14] them people over poor Joshua Joshua is
[1:29:16] that the terminal so when just to
[1:29:18] recognize the weight of responsibility
[1:29:20] that's gonna hit him he shall be
[1:29:23] shown
[1:29:25] foreign
[1:29:34] [Music]
[1:29:54] my servant Moses is dead now you take
[1:29:57] them people over I can see Joshua
[1:30:00] foreign
[1:30:10] they don't like when things break around
[1:30:11] them and God are we are cracking things
[1:30:13] around your Zone that you could step
[1:30:15] forward
[1:30:16] we are not ordinary people
[1:30:18] so when Joshua stepped forward so he
[1:30:20] said be strong a good courage no money
[1:30:24] sitting there to back him up no man
[1:30:26] shall be able to stand before the all
[1:30:27] the days of thy life as I wasn't a
[1:30:30] legend or is Joshua talking to you know
[1:30:32] as I will make Moses so I'll be with you
[1:30:34] oh I will not fail thee praise God every
[1:30:37] place you put your foot is yours so get
[1:30:40] moving brother or give the Lord a shout
[1:30:42] you are a warrior o glory to God you are
[1:30:45] a fighter God don't stand still and
[1:30:48] church after the service don't you stand
[1:30:50] still get to do something get to pray
[1:30:52] and get the past and get the seeking get
[1:30:54] the beatle get the witness and testify
[1:30:57] to somebody invite them to church
[1:30:58] invited the service do something about
[1:31:01] your life
[1:31:03] what don't Joshua
[1:31:06] then when those are the problem should
[1:31:09] be strong be courageous but isn't that
[1:31:11] she will be fine writing now this word
[1:31:13] here
[1:31:14] this word here don't go with your own
[1:31:16] humanistic Spirit don't forget you
[1:31:18] you're anointed
[1:31:20] no no no don't go with that put it here
[1:31:23] I want you to meditate on it day and
[1:31:25] night
[1:31:26] because I could come down in the channel
[1:31:27] of my word right down into your heart
[1:31:32] but if you're not on the woodwork I'll
[1:31:34] reveal to you
[1:31:35] that the sky is blue
[1:31:37] you do nearby for that you could look up
[1:31:39] and see that
[1:31:40] you're not even really blue
[1:31:42] anyhow
[1:31:45] so what Warriors possess a strong sense
[1:31:48] of loyalty Justice and try to protect
[1:31:50] those who cannot protect themselves
[1:31:52] and ask something to hear the trillion
[1:31:54] of a warrior is a process of optimizing
[1:31:57] physical mental and spiritual discipline
[1:32:00] I think a Japanese have what you call um
[1:32:03] forget the name
[1:32:05] Samurai
[1:32:06] Japanese how we call it Samurai they go
[1:32:08] to training damage is one man sword Army
[1:32:10] thing when you lose one Samurai you take
[1:32:13] another Village like that them fellas
[1:32:15] and I'm treating a certain way you just
[1:32:17] up and say I have to be a warrior this
[1:32:19] morning you know
[1:32:21] and you go that one hour and doing so
[1:32:24] you get killed
[1:32:26] your goose Coke up right
[1:32:28] they can't send you so that is why you
[1:32:31] come to get trained to follow
[1:32:33] instructions to take commands and some
[1:32:36] people don't want commands because
[1:32:38] they're getting their own revelation
[1:32:42] some people only say Amen because they
[1:32:44] come from the dream that last night
[1:32:46] and what God showed them
[1:32:50] they missed the program of God why God
[1:32:52] put somebody by the pulpit to bring
[1:32:54] truth
[1:32:55] because true they were going to free you
[1:32:56] so what so the process of optimizing
[1:33:00] physical mental spiritual discipline in
[1:33:02] order to achieve Peak Performance they
[1:33:04] can include physical training martial
[1:33:05] arts mental exercises and so on
[1:33:07] visualization the warrior mindset also
[1:33:09] stresses Inner Strength Focus self
[1:33:13] Mastery and courage
[1:33:16] that's how we pop up the self-mastery
[1:33:18] and what the Bible talk about Paul said
[1:33:20] he that have to go into the fight and
[1:33:22] battle must be a master over himself
[1:33:24] must be disciplined that is not
[1:33:27] discipline formed by legalism of the
[1:33:29] church that is self-discipline that is
[1:33:32] internal discipline and that is what you
[1:33:34] have to have with him so God kind of
[1:33:37] sent a Revival until he's got man and
[1:33:39] to take it we cannot have a Revival
[1:33:41] until we get God called men not man
[1:33:45] called man but God trained man here we
[1:33:48] go that's not trained up in the School
[1:33:50] of Theology and education but rugged men
[1:33:52] of Faith Rocket Man of Faith watch this
[1:33:56] that God has brought up in the school of
[1:33:57] his rocket training men who are not
[1:34:00] afraid to face the fire human
[1:34:05] you face the fire your friendly fire
[1:34:07] fire still coming
[1:34:09] you see if you understand it coming you
[1:34:11] had to deal with it you know so stop
[1:34:13] stop talking when you hear these kind of
[1:34:15] things say amen I want to be the kind of
[1:34:18] man I could face everybody had a fire
[1:34:20] you know it might be fire sickness it
[1:34:22] might be fire up disease it might be
[1:34:23] fire so I'm lost one they might be fired
[1:34:25] up this and fire that then like go and
[1:34:27] break your foot break your hand you
[1:34:28] don't know where you might end up
[1:34:33] suppose you get an accident your foot up
[1:34:35] in any Hospital type and some string on
[1:34:37] some things pumping yeah maybe alone
[1:34:38] like me
[1:34:42] and you understand why not me why not
[1:34:44] you who who is supposed to be
[1:34:46] remember the story a man talking nobody
[1:34:48] he finally tries too hard he crossed too
[1:34:50] heavy
[1:34:51] and he said God oh God get my light
[1:34:53] across
[1:34:54] and gosh well look look around the room
[1:34:56] and see watch one later
[1:34:58] and he looked wrong and you see some big
[1:35:00] cross and different side crosses and you
[1:35:01] see a small one and he said one that's
[1:35:03] why she better be when you're coming
[1:35:04] with it
[1:35:10] I like that you know let him look and
[1:35:12] pick across he went across pick a cross
[1:35:14] the one he come over here
[1:35:17] cross
[1:35:21] smallest cross and he complaining
[1:35:23] complaining we complaining about
[1:35:26] press you're not testing about yourself
[1:35:27] the Dynamics that come Jesus was led by
[1:35:30] the Holy Ghost Into the Wilderness to be
[1:35:32] tested by losing himself
[1:35:38] that they communed with you
[1:35:42] upon say oh my God
[1:35:46] did you get that
[1:35:49] when the Holy Ghost hit Jesus what did
[1:35:51] Holy Ghost do let him just say I am
[1:35:53] Jesus time for Instagram
[1:35:56] our opposing all looking that what Jesus
[1:35:59] do no the Holy Ghost let him
[1:36:02] Into the Wilderness nobody encourage him
[1:36:05] come on Jesus you can make it amen
[1:36:06] hallelujah
[1:36:08] is Jesus and the devil and he did
[1:36:10] something for us he
[1:36:13] 'd written
[1:36:16] Oh Glory to God he demonstrated you
[1:36:18] don't need to show the devil no power
[1:36:20] just slam him the word it is written you
[1:36:23] can't tell him it is written if you
[1:36:25] don't know what is written okay the Lord
[1:36:27] has shouted you got to meditate on the
[1:36:29] word day and night that you could know
[1:36:31] what is in that world you fight the
[1:36:33] Devil with the word you feed the Devil
[1:36:35] with the word you overcome the Devil by
[1:36:37] the word you can Victory by the word say
[1:36:40] it is the victory that overcomes the
[1:36:43] world
[1:36:43] foreign
[1:36:47] men who has come into the presence of
[1:36:49] God and knows his power and knows his
[1:36:52] omnipotence and knows his healing power
[1:36:54] some men are trained to know the Living
[1:36:55] God it's it's all right to treat them by
[1:36:58] the word but the letter kill it but the
[1:37:00] spirit give it life and before we can
[1:37:02] have this revival God has to call out
[1:37:04] and train men
[1:37:06] god-trained men to carry this message
[1:37:09] and they don't care what the opposition
[1:37:12] is they are willing to go in the fairy
[1:37:14] fullness in defeat or to the Lions then
[1:37:16] or wherever it may be they are ready to
[1:37:18] go because they have been in the
[1:37:19] presence of God and know that he is
[1:37:21] whether it is the victory or defeat they
[1:37:23] stand the same the kind of training God
[1:37:26] does star man oh God Joe wasn't afraid
[1:37:29] of of his test on trial he said I know
[1:37:31] my redeemer limited I know the last I

[1:40:17] yet in the midst of it all they know
[1:40:20] that Living God and keep their face
[1:40:22] forward oh my hallelujah praise God when
[1:40:27] people was called he said no watch them
[1:40:29] we need something we need what we need
[1:40:31] tonight is somebody else who knows what
[1:40:33] where they are at what we need tonight
[1:40:35] is men and women know their position in
[1:40:37] Jesus Christ he said when the devil make
[1:40:39] that big boss he said we still got
[1:40:40] goliance but we still have David's too
[1:40:42] he made a big post it fell on the ears
[1:40:44] of the wrong fellow a little old fellow
[1:40:47] walking around here he'd look up the
[1:40:48] Seas a man like that but he knew that he
[1:40:51] was elected by God so watch you can see
[1:40:54] from two sides not just David
[1:40:55] commandering you know but David had a
[1:40:57] Consciousness and awareness he was
[1:40:59] elected by God do you have that
[1:41:01] Consciousness are you aware listen
[1:41:04] before David David Goliath he knew God
[1:41:06] was with him
[1:41:09] [Music]
[1:41:11] and I saw you can remember even before
[1:41:13] you came to the Lord how God has been
[1:41:15] with you
[1:41:16] can over your life
[1:41:17] you know when your child Angels was
[1:41:19] working with you
[1:41:20] do you know you have an angel working
[1:41:22] with you to bring you into salvation to
[1:41:24] bring you into the way go protect from
[1:41:26] accidents from disaster from all kind of
[1:41:29] conditions God protected you that this
[1:41:31] message could get to you
[1:41:32] [Applause]
[1:41:34] that's why it's difficult to understand
[1:41:36] how people communication is dead it's
[1:41:39] difficult to understand how people come
[1:41:40] to church without the praise upon the
[1:41:41] heart but other praise upon their lips
[1:41:44] it's difficult to understand that
[1:41:46] [Applause]
[1:41:49] David was called by election he was
[1:41:52] elected called anointed and pleased
[1:41:59] elected by God
[1:42:01] called from sheephooden to be king
[1:42:04] anointed and possession in place and how
[1:42:06] God anoint David when he gets fed up
[1:42:08] with Saul
[1:42:10] and he tells Samuel he said forget Soul
[1:42:12] you know why I'm only for him so I
[1:42:13] finish with him pink slip let him go
[1:42:15] home
[1:42:16] he's fired still on his shoulder fired
[1:42:20] he said go on anoint one is under Jesse
[1:42:22] and when all them passed by he said but
[1:42:25] isn't there one more
[1:42:26] is he sent for David I ain't sitting
[1:42:29] down light come small guy
[1:42:31] yeah
[1:42:36] he just come and when he come the whole
[1:42:39] this is the one and amidst his brothers
[1:42:41] which were older than him
[1:42:46] supposed to have it that's my right
[1:42:50] you know is who he elected
[1:42:53] school years ordained
[1:42:55] take the honor oil and pour it on David
[1:42:57] right there anointed king
[1:42:59] now David can't be foolish and say Ice
[1:43:01] King no it will be thrown
[1:43:05] you have to understand the principles of
[1:43:07] things work yeah the anointing doesn't
[1:43:09] put you in the position immediately the
[1:43:12] anointed put the calling and the
[1:43:13] placement of where you're going to be so
[1:43:16] it is a destiny in the anointing that
[1:43:18] God put upon you
[1:43:19] Oh Glory to God but from where you are
[1:43:21] the way out the Gap is fire is tiles his
[1:43:24] Battle Is War I never studied the book
[1:43:27] of David you'd recognize praise this
[1:43:29] book of Samuel and so on you reckon how
[1:43:30] David fought his way to get to that
[1:43:32] throne even though he was anointed king
[1:43:34] David see Rel helion or relatan you know
[1:43:37] and he had some Mighty Warriors around

[1:46:51] so you mean placing is under truth
[1:46:53] Perfection yes because God is perfect
[1:46:55] and your father when you walk through
[1:46:57] Perfection so God was trying all the
[1:46:59] time to get the church into this
[1:47:00] position of being Joseph
[1:47:04] she said yeah you are you know where he
[1:47:06] was standing he was a man of Faith to
[1:47:08] murder David he believed God God was in
[1:47:11] him he knew he was anointed and you know
[1:47:13] the same thing you Christians if you if
[1:47:16] God hadn't elected you to be a Christian
[1:47:19] you would not be a Christian
[1:47:24] it is God's choice not yours
[1:47:27] because no man seeks God no man sees God
[1:47:30] at any time you haven't sought God but
[1:47:32] God sought you
[1:47:34] and you responded to his calling upon
[1:47:36] your life
[1:47:38] [Applause]
[1:47:40] so
[1:47:43] [Applause]
[1:47:46] you are one in a million
[1:47:48] Millions were lost when you were saved
[1:47:52] hallelujah praise God praise God praise
[1:47:55] God praise God hallelujah
[1:47:59] Glory
[1:48:00] so Joshua he was a lead he was in the
[1:48:03] wilderness isn't that right and Joshua
[1:48:05] was elected of God and when he crossed
[1:48:07] and Moses died then he was called of God
[1:48:11] God called him out and give him a vision
[1:48:14] now as I was with Moses I'll be with you
[1:48:16] no man shall be this time before the
[1:48:18] orders of your life be not dismayed need
[1:48:20] to be discouraged why does he have to
[1:48:22] say that
[1:48:23] why is that automatic well God tell me
[1:48:24] I'll take the lion
[1:48:26] no he's a human
[1:48:30] you have his own fears yeah you have his
[1:48:32] own challenges just like us this morning
[1:48:34] humans
[1:48:37] you have your doubts
[1:48:39] they have a question
[1:48:41] you have your fears
[1:48:42] and God is dealing with that with Joshua
[1:48:46] amen with words
[1:48:47] because the Devil comes with his
[1:48:48] thoughts you know he began torch to your
[1:48:50] mind to bring fears and doubts to
[1:48:52] question God promised to your life amen
[1:48:55] amen and especially when you know you
[1:48:56] feel and when you fail and you sin and
[1:48:58] whatever it is you play with it anymore
[1:49:00] you say God wouldn't bless you because
[1:49:01] you did this go and bless me because you
[1:49:03] did this you lie here you do this here
[1:49:04] whatever whatever
[1:49:05] that's his job he had to do that
[1:49:08] but Jesus stated all
[1:49:10] not some all
[1:49:11] all when he paid the price he paid the
[1:49:13] price he paid the full price because we
[1:49:15] couldn't get out if we tried so God
[1:49:16] himself took up expert make a mad body
[1:49:19] there for God Jesus and that was the
[1:49:21] body of the pillar of fire so the same
[1:49:23] Pillar of Fire that was even children of
[1:49:24] Israel get Flesh on it
[1:49:26] and the person of Jesus Christ and him
[1:49:29] was that book and him was our names so
[1:49:31] when he walked the Earth he had the full
[1:49:33] book was dear that's why you can say
[1:49:35] Peter come John come Philip come they
[1:49:38] had to come because the name was in him
[1:49:41] Oh Glory that God had to respond to the
[1:49:44] cause he said leave your Fisher fishing
[1:49:46] and I'll make you Fishers of Men Oh
[1:49:48] Glory to God and when God call you
[1:49:50] you've got to respond if you have
[1:49:52] something in you to respond if you don't
[1:49:55] have it you can't respond but if there's
[1:49:57] something in you you've got to respond
[1:49:58] oh that the father had past tense given
[1:50:01] me Will Come Oh Glory to God hallelujah
[1:50:04] praise God praise God praise God so he
[1:50:07] had to tell Joshua don't be discouraged
[1:50:09] told me this maid I won't break you
[1:50:12] where does whoever you go is
[1:50:14] see if you're not feeling then he's
[1:50:15] still there if you're not seeing him
[1:50:17] he's still there I know I love about God
[1:50:19] but I was trying to do it in my own life
[1:50:21] and just do try to do the hard thing for
[1:50:23] his hardest things first the rest
[1:50:24] becomes different
[1:50:26] and mentally we tend to try to do the
[1:50:28] easiest thing
[1:50:31] ah
[1:50:32] that's a big job
[1:50:34] but you see when you look up the big job
[1:50:35] all the other job just fall in line
[1:50:38] what's the first task that God gave
[1:50:40] Joshua Jericho
[1:50:42] all the hardest place to conquer were
[1:50:45] also high chairs riding on the wall that
[1:50:47] shops on the wall I've been that big
[1:50:49] cage closing and how you're taking that
[1:50:51] that was an offense teaching as a wall
[1:50:54] City you know and God said Jericho I'd
[1:50:56] give them into your hands I give the
[1:50:58] king all them people said the only
[1:50:59] Warriors I give them away to your hands
[1:51:02] oh Hallelujah let's continue here now
[1:51:04] and after the vision was over
[1:51:07] what happened Joshua shakuni showed a
[1:51:10] knight shot from his sword
[1:51:16] are you forced against us a man moving
[1:51:18] there he said no no I'm the captain
[1:51:21] in other words I am your boss
[1:51:23] I come to give you instructions how to
[1:51:25] take Jericho
[1:51:26] oh my the captain I like Joshua you know
[1:51:29] he wasn't playing games you know he
[1:51:31] wouldn't say you know I mean um yeah
[1:51:32] yeah yeah it was some juice your coffee
[1:51:35] you don't lose the enemy you know coffee
[1:51:37] draw sword first and if it's not all
[1:51:40] right then they put on your sword
[1:51:41] if you if you want to do entertainment
[1:51:43] industry
[1:51:47] Hallelujah
[1:51:49] Hallelujah no short first why you need
[1:51:53] land
[1:51:54] there's enemy in the land anybody want
[1:51:56] to kill you and keep you out of your
[1:51:58] land take away your joy take away your
[1:52:00] peace are you with me
[1:52:01] so then Joshua being the warrior
[1:52:03] elective children of God when he met
[1:52:05] this man standing near the wall of
[1:52:07] Jericho he was positionally pleased then
[1:52:12] when I talk about faithful Ministry
[1:52:13] being pleased and is the Minister of
[1:52:15] Jesus Christ I'm talking about the
[1:52:16] encounter with Michael the encounter
[1:52:18] with the angel the uncomfortable the
[1:52:20] Unseen captain man have to get an
[1:52:23] encounter not with a church overseas or
[1:52:26] some headquarters are encounter with the
[1:52:29] captain of the horse so when he get that
[1:52:31] encounter he become a warrior
[1:52:34] you get anointed to fight anointed to
[1:52:37] give instructions so that he could tell
[1:52:39] the people listen when I visit the show
[1:52:41] showed
[1:52:42] um
[1:52:43] shut your mouth you can't shout until
[1:52:46] they get to shout he said when I visit
[1:52:48] the show Daniel will shout follow
[1:52:49] instructions walk around Jericho once a
[1:52:52] day
[1:52:54] somebody feel to walk again
[1:52:56] trouble you have to follow instructions
[1:52:59] once a day the seven day seven times I
[1:53:01] want to build it and Shout to help I
[1:53:02] mean we wanna we know what happened when
[1:53:04] they shouted the walls come down
[1:53:06] all we have to do is obey God
[1:53:09] walls you think are walls God will bring
[1:53:12] them down if you come into obedience
[1:53:14] obedience is where the blessing lies and
[1:53:18] in this service God will speak to you
[1:53:20] and tell you what you need to do oh
[1:53:22] praise God Amen
[1:53:24] praise God one day while strolling
[1:53:25] around the Wilderness along Jordan of
[1:53:27] Jericho he said a man he said a man
[1:53:30] stood on his Jewish Soul just a man look
[1:53:32] like a man doesn't say but he said no
[1:53:34] watch he said I'm the captain of the
[1:53:36] host of The Lord of Israel the captain
[1:53:38] of the host who was this captain of the
[1:53:40] host Joshua reached down on loosen his
[1:53:42] shoes fell in his face before him and
[1:53:44] say what will the Lord have me to do
[1:53:46] so when Joshua recognized who it was he
[1:53:49] said what will the Lord have me to do he
[1:53:52] said God called man needs what God can
[1:53:54] what God called man needs is a holy
[1:53:57] spirit behind him to back him up you
[1:54:00] stand alone today we won't do it we
[1:54:02] stand as an organization we stand as a
[1:54:05] move we stand this that the other but
[1:54:07] God wants men to be individuals
[1:54:10] that is why God hate control by
[1:54:14] headquarters over churches
[1:54:21] bishop and this one over this one
[1:54:23] because when they have all these men
[1:54:24] lined up over it cuts off the Holy Ghost
[1:54:27] but what God wants is that whatever man
[1:54:30] it is five people in the church that man
[1:54:32] can hear from God
[1:54:33] not here from foreign hear from God
[1:54:35] that's why I have the sovereignty of the
[1:54:37] local church Oh Glory the God today no
[1:54:41] man in between there is the operation of
[1:54:43] the holy spirit all right let's continue
[1:54:45] he said we can have Gatherings across
[1:54:47] the country we can have great stadiums
[1:54:49] full of people we can have all that kind
[1:54:50] of things going on it will never help
[1:54:53] until God speaks individually
[1:54:56] to the human heart the only thing that
[1:54:59] could change man God have to speak to
[1:55:01] you may God speak to you today Daniel 11
[1:55:04] 32 said and such as the wickedly against
[1:55:06] the Covenant shall he corrupt by
[1:55:08] factories but the people that do know
[1:55:11] their God shall be strong
[1:55:13] and do exploits who the people that know
[1:55:18] their God shall be
[1:55:20] strong
[1:55:22] and the Bible said let the weak say
[1:55:25] I am strong did we read that
[1:55:28] oh my Hallelujah beat your plow shares
[1:55:31] into swords you're pulling hooks into
[1:55:33] Spears let the weak say
[1:55:37] I am strong when you say I am strong
[1:55:39] with your mouth God will send the
[1:55:40] strength to make you stronger Oh Glory
[1:55:43] to God let not weak say I am weak no let
[1:55:45] the weak say directly opposite I am
[1:55:48] strong and God drops strength behind you
[1:55:50] to back up your confession
[1:55:52] oh of strength isn't that right
[1:55:54] oh my Hallelujah glory to God
[1:55:58] So Daniel said the greeting in the last
[1:56:01] days when these things come to pass the
[1:56:02] great exploits will be the people then
[1:56:04] what the men of faith will do in that
[1:56:07] day when Daniel saw a vision of that he
[1:56:10] said though that they do wicked and
[1:56:13] shall do wicked in the last days and

[2:06:13] to do with her own thinking Isaac was a
[2:06:15] thinking from then on

[2:06:30] things and whatnot a church in order and
[2:06:31] Church in order to accept but we have to
[2:06:33] strike
[2:06:34] the power of God
[2:06:36] then he identified what it is the
[2:06:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost then he
[2:06:40] identify where it will be out of the
[2:06:42] nominational churches so he's not
[2:06:44] talking about them because
[2:06:45] he's not talking about that come on
[2:06:48] outside dear martial churches he said he
[2:06:50] watched he said when that baptism Holy
[2:06:52] Ghost is made real to people damn that

[2:07:09] some more
[2:07:10] are you enjoying the wood this morning
[2:07:13] if Russia accepted the Pentecostal
[2:07:15] blessing 75 years ago when the Holy
[2:07:17] Ghost fell in Russia they would not have
[2:07:18] been Communists today
[2:07:19] 75 years ago they had a great retirement
[2:07:22] in Russia God come among them they had
[2:07:25] revivals away in this Iberia what did
[2:07:28] they do they rejected it and today the
[2:07:30] country is gone the churches can have
[2:07:32] church only under permission they are
[2:07:34] doomed in the Judgment has gone off in
[2:07:37] this wild tangent of Communism solo to
[2:07:39] the devil
[2:07:41] so what happened the Holy Ghost fell in
[2:07:44] Russia they reject the Holy Ghost and
[2:07:46] get what's happened a communist Spirit
[2:07:48] demon fall upon them
[2:07:52] that's why Russia is as they are now
[2:07:55] a spirit is governed in Russia
[2:07:59] 50 years ago
[2:08:02] that come George
[2:08:03] George F Boswell Charles price Smith
[2:08:06] wiggle smooth those great warriors of
[2:08:09] the Fate 50 years ago offered England
[2:08:10] the Holy Ghost Revival what did they do
[2:08:12] they laugh at them put them in jail call
[2:08:15] them crazy thought they'd lost their
[2:08:17] minds the churches refused the people to
[2:08:18] come near them they heal the sick the
[2:08:20] castle Devils they've done great works
[2:08:21] and because the England as a nation
[2:08:23] rejected the gospel her sins is known
[2:08:25] throughout all the world their these are
[2:08:27] more apostate nation and all the world
[2:08:28] even in Roman France and England
[2:08:31] you say England Western Front and Rome
[2:08:33] and you know Roman terrible already in
[2:08:35] France of the Rockers
[2:08:39] England she's the mother of apostasy
[2:08:41] right where Finney and many of the
[2:08:42] equipment preach Charles Finney Wesley
[2:08:45] she turned it down
[2:08:48] 15 years
[2:08:51] great healing Revival continue on from

[2:09:02] Congressman offshore crippled for 66
[2:09:05] years they could not turn their faces it
[2:09:07] wasn't so it was right before them but
[2:09:09] they turned it down and tonight this
[2:09:11] nation top of America is doomed there's
[2:09:14] no hopefully at all she's crossed the
[2:09:16] line between German and mercy and right
[2:09:17] now it's a two ten thousand times
[2:09:21] she's rotten to the core her politics is
[2:09:23] rotten the morals of this nation is
[2:09:25] lower than anything I can think of and
[2:09:27] the religious system is written on any
[2:09:28] morals
[2:09:35] let me continue
[2:09:37] oh boy I'm breathing from the post I'm
[2:09:40] putting my teachers and this blew my
[2:09:42] mind I believe
[2:09:44] according to Revolution 1316 the bride
[2:09:46] will have to stop preaching for the
[2:09:48] Beast is demanding the mark in the hand
[2:09:51] or forehead if permission to preach is
[2:09:53] granted so there's a prophecy one day
[2:09:56] church will close down we can't we
[2:09:58] wouldn't be able to preach this gospel
[2:09:59] freely
[2:10:00] because a system will demand that we
[2:10:02] form join his Union and whatever it is
[2:10:04] right
[2:10:05] and they'll be forced to quit preaching
[2:10:07] then the lamb will come for his bride
[2:10:09] and judge the great harlot now remember
[2:10:12] here we go Moses was born
[2:10:15] for a certain work and he could not do
[2:10:18] that work until he had received the
[2:10:19] gifts which would enable him to do the
[2:10:22] work
[2:10:23] he had to go out in the desert and wait
[2:10:25] there until God's appointed time
[2:10:27] so in a certain sense it might appear
[2:10:29] when Moses ran out but in another sense
[2:10:32] it wasn't time
[2:10:36] so Moses got a 40-year break for it to
[2:10:39] make up the time which is God's
[2:10:42] appointed time
[2:10:43] so you may find God taking too long but
[2:10:45] there is an appointed time
[2:10:48] Hallelujah are you with me
[2:10:50] there has to be a certain fear on the
[2:10:51] throne and the people had to be crying
[2:10:54] for the bread of life before God could
[2:10:56] send him back this is true for our tea
[2:11:00] Moses I
[2:11:02] cry just
[2:11:06] no
[2:11:07] people had must be burdened enough
[2:11:10] to cry to God for deliverance
[2:11:12] and then you say I paid
[2:11:14] the cries of my people
[2:11:18] these message people they're too
[2:11:19] comfortable yeah
[2:11:20] they're too normal
[2:11:22] they're too ordinary some of them sung
[2:11:24] asleep and we're taking sleeping tablets
[2:11:27] the song I sleep
[2:11:30] goes to wake them up
[2:11:32] pick them up because something fits in
[2:11:34] the happier
[2:11:35] hallelujah what what do we have in our
[2:11:38] day I'll skip that
[2:11:40] [Applause]
[2:11:42] okay molecules are working Sciences
[2:11:44] until we have a generation of science
[2:11:46] Seekers they will support any sign even
[2:11:49] unscriptural ones Matthew 24 says in the
[2:11:51] last days two spirits will be so close
[2:11:53] together that only elected would sell
[2:11:55] them apart for they alone would not be
[2:11:57] deceived how can you tell the spirit
[2:12:01] apart question answer just give them the
[2:12:03] word test
[2:12:04] if they don't speak that word they are
[2:12:06] the evil one but the Lord show me and
[2:12:08] the Lord you know I'm seeing it so on no
[2:12:10] no what did the Bible say yeah
[2:12:12] see what as the evil one deceived the
[2:12:15] first two Brides he will try to receive
[2:12:17] the bride in his last day by trying to
[2:12:19] get her to hybridize herself to Creeds
[2:12:22] or just plainly children from the world
[2:12:24] to any sign of Sutra God here we go
[2:12:26] never play Signs ahead of the word
[2:12:29] signs follow the word he told Elijah
[2:12:32] told one big me a cake first isn't that
[2:12:34] right now this last day Messenger will
[2:12:36] appear in God's appointed time it is the
[2:12:38] end time now as all we know for Israel
[2:12:40] is in our homeland anytime now you will
[2:12:43] come according to Malachi and whenever
[2:12:44] you see him he'll be dedicated to the
[2:12:47] word he'll be Vindicated version 10 7 go
[2:12:50] with vindicate his ministry he will
[2:12:52] preach the truth as Elijah did for the
[2:12:54] Mount Zion
[2:12:55] many will misunderstand him not few
[2:13:00] many because they have been taught
[2:13:03] scripture in a certain way which they
[2:13:06] considered to
[2:13:07] when they come against that they will
[2:13:09] not believe even some true ministers
[2:13:12] will misunderstand the messenger because
[2:13:15] so much has been called God Truth by
[2:13:18] deceivers but this Prophet will come as
[2:13:21] a foreigner to the first coming cry
[2:13:23] Behold the Lamb of God to take away the
[2:13:24] sins of the world Behold the Lamb of God
[2:13:26] come into Glory he will do this for even
[2:13:28] John was the messenger of Truth to the
[2:13:31] elect so is this one the last Messenger
[2:13:34] to the elect and the word bride
[2:13:37] the elect and what the word born brand
[2:13:40] version 2 13 I know that works
[2:13:45] and where thou dwellers even where Satan
[2:13:47] sitters
[2:13:48] the whole is fast my name has not denied
[2:13:51] my faith even those days where in
[2:13:53] Antipas my faithful matter who was seen
[2:13:56] among you were Satan developed amen
[2:13:58] amen listen to this breakdown now yeah
[2:14:00] this is what I get to I Know Thy works
[2:14:02] these are the identical words uttered to
[2:14:05] each of the seven Messengers relative to
[2:14:07] the people of God in each age as they
[2:14:10] are spoken to the two Vines true and
[2:14:13] Falls they will bring joy and gladness
[2:14:15] to the hearts of one group and they
[2:14:18] ought to strike Terror in the hearts of
[2:14:19] the others for though we are saved by
[2:14:22] grace apart from Works true salvation
[2:14:24] will bring forth works
[2:14:27] or deeds that will please God
[2:14:31] First John 3 7 little children let the
[2:14:33] man deceive you either do it Wicked
[2:14:35] righteousness is righteous
[2:14:37] even as he is righteous
[2:14:39] if this verse means anything at all it
[2:14:41] means that what a man does he is foreign
[2:14:45] that's a big one
[2:14:48] what a man does he is James 311
[2:14:51] at the same place Sweet Water and bitter
[2:14:54] Romans 6 2 how shall we that our dead
[2:14:57] doesn't live any longer therein
[2:14:59] matut Pearl says 33-35 either make the
[2:15:02] tree good and his food good always make
[2:15:04] the tree corrupt and his food corrupt
[2:15:06] for the tree is known by its fruit
[2:15:08] he said what generation of Fighters how
[2:15:10] can you be an evil speak of things for
[2:15:12] out of the abundance of the heart
[2:15:13] the most speaks a good man out of the
[2:15:16] good Treasure of the heart bringing
[2:15:18] forth good things either man or an evil
[2:15:20] treasure being for evil things now if a
[2:15:22] man is born of the word being born again
[2:15:24] none of corruptible seed but of
[2:15:26] incorrupted by the word he will produce
[2:15:28] the word the fruit or works of his life
[2:15:32] will be the product of the kind of sea
[2:15:34] that is in him his Works therefore will
[2:15:36] be scriptural I Know Thy works
[2:15:39] the word of Truth was the Criterion then
[2:15:42] it is the criteria no there isn't
[2:15:45] another standard there isn't another
[2:15:47] Plum line I Know Thy Works he stood
[2:15:50] there with the word examining their
[2:15:51] lives in the light of the blueprint he
[2:15:53] has laid out for them he must have been
[2:15:55] pleased in the goodly measure for a day
[2:15:57] like others who have gone on before were
[2:15:59] enduring let me let's go the persecution
[2:16:01] of the unjust and still joyfully
[2:16:05] cleaving unto the Lord difficult though
[2:16:07] it was a time to save the Lord yet they
[2:16:09] serve him and worship him in spirit and
[2:16:12] in truth but the force Vine it was not
[2:16:15] so they repudiated
[2:16:17] the life
[2:16:19] that is built upon the word and we're
[2:16:22] now going further and further away from
[2:16:24] the truth the action for witness to the
[2:16:27] depths in which they are sunk now here
[2:16:30] we go
[2:16:31] Acts 3 16. when Peter was asked remember
[2:16:34] Peter said man walk right when Peter was
[2:16:38] asked how the mighty Miracle are taking
[2:16:40] place upon the one of the gate
[2:16:41] beautiful he explained it on this wise
[2:16:43] and his Jesus name
[2:16:46] true faith in his Jesus name had made
[2:16:49] this man form a crypto strong
[2:16:51] the faith which is by from him Jesus had
[2:16:55] given him the man this perfect songness
[2:16:58] in the presence of Your World
[2:17:00] there it is Jesus name
[2:17:03] Jesus fate brought the miracle Peter
[2:17:06] here we go there's a bum Peter did not
[2:17:09] claim it was his own human faith any
[2:17:11] more than he claimed it was his own name
[2:17:13] he said it was Jesus name used in the
[2:17:16] faith which is from Jesus perform that
[2:17:19] great work
[2:17:20] this faith is what the Lord was speaking
[2:17:23] about in Revelation 2 13 it was his feet
[2:17:26] it must not fit in him it was his own
[2:17:29] fate that he had given to the Believers
[2:17:33] [Applause]
[2:17:35] you see it
[2:17:36] it's not your faith is his fate that he
[2:17:39] gave to you oh glory to God his faith is
[2:17:43] going to be in you
[2:17:45] Hallelujah Romans 12 3
[2:17:48] according as God had dealt to every man
[2:17:50] according to the verse the men The
[2:17:53] Measure of Faith Ephesians 2 8 by grace
[2:17:55] are ye saved through faith and that
[2:17:57] faith is not ourselves it is the gift of
[2:17:59] God James 2 1 notice my brethren have
[2:18:03] not the Fate the fate of not in our lord
[2:18:06] Jesus but respect our persons says the
[2:18:08] fate of Jesus isn't right in the
[2:18:10] programian age where man was humanizing
[2:18:14] salvation
[2:18:15] haven't turned from the truth that
[2:18:18] salvation is of the Lord having
[2:18:20] classified adoption of election and
[2:18:22] opened the church wide door to their
[2:18:25] Fellowship to any and all who subscribe
[2:18:27] to their tenants never mind the word
[2:18:29] in this age of Rapid degration there
[2:18:32] were still the few who had the measure
[2:18:34] of that feet
[2:18:36] of our Lord Jesus Christ and not only
[2:18:39] use that faith and acts of power but
[2:18:41] which to those who dare to say that they
[2:18:44] will save simply on the grounds of
[2:18:46] joining the church
[2:18:47] so you were saying it was more than just
[2:18:49] an active Faith doing something one
[2:18:50] doesn't know but with stone what what
[2:18:52] we're standing them liars and deceivers
[2:18:54] and satanic workers was in the church
[2:18:57] these guys are Stitch members
[2:19:01] they knew that no man could truly
[2:19:03] believe until eternal life and
[2:19:04] righteousness of God apart from The
[2:19:05] Measure of Faith of the Lord Jesus
[2:19:07] Christ himself today church at his bomb
[2:19:10] is filled with mental believers
[2:19:14] that's not my word
[2:19:16] that this church is filled with mental
[2:19:18] believers who endorse the Virgin put the
[2:19:20] shed blood going to church taking
[2:19:22] communion and are not reborn at all so
[2:19:25] in that church it was the same problem
[2:19:27] human faith wasn't enough then it is not
[2:19:30] enough no it takes the very fate of the
[2:19:33] Son of God to drop into a man's heart so
[2:19:35] he can receive the Lord Of Glory into
[2:19:37] the temple not made to his hands
[2:19:40] Oh Glory the godson the human said care
[2:19:42] work then a coworked now oh praise God
[2:19:45] praise God this was a living faith
[2:19:49] I live by the faith of the Son of God
[2:19:51] that's what Paul said isn't that right
[2:19:52] Paul did not say he lived by faith in
[2:19:55] the Son of God it was the faith of the
[2:19:57] Son of God that was given him life and
[2:20:00] kept him living in Christian Victory Oh
[2:20:02] Glory to God give the Lord some praises
[2:20:04] foreign
[2:20:07] [Applause]
[2:20:15] and they were blessed by the Lord this
[2:20:18] is the part I want to get to I was
[2:20:19] accounted worthy for him
[2:20:21] we're Satan sitters are you ready
[2:20:24] the reason that this part of the eulogy
[2:20:27] of the spirit is because these brave
[2:20:30] soldiers are you ready
[2:20:32] these brave Soldiers of the Cross will
[2:20:35] overcome in Satan right in the midst of
[2:20:39] his own throne room
[2:20:42] they were winning the battles through
[2:20:45] the name and fate of Jesus Christ in the
[2:20:48] camp of the leaders of Darkness
[2:20:50] what a tremendous
[2:20:52] like the Mighty Men of David who invaded
[2:20:55] the camp of the enemy to bring David to
[2:20:57] his quenching water so these Giants are
[2:21:00] fate and Faded the Realms of Satan
[2:21:03] Earthly stronghold and by preaching an
[2:21:06] exhorting brought the water of Salvation
[2:21:08] to those who live under the shadow of
[2:21:10] death
[2:21:11] Oh Glory to God who is that Warriors of
[2:21:15] defeat
[2:21:16] and stronghold
[2:21:19] step on him oh glory to God heal he's
[2:21:22] not guarding you you are budding him

[2:21:25] give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah
[2:21:29] Hallelujah
[2:21:30] glory to God hallelujah as much as these
[2:21:34] words considering the throne and Realm
[2:21:35] Of Satan are part of God's praise for
[2:21:37] his elect
[2:21:38] they actually set the stage of the
[2:21:40] announcement of the evil that was
[2:21:42] against Supremacy in the church

[2:21:46] brand I'm in a measurable contest he
