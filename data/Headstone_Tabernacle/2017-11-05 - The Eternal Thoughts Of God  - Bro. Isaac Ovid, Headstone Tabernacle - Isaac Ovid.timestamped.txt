[54:45] Romans 12 and reading verse 2
[54:53] and bina conformed to this world but be
[54:57] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[55:00] that you may prove what is that good and
[55:03] acceptable and perfect will of God and
[55:08] our last reading from the book of
[55:10] Philippians chapter 2 and reading from
[55:15] verse 5 let this mind be in you which
[55:20] was also in Christ Jesus who being in
[55:24] the form of God thought it not robbery
[55:26] to be equal with God but made himself of
[55:30] no reputation and took upon him the form
[55:32] of a servant and was made in the
[55:35] likeness of men and being found in
[55:38] fashion as a man he humbled himself and
[55:40] became obedient unto death even the
[55:43] death of the cross
[55:45] wherefore God also had highly exalted
[55:48] him and given him a name which is above
[55:50] every other name that at the name of
[55:52] Jesus every knee should bow of things in
[55:55] heaven and the things in the earth and
[55:57] things under the earth and that every
[55:59] tongue should confess that Jesus Christ
[56:01] is Lord to the glory of God the Father
[56:03] wherefore my beloved as he have always
[56:07] obeyed not as in my presence only but
[56:10] now much more in my absence work out
[56:13] your own salvation with fear and
[56:17] trembling for it is God which worketh in
[56:20] you both to will and to do of his good
[56:23] pleasure do all things without
[56:25] murmurings and disputing that he may be
[56:28] blameless and harmless the sons of God
[56:31] without rebuke in the midst of a crooked
[56:34] and perverse nation among whom II shine
[56:38] as lights in the world holding forth the
[56:41] word of life that I may rejoice in the
[56:43] day of Christ that I have not run in
[56:45] vain neither labored in vain
[56:47] yay and if I be offered upon the
[56:50] sacrifice and service of your feet I joy
[56:53] and rejoice with you all for the same
[56:56] cause also do a joy and rejoice with me
[56:59] may the Lord and a blessing to the
[57:01] reading of his
[57:03] a man can we give the Lord a hand
[57:06] appraised you may be seated this morning
[57:09] [Applause]
[57:14] so I have a title this morning the
[57:17] eternal thoughts of God and for a
[57:21] subject the mind of Christ and as an
[57:25] inspiration thinking his thoughts
[57:29] thinking his thoughts and but randomly
[57:33] spoke many times about a word is a
[57:36] thought expressed so in order for a word
[57:40] to be spoken it first had to exist as a
[57:43] thought for you to act a certain way
[57:47] your body responds to instructions its
[57:50] comforts as a thought what exists today
[57:54] at one time before it existed in the
[57:57] material form whatever existed as a
[58:00] thought the tallest building in the
[58:02] world before it was built and before the
[58:05] raw materials were gathered and before
[58:07] there was a drawing that went to
[58:09] approval it meant somebody would have
[58:11] had a thought in their mind of what they
[58:15] wanted to see there can the church say
[58:19] man before this pulpit could have been
[58:21] built somebody had to have a thought of
[58:24] what this pulpit would look like unless
[58:27] it was a thought it could never come
[58:29] into material and unless what you say
[58:32] was a thought you could have never had
[58:34] it in the first place can the church say
[58:36] man are you with me this morning so
[58:39] we're trying to get some we're trying to
[58:40] lay a foundation this morning so the
[58:43] biggest building in the world
[58:45] everything that's created the cars we
[58:47] drive today
[58:48] the cell phones we have in our hands it
[58:51] existed as a heart before it became a
[58:54] reality
[58:55] somebody had a thought a vision I've
[58:57] seen a possibility and we could pick up
[59:00] something and call somebody with it and
[59:02] it was a thought before it became word
[59:04] let's make a plan before it became
[59:06] action
[59:08] and that principle is a principle that
[59:10] actually comes from God because we are
[59:13] created in the image of God that seemed
[59:16] formula what sauce just as it works for
[59:19] God can the church see man so I asked
[59:24] you a question this morning if man can
[59:27] have a thought and that thought could be
[59:29] I want to build this so I want to make a
[59:31] dresser and it's enough for to have a
[59:34] vision to address I want to make or
[59:36] whatever whatever you see around us
[59:38] that's in the natural is the product of
[59:40] man's thinking everybody with me it is
[59:45] the product of man's thinking but when
[59:47] you look at the trees and you look at
[59:49] the Stars and you look at the mountains
[59:52] and you look at the way the Stars and
[59:55] the mountains work together
[59:56] what kind of mind would it take if
[1:00:04] natural manner to create inventions now
[1:00:08] they have you may be seated now they
[1:00:10] have those those things those cameras
[1:00:12] that float in the air with what he
[1:00:14] called lived rooms man could have a
[1:00:16] vision somebody thought about it one day
[1:00:19] I wanna put a camera in something I went
[1:00:20] over and I saw the latest one you can
[1:00:23] put your hands in front of it and when
[1:00:24] you do this it moves around that's man's
[1:00:26] creativity and that person of man
[1:00:29] thoughts so what kind of mind would it
[1:00:32] take to be able to put man the way he is
[1:00:36] what kind of mind would it take to know
[1:00:39] when the Sun should go up and when the
[1:00:42] Sun should come down what kind of mind
[1:00:45] would it take to know when the moon has
[1:00:47] to do what it has to do what kind of man
[1:00:50] would it take
[1:00:53] and the church Sam and amber the Panem
[1:00:56] said that you cannot even be here unless
[1:00:59] you existed in the thoughts of God
[1:01:01] because you are a very expression of the
[1:01:05] thoughts of God God existed but the
[1:01:08] Branham said before he could even be
[1:01:10] called God he was all thoughts he was
[1:01:13] just a bunch of thoughts and in those
[1:01:15] thoughts were the Branham said the world
[1:01:18] is an attribute of his Porter because
[1:01:21] before the world existed he was thinking
[1:01:24] about it before the Sun existed he was
[1:01:27] thinking about it up before the moon
[1:01:29] existed he was thinking about it before
[1:01:32] the posix he said he was thinking about
[1:01:35] it before the elephant existed he was
[1:01:38] thinking about it before the horses
[1:01:40] existed he was thinking about it before
[1:01:43] this country existed he was thinking
[1:01:46] about it before you existed he was
[1:01:49] thinking about you because he thought
[1:01:52] about you you are the expression of his
[1:01:55] thoughts
[1:01:59] hallelujah oh my you may be seen it
[1:02:04] I wonder Stovall back before there was a
[1:02:07] moon and go back before there was a star
[1:02:09] called back before there was a bill go
[1:02:12] back before there was a problem let's go
[1:02:15] back before there was a mortgage let's
[1:02:17] go back before they were sickness let's
[1:02:19] go back before there was tiredness
[1:02:21] because everything have to exist as a
[1:02:26] boat before it can be expressed
[1:02:29] [Applause]
[1:02:31] you didn't see that so before the devil
[1:02:35] could touch you or it never can accuse
[1:02:37] you he has to understand the original
[1:02:40] thought and that is what the devil
[1:02:43] cannot understand because he cannot tap
[1:02:45] into the mind of Christ
[1:02:47] access to the mind of God is reserved a
[1:02:50] select few only a select few good access
[1:02:55] the mind of God God's - so fast he can't
[1:03:00] open that mind to any and anybody
[1:03:01] because everybody can't handle it
[1:03:04] but when God opens his mind up and
[1:03:06] begins to express his thoughts so that
[1:03:10] is anybody in the house morning he may
[1:03:15] be seated for a minute
[1:03:16] in order for a prophet to speak he has
[1:03:21] to have the mind of God because at any
[1:03:24] other way it will be his own thoughts
[1:03:26] let me say that again in order for a
[1:03:29] prophet to speak he must have access to
[1:03:33] the mind of God to the intelligence of
[1:03:36] God and the other way it will mediate is
[1:03:39] his thoughts being spoken so when a
[1:03:41] prophet speaks who is doing the thinking
[1:03:48] because if Isaiah was using his thinking
[1:03:52] he could never see a pleasure shall
[1:03:54] conceive because the mind of man and not
[1:03:58] figure that out oh come on somebody
[1:04:00] reach back to me and when our prophet is
[1:04:04] gonna be a bride we're gonna act like
[1:04:16] they were gonna make him but something
[1:04:19] has kept you something holds you Oh
[1:04:23] somebody beats back to me this sorts the
[1:04:36] expression of his thoughts God existed
[1:04:39] not even called God because by
[1:04:42] definition God means objects of worship
[1:04:45] but there was nobody to worship him but
[1:04:47] the kindly all he was was thoughts he
[1:04:51] thought about nature he thought about
[1:04:53] animal life he thought about hand lights
[1:04:56] he thought about a family and I belong
[1:04:59] to have a family he thought about his
[1:05:01] own legacy he thought about Rep reducing
[1:05:04] himself he thought about of people
[1:05:06] smiling he's other people victorious he
[1:05:10] thought about everything he thought
[1:05:12] about how ungrateful his people would be
[1:05:14] it I didn't have a mountain and a valley
[1:05:16] to understand the difference between the
[1:05:19] mountains and the valleys he ran it
[1:05:21] through his mind and he thought about
[1:05:23] all the possibilities up and he knew
[1:05:25] bless you too much you might forget
[1:05:27] about him
[1:05:28] so he wants to bless you just enough
[1:05:30] mercy he thought about it he thought
[1:05:34] about the wife you would have an
[1:05:37] undetermined you would have a
[1:05:39] and if you will give you children he
[1:05:41] thought about it all because he was
[1:05:43] thinking he was just existing with his
[1:05:45] suck
[1:05:46] and when he was done he said it is good
[1:05:48] you never seen it how could you say that
[1:05:56] brother let me read a quote from you
[1:05:58] from the exposition of the church it is
[1:06:01] the Smyrna churches everybody awake this
[1:06:03] morning everybody here this morning but
[1:06:06] Abraham said the eternal thoughts of God
[1:06:08] let me ask you are the thoughts of God
[1:06:10] you know he said if you can see this you
[1:06:14] will see many things God is unchangeable
[1:06:18] in both SS and behavior we have studied
[1:06:23] that and proven that already God is
[1:06:25] infinite in his abilities so therefore
[1:06:28] he as God must be omniscient and if he
[1:06:32] is omniscient listen to the Prophet then
[1:06:35] he is not no learning so God is not now
[1:06:41] learning nor is he at any time adding to
[1:06:46] his knowledge
[1:06:49] so God already knows everything about
[1:06:52] you what you go into is not new
[1:06:55] information because he cannot add to his
[1:06:58] knowledge is not learning so your
[1:07:02] mistakes your failures he already saw
[1:07:05] all of that and still wrote your name in
[1:07:07] blood still wrote it still wrote that
[1:07:17] devil you can 'take my limit he is
[1:07:20] omniscient he is omnipresent he is
[1:07:24] all-powerful yes
[1:07:31] you may be seated this should shake some
[1:07:34] money I don't care if you've been back
[1:07:36] sleeping for 30 years
[1:07:37] what is it the first time you're ever in
[1:07:39] church God is not adding to his
[1:07:41] knowledge nor is he now learning listen
[1:07:44] to the Prophet nor listen is he taking
[1:07:49] counsel even with himself
[1:07:54] that's the prophets work so when the
[1:07:57] Catholic God is not taking counsel by
[1:07:59] the man himself even with himself
[1:08:00] you know what counsel with yourself is a
[1:08:02] one day for doing the right thing that's
[1:08:06] coming so with yourself that's when
[1:08:08] you're second-guessing yourself I wonder
[1:08:10] if I Heidi right bread I wonder if
[1:08:13] that's what you really want to make that
[1:08:15] is console with yourself and then you
[1:08:17] have to answer back answer because
[1:08:18] nobody else is there yeah I feel this is
[1:08:21] your right one you know in some circles
[1:08:25] they defined others we'll leave that
[1:08:27] alone
[1:08:29] but with the practice that God has not
[1:08:31] even taken counsel with his own self you
[1:08:34] know I was he is so positively confident
[1:08:37] that he made the right decision
[1:08:39] there is no turning back the Holy Ghost
[1:08:42] released in your destination there is no
[1:08:46] turning somebody happened we just
[1:08:51] morning
[1:08:57] maybe see it for a minute but the pranam
[1:09:00] said if that's what I said
[1:09:02] there is no surprise to God there's no
[1:09:05] oops hey I didn't see that coming
[1:09:07] that doesn't exist he's omniscient
[1:09:09] listen to the prophet
[1:09:11] that's a the people don't know the
[1:09:12] messenger if listening a prophet if he
[1:09:15] can add to his knowledge then he is not
[1:09:17] omniscient the best we could say is that
[1:09:20] sometime he will be but that is not
[1:09:23] scriptural he is omniscient he has never
[1:09:27] had a new thought about anything because
[1:09:30] all his thoughts he always had and
[1:09:33] always will have and knows the end from
[1:09:37] the beginning because He is God
[1:09:39] that's the thoughts of God are eternal
[1:09:43] this is the property are real they are
[1:09:45] not simply like a man with a blueprint
[1:09:48] he has drawn which one name will be
[1:09:50] translated into substance and form but
[1:09:53] they are already real so a few minutes
[1:09:59] ago we spoke about the man with a vision
[1:10:01] or the thought of obscure scraper it's
[1:10:04] in his mind and support and that thought
[1:10:06] has to be expressed but the Prophet said
[1:10:09] the eternal thoughts of God are so
[1:10:11] powerful what is in his mind is as if it
[1:10:13] is already expressed it doesn't have to
[1:10:16] be built-in or you don't hear me this
[1:10:18] morning so in his mind you have the holy
[1:10:21] cause in his mind you are adopted in his
[1:10:24] mind she protected in his mind you are
[1:10:27] more than a conqueror
[1:10:29] because his thoughts are eternal the
[1:10:32] devil cannot stop it
[1:10:34] [Applause]
[1:10:43] I'm not gonna be too long with you this
[1:10:45] morning we have two services today and
[1:10:47] the pastor will speak tonight I mean I
[1:10:48] just brought you a little bit probe you
[1:10:53] a little bit everything we do is a
[1:10:58] product of our thinking the time we wake
[1:11:02] up in the morning is a product of our
[1:11:04] thinking what we eat is the product of
[1:11:07] our thinking how we feel is the product
[1:11:10] of our thinking when you say I feel the
[1:11:13] press is an expression of the thought
[1:11:16] that already exists so even if you
[1:11:18] express it or not the fact that the
[1:11:20] thought exists already defines how you
[1:11:22] feel in the morning
[1:11:23] Subic you're already thinking it know
[1:11:27] one of the purposes as a man thinketh in
[1:11:29] his heart so if you wanna change your
[1:11:35] words you must change your thinking if
[1:11:40] you wanna change your behavior you must
[1:11:42] change your thinking that's why I read
[1:11:45] the scripture be transformed by the
[1:11:48] renewing of your mind
[1:11:50] [Applause]
[1:11:54] they say the mine is a terrible thing to
[1:11:57] waste
[1:11:57] they said it to school it is also true
[1:12:00] in the spiritual because if you shall
[1:12:02] fear this mountain it must exist in your
[1:12:06] thoughts before you can speak so before
[1:12:10] they can be spoken word it has to come
[1:12:14] back to the mind of Christ to know what
[1:12:17] you once done with the word or you don't
[1:12:20] hear me this morning are we in the
[1:12:23] message
[1:12:23] [Applause]
[1:12:30] so the spoken word is the original seed
[1:12:33] where the kangaroo but the genetic
[1:12:36] structure of that original seed is the
[1:12:38] thought of God because the thing is once
[1:12:47] the word is expressed for this even
[1:12:49] there's nothing to take it back if the
[1:12:56] thought means it's inactive but once the
[1:12:59] thought becomes expressed my words
[1:13:02] cannot return void but if it has a
[1:13:05] purpose it has a destination as an
[1:13:08] objective it has a timing so that's why
[1:13:13] the devil doesn't want you to speak he
[1:13:15] doesn't want you to worship he doesn't
[1:13:17] want you to show because what are you
[1:13:19] doing you are actually exercising the
[1:13:20] muscles that you have to use in the
[1:13:22] future to command the elements and
[1:13:25] command your situation whatever the
[1:13:28] random said if you right now we lay
[1:13:29] hands on the sick it was not so from the
[1:13:32] beginning when that time comes you a
[1:13:34] commanded Apple because we have to be
[1:13:37] able to sleep
[1:13:39] [Applause]
[1:13:42] you've ever seen it wasn't a prophecy
[1:13:44] they will have thus saith the Lord or
[1:13:47] they will keep still
[1:13:49] in other words their thinking will no
[1:13:51] longer exist to direct them they will
[1:13:55] only do his will
[1:13:56] Oh what type of thinking is that you may
[1:14:00] be seated
[1:14:00] but in the Bible say the Apostles taught
[1:14:03] nor thought of what they were going to
[1:14:05] save but if a word is a thought express
[1:14:07] who is thinking if the Apostles were not
[1:14:12] thinking and they were speaking it meant
[1:14:14] a higher intelligence than their
[1:14:17] intelligence it means a higher mind that
[1:14:20] their mind what kind of mind could
[1:14:22] discern the thoughts and intents of the
[1:14:24] heart that was that the mind of the
[1:14:26] Prophet that was the mind of Christ that
[1:14:29] was the son of man really is son of man
[1:14:32] oh can the church
[1:14:34] [Applause]
[1:14:39] and so many times the conflicts exists
[1:14:44] and that scripture have me read I just
[1:14:48] want to touch it and then come back to
[1:14:49] it where we read seeking the Lord while
[1:14:53] he may be found
[1:14:54] have it written my notes here but seem
[1:14:56] to have lost my place but that scripture
[1:15:00] is not a scripted to create a divide for
[1:15:05] my thoughts are higher than your
[1:15:06] thoughts my ways higher than your ways
[1:15:08] that scripture is a statement of fact
[1:15:13] that is a gap because the scripture will
[1:15:17] read if the minor was in Christ being
[1:15:19] you so in other words we exist right now
[1:15:22] where his thoughts are higher than our
[1:15:24] thoughts and his ways I had but what
[1:15:26] happens in his mind becomes your mind
[1:15:29] what happens when his ways become your
[1:15:32] ways what happens when you are thinking
[1:15:35] that's what thinking is can read a quote
[1:15:39] from the prophets hallelujah my mind
[1:15:46] this is when the Holy Ghost is driving I
[1:15:50] have the notes but he has just
[1:15:51] restructured our message the world the
[1:15:57] world becoming flesh but the banner said
[1:15:59] but if it becomes a real revelation of
[1:16:02] God that you see it before it happened
[1:16:04] and express it in a Word form that word
[1:16:07] takes a wall and becomes material of
[1:16:10] what express your heart and your mind is
[1:16:14] so filled with God's Spirit until your
[1:16:18] thoughts become his thoughts he says
[1:16:21] there you are when your mind and your
[1:16:23] leaning and your guiding becomes a
[1:16:26] direct lease or a direct inspiration of
[1:16:30] the Holy Spirit that's moving your motor
[1:16:32] being he goes further what kind of
[1:16:35] people should we be if the very Holy
[1:16:38] Spirit has you saw embody or empowered
[1:16:42] listen that you don't use your own
[1:16:44] thoughts
[1:16:46] you don't use your own mind you don't
[1:16:48] use your own opinions but the Holy
[1:16:51] Spirit has you so built until your
[1:16:54] thoughts and your P is God's Spirit
[1:16:57] expressing yourself through you what
[1:17:00] kind of church what we eat what kind of
[1:17:03] people would it be this morning and by
[1:17:08] the Panama streaming out he said if this
[1:17:11] Branum tabernacle and I see this morning
[1:17:13] if this headstone tabernacle this
[1:17:16] morning was so filled with the presence
[1:17:19] of God why when he didn't even use your
[1:17:21] own mind didn't even use your own
[1:17:24] thoughts didn't have no ultimately of
[1:17:27] your own but just to be led by listen
[1:17:35] the Prophet goes on and then our sons of
[1:17:40] God are led by the Spirit of God then
[1:17:43] when the human element goes out that's
[1:17:45] what we have been missing for all these
[1:17:47] years the human element has been too
[1:17:50] evident people listening and a message
[1:17:54] and this human element I don't think I
[1:17:56] don't think it should be like that I
[1:17:57] don't feel listen even even the
[1:18:00] scripture believers how this has nothing
[1:18:02] to with your feelings but to believe
[1:18:04] that belief itself is a product of a
[1:18:07] Vicki
[1:18:08] [Applause]
[1:18:12] so your mind has to change because even
[1:18:18] when the brand Umbridge approach the god
[1:18:20] approach the god is about your thinking
[1:18:24] that's why the Prophet said the right
[1:18:26] mental attitude oh you know ya me this
[1:18:30] morning towards any divine promise of
[1:18:32] God it's what brings it to pass
[1:18:35] it doesn't change here is what she's
[1:18:37] nowhere
[1:18:38] I wanna go on I that I wanna go on a dad
[1:18:41] I wanna go on a dad you might have
[1:18:42] change it is a song but when your mind
[1:18:49] is made up that woman with the issue of
[1:18:52] blood she didn't have the Holy Ghost but
[1:18:54] her mind was made up
[1:18:56] if I could just touch the hem of His
[1:18:59] garment
[1:19:00] nobody was changing of mind and when you
[1:19:05] reach a spot in your Christian journey
[1:19:07] there nobody to change your mind about
[1:19:11] the issue then the devil is finished
[1:19:15] [Applause]
[1:19:16] howdy panda branham's ticket he's then
[1:19:18] fully persuaded before they convince he
[1:19:23] may receive it so the word comes to you
[1:19:25] and the word strengthens your mental
[1:19:30] feet on the first level the first level
[1:19:33] of feet and even within mental feet but
[1:19:36] the random call it didn't see fit so
[1:19:37] even feed has a spectrum did you feed by
[1:19:41] the banner causing the lowest form of it
[1:19:42] you see it based on just your logical
[1:19:45] reasoning like the lepers if we sit here
[1:19:48] we die if we call there we might die
[1:19:51] might some better than dices better I'll
[1:19:53] call lowest level of it for some of us
[1:20:03] that might be just what we need right
[1:20:04] now if I stay in my situation at a time
[1:20:07] but if I worship maybe there's a
[1:20:11] possibility listen Albert Einstein the
[1:20:18] Prophet referred to him over 30 times in
[1:20:20] preaching Albert and they said if you
[1:20:22] try to approach the same problem with
[1:20:24] the same thinking you have the same
[1:20:25] result so if you have been walking this
[1:20:30] Christian journey and you have expired
[1:20:33] or results meaning you have a retina
[1:20:35] button all the results as you cut the
[1:20:36] swath to get more it needs a higher
[1:20:38] level of thinking
[1:20:40] because what is expressed by your life
[1:20:43] is defined by your thinking let me give
[1:20:47] you a natural example you may be seated
[1:20:48] if you are a strong Mason and you only
[1:20:55] know how to put the concrete to build a
[1:20:58] straight wall that's all you know that's
[1:21:00] your thinking
[1:21:01] there is nothing anybody can tell you
[1:21:03] about turning a corner because you are
[1:21:06] limited by your thinking you are limited
[1:21:09] by your knowledge in order of you to
[1:21:11] tell in a corner or even the curved wall
[1:21:14] it takes a higher level of thinking it
[1:21:17] may be training it may be going to
[1:21:19] school it may be an apprenticeship and
[1:21:21] maybe somebody have to show you what it
[1:21:23] is but until your thinking changes you
[1:21:26] can start at me and say okay it's not it
[1:21:29] is not you could speak what you want to
[1:21:30] speak turn curve Bend until your
[1:21:37] thinking could appreciate what is
[1:21:39] required knowledge could speak now you
[1:21:42] can act now you could do so when you
[1:21:45] come to church and what is the Bible
[1:21:48] what is the Bible the Bible is the
[1:21:50] expression of God's thoughts as we walk
[1:21:55] in this journey what we are trying to do
[1:21:57] is replace our thinking when he is
[1:21:59] thinking and he has already expressed
[1:22:02] how he feels about everything
[1:22:06] read the Bible how God feels and things
[1:22:11] about everything is expressed in
[1:22:13] children obey appearance this look that
[1:22:16] is this that's God's thoughts on the
[1:22:17] matter
[1:22:19] honor your father and mother that's
[1:22:21] God's thoughts on the matter
[1:22:24] if you can't live that it's not his
[1:22:26] thinking needs to change it it's it's
[1:22:28] your thinking that needs to change
[1:22:30] husbands love your wives that's that's
[1:22:33] God's thoughts on the matter wives
[1:22:36] reverence your husband that's good
[1:22:38] thoughts on the matter that's what the
[1:22:42] Bible is is the expression of God's
[1:22:45] thoughts on every matter can the church
[1:22:48] save the church let's continue reading
[1:22:55] and there are sons of God are led by the
[1:22:57] Spirit of God and when the human element
[1:22:59] goes out and the Spirit of God fills
[1:23:02] that vacancy where you empty yourself
[1:23:05] then will be when the church in its
[1:23:08] power of the resurrection of the Lord
[1:23:10] Jesus will walk in his steps in his
[1:23:12] power in his thoughts in his being in
[1:23:15] his moving then your thoughts will
[1:23:18] become words and the words will become a
[1:23:19] - yo that's when the church in its power
[1:23:23] and I believe it's on the road that's
[1:23:25] when the trip will be so wrapped in
[1:23:27] Christ the Holy Spirit mankind saw away
[1:23:30] from their self that they don't see
[1:23:33] themselves they don't have no but to
[1:23:35] serve God and therefore move on they
[1:23:37] refuse the things of the world they just
[1:23:39] move in the spirit live in the spirit
[1:23:42] move in the spirit walk in the spirit so
[1:23:45] fulfill the law of Christ then the love
[1:23:48] of Christ in the human heart moving in
[1:23:51] the Holy Ghost that great wonderful
[1:23:53] church will go forth with power and
[1:23:55] deity because deity will be revealing
[1:23:57] you
[1:23:58] beings by the Holy Spirit bring it to
[1:24:01] pass the part of their mind listen to
[1:24:04] the prophet let me sing it again because
[1:24:07] deity God Himself will be revealing
[1:24:10] human beings by the Holy Spirit bringing
[1:24:13] to pass the thought of their minor Oh
[1:24:17] [Applause]
[1:24:18] somebody give God shut up great by the
[1:24:26] madam said our thoughts run different a
[1:24:28] lot of times
[1:24:29] listen to the Prophet we walk let me see
[1:24:31] how you do brother and you don't mean it
[1:24:33] in your heart a lot of times we say I am
[1:24:37] this and that'll do that you don't mean
[1:24:39] it in a heart see I don't mean it in my
[1:24:41] heart but when you can become so dead to
[1:24:43] the things of the crisis crisis all then
[1:24:48] your entire makeup is up the Spirit of
[1:24:50] the Lord Jesus Christ yes
[1:24:52] full control then your thoughts will be
[1:24:54] clean your pores will be pure your heart
[1:24:57] your heart can the church give the Lord
[1:25:00] a shout of praise
[1:25:03] [Applause]
[1:25:06] so where's PETA money internal thoughts
[1:25:09] of God the mind of Christ and thinking
[1:25:12] his sports and many times we read and
[1:25:17] receive him the Bible and we see that a
[1:25:18] man has his own thoughts and God has
[1:25:21] another thought the woman at the well
[1:25:24] man had their thoughts about her they
[1:25:29] saw as a woman that was with a bunch of
[1:25:31] different men and she would have to go
[1:25:33] at the time and nobody else was going
[1:25:34] because she was she was not welcome in
[1:25:37] the regular gatherings and that was the
[1:25:38] thought of man but when Jesus had needs
[1:25:41] pacified marriage his thoughts was
[1:25:45] different about that woman than what
[1:25:48] man's thoughts were and if we wanna
[1:25:51] kneel down this morning young people and
[1:25:54] church at large it's the eternal
[1:25:56] thoughts of God that matter to us what
[1:25:59] man things about us does not matter it
[1:26:02] is not important all I want to know is
[1:26:05] the thoughts of God concerning the issue
[1:26:08] and the church cement
[1:26:11] you may be seated Saul who became the
[1:26:17] Apostle Paul he had a hard time because
[1:26:21] when he was persecuting the church he
[1:26:23] thought he was doing the right thing he
[1:26:26] was going based on the law as he
[1:26:28] understood it haven't been trained by
[1:26:31] the very best can the church say Amen so
[1:26:34] it was very confusing to him these
[1:26:36] followers of Jesus but when Jesus
[1:26:38] knocked him off his horse and
[1:26:40] interrupted his experience and his
[1:26:43] testimony and changes his nature and his
[1:26:46] name when this sword became poor shut up
[1:26:49] in church the Bible said church folk
[1:26:53] didn't like him
[1:26:55] turn around increase your brother and
[1:26:58] people avoided brother Paul because he
[1:27:01] was the one who had persecuted the
[1:27:03] Christians man had his own thoughts on
[1:27:07] the issue but that was cause apostle he
[1:27:11] was not there with Jesus and he was the
[1:27:13] one to street without a pizza these
[1:27:16] Gentiles not your responsibility
[1:27:19] I'll take care of the issues over there
[1:27:22] you can make the 10,000 the Jews this
[1:27:24] gospel that is to you and for them also
[1:27:27] to save holy loves that's where you is
[1:27:30] for them also
[1:27:31] that was close apostle
[1:27:34] didn't matter what is said to Paul
[1:27:37] didn't matter what is said about him he
[1:27:39] knew either from God he had a revelation
[1:27:43] from God now the Bible said the church
[1:27:49] is built upon a revelation know what
[1:27:52] revelation it's the revelation it's
[1:27:55] someone else revealed to you isn't that
[1:27:57] right reveal from where from the mind of
[1:28:00] God in other words for you to have a
[1:28:02] revelation it means a part of God's
[1:28:04] thinking must connect with you and your
[1:28:08] you find your whole world changes
[1:28:10] because you never saw it that way you
[1:28:12] didn't realize this joy could be so good
[1:28:15] they are updates and their tone is but
[1:28:18] some to the water
[1:28:19] oh good God Almighty it's a revelation
[1:28:23] that comes from God and it keeps you
[1:28:28] alive it wakes you up in the morning
[1:28:30] it's tells you at night you can help
[1:28:33] yourself because God has revealed
[1:28:36] himself to you it's not the pastor it's
[1:28:39] not the bishop it's not the preacher
[1:28:41] what is God himself
[1:28:44] [Music]
[1:28:47] be seated
[1:28:50] to the problem in the church the problem
[1:28:53] in the world is the difference in God's
[1:28:57] thinking from our way of thinking when
[1:29:01] to dispel the good brothers who had
[1:29:05] walked with Jesus talked with Jesus they
[1:29:08] were men taught by Jesus he said let's
[1:29:11] find a proper and they cast lots the
[1:29:14] aterna brother who's a good brother
[1:29:16] he was an anointed brother he was a
[1:29:18] solid brother he was brother with tires
[1:29:22] he was nothing wrong with Matthias but
[1:29:27] that was man's thoughts God had a
[1:29:29] different thinking he had somebody who
[1:29:32] didn't grow up in your circle somebody
[1:29:34] who didn't eat or when you ate it yes
[1:29:36] somebody else in mind that was God's
[1:29:38] thoughts and you know what when the
[1:29:41] world looks at who they think is
[1:29:42] righteous and who's gonna make it that's
[1:29:44] still man's thoughts God has his
[1:29:46] thoughts about you that's why I've said
[1:29:48] so many times the Prophet said when you
[1:29:51] get over there there'll be people there
[1:29:53] who you never thought would make it
[1:29:55] because that would be your thinking but
[1:29:58] in his thoughts he wrote their names in
[1:30:01] blood and nothing could take it out
[1:30:04] somebody get gonna shut up ray
[1:30:10] who may be seated just want to slow down
[1:30:18] a little bit
[1:30:23] buckle get seats it God has his thoughts
[1:30:31] and man has his thoughts that issue of
[1:30:36] thinking you could go straight back to
[1:30:37] the book of Genesis after man fell Abel
[1:30:42] and Cain board had to bring their
[1:30:44] sacrifice you have to think about what
[1:30:48] you're gonna do because every action
[1:30:51] every word every behavior starts from
[1:30:55] the thought revelation impacts your
[1:30:58] thinking if you don't have that ability
[1:31:01] to think to process to analyze me just
[1:31:06] be animals are you with me Paul speaks
[1:31:12] about it as the war of the flesh and I'd
[1:31:16] walk the flesh when he speaks in the
[1:31:17] world of the flesh is speaking about
[1:31:18] that be son nature that animal nature
[1:31:22] and he goes on to describe the effects
[1:31:26] of that sexual immorality and he goes
[1:31:29] down the whole list of an enemy and
[1:31:30] strife and rebellion and he speaks of
[1:31:33] all all of that but we're going to be
[1:31:37] higher so man has his thinking and God
[1:31:39] has his thinking so either by revelation
[1:31:43] because the mind of God would have
[1:31:45] dropped down to show him something he
[1:31:48] couldn't come up with this by himself
[1:31:50] it's against our very nature it's
[1:31:55] against our nature at birth
[1:31:58] to be spiritual because we are born in
[1:32:02] sin and shipped in iniquity so it has to
[1:32:04] take something the mind from our baser
[1:32:10] nature to a higher level of making some
[1:32:14] in the transformer some animals release
[1:32:16] it into spiritual creatures a
[1:32:21] transformation as a take place to not be
[1:32:24] like everybody else because this is
[1:32:28] animals sleeping whatever they want on
[1:32:30] the road so when you see men running
[1:32:36] around women water running right that's
[1:32:38] the best animal piece of nature but when
[1:32:42] your mind is transformed and you have an
[1:32:46] experience with God and you are born
[1:32:49] again then your thinking begins to get
[1:32:52] closer to his thinking until one day we
[1:32:55] have promised gonna be perfect
[1:32:59] husband and wife think in the same way
[1:33:02] oh you don't hear me - Ronnie
[1:33:07] so when they heard about sacrifice Abel
[1:33:10] and his way in went his way and Portman
[1:33:13] whatever they did they came back with
[1:33:15] the expressions of the thoughts that was
[1:33:18] being expressed made on the revelations
[1:33:20] that can impose on all of 1/2 and no he
[1:33:25] meant every good effort it was gonna
[1:33:29] have hearted effort he made a genuine
[1:33:32] effort and he brought fruits that was
[1:33:36] the product of his thinking but Abel
[1:33:38] brought blood
[1:33:39] he took a lemon slay that lemon God was
[1:33:44] so happy because that was his son
[1:33:45] thinking his thoughts that many many
[1:33:51] years after the real life would come up
[1:33:53] Beasley who would have put that in email
[1:33:56] it had to have access to the mind of God
[1:33:59] [Applause]
[1:34:04] now listen predestination gives you
[1:34:09] access to the mind of God because if you
[1:34:13] are not predestinated if you're not the
[1:34:16] attribute seed of God you can never come
[1:34:18] into access with the mind of God so your
[1:34:23] lordship on your praise is not based on
[1:34:26] how you feel and what you went through
[1:34:28] your childhood and things worked out
[1:34:31] great this week so you feel like
[1:34:33] something more this week than last week
[1:34:35] it has all to do that you have seen
[1:34:37] sleeping what God has shown you he has
[1:34:41] given your access to his intelligence
[1:34:43] that no weapon formed against you can
[1:34:46] prosper that has to shift from Scripture
[1:34:50] that the thought it has to become your
[1:34:52] thought so it can become your world
[1:34:59] you may be seated I mean kneeling down
[1:35:02] I'm teaching a little bit when you see
[1:35:05] scripture scripture has to be applied in
[1:35:09] relevance so the scripture was there
[1:35:13] sitting all along but when Jesus came
[1:35:15] and read it by definition he should have
[1:35:18] done what every other young brother had
[1:35:20] done go back to his seat but when he
[1:35:22] said this day the Scriptures fulfilled
[1:35:24] he brought the present and applied it to
[1:35:27] his life by revelation nobody had done
[1:35:31] that nobody was authorized to do that
[1:35:35] before but because he was the very mind
[1:35:38] of God expressed he could rip open the
[1:35:41] scrolls and find the substance of what
[1:35:44] was written there and listen it was no
[1:35:48] longer catch this may be seen it very
[1:35:50] important it was no longer the words of
[1:35:53] the book it had not become his words he
[1:35:57] was saying the Spirit of the Lord is
[1:35:59] upon me
[1:36:01] so he anointed me it was now his lip
[1:36:07] Chuck that's why he can have the
[1:36:10] authority to save this day this
[1:36:13] scripture is fulfilled because this
[1:36:16] scripture is me when God thought about
[1:36:19] it he was talking about me when the
[1:36:23] prophets spoke he was making it to me
[1:36:26] [Applause]
[1:36:37] you may be seated you see Catholicism
[1:36:42] has done a number on Christendom of
[1:36:45] Christianity as a whole that scriptures
[1:36:48] at ease catchphrases every day I read
[1:36:53] Emma Sam's alone but that's not your
[1:36:55] scriptures until the thoughts that wrote
[1:37:02] the sounds become your thoughts and you
[1:37:07] can speak those words because they're
[1:37:08] your thoughts expressed then it's not
[1:37:11] your scripture let me say that again
[1:37:15] this breaks all the religious spirits in
[1:37:18] the message it means the message is not
[1:37:21] just your message until the thought
[1:37:23] behind a message from the mind of Christ
[1:37:27] becomes your thinking you can record all
[1:37:31] the every day it will never be your
[1:37:34] quotes until the intelligence of God
[1:37:36] drops down and you're thinking because
[1:37:39] his thinking that when you speak it
[1:37:42] becomes as worse
[1:37:46] no wonder the Apostles to take no
[1:37:49] thought of what he said because they
[1:37:51] were faking his thoughts oh oh
[1:37:59] somebody say man I'm not done yet
[1:38:10] he's still warming up because we went to
[1:38:13] break our human thinking service long
[1:38:18] you weren't thinking service short you
[1:38:21] might thinking show me any middle human
[1:38:23] thinking but all of it should be
[1:38:25] preaching you might thinking the other
[1:38:27] Anthony supposing preaching you might
[1:38:28] thinking but I shouldn't be preaching
[1:38:30] human thinking but I should pitch again
[1:38:32] human thinking but it Stephenson pre-sex
[1:38:35] human thinking who's gonna lead songs
[1:38:37] human thinking what times never gonna
[1:38:39] start human thinking Oh what shall
[1:38:41] should I go to human thinking until
[1:38:43] God's please see you it's human thinking
[1:38:46] how many intelligent shrubs town North
[1:38:48] devil could move you because the
[1:38:51] revelation is that this young man what
[1:38:53] is this and God told me God spoke to me
[1:38:58] you may be seated
[1:39:02] maybe see it that's why better always
[1:39:05] had many timeouts we can i has to
[1:39:06] Tabernacle here I'm at home many time
[1:39:09] pray time a revelation to be in this
[1:39:11] church because you have to have a
[1:39:14] revelation
[1:39:15] I saw a court recently people asked if
[1:39:21] you need the Holy Ghost to make the
[1:39:23] rapture and his response was you need a
[1:39:25] Holy Ghost to go to the supermarket not
[1:39:32] even heard the regulars was the Whoopie
[1:39:34] to wake up in the morning to step on
[1:39:35] your house near the Holy Ghost everybody
[1:39:38] with me do you need to pray and talk to
[1:39:41] God so he could give you his spot on the
[1:39:43] matter Lord I have my thought for what
[1:39:45] are your thoughts Jesus himself had to
[1:39:48] do they say Lord not my will oh but I
[1:39:52] will be done give me your thoughts
[1:39:54] father Oh to think what God things you
[1:39:58] see when it when you're thinking changes
[1:40:00] can we preach can we take some time this
[1:40:02] way you're thinking affects your senses
[1:40:07] so I can walk down the road and I see
[1:40:12] somebody take the speaker from of the
[1:40:15] pole and so we get asked me who took it
[1:40:18] describe him well there was a man he was
[1:40:21] he was what five feet he wear a red
[1:40:25] shirt that's the product of my thinking
[1:40:27] but if a police officer happened to
[1:40:30] witnesses and you asked him the same
[1:40:32] question his response is different who
[1:40:34] took it he said
[1:40:35] slight build mark on his head his shoes
[1:40:38] has this it should has this why because
[1:40:40] his thinking he has been trained in his
[1:40:42] thinking to see more than what you can
[1:40:44] see it's always amazes me when a master
[1:40:48] of their art walk into a master Paynter
[1:40:50] bill or whatever they walk in that is
[1:40:53] two inches off there are musicians who
[1:40:56] can walk in the room and say hey yes
[1:40:58] yeah fourth string on the guitar needs a
[1:41:00] tightener because his thinking is
[1:41:04] different
[1:41:05] I with me they are people who could
[1:41:09] watch your body language and they teach
[1:41:12] you that when you doing presentations a
[1:41:14] look at body like when people fooled
[1:41:16] hand like this it means they are
[1:41:18] building a barrier and they're
[1:41:20] unconsciously resistant what you're
[1:41:22] saying and I see people's I need to make
[1:41:24] sure they buddy now they are scientists
[1:41:31] who have studied facial behavior to see
[1:41:34] when the actual person you look up
[1:41:35] unicorn on your left
[1:41:36] it's mean you're creating an idea lion
[1:41:41] that is not in your nature to lie so
[1:41:44] your body exposes you
[1:41:46] [Applause]
[1:41:47] [Music]
[1:41:49] and their men who are trained trained to
[1:41:52] spot those things so you spitted on
[1:41:55] Monday and they and they're reading you
[1:41:57] and sales they teach you in sales if
[1:41:59] you're selling mimic the way the person
[1:42:01] is in front of you said if they lean
[1:42:02] forward lean forward if the lean
[1:42:05] backward lean backward honest and if man
[1:42:08] in his natural thinking to do this what
[1:42:12] about the higher intelligence of Troy
[1:42:13] the discern the thoughts and intents of
[1:42:16] your heart but the Brandon said he will
[1:42:20] go into the mountains to get away from
[1:42:22] the people because he was tired of the
[1:42:24] hypocrisy in the church god bless you
[1:42:27] brother and what they sing in their
[1:42:29] heart what you're thinking it's a whole
[1:42:32] different thing so our thinking has to
[1:42:38] die always have to die our feelings have
[1:42:44] to die and God is a specialist at
[1:42:49] creating situations to break your
[1:42:51] thinking what one see here you see I've
[1:42:55] given up I'm confused
[1:42:57] I'm fed up because you have tried your
[1:43:00] way and when you have exhausted all of
[1:43:02] your options no you can be ready ready
[1:43:04] to try this way but young people I warn
[1:43:08] you in the name of the Lord don't make
[1:43:10] the mistakes that others have made you
[1:43:14] could take the world to heart and live
[1:43:16] this would I don't care who did what
[1:43:18] there's no excuses
[1:43:19] they have no exceptions we read the
[1:43:22] quote God is not now learning not taking
[1:43:25] counsel with himself he doesn't change
[1:43:27] his mind
[1:43:28] I don't care how society changes does
[1:43:32] not change choruses I am God and I
[1:43:35] changed
[1:43:36] I don't care how Hollywood portrays it
[1:43:41] fornication is still sin oh you don't
[1:43:44] hear me this morning people have their
[1:43:52] own interpretations they take the Bible
[1:43:54] to mean what and that's why I said the
[1:43:57] reveal word is the present tense you
[1:43:59] decide to bring some notebooks the
[1:44:01] present tense of mine of Christ on the
[1:44:04] word for the hour because when me the
[1:44:08] Branham is speaking it's the
[1:44:10] intelligence speaking addressing the
[1:44:13] situation's take him the word that's to
[1:44:16] rip the word because everything has to
[1:44:18] be in there so where the planner was
[1:44:20] opening and connecting the loose ends
[1:44:22] but he couldn't add or take away from
[1:44:24] there oh my somebody say man everybody
[1:44:31] feeling fine could we take someone sweet
[1:44:35] oh my god thinking and man's thinking
[1:44:37] Gideon the mighty man of Valor God's
[1:44:42] thinking
[1:44:43] Gideon thinking who me I'm from the
[1:44:46] smallest tribe he brings on his resume
[1:44:49] in the tribe my family is the smallest
[1:44:53] family in the whole tribe and to get
[1:44:58] specific I and the smallest in my family
[1:45:01] that was Gideon's thinking but God has a
[1:45:06] different thinking about him
[1:45:08] look at Moses the Bible tells us most of
[1:45:11] us trained in everything the Egyptians
[1:45:13] had he was changing their science and
[1:45:16] their philosophy in their religion in
[1:45:17] their beliefs he was trained in every
[1:45:19] area of it but when he caught that he
[1:45:22] was none of them
[1:45:23] his thinking the result of all of this
[1:45:26] training was kill one man and run for
[1:45:27] his life that was his graduation reward
[1:45:31] kill one man run for your life after all
[1:45:34] of the training but when he met the
[1:45:36] pillar of fire when you met her burning
[1:45:38] bush his thinking was changed the mind
[1:45:41] of God dropped down to show him how to
[1:45:44] deliver his people
[1:45:46] who shall I say send me I am that I am
[1:45:50] he cut a snapshot into the mind of God I
[1:45:54] am whatever you need I am your joy peace
[1:45:58] I am your comfort I am your deliverer
[1:46:00] and Moses he was it was not a different
[1:46:04] man it was a change man the same Moses
[1:46:07] but he had a different mind he had a
[1:46:09] different thinking he had a different
[1:46:11] hope you saw the possibility he had had
[1:46:14] an experience so whereas he had run his
[1:46:17] life running from danger now he was
[1:46:20] walking to danger because his mind was
[1:46:22] made up because he had met a pair of
[1:46:25] fire and that's what the church needs is
[1:46:28] to meet the pillar of fire
[1:46:30] [Applause]
[1:46:34] look at Joshua Joshua knew that his
[1:46:37] intelligence what's not good enough he's
[1:46:40] thinking what's not good enough his
[1:46:43] thought process what's not good enough
[1:46:45] so you went aside away from everybody
[1:46:47] else while he's meditating he's
[1:46:49] sharpening his sword because he knows no
[1:46:51] matter what he has got to be ready but
[1:46:53] he's really trying to find a way because
[1:46:55] he know yes to go poety he cannot go
[1:46:57] back he he can't stay where he is he has
[1:47:00] to find a way and God knew his thinking
[1:47:08] was sunny now God knows when your
[1:47:10] thinking is not enough God knows when
[1:47:13] you ran out of options
[1:47:14] God knows when and while Joshua was in
[1:47:22] his place he hears the noise and he he
[1:47:25] just does what comes natural to him he
[1:47:26] swings his sword are you for us are you
[1:47:28] against us I'm in a warrior mood I'm I'm
[1:47:31] I'm in a mood to kill the enemy so make
[1:47:34] your make your position known very clear
[1:47:36] very fast because because I'm here to
[1:47:38] kill Devils I'm Heather so push the
[1:47:40] devil back I'm either send demons where
[1:47:43] it come from
[1:47:44] [Applause]
[1:47:46] and the voice said Joshua holy and the
[1:47:49] captain of the Xhosa I know you're
[1:47:51] looking for the right approach when I
[1:47:53] come out to tell you just how to do it
[1:47:56] I've already thought about a victory
[1:47:58] I've already thought about how you're
[1:48:00] gonna win the battle and got him now to
[1:48:03] do what give Joshua his
[1:48:11] I can imagine Joshua walking back out of
[1:48:15] the tactus back to the candle lit fire
[1:48:18] that is normally surrounding his tent
[1:48:21] with the elders waited to hear from him
[1:48:23] this is not the Joshua who was just
[1:48:26] sharpening his soul this is now Joshua
[1:48:28] with God's thinking he had heard from
[1:48:32] God he knew God's thoughts on the matter
[1:48:39] there's nothing like knowing what is
[1:48:42] about to happen how it's about to play
[1:48:44] out where the enemy is gonna fall
[1:48:47] I could imagine Josh was joy telling the
[1:48:51] people don't get excited
[1:48:53] take it easy I've heard from the Lord I
[1:48:58] know what he's thinking
[1:49:01] I have his foots on the first day you're
[1:49:07] gonna go around once
[1:49:08] why just worry about it just trust I
[1:49:12] have this thinking on the second able to
[1:49:15] go around another time why trust what
[1:49:18] don't worry about it
[1:49:19] God already thought about it on the
[1:49:21] third day under 40 unaffected but on the
[1:49:23] seventh day God has a different plan
[1:49:26] walk around seven times you have to
[1:49:29] break the routine a little bit but seven
[1:49:31] days the six things you've been doing
[1:49:34] the same there but when the seventh day
[1:49:35] comes when the seven each comes with a
[1:49:39] pretty routine move it begins i Adam
[1:49:42] like all the years all the teams we had
[1:49:45] before don't try to figure it out are we
[1:49:48] gonna connect to what happened on the
[1:49:50] first day what happened on the second
[1:49:52] day Joshua was living on the mystery of
[1:49:54] the ages I didn't even know it but he
[1:49:56] was in God's pinky
[1:50:01] you didn't see what woke you up this
[1:50:08] morning and truly you had to come to the
[1:50:10] house of God that wasn't your thinking
[1:50:14] the Bible says no man could come unless
[1:50:17] the father draws his thoughts being
[1:50:23] Express here this morning that's why you
[1:50:25] are here and God will continue to
[1:50:30] increase the heat in your life it's a
[1:50:33] marvel to me when you read a course over
[1:50:35] the bottom said how few wouldn't be in
[1:50:37] the rapture and the deeper I go I
[1:50:39] realize the few and the filtering
[1:50:42] process to the rapture is about people
[1:50:44] want you to hold on to themselves that's
[1:50:50] the problem
[1:50:51] people the whole lawn because when I ran
[1:50:54] towards the devil is religious here the
[1:50:57] devil this morning the devil this
[1:50:58] morning is not in a party the devil is
[1:51:03] in churches this morning and you know
[1:51:06] what the Bible says he never believes
[1:51:07] what he never says amen
[1:51:11] and tremors there people in church this
[1:51:14] morning here not even trembling but the
[1:51:19] devil believes he's religious he's aa
[1:51:22] religious being he was of the class of
[1:51:25] the angels whose primary responsibility
[1:51:28] is is to worship
[1:51:31] that's his pedigree that's his class so
[1:51:35] we can expect nothing less from them and
[1:51:38] when the Brennan said as we come to the
[1:51:39] end - spirits working in the framework
[1:51:41] of the church will be so close that it
[1:51:44] was deceive the very elect if it were
[1:51:46] possible but the random out I mean I get
[1:51:52] it but when I said there are 22
[1:51:54] thinking's he calls not the two
[1:51:55] influences because influences on your
[1:51:59] mind because the war is for your mind
[1:52:02] the mind was the agreed battleground but
[1:52:11] the banner get the story of the Hall in
[1:52:13] German I believe it was who they asked
[1:52:15] him how does he how does he protect us
[1:52:17] or when the rooster comes or whatever
[1:52:18] the bird come he says well I sue this
[1:52:20] one I let this one land and I shoot this
[1:52:21] one make the point that you can't stop
[1:52:24] the thoughts come into your mind
[1:52:26] but the Branham said many times he said
[1:52:29] the issue is not being tempted because
[1:52:32] the mind is the place to be tempted it's
[1:52:35] what you do when the temptation comes
[1:52:38] the mind is the agreed battleground so
[1:52:42] what are you talking about I see a woman
[1:52:44] is treated that is the temptation but
[1:52:49] you know what but the Branham said the
[1:52:51] Christian turns his head
[1:52:54] God is not going to position only naked
[1:52:57] women on a certain Street a certain time
[1:52:59] to mix earlier when you pass the night
[1:53:00] there so if that is your prayer change
[1:53:07] that one the devil has to do what he
[1:53:11] will do but as a Christian because his
[1:53:14] thinking he is holy his thinking is holy
[1:53:17] he is righteous his thinking is
[1:53:20] righteous he is perfect his thinking is
[1:53:23] perfect but as we get closer to him I
[1:53:25] was thinking because I get more like he
[1:53:27] is thinking more like his thinking more
[1:53:30] like his thinking until after live in
[1:53:32] advance and when the Holy Ghost comes in
[1:53:34] you are thinking and his thinking begins
[1:53:36] to get so in sync that your nature your
[1:53:38] appetite after while you don't even see
[1:53:41] the woman anymore it doesn't even beat
[1:53:43] on your head they don't even exist to
[1:53:44] you anymore
[1:53:45] because it's dead - you're thinking it's
[1:53:47] dead to your nature you are creature of
[1:53:50] eternity
[1:53:51] [Music]
[1:53:54] [Applause]
[1:53:56] God told Joshua meditate on the word day
[1:54:00] and night so you will have good success
[1:54:04] when you meditate on anything day and
[1:54:07] night it affects your thinking study the
[1:54:12] world anybody in any group or or study
[1:54:15] or whatever it is they say repeat repeat
[1:54:18] say it over say it over until after a
[1:54:21] while but a parent did the same thing
[1:54:22] the man came he prayed for him he didn't
[1:54:25] get healed he said go and repeat every
[1:54:26] day by stripes I'm healed by stripes I'm
[1:54:28] healed by stripes I'm here my stripes
[1:54:30] I'm healed by sharks I travel
[1:54:33] he's Express Express you read all about
[1:54:36] it by stripes on here until one day
[1:54:38] it's change from wood into mentally I'm
[1:54:41] Metta feel connected because God already
[1:54:44] healed him but he had to believe it go
[1:54:48] to the Prophet if you can get the people
[1:54:50] who believe not even cancer was standing
[1:54:54] for you I know the crazy thing is people
[1:54:59] believe you where a man he would believe
[1:55:02] the Prime Minister people really eat the
[1:55:04] president people leave me a
[1:55:06] schoolteacher and when I was in Stanford
[1:55:07] five I came home I say that's the way
[1:55:09] that said X Y & Z and my daughters are
[1:55:12] my boys no sir
[1:55:12] but sir said I believed in myself I
[1:55:16] teacher if you told me anything that my
[1:55:19] son if a teacher did not agree with you
[1:55:21] was in trouble because I believed he had
[1:55:24] such an impact on my thinking that I
[1:55:27] believed everything he said it took me
[1:55:30] the stars was killing about
[1:55:31] strengthening us I was so sad he's tired
[1:55:34] I connected by a string to the earth but
[1:55:41] when we come to the house of God and the
[1:55:42] word has reached us it is sweet to have
[1:55:45] an influence on thinking for us to begin
[1:55:47] to see a things that defy logic
[1:55:50] [Music]
[1:55:50] [Applause]
[1:55:54] try to logically explain if you shall
[1:55:57] say to this mountain be moved and you
[1:55:59] can explain it anyway how can you
[1:56:03] explain it somebody and God said let
[1:56:06] there be light and there was light that
[1:56:09] can be logic so there has to be
[1:56:11] something comes over you to open up your
[1:56:14] mind and your heart to see the fact that
[1:56:17] what exists is exists from what is not
[1:56:19] seen that the doctor can see something
[1:56:23] about you but from a place that the
[1:56:25] doctors cannot see there's power to
[1:56:27] influence what you see then the Prophet
[1:56:33] can be away from his wife and he can
[1:56:35] speak before the doctors hand touches my
[1:56:38] wife the tumor will go down can imagine
[1:56:44] how the doctor felt but that's how the
[1:56:47] mind of God is kind of sure it's a man
[1:56:49] could he take someone for evil it took
[1:56:56] the mind of Christ because the prophesy
[1:56:59] the prophesy you need the mind of Christ
[1:57:03] because the prophesy means to tell
[1:57:05] something on the inspiration or to
[1:57:07] foretell by the man is about to take
[1:57:10] place
[1:57:10] so if you are foretelling or inspired
[1:57:13] it's not the mind of Christ then what's
[1:57:17] influencing you so David was on the
[1:57:19] inspiration it would have been the mind
[1:57:21] of Christ Fame the drop drop down upon
[1:57:23] him so he could prophesy I'll chop your
[1:57:25] head off
[1:57:26] especially when David didn't ever saw it
[1:57:29] it's one thing if David had a sword and
[1:57:31] we can ask you beaut the statement to
[1:57:33] him but the fact that David had no sword
[1:57:36] meant he was reaching somewhere else to
[1:57:38] pull the faith to speak this amateur say
[1:57:41] man
[1:57:42] so I'm not gonna be too much longer when
[1:57:44] I hope this helps you repentance
[1:57:48] real repentance we talked about its
[1:57:51] sealing away from you get it here all
[1:57:53] right to turn away from but really
[1:57:55] penance also beans or really means to
[1:57:57] turn away from your own thoughts and
[1:58:00] ways and think God's thoughts that's
[1:58:04] what real repentance is and we know the
[1:58:07] Bible we said it before is what an
[1:58:08] earless town is the expression of the
[1:58:11] thoughts of God the mind of Christ
[1:58:15] there's a difference in the way core
[1:58:17] things underway be things it's a
[1:58:20] difference in his ways and our ways the
[1:58:23] progress we try to bring core down to
[1:58:26] our thinking we try to bring him down to
[1:58:29] always and God goes further to clarify
[1:58:32] this did this difference between his
[1:58:34] thoughts or thoughts his ways always and
[1:58:36] says if you want to measure the distance
[1:58:38] is that the heavens are higher than it
[1:58:41] that's how high his thoughts are from
[1:58:44] our thoughts I'll do some research on
[1:58:46] that distance I ran into some technical
[1:58:54] difficulties on Google so the change
[1:58:58] your words I'm not gonna be too much
[1:59:02] longer you must change your thinking
[1:59:06] the teens your actions you must change
[1:59:10] your thinking to change your behavior
[1:59:14] you must change your thinking to change
[1:59:17] your prayer life you must change your
[1:59:21] thinking this thing about thinking
[1:59:28] change is probably because a lot of
[1:59:29] people they come to church and they're
[1:59:31] waiting for God to do something for them
[1:59:34] and while it has its place there's a lot
[1:59:37] that God has already given you that your
[1:59:40] thinking needs to change to understand
[1:59:43] the power that you already have so the
[1:59:46] Bible says stuff like if my people will
[1:59:48] humble themselves on pray seek my face
[1:59:52] turn from their wicked ways they will
[1:59:54] hear from heaven and I will heal their
[1:59:56] land that's the Bible and people are
[1:59:59] praying and turning it from their wicked
[2:00:01] ways and see we're waiting for the
[2:00:03] dynamic what dynamics are you waiting
[2:00:05] for when you have mechanic you have not
[2:00:08] operated yet because the dynamics comes
[2:00:12] to operate what you
[2:00:16] let me say this again this spirit comes
[2:00:19] to bring to light what you cannot do in
[2:00:22] your own strength you could do that
[2:00:25] last thing you can do that arm at the
[2:00:27] church on time you mean to tell me you
[2:00:30] need that now makes the comatose on time
[2:00:31] [Applause]
[2:00:34] Jesus praying you say forgive those who
[2:00:38] trespass against us is sweet
[2:00:40] forgive us our trespasses as we think
[2:00:43] you mean to tell me that you can't
[2:00:46] forgive that's that's on you that's on
[2:00:54] you you have to figure it out work out
[2:01:01] your salvation we read it with fear and
[2:01:03] trembling
[2:01:05] yeah because not gonna be easy and
[2:01:07] tourmaline because trust me it's not
[2:01:09] easy but you have to work it out Oh
[2:01:14] somebody say Amen
[2:01:19] to change your approach to God your
[2:01:22] thinking must change from the Lord give
[2:01:28] me give me give me the Lord I'm here to
[2:01:30] serve you Lord I bring a sacrifice your
[2:01:37] fridge we bring a sacrifice if we read a
[2:01:39] book of sounds you're thinking I was
[2:01:45] hearing a prophet say a few days ago but
[2:01:49] the Branham was repenting he was
[2:01:52] repenting for not bringing enough souls
[2:01:56] to the kingdom and he asks a question to
[2:01:59] the church she said how many souls have
[2:02:02] you brought to Christ since you have met
[2:02:04] Jesus and he had an altar call for
[2:02:09] people who have never witnessed to
[2:02:11] anybody our thinking has to change
[2:02:16] because we talk about God it's something
[2:02:19] to us and you don't want to tell anybody
[2:02:29] to deal with greater challenges that
[2:02:32] will come our way our thinking must
[2:02:36] change
[2:02:44] but the Branham said what we need today
[2:02:46] is a good old-fashioned all-time scene
[2:02:49] pause revival and the Bible holy goes
[2:02:52] back into the church again education
[2:02:55] will never do it I'm not talking about
[2:02:56] education I'm talking my total surrender
[2:02:59] toward the word says I'm not this ala
[2:03:03] carte or buffet approach well I want
[2:03:05] this today and I already want this this
[2:03:07] weekend but the round said how do you
[2:03:12] grow every day you said read the Bible
[2:03:14] and pray every day that's ABC's ABCs you
[2:03:20] can't deal with the algebra if you can't
[2:03:22] pass the ABC class I'm gonna has no
[2:03:24] skipping classes and dropping a head he
[2:03:27] says he has no grandchildren it's just
[2:03:29] sons and daughters and if Jesus had to
[2:03:32] learn obedience by the things that he
[2:03:34] suffered what's your Excuse God will
[2:03:38] take you through whatever trial you will
[2:03:40] pull up your life and that's an algebra
[2:03:45] because in algebra he said an adoption
[2:03:47] he's telling your wife against you he
[2:03:49] turn your husband against you he turned
[2:03:51] the church against you he'll try you
[2:03:53] he'll test you because his follower
[2:03:56] happened and he has to make sure you
[2:03:58] have the character so what are you
[2:04:00] complaining about what are you crying
[2:04:03] about
[2:04:04] [Applause]
[2:04:07] when your thinking has changed you could
[2:04:11] stand alone
[2:04:12] [Music]
[2:04:15] you can stand alone you know I think you
[2:04:18] made me see that
[2:04:19] could I keep on I think of wars Vietnam
[2:04:24] different Wars many times they would
[2:04:27] have these prisoners of war and he would
[2:04:29] read stories afterwards of prisoners who
[2:04:32] were tortured to give information about
[2:04:36] where the enemy was already where every
[2:04:37] campus located and they were these
[2:04:39] soldiers who they could never break he
[2:04:43] could never break them defeat them tell
[2:04:47] us where captain is located and they
[2:04:49] seemed nothing they were trained to say
[2:04:51] I am George II two five seven eight
[2:04:53] Marines so I would every last eight
[2:04:57] o'clock that's what they said they could
[2:05:00] not break them
[2:05:02] [Applause]
[2:05:05] that strength is human mental strength
[2:05:09] [Applause]
[2:05:11] quad straight that's not the mind of
[2:05:14] Christ what is your excuse
[2:05:19] try a common where's he where's he can't
[2:05:23] a located here's what you see the
[2:05:25] pastor's house if you take the main road
[2:05:35] one trial come you say this is only
[2:05:38] church members after four numbers are
[2:05:43] there order what's up let me go but
[2:05:49] those men stood their ground it's the
[2:05:52] same thing with Christians who were
[2:05:54] persecuted and attack itches Jesus
[2:05:57] Christ is the Lord but if Adam said it
[2:06:00] was a yes or no it was like let's be
[2:06:04] there on Sundays in the world but I'm
[2:06:06] still checking it out I already make up
[2:06:08] my mind fully so you can let me go if I
[2:06:11] already convinced outcome no if they
[2:06:13] said yes Lyons then it was said no they
[2:06:17] go back home it's a choice I know if
[2:06:21] that ages will come back here today I
[2:06:23] can count
[2:06:27] [Applause]
[2:06:35] we're keeping it really at this morning
[2:06:38] but if not this is the hottest is but
[2:06:42] you know that it was easier it was yes
[2:06:45] or no it's like yes Lord and you know
[2:06:50] that's it and you know I can't give them
[2:06:53] Chris and I ox anointing that it went

[2:07:20] made up something has to happen in your
[2:07:23] life for that song to become a real
[2:07:25] reality to you God will take you to stop
[2:07:29] until you can say I've got my mind made
[2:07:31] up
[2:07:33] after you lost enough I've got my mind

[2:08:02] daughter's kid one sister my body I've
[2:08:05] got my mind made up to serve the Lord
[2:08:09] all of my black my mind I'm not a singer
[2:08:14] but I feel like singing oh god help us
[2:08:17] is smooth
[2:08:23] what up friends it has got to be real to
[2:08:30] you
[2:08:32] not a soul is enough there has got to be
[2:08:36] reality the rapture is real this message
[2:08:39] is real this gospel is real oh we are
[2:08:51] back to the Bible this morning oh
[2:08:53] there's a real pride that's coming
[2:08:55] fought because the time of the word I
[2:08:58] was brought by the Prophet is the
[2:09:00] expressed thoughts of God concerning
[2:09:02] everything but the first time when
[2:09:06] Abraham was here when Moses was here
[2:09:08] when Joshua was here when Zechariah was
[2:09:10] here when Isaiah was here even when
[2:09:13] Jesus was here go out to wait until you
[2:09:17] unfold in his spots until he could bring
[2:09:20] it our people who could appreciate the
[2:09:22] fullness of what this whole plan has all
[2:09:25] been about
[2:09:25] he couldn't have done it before you have
[2:09:28] to ever keep up with the special
[2:09:30] capacity to be the receiver the mind of
[2:09:34] Christ
[2:09:35] even the intelligence to know what he
[2:09:37] wants done with the water
[2:09:39] oh come on church come on church
[2:09:45] my random cell what we need to do is get
[2:09:49] rid of a lot of our fancy fandango's and
[2:09:52] get back to the Bible and back to the
[2:09:55] old-fashioned Holy Ghost
[2:09:57] that's the spots of call and back to the
[2:09:59] place where men and woman look and act
[2:10:03] and walk like Christians oh oh you might
[2:10:06] think I'm a little excited
[2:10:07] I'm just a little crazy but I tell you I
[2:10:10] love to be this way
[2:10:11] that's my prophet hallelujah
[2:10:18] you may be seated but the banner said if
[2:10:21] you have aught against anyone even an
[2:10:23] unbeliever you are standing damnation of
[2:10:26] Hell fire come on now we want his
[2:10:29] thoughts on the matter I don't care what
[2:10:31] you think
[2:10:31] it's irrelevant God doesn't even care
[2:10:34] what you're thinking all he wants to do
[2:10:36] is press his thoughts inside of you then
[2:10:39] you can become an instrument he can see
[2:10:41] there's my spirit flowing freely here's
[2:10:44] my son there's my daughter they are not
[2:10:47] thinking their thoughts they are
[2:10:48] thinking my thoughts my thought and all
[2:10:50] the effort my words are their words they
[2:10:53] are flesh of my flesh they are all of my
[2:10:56] poem they are spirit of my spirit that's
[2:10:59] my wife that's my bride that's my lady
[2:11:03] and by them and through them we'll
[2:11:06] people fill everything in the world give
[2:11:09] the Lord a shout of praise
[2:11:11] [Applause]
[2:11:24] I'm not going to be too much longer but
[2:11:28] I want to drive this down we wonder what
[2:11:35] our neighbors think Christmas coming up
[2:11:39] people wonder what anybody thinks
[2:11:41] we wonder what our families think we
[2:11:45] wonder what our community things you
[2:11:47] wonder what our various things
[2:11:49] our people our tribe our clique of a
[2:11:53] group is there anybody interested what
[2:11:55] God thinks we wonder what our school
[2:11:59] friends think what-whatever coworkers
[2:12:02] think we wonder what the church for
[2:12:05] think you know what 99% of the church
[2:12:07] was wrong because churches present all
[2:12:12] traditions of the elders that I'm not
[2:12:17] even scriptural that's why does given
[2:12:21] that seeking the Lord while he may be
[2:12:22] found
[2:12:22] silver and come back return to God not
[2:12:25] return to church there's so much flesh
[2:12:28] in the church
[2:12:30] that's my government pull out from the
[2:12:32] church his bride not please not talk was
[2:12:36] not man-made ideas nothing how we do it
[2:12:39] for 40 years I don't want to hear it
[2:12:41] give me his thoughts on the matter
[2:12:43] that's what I want the thoughts of God
[2:12:50] is there anybody interested in what
[2:12:53] questions the musicians can get ready
[2:12:58] I'm not gonna be too much longer because
[2:13:01] a person goes to church because the
[2:13:03] person is in the message because someone
[2:13:05] listens to the preacher and follows the
[2:13:08] instruction of the elders does that mean
[2:13:10] that they automatically begin to think
[2:13:12] the way God thinks but the Branham he
[2:13:24] reference and like I said Albert
[2:13:26] Einstein many times listen to Albert
[2:13:29] Einstein's quotation the world as we
[2:13:31] have created it is the process of our
[2:13:33] thinking it cannot be changed without
[2:13:36] changing our thinking decisions are a
[2:13:41] product of thinking you cannot decide
[2:13:43] unless there was some measure of thought
[2:13:47] it may have been a lot of thinking it
[2:13:49] may be very little thinking but whenever
[2:13:52] a decision is made a decision is the
[2:13:55] result of an equal sign I have decided
[2:14:00] further Jesus a decision is made what is
[2:14:07] your decision today because when the
[2:14:11] thoughts of God become your thoughts
[2:14:13] your decisions would be like his
[2:14:16] decisions many of us in the days when
[2:14:21] Jesus was there would have condemned the
[2:14:22] woman at the well because that was the
[2:14:25] prevailing thinking of that day when
[2:14:28] Matthew the tax collector came to church
[2:14:30] didn't like Matthew that was their
[2:14:34] thinking but God called Matthew because
[2:14:37] he was predestinated to be one of the
[2:14:40] twelve not as a book of Matthew go
[2:14:43] figure that out
[2:14:43] the brothers had to accept that because
[2:14:45] it was God's choice because up until the
[2:14:48] upper room they were still subject to
[2:14:50] their own thinking on two occasions
[2:14:52] reading in Scripture listen to the
[2:14:54] disciples challenge even after the
[2:14:56] Lord's Supper Jesus found the disciples
[2:15:00] arguing who
[2:15:02] between us in more than one place in
[2:15:06] scripture the best thing the disciples
[2:15:08] that discuss after the loss of her is
[2:15:10] who's here who's greater who's greater
[2:15:15] among us I'm takiyah had to come and say
[2:15:18] well here here's what here's what my
[2:15:20] thinking is different from your thinking
[2:15:22] let me his greatest let him to show you
[2:15:29] how God's thinking is different from our
[2:15:32] thinking and you are born with your
[2:15:36] thinking you can be gonna piss on myself
[2:15:39] and our thinking is influenced by our
[2:15:43] parents by our school teachers by the
[2:15:47] preacher by people around us and there's
[2:15:50] a difference between the parallel to the
[2:15:53] teacher even the preacher and God
[2:15:55] himself revealing his thinking we are
[2:15:59] not promised the mind of the preacher or
[2:16:01] the mind of the pastor we are promised
[2:16:03] the mind of Christ to know what he wants
[2:16:06] done with the wood with a random said
[2:16:09] their churches take on the spirit of the
[2:16:11] pasta that's the Prophet we don't want a
[2:16:15] spirit of the pasta we want the Holy
[2:16:17] Spirit
[2:16:20] I don't want anybody's thinking on the
[2:16:22] matter what is God's thinking on the
[2:16:25] matter God thinking is repent and be
[2:16:28] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:16:31] Christ for the remission of your sins
[2:16:32] and there's a promise that you shall
[2:16:34] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[2:16:36] that's his thinking on the matter
[2:16:39] there's no room for interpretation when
[2:16:41] God has taught it and express it in the
[2:16:44] world when he acts person have you
[2:16:50] received the Holy Ghost since you
[2:16:51] believed Paul wasn't speaking his
[2:16:54] thoughts he was thinking his thoughts he
[2:16:59] had a burden for these believers they
[2:17:01] weren't genuine believers pipe record
[2:17:06] speaks to you today and his thoughts
[2:17:09] will become your fists because the catch
[2:17:12] of burden to catch a bullet of a prayer
[2:17:15] to catch a bullet or in fact because God
[2:17:17] has a burden twenty Lord I wanna put it
[2:17:21] into pre it's you entering a mind of God
[2:17:24] to catch his burden that's why I said I
[2:17:28] put a mark upon those who sigh and cry
[2:17:30] for the abomination in the City summer
[2:17:33] crying that's for the old house that's
[2:17:35] what I'm talking about
[2:17:38] Zion crying please the Zion cry that
[2:17:41] burden must come from somewhere else it
[2:17:44] is not your nature to be that way it has
[2:17:46] to be God's nature but God so loved the
[2:17:49] world he gave His only Son he gave
[2:17:51] everything that's his nature oh god help
[2:17:56] us we talk about Adam falling in the
[2:17:59] garden listen carefully Adam was just
[2:18:03] like his father his thinking was like
[2:18:06] his father that's why God could trust
[2:18:08] him to me him the animals it was because
[2:18:11] God trusted his thinking now listen
[2:18:15] speak to Eve it was Adams responsibility
[2:18:19] to tell Eve what God had said it was
[2:18:23] while Adam was away the serpent came and
[2:18:27] we got Eve now watch this Adam is like
[2:18:31] his father Adam heard from God I don't
[2:18:35] know better yes it was the byproduct
[2:18:39] but the attribute in Adam sword and his
[2:18:43] wife had just been cut off and in that
[2:18:47] first story that we described as the
[2:18:49] fall we see the redemptive power of his
[2:18:52] father expressing Adam because Adam
[2:18:54] maker made a choice to cross over to get
[2:19:00] his wife that was love and God made a
[2:19:06] choice to preach eternity preached
[2:19:12] eternity
[2:19:13] and step over and step into time
[2:19:19] God took the choice to preach perfection
[2:19:22] and cross over so he can take on sin
[2:19:28] so you can feel what we feel so he can
[2:19:33] enjoy what we didn't have to do it but
[2:19:37] he made a choice the same way Adam made
[2:19:41] a choice they made the same choice for
[2:19:45] love
[2:19:46] [Applause]
[2:19:49] [Music]
[2:19:50] his thinking is not our thinking his
[2:19:54] ways I'm not always as he heavens are
[2:19:58] higher than the earth Joyce his ways and
[2:20:00] its thinkin higher than our ways what
[2:20:04] manner of love is this that core to call
[2:20:07] the prostitute that the world will
[2:20:10] reject what manner of love is this that
[2:20:13] he could come to the brokenhearted what
[2:20:16] manner of love is this take it come to
[2:20:19] the backslider and say come home come
[2:20:21] home come home forget your past forget
[2:20:24] your mistakes what manner of love is
[2:20:27] this that he could die and shed his
[2:20:29] blood and he can see once is under the
[2:20:32] blood I can't even pull it back out I
[2:20:35] can't even take back your mistakes can't
[2:20:38] even tell you what you did I don't even
[2:20:40] know what you did because it's it's
[2:20:43] under the blood
[2:20:46] if you could think of sorts then you
[2:20:49] would hear the words of Jeremiah I know
[2:20:51] the thoughts the plans I have for you

[2:22:57] ahem there'll be a power put into the
[2:22:59] church and now is coming in that the
[2:23:02] Holy Spirit was so annoying the people
[2:23:05] till nails the wood and it'll create
[2:23:09] itself right there we haven't seen
[2:23:12] powers like that coming to the church

[2:23:22] placing of the church in position where
[2:23:25] the fullness of the power of the Holy
[2:23:27] Ghost comes into the church then the
[2:23:29] critics will be shut in the spoken word
[2:23:36] is the original seed notice what harmony
[2:23:40] and this is your promise
[2:23:42] Jesus never did anything until seen of
[2:23:46] the father or the father showed him for
[2:23:47] this harmony between God and rice so
[2:23:50] will the bride he shows her his word and
[2:23:55] she receives it she never doubts it
[2:23:58] nothing can harm her not even depth for
[2:24:02] if the seed be planted the water will
[2:24:04] raise it up again
[2:24:05] now I got a great big hallelujah here's
[2:24:09] the secret the word is in the bride
[2:24:11] listen him and the mind of Christ to
[2:24:15] know what he once done with the woman
[2:24:17] and she does it in his name she has the
[2:24:21] Lord
[2:24:22] that's your promise what the mind of
[2:24:25] Christ you may be seated
[2:24:28] I'm gonna be finishing up soon
[2:24:30] but the Branham was a seer and he taught
[2:24:33] to that after the eyes there's no moving
[2:24:36] faculty but he beyond the eyes for the
[2:24:39] intelligence it's to know words thoughts
[2:24:42] of the matter would it be wonderful to
[2:24:46] know God's thoughts on your job God's
[2:24:51] thoughts and what time you should leave
[2:24:52] home in the morning record thoughts and
[2:24:55] on what to do when the day comes got
[2:24:57] thoughts on what to tell your husband
[2:24:59] wouldn't it be beautiful to know court
[2:25:01] sports and what to tell your wife in the
[2:25:03] right words for your children God's
[2:25:05] thoughts and why he took you true your
[2:25:08] trial to know God's fortune and why he
[2:25:11] led you this way to what a blessing is
[2:25:14] later to know God thoughts thinking his
[2:25:24] thoughts what a comfort in the midst of
[2:25:29] a trial because his thoughts was what
[2:25:32] comforted Joshua Joshua wasn't moved
[2:25:35] because he had the thoughts of God but
[2:25:38] Brandon was a move because he had the
[2:25:40] possible
[2:25:41] Moses was a move because he had the
[2:25:44] thoughts of God
[2:25:45] Elisha wasn't moved because at the paths
[2:25:48] of God
[2:25:52] [Music]
[2:25:54] total surrender my thoughts gone my
[2:25:59] feelings gone my Iman evil emotions and
[2:26:03] opinions God and say Lord I'm surrender
[2:26:07] to you I'm ready to surrender that's the
[2:26:11] first step you and the Holy Ghost
[2:26:13] surrender give up give up give up give
[2:26:16] up your thoughts give up your ideas you
[2:26:18] want your family back surrender say Lord
[2:26:22] I surrender I surrender today I
[2:26:25] surrender my all I surrender my life I
[2:26:28] surrender my my everything to you today
[2:26:31] but I want your thoughts every head
[2:26:39] bowed every eye closed
[2:26:47] but the random crowd to the church lord
[2:26:50] I haven't done enough Oh haven't done
[2:26:57] enough have you done enough
[2:27:07] have we done enough have you done enough
[2:27:11] have I done enough have we done enough
[2:27:16] because his thinking is what goes the
[2:27:19] extra mile
[2:27:21] his thinking gives the cloak to his
[2:27:28] thinking goes beyond human reasoning his
[2:27:32] thinking directed his disciples to go to
[2:27:35] the other side when he was exhausted his
[2:27:38] thinking and the disciples were so
[2:27:42] surrendered so obedient let me surrender
[2:27:45] to his thinking and it did what he
[2:27:48] instructed him to do Jonah heard the
[2:27:53] voice of God the thoughts of God he
[2:27:57] walked away from it only to find that he
[2:28:02] was right back to her God's thoughts and
[2:28:05] expressed of where he should be his
[2:28:09] attempts to do it his way field and our
[2:28:13] attempts to it our way will always fail
[2:28:17] because only God's thoughts expressed as
[2:28:20] the word is what will prevail friends am
[2:28:24] guilty of not doing enough I'm guilty of
[2:28:29] my own thoughts I'm guilty of my own
[2:28:32] feelings my own opinions my own
[2:28:34] perspectives I'm guilty this morning I'm
[2:28:38] repentant this morning I need to be more
[2:28:42] surrendered to his thinking I want to be
[2:28:44] more like him I want to be just like him
[2:28:47] I want his compassion on what his love
[2:28:52] he is merciful
[2:28:54] we are not he is holy we are not he is
[2:28:58] righteous we had not Oh God moving as
[2:29:06] hosts this morning he is the best friend
[2:29:13] I want to be the kind of friend that
[2:29:14] Jesus would be I want his feet
[2:29:23] I want his thoughts I want his thoughts
[2:29:27] and how I should dress I want his
[2:29:30] thoughts and where I should work and
[2:29:33] what his thoughts and I don't know what
[2:29:35] is he doing a Saturday morning I want
[2:29:37] his thoughts I would I should read I
[2:29:40] want his thoughts and who I should call
[2:29:42] in the fall and I want his thoughts the
[2:29:47] Bible says they had to see the Lord but
[2:29:50] they kept still it only did his will
[2:29:54] brother Branham said what kind of church
[2:29:56] what we have if we will such harmony
[2:30:01] Jesus Jesus had nothing unless the
[2:30:04] father showed him first
[2:30:06] I want to pray conscious of his thoughts
[2:30:12] then you will see changes in your life
[2:30:15] it'll change the way you look at your
[2:30:18] children it will change the way you look
[2:30:20] at your husband at your wife at the
[2:30:22] deacon at the usher and the pastor it'll
[2:30:25] change your thinking we look with our
[2:30:28] eyes too much our eyes would lie to us
[2:30:31] it's limited by our human reasoning our
[2:30:35] past our mistakes but the eyes of God
[2:30:39] from the thoughts of God the actions of
[2:30:42] God sees from from that book see is the
[2:30:48] possibility of you receiving the Holy
[2:30:50] Ghost he sees you victorious he sees you
[2:30:54] in a happy marriage he sees you
[2:30:56] successful he sees you as a
[2:30:58] advertisement born as whether Branham
[2:31:01] said to show the world in such a time of
[2:31:03] this we can have real Christians I don't
[2:31:08] care what the young people wear in your
[2:31:11] job on your school it doesn't matter
