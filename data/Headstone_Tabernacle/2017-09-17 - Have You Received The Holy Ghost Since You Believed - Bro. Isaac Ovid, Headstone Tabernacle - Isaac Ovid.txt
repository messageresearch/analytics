harmony Lord with the Holy Spirit we committed into your hands in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen I just want to read one scripture before you take your seats reading from proverbs chapter 4 and reading verse 23 proverbs chapter 4 our reading verse 23 proverbs 4:23 keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life middle order the blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated I just want to share something before I actually get to the message this morning I greet you this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ it's certainly a great privilege and an honor to be in the house of the Lord we do want to welcome me lien Marcel to the handsome Tabernacle this morning myself god bless you invited by brother Jabari and Sophia's Samuel welcome to headstones have enacted this morning amen so this morning brother Ovid is actually preaching in Guyana he went with with a George tangley but the Tarrant some of the Hugh Williams or they're having a time over there so he'll be back with us tomorrow they they come back home so God is moving and this weekend now be heading over to South Africa to do one to speak at a youth convention over there and next weekend I'll be speaking in Germany and protocool imranís church so keep us in prayer and God will continue to anoint and bless and keep things in perfect order and control amen so yesterday we had a tremendous you service how many appreciated you service yesterday for those who were here Amen I certainly want to thank all young people who made the effort to come out and for the kaleb's who were here as well and for those who could not be here yesterday I trust you have a good you know the BIOS is about giving an account I trust you'll be able to give an account to the Lord for why you were not here yesterday and it's coming to that kind of a time people don't want to be held accountable but the Bible says you have to give an account you know in the natural when you're not in work and you're not there for a day or two you're supposed to walk with a sick leave signed by a doctor to really make sure you're ready the truth is unfortunate that the nature of human behavior has forced measures like that and for some reason people think that church and the kingdom of God operates by a different set of rules and in fact we operate by a higher order a higher set of rules so I said young people yesterday that we are ramping things up and we took our inspiration and maybe I'll just touch it quickly on what the theme of our youth services for the remaining year and if IDs see for the foreseeable future will be promised on 2nd Peter 1 you don't have to find it where Simon Peter is speaking and he says Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ so he's addressing a certain kind of people not every and anybody but there might have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness unto life and godliness and we were speaking to the young people of that balance between life and godliness months ago we had a theme where the young people speaking about between Sunday's where we come to service on a Sunday but there's Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday and God is interested in not just your attendance in church and what happens in a Sunday or Wednesday or prayer meeting all your service but he's interested in every area of your life he's interested in what happens between Sunday's but the Apostle Peter is saying that according as his divine power had given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness so God doesn't just want to see you spiritually bless them and spiritually as an overcomer but in life also you ought to have a testimony you cannot be as depressed as those in the world because depression is not your inheritance if your testimony is that you are depressed as those in the world there's something wrong because we have been given all things but healing on support godliness and to live life on this earth until we are taken from him we ought to be happy whether it's in our job or in the church or on the street all things but in the light and godliness has been given to us the rules of business can be found in the scripture the rules of success can be found in the scripture because in this has everything but in it a life and to godliness can the church Shaymin we have for too long been living on our god-given privilege both in the natural and in the spiritual and it's the time has come for us to take our position in God can the church see amen but we went even deeper than that yesterday and we took a scripture that I just read in proverbs 4 and verse 23 to keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life and if you talk to anybody they tell you I have issues who doesn't have issues everybody has some issue that I deal o it being a financial issue a mental issue a challenge a child issuer a job-related issuer issue it with waking up late in the morning an issue and with not eating the right things that all kinds of issues but the Bible says guard your heart or keep your heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life and we see the young people the heart is a ground and the heart as a ground doesn't discriminate with what seed you plant the role of the heart of the ground is to bring to life whatever seed is there so whatever seed you plant in your heart you're harder to say I don't want the seed the hearts job is to bring the sea to life but yet the Bible says guard your heart keep your heart protect your heart because out of your heart stems the issues of life every issue of life is coming from what's inside of your heart so I asked young people a question if you have a feel and in that feel you plant and that feel is a good feeling whatever you plant it grows up and blossom wouldn't you want to protect that field would you want to guard that field so what would you do you put a fence right now but I said to the young people if you put a fence all the way around how will you get to the pit how will you get to the field you have to create a kit and it's the same way there's a gate to your heart so if you have to guard your heart you have to mine what passes through that gate so I asked young people what other get to the heart what's the access way to the heart what allows things to go into your heart and we hear the statements the eyes are the windows to the soul and what you see is what goes into your heart what you listen to is what feeds your heart what you see T is touch expressed that is what affects your heart again your heart doesn't discriminate but what see this book it will only bring to life what you put in your heart so if you take in seeds that lead to jealousy both of your heart will come issues that are tied to jealousy if you listen to worldly music then the issues begin to change because this is not just don't listen to worldly music but music is a seed that when it comes onto that ground of your heart will bring forth something what you look at in the newspaper if you watch a TV show whatever it is you allowed to pass through that get the Hat receives it because the heart is just a ground and everything is gonna bring forth after its kind so I challenge young people and I challenge the church this morning to guard your heart with all diligence with everything that's within you because out of that heart comes the issues of life everything that is expressed can be traced to a beginning everything that happens has of course is a seed where it all began and if you find yourself out of the spirit doing what you're not supposed to be doing you can come back to the seed where it all started they say that a butterfly can flap its wings somewhere in Africa or wherever and it starts a hurricane because it's cause and effect and I believe it's where the Gideon was seeing in a youth service that our plane it could be one degree off but by the time it dry it flies for an hour - it's so far another continent so it's a small thing that you have to guard your heart against can the church say man so just for a few minutes I want to talk about this God in your heart and I introduced a story that I read to the young people and it really blessed me and I pray that it will bless you as well and there was a flight I believe somewhere in Europe and the Christian businessman was on the flight and he was in first class and as he got into the first-class cabin the air hostess offered him a drink complimentary drink an alcoholic drink and he politely refused he said no I am NOT interested as he moves towards his seat a hostess goes to the manager and says this guy doesn't want to drink maybe we didn't present it right so she comes back and brings a drink now on a platter and says sir it's it's a public man she drink you're flying for this class for this class's expensive seating this is coming you don't have to pay for it it it's on the house he says no I am NOT interested in the drink she goes back against in a manager the manager says send it back one more time and they bring it back now with flowers on the platter because they're thinking that it's their problem and the way they are presenting it as why is refusing it them the manager comes and he says to her listen I am NOT interested in this drink because I'm a Christian and I don't drink alcohol so the hostess couldn't understand it he says yes what before I take it if you want me to take it give this drink first study pilot and the air hostess responded how I could do that he's on duty if he drinks he will kick a crash the plane and that man sturdy I say exactly right he's on duty and I'm also on duty I'm on duty for the kingdom of God and if I drink that I will crash my life and I took a team of young people always on duty because as Christians we have to be always of duty there is no vacation from this Christian thing there is no time off from this Christian thing there's not taking a day off I come in and lead on this Christian thing we are always on duty we are duty on Monday on Tuesday on Saturday on something on every day we are always on duty and the church say man Joshua's on duty was in that right he was there sharpening and sword if he was housekeeping I was in duty when he injured a captain the Lord was come he was going to be ready but it moment he heard a noise he tried sword first ask questions after because he was on duty he was taking chances and that's why you gotta guard your heart because you have to always be on duty because out of your heart comes the issues of life can the church say men the issues of life guard your heart the issues of life lost and fornication and these issues of life are directly connected the seeds that you saw when you lose the desire to come to the house of God it's because a seed has been planted that takes away that desire something else is more important where is your job when it's put the perception of success or whatever it is it's other sees that are taking hold of your heart and they will grow because that's what the heart is supposed so I challenge you Church be conscious that you are always on duty I give the analogy that there are many professions police officers soldiers doctors who are on-call and when you are on call as a doctor it simply means that even if you are not on location they can call you at any time to respond to her situation and that's how you ought to be as a Christian it can be you're trying to get into the spirit it must be that you are in the spirit it can be I listen they call you money let me pray first no you are supposed to be prayed up that's what it means to be on duty the song leader should not to say get in the spirit now because you are on duty you are walking in the spirit because you are on duty you are you are the revival because you're on duty if nobody else wanna shout you are Sultan because your relationship is with God it has nothing to do it who's next to you what happened this morning what happened last night what it does not matter because you are duty he can call you at any time a situation happens you just say let us pray you have to wonder if you're pregnant again answer because you know your heart is right with God because you are always on duty that's why in the army they have soldiers training all the time so that when the war comes you know there's some Swiss who never go to war but you know what it doesn't stop the training going on because they need to be ready just in case they have to go and fight the crappity last time I pushed I was five years ago you gotta call this month you gotta fight you know try to do one push-up two push-ups treat it's not gonna work but you have to be always on duty so that no matter what unity comes with you could take care of it can the church say Amen so young people and the church mark your calendars October the 21st will be our next youth service and it is a youth oriented service the entire church is welcomed and I said to the young people we have a responsibility that you have to be ready according to scripture to give an answer so what is the hope of your calling it can be somebody asked why you are just way why are you a Christian and you tell them come to church and find out no you supposed to be the give an answer that's what the Bible says be ready to give an answer and that word answer in the Greek is the word apologia which means a reason defense which means you're not just food to say well I love God it mean you need to be able to explain what happened to you that my life was changed and I met somebody I never my-my-my amnesia was lifted I was chatting everybody when I realized I was a Eagle among chickens I when I got the eagle - eagle call something's telling my soul I can't put it all into a bullet but if you can hear the excitement I have my updates and openness but one of these things not always me up because I'm going to a place where there are no updates have no foundation I'm going to a place where there's no sickness have no depression I'm I'm going to a place where whenever I speak something has got to happen and the good news is before that time comes when I speak here is gonna happen because that's my promise and my family might be in trouble but I'm not worried about it because it's a power coming into the church when one sons fell so to speak and what this she will be created that's what we are talking about a judgement power a judgment glory a charge when he anointed a church on fire for God within these videos who are not afraid to separate themselves from the world there are no more excuses no more excuses you may be seated I'm not preaching it we're gonna get to the service in a minute I was saying to the young people the world is changing in this very own country of ours for years the energy sector and oil and gas was the mainstay of the economy but that was before electric cars that was before solar panels became more common that was before wind power and alternative energy started to become more popular and as man progresses they will find new and innovative we used to do things and in me that the jobs that you could have had years ago with no longer a pie in the new world the one constant that his will has is change so there's no reason to be sad or sorry for yourself because the successful people in the future will be those who have adapted to the changes who haven't adapted to what's happening and with the pranam he bridge he said there was the horse and buggy day he didn't miss anything there was the cows then he said it was the aeroplanes anything it was the rocket he's here man is making progress but he said the churches was a laid-back understeer with the old thing and not make any spiritual progress when we ought to be way of the road we ought to have spiritual astronauts there are scientists who can mix the chemicals together to create the right reaction because when you mix certain things together certain things begin to happen you can sit down in the church and hope somebody mix for you you better get a mixin the chemicals for your house you better get some mixing or you don't hear me this morning it's time to get up and get it's time because the Bible says the kingdom suffered violence and the violent take it by force [Applause] you may be seated I'm gonna preach in a minute but I want to get something to you there's no revival without sacrifice there is no victory without sacrifice the same way in the natural is the same thing in the spiritual listen the pastor gave us a book to read things that are to be and in that message if you listen to it but the Branham was saying that everything on it is a shadow it's a type of what exists somewhere else he said so if there's a tree that struggling on earth it means that there's somewhere else there's a tree that's not struggling he said if there's a man shake or Nestle it means that somewhere else there's no man that's not struggling there's a man that's not shake oh can I get a witness in the houses swooning do we have any believers in the house do we have any Christians in the house so to have any reward he has got to be sacrificed you may be seated [Applause] we spoke about the random piece about spiritual amnesia how the god of this evil age tries to keep us and for us to forget where we come from to forget our identity to forget that our genes come from God and even gonna keep us thinking about our problems our trials our mortgage the bills the back pain you know this is I'm gonna pee and get too much you forget yourself to do because it being takes you that's the devil's job to bring healing to bring frustration to bring depression but when you come to church it's to remind you by bringing it to a familiar place a familiar atmosphere a familiar anointing to let you know that this is what you were doing before you had a problem before you had a mortgage before you were sick this is what you were doing you were worshiping you were giving God praise you were giving God glory [Applause] you may be seated we're still having a conversation so I share with young people I said listen there is no achievement without sacrifice there is nobody nobody in the natural and in spiritual is the same law without sacrifice there is no achievement without sacrifice there is no blessing without prayer without science without fasting without crying without denying your Salva without giving up something that's what that seem to get if you want to achieve in your school you must sacrifice you're gonna give up something and spend time studying and spend time practicing to the when the exam comes up you are prepared and ready to destroy the exam that's what you got to do certain young people they are too powerful beings that get the blame for everything the devil gets the most blame because of the devil who did it and then there are those who blame God is he didn't do it so it's the devil who made me cuss em out and God and stop me from cousin and you fear to accept responsibility that you have a choice what you eat for breakfast is a choice what time you go to bed is a choice how long you pray is a choice so I said to the church if you want to lose weight you can have an all-night for a meeting about losing weight if you don't change your diet if you don't add some exercise what do you want God to do you don't want to study to pass your exams what you want to pray for God to do but it's a difference when you study and you see an Lord bring back to my memory everything that I studied because I'm a child of the king that's a different kind of Prayer so when you hear the old-fashioned Christian scene whenever I pray God answered my prayer is they understood the relationship between what God does what he has done what he will do and what you have to do so can't have said if God is with me I am more than able to drive out the fellows time even say God can you please remove remove the child's no he said the Lord is with me I will be able to drag him out myself to overcome to make it sound wants to take on the enemy in my life I'm called to take all the enemies in my family blasphemy in my house we will serve the Lord this is God's house up this is his temple this is his temple I'm gonna guard this house and the church hey man we need some more aggressive Christians we have a too easy we are too comfortable we have become too lazy I was seeing a train in China and when the train came to a stop wow if you saw the rush to get into the train if you are laid-back and you are waiting for somebody to usher you to the Train huh you will be there next morning with him for a dream ah it was an example of suffering violence and the violent take it by force women children men businessman labor oh it didn't matter Azealia one to get on board or you don't want to get on board there was a picture and I saw the train door closing and chest before the train or close a man snitching and the door just be ere it goes when he purposed in his heart I'm catching aboard this train I'm going to get home if it reminds you that a woman with the issue of blood if I could just touch the hem of his comment I'm gonna be me and a hole give me some more Christians who wants a press pass a person in front of you I'll get Piero one the blessing that's up to them but Jesus is in the house he is in the house I didn't even touch the hem of His garment you could vote but that means it what kind of message is this this morning this is the kind of message to remind you that the preacher cannot bring the revival it's the concept of this preacher bringing the revival and the preacher doing it all that created a papal system of existence remove the power from the people and put it on bishops and Archbishop's and super bishops and until there's a pope but quarter in the veil when Jesus died from top to bottom to give individuals direct access to the throne room of God to make their petitions loon and that's why the Bible can see you have not because you ask not and if you are still coming to church and I'm asking then you are wasting time but when you come to the house of God it's to remind you that you're the power to ask because when God looks at you he looks to the blood and the blood covers your sins the blood covers your mistakes of blood covers your dinners and the blood is speaking better things that you can see yourself Hamlet should see me you love Lord this morning then let's all stand offish if you have your Bibles will you turn it me to two portions of scripture reading from Matthew chapter 24 Mary from Acts chapter 19 Matthew 24 verse 40 then shall two be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left two women shall be grinding at the mill the one shall be taken and the other left what's therefore for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come but know this that if the Goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour as you think not the Son of man cometh and really from Acts chapter 19 reading from this one and it came to pass and while Apollo's was a Corinth Paul having passed through the upper coast came to Ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them how he received the Holy Ghost since he believes and he said unto Him we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost and he said it to them unto what then we baptized and he said unto John's baptism then said paul john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on christ jesus when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus and when paul had laid his hands upon them the Holy Ghost came on them and they speak with tongues and prophesied made a lord at a blessing to the reading of his word he may be seated so for a title this morning have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and for a subject desperate to possess your individual inheritance and an inspiration another book of Acts so this morning we want to really hole into individuals hone into your Christian walk your Christian journey and to what you have to be expecting and what you ought to be preparing before you know but the Branum he gave an analogy he said I believe it was a turtle and he said he took a stick and tried to prod the turtle the turtle didn't move he threw something else in a turtle he didn't respond he said it's only when he took some fire and put it to the turtle the turtle legs flew out and he's had to move at his fastest speed because that is what fire does it gets you moving and it is the nature of human beings who try to get comfortable where you move to a different country moved a different neighborhood he moves a different job in whatever position you I am it's your nature to get comfortable but within the context of your spiritual journey there is no such thing as as staying comfortable you have to stay moving because you have an enemy a real enemy and this war where fighting is not a war against flesh or blood is on a war against your wife or your husband or your children or your boss so it has nothing to do with that is a spiritual war because you are under a different covenant what happens out there in the world is different from what you will experience because you are under a different covenant you are here to be tested and for a proving ground that you are not going to be the see that no matter what temptation or trial comes your way you will have a testimony that you will serve God you're not here to be a church member you're not here to be in the message you are here to have a testimony to show the world to show your family that you will serve the Lord that he is your king that is your majesty that he is your leader he is your guy he is your joy he is your peace you you look to him to keep you going you look to him to wake you up in the morning when the doctor runs out of ideas about what's wrong with you you know he knows because he made you he is your Creator he is the Great Physician he is your Chiron and that is what keeps you inspired it's all about him the moment your Christian journey loses him as your focus there's something wrong there many people Church is a ritual it's it's it's amazing it's a casual it's a thing to do it's on your to-do list so there's certain son need and I have to compete bill on Monday and have to deliver this report on Tuesday it's a thing to do it has become casual to us instead of it being the very source of our existence that is Kingdom that we come from it's a different world it's a it's a different place it's a different life it's a different law and that Kingdom is what we are fighting to press into and the Kingdom suffered violence and the violent take it by force with all of our efforts um but always talk about at last we you could take a pig and put a bow tie on the pig with a three-piece suit on the pig put perfume on the pier you could put the pig in a limousine and drive it as destination the moment it comes out of the control environment it will go back to what it used to do because that's the nature of the pink and that's the nature of every man that's born and sin and shift in iniquity and the babbles it all have come short but until your nature is changed you'll go back to your always until there's something change in your heart you go back to your old ways and the preaching of the gospel is to prepare you for an encounter with the pillar of fire the disciples they walk with Jesus they talk with Jesus they saw miracles if it was any group of people who should have not backslidden was the disciples think about it think about being with Jesus by the scene and you're there on the boat and the storm comes and Jesus is sleeping and you're scared and he just wings myself peace be still wouldn't you be persuaded of what this Jesus is talking about you're hungry and he takes five loaves and two fishes and feeds thousands of people wouldn't that persuade you of this man's ministry when Jesus stood outside of the grave of Lazarus and say Lazarus come forth how much more examples who you need before you were convinced that this ministry is right but yet still when Jesus died what did these disciples do they went back to fishing they went back to what they used to do they went back to their old ways for three and a half years as it will they had listened to the greatest preacher who would ever preach they listened to the greatest teacher who would ever teach then listen to God Himself Vail and sixteen elements and after his three and a half year ministry when Jesus died these disciples went back fishing so don't be surprised when people stand in church for years and you can't understand how is it they somehow find themselves fishing they find themselves just there they find themselves no joy no see you know enthusiasm they find themselves they're just in church or maybe not even in church or coming to church when they want to come to church or brain when they think they should pray or when is an emergency because this is how the disciples found themselves until Jesus rose from the dead and breathed upon them receiving the Holy Ghost and in his resurrection ministry he opened their understanding to the scriptures and he pleased them of our promise but even while they were under the promise the Bible said they were afraid and they hid in the upper room but something happened in their lives when the Holy Ghost came one day the Bible says it was a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled the whole house where they were settling and cloven tongues of fire divided itself and he went upon each one and they walk out that room without him and Peter said this is that which was spoken by the Prophet Joel he said these men are drunk as you suppose but this is that and when the Holy Ghost came upon Peter all of his fear was gone his condition was gone all of his backsliding was gone what was it it was the holy ghost itself it was not a book it was not a message it was the Holy Ghost itself a portion of God had tabernacled himself inside of these men and that is what we need that's what we needed here this morning for the ruling us it selves tabernacle in each one of us and that's my burden this morning because if you are if you don't know that's what you are supposed to expect or prepare for you are not being preparation for it but those disciples they went into the upper room under the promise receive ye the Holy Ghost so they were there getting ready they were there making preparations they were there and they had separated themselves from the world The Situation's had it now existed that forced them into that place where they couldn't go out when it couldn't worry about what out there because the Romans were we're looking for them but why they were there cord meant them and friends is that easy when you have to stand alone most of us we we want to be part of something but those disciples had to stand alone away from family away from friends and among others who had the same motivation others who had to seem desire others who wanted a core to the same place and that's what has to happen to each of you you must be prepared to separate from everything that will take you away from your spiritual destination friends we have to get desperate to receive the Holy Ghost it's not just believing because when Paul and acts 19 met some believers he asked them the question have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe the question is that if you are believer the question is that if you have the books and if you have the tapes and if you know the message the question is have you receive the Holy Ghost since you believed and if you have not received the Holy Ghost there ought to be a desperation in your soul day and night morning and evening day and night morning and evening Lord I need this because the Holy Ghost is eternal life the Holy Ghost is power the Holy Ghost is your inheritance the Holy Ghost is the token that God wants to look at can the church see man the Holy Ghost will put in the sneak out of your heart the Holy Ghost will Tico's desires that you're struggling with because you can try to bring your body under subjection and and there's a lot you can do as a human and a Romanichal child with your choices but it's a whole different thing when the Holy Ghost takes complete control and takes control of your elements takes control of your eyes takes control of your ears where you only go where he wants you to go it's no longer you choosing not to tuber you have gone past that stage you have already chosen and as we're over these last week because thou has done this thing then the Holy Ghost has the full authority to take his place in your heart and lead you to where you don't even want to go take it away didn't want to go because it's a Holy Ghost its power the Holy Ghost will change where you walk it'll change the way you talk it will change the way you worship it will change the way you break it'll change the way you love it'll change what you eat it'll change where you go it'll make you a Christian it'll make you testify it'll make you talk different it'll make you walk different in kind you he is your comforter that's what the Holy Ghost is he is your guide he will take you to your school he will take you to your charmer he will comfort you and nobody else that's what the Holy Ghost gives you fought it gives you power it gives you power to press up it gives you power to break free that's what we need [Applause] hallelujah that's what we need the Holy Ghost its power when the Holy Ghost comes upon you you no longer yourself when the Holy Ghost comes upon you they thought that it was pizza and they were talking to but the Holy Ghost had Tabernacle himself in the book of Acts up on the throne of Peters heart a bit peter was no longer in control Peter couldn't stop the Holy Ghost when the Holy Ghost has the preeminence huh he does what he wants to do and that's called strategy he wants individuals a very good place the Holy Ghost in and shake the world like he did on the day of Pentecost come on young people is there anybody wants the Holy Ghost is anybody needs the Holy Ghost that's what this service is about this morning it's a Holy Ghost service halleluyah halleluyah that's your promise that's your promise don't you know your party is a temple of the Holy Ghost the reason you were born the reason you were born is to be a tabernacle that the Holy Ghost can step in the Holy Ghost doesn't want to fill this building he wants to fill this temple he doesn't want to be tied down tough physical location the Holy Ghost wants to move wherever he wants to go the Holy Ghost wants a moving part of speed the holy was once a moving ARIMA the Holy Ghost wants to move into your family's house of how will he move you move inside of you he needs some hands he needs some eyes he needs somebody who would surrender and say Lord Here I am send me take over I surrender I give up I'm no more myself I'll try my way but this morning Lord if you could use anything Lord you could use me Oh hallelujah I pray you break free this morning I pray you break out of yourself this morning unless you get up.get unless you get the Holy Ghost you're not gonna make it you can come to church for 10 years for 20 years for 30 years that's what the Pentecostals do that's what the Baptist's do that's what the method is do there's no difference of attendance it's not a measure of your walk with God how much you read them it's not the measure of your walk with God but the measure that you have crossed over is when the Holy Ghost comes upon you he talked he graduated on the day of Pentecost he didn't graduate when he walked on the water he graduated when the Holy Ghost came down in his soul hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah shake yourself this morning shake pass your religious spirit this morning without the Holy Ghost you're not gonna make it because the God said when I see the blood I'll pass over you he told Moses take the blood of apply it on the doorpost let that be your identification but that under strain because the token must be displayed of the holiness must be displayed that's what the devil hates him he eats the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is power [Applause] Oh hallelujah Oh somebody give him praise this morning somebody give him glory this morning Oh somebody get test break this morning I don't know what's gonna happen this morning but I ever better put a sign on the crying you have got to be bothered by what's taking place in the world you have got to be troubled that's why the Bible says to put a mark upon those that sigh and cry for the abomination we have gotten too comfortable the abomination doesn't bother us anymore the abomination isn't effect us anymore we tolerate the foolishness but for the pranam said God cannot build his church on a bunch of nonsense it's either we are gonna have church or no church at all but we are going to have a church without spot without wrinkle we're gonna have a clean Church whatever Holy Ghost filled Church if you don't have a church let the sick cannot stay sick that demon powers cannot come into the church hallelujah the house of hell will have to give way to the name of Jesus I don't care what's wrong with your life right now it doesn't matter the only thing that's important is the Holy Ghost shake yourself forget about your pills forget about the problems get up forget about it the Holy Ghost gives you power to take over every attack of the enemy you are born to be sons and daughters of the Living God worship is what we do praise is what we do overcome is what we keep what EE talking about have you on the ropes yes power in your little finger that's what would a Branham said yes power the pushback sickness [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah for too long we have satin allow the devil to invade our homes yes morning I say enough is enough where the father's in the house of will take back their homes up and see as for me and my house we will serve the Lord where the prayin bombers who will take back their place in the wholesome as they asked of me and my house we will serve the Lord it's time to light a fire inside a church it's time to light a fire inside your homes [Applause] you maybe see that we're gonna make this place uncomfortable uncomfortable for people who don't want to be Christians there are other churches to go to this mist will be uncomfortable to people who don't really one God but their Branham said in every church there are three kinds of believers they are make believers they are unbelievers and they are true believers we can't kick out a makeunder I know and the unbeliever because some of them they are good actors but what we can do is make the church so uncomfortable that I make believers be like this is not for me anymore and the unbelievers this is not me anymore you're preaching too hard depression too rough you pretend to talk summer you are too lazy too lazy ask questions how do you want God to bless you and you don't wanna sacrifice when Davis and we bring a sacrifice of praise into the house of God what does that mean it's a sacrifice it's when you don't see like praising when things are going wrong when you're tired in your body where you're sick all over but yet still you bring a sacrifice and you operate your God and say Lord I'm broken I'm tired I'm wearing but I want to praise you [Applause] hallelujah get out your flesh get out your laziness get out your carnality if you know anything past repent make it right with God and get entire for God he is zealous him yesterday he has tells us in 30 he has tell us him forever [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] somebody's gonna break feet today somebody wanna break free some we're gonna break free today and light a fire not only here but when you go back to your hole light up I'll light a fire in your house like a fire in your cup throw those music things out that not supposed to be there Troy it out just don't even wonder and I just ran out [Applause] God your heart because the Holy Ghost wants to go there got it [Applause] got it protected the enemy wants to be there but we're not gonna let him be there because as a seed of predestination that was planted in your soul before there was a world you cannot feel you are not even the believer but the Pharaoh said you were not even a believer but the world in you you didn't put it there oh he made it that you can't even miss this he made it that no matter what you did you couldn't miss this appointment the devil couldn't see when he did it but he dropped a seed a hidden seed inside of your soul and every sheep has got to bring forth after its time it just needs the right atmosphere so let's create the atmosphere oh because in the right atmosphere Satan gets mad he's upset this morning he's upset you in the house of God II wish you stayed home this morning but you made it to the house of God and because you are here he's in trouble he's in trouble he's in trouble you broke past the barrier when you woke up this morning something that all of you well somebody help me preach this morning somebody help me please just small it you didn't even wake up yourself you might not struggle to get into the car you struggle to get your clothes you struggle up your order you will feel an oral adjuster but the teller he knew something was gonna happen that's why it was a struggle even wasn't a struggle there's no blessing but if there was a struggle you're gonna shout of praise because the devil is finished you are pressed fast like the lily you grasp last and you are here and because you are here and God is here something has got to happen [Applause] pulling us fire warning was power pulling us fire holy was power give me the old-time religion give me the all-time preacher [Applause] but overt said if you don't feed for yourself we have fate for you if you don't even but thing you're gonna make it you gonna make it the table has no power go with a branch settle down it's a bluff that pain in your body it's a bluff the condition of your children is a bluff the problems in your marriage is a bluff your financial problems is a bluff the devil has no power [Applause] may your spiritual minds open up that you were represented when Lucifer cut his angels and try to do a cool event Michael through his soul and there were some angels some sons of God some morning stars who fought with Michael these angelic spirits there that presented us these angelic beings represented us so fighting in the spiritual realm is not foreign to us it is what we do and that's why God let see whatever you in heaven knows you can handle it because you are attribute sons of the Spirit [Applause] so this morning you may be silly we serve notice to every female condition we serve notice to writers we serve notice to hyper measure we serve notice below blood pressure we serve notice to the pine eyes we serve notice after the feeble knees we serve notice to every condition heart condition kidney condition whatever it is every physical condition but the Branham taught us those are spirits those are demons spirits and demons we are equipped to take them on because there's power in the Church of the Living God all that God was important to Christ all that Christ was he poor little Church there's power yet city to class out Devils you may be seated we serve notice just the spirit of lust this morning we serve notice to the spirit of fornication against adultery against drinking against smoking against pornography against every unclean thing we are serving notice to let the devil know and we are counting down to time bein up when he has to evacuate this is not an eviction is that evacuation is that give people time evacuation is a move faster may I Zack you ate in the devil this morning from this church we are serving a notice Satan are different storm is coming this is our strong it's a spiritual strong [Applause] you're cheering a comment back yes yes yes your son is coming back yes your daughter is coming back yes your husband coming back yes your wife coming back yes your brother yes your sister yes say it clearly believe it rejoice about it it's got to happen Plus say at the Lord [Applause] [Applause] jesus said to Peter the devil has desired to sift you like wheat in that day sifting of the wheat was not done through the strainer that we have now the sifting as a wheat but the Anthony was they would have these almost four sticks as it were we'd almost like a cloth between a huge it wasn't like one person job but they would throw it up and throw it up so when Jesus telling this to Peter Peter noticeably would be concerned because the devil wants to sift you like me through your life up and down and side-to-side and you don't know where your foot is is not the way he said he said but that your feet feel not [Music] listen he didn't say you wouldn't be sifted you said that definitely is either shifty he didn't go into how and when and how long if just do what happen but he said listen no matter what you go to app prayed for you that true all of what you have to go through your feet but feel not because if you keep your feet see this one will keep you going if you hold on to this word and its promise no matter if you're up you're down you're upside down just keep your feet come the church same you may be seated I pray that today your spiritual eyes will open up and the amnesia that you have been suffering because some of you really have to have forgotten who you are to do some of the things that he wanted to but as you come to a greater realization of who you are in God it should give you a confidence to tell the devil know it sounds very simple but it's in these day-to-day victories that we win the war you are the sum total of every decision you make years ago we didn't have as much lifestyle diseases as we have known but we have evolved now we have young children addicted to soft drink and addicted to juice and processed sugars and different things and diseases like obesity and all these things these it will happen overnight you don't drink one soft drink and suddenly you obese it doesn't happen it's a process it is a process you drink a coke every single day there's an effect of that and then people want to lose it in five days and it took five years to reach there and then you have these phenomenal programs lucid in 10 days Lucilla five identities and mathematically it doesn't make sense because it was one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus one plus two plus five plus three soft wings at the end and your spiritual maturity is won by simple victories every single day the question was asked to the Prophet how do you grow how do you grow as a christian and the answer has always been very simple read your Bible and pray every day with a signal in Sunday school and that's why I said youth oriented service is not just for young people because we have quote-unquote killers who have stopped growing because they don't longer read their Bibles and pray every day they have they have graduated to seemingly when God told Joshua meditate on the word day and night so you will have good success and you want to know why you're struggling and why things not working out and why I can't get a financial breakthrough and why life is so hard and why I strongly encourages the happiest waited I'm just waitin because the word teachers God never leaves us we are the ones who leave him number the Branham said if you ever want to get back to God walk right back to the place where you left him he'll be standing right there because he is not his nature to leave you it is needed to follow us this is why remember the branham's book of when Adam fell he said it wasn't Adam when looking for God it was God when looking for Adam Adam Adam and we used to fellowshipping where are you where are you Adam and Adam was out of his position is God's nature to come after us it is God's nature to reconcile with us and that's my brother Brennan said God wants to give you the Holy Ghost more than you even want to receive it God doesn't want to withhold the whole equals from us he wants to give it to us the Prophet said more and we even want to receive it but friends a holy God cannot come and live where there is darkness and by the Branum satellite as he said before court could fill you you have to empty yourself and for some of us it's saw was a so spiritual we have full up of our own spiritual self so different things we need to empty all of today there those work the empty out sin and the world and that's why sometimes and that's why but the Browns I know people who have come to his meetings sinners prostitute on the street and get healed because they didn't have no preconception they were not fact-checking and they were not no they just came in humble sincere they believed and they were healed and people who sat in church for years they will fill up up themselves you know how many scriptures I know how many books I've read how many oh let's pray meeting I've been in and they feel to realize that God is still simple God who is looking for surrender and feet from individuals who are sold out so some of us we have to empty out of our pride lust whatever it is our own we own I know some of us that until our good self I'm always in church I never miss a service if you not see me here my name duty hmm something wrong the road Brooke and the gap was so big I couldn't jump over because it was just a simple brick I would have jump over and still be every night today good self but God is not measuring people on works and on your effort less that you boast that is you because he wants all the glory at the end of the day that the headstone will come with Shelton's crying grace grace grace grace because we are all filled as the begin with we all me there's nobody here but I'm not better than anybody and he was what I want to be worse please I don't want to be better than anybody else because I know it's a grace of God to my life if he didn't pick me up and tell him I left all wrong I don't know where I'd be I could get no credit for what you see here this woman it's the grace of God and that is what every testimony should be it's a grace of Almighty God I was lost I was a sinner I was no good but caught rich and grace and mercy pick me up turn me around send our prophet put a message that I wouldn't be a Pentecostal or this religious but tell me there's a way back I went back to Eden or we're back to we shall reign on the earth I went back to spoken would a wave back to the original seed that's what his prophets brought oh we ought to be rejoicing oh we ought to be so happy all we want to be so grateful [Applause] and I'll see it again friends this is not about rules it not to say message things that are to be our homework but the Brandon was saying when he leaves his house to wonder field he doesn't sit and his wife and say while I'm gone don't have any other husband anybody listen anybody remember the part all right after I said she doesn't say bill while you're gone do happy need a wife and I better Brandon goes on to say but what if something happens in the field he said I come back and look at those wrinkles and those gray hair and say would you forgive me he said but as he looks at her he said it'll hurt him so much he'd rather die than have to even do that so because of his love for her he will never want to do anything to hurt her and that's what real love is listen for yourself that's your homework things that ought to be that's your message and I say to young people all the time but it's church have real rules and that's what I say yeah real rules you can't do this you can't do that you can do that you can do this you do this and is it and I say it's not about rules it's about love because if you love God then it would be in your nature to only do things to please him then all of a sudden it's no longer rules its he doesn't like this he likes he doesn't like this like this and then all of a sudden your life becomes easy so as a Christian sister he likes it in my hair is combed out why would I want to cut it he doesn't like it as he likes it when I trust modestly that's what I'm his queen it's love I said to the two some time ago my wife likes whites close in one side colors are the next side the liberal is our rules in my house after pretty white clothes in one corner pretty colors and he makes color but because I love her after finally with the pudding I close it I'm pretty colors here because it easier to wash but that's what love does your behavior you are just to behavior when your love [Applause] I remember one time me this language and she toasted the bread and she thought that she was doing a good job of twisting the bread with tuna and I said listen I don't like the bread toasted with tuna leave the bread with Oh to sling it now when she toasted that she thought it was the best thing to do if she didn't toasted to get me upset but she thought I would have walked but she didn't know so within this Christian journey there are things that you men do that you don't know if it working just yet but that's what the word comes for I don't want that twisting I don't want to just like just a little bit gestures and the Holy Spirit is your guide he will guide you along this journey as you get deeper and deeper in love you begin to become one so you see certain couples just to move the I didn't know what to do without words being said without words no communication but it's a connection and you read there were men a few words there when he spoke when he wanted them to speak but apparently that was one nun didn't know what to do is this seem to be preaching about that's that's the message but one not you know what God's answer to because you are so connected you on the same wavelength his words your words his thoughts your thoughts his behavior your behavior his nature your nature his being you're being his attributes your what are you flesh of my flesh bone of my bone spirit of my spirit bride and groom husband and wife mrs. Jesus Christ and the Lord Jesus Christ bride of Jesus Christ and the church semen [Applause] but that type of relationship with God cannot be intellectual it has to be hot it has to be the same spirit it cannot be your spirit that's why the Bible says I'll give you a new heart I'll give you a new spirit and then I'll put my spirit in there because when you have his spirit now you could communicate know you could really know you could talk the same language don't you want to talk the same language with him don't you want to become a deeper Christian with him how many love him this morning wonderful so I'm going to assume that if you love him you will want to do things to please him so how many people this morning want to do everything to please him [Music] [Music] because they are many gurus say they love Illinois ivy Pentecostal people watch them they declaring it from the car I love Jesus written on the windscreen but their behavior and their action and you know love is an action word so if you love God then your actions indicate that you love God so if you love God then I shouldn't see you dressing in a way that would not please him and students see you having conversations about what wouldn't please him I shouldn't see you putting stuff on Facebook in a way that if I could see it imagine him because he's seen way doing in secret if I see way doing in the wrong fathers with him and he's hidden secrets and some of you say you love him and he doing it in the public how could you have a test of money that you love Jesus and you will do stuff to let him when the Bible says crystals like grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby ye are sealed until the day of your redemption greed means the hood how many first hurt the Holy Spirit with how we speak how we act we spoke about it many many times on the whole it was like a dove comes to the lamb dog wouldn't come to the wolf and heard a preacher use analogy very simple analogy to how sensitive the Dove is he said think of a butterfly when a butterfly comes it will an and if you if you act irrationally or it will fly away but we have to attract the Holy Spirit our lives I'm giving you guidelines and tips and encouragement for those of you who want to get the Holy Ghost those who really want to but I don't say when you want to get a will notice what you do spend time with people who have who are your friends who is your advisors who lead in you who are you leading anybody or you just they're drifting around do you want to change or do you want I said it last Sunday I said that I love Bob you know it still troubles me because sometimes you know even though you know something gonna happen I just think they said in 300 years it's the first time in 300 years now the island of Barbuda is uninhabitable on there no humans in 300 years I said my wife we had 2017 that's nineteen seventeen eighteen seventeen seventeen seventeen three hundred years there no humans there a month before that

week and divers please we read the scripture and it's happening all over hurricane after hurricane earthquake this that and you know one it's all it's gonna get worse because that's what's supposed to happen where you gonna run to your degree can protect you your company can protect you your money can protect you I saw a report there's this metallic capsule that opens up that you could go into and close it and Catana control and this supposed to be what the ultra-wealthy believed they could go into in natural disasters the escape pod talk about how man creativity one to always find a way out or something they say they have some next bunker that goes deep dog sitter in case he has nuclear distress if you go down there only rich people and bright people whose was a continued civilization they don't know we are they want to continue civilization and I don't need a degree in aerodynamics or physics to continue it's just because I was born to continue I will be continuing because we shall

days for the punch these 16 elements will change for the planets and the Raptors a revelation it'll go from outside it'll go from inside to out one of these here's what you have been hearing will come alive in your soul and all of that chance for mission on a switch will be hit and these sixteen elements will begin a chain them in a twinkling of an eye between six and nine we shall be coming home it's temporary because we gotta come back because we shall read on it [Applause] the all creation waited for the manifestation of the sons of God and Friends the rapture is not supposed to be yelling at people - cow how Whitford wrapped in you just want to escape it's not what escaped it's about we being taken away for God to bring judgment we nurture an escape you go be scared no we're not scared the back seat for he isn't giving her the spirit of fear that's the Bible what are you afraid of but it's given the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father yeah it's nothing off vocabulary in fact many times you just focus to us fear not I think is about 66 or so times or signal he said fear not be not afraid it is I fear not fear not fear not fear not stop being afraid you are just like him we are joint heirs with Christ the trees know who you are that's why they are groaning and travailing for the manifestation of the sons of God when born sons fill sons with suddenly wake up and speak and what they say will be created somebodies same so who's ready to press past themselves this morning who's ready to claim their individual inheritance who's ready to say Lord I want to sell you with everything my all my heart my life can we give the Lord a hand oh praise the musician if you get ready I'm almost done but friends what we have this morning will not exist all the time one day there will be a last service one day there will be a last meeting and while they are still blood and they're still grace every service is a burden are hard to see you get closer to Christ and closer to the church closer to Christ to be like Jesus that's our prayer to be like Jesus to be like him to press pass ourselves and to get that that eternal life in our souls you can begin to play something softly we read the scripture there'll be two in the field one taken one left I know you've heard it before but the issues of life sometimes makes us forget how serious this thing is it'll be two and a bear there'll be two in our field one taken one left it's not to the group it's the individuals I don't believe in my heart that is anybody here today who wants to be left I don't believe in my hearts and the days of Moses when he told him to put blood on the door that there were people who say I want to die [Music] so the question is that if you want to go the question is how much you really want to go because we have a requirement to meet the preacher didn't make requirement the passer that major requirement God Himself said the requirement he said when I see the blood I'll pass over you you have to be willing to give it all up and say Lord I surrender you have to be willing to say Lord I recognize I'm no good I'm no good lord I need the Liberals Lord I my prayer life is not what it's supposed to be I'm no good [Music] Lord I need the Holy Ghost I'm no good what I need a touch of no good lord I need an experience I'm no good not my heart and in a new heart I need a new spirit and in your spirit I don't want to go on living this way [Music] I share it under communion service I said the rich young ruler he came with a desire he said master what can I do to inherit eternal life and but the Branham said you could never come to the president of the garden and leave the same he said you will either leave better or you Olivos friends this man stood before Jesus and Jesus responded he said obey your Commandments obey your mother and your father all the commandments and this young man he responded Anna I guess he would have felt good he said master I've done all of this from my youth what lack I yet and Jesus discerned his heart as his discerning hands this morning through the wood he told that young man he said go sell all that you have and give to the poor and the Bible says when that boy did that he turned away and he left sorrowful and that pained me [Music] why would you come to Jesus and leave disappointed [Music] why would you come to Jesus and leave sorrowful when he could answer everybody when he could meet every need but that young man was not willing to give up what he held dear to him and that's why he left sorrowful friends every one of us me included we have something to give up this morning we have to give up something you know what you need to give up won't you give it up today would you let it go today won't you come back home
