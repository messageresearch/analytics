context out of you today may you bless our God in the Endeavor and at the end of this series and always we will be careful to give you along all the praise and on the glory before we ask you with Thanksgiving in Jesus name amen amen God bless you um I'd like to pay attention to a few personal scripture oh okay I read numbers 13. I'll read verses 103 and then I'll skip them down to 26 2. 33 and then I also will be reading from First Corinthians chapter 2. answer Matthew 22. so numbers 13 verses one to three [Music] would you know the story I don't want to take too much time in the scriptures so I don't register too long but we're talking about the abstract searching all the way back and so you don't understand the message brother Branham said that we see many strange things one of the first quotes I came across when I came in the message newly as a very very young boy um so we see many strange things but somehow we always find them in the Bible amen and the message is back to the Bible no matter how nice how sweet how reasonable it sounds on reasonable it sounds if you don't find in the Bible run away from it and that's why you send us a prophet to take us back to the Bible and the Bible is our homeland there's a line of promise turning around is a land of bible promises so we actually are living in the land of promise right now amen so this line of Promise is promised to them and Moses sent this um was trying to send people out to go on search out the land and bring back a good report about the land and that's the same thing the holy spirit's still doing come down down Through the Ages but especially they stay here Holy Spirit come down in the ministry and the message of Malachi for the Prophet Elijah and goes to search all the way and bring a good report to us of the land not the physical land but a spiritual land of bible promises foreign so watch Moses here verse 1 numbers 13 and the Lord spoken to Moses saying send thou men that they may search the land of Canaan and for this day and age here this represents the holy spirit in the ministry of William Branham amen given a commission to a faithful Ministry to go on such other land and bring the report back to the people amen to encourage the heart not to make their hearts you know sing with fear Amen to let them know the Giants in the land they are like grasshoppers to us amen that's the work of the ministry amen amen [Music] amen send thou men verse 2 that they may search the land of Egypt not look at set when you are searching for something you are really looking every nook and every corner because you are searching foreign which I gave unto the children of Israel of every trouble of the father shall you send a man everyone a ruler among them and that's why types of the fire for Ministry today and Moses by the Commandment of the Lord send them from the Wilderness apparent all those men were heads of the children of Israel or because the heads origin of Israel does that mean they automatically bring a report that should be believed let's find out verse 26 skip on down to verse 26. [Music] Moses unto Aaron and to all the congregation of the children of Israel unto the Wilderness of perin to Kadesh and brought back award unto him unto them and unto all the congression and show them the fruit of the land they had fruit and like let's get real these guys went into the land and saw the land exactly the way Moses said it would be Moises that never been in the land but he told them was the land was gonna be like and they went and found what it was like and actually brought the fruit from the land and the Bible said they needed how many men two men to carry the grapes heavy grips of the land they're eating and slobbering they saw the fruit of the land [Music] but if that makes them believe when people talk about signs wonders miracles it's feet it's feeding the unbelief in their souls whether that's what they're looking for because the signs follow the believer they told Jesus show us a sign and we believe you Jesus said to them that there's no sign you know Begins the generation but the son of the Prophet Jonas Three Days in the Valley of the will and rose up again that's the sign is that this generation is a junction of sign Seekers but they don't believe still Jesus knew that amen [Music] this gospel has signs wonders because ingrained in it but you don't go searching looking for signs and the many in the message I mean forgive me the many who sit here too not many like plenty but they're one two three here that's all they look for it's unbelief in your soul that's feeding that these guys shove fruit fruit giant grips from the land did they make them believe no [Music] it's back to the world the what first because with the heart with the heart not with the eyes with the heart man believes with the heart with the heart verse 27 and they told him and said we came onto the land without thou sentenced us and surely if Floyd will make an horny and this is the fruit of it the Holy Spirit Malachi first message told us that he told us about the land of adoption already what we're going to find in the land Are We There Yet was it there himself yet no but he told us about it and he actually went there later Ambrose the fruit of the land do they believe it they rather say they're looking for science but they'd rather say those signs did not happen verse 28 nevertheless nevertheless see they saw this they saw it they saw this land this these are the people who are complaining Egypt Egypt the promised land they saw the land and they were it wasn't in their heart the promised land was not in their heart all these guys bashing brother man I'm done before they've been believed for 40 years he was never in their heart it was in their heads it was never in their hearts What attracted them was the signs in the prophet but not the world there's always a voice to the sign amen let me not take some on all that but I'm sure you get the drift foreign nevertheless nevertheless nevertheless it's like you said all right but the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are world and very great and moreover we saw the chewing of anak there those are giants those are giants Netflix the Bible called the Netherlands giants like Goliath was from that um that that stock Giants with 14 inch the fingers were 40 inches long Mighty giants like 10 11 feet the basketball Styles today will be dwarves compared to those guys Giants just external focused people looking at the impossibilities what will make it not come to pass it's not for you it's not for you if all you focus on is how it's not going to be and that's how many people are they pray and they are looking for how the prayer their show is not going to get answered why do you bother to pray at all because you're sure it's not going to be answered so why bother to pray in the first instance if the god you serve is so weak he can't even answer a simple prayer why bother to pray so they continue with their testimony of unbelief the amalekites dwell in the land in the south and he touched on the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the Canaanites dwell by the sea and by the coast of Jordan how are we going to take care of all those people yes it's what you said it's true but how are we going to take care of all those people and Caleb the end time believer brother calls him the one who stood with the holy spirit because the Holy Spirit moved on from Moses into Joshua and Caleb Still the people in other words he told them to shut up is still the people before moisden said let's go up at once and process it for We Are we are well able you know we are more than it to overcome it how many fields are we today amen but more than able whatever it be whether it be spiritual natural whether it be whatever materials whatever spiritual whatever your your body your health whatever what is the promise what is the promise what is the promise you are sick what is the promise say good health that's your land a promise we are more than able to take it amen do you believe that we are well able to take it are you well this morning are you ready defy every negative we are well able to take it amen amen amen you may be seated while I go on but the man that went up with him said unbelief doesn't keep quiet doesn't go away quick quickly because you insist unbelief doesn't go away they see the Miracles they won't touch them it won't touch them but the man that went on with him said we've been not able to go up against those people for they are stronger than we want the testimony what believers and they brought up an evil report of a land with that searched unto the children of Israel saying this these are like in modern day ministers so why are you surprised about people backing up for major 40 years after these are ministers they were chosen chosen men chosen to go and sell the land and bring a report back to the people like this morning go straight to the land ministers go study of the land the land of bible promises study read the word get inspiration bring nuggets there for you and bring it to the to the people and show them evidence of the land amen and show them what's in the land whatever for all of your life and godliness issues for sickness for health for your school for your work for your life with God your life your fellow man it's all in the land it's all taken care of in the land so we bring the report to you but is it a good report on the evil report once whoever things are good most everything is lovely bring this report to the people so they can think on this good and good reports amen but the men that went up with him said we'll be not able to go up against those people for they are stronger than we and they put up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel saying the land though which we have gone to search it is the land that that eat it of the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature men of great stature and then we saw the Giants which come of the Giants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers the Giants didn't tell them that Jonathan tell them that we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight remember where coming from when people see their problems as being external based there's nothing troubling you that's from outside of you nothing nothing absolutely nothing there's nothing external that is powerful enough to trouble you nothing Jesus said as a matter of fact nothing is not the things that go into a man that defiled the man but the things that come from within the defrost the man and so a young man asked me before here one of the times I had a question that answers said so so if I smoke it's not the things that go in that defiles the man so I smoke then I'm not defiled so there's nothing wrong with smoking I said well before you did before you took the cigarette to smoke something told your hands to take the cigarette and that's something from within because when you are asleep your hand doesn't even know what is doing so something that's conscious lets your hand move and do what it does so that cigarette is only that is only a manifestation of a desire from inside the what of Jesus nothing external there's nothing until you and I stop looking on the outside as things that are going to get us they're going to there's nothing external that's going to get you unless you [Music] allow it you nothing let me not run ahead of myself but these guys were so sure these Giants are going to get us but the one of the laws that they had was too small to meet the challenge of the hour too small not enough it's not big enough to face the conditions and the challenges that they had anyone that they didn't go into the Promised Land First Corinthians 2 verse 6-16 how big we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor the princes of this world not of the prince of this world that come to not wisdom Holy Spirit searching and bringing our wisdom amen but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery so the mysteries from Malachi 4 is given to us the wisdom of God and wisdom is the principle thing the Bible says even the which God ordained before the world unto our Glory the three full mystery of God Malachi 4 brought out the hidden wisdom of God ordained before the world unto our Glory which none of the prince of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord's Glory in other words there's so many hidden that the prince of this world these Giants don't know that's what those person don't understand there's a path to Victory they do like I can't see a party success there someone said I can't say the path to the money some business I can see the parts of the morning here and somebody says that I can't say the path to literal Victory here these guys this spies did not see the path to success against these Giants but the Giants themselves did not see they didn't have a clue how these guys were going to beat them because that's hidden in God and only the Holy Spirit can score search that out and give it to whomsoever he Wills that's why he's such a little flock Little Flock too many are so fixated on what their eyes tell them was their eyes tell them and why is that because they don't spend the time enough with God in his presence with his word with a revealed word they don't spend the time they spend the time with Netflix home movie and all that how you gonna grow with that I cannot get away from natural what what you see around you is what makes you your heart Frets at everything that goes around you Glory but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the wall unto our Glory which none of the prince of this world knew for they known it they will not touch Christ are going to kill him but in killing him they killed themselves that's this gospel that's the gospel of the supernatural you can't explain with your intellectual understanding phrase is written I have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for them they love him but God has revealed them unto us by the spirit the spirit the abstract that can search the Deep things of God to shed light and shine light to Europe how did David know Goliath was going to go down how did he know to the Natural intellect there's no way Goliath was going to go down no way but was given and revealed to him pick up five rocks but you only need one of them but you need to pick up five [Applause] but God revealed lemon To Us by Spirit verse 10 for the spirit such at all things yea the Deep things of God the spirit the abstract is interested only in the depth of God and so when you have this superficial Christian experience you know what is you have no real contact with thee abstract the holy spirit that shines Blood on the world and he's a gentleman he's not going to frost you and he doesn't need you he doesn't need me we are the ones that need him anything valuable God does it keeps on the inside your soul is on your on top of your head your household is inside in a place of death because God wants us to live from a place of depth okay and the Holy Spirit searches the Deep things of God and reveals it to whomsoever he Wills those who are interested in the Deep things of God for what men were the things of a man say the spirit of that man which is in him even so the things of God not no man but the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world intellect but the spirit which is of god the Holy Spirit the abstract to the tattoo deed thou we might know the things that have freely given to us of God in other words the things that forgiven us God the world the the title did the what the message but just written it means nothing the Holy Spirit the abstractness to shine light on it so you might know a knowledge and understand and know so everybody can read brother brahm's message the pope can read it but he needs the Holy Spirit the abstract to search it out and give it to him that he might know the things that are freely given to us of God amen can you say Amen foreign given to us now we see them we freely speak them because freely you have received freely give which things also we speak knowing the word what which man's Wisdom teacheth are put into your intellect but with the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual for the natural man receiving not the things of the spirit of God for their foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually designed for either a spiritual judge of all things yet himself is Judge of no man for who had known the man of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the man of Christ amen finalists in Matthew 22 and verse 34 to 40. when the freshes that had that he had put these services to silence they were gathered together and one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question chanting him and saying Master which is the great commandment in the law Jesus said unto him thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like until it thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets amen Lord that is blessing to read all his holy words amen all right um let's try and see if we can wind it down today the last amount I chat this last scripture we read here and it's in the other goes supposed to I think Mark Matthew Mark and Luke has the scripture I mean the same story from a different context each one of them all of them talked about the two great Commandments and if you go to Deuteronomy chapter 6 you'll see this great commandment verses 3 2 19 thereabouts more use than the people here all Israel the Lord that God is one and thou shall love the Lord that God with all thy heart with other soul and with other mind and then it breaks it down and explains what that means what that means which we talked about that before how it affects you when you lie down when you stand up when you sleep it affects every area of you that's how you love God not just on Sunday morning church every area of you go read Deuteronomy 6 when you are lying at home when you are standing when you are walking when you are going and when you're coming in that's how you love God with your heart soul and mind [Applause] it actually it it it it it it engulfs your whole life it affects your life every hour and Jesus said Jesus Jesus when he came he and this uh scripture we just read here he expanded on that father and said that's your duty to God that's a rich God because they came and asked him Master which is a great commandment in other words narrow up there's so many Commandments narrow it down to one commandment for us in other words and Jesus didn't tell them get you know we complicate things too much too much we have the rule for this rule for that rule for this rule for that look all of The Commandments in the Bible Jesus said every one of them can be narrowed down to these two things two things he said thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy soul with all thy heart Lord thy mind and Deuteronomy shows you what it means to love the love thy God with that Soul heart and mind it engulfses your whole life when you're lying down when you are walking on the wall on the street in the neighborhood in school everywhere no one life at work another life at school another life at home your life is the same the love of God is oozing out of you everywhere you are and he said and the second is like unto it because you have very spiritual people who are very spiritual and love God but they they love God they live in a world a world of uh a world of and unreal world where they are alone in a war with God they I mean many people throw you quotes in a world along with God and all that Jesus said when you're in that world along with God it shows in the natural Realm because you are a Triumph being Spirit soul body because you Traverse the spiritual and the natural so because before you get too spiritual and too super duper the second commandment is like unto it thou shall Love Thy Neighbor as thyself and Jesus's life showed us how to love your neighbor as yourself and he said on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets I don't want to take your time I can show you many things in life there are so many so many I'll show you like the experts are putting on to two things three things two things three things all the principles in the Bible all the principles of life you can bring them the Bible bring them out to one thing what you sow you reap all the principles in the world brings them down to one because God know to simplify things so you don't say I couldn't remember 200 of the principles no bring it down to one and Jesus here brought all of life down to these two Commandments love the neighbor I mean love God and love thy neighbor as thyself and that's the story in the Bible that's a story in the Bible which is um which is which is all there is in life is narrowed down to your relationship with God I wish you a fellow man relationship with God must reflect in relationship with your fellow man if you don't have relationship with God you actually with no man means very little but the primary thing is that line with God shot in with God in a secret place there in the spirit behold in his face gaining no power to run in the race I'd like to reach I long to be shutting with God that's the primary thing the mystery of godliness how to be Godly in this life and in this world godliness amen and when you are that way it shows and reflects and the second is like unto it in other words same principle and the principle Moses showed us in the Old Testament when you walk when you stand when you are lying down everywhere in the field in the house on the in the yard everywhere love thy neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments hang on the law you can narrow all the law and all the Commandments into these two and that boils down to life and godliness that's why we spent the last last time doing that's what it is all about so you don't have people who are so spiritual they don't care they are Heavenly Creatures they forget their a twofold in one on the earth to die wanting heaven to leave they are just living in heaven right now forget like that they're human beings on the face of the Earth who need to interact with the wall around them and that's what God put into the elements of the training that he gave adam and he gave he gives us even though many of us don't recognize it but if we do we'll set up our lives and the lives of the people will train our children whoever else for greatness for greatness so God narrows it down and Jesus showed us to life ungodliness and the godliness comes first and so God every child that comes in he speaks to him for godliness a relationship with God and in that relationship God is showing them how to interact with the world around them showing them how to about affection and memory and reasoning imagination and conscience how to interact with the world around them godliness controlling the things you do in life that's why I deal with Adam put his soul there for us and putting their godliness godliness to the word of God the word of God and then he put him in body of Flesh and sometimes show him the things that put into this natural War here walk responsibility accountability relationships marriage how to love his neighbor as himself love God and love your neighbor yourself it's so clearly I can see it can you say amen amen so excuse me [Applause] second Peter says he has given us all things the potential life and goodness and my contention is that is that because you see that Faith virtue knowledge Temperance I don't even know what it means you don't even know what you're talking about my contention is that that's what got it for Adam and that's what God is for every single one of us every single one of us because he brought us into this world here and he made sure he gave every single man not just the seed of God every single man what they need to thrive on this face of this up here whether you are rich or you don't need to buy oxygen no you don't need to whether you are rich or poor you don't need to understand how to love your mom no you don't have to go and buy it if that was it many people would not be able to do it but God's grace gave to us all the potential life and godliness amen many people want the ones that penis in life but they don't want the on the godliness but God that is the godliness comes first because he created the man the spirit man for us the godliness and then he added the life issues in Genesis 2. 15-25 Man became a living soul and then began to teach him how to do this how to do that how to do this how to do that we got to teach him all of those things so he had a complete Hotel son who was programmed conditioned trained by God to be phenomenal in life and actually live like God on the face of the Earth for Adam it wasn't just nice words for Adam it was a training for life for Adam it was how he would be an amateur God on the face of this Earth here for Adam he wasn't just coming to church on a Sunday morning for Adam it was a life and death situation because he needed to be an amateur God on the face of this Earth for God his father amen so the two were connected together in the soul of man that's where the connection so God gave adam all that in there for life and godliness but for the spiritual and the natural how many understand I say amen amen all right and my insistence that he has given us also the same things the Bible says he has given us nothing all ever everything that we need for life and godliness like the song says all I have needed the hand hath provided if we actually really it will reduce our stress levels in many things we stress ourselves about to reduce the stress levels that we give ourselves many times we carry on as though this God will serve is sleeping somewhere or he doesn't even have ears to hear oh and when we live like that when you live like that you don't think you can do it he will not do it because that's it's not because I don't want to do it that's his nature You've Got to Believe you've got to absolutely believe for the problems that believe with all your heart believe with all your heart you don't believe and don't doubt in your heart as you're sitting there listening to me I want to be thinking back about your life don't bother by your husband your wife I'm not about you because I want to bring that down to you because if you're going to break the cycle and the inference of those things in your life you're going to do for yourself and you're going to be very brutally Frank with yourself amen so God has also given us the same without his God it changes not what he gave adam he gives us like I've been talking all the time about little children the natural and all that God gives every man liberally like Adam all the things that put into life and godliness will only build in US positive issues of life because it's in a source positive issues of life what's the program in conditioning for positive to live a great life to live a life full of successes and any challenge we call it as though it's not there amen they promised land but what did the promise say what is the promise say and Frankly Speaking personally I don't have too much interest in in uh um the gospel that only makes your yourself God you come to church you do this and then you don't do anything else because the Ephraim I have seen maybe you haven't seen that even that I have seen Among Us message groups and for us in the Thunders I saw that especially after the Julian episode we're very good on the spiritual the inspiration the world get baptized the Holy Ghost but there's nobody teaching us to live a Christian Life Israel almost forgot these things and not for your head or just to make you feel spiritual what is to believe in on the outside is a godliness showing out in your life [Applause] so we just we're very good at you know great mystery prick message that's gonna Maple's heads swell and wow great and people just just a few people Allah in my life but most of the people just for their heads and then you find us admiring Brothers the life he lived when is the same one he gave us that gives him the ability to leave that life but because nobody told us that this war here is not for your head is to drop in your heart and show forth in your life [Applause] [Music] so let's get back to the child [Music] so God trains every little child and programs them fashion them for greatness tell me the child that doesn't have great hopes for the future tell me the child that doesn't hope to conquer the wall tell me the other doesn't hope to you know be phenomenal in their lives Jeremy the parent that doesn't want that child to be phenomenal tell me the parent the original child should be to do great things only problem many times that we want them to do great things in natural non-spiritual the spiritual we are comfortable with them having a so-so kind of life we are comfortable with that we're comfortable with it they saw so kind of life for our children but not in the natural and natural want them to be great whichever way show me the child or the parent that doesn't want the child to be phenomenal or doesn't want to be phenomenal in their lives show me the child that wants to be just a regular person I'll talk about brother Bailey and brother yummy and I've been in medical school together but nobody wanted to come out of medical school and be a doctor in some small place no we want to be the one that's doing great things I'm very successful whenever you go to school whatever study course you are studying that's what you have in your heart if you don't have that in your heart going to school there's something wrong with you there's something wrong if you want to have that first and hunger and you have to be phenomenal there's something wrong with you you don't have that in your heart to be excellent and ex live in this in the Stars there's something wrong with you [Music] even if you're a laborer be the stand out laborer that's why you call Dignity of Labor if you're a cleaner be the best there is if you don't have that in your heart there's something wrong with you if you just work for your pay there's something wrong with you it's something against your spiritual DNA from God especially as a child of God that you're supposed to be Amen brother Brahms that God doesn't want his children to be ordinary he said I don't want my children to be ordinary talking about the ritual I said is wanting to be extraordinary that's what I want for my children that's what God wants for his children I mean how much extraordinary can you be than to be God on the face of the Earth we also be God on the face of the Earth that's phenomenal it has been the best there isn't anything best Christian there isn't anything if you are the boss on your job be the best there is be the best in every area be the best in kindness be the best in discipline be the best in impossibility personally everything be the person stand up for your food be the best there is Hallelujah that's the programming from God and this Gospel of Malachi first message is designed for exactly that forgive me it may not be your type of gospel but that's what I understand from mother Banner Department always wanted him to be a doctor Billy Paul and said but he wasn't going to be looking want him to be a preacher but he didn't have the gift I said but the Branham said but show me the code that negates that [Music] because it's written it is also written foreign anything you want to do be the best at it be the best husband be the best wife be the best housewife be the best mother be the best father we're the best engineer be the best lawyer I'll be the best businessman be the best Deacon there is be the best pastor there is be the best of whatever you want to be that's our DNA [Applause] and to make the point real to you mother Billy Paul brother Brown said even if you choose to be a thief is not telling you go and be a thief you know that people God because if no comparing spiritual people compare spiritual things with spiritual are just ready to you you know 700 here 700 so someone is doing the Rapture compare it with everything else that he said comparing spiritual thing with spiritual that scripture that's a spiritual man's life [Applause] he said even if you choose to be a thief to make the point be the best sin there is that's the point he's making be the best there is many daughters have done virtuously but thou Excellence them what is the speed of Excellence like Joseph had like Daniel had that's the heritage of a children of God amen they're coming here they have a sphere of Excellence Hallelujah they make it easy for the Holy Spirit the husband makes a Jesus for his wife what makes it easy for her husband children make use for their parents parents make it easy for their children a spirit of excellence in the house Hallelujah thank you [Applause] excuse me are we on the generator hey look Christmas there's a little stuff in here he's off [Music] it was cold I'm sweating foreign are you feeling cold you're feeling it's too cold for you all right that's fine that's fine okay all right here you go I'm feeling cold you're fine all right all right okay once my little my little girls are feeling cold that's fine all right but but it's there's no problem I mean just that they shut this off right that's why that's that's fine that's fine that's fine okay what was I you know I never hear you when you say you always do this yeah yeah yeah I never hear you huh speed of Excellence that's right when you have no confidence even when even strong the love that God is with thee amen all right so that's how God programmed his children to be the best there is the best in Behavior the best in the way they talk look at the Bible look at the Bible look at the strings of the Bible get to make you just so so get to make you the best there is and that's how every child is that child is on the verge of accountability dreaming to Take On The World and those of them who get saved in that Asia want to be the best there is in terms of their Christian existence that's who God is how will God the great God of the universe make mediocre children Adam was a mediocre and I'm at Absolute Authority on the face of the Earth are you with me are you with me are you sure you're with me all right but then what happened to us what happened parents parents are what happened to parents happen to us [Music] and I've seen enough of that myself I mean you have but maybe but we've all seen enough of that I've seen enough of that myself the parents are two medals so many times very medicine I admit many times it's because you think that's the best thing to do but but for Spiritual people should know better because parents are training and parental influence and influence of other people that we look up to our mentors like my little child you begin to Palm them with into these negative things there not from God there's no negativity in God God brought positive there that's why you don't come to church people negative things don't tell people this church is better this church there's something wrong with them you should not do that on a property in church [Applause] you should not come in here young men young woman and spread your Fields with your friends around here God God doesn't have God has nothing negative about him they should not come in this house here or and spirit evil and negative gossip and negativity that's not God's spirit God's spirit is positive if you have no important to say shut your mouth is okay all right this job that church this church here no this church I've told you before is a sick day is the sick Jesus said that in the physician not the healthy if you are healthy help us to make them healthy but don't say look at them here that church yeah look at what they think that church here stay and be help us to be the ones that know what is right to do and do it son of man has come to save and seek that which was lost but parents when they come to that child their parents have to interact with a child in the age of our country I mean that age of innocence and they begin to introduce negative stuff negative stuff negative programming and what that does it begins to bring a challenge to what God taught us on the inside to program us to live lives not of greatness but of negativity lives of mediocrity lives that have like you know values that shaded to what the family wants what their tribe wants what their you know Clan believes not what the word of God says and it's these negative issues that make up most what we call are known as generational crosses um says over and over and over again so you don't go after this and start thinking about somebody dinner there are people who try to do stuff to you I had too much of it in Christianity I'm just wondering like what kind of a god do we serve I've had message George is saying like that I mean I mean I'm saying it I mean I mean this

Hollywood too much Nollywood that's troubling you [Applause] she's a more spiritual attacks and all of that and things like that there is nothing from outside of you that has the power to keep you [Applause] that's the word of the Lord you may be seated you can afford to live fearlessly you can afford to live with abandonment there is nothing that can touch you because the Bible says no weapon no weapon that's passion against you shall prosper it shall not prosper Hallelujah you may be seated [Applause] [Music] so you don't come here and tell me what they said in that Pentecostal church

and I realize that I've been here about one hour already but but uh just give me a little time okay all right greatness with positive issues in their lives positive some people now Faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence name is not sin faith is positive tell me what about God that's negative people claim great faith but they are always gossiping they always seem what's not good about that person no that you don't have faith no you don't have faith that's the secret of William branham's life when you have faith you will see everything positive and negative when people

what this person did what that person did whether personally just criticize you don't have great faith no faith says the things that are the things that be not as though they are and the negative faces you are not in the picture so what faith does faith includes righteousness we are righteous it's imputed to us felt in his righteousness to your brother to your sister that's what faith is that's how God program us that's how God wants his children to be you maybe see that glory glory to God [Music] [Applause] you may be seated [Applause] but then our parents take us and fill us Lord us with these negatives negative negatives and we start having problems in life and then we blame everybody else I see message churches where they say oh this person's a witch that person a week this
