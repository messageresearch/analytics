certainly appreciate his presence this morning and um i have a small thought to share with you this morning so i pray that the lord would use it in a mighty way this morning amen amen so let's turn to our bibles as we want to get started this morning i have two portions of scripture i want to read from in the new testament amen amen so uh reading from saint john chapter 15 amen and we also want to read from matthew 25 14. as a matter of fact we'll read from matthew first so you could find booker saint matthew first and that's chapter 25 and uh verse 14 amen and then you'll find saint john after amen so praise god hallelujah matthew 25 verse 14 and uh this is jesus given a parable here after that he had spoken about the ten versions he goes into this story here speaking about the coming of the lord and so on and this is matthew 25 verse 14 and it says for the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country who called his own servants and delivered unto them his goods and onto one he gave five talents to another two and to another one to every man according to his several ability and straight away took his journey so he left amen and then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same and made them other five talents and likewise he that received two he also gained another two but he that had received one went and digged in the earth and hid his lord's money verse 19 after a long time the lord of the of those servants cometh and recognized with them and so he that had re had received five talents came and brought uh other five talents saying lord thou deliver us unto me five talents behold i have gained beside them five talents more his lord said unto him well done thou good and faithful servant thou has been faithful over a few things and i will make the ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of the lord he also that had received two talents came and said lord thou deliver us unto me two talents behold i have gained uh gained two other talents beside them his lord said unto him well done uh good and faithful servant thou has been faithful over a few things and i will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of the lord then he that had received the one talent came and said lord i knew thee that thou art a hard man a hard man reaping where thou hast not sown and gathering with our has not strong and i was afraid and went and hid thy talent in the earth law there thou hast that is dying and as lord answered and said unto him thou wicked and slaughterful servant i knew is that i reap where i sowed not and gathered where i not strawed uh that take the um though orders to have put my money to the exchanges and then at my coming i should have received mine own with usury take therefore the talent from him and give it unto him which hath ten talents uh for to everyone that hath shall be given and he that hath he shall have abundance but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath and cast ye the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth i know you want to uh we want to turn on to saint john 15 and reading from 1 verse 1 to 8. amen so last scripture uh before we pray saint john 15 1 amen hallelujah amen so jesus is preaching this morning amen says i am the true vine and my father is the husband man every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit now ye are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you abide in me and i knew as a branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except he abide in me i am the vine here the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are boone if you abide in me and my words abiding you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you hearing is my father glorifying that ye bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples let's bow our heads for word of prayer this morning heavenly father lord we just read your word lord father lord we know lord father no man can do justice to the scripture save for you alone jesus christ so father i pray lord that you come along in a special way this morning lord me anoint my lips this morning lord i'm just here to hide behind your cross this morning as you will come forward and speak to your people oh god father take complete control lord lord may i speak to each heart and life lord minister oh god father lord to the knees in here this morning lord minister to us lord father lord in a way that would uh uh exhort us this morning unto good works law lord for your soon cometh lord father lord you would not have for us to be unfruitful this morning granted almighty god we may come down in a special way once more and minister to your hearts of your children this morning take me out of the way and lord remember your servant lord as he's traveling back and forth to and fro lord may anointing be with him lord father and anoint him and his wife lord father along their journey to today lord granted almighty god lord that you would straightforward your hand towards them lord and touch them wherever they are granted lord now bless us this morning take complete control this morning in jesus name i ask amen and amen you may be seated give the lord a praise offering a man amen hallelujah amen amen hallelujah glory to god glory to god that's what he had to do he had to worship him he had to praise him he had to glorify his holy name amen he had to give him thanks and praise and worship isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah that's who you are amen amen isn't that right hallelujah just before i begin you man i i think about friday i went out with the family and everything and i think we went uh went out went to the beach and so on just went strolling for a walk and um and we met up with a guy i think he was from another i don't know i don't know what kind of a denomination he was from but um you know he was talking to us and so on talking about the lord he just kind of pulled up alongside us and and we were just talking and fellowshipping about about jesus amen and um this man he was real excited about about god or jesus about about about the word he was about sad about the scriptures excited about the bible and you know it was it was such a thing to see because you don't see a lot of people like that these days you know he didn't ask me what church i went to up to now i met him we spoke about 15 20 minutes or something i think something like that not to know he hasn't asked me what church i go to or where i fellowship we was just talking on the word amen amen and enjoying each other's company enjoying each other's fellowship my god and we could begin to talk to him and so on and he began to say brother i tell you he said sometimes the word become a fought and he said sometimes i just he said i just can't sit still he said he said when the word come forth to touch power and such anointing you say you just want to jump up and you just want to scream and you just want to shake his fist in the air and say come on preach that word preach that word and i'm almost 100 percent sure that this man is hearing nothing about seven thunders about perfection about adoption about a fifo ministry about a prophet about our apostle i don't think he's hearing any of this stuff but he's so excited about god and i begin to think wow he's got amen what we call the bare necessities he's hearing amen what we call the bare minimum amen just the basic fundamental gospel and yet with that he is so excited i begin to think what about us what about we who are fat and sassy what about we who are getting a hundred percent a hundred percent every time every sunday every thursday my god you have a meal in the barrel you have oil in the cruise every time on the button praise god oh hallelujah you have no excuse this morning not to shout and praise god you have no excuse not to lift up your voice oh and give praise unto god forever and ever and ever and ever oh hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah to hear what we hear and to see what we see amen so much we're benefiting from we're so thankful for this ministry that god has given us amen by means of brotherhood amen and and so on and bring in the word hallelujah isn't that right we're thankful to have a pastor after god don't choose him hallelujah isn't that right are you thankful this morning amen to keep us on the street and narrow amen to keep the messiah ship straight that's what it's all about amen hallelujah hey man amen so we're here to earnestly contend this morning amen please god so i said that to set the tone amen praise god so you praise you worship you stay in the atmosphere you stay in the spirit i feel god wants to speak this this morning and he gave me this thought here about the story you just read here concerning uh the parable of the talents and i know that many people refer to the story in many ways some people call it parable of the talent some people call it parable of the five talents or whatever and there's also another account of the story in saint luke uh which talks about a servant who went away but i want to take it to the context of saint uh of saint matthew because uh in the context here in which jesus related story he was actually uh in a chapter before or prior to this with matthew 24 where he was on the mount of olives isn't that right and he was speaking to the disciples about when the end shall come it's not right so he's speaking about the end of the uh uh the end of the world and so on and uh the coming of the lord so it's in this context that we are taking this story this morning because uh we believe uh that we are in the time of the coming of the lord isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah so we want to draw from uh this context this morning amen so that's why i chose saint matthew amen's account of the story amen because prior to that uh he was talking about the ten virgins isn't that right five wise and five are foolish amen hallelujah isn't that right amen but we want to take the context of the story here so without further ado my title this morning uh the inspiration and how it came to me or how god quickened it to me rather the unprofitable servant that's my title this morning amen and my subject is hearing is my father glorifying that ye bear much fruit my inspiration is sealer pause think on this amen amen hallelujah so we're here to do some thinking this morning amen hallelujah we had to take inventory this morning every once in a while it's good to step back and look at your life and see if it measures up to the gospel isn't that right every once in a while it's good to stop put down the tablet put down the smartphone stop think for a second is my life worthy of the gospel hallelujah isn't that right is it truly measuring up if the lord were to return would i be unprofitable amen these are the questions that started coming out to me when i began to study this text here amen so let me begin this morning amen so in the story i seen matthew amen uh we read about it five talents isn't that right and he's speaking about the coming of the lord in this context here hallelujah amen and then so now i began to study this parable i began to read it over and over and over and then every time i read it something else would jump out at me amen and um when he begins the story here jesus begins to talk begins to speak he says first thing he introduces he says that this man went off our country isn't that right and he brought forth his servants isn't that right he didn't just bring anybody he didn't just bring the man on the street isn't that right he didn't just bring against her or you know just any kind of person amen this man brought forth his servants and the word servant if you look it up it means a follower or it means a person who expresses submission or recognizance somebody who recognizes authority isn't that right a follower of the lord so these are the men that came towards the lord that was written in this story isn't that right it wasn't just anybody they were all silvers it's not are you following me this morning many men hallelujah praise god so they were servants isn't that right and these servants of the lord were given talents and from what i began to research when i looked up the word talent because you always hear the word talent and it's a common misconception that our people would say that a talent is like an ability like he gave somebody an ability to do something which is incorrect um he gave them the talents according to their ability amen isn't that right but the talent itself wasn't uh like an ability he didn't give them an ability he gave what he gave according to their ability amen okay so we're rightly placing the word here this morning amen so what is the talent so i looked it up uh because the word intrigued me and what it really means uh means is that a talent represents a sum of money right now in those days i think they would weigh stuff to measure the value of it so a talent of gold would be worth such and such a talent of bronze would be worth such and such a talent of silver and of course obviously a talent of gold would be more uh valuable than a talent of silver or maybe prawns or brass or whatever amen so this is how they measured uh possessions amen and the story goes on to say that this lord i know i'm building up to it real slow but i'm getting somewhere so sailor think on this amen so you know and this is what a talent is so it's really a large sum of possessions that he gave to these men and um when they they did the math i ran the numbers and what they were saying was that a talent is actually worth 20 years of a day's laborers wage so when you run the numbers that's almost about three-quarter of a million dollars okay so we're talking about a lot of money here amen amen it's not right so even the one who got one had a lot of money even the one who had one talent had a lot to do with amen it wasn't that he just had a little coin or a little um what you call a shilling he didn't he didn't know that he had that he had a lot of money at three quarter of a million dollars he could do a lot with that i wish i had that right now and so you know so this is where we're taking the context from so i'm trying to paint the picture here so you can get an idea of why this lord was so angry when he came back from his his journey okay all right so then he okay so where are we at here now so why did i say that so what what the lord did he divided his possessions among them and he departed isn't that right and he divided his possessions among them they were great possessions the five talents of two towns and one talent they were all great possessions and i can't help but think how god is so merciful to us that he would give us great possessions by means of his word say amen somebody amen amen what we take light in church what do we take light for books and tapes is great possessions oh we're going to say some things this morning what we take like what we take for granted every sunday every thursday even every day of the week is a great possession hallelujah some of us take the word for granted isn't that right what he has given us in this hour and this season god has actually given us an opportunity to escape say amen someone an opportunity escape the darkness an opportunity to escape the world and its corruption hallelujah isn't that right how does he do that he brings a word to you amen and then he raises a standard how by taking that same word and making it more positive making it more positive making it more real to you isn't that right he can't anoint anything else he's not looking for anything else he says my word shall not return to me void but it shall accomplish the purpose that i have sent forth for it to accomplish so if god wants to accomplish anything this morning the first thing he has to send is his word same and somebody hallelujah praise god hallelujah look at yourself for granted in you is a seed in you is a seed of what you are to become and that seed is the word of god and that seed is why you are believing what you are believing this morning according to your abilities this morning so much has been granted to you this morning great possessions are you following me this morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen isn't that right most powerful thing you can give the bride in this hour is the word of god amen hallelujah isn't that right it was a word of god that defeated satan in the wilderness no spirit no signs no wonders nothing that you could look upon to desire just the dry word of god alone it is written it is written it is also written that same word god took that word hallelujah and did something to the devil that to this day he still has headaches about it to this day satan still has nightmares about it what jesus did to him in the wilderness with just the word alone oh hallelujah and somebody same so we have great possessions amen amen you're rich this morning let the week say i'm strong i let the poor say i am rich hallelujah stop this wishy-washy halfway christian attitude praise god god has a uh uh uh uh on a thousand hills this morning amen god holds the owns a whole lot and you're his child he said shall i have from abraham what i'm about to do because of who abraham is i cannot hide it i mean what god is about to do in this hour he cannot hide it from you or say amen somebody because of who you are in this hour and in this season because of what you represent he cannot hide it from you oh hallelujah hallelujah amen same man somebody the secret things belong to god but the things which are revealed they belong to us and god reveals seven thunders god reveals seven virtues god revealed hallelujah how to prepare ourselves that the seven tell us give us faith praise god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah god reveal the content say man isn't that right that was in that book that was sealed with seven seals that one man was ready to open but the bleeding bloody lamb came forth and revealed the contents of that book the contents of that book this morning is already released it is already open you cannot put it back hola it's already released in front of you the holy ghost your perfection your adoption all that you are looking for your healing come on now your ceiling come on now your breakthrough come on now your deliverance come on now it is already released oh same meant somebody say man somebody oh hallelujah come on now when a chick when a chick hatches out of the egg you can't put the chick back in the egg it's already come out of what it's been in now it's manifest in time time for that chick to come out i begin to walk like mama i begin to talk like papa hallelujah hallelujah glory to god glory to god amen amen hallelujah brother when you get the baptism of the holy ghost you can't go back to being normal you cannot go back to being ordinary hallelujah it's not right isn't that right oh hallelujah when i say that i think about elisha all the time am i who was plowing in the dig field dirt i don't know how long he was doing that for but it was almost meaningless it was almost unprofitable but then all of a sudden here come elijah with a mantle with a power with an anointing with a presence it was something more real than the dirty was digging for all long he was digging i don't know but it was real what elijah felt and not in that field brother we gotta get to heaven only he could tell you what he felt when that anointing dropped in his heart for the first time my god he could he was so high he could touch the clouds praise god amen amen amen hallelujah praise something stimulated in his heart he knew elisha knew from that day on that he could not go on the same way he come amen isn't that right he couldn't continue digging dutch no no no no his life was for a greater purpose than that and his works did show that he did believe that this thing happened to him because he went straight away and burned a plow get rid of the oxen i'm ready to follow elijah i'm ready to follow the anointed word hallelujah hallelujah and when god speaks to you young man when god speaks to you young woman it is a voice unlike any other voice on the earth it will shake you to your foundations same men somebody same meant somebody hallelujah hallelujah hey many man that's what a fresh vision does that's what a fresh anointing does but obvious spoke about it all the time talked about king uzziah when he died and isaiah was leaning on him all the time but sometimes god has to get rid of the props come on now say amen somebody sometimes god has to lick away the legs just stand on break it away take away the pillars move everything in your life that you are idolizing that you are worshiping remove it why because it is unprofitable and god will not have an unprofitable servant shame and somebody that's why god breaks it he breaks it he breaks it nothing will take his place nothing will take his place in here this morning you are going free this morning who the son of man set free is free indeed and the son of man is here this morning hallelujah praise god isaiah broken in the anointing he run into the temple it was the only place left to run i said i couldn't run home it was too scary he couldn't run to the funeral service of uziah it was too scary to look at there was no place for him left to go there was nobody left to talk to he had to go and find god in the temple i wonder that's why you come this morning there's no place for you to run this morning where you gonna run where you gonna hide when god owns the whole earth he come to find you this morning oh same and somebody same meant some party oh this is real oh hallelujah hallelujah take the calls cleanse my lips i'm not worthy anymore he saw his wretchedness he saw his unfruitful unprofitable life laid before the altar of god he knew he couldn't go the same way anymore he knew he couldn't continue in his sin in his filth in his mind and his thinking he began to lean on god and on all of a sudden he had come to cold from off the altar here come the seraphs with the tongues of fire to cleanse his lips oh i made a seraph's come blasting through here this morning and baptized you with the holy ghost and fire oh hallelujah as soon as he make his appeal before god here come the angels here come the seraphs the servants of the most high to fulfill his need oh hallelujah you make your acclaim before god this morning i challenge you to make your appeal before god this morning there's an anointing here this morning that is accompanied by seraphs that is accompanied by anointed angels of the most high god his train is filling the temple this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise god amen great possession let's come back to this here now my god where are we at god has given us great possessions isn't that right hallelujah we take it for granted coming here in church i want to praise halfway we want to come late we want to do what we want to do and yet you have great possessions sitting on it sleeping on it i wonder what god thinks we so self absorb think about ourselves think about our needs and what we want why don't you think about god for a change see amen somebody he's so self-centered what a condition to be in what god has given us what is great possession see and god sends his prophet uh before the great and terrible day of the lord isn't that right it gives us an opportunity to change an opportunity to bring forth fruit isn't that right hallelujah amen isn't that right so your life has to produce something you can't say you're coming to this church here and it's just gonna pass through no no it's not gonna work like that you have to produce something you have to have something to show for otherwise what's the purpose what's the purpose of you coming here why are you coming here for why you're wasting your time don't waste your time time runs out you won't always have all the time in the world we always have all the time to do this and to that sooner or later like but oversaid time runs out and then when time runs out you can't do anything about it again when the lord came back to his servants to find out the report about what they were doing with the talents what they were doing with the possessions that he gave them one of them had an evil report isn't that right time had already run out it was time for them now to give an account it was time for them now to uh own up to what they were doing all them years hallelujah in the lord's absence isn't that right hallelujah and juan when he should have been earnestly contended one when he should have put him would be putting his his possessions to use isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right one when he should have been producing fate and virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience and godliness and brotherly kindness and adding with all diligence come on now hallelujah god will not have any lazy sons in the kingdom same man somebody god hates laziness god hates thoughtfulness slothful attitudes coming to church hallelujah hallelujah i don't want to give that one turd come on now hallelujah praise god god hates that what abhors that thing man wants us to live for him isn't that right hey man he wants our ad he wants us to add an ad prosper that's what you're supposed to be doing not sitting there just doing nothing taking up space nobody likes a a tree that doesn't bring forth fruit think about it one time my dad i think he had a some seeds and he decided to plant it i think he thought it was a lime or lemon or something and he put it in the center of the yard he said well this thing is going to be the price of my garden and you put it in there and it begin to grow about six months to a year two years and every year looking forward for something from the tree today could be the day oh this could be the season this could be a year now and nothing not even a blossom obviously over time we realized that the tree was useless so we uprooted it dug it out and something else took its place amen what's the point of that nobody likes that not even jesus likes that one time jesus come walking down with his disciples and he went up to a tree it was a fig tree and he looked at a tree and a tree brought forth no fruit and he was hungry and in his hunger jesus looked at the tree and cursed the tree to the roots that thing vexed jesus so much that he literally cut it off from the life itself isn't that right i'm trying to show you how much god hates on fruitfulness god hates somebody who is unprofitable somebody who is not bringing forth as they should is not doing as they should he said every vine that bring it forth i'll purge it that it bring forth more fruit that i bring forth much fruits because hearing is my father glorify that you bring forth much fruit but every branch does not bring forth i will cut it off same and someone amen sailor think on this glory to god am i your life has to produce something isn't that right jesus said unless a corner wheat fall into the ground and die it's abide alone but if it die it bring forth much fruit isn't that right hallelujah that's what god wants from you much fruit more fruit much fruit isn't that right your life has to produce something it has to vibrate something hallelujah isn't that right a dog know when you love him a dog a dog a simple animal knows when you love it he'll come wagging his tail because you're vibrating something your life is emanating something five feet away from the animal he could feel that presence coming off of you whether it's an evil presence a good prayer he could tell he's not a fool god put something in him to pick that up isn't that right hallelujah and the devil will know when you are vibrating something different say man zambani even the devil believe and tremble but when the holy ghost comes into you when the pill of fire is tabernacle when deity take up a spot in your heart the devil knows when you stop lying come on now the devil will know when you stop cheating come on now the devil know when you stop doing wrong he began to pick it up in the atmosphere oh no here's another one of them here's another one like jesus here's another one like the messiah here's another one that kicked me out hallelujah hallelujah same in somebody oh hallelujah hallelujah he knows that life he's all too familiar with that life he's all too familiar with that fruit praise god hello he knows it he's had a taste of it it leaves a sour taste in his mouth praise god hallelujah hallelujah but that's what uh he's going to get in this end time but because they're going to be some sons of god there are going to be some daughters of god that are going to stand for him they are going to live for him they are going to live the life of jesus christ they are going to do the same works that he did hallelujah praise god in that right they're gonna walk like him they're gonna talk like him they're gonna live like him they're gonna do his signs his wonders jesus said these signs shall follow stem that belief and mining they shall cast our devils they shall heal the sick raise the dead they shall speak in other tongues if they drink any deadly thing it shall not harm them praise god that is the word of god that is the fruit you are going to produce oh same as somebody hallelujah email genesis 128. god spoke in the beginning he said let's make man in our inaudible likeness when he made that man what did he do he said let that man be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and take dominion over it and let him take over let him take charge let him take rulership be fruitful that's what he told the first man hallelujah hallelujah before they were anywhere created he told that first man that's birdman genesis one man he told them be fruitful multiply replenish the earth in other words make some more ones like me isn't that right hallelujah isn't that right because in that one sun the seed sun what other suns to come forth isn't that right to be in that same image hallelujah and if he had begun to speak those sons into existence we all know that we would be here in that same perfectness isn't that right he was supposed to speak us and we will comfort because in that sea lay other seeds isn't that right you look at one seed you tell itself it's just one seed but in that one seed has the potential to bring forth other seeds just like itself but it has to be in the right condition it has to be in the right environment something has to happen to that seed it has to go through a process a process of death a process of rotting a process of forming isn't that right and then the blade come up and then the process is isn't that right coming on to the fruit again so if adam was to speak isn't that right he was to produce more sons like him isn't that right we all know that he got cut off from it lost his inheritance hallelujah the devil didn't leave the tree to grow long enough for it to get into that spot where he could begin to produce more suns hardly because he can handle more suns like adam no no no no adam was too powerful to contend to it that's why he come through eve that's why he come through the by-product you couldn't go to adam shame and somebody oh hallelujah the devil saw that thing he wanted to cut it off he saw a family unit if she saw a unit moving in the direction of god hallelujah and he said let me cut that thing off before it gets to a place where i can't control it so he decided to slip his interpretation in there we all know that that's how man fell holly isn't that right and through that fall it produced two sons cain and abel isn't that right hallelujah there was a man in his fallen condition and i believe uh adam sometimes i guess he would talk to his sons like any good father would and tell his sons about the garden and about how things used to be and about the kind of power he had and the kind of authority he had and the presence of god like it was there in the cool of the evening when god would come down to speak to him abra amen and cain were listening to endless messages that that adam had to talk about the gun almost every message was about the garden almost every message was about amen power and speaking and the spoken word and anointing in same man somebody adam departed unto them great possessions same man somebody the word is breaking this morning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he departed unto them great possessions they might seem like much to you and i but those stories told of a redemption those stories were told about how man was to come back to this spot hallelujah to come back to this mountain to worship god in his trueness and his fullness in his likeness and his being oh my hallelujah adam cain and abel they were given great possessions and he and they come a time when god say okay you've heard enough word you've heard enough messages preach you man you've been in service every sunday that's good wonderful all right now let me hear what you have to say or larry here rather your fruits based on what is being spoken here i want to see what you have to offer me and here come cain with his fruits after hearing every message all these messages message after message word after word inspiration after inspiration here come cane with fruits what a situation and they were natural fruits now to you and i they would look like good things some grapes here a little apple there something nice to look at something pleasant to taste but god rejected that thing because they were not about god they were not they were not the product of what adam was trying to present to them all along that wasn't what what god was looking for god was looking for wasn't looking for cain's natural ability god wasn't looking for cain's commonness god was looking for cain's hard work and and and and you know this kind of thing natural things no no no no he was looking for something deeper than that say amen somebody and here come abel brought a more excellent sacrifice than king hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh he had a revelation oh that this thing wasn't about him but that he took a sacrifice a sacrifice a sacrifice to bring him back into the presence of god that was a fruit oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that was a fruit of his revelation isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah and god loved it oh hallelujah god sanctified that thing holiday in the eyes of all why hallelujah because it was the right kind of fruit it was profitable it was fruitful god loves that fruitful thing isn't that right he told cain he said if you do like your brother do i'll bless you if you obey obedience hallelujah if you do what he does i'll bless you too praise god hallelujah isn't that right amen so god loves that fruitful thing isn't that right hallelujah he said be fruitful multiply and replenish isn't that right amen hallelujah so that's what the message was sent for to produce the life of christ isn't that right i saw this message of malachi 4 was sent for isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah to produce a life holly you have to live it honey brother brown said you might preach all the messages but live your sermons oh hallelujah live something that the people could see god in you the people could see god in me oh hallelujah oh what jeffersonville needs today is thousands of live voices that's the thunder that'll shake the devil that's the fruits hallelujah that get the devil all riled up when you begin to live something when you're going to add to your faith virtue and to your virtue knowledge and to your knowledge temperance when god is being formed in you then watch the persecution set in same man somebody hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah satan was all right with mary being uh whatever she was a housewife or a handmaiden he was all right did mary be in that but as soon as mary was ready to produce christ as soon as something was about to come on the scene watch the persecution begin to set in watch trouble set on every hand something was going to come forth and the satan is going to do all he can to cut that thing off hallelujah when mary was predestinated to bring forth jesus christ in her hour her season she said i only want to know one thing how shall this thing be how shall this food be multiplied in me hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hell and the angel said the word hallelujah that anointing is going to come over you ain't many men only messiah is going to be formed in you isn't that right and she got to running she got to screaming she went immediately to go and tell elizabeth what was about to happen what was about to take place she began to testify the fruit of her lips oh hallelujah praise god oh hallelujah that holy thing will be formed in be called jesus christ the son of god isn't that right emmanuel god with us oh do you love him this morning my god my god are you enjoying the word i know i am hey man this is great this is the greatest thing i've ever seen oh my god eating good amen amen second peter one four four through seven out of eight virtue isn't that right it says if these things be up in you and abound they make you what that you need to be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ amen remember he the lack of these things is blind and cannot see afar off and have forgotten that he was pushed from his own sins isn't that right hallelujah so you have to produce something hallelujah you can't go to god on the judgement day and say i sat in church and i clapped and i jumped and shouted hallelujah isn't that right bible says many were coming that day i'd say lord lord and they won't enter in lord didn't i cast out devils in your name no didn't i do this and do that and you say depart from me you workers of iniquity i knew you know i know you're not isn't that right hallelujah but those who have a relationship with him those who are connected to the true vine those branches who are connected to the father those are the ones that will enter in oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah come on now amen isn't that right okay hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah god wants your life to bring forth something isn't that right hallelujah so when you speak of fruits now we're not speaking of natural fruits like what cane bro or if you could speak in the fruits of the spirit isn't that right hallelujah praise god isn't that right amen we think about a man called john john the baptist isn't that right and he come forth hallelujah isn't that right out of the wilderness nobody knows who this man was amen strange looking man hallelujah eating locals and wild honey a weird fella even his name was john set apart from all the other prophets isn't that right whatever talk about all the time amen a different man a man at a different kind of a ministry what was he sent for to prepare the way of the lord isn't that right to prepare for messiah to come hallelujah and he was baptizing amen only isn't that right in the name of the father son holy ghost waiting for that one to come down hallelujah and announce himself among them hallelujah isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah so john baptizing in the river isn't that right and what did he say he said he acts his laid to the root of every tree he said you better bring forth fruit onto repentance hallelujah isn't that right hey many men you're not going to just sit around in this church here and say you're going to get baptized and say you're going to be saved and say you're going to do nice things no no no no you better bring forth fruit inside of here hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah get to crying get to get this uh amen hallelujah amen amen get to producing hallelujah hallelujah he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him you have to be diligent about the kingdom hallelujah you have to be focused about it you can't let anything throw you off you can't let anything shake you you can't let anything pull you down isn't that right honolulu you have to say single eye and single motive hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right that's what elijah was it wasn't good for him no more to be in his condition hallelujah he was willing to go all the way all the way no matter what it took holla to go up high mountains or go down low valleys he was willing to go the distance because he was not satisfied with an unfruitful life same man somebody he was not satisfied with an unprofitable life he's wanted his life to produce the same things that he seemed produced to elijah elijah wanted his life to produce those same signs he wanted his life to produce those same wonders he wanted his life to produce the same miracles he saw himself walking in them same footprints oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah jesus said great jesus said greater than these shall you do because i go unto my father there's a promise over you this morning to do the same work that he did to walk the way that he walked only the bride hallelujah isn't that right god walk in those bloody footprints hallelujah hallelujah so take up your cross this morning and come and let's follow jesus let's follow hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah oh hallelujah jesus don't want no halfway fruit always talk about halfway corn bobo corn nobody likes that nobody will boil that nobody will eat that you don't even want to look at that you toss that away throw it away in a trash can in a dump in a garbage truck you don't want that thing a god don't want no halfway fruit come on now you heard too much you experienced too much to bring forth halfway through in this hour and this season no no no no god is not halfway hallelujah god is total complete and whole isn't that right god is a hundred percent and he's looking for you from you a hundred percent to whom much is given much is expected same and somebody hallelujah so we can't afford to be lazy come on now we gotta be diligent we gotta be working hallelujah hallelujah come on now not about church anymore it's about individuals taking their position taking up their position in christ recognizing who they are hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right and doing what is required of them meeting the requirements i love that word requirement a requirement is something you have to meet in trinidad we like a lot of halfway things i want a job well you go by somebody who you know works there and then you ask for a little passage and then you talk to them a little bit no interview no required papers you just go in you talk to this guy that you know you get a job that's how to think that's how things work and turn it out sometimes don't you know it but god that's not the way god works god has no windows he has no holes he has no little tunnels that we could just dig our way through yeah i have to come through the door jesus said i am the door to go into the barn to go into the shipyard you have to go through the door he said any man come any other way he's a thief and the same as a robber shame and somebody said i am the door i am the way i am the truth i am the life no man shall see the father unless he come through me how do you come through me after your faith virtue after your virtue knowledge until your knowledge tempers and tempers patience same and somebody hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah my god come on god is not halfway god didn't go halfway up calvary the scriptures would read a little different you didn't just go halfway and say well all right you know wow calvary boy that's it well you know thanks a lot brian thanks for the three and a half years i'm gone no he said lord if it's possible let this cup pass from me but not my will but thy will be done he suffered it harley suffered it to be so hard that the scriptures be fulfilled he denied himself he took up his cross and he did what he had to do bride of christ we have to deny ourselves take up our cross do what we have to do in this hour in this season because there's no more time left time is running out time is running out on foolishness time is running out on the game playing time is running out i'm just coming to church coming to church one day there'll be no more church to come to we won't always have this all the time

all the way through the suffrage holly he said crying out for me hallelujah weep not for me he said we put your children he was gone about to do something hallelujah he was gonna bring about a redemption story he was gonna bring back man hallelujah back to his image of power back to an image of glory bring fallen man back into a place that he wanted him at the beginning isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah in a position of fruitfulness hallelujah that's where you were hallelujah in the beginning before the beginning isn't that right and satan tried to cut you off and he was trying to cut off christ again hallelujah but not this time he went up called gotham's hill while he paid that price the blood flowing from him but he went up there anyhow he went up there for you he went up there for me oh he went all the way can't you go all the way for him this morning can't you forget about yourself forget about your laziness put away your slothfulness and go up call goddess hill this morning go after your debt and calvary virtue powers here this morning to drive you to calvary and then to the rapture hallelujah hallelujah oh praise god it's not right unless a corner we'd fall into the crown and die and abide alone hallelujah it's not good enough for you to say that you are seed of god that seed has to go in the ground and die and bring forth more seeds much seeds much fruit hallelujah hallelujah coming to church is not good enough you have to receive the holy ghost it is imperative it is a must be you have to meet that requirement the holy ghost to come upon you and to baptize that seed in your soul hallelujah that the life of christ could begin to come forth oh you have to want it you have to need it oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you have to warn the holy ghost you have to recognize your condition the man of the gate called beautiful didn't recognize his condition he was born that way as far as the bible says isn't that right he's accustomed asking for
