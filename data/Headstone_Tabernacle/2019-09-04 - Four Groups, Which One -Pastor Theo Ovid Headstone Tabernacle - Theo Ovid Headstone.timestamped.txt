[10:52] and I beheld till the thrones were cast
[10:55] down and the Ancient of Days did sit
[10:58] whose garment was white as snow and the
[11:01] hair of his head was like the pure wool
[11:05] his throne was like the fiery flame its
[11:07] wheels as burning fire fiery stream
[11:11] issued came forth from him thousand
[11:15] thousands ministered unto him and ten
[11:18] thousands thank ten thousand stood
[11:19] before him the judgment was set and the
[11:23] books were opened
[11:25] matches up to 25 we read one two four
[11:29] and then we go down to his 31 then shall
[11:32] the Kingdom of Heaven be likened unto
[11:33] ten virgins which took their lamps went
[11:36] forth to meet the burglar five of them
[11:38] were wise five of foolish they that were
[11:41] foolish took their lamps but took no oil
[11:43] with them
[11:44] but wise took oil in the lamps with
[11:48] their with their vessels with their
[11:50] lamps we go over the verse 31 of that
[11:54] same chapter when the Son of man shall
[11:56] come in his glory and all the holy
[11:57] angels with him then shall he sit upon
[12:01] the tune of his glory and before him
[12:03] shall be gathered all nations and he
[12:05] shall separate them one from another as
[12:08] a shepherd as a shepherd divideth his
[12:10] sheep from the goats he shall set the
[12:13] sheep on his right hand the goats on the
[12:17] left then shall the King say unto them
[12:19] on his right hand come ye blessed of my
[12:22] father inherit the kingdom prepared for
[12:24] you from the foundation of the world for
[12:27] I was a hungered and you gave me meat I

[12:32] stranger you took me in naked and he
[12:34] clothed me I was sick you visited me I
[12:36] was in prison you came unto me then
[12:39] shall the righteous answer him saying
[12:41] Lord when saw we thee an hungred and fed
[12:46] thee or thirsty or give thee drink when
[12:49] so he a stranger and took him and naked
[12:53] and clothed thee or when saw we sick or
[12:55] in prison and came unto thee and the
[12:58] King shall Hanson see entered them
[13:00] verily I say unto you and as much as you
[13:02] have done it unto one of the least of
[13:04] these my brethren you have done it unto
[13:07] me
[13:08] then shall ye see unto them on the left
[13:11] hand depart from me ye cursed into
[13:13] everlasting fire prepared for the devil
[13:16] and his angels if I was hungered and you
[13:19] give me no meat I was to steal you give
[13:21] me no drink I was a stranger you took me
[13:23] not in naked you clothed me not sick and

[13:36] deep then shadi answered saying verily I
[13:39] sent to you in as much as you did it not
[13:41] to one of these least of these you did
[13:43] it not to me and these shall go away
[13:46] into everlasting punishment but the
[13:48] righteous under life it
[13:50] our script final scripture revolution
[13:53] chapter 13 verse 8 and all dwell upon
[13:55] the earth shall worship Him whose names
[13:57] are not written in the book of the life
[13:59] of the lamb slain from the foundation of
[14:01] the world may God bless his word you may
[14:03] be seated
[14:04] praise the Lord I really wish I wishes
[14:20] on my Sunday I don't know why I'm bricks
[14:22] nice tonight
[14:23] but this is really feel like a Sunday
[14:26] message this is not heavy but with what
[14:35] brainer so this is the title for groups
[14:38] which one do you ready identifying for
[14:43] groups so I want you to coffee huge mask

[15:04] see tonight so it's not groups it's not
[15:06] it's not churches is not any message
[15:09] anybody but a brand I know is not that
[15:10] is what God said in this our yellow
[15:13] remember the kingdom of heaven is like
[15:17] none to these virgins 500 wise five were
[15:19] foolish which group you in the wise got
[15:24] oil the foolish
[15:27] did not get oil what cooked in what
[15:31] group you want to be because some point
[15:34] two times somebody had to get people I
[15:35] get desperate the most want to know that
[15:39] they line up with the scriptures the
[15:42] people either say what side you're on
[15:43] what good hooped you in what church you
[15:45] in this is not this is different now
[15:47] little bit different now he said you
[15:50] know if we live in the end time is the
[15:51] age that the churches are going to come
[15:53] together and as even now controlling
[15:56] wolf
[15:56] things they will soon control the
[15:59] finances of the world then if you don't
[16:03] belong to the World Organization of
[16:05] Churches you won't be able to buy or to
[16:07] sell you would lose all now these are
[16:12] weighted words tonight they say you
[16:15] would lose all those who stay true to
[16:18] God and keep their garments clean from
[16:21] the file Mentalist 'm of church orders
[16:24] will be physically bereft there will be
[16:27] presented to them a great temptation to
[16:30] give him
[16:32] preachers will give in with the excuse
[16:35] that they will serve God within the
[16:37] framework of the Antichrist B's system
[16:40] they will give in to the flatteries and
[16:43] the blandishments of the hierarchy but
[16:45] the people will follow these false
[16:47] shepherds right into the slaughter but
[16:50] in the Judgment Day
[16:51] they will be found naked they will not
[16:53] be given microbes neither will they walk
[16:56] with him you can't walk in spotted
[16:58] garments of the world holding their
[17:00] hands with the devil here and then
[17:02] expect to be with God it is time to wake
[17:05] up and hear the voice of God crying come
[17:09] out of her organisation religion and my
[17:11] people that you be not partakers of her
[17:14] sins God is speaking shun the religions
[17:18] of this world like a shunned a plague
[17:20] leave off walking with the world and
[17:22] make a garments white by repentance and
[17:26] the better than do it no for tomorrow
[17:29] might be too late
[17:30] Oh glory to God he that overcometh I
[17:34] will not blot out his name out of the
[17:35] book of life hallelujah let's continue
[17:40] the possibility of the removal of a name
[17:43] from the records of God deserves more
[17:46] than a casual study for up until now
[17:49] more students have nearly drawn a
[17:53] conclusion that God places the names of
[17:56] those born again within the Lamb's Book
[17:59] of Life at the time of the rebirth and
[18:01] if for any reason that name must be
[18:03] removed
[18:04] this is on-the-record will simply be
[18:07] blank as it was before Neymar be pleased
[18:10] there
[18:11] this is 100% opposite to what the wood
[18:15] actually teaches at the very start of
[18:18] our study let it be known that there is
[18:21] not one scripture that teaches that God
[18:24] is presently compiling a record of names
[18:27] this was all done before the foundation
[18:30] of the world
[18:31] after we pointed out shortly it's not a
[18:34] question of simply involving ourselves
[18:35] with two groups of people both of whom
[18:37] had the opportunity to receive it in a
[18:40] life where when one group received it
[18:42] and had their names placed on record and
[18:44] the others who refused it didn't have
[18:47] their name so placed we will actually
[18:49] show by scripture that multi-tools were
[18:52] not even born again will point it in a
[18:55] life aha that's a big one multitudes
[19:02] will go on that are not even born again
[19:06] and get eternal life what is a big thing
[19:10] tonight this is not screaming tonight
[19:12] right we will also show that there's a
[19:16] group of people whose me haven't been
[19:20] placed on that record before the phone
[19:23] in the world cannot under any
[19:26] circumstances have those name removed
[19:29] [Applause]
[19:31] and we will also show that another group
[19:35] whose names are on that record before
[19:37] the foundation will have their name
[19:39] removed to begin with there's no basis
[19:42] for the claim that the Lamb's Book of
[19:44] Life is not the same as the book of life
[19:46] the book of life might be called the
[19:47] Lamb's Book of Life or Christ's book of
[19:49] life or even died book or the book of
[19:51] the living only names are written on it
[19:52] and the scripture he says quote
[19:55] revelation 13:8 all that dwell upon the
[19:57] earth shall worship Him the Beast whose
[19:59] names are not written in the book of
[20:01] life of the lamb slain from the
[20:03] foundation of the world revelation 20:12
[20:06] the 15 I saw the dead small and great
[20:08] stand before God and the books were
[20:11] opened and another book was opened which
[20:12] is the book of life and the dead were
[20:14] judged out of those things which are
[20:16] written in the
[20:16] according to their works under sea gave
[20:19] up the Dead which were in it and death
[20:21] and he'll but delivered up the Dead
[20:22] which were in them and they were judged
[20:24] every man according to their works and
[20:26] death and he'll were cast into the lake
[20:28] of fire this is the second death many
[20:31] people don't even know there's a second
[20:33] death the first that is easy but every
[20:36] man that has died will be resurrected to
[20:40] be judged Oh hallelujah oh yeah tango
[20:44] tonight for the blood you thank God for
[20:46] Jesus pin and accepting your judgment
[20:49] and my judgment and upon himself dying
[20:52] on the cross that we could go free
[20:54] tonight that's why you should worship
[20:57] Him that's why you should give him
[20:58] praise that's why you should never come
[21:01] in the hopes of God with herself but the
[21:03] frong with any bad attitude or glory to
[21:07] God hallelujah you can see that door
[21:13] there are other books mentioned there is
[21:15] always the reference to one book
[21:17] container names it has caused the Lamb
[21:20] book of life or the book of life then
[21:24] where is this book located scripture
[21:27] Luke 10 17 to 24 hundred centimeters
[21:29] with joy sin Lord even the Devils are
[21:32] subject unto us should I name he said
[21:35] unto them I beheld Satan as lightning
[21:36] fall from heaven behold I give you power
[21:39] to tread on serpents and scorpions and
[21:41] over all the power of the enemy and
[21:43] nothing shall by any means hurt you
[21:45] notwithstanding and this rejoice not
[21:47] that the spirits are subject unto you
[21:49] but rather rejoice because your name are
[21:52] written in heaven or glory the Gordon
[21:54] that always Jesus rejoice in the spirit
[21:57] and said I thank thee O Father Lord of
[22:00] Heaven and Earth that I was hid these
[22:02] things from the wise and the prudent and
[22:05] as we filled them unto babes such as
[22:07] well
[22:08] Alleluia even so father it seemed good
[22:11] in thy sight oh there's a lot of shout
[22:14] hallelujah so this book of life is
[22:18] located in heaven and will appear the
[22:20] white throne judgment in these verses
[22:23] jesus said the names were written in
[22:25] heaven they were written in the book
[22:27] though rejoice because they were subject
[22:29] unto you but rejoice because your name
[22:31] is in heaven
[22:32] that's why if you know your name is in
[22:34] heaven if you know your name is written
[22:36] every service should be rejoicing just
[22:39] to have the opportunity do not worship
[22:42] in the beasts you're not worshiping some
[22:44] false prophet
[22:45] you're not worship in this world system
[22:47] or give the Lord a shout no wonder he
[22:51] said random seven thunders come forth
[22:53] then you'll be worshiping the Living
[22:55] Christ moving in and out among us but
[22:58] are we are fighting for every promise
[23:00] that God promised in this hour all glory
[23:04] to God amen hallelujah praise God
[23:08] hallelujah praise God praise God no
[23:13] notice hallelujah
[23:15] Childress was one of those who were cast
[23:17] no Devils in Jesus name and we know that
[23:19] he was a devil son of perdition and
[23:22] Jesus said he that watcheth need not
[23:24] wash his feet but his clean every whit
[23:26] but you are crema not all but you who
[23:28] would betray him therefore he said
[23:30] you're not all clean I speak not of you
[23:33] all I know whom I have chosen and the
[23:35] study scripture may be fulfilled
[23:37] these are it had bread with me I lifted
[23:39] up his heel heel against me
[23:41] now if language means anything we must
[23:45] admit that Judas was chosen by Jesus yet
[23:49] he was not clean
[23:50] Oh glory to God hallelujah Judas was
[23:54] also given to Jesus by the father
[23:57] hallelujah notice that given is the
[24:01] exact parallel as the illustration of
[24:03] Moses and Pharaoh Jacob and Esau the
[24:06] eastern Pharaoh Abbas for known they
[24:08] were predestinated a rat
[24:10] both will reproduce and elect even to
[24:15] them but stumble at the word being
[24:16] disobedient
[24:17] Judas was numbered with the twelve and
[24:20] actually had a pact with them in the
[24:22] ministry previous the Pentecost
[24:25] or glory to God so those faithful
[24:28] ministry fight to be the bride come on
[24:31] give the Lord a show get the Lord on
[24:33] show this everybody should be caught up
[24:36] about that
[24:37] the faithful ministry tried to be
[24:40] prophetess bride because the Ancient of
[24:45] Days haul them posters ten thousand
[24:47] thousand like the bride
[24:49] Oh glory to God with the demon forget
[24:55] the loss now Jesus and his prey or glory
[24:59] to God let's continue my ox 117 men on
[25:04] bridge in descriptive as needed
[25:05] fulfilled which the holy would by the
[25:07] most of the image speak and he was
[25:09] numbered with us and an obtained part of
[25:11] this ministry
[25:12] the part that Judas obtained among the
[25:15] twelve and then lost was neither
[25:17] inferior to the ministry of the other
[25:20] level no was it a devilish foreign
[25:23] ministry interjected among the ministry
[25:26] of the others so he was anointed and
[25:31] commissioned or give the Lord I shall do
[25:35] you feel like moving on tonight that he
[25:38] may take part in this ministry and
[25:40] Apostleship from which Judas by
[25:43] transgression fell that he might go to
[25:45] his own place Judas had ever lost a
[25:49] court given Holy Ghost ministry and kill
[25:52] themselves and went his own place his
[25:54] name was even in the book of life his
[25:56] name was blotted out there are four
[25:59] groups all glory to God you have to be
[26:02] identified with one you have to be
[26:04] connected at one there's a word pride
[26:07] that is revised version or glory to God
[26:10] as the foolish virgins second

[27:26] another chance
[27:28] [Applause]
[27:28] [Music]
[27:29] [Applause]
[27:32] just continue there will be both the
[27:39] righteous and the unrighteous in this
[27:42] judgment these righteous will not be the
[27:46] bride for the bride system and judgment
[27:49] [Music]
[27:51] stop rewind but over the mean the brain
[27:54] will be part of the judgment yes he have
[27:59] a script a faith first corinthians 6:2
[28:00] two and three do you know the scenes
[28:02] adjust the world and if the world shall
[28:05] be judged by you are you unworthy to
[28:07] judge the smallest matters know you not
[28:10] that you shall judge angels how much
[28:12] more things that pertain to this life
[28:15] not a scripture relation 3:21 taemin
[28:18] overcometh will I grant to sit with me
[28:19] in my throne even as I overcame an
[28:22] Isetta what my father his strong see the
[28:25] bride is written in a strong and she is
[28:29] to judge the world she was to be sitting
[28:31] in judgment that's what Daniel saw
[28:34] Oh glory to God hallelujah and he caught
[28:39] descriptively red I beheld until the
[28:41] trauma cast down and the engines of
[28:43] these did sit whose garment was white as
[28:46] snow
[28:47] Oh glory to God hallelujah so you are a
[28:52] big statement to make now only the bride
[28:54] alone qualifies for the first
[28:57] resurrection or glory of God bless her
[29:00] that day that comfort in the first
[29:02] resurrection only the bride all the
[29:07] bride electors go along in the ground
[29:09] they come into the first resurrection
[29:12] everybody has have to wait for the
[29:14] second resurrection but there's to be
[29:16] elected bride coming forth in the first
[29:18] resurrection he's not excited tonight is
[29:30] another exciting tonight it's going to
[29:33] be a resurrection I want to be when the
[29:41] same school or give the Lord a shout
[29:46] when the saints go marching in
[29:49] hallelujah hallelujah was continued the
[29:54] question arises why are these righteous
[29:58] ones in judgment there is no other place
[30:01] they can come in for they are not - they
[30:04] are just for two resurrections and since
[30:07] they could not qualify for the first
[30:10] resurrection they must come in the
[30:12] second resurrection unto judgment so the
[30:18] second resurrection is a resurrection of
[30:21] the judgment not the first one because
[30:24] the bride already judged in Christ Jesus
[30:27] the bride will not be judged the bride
[30:30] cannot be judge she will be with the
[30:32] judge okay the Lord has shown the
[30:34] bridles justified
[30:36] [Applause]
[30:38] did you hear that the bride is justified
[30:42] as if she never did it in the first
[30:46] [Applause]
[30:49] hallelujah study Muslim abyss and
[30:56] resurrection the ones who qualify for
[30:58] the first resurrection is the bride and
[31:00] I'm not in judgment and he could have
[31:03] scripted for at the back adoption John
[31:05] 5:24 fairy lights unto you he that
[31:07] heareth my will that believe on him that
[31:08] sent me hath everlasting life which is a
[31:11] believer a recipient of eternal life he
[31:13] is a possession of it right now and
[31:15] shall not come into judgment hallelujah
[31:19] but is passed from death unto life
[31:21] so Jesus must have yet another in mind a
[31:26] certain resurrection will receive
[31:28] eternal life they will receive it at
[31:31] that resurrection not having previously
[31:34] as a member of the bride and to prove
[31:37] that he ever scripture for that John
[31:40] 5:22 29 marvel at this for the hour is
[31:44] coming this is Jesus in which all data
[31:47] in the graves shall hear his voice all
[31:51] all and shall come forth
[31:54] neither have done good unto the
[31:57] resurrection of life and they that have
[31:59] done evil unto the resurrection of
[32:01] damnation but all could hear that voice
[32:04] and to thankful to God tonight that you
[32:07] hearing the voice of God in the last
[32:09] years or glory of God you hear in his
[32:13] voice no you hearing a word of the
[32:15] Spirit
[32:15] no God speaking to you know because the
[32:19] ability to hear I read from Clarke give
[32:24] the Lord a shout
[32:26] [Applause]
[32:32] you as he left have the ability from God
[32:38] or glory to God you are hearing from God
[32:41] tonight because God is the word
[32:44] [Applause]
[32:45] understand receive the word you came
[32:47] from God that's the ability that God put
[32:51] in the leg hallelujah we all know that
[32:56] John 5:22 29 is not the rapture I just
[33:00] hope you just read for only the dead in
[33:03] Christ shall arise on the graves at the
[33:05] time along with the Living bride who
[33:07] still sits on the earth let's see about
[33:09] the scripture we just read Marvel not
[33:11] that this for the always come in which
[33:13] all that are in the graves shall hear
[33:16] his voice and shall come for dinner of
[33:18] good or the resurrection of life
[33:20] they'll have done evil unto the resident
[33:22] our nation that nothing rapture there's
[33:24] not a rupture the rapture is 1st
[33:26] Thessalonians 4 for the Lord Himself
[33:29] shuts in for me with a shout and the
[33:31] voice of the Archangel and with the
[33:34] Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[33:37] shall rise first and we which are alive
[33:41] and remain shall be caught up together
[33:44] with them in the clouds to meet the lord
[33:46] in the air or there's a lot of shock
[33:50] hallelujah glory to God amen hallelujah
[33:56] let me get a lot of shots again because
[34:00] you wanna be caught up to meet him
[34:02] you are gonna be changed in a moment in
[34:05] a pickle of an eye I believe that I'm
[34:09] gonna preach that oh praise God praise
[34:11] God hallelujah you may be seated we now
[34:20] face the question as to why this should
[34:23] be given eternal life at the judgment
[34:26] since the epistles seem to conclusively
[34:31] point out that one must possess the
[34:33] Spirit of Christ or perish though it
[34:37] seemed us we must not discredit the
[34:40] words of Jesus who most pointedly sets
[34:43] forth that there are some found in the
[34:46] book of life who will either receive
[34:48] eternal life before the general
[34:51] resurrection or after it Paul does not
[34:54] evade this truth for he clearly says in
[34:57] Philippians 3 level is by any means I
[34:59] might attain the resurrection of the
[35:02] dead now this statement is very peculiar
[35:05] we all know and we are all going to be
[35:08] in a resurrection whether we want to be
[35:10] or not all will be resurrected so Paul
[35:15] could hardly be seen is by any means I
[35:18] might attain a resurrection of the dead
[35:21] the truth of the matter is he's not
[35:23] seeing that the literal realness
[35:25] if by any means I might attain to the
[35:29] out resurrection from among the dead
[35:32] this is not the attaining to the general
[35:35] or seven second resurrection but attend
[35:38] to the first resurrection and which he
[35:40] said blessed and holy is he who had
[35:42] passed in the first resurrection on such
[35:44] the second death no power or glory to
[35:48] God hallelujah praise God
[35:51] don't you feel inspired tonight
[35:53] all glory to God hallelujah hallelujah
[35:56] oh praise God let's continue he said no
[35:59] but he shall be like priests of God and
[36:01] Christ shall reign with him a thousand
[36:03] years the first resurrection has nothing
[36:06] to do with the second left that is at
[36:08] the end of a thousand years when all the
[36:10] rest of the Dead live again and in that
[36:12] day there will be those who come forward
[36:14] to eternal life and those others who are
[36:16] caught in the second death no we do not
[36:18] need to guess about those who are in the
[36:20] second resurrection are given life we
[36:22] are told it is given to them on the
[36:25] grounds that they are being kind and
[36:28] good to the Brethren this is something
[36:34] worthwhile noting a long time I've heard
[36:37] this but this is some type something
[36:39] with Van Noten we are told it is given
[36:42] to them on the grounds they are being
[36:44] kind and good to the Brethren those who
[36:47] are raised and cast a lake of fire will
[36:49] be so treated because of their
[36:51] mistreatment of the bedroom or everybody
[37:02] [Applause]
[37:06] never heard that before
[37:08] just a minute now Oh glory to God amen
[37:13] hallelujah since this is the word of the
[37:21] Lord we simply accepted there is no
[37:24] argument here just a simple statement of
[37:27] fact we read the scripture when Jesus
[37:31] fasted eternal life he said when I was
[37:33] hungry you feed me when I was naked you
[37:35] clothed me and they say but when we do
[37:37] that he said when you do they literally
[37:39] Lisa them UT system to me Oh hallelujah
[37:43] or glory to God hallelujah praise God
[37:47] the rest was the direct opposite let's
[37:49] continue the further clarify notice
[37:54] specifically go on alike that porn
[38:03] the words as Matthew 25:31 246 which is
[38:05] what you read it does not see that a
[38:08] shepherd is literally separating sheep
[38:11] from goats but it is as a shepherd
[38:14] dividing sheep from goats
[38:15] these are not sheep in this particular
[38:18] area of time y2 and judgment the sheep
[38:20] are already in his fold they heard his
[38:23] voice they followed him they already
[38:26] have eternal life and he are not come
[38:28] into judgment but these do not have it
[38:33] in life they are in judgment they are
[38:36] allowed to go into eternal life but upon
[38:40] what grounds to the enter into life
[38:41] eternal
[38:42] certainly not upon the fact that they
[38:44] already have this life as does the bride
[38:46] but they receive it because it was time
[38:49] to his brethren they are not his
[38:51] brethren
[38:52] that will make them join us with Jesus
[38:54] they are not asked to anything but life
[38:58] they share not role except over him
[39:01] their names must have been in the book
[39:03] of life and not removed but because of
[39:06] the love of the people of God they are
[39:09] recognized and saved oh man so no you
[39:15] know who you are I know you know people
[39:17] gonna treat you based upon who you are I
[39:20] will be saved and receive eternal life
[39:22] because of who you are okay the Lord a
[39:25] shout it's the death know who you are
[39:27] you better know who you are tonight Oh
[39:29] glory to God you are mrs. Jesus Christ
[39:33] I'll give the Lord a show scallywag
[39:35] sinner somewhere he put your name on the
[39:38] book he said mark I thought to call you
[39:40] out
[39:45] let's continue cause of their love of
[39:49] the people of God they are recognized
[39:51] and save no doubt these save that help
[39:53] the chin of God perhaps like Nicodemus
[39:56] and Gamaliel they stood for the cheer in
[39:58] a time of trouble it's this seem smack
[40:01] of restoration watch carefully now for
[40:03] the wicked and not restored but turn
[40:06] into the lake of fire the names of many
[40:09] of those destroyed were in the book of
[40:10] life also
[40:11] but they were blotted out because they
[40:13] fail to honor the people of God who are
[40:17] the Living manifested word living
[40:20] epistle for their day oh you mean the
[40:23] bride could be the living manifested for
[40:26] this day your meal is not walking wrong
[40:28] with the book and escape and say what
[40:30] you believe but it has to be the
[40:33] individual oh my god I believe that you
[40:51] know or you have except the other group
[40:58] if you don't want to accept that you
[41:01] have to become the Word made flesh then
[41:03] you have to find the next group you
[41:05] never said I know my group keeps
[41:07] spinning and see if you find a group
[41:08] it's only for it not 24 you know just
[41:13] for so you could pick which one that's
[41:17] what they want now what type it so which
[41:18] one now let's be clear here these are
[41:23] not Nations being judged and going to
[41:26] the Millenium because they have harbored
[41:27] and at the Jews this is very clear
[41:30] because of the conclusion of these
[41:31] verses that these do wicked shall go
[41:34] into everlasting punishment but the
[41:35] righteous into everlasting life there is
[41:37] no record of two judgments set whether
[41:40] wicked a cast on a lake of fire only the
[41:42] beast and the false prophet at the judge
[41:46] at the end of the Great Tribulation this
[41:49] is the white throne judgment and they
[41:51] are judged according to what's written
[41:53] in the book
[41:54] in the second recollection that's the
[41:57] souls under the altar that's in the
[41:59] fifth seal them coming second
[42:01] resurrection the carbonyl Lord voice how
[42:03] long Lord how long does not judge and
[42:05] avenge our blood these Jews under this
[42:07] altar we know that note particularly
[42:09] that none of these under the altar were
[42:11] killed for the testimony of Jesus they
[42:13] were not like Antipas who was slain for
[42:14] holding his fascist name these are not
[42:16] born again one with its in life as their
[42:18] possession they come in the resurrection
[42:20] and receive life because of their stand
[42:22] on the word notice how these are crying
[42:25] for vengeance they cannot be bright
[42:27] material that speaks volume they then
[42:38] choose cannon for vengeance he said
[42:40] dynapac material so any person in this
[42:42] message I never vengeance you know we're
[42:44] on it
[42:44] you know equipped in rank then not in
[42:47] this bright group because the bride
[42:49] don't call for vengeance is mine saith
[42:53] the Lord I will repair the break your
[42:56] contract the bride will turn the other
[42:58] cheek give the Lord a show
[43:01] [Applause]
[43:02] [Music]
[43:04] [Applause]
[43:11] [Music]
[43:19] the bright the bright
[43:22] turn-the-other-cheek they have to
[43:23] because they are they have to watch so
[43:26] these Jews and born of the Spirit they
[43:29] don't even believe that Jesus is Messiah
[43:30] but they were blinded by God for the
[43:32] Gentiles seek God give them eternal life
[43:35] on the grounds that though they could
[43:37] not come to him they were truly faithful
[43:39] to all the world the new and died under
[43:45] Stalin and Hitler and yet they will die
[43:48] it is the second resurrection where in
[43:50] the five foolish virgins to come up oh
[43:54] my goodness this five foolish virgins
[43:57] mmm incision they not denomination let's
[44:06] continue they they did not have the Holy
[44:10] Spirit so they miss being in the bride
[44:12] while the five wise who had oil became a
[44:15] part of that bride but these people
[44:18] being separated God loving people trying
[44:21] to abide in the world according to what
[44:23] they knew of it and I help in the work
[44:25] of the Lord will come at the end of time
[44:27] they will miss the millennium which you
[44:29] we can begin to see by these truths is
[44:32] more important and wonderful than we
[44:34] ever thought or belief know that ahead
[44:38] at this all I want to miss it that come
[44:40] like have a big banquet downstairs and
[44:42] you go at home to drink water and Dom

[45:19] imagine know when you hit that scripture
[45:21] his wife at bitters already when you

[45:27] all by yourself because you know who
[45:30] your husband is you know who you worship
[45:34] your know by your worship oh my let's
[45:38] continue
[45:38] Oh glory to God hallelujah listen all
[45:44] these people are their names in the book
[45:45] of life and their names remain but whose
[45:48] names did not remain those of the world
[45:50] system churches who fought the bride
[45:54] will be tools whose names are removed
[45:57] that is who will lose out they will be
[46:00] cast into the lake of fire so let's go
[46:04] to another step he said let's review our
[46:05] case thus far let's review these four
[46:08] groups one first of all we know
[46:11] assuredly that the purpose of God stands

[56:00] portion of the word is hard for the
[56:02] human matter grass
[56:06] all this profit is good oh my goodness
[56:10] is this this is good it must be accepted
[56:13] and believed by feet someone be offended
[56:17] by what I have set for it because it
[56:19] feel to understand the sovereignty of
[56:21] God which sets forth that God is God and
[56:25] because He is God one cannot defeat his
[56:27] concerts or thwart his will and purpose
[56:30] but he being omnipotent is ruling in all
[56:34] our fears and is doing whatever he will
[56:37] with all his creation because all were
[56:40] created for his good pleasure therefore
[56:43] Paul said if God should take one lump of
[56:46] clay and make that seem love one vessel
[56:49] unto honor and another vessel unto
[56:51] dishonour who can be offended and cry
[56:54] against him that he has the right to do
[56:57] on the grounds of creation alone we
[57:00] cannot deny he hath he went even further
[57:02] according to Roman's 14 Sam 9 we have
[57:05] the irrefutable proof that Jesus paid
[57:07] the purchase price of the whole world
[57:10] therefore you can do as you will with
[57:12] his own and none of us liveth to himself
[57:18] Norman died himself but wherever we live
[57:20] we live unto the Lord whether we die we
[57:22] die unto the Lord whether we live
[57:24] therefore or die we are the Lord's oh
[57:27] there's a Lord I show you are being
[57:30] purchased
[57:31] you are being bought with a price do you
[57:35] get that tonight you are not your own he
[57:39] paid for you
[57:40] [Applause]
[57:44] [Music]
[57:46] [Applause]
[58:13] [Applause]
[58:16] [Music]
[58:21] [Applause]
[58:28] [Applause]
[58:32] [Music]
[58:32] [Applause]
[58:39] this end Christ both tied and rose and
[58:42] revived but he might be the Lord both of
[58:45] the Dead and the living yes revolution
[58:50] here he said ownership not relationship
[58:51] is meant here he is Lord over the river
[58:55] and the dead not relationship
[58:57] relationship with his bride but honest
[59:00] overall that's why when he speak every
[59:02] man-jack coming up all go be raised from
[59:05] the dead to be judged
[59:06] what poopin you will be in hallelujah
[59:16] hallelujah I'm almost done quote
[59:24] Ephesians that's in the dispensation of
[59:26] the fullness of times he by cards
[59:28] together in one all things in Christ
[59:29] both which have them even him in whom we
[59:33] are obtained inheritance being
[59:34] predestinated according to the purpose
[59:36] of him who worketh all things after the
[59:40] counsel of his own will thus if God so
[59:43] designed that there are those whose
[59:45] names are pleased in the section of the
[59:47] book of life that cannot be raised for
[59:50] the other names of his bride then we
[59:52] must accept it also states that there
[59:55] are those whose names are placed in the
[59:57] record but in the foreknowledge of God
[59:59] they were to fail and have those name
[1:00:01] removed we must accept that and if there
[1:00:04] are those who name up there was those
[1:00:05] who names was never placed on the reckon
[1:00:10] all of life we must accept that also Oh
[1:00:13] hallelujah
[1:00:15] or glory to God my God my God
[1:00:27] let's continue to understand this
[1:00:30] subject raise a cup of it I'm gonna
[1:00:33] close even more clearly it will be wise
[1:00:39] to approach it from the standpoint of
[1:00:41] the church through the ages remember
[1:00:44] sometime I'll talk about conversion and
[1:00:46] people don't want to convert and digest
[1:00:48] again things are literally if you go to
[1:00:51] Mexico you can't use TT dollars the
[1:00:54] other converted to pieces so if you want
[1:00:56] to build the house the materials called
[1:01:01] building materials but around call them
[1:01:03] virtues building materials if you want
[1:01:06] to go into the King's presence they
[1:01:08] become steps you're not building
[1:01:11] materials gwandma the king you have
[1:01:14] seven steps to go up to the king because
[1:01:16] he's only seven step isn't that right if
[1:01:19] you want to see to the edges you need
[1:01:21] eyes so all of a sudden you have seven
[1:01:24] eyes everyone changes here one seven
[1:01:27] horns so is the currency of the
[1:01:30] conversion to what effect that you want
[1:01:33] now you can't preach spirit to preach
[1:01:36] the word and it would tell in the spirit
[1:01:38] now there are three Bibles the zodiac
[1:01:40] this physical Bible and the pyramid but
[1:01:43] you're capricious or yuck you cap which
[1:01:45] pyramid but you can preach the word and
[1:01:47] if this will come into you you have the
[1:01:49] premiere you you have to buy or glory no
[1:01:53] God so brother Branham taking the book
[1:01:56] of life now and he bringing a different
[1:01:58] reference and a point to bring clarity
[1:02:00] to all what I said of these four groups
[1:02:02] are you ready
[1:02:03] just a little more again or another
[1:02:05] finish let's go
[1:02:07] that's what yeah what is he now to
[1:02:11] understand this now we want to consider
[1:02:13] not even Fisher now but the groups
[1:02:15] represented in the church to do this we
[1:02:19] would like the church to the aegis tall
[1:02:21] wheat plant a grain of wheat is planted
[1:02:24] to the end that a single grain of wheat
[1:02:26] will reproduce on
[1:02:27] by itself you are sitting process I'm
[1:02:30] during a certain period of time that
[1:02:32] single seed will die and in time the
[1:02:34] light that was in it will come up into a
[1:02:36] plant which in turn will be the Bureau
[1:02:38] or the carry of that life which is to
[1:02:40] come back to originality in
[1:02:42] multiplatform Jesus the great warrior
[1:02:45] seed died the massless one who is the
[1:02:48] life of the church stands in the myths
[1:02:50] of the Church of all seven Church ages
[1:02:53] given his life to the church
[1:02:55] the carrier or the bearer to the end
[1:02:58] that this very life will be represent
[1:03:00] buddies like unto his in the
[1:03:02] resurrection it is at the resurrection
[1:03:04] that the Royall seed will see many royal
[1:03:08] seeds icon to himself so this is not
[1:03:10] already it the real glory will be ready
[1:03:13] at the resurrection where we shall see
[1:03:15] him like he is and we shall be like him
[1:03:18] okay the Lord I show this miserable
[1:03:21] fresh body like him we put on
[1:03:35] interruption and be a change all glories
[1:03:39] of God let's continue we shall be like
[1:03:42] him no that is what John the Baptist was
[1:03:45] referring to that Jesus will gather the
[1:03:48] wheat into his gonna that was the
[1:03:51] resurrection where the redeemed who had
[1:03:54] been elected into life came in know the
[1:03:57] record of this wheat plant here we go
[1:03:59] whose end is to reproduce the original
[1:04:02] seed in multiplied form is the book of
[1:04:04] life so he is converting it the whole
[1:04:08] wheat plant Gideon are you guessing it
[1:04:10] is the book of life are you with me I
[1:04:13] repeat the history all record of this
[1:04:17] wheat plant is the book of life on which
[1:04:20] a path of the book of life is the record
[1:04:22] of eternal life a section of the book of
[1:04:25] life
[1:04:25] this is convincingly seen by examining
[1:04:28] the wheat plant a seed is sown soon our
[1:04:32] play this scene that is not to beat yet
[1:04:34] it grows into a stock that is not a week
[1:04:36] yet life is there but not to reach
[1:04:39] then at the end of the store is a little
[1:04:41] spike that's another tassel still are we
[1:04:44] plant but no bit yet then the plant is
[1:04:46] pollen eyes we see the chest grow it
[1:04:49] looks mighty and the weak but has not
[1:04:51] yet seed then forms a wheat in the husk
[1:04:53] it is now back to what is all original
[1:04:55] II know the right man read is harvested
[1:04:57] Jesus died almost finish so bear with me
[1:05:01] anybody sleeping just give a big shock
[1:05:03] there's just no sleeping right now we
[1:05:05] almost done all right
[1:05:07] so Jesus Christ died you give his life
[1:05:09] that life was to come back upon the
[1:05:11] church here we go and bring many sons
[1:05:13] like unto himself unto the glory in the
[1:05:16] resurrection but as the wheat seed had
[1:05:19] to have a carrier to bring forth
[1:05:22] multiplied with seed even so it had to
[1:05:25] be a church which would be a carrier of
[1:05:27] the life of Christ
[1:05:29] the blade stop Hasselhoff were the
[1:05:33] carriers for the seed but not to see the
[1:05:36] self so the church cooperate through the
[1:05:39] ages had been a carrier of the true seed
[1:05:42] though not the seed itself that is why
[1:05:44] we can say the book of life is the whole
[1:05:46] wheat plant okay the Lord a shock do you
[1:05:51] catch it tonight let's go over it again
[1:05:54] here is the original seed that was
[1:05:56] planted it produces a bleed that wasn't
[1:05:58] it if it is a store not it either
[1:06:00] he had come husk we to form the tassel
[1:06:03] appears then the pollen falls on
[1:06:04] something on those pistols part of that
[1:06:07] plant is quickened something of the
[1:06:09] original seed came to the rest of the
[1:06:10] plant turns in the seed why didn't the
[1:06:14] whole pan go into seed because it was
[1:06:17] created to that end just part of that
[1:06:21] plant can go back to being seed because
[1:06:24] that part of the wheat plant is eternal
[1:06:27] life wheat
[1:06:28] [Applause]
[1:06:32] do you see it all the other processes
[1:06:36] carriers but that part come back to eat
[1:06:39] is the original grid that's the bad old
[1:06:45] glory to God
[1:06:46] he sent the Prophet the thymus bath
[1:06:49] original faith the original seed the
[1:06:54] original life
[1:06:55] all let's finish off here now all glory
[1:06:58] to God he said you have a perfect type
[1:07:01] Israel even Egypt they came out two
[1:07:03] million strong all escape the
[1:07:05] sacrificial blood all about ties on the
[1:07:07] Red Sea all came out of the water and
[1:07:09] join Holy Spirit manifestation all angel
[1:07:11] food all drunk of the rock yeah except
[1:07:14] for few they were not but carriers all
[1:07:19] Israel is not Israel all but a tiny
[1:07:23] minority and their names were blotted
[1:07:25] out of the book of life we have the same
[1:07:27] thing right in the church names are
[1:07:29] going to be blotted out of the book of
[1:07:31] life
[1:07:32] no names Roberto the book of the eternal
[1:07:35] life for that is another record that
[1:07:38] contained in the book this is the record
[1:07:40] God had given us eternal life and that
[1:07:42] life is in his son
[1:07:44] he's a factor son had the life oh my
[1:07:48] breaking he could come oh my you're
[1:07:51] being a tremendous audience tonight you

[1:07:56] too much for tonight but praise God
[1:07:59] praise God praise God hallelujah in
[1:08:03] conclusion in conclusion lists for this
[1:08:06] time let me further statement that
[1:08:08] armies in the beginning when I said that
[1:08:11] not one scripture spoke the Lord
[1:08:13] presently compiled in a record of names
[1:08:16] that is in deep soul Oh hallelujah
[1:08:19] oh my talk about a roll call he said the
[1:08:22] rapture is not the only roll call the
[1:08:25] rapture will be a roll call

[1:08:29] voice Oh glory
[1:08:32] when he speaks you can take their advice
[1:08:39] about glory goddamn in my mind mind mind
[1:08:47] the rapture is not the only world called
[1:08:50] there's a second resurrection of the
[1:08:51] white one judgment we'll names be
[1:08:53] confessed before the fallen angels and
[1:08:55] I've been told by those who know that
[1:08:57] the sweetest song to a human ear it's a
[1:09:01] song of that person's name how people
[1:09:03] love to have their names before the
[1:09:04] public how they love a clean but no
[1:09:06] little voice will ever song your name as
[1:09:09] sweetly as well the voice of God if your
[1:09:12] name is in the book of life and remains
[1:09:16] there to be revealed before these holy
[1:09:18] angels what a day that will be when we
[1:09:21] are Jesus a father they confess my name
[1:09:24] before men in the days of the earthly
[1:09:27] pilgrimage no I will confess their names
[1:09:29] before thee and all the heavenly angels
[1:09:31] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[1:09:34] the Spirit says to the churches
[1:09:36] once more the spirit had spoken once
[1:09:40] again we have reviewed a record of what
[1:09:42] the Spirit set another age and we have
[1:09:44] found the record correct another age has
[1:09:46] gone by it must fulfill exactly as he
[1:09:48] said it would be what a consolation that
[1:09:50] is to us who hope to be in the last day
[1:09:53] bright for it causes our hearts to leap
[1:09:55] for joy that he is faithful and will
[1:09:58] perform every promise if he was faithful
[1:10:00] and true the doors in his audition age
[1:10:02] then he will be just as true in our age
[1:10:04] if there by His grace and power will
[1:10:07] receive the commandment by EM so will we
[1:10:09] let us go therefore to perfection and
