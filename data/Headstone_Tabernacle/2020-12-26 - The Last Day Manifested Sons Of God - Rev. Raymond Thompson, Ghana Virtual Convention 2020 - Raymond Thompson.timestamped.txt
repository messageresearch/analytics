[33:46] number 17 message of the prophet
[33:50] now just to come through for just a few
[33:53] minutes
[33:55] uh the prophet he
[33:58] he he 14 or seven
[34:01] church ages and position of church ages
[34:04] he said already the visible
[34:06] manifestations
[34:08] of what i am telling you are seen
[34:12] all around us he said
[34:16] this is factual but also it is a fact
[34:20] that the prophet from the last age
[34:23] must bring forth a message from god
[34:27] that will forgive the second coming of
[34:29] the lord
[34:30] for by this message with the hearts of
[34:34] the children
[34:35] be turned back to the pentecostal
[34:37] fathers
[34:38] and strange we said where the
[34:41] restoration of the world
[34:43] will come the restoration of the power
[34:47] so we we had a word a message of
[34:50] restoration
[34:52] leading us back to the original which
[34:55] was
[34:55] variated proven in the days

[36:24] that this was the prophet we live for
[36:27] and he said my enough to see it said i
[36:30] hope i never
[36:31] see it but we are here praise god
[36:35] of manifestation when god
[36:38] will
[36:53] some company was made to avoid
[36:56] but it proved to be justified
[37:00] to carry their life over into the age
[37:04] in which through restoration comes
[37:08] and the reply is manifested in the power
[37:12] of
[37:13] life here 47

[50:43] we see the world falling apart but lord
[50:46] right when it's falling apart god you
[50:48] bring in your pride together
[50:49] lord for a great manifestation of the
[50:52] power of god so we pray lord
[50:55] help us to be in the right condition the
[50:57] right channel
[50:58] in the right inspiration at the time of
[51:00] god so may you lift us up this morning
[51:02] may you bless whatever will be said lord
[51:04] and when we come to the end of the
[51:06] service we won't forget to give you
[51:08] all the honor the praise and the glory
[51:11] for we ask it in the name of the lord
[51:13] jesus
[51:13] christ and the church i'll say the
[51:16] church shall say
[51:19] amen if you have your bibles galatians
[51:22] chapter 4
[51:22] ephesians 1 and romans 8.
[51:28] now i want to say this that the
[51:30] inspiration our brother's inspiration is
[51:32] the manifestation of the sons of god
[51:35] and adoption so if the same scriptures
[51:38] are read
[51:39] and if the same quotes are quote
[51:40] remember then the holy spirit
[51:42] is wanting to emphasize something so
[51:46] i don't know what any other minister's
[51:48] reading what scripture is using
[51:50] but god knows amen so if it is like that
[51:54] remember that god has a purpose is
[51:57] emphasizing something
[51:59] amen galatians
[52:02] chapter four and we read from verse four
[52:06] to seven
[52:09] if you have it say amen
[52:13] but when the fullness of the time was
[52:15] come
[52:16] god sent forth his son made of a woman
[52:20] made under the law to redeem them that
[52:23] were under the law
[52:25] that we might receive the adoption of
[52:28] sons
[52:29] and because he are sons goddess send
[52:32] forth
[52:33] the spirit of his son into your hearts
[52:36] crying our father and abba means my
[52:40] father
[52:41] so you can say my father wherefore thou
[52:44] art no more
[52:45] a servant but a son
[52:48] and if a son then an air
[52:51] of god through christ isn't that
[52:54] beautiful
[52:55] so just go one page over and you get
[52:57] ephesians one
[52:59] my this is my favorite scripture from
[53:02] verse 4
[53:04] if you have it there according that he
[53:06] has chosen us in him before
[53:08] the foundation of the world that we
[53:10] should be holy
[53:11] and without blame before him in love
[53:14] having predestinated us
[53:17] unto the adoption of children by jesus
[53:19] christ
[53:20] to himself according to the good
[53:22] pleasure of his will
[53:24] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[53:27] where in the earth made us accept it in
[53:30] the beloved
[53:31] age the devil hates the scripture man
[53:35] in whom we have redemption through his
[53:38] blood
[53:39] the forgiveness of sins according to the
[53:41] riches of his grace
[53:44] wherein he have abounded
[53:47] to toward us in all wisdom and prudence
[53:52] having made known unto us the mystery of
[53:54] his will
[53:55] according to his good pleasure which he
[53:58] hath purposed
[54:00] in himself my let's get on
[54:03] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[54:06] of times he might gather watch
[54:08] together in in one all things
[54:12] and in in wizard in christ
[54:16] both which are in heaven and which on
[54:19] earth
[54:20] even in him in whom also we have
[54:23] obtained an
[54:24] inheritance being predestinated
[54:26] according to the purpose
[54:28] of him who worketh all things after the
[54:31] council
[54:32] of his own will
[54:35] mind in romans
[54:39] chapter 8 from verse 19.
[54:45] for the earnest expectation of the
[54:47] creature waited for the manifestation
[54:50] of the sons of god for the creature was
[54:53] made subject to vanity
[54:55] not willingly but by reason of him who
[54:58] had subjected the same in hope
[55:01] because the creature itself also shall
[55:03] be delivered
[55:05] from the bondage of corruption into the
[55:08] glorious
[55:09] liberty of the children of god
[55:13] for we know that the whole creation
[55:15] growneth
[55:16] and prevaileth in pain together until
[55:19] now
[55:20] and not only they but ourselves
[55:23] also which have the first fruits of the
[55:26] spirits
[55:27] even ourselves grown within ourselves
[55:30] waiting for the adoption to
[55:34] wit the redemption of
[55:37] our body may the lord the blessing
[55:40] to the reading of his glorious word you
[55:43] may be seated
[55:52] so uh we greet
[55:55] we greet you once again in the precious
[55:57] name of jesus christ
[55:59] it's a mighty name it's a name that make
[56:01] demons tremble
[56:03] and i know today devils are going to
[56:05] tremble
[56:06] they are shaking brother because
[56:08] scriptures like that put him out
[56:11] he's got no place there because god has
[56:14] already predestinated you
[56:17] and uh called you to adoption hallelujah
[56:21] amen so uh we just wanna
[56:25] uh i'm gonna have to fire quick this is
[56:27] almost a two-hour message
[56:29] and it's five past eleven so we're gonna
[56:32] stay on fire okay
[56:37] we're gonna stay on fire amen i said i'm
[56:39] not going after no one i'm just gonna
[56:41] preach
[56:42] and you're gonna preach back amen so i
[56:45] got a title this morning
[56:48] the last day manifested sons of god
[56:51] so we've had sons all through the ages
[56:54] but there's something special
[56:55] about the last day sons because they
[56:59] must bring redemption
[57:01] oh hallelujah to all nature and even to
[57:04] ourselves
[57:06] then my subject the dispensation of
[57:08] adoption
[57:09] which is now and then my inspiration
[57:12] the time for the sons of god to be
[57:15] manifested
[57:16] it's got to come to pass do you believe
[57:19] that
[57:20] do you believe you part of that amen
[57:24] it's okay i'm gonna fire straight from
[57:26] adam so we go
[57:27] all the way to eden amen
[57:30] and we see man was made a secondary god
[57:33] on earth
[57:34] he was given all power to control all
[57:37] the elements of the earth
[57:40] he gave him jurisdiction over everything
[57:43] he controlled the animal life he
[57:45] controlled the fish life
[57:47] he controlled the winds he controlled
[57:49] the plant life
[57:50] he could speak to it to the tree and say
[57:54] be planted over there and the tree will
[57:55] uproot itself
[57:57] and plant it over on the other side it
[57:59] will obey him why
[58:01] he was a son of god hallelujah
[58:04] he could direct and flow if the river
[58:07] was flown
[58:08] in his direction he could he could
[58:10] redirect that river by the word
[58:13] and say river flow that way towards the
[58:15] right and the river will open and flow
[58:17] towards the right
[58:18] why he was a son of god and when
[58:22] god made adam he made him superior to
[58:25] anything that was on earth he was
[58:27] superior to
[58:28] all the animals to all the plant life to
[58:31] everything that was on the earth
[58:32] he was superior hallelujah he was in
[58:36] control
[58:37] and brother brahm says he was a minor
[58:39] god under god
[58:41] so the human being was made to be a god
[58:44] a minor god under god now brother that's
[58:48] your original position
[58:50] that's what you were supposed to be and
[58:52] we are coming back to that brother
[58:54] hallelujah
[59:01] yeah complete supreme control a minor
[59:04] god under god
[59:05] god was the god of the universe but adam
[59:08] was the god of the earth
[59:10] and all nature obeyed him hallelujah but
[59:13] then something went wrong
[59:16] and adam all of a sudden because son
[59:18] came into the garden
[59:20] he became unconscious something happened
[59:23] he became unconscious of who he was
[59:26] because sin came into the garden
[59:29] and he lost consciousness that he was
[59:31] the son of god
[59:33] and all the channels that god would drop
[59:35] into him
[59:36] it all got clogged up and god could not
[59:39] reach him
[59:40] it got clogged up and all of a sudden
[59:42] adam couldn't understand
[59:44] the animals wouldn't come to him they
[59:46] rather ran away
[59:48] when he called the lion the lion ran
[59:50] away all of a sudden there was a growl
[59:53] something had gone wrong in eden what
[59:55] has happened brother
[59:57] something the son of god had fallen
[1:00:00] from his estate and all of a sudden now
[1:00:04] he had no more control of the earth oh
[1:00:07] hallelujah and brother brahm says here
[1:00:10] in the fundamental foundation of faith
[1:00:13] that in the beginning of
[1:00:14] man that that what god gave him power
[1:00:17] over everything on earth
[1:00:19] now through the fall he lost that power
[1:00:22] and he become
[1:00:23] unconscious of the fact after losing his
[1:00:27] relationship
[1:00:28] and friendship and fellowship with the
[1:00:30] father
[1:00:32] then he lost that and all of his great
[1:00:34] channels became clogged up
[1:00:36] and he couldn't get through and adam
[1:00:39] couldn't understand what went wrong he
[1:00:41] can't
[1:00:41] get through anymore he would call to
[1:00:44] them and they'll run away
[1:00:45] his channels got clogged up friends
[1:00:48] there was no more inspiration
[1:00:50] he couldn't hear from god no more
[1:00:52] hallelujah
[1:00:53] all of a sudden he realized something
[1:00:56] had happened in the
[1:00:57] unquote promises and adam fell he lost
[1:01:00] his sonship
[1:01:01] his inheritance his life his sonship his
[1:01:04] jurisdiction over the earth
[1:01:06] with with with these fall the earth fell
[1:01:10] [Music]
[1:01:11] now watch this and the earth fell so
[1:01:14] when god came and he says
[1:01:15] why are you naked god came looking for
[1:01:17] adam now i want you to listen to this
[1:01:20] when adam fell his son god didn't send
[1:01:23] an angel to go look for him
[1:01:25] god himself came down to look for his
[1:01:28] son
[1:01:29] that had fallen brother sister that's
[1:01:32] the god we
[1:01:33] serve man that every son and daughter
[1:01:36] that makes a mistake and fall don't you
[1:01:39] worry he comes himself
[1:01:41] to look for you brother sister
[1:01:45] [Applause]
[1:01:48] my and then brother prime says
[1:01:52] and in the scriptures in genesis god
[1:01:54] begin to curse
[1:01:55] he cursed eve he cursed the serpent but
[1:01:58] when he came to
[1:01:59] adam adam was his son brother he
[1:02:02] couldn't curse his son
[1:02:04] this was his son how could he curse his
[1:02:07] what father good was his son
[1:02:09] but the bible says instead of cursing
[1:02:11] adam
[1:02:12] he cursed the earth
[1:02:16] come on brother sister i don't care what
[1:02:18] the devil does you are his son
[1:02:21] you are his daughter you might have
[1:02:23] fallen you might have made a mistake

[1:02:27] [Applause]
[1:02:29] [Music]
[1:02:30] [Applause]
[1:02:33] he cursed the earth and not his son god
[1:02:35] cursed the earth and the earth brought
[1:02:37] forth
[1:02:38] thorns and thistles the bible says he
[1:02:40] didn't do that before
[1:02:43] and and the book of life went back to
[1:02:46] the hands of the original
[1:02:47] owner and satan tried to get his grishy
[1:02:50] hands on it
[1:02:51] but he couldn't get in other words the
[1:02:53] title did the authority
[1:02:55] that adam had that went back to god
[1:02:58] satan tried to get that if he got that
[1:03:01] brother he would have done much damage
[1:03:03] but it went back to the original owner
[1:03:06] oh
[1:03:07] hallelujah that's why in revelations
[1:03:09] chapter 10
[1:03:10] there comes down a mighty angel with a
[1:03:13] with a book in his hand
[1:03:15] that's the same book that went back to

[1:03:30] that that is why nature is groaning
[1:03:33] waiting for the manifestation of the

[1:03:37] and adam the bible says he had an
[1:03:38] adoption for he gave him dominion over
[1:03:41] all things
[1:03:42] but he lost his guardship he lost his
[1:03:44] sonship
[1:03:45] he lost his domain and satan took it
[1:03:48] over
[1:03:49] it becomes and it became satan's eden
[1:03:54] it was no more god's eating how he
[1:03:56] became satan's edener
[1:03:58] hallelujah and god and satan had adam's
[1:04:01] race
[1:04:02] pinned in the corner because adam failed

[1:24:44] and daughters and our sons and daughters
[1:24:46] who has who has most power before god
[1:24:50] what is in an angel an angel is a
[1:24:52] servant
[1:24:54] is that right they servants
[1:24:57] what are you his sons and daughters
[1:25:01] who has most power in heaven than a
[1:25:04] sinner that has been saved by grace
[1:25:06] or an archangel that's standing before
[1:25:08] his right side
[1:25:10] who has more power a sinister by grace
[1:25:13] or an archangel
[1:25:14] [Applause]
[1:25:21] in heaven or a sinister by
[1:25:24] as soon as christ by grace you start
[1:25:27] calling on the name of jesus
[1:25:29] and watch how god begins to move brother
[1:25:31] you start calling on that name
[1:25:33] and not even the archangel can move him
[1:25:36] but when he sees the sun go on his knees
[1:25:38] and he begins to pray that moves the
[1:25:41] heart of god
[1:25:43] why brother you have more authority
[1:25:47] you have more power you have more
[1:25:50] authority
[1:25:51] you're more anointing can the archangel
[1:25:54] in heaven
[1:25:55] you have more authority brother
[1:25:58] hallelujah take that satan this people
[1:26:01] has got more authority
[1:26:10] [Applause]
[1:26:15] a sinner that's been saved by grace as
[1:26:18] more authority in heaven than the
[1:26:19] archangel that stood by sight
[1:26:21] without sin because he's a son son is
[1:26:24] more authority
[1:26:24] than the seventh my hallelujah
[1:26:28] now listen to this quote fellowship by
[1:26:31] redemption
[1:26:32] he says a man has a soul
[1:26:38] not a striking even a sinner one man
[1:26:42] says you know what that
[1:26:43] sin affair but god never took his image
[1:26:46] out of him
[1:26:50] can you imagine because that man is
[1:26:52] still a creator now let me read the
[1:26:54] quote
[1:26:54] and therefore the soul is a part of god
[1:26:57] and even in his fallen state
[1:26:59] yet it's the most greatest species of
[1:27:02] all species
[1:27:03] of the earth is man so that man
[1:27:06] in his fallen state is still the
[1:27:08] greatest specie
[1:27:10] that man is a sinner and he can bend
[1:27:12] this thing let it crush
[1:27:14] he can look at the glass and burst it
[1:27:16] just with a with his intellectual powers
[1:27:18] but he's a sinner
[1:27:21] you know why it's because god's image is
[1:27:22] so
[1:27:25] god didn't take that away from me all he
[1:27:27] took away was his authority
[1:27:29] but he left his images that's why satan
[1:27:31] is always
[1:27:32] not sure he always questions your
[1:27:34] identity
[1:27:36] what's that when christ was hanging on
[1:27:39] are you the son of god
[1:27:40] when he tempted him in the desert if you
[1:27:43] the son of god you can
[1:27:44] turn these stones you see he questions
[1:27:46] your identity
[1:27:47] he's not sure but i want to make you
[1:27:50] give you double assurance
[1:27:51] you are a son of god that's been
[1:27:54] restored brother
[1:27:55] and when you restored you have double
[1:27:58] power you have a double portion
[1:28:02] [Applause]
[1:28:06] listen he says now that man that's
[1:28:09] fallen is the highest species on earth
[1:28:11] and then get him in connection with his
[1:28:14] maker
[1:28:15] he becomes a superman oh
[1:28:19] my goodness oh i feel like running
[1:28:22] through the building
[1:28:23] elijah listen man get him in connection
[1:28:25] with his maker
[1:28:27] he becomes a superman almost because
[1:28:30] he's a son of god
[1:28:32] becomes acquainted with his maker and
[1:28:34] with the creator of all things
[1:28:36] then when that man there is acquainted
[1:28:39] with his maker
[1:28:40] he becomes a part with his maker he
[1:28:42] comes back in fellowship with his maker
[1:28:45] every divine divine word becomes a
[1:28:48] living reality to him
[1:28:50] and he believes it so brother when you
[1:28:52] get that sinner
[1:28:54] back in restoration with his maker that
[1:28:57] man becomes a superman
[1:28:59] and yeah you're ready to give up for
[1:29:01] what brother
[1:29:02] just get into get connected with your
[1:29:06] maker
[1:29:06] you become a superwoman
[1:29:10] you become a superman you become
[1:29:13] someone that's connected with his maker
[1:29:16] now the maker the creator and
[1:29:20] and the soil creation is now one brother
[1:29:23] what devil is gonna stop you
[1:29:25] what demon is gonna come against what
[1:29:28] man can come against you
[1:29:30] you restored back
[1:29:32] [Applause]
[1:29:33] creation and creator is connected
[1:29:36] together again brother
[1:29:38] that's a son of god a manifested son of
[1:29:42] god
[1:29:42] [Applause]
[1:29:50] my please stay with me now i'm coming to
[1:29:53] something very striking
[1:29:55] and this is in the fission church age
[1:29:57] now this is just before christ came on
[1:29:59] the scene
[1:30:00] god's intention please listen god's
[1:30:03] intention for his creation man is
[1:30:05] to express his words in genesis adam was
[1:30:08] given the word to live by
[1:30:10] a life loved by the word would be the
[1:30:12] word expressed
[1:30:13] that is true is it not but did adam live
[1:30:17] by the word
[1:30:18] no because he he was to live by
[1:30:21] every word and he failed to take heed to
[1:30:24] every word
[1:30:26] then there rose moses what the great and
[1:30:29] mighty man of
[1:30:30] god he was yet he was yet he also
[1:30:33] failed to live by every word and that
[1:30:36] prophet
[1:30:36] a type of the great prophet to come
[1:30:39] failed in anger
[1:30:40] to obey the word then there was also
[1:30:44] david the great king
[1:30:45] of israel a man after god's own heart
[1:30:49] he fell by adultery when he was tempted
[1:30:54] so this is now god is working to his
[1:30:57] plan he wants to come to that perfect
[1:30:59] masterpiece
[1:31:00] so he took every man he saw adam fail
[1:31:02] but he he knew he had to restore that
[1:31:05] and bring it back
[1:31:06] so through every prophet he came but
[1:31:08] they failed and then he took another one
[1:31:10] and they failed
[1:31:11] and then he takes another one and they
[1:31:13] fail and they fail but listen mother
[1:31:15] what brother man says
[1:31:17] and they say every time there's a word
[1:31:19] but
[1:31:21] it erases out all the past
[1:31:25] oh i hope you got it already but
[1:31:30] eventually in the fullness of time
[1:31:33] they came one day ahead even jesus
[1:31:37] who also must be tempted to see if he
[1:31:40] would live by
[1:31:41] every word that proceeded out of the
[1:31:44] mouth of god
[1:31:45] then when satan was foiled
[1:31:48] for he was one who lived it is written
[1:31:52] and that masterpiece god overcame by
[1:31:56] reflecting god's word
[1:31:58] then was this manifested perfect one
[1:32:03] given the cross as the perfect lamb of
[1:32:06] god
[1:32:07] for the perfect sacrifice on the tree
[1:32:11] he received the wounds of death that we
[1:32:14] by him because of him
[1:32:17] might eat of the tree of life
[1:32:20] adam eight of what of the tree of
[1:32:22] knowledge the second adam brings
[1:32:25] us oh brother come on man
[1:32:28] so we can eat what of the tree of life
[1:32:33] oh and then the life freely given
[1:32:37] will enable us to overcome and express
[1:32:41] the word of god again
[1:32:43] oh brother so don't tell me listen
[1:32:47] moses had his part david had his spot
[1:32:50] assaila had his part
[1:32:52] but but but eventually there came one
[1:32:55] man
[1:32:56] and his name was jesus he was the word
[1:32:59] he loved the word he fulfilled the word
[1:33:03] hallelujah
[1:33:06] he died on calvary so that you and i
[1:33:08] might go
[1:33:09] free and we can live from the tree of
[1:33:13] life you're not living off a man
[1:33:17] you living of the tree of life
[1:33:22] [Applause]
[1:33:23] [Music]
[1:33:34] oh
[1:33:37] [Music]
[1:33:41] [Applause]
[1:33:43] now you must listen to me i wanted to
[1:33:45] put it on a screen but it was a bit too
[1:33:47] late
[1:33:48] and how many saw the the new motor car
[1:33:52] that they made with no steering wheel
[1:33:55] and they said it's already ready made
[1:33:58] just waiting for production but it's
[1:34:00] already made
[1:34:02] and many of you got it on your cell
[1:34:04] phones seen this driveless car no press
[1:34:07] no driver no stain wheel nothing right
[1:34:10] now listen to this they say
[1:34:15] it's called a prototype
[1:34:19] an original model what is a prototype is
[1:34:22] an original model on which
[1:34:25] something is patent
[1:34:28] image of the prototype now for an image
[1:34:32] to be produced
[1:34:34] there has to be a prototype so before
[1:34:37] prosem they can manufacture it
[1:34:39] they must first have this masterpiece
[1:34:40] the prototype
[1:34:43] and it has to be tested through every
[1:34:45] test
[1:34:46] it can't fail because once you produce
[1:34:50] it
[1:34:51] it's faultless and i was in germany and
[1:34:54] brother sigma took us to the german
[1:34:55] factory
[1:34:56] where they had a massive car there no
[1:34:58] steering wheel
[1:34:59] nothing and they showed us a 10 minute
[1:35:01] video how they tested this car
[1:35:04] through they put it through the most
[1:35:05] rugged test
[1:35:07] and now they got it on display they say
[1:35:10] it's a prototype
[1:35:12] ready for manufacture
[1:35:15] because it's past every test
[1:35:20] hallelujah i i know you spiritual i know
[1:35:24] where you see i'm going
[1:35:25] so there to be a prototype so all the
[1:35:28] tests that
[1:35:29] god has done through the old testament
[1:35:31] they all failed and they all failed and
[1:35:33] they all failed
[1:35:34] and they all failed but but eventually
[1:35:36] came
[1:35:37] to a masterpiece he came to a real
[1:35:40] prototype
[1:35:42] hallelujah he came to a real prototype
[1:35:45] and his name was jesus and before they
[1:35:48] can produce it
[1:35:49] it must pass every test
[1:35:52] and he passed every test so much so he
[1:35:56] said who can accuse me of sin
[1:35:58] who can point the finger at me i pass
[1:36:01] every test brother he became the perfect
[1:36:08] masterpiece
[1:36:26] yeah what they say for an image to
[1:36:28] produce
[1:36:30] there has to be a prototype necessary
[1:36:34] this means man has to have a prototype
[1:36:37] if
[1:36:38] he or she is an image now we all want to
[1:36:41] be like jesus now that's why if you read
[1:36:43] ephesians
[1:36:44] pretty destiny to be in his image
[1:36:59] man i feel excited i know the devil is
[1:37:02] in trouble man
[1:37:03] glory be to god hallelujah
[1:37:06] [Applause]
[1:37:13] [Applause]
[1:37:17] okay one of the ones we read there he
[1:37:19] says we are
[1:37:20] we are supposed to be in the same image
[1:37:23] now any man or woman he or she
[1:37:26] is an image of what is now they say what
[1:37:29] is a prototype
[1:37:30] thing it's the original version
[1:37:37] so when god came down to christ
[1:37:41] 2nd adam the original version
[1:37:44] back on the earth so god has got now a
[1:37:47] prototype
[1:37:49] now in all the east asia it it's it's a
[1:37:52] it's original version or an example from
[1:37:54] which
[1:37:55] the subsequent images will depict
[1:37:58] so the prototype is produced first
[1:38:01] before mass production
[1:38:04] yo my god my god is smart man
[1:38:08] and you that understand mechanics and
[1:38:10] understand technical things
[1:38:12] it don't only apply to a car it can be
[1:38:14] an airplane it can be a computer it can
[1:38:16] be anything
[1:38:17] but i'm using a car today so he says now
[1:38:20] before
[1:38:21] is the original version the example of
[1:38:23] which so the subsequent images will
[1:38:25] depict
[1:38:26] so the prototype is produced first
[1:38:29] before mass production it is tested
[1:38:32] under various conditions
[1:38:34] to see how it will function when it
[1:38:37] passes
[1:38:38] then other products are produced to
[1:38:41] perform
[1:38:42] like the original oh are you ready
[1:38:45] brother sister
[1:38:46] so you mean if there's a prototype and
[1:38:48] god is going to make images
[1:38:50] then the images must act how exactly
[1:38:54] like the prototype god is not going to
[1:38:57] make a mistake
[1:38:58] he already tested the prototype he
[1:39:00] already protested the masterpiece
[1:39:02] and there was no fault
[1:39:10] hallelujah i can see the devil's running
[1:39:14] brother
[1:39:14] demons are running why the sons of god
[1:39:17] are coming back
[1:39:18] they're going to be in the same image
[1:39:20] like jesus christ
[1:39:22] they will fulfill the word of god they
[1:39:25] will deliver nature
[1:39:28] my that's why i said who of you can
[1:39:32] condemn me of sin man
[1:39:34] jesus christ the word of god that
[1:39:35] created what
[1:39:37] is our prayer is our prototype
[1:39:40] now watch where they take him they don't
[1:39:43] only take him when he was formed
[1:39:45] because he was right in the garden he's
[1:39:47] the one
[1:39:48] that said let there be
[1:39:53] oh listen when he started creation
[1:39:56] the world was formless and void but he
[1:39:59] brought order
[1:40:00] where there was darkness he brought
[1:40:02] light he demonstrated that he could
[1:40:05] speak for things to manifest thereby
[1:40:08] showing
[1:40:08] how faith operates and he also
[1:40:12] demonstrated dominion
[1:40:14] hallelujah now he has an encouragement
[1:40:17] for you
[1:40:18] i don't know if you're going to aim in
[1:40:19] this i don't know if you're going to
[1:40:21] stand up for this
[1:40:22] but listen brother don't bother
[1:40:25] about the chaos and the darkness in your
[1:40:28] life now
[1:40:29] you will dispel them
[1:40:34] hallelujah you will dispel there
[1:40:38] brother raymond i'm in darkness brother
[1:40:40] raymond i'm down
[1:40:42] but you see your type is the original
[1:40:44] type
[1:40:45] that said let there be and there was now
[1:40:48] when they were darkness and void in
[1:40:51] garden of eden
[1:40:52] he brought the eden to darkness
[1:40:56] and void and light
[1:41:00] so they encouraged man their darkness in
[1:41:02] your life
[1:41:03] you can dispel it let there be light
[1:41:07] let the darkness leave let the chaos
[1:41:09] leave
[1:41:11] there's life in you speak the word
[1:41:14] you are an image of the original
[1:41:23] come on
[1:41:32] [Music]
[1:41:34] don't bother about the chaos and
[1:41:35] darkness in your life
[1:41:37] you shall spell them
[1:41:38] [Applause]
[1:41:40] if that is how our if that is how our
[1:41:43] prototype behaved in those
[1:41:46] instances aren't we to behave the same
[1:41:51] so what are you scared of what are you
[1:41:54] scratching your head
[1:41:55] you're wondering am i going to make it
[1:41:57] am i going to be there
[1:41:59] your type your image
[1:42:02] you made in that same image of the
[1:42:04] prototype
[1:42:06] if he the spell and and behave in those
[1:42:09] instances aren't we to behave the same
[1:42:13] that is why he gave adam dominion over
[1:42:16] nature
[1:42:16] this is why it's adam that name the
[1:42:19] animals and adam exercise faith
[1:42:21] to show true likeness so adam showed
[1:42:25] true likeness so
[1:42:26] that same power is in you now
[1:42:29] now you must believe it like you believe
[1:42:32] your doctor or your teacher

[1:45:21] wow i hope you caught that one
[1:45:25] oh my goodness we have a prototype
[1:45:28] brother
[1:45:29] and he was tested and without fault
[1:45:32] that's why problem says we can always
[1:45:34] point to him
[1:45:35] that's why when satan tries to accuse
[1:45:37] you christ come and he stands there in
[1:45:39] his blood
[1:45:39] he says but i died for them there's no
[1:45:42] fault in him
[1:45:44] you remember what his name brother carl
[1:45:46] always preached of the great evangelist
[1:45:48] when he got there and he thought he
[1:45:50] didn't lie and make mistakes he found
[1:45:51] what he did
[1:45:52] and just when he was waiting for
[1:45:54] condemnation who came
[1:45:57] here comes the prototype you say yes
[1:45:59] father is guilty
[1:46:00] but on earth he stood for me now i stand
[1:46:03] for him
[1:46:04] your prototype stands for you day and
[1:46:06] night brother
[1:46:08] every time the devil goes to accuse you
[1:46:10] he says not guilty
[1:46:12] not guilty the blood speaks on your
[1:46:14] behalf
[1:46:15] the blood of christ has got a voice not
[1:46:24] guilty
[1:46:27] we are predestined to be conformed to
[1:46:29] the image of christ
[1:46:31] so we want to get to jesus where he
[1:46:34] restores man back to the image of god
[1:46:37] that's why he said it's expedient watch
[1:46:40] for me to go so that my image could come
[1:46:43] back
[1:46:44] into you so that production can begin
[1:46:51] i'm just switching the words so you can
[1:46:52] get a picture
[1:46:54] he says it's expedient for me to go
[1:46:56] because i passed the test
[1:46:59] i'm the perfect masterpiece but if i
[1:47:02] stay here
[1:47:04] they can't be operation of mess they
[1:47:06] can't produce or protect more
[1:47:09] depict more of this image so it's
[1:47:12] expedient
[1:47:14] and they couldn't understand what's
[1:47:16] happening and then he said go terry in
[1:47:18] jerusalem
[1:47:20] until the factory will begin

[1:54:43] his kind
[1:54:44] the original that that's where they came
[1:54:47] from
[1:54:49] then caiaphas and the elders wanted to

[1:55:09] when when the pharisees are speaking by

[1:55:24] whole
[1:55:26] he said let it be known unto you all he
[1:55:28] and people of israel

[1:55:43] neither is there salvation in any other
[1:55:46] for there is none other name under
[1:55:48] heaven given among men
[1:55:49] whereby you shall be saved so that's why
[1:55:52] i say in the name of jesus
[1:55:54] receive what you come for this morning
[1:55:56] did you come for something
[1:55:58] did you come expecting something well

[1:56:14] the bible says then the people realize
[1:56:16] this people is anointed
[1:56:18] and they brought cots and they laid it
[1:56:21] in the street beds and couches
[1:56:23] and let the shadow of peter pass by them
[1:56:25] and as the shadow of peter would fall
[1:56:27] upon them
[1:56:28] they would jump over the couch they will
[1:56:30] jump off the cot
[1:56:31] what was happening exactly like the
[1:56:33] original

[1:57:02] spirits
[1:57:03] then the high priest rose up all they
[1:57:06] did was with him
[1:57:07] which is the sect of the sadducees and
[1:57:09] they were filled with indignation
[1:57:11] they never saw these morals and laid
[1:57:13] their hands on the apostles
[1:57:15] put them in the common prison now watch
