[20:34] thanks again for coming out tonight
[20:37] if of your Bibles
[20:38] I'd like to tune the three portion of
[20:40] scripture tonight Romans 8 we're going
[20:42] to read from verse 20 to 32 second
[20:45] Corinthians 6 we want to read from three
[20:47] to ten and II Peter 1 verse 3 and verse
[20:52] 4. reading from Romans 8 28
[20:55] and we know that all things work
[20:57] together for good to them that love God
[20:59] to them who are the called according to
[21:02] his purpose for whom he did for no he
[21:04] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[21:06] the image of his son that he might be
[21:08] the firstborn among many Brethren
[21:10] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[21:12] he also called whom he called them he
[21:15] also Justified and will be justified
[21:17] then we also glorified
[21:19] what shall we then say to these things
[21:22] if God before us who can be against us
[21:26] and this is the verse I want to get to
[21:28] tonight he
[21:29] that speared not his own son
[21:32] but delivered him up for us all how
[21:36] shall he not with him also freely give
[21:39] us all things
[21:41] and second Corinthians 6.
[21:44] the universe 3 from second Corinthians
[21:46] 6.
[21:47] given no offense in anything that the
[21:50] ministry be not blamed but in all things
[21:53] are proven ourselves as the Ministers of
[21:55] God in much patience in afflictions and
[21:59] Necessities in distresses in stripes in
[22:04] imprisonments in two months in labors in
[22:08] Watkins in fastens by pureness by
[22:13] knowledge by long-suffering by kindness
[22:16] by the Holy Ghost by love on faith by
[22:20] the word of Truth by the power of God by
[22:23] the armor of righteousness on the right
[22:25] hand on the left by Honor and this Honor
[22:29] by every report and good report as
[22:31] deceivers as yet true as unknown and yet
[22:34] well known as dying and behold we live
[22:37] as chastened and not killed a sorrowful
[22:42] yet always rejoicing as poor yet making
[22:46] many rich as having nothing and yet
[22:49] possess him all things
[22:52] our last scripture reading from second
[22:54] Peter chapter one
[22:56] verse 3 and 4.
[22:58] according as his divine power had given
[23:01] to us all things that pertained the life
[23:03] and godliness
[23:04] through the knowledge of him
[23:06] that had called us to glory and virtue
[23:09] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[23:12] great and precious promises that by
[23:15] these he might be partakers of the
[23:17] divine nature having us keep the
[23:19] corruption that's in the world true love
[23:21] let's pray one more time father we thank
[23:22] you for your word and Lord I just thank
[23:25] you for your word tonight in a special
[23:27] way may you bring Revelation and
[23:28] inspiration to your people in Jesus amen
[23:32] you may be seated o praise God it's
[23:33] great to be here tonight good to see all
[23:36] of you out
[23:36] amen understand there's some bad weather
[23:38] coming a couple of hours
[23:40] tomorrow but we're good to be here
[23:43] tonight and enjoy the Lord enjoy his
[23:45] word amen
[23:47] okay
[23:48] so tonight I have a title and this title
[23:51] is his divine power has given unto us
[23:55] all things
[23:57] now the scripture you read in second uh
[24:00] in in um in second Peter they said
[24:03] according as his divine power has given
[24:07] unto us all things that pertain under
[24:10] life and godliness
[24:13] through the knowledge of him
[24:17] so it's true the knowledge of him not
[24:19] just and there's two kind of knowledge
[24:21] there is the knowledge which is like the
[24:23] intellectual part and the knowledge of
[24:25] knowing part so you can read all about
[24:27] buddhi over it and say I know him he's
[24:29] from Trinidad so on social because
[24:31] people read that but if you haven't met
[24:33] the man you're ready how much do you
[24:34] know the man so there's two parts to
[24:36] this knowledge and there's knowing amen
[24:40] praise be to Jesus you love him tonight
[24:43] all right have a context scripture which
[24:45] is a Romans eat for as many years are
[24:47] led by the spirit of God they are the
[24:49] sons of God for we have not received the
[24:52] spirit of bondage again to fear so as we
[24:54] get closer as we get more of God fear
[24:57] leaves users questions leave us don't
[25:00] leave us and he said we have not really
[25:02] spread a bunch of fear but we are
[25:04] received the spirit of adoption not
[25:06] adoption
[25:08] the spirit
[25:12] itself we had witness with our spirit
[25:14] that we are the children of God and if
[25:17] children then heirs once you say you are
[25:20] child you are Heir if children then ears
[25:22] you cannot separate children from Air
[25:25] you can't be a child not a Heir once you
[25:27] are a child you are heir of what the
[25:29] father has could you say Amen somebody
[25:31] if children then is that's the whole
[25:33] message myself eight children then ears
[25:36] ears of God
[25:38] and joint is with Christ so if we start
[25:41] if we suffer with him that we may also
[25:43] be glorified together for I reckon that
[25:45] the sufferings of this present time are
[25:48] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[25:50] which shall be revealed in us for the
[25:53] earnest expectation of the creature
[25:54] waited for the manifestation of the sons
[25:57] of God all right let's look at that and
[25:59] be Amplified for all who are led by the
[26:01] spirit of God are sons of God for the
[26:03] spirit which you have not received is
[26:04] not a spirit of slavery
[26:07] to put you once more in bondage to fear
[26:09] but you'll receive the spirit of
[26:11] adoption the spirit producing sonship
[26:14] the Bliss of which we cry Abba Father
[26:17] the spirit himself testified together
[26:20] with our spirit assuring us that we are
[26:22] children of God
[26:24] and if we are his children then we are
[26:27] heirs also
[26:28] kind of separated
[26:30] if you are his if we are his children we
[26:33] are heirs also amen what we preached
[26:36] last week Wednesday night going back to
[26:38] returning back to your inheritance going
[26:40] back to where amen what God ordained for
[26:43] you you have to get back somewhere God
[26:45] will just call us to drift into
[26:47] salvation and just drift out to the
[26:49] nomination God call us out to put us in
[26:52] so if we are getting yet we still have
[26:54] to get in because the purpose of God in
[26:56] Redemption is in two parts bringing us
[26:58] out of and going into so you've got to
[27:01] go into what God promised I don't care
[27:03] if you're old 90 and nine praise God or
[27:05] you're just born you still have to win
[27:07] the god promise praise God where Joshua
[27:09] Caleb or a whole bunch of people
[27:11] crossing over you still have to go to
[27:12] the promise God promised them the
[27:14] promised land Oh Glory to God a bunch of
[27:17] old heads couldn't make it but they had
[27:18] Next Generation made it and if we don't
[27:21] make it there's another generation that
[27:22] go to make it because God can't lie if
[27:25] it's one thing about God he could can't
[27:27] lie he don't have innated alive whatever
[27:29] he said is truth whatever is he said
[27:31] must come to pass he even said my word
[27:33] shall not return on me void but then
[27:35] shall accomplish your purpose to
[27:37] accomplish one thing about God he never
[27:39] tell a liar he will tell the truth all
[27:42] the time the day you eat thereof that
[27:44] day you shall surely die welcome the
[27:46] Lord some Praises but the devil is a
[27:48] liar how do we know every time you open
[27:50] his mouth he's lying
[27:53] so if we are his children then we are
[27:55] heirs elves also Heirs of God and
[27:57] fellows with Christ what which is
[27:59] sharing his inheritance with him only we
[28:03] must share his suffering if we are to
[28:05] share his glory
[28:07] but what
[28:09] what I for I consider the suffering of
[28:11] this present time this present life are
[28:13] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[28:15] that is about to be revealed to us and
[28:18] in us and for us and conflict on us
[28:22] Oh Glory to God our glory to revealed in
[28:25] to by you and get the Lord some Praises
[28:28] for the whole creation all nature with
[28:31] expectantly and Longs earnestly for
[28:34] God's Sons to be made known wait for the
[28:38] revealing or the disclosing of their
[28:40] sonship so God have to identify our
[28:42] sonship that we are sons of God not sons
[28:45] of the Earth not sons of Tijuana not
[28:48] sons of the Earth but sons of God and
[28:51] sons of God Walk Like God talk like God
[28:53] live like God act like God manifest God
[28:55] or give the Lord a shout in the house
[28:58] praise God praise God Ephesians 4 11
[29:02] says and he gives some Apostles some
[29:04] prophets some evangelists some pastors
[29:07] and teachers for the Perfection of the
[29:09] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[29:12] the early father of Christ till we all
[29:14] come in the unity of the faith and the
[29:17] knowledge
[29:18] of the Son of God you have to come into
[29:20] that knowledge of the Son of God onto a
[29:22] perfect man unto the stature of the
[29:25] fullness of Christ Oh Glory to God
[29:27] hallelujah praise God oh that's the
[29:30] calling now that you're coming to the
[29:31] knowledge of the Son of God oh glory to
[29:34] God somebody could know about uh the
[29:37] country but they never registered before
[29:39] they could go near encyclopedia they
[29:40] could say on Google they could Google
[29:42] Trinidad and know the GDP I know who's
[29:44] the Prime Minister and who is this
[29:45] person but they have never been to
[29:46] Trinidad so they know Trinidad by that
[29:50] reading and writing but they have known
[29:52] Trinidad by coming to Trinidad they
[29:54] experience Trinidad where people could
[29:56] know the Bible and don't know God
[29:58] Oh Glory to God they have a knowledge of
[30:00] the word but they do have a knowledge of
[30:01] God oh glory to God and to know him is
[30:04] life or give the Lord some Praises but
[30:07] the Bible is God and print form so
[30:09] people that have the knowledge of God
[30:11] without knowing god okay the Lord some
[30:13] Praises Oh Glory to God through the
[30:15] knowledge of him who is him who what
[30:17] knowledge the knowledge of Christ
[30:19] it's not right praise God praise God
[30:22] praise God so then Peter we didn't
[30:24] finish really rest exceeding great
[30:26] precious promises and besides this
[30:28] virtue and knowledge and Temperance and
[30:30] patience and godliness and so on he said
[30:32] if these things be in you you shall
[30:34] neither be Barren or unfruitful in the
[30:36] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but
[30:38] he has lack of these things as blind
[30:41] one can't see a file two and forgotten
[30:44] that he was put from his own sins Oh
[30:46] Glory to God because that is not
[30:48] established in the prison system
[30:50] like somebody shared with me she see
[30:52] somebody talking about you squeeze the
[30:53] orange what you get
[30:55] oven juice why because the orange
[30:58] and he squeezes again harder way good
[31:01] more orange juice because the orange so
[31:03] when you squeeze people and you see
[31:04] malice come out and hatred come out and
[31:06] evil come out wait wait he's done with
[31:08] this other day you can't you can't
[31:10] squeeze and get all what not inside of
[31:12] there is what's inside of there and if
[31:13] you put Christ inside of there what does
[31:15] squeeze and they come on okay the Lord
[31:17] some Praises so Christ Under Pressure
[31:19] will still produce Christ okay the Lord
[31:20] some Praises tonight
[31:22] Hallelujah so the pressure comes to show
[31:25] and expose what's inside of us
[31:26] all of us isn't that right o praise the
[31:29] name of the Lord praise God
[31:32] wait for the rather Brethren give
[31:35] diligence to make your calling an
[31:37] election sure but if you do these things
[31:39] you shall never fall praise God and but
[31:42] abandon preacher message called
[31:43] possessing all things he said we are
[31:45] poor yet possess all things he called
[31:48] Abraham he called him to separate
[31:49] himself from everything come out you
[31:51] know people you might think here but
[31:53] Brandon I sometimes I'm tempted to steal
[31:56] or sometimes I'm tempted to smoke or
[31:58] sometimes the woman think I'm tempted to
[32:00] dress like the people of the world you
[32:01] know anymore clothes I'm tempted young
[32:04] ladies you think that's tempting what
[32:06] about over here where you've got to
[32:08] watch every little move to watch in the
[32:09] ministry what a great thing it is and we
[32:12] have more to answer for because you have
[32:15] to answer for your own Souls but we have
[32:17] to answer for everybody we speak to so
[32:20] Satan just constantly where you say
[32:22] isn't that a pretty little dress it's
[32:24] all wrong to wear isn't it beautiful
[32:25] it'll fit me just right where is it and
[32:28] you know that's wrong but in the
[32:29] ministers you've got to go to this
[32:31] meeting and it's so great on the
[32:32] congregation I have to wait to hear from
[32:34] God not a mama to watch too so don't
[32:36] think that we have it easy and the
[32:38] states have any uh the people have it
[32:40] easy they must have been easy no we have
[32:42] to fight the Devils you fighting and
[32:43] more than that too because the devil
[32:45] want the children the minister every
[32:46] time because Smite the shepherd the
[32:48] Sheep scatter so if you could wreck the
[32:50] top then the whole thing fall down
[32:52] that's why
[32:54] fatherhood and parenting and whatnot
[32:56] that that's why families are broken
[32:58] because that there's a devil's job to
[33:00] wreck God's people before there was a
[33:02] church there was a family in the
[33:04] gardener Eden Adam and Eve God and
[33:06] fellowship and atmosphere and then the
[33:08] Satan saw an opportunity to step into
[33:11] the serpent
[33:13] because the serpent was so close to man
[33:16] stepped into that and he wasn't herself
[33:18] a snake
[33:19] was talking
[33:20] and he's taking an opportunity to step
[33:22] to communicate the eve
[33:24] and the first thing he asked what did
[33:26] God say because God didn't talk to him
[33:28] he didn't have the word he didn't have
[33:30] the seed he had no information upon what
[33:33] God had said Oh Glory to God and when he
[33:36] finished with you so she was finished
[33:39] and then Adam eat and then they died and
[33:42] that's why we are here tonight green and
[33:44] getting old praise God and everybody
[33:46] think they could be young all the time
[33:47] and they could be strong all the time
[33:49] but even things I said I said Sunday if
[33:52] things going good right now it will
[33:53] always go good because everything have a
[33:55] season and time if they're going smooth
[33:57] it will never go smooth because every
[33:59] season everything has a time for
[34:01] everything under heaven and if things
[34:03] going bad right now it wouldn't always
[34:04] be that way
[34:16] Oh Glory to God you believe that
[34:19] the Abraham had to watch himself and
[34:21] we're going to go down and a great story
[34:23] on the road back he met the possessive
[34:25] him on Earth which is the king of
[34:28] Jerusalem king of Salem I watched he had
[34:30] no father no mother he never did begin
[34:32] he never will end nothing else but the
[34:34] almighty and he met him on the road from
[34:36] the slaughter of the king he met the
[34:37] possessor the one who owned all things
[34:40] met him on the road back what a glorious
[34:42] thing you want to get to know I like
[34:44] this Abraham was heir to All by the
[34:47] promise so he could lay claim to
[34:49] everything that was in the lamb the lamb
[34:51] itself Abraham had been given the
[34:54] promise we understand that Abraham was
[34:57] the poorest man in all the country
[34:58] because they live out in the desert he
[35:01] lived in peace with God and lot Rich
[35:02] live in the city become the governor of
[35:04] the city he sat in the gate he was a
[35:06] judge judging the city all the riches
[35:08] and Abraham was in a desert perhaps the
[35:10] poorest man in the land and yet a claim
[35:12] to possess all
[35:13] or tonight we may not be rich in world's
[35:16] Goods but we possess all things the
[35:19] church itself possesses all things but
[35:22] there's a statement there's a factor
[35:24] whether you see it or not understand it
[35:26] or not that is still soil God not taken
[35:28] back that you know that God not a God's
[35:30] emotional the church itself possesses
[35:33] all things whether you're blind whether
[35:35] you're ignorant whether you don't know
[35:37] it's still possess all things
[35:39] Oh Glory to God you will wake up tonight
[35:41] hallelujah praise God yet poor yet Rich
[35:44] possess all things and today the True
[35:46] Believer is constant among the people
[35:48] called fanatic holy ruler some kind of
[35:50] insulting name but blessed are the meek
[35:52] but they shall inherit the earth you
[35:54] talk about push out in the cabin
[35:55] somewhere hardly enough money to pay a
[35:57] rent yet you owe it all have to work on
[36:00] tall and straight for a few dollars at
[36:02] the honest living to put shoes in a
[36:04] children's feet to Feed The Hungry Monk
[36:05] and yet or after everything there is the
[36:08] meek shall inherit the earth they
[36:10] possess it they are possesses of the
[36:12] earth what is the believer the believer
[36:15] has that title The Believer has an
[36:17] abstract deal do we are believers here
[36:20] tonight I am talking about you the
[36:22] Believers have a title they believe I
[36:24] have an abstract deed that by right by
[36:26] Jesus Christ oh give the Lord some
[36:28] praises and Abraham could possess that
[36:31] to him what was on it God give it to him
[36:33] and lot was part of that land so even
[36:36] though Allah was a sucker God Abraham
[36:39] knew that man was his own and luck was
[36:41] part of that man so he could go after
[36:42] that sucker and I was wondering what
[36:44] adoption is about we'll give the Lord a
[36:46] shout you know people talk about
[36:47] adoption but they're kindly but they
[36:49] leave out the part about going after the
[36:50] loss adoption that second in church and
[36:52] having my church and having a glorious
[36:54] time Dynamic adoption Oh Glory to God
[36:56] adoption is going after your Fallen
[36:58] brother the backseating brother not your
[37:01] Eternal lost no the lost brother in the
[37:03] message that's what adoption is about
[37:05] okay the Lord a a praise in the
[37:07] house Oh Glory to God abduction not you
[37:10] sitting in church it had people dying
[37:12] fall off the map fall into the crack
[37:14] somebody gonna go after them because
[37:16] their name is on the book and they we
[37:18] can't go until they come or give the
[37:20] Lord some Praises you hear what I said
[37:22] we can't go until they come and God will
[37:25] make that a living reality to wake you
[37:27] up inside of here or give the Lord some
[37:29] Praises oh blessed be the name of the
[37:32] Lord
[37:33] says no you made me a promise that was
[37:36] this this land and all in mind you made
[37:38] me a promise no my King's man has been
[37:41] taken and all he got is gone in other
[37:43] words so he's switching off from that
[37:45] natural type to what we will see today
[37:46] in other words if I apply today as a
[37:49] church could say Lord God here's my
[37:51] brother he's linear strict with cancer
[37:53] get the answer Gideon we're talking
[37:55] about coming in the car here he's
[37:57] talking about the cancer he's tricking
[37:58] with tuberculosis he's got so and so I
[38:01] lay a whole of the promise it's my
[38:03] possession you told me so there you are
[38:05] then you can go after an enemy that
[38:07] devil this person have a stroke this
[38:09] person have a cancer this person have
[38:11] been crippled this person whatever it is
[38:13] it wasn't blind and you can say Lord I
[38:15] claim it and I'm going after them they
[38:17] may not have the faith but I come to
[38:18] unite my faith with them to get them out
[38:20] of that condition you're not coming to
[38:21] God to bless them you know you're coming
[38:23] for God to deliver them all to the
[38:24] condition to break the pans of
[38:25] wickedness to break the the pants of

[49:48] him he think they must run away slaves
[49:51] and that time they were loosed from the
[49:54] hand of the enemy okay the Lord I shout
[49:56] so when you're walking away from bondage
[49:58] the devil always believed you are his
[50:00] one he want to take you back but tell
[50:02] the devil you belong to him
[50:04] you belong to God tonight don't give the
[50:06] Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah
[50:09] let's go the promise is yours but if you
[50:12] ever get it if you ever get it so you
[50:14] see a man with a promise manifested you
[50:16] know what happened
[50:29] know every son that
[50:31] commit to God must be
[50:33] try
[50:34] I'm tested because you have to be
[50:36] considered Worthy full Glory that God
[50:39] will give me these promises so the
[50:40] promise is yours but if you ever get it
[50:42] you Ingo to get it easy I'm going to
[50:44] tell you that you're going to have to
[50:46] take it away from Satan Satan captures
[50:49] your health you have a right to go to
[50:51] sleep and say give it back hand it over
[50:53] I come in the name of the Lord the
[50:55] possessor of heavens and it I am his
[50:58] Heir give it back you took my child you
[51:02] gotta mix up with the wrong boy you took
[51:04] my boy you're gonna mix up with the
[51:06] wrong girl I claim them that's right I
[51:09] claim my children do you pray that I
[51:11] claim my brother I claim my sister yes
[51:14] Satan you took them from God's house
[51:16] cooks them out there but I'm coming
[51:17] after them I claim them how do you know
[51:21] but I'm a heir of all things
[51:22] Oh Glory to God I am an heir of all
[51:25] things it's given to me I am an heir I
[51:29] can claim everything that God promised
[51:31] me it is mine how do you get it
[51:33] something you don't know sir it's the
[51:35] unmerited gift that God gave us it is
[51:38] ours it belongs to us and Satan cannot
[51:41] hold it if you go to him in
[51:45] the scriptural authoritative word
[51:49] number
[52:05] all right scriptural
[52:07] authoritative word with faith to say it
[52:10] is mine he said lay it down you say amen
[52:13] glory I like that Satan you laid down
[52:16] you took it from me you give it back
[52:17] because I am serving notice on you I've
[52:20] got the notice written here on the word
[52:23] Heaven Earth will pass away but there's
[52:24] nothing shall not I come with this
[52:26] notice of serve on you that Jesus Christ
[52:28] said whatsoever I ask a father in my
[52:30] name all these promises are rocking you
[52:32] know he will give it to me and I say to
[52:34] this mountain don't talk to my heart he
[52:36] shall come to pass I lay it down I come
[52:38] with script till about 30. I am a
[52:40] believer could you say that I am a
[52:43] believer Oh Glory to God there are
[52:45] certain things that have access to
[52:47] Believers unbelievers is a different
[52:49] thing but I am a believer Oh Glory lay
[52:51] it down I am a believer Oh Glory to God
[52:53] when a sinner here we go when a sinner
[52:57] can see you don't have to say
[52:59] a lot of people say they sin because
[53:01] they have to sin that's a pitiful ship
[53:03] when you can see you have to say but
[53:05] when you realize
[53:06] that you don't have to sin anymore
[53:08] there's people that stand up and curse
[53:10] and laugh in your face and call you an
[53:12] idiot they are willful Sinners there's
[53:15] no hope for them
[53:16] but that man
[53:18] who does something constantly they don't
[53:21] want to do it he steals he don't want to
[53:24] he lies he don't want to he does things
[53:27] he doesn't want to do he don't want to
[53:30] be a sinner There's Hope for him
[53:33] if you can let him see the truth
[53:36] come up to God's promise and lay your
[53:39] faith on that and walk out there to the
[53:41] enemy so God looks at somebody heart and
[53:43] intent sometimes and that's why the
[53:45] Bible talk about enough some have
[53:47] compassion making a difference between a
[53:50] weak believer and from a brute peace
[53:53] because some people don't care
[53:55] there are some people weak in the flesh
[53:57] and they'll be tempted by this and
[53:59] they're being moved by this and
[54:00] influenced by this and the Bible says
[54:02] and have some
[54:04] have compassion make a difference of
[54:07] these kind of people in the church
[54:10] or give the Lord some praises
[54:12] don't tell my wife there's some people
[54:13] only like talk
[54:16] here
[54:19] you want somebody that they could just
[54:21] talk talk talk they don't want to take
[54:23] word they don't want to take counsel
[54:25] they don't want to apply what's being
[54:27] spoken to them they're just like long
[54:28] talk the longer they talk the better The
[54:30] View
[54:32] foreign
[54:38] because you see you want to know that
[54:41] after you spoke to someone they could
[54:43] act upon what they're being told
[54:46] because that's the solution there it's
[54:48] not right
[54:49] no we are Heirs of all things we are
[54:51] Heirs of all things the Bible says we're
[54:53] ears of all things we don't possess it
[54:54] yet
[54:56] no no no don't miss it he's saying it
[54:58] very plain we don't possess it yet but
[55:01] it is ours
[55:05] come on it belongs to the people the
[55:08] Believers the bride of Christ own every
[55:10] Speck of it Russia fighting for it
[55:13] United States fighting for that this one
[55:15] fighting over here and they call us
[55:17] crazy
[55:19] and all is going to fall heir to it let
[55:22] them fuss and blow up one another we are
[55:24] the one that gets it
[55:25] [Applause]
[55:27] Give the Lord some praises
[55:29] glory to God so when you come to be
[55:32] prayed for if you want salvation if you
[55:34] want Divine Healing no matter if you are
[55:36] a Believer you are heir of every promise
[55:39] so lay your faith upon the promise and
[55:41] match towards it and give it back give
[55:43] it back it's mine don't let him Bluff
[55:44] you stand right down the line he will
[55:46] give it back he stayed on that
[55:48] foundation of the promised world and you
[55:50] know he was the heir watch I like this
[55:52] part
[55:53] he wasn't it the one Abraham right after
[55:55] the promise had been vitigated to him he
[55:57] had fellowship with the promiser I like
[55:59] that after God made the promise and see
[56:01] Abraham here we go back hungry had never
[56:04] had a test before of that kind
[56:08] he knowed it all belonged to him that
[56:11] was a promise but he never had to fight
[56:13] the army
[56:15] so you know Ariana says everything is
[56:17] his lot and everything else but he
[56:19] didn't shout out to tea if there's 30 if
[56:21] there's 25 he never fight before the
[56:24] same this this thing Rusty but I'm
[56:27] dramatized the four crossed the Cutlass
[56:29] Rusty there was no army people and yet
[56:32] Abraham going down
[56:49] fight
[56:55] Shield they're gonna fight
[56:58] what Abraham had never had a test of
[57:02] that kind so he knowed it all belonged
[57:04] to him that was a promise yet he never
[57:06] had to fight an army he didn't know
[57:07] nothing he wasn't trained man to fight
[57:09] Abraham wasn't a fighter he was a farmer
[57:11] Abraham could do nothing because he was
[57:13] not a soldier his man wasn't soldiers
[57:15] they were farmers so the only he could
[57:18] do was to take God's promise put his
[57:20] faith upon the promise and move out
[57:23] move out with what you got
[57:25] with your fork with your speed with your
[57:27] whole with whatever you have with a
[57:29] branch a statement you have Oh Glory to
[57:32] God where are you going you're going to
[57:33] fight I'm gonna bring back luck
[57:35] and guess what at the equal sign they
[57:37] brought back lord forget how they did it
[57:39] they did it or give the Lord some
[57:40] praises and as the equal sign there's
[57:42] gonna be a pride Revival right here in
[57:44] Trinidad and around the world there's
[57:46] going to be a seven Thunderbird Revival
[57:48] there's gonna be a mighty Holy Ghost
[57:50] called pouring the shout of the king
[57:52] will be in the camp Oh Glory to God
[57:54] don't study how we get in there we're
[57:56] gonna get there we have to get there
[57:58] because God said so okay the Lord some
[58:00] Praises Hallelujah
[58:03] let's go so if you never receive the
[58:05] Holy Ghost as yet don't know nothing
[58:07] about it
[58:08] something in your heart telling you you
[58:10] want it you stay right there that is
[58:13] eternal life and that you are heir to
[58:15] that stay right there and look Satan
[58:17] right in the face and say you are a
[58:19] robber you are the one I come to possess
[58:21] what Jesus died for me no hand it back
[58:23] get out of my way then the first thing
[58:25] you know the Holy Ghost will pour it
[58:27] upon you

[1:06:00] and now God take my sins and put it in
[1:06:03] the sea of his forgetfulness you marry
[1:06:05] remember but when God put it in his sea
[1:06:08] of forgetfulness not even God himself
[1:06:10] could remember it not even God himself
[1:06:12] could bring it back up that is why you
[1:06:14] could be justified as if you never did
[1:06:16] it only God could justify and then we
[1:06:19] read the Scripture it is God that
[1:06:20] justify it oh give the Lord a shout oh
[1:06:23] man I justifying you they want to find
[1:06:25] fault with you oh with a god
[1:06:28] foreign
[1:07:01] them
[1:07:02] all them laugh I wasn't laughing I was
[1:07:05] dead serious
[1:07:06] because it ought not to be that way
[1:07:11] if a brother foreign
[1:07:19] people be careful because you could be
[1:07:22] backslide also you have to restore with
[1:07:24] wisdom restored understanding restore
[1:07:26] with humility restore with the
[1:07:28] understanding that even was in the grace
[1:07:29] of God you also would fall
[1:07:32] so you are being held in God's hands by
[1:07:34] God's grace
[1:07:36] and any man could slip and slide and
[1:07:38] backslide but who's going to pick him up
[1:07:40] who's going to raise him up who's going
[1:07:42] to go after him there's got to be
[1:07:43] adoption there's got to be genuine
[1:07:45] adopted Sons you see adopted Sons is
[1:07:47] Christ Ministry in men going after
[1:07:49] Fallen Brothers many want to do that
[1:07:51] because they want to raise a flag that
[1:07:53] they're so right and they want to see by
[1:07:55] outing your light their light shine
[1:07:56] brighter there's a light
[1:07:58] they will tell them that that's an older
[1:08:00] person like this
[1:08:04] and God put a week straight on an oil
[1:08:06] and they believe so
[1:08:16] yeah the fuel any fire
[1:08:19] do you feel the Revival
[1:08:22] they're fuelingly anointed
[1:08:24] getting a greater Faith now that people
[1:08:26] shut them out of the critics let them
[1:08:28] criticize okay the Lord some Praises
[1:08:31] criticism be shocked Oh Glory to God
[1:08:34] hallelujah
[1:08:37] amen do you believe that
[1:08:39] all right
[1:08:41] hallelujah praise God
[1:08:44] thank you Jesus thank you Jesus
[1:08:46] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:08:49] oh my oh my oh my
[1:08:52] God praise be to Jesus so he's speaking
[1:08:54] just all day about two kind of knowledge
[1:08:57] and
[1:08:58] and this is something that I look at
[1:09:00] something called genesco maybe they're
[1:09:02] pronouncing the word right is
[1:09:04] g-i-n-o-s-q-o another word called oider
[1:09:08] o-i-d-e do a Greek words one of them
[1:09:10] this word genesco this word generally
[1:09:13] refers to knowledge again to personal
[1:09:16] experience or perception it implies that
[1:09:19] deeper experiential understanding of
[1:09:22] something or someone it conveys the idea
[1:09:24] of knowing through an intimate
[1:09:26] relationship or direct example for
[1:09:29] example Matthew 7 23 when Jesus said I
[1:09:32] will declare them I never knew you
[1:09:33] depart from me what he's also saying is
[1:09:36] not that he doesn't know them he doesn't
[1:09:38] know them in relationship they never had
[1:09:40] a relationship with him I never knew you
[1:09:41] depart from me you workers of iniquity
[1:09:43] okay I never knew you no order
[1:09:48] this word generally refers to knowledge
[1:09:50] that is intuitive or acquired through
[1:09:52] mental perception it signifies knowing
[1:09:55] something without necessarily having
[1:09:58] experienced it full sun it can imply a
[1:10:02] more intellectual or cognitive
[1:10:03] understanding for example in John 21 17
[1:10:06] Jesus asked Peter three times do you
[1:10:07] love me and Peter receives response Lord
[1:10:10] you know
[1:10:11] he's saying Lord you know oider all
[1:10:14] things you know either that I loved you
[1:10:17] you hear no is translated from either
[1:10:19] indicating a knowledge that comes from
[1:10:21] Jesus divine understands God you know
[1:10:24] praise God it is important to note that
[1:10:26] these words are sometimes used in
[1:10:27] decisionably and something like that but
[1:10:29] I just want to bring it to you tonight
[1:10:30] that there's two knowing no both are
[1:10:33] important because you have to have the
[1:10:35] knowledge of the word which is God in
[1:10:36] print and you have to have a knowledge
[1:10:38] of God by knowing by relationship
[1:10:40] do you get that
[1:10:42] so so so knowledge of God so it both
[1:10:46] works together it's not that we're
[1:10:48] trying to hit intellect in that way but
[1:10:50] to show that the knowing that we expect
[1:10:52] that there's a Bible talk about uh uh
[1:10:55] you shall know as you are known
[1:10:57] all glory to God that's a deeper
[1:10:59] knowledge and the prophet call it
[1:11:01] perfect realization that's that's going
[1:11:03] to be unintellectual understanding that
[1:11:05] you getting in his own Oh Glory they've
[1:11:08] got to realize how God realizes the
[1:11:10] sense how God sends to feel how God feel
[1:11:13] to catch the intelligence or the mind of
[1:11:15] God oh glory to God hallelujah enter
[1:11:18] into the position not knowing just what
[1:11:21] God done but why he has done it Oh Glory
[1:11:23] to God has the intimacy of the
[1:11:26] relationship with God or give the Lord
[1:11:28] some Praises Hallelujah do you love him
[1:11:31] tonight
[1:11:31] oh do you get it now
[1:11:34] Oh Glory to God hallelujah blessed be
[1:11:37] the name of the Lord praise God praise
[1:11:40] God praise God so do I speak with
[1:11:42] tongues of men and angels First
[1:11:44] Corinthians 13.
[1:11:45] speakers have no charity and become a
[1:11:49] strong Embrace something December don't
[1:11:51] have the gift of Prophecy understand all
[1:11:53] Mysteries and all knowledge though I
[1:11:55] have all Faith so I can move mountains
[1:11:56] I'm not charity I am nothing so this is
[1:11:59] identify the knowledge could be so
[1:12:00] powerful knowing all Mysteries and still
[1:12:03] not connected to the source which is the
[1:12:05] charity the Capstone of divine love
[1:12:07] Hallelujah have all knowledge
[1:12:09] preaching to ministers preaching to
[1:12:11] churches have Mighty Ministries but not
[1:12:14] tapped into charity
[1:12:16] charity has not been expressed all glory
[1:12:19] Charities that mean men manifest
[1:12:20] Charities suffered law and is kind that
[1:12:24] not for amen does not provoke it
[1:12:27] buried all things believe in all things
[1:12:30] enjoyed all things charging never
[1:12:31] failing so when you squeeze charity oh
[1:12:35] God it must come out man love must come
[1:12:37] out virtue must come out oh glory to God
[1:12:40] hallelujah you squeezing look at my
[1:12:42] charity and knowledge coming out
[1:12:43] information coming out Mysteries coming
[1:12:45] out Revelations coming out but the love
[1:12:48] divine is not coming out okay the Lord
[1:12:50] some Praises who is Thy Neighbor
[1:12:57] [Applause]
[1:13:02] Oh Glory this one have this ministry and
[1:13:05] that one in the apostolic realm and this
[1:13:06] one in the prophetic realm and that one
[1:13:08] in the pastor Raymond everybody passing
[1:13:10] them straight
[1:13:11] an old publican
[1:13:13] pick up that man
[1:13:15] put them inside the hotel and so on and
[1:13:17] pay and see when I come back off if
[1:13:19] there's anything more and she said who
[1:13:21] is your neighbor
[1:13:22] who's the neighbor
[1:13:24] how much you ever listens there whole
[1:13:26] Revolution compared to the life how
[1:13:28] we're connecting to the voice
[1:13:30] is something to check the devil
[1:13:33] Oh Glory to God do I know all Mysteries
[1:13:35] have all knowledge have no charity
[1:13:37] so glory to God Chapel charity suffered
[1:13:40] long in His Kind when I was a child I
[1:13:43] speak like a child on a like a
[1:13:44] child I told her the child but when I
[1:13:46] became a man I put away childish things
[1:13:48] but now we see through a glass Darkly
[1:13:49] but then face to face now I know in part
[1:13:52] that's what knew in part but then shall
[1:13:56] I know even also I am known nor by that
[1:14:00] faith hope and charity these three the
[1:14:02] greatest theater charity oh my
[1:14:04] glory to God
[1:14:06] how almost done music on please
[1:14:08] Ephesians 4
[1:14:10] we want to look at it and Amplified
[1:14:12] same 11 to 13. and his gifts were varied
[1:14:15] he give him himself appointed and give
[1:14:17] up men to us some to be Apostles special
[1:14:20] Messengers some prophets inspired
[1:14:22] preachers and exponents some evangelists
[1:14:24] preachers of the Gospel travel the
[1:14:26] missionaries some pastors Shepherds of
[1:14:27] the flock and teachers his intention was
[1:14:31] the perfecting and the full equipping of
[1:14:34] the Saints his consecrated people that
[1:14:38] they should do the work of ministering
[1:14:41] towards building up Christ's body the
[1:14:43] church
[1:14:44] I want to get to now
[1:14:46] that it might develop
[1:14:48] until we attain Oneness in faith and in
[1:14:52] comprehension of the full accurate
[1:14:55] knowledge of the Son of God that we
[1:14:58] might arrive
[1:14:59] purpose of that knowledge that we might
[1:15:02] arrive at really mature manhood
[1:15:06] the completeness of the personality
[1:15:09] which is nothing less that the standard
[1:15:11] height of Christ's own Perfection the
[1:15:14] measure of the stature of the fullness
[1:15:16] of Christ and the completions from him
[1:15:19] children
[1:15:25] that their sins are forgiven and we're
[1:15:27] showing how certain knowledge apply
[1:15:30] to certain stages of growth
[1:15:32] so you cannot put adoption to a child
[1:15:34] because the child portion is the
[1:15:37] appreciation of the Forgiveness of sins
[1:15:39] I write unto the young men because they
[1:15:42] are strong you overcome the wicked one
[1:15:43] so as you grow in God the knowledge
[1:15:47] unveils to that level of growth but the
[1:15:50] object is to get you I write you fathers
[1:15:52] that you know him from the beginning
[1:15:55] oh Gloria that's a deeper knowledge as
[1:15:58] you grow in God a deeper knowledge you
[1:16:00] know him from the beginning oh praise
[1:16:02] God let's see if you could wrap up here
[1:16:03] now oh glory to God hallelujah glory to
[1:16:07] God so faith is designed to see what God
[1:16:10] wills and wants there's no knowledge can
[1:16:12] do that faith alone is designed and give
[1:16:16] the human race to find out what the will
[1:16:18] of God is and you take your faith your
[1:16:20] God you don't focus with the word then
[1:16:22] leave it alone you got the wrong feet
[1:16:23] when your god-given faith Focus you with
[1:16:27] the word of God you are directly
[1:16:29] enlightened zeroed God help us in this
[1:16:31] hour
[1:16:32] faith is designed to see what God wants
[1:16:35] you to see through the camera of his
[1:16:37] word his promise this is the full
[1:16:39] revelation of Jesus Christ and when your
[1:16:42] faith that is in you focus you to this
[1:16:43] word you are focused away from all the
[1:16:46] Innovation and Creeds you are focused
[1:16:48] straight on the word of God you are
[1:16:51] zeroed in it all needs a little touch
[1:16:53] off and that prayer flies straight in
[1:16:54] the presence of God nothing can stop it
[1:16:57] glory to God his word is always the
[1:17:00] truth always the truth his belief in
[1:17:03] children belief for it and cry for it
[1:17:05] until his word is Vindicated you hear
[1:17:08] that
[1:17:09] they don't just want the word you know
[1:17:10] they want the word
[1:17:12] Vindicated
[1:17:14] and his word is always his will
[1:17:17] if you want to know what the will of God
[1:17:19] is find it in the Bible
[1:17:21] it is God's word any contrary that is
[1:17:23] perverted o praise God so you see now
[1:17:27] you're talking about the Pentecostal
[1:17:29] tongues and the next is the eyes
[1:17:30] prophetic Malachi for the next is the
[1:17:33] intelligence so after seeing Prophet
[1:17:36] next intelligence we have no
[1:17:38] intelligence of our own we have no sight
[1:17:40] of our own and so forth and he governs
[1:17:43] the body all the way through
[1:17:47] the intelligence which is the mind of
[1:17:49] Christ to know what to do with the word
[1:17:50] the thing that matters with the message
[1:17:52] today those who obtain it in their
[1:17:54] hearts must lay in the presence of the
[1:17:56] sun to get ripened you can pick up the
[1:17:58] message and let the sun dig all the
[1:18:00] greenness out of you making matured
[1:18:02] Christians see what I mean God is coming
[1:18:05] to receive his search and we must have
[1:18:07] that type of Christian for him to
[1:18:09] receive the wheat has to get ripe oh
[1:18:12] praise God Amen
[1:18:14] glory to God hallelujah do you get it
[1:18:18] now all right let's sit down here now
