the reign of God upon your life amen oh praise the Lord God bless you thanks for coming God bless you welcome I wanna know I'll be so glad to be in the house of God this morning we want to go straight to the word if you have your Bibles and I can return to Luke chapter 17. we want to read verse 20 to 30. we want to turn after the first Corinthians chapter four one verse 20. and we want to read Mark 16 verse 15 to 20. so Luke chapter 17 reading from verse 20. and when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God commit not with observation neither shall they say Lo here or Lo dear for behold the kingdom of God is within you and he said to his disciples the days will come when you shall desire to see one of the Deeds of the son of man and he shall not see it and they shall say to you see here see there go not after them not follow them for as the lightning that lightened out of one part on the heaven shine it unto the other part of the heaven so shall also the son of man be in his day but fist must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it also been the days of the son of man did it eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was on days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it but the same day that what went out of Salam it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed and First Corinthians chapter 4 verse 20. for the kingdom of God is not in Word but in power let me Delegate for the kingdom of God is not in Word but in power our last scripture from Mark 16 15 and he said unto them go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he doesn't believe in US baptized shall be saved he does believeth not shall be damned these son shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and soon enough to the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sudden on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following may God bless his word let's pray one more time father we have read your word and any man can read scriptures Lord but to take the Holy Spirit to come and breathe life into it Lord we pray the bread of God will bring life into your people Lord that they stand like a mighty marching Army granted Lord in Jesus amen you may be seated and I just sit down give God some praises thank you welcome again it's good to be the host of God always good to be in God's house this is more important than your job home family this is where you get Divine instructions this is where you come under Covenant this is where you get the connection with the supernatural with the protection with the word with a directive of the Lord into your life all glory to God not everybody is ordined to speak into your life but God have Ministry to speak into your life by the word of God the right things that you must hear coming into your life do you believe that we'll have a title this morning call back to the original Faith the bride that's the title call back to the original Faith the bride and have an inspiration faith is the key that luck unlocks every treasure in the kingdom of God faith is the key that unlocks every treasure in the kingdom of God Hallelujah now the scripture we read First Corinthians chapter 4 verse 20 and the Amplified it was scripted read for the kingdom is not a word but in power but in the Amplified is written for the kingdom of God consists of and is based not on talk but on power moral power and Excellence of soul Hallelujah that's why we talk about the kingdom of God John was preaching the kingdom of God is at hand Jesus was preaching the kingdom of God my kingdom is not of this world so he was presenting people another kingdom that they never saw they never heard about they never experienced and he was about to introduce to them this thing called the kingdom of God because they were living in the Kingdom of this world but he was talking about a higher level a higher order a higher world called the kingdom of God Amen no misread back here so describing Pharisees they demanded of him when the kingdom should come this Kingdom wait when it should come and Jesus said the kingdom cometh not with observation so what you're looking for you're looking for a cloud you're looking for you look at what what are you looking for you're looking for this you're looking for that what what are you looking for you see he said behold the kingdom is within you oh my Hallelujah so he was dismissing all the physical and notable things the people said the kingdom of God coming and he said this Kingdom had to be within you but that itself is a revelation how does the kingdom come into someone because God's object is to get the kingdom within you and we find out God was above us pillar fire and Moses time God With Us in Jesus Christ and then the holy ghost coming to you and Jesus told them I if I don't go the comforter will not come and I am the comforter which is the power which is the Dynamics is not with you but it shall be in you so I have to get somewhere to reconnect you to the power that's supposed to commit in you you don't have it no but you have that to get you don't have it now but you have a promise of it you don't have it yet but you're gonna get it because there is something in you to receive it you can't get it if there's nothing you need to receive it you have to have the ability to receive so God put the receiver inside you first and cover that receiver with dirt with mud with filth with unbelief with all kind of things around that but it's still inside of you you went through hell you went through trials you went to tribulation but it's still there you fall sick but it's still there somebody could go crazy but it's still there nothing can't change that because if God put that seed in your soul and the devil don't have the authority to go inside your soul you can mess with your mind he can mess with your body but he can't mess with your soul that seed is predestinated that seal is elected oh [Applause] let me see it again he could fool with your body he could fool with your spirit but he cannot fool with those soul because only the word is a designer of the thoughts and intents of the heart the devil is not the word he cannot go inside of your heart and mess up inside a deer God put that germ inside of there that's why you don't know who you are he didn't know who Jesus was he keeps saying that though he is Dolby and Dolby he watching your stinking flesh and misinterpreting who you are because of what you was because what you're doing right now but he's not seeing what you have to become [Applause] he's trying to nail you by your failures he's trying to nail you by your sins he's trying to nail you by your past but God already consider your future already done so he chose you before the foundation of the world and he's not going down and choose you he's not going to Hallelujah maybe season he's not going to undo his choice before there was even born he said Jacob I love he so I hate Oh Glory to God because he knew what they will do and God knew what you're gonna do yes you know you're gonna make things right you know you're gonna say I am sorry forgive me you know all of that before he even glory to God hallelujah [Applause] Oh Glory to God hallelujah glory to God hallelujah God fire is in the building you may be seated you think God didn't see your life messed up tied up tangled up and wrapped up and all kind of foolishness you think God didn't understand that why you think your life gets so messed up and tied up they never want to finish you a long time there's ever always try to cut off potential because once they get into maturity he is finished Oh Glory to God that's why he killed all them babies two years and under kill what is the potential but once you come into maturity is finished because here the prophecy hanging over you at that day Saint John 14 20 you shall know I am in the father you and me and I in you the devil don't want you to come to that day that bear is coming for you oh give the Lord a shout the devil don't want you to come to that day [Applause] because that day brings you from partial realization into perfect realization that day brings you know an impact that you will know you are known okay the Lord [Applause] may be sit you may be seasoned [Applause] amen the way God knows you is not how your father know you your mother know you or your husband know you or your wife know you the way God know you is different people see you as sinner but when Jesus was praying he said father Oh Glory to God you they were with me before the world was keep them keep them keep them oh give the Lord our soap Revelation is breaking in this morning [Applause] yeah I'm gonna be season God is not now waking up this morning I'm getting an idea I want to help them I'm feeling selfish this morning I want to bless them I feeling blesses God is not waking up to that idea about who you are no no no no no all that the father hat past tense given me shall come not maybe not perhaps shall come I'm gonna lose none of them but I loses thoughts that is eternal that's the back part of his mind I don't care what adultery what lie what fornication what until living how much man how much manual Liberty doesn't matter that's why he found the woman of the world that's why he called The Prostitute acting adultery that's why he found rehab that's really for all them Believers All Through the Ages he found them because their name was on the book and Satan Lucifer himself can't stop you from coming forward I am confident this morning that the one who started working you it's evil is able to complete it he's not finished with you yet tell that Barry's a liar God is not finished with you yet thank you [Applause] let me see that [Applause] Jesus Jesus already said the kingdom of observation so you can go on some Bush somewhere on some money somewhere with some old clothes waiting for the coming of the Lord or going some bunker with some Thin food stuck enough God come into His foolishness plant like you're coming live like you come in tomorrow Planet could come in 20 years from now normalism not abnormal living normal living Jesus even said us wasn't it is a Noah he said they eat they drink they wasn't having binoculars looking out they wanted we come and look in the Stars looking for the moon and reading this stuff they were eaten they were drinking but there was something spiritual working out the day lot came out Fire film Hallelujah nothing can happen until you come out [Music] be bright enough to come out before fire go burn you know yeah yeah yeah yeah before the fire burned gonna deliver you and your family too [Applause] so if your family is not here you have to stand in the gap on behalf of your house [Applause] you become an intercessor you become a bridge you become her as a standard being raised the coming lord they're coming lord they're coming Lord [Applause] that is why when rehab hold those spies give my talking for good because no judgment coming and I do all your good I want to do but good for me they said put this Red Cloud outside and Joshua want to pass you over she said can I bring my uncle my tanti my grandmother my uncle family the old Tiffany family too the lion the family I could bring them to yes anybody under that pocket anybody under that blood when I see the blood alcohol don't give up on anyone drop the prey on them drop the blood on them drop prey on them put it on them let the devil know you're coming after them you're coming after them in spirit you're coming after them and say Oh Glory of God faith is the key that got to lock every door you may be seated you ever see a door with no handle or don't want Nookie why you telling her though because they're locking up something there if the door room emptied you open the door it's empty but if they have Treasures behind that door you have to put a lock on it you can't buy a junkie look anybody just pick that lock you have to put a special kind of a look because you don't want no teeth Breaking Inside the idea so God lock up the kingdom you look up healing he'll lock up power he lock up gifts even shut up the heavens and all he said wait till them seven times after the voices that that group [Applause] they're gonna slice and cut that means seven Thunders get fed and faith is the key to unlock [Music] [Applause] all glory to God so you think God give us a key to do nothing to explain how the key is a key long there's nothing to turn and when you lock the key so that you know the purpose of a key you have an exact for 50 years the key of a door you try this door is open it's not that door for that key you have to get the right key for the right door but there's only one door to the kingdom and Jesus said I am the door oh give the Lord a shout one door [Applause] and you have to get the key to open that door and once that door is open the door God open no man let the Lord I shout I never caught up on that door for you today no man no Priest No Bishop no husband no wife no children to shut that door go to your deliverance the door for your breakthrough not just Natural Bridge through your financial victory any breaks you talking about God have a daughter that claim every Redemptive blessing go short yourself and begin claims God wants

family it fall over to your loved ones this blessing must pour over Oh Glory to God from the cup into the saucer okay the Lord I shall guess blessing must be all over you your family must see it your

no starting to get excited Oh Glory to God hallelujah and next time come to me here let me just check this out [Music] Oh Glory to God before I read this one here can we read this year Luke 18 8 after Luke 17 30 Solomon revealed himself he said when the son of man come out shall he find faith on the Earth is either fat or fear [Music] he just had two things fate or fear this gospel come to remove the fear from you because it cannot be perfected on the fear faith is made perfect by love you have to come into love for Faith to be perfected you can't operate under fear fear the devil fear the marketing peace fear depressed coming down and feared it cause only churches fear for what he's a dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadows of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my God in him will I trust surely he will deliver thee from the state of the Fowler from the noisome pestilence he shall cover you with his feathers under his wings shall not trust his truth shall be thy shield and bakla thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor the arrow that's fired by tear nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness no for the destruction that pasted that newly and thousands shall fall on thy side ten thousand are thy right hand but it shall not come nigh be [Applause] in the house how many going to agree with that how many could unite themselves with this word [Applause] therefore no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come night I dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep being all thy ways Oh Glory to God hallelujah [Applause] this is our promise not virus come in and play coming they're coming but our promises sons of God will stop the plagues stop the virus stop whatever coming that's the power that God wants in the sons of God Oh Glory do not run from this and run for stop it sit on your Cambodia you can't go there amen he'll be seated behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon the same man was just an evout waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost that he will not will not until the Lord see the Lord's Christ this Revelation brought faith which brought an expectation for manifestation so faith is not talk her faith what that's supposed to do a revelation brings expectation for something faith is the key to get you to where you're going the Bible says faith is the substance of what you're hoping for so a lot of things people think they have they really don't have because Faith make you act different talk different live different see different amen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen [Music] there must be faith to accompany expectation and there are only two elements in the world that controls the world tonight fear and faith Russia is trying to get everybody to fear them and we are trying to get everybody to have faith in God that's the difference that is the Two element control Nations control all people control all churches control individual it is fear of faith [Music] I wanted to do it today but it was just I just didn't want to do it put a glass here for you and put it halfway with water in it and asks you what you see so could you imagine a glass here and it's halfway and I asked what do you see and some will say I see a glass half full and somebody will say I see a glass half empty psychologists will say the person who say half empty is negative base the person will say her full is positive based but both of what they're seeing is right they have empty person seen as halfway done to finish they have full personal scene is halfway down to full to get to the top what do you see it comes a question of perspective so if your perspective in life is negative it affects your marriage it's the fact how you view the world it affects how you see others because your base is negative Jesus had us to get these guys until one base which is under the promise of God which is always positive I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you a little while the world see at me no more but you shall see me and because I live shugly also all his promises is positive all his promise is true you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you o glory to God hallelujah all his promises is true you shall be delivered you shall be free you shall be delivered Oh Glory to God so when God bring promises is real it is true it is direct to you oh Glory the God so God is trying to change your mind if we can get you to change your mind your entire life changes your entire world changes your perspective changes how you see Brethren how you see your husband how you see your wife how you see God's order Glory foreign oh Hallelujah because God have to speak to him you're praying for him to get Revelation inspiration discernment and Power because you want him to be on the power not under your mouth or get the Lord a shout don't get me started this morning don't get me started this morning you want that money in life to be under the power of God under the influence of God fear has no value to it it's perfectly endless it hasn't got one good thing about it if I was to be shot in the morning I was going to be shocked what good would it do to our fear what could we do me you say well what good will Faith do Faith could deliver me but fear won't help me one bit you could just get yourself worked up and more nervous than ever when it comes time for the gunfire so let's have faith because faith can produce a party that they'll shoot you Oh Glory to God say it could get the shooter get a heart attack and he dropped down dead and they say these things I'll continue oh get the Lord a shout care can't do nothing so stop fearing that it would not happen this revival will happen your healing will happen your deliverance it will happen have no fear have faith in God [Applause] couple of weeks of warn you already you know I say I agree mother look at this in them I will see what God put up on my heart I don't want you already you know Hallelujah you see appreciation service after service and service right hallelujah praise God Amen so anything can happen you know oh yes you believe that I believe that I own repentation for that anything could happen people walk straight out of the wheelchair blind rub the eye and just start to see anything could happen all things are possible to them that believe the Lord himself went everywhere with them confirming the word with signs following [Applause] not confirming the world with more word is the word already confirming the word with a word on top of that word and a wood on top I don't need to do that he sends his word and heal them oh God you don't ask somebody permission to heal he just send this word and heal them all manner of sicknesses all manner of diseases let me hear that again that is AIDS included all manner of sickness

Christ Oh Glory to God hallelujah glory to God I'm gonna preach the gospel brother now preach the gospel [Applause] in word but in power shout out power that's what the devil don't want you to get but you're gonna get power after the Holy Ghost come upon you be fighting for that Holy Ghost what's the all-time Holy Spirit and the devil won't go near it that's the reason people fear it but it's good enough for me this message is afraid of it only talk talk talk but we need a fire of God glory glory Glory the Holy Ghost as much as lacking Holy Ghost s Oh Glory to God Hallelujah in the beginning gross Darkness cover the Earth cause Darkness cover the Earth it was chaos it was Darkness but God said before God said the spirit of God began to move before God we speak you got the spirit of the move and before God speak you have to get in the spirit and the devil fight the worship fight the songs that inspire people fight the anointing have us had a dead moss back intellectual church members just shine up the anointing but we bust through that now though we bet you that sound barrier now though oh God you can't bind us no more no intellectual devil demon intellectual Spirits combine the Church of the Living God because this is going to be a church called back to the original faith [Applause] in action [Applause] these signs shall not maybe not perhaps not you following signs these signs shall follow not you see the pillar fire over my head and you're following me no not that these signs shall follow them that believe oh give the Lord I shout you don't have to follow me

commercialize all this bacon thing it have Jesus because they handle Bakery in them days you know everybody baking their own bread bread was the staff of Life bread was the week that they put in Long on the ground and the way before the Lord a chief had come to maturity it's announcing that other she's coming to all the corn that was connected to worshiped to God I offering to God the weak men

breaking and sharing breaking and sharing breaking and sharing or tell somebody call their sharing testify to somebody we're gonna break and share okay the Lord some praises [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] congratulations [Music] right [Music] so Jude when he told them unless he contend for the feet that was once delivered to the Saints the church was already backsliding Sliding Away to fake now once you started from the sixth sense you know what we mean it's just five senses the Sixth Sense is original that's what man had Sixth Sense which is a sense of faith when man fell from the six sins he fell to Five Senses see taste smell touch and then the human Spirit have imagination conscience imagination affection memories five senses of the spirits five sons of the flesh but these senses of the Flesh and spirit was the contact the Earth so you could smell the food you could shake somebody hand your feelings you have emotions and so on but that Faith sense was the contact God [Applause] and after you do all of the all of When You're Gone boy has inclusive and your feet start to activate it goes straight past your senses your feelings your emotions the day problems the situations your past it goes straight up to heaven okay and you get in contact with the supernatural power and a presence and the Devils have nothing to do with that it's just a pipe a channel when you're on your phone with God he can't come and break any line he can hack that line that line hack proof okay the Lord has shout in the house and listening on your conversation like you and God [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he couldn't make no calls I don't think before no value God run him out no communication and go say I go bring it back you know the last days mango have the real SIM card my sons in the last days go make some calls call him into action listen them to Hebrew boys demonstrated what his faith was like just tell them the Capri but some people the devil didn't tell you that you're not even praying talking to you they tell them fellas they can't pray they say what say we continue playing normal let me go open and pray normal three times a day they report them and

face your pressure with Grit face suppression with Grace here's the pressure but faith not here I want to run fail to here foreign [Music] because Jesus Christ is he saved yesterday today and forever so if I go back so far yesterday what happened today isn't he the same today so why you have to go back so far Israel knew all what God did they went back in the history openly Red Sea the openness they're talking and sharing the historical data of their tribe and their nation was standing right there then president you see what this do and that do and everybody their own testimony of all what God did with Abra oh boy my father Abraham boy 25 years that's our people that's nighttime Fellowship daytime when Goliath come up there then catch up the talk there's nighttime talk there's Fellowship around with the Brethren but when Goliath said send me your man to fight me it was the historical fate that was required it was not fair that God did something back there if this present tense go get the Lord I shout it needed a no faith because there's no problem your care faces are no problem with the historical faith oh God I feel inspired this morning you have to get the faith to deal with the accent that you need to know [Applause] when Goliath finish make his boost because you know they got break for the evening time that's what more Fellowship than to do so David brothers

island you know because they were stunned they basically you know my father sent me to bring these things for you and he said to put pressure on David you can see David was a guy that you said Richard

man all them fellas had historical data they only check in the iPhone and checking the phone and seeing what God did in the past and what God did with the prophet and God they're only doing it fasting

their hands God will do it oh hallelujah praise God there's got to be a bride called back to the original set the apostolic faith the faith that was once delivered to the Saints oh Hallelujah you may be seated praise God so he was talking to sanctified people preserved in Christ Jesus called he said you say the faith I was wonderful to the Saints not just if it some people say that's against my feet there's only one fate there's only one Lord there's only one baptism no people say well I have a faith and I go to my own church but that's not what Jude is speaking of here he is talking to the people that the content for the faith don't forget it not ace hate not message hate become a debate that was once delivered to the Saints you have to contend faith and fight Faith now if we can only find out there we go what defeat is then we can earnestly contend for that fate is that right Hallelujah if we can find out what what defect is then we can earnestly content for that fate what defeat now the Fate was once delivered to the scene so if you go back to where they were called Saints and find out what kind of Faith they had we will know more or less what they contend for now when the church was called Saint they were called sanctified Hallelujah say it means clean pure holy unadultered and so forth that was the beginning of the another when it was inaugurated under their Pentecost so let's look what they had back there what the church contended for no Jude wouldn't be talking about the Old Testament on the levitical laws he is a Christian he was talking about when the church was set in order was inaugurated on the day of Pentecost now we will notice what kind of faith that they had they had a faith here we go in a resurrected living Christ someone who rose from the dead and was living among them [Music] that wasn't a man unveiling teachings and revelation to live in Christ resurrected among them they knew he was among them when they come to church to not just coming to church they're coming to see him moving in and out him Healing The Sick him cast now Devils Oh Glory to God one time brother walk into a meeting he didn't preach as he walked in creepers had to

Jesus stop decide from preaching you know how he knows that yeah preaching preaching preaching preaching a boom push him out go on praise and worship stop writing no notes notes notes notes notes you had enough notes go on worship they were in the upper room praise and blessing God continually shout out continually they were creating an atmosphere now you want solution to your family your one solution to your house they want God to come in your midst now you have to create a way for him to come in on it John was sent to prepare a way for the coming Messiah God will just come so you have to

praise the Lord so in the upper room they were worshiping they were praising Mary was there Hallelujah the woman from the West she was there too some of them sisters who cried defeat him she was there too Peter was dead John was there what are you saying the pastor was there the apostle was there the prophet was there the Evangelist was there the Believers were this was all man Jack was upside down there was waiting for power Oh Glory to God nobody Exempted nobody excluded Peter Kia say I am Peter I'm feeling hurt to go out and take a walk no stay there until stay in the word until stay in the promise until stay in the channel until him do it perform on high power from an High I don't want no man to explain to me I have power coming [Applause] well you have it show it you have it they can't play for to take no signs no wonder Miracles and their power some of you feel the adopted alone because of some somebody making a long time they speak a word they're speaking they speak a word Lord if it's you and you know sometimes sometimes sometimes I get frightened down I didn't see it so I can follow me look for your life to be changed you won't a change life you don't want to be blessed you want a transformation when Jacob you may be sitting Jacob tricking everybody mother-in-law father-in-law you name it he could trick because that is nature he's a real reporter but he's a son it have some rip of artists who are Sons now if you watch the Artistry and you watch the behavior you will close the eyes and say no but God don't see us man see so that's why when you have strange eyes you don't like this one your blood categories one you need help you need Deliverance you need that not like a demon to be cast out because God love you as you are but he's not really letting you remain as you are he is changing you from what you are to what you are to become Oh Glory to God and his purpose and desire is that you be conformed to the image of his son you have your nature and he of his nature you might be a a man like Peter was an aggressive man a bowl man Lord if that you beat me to come there are people who are aggressive there's people who are quiet there's some people who are shy that's your nature but he have his nature and all of us have to be partakers of his divine nature so his nature after coming to you and that's why take out your shyness that will take out this that will take out your anger and temper because you are surrendering to his nature [Applause] and his nature is a nature of Power Man was destined to have power man is supposed to be in power Oh Glory not power over one another but Power very creeping things over sickness over Devils over diseases man one power over man Oh Glory to quarter before God gave power you have to show power over you come on say Amen somebody you have to have power over you [Applause] and the first stage of getting power over you is when you could own your behavior let me say it again when you could own up to your Behavior because decisions produces actions and actions of consequences and when you reap the fruit of your consequences based upon your actions then you have a decision whether to make excuses or own up the prodigal son was not wrong in asking his father for money Hallelujah that was his right he was a son he had access to the father and what was his own he said give me my portion now I don't want to wait till you're dead just give me no I feel I could be responsible for what you give me he was not ready he was not mature he went a far country deliberately so nobody can monitor or give account to his behavior and actions he spent his money widely and then he find himself in the picture still because you couldn't pay no more rent he broke he tell people now where he's living they see in the big mansion they're seeing the hot they're seeing the farm behind the house so as far as the friends concerned he'll live in a bigger house he just said come on spending these days that time money is done money is finished no more pizza no more KFC no more outside dining they just not seen him he said he's taking a sabbatical you take an arrest that time is they gonna lodging any big style eating pig slop and he was so proud that the padders Kill You The Pride he was so proud he didn't pick food for a while but still maybe blessing it and put some ketchup in it but eat and take food until he came to himself until he came to himself and begin to accept responsibility for the fruit and consequences of his action he said I will arise I will say unto my father I have sinned oh God are coming back are coming back I'm coming back oh give the Lord a shout [Applause] [Music] this is the problem here I know personally many people don't accept their behavior you have no acceptance see you are responsible and the first response who did the devil did it money I remember talking up in New York about the time when I opened my radiator and it blew up and I get burned still have things from it and I was saying I was responsible for that child the devil a whole I mean I didn't want to but the devil hold my hand no no no I know devil in that that is me and folly and I got burned for my fault because I know better than that before you touch that poor water on it before you touch that have a cloth to open that that was foolishness and I was responsible and paid for that see if I come and says I touched that radiator and Lucifer don't know where it came from I got burned pray for me [Music] and Lucifer saying I was not there I did not touch him I did not tell him to do that he did it on his own foreign because he's a liar to begin with because because I am lying if I say that I know better than that and you know better than that too stop lying be honest with yourself accept responsibility for your behavior till the Lord I shout [Applause] and whenever you begin to accept responsibility for your behavior that is the first step for you to be changed [Applause] how you're gonna be change accept you may feel as a wife it's not really a failure you do what you know you may feel as a husband it's not really a failure or a father or our mother maintain the try the best there's no school of motherhood there's no school of fatherhood there's no school of husband and wife there's none you do your best you say the way I understand you didn't say it right and whatnot but if you get the tools you would have done better and you have to forgive yourself but there's another problem people have people can't forgive their own self you have to come to a spot where you could forgive you [Music] because if you can't forgive you the devil will wipe you out because you will always walk under our condemnation but there are no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus will walk not after the flesh but after the spirit [Applause] this morning [Applause] [Music] be honest with your actions when you start to accept responsibility then you can say Lord change me why why why do I say that Jacob his nature was a rip-off thing he's tricking everybody and until he came to the end game because all these have an end you know people don't understand that I don't know when I Was preparing the streets are telling me I said look at that young people they don't know next 40 years from now that tall Spike issues that they were in that I figured they had a balance and play gymnastics with it they went Flats next 40 years perfect Flats because if they don't wear them flash they will fall when they fall they go in hospital and at that age a bones to men that normal so right now they're on stills and because they have youth in the bones they could balance and them Stills that they're working on but all that comes to an end 40 50 years from them still not seeing that so Jacob when he met the angel because afterwards he recognized his fear ESO all this money here all this wealthy have all the land and house and everything he conquer and he feels powerfully family so good already naked boy you're really a good admire you know he report from Mommy Daddy he revolved the whole family he know he's not right and he had to face Esau and he fighting fear grip him he said and then God catch him alone for the first time no cell phone nobody no YouTube no Facebook just Jacob they moping and then God came to him when he hold on to the angel and say who are you I am so bad you know are you in the church last week and I raised my hands I see Our Father prayer you know I never steal anything from The Neighbor Next Door maybe the one you know I'm not gonna talk but Jacob was in that foolishness he was so desperate he said I am Jacob I am no good I need a change of life I want a blessing I want a sprinkling I want some preacher like I believe you preacher no no I want a change of life [Applause] and the angel lay hands upon Jacob and say ah you have it no no no no no it's not it's not working so Jacob Jacobs are the wrestle it's just like going I had to go Jacob said not yet not yet I had to get a blessing before you leave I don't want to get testimony since I meet a angel we didn't just say but the angel told me well you know he's he was Jacob and so on no no he's the one that cannot testimony that doesn't do easy until 10 minutes what about the change walk after a meeting Angel your life changed you know same life angel I didn't know who you come from but when Jacob hold on to that angel he said I will not let you go till you bless me that's when they're getting serious and listen he had to wrestle all night long my body lock the Angel by the foot he slipped out he hold him by the neck he slipped out he got him by his waist he slipped out he either keeps slipping on he doesn't let me go he said no not until you bless me come on say Amen somebody if you want this thing you prepare to wrestle the kingdom of God is preached and every man every man every man rest away into it come on brother sister you better press on into the kingdom of God [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] your faith friends Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] so they have faith in a resurrected living Christ someone who rose from the dead and was even among them just the same as he was before he ever died they wasn't contented for something through a color fear oh god what the history like I know when I go overseas and preach overseas and son is a blessing to those across there but how you listen to that I can explain how Firefall in Africa and the blessings of God here but then you are your problems you can connect with what happened across there you have to connect with what happened right here so I will talk about all them things up there like Superman and you know I am normal man no keep no s ense I supposed to come with a big cape and a big S here Superman you say who is he again so I you know I am not Superman and I know I'm not Superman Superman because Superman have to have star you have to have cape and do a lot of stuff but when you know who Jesus is that he is the Superman and you want him Among Us Then whether I am here or not here you're looking for him [Applause] you understand that whether I am here or not here it doesn't matter God is in the midst of his people oh God I want to free you up oh God you're close enough you're close to it you know just a little more again on your breakthrough continue you see they wasn't contended for some historical Affair but they were contending for the living Christ a resurrected one who was in your midst so what good will you do to tell people where we come from in Cairo and the history of the church and all the trials we went through and how we tries to build this to us and then everybody knew everybody knew to come we have to inform them the whole history they know what the Bible says a parable of men who work in the field some in the morning they say penny Penny Penny Penny and then the last time last holiday they see some fellow Slackers they say no I'm doing nothing they say you want to work one more hour to work Penny you see I'll be going on work they made by the way who was working holiday whole day once accepted penny when come to pay they start with the last answer to pay them penny holy ones looking for penny plus Master the same but you agreed over the same pay Peter had the same pay Paul had we're going to have God they're cheating us I'm saying all again are sent and I'm gonna Penny the same paid game had we have to have [Applause] such as I have I give it unto you rise up and walk in the name of Jesus Christ they have it we have to have it that's what we're talking about [Applause] [Music] what a brand name says you shall see me the church the believer I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world now that was the apostles believe they believed that he was in the flesh he was also more in the spirit that is what they taught that is what they believe that is what they practiced that is what God confirmed he was in the flesh now he is more in the spirit that's what they believe that when your family walk inside of here the very full service don't work inside of here the anointing the presence the power but do something for them that they will know God is dealing with their hearts you don't have to tell a word the spirit speaking to them directly Give the Lord a shout [Applause] I have no doubt your love will be delivered okay right now or the smoking tampi and the smoke in my one and on drugs God will deliver them he's going to prove he is God and your faithfulness and your faith and God is not in vain you have been believed in them [Applause] he said you know I like this that is what they believed that is what they practiced that is what God confirmed but during this time this 33 years of laughs there became many false brethren not few many false Brethren who raised up and brought in heresies and brought people of the Theology and different things like that and all them are the private Revelation because they want to get big up they want to get high up they won't be receiving a certain way so therefore the exercise of their knowledge people say oh I never hear it so I never see it so never see it come so but these disciples the Lord was working with them when they speak God confirmed they don't know no explanation of that the manifestation was the interpretation it had nobody to explain or the government walk well you know the fire went on the mouth and this and that no no no I remember when a man Jesus healed and they say God he will say God was blind no he's here he just is a sinner so two says he's healed you say God heal you Jesus said I don't know but this one thing I know I once was blind but now I see explain that to me [Applause] all this in a talk and Senator and you're off the word and hear the of the word but I was not blind but now I see amen those people see his contrary not because they know Arsenal not because they hear what we're preaching to know because somebody tell them that no full silence no firsthand information they think we off like one man challenge myself listen we have over how much tips on YouTube I say finding one message just one where I preach of the word that's one I said all the messages it's on YouTube item we're not hiding and saying anything until nothing no we've seen it unedited it's right there for anybody to listen to it and see if we preach in the word or we're not preaching the word oh Hallelujah I couldn't say nothing after that oh glory to God all these years that that's why I stayed in the world you know that's why I like to quote the word I am a reader I call to this thing I call it a preach by this I am a reader Hallelujah only reason you know what they're doing here are bringing promises because I have a revelation Peter said by these promises you become partakers I can spend four hours explaining things I'm not here to explain I'm here to bring promises and bring it so clear and real because so many enemy come like a flood the spirit of God would raise a standard by taking the same word and making it more positive for my responsibility to drop the world on you and make it more positive [Applause] go away Glory listen when J when when when when Joshua men was despised was sent to Jericho Rey up tell them them people in that Jacob two million they actually hearing the report of how God working with Israel now the wars don't give any impression I'm trembling because he was the control good by the mighty people a mighty shaken people because is God working with Israel open the Red Sea open Jordan River conquer this one conquer that one they come in for us so rehab said the people shake inside here because they want to know the temperature they want to know what they have to deal with then when they find out the trembling they already conquered already because fear taking them God said my fear before you oh God you're coming with faith and they're getting fear oh God I can see them demons get unfair I can see cancer trembling too much oh God all kind of condition fear God said in fear he said walk in the hospital room and all them sickness they're trembling and shaking because the anointed like a flake flying off of you them devil said an announcement you're coming you're coming you're coming it's not you coming along the fire coming all them demons upon sickness they're seeing the anointing all over you they're shaking they're waiting to get the world to get out or give the Lord a shout you talk about anointed man you talk about anointed Sons you have seen nothing yet they're coming it coming and coming [Music] God God and Hashem of the son of man nor his words what glory to God I preaching the power of God unto salvation oh hallelujah look like foolishness look like a big set of noise you're making noise what I Want You activated I want you excited I want you under expectation I want to have a desire in your heart a grown in your spirit you mustn't be normal like everybody else if every other Church dead you kind of thought to be dead because there will be a church called back to the original Faith the shout of the king will be in Camp he said I checked with Jesus Christ walking on it I am not Jesus he's not talking about me oh give the Lord a shout come on now come on now get the Lord I shout there will be a church with Jesus walking in it the shout of the king will be in the camp yeah amen amen so during the time there became many forced Brethren who raised up and brought in heresies and what people of the Theology and everything he said God help us to have that kind of credential today let us contend for the feet the true feat that was once delivered to the Saints the Saints believed in the debt burial and Resurrection they believe in the baptism of the holy spirit let me pause here a minute the prophet said you can have the baptism 24 hours every day I'm still be lost foreign what is he talking about you can be baptized on your spirit you could be baptized in your flesh or you could be baptized in your soul so that 24 hours being lost is not for the soul [Applause] so teachings are going out to sit in your soul you don't need it baptism of the Holy Ghost because the baptism goes is not the real thing he says because you are son you're going to receive the spirit the spirit not making you a son the spirit is empowering you as a son but Peter didn't bypass the upper room and say I've seen in his soul I don't need the upper room he needed the upper room he needed to be activated he needs the anointing you need this power let me say it again you need it [Applause] you know what this power is this is power to pray power deliver holy life power to overcome power to forgive power to make things right or glory to God power to live power to add the rest of the life foreign [Applause] scriptures as many receive him to them give you power not more letter power the kingdom is not in letter power Oh Glory to God the kingdom is preaching the kingdom of power Oh Glory to God God's kingdom is a kingdom of power and before you have to be subject to the king you have to come into the kingdom because the king is responsible for everybody in the Kingdom Oh Come and preach back to me somebody hallelujah hallelujah the reason is called a kingdom is what is a king and the dumb part is the domain it's the king of our domain and when you belong to the kingdom the king protects you the king provide for you the king of the army to look out for you another season the virus in China England stand for the people when uh to Wuhan like the place in China America take other people that is people of their Kingdom they may come to pick up trinidadians and and green Edens or anybody else they come from Americans any history in any country they say coming from my people waiting God will do he's the king un Satan's kingdom us Satan Eden God send my brother feel like jumping God sent some angels and dropped them down to get his people out of us there's gonna be a Rapture there is going to Millennium there is going to be a wedding supper God sin to take you out of Satan's kingdom Gloria [Applause] Glory Glory glory to God how many Angel Acts or your passport is Believers only believer believer believer believer he's seeing blood all over you [Applause] you have to have the blood of forgiveness God help me [Applause] this fit that is the key to unlock this door this fate is based on forgiveness and Jesus said when you stand praying forgive if you have an ought you drop it [Applause] somebody do you something yeah and sometimes nobody are doing nothing you do yourself but if somebody do you you forgive them God not testing them go testing you [Applause] you hold him back in healing with unforgiveness you holding back your breakthrough with unforgiveness you holding back your deliverance not forgiven [Applause] you have got to forgive I don't care what they did look what they did Jesus he's the father forgive them they know not what they do oh give the Lord a shout faith is peace upon forgiveness [Applause] forgive us of our sins as we forgive those that trespass against us [Applause] [Music] Oh Glory Glory people who call yourself Christians and still hateful still bitter you may be seated one of the worst things together Ness and we're sharing something with my son I said listen there's a way to handle rejection something to get somebody advice and to turn it down and then they'll take somebody else give them advice and they take it and you get offended because you take it personal [Applause] they don't listen to you and look what happened to them and just understand that and you take it personal then you get bitter and angry bitterness squeeze the spirit out that's right don't ever think business can land but do that stay somebody that guess you're mad as hell but don't let stay the birds could mess with your head but don't let them build a mess on your head torch will come but don't let it stay free yourself from that foreign from all men forgive them God bless you so much forgive them God love you so much forgive them glory to God let it go let it go let it go don't know why I'm saying that this morning but Let It Go you've got to let it go some of you inside of here have things in your heart that you have to let go then God's going to bless you give me a season go say your son embarrass you your daughter embarrass you your family embarrass you you can't stand them you can't take them and what they don't say that change your pictures they're not embarrass you gonna love that for a purpose no you want to be free you want to be able to activate Faith by the spirit of forgiveness upon you people will do you think say things lie about you God allow that to see how you gonna deal with that and once you ready for your healing ready for your deliverance ready for the battle of the Holy Ghost you are ready to forgive [Applause] some of you need to forgive yourself foreign what is the truth some you need to forgive yourself let me say it again some of you need to forgive yourself I can't do that for you [Music] Jesus himself said behold I stand the door and knock If any man would open the door of that door is have a knob on the inside he's not going to break down your door you are going to choose to love you are going to choose to forgive it's a choice [Music] I have in my heart to share some things with you I didn't plan to do it today about certain principles and what has kept me over the years and to share some tips if I could call it or whatever it is oh what has helped me over the years I like the power of choice I like the power of decision I see the fruit of decisions with actions and the consequences of that when you choose to love and choose to forgive it it changes everything you're not looking for reward I scratched my back I scratch your back because I want you to scratch my eyes no no we're not talking about that I scratch my your back because your back needs to be scratched I help you because I want to help you I choose to help you so there is no report oh God like I help him I help her I look what she's doing now no you have none of that you do it because you want to you do it because you choose to because when God was helping you he did it because he wanted to he reached you they're stronger self when he reached on his hand for me I was lost and undone without God or his son when he reached on his hand for me Oh Glory to God hallelujah how could you forget that oh could you forget where God brought you from Hallelujah don't you ever forget that and usually when people get blessed to forget God you get a little more money order and more this and more that and they forget God but God wants to raise you so much God wants somebody the more he get blessed is the more humble he becomes it's a tough combination because normally when people get blessed to get puffed up to get oversized they don't care no more when God when they was in tears when they forget when when when when the others was driving them to service when they get the car they do want to pick up somebody they bring them to church but they forget when other people was giving them a ride to service but when they get a card they have the nose up in the air and they're making Style I ain't even knock anybody or me to see it I had showing words for Yami to say it you have to remember where you come from Oh Glory to God he brought me up the man really clear he set my feet upon a rock to stay he put a song in my soul today Oh Glory to God Hallelujah I remember look what a George right here he will never forget that I was in Belmont he had a pump pump gas lamp in those days go to the well and get water and and before we even build this model wooden church was up in a house pumping gas stamp and praying his right updates where I saw my first vision I had a day travel walk into kaiwell I had about three people in service tell me you say why why didn't steal you will leave quite from Belmont around 323 people and I told them I said when you repent Google forgive you and he repented next day because I didn't come to treat people I came to push the word it didn't matter it were three people well from them three people we have a group here now at church here now you see we don't know why God will take us when we broke into broadly kindness 1981 it was a vision it was a prayer meeting and I showed his vision and I saw a sheet dropped down and in words the second comes the Lord and I went to find that message to find out if there was a message preached by Brother Brahman was and then that message you see when the church finds his bloody love when the children and I said church this have to be revealed and God broke the Revelation and then poured his Spirit on top of it [Music] listen carefully God broke the Revelation and put the spirit on top of it changed my life completely and I can't hold a ought against anybody I could bust it to your face I could tell you like it is but there's not one ought behind that I could slam you on the ground and roll on the floor with you but there was not one ought behind that I still love you but I will tell you the truth I wouldn't fool you I wouldn't mind my guy here I will tell you the truth because the truth alone was set you free so I'm not going to set you up if I can't tell the truth I may as well get all the pulpits because if I can't be honest with you I can't be honest with god oh give the Lord some

Sons and Daughters of God your spirit messed up that has nothing to do with that predestinated see that God sit in your soul you may be seated [Music] there's a reason why we never cross the light there's a reason why I never said other person there's a reason why we don't bad talk and blast other ministers and churches and groups it has always been this way it's not no we're living like that we have always lived that one time I didn't want nobody from another messages coming to this church I used to express that and that's why we went on the fees I said prefer go and win sinners to the Lord and I mean I know I said it before and I see it again and one time I was doing some Evangelical walking me out there and afterwards people wasn't coming I said Lord if nobody come next week I'll stop in it and I stopped it I remember kindly asked me about congoose he said we could do that I said totally know that and after six months the Lord spoke to me and let me go back now and we have baptism after baptism after baptism what's the right time you know why I didn't want people on the changes because it's too complex they come from a certain background and they taught a certain way and you have to almost until teach them and say listen don't don't come with your stuff so when Sinners come I could just Jam the word on them and see them transform and so many people on me out they're still here today God bless them it was a god-inspired move so anybody say that people select they are liars sit on top of the tongue and if God kept us kept us we don't press the lighting why

to do this now God is suffering of course he is not willing that any should perish but at all might come to repentance but in order to be God he has to know and he does know before the thing ever come to pass who would be saved and who would not yes sir listen we need every step ladder every stepping stone we need everything the building here we go brother Clarence is still in making and when it is completed this gospel is preached to every King your Toleration then Jesus will return we passed up plenty tracks and theology around the world but the gospel is not the Bible altogether Paul said the gospel came to us not in word only but truth power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost and in order to preach the gospel before you can make the gospel preach you've got to have the power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit to prove the gospel the letter kill it but the spirit make it alive it is not a ritualistic of fear it is absolutely a real living reality of the resurrection of Jesus Christ living among men what is he saying there's power this Glory this gospel could be taken to your home to your house I don't know what Spirits what demon What atmosphere is in your home among your family among your friends and what I don't even know I don't care to know what I know the power will deal with that power of the Gospel will deal with every necromancy obia Spirit demon assignment

your life to free you from all of that all right [Applause] all right I'm going to see you can wrap up here bring back the back to the word now what is this messenger of Malachi fought to do restore back the original fate yet the resurrection Faith what is that fate that the sin Jesus after he was raised from the dead seen him working among them they were men of few words they went forth and preached the word oh my and I come to the last quote and I wrap up this image right here this is the part there is some condemnation by representation and he was praying he said let us pray now you think it's over they can play something something he said uh Lord knowing that I'm a mortal and soon I shall go my days are getting many now soon I'll be 52 years on this Earth and Lord I want to be faithful I want to be true to the end around the world Many Many Nations peoples tongues races seeing many Creeds and seeing them how they mix them up and all their different faces and frustrations when in those places there are many true children many men and women in those places over in that hybrid field there that truly don't want to be there they think they are doing God's will I pray thee father this morning to take away all doubts from my little group here today and from those who will be listening unto the tapes that you will take away all the man-made Creeds as Jesus when he came the first time he found them teaching things that wasn't from the beginning father so it is now at the near coming of Jesus again just like the vine if the vine put forth a branch and that Branch was a Pentecostal Branch filled with the Holy Ghost and signs and wonders of fruits fall in that Branch if that vine ever put forth another Branch it will be the same kind of Branch we know that father by Nature itself but we do know that you can graft any fruit that's pertaining to that into the vine and will live by Divine and we know that we can take orange tree and grow citrus fruits of different kinds seven or eight we can put the lemons on it and it'll grow right in citrus fruit it will grow grapefruit and many others tangerines and so forth but if that tree brings forth its own Branch it will be orange Lord it's been like the first one was here we go and this is where I get the inspiration from for this morning and we believe there is to be a church in these last days that will receive both former and lattering it will be scattered throughout the world in this loud Eastern Church age it will be a church that is called back to the original faith in God it will be a church that have Jesus Christ walking in it manifesting himself and the shout of the king will be in it may the Lord bless you as we want to stand and worship father God I pray in the name of Jesus and to break every ban off the people set them free today and bless them in a powerful way father with baptism after baptism Lord send a Revival among your young people Inspire their souls to press on to the
