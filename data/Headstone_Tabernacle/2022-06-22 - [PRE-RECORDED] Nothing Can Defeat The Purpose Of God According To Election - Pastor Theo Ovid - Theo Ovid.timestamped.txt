[16:54] chapter 9
[16:57] and ephesians chapter 1
[17:00] two portion scriptures this morning
[17:04] we would read ephesians
[17:06] first
[17:08] just verse 3-5
[17:10] and also return to switch to
[17:14] romans 9.
[17:19] first tree of ephesians blessed be the
[17:20] god and father of our lord jesus christ
[17:22] who had blessed us
[17:24] with all
[17:25] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[17:27] in christ in ephesians 1 verse 3.
[17:31] according
[17:32] as he had chosen us in him
[17:35] when
[17:36] before the foundation of the world
[17:39] that we should be holy
[17:41] and without blame
[17:43] before him in love
[17:44] verse
[17:45] having predestinated us unto the
[17:47] adoption of children by jesus christ
[17:51] to himself
[17:53] according
[17:54] to the good pleasure
[17:56] of his will
[17:59] romans chapter 9 want to read from verse
[18:01] 6
[18:03] we read
[18:04] not as though the word of god had not
[18:06] have none effect for thee
[18:08] are not all israel which are of israel
[18:12] neither because they are the seed of
[18:14] abraham
[18:15] are they all children
[18:17] but in isaac shall i see be called
[18:20] that is they which are the children of
[18:23] the flesh these are not the children of
[18:25] god
[18:26] but the children of the promise
[18:30] accounted for the seed
[18:33] for this
[18:34] is the word of promise
[18:36] at this time will i come
[18:38] and say i shall have a son
[18:40] and not only this but when rebecca also
[18:42] had conceived by one even by our father
[18:45] isaac
[18:46] for the children being not yet born
[18:49] neither having done any good or evil
[18:53] that the purpose of god according to
[18:57] election might stand
[18:59] not of works
[19:00] but of him that call it
[19:02] it was said unto her the elder
[19:05] shall save the younger
[19:07] that is written
[19:08] jacob have i loved but esau have i hated
[19:11] let's pray father we thank you for your
[19:13] word and any man could read the word but
[19:16] to take the spirit to come and bring
[19:18] light
[19:18] and life to it father may your word
[19:20] truly be a lamp onto our feet
[19:22] and a light to our parts that we can
[19:25] see where to put our feet this morning
[19:26] our feet of faith
[19:28] further anoint your people anoint those
[19:30] everyone within our gates
[19:32] that they may have ears to hear your
[19:34] word
[19:35] your truth and be transformed by the
[19:38] very word itself
[19:39] come down in our midst and confirm the
[19:41] word with signs and wonders and miracles
[19:44] transform lives homes and families and
[19:47] we'll be careful to give her the
[19:48] underglory we ask in jesus name amen you
[19:51] may be seated
[20:07] well praise the lord
[20:09] blessed be the name of the lord i have a
[20:11] title this morning
[20:13] nothing can defeat
[20:15] the purpose of god
[20:16] according to election
[20:18] amen that's my title this morning
[20:20] nothing can defeat the purpose of god
[20:24] according to election
[20:25] i have a subject fate
[20:27] in the finished work
[20:29] and i have an inspiration from
[20:31] ecclesiastes chapter 3 1 to everything
[20:33] is a season and a time to every purpose
[20:35] under the heaven so i took all
[20:37] inspiration from there there is a season
[20:39] and a time
[20:41] to every purpose
[20:42] there's a season and time
[20:44] to every purpose nothing can defeat the
[20:47] purpose of god
[20:49] is not right
[20:50] the bible tells us that the children not
[20:53] yet born neither haven't done any good
[20:55] or evil that the purpose of god
[20:57] according to election might stand not of
[21:00] works but of him
[21:03] that call it
[21:05] verse 18 therefore you have mercy on
[21:08] whom he will have mercy and whom he
[21:09] hardened he will harden it isn't that
[21:11] right verse 17 for the scriptures here
[21:13] unto pharaoh even for this same purpose
[21:16] have i raised the up that i might show
[21:17] my power indeed that my name might be
[21:20] declared throughout all the earth
[21:23] oh hallelujah raised up for a purpose
[21:27] hallelujah praise god do you believe
[21:30] that
[21:30] matthew 24 21 and then there shall be
[21:33] great tribulation and such was not since
[21:35] the beginning of the world to this time
[21:37] no ever shall be and accept those days
[21:39] shall be shortened there shall be no
[21:41] flesh be saved but for the elect's sake
[21:46] those days shall be shortened
[21:48] so there is an elect on the earth
[21:51] in case you didn't know
[21:53] you're gonna know this morning there's
[21:55] an elect on the earth
[21:57] she is chosen in him
[21:59] not now
[22:00] since before the foundation of the world
[22:02] and all that well on the earth going to
[22:05] worship the beast except
[22:07] those whose names are written in the
[22:10] lamb's book of life before the
[22:12] foundation of the world so they got the
[22:14] common unfolding of the book to reveal
[22:16] to you that your name is on that book
[22:20] and when you see your name you cannot be
[22:22] the same
[22:24] when you know you are one in a million
[22:26] when you know millions were lost when
[22:28] you were called and you were called for
[22:31] his honor and his glory what he purposed
[22:34] in himself not what you choose but he
[22:37] chose you
[22:38] in himself and predestinated
[22:41] or predetermined that you'll be adopted
[22:44] not of your works not of your past not
[22:47] of your sins not of your failures but
[22:50] that election might stand
[22:52] and when god elect the people before the
[22:55] foundation of the world there is no
[22:57] devil could defeat the purpose that god
[23:00] raised you up for you are being raised
[23:03] up for a divine purpose and i want to
[23:05] tell you this morning nothing will stop
[23:08] it not your past not your sins not your
[23:12] failures not your problems not your
[23:15] condition not what family come from

[23:20] the purpose of god

[24:46] our age that came down
[24:48] mighty angel brought back the full
[24:51] revealed word now we have tossed it at
[24:54] the lord for age and we are walking in a
[24:58] john saw vision
[25:00] but we are seeing the reality of the
[25:02] vision that john saw john could only say
[25:05] i saw and i looked and i saw and i
[25:09] looked and i saw and i looked but you
[25:12] are living in what john saw
[25:15] he saw a people for glory to god a
[25:18] multitude out of many tongues and
[25:21] nations saying worthy is the lamb that
[25:23] took the book and lose the seven shields
[25:27] that is what john saw he saw you rejoice
[25:30] him he saw you shouting he saw you
[25:33] getting a revelation of who you are and
[25:36] who your father is and where you come
[25:38] from and where you're going the one that
[25:41] john said all in heaven all under the
[25:44] earth that i praise god
[25:47] oh
[25:48] hallelujah
[25:51] oh
[25:52] hallelujah
[25:54] hallelujah
[25:56] you have something to praise god about
[26:04] let me see
[26:04] [Applause]
[26:06] yes
[26:07] your problems
[26:09] yes yes they are trans
[26:12] and they never want to put a dark cloud
[26:13] over you because of your situation your
[26:15] children your wife family whatever you
[26:17] can't worship you can't praise god you
[26:19] can't worship
[26:21] one time disciples came back
[26:23] victory over devils
[26:24] victory from cast no devils and they
[26:26] came back happened rejoicing and jesus
[26:28] told them don't rejoice but
[26:31] don't rejoice for that hear what to
[26:33] rejoice about rejoice because your name
[26:36] is written
[26:37] rejoice because your name
[26:38] [Applause]
[26:48] you see that word name goes deep
[26:51] that name is personal identification
[26:54] of who you are if there's a john jones
[26:56] in here i said could john jones stand up
[26:58] everybody cannot stand up
[27:01] only john john could stand up so when he
[27:03] said name you mean individual
[27:06] when he's a name he's talking about
[27:08] thought attribute
[27:11] in other words nobody could be your
[27:13] thought
[27:15] therefore nobody could be your word
[27:18] and the word is a thought express so god
[27:20] was thinking about you in the back part
[27:23] of his mind before the foundation of the
[27:25] world and when he spoke the word he
[27:27] expressed you
[27:29] in the word
[27:33] so when you come to church they come to
[27:35] hear about your expression because you
[27:37] come to hear the word of what not what
[27:39] you are but what you are going to become
[27:42] because that is what the devil is afraid
[27:44] of the devil is not afraid of what you
[27:46] are the devil's afraid of what you are
[27:48] about to become
[27:55] you will be seated
[27:56] because the whole creation is groaning
[27:59] and travailing
[28:01] for the manifestation
[28:03] of the sons of god
[28:04] because the creation once had a ruler
[28:07] his name was adam the creation once had
[28:09] a god on the earth adam was a god on the
[28:11] earth ruled by a master the creation was
[28:15] but when man fell creation just let go
[28:18] but creation is waiting for the masters
[28:20] of the earth to step forward once again
[28:23] because god in the beginning
[28:26] let us make man
[28:27] all in our image
[28:29] after our likeness and let that man have
[28:32] dominion
[28:33] oh glory to god could we give the lord
[28:36] some praises
[28:38] that's the kind of man that god made
[28:40] a man in authority
[28:42] a man in position a man with power
[28:45] a man having dominion over
[28:47] that's the kind of man that god made
[28:50] [Music]
[28:50] [Applause]
[28:56] hallelujah
[28:58] my lord
[29:00] what does that thought express
[29:02] and when god once thought
[29:04] of how we make the plan of redemption
[29:06] how do we redeem man by foreknowledge
[29:09] knowing that someone desired
[29:11] and some would be redeemed
[29:12] he thought of the plan
[29:14] when he spoke the word listen it was
[29:17] already a finished work in heaven
[29:20] when god spoke it
[29:23] [Applause]
[29:24] your deliverance finish
[29:26] your victory finish
[29:28] your healing finish
[29:30] that's why i said by your stripe i was
[29:32] healed
[29:33] not will be was healed because it's
[29:35] already done
[29:40] hallelujah
[29:42] are you with me
[29:44] lord fine among christian american
[29:46] christians he said now it's a fear it
[29:49] seems to be afraid that god won't keep
[29:50] his word it's nothing that you can do in
[29:53] the beginning
[29:54] it's what god has done
[29:56] you never sought god though you thought
[29:58] you did but the bible claims you didn't
[30:01] no man seeks god this nature from the
[30:04] garden of eden proves he's a coward and
[30:06] runs when he sins
[30:08] it wasn't adam calling god it was god
[30:11] calling adam and the bible says that
[30:13] your name was written on the book of
[30:15] life
[30:16] isn't that right before the foundation
[30:18] of the world the bible said that the the
[30:22] devil deceive all that dwell on the
[30:24] earth except those whose names are not
[30:26] written deceive the popes the presidents
[30:28] the kings the potentials deceive the
[30:30] professors and the colleges these
[30:32] teachers lawyers doctors deceive all
[30:35] so if your name is in the book you could
[30:37] be
[30:38] mad i'm scraggly
[30:41] you could be madame same clothes every
[30:43] sunday same clothes every day washing
[30:45] the same clothes your name on that book
[30:47] you better shout
[30:49] you better rejoice
[30:51] you could have no money in your pocket
[30:53] that has nothing to do
[30:54] [Applause]
[30:59] oh hallelujah
[31:01] everything i've gone
[31:02] is a finished work
[31:04] healing
[31:05] salvation it's done finish
[31:08] the only thing is our personal fate
[31:11] in that finished work
[31:13] it's our personal fate and we draw we we
[31:16] draw the renumerations we draw the
[31:19] reward we draw the compensation of his
[31:22] death at calvary for his personal faith
[31:24] what he died for
[31:26] isn't that right
[31:27] and every redemptive blessing belonged
[31:29] to you and i
[31:30] the only thing is the appropriate faith
[31:32] to receive it
[31:33] it's not he was wounded for our
[31:35] transgression he was bruce our iniquity
[31:37] let's just type in our pieces upon him
[31:39] and with his stripe we were healed
[31:42] it's all past tense it's a finished work
[31:45] it is something we just looked at
[31:47] calvary where the supreme sacrifice was
[31:50] made therefore oh hallelujah we have
[31:53] faith in this finished work nothing that
[31:55] i could do nothing that someone else can
[31:57] do it's what god has done and we believe
[32:01] he has done therefore we take from the
[32:03] word and base up our faith upon our
[32:05] finished work
[32:06] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[32:09] that's why i go on record and say the
[32:11] right mental attitude towards any divine
[32:13] promises of god will bring it to pass i
[32:16] don't care what it is if you have the
[32:17] right attitude which is to believe it
[32:20] that's just all you've got to do
[32:22] believe as doubt is
[32:24] go glory to god
[32:28] excuse me
[32:28] [Music]

[32:50] until you have something to forgive
[32:52] and somebody have rocks look at the belt

[33:54] one by one the easing out some remember
[33:56] their ability to pay some remember the
[33:58] light might get cut some remember they
[33:59] have this to do and that to do enough
[34:01] dysfunction to go to and jesus wait
[34:03] until everybody left
[34:06] [Applause]
[34:07] he didn't want to embarrass them you got
[34:08] to tell them about all their life who
[34:10] they was with where they stole what they
[34:12] did he gotta tell every one of them
[34:14] hypocrites standing there with big stone
[34:16] to stone a woman

[34:22] and jesus turned to the woman he said
[34:23] woman cause uh our case is called
[34:27] caught in session woman come forward
[34:31] where then accusers
[34:33] woman didn't send see when they left

[34:37] nothing
[34:37] he said this case can't continue
[34:40] we must have witnesses we must have
[34:42] evidence we must have accusers they have
[34:44] no accusers neither do i condemn thee go
[34:48] and sing
[34:50] no more
[34:52] and who the son of man come on now set
[34:54] free
[34:56] is free
[34:58] indeed
[34:59] give the lord a shout if you are free
[35:02] this morning
[35:04] give the lord a shout
[35:06] who the son of man
[35:08] set free
[35:10] is free indeed
[35:13] oh
[35:14] hallelujah
[35:18] hallelujah
[35:20] praise god say if you have a well in one
[35:22] hill i give a crap burning an exhale you
[35:25] could stand in boil water water come
[35:27] over here
[35:28] water water come over here
[35:30] the water will not listen to you you
[35:32] have to work with the law of gravitation
[35:34] and the law of gravitation can't fail so
[35:36] you have to work in the law to get the
[35:38] water to your burning crops isn't that
[35:40] right
[35:41] therefore therefore if you can't just
[35:43] say he left easy light up the room light
[35:45] of the room you've got to work according
[35:47] to the laws of election city then it
[35:49] will light up to the room isn't that
[35:50] right well therefore just that way god
[35:53] doesn't heal people by going to church
[35:56] or making the confession he heals you on
[35:58] your faith in his finished work
[36:02] that is the condition in which he's
[36:03] healed you not because you're in the
[36:05] church you could raise up this morning
[36:07] walk on a hole
[36:10] heal
[36:11] in your body
[36:13] in your spirit
[36:15] and in your soul
[36:17] some people not only sick in the body
[36:19] the second spirit
[36:21] that's why i like the world would you be
[36:23] made whole
[36:26] i love that will you be made whole
[36:29] it means wholesome
[36:31] right thinking coming into divine order
[36:35] will you remain whole
[36:37] they want to walk up here out there
[36:39] thinking right
[36:40] walking right feeling right
[36:43] not feeling miserable not feeling like
[36:46] you have crack on your mental but being
[36:49] made whole
[36:51] oh glory to god hallelujah
[36:55] oh get the lord some precious people
[36:57] [Applause]
[36:59] oh hallelujah
[37:01] glory to god
[37:03] no watch
[37:04] no man can come to me except my father
[37:06] draw him
[37:07] all that the father hat
[37:10] past tense
[37:11] given me
[37:12] will come
[37:14] that's a guarantee
[37:15] all of the father had
[37:17] given me
[37:18] will come
[37:19] so you understand what jesus did he
[37:21] walked on the other one peter come
[37:23] andrew will come
[37:25] because they were given to him
[37:27] so he wasn't making any mistake he
[37:29] wasn't casting a fishnet and hoping they
[37:31] come he said come follow me and
[37:33] something and then register
[37:35] the attribute inside of them connected
[37:37] to the word
[37:39] the attribute inside of them connected
[37:41] to the living word jesus had the names
[37:44] he was the book itself
[37:47] so when he began to call their names
[37:49] they have to respond
[37:51] therefore if you hear your name
[37:53] this morning
[37:55] you've got to respond you cannot hear
[37:57] your name
[37:58] and there is no response
[38:00] come on same as somebody because that
[38:03] deep deep calling
[38:05] there's got to be a deep
[38:07] to respond
[38:08] to that call
[38:10] oh hallelujah
[38:12] you understand now
[38:14] why jesus could say no man can come to
[38:18] me
[38:19] except
[38:20] the father draw him
[38:22] therefore you can come if you want to
[38:25] it's not him that will it or him that
[38:27] run it but a god that showed mercy
[38:31] that's why i'm shouting tonight
[38:34] because i know
[38:35] the grace of god has been so good
[38:39] to you and i
[38:40] what else can we do
[38:43] what manner of love is this
[38:45] that we can be called
[38:47] the sons of god
[38:49] wretched sinners
[38:51] and no
[38:52] and now
[38:53] it does not appear what we shall be but
[38:56] we know when we see him we shall be like
[39:00] him
[39:01] we shall be changed
[39:04] oh
[39:05] hallelujah
[39:07] oh are you with me
[39:09] oh blessed be the lord
[39:11] so watch how can you come to god
[39:14] without god calling you first
[39:16] all he forned you
[39:19] all
[39:21] all
[39:22] he forned you
[39:23] he called
[39:24] all
[39:25] he called he justify and to justify as i
[39:30] said as if you never did it all
[39:33] people on you oh let's say this way all
[39:36] he knew before
[39:39] did you hear what i said
[39:41] all
[39:42] he knew before
[39:43] he called all
[39:45] he called he justified all he justified
[39:50] he had
[39:52] it's finished
[39:56] oh
[40:00] hallelujah
[40:01] so watch this
[40:03] even though the lamb
[40:04] had to be slain on earth
[40:06] it was slain and god's thinking
[40:08] because everything under heaven
[40:11] have a season
[40:12] and a time
[40:14] to every purpose so even though it is
[40:17] finished it have a season and time to
[40:20] come into its fulfillment
[40:22] or come to its fruition so when you're
[40:25] looking for your season
[40:27] when your season comes
[40:30] your season comes
[40:33] that's why jesus keeps saying my always
[40:35] not yet
[40:39] you may be seasoned
[40:40] they want to stone him they want to do
[40:42] this he will say my always that she had
[40:43] come all of a sudden he changed he said
[40:45] my always come
[40:47] but the son of man be glorified but
[40:49] before that nothing could tap him
[40:52] nothing to defeat him nothing could trap
[40:53] him because you know he have all in time
[40:56] to do a certain work
[40:57] and god predestinated you here we go for
[41:00] certain work
[41:01] no kind of bonk you don't no building
[41:04] falling in your head
[41:06] this happening and don't forget about it
[41:09] nothing can defeat
[41:14] the purpose of god
[41:27] look at samson what's the purpose
[41:30] to destroy the philistines that's the
[41:31] purpose god's gained some introductory
[41:34] behaviors

[41:39] everybody afraid samson samson's a big
[41:40] champion when they say samson get

[42:45] when you hear that name god samson
[42:47] that man what the fear of god to the
[42:49] philistines
[42:51] hallelujah because they know god was
[42:53] with samsa
[42:54] well those philistines don't just sit
[42:56] down and say well we're taking that
[42:57] blues they start the plot and plan they
[42:59] loosely lie at him but god had a bigger
[43:01] plan than that
[43:02] [Music]
[43:04] you're not here in me
[43:06] delilah william wheel his way into his
[43:08] life until she caught him
[43:11] and samson appeared
[43:13] to be fully comprehensively
[43:15] defeated
[43:18] stumps bold
[43:20] something grinding at the mill
[43:22] man with our eyes
[43:24] weak as normal man see samson didn't
[43:26] know outside the anointing normal man
[43:29] a christian is not a normal man
[43:32] we are different
[43:36] no man we smoke and drink one woman we
[43:38] are different we call it a higher order
[43:42] don't bring that in here we are
[43:43] different
[43:44] come on same as somebody
[43:49] see the power the glory you will be
[43:50] seated was not samson's own was a higher
[43:54] order
[43:55] i was upon samsung
[43:58] samson grime
[43:59] but the philistines went too far
[44:01] they wanted entertainment
[44:03] they wanted to make fun god don't
[44:05] respect that
[44:06] they wanted to make fun of god's servant
[44:07] that was broken that was defeated that
[44:10] was battered literally they realized the
[44:12] hair was growing back
[44:13] the same hair that was cut the same
[44:15] virtues that were shaved off the same
[44:17] thunders that was roaring all along
[44:19] shaking the devil left and right and
[44:20] center now it was restored back and they
[44:23] brought samson blind boy a little boy
[44:25] leading him to the pillar he said leave
[44:26] me to the pillars where the whole
[44:28] building is at
[44:29] i like that samson have an understanding
[44:31] you can't call for fire and there's no
[44:33] you're not in position
[44:34] what if i were to burn you up
[44:37] he would just follow you with that
[44:38] shut up at the top of the can you
[44:40] go along
[44:41] samson didn't want that kind of thing
[44:43] sometimes they put me by the post
[44:45] because when there's power coming got to
[44:47] do something
[44:48] so you got to be interested
[44:50] in being positionally placed
[44:54] i'm not hearing you
[44:56] because power coming
[44:58] fire coming
[45:00] revival it's coming
[45:02] oh yes
[45:03] but you want to be in position
[45:06] [Applause]
[45:09] samson parade
[45:11] philistines looking for entertainment
[45:12] literally the secret is succulent eyes
[45:15] tears running down
[45:17] he said lord avenge me of my
[45:19] adversaries
[45:20] notice his prayer he will say lord
[45:23] i'm a sinner i deserve it
[45:27] if something was praying that kind of
[45:28] prayer
[45:29] number one is sure he had no revelation
[45:31] number two he was going to remain a
[45:33] sinner
[45:34] because no faith was going to
[45:35] appropriate any power coming down
[45:38] and he was going to stay there and he
[45:39] and philistine have a good laugh but
[45:41] samson wasn't connected to that
[45:42] samson reached back before he fell
[45:45] before delilah before there was a moon
[45:47] before there was a star before there was
[45:50] a molecule samson reached back before
[45:52] the foundational world where he was a
[45:54] son where he was a seed when he was a
[45:57] thought when he had his name written
[46:00] samson said avenge me
[46:02] your son
[46:03] of taking my eyes
[46:05] once more
[46:08] that the son
[46:09] talking to father
[46:13] i'm not hearing you
[46:15] i'm not hearing you
[46:17] that is not somebody outside that
[46:19] there's somebody inside somebody
[46:21] belonging to the kingdom that's a
[46:23] kingdom son saying father
[46:26] you give me eyes these rascals had no
[46:29] right
[46:30] [Applause]
[46:34] samson was elected
[46:36] whoa
[46:37] samson was obtained for a purpose
[46:40] once more lord and the power struck him
[46:44] and the billy began to shake and samson
[46:46] kill more philistines in his death than
[46:49] he did in his life his purpose was
[46:52] accomplished
[46:53] give the lord a shout nothing couldn't
[46:57] defeat
[46:59] let the haters hate on
[47:03] that can't stop it
[47:05] let the jealous people jealous on that
[47:08] still can't stop it
[47:10] nothing going to stop it
[47:12] we are going to revival
[47:15] our seven thunder revival
[47:18] nothing on us right here we gonna have a
[47:20] revival
[47:26] oh

[47:39] would make a revival and that is what
[47:42] we're going to do in trinidad we're
[47:43] going to make a church there's going to
[47:45] be a short great message that could just
[47:47] shake the whole nation there is going to

[47:53] i believe that
[47:55] i'm claiming ahead i'm walking in it i'm
[47:58] expecting it
[48:00] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[48:04] oh glory to god so here we go again
[48:07] although he phoned you
[48:09] he caught
[48:11] so the bible said
[48:12] he needs partial samaria
[48:14] why you have a woman he want to meet
[48:17] he sent the disciples to get bread and
[48:19] eat whatever it is he says i am meat you
[48:21] know not of
[48:23] my meat is the will of him that sent me
[48:25] and to finish the work so he needs
[48:27] pressure samaria you have to journey a
[48:29] different direction to get to samaria he
[48:32] sits at the well he is the book he have
[48:35] the names all that the father
[48:38] had given me
[48:40] will come
[48:41] this woman had five men the one she
[48:44] living with wasn't hers but all
[48:47] that the father
[48:48] had given me
[48:49] will come
[48:50] her name was on the book but she didn't
[48:53] know it all
[48:54] but the father
[48:56] had given me
[48:57] will come
[48:58] she was practicing she was in horrible
[49:00] condition nobody fell asleep with her
[49:03] nobody giving us something to eat nobody
[49:05] encouraging her because there's no
[49:07] service at that kind of woman but jesus
[49:11] sat at the well because all that the
[49:13] father had given me
[49:15] will come he knew what time she was
[49:18] coming so he was on time
[49:21] i'm not hearing you this morning and god
[49:24] knows that you will be here this morning
[49:26] you are on time
[49:28] god is on time all that the father had
[49:32] given me
[49:33] will come
[49:38] oh glory
[49:40] glory
[49:42] glory
[49:43] hallelujah
[49:45] what sin
[49:47] tell me what's in
[49:49] what sin you could talk about what sin
[49:51] you could bring that god can't handle
[49:54] and god can't deal with i have news for
[49:56] you it has already been deadweight
[49:59] [Applause]
[50:02] that's what calvary is all about
[50:05] my you may be seated
[50:07] you justified he has already glorified
[50:10] you you're living under a privilege
[50:12] i want to read a private interview
[50:15] about a brand higher with a woman
[50:17] that i refer to
[50:20] a masterpiece
[50:22] the following is a personal interview by
[50:23] the brandon high with her sister georgia
[50:25] bruce doing the song service preceding
[50:27] the message
[50:28] the masterpiece
[50:30] he's speaking to the woman it's his
[50:32] sister
[50:33] i visited the hospital at that time and
[50:35] i prayed constantly god wouldn't let you
[50:36] die she was sick because you are valued
[50:38] to the church now i know you
[50:41] i know you're going to be all right
[50:42] sister bruce i believe in all my heart
[50:45] this is just a bruce response
[50:47] but a branham most of all
[50:49] i want the experience
[50:50] that i've been sealed in the holy ghost
[50:53] and if god revealed it to your heart
[50:56] and by the brain i'm speaking i believe
[50:57] in all my heart
[50:59] that you are a real born-again believer
[51:01] sister bruce how could that spirit just
[51:03] leave when you get sick you get wary you
[51:07] a nervous type person sister bruce said
[51:09] yes and you get things on your mind see
[51:11] little bitty things if that keeps
[51:13] building up both ways and you get
[51:15] somebody on your heart you want to pray
[51:16] for them get up and pray for it you
[51:18] can't rest until you get that person
[51:19] prayed for
[51:20] that's you then you take on the other
[51:22] side satan might present something to
[51:24] you out of this way then it's your
[51:26] nature and god works and satan works
[51:30] then when satan tries to make you
[51:31] believe that you're not you keep
[51:33] building this and building this don't
[51:35] look at yourself sister bruce
[51:37] remember i'm fixing to pray for you i'm
[51:40] not worthy of that what would i do if
[51:42] jesus christ was sitting here now what
[51:44] would he do if he was sitting here he
[51:46] would lay his hands upon you with his
[51:47] great faith see and you'll get well but
[51:49] i think i'm a sinner i am not him i come
[51:52] to represent him but remember me
[51:55] being a sinner and before god
[51:58] i am not a sinner
[52:00] and neither are you
[52:04] [Music]
[52:06] could i read that part again
[52:09] you think i'm a sinner i'm on him but i
[52:11] come to represent him but remember me
[52:14] being a sinner and before god i am not a
[52:17] sinner neither are you
[52:18] we have got a blood sacrifice laying
[52:21] there
[52:22] god don't even see us
[52:26] he hears our voice
[52:28] but he sees the blood of christ
[52:31] that's it he sees the blood of his own
[52:34] son
[52:35] it's our voice but it's christ's blood
[52:38] then it is christ that is talking to us
[52:41] to god so therefore we are not sinners
[52:43] no more
[52:44] we are christians
[52:46] and i believe you to be a genuine
[52:48] christian woman
[52:53] sister bruce says
[52:55] i have made so many mistakes
[52:58] and i feel so many times but abraham
[53:01] that's why christ had to die
[53:03] so you with your mistakes it wouldn't be
[53:06] lutter to you
[53:07] he took your mistakes your desire in
[53:10] your heart is to save him since the
[53:12] bruce says yes that's what he died for
[53:14] so you could serve him your mistakes are
[53:17] not looked
[53:19] it is not allotted to you
[53:21] he is your appropriation
[53:23] he is your sin offering you are not a
[53:26] sinner before god
[53:28] christ took your sins and became you
[53:32] because your desire is to serve him
[53:36] sister bruce says but i've never had an
[53:38] experience that have been filled with
[53:40] the holy ghost that i could put my foot
[53:42] on
[53:42] all right notice this ordinarily a human
[53:45] being is born in sin shape of inequity
[53:48] comes to the word speaking lies that's
[53:49] the nature of a human being since the
[53:51] bruce said yes that was your nature it's
[53:54] changed once uh but it what changed it
[53:56] she said christ there you are sister
[53:58] that's it he that heard my words and
[54:00] believing him that sent me out eternal
[54:02] life shall not come to judgment but pass
[54:04] from death unto life you are christian
[54:06] sister bruce here we go are you ready
[54:09] i have watched your life
[54:11] i have watched you on the vision
[54:14] and i know you're a christian
[54:20] now she said she makes so much of
[54:21] failures and so much mistake and he's
[54:23] here on the vision
[54:25] and he wasn't seeing the failures and
[54:27] the missing he said i know you're a
[54:28] christian i have seen your life i've
[54:31] seen it on the vision praise god watch
[54:34] there's not a spec i am your shepherd as
[54:36] it was she said yes somebody to help you
[54:39] if there was any doubt in my mind if i
[54:41] thought there was something wrong i will
[54:43] tell you sister bruce and if there was
[54:45] anything wrong in your experience
[54:46] anything wrong between you and god as
[54:48] far as i know nothing about there is not
[54:50] a thing
[54:52] oh give the lord some praises
[54:54] oh
[54:56] hallelujah
[54:57] so i wonder what god's seeing this
[54:58] morning
[54:59] and what you seeing this morning
[55:02] your failures your short comments your
[55:03] mistakes and whatnot but under vision
[55:07] oh glory to god you are son and daughter
[55:09] of the living god give the lord a shell
[55:16] well praise the lord
[55:19] so therefore god has tied for the end in
[55:20] mind
[55:26] the seed
[55:28] that's going to be planted
[55:29] has to be ripe and mature
[55:31] you don't plant a green corn seed so the
[55:34] seed is figurative and representative of
[55:37] the end product
[55:39] a dry
[55:40] grain a corn it's mature it's ripe but
[55:43] that is what is going to be buried
[55:46] to reproduce more of the same kind
[55:48] isn't that right
[55:50] hallelujah so you start with the end in
[55:52] mind
[55:53] you start with the mature seed
[55:55] that is the seed that can be sown and
[55:58] through the process of plant life you
[55:59] get the fruit at the end
[56:01] ecliesis 3 15 says that which had been
[56:05] is now
[56:07] and that which is to be had already
[56:08] been.
[56:10] that's like a parable and god required
[56:12] that which is passed
[56:14] that's a big scripture
[56:16] there is no light scripture that's a big
[56:18] one i really can't that which had been
[56:20] is known yeah that is the bee has
[56:22] already been
[56:23] and god require
[56:25] that which is passed
[56:27] you start with the seed
[56:29] and the seed is the word
[56:31] jesus said the parable is the seed is
[56:34] the word the word is a seed
[56:36] for a villain of god notice all the
[56:38] glory that was in god is in the word
[56:44] in the beginning was the word it wasn't
[56:45] with god and the word was god so all the
[56:48] glory is where
[56:50] in the word isn't that right
[56:52] so praise god so he emptied himself
[56:56] poured himself into christ and christ
[56:58] are being behind the veil
[57:00] therefore the christian life here we go
[57:04] is a daily struggle between our two
[57:06] natures
[57:09] the law of the flesh
[57:11] and the law of the spirit
[57:13] and paul identified the law of the flesh
[57:15] in romans 7.
[57:17] from verse 14 he said we know that the
[57:19] lord is spiritual
[57:20] but i am kind of sold on the sin verse
[57:22] 15 for that which i do i alone not and
[57:24] what i would that i i do i not
[57:27] what i hate that i do
[57:29] for if then i do
[57:31] that which i would not
[57:33] and consent unto the lord that is good
[57:36] then it is no more i that do it
[57:38] but sin
[57:39] that dwelleth in me
[57:41] for i know that in me that is in my
[57:43] flesh
[57:44] dwell at no good thing
[57:46] for to will is present with me but how
[57:49] to perform that which is good i find not
[57:52] for the good that i would i do not but
[57:54] the evil which i would not that i do
[57:57] now if i do that that i would not it is
[58:00] no more i that do it
[58:01] but sin that dwelleth in me
[58:04] i find them a law
[58:06] that when i would do good evil is
[58:08] present with me
[58:09] and i delight in the law of god after
[58:12] the inward man
[58:13] but i see another law
[58:15] in my members
[58:17] warren against the law of my mind
[58:19] and bringing me into captivity to the
[58:22] law of sin which is in my members all
[58:25] wretched man that i am
[58:27] who shall deliver me from the body of
[58:29] this debt
[58:31] but i thank god through jesus christ all
[58:34] or
[58:35] then with the mind i myself served the
[58:37] law of god but with the flesh
[58:40] the law of sin
[58:42] oh could we give the lord some praises
[58:45] that's just the scriptures
[58:47] but the scripture is anointed
[58:49] the script is inspired
[58:51] it's been inspired to you
[58:53] that's the law of sin
[58:55] in your nature you may be seated
[58:58] then romans chapter 8
[58:59] the law of the spirit
[59:01] it won there is therefore no no
[59:03] condemnation
[59:04] to them who are in christ jesus who walk
[59:07] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[59:10] for the law of the spirit in christ
[59:13] jesus had made me free from the law of
[59:16] sin and death oh could we give the lord
[59:18] a praise offered
[59:20] oh
[59:21] hallelujah hallelujah
[59:23] glory
[59:25] hallelujah
[59:26] genesis 1 26 and god said
[59:30] let us make man in our image
[59:33] in all likeness john 4 god is a spirit
[59:37] did not worship him must worship him in
[59:39] spirit and in truth so god image and
[59:42] likeness is spirit so the first man god
[59:45] made genesis 1 was a spirit man
[59:48] that was the man that had dominion that
[59:50] was the man that had power that was the
[59:53] man like a spirit being isn't that right
[59:56] brother branham said with a spirit man
[59:59] the order of god
[1:00:00] isn't that right
[1:00:02] and he said now the first man he give
[1:00:04] man
[1:00:05] to lead the animal life
[1:00:07] like the holy spirit leads the believer
[1:00:09] today
[1:00:11] and if we were in perfect submission to
[1:00:12] the holy spirit god lead us by the holy
[1:00:15] spirit
[1:00:16] now watch
[1:00:17] then there was no man to till the soil
[1:00:20] man
[1:00:21] physical man so genesis one man was
[1:00:24] spirit man genesis two men there was no
[1:00:27] man to tell the soil no physical being
[1:00:31] so then he fought man out of the dust of
[1:00:33] the earth and put the spirit man into
[1:00:36] this dust man the bible said man become
[1:00:39] a living soul
[1:00:41] a living soul
[1:00:44] a living soul so this image you see
[1:00:47] today is the image of animal life
[1:00:50] this is not the image of the son of god
[1:00:52] what you see the physical is animal life
[1:00:55] the image of man image of dust is not
[1:00:57] the image of god god made two men
[1:01:00] spirit man and dust man and put the
[1:01:02] spirit man in the dust man and man
[1:01:04] become a living soul and that's the man
[1:01:07] that you see
[1:01:08] around you here this morning isn't that
[1:01:11] right
[1:01:12] so man
[1:01:13] made him out of the dust of the earth
[1:01:15] not his own image
[1:01:16] he already made the man but then he
[1:01:19] breathed into him the breath of life and
[1:01:21] he became a living soul so the soul
[1:01:25] of man
[1:01:26] is the nature of the spirit
[1:01:30] the soul
[1:01:31] of man
[1:01:33] is the nature of the spirit
[1:01:36] so when you are reborn
[1:01:38] you don't get a new spirit you get a new
[1:01:40] nature of that spirit
[1:01:43] it's the same spirit but a new nature of
[1:01:45] it you take two men stand them together
[1:01:48] both look alike one of them is a sinner
[1:01:50] one of them in a christian one man said
[1:01:52] i got a spirit the same as you have see
[1:01:54] but one is different his soul
[1:01:57] his nature is different
[1:01:59] he's been changed
[1:02:00] so then he breathe into this man
[1:02:03] and watch he put him in five senses so
[1:02:05] he could contact his earthly home see
[1:02:08] smell feel here he made him that way now
[1:02:12] those senses was not to contact god
[1:02:19] you like good food yeah i like good food
[1:02:21] too
[1:02:22] have taste to do that with
[1:02:24] right but that's not how to contact god
[1:02:26] that's for you to communicate here on
[1:02:28] the earth seafields meal and touch and
[1:02:29] so on that's what those senses are for
[1:02:31] isn't that right god have a bigger sense
[1:02:33] for you to contact him with that's a
[1:02:35] sense of faith it's a substance what you
[1:02:37] can touch and feel and taste and smell
[1:02:40] and hear it's a supernatural substance
[1:02:42] that god put inside of you as a
[1:02:44] cornerstone inside your heart inside
[1:02:47] your soul
[1:02:48] a substance called faith and you can't
[1:02:50] even explain it it's supernatural you
[1:02:52] can't show anybody you just live it you
[1:02:54] just demonstrate it you just manifest it
[1:02:56] you just believe the word you don't even
[1:02:57] know how you just say amen to the word
[1:03:00] because that faith inside of you is
[1:03:01] agreeing with the word be unspoken isn't
[1:03:04] that right hallelujah isn't that right
[1:03:06] so he said i have a picture of adam
[1:03:08] he was dead as he could be his toes like
[1:03:10] roots sticking on the ground and gossip
[1:03:12] let there be and breathe a breath of
[1:03:14] life into him and he jumped came to
[1:03:16] himself breathe a breath of life into
[1:03:18] him and he became a living soul
[1:03:21] now there are two elements
[1:03:23] that make up a human being one of them
[1:03:25] is your mind the other is your soul and
[1:03:27] the mind is your mental thinking your
[1:03:29] intellect
[1:03:30] your soul is a part of god that's in you
[1:03:33] now when you're born
[1:03:35] and as a child you go into a living soul
[1:03:37] at the age of choice you hear the gospel
[1:03:40] and there is something way inside of you
[1:03:42] that until you receive christ and you
[1:03:44] say well i'm too young now i'll wait a
[1:03:46] little longer now that is why you make a
[1:03:48] first mistake right there you grieve
[1:03:49] this person inside god is not going to
[1:03:51] judge you by the man up here your
[1:03:52] intellect he's going to judge you by
[1:03:54] your soul
[1:03:55] now many people have faith in your
[1:03:57] intellect others have faith in their
[1:03:58] soul now the intellect will reason and
[1:04:01] say it's not reasonable and so forth but
[1:04:04] remember the soul just believes the word
[1:04:06] of god
[1:04:07] isn't that right
[1:04:08] from recognizing this message listen to
[1:04:10] this now why
[1:04:13] you talking about uh trump revelation 17
[1:04:16] 11
[1:04:17] appears in line with the sixth seal
[1:04:19] mostly elijah two witnesses there's a
[1:04:20] problem when i get to mostly liars
[1:04:22] which the jews believe the prophets and
[1:04:25] they will come with the sign of the
[1:04:26] prophets and their work exactly
[1:04:29] now watch show one thing
[1:04:31] that man
[1:04:33] when you die
[1:04:35] whatever
[1:04:36] when you leave this world
[1:04:38] your nature doesn't change
[1:04:41] if you are lying now you'll be a liar
[1:04:43] there if you're hot headed here you'll
[1:04:46] be hunted a deer if your daughter here
[1:04:48] you'll be adopted there men and women
[1:04:50] it's time to shake yourself and examine
[1:04:52] yourselves and see where we are standing
[1:04:55] for death does not change it
[1:04:57] [Applause]
[1:04:58] that's why naked that came into this
[1:05:00] world but naked you will not leave
[1:05:02] you believe with your character or your
[1:05:04] nature
[1:05:05] death doesn't change who you are jet
[1:05:08] only changes your dwelling place
[1:05:12] are you with me
[1:05:13] so they have been gone for 2000 years
[1:05:15] moses about 2500 years and 2500 years
[1:05:18] has elijah been gone and moses and they
[1:05:20] returned with the same nature and do the
[1:05:22] same thing
[1:05:23] debt doesn't do nothing to a man but
[1:05:26] changes dwell in place
[1:05:28] it doesn't change your nature it doesn't
[1:05:30] change your faith it doesn't change
[1:05:32] nothing but your dwelling place so if
[1:05:34] your nature this morning you're doubt of
[1:05:36] god's word you'll be a doctor over there
[1:05:38] so i don't care holy you are how you
[1:05:40] live and how good you live it wouldn't
[1:05:43] change you a bit to die
[1:05:45] just your dwelling please
[1:05:47] and if you can't accept the whole word
[1:05:49] of god the way it's written you won't do
[1:05:52] it there don't worry you won't be there
[1:05:54] you have got to accept it in its
[1:05:56] fullness
[1:05:57] in the power of its vindication and the
[1:06:00] revelation of what it is then you become
[1:06:02] part of it
[1:06:04] are you with me
[1:06:05] so i've often said in the church he said
[1:06:09] live
[1:06:10] in a church
[1:06:12] live mortal beings each one is a great
[1:06:14] conglomeration of gaithy and blackness
[1:06:16] and darkness mortals live here
[1:06:19] they are either influenced from this way
[1:06:21] or that way here we go you cannot be a
[1:06:24] spiritual being sin or saint without
[1:06:26] having the influence on the underworld
[1:06:29] or the above world
[1:06:31] if you are influenced from here you are
[1:06:33] from above
[1:06:35] your celestial body is waiting up there
[1:06:37] but if you are wicked and hypocritical
[1:06:39] and indifferent your celestial body is
[1:06:41] down here regardless of how much you
[1:06:43] think is up there because the fruit here
[1:06:46] we go
[1:06:46] the fruit that you bear before people
[1:06:49] proves where you're from
[1:06:51] are you ready
[1:06:52] so you are here
[1:06:55] what you are somewhere else
[1:06:59] [Applause]
[1:07:01] that's a big one
[1:07:02] that's a big
[1:07:04] big big one you are here
[1:07:07] what you are somewhere else
[1:07:09] your life that you have lived here is
[1:07:12] reflecting your what your inheritance is
[1:07:14] when you leave here
[1:07:18] that's why the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:07:20] is the earnest
[1:07:21] or the down payment
[1:07:23] of your inheritance
[1:07:25] is a reflection that you already raised
[1:07:27] up and you're on your way to the
[1:07:29] resurrection
[1:07:32] so god give you a little don't payment
[1:07:33] the whole
[1:07:35] say hold this virtue power
[1:07:37] but you have more coming
[1:07:39] you have knowledge and temperance and
[1:07:41] patience and communist and public you
[1:07:43] have more virtues coming
[1:07:44] oh give the lord some praises people
[1:07:47] hallelujah
[1:07:49] here's a woman standing here
[1:07:51] i'm a young man waiting to get married
[1:07:53] she meets my specifications in every way
[1:07:55] she's a lovely christian she looks like
[1:07:57] one she's dressed like one she acts like
[1:07:59] one she lives like one i admit she'll
[1:08:00] make me a good wife but she isn't mine
[1:08:03] until i take off her mind
[1:08:05] and that's the way the message is you
[1:08:07] can sympathize with it say it's right
[1:08:09] but you've got to take it to yourself
[1:08:12] and
[1:08:13] for it to become part of it then you and
[1:08:15] the message become one
[1:08:17] then the anointing is with you
[1:08:20] as it with the others
[1:08:22] so the anointing is not just with the
[1:08:24] preacher but the anointed comes with you
[1:08:27] because you make the message a part of
[1:08:28] you and you are part of it then i will
[1:08:31] never leave you i'll never forsake you
[1:08:33] the anointing is with you wherever you
[1:08:35] go he is
[1:08:36] you don't have to feel him he is there
[1:08:39] all the time
[1:08:40] oh glory to god because he said so
[1:08:43] i'll never leave you
[1:08:45] i'll never forsake you i will be with
[1:08:48] you even in you
[1:08:49] to the end of the world oh could we give
[1:08:51] the lord some praises people
[1:08:54] glory
[1:08:56] hallelujah
[1:08:57] hallelujah
[1:08:59] blessed be the lord
[1:09:01] no brother branham
[1:09:03] is it true that every jew born since
[1:09:06] christ came will be saved
[1:09:08] who are the 144 thousand are they the
[1:09:11] predestinated ones to be sealed with the
[1:09:12] holy ghost and what is their mission
[1:09:15] there about three questions there
[1:09:17] is it true that every jew born since
[1:09:18] christ came in the world will be saved
[1:09:20] no
[1:09:22] here we go
[1:09:23] nothing will be saved
[1:09:25] only those whose names were put on the
[1:09:28] lamb's book of life before the
[1:09:30] foundation were jew or gentiles
[1:09:33] so when that book is concerned you are
[1:09:35] gentle your name have to be there
[1:09:37] that's why they say how much thousands
[1:09:39] of this tribe and that tribe and that
[1:09:40] tribe type of benjamin whatever it is
[1:09:42] specific after the tribe
[1:09:45] 144 tons is that right
[1:09:47] the book doesn't say leave let's be
[1:09:49] saved in this time of this church or oh
[1:09:50] my never it doesn't say that it just
[1:09:52] shows the mystery
[1:09:54] or unfolds the mystery
[1:09:56] but we ourselves by faith believe it
[1:10:00] so the book doesn't say john jones and
[1:10:02] harry smith or whatever the book that
[1:10:04] shows the mystery and you by faith
[1:10:06] connect with it
[1:10:08] and you see your name you say that's me
[1:10:10] that's me
[1:10:12] i am not madam party that's me
[1:10:14] oh glory to god i am no cigarette sucker
[1:10:17] oh yeah man miniskirt wearer no i want
[1:10:19] the word i want something that thunders
[1:10:21] i am not going to be a photocopy of all
[1:10:23] the young people out there no i'm going
[1:10:25] to be original
[1:10:27] oh are you with me
[1:10:28] [Applause]
[1:10:29] now oh watch then then he said we will
[1:10:32] be one as i am the father one that kind
[1:10:34] of one then how will it be the word in
[1:10:37] us
[1:10:38] would be the anointed word and that is
[1:10:40] the oneness of god
[1:10:42] the oneness of god is the word anointed
[1:10:45] in you
[1:10:46] then you become a son
[1:10:48] a messiah of the age
[1:10:50] so in other words you come from taught
[1:10:52] and you bypass the word
[1:10:55] you came to the earth to be tempted and
[1:10:57] tested
[1:10:59] but you are going back to the world
[1:11:01] because you have to be a taught
[1:11:03] in order to be a word
[1:11:05] because the word is a taught express
[1:11:07] you think it and then speak it so god
[1:11:09] can't lose his thoughts
[1:11:11] what fine thoughts he is thinking
[1:11:14] oh hallelujah what beautiful thoughts
[1:11:17] he's thinking this morning
[1:11:18] so watch this the one at a well with her
[1:11:21] life on earth she looks black she looks
[1:11:23] dirty she looks filthy whatever it is
[1:11:25] but in heaven she's fine
[1:11:27] [Music]
[1:11:29] you understand that
[1:11:30] not the pharisees on earth they look
[1:11:32] fine with the long gong and they put on
[1:11:33] the bed like spiritual what not but they
[1:11:36] were black the name was not up there
[1:11:38] because they're called to crucify him so
[1:11:40] that woman that's looking this way and
[1:11:41] that way her name is up there and this
[1:11:43] one looking so spiritual the name not up
[1:11:45] there so you can't go by looks
[1:11:49] it's not look as though this
[1:11:51] is believers though this
[1:11:53] you can't go by lurks
[1:11:57] because the same thing samuel was going
[1:11:59] to do
[1:12:00] when he was told to anoint one of
[1:12:02] jesse's son
[1:12:03] when the first guy came tall and
[1:12:05] handsome he said this surely this is he
[1:12:08] and god say god i don't go by looks.
[1:12:11] god doesn't see the way man sees
[1:12:13] oh give the lord some praise god doesn't
[1:12:15] see
[1:12:18] hallelujah
[1:12:20] glory
[1:12:21] no you say adam died by the brahmana but
[1:12:22] remember before adam died he had a lamb
[1:12:24] that redeemed him those who he fiona he
[1:12:26] called he had a lamb that redeemed him
[1:12:28] is not right then the lamb provided for
[1:12:30] adam is not right then why would we
[1:12:32] struggle with eternal life if that
[1:12:33] eternal sword breathes us by bread now
[1:12:36] someday the sons of god will again
[1:12:38] become gods
[1:12:40] jesus said is not it written your law
[1:12:41] your gods if you call those who we call
[1:12:44] god who visited you how can you condemn
[1:12:46] me to say i'm a son of god
[1:12:48] no watch he is now a son of god he makes
[1:12:51] a mistake he knows he's not he's doing
[1:12:53] wrong adam was not deceived
[1:12:56] adam knew he was doing wrong adam walked
[1:12:58] with eve because he was his wife
[1:13:00] christ was not deceived by satan but he
[1:13:02] walked into his debt with the bride
[1:13:04] he went to be with the bride so he could
[1:13:06] redeem the church so you could
[1:13:08] understand how man was fallen so god
[1:13:10] became man to redeem man
[1:13:12] he can't redeem man from up dear he had
[1:13:14] to come down here to redeem man so he
[1:13:17] subject himself to the law of sin and
[1:13:19] death
[1:13:20] that's why christ had to die
[1:13:22] hallelujah to reach us right where we
[1:13:25] are
[1:13:25] oh glory to god
[1:13:28] hallelujah
[1:13:29] in spirit he was god in flesh he was man
[1:13:33] my god why have god forsaken me
[1:13:35] [Applause]
[1:13:38] oh hallelujah in other words he wept at
[1:13:41] the grave of lazarus as a man he wept
[1:13:43] but when he rolled away the stone when
[1:13:46] he ball where have you laid him when he
[1:13:48] cried lazarus come forth that was more
[1:13:50] than a man so on this side you see the
[1:13:52] law of sin and death you see in tears
[1:13:55] you see and crying you're seeing
[1:13:56] depression and frustration but when you
[1:13:58] speak it thunders
[1:14:01] oh
[1:14:03] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:14:05] so don't mystic weakness hallelujah for
[1:14:09] weakness meekness or weakness no
[1:14:11] meekness is power in control oh
[1:14:14] hallelujah when he looking defeated the
[1:14:16] cross on his back they're beating him
[1:14:17] they're hitting him they're laughing at
[1:14:19] him when you're looking at his weakest
[1:14:20] point he was at his greatest conquering
[1:14:22] power because he's going to hell to take
[1:14:25] the keys from the devil
[1:14:26] i've got the keys on hell and the grave
[1:14:29] oh glory to god hallelujah hell
[1:14:32] rejoicing because the messiah is
[1:14:35] crucified but then they heard unknocking
[1:14:38] i when they heard that knocking here the
[1:14:40] lamb jesus opened up that gate and he
[1:14:43] snapped the keys of death and hell and
[1:14:45] let captivity captive all who the devil
[1:14:48] had wrong he opened up the prison open
[1:14:50] up open up the emperor come on come on
[1:14:51] come on open up them prison breath open
[1:14:54] up open up open
[1:14:55] [Applause]

[1:15:40] dissolved we have another body with him

[1:15:47] [Applause]
[1:15:50] come on same at somebody
[1:15:52] [Applause]
[1:15:57] you're a host and a dying man

[1:16:30] hallelujah
[1:16:32] feel good i feel good
[1:16:34] feel good hallelujah and but i'm
[1:16:36] describing this way when a woman have a
[1:16:38] baby isn't that right is it outside the
[1:16:41] mother after nine months there's a soul
[1:16:42] a spirit waiting there
[1:16:44] waiting for the body to come
[1:16:46] muscles quitting out there but to give
[1:16:48] it a nature there's a life out there
[1:16:50] waiting the life on the inside of the
[1:16:52] boom is not the same like outside so it
[1:16:54] takes a spank to get the breath in
[1:17:00] if the baby come out that means still
[1:17:01] born so it takes something to happen
[1:17:03] this adam was standing like this a mud
[1:17:05] man
[1:17:07] i'll just see it that way and i'm
[1:17:09] standing dead like a mud man
[1:17:11] the spirit man watching this mud man and
[1:17:13] god of the butter spanx
[1:17:19] a man became a living soul
[1:17:21] and adam's limbs get activated now we
[1:17:22] could move
[1:17:23] now we could call his cell phone
[1:17:27] he's not activated no no no we could now
[1:17:29] we could move this and move that and now
[1:17:31] he can get his fork and dig up the linen
[1:17:33] and till the soil
[1:17:35] all the time be moving like a mist over
[1:17:37] the ground and whatnot but this is no
[1:17:39] miss now this is physical thing three
[1:17:41] move here orange to the left to the left
[1:17:43] to the left mounting to the right to the
[1:17:44] right to the right
[1:17:47] adam is speaking adam is naming adam is
[1:17:49] organizing and god was well pleased
[1:17:51] god was so pleased he turned us back
[1:17:53] [Applause]
[1:17:58] you could fool god
[1:18:00] you know why god put us back
[1:18:02] to give everybody a chance
[1:18:05] to give the serpent a chance to give eve
[1:18:08] a chance to give adam a chance to give
[1:18:10] everybody a chance god couldn't be
[1:18:12] watching and things take a chance god
[1:18:13] turn his back and say well continue on
[1:18:16] but god plan
[1:18:18] his purpose
[1:18:20] can't change
[1:18:21] his word
[1:18:22] can't change his objective and motive
[1:18:25] can't change
[1:18:26] so why
[1:18:27] adam gone demonstrating his power
[1:18:30] talking to lion and bees and everything
[1:18:32] else they still can sneak up on eve give
[1:18:34] you some kind of nancy story and sweeten
[1:18:36] her head and sweeten her mind and he
[1:18:38] fell down give her husband and man fell
[1:18:40] what a dark day that was and god wept
[1:18:43] and god cried and god rolled over and
[1:18:45] bore because he didn't know what i'm
[1:18:46] what i'm gonna do no there was a plan
[1:18:49] he had a plan before they had this stuff
[1:18:52] hallelujah before you do your stuff you
[1:18:53] have a plan
[1:18:55] all things work together for good to
[1:18:58] damn that love good to them who are the
[1:19:01] called
[1:19:03] according to his purpose

[1:19:11] all
[1:19:12] things
[1:19:13] work together

[1:22:47] the blood had to be applied and the
[1:22:49] blood meant animal dying but the animal
[1:22:52] had no soul so the nature couldn't come
[1:22:54] back upon man to replace his own old
[1:22:56] nature isn't that right so then the
[1:22:59] blood which was the chemistry is what
[1:23:01] was represented
[1:23:02] as the token when i see the blood i'm
[1:23:05] going to pass over you because the
[1:23:07] animal life had no soul
[1:23:10] so there was no spirit from the animal
[1:23:12] to come back upon the worshipper but
[1:23:14] when jesus died he was god's lamb his
[1:23:17] soul was the holy ghost so when he died
[1:23:20] the life of that lamb could not come
[1:23:22] back upon the believer and that's the
[1:23:24] holy ghost that's the change of nature
[1:23:27] that's the soul
[1:23:29] oh glory to god are you seeing it
[1:23:32] hallelujah no more the chemistry but the
[1:23:35] life of god come back upon you the
[1:23:37] believer then it's not you no more it's
[1:23:40] the holy ghost upon you it's the holy
[1:23:42] ghost in you it's the holy ghost through
[1:23:44] you
[1:23:46] [Applause]
[1:23:52] so the talker now
[1:23:54] is the literal life of jesus christ
[1:23:56] we turn back upon the believer
[1:23:58] from swords that are prisoner of the
[1:23:59] soul of man is not the body of man it's
[1:24:02] the soul and the soul is the nature of
[1:24:04] the spirit so when the nature of man we
[1:24:06] were dead pictures we were dead our
[1:24:09] lives are hidden god through christ
[1:24:10] sealed by the holy ghost that wasn't
[1:24:12] your body that died it wasn't your
[1:24:13] spirit you died it's what your nature of
[1:24:16] your spirit that died and the nature
[1:24:18] which is the soul the nature of your
[1:24:19] soul god if you're born again it's not
[1:24:21] you oh hallelujah it's eternal life it's
[1:24:25] life that never a beginning life that
[1:24:26] never and that's what's inside of you
[1:24:29] oh praise the name of the lord so all
[1:24:31] powers of hell might wage against it but
[1:24:33] it will never prevail we have god's
[1:24:35] eternal promise oprah is not up to me
[1:24:37] it's not up to you whether it will be
[1:24:39] destroyed or not it's up to god oh
[1:24:41] hallelujah
[1:24:42] now we would think today upon
[1:24:43] destruction trying to destroy we have
[1:24:45] christ on the promise we think of the
[1:24:47] hebrew children god had purpose for them
[1:24:49] that they were dung in babylon that the
[1:24:50] fullness was hot seven times hotter it
[1:24:52] was going to heat it they destroyed the
[1:24:54] purpose of god all babylon was on a rage
[1:24:56] they were determined satan was
[1:24:58] determined to destroy the purpose of god
[1:25:00] for he knew those churros going to the
[1:25:01] furnace so he made the furnace and
[1:25:03] heated up seven times hotter to be sure
[1:25:06] the program of god would be destroyed
[1:25:08] but god wanted to displace power and all
[1:25:10] babylon and all hell could not defeat
[1:25:13] that purpose
[1:25:14] they could have hid this furnace a
[1:25:15] million times hotter it would have never
[1:25:17] destroyed the purpose of god god wanted
[1:25:20] to show that he was the god of
[1:25:22] deliverance and he would bring
[1:25:24] deliverance to whomsoever he desired to
[1:25:26] bring it and nothing could interfere
[1:25:28] with this program so i'm telling you
[1:25:30] lose your faith here this morning and
[1:25:32] believe god for the impossible believe
[1:25:34] god for the difficult believe god for
[1:25:36] miracles what you never think god would
[1:25:38] do i'm saying god is able to do all
[1:25:41] things are possible to them that believe
[1:25:43] you can go free this morning
[1:25:48] oh glory to god hallelujah you can
[1:25:51] i know the devil talking to your mind

[1:26:09] because if i was the devil i'll tell you
[1:26:10] you can't
[1:26:11] that way they were supposed to bring
[1:26:12] doubts
[1:26:13] bring fears go god won't deliver that's
[1:26:16] why i come to tell you nothing will
[1:26:18] defeat the purpose of god according to
[1:26:21] election before the children do any
[1:26:24] wrong thing go to esau i hate jacob i
[1:26:27] love he knew what they will do

[1:30:21] to show that nothing can defeat his
[1:30:23] purpose not even debt not defeat his
[1:30:25] purpose abraham was good as dead serious
[1:30:27] woman had been dead for 45 years but
[1:30:30] nothing can defeat the purpose of god
[1:30:32] what a curveball god bowled the devil
[1:30:34] and let abraham believe sarah
[1:30:36] gonna have her son
[1:30:38] and watch watch when you force
[1:30:40] and manufacture something
[1:30:42] sarah had an interpretation
[1:30:45] of how that was supposed to be
[1:30:47] she said look at my maid and today the
[1:30:49] fruit of that is what you see all along
[1:30:51] right now
[1:30:53] a whole bunch of abraham's seed
[1:30:56] on a different line altogether
[1:31:02] that the bible said every man shall be
[1:31:04] against them and they shall be against
[1:31:05] every man
[1:31:08] now they cutting out head neck
[1:31:09] everything
[1:31:11] a kind of murderous generation
[1:31:14] that because abraham had see two higger
[1:31:17] and they form a whole lineage right now
[1:31:21] all because he went and manufactured
[1:31:23] something instead of wheaton
[1:31:25] for the promise so don't try to
[1:31:26] manufacture something you produce a wild
[1:31:28] man
[1:31:30] producer ishmael
[1:31:32] no stick politicizer
[1:31:34] stick with what god promised
[1:31:36] because the children have promised a
[1:31:38] country for seed
[1:31:40] because all israel is not israel
[1:31:43] come on now all in the message is not
[1:31:45] the message

[1:32:02] was dried up her heart was weak it could
[1:32:04] not have went through labor
[1:32:07] but god let us know that his purpose
[1:32:09] will not be defeated he changed sarah
[1:32:11] and make a young woman again amen and
[1:32:14] turn back in on his youth god gave a
[1:32:16] promise and abram staggered not at the
[1:32:17] promise of god through unbelief but was
[1:32:19] strong giving praise to god hallelujah
[1:32:22] first of all we know most assuredly that
[1:32:24] the purpose of god stands in election it
[1:32:27] was purpose in himself it was god's
[1:32:28] purpose to pray for the people like unto
[1:32:30] himself that would be a word bride she
[1:32:32] was chosen before the foundation of the
[1:32:34] world to be in him she was foreknown and
[1:32:37] beloved before she ever even brought
[1:32:39] forth
[1:32:40] she was redeemed by his blood and can
[1:32:42] never come into condemnation
[1:32:45] she can never be in the judgment because
[1:32:48] sin cannot be imputed unto her
