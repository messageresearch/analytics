demons loosed against them because they rejected the full of torment and God blinded them to give you the Gentiles be the Gentile an opportunity to be put into this great Fang of God into this great program of God we can sit like if nothing has happened we can sit as if the seven seas has unbroken to reveal all these mysteries that we can kept called glory and praise or glory to God we can't do that hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah maybe season the angels can't sing this song the angels canceling this Redemption saw they don't understand what is the we lost and to be found they don't

to God for we elected you how we predestinated you how we send a spirit to find you all but we are almost there we are almost there we gonna hit that touchdown one day you're know you're gonna strike the Church of the Living God Oh Oh Prison prison or glory to God I was silky prison him in a good time in the bad time and the tough time and the rugged time in the time and I don't understand I can't

the bad loose that's why you have all them trans and tested because you have to produce something why you thinking why you think are a fear Oh went to kill all them babies because Moses was born a special I was born and the devil himself said kill or kill or kill or all we have to find him kill all and the devil thought he was gonna get you but he couldn't get you whether you were smoking drinking two rows it I don't know what you've been through the devil thought he was gonna get you but he can't get you [Music] hallelujah [Music] we were born in sin and ship iniquity and that is why Feliz is part of the package mistakes is part of the package making oh she's part of the package all God's sons went to their own issues Noah had his demon as his Shalom and his every one of them had is but the blood the blood just the blood the blood the blood is what speaks on your behalf when you can't talk where you can save nothing there's a blood as a bumper we can on your behalf the blood that speaketh better teams under better Vader it's speaking and speaking and your weakness is speaking strength in your ignorance is speaking knowledge yes yes yes it speaks the blood of Jesus speaks I'm gonna speak on your behalf or that blood will not lose its power this morning I don't care what you have done what you have been through that blood will not lose his power this morning or get a lot of praise offering the devil can wipe you out the director out you out the devil had taken him off that book blood of Jesus call you may be seated or preschool so he said now the church has found the Holy Ghost for under nearly two thousand years under martyrdom down there it's been wrong not at the river Euphrates we have seen the river is but not a believer it is but at the door of creeds and dogmas that the Holy Spirit can work in the church because of manmade system so once you put the plumbing with madman system Holy Spirit can walk to it because man set up the own thing set up the own lines and pipe and that's where quarter walk you that quarrels doing his own plumbing God has run his own line God has make his own connection and when God put his life and pull back the switch full power same works I do shall get walls same annoys him say hey what was an alpha will be an Omega and if the alpha produce Ibaka rocks so help me God me a couple we must it is absolutely necessary and compulsory that we produce another book of Acts could we hear shout endure how not padishah book not some textbook not some mystery book the some writing book not some message book but the book of Acts the acts of the Holy Ghost in men and woman who became a living book who became a written mystery a little mystery in mystery manifested mystery of God may be seated the Holy Spirit has been bound by these denomination rivers for almost 2,000 years but is to be loosed so talk loose loosed by the evil time message where remember always the meanest even time s is the looser Holy Ghost how the tablet touch stop and loose Holy Ghost that Holy Ghost or care that Holy Ghost don't run Devils out the Holy Ghost us heal the sick Holy Ghost has cast out Devils that Holy Ghost as produce miracles and I set the captive free no demon cast up the river of God the Holy Ghost have God nobody oh there's a lot of shock or glory of God something on the floor something on her floor something on her floor let me season but I'm not a preacher this morning I'm just make it yes let's make an away for this preacher that gun ended up all right from United I'm a sign he's in ever since the days of the early church reach that ever see the things we have seen today and this was only made possible when God sent the seven seals and give us a sign buy it and send seven angels down from heaven and come to bring back that scattered wouldn't any nominations and tie it back in the Word of God again to bring down the Holy Spirit so the plumbing of God the wiring of God was scattered shortages so wanted to pick up all the wires all the connections and tie it together to bring down the Holy Spirit because with the restoration of the word come the restoration of power let me hit when I said again with the restoration of the will come the restoration of power so quarters and seven angels and line up all this word philosophy beat and argue and discuss it's the power back in the church so your expectation this morning is for the power of God the commented attached to prep rejoice Jesus Christ Oh hallelujah do you see you may be seated at time by the tongue is Vinny's coach how many years back sitting you say I wouldn't admit that but a brand that's why I say it so fast but look if that dove of meekness it's gone from you brother there's something wrong top of what missus as our word people don't like too much because they attribute mixes with weakness but meekness is not weakness weakness could be power in control our let's continue there is something wrong there we go when you can't be with one another when you can't forgive every person from the depths of your heart no matter what they have done or what they have said if you can't forgive them from the depths Jesus said if you don't forgive every man is trespasses from your heart neither does your heavenly Father forgive you if you can't forgive you are in trouble big time because faith is based on forgiveness if you want to have fear for your healing gate for your breakthrough every deliverance you have to forgive just drop it just leave it get on your hands let's just let it go get out you have released a person let them go free free to shout free to praise God let that court deal with them oh don't judge them let go deal with them let it go let it go let it go let it go and I believe prophecy that the Church of the Living God is moving to a sphere now that's going to shake the whole world that's the first time it spins and Jesus of Nazareth's the human being ask anything that you will it shall be given to you anything you desire don't you see the words of Jesus Christ going to be fulfilled is going to come to pass pretty soon I am looking for it to happen in this meeting ah he is prophesying it but he was expecting it right then I'm looking for it to happen unless meeting watch what was he looking for I'm looking for the happen is written I'm worn as I happen now that the anointing which strike the whole Church of the Living God and we will rise to her feet like a mighty Mack tsunami this is name hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah the sick will be healed by a world he described what to expect he described what has to happen not turn around and greet somebody in Jesus if only a little more than that doesn't mean he by the word human being first by the word itself follow for you you come in here a second walk or your whole how many want to see that Amen song in a week how many wanna see that you have to warn that they're coming and miserable and leave it at the peace of God your mind messed up the confusion and your leave here and your peace I brought up on your mind your spirit [Music] you said the sacred be here by a word the band will see the different air will be raised up and the power of God will shake the world with the Church of the Living God we are in the process of it right now I believe it's coming come to pass I believe we'll just be exactly that way I believe it's gonna strike the Church of God soon I'm gonna start a revival that will shake the world I wanted the seventh on the revival because another bag hadn't arrived yet or glory does I wonder if that's a manifestation I've got to straight up right you mean this thing I reject the world yes first and I'll shake your world I won't you this morning well glory to God hallelujah just two more and I'm done and when a man is inspired [Music] and he reads the inspired word the two inspirations together gives a result no matter how well you study the word it will never do you good until you inspire yourself it takes your inspiration because the world is already inspired that's well already inspired all it takes is you but the inspiration to connect with the world I write inspire a [Music] woman's done so what we need to do is an inspiration over us God's sweeping down with a new inspiration and breathing over us his power his love and himself that he may inspire us the quickness and weakness to this word and then the word being brought into that spirit of inspiration then you will see miracles happen and things take place because the two come together all my oh my oh my so do you see always gonna happen now you are gonna be inspired hallelujah and you're gonna turn next for the inspire world and it gonna make um a channel of appleschmear miracles gonna take place signs and wonders gonna take place because you are brought into a channel of inspiration final coat and I'm afraid tonight friend I see it with respects and with reference I'm afraid we are given the church the wrong and a school in we are giving them the schooling from a dead letter and not from the experimentalist standpoint of the new built to meet the true and living resurrected Lord Jesus Christ who is the same yesterday today and forever they saw Stan [Music] jehovah is your name my team my job is your name Jehovah is your name toku bob but i za here's your name [Music] your own

miraculous to take place Lord need to be a different kind of a day me this service be a different kind of a service me you walk out the pages of the Bible Lord may I not be able to minister this morning by me Rahul Eagles himself dropped down and baptized sons and daughters into the body of Christ follow me you arrest Lord those that need to be spiritually arrested may you heal the sick in

moving you know I was sitting in the room and and I was seeing I wanted to come up on that song Jehovah is their name I never said anything to anybody and why I loved it was speaking the musicians start playing this song but over it was preaching last Sunday and I didn't tell him what I was gonna have for today but he started to touch on something and I was like he's easy this is just already tough healing and then but over in read a quote I didn't know what could he had talked about u19 time I said I'm like wait a minute something is moving friends hallelujah and I feel good this morning because God is just getting started we're gonna see more of the miraculous take place before we leave this place we have been under the Ministry of the word for many years or when a minister of the Spirit comes when the spirit of truth comes when the comforter walks into the building he takes every spirit under his control it was number the Branham taking every spirit under control but it was the angel of the Lord that give the property authority to say I take every spirit under my control for the glory and honor of God and this morning we take every spirit under our control for the honor and glory of God if you are keen with change you are gonna leave free if you came and feeling lower you're gonna leave on top of the mountain because the season is upon us hallelujah if you have your Bibles greetings to all Thank You beloved thank you for the Steven thank you musicians sin John 15 just one portion of Scripture this morning from sin John 15 and reading from verse one see in John 15 and first one I am The True Vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth NOT fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purchased it that email it may bring forth more fruit now you are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you abide in me and I in you as the branch listen here now cannot be a fruit of itself so no fruit is coming without the vine except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch in other words he is separated as a branch he is cut off as a branch he is no longer connected and his withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if he abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you hiren is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples as the father hath loved me so have I loved you continue ye in my love if he keep my Commandments you shall abide in my love even as I have kept my father's Commandments and abide in his love these things have I spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you greater love hath no man than this than a man lay down his life for his friends ye are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you henceforth in other words because of this I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you he have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the Father in my name he may give it to you may the Lord at a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord are you happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning Amen or what a time we are living in we have a tremendous time with the young people yesterday is speaking on proverbs 4:23 to guard your heart for out of it are all the issues of life every issue that you go through every issue that you have gone through every issue that you will go through comes out of what is in your heart and we are challenged we are instructed we are admonished by scripture to guard it with all diligence so it's not just God it's sometimes but with all diligence to guard your heart because out of it are all the issues of life and we are speaking about different scriptures love the Lord with all your heart with all your mind with all your soul with all your strength that all is a hundred percent so that love is a hundred percent of your heart a hundred percent of your mind a hundred percent of your soul a hundred percent of your strength and love is an action word so if you love God in your mind a hundred percent in your heart a hundred percent in your soul a hundred percent in your strength a hundred percent there's no room for the devil to to move in there it's impossible to backslide if you are loving God with all of your heart all of your mind all of your soul and all of your strength the problems in our Christian journey are connected to when that degree of love moves from a hundred percent in 99 to 97 to 98 percent for summit down to four percent for some it's 14 percent and different levels are percentages so as we can it's back to the word and back to the spirit is to reconnect us to that great love can the church amen and our guiding of our heart is an everyday thing that's why it's with all diligence it's not got it on a Sunday it's with all diligence it's got it every single day got it on your job got it in your home got it in your marriage got it in the church got it when you're about to pray you're guarding it because in your heart has a seed in your heart as a sea that was placed there before you knew this gospel in your heart as a sea that was placed there before you knew about worship in your heart in the sea that was placed there before you knew about the blood but now that you know about the blood now that you know about this gospel now that you know who God is who the devil is and who you are now you have a commission to God that seed because in that serious life in that serious power in that seat is potential in that series adoption in that seat is perfection in that seat is your healing in that seat is your family in that seat is your deliverance in that seat is the promise in that seat is your purpose in that seat is your mission in that seat is what God has planned for you that he locked up inside of you that the devil doesn't know about so he's trying to attack that seed but we are commanded to guard our hearts up to protect that seed from every attack of the enemy to protect that seed from the enemies that are outside any enemies are within can the church say man you love the Lord this morning blessed be the name of the Lord so our title this morning my title is the greatest connection the greatest connection and I have a subject I am the vine and you are the branches and an inspiration there is my spirit flowing freely you know where I'm going this morning right so we live in a connected world from the beginning of time man has tried to stay connected try to stay connected by rights and messages others to see scraping it on the walls then as a man learned to write he tried to stay connected by writing letters so if you're going somewhere take this letter with you because I'm not physically in the proximity of the person that I want to see connected to so I'm sending a letter to them are you with me this morning then we evolved to the telephone so even though you can't see somebody you could call them on the phone to stay connected can the church say man and then we had email so you can stay connected even faster you can send an email it off to wait three weeks with a letter to get to somebody all these are attempts to see connected and then we enter with mobile phones and satellites and Technology and whatsapp and social media all of this we live in a connected world with the information superhighway and the Internet and everything is about connection and and connectivity they even see now if you want to know how many people at home has turned off the Wi-Fi and you'll find people coming with the rooms you didn't know they oh you didn't realize it was but who turned off the connection what happens at a Wi-Fi connection because we are we are we are living on a connected world they're people by instinct that if phone is not the issue we talk about people that one of the first things they do is pick up the phone if that phone has no Wi-Fi nobody picks up the phone somebody talk to me this morning it's because of the connection because there is a connection to the phone now data could move now communication can happen you can know what's going on you can know what's happening because of connection and the church say man we are connected by technology we are connected by geography had it not been for the fact that we were born on this island you may have never seen me I mean I've never seen you so our connection is also by geography our connection is also by history but there's also spiritual connections that are above all of these natural connections they are connections in nature they are connections in our body that doctors still are trying to figure out how this works of every thought you have is a connection that's taking place in your brain it's a chemical connection the doctors call it synaptic connection a biochemical connection so their connections in the science there are connections in the spirits Rob and before there was a world before there was a moon before there was a star before anything core existed alone and he longed to have connections by himself he could not have any kind of a connection it's impossible to have a connection if you are standing alone so God created angels and he started to connect with the Angels and when the angels worship Him he got some feedback from the worship and where the pranam said that's what made him caught up because God is the object of worship but what created that worship and that relationship of God was a connection between the angels and LLR Elohim so when they started to connect and praise and worship and the attributes of God was activated because of the connection but there were certain ports there were certain available sockets in God for some additional connections that the angels could not relate to they were not compatible with because God had the capacity to have connections to release healing he had the capacity to have connections up to give deliverance he had the ability he had the capacity through his connections to bring Redemption so go along for connections so when Adam came it was the first time that a different connection started God were coming in the cool of the evening he loved his connection so much that every day in the cool of the evening he will come now to connect with Adam Adam how was your tea talk to me Adam let's fellowship let's get connection people want to connect on Facebook and LinkedIn and Instagram God loves to connect to have you connected with him have you accepted his connection requests dear ones Adam Adam look forward for that connection Lord I named this animal to swing and move this mountain to swing and good love the connection he looked forward for the connection every evening he come down until 1:00 me you may be seated sim came and broke the connection I'm Gordon see Adam where are you you're not on my network I'm trying to find you and I can't find new the connection is not working how it did yesterday Adam what happened Adam where are you and the connection was broken and from that day on God has been trying to re-establish the kind of connection that he had not only you may be seated was man was caught trying to re-establish a connection but the man also knew he was missing something because when you read the Bible and the building of the Tower of Babel man knew that there was a power source somewhere and man tried to build his power to connect to the power source the power source was not on it man knew the power source was somewhere about and God said they were united in their mission and their purpose to reconnect to the power source and the church see man and when God saw how they were trying to use technology to make this connection he said because they are united in their purpose they will actually achieve it but that's not how I want to be connected I don't want to connect on your terms I want to connect on my terms I don't want you to live one way and try to be connected because that's what they wanted to do they want to have their form of religion their form of understanding but the Branham said live like Devils and run up by me good taste of the presence of God but live any way they want to can the church say man we are talking about connections this morning life is about connections somebody looking for a job you want to know who you know what connections you have you know anybody in your bank I'm looking for a connection because I want to get alone trying to get a host you know anybody who needs you see I want looking for a connection life is about connection if your heart disconnects from your body with a George you know what happened connections are necessary but it's about the right type of connection there's a connection between labor and reward can we talk this morning a little bit there is a connection between actions and consequences you can't separate these things these connections exist there's a connection between how much you study and the results you get at your examination halle-loo here is a connection between what you eat and how you feel there's a connection between joy and your strength because my Bible tells me the joy of my lord of the Lord is my strength so the more joy you have there's a natural because of the connection you have more strength so if you don't have strength this morning maybe something is up with your connection can the church say man there's a connection between prayer and revival there's a connection between fasting and amplifying your prayers there's a connection between the Alpha Church and the Omega church that here without us cannot be made perfect somebody preach back to me this morning there's a connection between attending church services and the coming of the Lord because he said forsake not the assembling of yourselves together even as the day approaches there's a connection between the word and the spirit there's a connection between so and everything oh come on now there's a connection between the prophet and the prophecy there's a connection with you and the predestinated seed in your soul that the devil cannot touch there's a connection with where was now when I lay the foundations of the earth and the morning stars sang together there's a connection between the seed and the fruit because every seed must spring forth after its time come on now come on now there's a connection between a momma and her daughter that's why the Bible can see the promise done to you and your children God respects the connection he's a God of connection it's because there was a connection that's how we can find you you may be seated I'm not gonna be too long with you this morning but it's a connection building sacrifice connection between saving and having the connection between the physical exercise and how your body feels that's it the next to me between what effort you put in your marriage and the quality of your marriage there's a connection between how you talk to your children and the relationship between parents and children there's a connection with how children speaks to parents because the Bible says obey your parents honor your parents or your life to be long so long life is connected to how you live in your house there's a connection to your attitude coming to service and what you get out of the service there's a connection between how you look at things and what you get out of it because when you look what do you see it depends on what you're looking for there's a connection between how much of the word is in you and how much you grow 44:24 6404 it's connected [Music] halleluyah halleluyah hopefully this helped somebody this morning I pray this helps of money there's no accident it's about connections when you get upset with somebody you pass exams they did something to pass the exam there's a connection somebody successful in business there's a connection between the effort I said to the young people yesterday you could say what you want the people who have I know people who get up 4:00 a.m. every morning they're at their desk working and when they have you cough actually when you enter work at 8 or 10 and at 3:45 you ready back up they had work at 4:00 a.m. and leaving at 9:00 p.m. there's a connection between what you put into anything and what you get out of it and God valued this connection which is bright so much that he invested everything he could he gave His only begotten Son that was a sacrifice he took to ensure that this relationship that this connection will here to results you may be seated this encouraging you this morning and we trying to get to the greatest connection these are all connection we ever reached a greater connection yet huh so I stumbled upon something and but the Branum spoke about Einstein about 30-plus of so time but a random refer to Albert Einstein and Albert Einstein coined a paper and wrote something about some quantum entanglement and he said when two particles will kindly connect however briefly it is called entanglement a connection takes place quantum entanglement which Albert Einstein called spooky action at a distance because he couldn't wrap his mind around all of it is how Albert Einstein famously derided the concept of quantum entanglement where objects can become linked and instantaneously influence one another regardless of distance so when this entanglement takes place with a punch no matter how far the particles separate because they had that contact before because they had that connection because they had that entanglement at some point no matter how far the platicas goes it will always behave in correlation to the other particle it interacted with no matter how long ago it happened no matter how far apart it becomes quantum entanglement is a phenomenon that scientists trying to figure out let me read it this is science I'm reading an and you tell me this sounds familiar anyway where objects can become linked and instantaneously influence one another regardless of distance no researchers suggest that this spooky action in a way might work even beyond the grave with its effect felt after the link between objects is broken so scientists seen the exists this phenomena where once two particles interact with one another despite how long ago it was despite how far it was despite even every particle with me grief always considered dead that it doesn't change the impact that one particle could have any other particle so I was thinking about this connection that existed before there was a moon before there was a stop before there was a molecule there was some entanglement that took place in the realm that we don't yet fully understand and that entanglement has existed all along even when you ain't in that quantum entanglement that spiritual antenna it could not be broken you may be seated [Applause] could it be I'm a scientist but could it be that when Lazarus died that that entanglement he had before he was born even though he was dead in the grave that entanglement could still connect to his cells because Jesus said Lazarus come forth and a man who was in another dimension in another realm he had been dead for a few days but distance and separate him time didn't separate him being dead in separated because he was connected can we continue the science class I had intended to put this up on the PowerPoint and the person in the back were with him for the presentation but I search and I get up to standard to show these things but I see this quantum entanglement thing is so powerful I just want to read one more description for you quantum entanglement is a physical phenomena phenomena is when something it's out of his out of normal explanation right that uncursed when Pierre's or groups of particles are generated interact or share special proximity so you commonly see him space it is interact with Jesus and your life is only see me something has decreased it has come it is presence for a brief moment at that brief what is enough you went to a meeting one night and maybe you stumble maybe you fell but that meeting one night that connection cannot be broken you lost you ever yes but that meeting one night somebody helped me this morning [Applause] or shear special proximity in ways listen such that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the state of the others in other words once they static interact you can't separate them you can describe one without talking about the other you can't talk about this one without talking about the next one anybody with me anybody with me this morning so the moment you talk about God talking about you the moment I talk about you to talk about God because you are connected oh come on somebody reach back to me oh that's why the Prophet said the moment the bride gets to know she is it's finished do you realize that you couldn't be here this morning unless there was a connection and because there's a connection you must be in a rapture because of the connection you must be healed because of the holy laws you must make the rapture oh somebody give God a shout of praise you may be seated hallelujah the prodigal son he left his home unless his family went to a far country and even in his law moment the connection came back to him that he had his father that is a simple concept he came to himself that connection he had just came back to him he said wait a minute the servants in my father's house get better treatment than this and he particles in him saying let me go back home and the father is also looking for the son because the particles in him know he has a son out here somewhere he cannot be separated the Blackson condition cannot change the connection that has already existed no one that the Bible says who he foreknew he called her who we call he justified he will justify he has already glorified [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and I like it you may be seated the scientists are the ones seen even when the practicals are separated by a large distance this thing working I'm a scientist but listen anything that science trying to scratch it's just a little small fraction of the economy you're Gordon oh and if scientists trying to figure out these kind of connections brother I'm so excited mama papa I don't care how far your son is how far your daughter is I don't care how far your health went away from your body it's connected your health has got to come back your son has got to come back your daughter has got to come back your mind has got to come back your joy it's connected to you your joy has got to come back your peace has got to come back oh come on somebody preach back to me maybe you listen oh you ain't seen it for a minute if you've ever been in a revival before you already interacted with it it's got to come back to you we talk about what happened in 83 if you were there it's coming back for you oh come on somebody came in now listen let's take it higher this morning maybe seated but the Branham said I'm identified he said I was there back in the day of Pentecost he said I'm identified with what happened back there but abandoned where's our mother Alma he was a relevant angle meant when he went there so if we had a Pentecost there that's why the Prophet that say the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real today as it was we are been there before [Applause] you may be seated [Applause] anybody in the house this morning anybody in the house this morning anybody in the house this morning you may be seated the Bible says the devil comes steal to kill to destroy the devil could only see what you have so if the devil at your door even if you don't know it you have something even if you don't know what you have even if you don't know what you have the devil knows you have something that's why you come to steal that's why you come to kill that's why I come to destroy the problem is most of us don't know what we have but the devil sees it he recognizes that he knows you were there you ever seen it for a minute that's why when Cho was in his lowest moment quad reminded you of his entanglement he telling where were you before the morning stars sang together because he was there your restoration is coming because you were there come on you spiritual scientists come on you spiritual scientists your healing is guaranteed your raptures parentid your adoption is guaranteed your perfectionist guaranteed [Applause] you may be seated let's talk a little more the wood itself its power the wood itself is life the wood itself is light so when you hear the would you get entangled in the wood and that's why the Bible said my words cannot return void because it drop on somebody it entangles so there are young people they might be in a bar right now but they entangled because a maritime meter the military service when you breathe its entanglement because prayer changes situations break a copy on where you are and reach somebody you may be seated for a minute these are laws unbreakable laws the top of the front of the school brother brother brother's car but if I said let's pray and it's better brethren pray it something came over the driver the world of pray backed by power encountered him and entanglement took place and distance didn't stop the effect but the Branham is older countries here before the doctors and touches my wife the tumor will go down [Applause] this sense is nothing to God I'm not just talking about physical distance spiritual distance there people are physically here and spiritually somewhere else spiritually they've gone for a walk spiritually they have walked on the beach because I don't want to confront the issues of life what that distance cannot stop God David ended up with a broken connection because this connection broke he changed his prey said Lord restore unto me the joy of my salvation David was asking for a reconnection his line had been cut but if Adam said that God doesn't walk away from us he said we are the ones who walk away if you want to find God go right back where you left him he'll be standing right there anybody in the house is Smalley and the beautiful thing about God because man has been progressing to try to break into God's laboratory you know yes ago our microphones had cords no they do have cords anymore he has forgot to connect to the internet you have to get a physical phone line now there is Wi-Fi because God don't need no physical line to connect and I think Burrillville said it last week when you connect to a Wi-Fi connection one of the amazing technologies is if you connected Wi-Fi in your house and you fly all the country and you come back a year later once you reach back to your house your phone does carry connect one time enough because that is your network there's your network unless he passed what gene sighs your network and no matter how you mess up once you come back into the presence of God it reconnects to the network because you have been entangled before the username and password has already been put into your soul and that's why the devil fights you to come to church fight you to make it the Promethean fight you to open the world because when you open the scripture because of the sealing your soul there's a password and know you could be inspired and would always read to read the inspired Word of God can the church say man when Samson sinned he broke his connection there was also a connection between Samson's choices his decisions and his consequences Samson was annoying city was blessed he was a Nazarene foul on him but he broke a contract with God he broke a fall with God and no matter how anointed you are how cold you are how inspired you are how set aside you are won't you break the contract with God there will be consequences but within the consequences was also purpose because while Samson was in prison paying for what he did milling at the mill he started to reflect on the connection he used to have he started to think about when he was connected he started to think about when the lion came and he established a connection how power started to flow through him become better Brannon said he wasn't a muscular man he was a small man but when he went but - but when he got connected there was a strength that he couldn't replicate on his own when he left up the kids all he had to do was connect and he can lift up the gate what are you connected to this morning as Samson was led to the pillars without his eyes he saw the possibility that he could be reconnected to court the court has always had some great connections you know what it used to be ever pull something like even good that's something special you know direct connection with God by George when Corliss chocolate Jeremiah and it's very difficult because when you read scripture you have to understand it I don't want to say it like God has favorites but when you look at it is only one man Issei is a man after my own heart who want to get a fight with that you get a fight with that but I was David title you complex with that God is sovereign he give every man his portion you could handle David trials people want David title but it don't want David trials people won't even run but I don't want any problems many are they increase the trouble me many didn't rise up against me many I didn't see of my soul there is no help for him in God is no help with him outside of God but donor shield from me gave his life and character earned him the designation of a man after God's own heart the pain he went through the sacrifices he for the rejection the jealousy the animosity the assassination attempts on his life all of it came together to define his character to be worthy of the title of man after God's own heart and David had a connection with God outside er me he had a connection at all the solace didn't have I was with the lion and I was tending the Sheep and a lion came and I slew the lion I was there with his sheep and I beat him and I stood up here and the connection I have with God if you want me to tickle his Goliath I will take him out nobody else had that testimony because nobody else at that type of connection what is your connection with God but the Branham talked about a time there was an area where there was no water I don't if you remember it and he said that there was this man who came out to pray and he said whenever man he longed to pray you could see this one man was a man who was used to praying he said the moment he started he City new readers gonna come because they noticed my had a connection with God when people see you do didn't know they have a connection with God when the sons of ski four were preaching trying to cast out Devils those Devils say listen Paul I know we know about his connection pizza I know we know what his connection are you connected do you have a connection anybody with me this morning so we see God has different level of connections huh and we read it in the scripture it's parallel he throws the seed on good ground and some bring forth 64 summer 104th why everybody bring a hundred food and how do you think God would treat those who bring for 100 food but listen to this in Jeremiah 15 verse 1 go tell the Prophet Jeremiah that even if Moses and Samuel were to stand before him you know we say I am connected to them brothers I'm connected even if Moses and Samuel were to stand before me his heart would not be with these people so great was their sin so he said them people give so much trouble that even if Moses who he was connected with and Samuel come on plead for them be not sparing them to speak of the level of the connection where George god have a Moses and Samuel in ezekiel 1414 go to Ezekiel that even if Noah Daniel and job were to pray for them people he would Odin deliver know Daniel and job and not delivery people read the Bible because I respect my connection with a member then people give him too much trouble if Noah Daniel and job come together to bring with them to deliver them I will deliver Noah Tournament rope if it is connected but he arrested them in trouble what is your connection with God how connected are you with God but the Branham said God's connection with Joseph in the New Testament Joseph and Mary his connection to the listener prophets were in court hiding himself in simplicity then revealing himself in the same he said and Joseph there's none of somebody Israel the Lord came to him by night saying Joseph you're a son of David don't fear to take unto you Mary your wife for that's nothing bad but that is what the Holy Ghost that settled it that man Joseph with such connection with God till God to speak to him are you working to have such a connection with God that God to speak to you anybody in the house this morning I'm not talking about connected to church collected any message I told being connected with God you may be seated for a minute and people have the audacity to want to define who you're supposed to be connected with if you connected with this church if you're on this hookup which ministry is connected with I don't care about no connection of any ministry I care about one connection I want to be connected with God [Applause] there's no scripture that tells me to connect with any ministry my Bible says I am the vine and you are the branches God made provision for a direct connection direct connection but a tangle a direct connection God has you already socket and you ready to go - nobody taken extra sauce somebody say man you may be seated I tell God I went Calvary to please the veil of partition the veil of separation between the historical priesthood was broken when the veil was rent from top to bottom because before that you had to go through the priesthood but when Christ died he abolished the system of the priesthood and say you can come if you want to come you can connect if you want to connect you can draw power if you want to draw power if you abide in me and my words abide in you you can ask what you will not just a preacher but you can ask what you will and it shall be done we are talking about this - greatest connection and to make it clear believers can unplug themselves you know they get disconnected in the super semi-random said Jehoshaphat was a believer out of connection with his God and you know when people connected and see the decisions because by the fruits you know it is that because you can have no froofy reading scripture it's only through the vine the branch could bring forth fruit so if you are fruit looking like admin G don't blame divine honor blame the connection because the vine is pure divine have no mistake with it divine don't make mistake divine is perfect but he said if a branch air produce the only branches cut off because the connection was right and it's thrown any man carries and burn it but if you start to produce then he pulled you he take it through some more child's or God helped me this morning take it to some more testings so you can bring forth more fruit and he put it to some more tires and some more character development more processing so you bring what much fruit anybody with me this morning so we still creature and how this here we are leave the channel we we still inside a channel hallelujah so we are talking about the currents about connection so there are different kinds of connections there people that want to be connected and Apostle people are collectively Church they've no they do not a doctrinal but this is my choice you go into a war we could have healthy Church they will connect with a prophet they not connectivity message they go to war and they have no connection with God because they had a connection with God they'll behave different because but a brand behave themselves in a way like I said to them I was having a comment I said if this message was the Mafia drive-by shooting every other nail and that's not holy prophet live because the Prophet was connected with God because of the brofist connection with God he could sit down and hear a preacher who didn't have his depth of revelation and he can still support a meetin somebody helped me this morning that's the depth of his connection whatever our day we need to get more connected so good people don't want to shake your hand but when it connected me Cody could shake anybody's hand what did it say what the Prophet you couldn't tell his friends from his enemies because of the quality of his connection with God let's bring it to your house how you talk to your wife speaks to the quality of your connection with God how you speak to your husband speaks of the quality of your connection with God how you talk to your boss on the job even though he's an unbeliever speaks to the quality of your connection with God how do you sweetie a neighbor even if they play music all night long speaks of the quality of your connection with God how your deal reigns I'm gonna give you a bad drive speaks of the quality of your connection with God because the more perfecting connection then the fullness of the life that's in the vine that now flow to the branches and Korra's long to be able to see there's my spirit flowing free freely freely you may be seated for a minute this spirit does move is very moving you know but is it free Ness is what we talked about back angrily because you feel his presence but for the oldest goat-face move freely there has to be nothing blocking any block is never undefined the block is any branches the block is because it agrees he promised he teachings your own belief your own what your thing should be that is very plucking is but once all them things get it upon destroyed and thrown away then the Holy Ghost and the power divine turn our loose loose and then this branch could produce the fruit of faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness even charity the bond of perfectness God help us this phone [Applause] anybody in the house this morning who are you connected with this morning there people who trust their family connections more than connecting with God unn social media new connection requests that's all linking write it you have a new connection request so it's not just you do an external connection if you people trying to connect with you as a youngster starting or sister Anna said yesterday only first thing they want to do - Gary hard is not a lot of people who not your friends not I mean not your family another Fernando meaning they are your so see it's because Jesus say I call you my friends because you keep my Commandments so your friends are those who keep the commandments don't tell me about your school friends and my work friend my friend from how do you become friend because many of us is these external connection that get us in trouble because compromise or compromise or belief compromise or prayer life can the church say man I'm not going to be too much longer with you but his foodie singer this morning I don't know about you but I I eaten it because I want to be so connected and lived through that scripture that he is the vine and we are the branches is we are not the same we are connected we are not the same I'm not divine I'm a branch there's a difference between what the vine can do and what the branch can do the vine cannot produce fruit the vine needs the branches to produce the fruit that's why the Branham said God could only prove his word by believers he needs somebody to work through and God put a clause in there to make sure this happens all the time he said grow will at least have one witness so in every time he always have one with wet just one with this so I believe in my heart I am one so if it's one person on this island I believe it's me do you believe is you you you have to listen if you don't believe in yourself they look at I of Allah you have to know who you are and you can only know who you are by good and check this source that describes what everything is because you have to find yourself in the world you have to find yourself in the scripture Jesus never going to find himself in the scripture when he when I read the Spirit of the Lord is upon me he was fine and what was describing him so he could know his position and he could take his place can the church Shaymin so let me drop in a few quotes I'm already halfway through so we returning only higher a conflict between God and Satan the true bride must be unified or connected same thing you know soul unless please the would with any context the true I must be connected or unified by the wood now remember if she is a part of Christ she has to be the word of Christ in order to be the word of Christ you have to be baptized into Christ and when you in Christ you believe Christ and Christ is to it the bride must be unified the church not the message believers but unified together by the word my sheep hear my voice and this is his voice on printed wood all right you unified by the word she meets herself ready not with the regular Creed like Esther when Esther was to be chosen to stand before the king she did not dawn herself with all the things but she adorned herself with our sweet meek spirit that's what the bride is adorned herself with let that arrogant spirit not abet in a new spirit not we have its spirit because we have nothing unless God gives it he said you cannot do nothing unless the vine does it you have nothing unless the vine giving you strength to do it so you can't claim credit we can't claim credit for anything is the vine as a source the vine is our strength the vine is our inspiration the plan is our power can the church Haman that's what the brides are doing herself with with all of the fruits of the spirit following it so this year you see the type is a branch with the fruit what she's got assembling together in the Fellowship of the word fellowshipping of the wood sitting together in heavenly places in Christ she's just one Accord one place one spirit one mind one hope one chord one purpose Amen see there you are fruits of the spirit what she's got what are the fruit of this pursuit this is what the vine is supposed to be producing in our lives I with me this morning what is the fruit that is where joy joy of a heart knowing that he's coming soon a joy to know he's coming soon and when you see what's happening and I read the scripture for them let me just put it in context because after why they said nothing would surprise you and any seedings happening and when you read the news in the country and different things and want to know what is going on I read this video on people yesterday in Proverbs 4 from verse 14 enter not into the path of the wicked and not in the way of evil men avoid it passed not by it turn from it and pass away listen to this verse verse 16 for the asleep not except they have done mischief so that people who can sleep unless they do mischief and listen to the scripture and they and their sleep is taken away unless they cause some to fall so why are you looking for a good rest when it might come yeah people who can't sleep unless it goes on trouble somebody the caste fellows are going to rob somebody they can't sleep on it look one is when he went to kill and do mischief they could go and sleep and in this world you don't have joy because he's coming soon brother I am so happy that he's coming soon I am so happy that he has a reward for us I am so happy that we are leaving this place I'm so happy that we have a way of escape I am so happy that there's hope for us I am so happy our redemption Troy at night I'm so happy and we gonna lock up Inori time to enjoy at night joy of a heart knowing he's coming soon amen amen yes peace of mind what peace of mind know what no matter what comes or what goes listen to the Prophet let the ship rock let the storms come let the lightning flash the Thunder roar whatever takes place don't make a bit of a difference atomic bombs could fall you can pill Rock shelters bomb shelters whatever you want but she'll still say amen amen amen why she is fortified what fortified and what in the world the world what made flesh dwelling among us watching him move among us in our assembly see ya years so what difference does it made me come let the conflict go on hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I just wanna drop this in here you say here in Jesus and Ananias would so you say you connect to the divine and then you deny his word something wrong he always says Amen to his own you know that assembling for fellowship joy one of the fruits of the spirit like I said if you're law and enjoy skills check your connection you might be any wrong network assembling for fellowship if you have promised assemble for fellowship check your connection joy one of the fruit service with peace of mind and faith in the wood the peace joy feed long-suffering patience gentle and speed what kind of feel what kind of way you use using a fear to fight the conflict are you gonna use your faith and some theory or some reasoning something if the church don't preach every word of that Bible then II meant every word of it believe every time believe everyone the scene I'm working right there and get away from it no matter how big or little it is I am the vine and you are the branches what are you connected to this morning I you so connected to your job now you have no time which is connected to your job you have no time for the kingdom so connected to your job that you have no time to testify to anybody you know where the bottom said if you don't testify you're find yourself back sit in one day so it means that testifying to people is a sign that you are connected because if you end up back sittin it means it is connected so let's make all the right connections it's our responsibility to testify it's our responsibility to encourage these are all evidences if I could say that of being connected to divine divine is not selfish so the branch cannot be selfish divine gave everything and you want to give nothing but because a true branch is connected a True Vine it gives up itself and produces fruit and the fruit is not for your benefit come on now the food is not for your benefit the food is to help others can the church say man sending me along a few things in the message paradox well around said wasn't a strange thing in the days that with King Ahab was king of Judea and of Israel rather Jehoshaphat the righteous man king of Judea how I believer can get connected with a mig believer so very Branham true is message warning us of the kind of connections we will end up with that take them away from connecting with divine sometimes man gets in that kind of a fix today mix themselves up with people who don't believe the word and yet they are bound to them with such ties they they can get all they are free to accept it we have enough horizontal connections we need to get more vertical connection in the seed of discrepancy but the banner cries our God give us man who's the connector is nothing but God honest with that'll tell the truth about it that's exactly what we need and where the Branham goes in to pray and a message he was to pass this way I pray that you will visit each one and give to them the reality that it is to be a real Christian and no matter how much the world tries to discourage us and how much that others try to discourage us let us know that it's a fight to get there it's an effort we have to put forth but when connected with something that's genuine real it changes us then I pray that you will change every heart Lord and make everyone in divine presence at this time but the Holy Spirit in their life to be as much Christian as the mother there was a mother she was born [Music] love the Lord is spawning in the message show us the father and it'll satisfy us and I think of that today brother when Jesus was willing the son of God to come from the ivory palaces of glory down here and take a disgraceful name and humiliate himself in human flesh and be called a Holy Roller or religious fanatic and walk up there and bleed Dyer's a curse on a treat and you ashamed God have mercy on the people have mercy and your shame to connect yourself with his people and the world is falling apart what we need to do is get connected that's all right now get connected with Christ our lives of our emotion the lives of our mind connected to lead to this greatest connection of deere's my spirit flowing freely the restoration of the full word through the Prophet messenger of Malachi 4 made a way for a perfect connection because the word is a conductor of the Spirit so the husband man the Lord Himself sent the prophet to reveal every mystery the tie up the loose ends to give access that the branch could effectively connect with divine imperfection but it has had time not time is this little loop it loops down Jesus was from eternity to eternity but he stepped into the tiny space and was made flesh and come through here in order to sanctify or put a streak of blood all across this place to redeem it and listen to connect it back with God again for all eternity you see it that's all time is what is the Holy Ghost but if Adam said now the Spirit of God has willed under justification under Luther scientific ation on the Wesley the baptism of the Holy Ghost under Pentecost and here it is in the last day performing and doing the same very things that it did when it was in Christ what is it the church and Christ has become one and as soon listen as they connect together that last link she'll go to the sky shorten up will come Wesley Luther and all the rest of them black indoors dear here so where the Branham is speaking of a connection that is yet to come not a connection in the message but the connection between Christ and his bride and when that connection takes place this greatest connection then whew as soon as they connect together soon as it happens but a brand of clothes at that last link there have been many links through the ages where there's a last link and the moment that link takes place the moment a connection takes place up welcome wear sleep I will come loose look I will come with a random I will come the sleeping seats and we leave shouting they will come the resurrection so I'm on expectation for the manifestation of the greatest connection when the head and the body will unite together when Christ will unite with his bride oh what a tea is gonna be and it's close and a hand is closer than you think it's later than you think but the ground said it got to be scared whoa a time of connection now what is it Christ coming to his body crisis who will be all know the anointing is Christ that comes on the wood that makes the wood live is that right that is here north and crisis you know need a spirit that comes upon the wood that quickens the wood to make it live now the word is in your heart you believe in me find healing whatever more see and cry see anointing coming to his body see the connection there just like husband and wife to become one now the church has got to get to the ministry until the church and Christ becomes one not one with the message where the church and Christ becomes one and listen to what happens then he can anoint you for every blessing that's in the Bible all it is yours everything is promised at this age is yours come the church team and hallelujah hallelujah from the message united under one head could he take someone everybody feeling fine united under one hell but if i said well you don't have to be that way Christ died that you might be cleanse from all these things you might be filled with a bunch of Creed's remember you fill with a bunch of your nominations but God don't want you filled with that God be the police in there to put himself in so we talking about he please of the connection now God wants you to be filled with himself what takes place when you filled with God when you fill with God you're filled with the Holy Ghost you're filled with power you're filled with love with joy with peace with long-suffering with goodness with meekness with gentleness with worship you're filled with joy David said my cup runneth over and if David had a cup running over before the Holy Ghost come what would it do now if David's cup could run over before the Holy Ghost come what will they do now oh brother man said you are filled with something and when you're filled with man's ideas if you're filled with churchianity if you're filled with Creed's you're only building yourself a Babylon that's going to fall if you fill yourself up with a muddled world and you can substitute this with connection if you connect with the modern world if you connect with lust if you connect with pride if you can net return you not mention your loss but it's only one way to endure that is to put the original thing that caught me that compartment in your heart to be filled with and that was the Holy Ghost and that's what the devil is afraid of I want the original thing somebody's hid the original thing somebody see the original thing I don't want to substitute I want the same Holy Ghost God made that compartment in your heart to be filled with a specific thing the original Holy Ghost and that's what I want nothing less than the original Holy Ghost that's the connection I want somebody give the Lord a shout of praise hallelujah hallelujah in this great connection you may be seated it's a uniting time it's United with one another it's uniting record it's one body and he's ahead of that one body can the church amen no more divisions no more arguments no more debates but one Holy Spirit pulling together sons and daughters from the east from the west from the north from the south we are not leaving one behind we're not leaving one young person behind we don't even one old person behind we're not leaving one sick person behind we're gonna be here delivered set free transform this glorious wonderful bright body will come interview and make a great connection hallelujah where the random goes on my loving friends may I say this to you tonight God wants us one but he wants us one not under the foolishness of man add not on a man head that under some group not under some great teacher not under some great movement but he wants us one united under the holy God head that's the greatest connection United as one person one man one woman one church one people one view one purpose one motive one objective that Jesus Christ that's the prophets words one thing to serve Him one love the love of God one Brotherhood brotherhood of man one Fellowship of the Holy Ghost ten we are united that's the greatest connection that the world will ever see and it's only intensity we can have the greatest connection that the world will has ever seen whether to become one bone of my bone flesh of my flesh spirit of my spirit come on church somebody say man you may be seated but the Branham did not have luminance of connection one time he said he was standing there and the angel of the Lord came to him didn't even say nothing and moved away he hasn't seen him for six months but I ran in lost you know never five years but they could allow the Prophet to go to all these things but in this day is bright time this is a different kind of relationship this is brightening we talking about bone of my bone flesh of my flesh spirit of my spirit this is the greatest connection this didn't happen in the day of Abraham it didn't happen in the day of Noah it didn't happen today of Moses it didn't happen in the a Joshua but the Planum was looking so much sweat he said I wish I could be there I wish I could see it the see the craters connection when God will unite with his bride Oh Alan and listen you cannot unite record and remain sick you cannot do nightmare called and remain depressed you cannot unite with God and remain backslidden it's impossible light and darkness cannot live in the same house Oh hallelujah all you have need of is in the vine get connectivity all you have need love is in the vine get connected today hallelujah you may be seated one Fellowship of the Holy Ghost 10 we are united one fellowship all these groups in the message God has respect these groups all these churches yes churches are sovereign but this body is one body everybody have to fit into that body people have to adjust to get into that body what people don't know don't understand when that piece of connection comes your understanding will come that's why we can't judge nobody we have to work with what God has given us with the measure of grace don't be upset if my measure is differ among your measure we are trying to get into one body for the greatest connection the devil is 'dom listen you know what the Prophet said is a lack of Revelation is what leads to all these divisions lack of Revelation is will eat all these divisions but if the revelation trap down that we have to be united under one head and it's not no head in no country it's none too ahead of no island it's not ahead and nowhere no I'm the one head the Lord Jesus Christ himself it's been a long time he has wanted to take his place as head of this glorious body are you in this church triumphant are you in the Savior's pride have you been baptized into the body because Christ is king he is the head of the church and he is coming back to lead us into the final showdown you may be seated where the brother said right now we lay hands on the sick right now we pray for the sick but one day when we are connected we will command the devil to leave because Christ will sit on his throne Oh hallelujah he said right now you pray in Jesus name but but even when we are connected there's no praying in Jesus name we speak we speak we speak and it has to happen because it's the greatest connection that the world has ever seen there's no connection like this connection there's no friend like this friend there's no father like this father there's no God like this cord there's no king like this King are you connected this morning oh maybe you have a good connection but I want a better connection maybe you have a better connection but I wonder greatest connection I want the spirit to flow freely I don't want anything to hinder and according able to use every cell but it was in every cell every fiber he said until every cell every fiber is filled with a wonderful glorious baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the greatest connection adoption time when called component to us his fullness his glory his power [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] hallelujah friends you cannot connect the two networks and srinagar the same time you need to choose one choose one Josh petroleum choose you this day whom you will serve choose a connection today and if you choose this connection do it 100% to connect halfway doe connect on sundays alone and to connect midweek alone let this be a Pullman can be a permanent connection and watch your healing come closer make this your permanent connection and watch your family situation begin to change make this your permanent condition and to your body start to get change because a change will happen on the inside and be reflected on the outside piece in the connection that you have somebody say man when this greatest connection takes place wherever I'm said we united then as one we won't fuss no more we were argue no more will act like man will dress like man will dress like women sons and daughters of God our character our conduct our faith will prove oh my you have to tell me you're connected your life will prove what you are connected to your hairstyle proves what you are connected to how you dress proves how you are what you are connected to your prayer life proves what you are connected to your worship proves what you are connected to if you have aught in your heart it proves what you are connected to if there's doubt in your heart it proves what you are connected to but if you are connected to God to take oh then you can forgive then you can love you can let things go then you could break past the sound barrier of your life Lord I'm ready where we have to send me I wanna go whatever you want me to do I'm willing to to tears my spirit flowing freely the greatest connection that the world has ever seen is about to take place this world is shaken groaning travailing for the manifestation of the sons of God there's no manifestation without connection there's no power without connection he said I am the vine you are the branches the moment of vine and the branches getting the perfect connection watch the sign seek please watch the wonders take place and that's why church we are fighting to place the word where it should be because without the word in perfect position the spirit cannot flow freely gotta be part wood can it be our interpretation can it be our idea can be man's idea that's why God sent the Prophet we would have one profitable there's no profit prevalent half some secondary profit some profits of no there's only one messenger we're before the beginning God put seven stars in his hands and they were connected to him forever Paul arenas Latin Columba loser leslie stars and then a great stop so greater when John saw this stop he bow to worship and the stasi I'm just a prophet like you my revelation may have insider you don't have but worship God the Prophet was so connected that the prophet of God back in Abraham's day and described it was a dusty day when these men came walking up to Abraham that buffeted walk and that's how connected he was he can look at this a hottie right and discern and see whatever you asked you could have it that prophet was so connected that he could look there he said one day the Messi will look washed up but I see a bride called I see a bride all somebody help me this morning greatest connection and just think you may be seated the connection that supposed to happen it's never happened before what did I process it a little bit sister Melissa the connection that's about to happen has never happened before what is the first time that people will walk the earth and their bodies will get changed Enoch was one man but in this day it's a whole bunch of people the devil and no what about the air terminal everything determine I got a headache when Jesus died because Jesus said [Applause] if God wanted Jesus gonna finish it ever then and if God wants it but he didn't one that he said listen I didn't need to finish it I can send my wife to finish it I don't even finish it I'm gonna let my bride come and kick you here kick you here but I bounce it is more pointy little finger in this bribe in her little finger but a Branham said you can't make this stuff up but a little finger is more power than auditable as God has confidence in this bribe to defeat cancer God has confidence in this pride the cancer diseases court has confidence in this bride to bring on the resurrection I'm looking for that day I'm looking for that day I'm looking for that day the greatest connection you may be seated I'm trying to close out where we are and even think be this wrong it's a lot more food and all this thing is inexhaustible inner whatever I say I see they approach we become a super Church as we nearly have stole the Mirren is waiting for the connection I know as you're near your super Church imagine when they connect I don't know what you call a church beyond a super church because he's he'll be a super church as an eerie headstone when they connect you beyond super but it was any power base so greatest Wilcock continent if Albert Einstein was here he would say this is different this is not just quantum this yet even a new name for his level of entanglement because the chemical explosion will take place when this bride comes into power you imagine the greatest connection take place and we just have to walk in the hospital rooms if pizza wasn't part of the greatest connection he was part of a great connection because the Alpha Church was just a taste of what the Omega judgment and people were healing Peters shadow brother you walk in from the hospital on your way to work and sick people just get healed people that's what we're talking about listen you may be seated you know in Azusa Street revival that wasn't greatest connection you profit hadn't even come yet and in Azusa Street time people as their bandit corner start to get convicted fell to their knees surrender to God didn't even make it to the building yet and it was a great connection how much were the greatest connection that the world has ever seen when Christ unites with his bride unite with his church give the Lord a shout of praise I'm finished musicians could come [Applause] last few coats position get ready we are united then as one we weren't first no more all this fussing what quote what quote what quote what scripture who writes who are you back said it addressed who only francelina said who ended I said who is disease as a all emphasis born because when Christ unites with this bride it'll speak for itself you don't need to explain it you need to what is it it's fulfilled and you'll see it you will see the signs you see the wonders will act like man I want a pair will act like my not being born me to make you a man you know but this great connection but I say we act like man we'll just like man only when he creeps again I tend to be really just like a man we may not even know what that really means yet but I think that we'll just like man then come on now we'll just like women sons and totally what our character our conduct our faith will proof when court says anything will say Amen to it if the Bible says for us to do certain things we'll do it we won't argue back we just go and do it that's what God wants us United on oh how we ought to act in this present day oh my my my my my last few coats you can really play something softly God will have a church it's not far down the road we will be one our purpose will be one like the Great Temple when it went together there wasn't a buzz of the saw or a sound of a hammer for forty years God's cutting them out of the Methodist Baptist Presbyterian all funny-looking blocks but one of these days the Holy Ghost will come that rejected Cornerstone and the building will go together without a murmur one of these days just exactly that stone that's been rejected is the chief Cornerstone you pillars of these denominations remember that the rejected stone is the chief Cornerstone he is here tonight I believe him whenever Adam said oh how wonderful how glorious I know that he is present oh I wish you felt like I do I know you think I may look too silly but I'm not you may think that I don't the way I am but I do oh it is the spirit of the living god I just can't preach no more there's just something the joy bells of glory has just setting on me I never had it happen like that there's just something I know there's coming a time yes coming something that's gonna take place I see it in the near future the Spirit of the Living God falling fresh on his church there's going to be something take place I hear sound in the mulberry bushes he's talking about the greatest connection something listen to the Prophet something just spoke to my heart and said fear not preacher look how God give joy and comfort to his prophet not preacher there'll be one one of these days they'll believe it made keep persecution and things to drive us together but God will drive his church together just as certain as I'm standing in this pulpit on the one that's Christ Christ will be the head nor denomination will be the head Christ will be the head of every believer but the venom goes on I want to unite under his power I want to unite with you men and women tonight under his power that said retirin united under one head God one leadership Holy Ghost one purpose the
