before I bring my greetings let's stand to let's let me read my scriptures um if you have a bibl like to invite attention to Genesis chter 1 and uh Revelation 12 and Leviticus 23 Genesis CH 1 I read verse 2 through verse 5 and that's where I get my child from this morning Jes chter 1 um I begin to read from verse two and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day and that's where my ttle is from my title and the evening and the morning were the first day amen let's go right back to Revelation from Genesis right down to Rev ation 12 and this speaking about the war in heaven I read verse 7 through: 11 and you have a marker you can go to Leviticus 23 verse 33-36 Revelation 12 I read from verse 7 and there was one in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was the place for any more in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceived the whole world he was casted into the Earth and his angels were casted with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of am and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death amen finally our them scripture for the convention Leviticus chapter 23 verse 33 through: 36 and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel saying the 15th day of this seventh month shall be the Feast of Tabernacles for seven days unto the Lord on the first day shall be an holy convocation ye shall do no sval walk therein seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord on the Eighth Day shall be an holy convocation unto you and you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord it is Solem assembly and he shall do no S Walk therein amen may the Lord add his BL the reading of his holy words amen

PowerPoint and I'll get it there and I'll just I'll just be like brother Peter you know so but it didn't quite work out for me brother roblo I think said yes they was trying to get the thing and said this is not working so he left it so it didn't quite work out for me so um because we were asking ask me for my entitle and all that I feel I'll have that on the power point but didn't I work so I had in some rough sheets and things like that so but Peter I need to take some tutorials okay brother ID has been trying to convert me from this paperwork to this technology thing for years so you might have a very tough student on your hands but that was really tremendous brother Peter it was representation it was outstanding outstanding outstanding and our folks in Lagos many of them saw but they played that in church this morning for our morning service I understand the whole church was blown apart and they want their feet throughout for the tremendous blessing of the message and the quotes you had I mean he set a tone for the convention want P CH God bless you we're together again God bless brother CH amen amen and and brother Isaac brother Isaac the spare tire I told Isaac that you know for a very well tuned car many times the spare tire is in a speak and span shape the spare tire many times is better than the real tire and that was what happened on Friday night brother is that was tremendous that was that was outstanding I was telling my wife brother Isaac is a real asset to brother brother Theo really I mean both as a son and as a cooworker in church assistant pastor because you can get him in anytime if you want to get me in to do a service that's not my service you're not going to get me to do it so I was thinking brother Johnny was going to but brother as you

brother brother JC thank you so very much and last night brother Raymond Thompson Brother Ray amen be seated brother R I'm sorry I I I missed that spot you know I remember the last time we were together you know in I Coast when brother R got the prop I I want brother R sleeves rolled up ready for a battle you want to fight Satan Elohim is ready God's son is ready so I like to see when he rolls up those sleeves and I always miss it when we a when he was run on the is told me that's the time so so I I saw it that time so I wish I stood by Isaac last night and I felt I'm going to know when mother R is going to P obviously but I get so distracted I was writing my my title and all that and before I look that the S were already rolled up but that was tremendous last night of the r that was absolutely outstanding absolutely outstanding um um um I mean it's so strange that we've come so quickly to the last day of the convention and um they've been telling me and brother the journey yesterday that Sunday is coming Sunday's coming coming so it's Sunday now so I'm telling brother Johnny Sunday night is [Applause] coming I'm telling brother Johnny Sunday night is coming so brother brother J thank you for that clip Sunday is coming so we are here on Sunday and Sunday means a resurrection to us Sunday means Victory Sunday means Deliverance Sunday means you can face any challenge Sunday means a brand new today Sunday means the son is here amen thank God for Sunday amen God richly bless you amen so this morning amen I just want to put my sh at the wheel and say a few words out of the scriptures and my title again I said is and the evening and the morning were the first day and we've been in the meetings and we've heard a lot about the E day holy convocation and brother brother oid you know told us how that came to him pure inspiration he didn't even think of he not a subject he's studied so long but God said it the holy convocation and brother Peter Chandler picked up and set us on the right path and everybody's been in the meeting and I'm sure like you are thankful to God you are in this convocation now what is the convocation I mean in Nigeria and in in the um I don't know about outside of Africa but in West Africa generally when universities and colleges do their degree award programs they call it like a convocation like a convocation is a an assembly a large where a lot of people gather and maybe Awards and rewards are going to be given out where people are gathered together I know the Americans call commencement ceremonies I don't know what they call it here but that's a convocation where people are gathered together is a coming together of people and this is a holy convocation and it's an eighth day holy convocation so it's a bit specific now what happens in a convocation the Bible lets us know that the Bible lets us see that lus 23 we read Let's us see what happens in a convocation and follow me this morning H uh uh the preacher already preached the word so uh I'm just trying to you know add my I put my should to the wheel so um brother J said he's a long oneing preacher I don't think you can take that title from me brother Jesse don't even try don't try I'm long and whiny sometimes I wonder brother ol what is wrong with you what are you even saying so I just pray for me that I don't I don't end up being long windy today but I'll try I'll try but you know what happens in a convocation when you know what happens in convocation then we know what we are looking for here we know what we're supposed to be what we're supposed to be looking for here and we can with boldness go for it amen in the convocation from every because I just try to you know uh uh uh uh see as I go along what happen is the convocation God told Moses get the people together 15th day of the seventh month I think the first month is April so this will be like the 15th of October uh uh which was which is the 7eventh month and get the people together for an assembly and 7 days they will have this assembly and on the eighth day he said the first day will be a holy convocation to you and you shall do no server work therein is not a suggestion is not an idea it's a command you shall do no s work they are in amen and every single day of those H uh seven days the first day and then add seven more days you shall have h a holy convocation amen and then on the eighth day will be similar to the first day and on that Eighth Day he added some more instructions to it he said you do no Ser work but he also said amen it's a solemn assembly now this is Solemn not as in morning is in Solem as in serious am is in Solem as in is not a place to take don't take it lightly don't take this assembly lightly we are here for for serious business we're not here it's not a Solem assembly like somebody has died and we are M no it's a serious assembly we're not playing no games here that's why we call this assembly glory to God Amen can I take up my jacket H glory to God amen amen you may be seated amen so he said he said he a solemn assembly number one number two he said You shall offer an offering unto the Lord is one thing to offer an offering but he qualified the offering he said You shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord can somebody shout hallelujah hallelujah like brother said but said can I have a shout in the house can I I can hear you can I have a shout in the house amen you may be seated an offering made by fire amen we put some fire under the offering amen amen glory to God Amen you may be seated when you offer an offering and put some f it that makes it a sacrifice amen and you know the only person that offers a sacrifice to the Lord is a priest amen so in this holy convocation here you come here with a recognition that you are a preach unto the Lord to have your offering your sacrifice to offer to God hallelujah glory to God amen amen come on you priest of the Lord amen you may be seated amen amen now let's talk a little bit about this let's talk a little bit about this priesthood let's talk about about this priesthood here because you know a priest offers a sacrifice unto the Lord so when God says each one of the household of Israel and each one of us here will offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord is a recognition that we are priest unto the Lord and doesn't the Bible say we are Kings and Priests unto the Lord and we shall rign on the earth so something letting you understand are we run about that time tell me letting you understand this is what is this what this holy convention is about to tell me to get up my aship you are a priest unto the Lord you are a king unto the Lord you got power you got Authority you got Dominion that's what God told Mo to tell the people get out of your Ash get off your morning spots Hallelujah stand on your feet you are going to offer an offering made by fire you are a priest come on you priest of the Lord hallelujah glory glory to God amen amen amen you may be seated Hallelujah and then every priest is known by the offering or sacrifice he offerers now Jesus Christ Our Lord is called the high priest of our confession in other words what he offers to God is our confession he takes our confession and offer it to God that's how he becomes the high priest of our confession whatever we confess he offers it to God and the high priest makes sure to make sure he makes sure we get whatever we confess Hallelujah so in this holy convocation here you are going to get what you [Music] confess your confession is your sacrifice your confession is your sacrifice and whatsoever you confess the high priest stands there to offer it to God God hallelujah and that's why in this only convocation here there's no negative talk like brother R was telling last night there's no weakness there's no I can there's no this not working out no sirar whatsoever you confess the high priest takes it to the Lord be careful be careful what you say because your high priest is just going to make sure you get what you what you asked for amen hallelujah hallelujah so this holy conation here the high priest God is making sure our speech is going to change our atud is going to change everything is going to change we're going to defy everything else where there is weakness if you say Lord I'm so weak everything is so going wrong for me that's your confession that's your sacrifice you are bringing and that's what the high priest takes to the Lord be careful now because the high priest says As You Are said in my ears so will I do unto you amen hallelujah a holy convocation Oh Glory to God amen amen amen amen amen oh brother Joy good to see you haven't seen a long time we're still catching Fellowship we had some little Fellowship but we still catching Fellowship but you appreciate Joy leing songs amen amen I was telling him I was privileged to see you know when he l s the first time as a 15y old I think it was you know and he's remain he remained faithful in the house of God ever since amen so anyway so this holy convocation here those four things are supposed to happen a gathering together of the people because it's assembly Sodom assembly is a serious hour not for people who are not made up in their mind to go not for people who are you know just loding around and LLY gagging around or not for people who you have to tell them come on don't see what's going on no God tell Mo would tell the people that and God himself made sure that each person not Moses going around each person he was to

Bible said they shall build houses they shall inhabit amen amen but in the new Earth he has already went and prepared the place is built we have nothing to do with the building of it amen Eternal oh I just love that word my holy convocation the eighth day which is only seven days how do you have seven days and you are talking about eight days how do you have seven days and you're talking about an eighth day holy convocation when God hangs around like that it means is hiding something from Satan but in that hidden thing is a revelation to you and I and that's why he sent us a Prophet The

that's the Millennium the rest day as God labor six days rest of the seventh the church labor 6 days and rest the seventh but you are still in time alement I ain't speaking of the Eternal brother brandham said but you see there's no such a thing as eight days you don't have day number eight goes back to the first day again see the first day the Sabbath speaks of the Old Law which was to pass away the keeping of a Sabbath which passed away amen Isaiah the 19th Chapter said I believe 289 precept must be upon precept here a little and there a little hold fast to thou was good for which ton lips and all the tongues will I speak to this people and here is the rest you enter into life not keeping a day or Shadow Paul said over here in Hebrews chap 4 you keep days and Shadow TS and things

8 days is New Creation for it was on the eth day that the Lord raised from the dead now watch about man he show you the day and trying to show you the eth day in scripture The Eighth Day in scripture so you'll know what he's talking about oh so you will begin to understand when he says you are not a creature of time you are a creature of Eternity brother raise the last that's why the Holy Spirit dropped down when he said you got an eternal quality to you you got thisit of paper and you you it has a value you put on the ground squash it around still the same value because he has an eternal

man came to the Earth and he felluah a little lamb shed his blood that spoke of the great lamb was coming to shed his blood Calvary raised the cross that tied to the Old Testament to them who justify were looking for it amen and in this new dispensation are the coming of the Lord as the new Earth the Rope of Salvation the blood the redeemed path I'm talking about and through the same system has both man and the Earth will raise right up into eternity again and the Lake of Fire will consume everything that's ungodly and unate to it do you see it nor is the Eighth Day Jesus rais for sanctification the Eternal King with the Eternal Kingdom to be baptized into to eternal life not seven days had not do with any of the days is speaking of another Eternal coming speaking of an eternal time the world that I'm speaking of and notice after 50 days or seven sabbaths from there again there come another holy convocation what happened the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost a holy convocation on the seventh day or E day rather fell on the eighth day was seven sabbaths later and his resurrection after his resurrection and so it's been seven times that again bring it right back around to the first day of the week again there is your holy convocation not have anything to do with the literal things it's beyond the literal it's beyond the natural it's beyond time it's into the kingdom of God with eternal life with the predestinated that never did begin it never started in any day you wasn't saved on any day you was always saved Jesus come Jesus just come to redeem that amen but you was saved from the beginning because you had eternal life to begin with can the people say amen oh Hallelujah there's another holy time coming amen you may be seated and the prophet to get right back to Eden Let's Get Right Back to Eden let's follow this holy convocation here God come down in Eden created the world number one day one let there be light and there was light and God saw that it was good and God took the light and separated the light from the darkness amen amen and call the light day and the Darkness night and the evening and the morning for the first day normally here we are today we start the day with the morning first and then we end the day in the evening time but in God's order here he's changing it all through Genesis the evening and the morning for the first day amen that's going to show you the power that that's lad in a holy convocation when we come to church every single time you are in a holy convocation amen glory to God amen hallelujah hallelujah amen so in Genesis 1 God began the creation and number two day two he created Tom more and then he said the evening and the morning were the second day and all the way down to the sixth day the evening and the morning were the fourth day the fourth day the fifth day the sixth day and on day number seven the Bible say God rested on number seven and we don't hear any more about that we don't hear what happened to Adam Adam was created on the sixth day that's right what happened to him did he stay in the sixth day did he go into the seventh day or what happened here's what happened here glory to God Amen because he said the first day and the eighth day are the same thing the eighth day goes back to the first day so if you don't understand my title that first day there is the first display of on the face of the Earth of what the holy convocation represents because the holy convocation is eternal but eternity Dro down into time and begin to unfold and unveil this great holy convocation to you and I and the first day which is like the eighth day which is eternity shows us what the holy commission is all about we'll get to it in a minute amen glory to God Amen are you

the only conation is eternal not on the earth here he come down and 1 2 3 4 5 67 he unfolded unveiled and unfolded progressively what this holy convention was about and we find out is a power in the holy conation is a creative power is a creative Force to come on the face of the Earth remember the Earth was that form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and in the midst of all that in that condition is where God come right down to declare a holy convocation on the face of this Earth here this earth started out with a holy convocation and we are going out just the same way and no devil is going to be able to stop it Hallelujah and you are going to be in that Holy convocation oh that's right oh yeah oh yeah you may be seated glory to God [Music] Amen Adam was created on day number six notice in Genesis 1 like Scofield says three Creations mentioned here because anti the liian war we know about all of that but when God come down let there be light he created the heavens and the Earth number two he created Animal I mean he created you know plant life and sea life and number three he created human life it was a creative force it was a power am that come on the face of the Earth to declare this holy [Music] convocation Hallelujah so when Adam when Adam was leaving in the Garden of Eden and walking around the G what day was he living in Adam was born on Adam was created on the sixth day right and God on the seventh day rested so what Adam in the seventh day or what day was he in because after day number seven God didn't see anymore because God is the Eternal here's the here's the understanding here here's the Revelation here from whatam said not me bringing the revelation to bring reveal all the Mysteries the revelations that's been brother bam reveal the Mysteries amen every mystery has already been revealed no new cut no new Mysteries amen amen but here's the understanding coming from Brother Ben's words the seventh day in Eden was still time so when God rested on the seventh day it was still in time and God doesn't live in time what is the Revelation here day number seven number seven the rest on day number seven is your passageway is your bridge between number six and number eight that's what Bridges you over into eternity God was showing Adam you've got to enter into my rest and when you enter into my rest you break into that Eighth Day holy convocation when you break into that day conation you are on this out here but you are Eternal brother Rachel last you got an eternal quality to you and that's why for every young man every young woman you can't rest until the pass of the Holy Ghost and Fire Burns into your soul Hallelujah God wants to give you the Holy Ghost more than you desire to have the Holy Ghost you may be seated [Applause] so like God Adam found rest and by that rest he entered into the Eighth Day and live in eternity So Adam was in Eden living in the eighth day he lived in eternity in Eden yes Heaven dropped down the Eternal dropped down in Eden Adam wasn't living the seventh day in Eden he was living in eternity he was in the convocation Glory GL with God and all nature he was right there amen Heaven the Eternal was reigning in the Affairs of men on the face of the Earth and there is your holy convocation Oh Glory to God amen hallelujah amen amen amen Come With Me Now a 100 million years to that

Day holy congregation that Adam lived in in Eden amen and am mat Son of God display the power and authority of Heaven on the face of the Earth and God come down and created and unveiled this holy

all things work together for good to them that love God who are the call according to his purpose let me keep a top of my time here I'm doing very well all right for whom he did for know he also did predestinate watch those words now whom he did for know them he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren the firstborn among many Brethren the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he he predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified they may also glorified in those two verses we find the whole gospel story amen you may rece it please let's Goose a little bit here Amen in those two verses amen we find for knowledge we find election we find predestination we find Destiny and brother bham said for knowledge looks back to I mean election looks back to for knowledge and predestination looks forward to Destiny and this scripture here is very common scripture very popular script for us explains it all to you and I amen amen I'm going to show you in a minute just what it's all about Romans 8:29 for whom it it for no from for whom it it for no uh um uh uh uh um he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many bre So What comes forth is the for knowledge is What comes forth Elohim dwelling all alone by himself we always talk about the back part of elohim's mind the back part of elohim's mind and if there's a back part there's a front part doesn't that make sense can you say Amen can I get a shout in the house if there's a back part there is a front PA now on the back part of H mind was his attributes his being who he is that was the person of Elohim that was thought the thinking that was Spirit on the back part of his mind but in the front part that's where the fall knowledge is the for knowledge the know the prior knowledge tell the knowing before it happens amen oh yes good amen and the full knowledge of Elohim if he was God he had to know the beginning from the end he had to know it all before it ever happened at all amen amen amen election looks back to for knowledge the for knowledge comes first and in the for knowledge Elohim knew everything the for knowledge was not him the back part was him the for was just his knowledge of what was going to be on the face of the Earth from Eden Right Back to Eden again in there in the for knowledge he knew what was going to be he knew every life that will be on the face of the Earth like he knew every fly and how many times will B its eye he knew everything he knew every serpent every seed every body that will be on the face of the Earth like brother R told Isaac yesterday he knew brother Paul wasn't going to be here and as was going to take his place in the full knowledge he knew everything in the for knowledge he knew every sin every filth every ungodliness that will ever take place on the face of the Earth in the for knowledge so you know the for knowledge is not him that's not his thinking just what he [Applause] knows no you didn't hear me you may be seated you didn't hear me Glory you did not hear me you may be seated Hallelujah the for knowledge when God told Adam have you ever thought God told Adam be fruitful and multiply Adam was an amateure God on the face of the Earth he was ruling this Earth in the place of God himself yet when Adam sinned and fell God said when he drove the man out he said let the man put forth his hand and take us of the tree of life and become as one of us knowing good and evil now Lord come on now I thought you said Adam was an amateur God Like You on the face of the Earth so how come God saying let the man come and become like one of us knowing good and evil is that for knowledge part that for knowledge that's where the problem that's where your problem is that's where your problem is that's where my problem is that's where the problem of the human race is that's what the fall got us into to know good and evil am to try to become God when we are not when we haven't gone through the processes to know how to handle good and evil and God kept Adam from it because to before he will get back again he had to go through a process a stage a tutoring a child training before he will become like God again on the face of the Earth Hallelujah glory to [Applause] God hallu but the for knowledge that's where the problem is at you may be see and that's where the devil deceives many many young people in particular but also older folks like me like our dads and moms the F knowledge that's not you the for knowledge wasn't God the back path was God that's where you were hidden that's where your thought your Gene your representation by prestation in Elohim was in the back part of his [Applause] mind but the for knowledge God knew everything that will happen brother said he knew who will receive it and who would not receive it the Bible say forever oh Lord that word is settled in heaven God looked all the way down and saw you and I 2017 and know will be here by his for knowledge he knew all the sin that will be taking place in part of Spain in London New York free Town everywhere all over the face of this Earth here that will be taking place at this present moment God knew all that but KN will be here in an the holy convocation God knew who will receive it his full knowledge knew that [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah 1 Peter 1 12 says elect according to the for knowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace be multiplied wow glory to God Amen so God saw you and I struggling but he saw we will receive it amen and what did he do what did he do God reached way down into 2015 2016 2017 or whenever it was and pulled you from that for knowledge PA and put you right into the election he reach out and pulls you right to the back part of his mind the for knowledge is the record of all life that will be on the face of the Earth here is the record of the good and the bad is the knowledge of the good and the evil that will be on the face of the Earth hallah but the back part is the Tree of Life the back part is is only the good God pure thoughts from before the fish of the world but the for knowledge is the good and the evil and the ugly and the bad and God saw you receive it he reach way down and pull you from there and put you on the back part of his mind and put your name put your name in that Eternal section on the back part of his mind H Hallelujah so you might come here and you have a front pth like the woman caught in the very Act of adultery like the woman of the well she had a front pth but she also had a back path because Elohim had seen her that she was going to receive it that when the Messiah would say go call your husband she will say I have none and he will say ither speak unto you I am the Messiah and she will say come come see a man he knew she would receive it and he took her reached out and took her from that for knowledge path and put her to the back part of his mind and the back path canel out the front path and no devil who can lay anything to the chge of God's elect that's the power in election that's the power in your election Elohim already saw you that you are not going to reject it you are going to receive it and he had enough power enough authority to reach down and take you out of your prostitution take out your drugs and put you on the back part of his mind who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect is God that justified you never did the first place never did the first place Glory [Applause] Glory h [Applause] amen seated the story hasn't ended yet we are trying to see how this holy convocation the original one took place those we trying to see you may be seated for whom it for know and elected them he forew you you were going to receive it he took you no matter what had you bound no no matter what Spirit had you bound the power of election Reen and pull you out of it and cancel out canceled out that life all the record in The Book of Life the record of your record of Good and Evil he cancel it out and put in the blood section where you never did in the first place where no devil can accuse you he sees you through the blood who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect that's the election he took you and put you on the back of his mind let the devil try to follow you there he can't even do it he cannot do it there's a power in your election what shall we then say hallelujah for I am persuad neither death nor life nor things present can take us away from the love of God that already chose us and elected Us in him before the found of the world that's why we are here that's why we have no fear you already made it you have no fear you are not going to be lost your little babies your little boys and girls might be wondering right now The Blood Hound is after them The Blood Hound is after them brother I read to you last night the Holy Spirit follows the blood from the book of redemption the book of Redemption on the back part of his mind [Applause] Hallelujah you may be SE that let me make sure you understand this the for knowledge God's knowledge for knowing before prior knowledge it was a record that's right a record of life God values life so every life on the face of the Earth had the record in there of the good and the bad that's why Adam when he got that the devil got into that sphere he can handle the good and bad cannot handle it even with the power of election we struggle with handling the good and the bad see that brother is bad that sister oh forget it I can't even stand her oh that church oh come on I want to have you go to church there that's the knowledge of the good and the evil and the Bible says for God be therefore perfect in Matthew 5 as your father in Heaven is perfect for he makes his son to shine on the just and the unjust on the good and the evil glory to God amen amen but El is not finished yet you may be seated so when he took from that record of that life your record of life that's the record the Bible said the books were open and every man was judged out of the things WR in the books the records is a record of life every life on the face of the Earth they're going to be Jud out of those things that they did because their works are going to follow them but you he took you from that and put you on the Eternal section where there's another book another book The lamp's Book of [Applause] Life which is Written in Blood where your name can never be taken out where it was there eternally where God's for knowledge elected you and the your record in the Book of Life cancels out your record in the regular Book of Life oh Hallelujah can somebody shout hallelujah hallelujah can somebody shout amen oh Hallelujah you may remember and remember some of the things that I done in the front path but Jesus with special love forgive me of every one of them oh I was guilty all so long but Jesus dropped the charges because a power of election took me and put me and wrote my name in the Lamb's Book of Life in the Eternal section never to be erased no more that's where you are oh Hallelujah and that's where we are going to have this original holy convocation oh come on now get ready for it get ready for it there's going to be a shot in heaven shortly get ready for it God is getting sons of God from different ages Paul's said put

mind amen am and whom he justified Hallelujah them he also glorified thank you Jesus what does that mean when he elected you and put you on his backp in the Lamb's Book of Life he called you Justified you cleansed you 1 Peter 1 says called elect according to forge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ amen Grace unto you and peace be multiplied so when he pull you on the back of his mind the blood of Jesus Christ cleansed you called you Sanctified you on the back part of his mind because on the back part is all good and no evil no filth no sin there so he took you and put you there and clean you up before the walls ever were formed [Music] oh that's the record of you in Elohim that's the record of you in Elohim Oh Glory to God amen aen amen moreover whom he did for No One elect amen he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren be confirmed hello playing with with words in the English language be conformed become formed into the image of his son on the back of elohim's mind so elohim's record of you you have already been formed into the image of his son that's a record of you when you say my name is written there that's what it means your name is written there standing there in the Statue of a perfect man Hallelujah and the devil is jealous of you this was the Eighth Day Eternal [Applause] eternity oh man let me just talk here let me leave these notes [Music] Here I know what happened Elohim had these all sealed up before the walls were ever from on the back part of man there was safe already predestinated called Sanctified cleaning blood no sin can stay on you Hallelujah no sin can stay on you because on the back pad of his mind and then hallelujah confirm the image of his son standing there just like his son that he might be the firstborn Jesus Christ the ghost the world among many Brethren Hallelujah when that was done what would happen Elohim un morit and become the logos my God Amen and began the work of creation already da decided first created was angels and you were there watching all that created angels you saw this creative power this creative Force created angels to worship him and you were there and Lucifer was there too he was created you saw him created amen hallelujah and you were there Amen on the sides of the north you were there amen right in the logos BU as a seed a word seed a little button of life in the logos Amen in the beginning because you bass your theophany but there you are in the theophany spirit what body and began the work of creation creation created angels and Angel began to worship him for eons and eons of time they worship him and you were there amen it's not pre-existence there's a little seed in the logos but there Angels represent you that's where your representation was like brother CH read condemnation by representation same way representation by predestination it was a predestination not pre-existence but you are represented there Angels represented you there you were in the logos your soul and Angels represented your spirit in the beginning Hallelujah God got this thing finished before we ever come here totally finished and there you were there you were you are there in the lust you are there in the body of Christ you are there in the body of the lust you are there in the word and Angels representing your spirit and here's where I want to show you something glory and Lucifer was jealous you may be seated you may be seated Lucifer was jealous how could he have such a lofty position and still be [Applause] jealous but was jealous yes I don't have to go in all that was Revelation 12 I didn't read vers 1 to3 the woman was traveling child to bring for the Manchild he was jealous of the Manchild who is this child that's also a man who is this child also a man he was jealous amen cuz he's like a baby good jealousy and feeling bad nonsense feel like a baby but see this child is like a man so he had his plans and this where going to see the different parts of the book of life and going to see that Elohim kept you [Applause] there in that Eternal section in that Lamb's Book of Life and what happened Lucifer F Jesus he went r r heav with his tail like brother BR said tail t a l e God play with what's an English language t a i l t a l playing with words when we tail to tell tales on God and got someu to believe and the Bible said he deceived it's a deception you know what you never did in the first place even Paul said Paul said Paul said Hallelujah Paul said Paul said that if I do therefore that which I don't want to do is that is not longer I that do it he said but sin that deceived [Music] me sin that's working in my members it was responsible amen amen come on now but when you have a knowledge and an understanding of the book from the back part of elohim's mind your mind is enlightened and the devil can deceive you no more Adam wasn't deceived so you can get the spot where he can deceive you no more so anyway he went around and gossip soric acid in the church against this one against the one against this one against that one we're getting ready for this holy convocation and the devil is going around there and start a war in heaven a war in the church up in heaven and it FR and Michael representing Jesus Christ wouldn't stand for the lust wouldn't stand for it he didn't start the fight we don't start a fight but we never run from a fight no we never run from a fight Hallelujah and Michael for and Lucifer Ford and Michael for and FR long story short over seven Church ages this war went on and at the end of the war what happened one third of the Angels were deceived by Lucifer and Michael said I won't have this here he threw them out of Heaven kick them out of [Applause] Heaven God that's the power in the Kingdom kick him out so you have the power to kick him out of your your life so what happened what happened one thought was kicked out of heaven and there remain two thoughts a revelation there one thir two thoughts means there are three groups here that's what it means means there are three groups here one group was kicked out all right and one group was from the back part there's this other group here we don't know where they're coming from brother bham said there are four parts to the Book of Life one part is not even written at all because forever oh Lord the word is set in heaven all that happened in the beginning when Elohim UNM into the logos and created angels all throughout that's all that has been happening on the face of the Earth it was previewed before the foundation of the world and that's what has been happening and God preved it there the fourth group serpent said God has nothing to do with them their record is not there at all but this is the four knowledge playing out now and in this for knowledge here every life is there except the serpent seed you are there those who are kicked out are there and there this other mysterious group also is there amen so there are three groups there he had seen you and Tak you out of there and put you on the back part of his mind so you're one group other group stood with Lucifer and they were kicked out that's like the borderline Believers but land believers who almost come in almost come in and the cares of Life they got deceived like Judas come to the borders and back off Hallelujah but there's this other groupall who was not deceived they are not from the back part of elohim's mind but they were not deceived who are they they the foolish virgins the foolish virgins they are not they are not elected to be in the bride so they're not from the backpacked that's right but it didn't take Sid of Lucifer religious Christian people good people good people they didn't get kicked out they didn't take their names out of the book Pentecostal people deceived by you know or Roberts and these other different Pentecostal groups and you know we have many of them in Nigeria I don't know here so many of them know who have been taught to believe that they can live worldly and still have Jesus who have been taught to believe that they love God in their hearts they s with God but they are not predestinated to be in the bride the foolish virgins and will take a chance at the great white Throne judgment to enter into life Hallelujah and another group also there is the Matthew 25 group they are also did not take sight they formed this second group mysterious group that wasn't kicked out that was not the [Applause] bride there they were the foolish virgins religious people another group amen Matthew 25 the Sheep Nations who do good things to the bride who are going to receive eternal life because their goodness to the people of godj and then also the 144,000 form part of this group here that's all that's going to be that's the second group right they didn't take size with Lucifer but they were not predated to being the bride these good people do things that the people in the Brad are supposed to do but they will never do people in the message rather are supposed to will never do Hallelujah so what do you have three groups the bride the foolish virgins group and the borderline Believers the Bine Believers were kicked out so you have the two thirs the bright the foolish virgins Hallelujah that stood with Michael Oh Glory Hallelujah glory to God Amen and whener was kicked out of heaven Elohim was done hallelujah then now the book of life could be written and expressed and after the war in heaven The Book of Life was written and expressed and forever oh Lord that word is settled and written and expressed in heaven Oh Glory to God Amen and there there you saw the Bride of God Lucifer kicked out saw the Capone C up the of their lives saw them grown into the image of the Son of God hallelujah there was a shout in heaven a shout of Victory like never before and that's where the first holy convocation took place that's that where the eternity holy convocation took place it was it was celebrating a victory he was celebrating a Deliverance he was celebrating a victory over Satan over Lucifer and all his works oh glory to God amen amen amen oh brother brother amen Oh Glory so what happened now what happened now the power that cast Lucifer out is the same power that came down on day one I said let there be light there was Darkness repres like Lucifer again let there be light and there was light and that power separated the light from the darkness they can't coexist together in a holy convocation Darkness cannot coexist with light in a holy convocation the sin and the debuchy cannot live in your life they cannot do it amen the power of God will run through your life and the devil cannot stand it the devil cannot stand in the picture he not even in the picture oh hallelujah what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us you answer that for yourself Lucifer could not do it no devil is going to be able to do it oh Hallelujah so you know what happened in heaven you never did it you never did it he tried to get you to be on his side you never did it Hallelujah so how can you do it here but when you come on the face of the Earth in your day and in your age the ignorance your front path your front path is what people are looking at that's what you are looking at yourself but Elohim is not looking at that Elohim knows you did not stand with Lucifer Elohim knows Lucifer could not deceive you Elohim knows your future is already history Elohim knows you have already been formed into the word image of the Son of God Elohim knows that Elohim knows you are loaded with power and time holy ghost power and no devil can stand before you Elohim knows that and that's why he call a holy convocation for you to know that and experience that yourself so what do we find friends you may be see as I'm closing out here glory to God amen glory to God amen amen amen glory hallelujah hallelujah oh my Hallelujah try to show you what happened in eternity which is day [Music] number8 that's what day number one represents and that's what Adam was living in the Garden of Eden the number eight represent an authority a power over Lucifer over everything that confronts and challenges a power and authority a confession amen amen glory to God amen amen no saal work no slave work no prison Bears amen the devil tried to bring it those who are in prison with him were kicked out with him but those who are in that Holy Commission in heaven no prison bears oh glory to God Amen and so we come on the face of the Earth that's our history before God we come on the face of with a front path and we go from here from here from there wearing drugs wear PR wear whatever all whatever it is and they take a look at us and say oh this person here well God knows and one day he catches you pulls you into enal section just like he did before Hallelujah and here you in church Hallelujah and the devil like he did in the Garden of Eden even though Adam lived in eternity in Eden the devil still comes to try to introduce sin there and that's what he does with you and sin is a deception you don't want sin no you don't want sin you don't want the FI you don't want the ungodliness is a Deceiver sin deceived you Romans 7 says how does it deceive you through your emotions let me give you an example I say that brother is a very stupid boy and you feel bad at me do the words hurt you no but you feel bad because your emotions are hurt emotions are hurt husband's hotter the wife wife's hotter the husband Brothers hotter brothers sisters hotter sister sister that's his deception the emotions deceiving you that you are hurt you are not hurt because on the back part of elohim's mind is only good and that's where you come from oh Hallelujah so what are we saying here you never did the first place so here we are the holy spirit is dropping upon us to bring us to the spot on the face of this Earth here to where truly yes we will never do it in the first place Hallelujah glory to God Amen
