[15:18] to turn to sin mark chapter 11.
[15:20] we want to read from verse 11 to 26
[15:24] o praise the lord
[15:33] and jesus entered into jerusalem and
[15:35] into the temple
[15:37] and when he had looked around about upon
[15:39] all things and how the even tag was come
[15:43] he went out onto bethany with the twelve
[15:46] and the tomorrow when they were come
[15:48] from bethany
[15:49] he was hungry the scene of victory of
[15:52] fire all having leaves he came
[15:54] if happily he might find anything
[15:55] thereon but when he came to it he found
[15:57] nothing
[15:58] but leaves for the time of the figs was
[16:01] not yet
[16:03] and jesus answered and said until no man
[16:06] eat food from the
[16:08] hereafter forever and the disciples
[16:11] heard it
[16:12] and they come to jerusalem and jesus
[16:14] went into the temple and began to
[16:16] cast out them that sold and bought in
[16:19] the temple
[16:20] and overthrew the tables of the money
[16:24] changers
[16:25] and the seats of them that soul does and
[16:28] would not suffer that any man should
[16:30] carry any vessel
[16:32] to the temple amen and he taught saying
[16:35] unto them
[16:37] is it not written my house shall be
[16:39] called of all nations the house of
[16:41] prayer
[16:42] but you have made it a den of thieves
[16:45] and the scribe when the chief priest
[16:47] heard it and sought how they might
[16:48] destroy him
[16:50] for they feared him because all the
[16:52] people was astonished
[16:54] at his doctrine and when even was
[16:57] come he went out of the city and in the
[17:01] morning as they passed by they saw the
[17:03] fig tree dried up from the roots
[17:06] and peter called in to remember and say
[17:08] it unto him master
[17:09] behold the fig tree which thou kissed
[17:11] this is withered away
[17:14] and jesus answer it say it unto them
[17:18] have faith in god
[17:23] for verily i said to you that whosoever
[17:25] shall
[17:26] see unto this mountain be done removed
[17:29] and be thou cast into the sea
[17:31] and shall not doubt in his heart but
[17:33] shall believe that those things which he
[17:35] saith shall come to pass
[17:37] he shall have whatsoever he said
[17:41] and therefore i say unto you what things
[17:44] so ever you desire
[17:45] when you pray believe that you receive
[17:47] them
[17:48] and ye shall have them and when you
[17:51] stand praying
[17:52] forgive if you have ought against any
[17:56] that your father also which is in heaven
[17:59] may forgive you your trespasses
[18:01] but if you do not forgive neither will
[18:03] your father which is heaven forgive
[18:06] your trespasses let's pray father we
[18:07] thank you lord and i pray you would
[18:09] breathe
[18:10] uh your spirit breath life upon your
[18:12] word and
[18:13] and touch us with life tonight and light
[18:15] tonight in jesus name we ask a team and
[18:17] you may be seated
[18:19] go praise the lord
[18:23] have a title tonight when you stand
[18:26] praying
[18:28] forgive me o pray is the name of the
[18:30] lord there's a great need
[18:32] for forgiveness in this hour
[18:36] people don't even know how uh holding
[18:38] grudges and authors oughts
[18:40] affect the person who is holding the
[18:42] oats and grudges
[18:44] more than the person that you're holding
[18:45] out and grudges against
[18:47] sometimes people don't even know you're
[18:48] holding the ought against them
[18:50] they don't even know what they did but
[18:51] you hot something against somebody else
[18:53] and you're holding it
[18:54] and not affecting all your other
[18:56] blessings
[18:58] because faith is based on forgiveness i
[19:01] want you to understand that faith is not
[19:02] just by hearing the word of god
[19:04] faith itself is based on
[19:07] forgiveness hallelujah that's what the
[19:11] word declares
[19:12] when you stand praying forgive if you
[19:15] have ought against any
[19:17] oh praise god you love him tonight
[19:19] hallelujah and jesus live in that world
[19:22] that that no one knowed about he was an
[19:24] odd person he lived in a world of
[19:26] perfect faith
[19:27] in a perfect god because jesus was
[19:30] unhindered
[19:31] in that he had that sick sense connected
[19:33] to him because he was the word made
[19:35] flesh
[19:36] hallelujah so he wasn't just tied up in
[19:38] five senses he was connected to the
[19:40] sixth sense
[19:41] which was a perfect fate so he lived in
[19:43] another world
[19:45] another dimension and you are going to
[19:47] live in another world
[19:48] another dimension god gonna bring you
[19:51] out of your five senses
[19:52] and bring you into a sense of a living
[19:54] fate oh glory to god
[19:57] hallelujah praise god he said have faith
[19:59] in god
[20:00] hallelujah so when people get excited
[20:03] about look defeat the victory is clear
[20:05] he said have faith in god oh glory to
[20:08] god
[20:08] said he said no if we live in a perfect
[20:10] faith of a christian to what we are
[20:12] we'll be a mystic to the world the
[20:14] people won't understand you

[20:25] to do it

[23:45] because you're walking and walking by
[23:47] sight you're walking by eyes
[23:49] you're seeing flesh and blood but the
[23:50] bible said we're rational against flesh
[23:52] and blood
[23:53] but against principles and powers but
[23:55] yet he doesn't think that all the time
[23:57] but the reality is we are not fighting
[23:59] flesh and blood
[24:00] we fight in all kind of evil spirits
[24:02] every living day
[24:04] oh glory to god hallelujah every living
[24:08] day
[24:09] you can't see them but they're still
[24:10] there you can't feel them but they're
[24:12] still there
[24:14] influencing and pushing and
[24:17] manipulating and whatnot
[24:22] [Applause]
[24:22] [Music]
[24:24] maybe she said you hear what lucifer
[24:27] said jesus all these kingdoms are mine
[24:32] the gift of whosoever i want just
[24:35] worship hallelujah satan say at last i
[24:39] catch him now
[24:41] oh my one man man love this poetic dubai
[24:44] you know
[24:45] oh yes let's get my reporting let's give
[24:46] my thing you like that you know
[24:49] hallelujah man won power in his fallen
[24:53] nature
[24:54] listen listen to be over another man
[25:00] man in his fallen condition
[25:03] lusting for power over
[25:06] other men and jesus who was away made
[25:10] flesh
[25:11] before his ministry take off god lead
[25:14] him to deal with the devil
[25:16] to see how he could handle himself
[25:20] before he could handle others and other
[25:23] things
[25:24] he makes sure the spirit itself that
[25:26] about this bunch of ministers who say
[25:28] they adopted already
[25:29] they messed up big time they may mix
[25:31] they may meet lucy yet
[25:35] they may meet lucifer yet because jesus
[25:38] was led
[25:39] by dynamics into the wilderness
[25:43] to overcome lust of the eyes lust of the
[25:45] flesh
[25:46] pride of life in a private test
[25:52] no believers propping you up you know
[25:55] nobody waving you on come on you could
[25:57] do it amen hallelujah shall turn around
[25:59] and shake your hand to your brother
[26:00] encourage one another it wasn't that
[26:01] general
[26:02] it was he taking a stand for the
[26:04] righteousness it was he saying it's also
[26:07] written
[26:08] oh glory to god this wasn't a secret
[26:10] deed jesse as is you
[26:11] i says you okay i'm hungry i've got ten
[26:13] little bread no he didn't do that
[26:15] he washed the stone he knew his power he
[26:18] knew his authority he could have done it
[26:21] but he didn't do it he wanted to prove
[26:23] that man truly shall not live by bread
[26:25] alone
[26:26] but by every word i proceeded the mouth
[26:28] of god because the bread hallelujah
[26:31] is limited to the senses but the word is
[26:33] eternal
[26:35] all glory to god you're heading for
[26:36] eternity don't be giving away some
[26:38] praises
[26:40] hallelujah so when a man lives by faith
[26:43] and walks by faith i mean substance
[26:46] faith
[26:46] he is isolated from the entire world and
[26:49] becomes a new creature in christ
[26:51] they know you were getting into bright
[26:53] material you were getting into rapture
[26:55] and condition
[26:56] that means that each one of us not just
[26:58] the pastor
[26:59] the deacons the trustees no for each one
[27:03] of us
[27:03] not just the pastor declan trustee that
[27:06] means a lady
[27:07] every individual walks in a world
[27:10] with god alone you are baptized
[27:13] into this kingdom and there is nobody

[44:57] but you have a promise that you're going
[44:59] to know it
[45:01] at that day oh glory to god

[45:08] of his fate
[45:10] when he said silver and gold have i none
[45:13] such as i have i give
[45:15] it was a revelation of the faith that
[45:17] was resident
[45:18] in him
[45:22] [Applause]
[45:24] and that is the faith that god sent a
[45:27] prophetess in our hearts back to
[45:29] not this church joining message thing
[45:31] not that
[45:32] that's why there's going to be a unity
[45:34] of debate
[45:35] not the message defeat not groups desert
[45:41] [Music]
[45:45] and faith is based
[45:49] on forgiveness and forgiveness is the
[45:52] blood of the age
[45:53] [Applause]
[45:56] you have to have that blood here we go
[45:59] displayed

[46:08] go tell them take alarm kill the lamb
[46:11] and take the blood if you have all the
[46:14] blood in the bucket day
[46:15] that's not the only instruction god
[46:16] given it wasn't take the blood have a
[46:18] bucket of blood
[46:19] you have to put the blood a certain
[46:22] place
[46:26] you have to apply it not talk about it
[46:30] not fellowship about it not discuss it
[46:33] not send emails about it and what's up
[46:36] force about it
[46:37] he said apply it that means this gospel
[46:40] that we got

[47:08] this
[47:09] that is why and and that is why and that
[47:11] is why i'm
[47:12] explaining all what is why because you
[47:14] don't want to deal with you
[47:18] you don't want to face up to the mirror
[47:19] of your behavior
[47:21] of your attitude of your arrogance of
[47:23] your pride
[47:25] because you see forgiveness that humble
[47:26] you
[47:31] especially when you are right
[47:34] and they are wrong and you have to
[47:37] forgive them
[47:39] and you know they're wrong and you are
[47:42] right
[47:43] but you still have to forgive them
[47:46] amen no i know they say amen
[47:50] i don't know how deep that a man going
[47:51] back kangaroo but that's a powerful one
[47:53] [Applause]
[47:56] when you know that they're wrong
[48:00] and you have to take wrong and you have
[48:01] to forgive them and drop basically
[48:03] forgive them not talk forgive
[48:05] i mean drop it i mean anything to the
[48:08] spirit of forgiveness then
[48:10] make it hook them up and love them up
[48:12] and take them and
[48:14] eat dinner with them and bread with them
[48:15] right now you don't want to shake their
[48:17] hand
[48:17] you didn't want to talk to them you
[48:18] can't stand them if they walk in so you
[48:20] turn your head so because of
[48:22] something upset in your spirit we talk
[48:24] about when you drop it when you get free
[48:26] from that nothing affecting your spirit
[48:28] you're free when i say you're free
[48:30] you're free
[48:31] you're free to hug them they go feel a
[48:34] hole you know because they know
[48:35] that their things dear but you overcome
[48:37] that
[48:42] and you have to give your testimony i
[48:45] love you brother
[48:46] appreciate your brother god bless your
[48:49] brother
[48:50] oh glory to god i thank god if we say we
[48:52] have no sin we deceive ourselves
[48:54] and the truth is not in us but if we
[48:57] confess our sins
[48:58] he is faithful and just to forgive us of
[49:00] our sins
[49:01] and to cleanse us of all unrighteousness
[49:04] oh glory to god if we say we walk into
[49:06] the light and we hate our brother we lie
[49:08] and do not the truth oh glory to god
[49:11] hallelujah
[49:13] oh glory to god praise god praise god
[49:16] yes yes yes yes yes oh give the lord
[49:19] some praises tonight
[49:30] this on first john 1 that which we have
[49:32] seen and heard declare be unto you
[49:34] that ye or samantha fellowship with us
[49:36] and truly our fellowship
[49:38] is with the father with his son then
[49:40] this is the message which we have heard
[49:42] of him
[49:42] and declaring to you that god is light
[49:45] and in him is no darkness at all
[49:49] so god not any darkness thing god is
[49:52] light
[49:53] in him no darkness at all
[49:56] okay if we see we have fellowship with
[50:00] him
[50:01] and walk in darkness we lie
[50:05] and do not the truth if we say
[50:08] we have fellowship with him and walk in
[50:11] darkness
[50:13] we lie and do another truth but if we
[50:15] walk in the light
[50:18] as he is in the light
[50:21] [Music]
[50:23] then we have no fellowship with one
[50:25] another
[50:27] that's not description so evidence of
[50:30] your walking in the light
[50:34] you have to have fellowship
[50:36] [Music]
[50:38] one with another celebration will pull
[50:42] away their self
[50:43] from the faith
[50:49] they don't want the fellowship the
[50:52] induction
[50:55] because if you're walking in the light
[50:59] let me read it again
[51:02] let me back up a little bit this is good
[51:04] god is light in him no darkness
[51:06] if we say we have fellowship with him
[51:08] and walk in darkness we lie
[51:10] then he come down if we walk in the
[51:12] light as he is in the light
[51:14] we have fellowship one with another and
[51:17] the blood of jesus
[51:19] cleanses us from all sin
[51:23] because the fellowship identified that
[51:25] the blood for you is the blood for me
[51:28] if i know one blood for you and no blood
[51:29] for me the same blood that forgive you
[51:31] forgive me too
[51:33] and if god put the blood on me i could
[51:34] put the blood on you too
[51:36] with the blood of jesus cleanse us
[51:38] [Applause]
[51:41] oh the cleansing stream i see
[51:44] i see i plunge i know it cleanses me
[51:50] hallelujah oh glory to god
[51:54] do you see it tonight the blood for you
[51:57] is the same blood for your brother so
[52:00] don't condemn your brother
[52:01] don't neg your brother your charity

[52:19] for him
[52:20] because that's your brother anyhow oh
[52:23] glory to
[52:24] god hallelujah hallelujah
[52:28] one of the big testimonies considering
[52:30] william branham's
[52:31] life was that you couldn't tell his
[52:33] enemies from his friends
[52:36] think about isaac was preaching and he's
[52:37] talking about when jesus told judas
[52:39] whatever that would just do quickly
[52:41] these are the disciples thought he was
[52:43] going to buy something for jesus or
[52:44] something
[52:45] he won an errand they had no clue that
[52:48] he going to get
[52:49] his his 30 pieces of silver
[52:54] they didn't don't he don't negotiate
[52:56] already and looking to go and collect
[52:58] because his mind was made up to betray
[52:59] christ but christ didn't expose him
[53:03] there was one among you are you watching
[53:05] them soon
[53:11] affects i call him one earlier
[53:16] no christ called judas too he was
[53:19] elected to be among them
[53:22] he was anointed only thing judas didn't
[53:28] make it was your purulena
[53:30] but he was partaking of the ministry and
[53:32] said his ministry was not inferior to
[53:34] the rest
[53:35] [Music]
[53:38] i want to say that again jewish ministry
[53:40] was not

[54:45] i share this scripture with my wife
[54:46] scriptures i blew my mind
[54:48] from deuteronomy chapter 16 it says this
[54:51] here
[54:53] if there arise among you a prophet
[54:56] or a dreamer of dreams and giveth thee
[55:00] a sign or a wonder
[55:03] and the sign or the wonder
[55:07] come to pass whereof he speak unto thee
[55:10] saying so so if you give a sign i wonder
[55:14] and it come to pass
[55:15] then afterwards saying let us go after
[55:17] other gods
[55:19] which thou has not known and let us save
[55:22] them
[55:23] those shall not hacking unto the words
[55:26] of that prophet
[55:28] or that dreamer of dreams for the lord
[55:31] your god
[55:32] prove it to you to know whether you love
[55:36] the lord
[55:37] your god with all your heart and with
[55:40] all your soul
[55:47] listen that again if what the person
[55:49] said come to pass
[55:51] the wonder come to pass and the prophecy
[55:53] of the past you have to go
[55:54] to all and after that come the past and
[55:56] say let me go show
[55:59] off the word so tell them no

[56:41] nothing there's always a voice behind
[56:42] the sign

[56:46] wonder or the miracle so you want to
[56:48] know
[56:49] what that voice is leading to
[56:53] and it was leading to strange gods you
[56:56] said no no no forget it god said don't

[57:01] and fear him and keep his commandments

[1:01:42] got a man to praise
[1:01:44] judas they get my tires have no book of
[1:01:46] my tires go to his pole
[1:01:48] but i had to set things up in a certain
[1:01:49] way for dynamics to fall the church has
[1:01:51] to be set in order
[1:01:53] church can continue all this nonsense
[1:01:55] and all this hate and all these things
[1:01:56] are people messing with hate wisdom
[1:02:00] a demon of hate standing behind
[1:02:02] ministers
[1:02:03] and they swings hate in the people
[1:02:06] they're showing hate in the to the
[1:02:08] church
[1:02:10] by bad talking other churches and other
[1:02:12] ministers
[1:02:13] sealing them down with hate they don't
[1:02:15] understand that go backfire on them
[1:02:17] because with that anointing in them they
[1:02:19] can't have the faith to prolong love
[1:02:22] they don't understand that they think
[1:02:25] having a church on their side here
[1:02:26] their soul and that one soul and that
[1:02:28] one so that's this information but they
[1:02:30] don't know what they're messing with the
[1:02:31] people's faith
[1:02:32] and you see why that's why i didn't go
[1:02:34] that route
[1:02:35] [Applause]
[1:02:38] i want your heart to be pure because i
[1:02:41] want faith active

[1:02:48] [Applause]
[1:02:52] oh glory to god beating people up can't
[1:02:54] prolong love

[1:03:00] into faith
[1:03:01] that based upon forgiveness a free fate
[1:03:04] god whether god bless you or not you

[1:03:23] i reckon that the present suffering
[1:03:25] of the is not present it's not worthy to
[1:03:26] be compared with the glory that shall

[1:04:20] world

[1:04:24] a raspberry perfection
[1:04:26] a bride to come to perfection with a
[1:04:27] judge not just come to church when you
[1:04:29] come to perfection
[1:04:31] we have to get that in our thinking you
[1:04:32] know you have to come to perfection
[1:04:34] and there's only one way to perfection
[1:04:36] is by his perfection
[1:04:38] not the message perfection his
[1:04:39] perfection and that perfection only come
[1:04:42] by spirit
[1:04:43] before the word there was spirit all
[1:04:46] glory the god
[1:04:47] elohim was spirit seven perfect spirit
[1:04:50] and that spirit condensed into logos
[1:04:52] word and logos words spoke let there be
[1:04:55] let there be like to be
[1:04:56] let there be lucifer
[1:04:59] let there be angels let there be them
[1:05:02] wasn't before you know they may know
[1:05:03] that
[1:05:04] because was created he was created so
[1:05:07] perfect
[1:05:12] a musician he knows music he wasn't
[1:05:15] really quiet
[1:05:16] you know he was in charge of running
[1:05:18] things in heaven
[1:05:19] he gets so powerful and caught up in his
[1:05:21] anointing and all his feathers and his
[1:05:23] wings and
[1:05:24] swept back wings and all them kind of
[1:05:26] things and he anointed upon him he's had
[1:05:28] a whisper
[1:05:28] and started a whisper kind of on the
[1:05:30] hand kind of thing to see if he could
[1:05:32] get him in your other side with him
[1:05:34] hallelujah i will be like the most high
[1:05:37] how i say to himself i will do this
[1:05:42] he was the i man
[1:05:46] the original iman original ayah
[1:05:50] man
[1:05:56] he convinced two of the angels
[1:05:59] which is still
[1:06:04] they were heavily angels you know when
[1:06:06] they get kicked out
[1:06:08] they become demons they become fallen
[1:06:12] they fall into darkness because he was
[1:06:16] like an angel of light
[1:06:18] so he fall under darkness and he drop on
[1:06:21] the earth now
[1:06:22] oh glory to god and the brotherhood said
[1:06:24] the battle revenge will become the
[1:06:25] battle of men
[1:06:27] so these supernatural spirits drop down
[1:06:28] on the earth and battling the elect of
[1:06:31] god since that
[1:06:32] time
[1:06:35] so god had to hit the mystery of the
[1:06:38] restoration
[1:06:39] by putting a man with abraham who stood
[1:06:42] with faith for 25 years
[1:06:45] and challenge the devil's kingdom
[1:06:46] without the devil even knowing it
[1:06:48] because he was standing with faith as a
[1:06:50] rock abraham faith
[1:06:52] isaac love jacob grace during perfection
[1:06:56] god was doing a work right under the
[1:06:58] nose of the devil
[1:07:00] because you're reflecting on what we've
[1:07:02] done in you
[1:07:03] [Applause]
[1:07:06] do you get that back for us to go back
[1:07:08] to eden
[1:07:09] we have to go back into the image and
[1:07:10] likeness of god because when god
[1:07:12] finished the earth he said let us make
[1:07:14] man
[1:07:15] he has seen nobody like him
[1:07:18] and that monkey that beard had wailed at
[1:07:20] that session of everything else but
[1:07:22] nothing like him
[1:07:25] and how he operates business upon two
[1:07:26] nothing like him
[1:07:28] close but not like him then god will let
[1:07:32] us make man
[1:07:33] in our image in our likeness
[1:07:36] and let that man have dominion and god
[1:07:39] put a spirit man there
[1:07:44] but he needed a dust man to deal with
[1:07:46] the earth
[1:07:47] because he put man to rule the earth so
[1:07:50] he put man in five senses with sixth
[1:07:54] sense
[1:07:56] five six cents every evening adam using
[1:08:00] six cents to talk with god adam didn't
[1:08:03] even know he was naked every evening
[1:08:05] adam could commune with his father sixth
[1:08:07] sense a higher phone line
[1:08:11] a wireless connection a earthly man
[1:08:14] having an access line to a heavenly
[1:08:17] realm
[1:08:18] of the spirit and what do you think
[1:08:20] about that right now
[1:08:22] just think flesh man just like you and i
[1:08:25] having direct access
[1:08:27] to a heavenly place and a spirit being
[1:08:31] roaming the earth with other angels for
[1:08:33] names lucifer
[1:08:35] looking at an opportunity how to get in
[1:08:38] he can't mess with adam he's had a fool
[1:08:40] with eve
[1:08:41] eve is by product so he talked with eve
[1:08:44] and he fell adam fell and i saw satan
[1:08:48] gain access
[1:08:50] to rain on the earth that's all sit and
[1:08:52] get access to become the prince of the
[1:08:54] power of the ear
[1:08:55] so he rule in the atmosphere oh glory to
[1:08:58] god that's how
[1:08:59] that's how them angels know how to
[1:09:01] battle demon powers to bring messages
[1:09:04] so when daniel was praying gabriel had
[1:09:07] to fight your set of demons
[1:09:09] from the day daniel started to pray he
[1:09:10] had been fighting fighting and brahms if
[1:09:12] he stopped praying he just stopped
[1:09:14] coming
[1:09:15] so your prayer operating angels
[1:09:22] we're going to wrap up and have every
[1:09:23] time i pray i'll do this
[1:09:26] exhortation tonight daniel prayer
[1:09:30] was pulling the angel hallelujah and the
[1:09:34] angels say when you're going back here
[1:09:35] the fight do you know
[1:09:36] he fights him to come and fight him to
[1:09:37] go back are they there angel fighting
[1:09:39] you tell me you don't want to fight
[1:09:41] you want a priest
[1:09:44] today i see somebody holding me to be
[1:09:46] crossed on the head after they jump up
[1:09:48] yesterday
[1:09:50] they're proud to have the big cross in
[1:09:51] the head
[1:09:53] i wonder if i started to give out
[1:09:54] crosses if people would put it on me
[1:09:56] but judge said but you're a priest
[1:10:00] catholic church have a big boom this

[1:10:07] dirt it's spiritual

[1:10:11] dot one reason about dot one of a mark
[1:10:14] one have a color and all kind

[1:10:27] continually cleanses as they continually
[1:10:30] confess
[1:10:31] as you continually repent the blood is
[1:10:34] there to deal with your issues
[1:10:35] continually
[1:10:36] that you could have a continual
[1:10:38] confidence oh glory to god and have true
[1:10:40] fellowship with the father
[1:10:42] you're
[1:10:46] i want to get you a little thing here he
[1:10:48] said now watch watch
[1:10:50] when a man lives by faith he was talking
[1:10:52] about me going all day
[1:10:53] and walked by faith i mean substance
[1:10:55] faith he is
[1:10:56] isolated from the entire world and
[1:10:58] become a new creature in christ
[1:11:00] dear you are now getting into bright
[1:11:01] material you're getting into a rapturing
[1:11:03] condition
[1:11:04] now that means for each one of us you
[1:11:07] are baptized into this kingdom and there
[1:11:09] is nobody in there but you
[1:11:10] and god he give the orders and you pack
[1:11:13] them out
[1:11:14] oh praise the name of the lord i'm going
[1:11:16] to wrap up with this
[1:11:18] i know i said this before it takes three
[1:11:21] elements
[1:11:22] justification sanification through the
[1:11:23] blood and babylon he goes
[1:11:25] this last great step must come into
[1:11:28] perfection
[1:11:29] that the holy spirit has to live in that
[1:11:32] church so
[1:11:32] perfectly it will make the head on body
[1:11:34] unite you know this he's not talking
[1:11:36] about messages preached
[1:11:38] he's talking about the holy spirit
[1:11:40] living
[1:11:42] in the church okay all right
[1:11:46] wow
[1:11:53] all right let's get something here he's
[1:11:56] talking about
[1:11:57] uh version six and they cry with a low
[1:12:01] voicing how long oh lord holy and true
[1:12:03] does thou judge and avenge our blood
[1:12:04] on them that dwell on the earth and
[1:12:06] white rooms were given unto every one of
[1:12:08] them
[1:12:08] it was said unto them that they should
[1:12:10] rest for a little season until their
[1:12:11] fellow servants also
[1:12:13] are of the brethren that they shall be
[1:12:14] killed as they will shall be fulfilled
[1:12:17] note particularly that none of these
[1:12:20] under the altar were killed for the
[1:12:22] testimony to jesus
[1:12:23] they were not like antipas who was slain
[1:12:25] for holding first his name
[1:12:27] these are not born again one with
[1:12:29] eternal life as their possession
[1:12:31] they come up in the resurrection and
[1:12:32] receive life because they stand on the
[1:12:34] word
[1:12:35] everybody i want to get you
[1:12:39] notice how these are crying out for
[1:12:41] vengeance
[1:12:43] they cannot be bride material
[1:12:52] the bride turns the cheek and cries
[1:12:54] further
[1:12:56] forgive them they know not what they do
[1:12:59] these are jews they have to be because
[1:13:02] they are in the fifth seal
[1:13:04] and this is the fourth seal of the
[1:13:05] gentile bride is going to rapture
[1:13:07] so these jews and of his spirit
[1:13:10] so brother over you mean when somebody
[1:13:13] is born
[1:13:13] of the spirit they can say father amen
[1:13:17] forgive them
[1:13:19] you mean is somebody not born of the
[1:13:21] spirit they can't say that that's right
[1:13:23] no they can't say that you mean somebody
[1:13:25] calling for vengeance that's not bright
[1:13:27] material
[1:13:28] you mean there is something called
[1:13:29] bright material
[1:13:31] and bright material when bright material
[1:13:33] stand praying by material will forget
[1:13:35] [Music]
[1:13:36] oh glory to god hallelujah praise the
[1:13:40] name of the lord
[1:13:42] hallelujah so when the spirit falls
[1:13:45] there will become a move among the
[1:13:46] people
[1:13:47] them denominations will swing together
[1:13:49] just as sitting as i'm standing in the
[1:13:50] pulpit
[1:13:51] and the church of god will be ousted and
[1:13:53] they will make a racket until they
[1:13:54] confederate
[1:13:55] put a boycott on anybody that don't
[1:13:57] belong to them
[1:13:58] but by that time the pride will be under
[1:14:01] the anointing
[1:14:02] of the restoration of the spirit of god
[1:14:04] upon the church
[1:14:05] the bride will be a super race a super
[1:14:07] church let's all stand and just praise
