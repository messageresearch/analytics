[0:38] Lord, I worship you.
[0:42] Father, we praise you tonight. We bless
[0:43] your name. We thank you for your
[0:45] presence. We thank you for the faith
[0:47] that you place in our souls. We thank
[0:49] you for calling us. As you said, we have
[0:51] not chosen you, but you choose us. You
[0:54] chose us and ordained us to bring forth
[0:56] fruit. Father, may you come tonight and
[0:59] confirm your word as the reading of the
[1:01] word. May confirm your word with signs,
[1:03] wonders, and miracles. We ask in Jesus
[1:06] name. Amen. God bless you. Tonight we
[1:09] want to read two important scripture.
[1:10] Want to read Acts 43.
[1:28] It says, "And they laid hands on them
[1:29] talking about the put them
[1:33] in the next
[1:36] day. How be it many of them heard the
[1:39] word." This is
[1:46] after many of them which heard the word
[1:48] believed and the number of
[1:51] And it came to pass on the more that
[1:53] their rulers and elders and scribes and
[1:56] as the high priest John Alexander many
[2:00] as were of the kindred of the high
[2:02] priest will gather together at
[2:04] Jerusalem. And when they had set them in
[2:06] the midst they
[2:08] asked the question by what power or by
[2:13] what name have you done this? Then Peter
[2:16] filled with the Holy Ghost said unto
[2:18] them, "Ye rulers of the people and
[2:20] elders of Israel, if we this day be
[2:23] examined of the good deed to the
[2:26] important man, and by what means he's
[2:29] made whole, be it known unto you all,
[2:32] and to all the people of Israel, that by
[2:35] the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
[2:38] whom he crucified, whom God raised from
[2:40] the dead, even by him, this man stand.
[2:45] This is the stone which was set up north
[2:48] of the buildings which is become the
[2:50] head of the corner. Neither is there any
[2:52] salvation in any other for there is none
[2:54] other name under heaven given among men
[2:56] whereby we must be saved. Now when they
[2:58] saw the boldness of Peter and John and
[3:02] perceived that they were unlearned and
[3:05] ignorant men they marveled and they took
[3:08] knowledge of them that they had been
[3:10] with Jesus. And beholding the man which
[3:13] was healed standing with them, they
[3:16] could say nothing against it. But when
[3:19] they had commanded them to go aside out
[3:21] of the council, they conferred among
[3:23] themselves, saying, "What shall we do to
[3:26] these men?" For that indeed is a notable
[3:28] miracle had been done by them to
[3:31] manifest to all them that dwell in
[3:32] Jerusalem. And we can deny it. But that
[3:35] it spread no further among the people,
[3:38] let us straightly threaten them that
[3:41] They speak henceforth to no man in this
[3:43] name. And they called them and commanded
[3:46] them not to speak at all nor teach in
[3:48] the name of Jesus. But Peter and John
[3:51] answered and said unto them, whether it
[3:53] be right in the sight of God to happen
[3:56] unto you, mother of God, more than unto
[3:58] God, judge ye, for we cannot but speak
[4:02] the things which we have seen and heard.
[4:06] So when they had further threatened
[4:07] them, they let them go, finding nothing.
[4:10] how they might punish them because of
[4:12] the people. For all men glorified God
[4:16] for what? What? But but for that which
[4:18] was done. For the man was above 40 years
[4:21] old on whom this miracle of healing was
[4:23] shown. And being let go, they went to
[4:26] their own company and reported all that
[4:29] the chief priests and the elders had
[4:32] said unto them. And when they heard
[4:34] that, they lifted up their voice to God
[4:37] in one accord, and said, Lord, thou art
[4:40] God, which has made heavens and earth,
[4:42] and the sea, and all that is in their
[4:44] them is who by the mouth of thy servant
[4:46] David had said, Why did he rage? And the
[4:49] people imagine vain things. The kings of
[4:52] the earth stood up and the rulers were
[4:53] gathered together against the Lord and
[4:54] against his for truth against thy holy
[4:57] child Jesus whom thou was anointed both
[5:00] Herod and Pontious Pilot with the
[5:02] Gentiles and the people of Israel were
[5:03] gathered together for to do whatsoever
[5:05] thy hand and thy counsel determined
[5:07] before to be done. Now, Lord, behold
[5:09] your threatenings, and grant unto thy
[5:11] servants, that with all boldness they
[5:14] may speak thy word, by stretching forth
[5:16] thine hand to heal, and that signs and
[5:19] wonders may be done by the name of thy
[5:21] holy child Jesus. And when they had
[5:23] prayed, the place was shaken, where they
[5:26] were assembled together, and they were
[5:28] all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they
[5:30] spake the word of God with boldness. And
[5:33] the multitude of them that believe were
[5:35] of one heart and of one soul. Neither
[5:38] said any of them that ought of the
[5:40] things which he possessed was his own,
[5:41] but had all things common. Verse 33. And
[5:46] with great power give the apostles
[5:48] witness of the resurrection of the Lord
[5:51] Jesus and great grace was upon them all.
[5:53] Go bless his word. You may be seated.
[5:55] Oh, praise God. Give the Lord some
[5:57] praises. Scripture itself is anointed.
[6:00] Oh, praise God. And we want to look at
[6:03] uh Acts chapter 12. I want to read verse
[6:06] one. And about that time, Herod the king
[6:08] stretch forth his hand to vex certain of
[6:11] the church. He killed James the brother
[6:13] of John. This is news. Now he killed
[6:15] James the brother of John with the
[6:17] sword. And because he saw it pleased the
[6:19] Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter
[6:21] also. Then were the days of the unleven
[6:23] bread. When he had apprehended him, he
[6:26] put him in prison, delivered him to four
[6:28] quantonians of soldiers to keep him,
[6:31] intending after Easter to bring him
[6:33] forth to the people. Peter therefore was
[6:35] kept in prison. There we go. But prayer
[6:40] was made without ceasing of the church
[6:44] unto God for him. Let me read that
[6:47] again. Peter was kept in prison, but
[6:49] prayer was made without ceasing of the
[6:53] church unto God for him. And when Herod
[6:55] would have brought him forth, the same
[6:57] night Peter was sleeping between two
[6:59] shoulders bound with two chains, and the
[7:02] keepers before the door kept the prison.
[7:05] And behold, the angel of the Lord came
[7:08] unto him, and a light shine in the
[7:11] prison, and he smoked Peter on the side,
[7:14] and raised him up, saying, arise up
[7:16] quickly. And his chain fell off from his
[7:20] hands. And the angel said unto him,
[7:22] "Gyself, and bind on thy sandals." And
[7:25] so he did. He said unto him, "Cast thy
[7:28] garment about thee, and follow me." And
[7:30] he went out and followed him, and whis
[7:33] not that it was which was done by an
[7:36] angel. But he thought he saw a vision.
[7:39] When they were past the first and the
[7:42] second ward, they came unto the iron
[7:44] gate that leadth into the city, which
[7:47] opened to them on its own accord. And
[7:50] they went forth, went out, and passed on
[7:53] through one street, and forth with the
[7:56] angel departed from him. And when Peter
[7:59] was come to himself, he said, "Now I
[8:02] know of assurityity that the Lord has
[8:04] sent his angel and had delivered me out
[8:07] of the hand of Herod and from all the
[8:09] expectation of the Jews." Oh, blessed be
[8:12] the name of the Lord. God bless his
[8:14] word. It's inspiring this morning. Just
[8:16] to just to read that word alone. Praise
[8:18] God. God bless you. Thanks for being out
[8:21] here tonight. Praise God. I'm not
[8:23] sleepy. I'm not weary. I not come to
[8:24] sing you a song tonight. I come to tell
[8:26] you, praise God, there going to be
[8:28] apostolic power and there's going to be
[8:30] apostolic conditions. That's the title
[8:32] tonight. Apostolic power and apostolic
[8:35] condition. Praise God. And I have an
[8:37] inspiration. Praise God. Living under
[8:40] the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.
[8:43] That's the That's the inspiration.
[8:44] Living under the inspiration of the Holy
[8:47] Spirit. Apostolic conditions conditions
[8:49] that will drive us to our knees to pray
[8:52] and to seek after God. Praise God. So
[8:55] buckle up. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[8:57] Hallelujah. Relaxing time is over.
[9:00] Praise God. Buckle up. Apostolic
[9:02] conditions is coming because apostolic
[9:04] power is coming. Once you see apostolic
[9:07] power around the corner, look out for
[9:09] apostolic conditions. Praise God. Praise
[9:11] God. Brother Brandham, as Daniel heard
[9:13] the seven thunders and forbidden, and
[9:15] John heard the voices and the book was
[9:17] sealed and the back of the book was
[9:18] sealed with seven seals. But in the days
[9:20] of the seals to be opened, the mystery
[9:22] of God would be finished. In other
[9:24] words, God would be known to his church.
[9:27] Not some pastor man, not some apostle
[9:30] man, not some prophet man or teacher man
[9:32] or evangelist man. God will be known to
[9:34] his church. Not in three people but as
[9:37] one person. The mystery of God will be
[9:40] revealed. And when it was completely
[9:42] revealed, that's deeper now
[9:45] completely. Then talking about the
[9:48] thunders now the seven mysteries would
[9:50] open up to the church because end
[9:54] here the church will be living under the
[9:57] inspiration of the Holy Spirit. So this
[10:00] is a prophecy of dynamics of the perfect
[10:03] state. There's a prophecy that with the
[10:06] unfolding of the thunders in the air,
[10:08] the church will be living under the
[10:10] inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Him
[10:13] moving in and out and showing not just
[10:16] him moving in and out, but showing his
[10:19] signs of being alive and among us,
[10:23] living among us. And we are then
[10:26] worshiping the living Christ that's
[10:28] among us. You're not worshiping the
[10:30] headstone tabernacle. You are worshiping
[10:32] the living Christ among us. Okay? Give
[10:34] the Lord some praises tonight. Oh, give
[10:36] the Lord a shout in the house.
[10:39] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So, do you want
[10:40] apostolic power? I do. But if we want
[10:43] that, we going to have apostolic
[10:44] conditions.
[10:46] Hallelujah. You're going to have
[10:50] persecution. You have pressure. So, what
[10:53] are you complaining about? Wake up. Wake
[10:55] up. Shake yourself tonight. Your family
[10:58] problem is is is is petty.
[11:03] your family burden petty to what's
[11:05] coming. Hallelujah.
[11:07] Hallelujah. Just had an earthquake that
[11:09] was Sunday
[11:12] night. And it was quite a shaken. I
[11:15] didn't feel it.
[11:16] Somebody did feel it. I didn't feel
[11:20] it. But they felt it. When they feel
[11:23] something like
[11:28] that shakes, you know what?
[11:31] Don't shake so hard. I have
[11:33] $100. Don't shake so hard. My house is
[11:36] not. Don't shake so hard. I am this. I
[11:38] am that. It's irrelevant. It's God
[11:40] shaking. And God about to shake this
[11:42] world. God going to rock this world with
[11:44] his bride because there's going to be
[11:46] apostolic power. I you could you could
[11:49] go to the bank with that. There is going
[11:51] to be a super church. There is going to
[11:53] be a super race. There's going to be
[11:55] anointed man and anointed woman of God.
[11:58] Oh, glory to God. The anointing going to
[11:59] strike the church according to prophecy.
[12:02] Oh, glory to God. Just as they take the
[12:04] pope of America according to prophecy,
[12:06] according to prophecy, there's the
[12:08] anointing going to strike the church.
[12:09] According to prophecy, you shall receive
[12:11] power after the Holy Ghost come upon
[12:14] you. That mean the Holy Ghost don't come
[12:16] come upon you. If it's not upon you now,
[12:18] it's coming. It's coming. It coming.
[12:19] It's coming. Don't go out. Don't
[12:21] backside. Wait for it. It shall surely
[12:23] come. My word shall return void. It
[12:26] shall surely come. The Holy Ghost and
[12:28] fire. Oh, glory to God. You shall be
[12:30] baptized with the Holy Ghost. Not many
[12:32] days hence. That's a prophecy hanging
[12:35] over your head. The devil's a liar
[12:37] tonight. I don't care how old your bones
[12:39] is, how gray your hair is, how much pain
[12:41] in your body. Holy Ghost fire coming.
[12:44] Nothing going to stop it. Going to rock
[12:47] the church world. He going to rock the
[12:49] scribe and the Pharisees in the message.
[12:51] He going to rock Kyas in the message and
[12:53] all them high priest in the message.
[12:55] shaking coming because they're in the
[12:56] message. Oh, praise God. Praise God.
[12:59] Praise God. Hallelujah. There's going to
[13:02] be a third pull. You know that, right?
[13:03] You know what the third pill is? That is
[13:05] God speaking. That's not a man speaking.
[13:08] That's the third pole is God speaking.
[13:10] Man claiming to be adopted liars.
[13:12] Hallelujah. A man claiming to have
[13:13] thirdp liars. The third pole is God
[13:16] speaking. And he said once more the
[13:18] world will hear direct from God. God
[13:20] will speak. We not talking about brother
[13:22] Brandham speaking. We not talking about
[13:23] books and tape and press and play. We're
[13:25] not talking about that. We're talking
[13:26] about a living reality of the God that
[13:29] that word through that prophet
[13:30] coming back on the scene and by direct
[13:33] inspiration speaking to his people. Oh,
[13:35] give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah.
[13:38] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[13:40] Hallelujah. So we warming up.
[13:45] Apostolic
[13:47] conditions, apostolic blessings.
[13:50] So before we hit that dynamics, there
[13:54] must be a time period of cons consistent
[13:57] praise unto God. Abraham testimony was
[14:01] before he received Isaac. He staggered
[14:04] not at the promise of God. God give the
[14:06] man a promise just like God gave us a
[14:08] promise. Your promise is dynamics. Your
[14:11] promise is the Holy Ghost. Your promise
[14:13] is adoption. He said the dynamics of the
[14:15] church is Acts four when we read will be
[14:17] a refilling of the Holy Ghost. They got
[14:19] the refilling after they get licks,
[14:21] after they get the blows, after they get
[14:23] the rebuke, after they get the
[14:24] embarrassment, after they get the shame,
[14:26] after they had their condition, they
[14:28] say, "Lord, look at the threatening."
[14:30] They're threatening to close us down.
[14:32] But they can't close us down until we
[14:34] get this power. Come on, give the Lord a
[14:36] shout tonight. What close us down? Who
[14:39] could close us down? A powerless church
[14:41] with just books and tapes. Nobody want
[14:43] to have endless churches like that. But
[14:46] let the church get into power. They will
[14:50] call together and say by what power is
[14:52] this man made whole. Then the
[14:54] interpretation will be the
[14:55] manifestation. The manifestation will be
[14:57] the interpretation. We have to talk
[14:59] about how much mysteries we have, how
[15:01] much revelations we have, how much re
[15:04] knowledge we have. The manifestation.
[15:09] The Lord some praises.
[15:11] The message will get very simple.
[15:14] Hallelujah. They took
[15:16] note. What was the note they took that
[15:18] they had been with Jesus because they
[15:20] know they wasn't educated. They know
[15:22] they were living something. Whatever
[15:24] they living was thundering because the
[15:27] devil was shook up by what was living.
[15:30] They couldn't deny it. Oh, glory to God.
[15:32] They could
[15:33] question I see it so I see it so and God
[15:37] show me it so. Keep on with your soul.
[15:39] Stay so. But when this word be
[15:41] manifested, it know so and so and so.
[15:44] You know, they have to they can't
[15:46] question it. Everybody know that man was
[15:48] sick. Everybody know that man was
[15:50] crippled. Oh God, it wasn't the devil
[15:52] healed them. Was God healed them? The
[15:55] question was what power was there
[15:58] another entity make that man hold? What
[16:01] power that you come with? What anointing
[16:03] that you come with? What fire you come
[16:06] with? What faith you come with? Is that
[16:09] the faith that was once delivered? Is
[16:11] that the faith that the prophet turns
[16:13] back to the faith of the fathers? Or are
[16:15] we only talking in quotes? Oh, get me
[16:17] started tonight. You know, get me
[16:19] started tonight. You know, we talking
[16:21] about the faith of the fathers have to
[16:23] be living still in spite of fire,
[16:26] dungeon, and sword. In spite of all them
[16:28] hypocrites in the message, all them
[16:30] liars in the message, all them message
[16:32] popes and as bishops, in spite of all of
[16:34] them having all the power they have,
[16:37] there's going to be a super church.
[16:38] There's going to be a bride with real
[16:40] power, apostolic power, resurrection
[16:44] power, virtue power. Oh, give the Lord a
[16:47] shout in the house. I feel good tonight.
[16:49] I'm going to have my own revival inside
[16:51] of here. I'm going to revive for you and
[16:53] revive for me, too. Oh, give the Lord
[16:56] some praises. Come alive inside of here.
[16:59] And look at this. Five people inside of
[17:01] here. We can have a revival tonight. Oh,
[17:04] glory to God. The dynamics of this
[17:06] church will be a refilling of the Holy
[17:08] Ghost. May God refill you tonight. May
[17:11] God fill you tonight. May God seal you
[17:13] tonight. May tonight be your night.
[17:21] Hebrews 13:14 says, "For here we have no
[17:25] continuing city, but we seek one to come
[17:29] by him." Therefore, let us offer the
[17:32] sacrifice of praise to God continually.
[17:36] Not when you get raise up, continually
[17:38] not when your wife cook your best food.
[17:40] Continually, whether she cook or she a
[17:42] cook, whether you a pay or you raise a
[17:44] pay, whether you have a cow, you have to
[17:47] travel, you Offer unto God praise
[17:50] continually because your praise
[17:53] expresses your faith. Your praise show
[17:55] that you say, "Lord, I thank you in
[17:57] advance. I am praising you in advance
[17:59] because know it coming. It coming. It
[18:00] coming. It coming." Oh, the Lord I shout
[18:03] in the house. I have your hand
[18:04] up this way. It coming. It come. Healing

[18:20] changed. Give the Lord a shout. Oh,
[18:22] glory to God. There's going to be an
[18:24] inside change and there going to be an
[18:26] outside change. Oh, God going to change
[18:28] your soul. God going to change your
[18:30] spirit. And the final part, he going to

[20:03] seal the whole building. No leaks. If a
[20:06] man of love, it have to show. If a man
[20:09] of virtue have to show when a woman
[20:11] touch him of his garment and she feel
[20:15] nothing just touch him when he
[20:20] touch something wrong with that Jesus
[20:23] when she touched the hem of his garment
[20:25] not him the garment that means the
[20:27] anointing was flowing through his
[20:29] clothes oh you can't you don't hear me
[20:31] tonight the power the glory was
[20:34] emanating out of the Christ she didn't
[20:37] have to touch the man the flesh
[20:39] Oh, give the Lord some praises. She
[20:41] didn't have to touch the flesh. Jesus
[20:43] touched the hymn of his garment. I tell
[20:45] you what, what could withdraw virtue
[20:47] because he had it. That's why he could
[20:49] give it. He had it. That's why he could
[20:51] release it. He had it. A minister can't
[20:53] give what you don't have. Hallelujah.
[20:56] You can't release what you don't have.
[20:57] That's what Peter said. Silver and gold,
[20:59] I don't have, but what I have, I can
[21:01] give. What does the message have? Give
[21:04] the Lord a shout in the house. We are
[21:06] not promised tonight. Hallelujah.
[21:08] Apostolic power. We are not promised
[21:09] tonight. The power of the Holy Ghost.
[21:12] Not babes but born sons, filled sons,
[21:16] anointed sons, mature sons, trained
[21:21] sons. They're coming back. Coming back.
[21:26] Behold, I send the promise of my father
[21:27] upon you. But turn the seed of Jerusalem
[21:29] until they ended power from on high.
[21:30] Power from where? On high. And he led
[21:33] them as fast. Jesus lifted up his hands,
[21:37] blessed them. Came to pass while he
[21:39] blessed them, he parted from them. They
[21:42] seen Jesus going
[21:44] up and they don't go
[21:48] Lord won't you come back
[21:53] Jesus say byebye. See all saints glory
[21:57] hallelujah. He's going up and they
[22:00] worship
[22:01] him and return to
[22:03] Jerusalem with smiley
[22:12] faces. They return with
[22:16] emojis with great joy. Great
[22:20] joy.
[22:21] Imagine a
[22:33] man when he's scratching. So he's
[22:35] scratching. So he washing his car with
[22:38] expensive whiskey
[22:42] went them have great joy out there.
[22:45] Could you imagine when Jesus left
[22:48] they're crying about God bring it back.
[22:49] Oh hallelujah. Come back Jesus. Come
[22:51] back Jesus. Kind of foolish prayer is
[22:53] that great joy. He gone because I
[22:57] coming. Great joy. He say if I don't go
[23:00] the Holy Ghost will not come. Great joy
[23:02] because you know if he go Holy Ghost
[23:04] coming. If he go dynamic is coming. If
[23:06] you see me go, you could get a double
[23:08] portion. Okay. The Lord I shout in the
[23:10] house.
[23:16] Something lacking in this message.
[23:19] Revelation lacking sister because
[23:22] revelation brings stimulation. It brings
[23:25] joy. Revelation is wine. Word is water.
[23:29] The people getting much of water getting
[23:31] belly pain off of water. They're getting
[23:34] stimulation of revelation because
[23:36] stimulation of revelation brings joy.
[23:38] You know when Abraham asked God why what
[23:40] is it you're going to give me? See I go
[23:42] childish. That was a pain in the middle.
[23:55] change his name and all put a new name
[23:57] on him and say hold that and walk with
[23:59] that and Abraham staged not at a promise
[24:03] to be a father of nations 25 years he
[24:07] was pumping we pump him but 50 years we
[24:09] pumping serve and guess what we're not
[24:11] tired because we know this promise is
[24:13] true we know this message is heal. We
[24:16] know apostolic power coming. We know
[24:18] world counselor church is coming. We
[24:20] know closing down coming. But before
[24:22] they touch that, before they go there,
[24:24] oh give the Lord a shout in the house
[24:26] before they go there. We have to have
[24:28] something here. We have to be living
[24:31] under the inspiration of the Holy
[24:34] Spirit. Him moving in and out. No devil
[24:37] to take that out this book. No devil to
[24:39] take that out the church. We going to
[24:41] have it. I'm going to preach it till it
[24:44] come come
[24:51] alive. They worship him and return to
[24:54] room with great joy and they went and
[24:56] backside by the beach and cook fish and
[24:59] chips and all kind of thing like that.
[25:01] No, no, no. And they were continually
[25:03] watch that continually in the temple
[25:06] praising and blessing God. Amen. So
[25:09] every service can have less praise.
[25:11] Every service should have more praise
[25:13] with this revelation to each believer,
[25:15] individual believer coming to this
[25:17] church. Then you're coming here to open
[25:18] your mouth. You're coming here to watch
[25:20] over and you got a fight and get a
[25:22] fight. Go somewhere else and get your
[25:23] fight. This is not here to place to get
[25:25] fight. Go somewhere else. Have other
[25:27] church to get fight with. This is here
[25:28] to praise and worship God. Get out your
[25:30] sin. Get out your unbelief. Get out your
[25:32] negativity. This is here to worship God.
[25:35] Oh give the Lord some praise him because
[25:36] he come to make sure you know who God
[25:38] is, who the devil is and to know who you
[25:41] are. Oh, come now. Come on, preach back
[25:43] to me. Now, this message come to reveal
[25:46] who God is, who the devil is, and who
[25:49] you are. God is object of worship. It
[25:52] start with that. If he's your God,
[25:54] you're going to worship him because
[25:55] worship create an atmosphere that angels
[25:58] could drop down. Oh God, the spirit
[26:00] could drop down. Peter was in prison and
[26:02] he couldn't do it by himself. Peter was
[26:05] an apostle. He couldn't deliver himself.
[26:07] But the church of God was praying for
[26:10] him continually. They were in the
[26:12] atmosphere. They were in the apostolic
[26:14] atmosphere. They were praying for Peter.
[26:17] Deliver. Deliver. And in answer to
[26:20] prayer, the angels stepped forward. Oh,
[26:22] give the Lord a shout. That is what you
[26:24] must begin to believe. You are part of
[26:26] that punch. That Holy Ghost punch. Oh,
[26:29] give the Lord a shout.
[26:39] You see the you see the order how the
[26:42] Bible plays that the Bible plays the
[26:45] effectiveness of the church praying
[26:48] continually for brother Peter who was in
[26:50] prison and God did a miracle
[26:55] when they came to the iron gate it
[26:56] opened by
[26:57] itself they didn't need automatic press
[27:01] they didn't need a remote for that. It
[27:03] opened by itself. God could open things
[27:06] that man make. Oh, give the Lord a
[27:09] shout. Man put that gate there. You
[27:10] know, God didn't put that gate. You
[27:12] know, man build that and God open it.
[27:15] Oh, give the Lord a shout. But what God
[27:17] God open, no man could shut. What door
[27:21] God shut? No man can open. But God can
[27:23] open whatever man put around you. God
[27:26] could open the Red Sea. God could open
[27:28] anything. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[27:31] Whatever obstacle in your way, whatever
[27:33] mountain in your way, I channel your
[27:35] faith tonight to believe that God will
[27:37] make a way for you.
[27:39] Ain't never a punch because he's the
[27:41] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[27:47] Glory. I hear a shout in the camp
[27:49] tonight. I hear a praise in the camp
[27:51] tonight.
[27:57] When I got this, I said, "Boy, Lord, How
[28:00] are you doing this
[28:02] tonight? Some get stuff and I don't know
[28:04] how this going to work out but we just
[28:06] going with inspiration.
[28:09] So before
[28:10] dynamics praising and blessing God
[28:12] continue that's a
[28:14] testing call the dry biscuit test not
[28:18] your feeling when you're feeling the
[28:19] anointing you're praising God when
[28:21] you're dry.
[28:23] Yeah. Yeah. You know you have a perfect
[28:25] silence through the blood. When look at
[28:27] you but the state is up and down
[28:29] variable you have this way down some you
[28:33] get depressed bad children all kind of
[28:35] things hit your heart hit you your
[28:37] stomach hurt your chest hurt you your
[28:39] back hurt you all kind of hurting you
[28:41] but you're praising God hallelujah
[28:43] hallelujah the hallelujah lift you above
[28:46] the stress and the and the negative and
[28:48] what the devil want to hold you down
[28:49] because the devil is talking in this air
[28:51] of yours tell the negativity creating an
[28:53] atmosphere of negativity around you that
[28:55] you don't have the kind faith. So
[28:56] Abraham stacked not at the promise of
[28:58] God. No one again he just went for the
[28:59] doctor just for kicks because the doctor
[29:00] have no testimony. Doctor have no
[29:02] resentment, nothing about God. He he has
[29:04] no old man. When the doctor see no
[29:07] secretary tell him I'm not there. He
[29:09] want to see Abraham say Abraham I want
[29:11] to check
[29:11] up. Same
[29:14] same that's 20 years. Same same I will
[29:18] charge you this but you're
[29:20] same. The man don't really need to put
[29:22] him. He
[29:23] said good thing you know put the heart
[29:26] back
[29:31] open and Abraham staged not because why
[29:36] God said so and if you know God says so
[29:39] don't stagger don't back down don't let
[29:43] your feeling overcome what God said
[29:45] don't ever give into your feelings give
[29:47] into your faith let your faith step out
[29:50] to preach this tonight I had to have fa
[29:52] to preach this tonight because nobody
[29:54] are ready for no apostolic power in that
[29:56] way. But I have to bring it to you that
[29:58] is coming with a package is apostolic
[30:00] power and apostolic condition. Don't
[30:02] tell me I want this one and you don't
[30:04] want that one. That one could come any
[30:05] time but it just means it's right around
[30:07] the corner. Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[30:10] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You know what
[30:12] was the condition they select that pope?
[30:14] You have to be
[30:17] multilingual. That mean that man is a
[30:19] superman.
[30:21] He could make eight languages. He could
[30:22] speak eight languages. I trying to find
[30:24] the next one
[30:27] English. I am not
[30:29] multilingual. So if they want to choose,
[30:31] they can't choose me. I don't have all
[30:33] them tongues. But this man have all them
[30:36] a super brain to handle that eight
[30:38] languages. You know the man is not right
[30:40] here. Well said they go get the man. The
[30:42] man will deliver. Hallelujah. He call
[30:45] him Satan's superman. That's that's the
[30:48] word he Satan super. Satan have a
[30:50] superman and God have a super bride. I'm
[30:53] not hearing you. I'm not hearing you. We
[30:55] don't want to just go superman,
[30:56] superman, superman. God having a super
[30:58] bride. You having a super church that
[31:00] will do some supernatural works and that
[31:02] I'm hoping that starting tonight. I'm
[31:04] not looking for next week tonight. Oh,
[31:07] you talk about Sunday, we going to talk
[31:08] about no tonight. Tonight, tonight. Let
[31:12] me say it good that you get it tonight.
[31:14] Now faith is tonight. Faith is not
[31:17] Sunday. Faith is now. You could be
[31:18] healed now. You can be delivered now.
[31:20] You could be sealed now. You could be
[31:22] filled right now. Even on the connection
[31:24] and the hookup, you could be delivered
[31:26] right in your house. The anointing can
[31:28] come right to you. Hallelujah. And free
[31:30] you from your bondage. Free you from
[31:32] your past. Free you from your
[31:33] negativity. He sent me here to preach
[31:36] this to you. Oh, glory to God. He sent
[31:38] me here to bring a word to you.
[31:39] Apostolic power is on the earth. Oh, it
[31:42] was released by the seven seals. Oh,
[31:44] give the Lord some praises. Let me say
[31:46] it to you. It ain't coming. It's already
[31:48] here. It was manifested in a prophet.
[31:51] Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[31:53] Hallelujah. It's already on the earth.
[31:56] And God going to give us access to it.
[31:59] Hallelujah.
[32:01] Hallelujah. My my my
[32:06] my
[32:10] glory. Now watch the bomb here. Now
[32:13] imagine preach that this
[32:17] song.
[32:19] Our faith is based on
[32:21] forgiveness as we said this morning
[32:24] trying to get the church into a place
[32:27] where we could really see apostic times
[32:30] moving along. You see how brotherly kind
[32:33] of he bring now if they want to go to
[32:37] apostic times they have to faith if they
[32:40] have to faith you have to forgiveness.
[32:42] This message can't get away from
[32:44] nothing. I don't care what them pastors
[32:45] preach what they say. If they cannot
[32:47] come to this forgiveness and it shows
[32:50] against ministers, God will wipe them
[32:52] out. God will judge them for that
[32:55] wickedness because that is what it
[32:58] is. You're not even man enough to talk
[33:00] to next minister and say Mr. So oneonone
[33:03] man to man that put in the congregation
[33:05] of the whole congregation at war.
[33:08] cooking the
[33:10] pastor
[33:13] cooking
[33:17] that
[33:19] I don't want to be in it and I don't
[33:21] want you to be in it. I want your spirit
[33:23] to be pure. I want your spirit to
[33:25] receive. Anybody that come here, you
[33:27] know, I wouldn't bring a rascal here.
[33:29] You have confidence. I wouldn't bring
[33:33] some that would bring us
[33:39] You have to have
[33:41] confidence as opposed to pick
[33:44] up make sure
[33:48] this so to see aposic times we have to
[33:51] get back to faith to get back to faith
[33:54] we have to get back to forgiveness. How
[33:56] deep is that?
[33:59] and as the question several times, why
[34:01] would God take a holy
[34:04] ghost, showing this woman that he is,
[34:08] showing his sins, showing forgiveness,
[34:10] showing he drop his charges and say you
[34:14] condemn her
[34:15] and what must he
[34:18] learn? Then he said, "It's only the
[34:20] grace of God. We are what we are."
[34:23] And I could
[34:24] never comprehend how somebody claim to
[34:27] be the bride. Listen, claim to be
[34:30] justified and
[34:32] condemn. When you say you are bride, you
[34:35] are saying that you are justified. In
[34:39] other words, you are seeing God free you
[34:41] from your sins and see you as if you
[34:44] never did it. How come God free you and
[34:48] you can free a brother? How come you are
[34:51] free by God and you are bringing up
[34:53] people's sins, bringing up people past,
[34:55] bringing up what people have done and
[34:56] bringing up and busting them to control
[34:59] them. You are liar. That no bride. When
[35:03] brother Brandham was discerning those
[35:04] people crying in the altar, he said that
[35:05] cannot be br material because they
[35:07] crying for judgment.
[35:10] Come on, preach that to me now. When he
[35:12] was checking out the spirit, how long
[35:14] Lord, how long Lord, how long avenge us?
[35:16] Avenge us. He said, I'm not right
[35:17] material, right? They calling for that
[35:20] like the Jews under the altar crying for
[35:23] vengeance. So they bright revenge when
[35:25] Jesus dropped your charges. You was
[35:27] guilty just like everybody else. Come
[35:29] on. You was one of the biggest sinners
[35:30] out. Now God bless you and fill you. You
[35:32] playing you the biggest righteous man
[35:33] out. Shame on you. Shame on those men
[35:36] doing that. Big big big shame. Oh glory
[35:40] to God. Hallelujah. So we read Acts 4.
[35:42] We read Acts 12. And there's another act
[35:46] we want to read as part of the apostle
[35:47] package. Acts five. So the man and as
[35:51] saf his wife sold possession kept back.
[35:54] Peter said and asked why has Satan he
[35:56] said laid at apostles feet. Now we know
[35:59] for sure this is coming because said
[36:01] this is coming. He said it direct a
[36:03] perfect church where sin can stay in it.
[36:06] And who is the man behind that? Peter.
[36:08] Who is he? He denied Christ three
[36:12] times. Who is that? He lead them into
[36:15] swimming going back to fishing. They
[36:17] didn't go three and a half
[36:20] years. No
[36:22] revelation
[36:24] following Peter. He have a mouth. He's
[36:26] very confident. He's bold. We go.
[36:42] He said, "Children, have you any meat?"
[36:45] They said, "We fish all night and caught
[36:46] nothing." He said, "Cast your net to the
[36:48] right
[36:50] side." Thank God there are some humble
[36:52] brothers in verse that willing to obey a
[36:55] voice. Are they sure who it is talking?
[36:58] But when they cast a net, they say,
[37:00] "Help,
[37:02] help." It's is more fish than we
[37:04] thought. They say, "Wait a minute. Is
[37:05] the Lord is a miracle?" Yes, this is the
[37:07] Lord. Yes. He come after them because
[37:11] their name is in the book because he
[37:14] said God had given them to him. You have
[37:16] given them thine they are mines.
[37:19] Hallelujah. And I shall not lose one of
[37:21] them. They're backsliding now but are
[37:23] coming after them. Come on. Come on.
[37:25] Come on. Glory to God. So hear this. Let
[37:28] me tease you tonight. I'm inspired
[37:30] tonight. What is adoption about?
[37:32] Adoption.
[37:35] Adoption
[37:38] here. Adoption is the lost
[37:42] not. Adoption is a bring back
[37:46] sons. It's not a boasting
[37:48] ministry. It's a going after ministry.
[37:52] Hallelujah. That what Jesus did with the
[37:53] one of the well. He went after that seed
[37:56] and he brought her back into order. Oh,
[37:58] give the Lord some praises. Sons Adam,
[38:01] Adam, where art thou? A bride going for
[38:03] the final name. Oh, glory to God. You
[38:06] know who that one is. Glory to somebody
[38:09] out there waiting for that final call.
[38:11] Then the book is closed. Hallelujah.
[38:13] Hallelujah. Then big things begin to
[38:15] take place.
[38:20] Peter under the
[38:33] anointing believer he and his
[38:38] wife have to lie to the Holy Ghost and
[38:41] to keep the price of the we don't put
[38:45] away and smokers
[38:52] He was
[38:55] telling work on
[38:57] yourself. Look in the mirror and see
[38:59] your attitude and behavior instead of
[39:01] trying to justify yourself to your
[39:03] children and justify yourself to your
[39:04] wife or your husband or to your family
[39:06] why you are how you are. Why don't you
[39:08] look in the mirror of the word and try
[39:09] to match up with
[39:11] that? This is cutting tonight. I don't
[39:13] know how I'm saying all but just coming
[39:15] out of my mouth right now. flying on my
[39:17] mouth. Hallelujah. Instead of doing that
[39:20] to justify your behavior. Well, the
[39:23] father, the grandfather, the stepfather,
[39:25] I'm this and nobody know like me. I have
[39:27] a complex deliver. Let me tell you
[39:29] something. I'll tell somebody they have
[39:31] 12 zodiac signs. Sagittarius and Pisces.
[39:34] That's one
[39:35] tr that next people, black people, white
[39:39] people. We can't address all the
[39:43] we psychologist. There's only one Bible
[39:45] here and this Bible here have the word
[39:47] for every race, every color, every
[39:49] condition, every psychology, every issue
[39:51] that you have in your life. This Bible
[39:53] have the answer. I don't have the
[39:54] answer. The Bible have the answer. It's
[39:56] one God we have addressing every issue
[39:58] under
[40:00] son. I'm not trying to be no
[40:02] psychologist or psychiatrist. Hey, how
[40:03] long you so? And your grandfather was so
[40:05] and your grandfather was so grandfather
[40:07] grandmother. Sorry. I have a word here
[40:09] for you. You want deliverance? Come and
[40:11] get free. Free from your past. Free.
[40:13] Free. Free from your fears. Free. Your
[40:16] grandfather tell you this and your
[40:17] grandmother tell you that and some old
[40:19] wise fable and somebody say you'll never
[40:20] get a breakthrough and your blight and
[40:22] your this and you believe all them
[40:23] foolishness. I hear somebody say
[40:25] something
[40:26] wicked. We know
[40:29] that and Satan have believe all kind of
[40:32] thing you know somebody do something to
[40:34] me that's why I ain't getting true.
[40:35] That's a lie. Look at yourself. Most of
[40:38] the times you hindering yourself. Most
[40:40] of the time you misbehaving you know
[40:42] you're not promoting the job. working. I
[40:44] see this one promotion. I see a
[40:46] promotion. I didn't get any
[40:47] promotion. Yeah. Doing the
[40:54] work. I don't know
[40:59] how to light the Holy Ghost and to keep
[41:03] the lamb while remain wasn't th is your
[41:06] own brother. After it was sold, it was
[41:08] still
[41:09] thou conceived this thing in thy heart.
[41:11] There was not men but unto God. And as
[41:15] fell
[41:19] down
[41:24] remove them completely out of it.
[41:29] Young arose, w them up, carried them up,
[41:30] buried them space of half an hour, half
[41:33] space of three hours after not knowing
[41:36] what said tell
[41:40] me how is it that he have agreed
[41:44] together to tempt the spirit of the
[41:47] Lord. Now just
[41:50] think God is sovereign and the
[41:53] sovereignity of God allows him to do
[41:55] whatever he wants.
[41:58] That means he could bless anybody,
[42:03] anoint the right attitude, we could
[42:06] question who is
[42:07] using you could say that Peter is not
[42:11] worthy to be in that position because I
[42:15] have a recording of it. Now your
[42:17] recording of Peter deny Christ doesn't
[42:19] justify your attitude towards Peter
[42:21] because that same Peter that denied
[42:23] Christ is now filled with the Holy
[42:24] Ghost. You was not there. You was not
[42:26] you was not You don't know when. You
[42:28] don't know how. But Peter is an apostle
[42:31] of God. That's what you're supposed to
[42:33] know. And if he's an apostle, it means
[42:35] the pillar of fire is veiled in him.
[42:38] Not because he says so. Because God
[42:41] confirmed it to be so. When Pet said and
[42:43] go, I don't have I have this thing. I
[42:45] can give this thing. I could release
[42:47] this thing. And it was manifested. the
[42:51] church supposed to know. After that man
[42:53] was raised up, that crippled man. 5,000
[42:56] people, homeless people received the
[42:59] message. So the whole of Jerusalem was
[43:02] shook up because this unlearned man was
[43:05] demonstrating Jesus all over again and
[43:07] they couldn't handle it. They want to
[43:09] know what kind of power you get there.
[43:11] Was that a mystery power? Was that a
[43:13] vile plague locust power? What kind of
[43:15] power you have there? Where you get that
[43:17] from? He say in the name of Jesus.
[43:20] It's very
[43:22] simple. The most they could do is say,
[43:24] "Listen, stop preaching
[43:25] them. Don't preach that Jesus name.
[43:28] Don't preach that power thing. Don't go
[43:30] there. Don't go
[43:31] there." When
[43:42] was the government coming
[43:45] down? This is not fearful. If you're
[43:48] frightened, go back.
[43:50] These were Gideon 300. This was soldiers
[43:54] for this warriors of the faith that God
[43:57] promised to raise up. And you're looking
[43:59] at one of them. Oh, give the Lord some
[44:01] praises tonight. I am one of them. Let
[44:04] me give a testimony. I am one of them.
[44:06] One of them, not warriors, but warriors
[44:08] of the faith. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[44:11] That's why I could preach the way I'm
[44:12] preaching tonight because I'm convinced
[44:14] there's going to be apostolic power.
[44:16] Nobody can talk about spoken word press
[44:18] play and just hold a book and say I
[44:19] believe this mystery and that mystery
[44:21] and the seven mysteries and I believe
[44:23] virtues and I believe I believe in the s
[44:25] okay you don't believe virtues fine I no
[44:27] problem what what you believe but where
[44:29] is the power to vindicate and to confirm
[44:32] what you believe and if you have power
[44:34] keep quiet keep it low keep it
[44:38] low keep it
[44:40] low going to try every man work
[44:43] hallelujah this work will be tried
[44:46] Yet this work will be tried by fire. God
[44:48] going to try every man work. So every
[44:50] man will have a testimony of what where
[44:53] the prophecy lays. What is the testimony
[44:55] of the prophecy? God going to confirm
[44:57] that. If we are faithful to the word, if
[44:59] we are stood with the word, God will
[45:01] come and vindicate that. If we are
[45:03] unfaithful and we are untrue to the
[45:04] word, God will show that. He will expose
[45:07] that. He will expose what is wrong and
[45:10] confirm what is right. Oh my. And the
[45:13] wife fell down. Listen. Vers 11. And
[45:15] great fear came on all the church and
[45:17] upon
[45:19] many. All
[45:22] right. Remember we said right when
[45:29] speaks the miraculous takes
[45:34] place to have great revelations taking
[45:37] five
[45:45] hours but you see the spirit that
[45:48] convict 300 people manains
[45:53] And they still
[45:58] explain
[46:00] to omnipotent speaks. Who is that? God,
[46:04] miraculous take place. Hallelujah.
[46:07] Omnipotent speak. And he promised in
[46:09] this last day that he will speak again.
[46:12] When omnipotent speak, the miraculous
[46:16] happens. Brother, he says in John 17, he
[46:20] said, "Father, the hour has come. All
[46:21] things are finished now. All things are
[46:23] getting ready. The crossroad is come.
[46:26] The world is warned. How will we know
[46:29] any of these
[46:31] apostles? When they've done signs and
[46:34] wonders, we have passed through the
[46:37] land. We have combed back and forth. The
[46:39] time has come. Brother, as a gospel
[46:41] preacher this morning, I believe that
[46:43] the Holy Ghost speaking through motor
[46:45] lips today. Anointing ministers are
[46:48] speaking. The time has come and the time
[46:51] is here. Omnipotence has answered and
[46:55] the miraculous is taking place. It has
[46:57] to do with the junction. So I have a
[46:59] bomb to jump for you tonight. At the
[47:01] junction miracle miraculous
[47:05] happens. So if we are approaching a
[47:08] junction, we are approaching a time of
[47:10] apostolic power and miraculous power and
[47:15] omnipotent speaking and the miraculous
[47:18] taking place. Get ready. Get ready. Get
[47:20] ready. Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[47:23] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[47:26] That man, that that centurion man, he
[47:28] saw the miraculous when while
[47:30] omnipresent God was manifested. He says,
[47:31] "Speak the word Lord and my servant
[47:33] shall be healed." And he knew that Roman
[47:37] centurion know he was a man of the
[47:39] authority. And then he said, "Speak."
[47:41] And we know that. Talk about Jesus of
[47:43] the grace of Lazarus crying like a man
[47:45] in the flesh. The matter said, Lord, if
[47:47] I had been here, my brother not died. He
[47:48] walked up to the grave omnipotence
[47:50] manifesting here among us, living with
[47:53] us, God in Christ, reconciling the world
[47:55] to himself. Here he lived with us. God
[47:58] proven himself through his son Christ
[47:59] Jesus. He was omnipotent and miraculous.
[48:01] And if he's the same yesterday and ever,
[48:03] he shall never leave you. How can we
[48:06] look for anything else but when he
[48:07] speaks for miracles to happen? So how am
[48:10] I claiming to be God man and adoption
[48:12] man?
[48:24] adoption that corona virus they lost the
[48:26] adoption they lost the power they lost
[48:28] all that glory and all that speaking and
[48:30] all that drama
[48:37] that and yet the prophet said we are
[48:40] striving
[48:42] to enter into the kingdom of God before
[48:45] these plague strike and sons of God
[48:48] going to push back diseases and push
[48:50] back cancer and push back. We are
[48:53] waiting for we are waiting for it again.
[49:05] sick. The more they make the
[49:08] faster
[49:22] shif. But when he speaks for the
[49:25] miraculous to happen, oh my speak
[49:28] omnipotence, miraculous will take place
[49:30] and you always do it at the junction.
[49:33] Here we go. This is deep. We are at the
[49:36] junction. Omnipotent speak. And a dead
[49:39] man dead live again stood on his feet.
[49:41] Went to a banket and he suffer with him.
[49:42] What happened? Some glorious day. We who
[49:45] were once dead in sin and trespasses.
[49:47] Omnipotent spoke. We were going to hell.
[49:50] And omnipotent spoke. We have raised
[49:52] from hell to glory. And someday we eat
[49:55] the banquet supper at the last days. The
[49:58] word is omnipotent because the word is
[50:01] God. Oh, glory to God. We are like Noah
[50:04] building away at the ark. The miraculous
[50:05] will take place someday when the and the
[50:07] rapture will come and Jesus will come.
[50:09] We at the junction. And when you see
[50:11] these things happen, raise up your
[50:12] hands. Your redemption joth. Praise God.
[50:16] Look at Paul in the ocean, little old
[50:17] ship that was water logged 14 days. He
[50:20] went in the bulkhead in the gallery to
[50:21] pray and I see a little Jew come shaking
[50:23] his hand and said, "Brethren, be of good
[50:25] courage for the angel of God whose
[50:27] servant I am stood by me last night
[50:30] saying fear not Paul. Thou must be
[50:32] brought before Caesar. And though God
[50:34] give all this that sail with you to
[50:37] you, how be it I seen in the vision that
[50:40] the ship must be wrecked upon a little
[50:42] shore near a creek or something like
[50:43] that. Wherefore, brethren, be of good
[50:45] courage for I believe God is just a
[50:47] shown to me. He said, "Is that the faith
[50:50] that was once delivered to the saints
[50:52] and that shipwreck a snake bite him and
[50:54] he's supposed to die and anybody looking
[50:55] to die
[50:58] looking to get you out of the way and
[51:00] they that snake off. Wait, shake it off.
[51:04] Shake off debt. Shake off worry. Shake
[51:06] off past. Shake off fear. Shake it off.
[51:09] I don't care. A reckless kind of faith.
[51:11] You just shake it off. Oh, glory to God.
[51:13] If I went on my field tonight, I can
[51:14] never come and preach this. But I shake
[51:16] all them females off. I come tonight to
[51:18] give aposic power knowing apostolic
[51:20] condition when I come. Knowing to wake
[51:22] up the church. Praise God. Stop looking
[51:24] at your trials as such a big trial small
[51:27] compared to what's coming. Oh, give the
[51:28] Lord some praises.
[51:30] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You want a
[51:32] bigger bomb than that one? This one
[51:34] explode big. You know, omnipotence can't
[51:36] speak without being miraculous.
[51:42] You know, revealing the mystery is God
[51:44] speaking. speaking tonight because we
[51:46] talking about trumpets and vows and
[51:47] woman and all
[51:51] my
[51:53] home
[51:58] speaking like I say when the
[52:06] Christ from heaven that was a miracle
[52:09] coming there that was inspiration coming
[52:11] there heard from heaven and that's why
[52:13] the devil fight
[52:15] He fight the spirit. He want people to
[52:17] be educated in the message full of
[52:19] information and not
[52:24] revelation. When omnipotent spoke,
[52:26] miracles take place. This is the
[52:29] junction of all junctions. This is the
[52:31] end time. The end of the whole history
[52:33] of the world is right now at hand. So,
[52:36] are you ready? Almost done. You can
[52:38] expect omnipotence to speak. You can
[52:42] expect the greatest and mightiest
[52:43] miracles that ever happen on the earth
[52:45] will happen in the next few years to
[52:48] come. So, brother George, anybody who
[52:50] want to play down miracles, play down
[52:52] power. That's why you hear me pray
[52:54] confirm the word with signs and
[52:55] miracles. I'm not just saying that for
[52:57] exercising. I'm saying that because
[52:59] exercise my faith in expecting God to
[53:01] confirm the word with signs, wonders,
[53:04] and miracles. It's three different
[53:06] things. Oh, give the Lord some
[53:07] praises. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[53:10] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But the Bible
[53:12] said Jesus appearing among us is a sign
[53:14] of his coming.
[53:18] That's how we know he's coming because
[53:20] he is here. Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[53:24] He said Daniel worshiping the living
[53:26] Christ among us. You are living under
[53:29] the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. It
[53:31] have no man in that picture. It have no
[53:33] human in that picture. It have no flesh
[53:35] in that picture. It have no pastor
[53:36] parading his beef in that picture.
[53:39] You are living under the inspiration of
[53:40] the Holy Spirit. Oh give the Lord a
[53:42] shout in the house. Glory to God man get
[53:45] out of the way and the Holy Spirit
[53:48] stepping forward.
[53:50] What Holy Spirit? The same one Peter
[53:51] said this is the stone that you build
[53:54] refused. Oh glory to God. Because the
[53:57] cornerstone was the baptism of the Holy
[53:59] Ghost and the capstone is the same Holy
[54:02] Ghost charity. Hallelujah. The prize
[54:04] absolute. Oh, give the Lord a shout in
[54:07] the house tonight.
[54:10] They reject it. I say it big and bold.
[54:13] They reject it in the message of an
[54:15] intellectual bunch preaching thing
[54:18] washing your mind with
[54:21] information. Let me say it again. So you
[54:23] can expect omnipotence to speak. You can
[54:26] expect. So he said I am supposed to
[54:28] expect that. We in this church supposed
[54:30] to expect that. And you can expect the
[54:33] greatest and mightiest miracles that
[54:36] ever happen on the earth will happen in
[54:38] next few years to come. If Jesus
[54:41] tar it will
[54:48] be but that's not all. He continues then
[54:53] watch for Satan to rise too because when
[54:56] all heaven turns loose all hell turns
[54:59] loose.
[55:01] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. And when
[55:04] the when the prophet saw the woman with
[55:05] a mascara and so on and makeup, he said,
[55:07] "But that's the vision on hell." He
[55:09] said, "Hell on the earth and the combat
[55:11] hell on the earth." Seven angels come
[55:14] from eternity to gather all the
[55:16] scattered word because God could only
[55:18] work through his word and his word was
[55:20] scatter. So spirit couldn't have no room
[55:22] to move. So when God line up the word,
[55:25] seven words, seven mysteries, seven
[55:28] voices, seven seals, seven thunders,
[55:31] line up that word, spirit flow through
[55:33] that word, which devil going to stop it.
[55:36] We shall have a revival. Seven thunders
[55:38] will be the private revival. There will
[55:40] be a super church. Oh, give the Lord a
[55:43] shout in there. You'll be worshiping the
[55:47] living Christ in there. You'll be living
[55:49] under the inspiration of the Holy
[55:52] Spirit. Oh my. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[55:56] Music. Come on, please. Hallelujah.
[55:57] Praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[56:00] Hallelujah. Glory to God. He said the
[56:03] church, the message church is no longer
[56:06] the mouthpiece of God. It is own
[56:09] mouthpiece. Watch minister preaching
[56:11] their own revelation. They are believe
[56:12] around. They are liars. They are
[56:13] unbelievers. They preaching their own
[56:15] message and putting a a message stamp
[56:17] behind it. People hang up a picture and
[56:20] a light behind
[56:22] the
[56:24] message of fire
[56:28] lights. Hallelujah. That's why you have
[56:30] that the reason why you move us to
[56:34] praise God. He said I came to point
[56:36] people to that statue of perfect man and
[56:39] that's why I come to point people to
[56:40] that not to him not to brother. I come
[56:42] to point people to the statue of perfect
[56:44] man. That's why he said that man could
[56:46] become a powerhouse. That's how God want
[56:48] to be a powerhouse because God want God
[56:50] God want us to return back to Eden. We
[56:52] can't return back eating back. That's a
[56:55] terrible to be in the l sit down and
[57:00] say you have no life. I'm not listening
[57:04] to you. You were supposed to be my
[57:06] master want to go back to you get bite.
[57:10] You understand I'm saying the evening
[57:12] you want is lion sit down and say okay
[57:15] son mountain just move to the
[57:20] left and the mountain get up and
[57:25] shift. So he said now watch the church
[57:27] is no longer the mouthpiece of God it is
[57:30] his own mouthpiece. So God is turning on
[57:33] her he will confront her through the
[57:34] prophet and the bride for the voice of
[57:36] God will be on books and tapes. No, not
[57:39] only there. The voice of God will be in
[57:41] her. So through these seven ages, seven
[57:44] voices. So this voice of God is the
[57:46] seven voices becoming one
[57:49] voice. Oh, I'm having myself a time
[57:51] tonight. These seven voices come one
[57:54] voice. And this voice will be in the
[57:56] bride. Not in books, not in tapes, but
[58:00] in the bride. So when people reading the
[58:03] books, the bride reading them. You
[58:05] understand that? what they're reading
[58:06] the bride will be living the voice of
[58:08] God going to be in her and he give us
[58:10] scripture for it he said for in the last
[58:12] chapter of revelation verse 17 says the
[58:15] spirit and the bright
[58:18] come that is where he said once more the
[58:21] world will hear direct from God as at
[58:25] Pentecost
[58:28] hallelujah hallelujah no question
[58:31] brother George Hallelujah let's
[58:35] He said no what they crying you have the
[58:37] word you have more Bible than ever
[58:39] you're not doing anything but but but
[58:40] divide and hacking it uh leaving out
[58:43] what you want don't want you are not
[58:44] interested in living it but debating it
[58:46] that's where the mysteries come out
[58:48] about some say three and a half years
[58:50] the tribulation somebody come seven
[58:53] years to the tribulation and there's
[58:56] argument and get it right both the same
[58:59] place Whether it's three years, three
[59:01] and a half years or seven years, both of
[59:02] them going to be there together with
[59:04] three and a half years and they will be
[59:06] in the tribulation. I thought three and
[59:07] a half
[59:10] years they arguing three and a half
[59:12] years, seven years. So we can't get
[59:14] fellowship because you believe three and
[59:16] a half
[59:19] years said taking what you want, leaving
[59:22] out what you don't want.
[59:23] You are not interested in living
[59:26] it to live it. You have to do the
[59:29] virtues because that pyramid is the
[59:31] Bible
[59:32] also. If this book is seven seals, that
[59:36] virtue stature is seven
[59:39] seals. Whatever this book is, that book
[59:41] is this. We could preach from that you
[59:44] have to live
[59:48] from. It's 14 seals. Some inside written
[59:51] and some on the back.
[59:53] But it's not 14 seals because you can't
[59:55] see the seals on the back. The ones
[59:57] inside is written, not the ones on the
[59:59] back. So we say the ones on the back is
[1:00:02] spirit. The ones inside is word. The one
[1:00:05] outside is dynamics. The ones inside is
[1:00:09] mechanics. Oh, the Lord just shouted the
[1:00:12] house. Same word, same God. Is this the
[1:00:17] mystery of the thunders that will bring
[1:00:19] back the headstone that will bring back
[1:00:21] the power into the church? Sers, is this
[1:00:23] the time?
[1:00:25] They're not interested in living it, but
[1:00:27] they beat it. Hallelujah.
[1:00:31] Are going to close. Listen to the
[1:00:34] authenticated prophet of God who appears
[1:00:36] in this last age. What he sees from God,
[1:00:39] he sees from God. The bride will
[1:00:43] say the
[1:00:45] spirit and the prophet and the bride
[1:00:49] will be saying the same thing and what
[1:00:52] they say will have already been said in
[1:00:55] the word.
[1:00:56] My God. But another question said we
[1:00:59] need apostolic teaching apostolic power.
[1:01:02] That apostolic power is not allgether
[1:01:04] noise. It's the Holy Spirit and the love
[1:01:08] of God that makes us want in Christ
[1:01:10] Jesus. People want to colonize, make
[1:01:13] cults, formations. That's what they have
[1:01:15] done in the church. They get in there
[1:01:17] and hide their own sins. I belong to so
[1:01:19] and so. I belong to this church. It's
[1:01:20] the biggest church. I look how big it
[1:01:22] is. There's one thing that hides. That's
[1:01:24] the blood of Jesus Christ. Oh my.
[1:01:28] Hallelujah. Now
[1:01:33] watch. There is the real true church
[1:01:35] speaks in his power. where the apostic
[1:01:38] power returns to the church when the
[1:01:39] government shall be upon the
[1:01:41] shoulder. But the government shall be
[1:01:43] upon the
[1:01:45] shoulder. Isn't that right? Watch. So
[1:01:49] God have to speak. He that hearth you
[1:01:51] heareth me. He that despiseth you
[1:01:53] despiseth me. Watch that proves that God
[1:01:56] speaks his message through his servants.
[1:01:58] Then I want to bring
[1:02:00] you the power of the believing church.
[1:02:02] Christ has all power. Isn't that right?
[1:02:04] Now watch. Remember God's law of
[1:02:05] reproduction after its kind. The seed of
[1:02:08] Christ
[1:02:10] must come through his body. Not through
[1:02:13] denomination, but through a bornagain
[1:02:16] seed of the word. What is it? Christ
[1:02:19] seed. How does my seed come? Through the
[1:02:22] body. How does a seed seed come? Through
[1:02:24] the body. Seed is through the body. And
[1:02:27] the church is the body of Christ. Isn't
[1:02:29] that right? And this bird produces
[1:02:31] himself in the body. His church. Now
[1:02:34] Philip was up to Pentecost Jerusalem to
[1:02:36] worship. The uno has been all with the
[1:02:38] dees and elders and so on. Although an
[1:02:41] angel direct Philip to him but the germ
[1:02:44] of life had to come from the body. He
[1:02:46] said now we are on the line. Where did
[1:02:49] that germ come from? From the angel? No.
[1:02:52] The angel show him where to go. An angel
[1:02:54] is a messenger. Here is a son. This is
[1:02:57] what we're going back to. This is the
[1:02:59] faith of the fathers. This is what the
[1:03:01] apostles had. Here is a son. Philip had
[1:03:04] the germ. What is that germ? All them
[1:03:06] virtues inside of
[1:03:10] him. Not faith. People think when Paul
[1:03:14] did not faith in Paul had Christ in him.
[1:03:18] In other words, the full dream is from
[1:03:20] faith to charity. The full life
[1:03:22] quickened alive in the man. He said the
[1:03:25] pillar of fire will dwell in the adopted
[1:03:28] sons in the last days. Full germ. He
[1:03:31] said no Philip had the germ the message
[1:03:33] the
[1:03:39] word that's how a child can be born
[1:03:41] Philip laid his hands upon him Philip
[1:03:43] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:03:44] there come forth the spirit of God the
[1:03:47] German to come from the body then he
[1:03:49] switched to Cornelius the same thing
[1:03:50] took place in acts 10 Peter was on the
[1:03:52] housetop angel directing to Cornelius's
[1:03:54] house but where did the word come from
[1:03:55] the body he said I feel pretty good and
[1:03:58] while Pet these words not the angel Not
[1:04:01] the cardinal. Why did Peter speak these
[1:04:02] words? He was the body. He had the word.
[1:04:04] The word took a hold and the spirit
[1:04:06] bring the
[1:04:10] life. So if that is so and we coming
[1:04:13] back to the days of the then God will
[1:04:16] fill two sons with his life with the
[1:04:20] full journey. Those sons will belong to
[1:04:23] this fivefold ministry because a
[1:04:25] fivefold ministry doesn't address the
[1:04:27] local church. It addresses the body of
[1:04:29] Christ. You hear from the apostle. You
[1:04:32] hear from the prophet. You hear from the
[1:04:34] pastor. You hear from the teacher. You
[1:04:36] hear from the evangelist because they
[1:04:37] minister to the body of Christ which is
[1:04:39] the international
[1:04:41] body. You going to play
[1:04:44] something? This is perfect. This is the
[1:04:46] last scripture I read. I close with a
[1:04:48] scripture. For John truly baptized you
[1:04:50] with water, but he shall be baptized
[1:04:53] with the Holy Ghost
[1:04:56] notes. When they were come together,
[1:04:59] they saying, "Lord, will thou at this
[1:05:01] time restore again the kingdom of
[1:05:03] Israel?" unto them for you to know the
[1:05:05] time of the seasons the father put in
[1:05:07] his power but he shall receive after the
[1:05:11] holy
[1:05:12] ghost shall be witness unto me both in
[1:05:15] Jerusalem
[1:05:19] Judea you shall
[1:05:21] receive shall receive unfolding of
[1:05:24] revelations
[1:05:28] never
[1:05:30] power that's what the message needs
[1:05:33] When he spoke about the bride revival,
[1:05:35] he said there have been no manifestation
[1:05:38] of God to steal the brother, they have a
[1:05:40] lot of talk, a lot of unfolding,
[1:05:42] teaching, revealing and showing and all
[1:05:45] that for years, 50 plus years. But he's
[1:05:47] not talking about he specified it. There
[1:05:51] have been no manifestation God to stir
[1:05:54] it back. He will send it. He promised
[1:05:57] it. These are my words or his words. He
[1:06:00] said his words. He will send it. He
[1:06:03] promised it. If the church would forget
[1:06:05] their pleas and dog, forget their
[1:06:08] foolishness and plead the promises and
[1:06:09] say, "God, you said it. Send it Lord.
[1:06:11] Send it Lord." He would send it. Let's
[1:06:13] all stand and worship the Lord. Father
[1:06:15] God, I thank you for your tonight. I
[1:06:16] pray you bless your people, those that
[1:06:17] are here, those that would are
[1:06:19] connected, those that would hear the
[1:06:20] message, and may you edify them and
[1:06:22] build them up and strengthen them to
[1:06:23] know what is yet to come. Granted, God
[1:06:25] in Jesus name I ask it. Amen. Amen. God
[1:06:27] bless you. Thanks again for coming. Love
[1:06:29] you.
[1:06:34] We need
[1:06:39] your Holy Spirit
[1:06:54] rain. Let your power fall. Let your
[1:06:59] voice be heard. Come and change our
[1:07:04] hearts as we stand on your word.

[1:07:45] touch
[1:07:48] again. Holy Spirit,

[1:08:27] Spirit. Let's just worship the Lord
[1:08:33] tonight. Hallelujah.

[1:08:38] praise you, Lord. We bless your holy
[1:08:41] name, Lord. We thank you,
[1:09:00] Jesus.
[1:09:09] Holy
[1:09:20] Spirit. Let's give the Lord a hand of
[1:09:23] praise.
[1:09:29] Amen. Amen.
[1:09:31] Love the Lord tonight. We appreciate the
[1:09:34] message
[1:09:36] tonight. My my what a blessing to be
[1:09:41] here to be gathered
[1:09:43] together.
[1:09:45] Amen. Let's sing that
[1:09:50] song. It's
[1:09:54] behind
[1:09:56] that tremble. It's the life behind
[1:10:02] that makes the proud hearts humble. It
[1:10:05] is God who
[1:10:23] plans tremble. It's the life behind the
[1:10:28] name that make the proud hearts humble.
[1:10:32] It is God who
[1:10:51] devismons tremble. It's the life behind
[1:10:55] the
[1:10:59] name. It is God who a plan so that only
[1:11:05] as a
[1:11:06] man can live so he can give us
[1:11:12] life. Let us bow our heads as we pray
[1:11:15] for this evening's Tyson offering. Oh
[1:11:17] heavenly father, we pause once more Lord
[1:11:19] just to pray for the ti and offering
[1:11:21] that's about to be picked up. Lord you
[1:11:23] bless those that give and provide for
[1:11:25] those who are not in a position to give
[1:11:26] at this time may be used for the gospel
[1:11:29] in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:11:41] Oh, it's the life behind the name that
[1:11:45] makes the demons tremble. It's the life
[1:11:49] behind the name that makes the proud
[1:11:57] heart so that only as a
[1:12:01] man can live.
[1:12:16] It's the life behind the name that makes
[1:12:20] the broad humble. It is God who devises
[1:12:24] a plan so that
[1:12:28] only so we can live so he can give us
[1:12:41] life. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:12:44] Hallelujah.
