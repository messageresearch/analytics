[33:05] have the oversight the preeminence as
[33:07] God come among us tonight and speak a
[33:09] word just one word from you and give
[33:12] feet to the people tonight by Your Word
[33:14] Lord may you speak your word admit
[33:16] materialize just like that then Jason we
[33:19] ask it
[33:21] God bless you and thanks for being here
[33:23] tonight
[33:24] you want to go straight into the
[33:25] scriptures we want to read from Romans
[33:28] chapter 4
[33:29] reading from we see them to 16 Romans 9
[33:34] 7-9
[33:35] galicians 3 2 verses the other 16 and
[33:39] 29.
[33:40] reading Romans 4 11 and he received the
[33:44] sign of circumcision a seal of the
[33:47] righteousness of the feet which he had
[33:49] yet been uncircumcised
[33:51] that he might be the father of all them
[33:53] that believe though they be not
[33:55] circumcised that righteousness might be
[33:58] imputed unto them also and the fathom
[34:01] circumcision to them who are not of the
[34:04] circumcision only but who also walk in
[34:07] the steps of the feet of Father Abraham
[34:09] which he had been yet uncircumcised for
[34:13] the promise that he should be the heir
[34:14] of the world was not to Abraham or to a
[34:17] seed through the law but to the
[34:20] righteousness of faith for if they which
[34:23] are of the law be ears faith is made
[34:25] void and the promise made of non-effect
[34:28] because the law worked right and where
[34:31] no law is there is no transgression
[34:33] therefore here we go it is a fate that
[34:37] it might be by grace to the end the
[34:40] promise might be sure to all the seed
[34:43] not that only it was of the law but that
[34:46] also which is of the feet of Abraham who
[34:49] is the father of us all Romans 9 verse
[34:53] 7.
[34:56] neither because they are the Seed of
[34:58] Abraham are they all children
[35:01] but in Isaac shall thy seed be called
[35:05] that is they which are the children of
[35:08] the flesh these are not the children of
[35:11] God but the children of the promise
[35:14] accounted for the seed for This Is The
[35:17] Word of Promise at this time will I come
[35:20] and Sarah shall have a son
[35:29] Galatians chapter 3 verse 16. now to
[35:32] Abram and a seed with the promise made
[35:35] he see it not unto seeds as of many but
[35:40] as of one unto thy seed which is Christ
[35:44] verse 29.
[35:46] and if he be Christ then I.E Abraham's
[35:50] seed and is according to the promise
[35:53] let's pray father we thank you for the
[35:55] scriptures Lord and it will take the
[35:57] Holy Spirit to interpret it come and
[35:59] interpret it to the hearts and lives of
[36:00] the children and the Holy Ghost alone is
[36:03] the revealer of the divine revelation of
[36:05] Jesus Christ and we invite you Lord to
[36:07] come down and bring Revelation upon
[36:09] Revelation upon the lives of your people
[36:10] in Jesus I ask it amen you may be seated
[36:13] praise God we thank God to be here
[36:16] tonight it's a blessing and a privilege
[36:18] to be here
[36:19] and I have a context scripture I like to
[36:21] read you ever find it it's from Genesis
[36:23] 1 and um we see Lebanon 12 it says and
[36:26] God said let the Earth bring forth grass
[36:29] the hoop healing seed and the fruit real
[36:31] and fruit of his kind Who season himself
[36:33] upon the Earth and it was so and the
[36:35] Earth brought forth grass and Herb
[36:37] healing seed after his kind and the
[36:39] treed and fruit whose seed what is
[36:41] himself after his kind and God saw it
[36:45] was good so tonight I have a title only
[36:47] the elect can be reborn
[36:50] that's the date of the night only the
[36:51] elect can be reborn all praise was a
[36:55] blessing to know that God put that elect
[36:57] upon you he called he called that lady
[36:59] elect lady two Spirits so closely shall
[37:02] receive the elect if it was possible so
[37:04] they say elect bunch of people on the
[37:06] Earth isn't that right all right so I
[37:08] just want to time something from Sunday
[37:09] he said no and this I want you to
[37:12] believe this is all he had now we read
[37:13] this the Bible is manifested again like
[37:17] in the early days of Christ
[37:19] you are
[37:21] a predestinated seed just like Christ
[37:24] was
[37:25] and when the rain falls on the seed the
[37:29] life produces itself when the Holy
[37:33] Spirit Falls this is not teachings he's
[37:36] talking about here he's talking about
[37:37] when the Holy Spirit Falls and there's a
[37:40] scripture it shall come to pass
[37:41] afterwards that I will pour out my
[37:45] spirit Oh Glory the God has a promise in
[37:48] the word your career is that you can't
[37:50] pull that out you can't mystify that
[37:52] that is just what God said it shall come
[37:54] to pass afterwards that I will pour out
[37:57] my spirit isn't that right
[37:59] then you talk about the upper room he
[38:01] said no when it fell on those seats
[38:03] Jesus said he chose them before the
[38:05] foundation of the world and they were
[38:07] predestinated seed now we just say you
[38:10] are a predestinancing just like Christ
[38:12] was now tonight is a faith building
[38:14] message it's a message that still up
[38:16] your fate so we ain't come to bring some
[38:18] heavy stuff on here that you can't get
[38:19] stirred up with this is the put your
[38:21] faith that you're going to receive what
[38:23] God promised you isn't that right so if
[38:25] you're feeling down for you alone the
[38:27] night is not for you this message is for
[38:29] you if you're feeling half crack half
[38:31] cranky the night is night for you oh
[38:33] blessed be the name of the Lord he said
[38:35] watch he chose them before the function
[38:38] of the world and they were predestinated
[38:40] seated and I would say like you are
[38:42] tonight is that right and then they haul
[38:44] themselves up in the upper room these
[38:47] seeds the word and the Word was laying
[38:50] there without life on it and all of a

[41:16] tonight
[41:17] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God well
[41:21] this is a big one we're coming to here
[41:22] now in six thousand years God had
[41:25] planted all these wonderful seeds he
[41:27] spoke in that day
[41:29] Hallelujah the Bible talk about Darkness
[41:32] cover the deep and the spirit of God
[41:34] move upon the face of the water and then
[41:36] God said let there be light that's how
[41:39] God has materialized thing God had to
[41:41] speak at first you have to talk at first
[41:43] from thought to word expression because
[41:46] they'll let there be light until was
[41:48] light when he said let there be light
[41:50] that was a seed we do no longer take but
[41:53] afterwards the Spirit come and brewed
[41:55] upon that seed of let there be light and
[41:57] then it was light a manifestation of
[42:00] what God spoke or give a lord a shout
[42:03] amen
[42:04] hallelujah now watch this part now he
[42:08] commanded each one of those seeds that
[42:10] what they should be
[42:12] that they should transform themselves
[42:14] into the plant of which kind of life
[42:17] that the word of God has spoken it
[42:19] should be if it was an oak tree it was
[42:22] to bring forth Oak if it was a palm it
[42:24] was the Binford pan oh here it is
[42:27] because the great Creator had just sent
[42:31] forth his word
[42:33] and the word seed was dear before the
[42:37] real seed was formed
[42:40] that's the bomb tonight
[42:42] the world seed was dear before the real
[42:45] seed was formed so when God said let
[42:47] there be light there was a world seed
[42:49] Hallelujah and then that sea materialize
[42:52] and that's a real seed Oh Glory to God
[42:55] before there's a real seed there must be
[42:57] a word seed Oh Glory to God give the
[42:59] Lord a shout in the house hallelujah
[43:02] hallelujah hallelujah he made the world
[43:05] all the things that doesn't appear he
[43:07] made the world okay
[43:09] ask about something
[43:10] because the great Creator just sent
[43:13] forth his word and the word seed was
[43:16] dear before the real seed was ever
[43:19] formed and the word formed the seed
[43:26] do you get that
[43:28] the word seed was dear
[43:30] before the real seed was formed and the
[43:34] word
[43:35] formed the seed that's why he said my
[43:37] word shall not return unto me void but
[43:40] it shall accomplish the purpose that I
[43:43] said and fought to accomplish so when
[43:46] God said there'll be a bride
[43:55] oh give the Lord I shout there's gonna
[43:59] be a Bryce Revival I don't care how much
[44:01] deadness in this message how much the
[44:03] preachers don't want it there is going
[44:05] to be a bad Revival that's just saying
[44:08] the Lord Oh Glory to God what we see
[44:11] should make a church that will make a
[44:14] Revival that the seven tunnels of
[44:16] Revelation is being made manifest that
[44:19] will surely come to pass
[44:21] oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah
[44:24] hallelujah
[44:25] forget that part tonight the word seed
[44:29] was there before the real seed was ever
[44:31] formed and the word
[44:34] formed the seed
[44:36] everything under control to bring forth
[44:39] of its kind and when he put the seed in
[44:41] the Earth the sea can only comfort with
[44:43] the power of life within it to transform
[44:46] it from seed to plant or whatever it is
[44:48] his transforming power God put the seed
[44:52] in deer with the potentials of what he
[44:56] said it would be so when God put you he
[44:59] put potentials inside the you of what
[45:02] you could be what can the Lord and shout
[45:04] and before you become a real seed God
[45:07] had to make you a word seed or give the
[45:10] Lord some Praises tonight hallelujah
[45:12] hallelujah do you see it tonight all the
[45:15] potentials all the potentials was inside
[45:18] the seed Oh Glory to God do you believe
[45:21] that
[45:22] as long as it stayed in the right
[45:24] category you miss it it would be just
[45:27] exactly what God said it would be it had
[45:29] to be that way because he had made it
[45:32] way he made a channel that anything that
[45:35] stays in a channel in the line of the
[45:37] world will have to bring forth exactly
[45:40] like his word said it would do it's
[45:42] Channel exactly right Hallelujah and
[45:45] each here we go each one of those seeds
[45:48] has power in itself to transform itself
[45:52] into the species I desire to be that is
[45:56] what it must be because I have given
[45:59] every seed transforming power to make
[46:02] out of itself in its potential now to
[46:05] make it exactly what I wanted to be
[46:08] and God has never changed he's just the
[46:10] same today as he was then God is
[46:13] determined to do something oh praise the
[46:15] name of the Lord hallelujah praise God
[46:18] glory to God so if you don't have the
[46:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost what you have
[46:22] inside is a word seed you know what the
[46:24] secret is the word is in the bride you
[46:27] you have to believe that tonight if you
[46:29] don't have the Holy Ghost you have a
[46:31] word seed and the words he was there
[46:33] before the real seed and the spirit
[46:34] coming to make you a real seed or Glory
[46:37] will go but inside you tonight tell the
[46:39] devil is a liar inside you tonight you
[46:41] have a word seed I will tell you what
[46:43] your stinking rotten flesh think or feel
[46:45] or thought or do it has nothing to do

[46:57] laid in you before the foundation of the
[47:00] world come on give me an amen tonight

[50:50] real Holy Spirit to take the church in
[50:53] position
[50:54] so that the manufacturer

[50:58] some kind of manifestation money factor
[51:00] some kind of thing well you know the

[51:07] it's a manifestation could only bring
[51:09] them Revelations you know
[51:10] they can't wait
[51:12] data manufacture something initial
[51:14] evidence what kind of tummy right
[51:16] instead of waiting upon the Lord for the
[51:20] real manifestation of the resurrection
[51:22] of Christ making himself known among the
[51:24] people what did she do she went out and
[51:27] became pregnant with denomination
[51:29] and the message now get the number isn't
[51:31] they're not calling himself the
[51:32] nomination but is that the emotional
[51:34] spirit
[51:35] doing the same thing Innovation doing
[51:37] you have to come by we either come here
[51:39] they'll be like we and all kind of
[51:40] foolishness that is the kingdom of God
[52:02] false prophets false teachers false
[52:04] glasses in the message amen with sword

[52:09] okay the Lord some Praises glory to God
[52:13] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[52:15] Lord so we are ready yet I'm a scripture
[52:17] for that you know wait tell them seven
[52:19] Thunders utter the voices to that group
[52:22] [Music]
[52:26] they could do whatever they want to do
[52:31] oh my Hallelujah glory to God glory to
[52:36] God
[52:37] okay there we go
[52:39] what is transformation
[52:42] how do we get it
[52:44] asks the question
[52:45] are you gonna answer it what is
[52:47] transformation
[52:49] how do we get it what does the
[52:51] transformation all these are three
[52:52] questions God does it by the spirit of
[52:56] his word
[52:57] I just love that you see the letter kill
[53:00] it
[53:02] but the spirit give that life so there's
[53:04] a spirit of the word
[53:05] like we say truth is not truth until you
[53:07] get the spirit of Truth
[53:11] do you get that
[53:13] you have a knowledge of the truth but
[53:14] when you get the spirit of Truth
[53:16] that's it that's the truth
[53:18] oh Hallelujah you can talk brotherly
[53:20] kindness and whatever but unless they
[53:21] get the spirit of the kindness you only
[53:23] talk and talk you're talking to talk
[53:25] you're not walking you talk you gotta
[53:26] get the spirit of it
[53:27] so God by the spirit of the word he
[53:30] transformed he plants a seed and throws
[53:34] a spirit on it
[53:35] and it brings forth the product who
[53:38] plants it God does it who is A sower
[53:41] China man what's the seed the word Oh
[53:45] Glory the course when God reveals son of
[53:47] man in a cinnamon William Branham he
[53:49] came to bring seeds
[53:51] that's what people don't understand but
[53:53] Abraham came to bring seeds and he
[53:55] dropped the season books and things and
[53:57] walk away
[53:57] God took him home
[53:59] Hallelujah expecting some Gentile
[54:02] Warriors
[54:03] that will come behind him and say what
[54:06] the tape say to get the seeds into the
[54:08] People by these promises
[54:11] oh come on reach back to me somebody
[54:13] we were not supposed to preach our own
[54:15] message our own ideas our own
[54:16] interpretation we just supposed to say
[54:18] by Revelation and inspiration what the
[54:21] tape say
[54:22] that's what we're doing tonight
[54:24] because the secret is the word
[54:26] is in the pride or the seed is in the
[54:28] pride somehow it gets inside of you
[54:30] because we pump in their promises
[54:32] and as they catch it and they receive it
[54:34] is inside of you and you have that seed
[54:37] inside of you tonight a pyramid in
[54:39] mechanic form Oh Glory to God do you
[54:41] ever said you have a pyramid in a
[54:44] mechanic form or a Bible inside of you
[54:47] oh praise God
[54:49] he plants a seed he chose a spirit on it
[54:52] it brings forth the product his holy
[54:55] spirit transformed the seed word to be
[54:58] Vindicated of his kind
[55:00] what kind of seed are you that shows
[55:02] what's in you you can't hide it whatever
[55:05] you are on the inside shoes on the
[55:06] outside you can't keep from it you can't
[55:08] make that tree anything else but what it
[55:10] is the holy spirit
[55:12] transformed the seeds that's on the
[55:14] inside of it no matter what kind of seed
[55:17] it is it will transform it if it is evil
[55:19] it'll bring forth evil it was hypocrite
[55:21] it will bring forth hypocrite if it's a
[55:23] genuine word of God it'll bring forth
[55:25] genuine sons and daughter of God
[55:27] hallelujah when the Sea comes up it will
[55:30] produce sons and daughters
[55:31] of God all glory to God hallelujah
[55:36] praise God praise God praise God we
[55:37] believe that
[55:39] hallelujah hallelujah so do you believe
[55:41] here don't have the Holy Ghost ever
[55:42] waited inside of you do you believe that
[55:45] and it's impossible for you to miss this
[55:47] Holy Ghost
[55:48] because God must put a word see first
[55:51] before the real seed must come away see
[55:53] so you better thank God for that word
[55:54] see
[55:55] you can make yourself anything you can
[55:58] transform yourself into anything but
[55:59] that seed and you have trans woman power
[56:01] it's not right praise God praise God
[56:04] praise God hallelujah praise God the
[56:07] word seed was there before the real seed
[56:10] was ever formed
[56:11] and every promises seats every promise
[56:13] God gave out is a seed amen Peter said
[56:15] by these promises we become partakers of
[56:18] his divine nature
[56:20] oh my
[56:23] God are you ready to continue tonight
[56:26] all right let's go but there we say
[56:28] let's go let's go please explain
[56:32] The Mystery of the translation of the
[56:34] Bride
[56:36] question
[56:38] does that change our bodies let's say
[56:40] you know what I mean when I say that I
[56:42] don't mean this sacrilegious I don't
[56:43] mean to say hours I don't mean to say
[56:45] this church I mean I say every believer
[56:47] Abraham he was looking for a promised
[56:49] son that was promised him is that right
[56:51] and the church is looking for a promised
[56:53] son the bride is that right the bride's
[56:54] looking for the promised son before the
[56:57] promising could come to Sarah and
[56:58] Abraham their bodies had to be changed
[57:00] she was too old to have a baby she had
[57:02] no veins in her breast her breast was
[57:04] dried up her womb was wasn't flip tired
[57:06] she was still right she couldn't have a
[57:07] baby her heart was too old to stand a
[57:09] labor so what happened God changed her
[57:11] back to a young woman
[57:13] and he did Abraham the same thing
[57:15] because he said his body was good as
[57:17] dead he had to change their body in
[57:20] order to see the promised son and we
[57:22] cannot receive the promised son that is
[57:25] promised us today in these bodies that
[57:27] we live in these bodies are sin
[57:30] first conscience controls his body with
[57:32] CT smell feeling here it's just got us
[57:35] all scrupled up we reasoned on
[57:37] everything else but that new body
[57:48] this is
[57:50] question this first conscience
[57:53] controlled his body with sea taste well
[57:55] feeling here it's just got a scrupula
[57:58] we're reasoning everything else but that
[58:00] new body
[58:01] that comes from this born again
[58:05] it is that inside something that lives
[58:08] everybody understands saying amen
[58:10] remember I keep telling you the raptures
[58:12] inside out
[58:15] listen to this
[58:18] it is not this outside see tasteful
[58:22] smell here it isn't it is subject to
[58:24] death will die but the inside part of
[58:28] you
[58:29] dung in here inside
[58:33] that is the person that cannot die
[58:36] and that's the person that the New Life
[58:40] Starts from
[58:42] and from this new birth it builds
[58:45] another person
[58:47] in the image of this person you are
[58:49] around that life
[58:52] so there's Holy Ghost be talking about
[58:54] this new birth we're talking about is
[58:57] big foundation because
[58:59] that the lifebuils are wrong inside of
[59:03] you that is what's going up
[59:05] oh that's why that body got to be
[59:08] changed let me say it again I think this
[59:10] word saying again this is
[59:12] me so excited tonight
[59:15] it's not this outside City smells even
[59:17] here it is obviously the death and will
[59:19] die but the inside part of you don't in
[59:22] here inside that is the person that
[59:25] cannot die and that person that the new

[59:35] from this new bird this new life let's
[59:37] start from but you know are the word and
[59:39] when I see the word and when I see the
[59:41] message I have it I Baptist Doctrine
[59:44] the new birth
[59:45] is the word turn on in you
[59:48] the new birth is the word turning to
[59:50] Spirit and Power in you the new birth is
[59:53] the word activated
[59:55] by the spirit
[59:56] in you
[59:58] and he said and that's the person that
[1:00:00] the New Life Starts from from this new
[1:00:02] boot and it builds another person in the
[1:00:05] image of this person you are around that
[1:00:07] like they get it
[1:00:08] so potentially
[1:00:11] it's in here
[1:00:13] and what is it the word promise before
[1:00:17] the foundation of the world and a wrong
[1:00:19] dear only reflects the negative that
[1:00:22] will reflect the positive the word and
[1:00:24] the same thing or the translation of the
[1:00:25] Bride will be the same thing the word
[1:00:28] that's in you
[1:00:29] the body
[1:00:31] will materialize around that word
[1:00:37] so this translation is not outside in
[1:00:40] is inside out the body this new body
[1:00:44] that we have to take off with
[1:00:46] he said it will materialize around the
[1:00:48] world

[1:01:03] oil is the word turned to Spirit oh give
[1:01:06] the Lord some Praises they wasn't
[1:01:08] receiving the word how could he receive
[1:01:10] the spirit even not receiving the word
[1:01:11] my words are spirit and their life and
[1:01:16] the foolish version didn't have the
[1:01:17] atonement in its fullness

[1:01:21] bribe will have their tourmal in the
[1:01:22] fullness and that's the blood right

[1:03:17] have the seed of God
[1:03:19] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:24] I don't think I've ever read that before
[1:03:29] because you hear this one
[1:03:31] the prophecy how many here that doesn't
[1:03:34] have the seed of God the baptism of the
[1:03:37] Holy Ghost would you just raise your
[1:03:39] hand and say remember me brother Brandon
[1:03:40] that I will receive the Holy Spirit no
[1:03:43] you take the wood in your heart and
[1:03:44] believe it and you could look up and go
[1:03:46] up and look at the mirror and see where
[1:03:48] you are at so he call
[1:03:50] the seed of God
[1:03:52] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:55] and the word seed was there
[1:03:58] before the real seed
[1:04:00] and the word form the seed
[1:04:02] Hallelujah so God put the seed in your
[1:04:05] face

[1:04:19] Buffalo goes 24 hours they'll be lost
[1:04:20] that's a quote
[1:04:22] but baptism where
[1:04:25] you can have baptism in your body you
[1:04:27] gotta bring me a spirit but your soul
[1:04:30] and be lost that's not what we're
[1:04:32] talking about that's not what are you
[1:04:34] talking about if that Doctrine is
[1:04:36] correct then Peter didn't have to go in
[1:04:38] the upper room baptism
[1:04:57] that's right deception
[1:05:02] we read it the whole the dry season

[1:05:13] but I have no life in it behaving so you
[1:05:15] have no life on it Oh Glory to God take
[1:05:17] a dry seed and get up to the upper room
[1:05:19] the Bible said they hold themselves up
[1:05:22] haul themselves up my name's healing to
[1:05:25] go but they had to hold themselves up
[1:05:26] because Jesus said wait
[1:05:29] until the power of about Jew and perform
[1:05:31] on high wait in the city of Jews carry
[1:05:34] their weight fat but we know what
[1:05:35] happened
[1:05:37] so let me read it again
[1:05:39] you know I had a stick you know how many
[1:05:42] in here that doesn't have the seed of
[1:05:44] God the baptism of the Holy Ghost oh
[1:05:46] praise God all right

[1:05:52] nearly done
[1:05:54] Hallelujah there'll be a chocolate
[1:05:56] message one day you know to shake the
[1:05:58] old days
[1:05:59] I don't know if this is it
[1:06:02] but there we go
[1:06:04] Matthew 13 Jesus speaks verse 24.
[1:06:09] another parallel he put forth into them
[1:06:11] saying the Kingdom of Heaven is
[1:06:13] lightning under a man
[1:06:15] that sold good seed in this field
[1:06:17] and while men slept
[1:06:20] his enemy came
[1:06:22] and saw tears among the wheat
[1:06:26] and went his way
[1:06:27] and when the brain was sprung up and
[1:06:29] brought for fruit then appeared the
[1:06:31] tears also
[1:06:32] so the Servants of the householder came
[1:06:34] and said of them sir this not those who
[1:06:38] could see them that I feel from Winston
[1:06:40] at a tear
[1:06:43] he said unto them an enemy had done this
[1:06:45] deceiving them without them that we go
[1:06:48] and guarding them up he said
[1:06:50] got up the tears you root of the wheat
[1:06:52] with them
[1:06:53] let them boat
[1:06:55] grow together
[1:06:57] shout out together
[1:06:59] until the Harvest
[1:07:02] leave them any message
[1:07:04] until Harvest Time
[1:07:07] until Harvest Time
[1:07:10] leave them say they believe until
[1:07:11] Harvest Time
[1:07:13] watch let them watch again until the
[1:07:15] Harvest and in the time of the Harvest
[1:07:19] I will say to the Reapers gather each
[1:07:21] together first of tears and bind them in
[1:07:24] bundles to burn them but guarded the
[1:07:27] witch into my band
[1:07:29] that's busted
[1:07:31] from verse 36
[1:07:32] it reads
[1:07:34] then Jesus sent the multitude away
[1:07:38] and went into the house
[1:07:40] and his disciples came at him saying
[1:07:42] declare unto us the parable of the tears
[1:07:44] of the field
[1:07:46] so Jesus gives a parable everyone is
[1:07:47] there talking no this is this is private
[1:07:49] Revelation disciples this is Jesus
[1:07:51] disciples talking about
[1:07:53] and he answered and said unto them
[1:07:56] he that's what they could seed
[1:07:59] is the son of man
[1:08:00] Hallelujah he was talking about a man so
[1:08:03] I see he come and give them more details
[1:08:05] who doing this thing now he just threat
[1:08:07] the good seat is the son of man
[1:08:09] the field is the world The Good Seed at
[1:08:13] the children of the Kingdom
[1:08:20] [Music]
[1:08:23] Children of the Kingdom
[1:08:25] call them goat seed boy
[1:08:27] Hallelujah
[1:08:29] is the enemies
[1:08:33] that's what you are tonight you know oh
[1:08:36] God say that you know I'm not much of
[1:08:39] Flesh talking to you God said that you
[1:08:40] know I don't know what the hell telling
[1:08:42] you tonight but God said that you know
[1:08:43] oh come and preach back to me somebody
[1:08:46] Oh Glory to God the feel is the world
[1:08:49] the good see that the children of the
[1:08:51] Kingdom but the tears and the children
[1:08:53] of the wicked one the enemy that saw
[1:08:55] them is the devil the Harvest is the end
[1:08:58] of the world and the reapers are the
[1:09:00] angels as therefore the tears are
[1:09:02] guarded and building the fire so shall
[1:09:05] it be in the end of the world the son of
[1:09:07] man shall send for his angels and they
[1:09:10] shall guard out of his kingdom all
[1:09:12] things that offend and then I do
[1:09:14] iniquity I shall cast them to a fullness
[1:09:16] of fire they shall be willing on
[1:09:18] gnashing of teeth oh blessed be the name
[1:09:20] of the Lord let's go
[1:09:23] now he said the seed of God the word of
[1:09:26] God
[1:09:27] and Jesus said in a certain place the
[1:09:29] word is a seed amen amen and every
[1:09:31] single before of his kind now if the
[1:09:34] Christian
[1:09:35] the children of God the children of the
[1:09:38] Kingdom has become the seed of God then
[1:09:40] there must be the word of God and break
[1:09:43] it up if the children are the children
[1:09:45] at the seed then they have to be the
[1:09:47] word
[1:09:48] Oh Glory to God hallelujah watch watch
[1:09:52] then the seed of God then there must be
[1:09:54] the word of God the word of God
[1:09:56] manifested in the age that they're
[1:09:58] living in for the promising of that age
[1:10:00] God gave his word at the beginning and
[1:10:03] and each age has had a seed its time its
[1:10:08] promises note what he said each Aid has
[1:10:10] its seed
[1:10:11] it's time and its promises now we live
[1:10:14] through Luther's age
[1:10:16] Wesley age all along to the ages the
[1:10:19] Pentecostal age each age is given a
[1:10:21] promise of the word and the people of
[1:10:23] that age
[1:10:24] that manifests that promised word is the
[1:10:28] seed of that age not to talk
[1:10:31] over the people of that age that
[1:10:35] manifest the promised word is the seat
[1:10:38] of that age according to what Jesus said
[1:10:40] here they are the children of the
[1:10:42] Kingdom then you drink long deeper the
[1:10:45] manifestation
[1:10:47] of the Holy Spirit operating through his
[1:10:50] children is those seed of the Kingdom
[1:10:55] at that age
[1:10:56] these are things we know but God come to
[1:10:58] Freshly anointed
[1:11:00] and inspired to you or give the Lord
[1:11:03] some Praises hallelujah hallelujah glory
[1:11:07] to God so that's why Roman says
[1:11:09] therefore it is a faith that it might be
[1:11:12] by grace to the end the promise might be
[1:11:14] sure to all the seed not only to that is
[1:11:18] of the law but to that question of the
[1:11:19] fate of Abraham who is the father of us
[1:11:22] all oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:11:24] the promised children another after the
[1:11:27] flesh but the children of Promise is
[1:11:29] come to foreseed that's the scripture
[1:11:30] read is not right glory to God but
[1:11:33] around him these elect will not only the
[1:11:35] Eternal thoughts of God which are to be
[1:11:37] expressed in flesh and do season but
[1:11:39] these same elect was called by another
[1:11:41] name oh praise the name of the Lord for
[1:11:43] Oh Glory now do you believe that all
[1:11:45] right let me just skip here now
[1:11:52] now to Abraham and I see what the
[1:11:54] promise made he see it not as deceased
[1:11:56] the seeds of many
[1:11:57] but as of one which is Christ
[1:11:59] according to Romans 4 16. here we go we
[1:12:02] find that God has given a sure promise
[1:12:06] to all of Abraham's seed and Paul puts
[1:12:09] himself and all believers under the
[1:12:13] designation because he said Abraham who
[1:12:15] is the father of us all
[1:12:17] then he goes on not only to narrow down
[1:12:19] his definition but rather to finalize it
[1:12:22] in Galatians 3
[1:12:23] he identified the seeds singular with
[1:12:26] Jesus and conquered the children as
[1:12:29] children of promise
[1:12:31] and promise have to do with election
[1:12:34] or the chosen of God and that is exactly
[1:12:37] what we have been saying these were the
[1:12:40] Royal seed at the elect of God are the
[1:12:43] predestinated for known of God when the
[1:12:47] mind of God and his taught so God this
[1:12:50] is God tonight you are not just joining
[1:12:53] Church in the Community Church you come
[1:12:54] to this Tabernacle that is not so you
[1:12:57] have to be in the back part of God's
[1:12:58] mind God's thinking God's for knowledge
[1:13:02] I could see you getting free tonight I
[1:13:04] can see all the shell around you all the
[1:13:06] loudies say all the struggages
[1:13:08] everything getting Shaker for you

[1:13:15] in very plain language the true bride of
[1:13:19] Christ was in the mind of God eternally
[1:13:22] do not expressed until each came forth
[1:13:25] in the designated decree season
[1:13:28] as each member came forth it become
[1:13:30] expressed and took its place in the body
[1:13:33] thus this bride is literal
[1:13:36] spoken word seed bride now the word seed
[1:13:40] was there before the real seed here we
[1:13:44] go this bride is the literal spoken word
[1:13:48] see bright and though she is feminine in
[1:13:51] designation she's also called the body
[1:13:53] of Christ it is very apparent she ought
[1:13:56] to be called that for she was
[1:13:58] predestinated in him came from the same
[1:14:00] Source was eternal with him and is now
[1:14:03] manifesting God in a many-membered body
[1:14:06] whereas once God was manifested in one
[1:14:09] member even on our lord Jesus Oh Glory
[1:14:12] to God and this is where we wrap up the
[1:14:14] title tonight
[1:14:16] then

[1:14:23] manifesting the Sun
[1:14:25] and in Jesus dwell the fullness of the
[1:14:27] god bodily and that Eternal one was the

[1:14:32] the title of son even so we
[1:14:35] Eternal in his thoughts in our turn
[1:14:38] became the many members spoken with
[1:14:41] sedan manifest in flesh and those

[1:19:14] you know don't miss this part now then
[1:19:17] that thought become expressed God
[1:19:19] brought back Jacob
[1:19:21] because Jacob alone was seed

[1:19:27] had the seed that is why he had respect
[1:19:30] for the birthright
[1:19:33] oh he was a trickster but that's called
[1:19:35] every man he was a con man with a cook
