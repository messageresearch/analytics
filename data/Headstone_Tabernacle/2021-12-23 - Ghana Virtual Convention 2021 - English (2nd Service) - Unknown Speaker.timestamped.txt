[1:13:12] may god bless you
[1:13:14] the theme of this convention behold the
[1:13:17] bridegroom comments
[1:13:19] the selection time the separation time
[1:13:21] the time when the members of the bride
[1:13:24] should be set aside
[1:13:26] for the glorious day
[1:13:28] the time we are waiting on to be
[1:13:30] raptured
[1:13:31] may god bless you we can see all these
[1:13:33] signs that are coming to pass all over
[1:13:35] the world and anointing men of god are
[1:13:39] trying to put together everything they
[1:13:40] can to get the bride ready in this end
[1:13:43] time
[1:13:45] we shall first read in the message
[1:13:48] the first seal
[1:13:51] the first seal in paragraph
[1:13:53] 98 to 99
[1:13:59] 98 to 99 200 rather what am i trying to
[1:14:03] say
[1:14:04] i'm not trying to scare you
[1:14:06] worry you
[1:14:08] i want you to be on your toes
[1:14:10] be ready
[1:14:12] watching every minute
[1:14:15] quit your nonsense
[1:14:16] just get down to business with god
[1:14:20] because it's later than you think
[1:14:23] now
[1:14:24] you remember the true bride
[1:14:28] no there's a false bride
[1:14:31] we get that in revelation 17.
[1:14:34] she said i am a widow and i and i've
[1:14:36] known it of nothing
[1:14:38] you see sitting up on this scarlet
[1:14:41] colored beast and so forth the beast
[1:14:43] rather
[1:14:45] now that the true bride will be made up
[1:14:48] of thousands times thousands of people
[1:14:51] but it will be the elect out of every
[1:14:53] church age every time a message went
[1:14:56] forth
[1:14:57] and the people
[1:14:59] believed it and accepted it in all the
[1:15:01] light it was
[1:15:04] when they were sealed away
[1:15:06] until
[1:15:07] that day of redemption
[1:15:10] every time they believed it and accepted
[1:15:13] it in all the light it was
[1:15:16] glory be to god
[1:15:18] then they were sealed
[1:15:20] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:15:25] then in the message
[1:15:27] what was the holy ghost given for
[1:15:30] malachi 4 says
[1:15:32] same holy spirit that said the lutheran
[1:15:35] that sanctified the methodist that
[1:15:37] baptize the pentecostals
[1:15:39] he's now setting another coming of the
[1:15:41] lord jesus
[1:15:43] when it will be so
[1:15:44] powerful
[1:15:47] that body that is the bride
[1:15:50] will come into this group a church
[1:15:53] that will draw the rest
[1:15:55] of them
[1:15:57] from the grave
[1:15:59] there will be a resurrection
[1:16:01] that's what the holy ghost is for what
[1:16:03] is the holy ghost without us they cannot
[1:16:06] be made perfect
[1:16:08] they live in the in one day under that
[1:16:11] we live in another day
[1:16:13] when the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:16:15] the spirit of god will rest standard
[1:16:18] against it
[1:16:28] they couldn't make an atomic bomb
[1:16:30] or an automobile
[1:16:32] they didn't
[1:16:39] [Music]
[1:16:46] buy some dust and so forth
[1:16:48] and take some analysis and try to prove
[1:16:50] it
[1:16:51] to make infidels out of people
[1:16:53] but now
[1:16:56] when we need it and i believe that the
[1:16:59] bride all over the
[1:17:00] world the spirit of god raises the
[1:17:04] standard
[1:17:06] what is it is pouring it in spirit then
[1:17:08] those who are resting out yonder in the
[1:17:10] grave are under the artery of god as the
[1:17:13] scripture says are crying how long lord
[1:17:16] how long how much longer god is waiting
[1:17:19] on me on you
[1:17:22] the church is waiting on me and you
[1:17:25] adoption time
[1:17:26] when god can pour into us his fullness
[1:17:29] his power his resurrection
[1:17:32] that
[1:17:33] when the church and christ
[1:17:35] become so close together
[1:17:37] if christ becomes visible
[1:17:40] among us
[1:17:41] and raises the dead and we go into the

[1:23:45] message gets us ready for

[1:24:12] and listen to
[1:24:14] all the ministers that will speak in
[1:24:16] this meetings so god bless you
[1:24:18] shall we take our bibles as i read from
[1:24:20] first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13
[1:24:23] to 18.
[1:24:25] the bible said but i will not have you
[1:24:26] to be ignorant brethren concerning them
[1:24:29] which are asleep
[1:24:30] that ye sorrow not even as others which
[1:24:33] have no hope
[1:24:35] for if we believe that jesus died and
[1:24:37] rose again even so them
[1:24:40] also which sleep jesus will bring with
[1:24:42] him
[1:24:43] for this we say unto you
[1:24:46] by the word of the lord that we which
[1:24:48] are alive and remain unto the coming of
[1:24:50] the lord shall not prevent them which
[1:24:52] are asleep
[1:24:53] for the lord himself shall descend from
[1:24:56] heaven with a shout and let's put a lot
[1:24:59] of emphasis on that
[1:25:01] with the voice of the archangel and the
[1:25:03] trump of god and the dead in christ
[1:25:05] shall rise
[1:25:07] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:25:09] be caught up together with them
[1:25:11] in the clouds to meet the lord in the
[1:25:13] air so shall we ever be with the lord
[1:25:16] wherefore comfort one another with these
[1:25:19] words amen and that is the only event
[1:25:23] that we are waiting for
[1:25:25] the coming of the lord
[1:25:27] all the signs and wonders have been done
[1:25:29] already all the mysteries have been
[1:25:30] spoken already the only event that the
[1:25:33] church
[1:25:34] the bride is waiting for is the coming
[1:25:36] of the lord and paul said we should
[1:25:38] comfort one another with these words
[1:25:40] that jesus is going to come
[1:25:42] we are we are going to see him face to
[1:25:44] face
[1:25:46] we are going to be changed in a moment
[1:25:48] in a twinkling of an eye from this
[1:25:51] body into a glorious body to me the lord
[1:25:54] in the air and i'm an expectation
[1:25:57] for this change
[1:25:58] in the message the rapture abram said
[1:26:00] the first thing comes when he starts
[1:26:02] descending from heaven he says there is
[1:26:04] a shout
[1:26:05] amen
[1:26:07] the process of his coming is a shout a
[1:26:09] voice and a trump and the first thing is
[1:26:12] there's a shout so what is it
[1:26:15] it's a message to get the people ready
[1:26:18] the shout is to get the people ready
[1:26:21] that is the message that put us in
[1:26:23] readiness that's the message that gets
[1:26:25] you to trim your lump
[1:26:27] so a message come from first and said
[1:26:30] now lamb trimming time
[1:26:33] so the message comes forth and it's now
[1:26:35] what lump trimming time so rise and trim
[1:26:39] your alarms so

[1:26:48] sixth watch no but the seventh
[1:26:51] so behold the bridegroom comet
[1:26:54] rise and trim your lamps and they said
[1:26:56] some of them found they didn't have any
[1:26:58] oil in the alarms see but islam trimming

[1:27:03] praise god islam dreaming time the
[1:27:06] message has gone forth we've seen the
[1:27:08] signs we've seen the wonders we've seen

[1:27:30] those prophecies that can perfectly set
[1:27:33] in order for this day in the scripture
[1:27:35] we see a living right there so this
[1:27:38] message of the hour this message spoken
[1:27:41] through the lips
[1:27:43] of malachi false prophet
[1:27:45] was a shout message to get us prepared
[1:27:49] to train our alarms and get us prepared
[1:27:51] to leave this earth
[1:27:53] to get ready to go home
[1:27:55] praise god
[1:27:57] so if you are in this message this
[1:27:59] message is not just another preacher
[1:28:02] preaching something no
[1:28:03] it's a message to get you ready
[1:28:07] in the message here
[1:28:09] as i get ready to leave here escape
[1:28:11] heather i come quickly the prophet said
[1:28:14] christ declared himself to every nation
[1:28:17] and through every generation he's doing
[1:28:18] it today
[1:28:20] the church normally sets asleep
[1:28:23] the chest spiritual is awake
[1:28:28] church nominal is sleeping but the chest
[1:28:30] spiritual is awake
[1:28:32] the sleeping virgin has went off to
[1:28:34] sleep don't forget they were all virgins
[1:28:38] the sleeping virgin has what went off to
[1:28:41] sleep that would take the tribulation
[1:28:44] period
[1:28:45] so that sleep investment will go through
[1:28:47] the tribulation
[1:28:48] but the one that has the oil in your
[1:28:50] lamp is ready
[1:28:53] and you are the one that had the oil in
[1:28:55] your land
[1:28:56] you've had the short message
[1:28:58] you believed it
[1:29:00] and the voice is in the bride
[1:29:02] the voice is in you
[1:29:05] said blessed be the name of the lord
[1:29:08] so how i love the problem of the virgin
[1:29:10] you know the old cold oil lamps we used
[1:29:13] to have we never had like um lights till
[1:29:16] the the
[1:29:17] till just recently so and look here
[1:29:20] the oil is in the bottom of the lamp
[1:29:23] and there is a wig that draws it up
[1:29:26] now that week has to be a special made
[1:29:29] piece of material
[1:29:31] and the fire comes on the end of the
[1:29:33] week the prophet said here and now
[1:29:35] notice you couldn't put a pipe down in
[1:29:38] there and it would draw it up it won't
[1:29:41] come through iron-made
[1:29:42] man-made thins
[1:29:44] it's a special material the wig that
[1:29:46] goes into the lantern that goes into the
[1:29:49] lamp is a special made material you
[1:29:52] cannot just cut your clothes and put it
[1:29:54] in there it's a special made material it
[1:29:57] only comes through god's provided way
[1:30:00] and this message is providing that this
[1:30:03] shout message is providing that now
[1:30:06] listen to the prophet
[1:30:07] and the weak is faith
[1:30:10] so this message what is it doing it's
[1:30:13] pushing what faith in the believer
[1:30:16] that weak that special made material is
[1:30:18] faith
[1:30:19] not just any ordinary faith but perfect
[1:30:22] faith anointed faith and the weak is
[1:30:25] faith
[1:30:26] and the only thing that can pull the
[1:30:28] holy spirit
[1:30:30] into light is the holy ghost itself
[1:30:33] oh my and when you got your faith
[1:30:37] one end of it on fire
[1:30:41] on fire for the glory of god and the
[1:30:43] other dip into god's holy ghost oil
[1:30:45] there's going to be a shining light as
[1:30:48] certain as i'm standing in this pulpit
[1:30:51] and this day
[1:30:53] the bride who i believe this message of
[1:30:55] the hour who are feeding on this
[1:30:57] unfailing body word of this message of
[1:30:59] the hour
[1:31:00] that faith is built in the bride that's
[1:31:02] why the brahmanas could say that the end
[1:31:04] time con the end time message will meet
[1:31:06] the end time conditions
[1:31:09] because this message builds a special
[1:31:11] faith in the bride
[1:31:13] that is dip into the oil
[1:31:15] and when the fire is lit on the other
[1:31:18] end it never runs dry
[1:31:20] you can always trim your lamp in the
[1:31:22] darkest hour when the shower comes forth
[1:31:25] you are ready to trim your lamps amen
[1:31:28] he's sure and certain
[1:31:31] that when a man is built with faith
[1:31:33] built in that special material oh praise
[1:31:36] god and is dipped in that oil of the
[1:31:38] holy ghost
[1:31:40] his light will never go off
[1:31:42] but if you got it down in all mixed up
[1:31:44] with water
[1:31:45] today you are in shape tomorrow you
[1:31:47] don't believe the message the next
[1:31:48] department if you got it all mixed down
[1:31:50] with water you know what it will do it
[1:31:52] will sputter
[1:31:54] you can never trim your lump
[1:31:56] it takes a total surrendering
[1:31:59] to this message
[1:32:01] because this message supports
[1:32:04] the lamb
[1:32:06] and once the the the weak is dipped in
[1:32:09] the oil it builds a special fate in you
[1:32:12] that you can always trim your lamp
[1:32:14] that's what the matter with the lamps of
[1:32:16] today of many they are sputtering
[1:32:19] amen
[1:32:20] because today they believe tomorrow they
[1:32:22] don't believe but we thank god
[1:32:25] that there is a group of people
[1:32:28] who are wise virgins
[1:32:30] they are pure
[1:32:32] they believe this message of their hour
[1:32:33] it is totality
[1:32:35] in its fullness
[1:32:37] and nothing
[1:32:38] can change them amen
[1:32:41] so we thank god
[1:32:43] for the message
[1:32:44] which is putting us in readiness
[1:32:46] for the coming of the lord
[1:32:48] friends loved ones the only thing left
[1:32:50] is the coming of the lord
[1:32:52] and you have to be ready and the only
[1:32:54] preparation to make you ready is this
[1:32:56] message of the hour
[1:32:58] that's the only thing that you can use
[1:32:59] to trim your lamp nothing else apart

[1:33:04] should bless you
[1:33:05] god bless the convention god bless every

[2:07:47] by the way the revival washed
[2:07:50] down
[2:08:03] and
[2:08:04] while we were ministering
[2:08:06] the message was just quite quiet
[2:08:10] for he believed nothing of what we were
[2:08:13] seeing
[2:08:15] for his own past to believe that
[2:08:18] william pronoun
[2:08:20] he is the person of the holy spirit
[2:08:23] that william pronoun
[2:08:25] is jesus christ that william

[2:08:48] rainbow

[2:08:53] the person will say something against
[2:08:56] against these speeches
[2:08:58] he will die right away
[2:09:02] and then one day he came to see me
[2:09:05] and then we were speaking
[2:09:08] and i told him
[2:09:11] about what you believe
[2:09:14] and all those pictures
[2:09:16] it is the devil
[2:09:20] [Applause]
[2:09:31] and then he was waiting to see if i
[2:09:33] would die right away
[2:09:37] and he went to sleep
[2:09:40] early in the morning he came to knock at
[2:09:42] my door
[2:09:44] and i told him i'm still alive
[2:09:46] and then i opened the door
[2:09:49] and he just saw me alive
[2:09:53] and then he changed his doctrine
[2:09:56] and we baptized him again
[2:09:59] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[2:10:02] and he called his pastor
[2:10:06] he said i don't believe again what i
[2:10:09] used to believe before and he said what
[2:10:12] happened
[2:10:13] and then he gave back the testimony and
[2:10:16] the pastor said

[2:10:21] and we went back
[2:10:24] we went we went to congo

[2:10:29] about two days
[2:10:32] and we told him
