come Lord to make things right this morning Lord we prostrate ourselves at the throne of grace this morning we don't want to live a life of sin we don't want to live a life of shame we don't want to

caught up in the spirit of Christmas and the spirit of family we come as the family of God this morning to get into the spirit of the coming of the Lord may you lift us up this morning Where We Belong Lord we don't belong in depression We Don't Belong not knowing where we stand We Don't Belong not being sure of what we are called to do but father make our stand firm this morning because we receive a kingdom that cannot be shaken we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved father Lord I feel a sense of heaviness with some of the people in here this morning Lord we rebuke that heaviness we rebuke the tiredness we rebuke the laziness we rebuke whatever condition they may have come in with this morning Lord because we want to make way for the Holy Ghost itself to minister to the ears of Salvation may you speak to our hearts Lord some people woke up this morning and didn't pray Lord Lord they repent for that this morning we want to take some time before the service Lord gets into full care to acknowledge that you are king of kings and you are Lord of lords and you are the rose of Sharon the lily of the valley we acknowledge you as our healer this morning we acknowledge you as our savior father you are the reason for the season Lord may you take your place on the throne of our hearts may you step behind this desk this morning take me completely out of the way and speak to your children Lord may this be a service we will never forget Lord as this year comes to the closing Pages Lord for this book to be finally closed on6 Lord may we close this year Lord with a note in our books that did not our hearts burn within us as he spoke to us along the way father we commit the service into your hands we commit the musicians into your hands we commit the elders the deacons the trustees the ministers the helps the governments those on the internet Lord we commit Lord Lord we say forgive our past Lord and bless our future as a as a new season Dawns Upon Us father Lord may we enter into wave after wave of the Holy Ghost wave after wave of Power Wave After Wave of glory Lord in this season may we see a manifestation of every prophet of every promise that was spoken by the prophet may we witness the sick being healed and the blind eyes opening and the cripples walking father because this is the time of the manifestation we commit the service into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the church says and the church says amen you may be seated for a few minutes everybody feeling fine amen everybody come to the house of the Lord to worship this morning and to make your calling an identification show I love what the pastor says at times he said if I lose my teeth I'll gum the devil am Hallelujah and many times you hear stories of blind people coming to church and they ask them why are you coming to church you don't see anything he say I want to let the devil know whose side I'm on I can't hear anything but I still want to let the devil know whose side I'm on not feeling a strong as I would like to feel but I want the devil to know whose side I am I may be wounded but I still want the devil to know whose side I'm on I may have lost my foot but I want the devil to know whose side I'm on my wing may be broken but I still want the devil to know whose side I'm on I may have been I may have had a rough year this year but I still want the devil to know whose side I'm on I may have lost friends and lost favor and lost family but I still want to let the devil know who side I'm on because as you may be seated I don't want to get ahead of myself but greetings in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ and welcome to the last service the last Sunday service of 2016 just to make some announcements uh there will be no Sunday service next Sunday Lord willing to close out this year there will just be two Thursday services this Thursday ahead of us next week Thursday both at the Tabernacle and our all Year's night service which will be on the 31st Saturday at 10 p.m. in addition this week ahead of us brother and myself will'll be flying out to South Africa to the convention hosted by brother Raymond Thompson so we are under great expectation with that do remember us in prayer both to travel and for God to break out our Revival in South Africa uh brother Raymond has been such a blessing to us for the last two years coming to the convention so we are very honored to fly over there to join with him as he hosts his convention over there as well so may you remember us in prayer and throughout this whole season that is Christmas and everything that comes with it make sure you keep Jesus as a center of your joy the Center of Your Action I believe it was last year I was speaking uh in a similar time as this and I said it's so many people they spend time trying to do their painting and they apply their paint on their houses and they get things in order because they want things to be in a certain position for the Christmas and I want to know how many people were applying the token because it's easy to apply the paint and apply this and apply you want to put the decorations and you want to make sure you have the the ham or the turkey or the whatever and at the end of the day you don't want to miss out applying the token because that's the real reason has been the message not just in December it's the message in January it's the message in February in March in April in May June is the message every single Sunday apply the token but the brandom told the brandom Tabernacle don't just hear the messenger don't just say I believe the message but do what the messenger says which is to apply the token apply it all over your house apply it in your bedroom apply it on your life apply it in your car apply it all over you just apply the token because that's the only thing that will last can the church say Amen so I do want to recognize and appreciate brother O's message last week how many appreciate him for his burden for his labor what a masterpiece that was so I'm under great expectation for God to speak to us today I am totally dependent upon him thank you musicians you appreciate brother Anthony with the worship service so if you have your Bibles would you turn with me to three portions of scripture I have quite a bit of reading but I do want to get it all in so that we can deal with the subject at hand I want to start in the New Testament then we'll go to the Old Testament so we're going to read from Hebrews chapter 12 and we also going to be reading from First Kings 17 and 18 Hebrews 12 and verse 25 see that you refuse not him that speaketh for if they escape not to refuse him that spake on Earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from Heaven whose voice then shook the Earth but now he had promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signifi it the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken May remain wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire and reading from First Kings 17 and reading verse 1 First Kings 17 and reading verse one and Elijah The tishbite Who who was of the inhabitants of Gilead said unto Ahab as the Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I stand there shall not be due nor rain these years but according to my word and reading First Kings 18 and reading verse one we going to read a bit here I may stop and then have us finish it but let's start and it came to pass after many days that the word of the Lord came to Elijah in the third years saying go show thyself unto Ahab and I will send rain upon the Earth and Elijah went to show himself unto Ahab and there was a sore famine in Samaria and Ahab called Obadiah which was the governor of his house now Obadiah feared the Lord greatly for it was so when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the Lord that Obadiah took and 100 and hid them by 50 in a cave and fed them with bread and water and and Ahab said unto Obadiah go into the land unto all Fountains of water and unto all Brooks per Adventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive that we lose not all the beasts so they divided the land between them to pass throughout it Ahab went One Way by himself and Obadiah went another way by himself and Obadiah was in the way behold Elijah met him and he knew him and fell on his face and said art thou that my Lord Elijah elah and he answered him I am go tell thy Lord behold Elijah is here what a way to introduce yourself tell your boss that Elijah is here and and he said what have I sinned this is Obadiah speaking that thou would has delivered thy servant into the hand of Ahab to slay me as the Lord thy God liveth there is no Nation or Kingdom whether my Lord hath not sent to seek thee and when they said he is not there he took an oath of the kingdom and nation that they founded not and now thou sayest go tell thy Lord behold Elijah is here and it shall come to pass as soon as I am gone from thee that the spirit of the Lord shall carry thee with I know not and so when I come and tell Ahab that he cannot find thee he will slay me but I servant I thy servant fear the lord from my youth was it not told my Lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the Lord how I hid a 100 men of the Lord's Prophet by 50 in a cave and fed them with bread and water and now thou sayest go tell thy Lord behold Elijah is here that he may slay me and Elijah said as the Lord of hosts liveth before whom I stand I will surely show myself unto him today so Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him and Ahab went to meet Elijah and it came to pass when ABAB saw Elijah and a that Ahab said unto him art thou he that troubleth Israel and he answered I have not troubled Israel but but thou and thy father's house in that ye have forsaken the Commandments of the Lord and thou Hast followed bam now therefore send and gather to me all Israel unto Mount Carmel and the prophets of Baal 450 and the prophets of the Groves 400 with eat at Jezebel's table so Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel and gathered the prophets together unto Mount C and Elijah came unto all the people and said how long hold ye between two opinions if the Lord be God follow him but if bail then follow him and the people answered him not a word may the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated am so I have a title this morning and my title is the final showdown Hallelujah and I have a subject placed by fire into the kingdom that cannot be moved and an inspiration let the god that answer by fire let that God be God Amen everybody feeling fine amen So today we're going to talk about the fire we're going to talk about the Holy Ghost we're going to talk about the time of the manifestation of the Holy Ghost and we're also going to talk about the final showdown because the fire is coming to claim individuals into the kingdom the claiming is not by the church the claiming is not by the group The claiming is not by the pastor the claiming is by fire because the fire of God will place you into a kingdom his kingdom a kingdom that cannot be moved a kingdom that cannot be destroyed a kingdom that always was that always is and always will be a kingdom with a king who is the I am that I am he's the king of kings and the Lord of lords and today the Holy Ghost charity itself is here to place individuals into that Kingdom the Bible said and we read everything that can be shaken will be shaken churches will shake ministers will shake church members will shake politicians will shake the government will shake the police force will shake the criminals will shake men's heart failing for fear but the false anointed they will shake also your family will shake but not you fear not little flock it is my father's pleasure good pleasure to give unto you something give unto you a kingdom and entire Kingdom where he is king and you are priest and you are princes and you are sons of the king so we have a reason this morning to smile we have a reason this morning to be happy don't tell me that I should be sad I mean not have money in my pocket right now but my father is the king he is the king of kings he is the Lord of lords he is the Majesty he is bigger than your problem he is bigger than your trial he is bigger than and your situation he called you for a purpose for such a time as this for a final showdown oh we have waited a long time for this but I hear the clock ticking coming to an end uh we are about to break from time into eternity but before we leave this place there's going to be one more ride uh there's going to be one more battle every day is a battle when you wake up in the morning it's a battle when you lift your hand it's a battle but brandom said whenever you lift your hands you are Defying Gravity it's a battle it's a showdown When you pray it's a battle when you worship it's a battle that's why the Bible says bring the sacrifice of praise praise is a sacrifice because it's a sacrifice to worship when you don't feel like worshiping it's a sacrifice to lift your hands when you feel there's no reason to do so but you bring a sacrifice of praise into the house of the Lord uh and you offer up incense to him uh because you acknowledge that we are creatures of Eternity we are trapped in time uh but one of these days time will be no more time will finish can the church say Amen but before we leave this place uh there's going to be another Showdown uh God loves a showdown uh the devil made the mistake way back before the beginning way back there he got angels to worship ship him and there was war in heaven and there was a showdown in heaven it started there but we were represented here with Michael so when Michael drew his sword sons who rotated off of the presence of God who were Gene attributes of God who had the DNA from God they were compelled to draw their swords also there was no question about it it was Instinct for us uh because we are just like God we are just like our father so when Michael drew his sword you drew your sword also the devil wants you to forget that you are a warrior he wants you to forget that you are a fighter he wants you to forget that you are a trained soldier this is not new to you this is not strange to you this is what you were doing where was th when I lay the foundations of the earth and the morning Stars sank together and the children of God Shout for Joy this is what we were doing worship is not strange to us giving God praise is not foreign to us this is what we do this is who we are we are born to worship we are born to give him praise uh we are born to kick the devil out of our homes out of our families uh out of our bodies cancer has got to go diabetes has got to go sickness has got to go why because this is what we do we cast Devils out we cast demons out in Jesus name come the church say [Applause] amen hallelujah this is the last service for the year the last Sunday service so I'm going to give it all I got got I'm going to give it everything I got I want to let the devil know I don't care how January was how February was how march was how April was but this service is my service he may have had a voice all of this year but today it's my turn to say something the bride will have a voice the bride will speak and what we speak will come to pass so this morning we are prophesying the time is at hand uh s is this the time this morning we are prophesying there will be a Revival for the young people all you young people who are halfway in and halfway out we are speaking for you this morning God is going to arrest you he's going to arrest you he's going to lock you up uh he's going to put you in prison a prison of love that you can't even get out if you want to yes if you are sick in here this morning we are speaking a word your healing is happening right now and not even waiting for 2017 your family they already coming right now they don't even know it but they are being pulled just like Lazarus Lazarus come forth backslider come forth sick person come forth you who are depressed come forth God is able you may be seated you may be seated if you can I want you to understand the backdrop in First Kings 17 Elijah said not even due or rain is going to come unless I call for it and Elijah disappeared he went into safety he went into where God led him to be and King Ahab looked to the east looked to the West look to the north look to the South he couldn't find him they searched he's trying to know who is called who is predestinated but he can't find you because you're under the blood Elijah was covered he was protected he was in training he was in preparation but in 18 it switched Ahab is going around his business and Elijah is ready to display who he is he is ready to come out of hiding you can't hide for long this morning we coming out to hide in the devil beat you up and you went into hide in but not this morning we are getting the permission by the word to come out of hiding you may be seated so Elijah comes out of hiding because we spoke a couple weeks ago God has never changed his strategy so when God wants to do something he could use hiding he could use manger he could use the burning bush he could use the walls of Jericho he could do whatever he want but when it's time for you to come out it's time for you to come out so Elijah taking a stroll he knows Ahab is going to be out there he knows over is going to be out here he know they're looking for him he said go tell your master that Elijah is here he pull out his business car yes this is that Elijah that Elijah he's been searching for he don't need to sent you a Hunting Party he don't need to look no more I've made myself available you may be seated over said no no no no no no no noall when I go and tell Ahab that you said that you are here but the moment I turn around you will disappear and go I don't know where and he will kill me amen Elijah said not this time it's time for a showdown the time for hiding is over the time for playing church is over the time for warming a church bench is over the time to say I'm in the message is over the time to be a rumor is over the time to be a name you hear from the distance is over this is going to be a showdown if God is God then serve him let the God and answer by fire let that that's the time we're talking about let the God and answer by fire you may be seated not answer by convention not answer by the type of service not answer by what is spoken but leted to God because the only Vindication the only evidence of The Showdown is when God himself answers and sends fire into your life that nobody could take away send fire in your house that the devil can and fight that Vindication is not from the ministers Association that Vindication is not from your family but it's God who sends the fire and this morning we say send the [Applause] fire can the church say Amen oh hallelujah hallelujah but a kind I didn't even check what time I came into the pulpit hallelujah amen amen amen fire is a powerful thing you know it that's why I love how God operas brother the Clarens because sometimes he have to force force the issue to get us to move where he wants us to move the prophet relates a story one time I think he saw a turtle and he say take a stick and tried to push it and it didn't move triy to throw something and it it didn't move but when he lit a fire Turtles had to do no more turtles have to move because fire do cause a response and some of you who don't want to lift your hands we take stick and try to push you we take stuff and try to thr it but when the fire comes you can't help yourself we say Lord send the fire may he answer by fire this morning all these years in the message what you need is an answer of fire fire in your soul fire in your mind all the things you're struggling to do and you're trying to hold on and you're trying to make it but let fire drop down in there that lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh you trying to be somebody all of that disappears because the fire Our God the Bible say is a consuming fire he will destroy everything just let go this morning and let the fire of God take a whole of your [Applause] life hallelujah hallelujah a kingdom that cannot be moved a kingdom that cannot be moved cannot be shakened amen so many times in our lives we try to rely on these props I call it the props in our lives amen we rely on the prop of our job you know once you have your job you know you can make it we lie on the prop of our savings we may lay on the prop of our family and God has a way of removing these props so that we could lie on him amen and rely on him because he's the only one that cannot be shaken he's the only one that cannot be moved man cannot produce that only God could produce that can the church say Amen so The Headstone is coming the stone of Power is coming to break up every man-made system to break up every conception that you have but over it he was preaching on inspiration and he was preaching from this Cote last week he said I believe that the bride of Christ is called amen I believe she is sealed in the kingdom of God I believe the mechanics is there they're waiting for the Dynamics that will take her off the earth into glory in the Rapture I believe it with all my heart yes sir he won't know how he's going to do it but he shall we don't know how he's going to do it but he shall do it he is the Dynamics we just become members of the machine of his body forming ourselves into his image and see him uniting himself with us in his works with his love gifts as he hands them to us just before the wedding supper we are waiting we are watching for that can the church say amen and the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit that we have worked in a small measure while The Headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when the head and body unites together the full power somebody say full power the full power of the Holy Ghost will raise her up just exactly like that even the dead that's dead in Christ for hundred of years will rise in the beauty of his Holiness and take a flight to the skies but the B said the Dynamics is the holy spirit so this final showdown that we are talking about it's not going to be your strength it's not going to be your might but it'll be the Dynamics the Holy Ghost itself taking control of the mechanics the body is itself and when the two come together and begin to move in harmony Ahab the devil for all these years every age every generation he felt he made it he beat up Elijah he beat up Joshua throughout it the dead they fall to the ground but in this time the power that's coming will raise the dead out of the graves the power that's coming will cause a Rapture to take place the power that's coming will reach to your family that can't understand what's going on on but this power could not be stopped I see a stone cut out without the hands of man and that stone of Power is coming can the church say Amen you may be seated in the very first recorded message that brother brandham preached in on April 12th 1947 listen to brother bram's words in the message faith is the substance so he said I wish to speak to you tonight just for a little bit of time and teach the word of Fai that you might know how listen carefully how to approach God Amen there's many of these great and deep subjects that people claim that they know much about and when it comes down to the final showdown they know very little of it now that's true we are going to find out in a few of these things tonight amen so brother brandham saying there are many deep things that you could preach and you could investigate but when it really comes down to it it comes up to the final showdown and very few know about it so we are talking about showdowns this morning a showdown what is it it's a confrontation amen it's a fight amen it's a face off it's a standoff life is a showdown the Bible is a book of showdowns but I believe this morning the bride is getting ready for the final showdown Hallelujah we live in a modern age now but years ago in the days of the Wild West there used to be showdowns we'll meet you at 12:00 noon and one man walk up the dusty road and come into a showdown and he stands up on this side and on the other side the other one walks and they would face office a showdown and the whole neighborhood is there the whole community and they would say draw and whoever draws and shoots first wins a showdown what a way to go but life is about showdowns sometime ago but over preach a message you say you do what you have to do until you find out what you are called to do many of us we don't like showdowns we don't like confrontation but over also said your passion for victory must be stronger greater than your fear of defeat I'll say those two again you do what you have to do until you find out what you are called to do and your passion for victory must be stronger greater greater than your fear of defeat and he also said Satan cannot get stronger but you can I love that one Satan cannot get stronger but you can so in this battle this showdown that we are talking about it's time that you lift your head up but brother Isaac I don't have the best prayer life that has nothing to do with it right now The Showdown is coming and you are being called out this morning you being called out to make an appearance you being called to represent the faith that was once delivered to the Saints you are being called out to be identified you could hide no longer in the shadows every individual in the bride is being called out to be identified oh those Dark Ages when the Christians were burnt at the Stak and fed to Lions it was easy to make your identification known those days were easier you know it might sound rough to go to the Lion's then then and stuff you know but it's either you were lion food or not lion food all right it's either you a real Christian or not a Christian there were many people I'm sure say you know what I'm good enough enough I'm good I I'll pray in secret you had no identification but in this age is easy for people to stay hiding like Adam did hiding in Eden hiding here hiding there hiding in the church hiding in the crowd but we're talking about a showdown where you could be identified by the token itself the brandom said the token must be displayed that the people around you could see it so if you're trying to hide in the church or hide in the message the clock is ticking down let this service put a Line in the Sand with you hiding who you are hiding where you come from hiding your testimony hiding who you are in God can the church say Amen the more I study the word the more I realize that God loves Showdown some of us we don't like conflict we don't like confrontation we don't like the face of anybody but God is different he Delights in the opportunities to prove himself can the church sayen when you read Genesis there was Darkness but there was a showdown and God said let there be light and light and darkness for and light one from all back there it's been a showdown can the church say Amen when Moses went down to Egypt and he began to speak he said I'm going to show you a sign and they dropped the rod and and the devil responded Janice and jambes throw their rods down what was that it was a showdown if Moses didn't hear from God he would have said listen I'm gone I'll come back the next time when I come back with something different but no it was a showdown it's a battle you think the devil's going to make it easy for you no he's going to fight for every inch of ground but God has never changed his strategy you are going to overcome you are going to make it you're going to have a testimony oh blessed pet the name of the Lord if youve ever seen a boxing match you may be seated there's a certain energy but the brand was an amateur boxer amen amen can the church say Amen but BR was an amateur boxer and there's a certain atmosphere when you're in a boxing match on one side it's one person about to fight and usually on the other side it's some kind of champion somebody who's being challenged in other words a showdown has a challenger and the person being challenged and in a box and match is the defending Champion or the person who thinks they are winning or whatever it is and then there's a person coming against it so right now this morning it's what you have been fighting all these years your cancer your tumor your disease your bind battles your fears and all these years it's day in your life but this morning you are getting an encouragement to come to The Showdown because but the brandom said you have to say boo back listen God is not coming to just take care of your battle when you are a soldier you know he's coming to give you strength to fight your battle but Abram said it like this he said you have to do something for something to happen that's why if you shall say to this mountain be moved you can't sit there and say I'm waiting on God to come and do something no you got to say something you got to speak to your Mountain you got to speak to your house you got to speak to your family and then watch God come to back it up oh you don't hear me this morning stop being lazy stop sitting back saying I'm waiting for God to deal with it what are you doing speak to the mountain why cry Moses speak and move forward you have been given a commission you have been called as a soldier in such a time as this can the church sayen Oh My My My I feel religious this morning on the left corner is the devil and he's jumping up and down he's been winning all kind of battles for all these years he thinks he could win this one there was showdowns and battles and but one time somebody came into the ring who was a little different he wasn't popular he didn't look handsome he didn't speak nice but when he came to the ring the devil thought this was just going to be like every other battle when the devil fought Moses he won he got Moses to not make it to the promised land he got Abraham to lie he got David to do this and to do that but when this one came into the ring and the devil thought he was like everybody else he said this is just like another Showdown but here comes a lonely little savior named Jesus and he comes walking into the ring and the devil try to test him he give a little jab if thou be and Jesus said come on now come on now it is written the devil say well that's a different one he Pro him again he said it is also written Pro him again and then Jesus walk out the ring the devil doesn't know what's going on the devil doesn't know what's happening this boxer is boxing different this box is a little different from everybody else he trying to pull he say pull his file hallelu let me understand this one we can't find nothing against him there was no sin in this one he see I got to find somebody to pin on this one the devil had to use all kind of attct he said call him be call him this but Jesus uttered not a word because he was preparing to give a knockout blow to the devil the devil had never fell before but the p said when Jesus was in the wilderness with the devil Satan was electrocuted with some FS that he never forgot but Jesus wasn't finished with him yet can the church say Amen Jesus battled and battled and battle and then on the cross when Jesus said it is finished the devil got one of those moves that he didn't understand him it looked as if Jesus was knocked out cold and the referee start to count one 2 3 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and the devil lift his hands up it looked as if Jesus was finished the devil say let's call the biggest party we ever had because this one was the biggest fight I ever had it was round after round usually I could knock out somebody in one round in two rounds in three rounds but this man give me a fight to the end let's celebrate but while the devil is celebrating Here Comes boxer who did something no boxer had ever done before here comes a boxer who knocks on the door and he said I need to get inside of there they say you're not invited no I don't need to be invited and Jesus walked in there and took the keys of death and took the keys of hell and he gave those keys to his bride he said Don't Fear debt don't fear hell Don't Fear the grave you are just like me because I live you are going to live also I'm the resurrection and the life but listen this battle that I started this battle that I give the devil I'm going to leave it to somebody special to finish this so down is going to be like no other battle Abraham couldn't do this Elijah couldn't do this Moses couldn't do this Peter couldn't do this Matthew couldn't do this I'm going to leave a lady to do it come on now a little lady in 2016 she's going to be training for the final knockout punch can the church say amen for the final showdown for the final battle Satan has never been knocked out completely before but this time he's going to get something he never expected from a group of people he never expected but the brandom said when Peter walked out of the upper room the devil didn't move but when he went by the gate called beautiful and said silver and gold I don't have but such as I have I give to you the devil HD the alarm switch and say I talk we kill Jesus who is doing all of that and there's Peter there's James there's John there's Paul come on now irenius Martin Columba Luther Wesley All Through the Ages the devil just looking saying who are these people but in this age there'll be a group of people who will not see death they will not die they will oh come on now Church they are getting ready for the final showdown the war that started in heaven is about to come to an end can the Church Say Amen oh Hallelujah so lift yourself this morning this year is over and with this year we are seeing cancer is over we are seeing blind eyes are over we are seeing diabetes is over we are saying no praise demons are over no prayer life that's over being up and down that's over we are standing Toe to Toe and saying boo back to the devil we're saying we're going to pray we are going to worship we're going to have a prayer life we are going to cause a Revival we're going to have a Revival it's going to start with me it's going to start in my house I'm declaring war this morning this is Elijah tell them Elijah is here tell them the sons of God are back tell them the time has come for the manifestation of the sons of God oh hallelujah hallelujah oh my my my my my but the P said there's been churches churches Brides bride churches churches Brides but there got to come one there's got to come a real Pride uh who there has got to come a real bride it must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the Dynamics of it makes the church live move in the power of the Resurrection it's going to be resurrection power in you it's going to be Resurrection listen you can go be if God if you God has you here this morning is because your work is not complete don't let me hear you you want to die and are ready to go there's no ready to go if God could heal a 90y old man and he could be shouting God could heal you I don't care where you at you could don't don't you don't hear you talk about giving up I don't care what the doctor says I don't care what anybody says God is God and he could extend your life he could give you Grace to fight he could heal you he you don't let the devil bind you you may be seated that's what a showdown is you know when the devil raises up in front of you and your natural response is to go and hide and say let me call the pastor let me call the assistant pastor let me call the Elders to pray but your instinct as a soldier is you supposed to be always ready inseason out of season friend or no friend on the job in the home in the school on the road though 10,000 fall on my right side of the de Ang could be walking down the road but you know you have the token on the inside you just display your token say listen this is who I am the dead Angel has to pass you by don't you know you are predestinated for a special [Applause] Mission oh Hallelujah so there's been churches churches bries bries and they have been Showdown showdowns battles battles Showdown but there must come a final showdown there's got to come a point where you break past the sound barrier as it were and when you break past the sound barrier there's nothing to hold you back anymore brother Knights there's nothing to keep you bound anymore there's nothing to keep your prayer life down anymore there's no devil in hell could hold you back once you pass the sound barrier but the BR said there's a lot of vibrations there's a lot of shakings there's it feels like the wings want to fall off it feels like the inures want to come off but when you break past that barrier that sin barrier that out barrier brother it's unlimited the potential that's in the church it's unlimited what's locked up inside of you brother random said in the message Ministry explained he said what's the matter is we Christians get too weak when it comes to The Showdown my God my God that's the prophet speaking we get too weak when it comes to The Showdown if it's real it's real if it's not it's not he said and if I didn't believe him with all my heart and know it was real I would not be here tonight but I believe it and not only that I know it's real and that's why I've always said in my heart I want a reality I am I'm not just here to have church I'm not here just no it's got to be more than that there are many churches there are many groups but I want the reality of the Living God [Music] Hallelujah that's what I'm looking for for God to step into homes and heal marriages uh because he is God uh he is Jehovah Gyra he is Jehovah shama he is Jehovah Rafa that's God he promised to take care of you he promised to heal you he promised to give you the victory you better believe it and stand up and claim it it's [Applause] yours Hallelujah there's a difference between showdowns and a final showdown you know brother random said if you don't testify you going to backslide you know he said that right yes so some of you who never tell anybody about Jesus hallu God is fair you know he's just you know and he is tied to his own word and he makes no excuses so there's no Bly there's no free pass with God you have to be able to testify of God and the reason I'm saying I remember when I was in secondary school I got in a showdown with somebody in my class about the Bible and he chopped me to shreds we going back and forth on scripture this mean this and that mean this and this and this and and after that Showdown I felt so defeated because I went with a motive to convince him that this thing was truth but he was more trained than I was in scripture so he was like what this mean and what this mean and and for many people in the message we know the message but we don't know the Bible so when they pull scriptures it's like but brother brandham said this like who is Brother brand so you got to know the scripture that's why even the prophet said back to the Bible because the Bible is God's word The Prophet's mission was to bring a light and shine under the direction of the Holy Spirit into where it's written and to tie up the Loose Ends and to connect the pieces so that we can rightly understand the Bible because the Bible in isolation is a closed book it's a seal it's seal to the pentec it's sealed to the Catholics it's sealed to them they read scriptures and they only seeing shadows but when you look into the revealed word you're seeing clearly and plainly what you are born to do what you are called to [Applause] do but only a showdown could show what's inside of you let me say that again it's only when The Showdown come it proves what's inside of you that's why there's a test the only way to prove that you didn't waste your five years in secondary school is to have a test your test is a showdown it's you and the paper and the pencil and the examiner there and it's like a Warfare and you walk in there you either know what you're doing or you're praying to God to remember the stuff you heard in form one that you never looked at again and it's a showdown amen and some people in 10 minutes it's over because they only know 10 minutes worth of stuff and for others they're down to the wire time up and they want to be finish in because they have a lot to say because they want to make sure they overcome in this showdown amen life is about conflict Hallelujah everything has conflict a chicken coming out of a egg is conflict it's a showdown who is going to win is it going to stay in its condition and stay in the comfort zone of the egg or is it going to break out away from that Mama chicken and break out of the egg and it wins that Showdown and it steps out then it wants to go and explore on its own it's a showdown that's life it's a showdown it's a battle it's a struggle you struggle every day to overcome it's built in all of us to struggle amen just like it's built in all of us to be creators because there's the genes of our fathers and it's a struggle because God wants you to be a Creator and the devil wants you to be a copy amen hallelujah a photocopy of somebody else Hallelujah but when you get the individual Revelation you are born for a time as this to be just like your father to have dominion that Dominion that Adam was given that he forfeited and you recognize that when you worship and you pray and you praise God and you press and you battle and you contend there's something taking place in the inside that's connecting to who you are I love what but the redhead said about two weeks ago he say you can't go back if you were not there but only because you were there you could go back to that where was thou when I laid a foundation be that's not for everybody but if you were there you could go back to that can the church say amen and something has to reveal to you that you were there and if you were there and you are a warrior there why are you a warrior here I just used two words Hallelujah if you were there you were a warrior you were a fighter over there now you're coming and you're worrying worrying if I going to make a wonder how I going to pay the bills I wonder I'm worrying about my child I worrying if I going to make it a worrying if I going to if I going to get the Holy Ghost I don't know and but back there you are a warrior hallu just like the eagle the eagle don't ask permission for meat to seize meat and soups down and when and find the meat it grabs it because it's an eagle it don't ask permission from another Eagle it knows that it has a right to it's not a chicken it's not a hawk it's an eagle you don't need permission to go to the world and see your name in there you need permission to go to God that veil was Ren from top to bottom that the priest had put up to but when Jesus died it was direct access you don't need to go through anybody you can go straight to God and say Lord my child is in trouble and need an intervention I can't reach them they in another country but you are able just like that Centurion I'm not even worthy for you to come under my roof but just speak the word that's who we are listen to the prophet he said the devil will make you prove every one of those virtues think about that the devil will make you prove every one of those virtues isn't that a showdown so if the virtue being tested as patience then you have a showdown coming a patient Showdown Hallelujah and if you've been tested and Temperance by the nights you have a Temperance Showdown coming and a situation will come to see if you could be temperate to see if you could be patient so not every Showdown requires the same response that's right not every response but a Shan is dry s and chop you know that's right when Joseph had his Showdown it was a potty for wife [Music] Showdown and Joseph take them shoes I don't know if it was Nike I don't know if it was Adidas I don't know who it was and he ran for his life so there are some showdowns to win you have to run there are some showdowns stand still and see the salvation of God that's a different kind of Showdown Joseph couldn't see stand still and see this different kind of Showdown am but the Bible says we are not ignorant of Satan's deves so the Devil comes with all kinds of and I said to the young people many years ago you in church you're struggling you're holding on you want to be a Christian you want to live right you want to have a testimony in your school on your job because you know better amen anybody who comes and walks through this you know better when you do nonsense it's a choice that's right Hallelujah and the sad part is many of us we do the blame thing and the blame thing comes way back from Adam it wasn't me it was woman it wasn't me it was the serpent in fact Adam even throw God in him under the bus he said the woman you gave me so he blame the woman and God for giving it because if I was by myself alone doing telling I would have not be in this position right now but God has got a responsibility of accepting responsibility for your choices that's why we are free moral agents so we have a choice on if we want to worship so that's when Elijah reached a point of The Showdown he said why halt ye between two opinions amen come on why are you stuck trying to decide if to serve the god of Ahab or if to worship the Living God why are you Hal between two opinions to be a real Christian or to just be a church member amen come on why are you stuck between two decisions to go all the way or just come part of the way come on why are you stuck between two decisions to dress one way for church you know I'm coming and dress another way when you want to go to your show or you want to go to your thing or you want to go by your friends or whatever speak one way in the house of God and that's why I say it's easy to be a Christian in church because by Nature we could adapt our environment but when you are out there when nobody's looking or when you think nobody is looking that's the real you that's who the angel of the Lord is following not following you when you here in the church and you looking all churchy but when you wake up in the morning and you in the Maxi and the music suing good hallu I remember one time I was in form two or so and um my dad was against us going to school bazaars and stuff and so maybe I went to maybe one or so for a short moment and he sent us with a somebody from church a older young person I was like form one from to can remember and to my shock this older person was dancing to the music like just bobbing his head now he said this music catchy boy and I was just appalled because this was supposed to be person making sure that I don't do that but it's about choices show now is about a choice what you say is a choice you could say the right thing you could and and I know we hear it you know but you see what happens to Showdown is when the heat get turns up and the pressure comes a lot of the stuff you train and you hear suddenly Fades away you know that's when the pre that that that's The Showdown The Showdown is now when it's nice and we could go through the service now and everything is all right but The Showdown is when you by yourself and there's nobody to check you and as I said to them in maraval 2 weeks ago that still Small Voice that says don't do it but the Brandon said when you don't listen over and over you become so you lose the sensitivity and then you get cut off so when you make a choice to disrespect your parents or you make a choice to not come to church after a while it becomes easier and easier and easier that's why the Bible says we are in a rebellious time amen amen amen and Rebellion is a spirit yes Hallelujah so we don't want to sit back and act as if everything is all right because we are in a showdown right now but the Brandon was preaching the greatest battle ever fought and a battle was going on right there in the Tabernacle right there in the church so there's a shown going on right now a showdown for your soul a showdown for your testimony a showdown to see if you're going to put God first hallelujah hallelujah or if you're going to be just like anybody else Hallelujah you could be 10 years old and put God first you could be 6 years old and put God first you could be 100 years old and put God first it has nothing to do with your age who your father is who your mother is it has to do with if God has spoken to your life to your [Applause] heart you may be seated I know when I started people thought I was I going to get focus in the final showdown to come you know but I want to stick here for a little while in this showdown here right now amen the show down with your expectation and what you expect and how you expect God to move and God saying not yet I don't want to give you that because you have some more maturing up to do you have some much growing up to do but the brandom said one time to the ministers we have some more growing up to do because God wants some mature Sons some mature daughters who could weather the storm who could weather the trials who see trials for what they are that God will not give you more than you could bear and what trial sent is more precious than gold and God wants to get your character so beautiful and so sweet that whenever he squeeze your life is only perfume comes out because it's just like the rose of Sharon when they crush the petals on Calvary only the sweet fragrance of the Rose of Sharon could come out [Applause] because so God give us some sons and daughters that in 2017 would say God give us some more trials give us some more pressure give us some more showdowns because only The Showdown could get us to overcome how many want to be Overcomers how many want to face The Showdown to overcome The [Applause] [Music] Showdown only the Overcomers the Overcomers are the ones who overcome The Showdown The Showdown of the lust of the eyes The Showdown of the lust of the flesh the showdowns of the pride of life the showdowns of how you will conduct yourself during this Christmas season amen amen about two Tuesdays ago I believe it was there was the earthquake in Trinidad whole island shook I was there at my house and I was actually leaning just over the couch at the time and I felt the house began to shake and I said when I spoke that that Tuesday evening in service I said for that brief moment you recognize how small you are in the architecture of God I looked out to the church there that Tuesday night and it's one one of the largest attendances we had on a Tuesday night in a long time and brother Anthony I said to them I believe in my heart that everybody had planned to come to service early that morning and it was not the Earth earth quake that drove everybody to the house of God that evening but everything that can be shaken will be shaken hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah people don't understand yet and bovid was so powerful in his ministry last week when he speaking about judgment and the Bible said judgment will begin where in the house of God Amen so don't look at judgment out there judgment begins in the house of God the Bible says at the ancient men and the men who have sat in the message for a long time and they know better because to whom much is given much is required and the ancient men who have sat with the books and the tapes and the quotes and God is sending judgment amen because he will have no sin in his house he will have a church without spot without wrinkle so this is a showdown this morning to have a holy church am to have a church built on prayer to have a church built on respect to have a church built on forgiveness because God is a god of judgment and he's a god of Mercy Hallelujah and the two come hand in hand amen the B said one day the last song Will Be Sung one day the Bible will be closed for the last time and where will where will you be that's why the Bible say Seek Ye the Lord while he may be found call him while he is near this may be not the best type of service you want to hear to end the year you want to jump you want to shout but friends if we don't apply the token we miss the whole purpose of this [Applause] message the Raptor is going to be a small bunch of people friends it's not the whole message going to make it it's not the whole of Christianity who talk about the Rapture not because you talk about it means you're going to make it amen can the church say Amen Hallelujah showdowns from the message God's way has been made for us brother bam said so when it come time and The Showdown and Israel stood there by the Sea God's path LED across the sea so God looked down through the pillar of fire the sea got scared and move back you hear that description the sea got scared and moved back and Israel went across and dry land God's path LED through it so what do you think will happen when you come to your shoulder and God wants to step in the sea your situation will get scared and move back we spoke about Moses and his Showdown we spoke about Daniel he had his Showdown his Showdown was a show down about his prayer life that's what it was a show down about his prayer life and what did Daniel do Cur up no he prayed he had a choice he could have go and prayed under his belt so nobody would see it but you know what dam Daniel would pray that anybody could see him praying you know he had a choice yes he had a choice but the kind to go and hide you know think about it he had a choice to go when nobody would see him and pray but Daniel Was Not Afraid Hallelujah because he knew where his strength came from he knew where his power came from so he prayed just the same shame on you Christians who don't even want to pray for your food at lunch in your lunch room and your job you're an embarrassment to the kingdom of God and if you are not strong enough to pray for your food on your lunch table yes I know some of you that that's just don't don't and if you are ashamed of him what how do you want him to defend you and the Bible says my people shall never be ashamed can the Church Say Amen real Christians or no Christians at all butam said God Don't Make halfway preachers he don't make Halfway Christian but a preacher could be halfway a Christian could be halfway but we want to go all the way we want God to do something for us but God expects something from us also a committed life a surrendered life can the church say Amen the three Hebrew boys had their Showdown and they didn't back down they had a choice going to the fiery furnace and say to beg beg for mercy but they kept walking they kept walking they kept walking and when they got into the fiery furnace there was a forth man in the fire to meet them in their Showdown can the church say amen and we spoke about Elijah Elijah said call all your prophets hallu because the Reason God held the rain and held all the due and rain is because the children of God had turned their backs on God hallelujah hallelujah they were worshiping false Idols God he said call for us Showdown call all your prophets call all your priests call all your Believers let's have a convention set up your altar I'll set up my altar Elijah was not afraid he's standing there by himself he has nobody to support him he has nobody to encourage him but he has a revelation he said let it not be about numbers but let the god that answer by fire let that God be God and that's what I'm saying this morning Let The God Who heals the sick let that God be God let The God Who raises the dead let that God be God this morning you better have that God as your God this [Applause] morning and those priests who were worshiping ba and baam and all of that they put their animals there and they start to dance and they start to worship and Elijah was so confident he began to tease them he said maybe your God is on a vacation maybe your God went fishing maybe your God went for a walk maybe your God went strolling and those men understand this but the brand said they were so sincere they believed that they had to cut themselves because they believe that they were right but when Elijah's turn come now the whole nation is watching It's the final showdown that day he said put it there he said pour water put some water in it because I want to make sure that you see it's really fire from God there's no flame burning anywhere there I didn't start this but let the god that answer by fire it's not a man-made fire it's not a church made fire it's not a group fire but it's God answering by fire because he sees your life uh he sees your sacrifice he sees your testimony he sees you staying with his word he see you applying the token and all of a sudden the fire from heaven dropped down and the people began to repent God give us people like that who will stand in such a time as this in this showdown can the church say Amen oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the woman with the issue of blood she came to her Showdown the Bible says she has spent all that she had and I would expect if she had more money she would have spent it to but she had went from Doctor to doctor with her condition but she had come to her Crossroads as it was she had come to her Showdown she had no many or no more options and God many time has to bring us to the spot where we have no more options we have no more Alternatives we have no more family to ask I could have imagined you would have asked a family for money ask some friends for money to keep paying the doctor's bills she had an issue of blood for years and she kept trying to solve it but she heard that Jesus was in town and she heard the testimonies of what Jesus would do but she came to her Crossroads and she told herself if I could just Touch the Hem of His Garment I'm going to be made whole she came to her Showdown and God didn't make it easy for her he didn't clear a path for her but the currents she had to press her away past those who were just in the church she had to press away past those who were just warming a bench she had to press away past those who just wanted to be in church Hallelujah and she pressed away and she touched the him of his gar and she made a withdrawal because she had Faith to reach out and Jesus looked around he said who touched me the disciples didn't understand what was going on they said but Jesus everybody touching you he said this is different this woman made her with Joel I felt virtue left me I felt power left me I felt Grace left me is there somebody here this morning who has come to their Showdown they have come to their Crossroad they don't want to go back home home until they get what they came for blessed be the name of the [Applause] Lord hallelujah hallelujah the time for Showdown God give us the courage God give us the strength to press away I come here this morning to fight for the young people I come here this

people hasn't he come to too many homes when are we going to say enough is enough I feel like Shamar this morning Shamar had reached a point where he was tired of giving up his prayer life giving up his labor every season after he would plant and he would reap and he would put away the Harvest the philis times would come and they would take it away from him but the brandom said you may be seated but the Bram said that sh God hallelujah had reached a point where he couldn't take it anymore he said sha looked out but the BAM said he was maybe about 600 Philistines coming he said shamba stood there the prophet said he looked at his wife he looked at his daughter he said not another season am I going to give up my labor to the Philistines brother brand said shamba was dressed like a farmer he said he was not a soldier but in his heart but the brandom said he was concerned and then he got convinced he was convinced that God was with him but the B said he was not a soldier he didn't have a sword he didn't have a spear he didn't have a shield he had a ox gold you know what a ox go is it's what used to go the ox just to push it forward it was not a weapon but he reached his point he reached his limit he couldn't take it no more sha was tired of praying and seeing the devil take his Joy he was tired of coming to church and going back home and not seeing a change in his life he was tired of seeing his wife cry he was tired of seeing his daughter hungry he was tired of seeing his little bitty boys not have [Applause] food you may be seated Hallelujah it was not it was not that sha wasn't working it was not that sha was lazy sha was working sha was struggling sha was praying sha was crying out but when the Harvest came the Philistines would come and they would take it all

daughter to testify to your son to testify to your wife your husband your children praise God praise God praise God he may did it for a few minutes I want to get this in there but the Bram said Shamar was convinced all right and Shamar was concerned all right it had just become too much for him that's it and many times we have to come to the spot like shamba he had become used to giving up his Harvest but the devil just pushed just ones too much amen and this time he made up his mind that he was was not giving up again he looked not just at himself but he looked at his wife brother he looked at his child look at his family I want to challenge you look not just at yourself but look at your family look at your wife your husband your child your brother your sister look at the person who's next to you right now because that's your family amen and catch your burden and say Lord is enough is enough Hallelujah I'm tired of seeing Sister Christine and pain doesn't that that that that should affect you on a deep level I'm tired of seeing my brothers and sisters struggling with their back their eyes they it comes a point where you say it's enough is enough enough is enough seeing our young people struggling listen our young people they love God they want to serve God and the enemy has done a number on their minds in the schools and on their friends and many of you parents you have done the best that you could the best that you know how you have loved them more than than you could even put into words but still they have a hard time and you know this is the truth and you pray for them and you cry out for them but I want to say enough is enough this is the season for their restoration the Philistines have done enough and we come to push them back we come to serve them notice that this is the final showdown hallelujah thank you brother the brandham said in the message convinced and then concerned he said if this group of people here tonight and I I said today could get that much convinced he said God gave the promises and when God gave the promise to Abraham he said he would have possess the Gate of his enemies and so Shamar believed that and look at the odds against him listen to the prophet and this is what I'm looking for today he said God only needs one man so I'm looking for one person I know I'm one this morning but is there anybody else this morning morning he said God only needs one man God just let just let him get one man in his hand the world will think he's crazy but he will drive home the gospel when he's thoroughly convinced listen to what he's convinced about that Jesus Christ Remains the same yesterday today and forever under anything else he will stand true and go on because he's thoroughly convinced that God is God and if he ever was God he's still God and if he isn't the God he was he never was God that's right he's the infinite God the all powerful listen the prophet Almighty omnipresent omniscient infinite he said Oh my he is God he's the same God that opened the Red Sea he's the same God that brought Daniel out of the Lion's Den the same God that brought the Hebrew children from the fiery furnace he's the same God that raised up Jesus Christ and Easter morning he's the same God that fell on the day of Pentecost he's the same God that raised Lazarus out of the Grave he's the same yesterday today and forever and I'm convinced that this is the Holy Ghost oh my that's the prophet's words but the B goes on he said Peter said on the day of Pentecost this is that and if this isn't that I'll keep this till that comes for I believe this is that I'm convinced that it's the gospel and the power and the demonstration of the resurrection of the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ in this last day making the church ready to be caught away in a bride can the church say Amen oh my oh my oh my oh my is there anybody convinced this morning is there anybody convinced this morning is there anybody concerned this morning listen to the prophet Moses in the same message Moses esteemed the reproach of Christ listen greater riches than the treasures of Egypt amen I want to say this friends you hunt all kind of stuff in life the nice house the nice car the money the this the whatever it is but Moses esteemed the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt therefore he forsake a throne he took his Choice with the poor ignorant illiterate slaves why he esteemed The Riches of Christ greater Treasures than to have his glory in the world at that time amen hallelujah can the church say Amen oh have all the glory they want but what God wants today is men and women who isn't interested in great big fineries and all these other things but somebody that will take the simple word of God and preach it with all that's in them and wait on God for the power of God to manifest himself Hallelujah we can't bring the manifestation on in our time but when the time has come it's just like Elijah tell them I'm here and one of these days there'll be an announcement go around the world tell them the bride is here tell them the bride is here once more they are Sons and Daughters of God just like Adam Dominion on the earth once more the bees will know it the trees will know it the sky will know it the seed will know it can the church say Amen oh somebody give the Lord a shout of Praise hallelujah hallelujah oh my my my my my my my oh I'm getting ready to close out now could you take some [Applause] more Hallelujah so brother brandham he proclaimed a message a shout message and that shout message was a call to war that message was to place Us in another Ephesians that in another Ephesians where the faith will be preached and brother stepen was so tremendous a couple of weeks ago speaking about the faith not a faith or a belief or a Doctrine but the faith that the early church had because Malachi 4 come to restore the heart of the children back to the apostolic faith because it takes Faith to operate to power it takes Faith to move the sword so every service we getting prepared by the word we're getting heed by the word because faith comes by hearing the word and when you are convinced and you get concerned that the time is now and God is able and he's still the same yesterday today and forever then all of a sudden your walk begins to change your talk begins to change and every attack the devil could put might be against your body but he could never touch your soul there's a seed in your soul that the devil cannot touch but the pop well he could watch you he could bring your headaches and your mind battles and mess with your mind and your memory and your conscience and your imagination but your soul belongs to God and the devil is mad he's [Music] upset Hallelujah so maybe after this year you're a little tired you're a little weary and you know there are some people they they almost want to send themselves off all right maybe a little tired maybe a little weary but I want to encourage you this morning maybe you didn't understand how this happened why this happened maybe you have seen so much you don't even know if you want to fight anymore say let young people fight but today we are all going to fight for every inch of ground we all going to fight to see these gray hairs turn back black I was saying to my wife just yesterday I find my rate of gray hair growth is becoming exponential it used to be one or two I tell within last two months I just see like a whole crop of gray hair but brother the Barry that gray hair got to turn back hall that great hair got to go got that my promise if my hair grows he to see here is a little lower than the size for some reason I don't know why one time I told you Bara cut this to match this but it's a showdown amen amen Paul's today said death where's your sting grave where's your Victory he looked it in his face and laughed show down because he knew where he was standing that's the confidence we must all have he could speak that way because he had met the pillar of fire his approval was not from men his approval was not from Gel his approval was not from Jerusalem his approval was from the pillar of fire the pillar of fire placed him into his position and that's what we want sons and daughters of God placed by fire whether we have a service or not your connection is vertical your connection is not horizontal if brother Steven isn't here I can't be like oh gosh I wonder what going on no my connection is vertical if nobody else want to worship my eyes are closed to everybody else what they going through is not what I'm going through I will worship nobody well no nobody else standing up so I what is that your your connection must be vertical when God speaks to you you respond because God is speaking to you if nobody else is hearing him this morning and you hear him you should be so happy so excited to hear the voice of God inside of your soul somebody say Amen my could you take some more it's the last Sunday you know no I don't want you to think I'm finished you know you're getting service today and next week one time from the message putting on the whole armor of God and said you know in this Warfare between nations there's a great Warfare going on beyond that so while the Bible says you'll hear of wars and rumors of wars and the end is not yet but the bandam is now saying let's go a little higher than that there's a great Warfare going on beyond that and that's a great Warfare between God and Satan a great Warfare that was the first Warfare and it's still raging but oh I'm so glad it'll soon come to an end then it'll all be over and listen listen carefully young people Satan has his agents out everywhere I want you to get this so this is not about you coming to church and going to work and going to school Satan has his agents out everywhere watching spying out on God's people God's moves the enemy is sitting everywhere watching to see what he can do and God's got some out too so God's got some agents out too brother Shane so we find out that these secret agents of the enemy that sits around now listen but the B said each Nation now will equip its men with the latest equipment all right the very latest and they study and they do everything they're trying to counteract the other fellow's weapons and to get a little more modern weapon a little something with a little more punch to it from the bow and arrow to a musket and from a musket a modern rifle and from that to an atomic they just keep on building and it keeps them busy all the time and it's the nations's business if they want to survive they want to equip their solers with the best equipment that there is brother brandom goes on he said well God you know he's infinite see he don't have to think of anything better he's just got the best to begin with so you can't improve on it nothing's to be done about it he just gives us the best and that's his word that's right that's his word the best that can be given and God gives his people the very best that's what he chose for his children the very very best I'm so glad of that listen to The Prophet now God cannot make a decision today listen carefully and tomorrow come back and make a better decision Hallelujah let me say that again God cannot make a decision today and come back tomorrow and make a better decision so if God elected you he cannot come back and make a better decision to pick somebody else when God chose you he made the best decision he made the best choice you were his first choice you were not his second choice can the church say Amen listen to The Prophet see because his first decision is perfect he never has to change it so therefore we can rest upon whatever God says and if God says you're going to get the Holy Ghost that decision is already made there's no better decision we can rest on that and I'm resting on it this morning we are going to have a Revival we are going to have a Revival oh my my oh my oh my everybody feeling fine everybody feeling energized you ready for another 3 hours oh [Applause] my Hallelujah so we are getting ready for war brother the B said in the message of paradox he said any man that believes God any man it doesn't even speak about his condition he said any man that believes God and takes him at his word no matter what the situation is God will perform another Paradox to keep his word it didn't say how you're living how you're acting he said If any man believe God and take him his word no wonder but the brand could talk about the people would come and get healed in the prayer lines who were prostitutes who were living any way they wanted but they believed God and they took him at his word and God healed them and people sat in the Tabernacle for 20 years to 10 years for 5 years believing and got nothing because they didn't have the faith but this morning we have a Fai to see God do something am you may be seated not by legalism not by rules and I said to them in maraval listen this gospel is message is not about rules do this don't do this do this don't do this the young people say we have too much rules it's not about rules it's about [Applause] love so I said to them in marava my wife wasn't in the service but I said if my wife tells me to put the white clothes here and put the colored here because it's easier to wash I could go and tell my friends boy Tony boy my wife have real rules I have to put the white here and put the color here but it's not a rule to me it's love because if she loves it that way my love for her to make her happy will make all the whes here and all the colored here so I don't see it as a rule I love her so if she want the white clothes here white clothes colored here color cloes and whatever God wants from me if he says do it this way I say yes Lord here yes Lord here is at the rule he loves me I love him it's a relationship you may be [Applause] seated and but read but R said it two weeks ago you know there's a Facebook status relationship status single married and have it's complicated he said your relationship with God cannot be complicated it's either it's real or it's not you can't be not sure how things stand between you and God our relationship we kind of Rocky no no no no no keep that relationship on point all the time the same he give you gifts you give him gifts a sacrifice of praise that's a gift to him surprise him with a gift of worship surprise him with spontaneous Glory just standing the middle of the day lock yourself in the bathroom and say Lord I Want to Thank You for Your Grace and your love and your mercy can the church say Amen I'm all over the place this morning but I pray this gives you some substance to fight the battle that when nobody else is around that's that's what this is about but you could stand when nobody else is looking anywhere under any time under any condition the earthquake must come on you must look around and stand strong knowing that the canopy of life you know brother Brandon walked and there was a bubble around him people would come to him and they would stop he said don't be afraid that's just the presence of God hallelujah it was something you could feel hallelujah it's something that you just recognize you hit something you can't see with the eye but he was protected and don't you know when you give your life completely to him and he takes the driver's seat because he is in there he has his own security guards so when he's in there his security guards become your security guards can the church say amen I want you to understand friends if the president of the United States is driving and this his whole motorcade the plane on top all the security and you just stand in by you say come and get a ride with me and you sit in that car then all of a sudden you are protected you are just as protected as the president of the United States so when you think God plac the Holy Ghost which is a part of himself in you isn't he obligated to protect himself that's why he said no weapon formed against you can prosper because they tried weapons on Jesus but it couldn't Prosper they will pick up deadly things they wouldn't harm them if death couldn't kill him how could it affect you it might change your location your dwell place but your soul belongs to God you are Cut From a Different Cloth your DNA has has has has has has Resurrection built in there not everybody has that you know that's why you confuse the doctors how much testimony you have you don't know how you made it through and the doctor said this about you that about you we read it every Sunday praise after praise after praise is your DNA is different your blood type is not AO or a positive or that's not your blood type your blood type is the same genes that come from [Applause] God can the church say Amen just a little more I'm just trying to find a way to close out here to encourage you so we are getting ready for war for a final showdown a final battle Abraham is counting on us Joshua is counting on us David is counting on us they did their part to the best of their ability but they had to pass the Baton on to the next group to take it and the next man to take it and the next judge and the next prophet and when Jesus came he passed the Batton on to the church all that was in God important to Christ all that was in Christ important to his church and then the first church Age come and when they were done they pass it on and every age was a battle every age had a thunder every age had a voice every age had a message every age had a people every age had a Time amen but now we are the end of the ages hallah there's no more Messenger to come but there is a people on the land there's no more time to come because time is no more we are in that season now where the devil is confused the devil is mad he doesn't understand what is going on but a bride is getting ready you know what brother brandham said the third P is for the weaker ones the ones who don't even have the Fai can't even must the faith but the Bram also said that when you get over there you're going to see people there you never thought we're going to make it so God picked for declarant a bunch of Misfits a bunch of unqualified people just like how we picked Peter and James and John who were not
