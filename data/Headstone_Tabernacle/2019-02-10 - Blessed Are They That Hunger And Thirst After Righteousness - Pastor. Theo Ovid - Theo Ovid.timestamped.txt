[43:22] Alana was said to me she wanted to
[43:24] apologize that behind me for permitting
[43:26] and that she was worried she was making
[43:28] too much noise and disturbing me
[43:30] I told her to be honest I don't remember
[43:32] I didn't hear thing as I was in my own
[43:35] prayer closet I said don't worry you go
[43:37] right ahead
[43:38] well words can't express what happened
[43:40] at yesterday's Friday night prayer
[43:43] meeting
[43:44] I know I feel a little sewer all I could
[43:46] see is that something got ahold of me I
[43:48] entered my prayer closet again and said
[43:50] it's just you and me Lord I wanted to go
[43:53] a little higher out of this natural
[43:55] realm
[43:55] and it's like I was locked in and just
[43:58] poured out my soul so much so that at
[44:01] the start of the service I was on the
[44:03] left end of the Pew or if I don't know
[44:06] how or when I move somewhere in between
[44:08] I heard you say greet somebody I'll open
[44:10] my eyes I was on the right of the Pew
[44:13] and I tried to grease it so Williams and
[44:15] we broke apart I was a bit dazed close
[44:17] still talking to God I felt myself like
[44:19] I was being sued I'm wrong and I wrong
[44:21] never felt like that anything like that
[44:23] I remember thinking what happened and
[44:25] the thought that I couldn't pull up
[44:26] anymore
[44:27] took a while to catch myself and by the
[44:29] time I was downstairs while in the
[44:31] washer once it's a blended greeted me I
[44:32] felt myself drifting as I was drunk on
[44:34] new wine I felt I was drunk couldn't
[44:37] walk in a straight line for anything and
[44:39] what an experience whoa if that permiten
[44:42] wasn't the power of God working in a
[44:43] church I don't know what is amen
[44:49] I know it's a push but I'm looking
[44:53] forward to another permitting we will
[44:55] continue to pray until something
[44:57] happened as in our own Upper Room
[44:59] experience
[45:00] Azusa Street revival I believe it
[45:02] already started or crazily the Lord
[45:05] there's no wonderful glory hallelujah
[45:09] amen and and we have a testimony from
[45:13] sister Alana Utley she say but first I
[45:14] wanted to say thank you very much for
[45:16] everything that was said and done to
[45:18] make last night permitting the success
[45:20] of words I like to share you to you my
[45:22] experience although I know words would
[45:25] only explain so much but still I try my
[45:27] best at the beginning of but of the
[45:29] permian I find myself just repeating
[45:31] words I would start praying and before
[45:34] long I'd hear myself saying the same
[45:36] thing again and I decided to try a
[45:38] different approach
[45:39] I visualized God as being next to me I
[45:42] began telling him how happy I was just
[45:45] to be here knowing he said where the
[45:47] truths and trees I got it in his name
[45:48] there he is
[45:50] I told him how excited I was this whole
[45:53] week waiting for this night I know it's
[45:56] like word just been repeated I told him
[45:58] I can't go back home
[45:59] the same way I came with all my feelings
[46:02] and weaknesses
[46:03] I don't want to leave this permitted
[46:05] after traveling all these miles to go
[46:07] back home and say well it was nice being
[46:09] here I need more than that I need a
[46:11] change
[46:12] I needed livers the more I talk to God
[46:15] exposing my failures and weaknesses the
[46:18] more I wanted to let him know I remember
[46:20] repenting and praising and thanking him
[46:23] I was repentant because I know I'm not
[46:25] good I was worshipping because of who he
[46:28] is and then I began to thank him for all
[46:30] that he has done and was about to do and
[46:33] I started doing this I can't remember
[46:35] when I had stopped repeating the same
[46:37] words but I had reached the point where
[46:39] I had no control over my repentance or
[46:41] my worshipping there was an atmosphere
[46:43] of being so broken and at the same time
[46:46] being made whole I was so totally caught
[46:49] up in the atmosphere to me right here is
[46:52] where I wanted to stay I cannot help but
[46:56] repeat myself again I had absolutely no
[46:58] control over what was happening but over
[47:00] the best I can describe this experience
[47:02] was we've every wrong got higher and
[47:06] higher every time I repent and praise
[47:09] there was something taking place within
[47:11] me I just wish I had words to fully
[47:13] explain this entire experience and we
[47:17] want to sing that song again waves of

[49:56] by the see here that the Lord had dried
[49:58] up the waters of Jordan from before the
[50:00] chin of Israel until we were passed over
[50:03] that they had melted it neither was
[50:05] their spirit in them anymore because of
[50:07] the cheerin of Israel and at that time
[50:10] the Lord said unto Joshua make these
[50:13] sharp knives uncircumcised again the
[50:16] cheerin of Israel the second time and
[50:18] Joshua made him sharp knives and
[50:20] circumcise the chin of Israel and the
[50:22] heel of the foreskin and this is the
[50:24] cause why Joshua did circumcise all the
[50:28] people are came out of Egypt that were
[50:30] meals even all the men of war died in
[50:32] the wilderness by the way after they
[50:35] came out of Egypt now all the people
[50:38] that came out was circumcised but all
[50:41] the people that were born in the
[50:42] wilderness by the way as they came forth
[50:45] out of Egypt
[50:46] they had not circumcised for the chin of
[50:49] Israel walk forty years in the
[50:50] wilderness till all the people that were
[50:52] men of war which came Elizabeth consumed
[50:54] because they obeyed not the voice of the
[50:57] Lord unto whom the Lord swear that he
[51:00] would not show them the land which the
[51:02] Lord swear their fathers that he would
[51:04] give them a land that floweth with milk
[51:06] and honey and their children whom he had
[51:09] raised up in their stead them joshua
[51:13] circumcised for they was uncircumcised
[51:15] because they have not succumb sized them
[51:18] by the way and it came to pass when they
[51:21] had uncircumcised in all the people in
[51:23] their board in their places in the camp
[51:25] till they were made whole and the Lord
[51:27] said unto Joshua this day have I roll
[51:30] away the report of Egypt from off of you
[51:32] wherefore the name of this place is
[51:34] called giggle under this theme and the
[51:37] chin of Israel and camped and giggle and
[51:38] kept the Passover on the fourteenth day
[51:41] of the month and even in the plains of
[51:43] Jericho and they did eat of the old corn
[51:46] of the land on the morrow after the
[51:49] Passover unleavened cakes and parched
[51:52] corn in the self-same day and the manna
[51:54] ceased on the morrow after they are
[51:56] eaten of the old corn

[52:34] scripture taken from Matthew chapter 5

[53:32] this morning to get what you expect this
[53:35] more of a title blessed the day that
[53:39] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[53:42] blessed the day that hunger thirst after
[53:45] righteousness and I've an inspiration to
[53:48] stand for God to stand for God
[53:52] hallelujah praise God and but a Branham
[53:59] I had used this message and he read this
[54:03] you a descriptor rather and preached a
[54:05] measure called taste
[54:07] Brisco
[54:21] okay he said I think David and writing
[54:25] in the somme must have been in distress
[54:27] and it usually take distress to bring
[54:31] the best out of a man you see when
[54:38] things going smooth and easy gotta watch
[54:41] it just how to watch it usually take
[54:46] distress to bring out what's in a man
[54:50] and it's usually when God gets down to
[54:53] when we fast many a times to get
[54:55] ourselves in a position outside of the
[54:57] way and I think when David got in those
[54:59] places he began to meditate on the Lord
[55:01] and think about these things and many
[55:04] times God get us in tight corners where
[55:07] we have to look up sometimes we have to
[55:10] be on our back in the hospital or bed
[55:14] somewhere so we could look up to see
[55:18] where the great blessings of God comes
[55:21] from and that's why I say you have to
[55:24] have an attitude of gratitude and stop
[55:26] complaining because complaining the
[55:29] sweetened and hinder your feet
[55:31] hallelujah the man complaining you have
[55:33] no shoes he stopped complaining because
[55:35] so somebody with no feet have a attitude
[55:38] of gratitude
[55:39] how many happy to be here this morning
[55:41] how many creat feel that you lied this
[55:44] morning God give you strength in your
[55:46] body you have a hand to prison or glory
[55:48] to God you come here to get a word from
[55:50] the Lord hallelujah praise God amen
[55:54] no he said no I he's talking about
[55:57] testing for life and he said I was
[56:00] looking in a dictionary for the word
[56:01] test and Webster's say it's a painful
[56:04] desire it's painful when you want
[56:09] something so bad that it becomes painful
[56:13] to you it's not an unnatural thing to
[56:17] test it's a natural thing God put that
[56:20] in us and it's something God put in you
[56:23] to get the control different desires and
[56:26] this test is the control tower this
[56:28] control tower that sets in man hearts is
[56:31] something that God give him to warn him
[56:33] of the desires that is needful for him
[56:36] and that's why when somebody really
[56:38] thirsty and they're really tasty they
[56:40] will drink for anything because you're
[56:42] really thirsty and if your doctor is by
[56:45] putting things up on you that you don't
[56:48] have that hunger in until enough for for
[56:49] God so God David said my soul thirsts
[56:53] for God not for scriptures and quotes
[56:55] for God he identified for the Living God
[56:59] not an intellectual understanding for
[57:01] the Living God hallelujah and my enemies
[57:05] and people say where is your God what
[57:07] what is powerful and mighty declare that
[57:10] God manifests that God brought back down
[57:12] you know because he is able to keep his
[57:14] word he go back down on him no he is
[57:18] able to fulfill his word he is able to

[1:02:34] Oprah is gone if of your buyers I gotta
[1:02:38] turn with me to first Corinthians of the
[1:02:40] ten just read some verses you from Lewis
[1:02:43] Corinthians chapter 10
[1:02:47] inscription I don't know how come to me
[1:02:49] to put this in but I just kind of tried
[1:02:52] to move by leaving the spirit to put it
[1:02:55] in and then when I went to food and
[1:02:56] study in it I saw brother Branham break
[1:02:59] into the scripture because you say we
[1:03:01] have a revival coming and a warning have
[1:03:03] to go out indirect line of this revival
[1:03:07] full screen chapter 10 greed in verse 1
[1:03:09] and Paul execs 14 the Corinthians church
[1:03:13] and the Brethren and the Corinthians
[1:03:15] church
[1:03:15] moreover brethren I would not that he
[1:03:18] would be ignorant how that our fathers
[1:03:22] were under the cloud and all passed
[1:03:24] through the sea and were all baptized
[1:03:27] unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea
[1:03:30] did all eat the same spiritual meat did
[1:03:35] all drink the same spiritual drink for
[1:03:38] the drank of that spiritual rock that
[1:03:40] followed them and that rock was Christ
[1:03:42] but was fine with many of them God was
[1:03:46] not well pleased for they will
[1:03:48] overthrown in the wilderness now these
[1:03:53] things were our examples to the intent
[1:03:58] we should not lust after evil things as
[1:04:01] they also lusted needed neither be at
[1:04:05] lattice as was some of them as it were
[1:04:08] written the people sat down to eat and
[1:04:11] drink and rose up to play neither let us
[1:04:16] commit fornication as some of them
[1:04:19] committed and fell in one day three and
[1:04:22] twenty thousand neither let us tempt
[1:04:25] Christ as some of them tempted and were
[1:04:28] destroyed of serpents neither murmur ye
[1:04:31] as some of them also murmured and were
[1:04:33] destroyed of the destroyer now all these
[1:04:37] things happened unto them for example
[1:04:41] and they are written for our admonition
[1:04:45] upon whom the ends of the world are come
[1:04:50] wherefore let him that thinketh he
[1:04:53] standeth take heed lest he fall
[1:04:57] they had no temptation taken you
[1:05:00] such as is common to man but God is
[1:05:03] faithful who will not suffer you to be
[1:05:05] tempted above that ye are able but will
[1:05:08] with the temptation also make a way of
[1:05:11] escape that you may be able to bear it
[1:05:14] may God bless his word and I trust this
[1:05:18] be edifying to you because these happen
[1:05:21] to these believers believers as examples
[1:05:25] upon whom the ends of the wool are come
[1:05:27] that we could learn from that that we
[1:05:30] could understand the same God that saved
[1:05:33] them from Egypt is the same God that
[1:05:36] judge them the same God that pull them
[1:05:39] out is the same God that destroy them so
[1:05:42] don't think God is a good God all the
[1:05:44] time those are like fries people I can
[1:05:45] see understand this sport in support of
[1:05:47] the world so we have to line up with his
[1:05:50] requirement or we will be judged doesn't
[1:05:53] matter who you are it doesn't matter
[1:05:56] what you do you think you are it doesn't
[1:05:58] matter what dress you have it doesn't
[1:06:00] matter what time have it is god
[1:06:03] hallelujah in the beginning was the word
[1:06:06] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:06:08] God the word is still got today so this
[1:06:11] is a brother branham this message this
[1:06:12] morning and this was corinthians book of
[1:06:15] correction is preaching this message
[1:06:17] this morning as it come to my heart
[1:06:19] in hee there is a message of warning and
[1:06:23] i thought maybe if we could get this
[1:06:25] warning to the people as paul warning
[1:06:29] these corinthians if we could get this
[1:06:31] warning to the people knowing we are
[1:06:33] facing a revival now and an examining
[1:06:37] time when we must be examined and he was
[1:06:41] given an understanding that when God
[1:06:43] brought Israel out of the wilderness
[1:06:44] into this to serve Him take to take them
[1:06:47] to the promised land he is setting an
[1:06:49] example that we are brought out all our
[1:06:52] material things and the rituals and
[1:06:54] orders were the same we found a little
[1:06:56] further that they were overthrown
[1:06:58] because here we go because they could do
[1:07:01] these rituals and all the orders and
[1:07:05] everything that God require and still
[1:07:08] the hearts wasn't right with God
[1:07:11] so it's not coming to church it's not
[1:07:14] saying you believe it's getting your
[1:07:16] heart right with God it's not much
[1:07:21] mystery tional and how much revelations
[1:07:24] you claim is getting your heart right
[1:07:27] with God now we can do many things we
[1:07:32] can take communion we can be baptized we
[1:07:34] can come to church we can have our names
[1:07:36] on the book they just has respect on me

[1:29:26] delivered don't you want that
[1:29:28] [Applause]
[1:29:34] let's go quickly now Wow so the holy
[1:29:43] spirit will fall but by their fruits
[1:29:47] they are known because some Samedi
[1:29:50] spirits and demon allergy need the
[1:29:51] atmosphere of the holy spirit they live
[1:29:54] under that false period that's why all
[1:29:58] Israel is on Israel all the people in
[1:30:01] the Christians are not Christians see so
[1:30:03] Christian is Christian and heart and
[1:30:04] spirit and mind it's Christian and life
[1:30:08] not Christian become the church but
[1:30:10] Christian because you have that
[1:30:11] Christianity in your heart
[1:30:14] hallelujah so he said I understood there
[1:30:18] it is the Holy Spirit will form but by
[1:30:21] their fruits they are known see at the
[1:30:23] Lord Jesus not by the reaction of the
[1:30:26] spirit whether heal the sick or whether
[1:30:28] they speak in tongues or whether they
[1:30:30] sang in the spirit whether it rejoice
[1:30:31] this way that way they can do all of
[1:30:32] that and instead be lost it's your life
[1:30:35] within you are born again experience and
[1:30:39] Paul was trying to get that to the
[1:30:42] Corinthians
[1:30:43] Christianity's I go over to the church I
[1:30:45] know it's my duty to go that's not
[1:30:47] Christianity
[1:30:47] I want him stink-eye back sitting a
[1:30:50] mystery for services or coming today so
[1:30:51] I do know they still think I say all
[1:30:53] wrong
[1:30:54] I know Christianity Christianity it is
[1:30:57] something that God has done
[1:31:03] I will see it again Christianity is
[1:31:06] something that God has done so you could
[1:31:11] be a crook you could be a thief you
[1:31:15] could be whatever and God come and do
[1:31:18] something for you
[1:31:23] [Applause]
[1:31:27] is not what you are is what one has done
[1:31:34] come on now do you get that we focus so
[1:31:39] much on what we have done but what God
[1:31:41] has done has fought done it for you if
[1:31:46] he hasn't done it he will do it
[1:31:48] deliver you for you forgive you restore
[1:31:51] you rescue you liberate you open the
[1:31:54] prison bars for you if you could do it
[1:32:00] you don't need God if you could save
[1:32:05] yourself you need a savior when you
[1:32:07] recognize that you are no good you are
[1:32:09] nothing you need him and he loves you
[1:32:12] you care about you or glory the glory
[1:32:15] coming down this morning the envy men to
[1:32:21] come into your life all right
[1:32:23] so it's something that God has done God
[1:32:25] has chose you in Christ and presented
[1:32:28] you as a love gift to Christ it is God's
[1:32:32] calling an election hallelujah praise
[1:32:36] God so watch the the all were baptized
[1:32:40] into the sea they all drank of the same
[1:32:42] rock and so on what they all came in and
[1:32:45] baptized and the Christ took on Christ
[1:32:47] outwardly he said professionally I take
[1:32:50] them on intellectually had accepted him
[1:32:53] they come back receiving a message
[1:32:55] outwardly informally not inwardly and
[1:32:58] willingly they come like if you receive
[1:33:01] me outwardly and formally as your pasta
[1:33:03] and not inwardly and willingly for me to
[1:33:07] tell you what you need to know so you're
[1:33:10] running your own show and you're not
[1:33:12] getting guidance and instruction you're
[1:33:15] doing your own thing
[1:33:16] then you are on your own Road because
[1:33:20] the foolish virgins listen is part of
[1:33:22] the same court that the Y's version was
[1:33:25] cut off from the same court virgin is
[1:33:29] declawed but when God put the pattern
[1:33:32] hallelujah
[1:33:33] he cut only wives piece the rice pieces
[1:33:37] were of extra oils
[1:33:43] so if you don't want to subject yourself
[1:33:45] to the word and the order of the church
[1:33:47] then you know what you are
[1:33:49] that's judge member behavior those

[1:34:28] they can so okay so watch watch Moses up
[1:34:32] the mountain they find Moses in too long

[1:35:18] they'll make that golden calf I can tell
[1:35:21] commas when Moses who only Lord side
[1:35:22] here and drop IP smoke and everything
[1:35:24] else here on chopped everything around
[1:35:26] the Moses Oh Aaron no he and
[1:35:28] foolishness even know he won't do any
[1:35:30] wrong thing but when push come to shove

[1:36:03] it's a lot more than intellectual as
[1:36:05] Boram says it goes beyond that it's a
[1:36:08] genuine bit not a mental conception or
[1:36:12] emotional workup but a built an
[1:36:15] experience something that goes plumb
[1:36:17] down deep into the heart and changes the
[1:36:21] innermost bein that makes you do things
[1:36:24] that you would not have done in other
[1:36:26] words it makes you makes you that change
[1:36:29] makes you love those who are unlovable
[1:36:35] so if you want to test the Christianity
[1:36:37] test it with people who give in your
[1:36:41] trouble testing love to momenta when you
[1:36:46] see them see if you love them or you
[1:36:49] want to give them bad ion cation
[1:36:53] whatever whatever else so you see this

[1:37:51] that I love you he want to run me yes

[1:38:29] will fall back on you and because before
[1:38:31] that on them
[1:38:32] so Jesus I bless those that bless you

[1:39:13] already made for me Christ in me has
[1:39:16] made it himself and I just trust in his
[1:39:18] Anka oh praise the name of the Lord do
[1:39:21] you get it
[1:39:22] he said no or look at this solemn
[1:39:24] warning and Tabernacle folks get that

[1:39:29] eternal destination hangs right there
[1:39:31] don't pass it by like a little flutter
[1:39:33] this is something we have to come to
[1:39:35] respective of it some that means what I
[1:39:37] believe hereafter or not they were all
[1:39:39] baptized analogous to the Red Sea they
[1:39:41] all follow the same spirit being the
[1:39:43] cloud a pillar of fact they were all led
[1:39:45] by the same angel they all come on by
[1:39:47] the same posture he's seeing it he said
[1:39:49] they all had a presidency they all each
[1:39:52] spiritual manner the MANOWAR's christ
[1:39:53] christ coming on the manna every night
[1:39:55] from heaven and perished yet to sustain
[1:39:57] the people journey but christ come from
[1:39:59] heaven and give his life he whoever
[1:40:01] believeth in him should not perish but
[1:40:02] have everlasting life and Christ come
[1:40:04] down and became all manner they eat the
[1:40:07] same spiritual blessing therefore the
[1:40:09] Holy Spirit can fall right in amongst
[1:40:11] the people on both Christian and
[1:40:13] lukewarm and half believers and
[1:40:15] borderline believers will eat the same
[1:40:16] but that doesn't mean that yet oh I wish
[1:40:20] I had words that I could drive this dong
[1:40:22] and cinch it in every hat every person
[1:40:24] to see what a deep thing it is it isn't
[1:40:27] something to be played with it isn't
[1:40:29] going to church he said listen he said I
[1:40:32] know this I felt the power go to me I
[1:40:34] did this that might be exactly the truth
[1:40:36] and still you are lost and then he went

[1:40:40] speak with the tongues of men and angels
[1:40:42] and have not charity I become a song
[1:40:45] than brass and a tinkling cymbal and do
[1:40:48] I have the gift of prophecy understand
[1:40:50] all mysteries know all knowledge and
[1:40:52] though I have all faith so I can move
[1:40:55] mountains and have not charity

[1:41:00] all apostle drive it into this
[1:41:02] sensational Church who was based in the

[1:41:07] do I bestow all my goods to feed the
[1:41:09] poor doing good works right and have not
[1:41:13] charity it profiteth me nothing see all
[1:41:15] your good works all your good deeds all
[1:41:17] this britannians you have all the gifts

[1:41:49] itself unseemly so the Holy Spirit
[1:41:52] cannot behave in one person and miss me
[1:41:53] even one person is one Lord one spirit
[1:41:56] one Holy Spirit if the Holy Spirit
[1:41:58] believe in this one it could be even

[2:07:46] not a real genuine put off Christ if you
[2:07:48] don't love him and everything that
[2:07:50] you've got within you I don't care
[2:07:52] whether you look pretty or whether
[2:07:53] you're doing you'll love him and you

[2:08:39] because we can go to the best church or
[2:08:41] we can dress best or we can get this
[2:08:43] neighborhood or we can't do this or we
[2:08:45] can ride and so forth that does not
[2:08:47] wanting through with it
