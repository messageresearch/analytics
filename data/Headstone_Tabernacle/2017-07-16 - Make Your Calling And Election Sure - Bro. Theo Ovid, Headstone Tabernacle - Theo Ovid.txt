[Music] in this well God bless you and greetings in jesus' name what a convention amen still basking I've never it has been really something else that anointing keeps staying and remaining that's something so I believe we moving into a new season and i' like you to turn your Bibles to 1 Peter chapter 1 and 2 Peter chapter 1 thank you musicians praise the name of the Lord I thought I was going to have but Isaac to say a few words before I come on on the convention but there he is on the organ making great music but we appreciate the musicians and we appreciate you the Believers for making what we see possible by the grace of God so we want to look at 1 Peter chapter 1 and we want to read verse 1 and two Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ to The Strangers cetral ponus Galia capadia Asia and bethenia elect according to the for knowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace be multiplied second Peter 1 want to read from verse 1 to 11 Simon Peter a servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained what like Precious feet with us through the righteous of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of the Jesus our lord according as his divine power had given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world true lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be Barren no unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacked these things is blind cannot see a far off and not forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things he shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ may God bless his word you may be seated praise the Lord amen it's always a blessing to be in the presence of God Amen in the house of God Amen and it's good to be here this morning praise God so we had the services representation by predestination brother Peter Chandler we certainly appreciate that possessing your individual inheritance brother Isaac ID brother Jess obl the Eternal Church age at the end of the seals praise God Brother raymon Thompson the bride of Christ is God's Eternal thoughts made manifest but U Pastor U the even and morning with the first day and brother John K the spoken word is the Original Seed I want you to note how deep the even the titles are in terms of presenting to the bride that's nothing to do with church or convention is have to do with a bride elect isn't that right and you have to possess your individual inheritance because you have representation by predestination so you don't have to play shy and whatnot know and you are predestined to that Eternal Church age at the end of the seal and you have to know that you are God Eternal thoughts isn't that right and God is bringing you back to that first day the evening and the morning with the first day and that is back to the eighth day that is back to Eternity praise God and what's inside of you is your Original Seed the spoken word and all those who laugh and mock at us because be quoting from the prophet one day they're going to realize that you have been receiving original word which was the spoken word not an interpretation or explanation of what the prophet said but just what the prophet said was seated down into you no wonder the Holy Spirit told the prophet right the secret is the word is in the bride that mean they had to have Ministries pouring thus say the Lord into you I am not a prophet I don't have th say the Lord William Bram is a prophet he was that Elijah and we take the words of that Elijah and Echo it to you oh blessed be the name of the Lord he was a messenger to call a bride for Isaac could we say Amen William brandham was eleazer to call a bride for Isaac who is Isaac the mighty angel of Revelation 10 praise God first Thessalonians 4 the Lord himself Des send from with a shout God wasn't taking chances in this last day he didn't send an angel he said I myself will come down to call my bride out praise God you are not called by a man you're not called by a sister you're not called by a church you are called beyond that I am not called by a man so no man could put his hands on me I am free from the hands of man you are called by that Mighty angel from Revelation 101 Oh Glory to God do you believe that Hallelujah so my title it comes with a burden behind it it's make your calling an election sure confirm your calling confirm your election don't just take for granted your salvation don't take for granted you're in the bride you're in the message don't take that for granted make your calling and election sure get it confirmed then you cannot be defeated then you cannot be fall because you know you're part of God's Eternal thoughts that was in the back part of his mind Hallelujah and have an inspiration called by the seven tunders of Revelation 10 the elected bride only she could hear that call Hallelujah and the subject elect according to the forn knowledge of God that's the scripture we read in Peter we not elected because we come to this church You're Not Elected because they get saved and they get baptized in Jesus name you're elected based upon the for knowledge of God the for knowledge of God is what called you you could Rejoice right now in that you could shout right now just on that alone no man can interrupt ah the full knowledge of God that he elected you no man can interrupt that give you little a shout of Praise oh hallelujah praise God Amen all right praise God hallu Hallelujah for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he Jesus might be the firstborn among many Brethren so his forn knowledge is isn't that right make Make Way for his predestination because he for knew you he could predestinate you despite your smoking drinking fooling around that didn't stumble him that didn't frighten God God wasn't upset or get God getting Horrors in his mind it was already done in the back part of his mind isn't that right your election was already done and you come to fulfill it on the earth then as your faith increase in your elective quality of in God oh Hallelujah then you could truly Embrace Romans 8:28 for we know all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called Hallelujah you have to know you have been called according to his purpose Oh Glory to God Amen brother brandham from without money without price Hallelujah hallu I heard all dear beloved pastor but never make a remark on his television Radio cast the other in the morning and just went over and over my mind I just can't forget it I quoted to a friend of mine last night and that it was this after the taken away of the Holy Spirit out of the Earth this is not if this is after it will be done after the holy spirit is taken out of the earth that formal Church Rel will go right on not knowing the difference how many heard that but Bram speaking that wasn't that astounding they don't know the holy spirit amen brother so they won't know when it's gone true and there will just be going on just the same and when the last one here we go is sealed into the body of Christ not a church that's the body of Christ they will be still going on trying to bring converts to it because they don't know what it is and their formal religion will continue on just like they were now it may not sink into you like it did to me but that was an astounding statement that they'll be so far away in Rel religious rituals until they will not miss the holy spirit because they don't know what it is to begin with amen so you got to know this Holy Spirit yes sir you got to know disc comforter Hallelujah brother brand continuing God have mercy on us brother I would like to live in this life is in my desire till if even the least bit of his grieving I know it in my heart if I should do something that would grieve him I'd be able to feel it just in a moment let alone his absence he was blessing God to get conviction that if he grieving the spirit if he feeling convicted or what not it will be reaching him he don't want to be insensitive to the spirit of God he want to be sensitive to the spirit of God he said if I would do something would grieve him i' be able to feel it just in a moment see let alone his absence I don't want to be here when he's not here I want to be gone then there'll be no more blood on the mercy seat it'll be dark Smoky and black the sanctuary will have no lawyer to plead our case at that time you know the scripture say the sanctuary was smoking there was no blood in The Mercy Seat then it is Judgment there is so many entertain thing entertainment things in our days there are so many things to entice people to what we call pleasures and it's all peoples and all ages there are enticement for young people modern dances rock and roll parties and music that goes with it it's all enticing I don't care how good a home a child is brought up how it have been taught to do right if that child hasn't accepted the experience of the new birth rock and roll catches attention as quick as he hears it because it is in him and is born in him my nature a canal Spirit and the power of the devil is so great today till it catches the spirit of that little one that's why you have no time to waste you have time to pray pray for your children and get a burden that they get the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God you believe that and how much more will it do the old then that has rejected the new birth because only as your life is changed and you have been converted and born a new into the kingdom of God your nature will still be of the things of the world no matter how religious you are that's why coming to church doesn't change people saying have a spoken book doesn't change people saying they believe the message believe the seven thers that doesn't change anybody they have to be changed on the inside by the fire of God that's the only thing I'm going to change reading plenty books studying brenty books talking about senty Mysteries and changing anybody it's got to be fire fire to burn the demons out fire to burn the snake out the the John said that man is coming he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire glory to God new job ain't going to change you a raise a pay wouldn't change you a better car a better house a better wife a better house it doesn't matter say in the right place this morning because this word could change you hallelujah hallelujah you are born with a carnal spirit and there's an attraction in your spirit for what the devil have to offer but there's a holy spirit that's why God said a new heart I will give you a new spirit I will put within you and I will Jam inside that new Spirit my Holy Spirit you will live the word you will talk the word you're going to act the word it will set your soul on Fire H glory glory to God Amen every man should be on fire inside of here this message is too precious there too much of love going inside of it we want to respond to the love of God it's God love that brought you out it's God love that open your eyes it's God love that take you out to Blind L your wretched miserable naked it's the love of God that did that nothing you have done nothing you could ever do you're elected according to the full knowledge of [Applause] God [Applause] [Music] Hall unless been changed in you you could worship and be religious that's why there sh religious people with their foolishness oh yeah slam them against the wall show them the exit I have no time for that they're too late down the road we're not looking for numbers we're not looking for members we have never done that so don't play and holy holy and down inside of here we smoke you out this is this place is quite different this is where people get changed transformed demon get cast out oh glory to [Applause] God once you let Christ take the throne in your heart those things don't bother him so much greater oh you know the great things he said okay 40 years ago trying to get enough money to buy him some crutches he couldn't do it right in the most unexpected place the expected time the more unexpected insufficient people he got what he wanted I'm so glad that God does it that way in a bunch of little so-called Holy Rollers one night I found this is but mam testimony I found what I wanted what money could not buy in a bunch of illiterate uneducated listen poorly dressed people Negroes to begin with out Y in a little old converted salon on the floor on the floor I found a price a jewel when that old Dy looked in my face and said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe he didn't ask him are you the prophet are you Malachi 4 are you William brandham that was not the question he was asking he was say have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe oh let's read on it was something that I wanted I didn't expect to find it among those people but they had what I needed the United Nations today they wouldn't accept what we got but that's what they need need Cru of all the rest of them need Christ in the baptism of the Holy Ghost it will change the disposition it will make men who they hate become brothers that is what the Holy Ghost was given for Oh Glory to God it will take greed away it will take malice away it will take Strife away and put love and joy and peace and goodness and mercy that is what the Holy Ghost will do Oh Glory to God hallelujah it will make jacket and TI sit down with no tie with somebody with no tie it will make fancy clothes sit down with somebody with boring looking clothes it doesn't matter is the love of God it's one spirit it's one wedding garment it's one wedding supper it's one Millennium it's one bride groom Oh Glory to God and a many membered bride internationally around the world Lord Church could hold the bride and every church are three kind of Believers what kind are you this morning oh glory to God nobody could hold the bride pull the bride captive Christ is the head of the church he's your head this morning oh glory to God hallelujah my my my my oh glory to God this is not about your job sorry this is not about your home yet this is not about that this is about eternity this is about bride this is about leaving here this is the understand that you're just passing through here like Abraham you're a stranger you a pilgrim praise God you're seeking a situ maker and Builder is God we have have to have a way to get out of here there must be a key to get out of here the prophet brought the key to get out of here it is Rapture in faith not just normal Faith it's a faith to change you in a moment in a twinkle of an eye it's Rapture in faith we have to get to that you have to find that you have to walk into that it's a different kind of Faith all together oh glory to God it's a power God releasing in your soul all the other generation looking forward to die they to go and fall asleep but this is the only generation that has a tremendous promise to walk pass through death death had to stand still as you pass by death could only watch you but can't touch you because we shall not sleep we shall be changed in the moment in the twinkle of an eye there's the only generation there's the only people have the opportunity because God returned us back to Eden Back to Eden there was no debt there was no sickness there was no illness there was no gray here we going back to Eden we taking back the power before we leave here Satan will know the sons of God have returned back to the evening and the morning the first day we are going back to Eden okay the Lord I shout the pray but Bram demonstrated the power that was in [Applause] Eden Glory Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah in other words the sons that Adam was supposed to reproduce is being reproduced now Adam was to reproduce another Son of God In His Image and likeness but God sent Jesus who he found who he called who he called he Justified and who we Justified he had already glorified he predestinated you to be conformed to the image of his son you be seated not conformed to the church image not to conform to some man image conform to His Image every step we take must be born like Jesus okay let's go a little further now wow so when a man is by faith and walks by faith I mean substant Faith notice he didn't say when a church walks by faith or a group walk by faith or convention walk by faith he's not talking about that he's zering now to the individual when a man that's you walks by faith Talks by faith lives by faith I mean substance Fi not M Champion faith not that kind of Fai talking in my faith not that substance Abra had a substance Isaac was in him and he could speak it he believe it he had it he could prepare for it Noah had a substance Faith the rain was coming he couldn't show anybody the rain but the substance in him make him Bild a AR so once it come to substance it make you PR you have no substance if you're not on fire you have no substance if you can't worship you have no substance if you can't press substance make you act because it's revealed to you what will be but it is not yet

you to fail to fall to be an embarrassment and a disgrace to the kingdom of God this is what Satan want he want to brag look at one fall next one backslide and next one sin and next one can't make it and next one this and next one that That's what Satan want you accus of the Brethren but God want to cancel all that to let you know that what what what you did and maybe doing is was only the front part of the his mind that's the information that have nothing to do with election that just information but what devil don't understand you are elected to Deliverance so you may be see the praise Give the Lord a shout Glory the woman at the well right her five man once you was wasn't her and so on right that was information that was actual life experience and so on now Jesus come to free her so he had to pray bring her into election he have to show her she is forn she come by the for knowledge elected by the forn knowledge of God he had to pass there because she was forn of God he couldn't Miss for nothing her sins couldn't stop it the circumstances around couldn't stop it nothing she did in the past in the present or the future could have stopped it because that was an elected seed of God that was in the mind of God oh glory to God so he come to show you I for knew you woman you are higher than that you can live above that and I'm telling you you could live above sin above the world above everything the devil could offer you can yes you can yes you can yes you can give the Lord a [Applause] shout so says when a man lives by faith walks by faith I mean substance Faith he is isol ated from the entire world and become a new creature in Christ so what anybody does doesn't affect you somebody say can't make it day but he can't make it that not affecting you they have no

in church is bride he said no when you walk by this kind of faith when you act by faith live by faith substance Faith you're now getting into bright material but if that the that the case the bright material is shorten know sir because this means that you reach up to a point where like David said don't 10,000 fall on my right side I shall not be moved other words David will step over dead bodies he said oh god look how much dead I go dead too no not David don't 10,000 fall on my right side I shall not be moved because I have a revelation of my election to sit on that Throne that Saul is temporary on oh give the Lord a shout in the house so don't even know he's fired but David fighting for his life running for his life so David C elected waiting for SE Sean Saul to dead but Saul will kill him because Saul is after him David had to fight and run and hide and do everything but he knew he was ordained to be dear because Samuel horn oil anointed him to be king over Israel and you are Kings and Priests not servants and slaves oh God we CH inside of here you heard what I said you are Kings and Priests unto God how dare the devil want to use you like a mop come on give the Lord a shout in the house come on man I want to see people free up inside of [Applause] here God I'm looking for healings to break out miracles to break out praise God let God take you beyond your what

fear this whatnot Fe they cut the pay Fe all kind of thing oh yeah fear no fear and faith can live together when that demon knocking the door left Faith open the door and see what happened demon had to take off you know because faith is a conqueror faith is fearless you know Faith does find resources when there is none look at Samson thousand Philistines and take a little jaw and to beat them fellas and overcome all of them David without a SCE I'll cut your head off fith does fine things and create things and make things and stir things and arrange things and flip things that what it [Music] does David didn't say I'm not tall as those guys I'm not trainer as those guys I'm not a soldier as those guys that has nothing to do with David when David get locked in with that isolation his brothers tried to shame him and everything else he shake that off all people that discouraged he shake that off also he said I'll cut your head off you come to me with shield and spe but I come to you in the name of the [Music] Lord and I come to you what I have I have a sling and I have a stone I have a sling and I have a rock I have a sling I have a revelation I have Dynamics yet but I have a revelation and if the Holy Spirit could take a hole upon that Revelation gol coming down come on say Amen somebody that's why divine revelation is the most powerful thing that could happen to you it makes you Fearless it makes you challenge a system it make you see what's impossible and make it possible because all things are possible to them that believes it D not believe may be seated at the wedding they tell Jesus the wine run [Music] out think about that he was a guest like everybody else but they said the wine ran out amen say what what I do with me but then instructions come whatever he said do it he say just go and draw water one draw the water just just just take water just take water and when they pour it was wine that same word that they have that's turn into wine because Jesus give instruction just take it just pour it wine is power wine have fire in it whyne are fervent in it you could be sick in here but if wine hit you oh oh it brings excitement it brings stimulation of Revelation water can't do that you have to lock down wine because it have something billing inside of it you can't put wine and all bottles it going to break the bottle and you're going to lose the wine so you better become a new bottle right now right now stretch and give and say hallelujah say glory to God praise God praise God [Applause] that's why the devil fight worship yeah the devil fight praises and worship because worship and and Praises is an atmosphere he cannot abide in and anytime you get in that Spirit atmosphere there's a possibility Revelation break upon your spirit break upon your soul demons leave your life demons leave your home that woman with the daughter Vex the devil she came and worship the first thing she did she worship Hallelujah glory to God

matter God is able and they going straight down to fiery furnace and but brand says all the fire did was to lose their bands that is selective burning h h i when that devil thought the fire that was coming upon your life was going to crush you and burn you out they don't understand your trial set you free your pressure give you a breakthrough your pressure your pain your suffering your sorrow did something better for you oh give the Lord I scream in the house Glory Glory the fire just set them free the fire broke them out your pressure going to break you out don't tell the devil don't let the devil feel he going to break you in you're going to break out of that prison and once you're out of that prison you're out of it because who the son of man set free free indeed brother telling them in I know your tribulation I am not all unmindful of your suffering what a stumbling block this is to many people like Israel they wonder if God already loves them how can God be just and loving if he stands by and watch his people suffer oh my and that's what m they had in Malachi 1 1:3 the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi I have loved you see the Lord yet be say wherein has you loved us God tell him I love you but they say wait what love you talking about no food no meat but I have Lov you say the Lord yet you see when low us was not Esau Jacob's brother say the Lord yet I love Jacob and I hated Esau and L his Mountain his her should waste for the dragons of the wilderness you see they could not figure out God's love they thought here we go that love meant no [Music] suffering 60% you all thinking that same thing too all right let's go over again they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care looks thaty nice child right that is what they taught but that is not the love that God has are you ready to hear what God love is about all right but God said his love was elective love the proof of his love is election and today we say make your calling and election sure the proof of his love no one that Jesus told disciples don't Rejoice because the devils are subject to you but Rejoice because your name is written in [Applause] heaven my I want if you got that I want if you understand that do you understand when John when the lamb took the book and start to break them SE John begin to shout and praise God because he saw his name he saw his election he saw the back part of the book as it was he saw where he come from nothing could change that no devil could he ER raas that listen your family history has nothing to do with that Glory do you get that I don't care if your mother was a prostitute that has nothing to do with you your father was a drunker that has nothing to do with you God love his elective love he put you and pass you you that but it's you he called it's who he found you he called come on say Amen somebody the proof of his love his election that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation because God has chosen you unto salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth though he was a son Jesus he learned obedience by the things that he suffered oh blessed be the name of the Lord oh Hallelujah my God is saying open up to me this Mighty angel of Revelation 10 1 Thessalonians 4 the Lord himself Des s with a shout oh to get the bride out it's a bride call by 7even tunders version 10 3 and 4 to GA her bride together to get her bride out to prepare that bride oh Hallelujah see people take for granted day in the message and that's for granted but Peter said add amen you save people with faith with the baptism of the Holy Ghost add add to your faith prove your election confirm your election by giving diligence to bring fruit don't stay at seed level let break out Blossom push forth press to the stalk press with the leaves press to come back the fruit don't just stay where you are you got to act to produce something oh glory to God hallelujah praise God he said he that lack these things is blind and a keeper has forgotten that he was ped of his old sins so then you keep connecting back to Old sins something is wrong if you connect him back to Old sins because he Purge you from old sins don't bring back them old sins don't reconnect with them old sin something messing with your mind Bible said be transformed by the renewing of your mind if God could change here and it could happen to activate something down here it's a different thing all together transformed by the renewing of your mind you have to have a word brother brand said the life the life the stalk back there carry the life you said the shock has to pull away to give give the wheat a chance to lay before the sunallah so when this message came this message called Tre kind of Believers including shock and that would shock hand out books plate tapes bring people to the Lord all kind of shock and after many years they gone they pull away they couldn't handle it and whatnot as the Sun get hotter shocks dry up you because shock is not seed the seed could take the heat you knows have hot sun call the hot July Sun but the hot July sun is to righten seed but it is bun shock so when they shock balling for Sun and talking about pressure pressure pressure the scen the seat saying golden brown golden brown golden brown golden brown the seed is not complaining the seed is not yeah you ever see people yeah we calling me yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah always have a complaint like not seed shock yeah yeah but seed the sun take the greenness out because you're pushing to you're pushing to forgiveness you're pushing to love you're pushing to care you're pushing to reach out you're pushing to extend beyond you you don't want to be you you want to be Christ he took your place come on now that you could take his place come on preach back to me help me preach somebody so for 10 years I I don't mix you know I don't talk to nobody after 10 years it's not talking nobody you're same way as you was 10 years ago but if you're pushing to be like Christ you press you reach out you comfort you encourage isn't that you lift somebody up you encourage somebody and so on that's what you do because you get them to be more like Jesus you're getting more selfless because you come from selfish to selfless it's a Walk of Life you're born in sin shape have your family flag and your name of your family on your head Hallelujah your family Born Into You Can't nothing about it Jones family is Jones they call you Jim no don't mean Jim Jones let me let me get somebody name John they call you John nothing you could do about Jim no John nothing you could do about Jones you're born in the Jones family and they spell a that in you and said you are John so you come on JN Jones but the most important name is the name you make for [Applause] yourself so your father could be Bank Rubber and your mother could be the bank rubber assistant but that don't mean you are Bank rubber you didn't born Bank rubber that's the that the Joneses that's the parents Joneses praise God you are Jon Jones and because you want to serve Christ God going to bless you and prosper you and protect you and hold you and love you oh trust him stop this screaming balling thing and begin to do this praising glorifying God thing not only in the good times but in the bad times in the hard times in the rough times Oh Glory to God and when you do that you are demonstrating to God you have faith that he going to work all things well oh glory to God so the life that was in the stock the life went into Wesley and one big blade don't look like the grain when the pollen come the sh Chuck watch so therefore the life keep traveling on isn't that right but the BR I'm talking about so the life is what can of denominated after the life pass through denomination denomination denomination but they have to have something that cannot be denomination which is the life itself and that life is Faith virtue knowledge that life cannot be denominated you can box that in you can legate that in you got put clothes on that and say it have to be so that's the life it will break out will push out isn't that right say Moses called a nation out of a Nation here we go Christ today is calling a church out of a church Christ is calling what church a church out of a church taking them to that promised Eternal that glorious Eternal promised land so there's church but the s t Rion 10 comes to call a bride out of the church don't stay in church come out to be bride respond to the call this Mighty angel came down and CED with a l voice seven th straight voices out Revelation 10 is mighty Angel that's Christ your husband R 107 is the messenger that's your elaser version 10 8 to 11 that's the pride on the Earth right now prophesying from the book Oh Glory to Lord speaking your deliverance speaking your 8 day holy convocation speaking your Revival speaking the quicking power coming upon you your life speak in your transformation speak in Rapture in faith that's that's coming from the book we can only speak from the book glory to God we are not normal preachers this not Pentecostal preaching this is the book being open the full book being open Oh Glory to God are you with me now brother said to refuse the person that's doing the calling I love that Christ no matter if you're Methodist Lutheran nothing against them not at all but in this age you have got to accept like you did in that age the person of Christ which is the word so now we come down church is not a feeling not an emotion not a nice thing and a nice feeling and your no no no it's the word so after all after all the shout and all the praise and the worship it comes right back to what God Said in his word oh hallelujah praise God so the only way to do is not say I belong to assemblies I what I have people saying today this is the group this is the kingdom this is it uh we have the man of the hour Church of the hour everything of the hour I belong to Oneness Tess whatever it is all of them there I belong to the Church of God that don't mean a thing he said our father shouted and danced that's perfectly all right but that was their day but today you are confronted not with the organization they made but with the life that is going on which is Jesus Christ so that's why she's striving for that life not just to belong to another group so no matter how religious you are how many churches you belong to how many books your name is on if that genuine Holy Ghost is in you which is this word manifested you will see the message of the hour because it's the holy ghost that does it it's the inspiration that have to strike you so sometime we talking about talking and sharing the word and so on but it will take inspiration he said the elected of God seemed it in Noah's time Moses time Jesus time the apostles time Luther's time Wesley time Pentecostal time because that was the seed was on the earth when this inspiration was poured out now while the inspiration is poured out to gather the bride together it is only the elected will see it amen so he prophesying that an inspiration will be poured out to gather the bright together only the elected could see it because the elected is really the inspiration the seed of the inspiration itself so you are seeds of God waiting for inspiration to pick you up because once you're inspired it changes all everything listen you ordinary folks un let the Spirit come upon you fire come upon you don't let the devil the devil playing with with amen he playing with fire the devil is playing with fire hallelujah praise God because Samson was a normal guy no big muscles but when the spirit come upon him he was bigger than he looked he was stronger than he looked because there was a bigger power upon him and when this Dynamics this headstone this Capstone this Bond of perfectness This Love This charity never failed when that come upon that bride biger and she looks more powerful than she looks bam says we wouldn't pray for the sick then we would command it not even lay hands on us we command them Devils to come out command the blind to see command the lame to walk command the dumb to speak commanded speak walk see glory to God do you believe that do you going ins inside that channel there Hallelujah so now while the inspiration is poured out the gathered right together it will those only those elected that will see it oh praise the name of the Lord question and answers but Brandon will there be is there now a place for the bright to gather together to live like when Moses led the children of Israel that that's a big question I'm going to answer that question for you it was just revealed to me I'm going to tell you the truth yes sir there's a place for all the bride to gather you want to know where it is it's in Christ Oh I thought I thought was some San Fernando no amen I thought it was a place in America no what about Europe what about Africa what about sou America oh mean that's not a place no the place is in Christ but how do you get into Christ by one Spirit you are baptized into one body press pren [Applause] press this is serious stuff this is not skim milk this is serious stuff hallelujah praise God the word rapture is not even the Bible he said is to be caught up I would not have you Brethren considering them that are asleep that you sorrow not as others who have no hope for if we believe that Christ rose again from the dead them that sleep in Christ Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the will of the Lord that we which alive and remain unto the com of the Lord shall not prevent which means to hinder those who are asleep for the Lord himself shall send of him with a shout this is brother I'm interpreting in that he said I want you to notice a great thing take place here now don't miss this he said treatings there's treatings that has to happen before the Lord himself appears three things so now a shout a voice a trumpet the Lord himself three things happen a shout a voice a trumpet has to happen before Jesus appear a shout what is the shout it's the message going forth amen the living bread of life bringing forth the bride Hallelujah so Revelation 10 what was the message seven tunders that was the message Amen to call a bride together yes sir to gather the bride to give the bride Faith to show the bride how to prepare every mystery under the seven seal every mystery that has been revealed every Miss reflected in type praise God isn't that right first seal second seal third seal history fourth seal amen payos Rider right into hell as it was that's that's his that's that's prophecy fifth seals Jews SS under the altar six seals judgment earthquake all right seven seal silence that's where you come in that's where God hide you in that silence Hallelujah and God took the voices of the seven tunders from the back of the book and put it under the silence and said that's the first fold of the mystery behind that silence you said when the seventh seal break it starts in silence Oh Glory to God but when it finishes we supposed to be way up there to know who God is how he lives his nature his being we supposed to be all the way up there all the of the way to Dear to Faith to Virtue to knowledge we supposed to be standing ready to break into that Eternal Church age at the end of the seven SE Oh Glory to God we have to press Brethren not to belong to this message that we belong to the Eighth Day hallelujah oh glory to God Hallelujah the bride is going to a city other going to be outside the city but the bride going to be in the city that his house for the bride oh that's where is taking his bride into the city after a thousand years honeymoon that sounds good to me I will take that thousand years I I will take that that sounds great to me three and 1 half years wedding supper that sounds good too people take that 3 and 1/ half years in supper either you take that or you take three and 1/ half years tribulation period oh give the Lord a shout in the house which one you want to take you have an option on the table three and half year tribulation three and half years bread and supper Oh Glory to God hallelujah Glory Hall glory to God let us rejoice let us be glad for the marage of the Lamb has come and his wife Glory Glory Oh Glory Hallelujah his wife had made herself ready me see let me bring it down a different way it hallu seven times me show the bride all right so God come and show the dress The Veil The bouet the flowers the shoes all the trail behind and you're watching it church members watching it may be taking pictures with it they must be getting selfie and Bing picture thing but the bride she putting it on she put on the shoes she adjusting the dress she fixing herself that's what we talking about not because the word say you are elected according to for knowledge you going sit down and wait for somebody to dress you stay there church member not bride Bible said his wife his wife not not not not not bridesmaid come on now not bride assistant not not bride supporters his wife not going to just watch it but she going to act upon it Oh Glory to God his wife has made ready by doing what putting on virtue knowledge Temperance patience gness brotherly kindness what you doing you are making yourself ready for the Rapture for the going home we are going home we are going to leave here oh glory to God praise God one day the last sermon going be preached to God people become the church and the pastor is gone not going 6 feet down you know going like Enoch he walked with God and was not for God took him God going to take a people a gentile bride Jesus waited 2,000 years no wonder he said wait till the anointing of God strike home God will do in one year what all the theologians fail to do in 2,000 years this lovely Gentile praise God you're going to prove your election by your sanctification you're going to prove your election by your life Hallelujah you will prove your election by your PR oh Hallelujah so what's the shout is the message going forth to bring forth the bride then he said the first thing happens he start sending with there's a shout what is it the message to get the people together oh glory to God so what the shout is a message to get the people together the shout is a messenger getting the people ready so brother brandham brought a message to gather the bride together isn't that right Revelation book of symbols brother Bram first seal no let first seal he said there's coming for seven mysterious Thunders that not even written at all and I believe through those seven tunders will be revealed in the last day in order to get the bright together Hallelujah for Rapture in faith so the shout and the tunders is the same thing the shout was sent to gather the bride together to bring her into rapturing fith that means to bring her to her individual inheritance amen Oh Glory to God you understand that this this wasn't preached years ago you know because people just wanted to be in church think that they in a church they in the message but as your mature and as the years Roll by you recognize it come down to individual inheritance because Joshua was given three things to do cross the people over fight and divide the land so I am saying we have crossed over we have been fighting for years years years now it's land division time adoption is not a church thing I had a revelation that years ago that the people can't vote their Pastor to be adopted amen adop adoption is not between the church and the pastor adoption is between God and His son amen I understood that years ago that's why I never study about the people what they think and what they feel at the end of the day I have to please him no no no I'm not trying to preach you happy I'm trying to say what he told me to [Applause] say he he gave me this inspiration TS make your corection sure I written out talk about it a little bit in the prayer meeting hallelujah hallu hallelujah and that's what I feel to bring to you this morning don't take your testimony for granted you know like some people they backsliding and they say you know I'm um I'm they a child of God and you know it's so flimsy and the day smoking you know God bring me back and I give them God his Pals and all that is just intellect you know amen that's not down here you no that's not not they just PL intellectual Samson knew he's a son of godu he was covenanted Samson tasted the power of God he knew it but he was fooling around fooling around fool get mess with theila and in it all he still have the connection because a son have access right to father I was thinking about my own Sons I said but wait a minute we what they do they my sons I deny them I can't change the front name and second name and say you know you know I don't know who you are turn my back on them regardless of what they still my sons because they were bed from me amen and regardless of what you have been bed from [Applause] God so regardless of what you do how you do you are still Sons but it's what kind so adoption have to do with Father and Son not church so people love the minister love the pastor and what that's fine that's good everything else but that love and that clap and Applause and shaking his hand and S that doesn't make him adopted so Daniel was told by the angel he heard seven Thunders Daniel heard it too they utter the voices Daniel grabbed the pen to write said don't write it don't write it on the back of the Bible watch he said John saw the same thing it was already watch it had already been written outside of the Bible and had seven seals on the back of the book that no man could open those seals first he described them as seals hear this now that was them voices amen so the back of the book had seven voices yes sir which is also Seven Seals isn't that right so he took those voices on the back of the book and put it inside the book under the seven seal seven tunders UT the voices hallelujah oh Hallelujah no man know what it was but the Bible said and told Daniel and also John that in the last days these seven voices would be known by the real true church so a church that not preaching the seven tunders forget it Hallelujah they're preaching to to church material which we have lots of material of it's an abundance but bright material the seven will produce that because the seven T is produced another Ephesians which will come back to defeat and the faith in you means you survive as an individual if this church collapses and demolish you still survive amen if trainers split up in a 100 pass you will survive with your faith because it's not man that call you as God that called you you have to have a revelation who called you isn't that right oh glory to God and no man could take that calling no man could go between that calling is not you and somebody else and God no it's you and God isn't that right praise God hallelujah oh my hallelujah praise God praise bam says there's a time of time where Jesus ain't going to stand outside your door and knock all the time there's a time when he get enough and turn away then you will do the knocking and you'll never find him come while it is time come while there's a knock don't you compromise with anything less than the baptism of the Holy Ghost like they got at Pentecost amen oh praise God don't let your heart settle for nothing less than that oh praise the name of the Lord so Church it come down to this hour now and I feel it very very serious that is each individual have to make your calling an election sure it's not good enough to say Jesus save me it's not good enough to know that you get baptized in Jesus name and you're saved you want to know what you are called onto you really want to know what you look on to but say election looks back to for knowledge that's where election comes from the for knowledge of God wait a minute I'm elected yes how elected he for knew me I am elected on the for knowledge of God the for knowledge of God elected me then watch then what B says now and predestination looks to Destiny what you are predetermined to be amen so you not be it yet but you are predetermined to be what God

only because of election you are The sinless Virtuous bride of Jesus Christ you are Justified as if they never did in the first place [Music] you had representation by predestination you wasn't supposed to fall but because Adam did you fell Christ restore you you are going to wreck my Jesus do you see it I don't want to keep it long again or do you see it Christ took your place that you could take his place the object is not to make a nice Church the up is to return back to the kingdom God mystery watch his in the back part of his mind he was too mysterious his object was to reveal himself then to have the preeminence then to go back to Eden we are not going back to another church church age over we going back to Eden so demonstrate eaten power amen amen amen little fishy I give

trouble already go take him out praise the name of the Lord so the com of the Lord is so emminent the com of judgment he's calling the elected together in Oneness with himself amen not a church you f I might be overemphasizing that and all these man Spirit thing I have to do that I can't say it enough because man have again come in the message going downhill with Spirit of man so God promised through the prophet I'll ride this through once more amen yeah the spirit have to ride again the spirit itself have to mount a bride to give the bride a voice this one have a quot that one have a quot but when The Voice come the spirit anoints the bride to give the bride a voice and I'm going to say going to be seven voices going be thundering a bride with signs one of the Miracles with a demonstration of power UND spot to prove it un the spot no talk now no prophesying now confirming on the spot when brother R had his Services confirmation was on the spot after every service he say you know what I'm waiting on I'm waiting on the angel of the Lord then he's talking a little bit he said he is here praise God he's ready now I take every Spirit under my control I look if Satan himself was there every Spirit under my control for the glory of God we are coming back to that he said I'll ride Israel once more we are coming back to the Supreme anointing knowing what and how glory to God we are coming back to a super Church to a super race as we near The Headstone Glory what is he doing here we go he called the elect to make the lutherans Oh Brother ID God already calling the elect yes Abraham was elect L was addition L was church member L was family coming too but Abraham was the elect he calling the elect to make the lutherans he called the elect out of the lutherans to make the wans he call out the elect out of resan to make the Pentecostals now he's calling the elect Pentecostal out to make the headstone so this elect bride is going to become headone The Headstone watch watch to come into it so you going to become God's house or God's Temple for him to step into Earth he's going to wear your tie he's going to put on your dress he's going to put on your shoes because you are going to be the headstone Capstone magnet bride to pull up the rest from the grave come on say Amen somebody give the Lord a shout in the house now he's calling the elect Pentecostal out to make the headstone to come into it a very same kind of ministry dropping write in on it calling his children from all denominations and all walks of life oh praise the name of the Lord amen so friends to me what is the evidence if you're not establishing the present truth amen if you don't know where you're at Hallelujah this is what the word supposed to do bring you to a spot where you could know where you at it cannot be you're not sure it cannot be you're not convinced it cannot be after all these years you and if Sav and and in and out it cannot be that it has to be an anchored Revelation that your name is on that book that you're elected according to for knowledge of God now Peter stumbled so Peter know about falling Peter denied Christ so he was qualified to testify if you do these things you shall never fall he knew what falling is about so he knew what to do to not to fall a you are you with me now Peter understood that am so they could share that with us having escaped the corruption does the virtual lust strong desires your own self-will your own desires you want to push that aside to come into the will of God the program of God for your life Hallelujah you start to get a higher desire to do the will of God to connect to the purpose of God and that's why this morning the holy spirit is saying make your calling an election sure confirm it reaffirm it let it be Vindicated that you might know your sunship and your godship is intact that you'll have confidence to face tomorrow with certainty with confidence with Assurance you need that could devil make minc meat with your outside without the Assurance of your calling and your election God didn't call you to defeat God call it to Victory God call it to overcome only the overcome ones will be set and be replaced oh hallelujah praise the name of the Lord praise be to Jesus Hallelujah so purpose of the Bride is to come into this bride body come baptize into the body come into one mind one Accord come into Perfection to raise the dead I'm almost true oh praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise be to Jesus oh could we give all some Praises so when Peter said he that lack these things is blind and C far off he is showing clearly that being forgiven of your sins does not mean you automatically grow God let me say it again when Peter said he that lacked these things is blind can't see a far off and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins proven that being purged from your sins doesn't automatically make you climb up that tree say means your election to Salvation your election to Faith put you in a position to give all diligence add press push you have to be do that every day adding pressing pushing it cannot be I my sins forgive Rejoice ye children babes babes I write to you children because your sins are forgiven it has to go beyond that amen because want God want you to go beyond young men and God want you to become fathers which is adopted Sons God want you to come into spiritual maturity because he can't give children inheritance you give Sons inheritance mature Sons right Sons mature Sons so God wants to come into spiritual maturity that he could lose powers on you God not stingy you know God not holding back and holding back because God stingy it's not that it's character you want to connect with look if a man that can handle power power to trip people money does trip people big thing do trip people God understand that is human nature power Prime Minister President whatever it the CEO whatever mess people up because the character is not there to manage it so God bring a word message to bring character in because the dynamic struck the Pentecostal and they couldn't produce Jesus Christ they produced gifts with all the power tongues interpretation and Men commit in adultery and fooling wrong under that Dynamic inspiration so he brought the prophet with the word which will produce character but the trial of your faith because cor is not a gift Hallelujah Glory Faith virtue knowledge and is not gifts is you have to press into it trials and and and and tribulations and whatever shape you into it the Bible call about being formed into the image of the word formed shipped he out cut out I'm hear much amen but I'm still preaching it we have call PR message and that PR to be cut and honed he talk about Razor Edge he used the word about honed that is gr into a fine Edge Hallelujah scraping you off real good all your ways all your attitudes have to be scraped off shaped off cut off glory to God do you want to be changed or you want to remain as you are make a calling and sure Oh Glory to God your present condition has nothing to do with your future Destiny in God don't let it will tie you up you may be messed up right now that doesn't mean you messed up later on that's right God come to get you out of that isn't that right glory to God glory to God hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord thank you Jesus so he is see Peter is saying get the reassurance of your calling in God get the reassurance of your election in God and if you do these things you will never fall oh praise the name of the Lord thank you Jesus Oh Glory to God hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise be to Jesus Glory Hallelujah praise God praise God so to make a COR lection chice more than coming to the church right it's more than coming to make to Sunday to to that people wouldn't think it backslide Hallelujah I'm almost done we have some more here Romans 9:11 for the children not being born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election my stand not of works but of him that call it Amplified say it even so in order to carry out God's purpose and the children were yet unborn and had so far done nothing either good or evil even so in order further to Carri God's purpose of selection election and choice which depends not on works of what man can do but on him who calls him so this election and choice has nothing to do with you amen it has to do with him and your response to that election is where your labor comes in is where your pring comes in is where your behavior comes in to be found worthy of the love that God has extended towards you and the grace and the elective love he has ministered to you Hallelujah who can lay charge to God's elect Hallelujah who can bring any charge against God elect it is God who justify that is who puts it in right relation to himself who shall come forward and accuse or impeach Those whom God have chosen blessed is the man in whom God impute no sin is that what David said all right so as we hit the home stretch Colossians 31 12 put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved BS of mercies kind kindness humbleness of Mind meekness suffering longsuffering I see no arrogance there I see no Pride there I see no I am better than you there I see I'm the boss over you there I I'm not seeing that I want to read it again if you come to the revelation of your election here what to put on you have to put it on it's not automatically on ah we want to cancel all this automatic thing amen as I told them in France it's not an automatic gears you had to throw first gear second gear you had to throw in Gears nice to try automatic but this is TR gear time you have to apply things his wife had made herself ready didn't said the wife wait for the dress to drop down and was fully clothed no the wife had a work to do it have things to apply that you must apply so put on therefore as elect of God holy and beloved bows of mercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness and longsuffering and in the Amplified sometime I like to read the Amplified listen what it said clothe yourselves therefore as God's Own chosen ones his own picked Representatives who are purified and holy and well beloved by God himself by putting on Behavior marked by Behavior put it on marked by tenderhearted pity and mercy kind feeling a lowly opinion of your yourself gentle ways and patience which is tireless and longsuffering and has the power to endure whatever comes good with good with good temper Hallelujah could we say Amen am let's continue verse 13 forbearing one another and forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any even must Christ forgive you so also do ye it has no authority to continue to Grudge or hold the ODS or perpetuate animosity there is no Authority to do that be gentle and forbearing with one another and if one has a difference a grievance or complaints against another readily pardoning each other even as the Lord has freely given and forgiven you it has no I go forgive he if if if he repent it have have nothing to do with that I'm waiting for she to come to me it have nothing to do with that above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness above all these put on love unfold yourselves with the bond of perfectness which binds everything together completely and in an ideal Harmony and let the peace of God rule in your hearts to which also you are called in one body and big one be thankful don't don't don't be thankful oh hallelujah praise be to Jesus could you some [Applause] more Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your hearts unto the Lord and whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of Jesus Christ giving thanks to God and Father by him this is something to live by you can't go any B in the name of Jesus Christ you can't smoke in Jesus name you can't drink in Jesus name you can't go on flirt in Jesus name let me say it again you can't go and flirt in Jesus name even if you say am whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ giving thanks oh praise God praise God oh man has an equipment oh boy something I want to get to but a brand and adoption the purpose of this is seeing your position in Christ seeing that it's not something that you just tumbled into okay this is important something that might you Merit it somewhere it is what God did for you himself not that you were so good you went to church one night and some poor brother LED you to the altar it wasn't that it was God before the foundation of the world predestinated you to eternal life when you get there no Wonder 24 Elders laid their crowns everybody laid on their crowns everyone fell on their faces they didn't have one thing they could say no preacher no Elder no nothing all praise to the lamb nobody can say I pray more than this brother I pray longer than this sister no we have nothing to say is it's Crown pelting down and and face on the ground Bing Worthy is the Lamb Oh Glory to God isn't that right where in bounded towards us in all wisdom and Prudence praise God watch having made to known to us the mystery of his will look at those words having made known to us the mystery of his will let a prophet put the magnifying glass in that the mysteries of his will and remember how we hung on that how many was here this morning let's see how we stuck on that the mystery of his will now it is not just a little thing it's a mystery God's will he's going deeper is a mystery and each man here we go you see you elected right am how many believe they elected I I I I'm not seeing those hand reallu it's God seeing those hands hallelujah hallelujah all right but listen now God's will is a mystery and each man has to seek out the will of God for his or her life so this is not automatic that's why the elect will have a certain Behavior the elect will seek the mystery of his will am God have born words your will is not the will of God for your life is not just to get grow up in church get subjects get a job get married got children and just die it has to have a higher purpose than that Hallelujah okay question and answers how does one know their rightful position in the body of Christ that's a good one how does one knows that's the kind of question amongst many of us here tonight how do you rightfully know I am presuming that this brother wants to know what position what in Christ what part of Christ do I play now for instance I like to say this brother to give you the best answer I know your position in Christ is revealed to you by the Holy Spirit one and then if you want to know if you want to know whether it is the holy spirit or not find out whether He blesses what you're doing or not if he blesses it then it's him if he doesn't bless like somebody said to me long ago the Lord called me to preach I said well then preach he said well you see I really think it's so Satan he can get somebody to act like that and then deceive them and just what he wants to do the whole point the world points the finger right there somebody thinks they have a gift of speaking in tongues interpretation has the gift of Divine Healing some of these things some sometimes they are mistaken in those things and sometime they think they haven't got it and when they have It's Tricky so always do this Brethren when you feel you're supposed to do a thing find out if it's scripture for you to do it not just wrote in one place I mean completely scriptural Through the Bible for you to go and do it and so on then you talk about your motive and objective and so on like that so that is very very interesting so praise God he say if a man came to be a pastor and he's real flighty and so on he said the Lord called me to such and such to be a pastor a pastor can't be a flighty person a pastor is solid a pastor is song just a few more ref finish Jesus had perfect Faith he had it he it it because he was the word and you become the word as you receive the word amen amen hallelujah glory and that receiving there is inwardly and willingly not outwardly inwardly and willingly so when you hear the word say you are elected you receive that when your words say you are forgiven you receive that when the words say you are Justified you're not studying what is happen no you receive that inwardly and willingly praise God now watch he said to us if you abide in me and I would abide in you you can ask what you will it shall be done then recognize your position in the scripture as a Believer you got to recognize your position as he recognize his position amen oh my I love this one and you are just as important as Billy Gram now you see we notice they've got so many bigrams today but you see God never made God made one Billy gram and you are just as important as Billy gram or robers or any one of those famous men you are just as important until you get out of your place so in your place you are in your element yes sir in your place you are fine in your place is when you could have faith to believe God for anything when you're in your place Hallelujah then you are no God at all when you out of place you are hindrance when a wife out of a place in a home is problem in the home when a husband out of place in a home it's problem in the home a wife thinks she's so spiritual she must her husband and she have things cucko things Al together oh my Hallelujah you have to come back in your place regardless of what the husband do see what the wife supposed to do and the wife supposed to behave and you appli that to your life you're not saying if he do this I could do this it doesn't work so it has a role for the man it have a role for the woman the husband have to behave how the scripture say supposed to behave husband love your wife because that's the word and she must know if you love because you will show it you demonstrate it you would act act it out isn't that right children obey your parents that's the word now didn't say fight your parents that's the word obey your parents you may disagree with your parents but obey them and in obeying them you get a blessing Hallelujah your parents may not be right they ex may be down to board and they're doing the best that they can to save you from yourself but obey them because the word said so so then you are in the word now and God blessing you because you keep in the word oh hallelujah praise God so therefore if so therefore praise God so stay in your position stay what God made you and then it will operate right now the Methodist say when you shout you got it a lot of them shouted didn't have it the Pentecost said when you speak in Tong you got it many speak in Tong didn't have it he said now watch the Pharisees but when the word was made manifest they didn't recognize it he said now if you are in the B bride if you are in the bride the bride is part of the husband the only place you'll ever recognize it is to recognize what part of the husband that word you are you can't this is a big one this is huge you can't oh listen say it back again the only place you would ever recognize it is to recognize what part of that husband that word you are or you can't recognize being the bride how many sees that you have to recognize your position here the big one you can't recognize somebody else don't have to fix nobody there are too many people trying to fix others and they can't fix their own self you can't recognize somebody else position the past have a role to do certain things not you don't try to take up that role oh Hallelujah so you cannot recognize somebody else position you could only recognize yours that's why we say to you this morning make your calling and your election sure you can't make that for your brother your sister your husband your wife or children you have to make your calling an election show hallelujah oh praise the name of the Lord when you see not a good neighbor but a Son of God molded in the image of God with the dynamic power of God to answer the request for today that he see yesterday forever then no hin going to hold you he hunts for his man he's a eag to begin with and he recognize it I know people flop in church fail and fall and whatnot and the ministry and the pastor hold them people to the sin and lock them in bondage for years and you know what you do and that person yeah I know what I do but when that eagle come and bring that eagle to Eagle call who he for you when you hit the full knowledge of God when you reach up now in for knowledge of God it have no you know what to do you may remember and remember some of the things I've done but Jesus with his special blood forgive me of everyone Jesus dropped the charges all right just about two more we almost done here man am Hallelujah we do very good today this was a big one but decid to deliver sometimes you have to separate from everything that's there on Earth to You Amen to take your position that God has called you to there's a complete meal tonight this service they complete you have to listen back to it lot of stuff inside of it sometime you have to separate yourself from everything that's there to you on Earth to take your position that God has called you to I am sure you can read between the lines what I'm saying sometimes the very nearest person on Earth you have to shake hands with them to take your position in Christ where God has called you well what is God doing transforming you from what you was maybe a daughter or son whatever it is from a lovely family sometimes he places you somewhere else who does that God does that take you from your lovely family because your family is your family and your family is hindering you because all you know is what they say it come like the little circle you in that's all you hear and that is your world might be a alternative world but when God take you out is to break you out God take you out your family setting he never tell stay there he said come up from among your people come among the family he was drifting into people that was different that's right because he had to walk by faith and when God pull that cord upon you he make you make movement you didn't expect to move Hallelujah Abra become a Drifter seeking a city who make and Builder is God oh Hallelujah Glory transforming you from what you was he places you somewhere else because it is his way Hallelujah of by Renewing Your Mind to obey the word regardless of the price so if God want to see if you want to qualify if you're prepared to take the price he give you a big challenge am and if you can't pay the price you back down but if you pay the price you walk the walk Hallelujah and you walk the talk oh Hallelujah glory to God but bam get the hand of God upon Him heavily when he didn't want to go among the Pentecostals when he listened to his mother-in-law he lost his wife he lost his daughter but God was testing him he had to pay a price he had to help other people and he couldn't help his own family and when the devil was pressing him look you're serving God and he just said it the Lord give and the Lord take it away blessed be the name of the Lord that's what we talking about Hallelujah are you ready our Redemption wasn't a cheap thing it was the son of God that died for us things of value come to a of a great price to bring this
