[36:53] the most new wrecking times the first
[36:55] two minutes as you stand here but by
[36:57] God's grace we're gonna make it through
[36:59] I I I I prayed as I came and I said I
[37:02] want to be like a clinical swordsman you
[37:05] know I don't want to waste words I don't
[37:07] want to waste time I want to really
[37:09] bring the message home really deliver
[37:11] what God has placed upon my heart and
[37:14] with that said for a title
[37:16] I just want to say preparation for
[37:19] visitation
[37:21] you know preparation for visitation very
[37:23] very simple preparation for visitation
[37:26] and in the natural you know some persons
[37:29] would have just gone through that
[37:30] Thanksgiving period and we have the
[37:32] Christmas holidays coming up as it were
[37:34] and a lot of us find ourselves in
[37:37] preparation mode
[37:39] you know
[37:40] we find ourselves in a position in which
[37:43] we we want to perhaps clean out and and
[37:47] cook and and do the things that we
[37:49] believe we need to do to prepare for not
[37:52] just a season but but in anticipation of
[37:55] guests in anticipation of visitors and
[37:58] it's the same way that God would want us
[38:01] to prepare our hearts and prepare our
[38:02] lives and prepare our attitudes Lord the
[38:05] atmosphere around us must be prepared
[38:07] for his visitation for the visitation of
[38:10] the holy spirit for for him to be able
[38:13] to drop down and be made known Among Us
[38:18] so let's just Begin by by reading a
[38:20] couple scriptures
[38:23] you may stand and
[38:25] we want to turn to the Book of Genesis
[38:27] reading a couple verses there and then
[38:29] we'll go over to the Book of Luke
[38:30] Genesis chapter 18.
[38:33] reading just about five verses there
[38:39] the Book of Genesis Chapter 18 reading
[38:41] from verse 10.
[38:44] and it says and he said I will certainly
[38:47] return unto thee
[38:49] according to the time of life
[38:52] and low
[38:53] Sarah thy wife shall have a son
[38:57] and Sarah heard it in the tent door
[38:59] which was behind him
[39:01] now Abraham and Sarah were old and
[39:04] well-stricken in age and it ceased to be
[39:06] with Sarah after the manner of woman
[39:08] therefore Sarah laughed within herself
[39:10] saying after I am waxed All Shall I have
[39:14] pleasure my Lord being old also and the
[39:17] Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did
[39:19] Sarah laugh
[39:20] saying shall I have a surety Bear Child
[39:24] which I'm old
[39:25] is anything too hard for the Lord at the
[39:29] time appointed I will return unto thee
[39:32] according to the time of life
[39:34] and Sarah shall have a son
[39:38] and over to Luke reading from chapter 24
[39:40] a few verses there as well from verse
[39:43] 49.
[39:46] verse 49-53 and it says and behold I
[39:50] sent the promise of my father upon you
[39:53] but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until
[39:56] he be endued with power from on high and
[40:00] he led them out as far as to Bethany he
[40:03] lifted up his hands and blessed them and
[40:05] it came to pass while he blessed them he
[40:07] was parted from them and carried up into
[40:10] heaven and they worship Him and return
[40:12] to Jerusalem with great joy and they
[40:15] will continually in the temple praising
[40:18] and blessing God Amen
[40:20] may the Lord had a blessing to the
[40:22] reading of his word you may have your
[40:24] seats one more time
[40:26] you know
[40:31] this when it was placed upon my heart I
[40:34] had to do some research preparation for
[40:36] visitation
[40:38] and I went back to basics I went to make
[40:41] sure I understood what was being said
[40:44] what I had to say and preparation is is
[40:48] derived from a Latin wood and it means
[40:51] to make ready before
[40:53] so it calls for Action it calls for you
[40:56] to do something before the manifestation
[40:58] of that so if you have to prepare for me
[41:01] coming to your home it means you have to
[41:03] do something before I come to your home
[41:04] so it calls for you to do something so
[41:07] that's important to remember that it's
[41:09] done before it can be done at the time
[41:12] it can't be done after at that time it's
[41:14] too late it has to be done before and
[41:16] then I examine the word
[41:18] visitation and according to the
[41:20] definition it had various definitions
[41:23] but the ones I like the most ones that
[41:25] an official visit I like that it's not
[41:29] just a visit an official visit and then
[41:32] it also went on to say a special
[41:35] dispensation of divine favor or wrath
[41:39] and I like that even more because it
[41:42] also highlighted the fact that a visit
[41:44] or a visitation wasn't always a positive
[41:48] thing
[41:49] there is positive and negative it wasn't
[41:52] always a human thing it wasn't always I
[41:54] am coming to your home it might be an
[41:56] angel in your home
[41:58] you got me now I examine it a little
[42:01] more and I realized you know there is
[42:04] schedule and unscheduled visitations
[42:07] so if somebody says brother Gideon I'm
[42:10] coming to your home on Saturday at 3 P.M
[42:12] and I said yes that sounds awesome we
[42:15] have scheduled a visitation so they're
[42:17] coming to visit me at a a predetermined
[42:20] time on a predetermined day so it's easy
[42:23] to prepare for them which is to to make
[42:25] ready before right however in the case
[42:28] of an emergency if I'm calling somebody
[42:30] says listen outside the hopes because I
[42:34] need some help something desperately has
[42:36] happened that I that's unscheduled
[42:39] in my research and reading this
[42:42] scripture reading the course reading the
[42:43] message what I understand we have both
[42:45] schedule and unscheduled so it's
[42:48] important to make the distinction
[42:49] between the two because the distinction
[42:52] between the two actually impacts the way
[42:54] we prepare
[42:55] because when it's unscheduled there's a
[42:58] level of uncertainty
[43:00] there is space on an element or there is
[43:03] a window for doubt to exist
[43:06] and doubt as you know causes fear and
[43:09] paralyzes your faith and your ability to
[43:12] act and properly prepare
[43:14] so it's really incumbent on us to
[43:18] understand where we are at who we are at
[43:20] and how we are operating whether or not
[43:22] it's scheduled on scheduled whether
[43:25] we're preparing for natural or spiritual
[43:27] things and act accordingly right now the
[43:31] scriptures are very very clear as a
[43:33] matter of fact
[43:35] I I just want to read
[43:37] and forgive me for reading so many
[43:39] quotes but I feel like a treasure hunter
[43:41] as I as I went through some of the
[43:43] quotes I said you know what I can't stop
[43:45] here I need to go a little more and the
[43:48] more I went is the more I had to go
[43:49] because I was unearthing gems and jewels
[43:52] and all kind of stuff that we just
[43:54] needed to wash off a little bit right so
[43:57] forgive me a little bit
[43:59] now in a message brother Brandon
[44:01] preacher in 1953 called preparation
[44:04] from paragraph 18 He said so in don't
[44:07] depend on your knowledge
[44:09] and don't never try to figure anything
[44:11] out that God says if you could figure it
[44:14] out or if I could figure it out or if
[44:17] any other preacher could figure it out
[44:19] we would be equal with God we are not
[44:22] supposed and never will be able to
[44:24] figure it out because when we can figure
[44:26] it out it's not fit anymore
[44:29] it's not about him and believing in him
[44:31] and trusting him and trusting his word
[44:33] and what he's promised for us because
[44:35] with our natural five senses and logic
[44:38] we could figure it out so the prophet is
[44:40] saying hey don't worry about it have
[44:43] faith and trust God's word that he's the
[44:45] same yesterday today and forever and he
[44:47] is faithful to accomplish that which he
[44:49] started it goes on to say we've got to
[44:52] accept it by faith is that right God
[44:54] said so I don't know how I can't tell
[44:57] you how he's going to do it but he's
[44:59] gonna do it because he said so that's
[45:02] the basis God is going to do it because
[45:04] he promised to do it he is God and he
[45:07] can't break his promise how it is and
[45:10] some of God's preparations has been so
[45:13] ridiculous to people who depend on the
[45:16] tree of knowledge
[45:17] God's preparation has been absolutely
[45:20] ridiculous to the Natural mind because
[45:22] the natural mind can conceive the things
[45:25] that are of God
[45:30] you know it it goes on you say in in
[45:33] paragraph that
[45:34] 33 God in his preparation back when God
[45:38] was going to destroy the world before he
[45:41] destroyed the world he sent a
[45:43] preparation for saving of the people
[45:45] that desire to be saved what does that
[45:49] tell us that tells us there are those
[45:51] who they need a here nor there they
[45:53] don't care but we're not too worried
[45:54] about that because we want to be the
[45:56] people concerned and have a desire to
[45:59] really line up with God's promise and
[46:02] God's requirement for this hour so those
[46:04] people that have a desire to be saved he
[46:07] has a preparation for us
[46:09] he said he sent forth a preparation for
[46:12] the people that desire to be saved he
[46:14] always does it
[46:15] so he's the same yesterday today and
[46:17] forever so tonight
[46:19] sent me just as a reminder
[46:22] I'm reading still always does it
[46:27] he shows Mercy before judgment and if
[46:30] men spoon Mercy there's only one thing
[46:32] left that's judgment and God don't judge
[46:35] you you judge yourself
[46:37] that's true as long as you're under this
[46:39] prey of blood that's around the world
[46:41] you have a right of Mercy God's Miss
[46:45] the blood of Christ keeps God from
[46:47] killing you or he'll kill you just as
[46:49] soon as you sinned but that's still
[46:51] holding
[46:52] God from you from your death
[46:55] but when you're a free moral agent now
[46:57] but when you die and the spirit goes
[46:59] beyond that then you're already judged
[47:03] you don't have to wait for judgment you
[47:05] judge already
[47:06] God done said the day you eat thereof
[47:08] that day you die
[47:10] and that settles it so friends I'm not
[47:13] saying anything new I'm not saying
[47:15] anything strange I'm not saying anything
[47:17] you don't know wasn't it strange it
[47:19] never had rain I'd be moving to Noah's
[47:21] time
[47:22] Noah was called and challenged to
[47:25] prepare for something that had an
[47:27] uncertain date it was what what I will
[47:29] refer to as an unscheduled visit in this
[47:32] case it was in the form of rain so he
[47:35] got a message saying prepare for
[47:37] something but I'm not telling you when
[47:39] it's going to happen
[47:40] that calls for a great deal of faith and
[47:43] as we know we know the story and I'll
[47:44] I'll read as we go along can you imagine
[47:47] the people this is chapter 30 the
[47:50] paragraph 34. could you imagine the
[47:53] people down in the city talking about it
[47:55] why they'd say hey
[47:58] what do you think about that rain story
[47:59] can you imagine no ideas with social
[48:01] media
[48:03] the Vlogs the Vlogs the depressed the
[48:05] kind of stories you'll have
[48:08] trending yeah you you heard about this
[48:11] rain thing you heard this old man
[48:13] preaching this rain thing it's yes now
[48:16] he's saying that you can imagine what a
[48:18] mockery would have been like year after
[48:20] year going into 2023 and you still
[48:23] believe that you still preaching that
[48:26] you still sit in this Dawn and people
[48:29] why you don't take a break why don't
[48:32] take a rest but he had to prepare for an
[48:35] unscheduled visit nobody else knew about
[48:38] it but he did he had faith and he had
[48:42] the confidence and belief in God's
[48:44] promise at that time they say hey what
[48:47] do you think about the rain story that
[48:48] old guy is telling up there
[48:50] but he had the will of God
[48:53] he knowed where he was no matter what
[48:55] the world how ridiculous it seemed to
[48:57] the world
[48:58] God had a man he could put his hand on
[49:01] it are you that kind of person tonight
[49:02] that God could put his hand on you and
[49:05] say listen this is what I'd like you to
[49:07] do and I'd like you to stick to it I
[49:10] don't want you to be swayed and shifted
[49:11] by every little talk and every little
[49:13] little thing and everything that's
[49:15] trending now
[49:16] that's the scenario Noah was in
[49:22] how ridiculous it seemed to The World
[49:24] God had a man he could put his hand on
[49:26] and he built the ark the people laughed
[49:29] at him
[49:31] that didn't stop him though
[49:33] he just built right ahead he kept
[49:36] pressing on any man that really knows
[49:39] the Divine will of God is born again
[49:41] they could call you a Holy Roller
[49:43] fanatic whatever they want to You'll
[49:45] build right ahead on the earth it
[49:49] doesn't make a bitter difference that's
[49:50] right you get ready
[49:52] you get ready for it no I can see the
[49:56] time
[49:57] said there's gonna come a storm this is
[50:00] what no one know
[50:02] the rains are oh how he's gonna do it
[50:04] you may have had a question because keep
[50:06] in mind just just to build a context it
[50:09] didn't rain before
[50:10] so this was fresh this was new this this
[50:13] was a novelty this was something that
[50:15] sounds so strange that sounds so strange
[50:16] however
[50:18] from the courts before we understand if
[50:20] we could just understand it we don't
[50:22] need faith we don't need to really
[50:24] believe and grab a hole at the
[50:26] impossible and and see it become real
[50:29] and manifested in our lives so the kind
[50:31] of Faith No One needed was a special
[50:33] type this was a a fit that didn't have a
[50:37] history it was untested this was the
[50:40] first time a man would have been called
[50:41] upon to wait this long with a message
[50:44] believe in something and trusting in the
[50:46] word of God for something that never
[50:48] happened before
[50:49] [Music]
[50:51] he says that's right you get ready for
[50:53] it no I could see the time Noah was
[50:55] going to come a storm He reigns that how
[50:58] he's gonna do it why it never did do it
[51:01] and there were much better scientists
[51:03] than we are today go down in Egypt and
[51:06] look at the pyramids setting in the
[51:08] middle of the Earth no matter where the
[51:10] sun is there's never a shadow around it
[51:13] no matter where the sun is how they do
[51:15] it all these Bowlers at least two city
[51:18] blocks high that weigh a billion tons or
[51:20] they get them up there produce something
[51:23] now that could lift them up you can't do
[51:25] it they can't make mummies today as they
[51:28] did in them days with the body they
[51:31] can't embalm like they did none of those
[51:33] things they were smarter really than
[51:36] they are today and you know they laughed
[51:38] at that man
[51:40] that stood up there building the ark and
[51:42] saying it was going to rain
[51:44] but it rained anyhow
[51:46] it didn't change the fact that God
[51:49] always keep his promises he will always
[51:51] keep his word his word to you is still
[51:54] true and will still come to pass but you
[51:57] have to grab a whole of faith and know
[51:59] he's faithful
[52:02] amen amen I can't just imagine just look
[52:06] at this just a moment God Was preparing
[52:09] Noah's preaching and the first thing you
[52:11] know why one day one day
[52:14] they come a thunder and I want you to
[52:16] picture it now can you imagine it's
[52:18] quiet it's
[52:19] kind of like no
[52:22] right no be experiencing some beautiful
[52:24] sunlight and can you imagine you're here
[52:26] Thunder
[52:28] all of a sudden
[52:29] you get a startling reminder there was a
[52:33] man sometime that used to say rain
[52:35] coming
[52:36] you didn't see the rain yet
[52:38] but you're aware that this is not the
[52:40] norm something has interrupted your
[52:43] normal living
[52:45] no I hear someone say oh a blast went
[52:49] off somewhere but a cloud began to rise
[52:51] now I could see the great big poly
[52:54] parrot setting out there looking over
[52:57] the mother Polly pirate and saying
[52:58] mother that's what Noah said I can see
[53:00] little monkey drop the corner and say
[53:03] Come on Mommy we head in for the ark and
[53:05] I run through a little bit but brother
[53:07] Branham said sometimes these wild
[53:09] animals have more sense more faith more
[53:13] belief in the word of God than humans so
[53:16] I am just here to standing up to ensure
[53:20] that we the humans could still be
[53:23] reminded could still believe could still
[53:25] be encouraged and inspired and have the
[53:27] fear so this testimony wouldn't be true
[53:30] we don't want the eye and the animals to
[53:32] beat us we want to be able to hear God's
[53:35] voice hear his word hear his promise and
[53:38] believe it
[53:39] believe it a hundred percent and knowing
[53:42] that we don't have to understand it but
[53:43] the faith that we have in God will pull
[53:46] us through because he said listen when
[53:49] the son of man come would he find
[53:51] churches would you find groups would you
[53:53] find people would you find Bible
[53:55] believing Christians those Concepts
[53:58] sound good those construction
[53:59] interesting but he said shall he find
[54:03] faith and that's the thing that
[54:05] sometimes we lacking that's the thing
[54:07] sometimes that disconnects us from the
[54:09] promises of God and our ability to
[54:11] really come to our fullest potential the
[54:14] faith that God expect us to have in his
[54:16] unfailing word
[54:18] foreign
[54:20] [Applause]
[54:24] I always say in the natural it's easy
[54:28] for us to prepare for a friend
[54:30] if I were to say sister Donna key come
[54:32] come to my house she should expect that
[54:36] it may not be me but but I will cook
[54:38] some food I will prepare some something
[54:40] you know I wouldn't invite you to my
[54:42] house and then I am not home
[54:45] that's not how you prepare I know I'm
[54:48] expecting you a particular time so I may
[54:50] tell I may tell tell my wife I said
[54:52] listen come so we have to put this in
[54:54] place we have to make sure she can park
[54:56] we want to make sure things in order
[54:57] that we have the chairs that the place
[54:58] is clean that we're gonna entertain huh
[55:01] right and when we think about it this is
[55:04] how we operate in the natural but I want
[55:07] to tell you a little secret
[55:09] in our own lives we also have this thing
[55:12] called priority priority or importance
[55:16] for example
[55:18] my brother would come to my home
[55:22] he pops up anytime
[55:24] president call outside
[55:27] hey what's up
[55:29] it's okay
[55:30] I'm not saying the place would be dirty
[55:32] but if he come and you see some toys on
[55:35] the floor
[55:36] it's not a problem
[55:37] no issue at all because it's my brother
[55:40] however just imagine for a second in
[55:43] Trinidad we have a prime minister right
[55:44] if the prime minister is to visit my
[55:46] home what do you think will happen you
[55:48] think he will pop up on the air outside
[55:50] that wouldn't happen but even if he does
[55:52] you think I'll just say well come on in
[55:55] no I will say hold on a minute
[55:57] I will clean I will prepare I will put
[56:00] things in place because I place a
[56:01] certain level of importance on his
[56:03] office or who he is correct so just
[56:06] think for a second in the spiritual now
[56:09] I'm not talking about a man I'm not
[56:11] talking about a prime minister a
[56:12] president or a head of state or or
[56:14] somebody that that we voted in or have a
[56:17] title I'm talking about almighty God I'm
[56:20] referring to the Holy Spirit here I'm
[56:22] talking about the angel of God being
[56:23] able to drop down how much more we ought
[56:26] to prepare our lives our heart our homes
[56:28] to to be in anticipation for his coming
[56:32] to know that he has promised to come
[56:36] and he didn't give us the time
[56:39] they didn't give us the day they didn't
[56:41] give us the hour so how we ought to live
[56:44] how we ought to operate how we ought to
[56:47] speak how we ought to relate to each
[56:49] other knowing that he has committed that
[56:52] I'm going to visit you
[56:54] in Abraham's case they said
[56:57] I will return according to the time of
[56:59] life
[57:00] in no one's case he say it will rain
[57:03] different form
[57:04] one a time frame
[57:07] and even then with Abraham as you know
[57:10] the story in year one can you imagine
[57:13] I doubt Abraham just sat down and you
[57:15] know this story he wouldn't sit down and
[57:17] be like I wanna know when this child
[57:19] come in but I wonder if it's this year I
[57:21] wonder if it's next year I wonder
[57:25] they say Abraham we call him the father
[57:27] of faith
[57:29] he stood on the promise of God no matter
[57:32] what anybody else said he had Faith year
[57:35] in year out day in day out month in
[57:39] month out he had a testimony that God
[57:41] said so God said so so Sarah I know
[57:45] you're looking older and I will read the
[57:48] scripture here no the quote right rather
[57:52] once I find it you know God said
[57:57] he could have chosen Abraham when he was
[57:59] 26 you know you know that
[58:03] Sarah would have been 16 and I want to
[58:05] make a nice story we could write a book
[58:07] about that storybook with pictures and
[58:09] colors you know
[58:11] but that's not the way he wanted it
[58:14] that's not the way he wanted it
[58:17] that is not the way he wanted it
[58:20] I will find it back in a little while
[58:22] right so in in the message God has a
[58:27] provided we
[58:28] 1956 chapter 87 he said
[58:33] I let Abraham and instead of calling him
[58:35] no
[58:37] at 26 and Sarah at 16 I'll wait till
[58:40] they are old that's got amazing so he
[58:44] have plans and he could watch you and
[58:46] say listen you know what this story too
[58:48] simple it reminds me of Gideon in the
[58:50] Bible
[58:53] cause men he had armies for days he
[58:56] could conquer anything after his
[58:58] confidence and his fate was built up he
[59:00] realized he had a lot of support but God
[59:02] said you know what that looked too easy
[59:04] if you do that I don't get the glory I
[59:06] look at the honor I don't get any
[59:08] worship I expect I don't get the results
[59:11] I want confuse I want to twist up I
[59:15] don't want you to think that is because
[59:16] of your strength and your might I want
[59:19] you have a testimony not by my might not
[59:23] by my power but by your spirit because
[59:26] you are God you did it right so he was
[59:30] able to break the Army down because
[59:31] that's the way he wanted it so God said
[59:34] listen I will wait till Abraham is old
[59:37] because I want a really confuse the mind
[59:40] of the wise
[59:41] I want to confuse the why the mind of
[59:44] the natural those who think they could
[59:45] figure it out so I'm nothing to figure
[59:48] in it out I'm into trying to understand
[59:51] the mind of Christ for my life because
[59:54] if I could live a life that's pleased
[59:56] into God then I could walk like Enoch
[59:59] they say Enoch
[1:00:01] was just walking you know
[1:00:03] we reflect a normal living and
[1:00:05] oftentimes we refer to it almost in a
[1:00:07] negative way with normal living
[1:00:10] but you know your normal living could be
[1:00:12] positive
[1:00:14] Enoch wasn't doing anything fancy you
[1:00:16] know
[1:00:16] Enoch was living his normal life but in
[1:00:19] his normal walk with God in his normal
[1:00:21] relationship with God he pleased God he
[1:00:24] walked with God he had such a
[1:00:26] relationship with God that his normal
[1:00:28] living allowed him to disappear and he
[1:00:31] was found not and they couldn't find him
[1:00:32] wherever they looked they couldn't find
[1:00:34] him in his normal living oh we ought to
[1:00:37] be so normal be kind of normal you know
[1:00:39] during the pandemic they had a new
[1:00:41] phrase they call it the new normal
[1:00:44] I hope and pray that our new normal will
[1:00:47] be a normalcy of faith a normalcy of of
[1:00:50] Revelation and inspiration and that we
[1:00:53] will continue to
[1:00:55] raise and worship on Thanksgiving and we
[1:00:58] could create such an atmosphere not just
[1:01:01] in church
[1:01:02] I just want to pause there for a minute
[1:01:04] you know it's it's easy to act in church
[1:01:06] you know that
[1:01:07] I tell people all the time when I when I
[1:01:09] meet them on the street I often say I'm
[1:01:11] born in church
[1:01:12] I tell am I born in children
[1:01:14] I said they only write Port especially
[1:01:16] on another hospital on my birth
[1:01:17] certificate but I really born in church
[1:01:21] so I live in church
[1:01:24] play music
[1:01:25] I'm not I'm not preacher but a born in
[1:01:27] church so there are some people who they
[1:01:30] become accustomed to church church
[1:01:32] becomes the norm so they know when it's
[1:01:35] Church time you dress up and say God
[1:01:36] bless and you lift your hands and you
[1:01:39] worship because it's the norm it's the
[1:01:41] thing to do but you know what
[1:01:43] God don't really take that one too much
[1:01:45] you know
[1:01:46] you know that he speaks a lot about the
[1:01:49] people in his Temple
[1:01:51] he speaks about the way they operate and
[1:01:53] his pleasure or displeasure with their
[1:01:55] activity
[1:01:57] seems to place a lot of emphasis and
[1:01:59] value in your life outside of the church
[1:02:03] outside the walls of the church you see
[1:02:05] when you go to school
[1:02:06] and the children give you a hard time
[1:02:09] and you're driving along the road and
[1:02:11] they give you a bad drive like I tell my
[1:02:13] wife earlier this week I was going to to
[1:02:16] a store and and I pulled
[1:02:19] um into an empty spot it is so weird it
[1:02:22] was an empty spot I saw it as an empty
[1:02:24] spot and I pulled him and a guy outside
[1:02:26] as I came out he presses one
[1:02:29] so I turned because there was an empty
[1:02:31] spot next to me while you squirreling
[1:02:33] with me somebody else filled the next
[1:02:35] empty spot so I'm just looking at him
[1:02:37] and he said I was going there I was
[1:02:39] going there where I was already parked
[1:02:41] and outside the vehicle so he had a
[1:02:43] passenger in the vehicle and as the
[1:02:45] passenger came out the passenger looked
[1:02:47] at me and he said
[1:02:49] boy you you blind and do a Tish boy
[1:02:53] right
[1:02:57] you know what I did
[1:02:59] I reacted are reacted took all that I
[1:03:03] had in me and reacted I gave him it good
[1:03:06] I told him like it is you know what I
[1:03:08] did
[1:03:09] I just continued walking
[1:03:11] I just walked into the store
[1:03:13] did my business and as I walked back out
[1:03:16] they were gone I tell my wife I said
[1:03:18] listen that is maturity you know
[1:03:21] I say you know I heard the words and it
[1:03:23] didn't impact me
[1:03:25] because his words didn't Define me
[1:03:26] because I know who I am
[1:03:28] and I am not blind neither am I do this
[1:03:31] so I did not allow his words to throw
[1:03:34] through me off as a matter of fact that
[1:03:35] day was a great day I went to one to my
[1:03:38] wife I said listen today was very very
[1:03:39] productive you know listen to what
[1:03:41] happened a man called me blind and Duty
[1:03:44] but praise the Lord anyhow because I
[1:03:47] know who I am and I trust and he
[1:03:49] promised on the word of God
[1:03:51] I could stand strong by faith knowing
[1:03:53] that I could water
[1:03:56] atmosphere wrong
[1:03:58] I work to preserve that people talk a
[1:04:01] lot about mental health no right and do
[1:04:05] you realize
[1:04:06] you are greatly responsible for the
[1:04:09] atmosphere around you
[1:04:12] how you react how you behave outside of
[1:04:15] the walls of church really determines
[1:04:18] the life that you live because
[1:04:21] you allow people to throw you off all of
[1:04:24] a sudden you're not operating in faith
[1:04:25] anymore you know you're operating on a
[1:04:28] natural and unbelief just reacting
[1:04:30] flying off the handle getting upset and
[1:04:33] not realizing that this is so for such a
[1:04:37] time as this strange enough I was
[1:04:39] driving to church tonight and there was
[1:04:40] a lot of traffic on Valencia stretch and
[1:04:42] you know what I just drove
[1:04:44] I don't know if it's an accident up
[1:04:46] ahead I don't know what's going on but
[1:04:47] that's just true I was just so
[1:04:49] comfortable and this is not a testimony
[1:04:50] about me but it just goes to show
[1:04:52] because I knew nothing could stop this
[1:04:55] message from coming fortunate you are
[1:04:58] predestinated to be here you know
[1:05:00] nothing was going to cut me off tonight
[1:05:02] you know there was no accident no no
[1:05:04] disappointment no matter what it was I
[1:05:07] knew before that God had given me these
[1:05:12] scriptures this message to deliver to
[1:05:14] you with or without you the message was
[1:05:17] going home all I had to do was stay
[1:05:20] committed to his promises and reach and
[1:05:22] deliver it and by God's grace I Endeavor
[1:05:24] to do that I go on
[1:05:26] [Applause]
[1:05:28] you know and I continue in in that that
[1:05:32] that that message God had a provided way
[1:05:39] you know in in paragraph 93 he said
[1:05:42] Abraham Abraham would No Doubt
[1:05:47] but no doubt said Thank You Lord I'm so
[1:05:49] happy to get this this promise that
[1:05:51] you've given me because here I am I'm
[1:05:53] old I've always wanted children
[1:05:56] his own name his father of Nations and
[1:05:59] he didn't have a child so he's always
[1:06:01] wanted children so
[1:06:03] um I'm old and I'd like to have that
[1:06:05] promise well Abraham went along as if to
[1:06:08] believe that the baby was going to be
[1:06:10] born in that same year that's the
[1:06:12] attitude he had that that baby was going
[1:06:14] to be born in the same year but you know
[1:06:17] day by day there was no change and then
[1:06:20] it went day by day then week by week
[1:06:23] year by year and no change but the Bible
[1:06:26] said no
[1:06:28] if that would be you and I well maybe
[1:06:31] I don't say
[1:06:32] but some people they would say oh my God
[1:06:35] God let me down he tell me I will be a
[1:06:38] father be a one pass he had three pass
[1:06:41] what going on like God make a mistake
[1:06:43] like he forget but no
[1:06:45] keep in mind
[1:06:47] we have to prepare
[1:06:49] for visitation we have to prepare for
[1:06:53] him to manifest his promise in our lives
[1:06:57] did keep his his promise and Abraham the
[1:07:01] Bible said grew strong in God
[1:07:04] all the time it got greater now he is 75
[1:07:08] no 10 years passed he's 85 10 years just
[1:07:12] think
[1:07:13] that's when I started preaching these
[1:07:15] meetings and 10 years past and still
[1:07:17] nothing happened
[1:07:19] the first person I ever prayed for but
[1:07:21] would still be given God praise because
[1:07:22] it was going to happen why God prepared
[1:07:26] it
[1:07:28] God will never give you a promise unless
[1:07:30] first there is a deposit for it
[1:07:33] a good man wouldn't give you a check
[1:07:36] with no money in the bank
[1:07:38] an honest man wouldn't
[1:07:40] well God wouldn't give you a check for
[1:07:43] your salvation
[1:07:45] or healing lest there was a deposit for
[1:07:48] it God has prepared for it he told
[1:07:52] Abraham she was going to have a child
[1:07:54] and that settled it
[1:07:57] amen
[1:08:00] you know oftentimes when exploring I I I
[1:08:04] I admire the woman with the Lost coin
[1:08:09] it's a very very interesting story the
[1:08:12] woman with the Lost coin
[1:08:16] and just as a background in the second
[1:08:18] coming of the Lord
[1:08:20] he said today if a woman was married she
[1:08:23] should wear a wedding ring as a sign
[1:08:25] that she's married
[1:08:27] that's the keep other men from having
[1:08:28] anything to do with her the look and the
[1:08:31] Sea she's a married woman in those days
[1:08:33] they didn't have wedding rings
[1:08:35] they had a tablet they call it tablet
[1:08:38] yeah they put it on their head it had 10
[1:08:40] coins it went around the head and this
[1:08:43] is familiar to you I'm just repeating it
[1:08:45] yeah
[1:08:46] you know so so it will cause the men to
[1:08:49] back away because they can see
[1:08:51] she has a tablet on her head with 10
[1:08:53] coins
[1:08:56] each one of those coins if we only have
[1:08:59] time but I haven't I'm gonna try to keep
[1:09:01] my word and you know keep it short
[1:09:04] and I could tell you each one of those
[1:09:05] coins had a meaning
[1:09:07] it was placed in there and each coin
[1:09:09] meant
[1:09:09] virtue
[1:09:11] of that woman
[1:09:13] the first meaning her loved her husband
[1:09:15] stuck on a pledge of virtue to live
[1:09:16] clean for him on the third and fourth
[1:09:18] and fifth and so on onto the ninth and
[1:09:20] 10th if you want to look it up look in
[1:09:22] Galatians 5.
[1:09:23] you'll find out that woman represented
[1:09:25] the church and the church is an espouse
[1:09:28] wife to Christ and the tablet that the
[1:09:31] church is supposed to wear is found in
[1:09:33] Galatians 5 which is love joy peace long
[1:09:35] suffering goodness meekness gentleness
[1:09:37] patience
[1:09:38] this is the tablet that's supposed to be
[1:09:40] worn in the church brought in love
[1:09:42] kindness Fellowship Etc and this woman
[1:09:46] when it
[1:09:48] has been about dark that she realized
[1:09:50] that she had lost one of those coins
[1:09:54] or if there ever was a time that the
[1:09:57] church ought to take inventory
[1:09:59] find out if you've got all the coins on
[1:10:02] it should be now it should be tonight it
[1:10:03] should be right now on the 7th of
[1:10:05] December
[1:10:06] yeah
[1:10:08] the very horns and the clouds of
[1:10:11] destroying civilization is hanging over
[1:10:13] the Earth
[1:10:15] sin and the botch on every hand we're
[1:10:19] living in a tremendous time where
[1:10:20] there's wickedness people who go to
[1:10:22] church just for Hashem people who go to
[1:10:24] church to try to hide from the meanness
[1:10:26] people who go to church and profess
[1:10:28] Christianity and live like the rest of
[1:10:30] the world drinking smoking gambling
[1:10:32] woman immorally dressed wearing clothes
[1:10:34] they ought not to wear
[1:10:36] in their own dressing room out on the
[1:10:39] streets before public
[1:10:41] and broadly love is a thing that's
[1:10:43] passing almost we have not lost one coin
[1:10:45] but we've lost practically every one of
[1:10:47] them
[1:10:48] this is profit speaking
[1:10:51] and was getting night
[1:10:53] and remember her husband would return
[1:10:55] now although it's a return of her
[1:10:58] husband
[1:10:59] I categorize it as a visit in this case
[1:11:03] she knew beforehand that her husband was
[1:11:06] going to come at a particular time at a
[1:11:07] particular day
[1:11:09] so he is coming from wherever he was
[1:11:12] doing his business back home so he's
[1:11:14] about to visit the house
[1:11:17] he had defied
[1:11:19] oh sorry and it was getting night and
[1:11:21] remember her husband would return and if
[1:11:23] he found out with one of those coins out
[1:11:25] it showed she had been marked a harlot
[1:11:28] and if she had defied or defiled herself
[1:11:30] in any way it would be seen by the
[1:11:31] people that brought her before the
[1:11:33] priest and brought witness and she had
[1:11:35] been found as such a priest recognizing
[1:11:37] she was a married woman take the coin
[1:11:39] out
[1:11:40] and she had been doing wrong and if she
[1:11:44] had marred her virtue they took that out
[1:11:45] and you know she had been flitting or
[1:11:47] showing she wasn't true to her husband
[1:11:49] that took that one out whatever
[1:11:51] represented the infringement
[1:11:53] you know and when her husband returned
[1:11:56] and had found that she had been marked
[1:11:59] he would divorce her immediately and
[1:12:00] have nothing to do with such a woman he
[1:12:03] had not one such a woman
[1:12:04] so it was getting toward dark when she
[1:12:07] realized that she had lost something
[1:12:10] time for her husband to come and it's
[1:12:12] getting late
[1:12:13] the church better be examining
[1:12:15] themselves by the word of God
[1:12:18] our Purity our loyalty our devotion we
[1:12:21] become tatas tale bearers cigarette
[1:12:23] smokers backbiters painted up Jezebels
[1:12:26] everything in the calendar that the rest
[1:12:28] of the world does the Christian church
[1:12:30] in associating in those things today
[1:12:32] till you can't hardly tell one from the
[1:12:35] other how much times we've preached
[1:12:37] about that we've talked about that we've
[1:12:39] spoken about that you can hardly tell
[1:12:41] the difference between the true elect of
[1:12:43] God the true Bible believe in Christian
[1:12:46] the true Christian that understands the
[1:12:49] message and has Faith to believe in the
[1:12:51] promises a god
[1:12:53] everybody else
[1:12:56] now I just run down a little bit and it
[1:12:59] says
[1:13:02] it was so late till she had to light a
[1:13:04] candle and she got a candle not only she
[1:13:06] got a candle but she got a broom and she
[1:13:08] went to house cleaning and this is what
[1:13:10] I referenced before when you're
[1:13:11] preparing for somebody important
[1:13:14] you do care what it takes
[1:13:16] to prepare
[1:13:18] I know some personally natural they love
[1:13:21] Christmas so Christmas Eve or late into
[1:13:24] the wee hours of Christmas morning the
[1:13:26] bacon ham the cleaning the sowing
[1:13:28] they're doing whatever they're doing
[1:13:30] because it's important to them in this
[1:13:33] case it was important to her that she
[1:13:35] found a coin that was lost
[1:13:43] oh brother if there was ever a time to
[1:13:45] light a candle and send forth the gospel
[1:13:47] like the Holy Ghost back into the church
[1:13:49] not so much for emotion not for some
[1:13:52] Fanatics not for some emotional wake up
[1:13:54] not for a jump for joy but a heart
[1:13:56] searching experience men and women get
[1:13:59] right with God right we're at the end
[1:14:02] time and she lit a candle to give her
[1:14:05] light and brother every little candle in
[1:14:07] here ought to be lit tonight not only
[1:14:09] that but she got the broom and the
[1:14:11] neighbors could see the dust flying she
[1:14:13] had a real house cleaning time for her
[1:14:16] husband was about to come and if he
[1:14:18] caught her with one of the points out
[1:14:19] she was a harlot brother we the Church
[1:14:22] of the Living God in these great hours
[1:14:24] that we are now living it behooves us to
[1:14:26] check up go before God light the candle
[1:14:29] of the word of the gospel and examine
[1:14:31] ourselves and find out if we're not
[1:14:33] falling short and especially when we see
[1:14:36] all these things coming we're at the end
[1:14:39] time the coming of Christ is at hand
[1:14:40] there's not another hope for the world
[1:14:42] for the a church and look the church is
[1:14:45] lullian
[1:14:46] the church has no conscience no more you
[1:14:49] can hardly wake them up the Bible said a
[1:14:52] time will come
[1:14:53] that they'll be in this condition
[1:14:55] law our Lord delays is coming
[1:14:58] and they'll be devouring and biting one
[1:15:01] another and so forth and fighting around
[1:15:02] that's exactly the hour
[1:15:05] everything's ready the pages is turned
[1:15:07] and it was like that and it's ready to
[1:15:09] coming out of the Lord
[1:15:13] and I just want to touch on two more
[1:15:15] things
[1:15:16] when we talk about preparing for visits
[1:15:19] and I read the scripture early on I
[1:15:21] can't help but think about Jesus himself
[1:15:23] given the promise unto his disciples
[1:15:27] when he said tarry in the city of
[1:15:30] Jerusalem until you be intuited with
[1:15:33] power
[1:15:34] right so he gave them a direct promise
[1:15:38] so there should be no doubt as to where
[1:15:41] the message come from
[1:15:46] old man
[1:15:49] who is that why I must have confidence
[1:15:52] that he say
[1:15:53] that God say come into this act
[1:15:56] but in this case you have no excuse
[1:15:58] right because this is Jesus himself
[1:16:00] saying listen you you you you I want you
[1:16:03] all to go a particular place and wait a
[1:16:06] particular time until a particular
[1:16:08] experience takes place
[1:16:10] you know and in the message a time of
[1:16:13] this decision
[1:16:14] he said if God required Mary the Blessed
[1:16:18] Virgin
[1:16:19] it's an X2 before Mary could enter into
[1:16:22] the kingdom she had to go up in the
[1:16:23] upper room she had to wait there like
[1:16:25] the rest of them did so there was
[1:16:27] something for her to do she couldn't
[1:16:29] just sit back and say are waiting you
[1:16:32] know what you know you know who I am you
[1:16:34] know I'm entitled to this because I was
[1:16:37] a wrong long time I was there from his
[1:16:39] very beginning no she she had to do
[1:16:42] whatever it took to ensure that when was
[1:16:46] time for visitation she was in position
[1:16:48] to get the blessing that he promised
[1:16:51] so she had to wait there like the rest
[1:16:54] of them did not until some Minister came
[1:16:56] and put her name on the book or not when
[1:16:58] there was some kind of communion given
[1:17:00] or someone shook a hand or wrote her a
[1:17:02] letter for her church as we do today but
[1:17:05] there came a song They Came From Heaven
[1:17:07] a sound like a Russian Mighty Wind and
[1:17:10] it filled all the house where they were
[1:17:12] certain and they went from these rooms
[1:17:15] speaking in other languages so filled
[1:17:18] with the Holy Ghost until they were
[1:17:19] staggering like they were drunk people
[1:17:21] the Bible said so and if Mary had to go
[1:17:25] get that kind of religion to be in glory
[1:17:27] you'll never get there with anything
[1:17:30] short of it make up your mind what are
[1:17:33] you going to do about it it's time of
[1:17:35] your decision
[1:17:41] and I just want to skip down here a
[1:17:43] little bit because I don't want to keep
[1:17:45] you too long
[1:17:48] and this this is the last one I want to
[1:17:50] touch
[1:17:51] amen
[1:17:53] all right
[1:17:57] so in God's provided way
[1:17:59] and I want to shift a little bit to
[1:18:01] Moses because this one unlike all the
[1:18:05] others this was a quite different
[1:18:07] experience the visitation in the last
[1:18:10] experience
[1:18:12] was the Holy Spirit dropping down among
[1:18:15] the people that were gathered together
[1:18:16] in the upper room
[1:18:18] and all the experiences that give thus
[1:18:20] far with the exception of the woman who
[1:18:22] lost the coin there was an A positive
[1:18:25] experience the woman who lost the coin
[1:18:27] ran the risk
[1:18:29] of a negative implication to her lack of
[1:18:32] the coin
[1:18:33] in in Moses days it was a little
[1:18:35] different
[1:18:37] so where I want to highlight is the fact
[1:18:40] that
[1:18:41] Moses came out to deliver the people
[1:18:45] we know that that's given but at time
[1:18:48] came kind of like no
[1:18:50] where they had experience
[1:18:53] a lot of trials and tribulations over a
[1:18:56] short period of time
[1:18:58] they had seen plagues farming pestilence
[1:19:01] all kind of stuff going on and they had
[1:19:03] reached the end the breaking point where
[1:19:06] you're about to see the difference
[1:19:09] but at the same time
[1:19:12] this that I'm referring to is not just
[1:19:14] preparation to leave Egypt you know it
[1:19:16] sounds great and nice and the champagne
[1:19:17] trying to jump and shout and we say yes
[1:19:19] we live in Pharaoh we live in Egypt we
[1:19:21] live in everything behind and that
[1:19:22] sounds great but there came a
[1:19:25] requirement
[1:19:26] for them to prepare in anticipation for
[1:19:29] the visitation of the Dead Angel and
[1:19:31] that's what I want to touch just for a
[1:19:32] few minutes
[1:19:34] you know
[1:19:36] in God's provided we paragraph what one
[1:19:39] would do he said all right I want you to
[1:19:41] notice
[1:19:43] and just at that point he said I want
[1:19:45] you to take the lamb and kill it in the
[1:19:47] evening perfect type of Christ kill in
[1:19:50] the evening and then the whole assembly
[1:19:52] of Israel was to witness the death
[1:19:54] they did at Christ
[1:19:56] and the blood was put to be put on the
[1:19:58] door for that night the death angel was
[1:20:01] going to ride the land and everywhere
[1:20:03] there wasn't blood was going to be death
[1:20:05] so there was a direct negative
[1:20:07] consequence for their lack of action
[1:20:10] so if you didn't prepare
[1:20:12] there was death
[1:20:16] and I tell your brother if there was a
[1:20:18] time that the death angel is riding the
[1:20:20] land it's tonight
[1:20:21] these are not my words
[1:20:24] he comes to the church door where the
[1:20:27] priest stands
[1:20:29] and a church that's denying the blood
[1:20:31] and the power of Jesus that's going on
[1:20:33] there the glory of God has Departed the
[1:20:36] dead Angel goes in and that settles it
[1:20:38] they become formal and dead
[1:20:41] and denying God's power
[1:20:43] so sometimes you'll wonder why why that
[1:20:45] you're so quiet boy
[1:20:47] this is your answer
[1:20:48] why everybody just calm like they come
[1:20:50] to watch a movie boy that this is a tea
[1:20:53] boy
[1:20:54] but you could see he said this is really
[1:20:57] the death angel passing because they
[1:21:00] fail to apply the blood in the church
[1:21:06] they become formal and dead and denying
[1:21:09] God's power the first thing you know
[1:21:11] that is all over the whole group of them
[1:21:13] you'll never get them to believe
[1:21:15] anything they can't believe it no watch
[1:21:17] this that angel I can see the father now
[1:21:20] they were supposed when the sun went
[1:21:22] down and the Darkness sat in
[1:21:25] the ones came under the blood of the
[1:21:27] lamb and they had to stay under there
[1:21:29] until marching orders were given
[1:21:32] brother
[1:21:34] this is good for your not
[1:21:36] nazarenes no
[1:21:38] power off 105. look coming under the
[1:21:41] blood once under the blood
[1:21:43] put it on the lintel of the door and on
[1:21:45] the post but every time a man come
[1:21:47] through that door into this home he
[1:21:50] stayed there until marching orders come
[1:21:53] to go out of Egypt
[1:21:56] I like that still right there stay there
[1:22:00] how I consider young ladies going to the
[1:22:02] parties that night to the young
[1:22:04] Israelite girls saying come on Rebecca
[1:22:07] and so forth come on out
[1:22:09] we're going to
[1:22:11] and she answered I can't
[1:22:14] because she was in church right
[1:22:16] she she probably was on the hookup she
[1:22:20] probably saw it on her phone
[1:22:21] and she said listen
[1:22:23] I'd love to you know I love to go to the
[1:22:25] party but I can't
[1:22:29] can't do it and they asked why
[1:22:32] well
[1:22:33] we're under the blood
[1:22:35] we're under the blood oh come on let's
[1:22:37] go
[1:22:39] they may tell her come on let's go don't
[1:22:42] study that blood thing that's nonsense
[1:22:44] that old crazy religion your daddy's God
[1:22:46] got there can you imagine in this day
[1:22:49] they they send yeah a text they send me
[1:22:51] a WhatsApp or SMS they
[1:22:54] do a call a video call and they invite
[1:22:57] you and tell you your parents still go
[1:22:59] in that church why they still believe
[1:23:00] that
[1:23:02] but you're under the blood
[1:23:04] so it's a different rule for you
[1:23:08] [Applause]
[1:23:11] something in my heart tells me that I
[1:23:13] mustn't go beyond that blood
[1:23:16] something in my heart this is the trail
[1:23:18] right now
[1:23:19] and only went to the big parties and so
[1:23:22] forth then along about midnight they
[1:23:24] came they began to come a strange
[1:23:26] feeling just like coming over the world
[1:23:29] again no we spoke up a while ago
[1:23:32] something's wrong great howling Darkness
[1:23:35] set upon the Earth winds begin to blow I
[1:23:38] can see the little boy in this home here
[1:23:40] where we're going to go look at him he
[1:23:43] says
[1:23:44] say what is that
[1:23:46] you're not accustomed to that feeling
[1:23:48] it's strange it's silent is quiet
[1:23:53] feel kind of funny I see all the young
[1:23:55] girls was at the dancers they're
[1:23:57] hurrying up home oh my it's too late to
[1:24:00] pray then
[1:24:01] remember initially I said when you're
[1:24:04] given the opportunity to prepare
[1:24:06] is to make ready before
[1:24:09] it happens
[1:24:10] after that it's too late so here he says
[1:24:13] it's too late to pray then
[1:24:16] now the first thing you know he began to
[1:24:18] he begins to look around as a little boy
[1:24:20] and I could hear the little boy say
[1:24:21] Daddy
[1:24:23] did the word say that the Allah's son
[1:24:27] was going to be killing the whom
[1:24:29] yes
[1:24:31] well Daddy what about our home son we're
[1:24:35] just as safe as we can be
[1:24:37] how do you know we're safe
[1:24:40] we're obeyed God's word
[1:24:42] with under the blood
[1:24:44] I can hear him say just a little later
[1:24:47] after a while I look out the window
[1:24:48] little boy does looks there comes two
[1:24:51] big black wings moving through the air
[1:24:53] that's death
[1:24:55] and if there's any time that the black
[1:24:57] wings has struck the country
[1:24:59] it's today
[1:25:00] we've had earthquakes we've had
[1:25:02] pestilence I'll say we've had
[1:25:06] all kinds of things that could come to
[1:25:09] this land
[1:25:10] and on like they did in Egypt
[1:25:12] in our time we call it a pandemic we've
[1:25:15] had things that we have not seen in our
[1:25:17] lifetime
[1:25:18] seems strange
[1:25:20] but the last plague that hit Egypt
[1:25:22] Before Destruction was death and the
[1:25:25] last plague that hits the church's
[1:25:27] spiritual death right that's the last
[1:25:29] thing they're dying the churches are
[1:25:31] dying out getting we all we have having
[1:25:34] protractive meetings but no Revival no
[1:25:38] Revival they say the great Revival in
[1:25:40] America tell me where where is the
[1:25:42] Revival where's this at come on
[1:25:48] a little bit there again musicians could
[1:25:50] get ready you say we need what we need
[1:25:53] is an old-fashioned stirring again where
[1:25:56] old time John Wesley Revival where they
[1:25:59] stood and preached all night long and
[1:26:01] the power of the Holy Ghost falling over
[1:26:04] the audience that's what we need again
[1:26:06] amen I need a feel religious right now
[1:26:10] so listen friend let me tell you
[1:26:12] something when I think about a great
[1:26:14] need of this nation and I say of this
[1:26:16] church we don't need more seminaries we
[1:26:18] don't need more preachers what we need
[1:26:20] is what what we've got filled with the
[1:26:24] Holy Ghost preachers filled with the
[1:26:26] Holy Ghost that's what we need true as
[1:26:28] I'm standing here is that the truth no I
[1:26:30] want you to notice something else that
[1:26:32] little boy then would watch these Wings
[1:26:34] go down when it hit a home he heard a
[1:26:37] scream come but I can hear the little
[1:26:38] boy say Daddy are you sure that there's
[1:26:41] blood on there I can see him walk out
[1:26:43] and look over the door and say yes sir
[1:26:45] she's covered These Wings start towards
[1:26:49] that home but when she starts to come
[1:26:51] down like this she sees the blood he
[1:26:53] says when I see the blood I will pass
[1:26:55] will pass over you I will go over that's
[1:26:59] right on over God's provided way of
[1:27:01] escape and just as we close I want to
[1:27:03] touch one more in the message by faith
[1:27:06] Moses
[1:27:08] paragraph 121
[1:27:12] Prophet said here
[1:27:14] you can just go a few days and you can
[1:27:16] stay in the land this is continuing with
[1:27:18] Moses now
[1:27:19] Pharaoh may have made offers to them
[1:27:21] yeah what yeah but go on you could stay
[1:27:24] in the land you know we could we could
[1:27:26] allow you to be free and you can just
[1:27:27] live among us
[1:27:28] just live like us no you could be free
[1:27:32] we wouldn't call you
[1:27:34] slaves anymore
[1:27:35] will operate differently
[1:27:37] you go and stay in the land sure he
[1:27:40] knows they'd be back because he said you
[1:27:42] can go for a few days and come back
[1:27:45] we welcome you with moms you could go
[1:27:48] and return
[1:27:50] then he found out that wouldn't work so
[1:27:52] he taught something different he said
[1:27:54] I'll tell you what to do you go on out
[1:27:57] anywhere you want to go but leave all
[1:27:59] your wives all your children all your
[1:28:01] cattle back here so you're free to go
[1:28:03] you go you roam you relax you'll be free
[1:28:06] all the men you all could go on you know
[1:28:09] you could explore leave your wives the
[1:28:11] Catholic children
[1:28:13] and the reason I mentioned this here you
[1:28:15] see
[1:28:16] because he knowed
[1:28:18] they had possession
[1:28:20] back there
[1:28:22] that would lead them back
[1:28:24] and that's what the devil says to you
[1:28:26] just as long as you leave some of the
[1:28:28] things of the world hanging on you
[1:28:30] you still want to smoke you want to
[1:28:33] drink you want to dress like the world
[1:28:35] that's as good as the devil wants I hear
[1:28:39] so much about backsliding
[1:28:41] I don't believe and this is the prophet
[1:28:43] now
[1:28:44] I hear so much about backsliding I don't
[1:28:47] believe there's so much backsliding as
[1:28:49] people think they are
[1:28:51] they just leave too many possessions in
[1:28:54] Egypt to lay them back that's all
[1:28:57] backslidings are not what they say it is
[1:28:59] you left too much of the world back
[1:29:01] there that lose you brother I tell you
[1:29:04] when Israel got ready at midnight
[1:29:06] they had everything they had in this
[1:29:10] world packed up and ready to go
[1:29:13] that is preparation
[1:29:15] packed up and ready to go
[1:29:18] God sent us a Revival like that we pack
[1:29:21] up everything and get ready to go the
[1:29:23] Midnight Cry is coming going out to meet
[1:29:26] him you better have everything packed up
[1:29:28] you better not have nothing this will
[1:29:30] lure in you back any strings will hold
[1:29:32] you down pack up let's get ready we're
[1:29:35] going and you know what I tell you there
[1:29:38] was so true to god Till Pharaoh got so
[1:29:41] excited at midnight he said get out
[1:29:45] get out and get going take everything
[1:29:47] you got and go I'm so glad that a man
[1:29:50] can live so close to God till the devil
[1:29:53] don't know what to do with him that's
[1:29:55] right get out get going obey God by
[1:29:59] faith he saw the promise he
[1:30:02] he taken his way with the Lords despise
[1:30:05] few Pharaoh said take all your guts and
[1:30:08] get out of here that's why we want the
[1:30:10] devil to say to us just just take
[1:30:12] everything and go we don't even want you
[1:30:14] to stay you don't fit here you don't
[1:30:16] belong here you're causing too much

[1:30:24] don't know what to do with you he was so
[1:30:27] true to God by faith
