[45:22] put this time of pray in context
[45:24] actually Jonah to and from this one then
[45:28] Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out
[45:30] of his of the fish's belly and said I
[45:33] cried by reason of mine affliction unto
[45:36] the Lord and he heard me out of the
[45:39] belly of Hell cried I and thou hearest
[45:42] my voice for thou hast cast me into the
[45:45] deep in the midst of the Seas and the
[45:47] floods compassed me about all thy
[45:49] billows and thy waves passed over me and
[45:52] I said I am Castle to thy sight yet I
[45:55] will look again toward thy holy temple
[45:58] the waters can pass me about even to the
[46:01] soul that depth close me around about
[46:03] the weeds were wrapped about my head I
[46:05] went down to the bottoms of the
[46:07] mountains the the Twitter bars was about
[46:10] me for ever yet in the midst of all of
[46:13] that though has brought up my life from
[46:15] corruption o Lord my God when my soul
[46:18] fainted within me I remember the Lord
[46:21] and my prayer came in unto thee into
[46:24] nine Holy Temple me the Lord had a
[46:26] blessing to the reading of his word I
[46:29] just want to read some prayer requests
[46:32] you could begin to play something for
[46:35] prayer
[46:37] good morning since I'm asking for prayer
[46:39] for Frank Lord Oh a friend who lost his
[46:42] wife last Tuesday from cancer in our
[46:44] stomach please pray that God give him
[46:46] and his family strength and courage to
[46:49] that time of bereavement
[46:52] we have from sister Christine I would
[46:55] like to thank God for healing me and
[46:57] everyone for their prayer after the
[46:59] church prayed for me last week Wednesday
[47:01] I was able to walk the same night Amen
[47:08] [Applause]
[47:12] after I did the angiogram the doctor
[47:14] told me that two of my main arteries are
[47:17] blocked and my heart isn't getting
[47:19] enough oxygen and blood and they still
[47:21] believe my heart is only working 25% he
[47:25] said that there's nothing that they can
[47:27] do for me because there is no surgery or
[47:29] procedure that can help me I'm not
[47:32] considering the symptoms in my flesh and
[47:34] what the doctor said
[47:36] I'm claiming the promise that got me to
[47:39] me and by His stripes I'm healed I knew
[47:42] that all things work together for good
[47:44] to them that love God to them who are
[47:46] called according to his purpose so no
[47:49] matter what happens I have victory in
[47:50] Jesus in every situation like my brother
[47:54] job I know that the devil cannot touch
[47:56] me unless he gets permission from God
[47:59] though he slay me yet will I trust him
[48:02] through the pain and everything that I
[48:04] may go through I feel joy and peace when
[48:06] I think about job 34 where was now when
[48:10] I lead a foundation of the earth because
[48:12] I know I was there I am thanking God in
[48:15] advance for my healing all the blessing
[48:18] and victories in my life and all honor
[48:20] and glory to his name from your sister

[1:39:17] musicians if you have your Bibles would
[1:39:20] you turn it me to three portions of
[1:39:22] scripture reading from Matthew chapter 5
[1:39:26] verse 48 first Corinthians 13 and
[1:39:31] Ephesians 4:4 scripture readings this
[1:39:35] morning
[1:39:56] Matthew 5 and verse 48 be therefore
[1:40:00] perfect even as your father which is in
[1:40:03] heaven is perfect
[1:40:06] I drink from 1st Corinthians 13 reading
[1:40:12] from verse 1 first Corinthians 13
[1:40:15] reading from this one though I speak
[1:40:18] with the tongues of men and of angels
[1:40:20] and have not charity I am become as
[1:40:23] sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal and
[1:40:27] though I have the gift of prophecy and
[1:40:29] understand all mysteries and all
[1:40:31] knowledge and though I have all faith so
[1:40:33] that I can remove mountains and have not
[1:40:35] charity I am nothing and though I bestow
[1:40:38] all my goods to feed the poor and though
[1:40:41] I give my body to be burned and have not
[1:40:43] charity it profiteth me nothing chap
[1:40:47] charity suffereth long and is kind a
[1:40:49] charity envieth not charity vaunteth not
[1:40:52] itself is not puffed up that not behave
[1:40:55] itself unseemly seeketh not her own is
[1:40:58] not easily provoked thinketh no evil
[1:41:01] rejoice it not in iniquity but rejoices
[1:41:05] in the truth beareth all things
[1:41:06] believeth all things hopeth all things
[1:41:10] endureth all things charity never feel
[1:41:14] it but whether there be prophecies they
[1:41:16] shall fail whether there be tongues they
[1:41:19] shall cease whether there be knowledge
[1:41:21] it shall vanish away for we know in part
[1:41:24] and we prophesy in part but that part is
[1:41:28] temporary for when that which is perfect
[1:41:30] is come then that which is in part shall
[1:41:32] be done away and our last reading from
[1:41:37] the book of Ephesians reading Ephesians
[1:41:39] 4 and reading from verse 11
[1:41:43] and he gave some apostles and some
[1:41:45] prophets and some evangelists and some
[1:41:48] pastors and teachers for the perfecting
[1:41:50] of the Saints for the work of the
[1:41:52] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[1:41:55] Christ till we all plural come in the
[1:41:58] unity of the faith and of the knowledge
[1:42:00] of the Son of God unto a perfect man
[1:42:03] unto the measure of the stature of the
[1:42:07] fullness of Christ
[1:42:08] that we hence bore henceforth be no more
[1:42:11] children tossed to and fro carrier about
[1:42:14] with every wind of doctrine by the
[1:42:17] sleight of men and cunning craftiness
[1:42:18] whereby the lay in wait to deceive but
[1:42:22] speaking the truth in love may grow up
[1:42:24] into him in all things which is the head
[1:42:27] even Christ from whom the whole body
[1:42:30] fitly joined together and compacted by
[1:42:33] that which every joint supplieth
[1:42:35] according to the effectual working in
[1:42:38] the measure of every part maketh
[1:42:41] increase of the body unto the edifying

[1:43:49] in five minutes
[1:43:50] there'd be not a feeble person in our
[1:43:52] midst father may we have that kind of a
[1:43:54] service that man can never design but
[1:43:57] your Holy Spirit could bring to pass may
[1:43:59] you speak lip to ear to your children

[1:44:03] way and maybe have a wonderful time in
[1:44:06] your presence today bless the reading of
[1:44:08] the word blessed a hearing of it in a
[1:44:10] precious name of Jesus Christ and the
[1:44:11] church says Amen and he may come and
[1:44:14] give the Lord a hand of praise Amen you
[1:44:17] may be seated this morning
[1:44:19] so I trust you are here to have a
[1:44:21] wonderful time in the wood have a
[1:44:24] wonderful time around the Lord the world
[1:44:26] is in the spirit of what they are in the
[1:44:28] spirit of the carnival and the
[1:44:30] festivities and the revelry and the
[1:44:33] bacchanal they are in their spirit this
[1:44:35] is this is their time this is their
[1:44:37] season here and the country this is what
[1:44:38] they look forward for they have been
[1:44:40] counting down to this they have been
[1:44:42] staying up at night going to parties for
[1:44:44] this time this is this is the world
[1:44:46] having their revival this is the world
[1:44:48] having their celebration they are
[1:44:50] celebrating what they don't know and
[1:44:52] Jesus said that they know not what they
[1:44:54] worship so they don't even know what
[1:44:55] they are worshipping but they are
[1:44:56] actually in worship because when you see
[1:44:58] the pictures their hands are lifted
[1:45:00] there they would seem that they are
[1:45:02] happy but they know not what they
[1:45:03] worship but we here this morning we know
[1:45:06] who we worship we know why we worship we
[1:45:09] have a reason to worship we understand
[1:45:12] that we are born to worship and worship
[1:45:14] has nothing to do with our tiredness or
[1:45:16] our feelings are our emotions our
[1:45:19] emotional always receiver so God doesn't
[1:45:22] value our emotions and emotions always
[1:45:25] cutting us in the trouble you may be
[1:45:27] seated
[1:45:27] it was Moses emotions when he was
[1:45:29] supposed to speak to the rock he got
[1:45:31] angry and his emotions got him to hit
[1:45:33] the rock our emotions have no place in
[1:45:36] the economy of God but when God looks at
[1:45:38] us he looks past our emotions and the
[1:45:41] promised word for our deed is what
[1:45:43] refreshes us and we can worship not
[1:45:45] because of what we expect from God but
[1:45:48] because He is God because worship
[1:45:52] worship worship is based on who God is
[1:45:56] it's not based on what he does it's
[1:45:58] based on the fact that he is God and God
[1:46:01] is the definition of worship so in this
[1:46:04] season the world they worship the music
[1:46:07] they worship the styles they worship the
[1:46:09] revelry they're worshiping but we also
[1:46:11] all worship a recent Lama we are
[1:46:14] worshiping a King of Kings we are
[1:46:16] worshiping a Lord of lords and we come
[1:46:18] to the house this morning to get
[1:46:20] reminded of the reason why we sing we
[1:46:23] come to the house of God to be reminded
[1:46:25] of the reason why we shout we come to
[1:46:28] the house of God this morning to be
[1:46:30] reminded of who we are in the economy of
[1:46:34] God we come to the house this morning to
[1:46:36] be reminded that our boss made a hit our
[1:46:39] daily task but God has a vision for our
[1:46:41] eyes that goes beyond what we do between
[1:46:44] 9:00 to 5:00 or it before or working on
[1:46:47] shift up that man's timing and God's
[1:46:50] timing are different
[1:46:51] that man's requirement and course
[1:46:53] requirement is different and one of
[1:46:55] these days the mortgage will be no more
[1:46:58] one of these days the rent will be no
[1:47:00] more one of these days the sickness has
[1:47:03] to be no more one of these days the
[1:47:07] problems will be no more one of these
[1:47:09] days that discomfort will be no more one
[1:47:12] of these days it was not real cranked up
[1:47:14] and I woke up and I warm up but we are
[1:47:18] always on fire because we know who we
[1:47:21] are and we know who's we are we know we
[1:47:24] belong to somebody
[1:47:26] we are God's property and he could do
[1:47:29] whatever he wants with us he can move us
[1:47:31] he could shape us he can mold us he
[1:47:33] could break us up he could take the
[1:47:35] pieces up and if he doesn't like what he
[1:47:37] sees he could crumple it together
[1:47:39] because he is the Potter and we are a
[1:47:41] clay and his job is a shaper shop until
[1:47:45] he is pleased and when he is well
[1:47:47] pleased he can say no I could put
[1:47:49] something inside of you
[1:47:51] nestlé's of Honor vessels that he could
[1:47:54] use
[1:47:55] and the church seamen can the church see
[1:47:59] hallelujah we ought to be so excited
[1:48:03] every once in our smile on their face
[1:48:05] I've seen some pictures of Carnival and
[1:48:07] I see not one sad face yet so don't
[1:48:10] bring your sad face up in here there's
[1:48:12] got to be the happiest place up that you
[1:48:14] can be this morning there are people in
[1:48:16] carnival with diabetes within and they
[1:48:19] forget that and they're jumping when
[1:48:21] they shouldn't be jumping because in the
[1:48:23] spirit of what will die they are in the
[1:48:26] spirit of atomic photo their destination
[1:48:29] is for the bombs to take care of but our
[1:48:31] destination is a place where God will
[1:48:34] exchange your pina gives you happiness
[1:48:37] he will exchange your old age
[1:48:40] and give you a new party even your

[1:50:06] fire we're gonna have a people excited
[1:50:09] to be identified
[1:50:15] feeling fine just checking the
[1:50:18] temperature some of you some of you
[1:50:20] didn't do your homework because your
[1:50:23] homework should be to leave they will
[1:50:24] offer you I shouldn't have to be doing
[1:50:26] this this morning but because you didn't
[1:50:28] do your homework I'm gonna preach some
[1:50:30] demos over some people who came in here
[1:50:32] Saugus because I didn't do their
[1:50:33] homework it is your responsibility to
[1:50:36] come on fire the son leader shouldn't
[1:50:38] have to encourage you and and work you
[1:50:41] up you ought to come already you ought
[1:50:43] to be ready you ought to be on fire you
[1:50:46] ought to be played up you should have
[1:50:48] read the Bible this morning you should
[1:50:50] have went to bed last night thinking
[1:50:52] about the people that know their God
[1:50:54] shall do great exploits there is no
[1:50:58] excuse there is no excuse there is no
[1:51:01] excuse you may be seated everybody
[1:51:04] feeling fine everybody feeling fine I
[1:51:08] heard a speaker say one time for every
[1:51:11] person who says they grew up in poverty
[1:51:14] I'll find someone else who also grew up
[1:51:16] in poverty and made it for every person
[1:51:21] who said my father didn't give me a long
[1:51:23] pants I'll find somebody else whose
[1:51:26] father didn't give them a long pants but
[1:51:27] there was a desire in their souls up to
[1:51:30] be somebody to do something that's why
[1:51:33] Jesus said blessed are they that hunger
[1:51:35] and thirst after righteousness because
[1:51:38] hunger and thirst is not a one thing
[1:51:41] hunger is that one hunger means you
[1:51:44] really have to get it first means you
[1:51:46] have to get it doesn't matter the cost
[1:51:48] so when you're hungry and you're thirsty
[1:51:51] for righteousness you are already
[1:51:52] blessed because that's a prerequisite to
[1:51:55] being filled so I don't know how you
[1:51:57] came this morning but I'm hungry and if
[1:52:00] you didn't come hungry you better get
[1:52:02] hungry because that's the only way that
[1:52:04] you're gonna get fill blessed are they
[1:52:07] that hunger and thirst after
[1:52:09] righteousness for this child
[1:52:11] somebody's his shot somebody's his child
[1:52:15] [Applause]
[1:52:18] give the Lord I have no praise you made
[1:52:22] me see them everybody feeling fine it's
[1:52:28] a real battle you know but it doesn't
[1:52:30] matter how much the lid of hell is
[1:52:32] opened and if hell had an evacuation
[1:52:34] plan and everybody's on the earth right
[1:52:36] now they are still no match for the seed
[1:52:39] in your soul because greater is He
[1:52:41] that's in you
[1:52:42] even without the Holy Ghost greater is
[1:52:45] He that's in you than he does in the
[1:52:47] world because a seed in you is Christ in
[1:52:50] Word form in seed form but it still has
[1:52:53] all the properties of what it will
[1:52:55] become that's why the Egyptians said
[1:52:58] kill the babies because even in beauty
[1:53:01] form it's a problem that's why God told
[1:53:06] Joshua kill their babies because when
[1:53:08] the pb's grow up they have the potential
[1:53:10] to become like their father and in you
[1:53:12] is a baby word see it doesn't have
[1:53:16] leaves yet but it's a seed that's now a
[1:53:18] fruit yet but it's a seed but in the
[1:53:20] right environment under the right
[1:53:23] anointed you can even help yourself
[1:53:25] every time you come to church you are
[1:53:27] water in the water you are water in the
[1:53:30] cedar even when you don't believe that
[1:53:32] seed is growing Sarah had doubts up but
[1:53:35] the seed that was planted
[1:53:37] when Elohim spoke her unbelief couldn't
[1:53:40] even stop it because the sea could only
[1:53:42] produce after its kind somebody say man
[1:53:46] Oh summers gonna go free this morning
[1:53:49] the devil cannot stop it your sickness
[1:53:52] cannot stop it your bills cannot stop it
[1:53:55] your problem cannot stop it your
[1:53:57] marriage problems cannot stop it what's
[1:53:59] going on on your job cannot stop it your
[1:54:02] mistakes cannot stop it your failures
[1:54:04] cannot stop it the car problem cannot
[1:54:06] stop it
[1:54:07] the host problem cannot stop it your
[1:54:09] roof could have wind last night that
[1:54:11] cannot stop it
[1:54:12] because your destination is eternal God
[1:54:15] is not measuring you on the natural
[1:54:17] things he's measuring you on the
[1:54:19] spiritual
[1:54:21] [Applause]
[1:54:26] hallelujah you may be seated so I have
[1:54:31] an encouragement for you a title this
[1:54:33] morning
[1:54:34] the journey to perfection the journey to
[1:54:40] perfection and I read three scriptures
[1:54:44] Matthew 5:48 Jesus says be therefore
[1:54:47] perfect as your father in heaven is
[1:54:51] perfect and he let that Skippy just hang
[1:54:54] there in an imperfect world among
[1:54:57] imperfect people because Peter wasn't
[1:55:00] perfect and James wasn't perfect and
[1:55:02] John wasn't perfect but Jesus in be
[1:55:05] therefore perfect as your father in
[1:55:07] heaven is perfect
[1:55:09] and a lot of people they read the
[1:55:10] scriptures and a lot of people even in
[1:55:12] the message here about his perfection
[1:55:14] thing and they say but but I'm human and
[1:55:16] I how could I ever be perfect and I and
[1:55:17] I make mistakes and there's no such
[1:55:19] thing as perfection but God requires
[1:55:25] perfection come the church say Amen so I
[1:55:29] want to speak about this journey of
[1:55:30] perfection because things were once
[1:55:32] perfect
[1:55:36] so this journey of perfection in sir
[1:55:38] take us back to what already was it is
[1:55:42] not as if perfection did not exist and
[1:55:44] we are trying to achieve what was never
[1:55:47] here before it was here before so
[1:55:52] whenever something has happened before
[1:55:53] it's actually going back to man is
[1:55:58] saying well we have now achieved this
[1:55:59] and we have now achieved this and and
[1:56:01] we're not talking about achieving one
[1:56:03] has not been achieved before we're
[1:56:05] talking about going back to what we
[1:56:07] already had because God is perfect can
[1:56:12] we accept that this morning God is
[1:56:15] perfect his plans are perfect his
[1:56:19] thinking is perfect there is no mistake
[1:56:22] in his thinking
[1:56:23] there is no mistake in his plans when he
[1:56:26] puts out something it's perfect but the
[1:56:29] balance said he cannot put out something
[1:56:30] and have to change his mind about it
[1:56:32] because when he put it out the first
[1:56:34] time it was already perfect
[1:56:36] so his foreknowledge is perfect
[1:56:42] and the Bible said who he foreknew he
[1:56:44] called so his calling is perfect and who
[1:56:49] he called he justified so his
[1:56:50] justification is perfect and who we
[1:56:53] justify he has already Gaurav hi it's
[1:56:56] already perfect
[1:56:57] so predestination is perfect there is no
[1:57:02] mistake with predestination he is not a
[1:57:06] hope in that it works out he's not there
[1:57:10] calling is fingers crossed a night I
[1:57:12] wonder if they're gonna make it I hope
[1:57:14] they're gonna make it I'm rooting for
[1:57:15] them to make it his predestination is
[1:57:18] perfect there has never been someone
[1:57:21] pretending for their purpose who did not
[1:57:24] make him because his predestination is
[1:57:26] perfect because his foreknowledge upon
[1:57:31] which he pieces his predestination is
[1:57:33] perfect somebody brings back to me you
[1:57:39] may be seated
[1:57:39] so what are you saying my Isaac you
[1:57:41] being here this morning is perfect
[1:57:43] [Applause]
[1:57:48] you couldn't be home try the Venona his
[1:57:53] plan came together for you to be here
[1:57:56] you had enough to put in your car to be
[1:57:58] here your situation had to walk out to
[1:58:01] be here because he is in perfect control
[1:58:04] [Applause]
[1:58:06] with God his control is always perfect
[1:58:09] so where your child is right now to you
[1:58:13] it might be a problem
[1:58:14] but he is in perfect control he may be
[1:58:24] seated
[1:58:24] so God exists in by himself he is
[1:58:27] perfect there's no mistake about him he
[1:58:31] is there but his be his perfection
[1:58:33] requires certain things and his
[1:58:35] perfection knows how to do certain
[1:58:37] things so he says let there be light and
[1:58:40] there was light and that light because
[1:58:44] he is perfect he can only create
[1:58:46] perfection so that light was perfect and
[1:58:50] he separated the darkness and he
[1:58:52] separated the sea and the water from the
[1:58:54] land and he made perfect animals and
[1:58:57] then there was no problems when he put
[1:58:59] the animals there when he put the sunday
[1:59:01] everything was in perfect harmony but
[1:59:03] about him creatures the animals were
[1:59:07] perfect what was in the sea was perfect
[1:59:10] that life was perfect and when God was
[1:59:13] finished he said it was good that word
[1:59:17] good in the Genesis is perfect because
[1:59:20] his definition of good can only be met
[1:59:22] is that relative to what we see is
[1:59:24] relative to his stature of perfection so
[1:59:27] on the first day perfect secondly
[1:59:29] perfect the deep perfect 40 perfect 50
[1:59:37] and then God who is perfection because
[1:59:42] God is the world and the world is
[1:59:43] perfect God is spirit and the Spirit is
[1:59:46] perfect he said let us make man in our
[1:59:48] image and in our likeness and that
[1:59:51] manatee place on the earth was a perfect
[1:59:54] man when Adam walked out he was fit
[2:00:04] virtue knowledge temperance patience
[2:00:08] godliness brotherly kindness charity
[2:00:10] because it was the attributes of the
[2:00:13] expression of God locked up in a
[2:00:16] man-made you may be seated
[2:00:19] in the image and likeness to things
[2:00:23] image likeness like his father talked
[2:00:28] like his father act like his father
[2:00:31] behaved like his father everybody
[2:00:39] feeling fine
[2:00:42] Adam could not have heard a message be
[2:00:45] therefore perfect that message couldn't
[2:00:49] apply to him because he was perfect
[2:00:58] Adam did not sin Adam didn't get sick
[2:01:02] what Adams said had to happen have to
[2:01:04] happen
[2:01:06] let me read something from you from the
[2:01:08] Prophet is that okay wonderful
[2:01:11] now it took God six thousand years it
[2:01:14] didn't take him that long with about
[2:01:15] music but he took that long meaning he
[2:01:18] didn't need to take that long he wants
[2:01:20] to take he's sick six thousand years
[2:01:22] because we are taught that one day in
[2:01:23] heaven is that the thousand years on it
[2:01:26] and it was six thousand years or 60 that
[2:01:28] God building it now it took God six
[2:01:30] thousand years to establish it planted
[2:01:33] with good seeds and to bring for
[2:01:35] everything after its kind everything
[2:01:37] must come for after its kind and I want
[2:01:40] you to just lock your seatbelts in and
[2:01:42] today you know tomorrow's no work right
[2:01:45] Jews there's no work so forget all of
[2:01:47] that today we in we don't have any
[2:01:50] places Troy your watch out trail arm oh
[2:01:53] yes we are
[2:01:56] in an eternity time and that those words
[2:01:58] really don't go together but you know
[2:02:00] what I mean all of his seeds were
[2:02:04] couldn't so it must bring forth after
[2:02:05] its kind and God took six thousand years
[2:02:07] finally when he got it all made and
[2:02:10] finally arrived with its headquarters or
[2:02:12] the earth on the earth
[2:02:14] it's beautiful spot laying in stuff even
[2:02:16] called a Garden of Eden God made the
[2:02:18] world headquarters in the Garden of Eden
[2:02:20] in Egypt right at the east end of the
[2:02:21] garden was air quarters and over the
[2:02:24] whole situation he put his son and his
[2:02:26] son's wife over all of it that's right
[2:02:27] that's what God did he put them in
[2:02:29] control they could speak to the winds
[2:02:32] and it would cease to blow they could
[2:02:34] spit to the tree and remove from here to
[2:02:36] there it sounds crazy to us now but he
[2:02:39] could speak to the trees and achieve
[2:02:40] itself move
[2:02:42] the lion and the wolf said together and
[2:02:45] the lamb laid down with them there was
[2:02:47] no evil it was perfect listen to it
[2:02:50] perfect peace perfect harmony everything
[2:02:54] in perfection and when God had it under
[2:02:58] his control he had all in operations God
[2:03:01] was satisfied I'm gonna Brandon went
[2:03:03] toward the top what
[2:03:04] even though let me read it some of young
[2:03:05] people never saw this good let me get it
[2:03:20] I think of me a blessed over but I'm but
[2:03:22] but I'm at but the banner millisiemens
[2:03:23] was done by the dinosaurs just walking
[2:03:25] around normal walking the wrong normal
[2:03:29] Raven everything was perfect perfect God
[2:03:34] had a perfect plan perfect situation
[2:03:37] so this perfection is speaking about
[2:03:39] this morning is not something we're
[2:03:40] trying to achieve that we've never had
[2:03:41] before it was already here so when we
[2:03:44] say go back to even with osteoma going
[2:03:46] back to perfection the marriage that
[2:03:49] Adam and Eve had was perfect perfect
[2:03:52] harmony it wasn't no discord it wasn't
[2:03:55] Adam coming home saying where do and Eve
[2:03:57] I'm saying backin it was imperfection
[2:04:04] Adam couldn't hear message husband love
[2:04:06] your wife because it was perfect love
[2:04:09] Adam come he had a message swag
[2:04:11] reverence your husband because it was a
[2:04:13] perfect marriage
[2:04:13] I don't did enough to hear message I've
[2:04:16] gotta go I'm free because in the cool of
[2:04:18] the evening he would spend time in
[2:04:20] fellowship because that's what prayer is
[2:04:21] prayer is fellowship with God prayer is
[2:04:24] communion regard prayers are
[2:04:26] conversation with God so every evening
[2:04:29] animals phone in fellowship and prayer
[2:04:31] in communication talking to God and good
[2:04:34] love to come down in the cool of evening
[2:04:36] to god that was perfection
[2:04:38] when he had that type of relationship so
[2:04:44] when we talk about going black to
[2:04:45] perfection I'm going back to the
[2:04:47] beginning and God dropping the seat he
[2:04:50] told Abraham walk before me and be thou
[2:04:52] perfect God has always been desiring
[2:04:55] that which was lost when Adam fell
[2:05:01] come the church say man since the time
[2:05:04] of Adam fall we have been on a journey
[2:05:07] to perfection and that's my title this
[2:05:09] morning from the time of Adam's fall we
[2:05:11] have banana journey to perfection
[2:05:13] because imperfection there's no sickness
[2:05:15] imperfection there's no old age
[2:05:17] imperfection there's no death
[2:05:18] imperfection there's no backbiting and
[2:05:21] no jealousy you know and Motiti animals
[2:05:24] get along together
[2:05:25] the lamb is lies on with the sheep and
[2:05:27] the Sheep lining with a lion and I'm I
[2:05:29] could walk imperfect how many can you
[2:05:31] trust a man and that's what we're
[2:05:34] looking for this morning and we are
[2:05:36] going to be perfect God to make sure we
[2:05:39] are puffing send a fivefold ministry God
[2:05:43] set in the church pastors apostles
[2:05:45] preachers teachers evangelists you know
[2:05:47] what it is for what for the perfecting
[2:05:49] of the seats because you want to see
[2:05:52] perfection and the church say Amen and
[2:05:56] Paul see right now we preach in part we
[2:05:58] prophesy in part but when that which is
[2:06:01] perfect is come then that which is in
[2:06:03] part is done away with so it meant that
[2:06:07] Paul was seen as even after Jesus came
[2:06:12] even after Jesus gives you right now
[2:06:14] where he's standing today we talking in
[2:06:18] part we prophesy in part
[2:06:21] Jesus had already come but he was still
[2:06:23] seeing in part because another work that
[2:06:26] was still continuing on this journey to
[2:06:28] perfection all along this journey God
[2:06:32] was fixing things around under Satan's
[2:06:34] eyes because he preached the message
[2:06:36] centers even the Surat sickness or
[2:06:39] quarter this evil age so God has been
[2:06:41] working behind the scenes away from the
[2:06:44] eyes of Satan confusing the devil every
[2:06:47] single time taking the most unlikely
[2:06:49] people and turning them into believers
[2:06:52] the most unlikely people and telling
[2:06:55] them enter preachers the most unlikely
[2:06:57] people
[2:07:00] on this journey to perfection
[2:07:03] because even was perfection he wanted to
[2:07:06] bring man to perfection you may be
[2:07:10] seated everybody with me everybody
[2:07:13] feeling fine I know something here
[2:07:17] anywhere perfection perfection you see
[2:07:18] but when you look at your own life
[2:07:23] some of us trying to be good
[2:07:25] some of us trying to be okie some of you
[2:07:28] think back about how you talk to your
[2:07:30] boss and some of us when we look at what
[2:07:32] we see with God requirement and where my
[2:07:35] best goal is not easy thing God doesn't
[2:07:40] want the best version of yourself I try
[2:07:44] my best corner actually try your best
[2:07:46] you know he demands perfection it's
[2:07:51] wonderful and I totally agree with his
[2:07:54] testimony I'm not what I used to be and
[2:07:57] I'm not what I'm supposed to be and some
[2:07:59] people use that as an excuse to justify
[2:08:02] foolish ism
[2:08:04] so because I'm improved you have to take
[2:08:07] my level of improvement so when we
[2:08:08] correct you say well I'm not what I used
[2:08:09] to be so this you're watching the
[2:08:11] improvement but God's requirement is
[2:08:13] still God doesn't want an improved
[2:08:19] version
[2:08:20] you know it's software and an unfallen
[2:08:23] says which on one version to version 3
[2:08:25] version for god the 1d version number as
[2:08:27] you add to them he wants perfection
[2:08:31] there are a lot of people improving in
[2:08:34] the message they get them better they'd
[2:08:36] be even better but that is not what God
[2:08:38] is requiring he's not requiring a better
[2:08:42] behavior he's requiring a perfect
[2:08:43] behavior but I'm talking about faith and
[2:08:49] perfect fit I talked about perfect fit
[2:08:53] being peace in your position so over
[2:08:56] your journey your journey is to your
[2:08:57] position only when you get there could
[2:08:59] you say I'm standing perfect perfect
[2:09:02] standing and then a perfect seat can the
[2:09:04] church say Amen everybody but everybody
[2:09:06] feeling fine you see some of us we try
[2:09:09] to offer God our best and that's what he
[2:09:13] ended kidding offer a half-hearted thing
[2:09:16] you know he bought the best that he had
[2:09:19] but it was perfect because email brought
[2:09:23] what at that time he was a perfect
[2:09:25] revelation of the perfect sacrifice can
[2:09:28] the church salmon so and even brought
[2:09:31] the lamb and cut destroyed quartered
[2:09:33] blessed because he brought something
[2:09:36] simple it wasn't the best that he had
[2:09:38] but it was a perfect revelation of the
[2:09:41] perfect sacrifice and Gordon was perfect
[2:09:44] demands perfection
[2:09:47] somebody preached back to me can brought
[2:09:50] the best fruits anywhere I'll pick the
[2:09:52] best mango and the best banana and the
[2:09:55] best you enjoy and pick the best flowers
[2:09:57] he didn't bring second and eating or the
[2:09:59] second best thing he brought the best
[2:10:01] but he have no revelation I'm caught
[2:10:03] said to him he
[2:10:04] what your brother has a perfect
[2:10:06] revelation if you do what your brother
[2:10:09] do you will get the same kind of
[2:10:12] blessing the same anointing same
[2:10:15] inspiration same unction same mercy but
[2:10:20] what was him
[2:10:21] his hat was not a perfect seed in the
[2:10:24] first place
[2:10:25] because the Bible said he was of his
[2:10:26] father the devil so even in that
[2:10:29] condition he could not have received
[2:10:31] what a man had which was a perfect
[2:10:33] revelation cannot say man is everybody
[2:10:38] with me this morning I'll give you a
[2:10:40] secret you know but Abraham said the
[2:10:42] mind is the battleground but you know
[2:10:45] the devil already carries in your mind
[2:10:47] your heart because only the wood is the
[2:10:51] design of the toss of it oh come on
[2:10:53] somebody please back to me somebody
[2:10:54] please back to me so some of us be given
[2:10:58] too much credit to the devil because
[2:11:01] that's why under the Seventh Seal is
[2:11:02] silence because he said if the devil
[2:11:04] only hear what this thing is he could do
[2:11:05] great damage it takes us opening up to
[2:11:08] allow they're technically devil Terezin
[2:11:10] that's why the Bible said God AHA do you
[2:11:13] could protect your heart never car get
[2:11:15] dong in there
[2:11:16] you can't discern your torch he can't
[2:11:18] easily your intense only what you open
[2:11:20] up to him he could have access to but if
[2:11:22] you close him off this morning and shut
[2:11:25] out reasoning shut out doubt shut your
[2:11:27] pass out every window that the devil
[2:11:30] tries to get in you cut it off then the
[2:11:33] devil has no room to play in your mind
[2:11:34] he can't even get into your heart
[2:11:36] because your spiritual woman sealed up
[2:11:39] by a perfect wood by a perfect
[2:11:42] revelation by a perfect understand
[2:11:44] understanding can the church say man
[2:11:48] everybody feeling fine so we are on this
[2:11:51] journey of perfection so it had to start
[2:11:54] right there with Adam because Adam lost
[2:11:56] this place of perfection
[2:11:59] his position was one that was perfect
[2:12:02] and he fell from that perfection to a
[2:12:04] world of sickness to a world of
[2:12:07] discomfort to a world of pain to a world
[2:12:11] of sadness to a world of different
[2:12:13] situations it was not God's original
[2:12:16] intent for man to be in that way but God
[2:12:18] had attributes that he had to Express
[2:12:20] and we know that so forgot to express it
[2:12:23] man had to fall so he could express the
[2:12:26] actions that he had but because God is
[2:12:29] perfectly out of a perfect way of escape
[2:12:31] and a perfect plan of redemption that
[2:12:34] man knew if he could just get connected
[2:12:37] to that perfect way back to fellowship
[2:12:39] he could have access to a place for
[2:12:42] perfection once again come on somebody
[2:12:44] please back to me
[2:12:47] [Applause]
[2:12:49] and so that is not impossible to us as
[2:12:53] time progresses God has to unveil
[2:12:55] himself in pieces and right there on the
[2:12:58] earth we have Noah and we have Enoch but
[2:13:02] I Brandon said they were only at the
[2:13:03] same time and we know about Enoch what
[2:13:05] Aaron said ëno build the pyramids so
[2:13:08] Enoch had to had half court a revelation
[2:13:11] of perfection because he caught
[2:13:13] something that please God so much that
[2:13:15] God didn't even law allow him today
[2:13:19] he caught a secret he caught a
[2:13:21] revelation of this perfection and better
[2:13:24] balancing like this he's the one who
[2:13:26] build the pyramids so he left a sign of
[2:13:28] the secret to us that if we see this
[2:13:31] thing this this this structure this
[2:13:33] image that that there is the key to
[2:13:36] perfection the key to live in him and
[2:13:38] when the brother came and said this
[2:13:39] being when he is complete is the peanut
[2:13:42] mix into the rapture
[2:13:43] so God left his clues on this journey
[2:13:46] for us to pick up these clues and these
[2:13:48] pieces so that we would not be
[2:13:50] discouraged but we will be encouraged
[2:13:54] can the church say man we are on a
[2:14:02] journey this morning by the currents
[2:14:03] back to perfect fellowship with God
[2:14:05] before we leave this place we have to be
[2:14:07] perfect because but a Branham said only
[2:14:11] perfection can end up over there
[2:14:12] only perfect love could be there so
[2:14:15] before we leave this place we have to be
[2:14:17] perfect now what happens if a man in his
[2:14:19] house is perfect before you say it means
[2:14:21] his marriage will be perfect enough
[2:14:22] probably speaks in surely will be
[2:14:24] perfect in them if the cheering in the
[2:14:26] church end up in perfection what kind of
[2:14:27] houses will we have somebody preach back
[2:14:30] to me and the more you add the virtues
[2:14:34] is a nearer to perfection you become
[2:14:35] because this being one is completed on
[2:14:38] this journey it's a claim to perfection
[2:14:41] walking up seven steps to perfection
[2:14:44] isn't it right
[2:14:45] we know the song so when Adam fell he
[2:14:48] was actually walking down seven steps
[2:14:51] he reverse the trajectory so we are now
[2:14:55] commanded in this day to walk back up
[2:14:57] those steps walk back up the seven steps
[2:14:59] to charity to perfection to adoption to
[2:15:03] manifestation to God saying here is my
[2:15:06] spirit fluent freely notice not walking
[2:15:10] seven steps to church walking seven
[2:15:13] steps to the message we're walking seven
[2:15:15] steps to perfection can the church amen
[2:15:20] hallelujah somebody give the Lord a
[2:15:23] shout of praise we have to know our
[2:15:25] message we have to know the expected
[2:15:27] outcome we have to know what God
[2:15:29] requires from us so Enoch was there Enid
[2:15:32] had a testimony to please God
[2:15:34] I'm buddy but I'm dropped a mystery said
[2:15:36] Enoch and Noah at the same time we
[2:15:39] preach going into the Ark of safety but
[2:15:41] better Brennan brought out and that's
[2:15:42] perfect to preach but he said when Noah
[2:15:44] and Enoch were there to seem them and
[2:15:46] Enoch left he was raptured so he said
[2:15:48] that if Enoch was the one that was
[2:15:50] raptured and nor was the remnant
[2:16:00] and there are many who will be here who
[2:16:03] will have been in the message who would
[2:16:04] have known the truth and will find
[2:16:06] themselves in the tribulation but the
[2:16:09] bright elect the ones that come to
[2:16:10] perfection will be the one that create
[2:16:12] the resurrection and the one that make
[2:16:14] it to the rapture can the church say
[2:16:15] Amen from the message God's provide a
[2:16:23] place of worship remember when God
[2:16:26] speaks a word he can never take it back
[2:16:28] he has to really mean the same he can
[2:16:32] never see something I didn't say what I
[2:16:33] didn't exactly mean that so if he says
[2:16:37] he's gonna heal you he can't take it
[2:16:38] back you have to be healed
[2:16:40] and if he says I'm gonna judge somebody
[2:16:43] he can't even take it back because
[2:16:46] judgment is pronounced God can't take
[2:16:47] back his would can the church say man
[2:16:50] he knows the best to begin with we say
[2:16:53] things whatever Adam said that we think
[2:16:54] is the best then after I we take it back
[2:16:57] and we find we could I say it better we
[2:17:01] had a one shiny improvement away I
[2:17:02] didn't really mean it so sorry sorry
[2:17:04] about Jose the first time what Iranian
[2:17:05] meant to see was the food
[2:17:08] wasn't decent not good
[2:17:14] and then when you finish I have to say I
[2:17:16] didn't mean it I mean there's room for
[2:17:19] improvement
[2:17:20] and we tried to find ways to improve on
[2:17:23] the fact that the food wasn't good you
[2:17:28] know the piece could take a little work
[2:17:31] leather covered up and say well it have
[2:17:33] different ways to do fees
[2:17:36] your particular approach is not the
[2:17:40] approach and I'm used to people have
[2:17:43] different tastes from some people like
[2:17:44] coke and this is all an attempt for you
[2:17:46] to try to find a better way we are the
[2:17:50] ones who improve we are the ones who try
[2:17:52] to find and we always find ourselves in
[2:17:54] these situations trying to do things
[2:17:56] better but God is perfect there is no
[2:18:00] room for improvement all this perfect
[2:18:03] kind of church say Amen he knows the
[2:18:05] best typically we don't know the best to
[2:18:07] begin with we come into Christ coming to
[2:18:11] fellowship and we start to learn the
[2:18:12] word the word is preached to us and it
[2:18:15] opens our understanding to things we
[2:18:17] never understood things we never knew
[2:18:20] and then when you look back and say poet
[2:18:23] I already didn't know angel and it takes
[2:18:26] great wisdom to reach a point no to
[2:18:27] anything
[2:18:29] but the word in you is perfect that's
[2:18:32] why but I practice it a word is in the
[2:18:34] bride he's not measuring you based on
[2:18:37] knowledge because do you have all
[2:18:38] knowledge do you know all mysteries he's
[2:18:40] talking about the word seed in you
[2:18:42] because that's the mystery of Christ in
[2:18:44] you the hope of glory in this temporal
[2:18:46] condition you can never come to a
[2:18:49] complete understanding of God his
[2:18:52] thoughts are higher than our tosses
[2:18:53] Ouisa higher than always if you can
[2:18:56] measure the distance between the heavens
[2:18:58] and the earth they say that the heavens
[2:18:59] are higher than the earth so are my ways
[2:19:01] higher than your ways but grant you
[2:19:05] grace and mercy says those things are
[2:19:07] revealed belong to us and to our
[2:19:09] children the secret things belong to God
[2:19:12] but to His Messenger he allow us to get
[2:19:16] access to the mind of God and see things
[2:19:20] pertaining us
[2:19:23] and it's only by his grace we can get a
[2:19:25] revelation knowledge you could get from
[2:19:27] reading books but revelation you don't
[2:19:29] need a book to get revelation you can
[2:19:31] get revelation this morning because he
[2:19:33] is a God who can reveal and he is a
[2:19:35] revealer of the hidden things of God
[2:19:37] concerning you as an individual not just
[2:19:40] within the church but as an individual
[2:19:42] what God is calling you to to what God
[2:19:45] is calling you to achieve what God is
[2:19:47] calling you to become as we have formed
[2:19:50] into the word image can the church say
[2:19:52] man oh I feel religious this morning I
[2:19:55] feel excited this morning the devil
[2:19:58] doesn't know who I am
[2:19:59] he doesn't know my potential he doesn't
[2:20:01] know what I'm going to become kind of
[2:20:06] church hey man so God knows the best to
[2:20:11] begin with we try different jobs we try
[2:20:15] different careers we try what comes to
[2:20:18] us and say we'll give it a try with God
[2:20:20] there's no court giving it nothing oh
[2:20:22] try say give you a mighty man of Valor
[2:20:26] he wasn't trying
[2:20:27] he already by for knowledge so that
[2:20:30] victory already won
[2:20:31] he is calling his rewinding tapes and
[2:20:35] calling people this morning
[2:20:37] [Music]
[2:20:39] let me set up one more time you know
[2:20:42] trying because you don't know the future
[2:20:43] but God who knows the future rewinding
[2:20:46] tape and Sikkim
[2:20:51] God rewinding tipsy not even talking
[2:20:53] about everyone anything because his
[2:20:56] predestination is based on foreknowledge
[2:20:59] he's not powerful God knew all who were
[2:21:03] coming to the message he knew everyone
[2:21:06] who had come and he could Romney teams
[2:21:08] don't see who would make it and sell say
[2:21:10] all right
[2:21:10] but as he because not everybody's with
[2:21:13] us if Judas was given power you know and
[2:21:17] Jesus was also predestined to achieve
[2:21:21] his purpose in the perfect plan of God
[2:21:24] so the professional time Atacama test
[2:21:27] everybody think me impressed I'm talking
[2:21:28] about bright predestination that you
[2:21:31] cannot miss it you cannot fail you shall
[2:21:34] receive the Holy Ghost it is because God
[2:21:37] fast forward the tip of your lives and
[2:21:40] so when you cut the Holy Ghost he can
[2:21:43] rewind the tape
[2:21:45] from the moment you were born and send
[2:21:48] an angel over your life it is because he
[2:21:52] fast power the tape and saw your
[2:21:54] adoption he could dispatch an angel from
[2:21:57] the moon you were born is because God
[2:21:59] said flash forward the tape and see all
[2:22:02] your mistakes and still see when you are
[2:22:04] restored how do you rewind the tape and
[2:22:07] say I'm calling you you are gonna make
[2:22:10] it can the church Shaymin
[2:22:14] and we are here together joining this
[2:22:18] journey to perfection to knee to
[2:22:23] perfection we are all on this journey
[2:22:25] because perfection is the key to the
[2:22:28] bring on the resurrection deal without
[2:22:31] us cannot be made perfect so brother
[2:22:33] branham is waiting for this junior
[2:22:34] perfection to be complete so that he can
[2:22:37] be raised from the dead David is waiting
[2:22:39] on his journey of perfection to come to
[2:22:41] completion for somebody to cross this
[2:22:43] finish line for perfection because as we
[2:22:46] cross this finish line of perfection
[2:22:48] tell me a power put into the church that
[2:22:51] will bring on the resurrection somebody
[2:22:55] preached back to me perfect worship
[2:22:58] perfect bread perfect revelation perfect
[2:23:02] understanding perfect standing puppet
[2:23:05] state listen you can't be in
[2:23:09] professional until at the same time you
[2:23:12] have to have left sin somewhere along
[2:23:14] the journey on this way to perfection
[2:23:16] because of course where you get the
[2:23:18] perfection is the more you are Christ
[2:23:20] begins to look the same because with the
[2:23:22] problem said the reflection will be the

[2:25:25] as journey is bringing us closer to that
[2:25:28] spot where either God says our work has
[2:25:30] done and our time is up and we join
[2:25:32] those who will wait on perfection who
[2:25:34] will be raised up for those who will be
[2:25:36] the perfection that will raise the other
[2:25:38] is a kind of church say Amen just rip it
[2:25:43] self because corn is perfect
[2:25:48] so end quote set the parsing the perfect
[2:25:52] listen well he still imperfect because
[2:26:01] he doesn't make mistakes
[2:26:04] I will speak for itself
[2:26:08] and the fruits have to be his roots the
[2:26:15] site but be his size if when it's
[2:26:20] finished and at the end of a journey you
[2:26:23] see the fruit looking crumpled up and he
[2:26:29] leaves like a winner they need to wonder
[2:26:34] who
[2:26:46] Academy speak the truth this morning
[2:26:51] because by their fruits you will know
[2:26:54] who everybody is to them you know things
[2:26:58] mean nothing right everybody everybody
[2:27:09] [Music]
[2:27:17] listen Hansen but the measure is not on
[2:27:27] homicide Melissa honey message
[2:27:29] perfection and perfection is beyond what
[2:27:34] I could see has nothing to do with what
[2:27:38] we see here it's but quarter see how
[2:27:45] close are you to that perfection are you
[2:27:51] at in your life do you have the right
[2:27:54] attitude towards God right
[2:27:59] I teach you towards his house right I
[2:28:02] teach you towards you would and I write
[2:28:06] because because you're right mental
[2:28:12] attitude towards every divine promise of
[2:28:17] God is what brings it the pass
[2:28:22] now it is right and also much you know
[2:28:27] some tradition as a very disrespectful
[2:28:31] country
[2:28:38] and if you imagine you wish someone was
[2:28:41] operational naturally
[2:28:43] who he think he is telling me laughter
[2:28:46] I'm ticketing court not taking maximum
[2:28:57] you didn't ask me my ambitions you
[2:29:01] didn't know what I want to do what they
[2:29:04] wanna be come on what I want to achieve
[2:29:06] I wanna you think God asking you that
[2:29:19] well Adam look at Evy say you are flesh
[2:29:25] of my flesh
[2:29:28] you are born of my born life of my life
[2:29:37] when one looks at his bride she must be
[2:29:41] a perfect reflection she copy well and I
[2:29:46] saw what my husband's seeing a bowler
[2:29:49] said but I think it should be no it has
[2:29:53] to be this is what
[2:29:59] this is what is holy appearance because
[2:30:05] it to become one
[2:30:15] if Eve had a perfect revelation of her
[2:30:20] husband Adam Abid home Sheila tell the
[2:30:23] devil come back later but because he was
[2:30:31] the byproduct and God never spoke
[2:30:33] directly to evil or God spoke to Adam it
[2:30:35] was Adams responsibility to tell Eve how
[2:30:39] to conduct herself how to behave herself
[2:30:42] god never told Eve only tree in a city
[2:30:45] garden that was a to Adam Adam was
[2:30:46] posted at his time and break that down
[2:30:48] and clarify doesn't make it clear to Eve
[2:30:52] so I don't have Adam didn't finish the
[2:30:54] whole message to Eve but when the devil
[2:30:56] came and saw the weakness he said what
[2:30:58] God said because he never was imparted
[2:30:59] in meeting either he devil and all
[2:31:00] didn't know this whatever looking for
[2:31:03] opening if it was Adam Adam knew better
[2:31:08] I'm gonna balance said if Eve had
[2:31:10] steered behind the word never would have
[2:31:14] had no room and when you get in trouble
[2:31:15] you know why it's because he get out
[2:31:17] from behind the wood
[2:31:20] you are loved your own ideas you owning
[2:31:22] your own ambitions so the devil start to
[2:31:24] play on ambition alone
[2:31:26] if you take this suit you'll be just
[2:31:27] like good having knowledge having wisdom
[2:31:31] knowing right from wrong and you get
[2:31:34] caught up in that and we live in this
[2:31:39] easy people having itching ears you want
[2:31:40] to know this you want to note that and
[2:31:42] and we are trying to find the mind of
[2:31:45] Christ on every situation because the
[2:31:49] perfect God has a perfect answer to
[2:31:51] every situation getting back to
[2:31:54] perfection
[2:31:55] it means perfect order perfect Church
[2:31:58] order perfect harmony there is more up
[2:32:00] your outside of perfection you can have
[2:32:05] your idea it has to because perfect idea
[2:32:08] we make decisions and many of us become
[2:32:12] better madam said listen if you want to
[2:32:13] get married go to prayer gave you Holy
[2:32:15] Ghost because God has a thought on these
[2:32:17] things he has a thought on every matter
[2:32:20] but because we walk in imperfection we
[2:32:23] end up in problem because we walk away
[2:32:25] from the perfect will of God because we
[2:32:29] need an overall understanding when he
[2:32:31] personally not only all understanding
[2:32:33] but if God is a God of perfection and he
[2:32:37] by design structured things in a certain
[2:32:40] way to guide us to perfection
[2:32:44] that's why this church order that's why
[2:32:47] we supposed to be in church that's why
[2:32:49] we supposed to be prayed up
[2:32:50] that's the order he himself lit out and
[2:32:52] he passed away of perfection and he kept
[2:32:55] dropping the message Abraham
[2:32:57] walk before me and be perfect when Jesus
[2:32:59] himself came he said be therefore
[2:33:01] perfect as your father in heaven is
[2:33:03] perfect
[2:33:04] he dropped a promise on all of them
[2:33:08] and the Ministry of the five-fold is
[2:33:12] temporary because it until we all come
[2:33:16] into the unit's kept defeat until we
[2:33:19] reach perfection it's for the perfecting
[2:33:22] of the scenes so when the seeds are
[2:33:25] perfect the five-point ministries work
[2:33:27] is complete when we are all in the unity
[2:33:30] of the faith the minister the file is
[2:33:32] complete when we are all in a measure of
[2:33:35] the stature of the fullness of Christ
[2:33:36] that ministry is complete you've ever
[2:33:41] seen it so the focus is nothing who is
[2:33:45] the faithful and that - the focus the
[2:33:47] focus is the perfection because God is
[2:33:49] looking for perfect bride you may be
[2:33:54] seated
[2:33:55] many of us we focus on activity and not
[2:33:59] productivity pastor said explain
[2:34:05] you know what some jobs and I'm calling
[2:34:08] anybody because I thought you have
[2:34:10] people doing things doing things that do
[2:34:12] anything do anything and we finna work
[2:34:13] hard and it's real activity but no
[2:34:18] productivity they're not added any value
[2:34:23] whole day your movie paper here back
[2:34:27] here you move it here move it here we
[2:34:31] were here to switch things up put it
[2:34:33] back here
[2:34:34] recording he moving it he moving into
[2:34:38] relativity you sweatin like I saw
[2:34:42] somebody recently a video somebody
[2:34:43] shoveling sand and they trying to throw
[2:34:46] it into a wheelbarrow meanwhile there's
[2:34:49] somebody else who do understand what's
[2:34:51] happening taken out on this wheelbarrow
[2:34:54] that he threw in in to try miss next
[2:34:57] pile I'm dead clearly didn't communicate
[2:34:59] and they never watch one another so as
[2:35:01] each row interview bury the other one
[2:35:03] taking all the wheelbarrow on to someone
[2:35:05] else
[2:35:06] you tell them guys all the a Wigner we
[2:35:09] say what can really only I take him out
[2:35:11] to do tomorrow and put them in here and
[2:35:13] say I taking it from here put them in a
[2:35:14] wheelbarrow activity and no productivity
[2:35:18] because at the end of the day you cannot
[2:35:20] equal the activity to a result not the
[2:35:23] result that gordon chism is not
[2:35:24] complicated for all these years since
[2:35:27] Adam fell you want relationship are you
[2:35:29] looking for a wife the bottom line for
[2:35:35] goes looking for a villain and this
[2:35:38] wife's will be making a cell ready a
[2:35:40] perfect Lord a perfect groom a perfect
[2:35:42] corner perfecting has been waiting all
[2:35:45] these years for perfect brain so every
[2:35:48] prophet every preacher every judge every
[2:35:51] cheap church leader from Genesis to know
[2:35:54] has been preparing and putting messages
[2:35:56] and love letters and trying to chance
[2:35:58] for the thoughts of God so that this
[2:36:00] bride could be making us ever ready by
[2:36:02] being formed with a wood image so she
[2:36:05] can measure up as a perfect pray for a
[2:36:07] perfect husband
[2:36:09] with perfect works perfect manifestation
[2:36:12] because there's a platter when Jesus
[2:36:14] read his personal orders upon me and
[2:36:15] when he left other party week later the
[2:36:18] day of judgment and these things in
[2:36:19] there it was not for him to fulfill it
[2:36:21] was for this wife of his who would be
[2:36:23] just like him who would have a perfect
[2:36:25] understanding and a perfect revelation
[2:36:27] and have a perfect approach because you
[2:36:30] know human Instagram you can never have
[2:36:32] a perfect approach and I two weeks ago I
[2:36:35] spoke about a woman I knew well I said
[2:36:36] if it was one of us I mean woman
[2:36:38] anywhere it might not have gone the same
[2:36:40] way go friend your husband and you say I
[2:36:48] have none I say well yeah yeah yeah I've
[2:36:51] known it's for a nice fight anyone
[2:36:54] anyway I even order not me today but
[2:36:59] whoever Jesus handled
[2:37:02] it did something in her soul that you
[2:37:05] realize deliverance had come my way some
[2:37:09] of us but yet is the grace of God that
[2:37:11] delivered us along the way some of us
[2:37:16] has wall other people - Oh a measuring
[2:37:18] rod which is not perfection and Oh a
[2:37:20] measuring rod or what experience
[2:37:22] somebody said to me recently well I lose
[2:37:23] because of how I came three messages
[2:37:25] speaking about themselves how what the
[2:37:27] experience was it looking at in a
[2:37:28] certain way you express it you
[2:37:30] experience I want to measure against you
[2:37:32] would experience and God call people
[2:37:34] from all kinds of walks of life and some
[2:37:37] to dewater some to refer some to great
[2:37:40] trials but all so because you went too
[2:37:44] far you have a problem and somebody
[2:37:45] you're going to flood they supposed to
[2:37:48] go through what I went through who say
[2:37:50] so
[2:37:51] I told this once we all go to the blood
[2:37:54] once we all go if likewise require
[2:37:57] me because once you go to the blood when
[2:37:59] God looks truly blood he sees perfection
[2:38:01] because it's by His perfect blood we
[2:38:03] could be perfect or somebody preached
[2:38:06] back to me I pray this help somebody I
[2:38:10] don't want to be too much longer with
[2:38:11] you but I'm enjoying this I don't know
[2:38:12] about you but I'm enjoying what I love
[2:38:15] talking about Jesus and I love to put a
[2:38:17] wave back to it back to fellowship the
[2:38:19] way back to retention the way back to
[2:38:21] how we are supposed to be in God in
[2:38:23] perfect order perfect harmony perfect
[2:38:25] worship
[2:38:29] can the church say men and through God's
[2:38:33] grace he made a way for us that broke us
[2:38:37] from the law and away from legalism can
[2:38:41] the church say Amen hallelujah
[2:38:43] hallelujah hallelujah Oh hallelujah
[2:38:47] in Galatians 3:13 Christ has redeemed us
[2:38:49] from the curse of the law the law was
[2:38:54] hard on him it was almost a curse upon
[2:38:56] mankind no one can be pure enough nicey
[2:38:59] law no one could it not be curly law
[2:39:01] seed how supposed to be here but people
[2:39:03] couldn't meet the measurement of the law
[2:39:06] nobody was holy enough to obey the
[2:39:08] entire law come on now let's get down to
[2:39:12] the issue you know your struggles you
[2:39:14] know your challenges you know your
[2:39:15] child's and if you look at it from a
[2:39:17] legal perspective you know you're not
[2:39:19] measuring up from a law perspective the
[2:39:22] law held men in bondage and showed every
[2:39:25] imperfection that manhunt but the blood
[2:39:28] of Jesus came to free us from this curse
[2:39:31] of sin death and the law with the law
[2:39:37] there was never a way of completion
[2:39:40] there was never a way it had to be
[2:39:43] repeated so every year you have to get a
[2:39:45] Salaam it was a permanent rehash
[2:39:50] regurgitation a redoing of the thing
[2:39:52] because the law was a temporary thing
[2:39:55] today's a lamb tomorrow's a dog next
[2:39:58] week is a goat there's a bull you're
[2:39:59] doing something else to try to make up
[2:40:01] it never stopped constantly trying to
[2:40:04] cover your sin cover your problem cover
[2:40:08] your situation and the priest would
[2:40:10] enter the Holy of Holies once a year
[2:40:12] every year the sprinkled blood on the
[2:40:15] mercy seat of the Ark of the Covenant to
[2:40:18] atone for the sins of the nation of
[2:40:20] Israel but when Jesus came it was not
[2:40:24] the law it was the perfect sacrifice
[2:40:26] evil started by revelation what was a
[2:40:30] temporary situation but when Jesus came
[2:40:33] to make a way to perfection he give us a
[2:40:36] perfect sacrifice can the church Shaymin
[2:40:43] that we don't have to be going back to
[2:40:46] do some act to access the Holy of Holies
[2:40:49] that when Jesus died of Eros ran from
[2:40:52] top to bottom to give sons and daughters
[2:40:54] access to perfection access to the
[2:40:57] Holies of Holies access to Christ
[2:40:59] himself he was the perfect atonement and
[2:41:01] that would perfect atonement is inside
[2:41:04] of us right now and the church came in
[2:41:06] and that's why we're gonna make it
[2:41:08] that's why we're gonna overcome that's
[2:41:10] why we're gonna receive the Holy Ghost
[2:41:12] that's why we're gonna be delivered
[2:41:14] that's why the virtues will live in us
[2:41:16] and the church amen
[2:41:18] and that ever cannot do anything about
[2:41:20] it hallelujah I'm not gonna be too much
[2:41:28] longer so it must be a perfect people
[2:41:31] come because you have to stand and be
[2:41:33] married to a perfect son of God
[2:41:36] and I really want to nail this time
[2:41:38] because a lot of people who believe that
[2:41:39] without follow any message and I trying
[2:41:41] to live right and I'm doing my best and
[2:41:43] I'm doing water service and and that is
[2:41:45] not perfection
[2:41:51] so how can you do it through anything
[2:41:54] else but the perfect Word of God which
[2:41:56] is the waters of separation and washes
[2:41:58] us from our sins that's right the blood
[2:42:00] of Jesus Christ think of it the dripping
[2:42:03] bloody would the would have God bleedin
[2:42:06] blood to wash the bride in she stands
[2:42:09] perfect virgin unadulterated she never
[2:42:12] sinned in the first place that some
[2:42:14] things that ought to be kind of a man
[2:42:17] surely and gossip about a piece of wood
[2:42:20] but about him said if God expects people
[2:42:22] to be perfect as Jesus said be therefore
[2:42:25] perfect even as your father in heaven is
[2:42:26] perfect there must be some preparation
[2:42:29] somewhere in question and answers in 64
[2:42:34] but Abraham said Paul said though I
[2:42:36] speak with tongues of men and angels and
[2:42:38] do I give my body to be burned as a
[2:42:40] sacrifice do I understand all the misuse
[2:42:42] of the wood do I give all my goods to
[2:42:44] the poor and all this thing and have not
[2:42:46] charity answer nothing I have feared
[2:42:49] that I can move mountains and so forth
[2:42:50] I'm still nothing then he said that
[2:42:51] which is in part will be done away with
[2:42:53] when that which is perfect is come or
[2:42:56] when that which is perfect is made known
[2:42:58] can the church say Amen so he said I
[2:43:01] went out with the public his comments
[2:43:02] also when that spoofing is made known
[2:43:05] and we know to the world I went Luther
[2:43:07] him he shone a light on the written word
[2:43:09] and when Wesley came he shot a brighter
[2:43:12] light on the written word and when
[2:43:14] Malachi spoke him he brought the full
[2:43:16] light on the written word and brought in
[2:43:18] as a full message of a perfect word of
[2:43:21] all the word that was required for us in
[2:43:24] this day to tie up all the loose ends
[2:43:27] for all it from Genesis to Revelation so
[2:43:29] that a perfect wood cedar could be
[2:43:31] planted through us that we don't come
[2:43:33] and preach our own interpretation of our
[2:43:35] own ideas of our own dreams our own
[2:43:37] vision but the Word of God that
[2:43:39] essentially is His Prophet to bring a
[2:43:42] wife to Isaac and to salmon so because
[2:43:45] we have a perfect word and we have every
[2:43:48] shield all of the seeds are open and
[2:43:50] every mystery is not reveal know we
[2:43:53] could have perfection so let us go up to
[2:43:55] perfection can the church
[2:44:00] but events have God's will for us is
[2:44:03] perfection and that perfection is
[2:44:06] patience waiting on God and waiting for
[2:44:10] God
[2:44:10] this is the process of character
[2:44:13] development how highly God has commanded
[2:44:16] these scenes of the Dark Ages kind of
[2:44:18] church say man everybody feeling fine in
[2:44:21] God provided peace of worship the church
[2:44:24] will come to justification to looter
[2:44:26] through scientific Asian true Wesley
[2:44:28] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:44:30] and the Pentecostals and go right on
[2:44:32] into the perfection of the Son of man
[2:44:35] that when a husband and a wife will be
[2:44:38] the same self persons God will be so
[2:44:41] manifested into his bride his church did
[2:44:44] they will be brought to seem they are
[2:44:46] one now you see where we are come the
[2:44:49] church say man so how could God forgive
[2:44:52] someone and give mercy to someone and
[2:44:54] you don't do the same you see it takes
[2:44:56] an experience for you to come to
[2:44:58] perfection to think the way he does and
[2:45:00] forgive the way he forgives that's why
[2:45:02] you can't judge anybody because you
[2:45:03] don't know God's mind on the matter you
[2:45:06] don't know courts thoughts on the
[2:45:07] situation you have to strive to put your
[2:45:11] thoughts on the subjects on your
[2:45:12] reasoning your affection your
[2:45:14] interpretation and allo God to deal with
[2:45:16] your life and you keep climbing seven
[2:45:19] steps to perfection can the church say
[2:45:21] man
[2:45:22] I hope this help somebody today that is
[2:45:25] not just coming to church it's not just
[2:45:27] a sure it's not just trying to be
[2:45:28] religious because they're religious
[2:45:30] spirits in on Sunday the kap-40 miss
[2:45:34] church because this religious bird our
[2:45:36] religious we will find himself in charge
[2:45:37] they're not gonna be playing Mass on
[2:45:38] Monday and Tuesday the religious spirit
[2:45:41] have to be in church realize a religious
[2:45:43] spirit but he related we're not looking
[2:45:46] for perfection the religious spirit just
[2:45:49] feeding on being in church is a spirit
[2:45:52] quick and anointed shaking everything
[2:45:55] but this religious spirit but what is
[2:45:57] Hannah talk about let us get to
[2:45:59] perfection because perfection no means
[2:46:02] your behaviors gone
[2:46:03] it means perfect character perfect
[2:46:07] behavior it means forgiven for crisis
[2:46:10] and God will send situations to make
[2:46:13] sure that presses the crack the
[2:46:14] development we don't everything geez
[2:46:17] have to learn obedience by the things he
[2:46:19] suffered and God brings innovations to
[2:46:22] you to fulfill that diode die out until
[2:46:27] there's nothing else to die out I said
[2:46:29] when they are dead money said dead man
[2:46:31] cancer back and it that money because
[2:46:35] give you you can say about listen you is
[2:46:37] no good your cook you can't do
[2:46:39] anything I think after while you're
[2:46:40] there take me take me there you see
[2:46:42] somebody go Percy listen listen listen
[2:46:44] cook
[2:46:46] yeah idiot
[2:46:51] because listen you know where you come
[2:46:53] from you know and there but those people
[2:46:55] can push in you and you behave yourself
[2:46:56] your behavior savvy be and then God
[2:46:58] knows what button to push your heart
[2:47:02] wasn't even as I say the hot button
[2:47:04] and when you're hot button get push
[2:47:06] people who say I overcome tempo intake
[2:47:09] because you can overcome temper ahead of
[2:47:11] it but real temper and return presenting
[2:47:13] and then because but Abraham said even
[2:47:15] it never let me tell test them with you
[2:47:25] what is your hot button

[2:47:35] Donna said Diana
[2:47:37] is only when he is dead you have no hot
[2:47:38] button so if you have our hot button
[2:47:40] this morning you know you know people
[2:47:42] see it
[2:47:43] not much as a bottom you know what I
[2:47:45] think that's suit me Jack is what after
[2:47:48] day
[2:47:52] I read a story of a lady one time came
[2:47:54] to her past sunset pasta I have to leave
[2:47:56] the church he said what what happened is
[2:48:00] a car take the hypocrisy
[2:48:04] the hypocrisy and he passed adizero hot
[2:48:08] but now
[2:48:09] he said here's what to do no problem I
[2:48:12] wanted to get a cup of water
[2:48:15] philately brim you say when I look
[2:48:18] around I see no can't he said okay good
[2:48:20] good good fill a cup of water to be
[2:48:22] Britain and I wanted a walk around each
[2:48:24] other with it so she fairly cup to the
[2:48:27] brim and you walk her into it when she
[2:48:29] come back to the office
[2:48:30] you say how much hypocrisy see she said
[2:48:32] I see not nothing because I just so
[2:48:34] focus on this glass of water that I even
[2:48:38] get to look up and see anything unless
[2:48:43] you realize that she was even looking at
[2:48:45] herself she wasn't looking at you would
[2:48:49] just spending time with everybody else
[2:48:51] oh the world public gospel it's the fame
[2:48:54] and plenty people come with her under
[2:48:56] the hot buttons some will have 20
[2:48:58] unbuttoned somebody have 10,000 hot
[2:49:00] button
[2:49:02] but by the time you reach perfection the
[2:49:05] hot button supposed to be gone
[2:49:07] similarly a hot button is e.length the
[2:49:09] service
[2:49:15] sooo in service you're sitting time hug
[2:49:17] button start to get a warm if there is
[2:49:21] hot yet to them so they get warm and as
[2:49:23] the minutes pass but a clock is that
[2:49:25] they get hotter and hotter and hotter
[2:49:30] some hot buttons attack for service they
[2:49:34] find were to worship you this morning
[2:49:35] again hot right now
[2:49:38] somebody hot buttons defined by the
[2:49:39] antenna suppose in preaching and ice all
[2:49:41] your own understanding but God had us to
[2:49:43] speak about hot buttons this morning if
[2:49:49] we put them at tea something real hot
[2:49:50] button go on 110 boom hot button why we
[2:49:53] have a tip why he ministers than
[2:49:54] preaching some people hot button is
[2:49:57] where is silicon church only do no time
[2:49:59] I see we in the house this morning the
[2:50:05] assistant pastor in the house this
[2:50:07] morning I had a meteor assembly officers
[2:50:13] and I say when I knew usher comes it
[2:50:14] copied after lonely the seating
[2:50:16] arrangement at existing each it it has
[2:50:20] to be a girl can lead people to usher
[2:50:21] people where it's supposed to be led by
[2:50:23] the spirit you don't know who quad want
[2:50:25] to put you next to that you can any Holy
[2:50:26] Ghost
[2:50:31] some people hot-button listing they have
[2:50:34] troubled appetites anything is when God
[2:50:39] gave him a small salary Depina - no but
[2:50:42] I see sorry grody button
[2:50:49] similar hot buttons who do officers are
[2:50:51] in a church and we have fighting up with
[2:50:54] these things when this was going on to
[2:50:55] perfection are we here this morning you
[2:51:04] know some people kind of falling asleep
[2:51:06] without buttoning
[2:51:09] people rather hope and I do call the hot
[2:51:11] button
[2:51:20] you see it takes maturity to allow the
[2:51:22] wood to have an effect on our lives and
[2:51:24] that's a challenge after all these years
[2:51:26] in the message our behavior has to
[2:51:30] change because perfection is really
[2:51:33] about our behavior that's really what it
[2:51:36] is and God will find ways to test all of
[2:51:40] us all of us so you don't think I
[2:51:43] deserve my tests and trying to do timber
[2:51:44] over a versus a child and I use this
[2:51:46] some time ago I was preaching about
[2:51:48] overcoming and I said the Prophet under
[2:51:51] his experience through his trials came
[2:51:53] to the point he won to the comment
[2:51:55] suicide and if it wasn't for God jamming
[2:51:58] the guns is the jewel it would have been
[2:52:02] a different story today but God's
[2:52:05] purpose was beyond his own desire and
[2:52:07] his low point so we all have our low
[2:52:10] points we all have our up points we all
[2:52:12] have our victory and some of us
[2:52:14] everybody know we're in victory
[2:52:17] everybody knowing makes you anyway no
[2:52:19] engine you're shouting it jump in and
[2:52:21] when you're not ready nothing victory it
[2:52:24] is quietly is slipping it is slipping
[2:52:27] the church yes hi didn't buy them press
[2:52:30] him
[2:52:33] and your hot button is enough honest
[2:52:36] enough to say listen I'm in trouble and
[2:52:38] I need prayer because the whole point of
[2:52:42] coming to fellowship is to get strength
[2:52:44] from one another that bad is it
[2:52:46] encourage one another provoke one
[2:52:48] another confess your faults to one
[2:52:50] another or a descriptive went back to
[2:52:53] the Bible and back to the Bible is the
[2:52:56] journey to perfection
[2:53:00] there is no perfection outside no
[2:53:03] fulfillment of all the world even what
[2:53:05] we don't understand because my personal
[2:53:08] understanding is based on living what
[2:53:11] the Word says some of us our desires are
[2:53:14] corrupt and the devil is a great job of
[2:53:16] defining what our desires are and what
[2:53:20] our expectation of how God deals with
[2:53:22] situation even the Prophet that
[2:53:24] difference into every situations and
[2:53:26] healings one said Chico be sure
[2:53:28] than to identify what we say jump on a
[2:53:30] pulsar who is it tidy head with this and
[2:53:32] all kind of different things there's the
[2:53:34] one way one size with all this ultra
[2:53:36] deep blood and God we have to trust God
[2:53:39] that he gives us the wisdom to deal with
[2:53:41] the situations through perfection where
[2:53:45] there's all away and it's a perfect way
[2:53:46] and that's what we are striving for that
[2:53:50] way of perfection
[2:53:53] can the church say Amen so what do you
[2:53:56] preach them when you pick up a perfect
[2:53:58] you speaking about 11 feet I live in
[2:54:00] which you live in knowledge
[2:54:01] I live in temperance a little patience
[2:54:04] live in coldness a little crumbly
[2:54:05] kindness and charity itself to seal the
[2:54:08] whole thing so every step you make up
[2:54:12] and you go climb higher you getting
[2:54:14] closer that's like what a journey to
[2:54:16] perfection and we sing the song walking
[2:54:18] up seven steps to perfection receive the
[2:54:22] fullness of the Holy Ghost and people
[2:54:26] forget these some of the signature songs
[2:54:27] and recognizing it they miss any mark of
[2:54:29] what this thing is and as you go higher
[2:54:31] in these steps you're dying all to
[2:54:33] yourself
[2:54:36] but appearances you could have your own
[2:54:38] patients but the patient's of course the
[2:54:41] different regions you just naturally
[2:54:43] patient you there
[2:54:45] you just patient you supposed to be
[2:54:48] insurance for timber you patient you
[2:54:52] patiently waitin to get ready
[2:54:56] he did love me pp envisioned nine
[2:54:59] o'clock ten o'clock is still home your
[2:55:01] patient thanks boys visions
[2:55:07] some of our button is communication time
[2:55:15] I didn't write all you listen this
[2:55:16] wasn't my note sir in fact it really was
[2:55:19] going to hit this to cut buttoning here
[2:55:21] all right
[2:55:22] I have no list so I just say no need to
[2:55:24] put on my heart to see but are the
[2:55:26] energy they are know one thing that when
[2:55:29] we die out there should be no hot
[2:55:30] buttons Godman with the press and get no
[2:55:32] response no response no response no
[2:55:36] response no response and then when you
[2:55:40] can do that and then say fit and fit to
[2:55:42] respond virtue virtue good response come
[2:55:45] on somebody push back to me that being
[2:55:47] when he is complete is the pain that
[2:55:49] makes the rapture the reasonable
[2:55:54] coordinates you know in the school
[2:55:57] system if your door pass a certain green
[2:56:00] didn't make it repeat thanks of course
[2:56:03] is a visible because God has no
[2:56:06] grandchildren
[2:56:07] he has no shortcuts every son that
[2:56:10] comment to God must be tried so the
[2:56:14] pasta the LED country trust eater
[2:56:17] every man must be tried proven because
[2:56:21] power is coming and character must be
[2:56:24] there so the Prophet taught he could
[2:56:27] turn your wife against you he could turn
[2:56:29] your neighbors against you he could turn
[2:56:31] the church against you
[2:56:35] let's see how you will behave if you
[2:56:38] will have perfect poor fake love know
[2:56:43] how to put because some of us listen you
[2:56:44] made me see that I want that man telling
[2:56:46] us forgive who we want to forgive him we
[2:56:49] talk about forgiveness and may people it
[2:56:50] easy to forgive if if if but Anthony
[2:56:54] gave me upset but I think I have good
[2:56:57] friends I forgive him it easy to forgive
[2:57:00] him could I'm a friend but somebody's
[2:57:03] not number friend
[2:57:08] if it's my nature and this would give
[2:57:11] listing and when he would say
[2:57:14] forgiveness I forgive my brother 70
[2:57:16] times Levin but that one that's what
[2:57:21] needs to die because he'll like me I
[2:57:23] forgive him a with a grudge and
[2:57:26] forgiving
[2:57:27] that's why he backed over for different
[2:57:29] for Christ's sake that dies where it
[2:57:31] goes beyond your sake so I really go
[2:57:34] along to inside our house that our lives
[2:57:37] and I think I finished which you know
[2:57:39] it's not a conversation I like having a
[2:57:40] conversation like Jesus we just talk to
[2:57:42] the people because at the end of the day
[2:57:45] we have to reflect Jesus not our version
[2:57:49] of Jesus or the things about Jesus that
[2:57:51] we identify with but all of him they
[2:57:54] beat him and he said not a word Jesus
[2:57:57] responded he could have brought them
[2:57:58] guys out of existence because he was God
[2:58:01] in flesh but he was not a word because
[2:58:04] he saw his purpose and his purpose was a
[2:58:07] perfect purpose so he walked in
[2:58:08] perfection perfectly as a perfect lamb
[2:58:10] to Calvary
[2:58:13] he could have called angels he said it
[2:58:15] he could have called the angels and they
[2:58:18] would have come because he was the
[2:58:19] perfect lamb he was God and flesh but
[2:58:22] his purpose of perfection and what he
[2:58:24] was God he came to redeem was more
[2:58:26] important than vengeance or revenge or
[2:58:28] dealing with the people around him he
[2:58:30] had a perfect purpose I hope this helps
[2:58:36] somebody this morning know before you
[2:58:41] can lead you have to follow you kind of
[2:58:45] leave until you follow so we have
[2:58:48] sisters who saying I want Jesus and
[2:58:58] Jesus requires certain behavior from us
[2:59:01] and God give us husband's the test
[2:59:10] the images dry
[2:59:14] people trying to cover up the hot
[2:59:16] buttons they say if you only know your
[2:59:19] husband you wouldn't talk like this
[2:59:22] but it is to test us how could you
[2:59:26] submit to Christ and God say wives
[2:59:29] reverence your husband and that
[2:59:31] reverence is as your Lord Sarah called
[2:59:34] Abraham Lord I always joke about my wife
[2:59:37] call me Lord just smile
[2:59:50] seesee lit no back to anybody but I
[2:59:54] didn't say I read in Scripture no he had
[2:59:59] a quality scripture but how is our
[3:00:05] conduct because understand this and I
[3:00:08] said this in a service indigo Martin
[3:00:09] awhile ago and see if your neighbors
[3:00:12] don't know you're Christian there's
[3:00:13] something wrong with your testimony if
[3:00:17] your friends in school don't know you
[3:00:19] are Christian is something wrong with
[3:00:21] your testimony because the Bible said
[3:00:24] they took North that had been with Jesus
[3:00:25] oh there was evidence in their lives
[3:00:27] that they were like Jesus and if the
[3:00:30] reflection is the perfection omission
[3:00:33] people see you there must see Christ you
[3:00:36] must do one nervous cry so it's like up
[3:00:37] is like parts of crisis in parts of
[3:00:41] Christ where the mother part is a trough
[3:00:42] it has to be really nice to be authentic
[3:00:45] and you have to know where you are
[3:00:48] in this journey towards God in this
[3:00:50] journey towards perfection and then cry
[3:00:52] to God and go and help me show me I want
[3:00:55] to change I want to do it I want to I
[3:00:56] want to spend the time I wanna pray I
[3:00:58] wanna cry on the sacrifice help me give
[3:01:00] me I'll give me something
[3:01:04] we're looking for reality not semantics
[3:01:06] not just knowledge about the reality not
[3:01:09] knowledge and no if I have all knowledge
[3:01:11] and all mystery and I could prophesy
[3:01:13] they give more to be put and have not
[3:01:14] charity I am nothing
[3:01:16] god help us this morning I'm trying to
[3:01:21] find a place to close out here
[3:01:23] hallelujah the church will come to
[3:01:28] justification to loser to scientific
[3:01:30] Asian to esli to the baptism of the Holy
[3:01:33] Ghost and the Pentecostals and go right
[3:01:34] on into perfection of the son of man not
[3:01:38] a new church so this is our church it's
[3:01:40] one body it's one church it's one people
[3:01:44] it's one bride so there's no division
[3:01:49] with Isis man ministry and who you
[3:01:52] believe and who and who group and gonna
[3:01:55] talk in that talk that's man foolishness
[3:01:57] who you identified with I don't wanna
[3:02:00] bareback with nobody
[3:02:01] I want Christ when in fact with me
[3:02:04] because I would say T is my spirit
[3:02:06] flowing freely that's what God is
[3:02:08] looking for Minds identification is
[3:02:12] nothing because man will fail prophecies
[3:02:14] work me but charity and he is charity
[3:02:17] never fail
[3:02:21] [Applause]
[3:02:23] and that's what I'm looking for for
[3:02:26] cherry to have a perfect work in our
[3:02:28] lives come the church seamen in the
[3:02:33] message who is just majestic where the
[3:02:35] balance of the stages of the eternal
[3:02:37] purpose he had in his secret has now
[3:02:39] been revealed now we read the scripture
[3:02:41] where the Branham said door we know
[3:02:44] impact and prophesy imply but when that
[3:02:46] isn't perfect is coming babe and I took
[3:02:47] that and said when that which is perfect
[3:02:49] is made known so perfect is come is also
[3:02:54] perfect made known as a reveal to us so
[3:02:57] he said here in 65 and who is just my
[3:03:00] Keshi that the stages of the eternal
[3:03:02] purpose he had in his secret has now
[3:03:05] been revealed that he has three stages
[3:03:07] of perfection so perfectionism in known
[3:03:11] to us through three stages just like he
[3:03:14] redeems the world the same way he
[3:03:16] redeems his church he redeems two people
[3:03:19] in three stages
[3:03:20] now look first is justification like
[3:03:22] muta preached second sanctification like
[3:03:25] where is he preached the baptism of the
[3:03:27] holy ghost that's right then come to
[3:03:29] rapture
[3:03:32] now most people come to the SIF occasion
[3:03:36] most people walking on sand indication
[3:03:40] or have phone away is true whatever
[3:03:42] means through the washing of the world
[3:03:45] or true discipline or whatever it is
[3:03:47] they are living a sanctified life just
[3:03:49] as they did under under Wesley but God's
[3:03:52] great purpose was to put the Holy Ghost
[3:03:54] in us that he takes residence in the
[3:03:58] control tower that we actually have to
[3:04:00] give up control we have to lose control
[3:04:03] that he is in control that he know the
[3:04:06] wreck that we speak when he wants us to
[3:04:07] speak we call where he wants us to go we
[3:04:10] act the way he wants a snack can the
[3:04:12] church team and we can't wait to be the
[3:04:15] house of God because the control tower
[3:04:17] could only drive us to the word could he
[3:04:20] drive a simple feel the word could only
[3:04:22] drive us to manifest the word because
[3:04:24] the Holy Ghost is in the control tower
[3:04:30] hallelujah but the Branham emergently
[3:04:35] Force 1965 God is ready if he isn't
[3:04:39] doing it now he is going to call a
[3:04:42] church to perfection by his word Jesus
[3:04:45] Christ the musician get ready I'm almost
[3:04:47] finished now listen if God is calling
[3:04:50] his church to perfection by his word
[3:04:54] do you understand now why it's so
[3:04:57] important to make sure what is said in
[3:04:59] the pulpit is on the word
[3:05:03] that you have your home Paul give the
[3:05:06] early church homework he said follow me
[3:05:11] as I follow Christ and he gave them
[3:05:13] homework so hold me accountable as I
[3:05:18] follow Christ
[3:05:19] so only follow me as I follow Christ we
[3:05:22] have too much blind followers in the
[3:05:24] message people have put all the work on
[3:05:27] the pasta when Paul never did that he
[3:05:32] said follow me as I follow Christ so if
[3:05:33] you see me not following Christ run for
[3:05:36] your life
[3:05:37] pass the silly ones I built if you go
[3:05:40] somewhere else there is you only place
[3:05:41] it has no other place this is the one
[3:05:43] please people take the quote but abarim
[3:05:45] said they'll be chosen should his Brides
[3:05:46] by churches price and it must be worn as
[3:05:48] it is the one church that's not what I
[3:05:50] was talking about miss appropriate all
[3:05:54] kind of coats it's one body it's one
[3:05:57] bride it's a international bride people
[3:06:02] call from all kinds but a better even
[3:06:04] would interdenominational God is doing
[3:06:07] the calling he is sovereign some of us
[3:06:10] give us the permission we tell God no no
[3:06:11] no don't choose him
[3:06:13] don't choose who are she coming because
[3:06:15] suddenly we know how he cut his maid I
[3:06:17] thought easy cutter
[3:06:20] but his sovereign grace and mercy could
[3:06:22] call anybody he wants he can call the
[3:06:24] prostitute he could call the criminal he
[3:06:27] can call the Evangelist he's with
[3:06:28] anybody and put them into position put
[3:06:31] them into shape as the Potter cut what
[3:06:34] he doesn't want and what you see the
[3:06:35] masterpiece that the Potter pull
[3:06:40] the sin out of your life
[3:06:41] pull the evil out of your life if you
[3:06:43] give him the permission you call the
[3:06:45] enemy out of your life if you are lying
[3:06:47] I stand at the door knock If any man
[3:06:49] hope
[3:06:53] Oh hallelujah daven knew he can do it
[3:07:00] himself he said creates and me a clean
[3:07:01] heart O God renew a right spirit in me I
[3:07:04] can't renew myself but I know who can
[3:07:07] renew me so creating me a clean heart
[3:07:09] and renew a right spirit within me has
[3:07:13] been away from my presence O Lord take
[3:07:16] not thy Holy Spirit from me can the
[3:07:19] church say Amen hallelujah hallelujah
[3:07:25] hallelujah now listen when in our last
[3:07:32] quote notice here the light that was in
[3:07:34] the husk in this talk and the tassel in
[3:07:36] the husk all carries in the sea
[3:07:39] hallelujah and the light I was in his
[3:07:41] talk went one went to make the other
[3:07:43] justification made aware for scientific
[3:07:45] ation Sandinista made away for the
[3:07:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[3:07:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for
[3:07:52] the Holy Ghost itself that's the person
[3:07:55] of Jesus Christ the perfect God
[3:07:59] hallelujah not a measure
[3:08:02] but the Holy Ghost itself to come right
[3:08:05] down into perfection back to the word
[3:08:07] again to manifest itself Oh hallelujah
[3:08:11] what a joy to know that this is the
[3:08:13] season that we're in it couldn't happen
[3:08:15] in Luther's day it could not believe
[3:08:17] Wesley's day it couldn't happen in the
[3:08:19] Pentecostal state it couldn't even have
[3:08:20] remember the brand was here because he
[3:08:22] was a voice of this time pointing to the
[3:08:25] Sun pointed out Messiah is on the earth
[3:08:28] right now he said the same Holy Spirit
[3:08:31] was with the Lutheran's that sanctify
[3:08:33] the Wesleyan that baptized the penny
[3:08:35] causes is now setting in order for the
[3:08:37] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ that's a
[3:08:39] simile we said a manifestation of the
[3:08:42] Holy Ghost is that angel trying to
[3:08:44] gather people back to the word back to a
[3:08:46] perfect word back to perfection because
[3:08:49] once you get back to a perfect word
[3:08:51] it can only produce perfection and the
[3:08:53] church say man
[3:08:55] Oh hallelujah how many one a perfect
[3:08:59] Church where the passage is looking a
[3:09:02] perfect chiller to do that sin cannot
[3:09:04] stay in that church

[3:09:07] how they were in the Upper Room there
[3:09:09] was no doubt there was no unbelief they
[3:09:11] were in one mind they were in one Accord
[3:09:14] they had one expectation everything was

[3:09:26] filled with the Holy Ghost that's my

[3:09:35] gonna have any young people and decay
[3:09:37] labs on that Monday night and as the
[3:09:39] minister gets into the pulpit we could
