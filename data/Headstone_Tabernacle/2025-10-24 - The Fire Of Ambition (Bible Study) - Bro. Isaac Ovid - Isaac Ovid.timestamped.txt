[0:36] God bless you and good evening.
[0:40] Welcome to our Friday night Bible study.
[0:44] Um at this time, can we just bow our
[0:46] heads for a word of prayer?
[0:50] Oh gracious heavenly father, we thank
[0:52] you tonight that we could gather one
[0:54] more time in your presence, Lord, and
[0:56] this Friday evening, Father, to spend
[0:59] time around your word, Lord. And we
[1:00] pray, dear God, that you would bless
[1:02] each one that's here tonight, Father,
[1:05] those that are still on their way into
[1:06] the meeting, Lord. And we want to
[1:09] dedicate this evening to you, Lord. This
[1:12] little time of fellowship around your
[1:14] word where we are trusting you to speak
[1:16] to our hearts, Father. Lord, you know
[1:19] every need. You know every situation.
[1:21] You know every desire. Lord, you know
[1:24] what's affecting your people. Lord, you
[1:26] know, Lord, the challenges, the
[1:28] struggles, the opportunities, the
[1:30] victories, Lord, every single thing
[1:31] about us, Father. You are fully aware of
[1:34] it. So, we Lord are coming to you,
[1:36] Father, because we need more. We are not
[1:38] satisfied with Lord the life that we
[1:41] have because you have promised more to
[1:43] us and we are looking to you father Lord
[1:46] to your word that you could open our
[1:47] understanding to the scriptures and that
[1:49] you would speak to our hearts Lord in a
[1:51] way that Lord we may have never heard
[1:53] before so that we could be encouraged to
[1:55] press to stand Lord and we pray dear God
[1:58] that you would be with each one that's
[2:00] here Lord for those that are not well
[2:03] those that are Lord dealing with
[2:04] different situations we bring them to
[2:06] you tonight may you take me out of the
[2:08] way and may you speak lip to ear to your
[2:10] people. May you Lord anoint us Lord and
[2:13] may you bless each one tonight. We
[2:14] commit the Bible study into your hands
[2:17] in the precious name of Jesus Christ.
[2:18] Amen and amen and amen. Well, it's
[2:22] certainly a great privilege and an honor
[2:24] to be here tonight one more time for our
[2:27] Bible study. We take this opportunity to
[2:29] welcome [clears throat] one and all by
[2:32] the grace of God. and for the few
[2:34] moments that we will be together, we
[2:36] want to be able to dedicate it to the
[2:38] Lord. So, I encourage you uh wherever
[2:41] you're at to um get get ready for the
[2:45] next hour or so to spend some time um
[2:48] around God's word, looking to hear
[2:50] something to inspire us. I don't know
[2:52] how many of you felt it, but there was
[2:54] an earthquake just a few minutes ago.
[2:57] And um anytime there's an earthquake,
[3:00] it's a little reminder of this fragile
[3:04] world that we are in. And the Bible says
[3:06] heaven and earth will pass away. But
[3:09] God's word is what is constant. It will
[3:11] never pass away. So God has his subtle
[3:14] ways of snapping us into reality. And
[3:17] sometimes we think certain things are
[3:19] important or very important and then our
[3:22] reality gets shifted and something
[3:25] transpires that causes us to pause to
[3:29] reflect and to stop you. So we pray that
[3:31] this evening um those that are here that
[3:34] you would be dedicated to the cause of
[3:36] the gospel and um encourage someone to
[3:38] join the meeting as well because I
[3:39] believe something will be said this
[3:41] evening to bless us in a special way by
[3:44] the grace of God. I also want to
[3:45] encourage you to remember one another in
[3:47] prayer. Remember our pastor in prayer,
[3:50] all of the ministers, uh the church,
[3:52] those that are sick, those that are
[3:54] afflicted, those that are dealing with
[3:55] different challenges. If there ever was
[3:56] a time we needed God, it's now. So, by
[4:00] the grace of God, I have a thought
[4:01] tonight that I want to speak on for a
[4:04] few minutes just to kind of inspire us a
[4:06] bit and for us to see something in
[4:07] scripture. And the thought for tonight
[4:10] is the fire of ambition. the fire of
[4:14] ambition, you know, and uh a few weeks
[4:16] ago I had the opportunity of being in
[4:18] Uganda and the opening service of the
[4:22] meeting, the minister preached a message
[4:25] called enemies of your ambition.
[4:29] uh and I felt it was such a powerful
[4:31] thought and in there he read a quote
[4:35] from God's prophet and I would have
[4:38] shared this quote with our deacons and
[4:40] officers and it's a quote where brother
[4:42] Brandham would have said in the message
[4:44] as the eagle stir it up a nest just to
[4:46] give a context before we get deeper into
[4:48] the study and brother Brandham said when
[4:50] I hear of a church that hasn't got any
[4:53] ambition to grow there's something wrong
[4:56] with that church the church of the
[4:58] living God has a high ambition. And and
[5:01] we're going to spend some time talking
[5:03] about this word ambition this evening,
[5:05] but here's a direct statement. The
[5:07] church of the living God has a high
[5:08] ambition. And another thing, the church
[5:11] of the living God is built high because
[5:13] it's got high anticipations and
[5:15] expectations. Say, well, we belong to
[5:18] that church. Our father served in this
[5:19] church years ago. That might be fine.
[5:21] But the church of the living God can set
[5:24] still its ambitions is to go higher
[5:28] farther. And that was preached in 1957.
[5:32] Just about a year later
[5:35] in 1958 in a similar message as the
[5:38] eagle s her nest and flutter it over her
[5:40] young. Brother Brandham said, "Last
[5:41] summer I was going to Tacoma for a
[5:43] meeting. I passed through Yellowstone
[5:46] watching way up in the top of the
[5:48] canyon. I saw something up there and it
[5:50] was right on a little short peak and an
[5:53] eagle had her nest built and I called my
[5:56] wife and my children and give them the
[5:57] binoculars. I had went down into the
[5:59] woods of peace following a little old
[6:02] bear and I said, "Look up here now at
[6:04] this. There's an eagle with her nest.
[6:06] What can get to her? Nothing. No serpent
[6:10] can crawl up that rock. No coyote could
[6:12] ever destroy that nest." And that's the
[6:15] way God builds his church for his
[6:17] eagles. high above the ambitions of the
[6:20] world. She's got a high ambition, not to
[6:24] please men, but to please God. She's
[6:27] built high and safe. So, that is a bit
[6:30] of the background for our thought
[6:32] tonight, the fire of ambition. And we're
[6:33] going to touch on a few scriptures and a
[6:35] few thoughts because we are encouraged
[6:38] to have a high ambition. Now in 2
[6:42] Corinthians 5 and verse 9 in the
[6:45] amplified
[6:47] Paul says it is our constant ambition to
[6:52] be pleasing to him. It is our constant
[6:55] ambition to be pleasing to him. And
[6:58] ambition is a powerful word. You know go
[7:00] going to school and you have your school
[7:02] teacher will say well this person is
[7:04] ambitious and you have to have ambition.
[7:05] You want to you should want to be
[7:07] somebody. You should want to achieve
[7:09] something. And this word ambition
[7:12] has a few meanings, but it it really
[7:15] speaks of a desire for advancement.
[7:18] And one definition is a strong desire to
[7:22] achieve something, typically requiring
[7:25] determination and hard work. Another way
[7:28] to look at it is the drive or motivation
[7:32] to accomplish purpose or attain
[7:35] excellence. So you see people saying,
[7:38] "Hey, that man have no ambition, boy."
[7:40] Or, "That woman has incredible
[7:42] ambition." And in and of itself,
[7:45] ambition as a word, there's nothing
[7:47] wrong with ambition. Because we see
[7:49] God's prophet speaking about wanting a
[7:52] high ambition. And we hear Paul
[7:54] expressing it. It is our constant
[7:56] ambition to be pleasing to him. Now,
[8:02] every some people call it drive, some
[8:05] people call it hunger. We're going to
[8:07] keep referencing it as the word ambition
[8:09] this evening. And it is that fire in you
[8:13] that refuses to settle for less
[8:18] than what God has imagined for your
[8:20] life. It is something that says I cannot
[8:23] stay here.
[8:25] Just yesterday I was having a
[8:27] conversation and with someone saying you
[8:29] know the moment you stop learning is the
[8:32] moment you stop growing and the moment
[8:35] you get satisfied with where you are at
[8:36] there's something wrong with the picture
[8:39] because the very word ambition actually
[8:41] started with God. Ambition speaks of a
[8:44] desire to achieve something desire to
[8:47] make something real a desire to express
[8:49] something. So the fact that God would
[8:52] say let there be light and and the Lord
[8:55] begin to create and the entire display
[8:58] of what took place in Genesis and even
[9:01] when God created angels and what we saw
[9:04] was God's desire his ambition his goal
[9:07] his what he wanted to express what he
[9:09] wanted to see happen what he himself
[9:12] wanted to achieve. So when we look at
[9:15] the ambitions and the expression of
[9:17] ambitions, it actually comes from God
[9:21] because it is a reflection of something
[9:24] that is creative. So creativity is
[9:28] something that comes from God. So I'm
[9:29] I'm building in a few things here,
[9:31] right? But this thought that we cannot
[9:35] stay where we at, we should be desiring
[9:37] more. We should be seeking to be more.
[9:40] we should be seeking to be better is
[9:42] reflected all through scripture. We see
[9:44] God saying to Abraham, "Seek a city
[9:46] whose builder and maker is God." Which
[9:48] means the city you're in is not it. You
[9:50] need to look for something higher. The
[9:52] Bible will say, "Add to your faith
[9:54] virtue unto virtue knowledge all the
[9:55] way." So, so everything speaks of if you
[9:58] don't have an ambition or a desire to
[10:02] achieve something more than you have
[10:04] now, there might be something you need
[10:07] to look at in your life because
[10:09] everything about God is about
[10:11] completeness and perfection and bringing
[10:14] things into a state that he could say it
[10:16] is good, it is good, it is good, it is
[10:18] good. And as we said in our last Bible
[10:20] study, God was repeating the statement
[10:23] every day of creation. It is good. It is
[10:24] good. It is good. And even when the
[10:26] picture was done and he rested, he
[10:29] looked at his creation. He looked at man
[10:31] and said, "It is not good for him to be
[10:33] alone. My ambition is to now fix that."
[10:36] And God gave that man a wife because he
[10:39] had an ambition to see that man have
[10:42] fellowship. So this teaching tonight,
[10:45] the fire of ambition is for us to relook
[10:49] at not just our spiritual ambition but
[10:53] our natural ambition. It is looking at
[10:56] the expression of all that God wants for
[10:59] us. It is God's desire and we read it in
[11:02] scripture for he had given us all things
[11:04] pertaining to both life and godliness.
[11:07] So it is God's desire and when we look
[11:10] into the very expression of these
[11:13] things, your ambition, your desire to
[11:17] achieve your desire to and and and and
[11:20] we ought to have an ambition to be
[11:21] healed. We ought to have an ambition to
[11:23] live a sanctified life. It if it is not
[11:26] a goal, if it's not a desire, you could
[11:28] never put things in place. You must have
[11:30] the ambition to have a prayer life. You
[11:32] must have the ambition to be the best in
[11:36] what you do. You must have the ambition
[11:38] if you're a husband to be the best
[11:41] husband that you could be. That speaks
[11:43] to ambition. If you do not have an
[11:46] ambition, a desire, something to
[11:48] motivate you, a fire in you, then you
[11:51] will be in the same position that you
[11:54] have been for many years. And this is
[11:55] the the challenge we have today. We
[11:58] could look at people and I sure you know
[12:00] someone who when you look at them, you
[12:02] realize they have made no progress in
[12:04] their life. They have made no progress
[12:06] spiritually. They have made no progress
[12:08] naturally. All they have done is really
[12:11] gotten older. So ambition propels you to
[12:14] seek, to search, to ask questions, to
[12:17] find yourself in the right rooms because
[12:20] you are the average of the people around
[12:22] you. I was saying to someone yesterday
[12:24] that if you are the smartest person in
[12:26] your room, you need to change the room
[12:28] you're in because you cannot grow if you
[12:31] have don't have people around you who
[12:33] will challenge you, who will push you to
[12:35] be more than you were yesterday. But if
[12:38] you don't have the ambition to want more
[12:40] than you had yesterday, there'll be
[12:42] nothing to drive you to ask the
[12:45] questions, what else is there? So
[12:48] ambition, it was ambition that was in
[12:51] Caleb and Joshua that says we are more
[12:53] than able. Their ambition was to take
[12:56] the land. They their ambition was in
[12:59] alignment with God's ambition because
[13:00] God's ambition and his desire was for
[13:03] them to possess the land. 12 men went to
[13:07] spy out the land. Only two men made
[13:10] God's ambition their ambition and they
[13:13] said we are more than able. So when your
[13:16] ambition is in alignment with God's
[13:18] ambition, what begins to happen is your
[13:21] ambition becomes bigger than your
[13:23] problems, bigger than your fears, bigger
[13:26] than the issues in your life. Because
[13:29] 99% of the times or more, you are the
[13:32] person holding yourself back. We blame
[13:34] the devil for things the devil not even
[13:36] doing. So when it speaks about ambition,
[13:39] we have people in this room and I hope
[13:41] we do who are in school. What is your
[13:44] ambition? Ambition speaks to not just
[13:47] the motivation but to the why, the
[13:50] purpose, the intent, the desire. What
[13:53] good is it to spend time and resources
[13:55] going to school and then you so caught
[13:57] up in trying to be popular or trying to
[14:00] fit in or trying to be with the crowd or
[14:02] trying to be accepted and all these
[14:03] things that at the end of the day you
[14:06] don't have the fruit or the product or
[14:08] the result of why you went to school.
[14:11] What good is it to be in a job and you
[14:14] have no ambition to get promoted? You
[14:17] have no ambition to expand your
[14:19] territory. The Bible says expand your
[14:21] tent. Spread your borders. There's you
[14:24] when God spoke to Abraham when Lot went
[14:27] away, he said look to the east, look to
[14:29] the west, look to the north, to the
[14:30] south. All is yours. When God spoke to
[14:32] them to go to the land, he said this
[14:34] land is yours. This land is yours. This
[14:36] land is yours. You have to have ambition
[14:38] because every place you put your foot is
[14:41] yours. If you don't have the ambition to
[14:44] get up every day and fight for it, it's
[14:47] not coming to you automatically. I want
[14:48] us to appreciate that we look to God to
[14:51] bless and to to do it. And God is
[14:54] obligated to do that. But his ambition
[14:57] must become our ambition.
[15:00] So looking at Eden, the picture of Eden,
[15:03] God said have dominion. So God's picture
[15:07] of man in position in Eden was a man in
[15:10] dominion.
[15:13] It meant that Adam had to have the
[15:15] ambition to align with God's ambition.
[15:18] What if Adam every day got up and we we
[15:21] know before the fall he was supposed to
[15:22] name the animals. You say you know what
[15:23] I'm not feeling motivated to name any
[15:25] animals today.
[15:28] That picture would not have been the
[15:30] right picture. So again we're talking
[15:32] about alignment of vision. All right.
[15:36] Now, ambition could be bad because in
[15:40] our service two Sundays ago, I was
[15:43] speaking about ambition and I said, and
[15:44] I have it in my notes, maybe I'll get to
[15:46] it, that the devil is one of the most
[15:49] ambitious beings that ever exists. He
[15:52] said, "I will be like the most high."
[15:57] Brother speaks of the devil's ambition.
[15:59] So, Satan himself is ambitious.
[16:02] The five I wills was the one of the most
[16:06] interesting displays of ambition that
[16:09] exists. So what we realize is this
[16:11] conversation of ambition is actually a
[16:14] heavenly picture that is on the earth
[16:17] because God has an ambition and the
[16:20] devil has an ambition. God has a picture
[16:22] of what he wants to see and Satan also
[16:25] has a picture of what he wants to see.
[16:29] So the question now shifts to not just
[16:33] do you have an ambition because I don't
[16:35] want to believe that we are in this room
[16:38] without hopes and without dreams and
[16:40] things we want to achieve and things we
[16:42] want to see happen. The real question
[16:44] becomes who is shaping our ambition who
[16:47] is guiding our ambition and who gets the
[16:50] glory from our ambition. We would
[16:53] remember that when Satan went to Eve, he
[16:55] said, "If you eat the fruit, you will be
[16:58] like God."
[17:00] So, he was positioning almost a picture
[17:03] of what she could become and presenting
[17:06] an alternate pathway to fully express
[17:09] what her potential was. I hope everyone
[17:11] is catching this. So, let's go a little
[17:14] deeper. In Genesis 1:26, God says, "Let
[17:18] us make man in our image, after our
[17:21] likeness, and let them have dominion."
[17:25] So here we see Almighty God has an
[17:28] ambition to make man in image and
[17:31] likeness, look like him, walk like him,
[17:34] talk like him, express like him. So in
[17:37] other words, God's expression of his
[17:40] ambition became what man's ambition
[17:43] should have been. The very thing about
[17:46] going back to Eden and having dominion
[17:48] is actually what we could call divine
[17:51] ambition. It was like if God saying I
[17:54] want my creation to actually carry what
[17:57] I want to see because man was supposed
[17:59] to be made in both the image and the
[18:01] likeness of God, the nature of God, the
[18:04] behavior of God, the attitude of God,
[18:07] the desire to build, to improve. So you
[18:09] see repeated themes in scripture be
[18:12] fruitful and multiply. There is nothing
[18:14] in scripture that speaks about being
[18:16] less than you were yesterday. And this
[18:18] is why I encourage when God put man to
[18:21] work, the root word of work and the root
[18:24] word of worship is the same thing.
[18:26] Worship and work and expression is is
[18:29] God himself living his way out.
[18:33] So at the very purest level, ambition
[18:36] comes from God. Abraham was given a
[18:39] purpose. Leave your family. In other
[18:41] words, you had to want more or be
[18:45] attracted to more to get out of your
[18:48] condition to follow. So, Abraham would
[18:50] have seen something and it had to become
[18:52] his desire.
[18:55] There's a tragedy in today's world where
[18:57] you have to motivate people to go to
[18:58] school and motivate people to go to work
[19:00] and motivate people to improve. It
[19:03] should come from within to be the very
[19:05] best version of what you could be.
[19:09] When heaven fuels your ambition,
[19:13] there is no issue about failure. There's
[19:16] no issue about wondering what if or how.
[19:19] You realize that God is pushing you to
[19:22] be a light in this hour. So there's
[19:26] natural ambition. There's also spiritual
[19:29] ambition.
[19:31] Let's take some references in scripture.
[19:34] The tower of Babel in Genesis 11. We saw
[19:39] what natural ambition could do.
[19:43] This was not divinely inspired but
[19:46] something in these people Nimrod and his
[19:48] board of directors decided to say you
[19:51] know what we will build a tower to reach
[19:54] heaven.
[19:56] So there are two things there. Many
[19:57] times when we look at the story of
[19:59] Nimrod, we look at the unity aspect
[20:02] because God says because they were
[20:04] united, he had to intervene. But before
[20:08] it was a unity, the desire was there.
[20:10] Let us do this thing and it spoke to the
[20:13] ambition to realize, wait a minute, we
[20:15] are here and we want to get up there.
[20:18] something was driving them and they were
[20:20] able to capture that ambition. Unite the
[20:24] people into this ambition brought such a
[20:26] unity that God himself said if he
[20:29] doesn't stop it the unity around this
[20:32] ambition would achieve the purpose that
[20:34] they wanted to achieve. So I want us to
[20:37] appreciate that when you have singleness
[20:40] of focus towards what you want to
[20:43] achieve and it is an alignment with God
[20:46] there's nothing could stop you because
[20:48] we could see here with Nimrod if God did
[20:50] not intervene in scripture he said they
[20:52] would have achieved it and I want us to
[20:54] pause there for a minute in other words
[20:56] if God did not stop them they would have
[20:59] achieved what they set out to achieve
[21:02] that's how powerful and this was fallen
[21:05] man, fallen man in a broken condition
[21:10] taking ambition plus unity and God said
[21:14] if I don't stop the combination of
[21:17] ambition and unity they will achieve
[21:20] whatever they want to achieve. What
[21:22] happens when a husband and wife share
[21:25] the ambition and they are united in
[21:27] achieving that ambition for themselves,
[21:30] for their family, for their home. So
[21:32] when the Bible will say as for me and my
[21:35] house we will serve the Lord. Your
[21:38] ambition is to serve the Lord and
[21:40] there's a unity in as for me and my
[21:42] house we are working together with the
[21:45] same ambition with the same goal with
[21:47] the same focus. There is nothing that
[21:49] exists that could stop it. If there is a
[21:52] singleness of ambition and a unity
[21:54] towards this I trust this is helping
[21:56] someone this evening.
[22:00] ambition. We're building.
[22:03] David had ambition.
[22:08] David looked
[22:10] at how he was living and he said, "Why
[22:14] doesn't God have a house?" Because the
[22:16] house I'm in is better than the one God
[22:18] is in on the earth.
[22:22] He had a desire, as we know, to build
[22:25] the temple.
[22:27] And God said, "There's too much blood on
[22:29] your hands.
[22:31] Your son will build it." But yet still,
[22:34] David did everything in his power and
[22:37] gathered the resources
[22:40] so that his son would have the resources
[22:42] to build the temple. Speaking about
[22:45] ambition and the right type of ambition,
[22:50] we could jump to the New Testament. The
[22:52] sons of Zebedee in Mark 10
[22:56] wanted to know who will sit on they
[22:58] wanted to sit on Jesus right hand and
[23:00] left hand and Jesus had to redirect the
[23:04] ambition to say whoever is great among
[23:07] you shall be your servant. So again
[23:11] we're talking about ambition chneled in
[23:13] the right way. We're talking about you
[23:16] must have a desire to achieve something.
[23:18] It is it is part of the DNA of God. So
[23:22] if you are a son of God, if you are a
[23:24] daughter of God, if you are in that
[23:25] channel of God, it must be your nature
[23:28] to climb the pyramid. It must be your
[23:30] nature to want to achieve more. It must
[23:33] be your nature to have a better prayer
[23:35] life. It could never be a nature of
[23:37] sitting down saying, "I have arrived. I
[23:40] have achieved." That does not exist.
[23:42] Paul in Romans 15:20 in the amplified
[23:46] says, "It has always been my ambition to
[23:50] preach the gospel
[23:52] where Christ was not yet known." So we
[23:56] are building right. God's ambition could
[24:00] be described as holy desire.
[24:06] God in creation let us make man in our
[24:09] image. That is ambition expressed. When
[24:12] God changed form and became flesh, that
[24:14] was ambition [clears throat] expressed.
[24:16] When we look at again, I'm repeating
[24:18] some things just to make sure we catch
[24:20] it as well.
[24:22] Isaiah 14, the contrast with Lucifer,
[24:26] for thou has said in thine heart, I will
[24:28] ascend into heaven. I will exalt my
[24:31] throne above the stars of God. I will be
[24:33] like the most high. What we call the
[24:35] five eye wills
[24:38] was the contrast
[24:41] of the ambition of God. It is the
[24:44] devil's ambition. So every single person
[24:46] on the earth right now is being guided
[24:47] by ambition. We could call it
[24:49] influences. We could call it voices. We
[24:52] speak about last in the last Bible
[24:54] study. Who are the people in your life?
[24:56] Because people speak things into your
[24:58] life that puts you either into the path
[25:00] or the will of God or into the path or
[25:02] the will of what the enemy wants. And it
[25:04] might seem very simple but the problems
[25:07] we have and if you really check out what
[25:10] is our ambition to what we do and why we
[25:13] do it and what we try to achieve. So
[25:16] we're building. So ambition
[25:17] [clears throat] did not originate on
[25:19] earth. It originated in eternity. And
[25:22] that is why your ambition carries
[25:26] eternal consequences.
[25:29] And I've said to many young people, you
[25:31] could have an ambition to have a nice
[25:33] car, a nice house, but if that ambition
[25:37] takes you to a job or an opportunity
[25:39] that takes you away from God, there's an
[25:41] eternal consequence.
[25:46] Your ambition to be successful in and of
[25:49] itself is not the issue.
[25:52] But if that ambition is not guided, if
[25:55] that ambition is not managed, if that
[25:57] ambition is not filtered, if that
[26:00] ambition doesn't come with counsel, then
[26:02] therein lies the problem. God wants you
[26:05] to be blessed. And you could see someone
[26:07] blessed, look at someone blessed and
[26:09] say, "I want that." But because you go
[26:10] about it the wrong way, the ambition
[26:13] itself is not the issue, but the way you
[26:15] go about it is the problem. Anybody with
[26:18] me this evening?
[26:20] So we're talking about the very
[26:22] expression of God's ambition because God
[26:25] as we know want to be a healer, want to
[26:27] be a redeemer, want to be a savior, want
[26:29] to be a healer, want to be a lord, want
[26:31] to be a protector. All of that is the
[26:33] ambition of God. So everyone that walks
[26:36] the earth under the hand of God. So we
[26:40] have said before when God wanted to be a
[26:42] shepherd, David represented the aspect
[26:46] of God that was shepherd. We could also
[26:48] say David was the expression of God's
[26:52] ambition as a shepherd because before
[26:54] Christ was made manifest, every prophet,
[26:58] every messenger, every king, every
[27:00] priest who played a part in it was
[27:03] actually the physical reflection of
[27:05] God's ambition. When God say I want to
[27:08] be a prophet Elijah, I want to be a
[27:10] warrior Joshua. I want to be a shepherd
[27:13] David. Each one a piece of the
[27:15] expression of God. And when Christ came,
[27:18] he was the fullness of the expression of
[27:20] God. All that was in God was poured into
[27:22] Christ. The fullness of God's ambition
[27:25] was in Christ. So we could say that when
[27:28] David walked the earth, not just as a
[27:30] shepherd, but when David was approaching
[27:33] Goliath, God's ambition wrapped in faith
[27:37] would ask the question, who is this
[27:38] uncircumcised for this time that would
[27:41] defy the army of the living God? So
[27:43] David began to express the ambition of
[27:46] God. Anybody with me this evening?
[27:50] Express the ambition of God. And David's
[27:53] ambition was not for popularity.
[27:56] David didn't say I am the man. He asked
[27:58] the question, who is this uncircumcised
[28:01] Philistine? Because he had a revelation
[28:04] of what God's ambition was for his
[28:06] people.
[28:08] So his approach of the lie was not to do
[28:10] with him as a person, but the question
[28:12] he asked was, "Who is this uncircumcised
[28:14] Philistine that dare defy the army of
[28:17] the living God?" He wasn't frightened to
[28:19] prove himself, but to speak for God, to
[28:22] fight for God. Anybody with me this
[28:24] evening?
[28:26] We're still on David. David's ambition.
[28:31] Psalms 27:4, "One thing have I desired."
[28:35] Because desire is ambition, right? One
[28:37] thing have I desired of the Lord, that
[28:39] will I seek after that I may dwell in
[28:43] the house of the Lord all the days of my
[28:45] life. So this is a man expressing
[28:49] ambition. David is saying as the heart
[28:52] panted after the waterbrook so my soul
[28:54] thirst after thee.
[28:56] That is his ambition.
[28:59] The Bible say as many as hunger and
[29:01] thirst after righteousness. Blessed are
[29:03] they that hunger and thirst after
[29:04] righteous poor. They shall be filled. If
[29:06] your ambition, if your desire is not for
[29:09] righteousness, then there's no failing
[29:11] to come. What is your ambition?
[29:22] Building a little bit here.
[29:29] Just want to skip a few things.
[29:34] Peter had an an ambition before he went
[29:38] to Pentecost. On the day of Pentecost in
[29:40] Matthew 26:33, he said, "Though all men
[29:44] shall be offended because of thee, yet
[29:45] will I never be offended." That was a
[29:48] that was a good ambition
[29:50] until he get cornered and until he
[29:54] realized that his ambition didn't have
[29:57] the power to sustain the ambition.
[29:59] Anybody with me? Because after that, he
[30:02] would deny Christ. Right? So what we are
[30:05] painting a picture of is reaching a
[30:07] point in our lives friends where our
[30:09] ambition becomes godly ambition.
[30:16] Let's talk about Paul. Paul was very
[30:18] ambitious before God touched him. He was
[30:21] ambitious persecuting the church.
[30:25] So now we are seeing a picture of people
[30:27] who having the wrong ambition.
[30:32] Paul is persecuting the Christians in
[30:35] Acts nine. Paul and Saul yet breathing
[30:38] out threatenings and slaughter against
[30:40] the disciples of the Lord until God
[30:42] arrested him and take that same passion
[30:45] because at the end of the day we have
[30:46] people who are passionate about things.
[30:49] He was fervent. You can see Paul in his
[30:52] whole approach from before his
[30:53] conversion to after his conversion he
[30:56] was a passionate man. But before his
[30:58] conversion, he was passionate about the
[31:00] wrong things until God had to interrupt
[31:03] his life, change his passion and his
[31:06] ambition and his focus to become the
[31:09] foundational messenger of the church
[31:11] ages. Anybody with me this evening?
[31:15] And we said this straight before Romans
[31:17] 15 20. It has always been my ambition to
[31:20] preach the gospel where Christ
[31:24] was not yet known.
[31:29] ambition without wisdom is like
[31:31] wildfire.
[31:34] Ambition without
[31:37] counsel will get you into problems. But
[31:40] if your ambition could be guided, then
[31:43] God could do something. This is a
[31:45] scripture we read in the last Bible
[31:46] study, and I think it's worth repeating.
[31:49] Without counsel, purposes are
[31:52] disappointed.
[31:53] But in the multitude of counselors there
[31:56] are they are established
[31:59] or in other words there is safety in
[32:01] counsel.
[32:02] It's worth repeating because many of us
[32:05] we have desires we have goals. We have
[32:06] objectives and we don't seek advice. We
[32:08] don't seek wisdom. We don't seek input
[32:12] from others. And I'm going to get to a
[32:14] point in that in a bit. Last Bible said
[32:16] we touch how Moses father-in-law
[32:20] looked at him and said, "Hey, I see
[32:22] ambition. You know, I see what you're
[32:23] trying to do." In in Exodus, the thing
[32:26] that thou doest is not good. Thou will
[32:28] surely wear away. Because here it was,
[32:31] we position it last study was Moses was
[32:35] doing everything, not asking for help,
[32:37] not seeking help. He was meeting with
[32:40] all the people. He was wearing himself
[32:41] down and he was being ineffective to the
[32:43] people. We position it last meeting as
[32:46] who are the people in your life? His
[32:48] father-in-law was the one who was able
[32:50] to cut through to him and say Moses
[32:51] there has to be a better way. But what
[32:54] we also see is Moses ambition
[32:57] was too much for him and he did not
[33:00] realize he needed help to even express
[33:02] his ambition because he wanted to be a
[33:04] blessing
[33:06] but he didn't understand how to channel
[33:09] that in the right way. Anybody with me?
[33:12] So his ambition needed guidance. Here he
[33:15] is. God is speaking to him. God is
[33:17] dealing with him. He's the one
[33:19] responsible.
[33:21] But he needed help. This is an
[33:23] interesting one. Rehobam, which is
[33:25] Solomon's son.
[33:29] He forsook in this is first kings 12:8.
[33:32] He forsook the council of the old men
[33:35] which they had given him and consulted
[33:38] with the young men that were grown up
[33:40] with him. That's a powerful one.
[33:46] This is a powerful one because many
[33:48] times young people feel the old ones
[33:49] don't know anything
[33:52] and all the new things that exist now
[33:55] they have a better understanding. But
[33:56] here is a big lesson in the role of the
[33:59] elders
[34:00] in guiding goals in guiding objectives
[34:03] in guiding strategy because this issue
[34:07] here is what led to the split of the
[34:09] kingdom
[34:10] into the north and the south into Israel
[34:12] and Judah with the administration of the
[34:15] taxes. But here it is God is saying he
[34:17] forsook or walked away or abandoned the
[34:21] council of the old men which they had
[34:24] given him. In other words, the elders
[34:26] had given him good advice,
[34:29] but he chose to consult with the young
[34:31] men that grew up with him. How many
[34:33] times we have young people who are given
[34:35] advice
[34:37] from elders and their perception is well
[34:40] you don't know what we going through. We
[34:41] have a better understanding. We are in
[34:44] the situation and they end up into
[34:46] problems.
[34:48] So ambition so again you want to open a
[34:51] business, you want to change your
[34:52] career. I've seen people make terrible
[34:55] career decisions, terrible decisions,
[34:57] financial decisions. Terrible. And it's
[34:59] driven by ambition. Why did it? Well, I
[35:01] wanted a better job. I wanted a better
[35:03] place. I wanted a better. But did you
[35:04] seek advice? Did you get counsel? Did
[35:06] you speak to anybody? Did you consult a
[35:08] professional?
[35:09] Because if you are not an expert, I was
[35:11] sharing with some of the young people
[35:13] recently, I am not a professional hiker.
[35:16] There are things I am exceptional at.
[35:18] Hiking is not one of them.
[35:20] So if we are going on a hike, I am not
[35:23] the one to lead the hike. The last hike
[35:26] I went on was quite an experience. I am
[35:29] not the one you want in front.
[35:32] I cannot be embarrassed to say that it
[35:35] is not my area of expertise.
[35:37] So if it is not my area of strength,
[35:40] wisdom, if I want to go on a hike and my
[35:42] ambition is to go on a hike, I want to
[35:45] get a tour guide. I want to get a hiking
[35:47] expert. I want to get someone to take me
[35:48] the right way. And more importantly, if
[35:50] I cannot make it, they must know how to
[35:52] get me out.
[35:54] Why do we believe that we could tackle
[35:57] life alone? There are times you have to
[35:58] stand alone. But when you have people
[36:00] around you or access to people or you
[36:03] have the ability to ask the right
[36:05] questions, why suffer in silence? And it
[36:08] goes, it connects straight back to our
[36:10] Bible study last study. Who are the
[36:13] people in your life? Because the issue
[36:16] is not having ambition. The issue is not
[36:18] one. The issue is not I want better for
[36:20] myself and I want to achieve this and
[36:22] but is there a better way to achieve it?
[36:24] Is there a right way to do it? Is there
[36:26] a way that God will bless and honor and
[36:29] open up or you could go and fight up and
[36:31] and but the so much pain and frustration
[36:34] and struggle you realize you limit what
[36:38] you could achieve.
[36:40] I trust this is helping someone this
[36:41] evening.
[36:45] ambition, different perspectives of it.
[36:48] Let's look at Joseph for a few minutes.
[36:55] Genesis 37:9. And he dreamed yet another
[36:57] dream, and told it his brethren, and
[37:00] said, "Behold, the sun and the moon and
[37:03] the 11 stars made obedience to me."
[37:08] Now,
[37:10] Joseph without question may have had a
[37:13] partial understanding of what was
[37:15] happening because he know he is the
[37:17] subject of the thing. But the reality is
[37:20] and there's something that
[37:23] people put as memes sometimes, you know,
[37:25] move in silence.
[37:27] Joseph speaking to his destiny put him
[37:30] into problems. In other words, there are
[37:33] times when what you want to achieve, you
[37:36] need to know who to say it to. You need
[37:39] who to tell because sometimes the people
[37:40] who you think rejoicing with you really
[37:43] want to see a destruction because the
[37:45] same ones, these were his brothers.
[37:46] These were not the neighbors. These were
[37:48] not his school friends. His own brothers
[37:50] are the ones who threw him into the pit.
[37:54] So there has to be a wisdom in what we
[37:57] speak. Not everything you want to
[37:58] express, not everything you want to say.
[38:00] And this is why we take things to the
[38:02] Lord in prayer. And we want to ensure
[38:05] our ambition is in God's alignment. We
[38:07] want to ensure there's a right timing.
[38:09] We want to seek the right advice, the
[38:11] right counsel because this is the key to
[38:14] us becoming mature and seasoned. You
[38:15] can't just say what come to your mind.
[38:17] You can't just talk the first thing that
[38:19] that you want to express. Lord, is this
[38:21] for me? Is this right now? Is this what
[38:23] move should I take? Who should I speak
[38:25] to? And then your way who you speak to.
[38:27] Is it someone who is has experience in
[38:29] the matter?
[38:31] There's no question that Joseph's dream
[38:33] was right.
[38:36] But his approach to expressing it
[38:38] actually put him into problems.
[38:42] Anybody with me?
[38:45] Ambition, desire, achievement, what
[38:48] propels you? A similar example,
[38:51] Neahhemiah in wanting to rebuild the
[38:53] wall. We have done a number of studies
[38:54] on Neahhemiah. In Nehemiah 2:12, it
[38:58] says, "Neither told I any man what my
[39:02] God had put in my heart to do at
[39:04] Jerusalem.
[39:06] He had a desire to fix and to repair the
[39:10] walls." He said, "The Lord put it in his
[39:13] heart." Which means God's desire, God's
[39:15] ambition to see it restored was also his
[39:18] ambition, his desire to see it restored.
[39:21] And he said, "I told nobody
[39:23] what I'm working on, what I want to
[39:25] achieve in this instance because I want
[39:28] to keep this close to my chest.
[39:32] So I want to have a balanced approach in
[39:35] how we live life now, understanding what
[39:38] to express, understanding who you could
[39:40] trust because quite honestly friends,
[39:42] you can't just trust everybody.
[39:45] We are speaking about wisdom. We're
[39:47] speaking about leadership. We're
[39:48] speaking about growth. And we are
[39:50] speaking about you making the right
[39:52] moves.
[39:54] That's why the Bible say be gentle as a
[39:56] dove but be wise as a serpent.
[39:59] There's wisdom in all the
[40:01] administration. There's wisdom in all
[40:02] these things. Yes.
[40:09] In Luke 9:51 speaking about Jesus. Now
[40:12] when the time was approaching for him to
[40:14] be taken up to heaven, he was determined
[40:16] what were determined to go to Jerusalem.
[40:19] So there's a level of being fixed.
[40:21] Determined means it doesn't matter what
[40:23] obstacle comes. That's where I'm going.
[40:26] That's I am motivated to achieve
[40:28] something.
[40:30] I want to challenge us all in the room
[40:32] tonight.
[40:34] There are goals in your life, things
[40:36] that you want to achieve that you allow
[40:38] distractions, pettiness to destabilize
[40:40] you. I want to challenge you. You need
[40:42] to reach the point where you are
[40:44] determined about certain things because
[40:46] here the Bible is talking about Jesus
[40:48] being determined to go to Jerusalem. The
[40:52] choice of word determined in the
[40:53] amplified is significant. It meant
[40:56] against what odds against what people
[40:57] said, against the talk, against the
[41:00] accusations, against whatever else is
[41:01] around. My focus is achieving this
[41:04] thing. My ambition, my goal, my purpose,
[41:07] my destiny is to be there.
[41:11] divine determination.
[41:14] I'm not going to be too long with us
[41:16] tonight. Very short one. But again, I
[41:19] believe these are things for us to
[41:20] reflect and to think. I want to speak a
[41:22] bit to the young people specifically
[41:24] here. Now,
[41:26] we live in a very digital age
[41:30] and one of the challenges in this
[41:31] digital age is busyness.
[41:36] busy doing the wrong things, spending a
[41:39] disproportionate amount of time on
[41:43] social media, on watching people's
[41:46] content. And at the end of the day, when
[41:48] you really analyze how much time you
[41:51] spend studying other people's stuff,
[41:54] that if you were to redirect half of
[41:57] that effort
[41:59] onto working on you in the natural and
[42:02] the spiritual, you will be 10 times
[42:04] ahead where you are now. I want to
[42:06] repeat that point.
[42:09] If you spend half the time you spend on
[42:12] YouTube, Facebook, whatever it is, and
[42:16] shift that to working on you,
[42:20] you will be 10 times ahead.
[42:24] I want to challenge us because if you
[42:27] tell me you want to save and your
[42:29] ambition is to save, I giving you an
[42:31] example, and you spending your money on
[42:33] foolishness, then you're not really
[42:34] serious about your ambition.
[42:38] If you tell me you want to be healthy
[42:39] and your ambition is to be healthy and
[42:41] you're doing nothing about it, you're
[42:42] not serious yet. If you want to be
[42:45] promoted and you want to achieve certain
[42:47] things and you want then your ambition
[42:50] should make you make the decisions to
[42:53] begin to cut everything that is not in
[42:55] alignment with achieving that ambition.
[42:59] The people who we call friends
[43:02] who are not helping us to achieve our
[43:04] ambition, it becomes almost a tough
[43:09] rough position to take but is the only
[43:11] position to take if you want to achieve
[43:14] good success according to the Bible
[43:17] because you have to now be relentless in
[43:20] my spiritual walk, my family walk, my
[43:23] financial walk, my expressing who I am
[43:27] meant to be in God. why God have me on
[43:29] the earth. Everything else outside of
[43:32] that type of conversation is a
[43:34] distraction.
[43:36] People laugh and have fun and watch
[43:39] movies and do all these things and when
[43:41] all the entertainment is done, they're
[43:43] in the same position. What sense does
[43:44] that make?
[43:49] Anybody with me this evening?
[43:52] These are what I call the as the the
[43:54] brother preach in Uganda, the enemies of
[43:56] your ambition. What? Why are you
[43:59] allowing things to slow down your
[44:01] progress in the natural, in the
[44:02] spiritual?
[44:04] Why are you allowing doubt, fear,
[44:07] unbelief, whatever it is to slow you
[44:09] down?
[44:12] So, we spend our time scrolling. We
[44:14] spend our time having conversation. We
[44:16] spend our time to doing all these
[44:17] things. And what is the real result? I
[44:20] heard someone interview someone recently
[44:22] and
[44:24] you know it was a call and he said,
[44:26] "What are you doing right now?" Now he
[44:27] said, "Well, it's Sunday evening." Okay.
[44:29] So, what are you doing? I'm watching a
[44:30] movie to de-stress. Okay. What's he
[44:33] stressed? I don't have any money. So,
[44:34] why you watching the movie to distress
[44:36] and you have no money? Why you not
[44:37] working on the solving the problem?
[44:40] You anybody with me? Is a Sunday evening
[44:43] and say he is d-stressing because he has
[44:46] no money and his way to solve the
[44:48] problem currently is to watch a movie.
[44:50] So, what he's really saying is I want to
[44:52] ignore the problem.
[44:55] and by ignoring the problem
[44:58] because at the end of watching the movie
[45:00] I don't know if you realize the problem
[45:02] still is still there.
[45:06] Watching the movie hasn't changed
[45:08] anything.
[45:10] And what is seen as d-stressing is is is
[45:14] a cousin a first cousin to taking drugs
[45:17] is a first cousin to drinking because
[45:19] it's a temporary reprieve without any
[45:22] attempt to confront the reality of the
[45:24] situation. put pen to paper and say this
[45:27] is the problem. How many ways can I
[45:30] tackle the problem? How many ways?
[45:32] Because I could trust that if you work
[45:35] on a plan your stress will begin to fall
[45:37] when you begin to confront the issue. It
[45:38] is the ostrich syndrome. The ostrich is
[45:40] the only animal that when a problem is
[45:43] coming he digs a hole with his whole
[45:45] huge body buries his head in the sand
[45:48] and say the problem is not there.
[45:53] If your prayer life is not good, then
[45:56] the only way to fix your prayer life is
[45:57] to get to praying.
[46:02] If you want to change your
[46:04] circumstances,
[46:06] then you have to make the decisions to
[46:09] change your circumstances. You have to
[46:11] make the decisions to adjust how you
[46:14] speak, how you speak about yourself.
[46:16] Because your ambition, like Caleb, is
[46:19] give me my mountain. My ambition is to
[46:22] be on top of that mountain.
[46:26] Caleb in his old age reached the point
[46:28] saying, I don't even need help. I've
[46:30] been focused on that mountain for 40
[46:32] years. I'm just as strong as when I
[46:35] started out. My ambition has not
[46:37] diminished for 40 years. I walk around
[46:39] the wilderness because my brothers
[46:41] didn't have faith back then, but my
[46:43] ambition is not diminished.
[46:45] We have people who have accepted their
[46:48] sickness
[46:49] as if it's a promise from God
[46:53] when our ambition should be to climb
[46:55] higher than our sickness. Is anybody in
[46:56] the house this evening?
[47:00] Climb higher than your problems. So what
[47:03] we trying to do is challenge to reframe
[47:05] our thing because if you do not believe
[47:07] you could climb higher, you will never
[47:09] do anything to change your situation.
[47:12] I don't know if this is helping anybody
[47:13] tonight, but I want to make the point
[47:14] again. You have to believe that God is a
[47:17] healer and you you you will be healed.
[47:21] It cannot just be God is a healer and
[47:23] healing other people. You have to
[47:25] believe God will heal you. So your
[47:27] ambition, your words, your declarations,
[47:30] your actions, every word that comes from
[47:32] your mouth has to be in alignment with
[47:35] the ambition that I am going to be
[47:37] healed.
[47:40] You could never be successful hoping to
[47:42] be successful.
[47:45] I shared with the church some years ago.
[47:48] They did a study of some of the
[47:49] wealthiest people in the world and they
[47:51] were shocked at the findings.
[47:54] The outcome was across the board. The
[47:57] one common thing they could have found
[48:00] was that every single one of them were
[48:03] totally convinced they would be
[48:05] successful. They didn't know how, but
[48:08] they knew they were going to be
[48:10] successful. What that means, they were
[48:12] not so much caught up in the journey.
[48:14] They were focused on the destination
[48:19] and it didn't matter what the journey
[48:22] looked like because they were single
[48:24] focused on the and that is a scriptural
[48:26] principle that they have tapped into.
[48:29] Your ambition must be to have the Holy
[48:32] Ghost.
[48:33] Your ambition must be to be a perfect
[48:36] man. Be therefore perfect as your father
[48:39] in heaven is perfect. that scripture
[48:40] Matthew 5:48
[48:45] if that becomes your ambition your
[48:48] ambition as brother Brandham said is to
[48:49] be God's advertisement board have you
[48:52] been God's advertisement board this week
[48:56] have you been living such a life to
[48:58] point people to Christ that when they
[49:00] see you they say you know what I want to
[49:02] be like you
[49:04] what is your ambition tonight
[49:07] this is to sort of rock your thinking
[49:09] into you know what I good how I am you
[49:11] know I I cool you know I I really
[49:14] fighting up I whatever happen happen I
[49:16] just I just hanging in there I this is
[49:18] not a message about hanging in there
[49:20] we're not talking about hanging in there
[49:24] we're talking about having an ambition
[49:26] to keep climbing to keep moving ambition
[49:30] defines that backsliding cannot be an
[49:32] option because if you have an ambition
[49:34] to be a son to be a good son to be a the
[49:37] right kind of a son. Our pastors preach
[49:41] that the right kind of a son, if that is
[49:44] your ambition, how could that ambition
[49:46] and backsliding be the same paragraph,
[49:48] the same sentence?
[49:50] Because your ambition is to be the right
[49:52] kind of a son. The right kind of a son
[49:54] fit for adoption, fit for God to use
[49:57] you.
[49:59] Your ambition pushes you when you don't
[50:02] feel like pushing. Because every
[50:05] successful person will tell you there
[50:06] are times they feel tired. We referenced
[50:09] in the last Bible study Moses on the
[50:13] mountain when they were fighting
[50:14] Amalecch. When his hands were up, they
[50:16] won the battle. When his hands went
[50:18] down, they lost the battle. I want us to
[50:21] stop for a minute to realize that the
[50:23] real battle was not the battle in the
[50:25] valley.
[50:27] Man throwing sword, shields, spear,
[50:29] clashing, all that activity in the
[50:32] valley was not the real war.
[50:35] The real war was being fought on a
[50:38] mountain because when Moses raised his
[50:40] hand, they won. When Moses' hand fell,
[50:43] they lost the battle. And many times we
[50:46] look at what is happening in the valley
[50:47] and we're trying to blame the men in the
[50:49] valley, blame the situation in the
[50:50] valley, blame the the the challenges in
[50:52] the valley. And the real issue was Moses
[50:55] was getting tired.
[50:59] And if he didn't have the friends Aaron
[51:01] and her to lift his hands up, they would
[51:04] have never won the battle.
[51:06] This message on the fire of ambition is
[51:10] for you to reook at the fire.
[51:14] Reook at what's motivating you. Reook at
[51:17] what's inspiring. What is the source of
[51:19] your inspiration? What is driving you in
[51:22] the morning?
[51:24] Is it people still have to wake you up?
[51:25] I say to my team in my company, I I
[51:29] don't have to mo I shouldn't have to
[51:30] motivate you because motivation should
[51:32] come with you. You are supposed to be
[51:33] motivated. My job is to direct
[51:36] motivation, guide motivation. But if I
[51:39] have to motivate you, something wrong
[51:40] because we are built to be motivated. We
[51:43] are we are supposed to be motivated.
[51:46] Motivated should come with the territory
[51:49] because it's built into us to be the
[51:51] very best. If you are not desiring
[51:54] because God is perfect.
[51:57] So as we approximate to God, as we try
[52:00] to look like God, act like God, we are
[52:02] supposed to be nearer to perfection, not
[52:04] the other way. This is why the prophecy
[52:06] say we're living under our privileges.
[52:09] And this is across every area of our
[52:11] life. God has set a standard and the
[52:13] standard is not coming down to us. We
[52:15] have to rise to the standard. Come up
[52:18] hither. Climb higher. Lift your
[52:20] expectation. Your family could be
[52:22] stronger, better. Your house could be
[52:24] different. Restore the altar in your
[52:26] home. Change your perspective. Your
[52:29] ambition is supposed to be happy. The
[52:31] joy of the Lord is your strength. Why
[52:34] are you accepting anything less than
[52:36] that when that is what God's desire is
[52:39] for you?
[52:41] Adam walked away from God's ambition for
[52:44] him because God's ambition was for man
[52:47] to have dominion.
[52:49] I'm repeating the point again just to
[52:51] make sure it sinks in. Now, Adam's
[52:53] responsibility was to express that
[52:56] ambition in his daily life,
[52:59] display the ambition. And as he was in
[53:01] his ambition and God's ambition was
[53:03] being expressed, it was a perfect
[53:05] picture. What God wanted to achieve was
[53:08] achieved. What man was doing was in
[53:09] alignment with God's achievement.
[53:11] Anybody with me? Let me circle back here
[53:14] now.
[53:23] Mark 8:36.
[53:26] This is one of the most profound
[53:28] scriptures on ambition.
[53:31] For what shall it profit a man if he
[53:34] shall gain the whole world and lose his
[53:37] own soul?
[53:39] This gain the whole world is the story
[53:42] of ambition.
[53:45] Because for you to gain the whole world,
[53:48] it meant you worked harder than your
[53:49] competition. You did more, you achieved
[53:51] more, you grew, you made decisions.
[53:55] And the word is saying here, what profit
[53:57] is it if you shall gain the whole world
[54:00] and lose his soul?
[54:08] The ambition of God
[54:11] follows God.
[54:14] Social media has a dangerous impact
[54:18] because it creates a situation where
[54:21] people are looking into
[54:24] what they perceive to be the life of
[54:26] others.
[54:28] And the crazy thing is and there have
[54:30] been many studies done on this and it's
[54:32] embarrassing actually because young
[54:35] people look on social media, see things
[54:37] happening and they want to be like that
[54:39] because that's a mission. I want to be
[54:40] like that. I want to be an influencer. I
[54:42] want to be a content creator. I want
[54:44] that kind of life. I want that kind of
[54:45] home. I want that kind of marriage. I
[54:46] want that kind of clothes. I want that
[54:48] dress. We live in a world where
[54:50] marketing has changed because we want to
[54:52] have what other people have. So people's
[54:54] ambitions have now changed to reflect
[54:57] what other people are doing. Anybody
[54:59] with me? So this person wore that
[55:02] clothes, the store sell out because that
[55:05] person wore it. all of the stuff going
[55:07] that because people want to be like that
[55:10] and comparison
[55:12] has become what is the silent killer of
[55:15] calling. So why I look at my church well
[55:17] none of my friends come in. So who who
[55:19] are you benchmarking against?
[55:22] Because your ambition should not be
[55:24] coming from your school friends from the
[55:26] internet from social media for any
[55:28] because your ambition is vertical not
[55:30] horizontal. Anybody with me? Your desire
[55:33] should come from God. What does God
[55:35] want? And are you strong enough to say,
[55:38] you know what, I don't care what anybody
[55:41] else is doing. And this is where the
[55:43] statement as for me and my house, we
[55:45] will serve the Lord. And if nobody else
[55:48] will do it, I will do it because my
[55:50] connection is to God.
[55:54] That must become your ambition.
[55:59] On this thing about comparison, a
[56:01] scripture to note in 2 Corinthians
[56:03] 10:12,
[56:04] but they measuring themselves by
[56:07] themselves and comparing themselves
[56:10] among themselves are not wise. So this
[56:12] is a scripture that say here's what
[56:13] don't look at nobody.
[56:16] Can I read it one more time? But they
[56:19] measuring themselves by themselves and
[56:22] comparing themselves among themselves
[56:24] are not wise.
[56:26] So God is saying here's what don't look
[56:28] at nobody around you.
[56:32] Your benchmark what people could not
[56:35] achieve has nothing to do with you.
[56:39] How people have failed have nothing to
[56:41] do with you. You and not everybody else.
[56:44] As a daughter of God, as a son of God,
[56:47] your orders, your guidance, your
[56:50] instruction, your energy comes from the
[56:52] Lord. And when you see that picture and
[56:56] you seek the Lord with all of your
[56:58] heart, what devil, what demon, what
[57:00] opposition could ever stop you from
[57:02] achieving what God wants you to achieve?
[57:05] God has something to prove.
[57:08] And we have preached this before. When
[57:10] them brothers in the Old Testament pray
[57:11] and say, "Lord, Lord, we sin, but your
[57:14] name, Lord, I don't want your name for
[57:16] your name's sake." God responds because
[57:19] he is, he protects his name. He protect
[57:22] his investment. God chose you. God is
[57:24] not now choosing. God is not looking at
[57:27] the list here in this Bible said tonight
[57:28] to decide who to choose. He is choose.
[57:30] He is his choosing already took place.
[57:34] You are the expression of a choice that
[57:36] has already been made. But are you
[57:39] living fully in the choice that God has
[57:42] made for you when it comes to every
[57:43] aspect of your life? And the reason I'm
[57:45] harping on every aspect because God
[57:47] wants a complete Christian.
[57:50] He don't want you so spiritual that your
[57:52] natural life can't inspire anybody and
[57:54] so successful that your spiritual life
[57:56] can't inspire anybody. So he's very
[57:58] clear. He give you all things pertaining
[57:59] to life and godliness in balance. You
[58:02] could be a successful Christian living
[58:05] in holiness, living in purity and
[58:08] attributing all of your success to God.
[58:12] Anybody with me? So I'm sewing a seed in
[58:15] us tonight.
[58:17] Stop comparing yourself.
[58:21] The only comparison you need to make is
[58:24] against what you
[58:26] did and where you're going. In other
[58:28] words, beat your own record.
[58:31] You know, in the Olympics race, you have
[58:33] people who so good they don't even
[58:34] compete with nobody else. There was a
[58:35] time Usain Bolts was running and he
[58:38] beatated his record. Other people
[58:40] running, they like they not even in the
[58:41] race because he beating his record.
[58:44] So, it means he not competing with the
[58:46] other people in the race. He competed
[58:47] with himself.
[58:49] You need to compete with yourself. Are
[58:52] you a better version of yourself than
[58:54] you were last week, last month, last
[58:56] year? What's your personal record?
[58:59] What's your record in prayer? Could you
[59:01] beat that record? What's your record in
[59:03] reading scripture? Could you beat your
[59:04] own record in reading scripture? What's
[59:06] your record in forgiving? What's your
[59:08] record in blessing others?
[59:11] Last Bible study we talked about Lot was
[59:13] so blessed because Abraham was in his
[59:17] life.
[59:19] If there was ever a story in the Bible
[59:22] about cup running over was Abraham
[59:24] because the blessing of Abraham was so
[59:26] much that Lord get blessed and all of us
[59:29] it is good to have an Abraham in your
[59:31] life who could bless you. That's a
[59:32] that's a wonderful thing. But let me ask
[59:34] you a question. Are you an Abraham in
[59:36] anybody's life?
[59:39] Because there's two sides of this
[59:40] picture always, you know, it is good to
[59:42] say there's an Abraham in my life and
[59:44] because I've been in contact with this
[59:45] person, I've been blessed. But but could
[59:47] the opposite also be true that you are
[59:50] an Abraham to somebody else? That you
[59:53] are a blessing to somebody else? Anybody
[59:56] with me? Right.
[1:00:02] godly ambition could celebrate others
[1:00:05] because it clearly understands that no
[1:00:08] one else could take your place in the
[1:00:11] plan of God. I want us to appreciate
[1:00:13] that for a minute. Your place is unique
[1:00:16] in scripture. Paul could not replace
[1:00:19] Peter. Peter could not replace Paul.
[1:00:21] John couldn't do what Peter could do.
[1:00:23] Peter couldn't do what John could do.
[1:00:25] What Andrew was called to do was
[1:00:26] different from Peter, different from
[1:00:28] James. Every single one of us has been
[1:00:31] carefully designed for a specific role,
[1:00:34] a responsibility, a calling, a gift, a
[1:00:37] path, a journey that God himself
[1:00:40] designed. I want to encourage us. Your
[1:00:43] ambition must be to be perfectly aligned
[1:00:46] with what God wants you to be on your
[1:00:50] job, in your school, in your home, in
[1:00:52] your marriage. No excuse. I've said it
[1:00:55] over and over. When you work on your
[1:00:57] job, the Bible says you work to the
[1:00:59] Lord.
[1:01:01] These are principles that I believe God
[1:01:05] looks at.
[1:01:07] He says in all your ways, the word all
[1:01:10] is self-explanatory.
[1:01:12] All your ways acknowledge him and he
[1:01:14] will direct your path. If you cannot
[1:01:17] acknowledge him in something, why are
[1:01:19] you doing it?
[1:01:23] Anybody with me tonight?
[1:01:27] We must teach this generation
[1:01:31] that excellence and surrendering to God
[1:01:34] could coexist.
[1:01:36] I want to say that again. We must teach
[1:01:40] this generation that excellence,
[1:01:42] [clears throat] the spirit of
[1:01:44] excellence, the spirit of perfection and
[1:01:47] surrender to God can coexist.
[1:01:52] It doesn't have to be one or the other.
[1:01:54] I cannot accept it. It can coexist.
[1:01:58] Abraham was very successful and very
[1:02:01] spiritual.
[1:02:03] And I'm not defining success
[1:02:05] financially. I'm defining good success
[1:02:07] according to scripture. Meditate on the
[1:02:09] word day and night. You'll have good
[1:02:11] success. Success could be impact. As a
[1:02:15] school teacher, you have touched lives
[1:02:17] in a way that is next level. I have met
[1:02:19] teachers who are sloppy, who not
[1:02:21] prepared. They're not doing the work.
[1:02:22] Everybody know them. And they are
[1:02:24] teachers who distinguish themselves in
[1:02:27] every field, in every endeavor, in every
[1:02:30] specialization. They are medical doctors
[1:02:32] who are best in class. The medical
[1:02:34] doctors you watching, you want you want
[1:02:35] to know where were you in the class.
[1:02:40] There are engineers who are exceptional.
[1:02:42] There are engineers who are sloppy in
[1:02:44] every single aspect of life. There are
[1:02:46] people who are average. There are people
[1:02:47] who are above average. There are people
[1:02:49] who are below average. Where should sons
[1:02:51] and daughters of God exist on this
[1:02:53] spectrum?
[1:02:56] Is it acceptable when God has called us
[1:02:59] for a ministry of perfection for us to
[1:03:01] be sloppy in anything that we do?
[1:03:05] Because God himself gave the best,
[1:03:09] displayed the best, shared all. And
[1:03:12] across the board, our reflection of his
[1:03:15] majesty should be at a high standard all
[1:03:18] the time.
[1:03:21] Anybody with me? So the age of well
[1:03:24] trying to grow spirit trying to grow
[1:03:26] spiritually but your whole life in a
[1:03:29] mess. You have make up your bed in the
[1:03:31] last year.
[1:03:34] I don't want to come into your home
[1:03:35] tonight
[1:03:38] but your natural life there's no
[1:03:40] improvement. If God were to walk in
[1:03:41] their house, you say, "Hold on, hold on.
[1:03:42] Clean it up a little bit." And when tell
[1:03:44] me when I could come back
[1:03:47] is the old people used to say
[1:03:49] cleanliness is next to godliness.
[1:03:50] Anybody remember that?
[1:03:56] I'm challenging our thinking because it
[1:03:58] comes down to discipline.
[1:04:00] It comes down to how you want to live
[1:04:02] your life as a complete person
[1:04:06] and it comes to how you spend your time.
[1:04:09] Because many of us we practice what is
[1:04:11] some level of escapism. We want to
[1:04:13] escape. So we escaping. We we Tik Tok is
[1:04:16] escape. Facebook is a movie. Old talk is
[1:04:18] all kind of escape. And confronting the
[1:04:21] real issues to determine okay these are
[1:04:24] my gaps. These are my strengths. This is
[1:04:26] where I'm right. This is where I'm
[1:04:28] wrong. Help me see something better.
[1:04:30] Have the conversation. It is a blessing
[1:04:32] that Moses could have listened to his
[1:04:34] father-in-law because Moses could be a
[1:04:35] Trinidadian
[1:04:37] and say but Jethro God I talked to you
[1:04:39] God talk to me.
[1:04:41] If this one man in scripture we know was
[1:04:43] hearing lift to air from God is Moses
[1:04:45] and Moses say who are you to talk to me.
[1:04:48] But when Jethro say what you doing is
[1:04:49] not right. You're hurting yourself.
[1:04:51] You're hurting the people. Delegate the
[1:04:53] responsibility. Moses say you know what
[1:04:55] that making sense.
[1:04:58] And we challenged ourselves in the last
[1:05:00] Bible study, who are the people in our
[1:05:02] lives who could confront us, tell us the
[1:05:05] truth, and we wouldn't get offended
[1:05:06] because it's one thing for people to
[1:05:07] tell us the truth. It's a whole next
[1:05:08] thing if you could receive it. And many
[1:05:11] of us cannot receive the truth when it's
[1:05:13] told to us in even in love. And the
[1:05:15] reality is even if it's not in love, if
[1:05:17] it's the truth, you should be managed to
[1:05:19] say, you know what, you're right. You
[1:05:20] know,
[1:05:22] I could I could do better. I could
[1:05:24] improve. I could change. So I'm driving
[1:05:27] us for those in the room this evening.
[1:05:30] Let's reook at our ambition. Let's go.
[1:05:33] We must teach this generation that
[1:05:35] excellence and surrender could coexist.
[1:05:38] You could have a big dream but the brand
[1:05:40] say ask God for big things.
[1:05:45] That's a profound deep concept.
[1:05:49] You have two three different ailments.
[1:05:50] Why you want God to heal one? I want God
[1:05:52] to heal all.
[1:05:56] You could dream big and stay humble.
[1:05:58] That's God's picture. That's God desire.
[1:06:01] You can build without losing your
[1:06:03] beliefs.
[1:06:06] You could be successful and submitted.
[1:06:13] Colossians 3:17,
[1:06:16] "And whatsoever you do in word or deed,
[1:06:20] do all in the name of the Lord Jesus,
[1:06:22] giving thanks to God and the father by
[1:06:24] him."
[1:06:28] We have to reclaim the word ambition.
[1:06:34] It is not wrong to want to lead, to
[1:06:36] grow, to innovate, to excel because that
[1:06:39] is what Adam was doing.
[1:06:42] But it is arrogance when we do it
[1:06:43] without God.
[1:06:47] We need young people. We need fathers.
[1:06:49] We need mothers. We need entrepreneurs
[1:06:51] with the Holy Ghost.
[1:06:54] We need students in our schools who are
[1:06:56] top of their class
[1:06:59] because they have the discipline to
[1:07:01] study, but God is with them. I said to
[1:07:03] the young people many years ago, a
[1:07:04] thousand people could be applying to the
[1:07:06] job.
[1:07:09] You should have the qualifications, but
[1:07:11] God can now work with the man who doing
[1:07:13] the interview and say, you know what,
[1:07:14] there's something about this resume that
[1:07:16] I'm looking at here that I already feel
[1:07:17] this person is the person
[1:07:21] because you have God on your side, but
[1:07:23] you can't not have the qualifications
[1:07:25] and expect to be on top of the is a
[1:07:27] thousand people that apply for the same
[1:07:29] job. At the very least, you know, Daniel
[1:07:32] and these guys were all qualified, all
[1:07:34] sharp, they were they were sharp. We we
[1:07:36] did that Bible study a long time ago.
[1:07:40] They were masters in their craft.
[1:07:43] They adopted the language of their
[1:07:46] capttors
[1:07:49] and God was able to work with them. No
[1:07:52] excuses.
[1:07:58] This is the generation I believe that
[1:08:00] will marry spiritual
[1:08:04] growth, spiritual maturity with
[1:08:07] excellence.
[1:08:09] You could have the Holy Ghost and be a
[1:08:11] good husband, have the Holy Ghost, be a
[1:08:12] good wife, have the Holy Ghost, be a
[1:08:14] good son, have the Holy Ghost, be a good
[1:08:16] daughter. It cannot be you are so
[1:08:18] spiritual that you have no behavior at
[1:08:20] home. It it it not computed. This is not
[1:08:24] about living nice in church and you in
[1:08:26] your work if people don't know. I've
[1:08:28] preached many times your neighbors
[1:08:31] shouldn't be shocked to know you're a
[1:08:33] Christian.
[1:08:35] If your neighbors shock your Christian
[1:08:38] something is very wrong. If your
[1:08:40] coworkers be like, "Wait now. You you
[1:08:42] you just go to church.
[1:08:45] Something is very wrong.
[1:08:47] You must be able to type the source of
[1:08:50] your supply." The Bible says in Matthew
[1:08:53] 5:16, "Let your light so shine before
[1:08:57] men that they may see your good works
[1:09:00] and glorify your father which is in
[1:09:02] heaven." Not glorify you, you know, but
[1:09:05] is your light so shine before men that
[1:09:08] they may see your good works and glorify
[1:09:11] your father which is in heaven. Which
[1:09:13] means your light, your good works must
[1:09:17] reflect and glorify your father in
[1:09:19] heaven. Anybody with me?
[1:09:22] So you have to have something to show.
[1:09:27] In closing,
[1:09:29] is your ambition pure?
[1:09:33] I would love to believe that every
[1:09:34] single person in this room want to
[1:09:36] achieve something. But is your ambition
[1:09:39] pure?
[1:09:42] Psalms 139
[1:09:44] 23- 24
[1:09:47] David says, "Search me, oh God, and know
[1:09:50] my heart.
[1:09:51] Try me and know my thoughts and see if
[1:09:56] there be any wicked way in me and lead
[1:10:01] me in the way everlasting."
[1:10:05] Some of us, we have ambitions that were
[1:10:10] never ours to begin with.
[1:10:14] When a young boy, young girl says, "I
[1:10:16] want to be like this or like that," and
[1:10:19] is a movie star or an entertainer,
[1:10:21] that's an ambition that was never yours
[1:10:23] to begin with.
[1:10:26] Think about it.
[1:10:28] I want this. I want that. I want to do
[1:10:30] this. I want to do this. I want to do.
[1:10:31] Where did that ambition come from?
[1:10:35] Because there are only two sources of
[1:10:37] all ambition. It's either God's ambition
[1:10:38] like we started with the lesson on or
[1:10:41] the devil's ambition.
[1:10:43] Check your ambitions because we are
[1:10:46] guided by our ambitions. We are
[1:10:48] motivated by our ambitions
[1:10:51] and they have as we said eternal
[1:10:53] consequences. Let us bow our heads bow
[1:10:56] our heads for a word of prayer. Our
[1:10:59] gracious heavenly father, we thank you
[1:11:00] tonight for this short study
[1:11:04] on the fire of ambition. What drives us?
[1:11:08] What motivates us for us? Should we look
[1:11:11] at what's pushing us and what we want?
[1:11:12] And if what we want is what you want for
[1:11:15] us. There are many people with borrowed
[1:11:18] ambitions. They want things. They're not
[1:11:20] even sure why they want it. They don't
[1:11:22] know what they don't know why they want
[1:11:24] it, but they want it. And it's because
[1:11:26] of the influences that are around us.
[1:11:28] But Lord, you have ambitions that you
[1:11:32] have expressed to see a church without
[1:11:34] spot, without wrinkle. To see, Lord,
[1:11:37] your people come into a realization of
[1:11:39] who they are. You have an ambition for a
[1:11:42] manifestation of the sons of God. You
[1:11:43] have an ambition to see a perfect
[1:11:45] church, a church that sin cannot stay in
[1:11:48] that church. You have an ambition to see
[1:11:50] a church come to perfection, to
[1:11:51] adoption, to to see, Lord, there's my
[1:11:55] spirit flowing freely. That's your
[1:11:56] ambition.
[1:11:58] It is your ambition that we should be
[1:12:00] light that people could see and could
[1:12:03] acknowledge that we couldn't do it on
[1:12:05] our own. That it was you doing it all
[1:12:07] along. So, Father, we want to search our
[1:12:10] hearts as David said
[1:12:12] and know my heart. try me and see if
[1:12:15] there be any wicked way in me. Anything,
[1:12:17] any desire that I might have that is not
[1:12:19] in alignment with you, Father.
[1:12:22] Because at the end of the day, we want
[1:12:23] to reflect your majesty, your grace,
[1:12:26] your power. Give us the strength. Give
[1:12:28] us the focus. Give us the resolute
[1:12:31] ability as we read the scripture when
[1:12:34] you were determined to go to Jerusalem,
[1:12:37] Lord, to be determined to be real
[1:12:39] Christians. That our ambitions would be
[1:12:42] to be a true son of God, a true servant
[1:12:43] of God. Your prophet taught us, Lord,
[1:12:45] that you don't make halfway Christians,
[1:12:47] but a Christian could be halfway. Let
[1:12:49] our ambitions be to be all the way. You
[1:12:53] said you don't make halfway preacher,
[1:12:54] but a preacher could be halfway. You
[1:12:56] don't make halfway deacons. You don't
[1:12:57] make halfway anything. But Lord, it is
[1:12:59] up to us whether we have the ambition to
[1:13:02] be halfway or we have the ambition to go
[1:13:04] all the way. Give us the ambition to be
[1:13:07] Lord fishes of men. Give us the ambition
[1:13:09] as you said in Lord through your prophet
[1:13:11] the church of the living God is to have
[1:13:14] a high ambition. Help us to lift our
[1:13:16] ambition beyond what we may see with the
[1:13:18] natural eyes to see and tap into the
[1:13:21] ambition that you have for us that you
[1:13:22] could bless us abundantly, Father. that
[1:13:25] we can have the testimony of our cup run
[1:13:27] it over. And Lord, in running over
[1:13:29] others could be blessed. Our families,
[1:13:31] our loved one, those that we care about.
[1:13:32] Father, if there ever was a time for the
[1:13:34] standard to be raised, it's now. So,
[1:13:36] Father, may you bless your people. May
[1:13:38] you strengthen your people. May you
[1:13:39] inspire your people. May you touch those
[1:13:42] that might be afflicted even now.
[1:13:43] Father, the word teaches us if two shall
[1:13:46] agree touching anything, we could have
[1:13:47] it. And Lord, even as the word has gone
[1:13:49] forth tonight, Father, we come in faith
[1:13:51] together, Lord, with the ambition to see
[1:13:54] your ambition expressed to see your
[1:13:56] people healed completely. If there's
[1:13:57] anyone sick in our midst, any hard case,
[1:13:59] whatever it might be, Lord, we there are
[1:14:02] so many different ones in the church,
[1:14:03] Father, we unite in faith tonight, Lord,
[1:14:05] for the sick in our midst, Father, for
[1:14:07] those that are struggling. And Lord, the
[1:14:10] enemy will try to do what he wants, but
[1:14:12] we come against it tonight in the mighty
[1:14:14] name of Jesus Christ. Lord, may you heal
[1:14:16] your people. May you touch your people.
[1:14:18] May you break bands. May you, Lord,
[1:14:20] bring great deliverance to homes, to
[1:14:22] families, to lives. May you change
[1:14:24] situations and circumstances. Father,
[1:14:26] may you start a revival in homes. Lord,
[1:14:28] may you help restore the altars in the
[1:14:31] families. Father, Lord, there are so
[1:14:33] many other things we could be doing at
[1:14:34] this point in time, but here we are
[1:14:36] tonight, Lord, in this session. So, may
[1:14:38] you bless your people, may you
[1:14:39] strengthen your people, may you inspire
[1:14:41] your people, and may you be with us. May
[1:14:42] you bless the service this coming
[1:14:45] Sunday. May Lord the power of God move
[1:14:48] in such a way Father that Lord we would
[1:14:51] Lord say it was good to have been here.
[1:14:52] May you be with your people in the
[1:14:54] precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen and
[1:14:56] amen and amen. May the Lord richly bless
[1:14:58] you this evening. May he keep you.
[1:15:01] Looking forward to seeing everyone in
[1:15:03] church on Sunday. Lord willing. God
[1:15:04] bless you. Have a wonderful evening.
[1:15:06] Have a blessed weekend. Thank you so
[1:15:07] much for coming.
