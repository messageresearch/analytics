[39:46] a familiar scripture
[39:49] and we want to read from the book of
[39:51] Genesis reading from chapter 18 A few
[39:54] verses there from verse 9 to 14.
[40:00] hope everybody's feeling fine
[40:02] everybody's on the expectation
[40:06] my will just look and see what the Lord
[40:08] will do
[40:10] amen reading Genesis Chapter 18 verses 9
[40:14] to 14.
[40:16] and they said unto him where is Sarah
[40:19] thy wife and he said and this is Abraham
[40:21] just as a context this is Abraham being
[40:24] visited and he said where is Sarah thy
[40:27] wife and he said behold in the tent and
[40:30] he said I will certainly return unto
[40:32] thee according to the time of life and
[40:34] look Sarah thy wife shall have a son
[40:37] and Sarah heard it in the tent door
[40:40] which was behind him now Abraham and
[40:43] Sarah were old and well-stricken in age
[40:45] and it ceased to be with Sarah after the
[40:47] manner of women
[40:48] therefore Sarah laughed within herself
[40:51] saying after I am waxed All Shall I have
[40:54] pleasure my Lord being old also and the
[40:56] Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did
[40:59] Sarah laugh
[41:00] saying shall I of a surety be a child
[41:03] which I'm old
[41:05] is anything too hard for the Lord an
[41:08] honest Focus there at the time appointed
[41:11] I will return unto thee according to the
[41:14] time of life and Sarah shall have a son
[41:18] amen

[41:28] hearts and your upma understanding Lord
[41:29] Lord I pray that these broken up words
[41:32] and thoughts that have been placed
[41:33] together pray that you would sow them
[41:35] together like a master tailor that
[41:36] you'll weave them together Lord so they
[41:38] they will make sense and and and we will
[41:41] be able to delve and dig into your word
[41:43] tonight Lord I pray that we will leave
[41:44] here blessed and and knowing that it was
[41:47] good for us to have been here Lord in
[41:49] Jesus name we pray amen you may have
[41:51] your seeds
[41:56] before I begin I just want to say thanks
[41:59] for the opportunity to be able to speak
[42:01] this evening and just to share a few
[42:02] words I I consider myself the least of
[42:05] the disciples but a disciple nonetheless
[42:08] amen
[42:09] you know I always say it's a privilege
[42:12] to be here
[42:13] and you could never be prepared enough
[42:15] you could never be ready enough but
[42:17] there's a time appointed that God will
[42:19] call and once he would have
[42:21] predestinated that it has to be
[42:22] delivered amen
[42:23] at this point just as as a title
[42:27] I want to say what's your excuse and
[42:29] we'll get into it in a little while but
[42:30] it's just that question what's your
[42:32] excuse you see
[42:34] the reason I chose this as a title the
[42:37] reason I chose it as a title is that I
[42:39] realized
[42:40] that there's a lot that's going on
[42:42] there's a lot of things that we read
[42:43] there's a lot of things that we see and
[42:45] a lot of times we get distracted and
[42:48] Disturbed and sometimes we miss the mark
[42:50] and and get off the trail or the track
[42:52] that'll be supposed to be on because we
[42:55] are comfortable and satisfied with
[42:57] making excuses
[42:59] sometimes we make them because of habit
[43:02] we saw a custom-making excuses that we
[43:04] continue doing it and other times we
[43:07] make it because we feel it's a it's a
[43:10] it's a cup out it's something that will
[43:12] make others believe or make God believe
[43:15] or make you know make people believe
[43:17] that we're okay so we'll use excuses
[43:19] sometimes we use excuses for failure
[43:23] sometimes we fail in doing the things
[43:25] that we're supposed to do so instead of
[43:27] acknowledging that that we didn't do it
[43:29] we will make an excuse sometimes our
[43:32] excuse may even be hinge on other people
[43:33] so so you will hear us just to make it
[43:36] familiar and and to understand the
[43:38] context we will say but everybody do
[43:41] that
[43:42] we'll see but it's not as bad as no you
[43:45] really failed you know you really didn't
[43:47] do what you were supposed to do but we
[43:49] tend to make excuses and my question
[43:51] tonight is what's your excuse and I'm
[43:54] gonna jump to the conclusion so up front
[43:56] I know it may seem a little back to
[43:57] front but the conclusion is I have
[44:00] searched
[44:01] I have researched
[44:03] and I am yet to find an excuse that is
[44:07] acceptable to God
[44:08] that God will say you know what I like
[44:11] that one that's a good excuse no matter
[44:13] what you think I don't think you have an
[44:15] original excuse that God could accept
[44:17] and I will just jump down a little bit
[44:19] you see often times we have some excuses
[44:22] that are very very familiar
[44:24] and I will give you an example for
[44:26] example Tonight We Gather here and I was
[44:30] asking your pastor tonight I say you
[44:32] recall that in Trinidad we have a
[44:34] holiday tomorrow
[44:35] so I know we packed out tonight because
[44:37] there's a holiday tomorrow we do have
[44:38] work we do have school we probably don't
[44:40] have to take everything too much we
[44:42] don't have to uh to iron in advance
[44:44] because it's a holiday it's a Morrow
[44:46] so
[44:48] what we will do we will sit back despite
[44:50] the fact that there's a holiday tomorrow
[44:51] and say you know what these three days
[44:54] were so tiring
[44:56] a real dad I would love to go up or no
[44:59] but are tired that is an excuse so so
[45:01] the reason you're not praising and
[45:03] worshiping and gathering in the house of
[45:05] God as you should or as the scriber as
[45:07] required is because you make excuses and
[45:10] it makes you feel comfortable so what
[45:12] you're doing say well you know
[45:14] I should really go you know but so so so
[45:17] stay in home too
[45:18] or so so do it too so we kind of hinge
[45:22] on that and God don't like it
[45:25] God will accept that he not buying that
[45:28] you know why I often use that one you
[45:30] see being tired being tired is a state
[45:34] it's a it's a health condition that you
[45:37] feel tired so it's normal you work hard
[45:40] and you feel tired you're required to
[45:41] sleep right even God he created
[45:45] created after six days and you rested so
[45:47] that's a natural progression to feel
[45:49] tired however the question I have for
[45:52] you tonight is how come Wendy the
[45:54] airline saying the flight is 1am
[45:58] 10 o'clock you in the airport nine
[46:00] o'clock in the airport the flight is 4
[46:02] a.m one o'clock in the airport somehow
[46:04] you don't feel too tired right because
[46:06] we know we have an appointment to keep
[46:09] so it's not so much the tiredness but
[46:12] the level of importance that you play
[46:14] that your place on the activity that's
[46:16] required so I just want to highlight a
[46:19] couple of things you know some of the
[46:21] excuses we get
[46:24] all in our minds
[46:26] so you know we say we say things like
[46:28] you know I'm not sure how to do it
[46:31] I do have the experience I don't know
[46:32] how to pray
[46:34] I don't know how to cry out unto God I
[46:36] don't know how to call upon his name you
[46:38] know we hear these things and after a
[46:39] while it's freeze this is tombs it's
[46:41] things that we get a custom hearing
[46:43] that's why I say some of it is very
[46:44] familiar so you say well you know what I
[46:47] am crying out right now oh no because
[46:49] brother so so not crying out right now
[46:52] you know I I have praying real hard or
[46:54] Earnest or really desperate right now
[46:56] because I really have something to do
[46:58] after and in reality that's simply or
[47:02] merely excuses you're making
[47:04] right but you know when you read the
[47:07] Bible you'll see
[47:08] that excuse car whole water as we say
[47:11] because even Jesus when his disciples
[47:13] say teach us to pray we don't know how
[47:15] to do it you know what he said Our
[47:17] Father Who Art in Heaven and he took the
[47:19] time to teach them so there was a way so
[47:24] the car come next we can say well you
[47:26] know we don't know how to pray you know
[47:27] we can't pray because he already decided
[47:31] listen I'm not taking that excuse so I
[47:33] will teach you if I have to I will guide
[47:35] if I have true I will pull you through
[47:37] the fire and the flood and through the
[47:38] water and through great trials if I have
[47:40] to because I want the outcome that I
[47:42] want and that's the kind of God we serve
[47:44] he not willing to take excuses so I
[47:47] still ask the question what's your
[47:48] excuse tonight because we all make
[47:50] excuses for things we do for things we
[47:52] don't do for things we fail at the
[47:53] things even our successes we make
[47:56] excuses at so I want to come back to a
[47:59] couple scriptures and and
[48:02] and highlight a couple other things like
[48:04] I say is a simple it's a simple thing I
[48:07] want to share but in my research as well
[48:09] I found out that God do require much of
[48:12] you you know you know that you know we
[48:14] try to complicate things but God don't
[48:17] require much I have realized you know
[48:20] one time I was working and and the
[48:22] manager used to quote something and he
[48:25] used to say success leave Clues if you
[48:27] want to be successful you just do what
[48:29] successful people do right in the Bible
[48:32] when you saw the story of Cain and Abel
[48:35] God said do as your brother do and you
[48:38] get the same result so it goes to reason
[48:40] that if you do the things that God
[48:43] requires you'll get the same result that
[48:45] God promised not so so with that in mind
[48:49] I realized that he didn't require much
[48:51] you know
[48:52] he said I want obedience
[48:54] we heard it on Sunday
[48:55] you say I want obedience so I want you
[48:58] to obey my word I want you to obey what
[49:00] my prophets say I want you to obey what
[49:03] the minister say because if he is my
[49:05] mouthpiece right now and he said this
[49:07] and this is what I want for you tonight
[49:09] I want you to be obedient to that and I
[49:12] will bless that
[49:13] and more than that I Will Bless even
[49:15] your obedience to it even if you don't
[49:18] understand it does that make sense no
[49:21] when I looked at that
[49:23] in particular I realized he he
[49:26] required a couple of other things
[49:28] no I'm not saying this is an exhaustive
[49:30] list I'm not saying this is all he
[49:31] required but he required a couple other
[49:32] things one of the things he required is
[49:35] that you said the right thing
[49:37] he he really likes that apparently you
[49:41] know he likes you to say the right thing
[49:43] he he rewards that right he takes pride
[49:48] in the fact that his children no matter
[49:50] big or small could say the right thing
[49:53] and with that in mind
[49:56] that there is a message for the brown
[49:57] and preach called go tell and paragraph
[50:00] 186 he said you know the two little boys
[50:03] are sitting here speaking about sister
[50:04] Hattie Wright I'm sure we're all
[50:06] familiar with it I always say I don't
[50:07] try to reinvent the wheel I'm not
[50:09] preaching my own thoughts and ideas I'm
[50:10] not sharing anything I'm made up and it
[50:12] says the two little boys are probably
[50:14] sitting here in the meeting somewhere
[50:16] this morning now this wasn't at the time
[50:18] my sister had had to write requested the
[50:20] salvation of her two boys this is after
[50:22] the fact and he said they probably sit
[50:24] in somewhere so he's looking in the
[50:26] audience and say they're probably
[50:27] sitting somewhere are they here with you
[50:31] so he's asking her and she is there in
[50:34] the back
[50:35] and
[50:37] you see in the back in the back where
[50:38] are you boys raise up your hands where's
[50:40] the two boys there they are standing in
[50:43] the back so they obviously stood up and
[50:46] he said there they are standing back in
[50:49] the back God bless you all right there
[50:51] you are now what happened and he went
[50:53] back into the story and he said the same
[50:55] thing no matter what she'd have happened
[50:58] what she'd have asked she could have had
[51:01] it she could have got it now I'm wanting
[51:04] to see that happen no here it is you say
[51:07] I'm wanting to see that happen which had
[51:10] happened before all right you say it's
[51:13] going to be the attitude of the people
[51:15] towards the message see how she she said
[51:19] it she said just the right thing it's
[51:22] what you say that does it what you see
[51:26] right so that's why I said earlier you
[51:28] do have to understand everything but
[51:31] given the scenario and if we backtrack a
[51:33] little bit whether Brandon was there and
[51:35] he was giving the the illustration the
[51:37] synopsis of what transpired with the
[51:39] squirrels and as he was giving the story
[51:42] she sat right there and at the
[51:44] conclusion he said thus said the Lord
[51:46] you said the right thing and you could
[51:48] have a million dollars you could have
[51:50] whatever you asked for and he gave her
[51:53] the option he gave her the opportunity
[51:54] to choose and you know what he said you
[51:57] said the right thing and because of that
[51:58] it didn't matter I always say it doesn't
[52:01] matter the distance it doesn't matter
[52:03] the time the space wherever you are God
[52:05] could reach you wherever you are right
[52:07] now tonight so so it brings us back to
[52:10] another excuse you know we often say
[52:12] listen you don't know what I'm going
[52:13] through you don't know the drama I have
[52:15] home right you know what that is an
[52:18] excuse
[52:19] so I asked you again what's your excuse
[52:21] because it's easy to say you don't know
[52:23] what I have to deal with but you know
[52:25] your scenario different your scenario
[52:27] nice but look look at this how Boys
[52:30] Wouldn't win Christians but Abraham said
[52:32] that they want Christian boys but you
[52:35] know what she just by having a desire
[52:36] and saying the right thing was able to
[52:39] achieve the salvation of her two boys
[52:41] amen so what's your excuse tonight your
[52:44] family your friends your loved ones
[52:46] because I'll tell you
[52:49] there's a young man
[52:52] and his excuses we're talking about to
[52:54] ask you about your exes and you know
[52:57] you'll often hear things like
[52:59] all you don't understand and all you
[53:01] don't understand my family don't even
[53:02] like me
[53:03] sometimes you say I'm the black sheep
[53:05] they do even like me right but you know
[53:08] what there was a next guy whose family
[53:11] didn't like him
[53:13] in case you didn't know his name is
[53:14] Joseph
[53:16] they didn't like him so you know what
[53:17] they chose to do they took him and they
[53:20] saw them into slavery at first the
[53:22] treatment are pit they say we will make
[53:24] up a story and say he died at that some
[53:26] wild animals took him but all that was
[53:30] the distract from what was really taking
[53:32] place God actually had a plan beyond
[53:34] that right so so let's just just look at
[53:38] it for a second
[53:39] if your excuse is not your family don't
[53:41] like you
[53:42] how do you not know per Adventure God is
[53:46] setting up the scenario
[53:48] for you to be able to deliver them for
[53:50] you to be positionally placed that you
[53:52] could assist and help them instead of
[53:55] sitting back and making excuses just
[53:57] acts and move forward just hold on to
[54:00] the promise of God and realize that
[54:02] we've seen it before the same way
[54:04] brother Branham said listen that's what
[54:06] I would like to see I'd like to see that
[54:08] again I'd like to see it over and over
[54:10] because if you do the same thing you
[54:13] will get the same results
[54:14] [Music]
[54:17] so we we talk about a couple excuses
[54:21] you know at times they say well you know
[54:24] I long in the vineyard
[54:26] I owe you a long time
[54:28] I've seen this before we've gone through
[54:30] this before you know we've seen seen
[54:33] Revival after Revival we've heard
[54:35] preaching we have we've had conventions
[54:37] we had things but but I looking for the
[54:38] coming of the Lord
[54:40] are looking for for God to come down and
[54:42] do things
[54:46] 40 years
[54:48] 50 15 3 years
[54:52] think about it that's another excuse so
[54:55] the reason you're not praising prison
[54:57] and worshiping like God is coming
[54:59] tonight is because you believe you
[55:01] waiting long I will tell you and you
[55:03] knew it already there was a guy named
[55:05] Noah he was preaching a hundred and
[55:08] twenty years it will rain it will rain
[55:11] as a matter of fact if we look at
[55:13] Abraham
[55:14] brother Branham said you know God
[55:16] couldn't tell him you have to wait for
[55:17] 25 years you know
[55:20] why because the attitude would have been
[55:22] the front the kind of passion and
[55:25] perseverance and persistence you can
[55:27] imagine him going by the doctor every
[55:28] year twice a year three times a year
[55:30] every quarter for a checkup this they
[55:34] thought he was mad you know but he was
[55:36] so convinced of the promise of God that
[55:39] he was pressing forward like never
[55:42] before year in year out Noah was so
[55:45] convinced that he gathered his family to
[55:47] biliacono
[55:49] I know what you're thinking
[55:51] you know that was back then
[55:53] and that was his family
[55:56] and they had little choice but to
[55:58] believe God spoke to him directly
[56:01] but you know God speak to you directly
[56:03] too
[56:06] imagine
[56:09] this is the next one you know there are
[56:13] those who say
[56:14] you know nobody does really come and
[56:16] minister to me
[56:18] nobody does share things with me and
[56:20] encourage me and motivate me and really
[56:23] you know Raise Me Up and lift me up and
[56:25] make me feel great but when I really
[56:28] would there was a fella named job I
[56:30] don't know if you're no job right but I
[56:32] read about job and they say you know he
[56:35] encourage himself
[56:38] he did never pass to a preacher or
[56:40] somebody to share an openly word and say
[56:42] brother Joe we heard anything I want you
[56:44] to keep pressing on you know I want you
[56:46] to stay strong I want you to keep doing
[56:48] that and I want you you know stay with
[56:51] me no he didn't have that but you know
[56:53] what
[56:54] he was in a very very unusual position
[56:59] and I know it may seem all over the
[57:01] place tonight but I want to backtrack a
[57:03] little bit you backtrack we'll come back
[57:05] to job
[57:07] I want to come to the Battleground and
[57:09] you see you know everything I say in
[57:12] here already
[57:13] so
[57:15] in the greatest battle ever fought
[57:17] paragraph 67 right he said there has to
[57:20] be a place selected and in this there's
[57:23] a mutual ground no man's land and they
[57:26] fight here at this place
[57:27] they just don't one fight over here and
[57:30] one dog here and one run over here
[57:32] there's a Battlefront where they meet
[57:34] and test their powers where each Army
[57:36] tested strength against the other Army a
[57:39] mutual meeting place now don't don't
[57:43] miss this you want you to get it
[57:45] he said when this great battle started
[57:47] on Earth there had to be a mutual
[57:49] meeting place there had to be a place
[57:51] selected for the battle to begin and for
[57:53] the battle to rage and that
[57:54] Battlegrounds began under human mind
[57:57] there is where the battle starts the
[58:00] human mind was chosen
[58:02] for the place of the battle where it was
[58:04] to begin and that is because that
[58:07] decisions are made from the Mind ahead
[58:09] no they never started it from from some
[58:12] organization they never started it from
[58:14] some mechanical Affair the grounds never
[58:17] started there therefore that
[58:19] organization can never never do the work
[58:21] of God because the Battlegrounds way of
[58:23] got to meet your enemy is in the mind
[58:26] you've got to make your choice it meets
[58:28] you right so it's so interesting
[58:33] that the Battleground is in the mind
[58:36] the Battleground is in mind remember
[58:37] that now the Battleground isn't a mind
[58:40] so a lot of what we go through a lot of
[58:42] the excuses we make a lot of the
[58:45] failures and short comments that we have
[58:46] is really right upstairs here you know
[58:51] right upstairs here in your mind imagine
[58:54] there was a man who said listen
[58:57] in our eyes we look like grasshoppers
[59:01] there was a next one who said
[59:04] I am the lease of My Tribe
[59:06] my tribe is the least my family is Elise
[59:10] I am the smallest we can't do anything
[59:14] that is in their mind you know
[59:16] so once again I asked you what's your
[59:18] excuse if this is the Battleground every
[59:22] Battleground is in your mind it means
[59:23] you need to fix your mind
[59:26] yeah
[59:28] because imagine God say as a man think
[59:31] in his heart so he is
[59:34] so he is so is he it means this is where
[59:38] a lot of the problems are at so we need
[59:41] to sort that out we need to fix that so
[59:44] you can see the pictures clearly so can
[59:48] you imagine if we stop making excuses
[59:51] listen if you could only
[59:53] stop making excuses I will tell you
[59:56] something
[59:57] I started off and I said God don't
[59:59] require much I could recall that and I
[1:00:01] said what do you think she requires
[1:00:02] obedience
[1:00:04] he wants us to say the right thing you
[1:00:06] know what else he wants he wants the
[1:00:09] right attitude
[1:00:12] strange enough I never say he wants you
[1:00:14] to think to figure it out you know
[1:00:17] because he say you know listen
[1:00:20] this should be the same for the most
[1:00:22] illiterate person
[1:00:24] you don't have to try intellectual
[1:00:27] gymnastics and semantics and try to flip
[1:00:29] it and form a quadratic equation and and
[1:00:32] say the solution is and therefore proven
[1:00:36] you don't have to prove it you know
[1:00:38] the word Vindicated already
[1:00:41] all you have to do is have faith and
[1:00:43] believe and abide by his requirements so
[1:00:47] if you require for you to be obedient be
[1:00:50] obedient if you require that you said
[1:00:52] the right thing see the right thing if
[1:00:55] he requires that you have the right
[1:00:56] attitude
[1:00:58] now listen I don't have to say it
[1:01:00] but
[1:01:02] I want to read it for you in the same
[1:01:05] message go tell
[1:01:06] paragraph 189
[1:01:09] he said look at the syrophision woman
[1:01:12] when she come to Jesus she said Lord my
[1:01:15] daughter is Grievous grievously vexed
[1:01:18] with a devil thou son of David come heal
[1:01:21] her he said and we know it it's not meat
[1:01:24] for me to take the children's bread and
[1:01:25] give it to dogs
[1:01:27] this is better Brian would snow he said
[1:01:30] what if he would have said that to some
[1:01:32] of us
[1:01:34] to some of us
[1:01:35] we say call me a dog huh wasn't nothing
[1:01:38] to him nothing but a belzebub we'd have
[1:01:42] that attitude but not her
[1:01:44] she said it's true Lord
[1:01:47] she accepted what was even said about
[1:01:49] her
[1:01:50] and based on her attitude remember
[1:01:54] the right mental attitude towards any
[1:01:57] promise of God will bring us apart so so
[1:01:59] here he hears us now she said you're
[1:02:01] exactly right
[1:02:03] in essence
[1:02:04] I accept it
[1:02:06] you're right that's the truth to say but
[1:02:09] the dogs are willing to eat these crops
[1:02:12] under the children's table and and
[1:02:15] listen you say that got him he said for
[1:02:18] this saying the devil left your daughter
[1:02:20] for the same so just have any right
[1:02:23] attitude just changing your pictures a
[1:02:25] little bit just sorting out your mind a
[1:02:27] little bit just getting in line with
[1:02:29] what God wants you to see the
[1:02:31] perspective that he's trying to show you
[1:02:32] will change your results so if we could
[1:02:35] do away with the excuses you realize
[1:02:37] victory is yours the battle is not yours
[1:02:41] but if victory is yours if you could do
[1:02:43] that listen
[1:02:45] get started God will do do the rest but
[1:02:49] you can't start with excuses with
[1:02:51] excuses you have nothing to get that's
[1:02:53] failure making an excuses failure so I I
[1:02:57] hope that by the end of this we could
[1:02:59] look at ourselves and do some
[1:03:00] introspection and realize wait a minute
[1:03:02] what kind of excuses have I been making
[1:03:04] what's my excuse that's why the title
[1:03:06] was your excuse what excuse you have for
[1:03:09] not reading the Bible what excuse you
[1:03:11] have for not share any word and
[1:03:12] evangelize them what excuse you have for
[1:03:14] praising halfway well God that promotion
[1:03:18] has come true yet you know
[1:03:20] you know that that I really praying and
[1:03:22] hoping for that but what if God just
[1:03:25] looking to see if you could praise
[1:03:28] what if God look in the city level of
[1:03:30] worship that you give him
[1:03:33] you know you know what you see God is
[1:03:36] looking for somebody the more He blesses
[1:03:38] he will humbly becomes what if God is
[1:03:41] just testing you and watching you and
[1:03:42] watching your behavior and watching your
[1:03:44] attitude and watching your operation all
[1:03:46] along and you sit back trying to judge
[1:03:49] God and gorgeous watching just waiting
[1:03:51] on you saying I'm watching you I'm
[1:03:53] watching you are watching you but but
[1:03:55] you know what
[1:03:57] I know at times you say you know it's
[1:03:59] not me you know I doing all your
[1:04:01] writings but if you understand on my
[1:04:03] workplace the boss don't like me as
[1:04:05] pressure they try to harass me to try to
[1:04:08] box me and they try to do all kind of
[1:04:09] thing but I'll tell you about a guy I
[1:04:11] know you know the guy you ever heard
[1:04:13] about Dan Daniel
[1:04:15] listen they changed laws for Daniel
[1:04:18] they listen this is not they tell you
[1:04:21] sit down there you know they go to
[1:04:23] Parliament and change the legislation to
[1:04:25] ensure that you can do particular things
[1:04:27] you know so which which pressure are we
[1:04:30] talking about what's your excuse your
[1:04:32] boss change your laws
[1:04:34] your boss put restrictions on you that
[1:04:36] you can't pray for your meal
[1:04:38] your boss change the fact that listen
[1:04:41] right now we are the month of Ramadan
[1:04:43] and Muslims pray five times a day
[1:04:46] throughout the year
[1:04:48] in the month of Ramadan in addition to
[1:04:50] that they have extra prayers they have
[1:04:52] fasting and breaking up fast religiously
[1:04:55] what's your excuse
[1:04:57] what was your excuse you're busy oh I
[1:05:00] forgot you're busy I did say earlier on
[1:05:02] I've not seen an excuse that God could
[1:05:06] accept that he said hey you hear what
[1:05:08] this one is a tough one I never
[1:05:10] encountered this one before this one is
[1:05:12] original I do know how to do you know
[1:05:14] what to get a blah you get a pass God
[1:05:16] have no grandchildren God promises his
[1:05:19] same the same requirement he said listen
[1:05:22] in the 11th I was the same pay tenth
[1:05:25] hour same pay requirement is the same so
[1:05:27] what's your excuse
[1:05:29] [Music]
[1:05:31] you know as we look
[1:05:33] I know there are those who might say you
[1:05:35] know are too old
[1:05:37] them things are asking me to do are you
[1:05:40] able with that Abraham was seen as too
[1:05:43] old to
[1:05:44] know that all you will promise me this
[1:05:47] promise me a son but what did God say
[1:05:51] he had a phrase and I told you hold on
[1:05:53] to it earlier you say is anything too
[1:05:56] hard for God
[1:05:57] anything
[1:05:59] nothing
[1:06:01] nothing nothing so all those Desires in
[1:06:05] your heart all those requests that you
[1:06:07] have and your silence I stop asking for
[1:06:10] it because perhaps God don't want to do
[1:06:12] that God just looking to see her body I
[1:06:14] wanted to know
[1:06:15] he wanted to see how much you believe in
[1:06:17] him because he promised it he promised
[1:06:20] you the Holy Ghost but you know what I
[1:06:22] asked faith I asked for the aspects and
[1:06:25] it's a rich yet so I take it I given God
[1:06:28] a little rest now I I don't want a song
[1:06:31] Maybe I don't want a song dependent I
[1:06:33] don't want a song you know like a
[1:06:35] nagging I don't want a song so at all
[1:06:38] but you know what you see you have not
[1:06:41] because you're astronaut
[1:06:43] you understand he say listen seek and
[1:06:46] you will find knock and will be opened
[1:06:49] he gave a blueprint that if you follow
[1:06:52] these things if you could say the right
[1:06:54] thing if you could have the right
[1:06:55] attitude if you have to be obedient to
[1:06:58] my word
[1:06:59] speaking of obedience I want a reference
[1:07:02] you may be seated I want to reference
[1:07:04] the story of Elijah you know Elijah his
[1:07:07] story is quite extensive but I want to
[1:07:09] hold into the path when he met the widow
[1:07:12] woman
[1:07:14] you see there are those who might say
[1:07:17] you don't don't know my scenario I have
[1:07:20] no husband I I don't have much money I
[1:07:23] don't have much resources I struggling
[1:07:25] what I described there was her story
[1:07:29] that was her story
[1:07:30] and
[1:07:31] he still went
[1:07:33] to her and give her an instruction
[1:07:36] she didn't have to understand it she
[1:07:39] didn't have to think it through she
[1:07:40] didn't have to try to figure it out or
[1:07:42] perhaps if I do this
[1:07:44] I wonder
[1:07:46] hmm
[1:07:47] what might happen boy she wasn't playing
[1:07:49] the lotto no
[1:07:51] she let me read it
[1:07:54] she was just being obedient to the word
[1:07:56] of God
[1:08:00] it's one a little long so I'll skip
[1:08:01] through you know there's a message the
[1:08:04] reaction to an action
[1:08:06] and I'll show you what he looking for
[1:08:10] from paragraph 40
[1:08:13] and this is the interesting thing that
[1:08:15] oftentimes we don't realize
[1:08:16] that God had lead us work on one side
[1:08:19] yeah he don't really work on one side
[1:08:20] you know I realized he just work on both
[1:08:23] sides so he know the end before the
[1:08:25] beginning
[1:08:26] he will tell you
[1:08:29] I want you to walk there
[1:08:31] brother Branham gave the illustration so
[1:08:33] beautifully he said listen he had a
[1:08:34] plane to catch and go tell him come walk
[1:08:37] I will show you where to go walk turn
[1:08:40] here go there when you go down on this
[1:08:43] side you will see a house there's a lady
[1:08:45] sitting right there so God was given
[1:08:47] instructions on this side and on the
[1:08:50] other side she was praying and when she
[1:08:52] saw him she said good morning person you
[1:08:55] say I've been praying and God told me he
[1:08:56] will send his servant here so God does
[1:08:59] work on both sides the challenge I have
[1:09:01] is that we don't have to seek something
[1:09:05] brand new we are not trying to reinvent
[1:09:08] the wheel we're taking the same promises
[1:09:10] that he gave and making them more real
[1:09:14] and making them of Greater effect and
[1:09:17] greater impact to us today we're not
[1:09:20] trying something we're not trying to
[1:09:22] create brand new we're not trying to
[1:09:24] create something that song interesting
[1:09:26] for 2023 we still happen and horn in on
[1:09:30] the same promise that he gave 10 years
[1:09:33] ago 20 years ago 40 years ago six years
[1:09:36] ago the same promise because it is the
[1:09:39] same yesterday today and forever
[1:09:42] in that message that I referenced
[1:09:44] earlier which is the reaction to an
[1:09:46] action
[1:09:48] he said he give him a vision
[1:09:51] I could see him walking down the street
[1:09:53] this is Elijah now the Lord must have
[1:09:55] told him this there'd be an old woman
[1:09:57] looking old she's young but she's
[1:09:59] looking old you see that
[1:10:01] her shoulders are stooped she's her
[1:10:04] shoulders are ragged her arms are out
[1:10:06] her sleeves should be out in the yard
[1:10:08] with two sticks in her hand and Elijah
[1:10:10] you know what that means what will be in
[1:10:12] about 800 years from now
[1:10:15] and as he walked he seen the woman he
[1:10:18] leaned over the little fence and said
[1:10:20] fetch me a little drink of water and she
[1:10:23] turned to say something and she thought
[1:10:24] that's a kind old man
[1:10:27] he speaks a little different from the
[1:10:28] ordinary men there's something about
[1:10:30] God's children that they know one
[1:10:32] another you see that
[1:10:35] something there's always been they know
[1:10:38] one another my sheep know my voice said
[1:10:40] Jesus and there she looked and she heard
[1:10:43] she looked at him and she said there
[1:10:45] must be something Godly about that old
[1:10:47] man said fetch me a little drink of
[1:10:49] water she nodded her head she would do
[1:10:51] it and she started to go away what
[1:10:55] then she heard a voice again and bring
[1:10:58] in your hand a little cake for me to eat
[1:11:00] a morsel of bread and she said
[1:11:03] this is where we started getting our
[1:11:05] heads now and and she said I have just
[1:11:08] enough for me and my little starving boy
[1:11:10] and I'm out here getting these two
[1:11:13] sticks I've just mixed it together
[1:11:14] dressed it and now I've got these two
[1:11:17] sticks to make a fire to make the cake
[1:11:20] and he and I will eat it and die then
[1:11:22] she heard she started to turn again and
[1:11:24] she heard a voice saying but bring me
[1:11:27] one first two
[1:11:29] that shows insistence he insisted hear
[1:11:32] what I'm not too concerned about your
[1:11:34] thoughts and ideas right now your mind
[1:11:36] doesn't matter you're not battling there
[1:11:38] I'm giving you an instruction bring me
[1:11:40] one first look she didn't have to go
[1:11:42] down and get her last penny he wasn't
[1:11:44] asking her for money he wasn't asking
[1:11:46] her from her resources she had to go
[1:11:48] down and get her last piece of bread
[1:11:50] this is a very sustenance now
[1:11:54] she didn't have to go for this or that
[1:11:56] or maybe change doctors or so forth some
[1:11:58] little insignificant thing but she had
[1:12:00] to go to the only thing that stood
[1:12:03] between her and death and her child
[1:12:06] so this is all she had she had nothing
[1:12:08] else this was it
[1:12:10] bring me a little cake first in your
[1:12:12] hand I can see her not her head obedient
[1:12:16] that's what God requires
[1:12:18] there's a prophet saying it this is not
[1:12:20] me this is the prophet saying obedience
[1:12:23] that's what God requires you get the
[1:12:26] word and the spirit mixed together
[1:12:27] self-sacrifice obedience when God's
[1:12:30] Prophet says a certain thing do it hold
[1:12:32] on to it she bowed her head yes sir
[1:12:36] sounds like the army yes certain
[1:12:39] instruction Amen to the instruction Amen
[1:12:43] to the word and she starts on
[1:12:46] then she heard the sweetest thing she've
[1:12:48] ever heard that all sufficient word that
[1:12:51] all of us listen for for there come
[1:12:53] across that Gates a blast from that
[1:12:55] prophet's voice said for thus said the
[1:12:58] Lord amen that's what we look to hear
[1:13:01] thus said the Lord the barrel will not
[1:13:04] go empty or the crews will fail until
[1:13:07] the day that God sends rain on the earth
[1:13:09] there it was
[1:13:11] amen so we see once again God requires
[1:13:15] obedience and he rewards that not your
[1:13:18] excuse it was an excuse to say this is
[1:13:21] all I have that we're going to eat this
[1:13:23] and die that's in your mind that's what
[1:13:25] you think that's what you feel that's
[1:13:26] what your emotions tell you but what did
[1:13:28] God's Prophet say what did God say what
[1:13:32] was the instruction if you're obedient
[1:13:33] to the word of God you would see
[1:13:36] he said obedience to the full word of
[1:13:39] God entitles you to the token and the
[1:13:41] token is a requirement so he calls us to
[1:13:44] be obedient amen
[1:13:46] I'm almost done
[1:13:48] I'm almost done
[1:13:50] you know
[1:13:53] at times we may sit back and say
[1:13:58] you know based on our past you don't
[1:14:00] understand my past
[1:14:03] not me but you may say
[1:14:05] you don't understand
[1:14:07] where I was where I come from I was a
[1:14:09] criminal I was a bandit I was a thief I
[1:14:12] was whatever
[1:14:13] I can't have no no no no restoration for
[1:14:16] me it can't have justification for me
[1:14:18] but you know what
[1:14:19] I think up to Sunday or last Wednesday
[1:14:22] we heard it
[1:14:23] there was a man next to Jesus on the
[1:14:26] cross
[1:14:28] and you know the story
[1:14:30] he was a career Criminal
[1:14:33] he was now regular Bandit he wasn't
[1:14:35] doing petty crime you know he not
[1:14:37] pickpocket in you know and then them
[1:14:39] days is a real deal because his penalty
[1:14:42] was death
[1:14:44] so he was to be crucified and he stood
[1:14:47] right next to Christ and you remember
[1:14:49] the three things I said I said just
[1:14:50] three things God requires not a whole
[1:14:53] big complex complicated thing he
[1:14:56] requires obedience
[1:14:58] he requires that you say the right thing
[1:15:00] and requires the right attitude so while
[1:15:03] imagine a crowd wanted to crucify Jesus
[1:15:06] and that they wanted to make sure that
[1:15:08] he was dead
[1:15:10] this man stood
[1:15:11] in the midst of all he talk in the midst
[1:15:14] of the back and forth and he said listen
[1:15:15] hear what hear what anybody could say
[1:15:17] anything you know but this man is an
[1:15:19] innocent man I know I am a criminal
[1:15:22] I know my sins I know my struggles I
[1:15:26] know my battles I deserve to be where I
[1:15:28] am now
[1:15:29] and he turned to Christ and said you
[1:15:31] know what just remember me
[1:15:33] because I I have accepted my position I
[1:15:37] know who I am I'm being sincere and
[1:15:39] honest about my cookery my my my my band
[1:15:42] the tree my thievery my my my criminal
[1:15:45] past and Jesus
[1:15:48] turned to him and see
[1:15:50] this D
[1:15:51] you will be with me in Paradise
[1:15:54] so I ask again
[1:15:56] what's your excuse
[1:15:58] you rubbed somebody 10 years ago 20
[1:16:01] years ago last week last month the god I
[1:16:05] served is able to deliver listen
[1:16:08] when I listen when you study the
[1:16:11] scripture and study the message I am
[1:16:14] marveled all the time to think
[1:16:16] that when you consider the fact and are
[1:16:20] not going into biology class but when
[1:16:21] you consider the fact that you are here
[1:16:24] and God imagine before the foundation of
[1:16:27] the Earth
[1:16:28] he chose you and knew that you'll be
[1:16:31] predestinated for this time
[1:16:34] scientists still discovering things
[1:16:36] they're still finding things as a matter
[1:16:38] of fact just last week I believe they
[1:16:40] named I believe it's a microscopic womb
[1:16:43] after Trinidadian scientists right this
[1:16:47] is present tense they still discovering
[1:16:49] things and before the beginning of the
[1:16:52] earth God saw you in this time
[1:16:56] he had to know what he was doing so so I
[1:16:59] realized
[1:17:01] that God don't operate like us
[1:17:05] most of the time
[1:17:06] some of the time he kind of mirrors us
[1:17:09] you know or we mirror him we kind of
[1:17:12] behave like like him because
[1:17:15] I was reviewing
[1:17:18] there's a message choosing a bride
[1:17:22] and it occurred
[1:17:24] that imagine
[1:17:26] as man
[1:17:32] in paragraph 79 it says but you know you
[1:17:36] have to plan look Pray when chosen for
[1:17:40] we see by this the Word of Promise
[1:17:43] she the bride that a man would choose is
[1:17:45] going to reflect his character
[1:17:48] it reflects what's in him
[1:17:50] now could you imagine a man filled with
[1:17:52] a holy ghost take something like that to
[1:17:54] your wife congregation says no
[1:17:57] I just don't see it brother now maybe
[1:17:59] I'm just an old crank but you know I
[1:18:02] just can't understand that see notice
[1:18:04] for it's going to reflect what's in him
[1:18:07] she's going to help him make his future
[1:18:10] home
[1:18:11] now I read that because this is an
[1:18:13] inatural right
[1:18:15] and the God we serve say he is choosing
[1:18:18] a bride
[1:18:19] you think he go into the club to pick up
[1:18:22] a bride
[1:18:24] you think you go in any dumpster look
[1:18:25] for his bride
[1:18:27] or he want his bride
[1:18:29] be the best that he could get
[1:18:31] as a matter of fact he want to
[1:18:33] micromanage your bride because he wanted
[1:18:35] bride to be just like him
[1:18:38] he want the bride to be such a
[1:18:40] reflection of him that if somebody look
[1:18:44] on the outside they don't even know if
[1:18:45] he Brides it or if he say it because you
[1:18:48] know what he said the word is in the
[1:18:51] bride here's the word right so after a
[1:18:54] while you will look and you don't even
[1:18:55] know if you're looking at the bride or
[1:18:57] you're looking at Christ
[1:18:59] right because of the type of bride he
[1:19:03] wants so it's not a random or by chance
[1:19:06] or or a random occurrence so when he
[1:19:09] chose you it's not by chance he didn't
[1:19:12] decide yesterday you know what I feel
[1:19:15] like going and choose brother popwell
[1:19:17] so you know what he goes show up to
[1:19:19] church tomorrow because I choose him
[1:19:21] yesterday no he no operates so he not
[1:19:24] haphazard and and you know just anyhow
[1:19:26] anyhow he want to make sure he could
[1:19:29] test he could try he could carry her
[1:19:31] through the fire see how you're fair if
[1:19:34] you don't make it he send it through the
[1:19:36] test a second time he he raised up the
[1:19:38] temperature a little bit because he
[1:19:39] wants to know that you could stand and
[1:19:42] you could could hold on to his promise
[1:19:44] Perhaps Perhaps you kill the bear so he
[1:19:48] will send a lion he wanted to know that
[1:19:50] he could overcome that and then Goliath
[1:19:52] come in you know because he wants to
[1:19:54] train your particular way is the same if
[1:19:57] you have a if if you want a Bella Army
[1:20:00] you think you just go in at the side
[1:20:02] side of the road and and they say come
[1:20:05] come you know what little army come with
[1:20:07] no experience you never shoot a firearm
[1:20:10] you know you have no background at all
[1:20:13] and you're building an army which battle
[1:20:14] have I done
[1:20:16] you setting up yourself Alex but you
[1:20:19] know what you will say well boy if you
[1:20:21] know where I pick up these guys you know
[1:20:22] what those things are excuses
[1:20:25] so the God I serve not into the excuse
[1:20:28] in business so he does go before
[1:20:31] and plan
[1:20:33] you know that there's a concept called
[1:20:34] The Art of War
[1:20:36] right and part of it and I'm seeing
[1:20:40] where Christ did it all the time
[1:20:43] you know what he will do let me just
[1:20:45] give you a secret right it's right there
[1:20:47] anyway
[1:20:48] he will go and because he know the end
[1:20:51] before the beginning
[1:20:52] he will study the opposition
[1:20:54] he will study your tactics
[1:20:57] he will study exactly what's going on
[1:20:59] with you he know your techniques he know
[1:21:02] exactly how you're going to come you
[1:21:04] know it's just like a good coach a good
[1:21:06] coach go tell your players go and play a
[1:21:08] no you go win go and play no you know
[1:21:10] what a good coach does the good coach
[1:21:12] will look at videos
[1:21:14] he will look at the opposition see how
[1:21:16] they're playing
[1:21:17] studying this like a personal want to
[1:21:19] make sure we understand what we're up
[1:21:21] against and when you capture the mind of
[1:21:24] that then you come to your star players
[1:21:27] and they say listen the week on the left
[1:21:29] foot or the week on the left side so I
[1:21:31] want you to run this way and pass this
[1:21:34] one because they tend to Shield this one
[1:21:35] all the time so they study the
[1:21:37] opposition and then attack you with me
[1:21:40] so that's the way he is so so here
[1:21:42] here's this thing here's the thing God
[1:21:43] have this done to our science he have
[1:21:45] this done listen you can't fool him your
[1:21:48] car trick him
[1:22:01] which family can destroy this weak Boy
[1:22:04] Who he could cause some problems cause
[1:22:07] some drama get him out of thoughts you
[1:22:10] know he won them you know not be in
[1:22:12] alignment he don't want cohesion or you
[1:22:14] or you that's not at all you're cause
[1:22:17] I'm doing that so he goes around looking
[1:22:19] for the weak links as a matter of fact
[1:22:21] if you read the scripture he'll say he
[1:22:22] was walking up and down but he was
[1:22:24] passing he kept passenger somehow he
[1:22:27] didn't want to stop by job at all he
[1:22:29] didn't want to to go and meddle with job
[1:22:31] you know why because he said God God
[1:22:34] have a hedger on him God protecting him
[1:22:37] God have him favored and special God
[1:22:40] have a special plan and a purpose for
[1:22:42] him it's just like
[1:22:44] like
[1:22:45] as we go through the scripture we see
[1:22:48] that the devil has operate a particular
[1:22:50] way but we as men we as humans sometimes
[1:22:54] we can't anticipate what he going to do
[1:22:56] but God is always a few steps ahead so
[1:22:59] so God say listen let me choose a
[1:23:02] Brothers to get rid of him because you
[1:23:04] don't want to all them dreams you know
[1:23:05] we don't want you don't want the
[1:23:07] destruction we want things to go wrong
[1:23:09] we want things to go bad not knowing god
[1:23:11] already planned listen hear what I need
[1:23:14] to find a way for Joseph to move from
[1:23:16] his household to be in Egypt and be
[1:23:18] responsible for the food because if I
[1:23:20] could make you the Finance Minister if I
[1:23:22] could meet you the the leader of of of
[1:23:25] all the Grain and all the food you could
[1:23:27] help to sustain your farm your family
[1:23:29] and have such a name that you can have
[1:23:31] influence God thought by changing sorry
[1:23:35] say it untoward by changing laws and
[1:23:37] changing things and Esther was going to
[1:23:38] buckle and fail and fall and shovel up
[1:23:41] not knowing wait no that is exactly
[1:23:45] where I want you to be
[1:23:46] that is exactly the position I want you
[1:23:49] in because in that time when I call you
[1:23:52] to act I want to be in a particular
[1:23:55] place I don't want to be moping listen
[1:23:58] when you look at Jonah Jonah had a
[1:24:02] commission he knew exactly what was
[1:24:04] required of him but you know what he did
[1:24:06] excuses
[1:24:07] you say you know what then people Wicked
[1:24:10] the evil Van Damme get rid of them
[1:24:13] drawing them kill them you know I don't
[1:24:16] want to go there somebody else could go
[1:24:18] right by who pick somebody else not me I
[1:24:21] want another assignment I want another
[1:24:22] task but God's saying you're finished
[1:24:25] just like Moses you're done all right
[1:24:28] you're still going whether you like it
[1:24:30] or not he ran away that is mental
[1:24:33] his his emotions said hear what I want
[1:24:36] to escape God I run in far but little
[1:24:39] did he know remember what I said God
[1:24:41] works on both sides God already had a
[1:24:44] prepared fish you think the fish was
[1:24:45] born the day before
[1:24:47] God had a prepared vessel that's what it
[1:24:49] was we call call it a fish but was a
[1:24:52] prepared vessel to take Jonah exactly
[1:24:55] where God wanted exactly where God
[1:24:58] wanted him because brother Abraham said
[1:25:00] they worship a fish God
[1:25:02] so can you imagine you worship the fish
[1:25:04] God and God Almighty sent a man walking
[1:25:07] out of the fish to come and bring his
[1:25:09] word What a Mighty God be serve because
[1:25:13] I serve not easy you know he
[1:25:15] is determined that no matter what excuse
[1:25:18] you come up with how you try to flip it
[1:25:20] how you try to turn it whatever you try
[1:25:24] to put together he is not accepting that
[1:25:26] Moses after trained in Egypt listen
[1:25:30] he was what you call a diplomat a
[1:25:32] dignitary he was well trained
[1:25:35] and when he came face to face with the
[1:25:37] pillar of fire he said God
[1:25:40] I can't talk
[1:25:42] I don't know anything I can represent
[1:25:45] you I can go and free The Children of
[1:25:48] Israel at all
[1:25:49] God say you're finished
[1:25:51] that's the best you have that excuse
[1:25:54] when I look at my book of excuses here
[1:25:56] that one exhausted you know somebody use
[1:25:59] that already that car top thing we could
[1:26:01] fix that if your car talk I could send
[1:26:03] somebody to talk
[1:26:05] I could I could put something in place
[1:26:07] for that so I realized whatever your
[1:26:10] excuses tonight
[1:26:12] got bigger than that God don't deal with
[1:26:14] that already
[1:26:16] right he moved past that already he just
[1:26:19] requires that you do what he asked he
[1:26:22] wants you to be obedient he wants you to
[1:26:24] have the right attitude he wants you to
[1:26:25] say the right thing he don't want
[1:26:27] excuses when you fail and fall accept
[1:26:30] wrong
[1:26:31] surrender to him repent to him and move
[1:26:35] forward knowing that he is faithful and
[1:26:38] able to deliver and bless you
[1:26:40] exceedingly and abundantly above all you
[1:26:43] could ask or think every promise that he
[1:26:45] left is still there for you but you have
[1:26:48] to act upon it put away the excuses
[1:26:51] forget the excuses and plunge into the
[1:26:54] fullness of God God bless you
