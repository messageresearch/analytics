[39:39] that will take place in Jesus name we
[39:41] pray amen
[39:45] amen you love the Lord tonight
[39:48] if you have your Bibles I'd like to tune
[39:50] to a very very short scripture I just
[39:54] want to use that scripture as a context
[39:55] and then we'll expand in a little bit
[39:57] too man
[39:59] and the scripture comes from second
[40:00] Kings chapter 2 just verse 9.
[40:05] second Kings chapter 2.
[40:09] verse 9.
[40:16] and this this scripture speaks of Elijah
[40:18] and Elisha
[40:20] and in verse 9
[40:22] you could say man if you found it
[40:28] in verse 9 of chapter 2
[40:32] of Second Kings
[40:36] it says and it came to pass when they
[40:40] were gone over that Elijah said unto
[40:43] Elisha
[40:44] ask what I shall do for thee
[40:47] before I be taken away from thee
[40:50] and Elisha said I pray thee let a double
[40:54] portion of thy Spirit be upon me
[40:58] may the Lord add a blessing to the
[41:00] reading of his word you may be seated
[41:04] like I always say
[41:07] I'm not here to to speak my thoughts and
[41:09] my ideas but I'm here to share the word
[41:12] and this is what the Lord has placed
[41:14] upon my heart and this is what I'm going
[41:15] to share
[41:17] so for a title
[41:26] title tonight is you must respond
[41:27] quickly amen
[41:29] you must respond quickly
[41:32] that's what we've challenged to do
[41:35] that's what we've called upon to do to
[41:37] be able to respond quickly
[41:39] and find inspiration I said under
[41:41] expectation for God to speak
[41:44] amen
[41:46] so just uh to paint a picture
[41:50] or as a backdrop
[41:52] I want you to do a simple exercise with
[41:54] me we're just going to try to figure
[41:55] something out together amen
[41:58] and within the scripture I just want to
[42:00] say Time After Time
[42:02] we have seen
[42:04] God speak in various ways you've given
[42:07] instructions he's reproached folks he's
[42:10] you know he's dealt with people in a
[42:13] particular way
[42:14] but as I studied some of the scriptures
[42:17] I realized it was so important that you
[42:19] respond quickly and the reason we read
[42:20] that scripture in case we missed it is
[42:23] that
[42:24] Elijah and Elijah were walking together
[42:26] for a while
[42:28] there was no a modern occurrence they
[42:30] were moving together and they moved from
[42:32] place to place
[42:33] and
[42:34] as the scripture highlights it here
[42:36] there came a point which is in verse 9
[42:38] that we read it says and it came to pass
[42:41] when they were gone over
[42:43] that Elijah said unto Elisha who was
[42:45] with him all the time he said you know
[42:47] this this was his movement this was his
[42:49] time this is the point in which a season
[42:51] had changed and he says ask what I shall
[42:54] do for thee before I be taken away from
[42:56] thee because both you and everybody else
[42:58] know that I'll be taken away
[43:00] so this is your moment this is your time
[43:02] where I'm going to ask this is where
[43:04] you're gonna get the opportunity can you
[43:06] just imagine for a second
[43:08] if Elisha wasn't ready for that question
[43:12] the question is presented to you
[43:14] what would you like
[43:16] what would you like to see before I go
[43:19] and he looks at him stunned because he
[43:21] had never thought about it before
[43:24] he was awaiting to hear a word from the
[43:26] Lord but he never thought about it
[43:28] before can you imagine how different the
[43:30] scripture would have been
[43:31] but here he was prepared and he said I
[43:35] pray thee let a double portion of thy
[43:36] Spirit be upon me he was ready to
[43:39] respond almost immediately he knew
[43:41] exactly what he wanted and he was able
[43:44] to articulate it amen so
[43:48] that's the direction I'm going but I
[43:50] want us to go back a little bit
[43:52] I want you to work with me so we can
[43:55] establish a premise almost like in a
[43:57] classroom
[43:58] the premise I want to establish is that
[44:01] often times as Christians we try to
[44:04] figure things out
[44:06] you know we believe we get bright we
[44:08] read the scriptures twice and we say you
[44:09] know what
[44:11] I could figure it out
[44:13] so I want you to help me to explain a
[44:15] few things
[44:17] how do we explain
[44:18] Moses
[44:21] move in with over 2 million persons
[44:23] reaching up to the Red Sea and the Red
[44:25] Sea opening up on the Walking on dry
[44:26] land explain that to me how do we
[44:29] explain that
[44:31] I believe there is no way if I were to
[44:34] present this scenario to you there's no
[44:36] way you will come up with that being the
[44:38] solution
[44:39] in our finite Minds we can't see that
[44:41] being the answer but you know what
[44:45] God had that as the answer
[44:48] so Noah without an engineering degree
[44:51] without studying the oceans and and how
[44:54] to Traverse I mean imagine they built
[44:57] Titanic and they had the best of the
[44:59] best the best Craftsman the best
[45:01] material and it still failed but Noah
[45:04] would have taken go forward and Pitch it
[45:07] in and out and was able to survive a
[45:10] 40-day June day and night in a flood how
[45:13] do we explain that I want us to figure
[45:15] out together how Elisha could be
[45:18] elevated in a chariot of Fire
[45:20] how is that possible
[45:22] how Enoch was walking with God and and
[45:25] his testimony is that he pleased God and
[45:28] he was not he was found not amen how
[45:31] Joshua would have been instructed and
[45:34] given instructions to walk around the
[45:36] walls of Jericho once buddy and then
[45:39] seven times and he said when I bid you
[45:41] to shout and the walls
[45:44] thick enough for chariots to right or
[45:46] wrong came crumbling down how do we
[45:49] figure that out and I'm going somewhere
[45:52] with this how Samson a little guy
[45:54] brother Branham said he was almost
[45:56] sissified he was so small he was so
[45:58] simple yet he had Supernatural strength
[46:00] to lift up a gate
[46:02] and and to fight lions and stuff a show
[46:05] a bone of a donkey right how is that
[46:07] possible how Gideon fight with 300 men
[46:11] and and I use the word fighting Loosely
[46:13] there because he had lights and pictures
[46:15] and the enemy killed themselves fought
[46:17] each other how is that possible how do
[46:20] we explain
[46:22] the miracles of Jesus
[46:24] there's too much to mention so I'll just
[46:26] leave it as the miracles of Jesus how
[46:28] could we explain Peter walking on water
[46:30] how do we explain that but you know what
[46:33] that was an answer
[46:34] that God had predestinated to happen
[46:37] so we can't figure it out we can say you
[46:40] know what and what will happen
[46:42] because he kind of close to God he will
[46:45] walk on water no we can't figure that
[46:46] part out
[46:47] but it doesn't change the fact that that
[46:49] was the solution that God had
[46:52] how come Daniel was able to stand in a
[46:54] den of lions that were hungry and not be
[46:57] eaten
[47:00] how did Paul and Silas
[47:02] Brothers
[47:03] with such a remarkable duet singing at
[47:06] midnight and the prison bars she can
[47:08] open up and even the the prison officers
[47:11] outside realize listen we can't explain
[47:14] what's going on how do we figure out
[47:16] that out and the last one I have here is
[47:19] brother branham's Ministry it's too much
[47:20] to mention but how do we figure out that
[47:23] Elijah the reason I mention all that is
[47:25] because I came to a conclusion when I
[47:28] analyzed all of this and more is that I
[47:30] figured it out
[47:31] shocking it and what I figured is that
[47:34] it's not our purpose to figure it out
[47:38] it's not our objective and our goal it's
[47:41] not our mission God didn't predestinate
[47:43] that big sit down and try to figure out
[47:45] his next move
[47:47] that's not our responsibility that's not
[47:49] our rule I'll tell you your rule your
[47:52] rule is to respond quickly you see when
[47:54] he calls you have to answer
[47:56] you can't hesitate you can't deliberate
[47:59] I have news for you God is Not Looking
[48:00] for debaters
[48:02] he not looking for for people who could
[48:04] say well you know what here what
[48:06] if we approach it this way perhaps I
[48:10] know God said
[48:11] it will rain but what I think you really
[48:13] mean
[48:15] is that he usually as an acronym for
[48:18] something no he's not looking for that
[48:19] he's looking for people who could stand
[48:21] on his word no that's the promise that
[48:23] he laid out there and they could come
[48:25] and put things in place just the way he
[48:27] expected they do have to figure it out
[48:30] so we don't have to figure it out
[48:32] tonight we don't have to figure out the
[48:34] word of God the word is perfect we don't
[48:37] have to add a word you don't have to
[48:38] take away we don't have to do anything
[48:40] we just have to be obedient to the word
[48:42] of God and when he called me respond and
[48:45] respond quickly you see I've seen
[48:48] through the scripture time after time
[48:49] that God will give instructions
[48:52] he will say particular things
[48:54] and if you stay too long if you delay if
[48:57] you try to debate and try to figure it
[48:59] out yourself and your you know what I
[49:01] feel we better have a meeting and and
[49:03] let's let's have a vote let's see where
[49:05] where this goes
[49:06] you know you know he goes to
[49:10] God not laid back and like this and he
[49:14] just anything is everything no listen
[49:17] God is a very deliberate God very
[49:20] precise if he say come he won't you come
[49:23] if he say go he wants you go he don't
[49:25] want you
[49:29] I want to consult with my family a
[49:32] little bit if we could think about it
[49:34] give me two nights and I'll come back
[49:36] with a response no and I have examples
[49:39] like the young people say I have
[49:40] receipts I have proof I know exactly
[49:43] what I'm referring to you see
[49:46] I referenced Joshua earlier and there's
[49:48] something significant about Joshua and
[49:50] I'll read it for you there's a message
[49:52] as I was with Moses so I will be with
[49:55] thee
[49:56] and when brother Branham spoke that you
[49:58] know what he says about Joshua you say I
[50:00] want you to notice what's taking place
[50:01] Joshua when he come to his first
[50:03] campaign his first time to prove he was
[50:06] the real Joshua so before this he was
[50:09] untested uncharted waters everybody know
[50:12] yeah that's Joshua know but who really
[50:14] is Joshua so when it came time for him
[50:17] to prove that he was really the real
[50:20] Joshua you say Israel ought to have
[50:22] known that they were supposed to know
[50:24] but not everybody knew
[50:26] no doubt the clergy had a different idea
[50:29] they said now we'll just come here until
[50:32] spring time until summer time the Jordan
[50:34] will go down you know what I'm speaking
[50:36] about now they had an opportunity where
[50:38] they say they have to cross over but
[50:40] they drawed must High it was full it was
[50:42] muddy it was murky and we'll read it
[50:44] here and look like God throws some of
[50:47] the most foolish things in front
[50:49] of a spiritual Joshua brought him there
[50:52] in the month of April when the Jordan
[50:54] was three or four times its size so
[50:57] three or four times it's regular size
[50:59] that's when he brought him
[51:01] said he was trying him to see if he was
[51:04] really if he really was Joshua
[51:07] and paragraph 78 says let everything go
[51:10] wrong you see the point when you can't
[51:12] forget out it seemed impossible it
[51:15] seemed like this is not a logical thing
[51:17] to do this is not what your minds see
[51:19] and what your friend and your neighbor
[51:20] and your family and the great
[51:22] grandfather that you spoke to in a dream
[51:24] tell you something no no no no no that's
[51:26] not that at all this is let everything
[51:28] go wrong let everybody else Prosper let
[51:32] errors Prosper let the men who have a
[51:34] form of godliness deny the power thereof
[51:36] prosper and shove you back but if you
[51:39] know where you stand you'll stand
[51:41] regardless if the whole world turns you
[51:43] down you'll stand just the same you
[51:46] won't vary from the word the Jordan was
[51:48] three or four times its size spooky
[51:50] horrible looking muddy but Joshua said
[51:53] yeah what he said God said within three
[51:56] days we're going over and we're going
[51:58] over now the clergy would say now just a
[52:01] minute Joshua
[52:03] we are educated men we're smart many of
[52:07] us here Engineers from Egypt we know how
[52:10] to do these things so we'll just wait a
[52:12] little while until the stream clears up
[52:15] and we can walk across it isn't that
[52:17] much easier they even presented options
[52:19] but remember this was God testing the
[52:23] real Joshua
[52:25] he said I don't care what you think God
[52:27] said three days we're going over and
[52:29] we're going over we're going over in
[52:31] three days watch what Joshua did what
[52:34] did he put first the clergy no no sir he
[52:38] put the word first he said take that act
[52:40] and all your priests stay away from it
[52:42] get behind don't try to lead it let it
[52:45] lead you that's a trouble today we try
[52:48] to get ahead of the word and bypass and
[52:51] make the world to fit this to where to
[52:52] fit that bless your heart what we need
[52:55] today is to follow the word
[52:58] when it got to Jordan she opened up and
[53:01] they went over his first campaign
[53:04] put
[53:05] first things first he had a reason for
[53:08] that he had a reason because God had
[53:11] commissioned him stay with it with the
[53:13] word let the word do it every campaign
[53:16] the one fought in the battle because God
[53:18] had charged him to put the ark first
[53:20] after the arkman fought what went forth
[53:24] then singing players of instruments
[53:26] before the fight took place Hallelujah
[53:28] that's what we need today it's what we
[53:30] have this morning singers instrument
[53:32] playing music rejoicing then put the
[53:34] word first read the word then the battle
[53:37] sets in we're bound to win just got to
[53:39] win stay right with it keep its
[53:41] direction I'll keep you in the hour of
[53:43] trouble amen that's not my words
[53:46] that's his word put the word first
[53:49] whether you could figure it out or not
[53:51] whether you believe it's songs like it
[53:54] practical or it might work or we're not
[53:56] sure and the latest advisory says and
[53:59] and you know what the scientists say and
[54:01] an AI directing you a different
[54:03] direction at this point no what does the
[54:05] word see what did God say what are the
[54:08] instructions you have it has not changed
[54:10] no matter what systems change and
[54:14] government change and what whatever they
[54:16] may have changing all around us his word
[54:18] is still the same same yesterday today
[54:21] and forever not one adjustment to
[54:24] alteration you don't have to come and do
[54:26] Amendment say it it's still the same
[54:30] amen
[54:31] no
[54:34] I've read about about Elijah and we
[54:36] spoke a little bit about Elijah and
[54:38] Elisha earlier and you know in that that
[54:41] chapter and you don't have to find it in
[54:43] second Kings chapter two is interesting
[54:46] and I just want to read a little bit of
[54:48] it for you
[54:49] and it came to pass when the Lord would
[54:52] take up Elijah into Heaven by a
[54:54] whirlwind that Elijah went with Elisha
[54:57] from gilgal
[54:58] I want you to see something now
[55:01] and Elijah said unto Elisha tarry here I
[55:05] pray thee for the Lord had sent me to
[55:07] Bethel
[55:09] now this is the prophet tell you your
[55:12] partner tell you the person you're
[55:14] associated with tell you
[55:16] stay here relax because God called me to
[55:19] go a little further
[55:21] and Elijah said unto him as the Lord
[55:23] delivered
[55:25] and as I so liveth I will not leave thee
[55:28] so they went down to Bethel together I
[55:31] added with together they went down
[55:33] together so they were in Fellowship they
[55:36] were in harmony they were in
[55:37] conversation right now
[55:41] interest in development and the sons of
[55:43] the prophets that were at Bethel so they
[55:45] were going to battle and and the sons of
[55:47] the prophets were there
[55:49] the Kim Forte Elisha and said unto him
[55:52] nois thou that the Lord will take away
[55:54] thy master
[55:55] from thy head today
[55:57] and he said yeah I know it Whole New
[56:00] Year peace so what that tells us it
[56:02] wasn't a secret that Elijah was going
[56:04] you know
[56:06] it wasn't some surprise and a great
[56:08] mystery that Elijah was going that day
[56:11] the sons of the prophets Elijah said it
[56:14] himself it was open discussion that
[56:17] today he go in
[56:19] but they just wanted to make sure this
[56:21] man you're working with
[56:23] you know he going right
[56:24] they kind of check him a little bit you
[56:26] know he go in and he said yes holy peace
[56:28] just relax take it easy and it's a in
[56:32] verse 4
[56:33] and Elijah said unto him Elisha this is
[56:36] for the second time
[56:38] Terry here I pray thee I know it sounds
[56:41] like the same words
[56:42] but in verse 4 he said tarry here I pray
[56:45] thee for the Lord had sent me to Jericho
[56:47] the front location
[56:48] and he said as the Lord liveth this is
[56:51] in response and as I solve it I will not
[56:54] leave thee so they came to Jericho
[56:56] so they went a different location and
[56:58] are adding this word together
[57:00] they walk in together talking together
[57:02] fellowshipping together as they move
[57:03] from place to place and time after time
[57:06] Elijah would have told Elijah sorry take
[57:09] it easy relax God has called me to go a
[57:12] little further but it's okay if you take
[57:14] it easy
[57:16] and once again
[57:18] when he said that in verse 5
[57:21] and the sons of the prophets that were
[57:24] at Jericho so there were sons of the
[57:25] prophets at Battle now the sons of the
[57:27] Prophet said Jericho his sons of the
[57:29] Prophet said Jericho came to Elisha and
[57:32] said unto him knowest thou that the Lord
[57:35] will take away thy master from thy head
[57:37] today
[57:38] and he answered yea I know it hold your
[57:41] peace stop harassing me I know it it
[57:44] hasn't changed it's the same message we
[57:46] know he is going today hold your peace
[57:49] take it easy
[57:50] then in verse 6 Elisha said unto him
[57:53] Elijah sorry said unto him tari I pray
[57:57] thee here for the Lord had sent me to
[58:00] Jordan the front location Jordan now and
[58:03] he said as the Lord liveth and as I so
[58:05] love it same response I will not leave
[58:07] thee and there too went on
[58:11] now it said two went on all the time I
[58:14] said it went together right so two of
[58:16] them went on
[58:18] and 50
[58:20] and 5th 7 and 50
[58:21] 50 misunder the prophets went 50 of them
[58:23] and stood to view afar off
[58:27] now I want you to see something that
[58:29] change here
[58:31] in every example before in the two
[58:33] previous examples is sanity prophets
[58:35] would come to Elisha and say you realize
[58:38] it's the manual we're moving with the
[58:40] master will be taken away today you
[58:42] recognize that he went to another
[58:44] location you realize he'll be taken away
[58:46] today nothing changed however in this
[58:49] instance
[58:52] in verse 6 the Bible says the two of
[58:55] them went on
[58:57] and 50 of the sons of the Prophet stood
[59:01] to view a far off
[59:05] and there too
[59:07] stood by Jordan meaning Elijah and
[59:09] Elisha that too is TW the two of them
[59:12] stood by Jordan
[59:15] Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it
[59:17] together and smoothed the water and they
[59:19] were divided hidden to the so that
[59:23] they too went over on dry ground similar
[59:26] to the red City it's open up
[59:29] and they move and dry ground
[59:32] and it came to pass this is the scripted
[59:34] readilia and it came to pass when they
[59:36] were gone over
[59:37] Elijah said unto Elisha keep in mind at
[59:39] this stage you have no Sons or the
[59:41] prophets in your ears telling where he
[59:43] going right so it's just the two of you
[59:46] and Elijah said unto Elisha ask what I
[59:50] shall do for thee
[59:51] before I be taken away from thee
[59:54] and Elijah said and I will add in almost
[59:57] immediately because at this stage
[59:59] remember this is today he go in he
[1:00:01] didn't have a month to pray and fast
[1:00:03] about it he didn't say hear what this is
[1:00:06] a big thing let me call it pastor let me
[1:00:09] just do something here and I will come
[1:00:11] back to you but he was called upon to
[1:00:14] respond with a level of urgency he was
[1:00:16] called to respond quick
[1:00:18] because this season
[1:00:20] he now had an opportunity that he didn't
[1:00:23] have before although he was walking and
[1:00:25] talking and conversing and they had this
[1:00:27] relationship that they were moving this
[1:00:30] was the time in which God through the
[1:00:32] prophet was given him an opportunity to
[1:00:34] access something that he didn't have
[1:00:36] access to before so at this moment this
[1:00:39] very moment he was called upon to
[1:00:42] respond so he responded and he said I
[1:00:44] pray thee let a double portion of thy
[1:00:47] Spirit be upon me
[1:00:50] so
[1:00:51] as I looked at this I said you know
[1:00:55] how do you respond to the word of God
[1:00:58] how do you respond to the call of God
[1:01:00] how do you respond to God speaking if
[1:01:03] you're not prepared
[1:01:04] can you imagine imagine you have no bird
[1:01:07] not all
[1:01:09] and God was a drop down tonight by his
[1:01:11] spirit and said
[1:01:12] anything you ask you shall have
[1:01:15] but you have no burden
[1:01:17] what you're asking for
[1:01:19] what you're asking for
[1:01:21] all right so imagine the opportunity and
[1:01:24] I know there are numerous examples that
[1:01:25] example is the sahati right
[1:01:27] when the prophet said listen anything
[1:01:29] you ask
[1:01:30] can you imagine if she wasn't prepared
[1:01:32] so it means we should be thinking
[1:01:36] about the ways we could respond if God
[1:01:38] were to to present the opportunity to us
[1:01:40] tonight and you say listen you can have
[1:01:42] what you will anything you want you
[1:01:45] could be healed you could be your
[1:01:48] children could be restored you can have
[1:01:50] a financial breakthrough whatever it is
[1:01:53] whatever you have need of you can get
[1:01:55] out tonight what would be your response
[1:01:58] because he call upon you to respond in
[1:02:01] his he called upon you to respond
[1:02:03] quickly you don't have time to say well
[1:02:05] Lord
[1:02:06] um perhaps if you ask me this after the
[1:02:08] holiday because I have some plans so
[1:02:10] perhaps on Friday or Saturday we want to
[1:02:13] have a power at that point so if you
[1:02:15] check my after that I will be in the
[1:02:17] atmosphere to respond no
[1:02:20] the Holy Spirit
[1:02:22] could come tonight
[1:02:24] and present to you the opportunity for
[1:02:26] Lying Eyes a purple pun for the sick to
[1:02:30] be healed for for the death to hear
[1:02:33] listen the afflictions that you think
[1:02:36] are Troublesome and big in the eyes of
[1:02:39] God
[1:02:40] be already established that we don't
[1:02:42] have to worry about it we don't have to
[1:02:44] worry about the job and the trouble some
[1:02:46] neighbor and the environment and the
[1:02:48] community and who say something about
[1:02:50] you we don't have to figure that part
[1:02:52] out perhaps God is just testing the real
[1:02:54] you to see how you're going to respond
[1:02:57] right now what I observe is that he call
[1:03:01] upon you to respond quickly in a
[1:03:03] particular way but you have to be
[1:03:05] prepared in order to give a an account
[1:03:08] in order to give a response in our way
[1:03:10] so I went on and I looked at at any Book
[1:03:13] of Luke
[1:03:15] a simple scripture that we all familiar
[1:03:17] with and it speaks about Mary and just
[1:03:19] as a background I would say the angel
[1:03:22] Gabriel visited Mary
[1:03:24] and similar to Elijah and Elijah had a
[1:03:27] lot of conversation with her said how
[1:03:30] are you going hear this I want to tell
[1:03:32] you something
[1:03:34] I know you might have read before
[1:03:36] that Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive
[1:03:40] but that was a long time ago it's over
[1:03:42] 400 years and you are really the kind of
[1:03:45] person that we were looking for and we
[1:03:47] believe true you this could happen you
[1:03:48] know and he had a lot of conversation
[1:03:50] and this discourse with her but there
[1:03:53] came a point
[1:03:55] as they were conversing that she had a
[1:03:58] question almost like a burning question
[1:04:00] and I will read it for you
[1:04:03] in the Book of Luke
[1:04:07] chapter 1 verse 34 to 41.
[1:04:11] forgive me if I read too much tonight
[1:04:13] but the word of God is so sweet I can't
[1:04:16] explain it like this the way it says it
[1:04:19] here is perfect so from verse 34 it says
[1:04:22] then said Mary unto the angel
[1:04:26] how shall this be
[1:04:28] seeing I know not a man that was a
[1:04:30] question
[1:04:31] I want you to observe some something
[1:04:32] that
[1:04:34] prior to this
[1:04:35] they were back and forth he was talking
[1:04:37] telling her Plenty things this is how
[1:04:40] the child will be this is what was
[1:04:42] promised yeah but there came a point in
[1:04:44] which he asked how shall this be seeing
[1:04:47] I know not a man
[1:04:49] and the angel answered and said unto how
[1:04:51] the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee this
[1:04:54] was the directive right the Holy Ghost
[1:04:56] shall come upon thee and the power of
[1:04:58] the highest shall overshadow thee
[1:05:00] therefore also that Holy thing which
[1:05:03] shall be born of thee shall be called
[1:05:05] the son of God
[1:05:07] and behold this was an addition and
[1:05:11] behold
[1:05:13] this is not the question she asked so he
[1:05:15] added this because she asked how shall
[1:05:18] this be he said in verse 36 and behold
[1:05:22] that cousin Elizabeth
[1:05:24] she hath also conceived a son in her old
[1:05:26] age and this is the sixth month with her
[1:05:29] who was called Baron so you and I know
[1:05:33] she was Barren in the past but I'm
[1:05:35] telling you although everybody may not
[1:05:37] know she is six months pregnant now
[1:05:41] for with God nothing shall be impossible
[1:05:44] keep in mind this is the Angel sharing
[1:05:46] this
[1:05:47] in verse 38 and I see this as the
[1:05:49] critical part
[1:05:50] he says and Mary said behold the
[1:05:54] handmaid of the Lord
[1:05:55] be it unto me according to Thy word now
[1:05:58] I want you to observe she didn't say you
[1:06:00] know what you say there's some kind of
[1:06:02] good if you could just allow me I just
[1:06:04] want to Whatsapp my cousin and see if
[1:06:06] she really pregnant because it shares
[1:06:08] some information here that I want to
[1:06:10] verify I want to make a call as a matter
[1:06:12] of fact if you could wait right here I
[1:06:14] just go in by my cousin and come back
[1:06:16] because these things are saying some
[1:06:18] kind of impossible although it says is
[1:06:20] possible I just she didn't respond like
[1:06:23] that
[1:06:24] she was called upon to respond quickly
[1:06:26] they heard her response in verse 30th
[1:06:28] and Mary said behold the handmaid of the
[1:06:31] Lord be it unto me according to Thy Word
[1:06:35] and check check this out and the angel
[1:06:37] departed from her so the angel didn't
[1:06:40] stick around why his job was over he
[1:06:42] delivered him the message and he got the
[1:06:45] response he expected she responded
[1:06:48] quickly and said hey be it unto me I am
[1:06:51] not going to try to figure this out if
[1:06:53] this is what a word said this is what I
[1:06:55] hold into this is the promise I stuck in
[1:06:57] with and it goes further in verse 39 it
[1:07:00] says and Mary arose in those days and
[1:07:02] went into the Hill Country with haste
[1:07:05] she didn't slowly go you know she didn't
[1:07:07] say well boy you know I met an angel
[1:07:09] yesterday
[1:07:11] I have a testimony I met an angel last
[1:07:14] week I just want us to have a barbecue
[1:07:16] and we can discuss the fact that I met
[1:07:19] her angel last week no that was my
[1:07:21] attitude her mindset was listen be it
[1:07:23] unto me and marry a rose and she went
[1:07:26] into the Hill Country with his into the
[1:07:28] city of Judah and entered the house of
[1:07:31] Zacharias and saluted Elizabeth so she
[1:07:34] went up at once it reminded Caleb when
[1:07:37] the spies came back and they said you
[1:07:39] know it had creeps and it had Giants and
[1:07:41] we see the ups and downs and you know
[1:07:44] you know the kind of thing and the urban
[1:07:46] flew and we'd say if we could plan
[1:07:48] better we should probably build up the
[1:07:50] military a little bit and do six months
[1:07:52] of training and if we could you know
[1:07:54] perhaps get some snipers involved go
[1:07:57] behind the enemy lights what about if we
[1:07:58] devise a tactical plan what about if we
[1:08:01] sit down that sounds like a good idea
[1:08:02] and we get a general you know what it's
[1:08:04] best we get a general because we have 12
[1:08:06] different tribes so they may have 12
[1:08:08] different mindsets so you know what how
[1:08:10] about if we get two representatives from
[1:08:12] each group no that was not the approach
[1:08:14] he said listen as a short man he stood
[1:08:17] up on a box and he said let us go up at
[1:08:19] once because he knew that the word said
[1:08:22] this land was promised unto them and
[1:08:25] Joshua said every place you put your
[1:08:28] foot is yours so there was no time to
[1:08:30] waste there was no time to to sit down
[1:08:33] and relax and think about it they were
[1:08:36] responding quickly to the word of God to
[1:08:39] see that promise made manifest amen
[1:08:45] in the last verse of that chapter in
[1:08:48] verse 31 well it says and it came to
[1:08:51] pass that when Elizabeth heard the
[1:08:53] salutation of Mary because you heard
[1:08:55] that Mary Rand Elizabeth she went on
[1:08:58] with his and and she she went into the
[1:09:01] house of Zacharias and and saluted
[1:09:03] Elizabeth and it came to pass that when
[1:09:05] Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary
[1:09:08] The Babe left in her womb and Elizabeth
[1:09:10] was
[1:09:12] filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:09:15] that was the that was the by-product of
[1:09:17] the response so she got the word
[1:09:20] she accept the word she didn't question
[1:09:22] it she didn't say well you know what I
[1:09:25] really want to consult with my family
[1:09:27] about this you know because this Angel
[1:09:29] thing I don't know anybody in my
[1:09:31] generation at the angel really visiting
[1:09:33] us so what I want to do I want to put it
[1:09:35] up and insert is it okay if we take a
[1:09:36] selfie and I put it on Instagram just to
[1:09:39] see if anybody else knows this Angel no
[1:09:41] no no no no no no no no
[1:09:44] she was so convinced
[1:09:46] of the word of God I was shared by that
[1:09:49] angel
[1:09:50] that she went accepted responded and
[1:09:53] went with hist to Elizabeth a cousin and
[1:09:57] you could see as a result when she did
[1:09:59] that salutation
[1:10:01] The Babe left and Elizabeth was filled
[1:10:04] with the Holy Ghost
[1:10:08] I mean it is profound to me that we
[1:10:11] could look at the scripture and we see
[1:10:12] the examples we see these signs we see
[1:10:14] the historical empirical evidence that
[1:10:17] suggests that no matter how we dis it
[1:10:20] how you flip it how you try to turn it
[1:10:22] how you try to study this thing we
[1:10:24] catholicated
[1:10:26] I can't figure it out you can't figure
[1:10:28] it out what he calls for is a level of
[1:10:30] faith
[1:10:31] that is why you said listen it doesn't
[1:10:33] matter your qualifications or your level
[1:10:36] of literacy your education you know he
[1:10:39] say listen he could reveal himself to
[1:10:41] the most illiterate person
[1:10:44] he don't need your degree he don't need
[1:10:46] your passes he don't need that all he
[1:10:48] look for is that that seed of faith that
[1:10:50] he plant in your soul that could be
[1:10:52] activated such that you could hear his
[1:10:56] word and accept his word and respond
[1:10:57] accordingly
[1:10:59] oftentimes I started by saying videos
[1:11:02] get too bright
[1:11:03] we try to apply logic we try to apply
[1:11:06] all kind of practical advice and what we
[1:11:08] think might be best suited to this
[1:11:10] scenario but all God calls for
[1:11:13] is for faith in his word belief in his
[1:11:16] word and to respond accordingly
[1:11:19] and you will see the manifestation of
[1:11:21] his word and you will see the
[1:11:22] acceleration of his promises in your
[1:11:24] life you know I could recall Jacob we
[1:11:28] often hear the story Jacob wrestling
[1:11:30] with the angel he wrestled all night
[1:11:33] and you wrestle he wrestle you wrestle
[1:11:35] wrestle until it was a Breaking of the
[1:11:37] day and at that point the angel said
[1:11:39] listen here what I I fight up enough
[1:11:42] here you know this fight how long this
[1:11:44] fight going on just now it's day time
[1:11:46] this all night we're fighting what
[1:11:48] really going on as a matter of fact we
[1:11:51] could recall he he touched his side and
[1:11:54] and his from the outer joints right so
[1:11:57] he had a limp afterwards because this
[1:11:59] was the by-product of the fight but you
[1:12:01] know what there came a point in which a
[1:12:03] question was asked
[1:12:06] I know we see the trend
[1:12:08] we see when the season change
[1:12:11] and these opportunities opportunities
[1:12:13] arise somehow our question is always us
[1:12:16] and when they asked Jacob the question
[1:12:21] he say what
[1:12:23] I am Jacob
[1:12:24] I am a trickster I'm a shyster I'm a I'm
[1:12:28] a smart man I'm a man listen if you give
[1:12:29] me a chance I outsmart you but you say
[1:12:32] from this default
[1:12:34] because I could see
[1:12:36] I asked the question and your response
[1:12:38] your quick response is that listen I
[1:12:40] can't stay here I can't stay hiding from
[1:12:42] my brother I can't stay hiding from from
[1:12:45] what might await down the road I can
[1:12:47] stay looking over my shoulder looking to
[1:12:50] see if I could devise a plan to escape
[1:12:51] the enemy I need a change tonight I need
[1:12:54] a change right now listen his name was
[1:12:57] changed the work was changed the talk
[1:13:00] was changed the attitude was changed
[1:13:02] what happened based on his response
[1:13:05] they met his need right there he didn't
[1:13:08] have to take a day he didn't have to
[1:13:09] take a month he didn't have to go to a
[1:13:11] worship service and sing two songs but
[1:13:14] he was so convinced he was so ready that
[1:13:17] once the question was asked what's the
[1:13:19] opportunity arose he was in a position
[1:13:21] to respond and accept it catch a hole
[1:13:24] using faith and seeing listen that's
[1:13:26] mine that's what I want that's a change
[1:13:28] I want
[1:13:30] I also think about that thief on the
[1:13:33] cross you know
[1:13:34] I know we often highlight him and I
[1:13:37] think it's such a powerful story
[1:13:39] because this thief was a real Thief I
[1:13:41] always remember brother Brian said
[1:13:42] listen be the best at what you could be
[1:13:44] you say if I'm a bomb I'd be the best
[1:13:46] bomb man I will eat out of the digital
[1:13:49] tears garbage
[1:13:50] if I'm a mailman I'll be the best
[1:13:52] mailman
[1:13:53] whatever you are if I'm a doctor I'll be
[1:13:56] the best doctor I could find
[1:13:58] this thief was a real Thief
[1:14:00] he was not jokative
[1:14:01] as a matter of fact I'm pretty sure
[1:14:05] fatal crucify as if
[1:14:07] he had to be a real revolutionary Thief
[1:14:09] a relative this is not somebody you just
[1:14:13] take two mangoes and you go down the
[1:14:15] road this is a man with a he was a
[1:14:17] seasoned creative career criminal they
[1:14:20] had it old Fame this was no wrongfully
[1:14:22] accused they had all his stats when
[1:14:25] apology rap sheet the rap might
[1:14:27] have been so long you say listen we even
[1:14:30] want to read everything crucifixion
[1:14:32] cross for you
[1:14:34] but you know what
[1:14:36] when Jesus
[1:14:39] put between those thieves on the cross
[1:14:45] and wanted
[1:14:47] had an attitude
[1:14:49] save yourself
[1:14:52] and to use King of the Jews and he was a
[1:14:54] boss and you could do all things
[1:14:57] he had a particular attitude
[1:15:00] and there was another thief and this
[1:15:03] thief saw things a little different
[1:15:05] he saw that he sees not change and an
[1:15:07] opportunity arose and and how he
[1:15:10] responded will dictate or determine the
[1:15:12] outcome of the next step
[1:15:15] and he said you know
[1:15:18] remember me
[1:15:20] I know I bad you know
[1:15:22] I know there's nothing good about me I
[1:15:24] know I deserve to be here
[1:15:26] I know I get what I sign up for because
[1:15:29] this is the life I live this is the part
[1:15:31] I choose but I want you to remember me
[1:15:33] because I know
[1:15:36] you don't deserve this
[1:15:38] and Jesus responded at that point
[1:15:41] yes and said hey you know what this tea
[1:15:45] not tomorrow not next week not next year
[1:15:49] you will be with me in Paradise
[1:15:51] and not leaving things a chance and not
[1:15:54] going and say well we'll see how it work
[1:15:56] out
[1:15:56] not God
[1:15:58] is so direct remember early on I say
[1:16:01] he's deliberate
[1:16:02] he don't play around
[1:16:04] if he say go
[1:16:06] he know you're going you know he
[1:16:08] predestinate that you know if he said
[1:16:10] trials them trials are yours you know
[1:16:13] don't get quiet now if you say trials
[1:16:16] them trials are yours
[1:16:18] he already know the outcome you know the
[1:16:20] end before the beginning that's why he
[1:16:23] says alpha omega beginning and the end
[1:16:25] first and last when job had his
[1:16:28] opportunity when season changed think
[1:16:31] about it they were moving to and through
[1:16:33] to and through
[1:16:35] I don't know
[1:16:38] imagine this listen I'm not even
[1:16:40] bothering my job because you are hedge
[1:16:41] around him
[1:16:42] he is protected he's well protected
[1:16:44] we're not even going to interfere with
[1:16:46] him because he have surveillance he have
[1:16:48] cameras he have spikes he had dogs he
[1:16:51] have I mean
[1:16:53] the military really monitoring what's
[1:16:55] going on the car infiltrate that at all
[1:16:58] and God said listen is that right let me
[1:17:00] tell you something the kind of character
[1:17:01] job have take a crack at him do him what
[1:17:04] you want flip him upside down carry him
[1:17:07] through the fire the flood you name it
[1:17:09] just don't take his life do what you
[1:17:11] want
[1:17:12] and God was so convinced
[1:17:15] that job was going to respond the right
[1:17:18] way
[1:17:20] I keep saying when the season change a
[1:17:22] question is almost always asked not to
[1:17:25] almost always ask
[1:17:26] the turning point for job was when his
[1:17:30] wife his beautiful lovely wife of his
[1:17:32] youth would have come to him and say
[1:17:35] honey
[1:17:37] hear what
[1:17:38] we've been through thick and thin
[1:17:40] we've seen business good and bad we've
[1:17:43] we've seen the vows tested but at this
[1:17:46] stage here we're going on
[1:17:48] just because God and I
[1:17:50] why you do because there's a question
[1:17:53] presented why not just do that because
[1:17:56] we don't really have a choice but
[1:17:57] remember what I said you see we are not
[1:17:59] in a position to try to figure out
[1:18:01] what's God going to do and how he's
[1:18:03] going to do it why he's going to do it
[1:18:05] there was a man that was blind when
[1:18:07] Jesus was on the scene and they came and
[1:18:09] said hear what master
[1:18:11] sin why is he blind why is he in this
[1:18:15] condition we know something is wrong for
[1:18:17] him to be afflicted in this week
[1:18:20] and Jesus answered and said listen it's
[1:18:22] not mother father it's not what you
[1:18:24] think it's not your ability to watch it
[1:18:27] and feel you could
[1:18:28] figure out this scenario that's not your
[1:18:31] rule that's not your purpose when you
[1:18:33] think about it I have read true
[1:18:35] scriptures and I see listen we
[1:18:37] complicate this thing you know
[1:18:39] people
[1:18:40] it real simple
[1:18:41] imagine and I'll get back to those
[1:18:45] we live in a time we live in an era in
[1:18:48] which people like to find things there
[1:18:49] are those who will sit in church and we
[1:18:51] know there are three types of believers
[1:18:53] and there's a kind of like to find fault
[1:18:56] they find this too loud it's too soft
[1:18:59] they find these two two Darkness to
[1:19:01] light they find we should sing faster
[1:19:03] some slow song Whatever It Is they find
[1:19:05] a lot of stuff
[1:19:06] when all God asks you to find
[1:19:09] it's defining promises applicable to
[1:19:11] your life you know
[1:19:13] he say
[1:19:15] when is son of man come at shall he find
[1:19:17] faith
[1:19:19] that's what you should be looking for
[1:19:21] not fault and and trials and struggles
[1:19:23] and and this Wonder of me the wrong way
[1:19:25] this one embarrassed man this one make
[1:19:27] me feel bad I don't like the way he
[1:19:29] walked past me and he didn't shake my
[1:19:31] hand no
[1:19:32] he wants to find faith
[1:19:34] you want your fine promises
[1:19:37] if your must find fault find fault with
[1:19:39] what the devil has done to the young
[1:19:41] people if you want to find fault find
[1:19:44] fault with how he has allowed people to
[1:19:47] become so distracted and caught up with
[1:19:50] things of this world that they forget to
[1:19:52] pray
[1:19:53] if you want to find anything find the
[1:19:55] altar
[1:19:56] find yourself at the alt and pray cry
[1:19:59] out unto God for the Holy Ghost for the
[1:20:03] talking cry out
[1:20:05] so that ceiling Angel could come by you
[1:20:08] tonight
[1:20:09] and do something for you that you could
[1:20:11] be healed and delivered tonight not
[1:20:14] tomorrow that we're not Angel come and
[1:20:17] say listen what will thou have me to do
[1:20:21] tonight that you could respond quickly
[1:20:23] that you know exactly the promises that
[1:20:27] are laid out and outlined for you to be
[1:20:29] receiving
[1:20:30] that's the things we should find not
[1:20:33] drama and bacchanal not gossip and
[1:20:35] fasting and stewing and fighting and and
[1:20:37] church politics no
[1:20:40] we must find where our name is written
[1:20:43] we must find the things applicable to us
[1:20:46] in this hour
[1:20:48] not foolishness
[1:20:50] there are things that will just waste
[1:20:52] your time
[1:20:54] there are things that are in my mind
[1:20:56] sometimes are meant you know on the
[1:20:58] internet now it has something called
[1:20:59] trolls
[1:21:01] trolls are people things they're robots
[1:21:04] and all kind of stuff men to just
[1:21:06] distract you from reality
[1:21:09] just throw you off
[1:21:12] so you have a Target you want a rich X
[1:21:14] place and something pulling you this way
[1:21:17] something pulling you that way we want
[1:21:20] to be single-eyed we want to be focused
[1:21:23] on the mark of the High Calling we want
[1:21:25] to be able to run a race
[1:21:27] knowing that you started this work is
[1:21:32] able to take us straight through till
[1:21:34] the end you see he's never made a
[1:21:36] promise that he cannot fulfill
[1:21:39] his word will never return void in the
[1:21:42] example with Mary when Isaiah prophesied
[1:21:45] that a virgin shall conceive it didn't
[1:21:48] happen I don't know it didn't happen in
[1:21:50] a year or a month or a decade
[1:21:53] generation after generation would have
[1:21:55] passed this information on that you know
[1:21:57] what a virgin shall conceive
[1:22:00] in my time so you know what I I changed
[1:22:03] the concept perhaps when the sad virgin
[1:22:06] what they meant no
[1:22:08] his word is perfectional
[1:22:12] and it's not listen when I think about
[1:22:15] this I realize
[1:22:16] Although our responsibility might be
[1:22:18] great look how easy it is
[1:22:21] imagine we don't have the responsibility
[1:22:24] to figure out God's Next Step think
[1:22:27] about that
[1:22:29] so God knows you're gonna be here
[1:22:31] tonight you couldn't stay home if you're
[1:22:33] tried you know you know that
[1:22:35] you couldn't even stay home if you're
[1:22:37] tried you had an appointment before the
[1:22:41] foundation of the world
[1:22:43] to be here tonight and hear what you
[1:22:45] hear
[1:22:46] you were specially chosen to be here
[1:22:48] tonight
[1:22:49] and for those on the internet you could
[1:22:52] miss this if you try to know you may be
[1:22:55] doing whatever you're doing but tonight
[1:22:56] you're hard to hear this
[1:22:58] no matter what happened yesterday what
[1:23:00] happened last night what happened
[1:23:02] earlier perhaps you wasn't feeling too
[1:23:03] good you couldn't miss this one you know
[1:23:06] this this was predestinated for you you
[1:23:09] know
[1:23:10] don't even try to figure it out you know
[1:23:13] and we've heard it over and over
[1:23:16] healing and blessing and and gifts and
[1:23:20] callings and stuff sometimes it's really
[1:23:21] really always tied to your ability to
[1:23:25] respond quickly
[1:23:27] not just to rock back and say you know
[1:23:30] what he said some interesting
[1:23:33] perhaps what was said on Sunday I want
[1:23:36] to look over the table
[1:23:38] but while the word goes forward if it's
[1:23:41] a genuine honor unulcerated without God
[1:23:43] we
[1:23:44] because by your faith you'll behold by
[1:23:47] your faith you'll be made well by your
[1:23:49] ability to respond quickly and correctly
[1:23:51] you'll see what I mean
