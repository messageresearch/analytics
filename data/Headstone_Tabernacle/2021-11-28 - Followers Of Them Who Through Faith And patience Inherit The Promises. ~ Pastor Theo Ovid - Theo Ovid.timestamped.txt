[34:58] we want to read from verse 7 to 13
[35:01] and hebrews 6 we want to read from 10 to
[35:03] 15. and before we read it let's boyce
[35:06] one more time heavenly father i pray
[35:08] that you would bless the word this
[35:09] morning may it inspire your people who
[35:12] are needy of you in this treacherous and
[35:15] perilous time that we live in granted
[35:16] lord in jesus name i ask it email and
[35:19] amen
[35:20] so you want to read romans 9
[35:22] and hebrews 6.
[35:30] okay
[35:47] all right romans 9 reading verse 7
[35:49] neither because they are the seed of
[35:51] abraham are they all children
[35:53] but in isaac shall i see be called
[35:56] that is they which are the children of
[35:58] the flesh these
[35:59] are not
[36:00] the children of god
[36:02] but the children of the promise
[36:05] are counted for the seed
[36:07] for this word of promise at this time
[36:10] will i come and sarah shall have a son
[36:13] and not only this but when rebecca also
[36:15] had conceived by one even by our father
[36:18] isaac
[36:19] for the children being not yet born
[36:22] neither haven't done any good or evil
[36:24] that the purpose of god
[36:26] according to election might stand not of
[36:29] works but of him that call it it was
[36:32] said unto her the elder
[36:34] shall save the younger as it is written
[36:36] jacob have i loved but esau have i hated
[36:40] and reading from
[36:42] hebrews 6 10
[36:44] for god is not unrighteous to forget
[36:46] your work and labor of love
[36:49] which you have showed towards his name
[36:51] in that you have ministered to the
[36:52] saints and do minister
[36:54] and we desire that every one of you do
[36:57] show the same diligence to the full
[36:59] assurance of hope unto the end that ye
[37:02] be not
[37:03] that ye be not slutful but followers of
[37:06] them who true faith and patience inherit
[37:09] the promises
[37:11] for when god
[37:12] made promise to abraham because he could
[37:15] not swear by no greater he swayed by
[37:18] himself
[37:19] saying surely blessed i will bless you
[37:21] and multiply and i will multiply thee
[37:23] and so after you're patiently endured he
[37:25] obtained the promise may god bless his
[37:27] word you may be seated oh praise god
[37:29] it's really good to be here it's a
[37:31] privilege
[37:32] to be in the house of god despite the
[37:34] pandemic despite the virus this fight in
[37:37] mutations and all the variations despite
[37:40] all of that but the church of the living
[37:42] god press right on
[37:44] oh blessed be the name of the lord so
[37:46] this morning our title the followers of

[56:37] too bad it has to do that but human
[56:39] beings are so slutful in their mind it
[56:41] takes a state of emergency something
[56:43] arises and when they do it it shows them
[56:45] into a desperation and then it shows
[56:48] what you're made out of
[56:49] you save the water dripping in a form of
[56:51] pipe in the house no problem a dripping
[56:53] drip drip drip your water they get
[56:55] dripping dripping you tighten it it's
[56:57] still dripping yeah fix it a month
[56:59] passed it's still dripping that's not a
[57:00] problem man you know the emergency as
[57:02] far as they're concerned it's just a
[57:03] driven pipe but let's fire us at the
[57:05] burner

[57:19] you lose your house you lose your car
[57:20] you lose everything you know burn down
[57:22] flat
[57:23] so you see certain things go to love and
[57:26] bring and put the pressure on us for us
[57:28] to get desperate
[57:30] oh my
[57:31] hebrews 12 read in verse 14 to 17 follow
[57:34] peace after all men and holiness without
[57:37] which no man shall see the lord
[57:39] looking diligently least any man feel of

[59:40] [Music]
[59:43] you may be seated
[59:44] now when you see that way you will
[59:46] understand in context when jesus said he
[59:49] needs patches of maria because he had to
[59:51] meet the woman at the well you
[59:53] understand now he was looking for that
[59:54] name
[59:55] her name could be mary jerry whatever

[1:00:05] on earth but not in heaven we'll give
[1:00:07] the lord some praises

[1:00:10] so watch looking diligent at least any
[1:00:12] man fail of the grace of god listen the
[1:00:14] root of bitterness is springing up
[1:00:15] trouble you and thereby many be defiled
[1:00:17] least there be any fornicator
[1:00:20] or
[1:00:21] profane person
[1:00:22] as
[1:00:23] esau
[1:00:25] who for one most of them meat
[1:00:27] sold his birthright
[1:00:30] and
[1:00:31] for you know that afterwards
[1:00:34] when he would have inherited the
[1:00:36] blessing he was rejected
[1:00:38] for he found no place of repentance
[1:00:41] though he sorted carefully with tears
[1:00:45] [Applause]
[1:00:47] so esau crossed a line and he couldn't
[1:00:49] get back
[1:00:51] with tears
[1:00:53] he sorted carefully
[1:00:54] and it didn't come true
[1:00:57] and the bible exists adobe like that
[1:00:59] for one more cell of food
[1:01:02] he was willing to give up his birthright
[1:01:05] for a muscle of food
[1:01:15] we find out esau
[1:01:17] truly represented the canal believer
[1:01:20] he was an earthly man
[1:01:22] was of the earth was very religious
[1:01:24] inclined religious incline he had a
[1:01:26] religion just like the world today
[1:01:28] man here we go is not the property of
[1:01:31] the church
[1:01:33] a lot of the pastors of the church has
[1:01:34] their own property
[1:01:36] that's not what the bible says i don't
[1:01:37] know what the prophet teaching you man
[1:01:39] is not the property of the church
[1:01:41] neither is man the property of the state
[1:01:44] man is the property of god
[1:01:48] sons and daughters of god we belong to
[1:01:50] him because we are bought
[1:01:53] with a price
[1:01:55] what a precious price
[1:01:57] the son of god
[1:01:59] oh glory to god so no man own you
[1:02:02] oh give the lord a shout not church on
[1:02:04] you
[1:02:05] no pastor owner come hither i will
[1:02:08] surely the bride
[1:02:10] the lamb's wife
[1:02:11] or give the lord some praises
[1:02:14] esau
[1:02:15] well represented that group of being
[1:02:17] religious
[1:02:18] i'm just as good as the next one
[1:02:20] my religion is just as good as yours i
[1:02:22] am satisfied
[1:02:24] but jacob his twin brother
[1:02:26] by election
[1:02:27] which was predestination
[1:02:29] by foreign knowledge came into this
[1:02:31] world and was a spiritual man to
[1:02:34] represent the spiritual people
[1:02:37] what
[1:02:38] jacob came to represent the spiritual
[1:02:40] people
[1:02:41] you mean trickster jacob
[1:02:43] you mean scamp jacob your means called
[1:02:46] dog jacob
[1:02:47] you mean jacob that trying to defraud
[1:02:49] everybody of everything he represent the
[1:02:51] spiritual
[1:02:52] yes because when you're past the natural
[1:02:54] part you recognize he's hungering for
[1:02:56] righteousness and he's hungering for the
[1:02:58] holy ghost and he intend to get it by
[1:03:01] any means necessary if it means cooking
[1:03:04] a good piece of lentil for his brother
[1:03:07] to offer that birthright he going to do
[1:03:09] it or give the lord a shout
[1:03:12] my god and i'm looking at the bride this
[1:03:14] morning they're gonna get that extra oil
[1:03:18] by any means
[1:03:19] necessary
[1:03:21] or give the lord a shout
[1:03:23] don't let nobody keep it back from that
[1:03:25] oil
[1:03:26] [Music]
[1:03:31] he he had spiritualism of what was right
[1:03:33] and wrong and the entire church of the
[1:03:36] living god is built upon revelation of
[1:03:38] jesus christ and we know what jesus told
[1:03:39] peter upon this rock i will be my church
[1:03:41] and that was spiritual revelation isn't
[1:03:43] that right praise god no jacob it meant
[1:03:45] so much to him but the birthright meant
[1:03:47] nothing to eso
[1:03:49] frankly he despised it and i say this
[1:03:51] with all reverences children still does
[1:03:53] that's right and despises it what do i
[1:03:55] have to do for them why should i receive
[1:03:57] the holy ghost
[1:03:58] i am just as good as you are
[1:04:00] my religion just as good as yours why
[1:04:01] should i go up to up there i'm just as
[1:04:03] good as you are i go to church i got my
[1:04:05] name in the church book
[1:04:08] got my team in the book
[1:04:10] that's what you are that's what you are
[1:04:11] in the sight of god you've got to be
[1:04:13] born again and be spiritual minded
[1:04:16] so it didn't mean anything to esau he
[1:04:18] despised it
[1:04:19] and the carnal believer today still
[1:04:21] despises the boot right and the
[1:04:23] birthright is the holy spirit how come
[1:04:25] you don't hear that much but the
[1:04:27] birthright is still the holy spirit
[1:04:29] you have to fight for it
[1:04:30] you have to wrestle for it oh glory to
[1:04:32] god you have to press for it the kingdom
[1:04:35] of god is preached and every man
[1:04:38] every man
[1:04:39] one more time every man press the intake
[1:04:41] no preacher pushing you into it
[1:04:43] oh close no church could push that's why
[1:04:45] when people start to say this church my
[1:04:47] church the heaven whether they are liars
[1:04:49] the pastor line and the people lying too
[1:04:51] because this kingdom no man could push
[1:04:53] you into it you got to press your way
[1:04:55] the pastor is not going to be wrong when
[1:04:57] you're pressing your way when you turn
[1:04:59] before god and lean and grinding and
[1:05:01] groaning and travailing and asking what
[1:05:03] affiliate with the holy ghost the past
[1:05:05] has nothing to do with that
[1:05:07] this is god and his son this is god and
[1:05:10] his daughter this is calling his people
[1:05:12] oh glory to god you shall be my son and
[1:05:15] i shall be your god oh give the lord a
[1:05:18] shout in the house
[1:05:22] hallelujah
[1:05:23] thank you lord thank you lord
[1:05:25] my god my god
[1:05:29] and we find all this birthright meant
[1:05:30] everything to jacob now he didn't care
[1:05:32] for nothing about the birthright and he
[1:05:34] didn't care what it cost him
[1:05:36] aha what it cost him everything ever
[1:05:39] cost
[1:05:40] watch the free you know devil let it off
[1:05:41] you're free as an initial stage
[1:05:43] but he does give you because the wages
[1:05:45] of sin is still letter
[1:05:46] you see despite inflation that changed
[1:05:48] at all it's still dead
[1:05:50] hallelujah praise god so nobody would
[1:05:52] freeze stuff everything cost calvary
[1:05:55] cost the blood the price was paid for us
[1:05:58] it was a blood price we couldn't get
[1:06:00] back like that the chasm was too great
[1:06:02] oh we couldn't jump over
[1:06:04] what adam did he make a big chasm we
[1:06:06] couldn't cross over sin kept us done sin
[1:06:09] kept us born but the bible said when the
[1:06:12] lamb took the book he said thou has
[1:06:14] redeemed us by thy blood
[1:06:17] has made us unto our god kings and
[1:06:20] priests and we shall reign on the earth
[1:06:23] or give the lord a shout how could mere
[1:06:26] sinners
[1:06:27] like us
[1:06:28] come to the spot to enter our priesthood
[1:06:31] and enter into a kingship that we could
[1:06:34] actually rule and reign on his head
[1:06:37] oh glory to god if we're going to rule
[1:06:39] then he'd have to start now oh glory to
[1:06:42] god hallelujah
[1:06:44] [Applause]
[1:06:46] listen
[1:06:48] we have evidence
[1:06:50] that the book has been restored
[1:06:51] we have evidence the title deed of the
[1:06:53] earth is known back on the it what adam
[1:06:55] lost what was manifestation that lasted
[1:06:58] profit was manifested you owe no other
[1:07:00] man
[1:07:01] bringing evidence he himself said what
[1:07:03] you see manifested temporarily will be
[1:07:06] manifested in his fullness when the
[1:07:08] press come otherwise i just shown you a
[1:07:10] demonstration of the power that is to
[1:07:12] come little fishy i give you back your
[1:07:15] life in the name of jesus christ and
[1:07:17] dead fish came back to life before the
[1:07:19] doctors and touches my wife the tumor
[1:07:21] will go down and the tumor went down
[1:07:24] it was stormy sun cometh and shine four
[1:07:26] days and the weather men had to change
[1:07:29] their prediction or give the lord a
[1:07:31] shout because the prophet spoke to the
[1:07:33] storm and said son come out
[1:07:36] oh give the lord a shout the book is on
[1:07:39] the earth
[1:07:42] the book is on the act
[1:07:47] glory
[1:07:48] glory to god
[1:07:51] [Music]
[1:07:53] [Applause]
[1:08:05] you might be seated
[1:08:07] do you understand
[1:08:08] since adam lost the book
[1:08:10] the book never came back down yet
[1:08:13] because the book was in the hands of the
[1:08:14] original owner
[1:08:15] waiting for redemption claims so since
[1:08:18] adam time that book went up when the
[1:08:21] devil looking to catch the book to the
[1:08:22] earth so he end up squatting here not
[1:08:24] illegal he end up illegal
[1:08:27] aim and spirits with all bodies
[1:08:29] fell from heaven
[1:08:30] looking to activate and jump upon people
[1:08:33] demon powers he don't belong here the
[1:08:36] earth is for the sons and daughters of
[1:08:37] the living god he's a squatter on this
[1:08:40] earth and one day we will look upon you
[1:08:42] look upon him and said is that the man
[1:08:45] that caused nation to tremble
[1:08:47] is that the man
[1:08:50] [Applause]
[1:08:58] let's
[1:08:59] let's look at it again
[1:09:00] adam lost the book the book went back
[1:09:02] and he has the original owner because
[1:09:04] satan have no rights with this greasy
[1:09:06] hand of unbelief to hold the book so god
[1:09:08] himself held the book
[1:09:10] oh he couldn't do nothing you had to
[1:09:11] wait
[1:09:12] talking about wait and wait
[1:09:14] jesus come he's still out of weight but
[1:09:16] jesus died
[1:09:18] to go and get the book and when he took
[1:09:20] the book he had to have a man on the
[1:09:22] earth to give the book not just any man
[1:09:25] but a prophet because the word come to a
[1:09:28] prophet not just any prophet but the
[1:09:31] seventh angels message that come at the
[1:09:33] seventh age so william branham was
[1:09:35] standing on the earth to catch the book
[1:09:38] and when he got the book he didn't keep
[1:09:39] it for himself he gave it to you
[1:09:42] oh tell the lord i shout no wonder we
[1:09:45] gonna have a revival
[1:09:46] no wonder we're gonna have a super
[1:09:48] church no wonder we're gonna have a
[1:09:50] super race
[1:09:51] no wonder we're gonna have that no devil
[1:09:53] could stop it
[1:09:55] there is gonna be signs there's gonna be
[1:09:58] wonders there is gonna be miracles and
[1:10:00] the power of god will be shaking this
[1:10:03] world
[1:10:05] once more the world will get direct from
[1:10:07] god
[1:10:08] and it will be plain or tape in church
[1:10:11] or give the lord a shout in the house
[1:10:15] [Applause]
[1:10:22] and i mean that
[1:10:24] it will not be playing brother branham
[1:10:26] tape in the church i'm not talking about
[1:10:28] that who want to do that let them do
[1:10:31] that but not this church we are
[1:10:33] preaching the word of god
[1:10:35] all glory to god
[1:10:37] and this church is sovereign
[1:10:40] no overseas on outside the church
[1:10:42] influence
[1:10:44] hallelujah
[1:10:46] [Applause]
[1:10:50] [Music]
[1:10:52] so brother branham
[1:10:54] was a dangerous man
[1:10:56] to the kingdom of hell
[1:10:58] because what he manifested the devil
[1:11:01] never saw before
[1:11:02] the devil knows he's in trouble
[1:11:05] he knows that
[1:11:06] because when jesus died he thought it
[1:11:08] was all over there was clinging glasses
[1:11:11] and toasting one another in hell until
[1:11:13] peter woke up the upper room and said
[1:11:15] these men are not drunk because you
[1:11:17] suppose but this is that that the
[1:11:19] prophet truly speak of
[1:11:21] oh the devastating just getting excited
[1:11:23] they're just getting excited oh glory to
[1:11:25] god when he said silver and gold have i
[1:11:28] known but such as i have i give it unto
[1:11:31] you rise up and walk in the name of
[1:11:33] jesus christ
[1:11:34] get off that crippled condition get off
[1:11:36] your wheelchair when you spoke that
[1:11:42] the devil knew
[1:11:43] it was the spirit of christ
[1:11:46] back among the church again back among
[1:11:48] the people of god again this one who
[1:11:50] cannot believe a natural believer this
[1:11:53] was the continuation of god a
[1:11:55] continuation of the book of acts oh
[1:11:57] gloria that is what that was
[1:11:59] oh hallelujah
[1:12:04] so what conclusion the devil going to
[1:12:05] draw
[1:12:07] from this 2020 prophet
[1:12:09] without a big education
[1:12:12] humble man meek man
[1:12:14] and with the power of god manifested
[1:12:16] through him
[1:12:17] hallelujah and see him taking off the
[1:12:19] scene
[1:12:20] and watching the prophecies i see a
[1:12:22] bride
[1:12:24] sealed into the kingdom of god
[1:12:26] she's written under the dynamics and the
[1:12:28] dynamics of this church will be a
[1:12:30] refilling of the holy ghost
[1:12:32] that they have worked in a small measure
[1:12:35] while the headstone coming down
[1:12:37] oh hallelujah
[1:12:39] and god release the seven seals and the
[1:12:42] seven angels come from eternity
[1:12:44] to gather all the scattered word the
[1:12:46] tied back into the word to bring down
[1:12:48] the holy ghost why can't i talk like
[1:12:50] that this thing is in me this court is
[1:12:52] all over me the secret is the word i
[1:12:54] don't have to call to you i know i am
[1:12:55] the coach oh glory to god i've been
[1:12:57] caught in so long i become the court
[1:12:58] itself we want to see fire on them
[1:13:00] quotes and one day god will send that
[1:13:02] fire on me like never before you'll hear
[1:13:04] quote after quote after quote by the
[1:13:06] spoken word
[1:13:07] oh glory to god what we see manifested
[1:13:09] temporarily we will see in this fullness
[1:13:12] there is going to be a super church not
[1:13:14] not church men's walking things super
[1:13:16] church
[1:13:17] with jesus walking in it
[1:13:19] he said the shout of the king will be in
[1:13:21] the camp
[1:13:22] when the short of the king in the camp
[1:13:23] everybody will hear it when a lion roar
[1:13:25] the lion is war privately
[1:13:29] another lion roaring when the lion won
[1:13:31] every beast in the jungle here in the
[1:13:32] lion
[1:13:33] oh glory to god when that land anointed
[1:13:35] come upon the bride every church every

[1:16:36] the bible tells them jesus said though
[1:16:38] fool tonight your soul is required of

[1:16:48] not a dog or a cat you have a soul
[1:16:50] inside of you that's why you're in
[1:16:51] church this morning if the cat and dog
[1:16:53] had souls they wasn't in service this
[1:16:55] morning but you have a soul
[1:16:57] oh glory to god you can't just stay here
[1:16:59] you have to leave here
[1:17:01] come on preach back to me somebody
[1:17:04] oh hallelujah
[1:17:05] hallelujah
[1:17:07] glory to god
[1:17:15] all that is born of the spirit of god
[1:17:16] are led by the spirit of god
[1:17:18] and they're walking in the beautiful
[1:17:19] light of holiness
[1:17:21] and cleanness
[1:17:22] okay
[1:17:23] so i'm on the home stretch here they
[1:17:25] want to keep it long this morning
[1:17:28] the elder listen let it go
[1:17:31] remember turks
[1:17:32] to understand what i have just said and
[1:17:35] declare why students have never found
[1:17:37] paul seen at any time be born again and
[1:17:40] then be spirit-filled
[1:17:42] they have been filled it is deer
[1:17:45] but they have put their own meanings to
[1:17:46] make it see it
[1:17:48] but scripture does not say that
[1:17:50] jesus said saint john 7 37 in the last
[1:17:53] day the greater of the feast jesus said
[1:17:55] and cried if any man tastes let him come
[1:17:57] unto me and drink he that believeth me
[1:17:59] as the scripture had said out of his
[1:18:00] belly shall flow rivers of living water
[1:18:02] this speak he of the spirit
[1:18:05] the bible said this directly this speak
[1:18:08] he of the spirit which they that believe
[1:18:10] on him should receive
[1:18:12] for the holy ghost was not yet given
[1:18:15] because jesus was not yet glorified
[1:18:18] so he's saying this is the spirit that
[1:18:20] you have to get
[1:18:21] but you can't get it yet because jesus
[1:18:23] christ is not glorified yet but he is
[1:18:25] prophesy he that believeth on me after
[1:18:27] scripture had said out of his belly all
[1:18:30] of this prophecy shall flow rivers
[1:18:33] [Music]
[1:18:35] in other words you are have your own
[1:18:37] energizer you have your own well you
[1:18:39] have your own artisan well you don't
[1:18:41] need somebody to pump you up and push up
[1:18:45] oh glory to god you don't need somebody
[1:18:47] to fire up you have fire on the inside
[1:18:50] oh give the lord a shout
[1:18:54] now it says here distinctly and
[1:18:56] emphatically that the believer upon
[1:18:58] drinking of coming up by coming unto
[1:19:00] jesus in faith would have rivers of
[1:19:02] living water
[1:19:03] pouring out of him
[1:19:05] and it places his experience at
[1:19:07] pentecost
[1:19:08] now keeping this thought in mind we read
[1:19:10] saint john 4 10 if thou knewest the gift
[1:19:13] of god and who it is that said unto thee
[1:19:15] give me to drink thou would have asked
[1:19:17] of him and he would have given thee
[1:19:19] living water this is jesus speaking more
[1:19:20] on the world but whosoever drinking of
[1:19:22] the water i shall give him shall never
[1:19:25] taste but the water that i shall give
[1:19:28] him shall be in him as a well
[1:19:31] of water springing up into everlasting
[1:19:33] life so jesus bring the context of this
[1:19:36] well
[1:19:37] not man jesus himself
[1:19:39] say how we're going to be
[1:19:40] let's continue this same living water is
[1:19:43] mentioned but this time it is not called
[1:19:45] a river it is called an artesian well
[1:19:48] there is where people made the mistake
[1:19:51] because it is called a well and a river
[1:19:53] they think in one place it is eternal
[1:19:55] life given by the spirit and next place
[1:19:58] where they said river in
[1:20:00] implying a great dynamism it has to be
[1:20:02] the spirit now given an endurance of
[1:20:04] power not so it is one and the same it
[1:20:07] is the spirit that gives life and power
[1:20:11] that came at pentecost
[1:20:13] that's why he said when our church is
[1:20:14] believing
[1:20:15] that the holy ghost is just as real as
[1:20:18] they fell on their pentecost we cannot
[1:20:20] believe less than that is how no new
[1:20:22] holy ghost is the same holy ghost he
[1:20:25] came to turn our ass back to the faith
[1:20:26] of the fathers to the holy ghost that
[1:20:28] they had
[1:20:29] or give the lord a shout what is causing
[1:20:32] this misunderstanding the answer is
[1:20:34] experience we have gone by experience
[1:20:36] and not by the word away with experience
[1:20:39] as your measuring line there's only one
[1:20:40] plumb line and that's the word now watch
[1:20:42] carefully and get this peter said repent
[1:20:44] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:20:45] christ for remission of sins and you
[1:20:47] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:20:49] paul said have you received the holy
[1:20:51] ghost since you believe
[1:20:53] this is the whole problem right here
[1:20:55] people repent of their sins they get
[1:20:56] baptized in water but they don't go on
[1:20:58] and receive the holy ghost you believe
[1:21:00] unto receiving the spirit believing on
[1:21:03] jesus is the first step in the right
[1:21:04] direction which is towards the holy
[1:21:06] ghost but the people stop there they go
[1:21:08] as far as water and then stop they
[1:21:10] believe and then stop the bible does not
[1:21:11] say when you believe you when when you
[1:21:13] believe it he said have you received the
[1:21:15] holy ghost since you believe
[1:21:17] the exact literal translation is did he
[1:21:21] haven't previously believed receive the
[1:21:22] holy ghost
[1:21:24] the people believe and then stop you
[1:21:25] don't receive the holy ghost when you
[1:21:26] believe unto him have repented you go on
[1:21:29] and receive the holy ghost do you see it
[1:21:32] that is what is wrong with our
[1:21:35] fundamentalists they have no power
[1:21:38] for this top shorter pentecost
[1:21:40] so i have a new word no fundamentalist
[1:21:42] so the fundamentalists in the message
[1:21:45] they have no power
[1:21:46] when you add talk
[1:21:48] they stop short of pentecost we cannot
[1:21:51] be no fundamentalist oh glory to god we
[1:21:53] can't be fundamental you have to be
[1:21:56] zealous for god
[1:21:57] oh glory to god amen
[1:21:59] they are like yeti comparison the
[1:22:01] children of israel
[1:22:03] who came out of egypt
[1:22:05] and stopped short of the promised land
[1:22:07] now those children of israel of egypt
[1:22:09] about 2 million strong they all journey
[1:22:11] together also they say miracles of god
[1:22:13] all part took of the same man and water
[1:22:14] from the spitting room all follow the
[1:22:16] same cloud by day pillar fire by night
[1:22:18] but only two reach the promised land
[1:22:20] only two are real true believers that is
[1:22:22] correct because the word tells us the
[1:22:24] rest of them died
[1:22:26] of unbelief and because of unbelief they
[1:22:28] could not enter in
[1:22:30] since that is so only two entered then
[1:22:32] the rest were not true believers
[1:22:34] what made the difference to stayed with
[1:22:36] the word when the hearth of the ten
[1:22:39] spies failed and clearness by near and
[1:22:41] these ten passes
[1:22:44] don't think there's ten believers you
[1:22:45] know
[1:22:47] there's ten bishops
[1:22:49] ten message poops
[1:22:51] all right
[1:22:52] hallelujah and you know what they caused
[1:22:54] the heart of the people to melt
[1:22:56] they say we see the land you know it
[1:22:58] flowed look at honey but
[1:22:59] what's that but
[1:23:01] but it's a giant
[1:23:03] that time caleb and joshua they they
[1:23:05] come back yet because they're blazing
[1:23:07] grapes they're blazing fruits at dinner
[1:23:09] man they're having a great time when
[1:23:11] they come back in are loaded with grapes
[1:23:13] they taught in this thing all that all
[1:23:14] grape juice what rung around the garment
[1:23:17] they camp moaning
[1:23:19] you see what happened
[1:23:21] giants
[1:23:23] caleb
[1:23:24] said a short man he got a box
[1:23:27] stamp on the box and said we are well
[1:23:29] able to take it
[1:23:32] let us go up at once
[1:23:34] at once
[1:23:36] and somebody said look at your tea
[1:23:38] shortening her boxy let's go up once to
[1:23:39] face giants shortest man they came
[1:23:41] talking about grenada no it's no this
[1:23:44] the eyes deceiving them they stop
[1:23:46] believing god you know
[1:23:49] but guess what
[1:23:50] shawty made it over
[1:23:52] joshua killer they made it over
[1:23:54] isn't that right and what did the holy
[1:23:56] spirit tell the prophet pick a pen and
[1:23:57] write he said in the last days let us
[1:23:59] stand like joshua caleb
[1:24:01] oh hallelujah praise god
[1:24:04] amen
[1:24:06] brother branham so all of us israelites
[1:24:07] saw the goodness and powers and
[1:24:08] deliverance of god they did not enter
[1:24:10] into the rest which is the time of the
[1:24:12] holy ghost so you can see right now that
[1:24:15] very few will ever believe all the way
[1:24:18] to receiving the spirit of god
[1:24:21] oh you mean it's like that
[1:24:23] the message called three kinds and three
[1:24:25] kinds was journeying out
[1:24:27] but who gonna cross over into the land
[1:24:29] itself do you see that now
[1:24:31] so bare there so that that that rest was
[1:24:34] a bunch of people in them
[1:24:36] caleb and joshua they were the spiritual
[1:24:38] of that bunch
[1:24:39] you'll be the spiritual of the bunch
[1:24:41] that's why i say don't watch anybody and
[1:24:43] say you want to do like them
[1:24:44] look at the word
[1:24:46] because you could be looking at a carnal
[1:24:47] believer
[1:24:49] you could be following a canal believer
[1:24:51] don't follow nobody follow the word
[1:24:53] oh glory to god do you believe that
[1:24:56] all right let's continue now
[1:24:58] bubba says i want to go further and when
[1:25:00] i do i know i'm going to cause some
[1:25:02] emotions to rise
[1:25:03] and that is something i'm not
[1:25:04] responsible for i'm responsible to god
[1:25:06] and his word and the people god has sent
[1:25:08] me to i have to be faithful in all he
[1:25:10] gives to me to see so then he said oh
[1:25:13] quoting scriptures in john 6 all the
[1:25:15] father given me shall come to me
[1:25:18] and him that cometh to me i will know i
[1:25:20] cast out
[1:25:22] no man can come to me except the father
[1:25:23] which had sent me draw him our reason in
[1:25:26] the last day but as many as receive him
[1:25:28] to them give you power to become the
[1:25:30] sons of god even to them that believe in
[1:25:32] his name which are born not of blood nor
[1:25:34] the will of the flesh nor the will of
[1:25:35] man but of god
[1:25:37] now ephesians 1 and he started to read
[1:25:40] according as he has chosen him before
[1:25:42] the foundation of the world
[1:25:44] and we are predestinated under
[1:25:46] adoption by jesus christ himself
[1:25:48] according to the good plan of his will
[1:25:50] then he says this here now
[1:25:52] jesus christ
[1:25:53] nations get ready to come
[1:25:55] is choosing his own bride
[1:25:58] just the same as men choose their brides
[1:26:01] today
[1:26:02] the bride today does not simply decide
[1:26:05] she's going to take a certain man for
[1:26:06] husband no sir it is the groom who
[1:26:09] decides and chooses a certain woman for
[1:26:11] his brain
[1:26:12] so in john 15 16 you have not chosen me
[1:26:15] but i have chosen you
[1:26:16] so he gave a scriptural basis for that
[1:26:19] the word right now according to the word
[1:26:21] of god the bride was chosen before the
[1:26:23] foundation of the world
[1:26:25] this chosen of the bride was purposed in
[1:26:28] himself
[1:26:29] the purpose of god according to election
[1:26:32] my stand you can read it any other way
[1:26:34] you can't read it any other way
[1:26:36] the hard purpose here we go the eternal
[1:26:39] purpose of god was to take a bride of
[1:26:42] his own chosen
[1:26:44] and that purpose was in himself and
[1:26:46] being eternal was decreed before the
[1:26:48] foundation of the world
[1:26:50] watch carefully now and see this before
[1:26:53] there was ever a speck of status
[1:26:55] before god was god
[1:26:57] god is the object of worship he was
[1:26:58] known as the eternal spirit
[1:27:00] the bride was already in his mind before
[1:27:04] he was even god
[1:27:05] when he was the eternal spirit
[1:27:07] the pride was even in his mind
[1:27:09] and i was before the spirit become word
[1:27:12] because the word come in the beginning
[1:27:13] was the word before it was the beginning
[1:27:16] it was spirit
[1:27:17] the bride was back here
[1:27:19] oh glory to god that's why the bride is
[1:27:21] connected to spirit oh give the lord a
[1:27:24] shout do you see that this morning
[1:27:25] hallelujah
[1:27:27] now watch
[1:27:29] watch this now
[1:27:30] he was known as eternal spirit the bride
[1:27:32] was already in his mind
[1:27:33] she was she was existing in his thoughts
[1:27:37] and what about those thoughts of god the
[1:27:39] eternal
[1:27:40] are they not
[1:27:41] the eternal thoughts of god let me ask
[1:27:43] you are the thoughts of god eternal
[1:27:45] if you see this you will see many things
[1:27:48] god is unchangeable
[1:27:50] in both essence and behavior
[1:27:53] we have studied that and prove already
[1:27:55] god is infinite in his abilities so
[1:27:58] therefore he as god must be omniscient
[1:28:01] if he is omniscient
[1:28:04] that is all knowing then he is not no
[1:28:06] leaning
[1:28:07] nor is he taking counsel even with
[1:28:09] himself
[1:28:10] nor is he at any time adding to his
[1:28:12] knowledge if he can add to his knowledge
[1:28:15] then he's not omniscient
[1:28:17] the best we could say is that sometimes
[1:28:20] he will be but that is not scriptural
[1:28:22] he is omniscient he has never had a new
[1:28:26] thought about anything because all his
[1:28:29] thoughts he always had
[1:28:30] always will have and knows the end from
[1:28:33] the beginning
[1:28:34] because he is god oh give the lord i
[1:28:37] shout
[1:28:38] my god i feel like running around the
[1:28:40] building
[1:28:41] hallelujah
[1:28:42] oh glory to god hallelujah praise god
[1:28:46] thank you jesus
[1:28:48] thus the thoughts of god are eternal
[1:28:50] they are real they are not simply like a
[1:28:53] man with a blueprint he has drawn up
[1:28:55] which one day
[1:28:56] and will be translated into substance
[1:28:58] and form they are already real
[1:29:01] and eternal
[1:29:03] and part of god
[1:29:05] that's why you could tell the devil have
[1:29:07] you considered my servant job there is
[1:29:09] not like him on the earth
[1:29:11] god already knew job can fail
[1:29:13] oh give the lord i shout
[1:29:16] glory to god amen
[1:29:19] these elect were not only the eternal
[1:29:21] thoughts of god which were to be
[1:29:23] expressed in flesh in their due season
[1:29:26] but these same elect are called by
[1:29:28] another name romans 4 16 therefore it is
[1:29:31] of faith that it might be by grace to
[1:29:34] the end the promise might be sure to all
[1:29:36] the seed that's why when the heads don't
[1:29:38] come it will come with shouting of grace
[1:29:40] grace unto it that you will have no
[1:29:43] works to boast to show how you made it
[1:29:46] there's a song oh i made it over
[1:29:49] oh my soul will look back and wonder how
[1:29:52] i made it over look at the lord i shout
[1:29:55] that's the grace of god
[1:29:57] hallelujah to the end the promise was
[1:29:59] might be to show to all the seed not
[1:30:01] only to that which of the law but to
[1:30:03] that authority of the fate of abraham
[1:30:05] who's the father of us allah
[1:30:07] because and he quote the scripture that
[1:30:09] we read hallelujah thank you lord and
[1:30:12] galatians 3 29 and if you be christ deny
[1:30:15] abraham's seed and ears according to the
[1:30:17] promise according to romans 4 16 we find
[1:30:19] that god has given a short promise to
[1:30:22] all abraham seed show promise and paul
[1:30:24] puts himself on all the believers under
[1:30:26] the designation he says abraham who is
[1:30:29] the father of us all and then he goes on
[1:30:31] not only narrow this definition but
[1:30:34] rather to finalize it and say in
[1:30:35] galician trees identify the seed
[1:30:38] singular with jesus and counter the seed
[1:30:41] children of promise
[1:30:43] do you see who you are
[1:30:44] a child of promise he promised you the
[1:30:47] holy ghost he promised you deliverance
[1:30:49] he promised you a breakthrough he
[1:30:51] promised you a healing you are child of
[1:30:53] promise
[1:30:54] oh glory to god and promised as having
[1:30:57] to do with election and the chosen of
[1:30:59] god and that is exactly what we have
[1:31:02] been saying
[1:31:03] these who are the royal seed are the
[1:31:05] elect of god
[1:31:07] are the predestinated foreknown of god
[1:31:10] and we're in the mind of god in his
[1:31:11] thoughts in very plain language the true
[1:31:14] bite of christ was in the mind of god
[1:31:16] eternally do not express until each come
[1:31:19] forth in the designated decreed season
[1:31:22] so you had to be here
[1:31:24] in 2021 you had to be here in this hour
[1:31:28] this is your season this is your time
[1:31:31] god has designated for the world to
[1:31:34] become flesh in you
[1:31:36] oh glory to god and once the word become
[1:31:38] flesh the invisible becomes visible oh
[1:31:40] give the lord i shout in the house we
[1:31:43] are going back to eden
[1:31:45] oh glory to god we are going back to
[1:31:47] genesis
[1:31:48] thank you lord
[1:31:50] dr bride is the literal spoken word seed
[1:31:53] bride
[1:31:54] and although she is feminine in
[1:31:56] designation she she's also called the
[1:31:57] body of christ
[1:31:59] which is very apparent that she ought to
[1:32:02] be called that for she was predecimated
[1:32:04] in him and came from the same source was
[1:32:07] eternal with him and is now manifesting
[1:32:10] god in a memory membered body whereas
[1:32:13] one squad was manifested in one member
[1:32:15] even jesus christ
[1:32:17] hallelujah here we go
[1:32:19] there here we come to the conclusion
[1:32:21] as the great as the eternal logos god
[1:32:24] was manifesting the sun
[1:32:26] and jesus dwelt all the fullness of the
[1:32:28] godhead and the eternal one was the
[1:32:30] father manifest in flesh and thereby
[1:32:32] gain the title of son even so we
[1:32:35] eternal in his thoughts
[1:32:37] in our turn became a many members spoken
[1:32:40] with seed manifest in the flesh
[1:32:43] those eternal thoughts no manifest in
[1:32:46] the flesh are the sons of god
[1:32:48] even as we are so called
[1:32:50] so that's why he said you are not a
[1:32:51] believer the believer is the word in you
[1:32:54] do you catch it now
[1:32:56] it's not your flesh is the believer the
[1:32:58] believer is the word inside of you
[1:33:00] oh glory to god watch this now
[1:33:03] so watch and those eternal torts no
[1:33:06] manifest in flesh are the sons of god
[1:33:09] even as ye are so called we did not
[1:33:11] become seed by the reboot
[1:33:14] we will cede
[1:33:16] and therefore will reborn
[1:33:17] for only the elect can be reborn
[1:33:20] because we were seed
[1:33:22] is the reason we could be quickened
[1:33:25] in non-seed there is nothing to quicken
[1:33:29] my sheep hear my voice and they follow
[1:33:30] me you always were a sheep you never
[1:33:33] were a pig or a dog turn into a sheep
[1:33:36] oh glory to god when god find you in the
[1:33:39] gutter and pull you up and clean you up
[1:33:42] you are sheep since then
[1:33:45] when you must smoke in your worst sheep
[1:33:47] walk glory to god whatever condition
[1:33:49] you're in he was written to call you
[1:33:52] oh hallelujah praise god
[1:33:56] let's let's wrap up here now
[1:34:00] as many as i love
[1:34:02] is god's speaking arabic and cheese
[1:34:05] in greek the emphasis is upon poison i
[1:34:08] it does not say as many would feel
[1:34:11] he should say as many as love me no sir
[1:34:14] we must never try to make jesus the
[1:34:16] object of human love in this verse no it
[1:34:19] is as many that are the loved ones of
[1:34:22] god
[1:34:22] it is his love in question not ours
[1:34:25] so once again we find ourselves
[1:34:28] glorifying in his salvation
[1:34:30] his purpose his plan and we are
[1:34:32] confirmed even more strongly in the
[1:34:35] truth of the doctrine of the sovereignty
[1:34:37] of god
[1:34:38] even as he said in romans 9 13 jacob
[1:34:40] have i loved
[1:34:41] does it now obtain that since he loved
[1:34:43] only the many is he therefore in a state
[1:34:46] of complacency awaiting the love of
[1:34:48] those who have not drawn knight to him
[1:34:50] by no means is this so for he declared
[1:34:52] also in romans 9 13 he so have i hated
[1:34:55] and in verse 11 the spirit boldly calls
[1:34:58] out for the children not being born
[1:35:00] neither having done any good or evil
[1:35:02] that the purpose of god according to
[1:35:05] election might stand not of works but of
[1:35:08] him that call it
[1:35:09] of him that call it
[1:35:11] and god call you
[1:35:13] my god
[1:35:15] you should be happy the silver man love
[1:35:16] him and honor him and worship him
[1:35:19] glory to god watch watch this now i'm
[1:35:22] closing
[1:35:23] this love is elective love
[1:35:28] it is his love for his elect
[1:35:31] and his love for them is apart from
[1:35:33] human merit
[1:35:37] nothing you could do
[1:35:39] could make him love you more
[1:35:41] in that way
[1:35:43] his love is permanent
[1:35:45] his love is unchanging
[1:35:47] he call it elective love
[1:35:49] it's his love not yours
[1:35:53] oh give the lord
[1:35:55] an offering of praise
[1:35:57] [Applause]
[1:36:01] his love for them is apart from human
[1:36:03] merit for it says that the purpose of
[1:36:05] god stands
[1:36:06] in election which is exactly opposite to
[1:36:09] works or anything else
[1:36:11] before the chain was born
[1:36:13] he said as many as i love our rebuke and
[1:36:14] chasing to rebuke is to reprove to
[1:36:16] reprove his expose
[1:36:18] with a view of correction chasing
[1:36:19] doesn't mean to punish
[1:36:21] it means a discipline
[1:36:23] because the subject's amendment is in
[1:36:25] mind
[1:36:27] oh my hallelujah
[1:36:29] hearing lies fought the love of god
[1:36:32] he desired it in love a family of his
[1:36:34] own
[1:36:35] a family of sons you begin to pray play
[1:36:37] something softly
[1:36:38] a family of sons like himself
[1:36:42] so before him lines all mankind as one
[1:36:44] lump of clay
[1:36:46] out of that same lump he will now make
[1:36:49] vessels unto honor
[1:36:50] and under dishonor
[1:36:52] the chosen will be his own choosing
[1:36:55] those who
[1:36:56] then those chosen ones born of his
[1:36:57] spirit will be trained
[1:36:59] to conform to his image in their work
[1:37:02] he reproves with all long suffering and
[1:37:04] gentleness and mercy he chases me with
[1:37:06] knees guard hands
[1:37:08] sometimes his spotter must take the
[1:37:09] vessel he's working on and thoroughly
[1:37:11] break it down
[1:37:13] in order that he may rebuild it exactly
[1:37:15] as he deserves
[1:37:16] but it is his love
[1:37:18] that is his love another way of his love
[1:37:21] there is not
[1:37:23] they cannot be
[1:37:24] all little flop do not fear
[1:37:27] this age is fast closing as it does
[1:37:29] those tears will be bound together as a
[1:37:31] three-fold court is not easily broken
[1:37:33] they will have tremendous
[1:37:34] threefold strength of political physical
[1:37:37] spiritual satanic power
[1:37:38] they will seek to destroy the bride of
[1:37:40] christ she will suffer but she will
[1:37:42] endure
[1:37:43] fear not these things that are coming up
[1:37:45] on the earth for he who loved his own
[1:37:49] lover them unto the end
[1:37:51] oh my hallelujah
[1:37:54] oh glory to god
[1:37:58] hallelujah i don't act clean and pure
[1:38:00] and holy to make myself a christian but
[1:38:02] christ in me lives that in me
[1:38:04] i love him and i'll do anything wrong if
[1:38:06] i do anything wrong it will condemn me
[1:38:08] right there and i will say god forgive
[1:38:10] me
[1:38:11] every day i got to ask forgiveness
[1:38:14] every day and you do too certainly you
[1:38:17] do
[1:38:18] oh my harley i'm going to skip
[1:38:21] oh my
[1:38:22] god
[1:38:25] the spiritual man has a spiritual soul
[1:38:28] that can never die
[1:38:29] the canal mine has a religious
[1:38:30] atmosphere around him and wants to
[1:38:32] worship and so forth but that is kana
[1:38:35] not as unbeliever but the carnal
[1:38:37] believer that's the kind that was
[1:38:40] rejected
[1:38:41] esau represented the man of the earth
[1:38:44] natural religious inclined but
[1:38:46] never able it wasn't in him to do it he
[1:38:48] couldn't do it he never was in him to be
[1:38:50] able to climb past the things of the
[1:38:52] world the carnal thing but jacob it was
[1:38:54] easy for him to do it now jacob one
[1:38:56] purpose jacob had was the bit right
[1:38:59] about him says and that spirit of one
[1:39:02] bird is still representing the world
[1:39:03] today it's coming to a head now the
[1:39:05] spiritual believer and the canal man
[1:39:08] no one could say they wasn't both
[1:39:10] religious they were
[1:39:11] they didn't say that once their idol and
[1:39:13] the other one god they were both
[1:39:15] servants of god
[1:39:17] wow
[1:39:18] i didn't say it the prophet said this
[1:39:20] esau jacob stevens
[1:39:22] hallelujah they cannot believer today oh
[1:39:25] no i go to church do what's right what
[1:39:26] difference does it make
[1:39:28] but what the true believer they can't
[1:39:30] wait they get to put right oh let me
[1:39:33] just skip down here
[1:39:34] hallelujah
[1:39:36] so when they came up to the promised
[1:39:37] land they were headed to the promised
[1:39:39] land not invaders but believers
[1:39:41] believers the same god israel had they
[1:39:43] come tried to kiss his brother because
[1:39:45] he was his brother he surely was
[1:39:46] unrighteous he said but they failed to
[1:39:48] see his election and balaam can only
[1:39:50] come and curse and so on like but you
[1:39:52] can't kiss what god bless you cannot
[1:39:54] curse the elect of god
