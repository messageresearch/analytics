[15:19] I'm proverbs 23 one or even Bustillos
[15:22] verse 7 reading from Joshua chapter 14
[15:28] we have of the six then the children of
[15:30] Judah came unto Joshua and giggle and
[15:33] Caleb the son of Jephunneh Achilles
[15:35] quezon I said unto him don't know it's
[15:37] the thing that Moses said unto me that
[15:39] the Lord said unto Moses the man of God
[15:41] considered me and D in Kennish Pinilla
[15:44] forty years old was I when Moses the
[15:47] servant of the Lord sent me from commish
[15:50] Pinilla they spelled the land and I
[15:53] brought him wood again as it was in my
[15:57] heart
[15:58] nevertheless my brethren that went up
[16:01] with me meet the heart of the people
[16:02] melt but I wholly followed Lord my god
[16:05] Moses sway on that day saying surely the
[16:09] land where I died feet of cotton shall
[16:10] be dying inheritance and thy children's
[16:13] forever because that was holy father the

[18:43] this is Joshua's this is Caleb's
[18:46] testimony he brought word as it was in
[18:50] his heart
[18:51] okay let's go leave submitted Exodus for
[18:55] a man the spiritual man had looked on in
[18:57] Egypt and see persecution rise and see
[19:01] Joseph taken away in order that
[19:05] prosecution could rise the Prophet said
[19:09] that and this here referring to is there
[19:14] reasonable fear who knew not Joseph
[19:16] now remember Joseph save Egypt by his
[19:20] vision an interpretation of the vision
[19:23] that that if hero had he actually see
[19:25] Egypt and his family came and God bless
[19:28] and everything else no Joseph was
[19:30] thinking now
[19:31] that he puts the aggression could rise
[19:34] hallelujah and Joseph will be removed
[19:37] and Berta banham type Joseph as freedom
[19:40] of religion and all this America which
[19:43] is relation to team
[19:44] she was founded on freedom of religion
[19:46] isn't that right and we know that the
[19:49] B's system going to be activated where
[19:52] the scenes going to become persecuted or
[19:55] pressed this is our promise that we're
[19:58] gonna have a press come down and at that
[20:00] time you're gonna see the table in
[20:01] effect and burn around give testimony

[20:06] be manifested in its fullness so there's
[20:09] our money physician to come but I want
[20:11] you to notice what God did when they
[20:13] came out of Egypt he gave testimony to
[20:16] them go into the land these twelve
[20:18] brothers these twelve ministers these
[20:19] twelve whatever you want to call them of

[23:22] persecution to rise he said Joseph had
[23:25] to be taken away in order that the

[23:52] prophecy
[23:53] remember the devil controlling all

[24:04] the Christians and only will you know
[24:06] the devil is a judge Daniel

[25:25] place in position where he could bless
[25:29] them and place among them the one he had
[25:32] promised they had to be in their land

[34:58] forsaken land of Egypt come out
[35:00] sanctified by the orphan of his blood
[35:02] wash from our sins and so and then we
[35:05] are seeking a land a city that's coming

[36:46] promise and they were on their journey
[36:48] please do understand that is where you

[1:02:26] how God has set some in the church to
[1:02:29] deliver pains or they get tremendous
[1:02:30] some time when a church is groaning
[1:02:33] under the persecution of the outside
[1:02:37] world believing on the Lord Jesus that
[1:02:40] the promise of the Holy Ghost is just
[1:02:44] too real to us I wanna I don't want no
[1:02:46] less the Holy Ghost you see in the upper
[1:02:48] room they fulfill three steps they were
[1:02:51] justified
[1:02:52] they were sanctified they receive the
[1:02:54] Holy Ghost and they were adopted in the
[1:02:56] upper room when come to us we get four
[1:02:59] steps
[1:02:59] luta justification where's the
[1:03:02] certification Pentecost the baptismal
[1:03:05] Holy Ghost and Burma or the world but
[1:03:09] once the fullness of the word be
[1:03:10] restored we are gonna go back to three
[1:03:12] steps while Peter yet spake these words
[1:03:15] Oh God
[1:03:16] yeah yes sounds probably kingdom and
[1:03:18] after sons born into the kingdom place
[1:03:21] positionally then through their mouth
[1:03:22] life gonna be speaking out from the
[1:03:25] amount of sons of God you talk about a
[1:03:28] genuine fight for ministry it will be
[1:03:30] Christ in these men Christ and the
[1:03:33] following a posture
[1:03:34] Christ in the former prophet Christ and
[1:03:37] former pastor Christ in the form of a
[1:03:39] teacher Christ informal evangelist
[1:03:41] caught Phil Gore corner not politicians
[1:03:45] not message Pope's Britain for the
[1:03:50] kingdom he say you will hear from them
[1:03:53] and yesterday we'll take over you will
[1:03:55] hear from the pastor you would hear from
[1:03:57] the prophet you would hear four
[1:03:58] evangelists so no group could go up on a
[1:04:00] corn on top what eyes bright that's cold
[1:04:03] you know what I say no man could take
[1:04:06] note it aside and say it's not a promise
[1:04:08] coca-cola to decide a but lies that man
[1:04:12] wife must be that my group no no that
[1:04:15] men working you know there's one buddy
[1:04:17] and by one spirit we are baptized into
[1:04:20] one body there's gonna be one church
[1:04:22] which will be the body of Christ
[1:04:24] that's the mystical body of Jesus Christ
[1:04:26] and no man could control that no man can
[1:04:29] hit that no man could govern that you
[1:04:32] could be working in that but you can't
[1:04:34] control that
[1:04:34] Christ is the head of the body called
[1:04:36] the church or cuz the Lord I shout and I
[1:04:39] said again Christ is the head of the
[1:04:41] body called the church not some ministry
[1:04:43] somewhere Christ is the head of the body
[1:04:46] the cap coming to the pyramid the coming
[1:04:49] of the headstone
[1:04:50] oh mighty could take a little more tell
[1:04:53] the truth tonight and get started yet
[1:04:54] he said when a church is groaning under
[1:04:56] the persecution of those side world
[1:04:58] believing in Lord Jesus that the promise
[1:05:00] of the Holy Ghost just is real to us and
[1:05:02] was a Pentecost how they groan and cry
[1:05:04] under labor pains but when they are born
[1:05:07] one and positionally born to into the
[1:05:10] kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has
[1:05:13] set in the church some apostles some
[1:05:16] prophets some teachers some pastors some
[1:05:19] evangelists then he gave in to their to
[1:05:22] speaking with tones interpretation of
[1:05:24] tongues
[1:05:25] knowledge wisdom gives even or can
[1:05:27] Americans said what package is included
[1:05:29] the whole package five for ministry and
[1:05:33] the gifts of the Spirit isn't that right
[1:05:35] Oh glory to God now what is the land of
[1:05:39] promise to the New Testament believer
[1:05:40] the promise is this home adoption the
[1:05:43] Holy Spirit for shall come to pass
[1:05:45] I'll pour my spirit upon all flesh your
[1:05:48] son and all shall prophesy of our
[1:05:50] missionaries and so on then left Egypt
[1:05:52] was the world did you notice before they
[1:05:55] cut in a promise kept up nothing no all
[1:05:59] right now these some question answers
[1:06:02] today the church has come to
[1:06:04] justification to looter unto salvation
[1:06:06] to the method
[1:06:07] known to the light no isn't to the time
[1:06:11] of the promised looter Wesley and now
[1:06:15] the time of the promise the promise is
[1:06:20] the baptism of the Spirit now he's not
[1:06:28] talking about Pentecost
[1:06:29] 1906 he's not my dad let's continue now
[1:06:33] watch the promise is the baptism of the
[1:06:37] Spirit which is promised all to the old
[1:06:40] testament and new to the promise is
[1:06:44] behold I send the promise of my father
[1:06:47] upon you Peter said that on the day of
[1:06:50] Pentecost this that that is the promise
[1:06:53] the promised land
[1:06:55] here we go is to live in this land of
[1:06:58] the Holy Spirit church is out this is
[1:07:05] the Holy Spirit now this is not coming
[1:07:07] to church this is living which husband
[1:07:10] living with your wife living with your
[1:07:12] children living on the street living and
[1:07:14] running water the groceries living in
[1:07:17] this land of the Holy Spirit
[1:07:20] listen that is God's promise for the
[1:07:23] church is to live here we go in the
[1:07:26] power of the Spirit it's another world I
[1:07:30] love that the first thing is another
[1:07:32] world
[1:07:33] it's another land you have to come out
[1:07:36] of the condition you're being in to come
[1:07:39] out and live in this form it's lamb
[1:07:42] hallelujah so just as the promised land
[1:07:45] was promised in the Old Testament to the
[1:07:47] children Israel which was Kenan and we
[1:07:49] have a promise also which is the land of
[1:07:52] the Holy Spirit so what did he send some
[1:07:58] angels from eternity for what he says
[1:08:01] Senate for some angels he said the gada
[1:08:05] all the scattered world to tie it back
[1:08:09] into the world to do what to bring down
[1:08:14] the holy spirit let me say it again he
[1:08:16] sent some angels
[1:08:17] takara all
[1:08:20] the scattered word that tied back into
[1:08:22] the word to bring non holy spirit
[1:08:26] because with a restoration of this word
[1:08:28] comes a restoration of the spirit
[1:08:31] because the word and spirit is one and
[1:08:33] the word was capped at two seven ages so
[1:08:36] we're at the brinda scattered word to
[1:08:38] bring back the fullness of the Holy
[1:08:40] Ghost in this hour to produce the
[1:08:42] ministry of the sons of God but the
[1:08:45] manifestation the sons of God when born
[1:08:48] son fill son speak and the word is
[1:08:50] created just like that or tell the Lord
[1:08:53] I show glory to God and the Holy Ghost
[1:08:57] being loosed in the last days because he
[1:09:00] released the word in the last days so
[1:09:02] God will loose the Holy Ghost in the
[1:09:04] form of by your promises and when you
[1:09:06] receive them by the promises we receive
[1:09:08] the Holy Ghost it would form or give the
[1:09:11] Lord a shout you receive the mechanics
[1:09:14] of the pyramid in you it would form
[1:09:15] because the secret is the word is in the
[1:09:19] bride the word the night is in you the
[1:09:22] mechanics already in you Oh glory to God
[1:09:25] and the mind of crisis charity the Holy
[1:09:28] Spirit hello here I'm the capstone
[1:09:30] coming upon you to quicken and make it
[1:09:33] alive Oh hallelujah praise God could we
[1:09:36] get there go some praises Oh hallelujah
[1:09:39] hallelujah thank you lord
[1:09:43] Lauri it's another world it's another

[1:09:50] promise remember you shall receive power
[1:09:52] from on high
[1:09:53] after this the Holy Ghost upon you after
[1:09:56] when that's not looter that's not Wesley
[1:10:01] dice not Pentecost that is the position
[1:10:03] of the Holy Ghost himself which came in
[1:10:06] the evening time the program came to
[1:10:08] introduce the person of Christ because
[1:10:10] the Pentecostal they don't have him okay
[1:10:13] the Lord of praise offering do you see
[1:10:15] that now so power is promised when after
[1:10:18] the Holy Ghost is come upon you
[1:10:21] what's this he came unto his own his own
[1:10:24] received him not
[1:10:25] but as many as received him to them gave
[1:10:29] he power to be
[1:10:31] come it doesn't mean you're adopted its
[1:10:33] power to become its power to claim its
[1:10:36] power to grow its power to move the
[1:10:38] ladder of this pyramid well glory to God
[1:10:41] some little miracle and some little
[1:10:43] miracle and you're feelin tops among in
[1:10:45] some way you don't get them started
[1:10:46] that's what the public in the tender
[1:10:48] Pentecostal all these tongues and
[1:10:50] speaking in tongues you know getting
[1:10:51] started but you want to be Co placed in
[1:10:54] a place of trying to be tested to be a
[1:10:57] prove as a son the right kind of a son
[1:11:01] or cancel or - Oh hallelujah there's
[1:11:05] gonna be sons please positionally into a
[1:11:08] position of power because of the tractor
[1:11:11] full of their life oh my all right drop
[1:11:22] of what I wanted to see tonight
[1:11:25] I just need Curtin know Oh hallelujah
[1:11:34] Jesus is not going to ask me if I was a
[1:11:37] Methodist Lutheran Baptists he's going
[1:11:40] to judge me to what I was in my heart
[1:11:46] that's right that is what he will judge
[1:11:50] us all by so you see after all these
[1:11:53] shows any men you have to know what's in
[1:11:56] your heart
[1:11:58] because from the abundance of the heart
[1:12:00] the mode speak if any hot corrupt color
[1:12:05] franklamacchia mode if you have evil
[1:12:07] evil come watch em out
[1:12:08] oh he said out of the heart proceed
[1:12:10] adultery and fornication all things
[1:12:12] inside comes out of a man hat that's why
[1:12:16] often you heart tonight new spirit of
[1:12:21] his spirit hallelujah
[1:12:25] now don't think is just one church we
[1:12:29] represent all the churches and many of
[1:12:32] the people have come into the line that
[1:12:34] is a Methodist Baptist metallic I have
[1:12:36] never seen one that come but what was
[1:12:39] healed when they come upon the basis of
[1:12:42] faith so it was like a flip not been
[1:12:47] healed Methodist not been here no no no
[1:12:49] let's continue I wouldn't corner I have
[1:12:51] seen people come that were renown
[1:12:54] Christians and stand there and be told
[1:12:58] the reason that they couldn't be healed
[1:13:00] and I see streetwalkers prostitutes
[1:13:04] people of in in Fame come off the street
[1:13:07] and be healed of crippled blindness and
[1:13:11] everything else sinners no you don't
[1:13:16] have to be a Christian to be healed
[1:13:18] it's a big one
[1:13:30] [Music]
[1:13:34] like that is Jude you don't have to be a
[1:13:39] Christian to be healed but you have to
[1:13:41] be a Christian to stay healed because
[1:13:49] from the Bible Jesus said go and sin no
[1:13:51] more
[1:13:51] Lisa words that come upon you so to keep
[1:13:55] the healing to become a Christian but
[1:13:58] God heal everybody who are faint to
[1:14:00] receive it they get it so he's not mean
[1:14:03] and angry God in that way he just let
[1:14:06] the Sun Shine let the Sun of
[1:14:08] righteousness arise he was raised but
[1:14:13] Abraham he's in the prayer line and I
[1:14:16] believe my dear friend my name in come
[1:14:17] like a flood God raised the stand
[1:14:19] against it you release magazines and
[1:14:21] things how seats on a rampage God a
[1:14:23] reasoner stand that don't worry we
[1:14:24] believe he's always on the right side
[1:14:26] he's always above the enemy all the time
[1:14:28] do you believe that lady sitting right
[1:14:30] here yes you had more faith than you
[1:14:34] thought you had feet is a subconscious
[1:14:38] thing lady faith is not a mental act it
[1:14:42] is something that you could sub
[1:14:44] consciously do it people
[1:14:46] try to look to the intellectual faith
[1:14:48] when faith doesn't lay in there reason
[1:14:52] Lee is their faith lies in the soul and
[1:15:01] I said that's what penicillin is it
[1:15:04] kills the few germs but it doesn't touch
[1:15:06] the cells that I've been taught on God
[1:15:08] has to do that so he is the only healer
[1:15:10] God is the healer and then it's your
[1:15:14] faith in God and many people have faith
[1:15:17] subconsciously and doesn't know it you
[1:15:24] mean you could be sitting here with a
[1:15:25] whole big bunch of faith tonight and do
[1:15:26] you even know it yeah yeah because it's
[1:15:32] subconscious let's continue you talking
[1:15:36] about a woman
[1:15:37] there was a little German woman she got
[1:15:39] instructions and a little prick Lord
[1:15:40] thank you script it says he had to call
[1:15:43] in your friends or your pasta if you can
[1:15:47] if not one of your neighbors confess all
[1:15:49] your wrongs and ask God to heal you and
[1:15:52] places on you and then believe that was
[1:15:55] the instruction on e Pretlow the little
[1:15:58] German woman it was amazing
[1:16:00] she put it on underneath garment like it
[1:16:04] was instructed
[1:16:05] she had the neighbors come in and three
[1:16:08] she confessed all her wrongs and when
[1:16:11] she got it on there she put her hand
[1:16:13] over her hat and said no old man devil
[1:16:17] you get over me and right up she got and
[1:16:22] went walking across the floor after
[1:16:24] being in a wheelchair for 20-some odd
[1:16:27] years it is that simple you know there
[1:16:36] are many times we try to reach out for
[1:16:38] something for a certain kind of a fate
[1:16:41] and you don't have to have some kind of
[1:16:43] super feat to be healed the only thing
[1:16:46] you have to have is just the feet that
[1:16:48] you got now you know in the Bible the
[1:16:51] blood was applied and adores by hyssop
[1:16:54] and it was ordinary you don't have to
[1:16:57] have a super feet how did you come here
[1:17:00] how do you know you want to leave how
[1:17:03] can you drive your car how do you move
[1:17:07] your hand you do it subconsciously
[1:17:09] because you believe it you can do it
[1:17:11] that's the way you believe for your
[1:17:13] healing it's just settled it doesn't
[1:17:18] take some higher education some super
[1:17:19] duper something it takes common faith
[1:17:21] and God just believe it like you would
[1:17:23] if your mother would said to you some to
[1:17:25] get something just believe it like that
[1:17:27] they took blood ordinary healy hyssop
[1:17:30] they put on blood and pass it on the
[1:17:32] door but a Branham yes I will take the
[1:17:36] Stoney heart give you a new heart the
[1:17:38] heart is the dwelling place of the Holy

[1:18:15] along with your neighbour you couldn't
[1:18:16] get along with yourself so you're no you
[1:18:18] couldn't get along with God so God give
[1:18:21] you a new spirit and many times on the
[1:18:23] enthusiasm if you'll watch the light
[1:18:25] that appears I hope I'm not Newton but I
[1:18:27] hope I'm uncovering a lot of times you
[1:18:29] dink you have the Holy Spirit you said I
[1:18:32] sung I spoke in tongues certainly being
[1:18:34] that closer it might do all that but
[1:18:37] that is not ready yet the Holy Spirit
[1:18:39] bears record of Jesus Christ he gives
[1:18:41] you a new heart give you a new spirit
[1:18:43] then he puts his spirit his spirit in

[1:18:57] clock and your new spirit grows in the
[1:18:59] center of your new heart new heart in a
[1:19:01] new heart new spirit in your newest
[1:19:03] worth his spirit
[1:19:05] that's the mainspring when you receive
[1:19:08] the Holy Spirit is goes into the middle
[1:19:10] of the dispensed dispositions of yours
[1:19:13] you say I quit drinkin I quit smoking I
[1:19:16] feel like a different person
[1:19:17] oops wait a minute you just got a new
[1:19:20] spirit but the Holy Spirit come in the
[1:19:22] middle of that spirit and when he come
[1:19:24] he make every main motion every
[1:19:26] intellectual everything agreeing right
[1:19:28] into this middle of the wheel God says
[1:19:30] if the days of miracles if Jesus is in
[1:19:33] yesterday forever the Holy Ghost will be
[1:19:34] a record and say Amen or do you believe
[1:19:37] that when you have the little temper
[1:19:40] fits on your flyout and your tell lies
[1:19:42] and your press alike and your job senses
[1:19:44] and you're so selfish with your
[1:19:45] organization and your song I reminded
[1:19:47] you can only hear you cannot hear
[1:19:49] another minister
[1:19:52] you mean that here buddy yeah let me
[1:19:56] read it again when you're so selfish
[1:19:59] with your organization that you're so
[1:20:01] narrow-minded you couldn't hear another
[1:20:04] minister just remember the holy spring
[1:20:06] isn't ticking inside of you every time
[1:20:12] somebody's looking down man looking at
[1:20:13] only my ambassador here they messed up
[1:20:16] big time because your spirit holy space
[1:20:20] and you wanna hear the world all glory
[1:20:27] Allah God so the Holy Spirit will make
[1:20:29] every movement like Christ it will make
[1:20:31] you Christ like the fruits of the spirit
[1:20:33] is love joy peace longsuffering goodness
[1:20:37] meekness gentleness patience fit all
[1:20:39] those things are hold on to that holy
[1:20:41] spirit so you can say we don't know what
[1:20:45] we're known but you and this person long
[1:20:47] time long time it is important grudge
[1:20:49] you gotta drop it that's a forgiving
[1:20:51] hope the person and move on yes yes you
[1:20:53] have to do that you have to love you
[1:20:55] have to love enemies have to look God
[1:20:57] has a blessed evade enemies the love let
[1:21:02] me say it again going to bless you with
[1:21:04] enemies that you could love I hate
[1:21:06] teaching that Jesus teach that love your
[1:21:07] enemies if only have Christian believers
[1:21:10] we are no enemy challenge the enemy
[1:21:13] coming a few most original everybody
[1:21:14] else because it's not in your group or
[1:21:16] not in your circle or Nothing your kind
[1:21:17] love your enemies mean trust that
[1:21:24] so that means you hand suppose they
[1:21:26] gonna fight with nobodies are you our
[1:21:35] emotions is not so much as jumping up
[1:21:36] and down you could do that a shindig
[1:21:38] will bring that to you a little pizza I
[1:21:48] rap music or some pixel cookie somebody
[1:21:51] get it up in the foot just like the
[1:21:52] music in church I shouldn't think we'll
[1:21:54] do pearl to you
[1:21:54] well he already saying here is Indiana
[1:21:57] but the Holy Spirit brings you into
[1:21:59] operation or in control of God that you
[1:22:02] walk in peace and in love and joy with
[1:22:04] long-suffering and gentleness you see it
[1:22:07] isn't something you do it is something
[1:22:10] the Holy Spirit does in you remember you
[1:22:12] can stop smoking and stop drinking that
[1:22:13] what you stop doing but when you get the
[1:22:15] operation of God that takes it out
[1:22:17] that's different because if you can stop
[1:22:20] everything you don't need Holy Spirit
[1:22:21] you just need to be you need to be the
[1:22:23] stopper you stop talking in here you
[1:22:26] stop smoking you're stop drinking you
[1:22:28] stop lying in your stop taking little
[1:22:29] smaller wine I decide and fun things and
[1:22:31] stop all other stuff
[1:22:35] somehow you manuscript Yahweh's wine
[1:22:38] good for you buddy or something and have
[1:22:42] a drink on a mountain underneath that
[1:22:44] disease you stop all of that see so
[1:22:49] therefore your recognizes God's
[1:22:51] operation in your life then you want
[1:22:53] more of him you worship Him the grid
[1:22:56] first and him praise God Amen so what
[1:22:59] you see it is no longer intellectual
[1:23:02] thought of your own it's yo-yo it's a
[1:23:05] subconscious moving of the Holy Spirit
[1:23:07] yeah but around I wish I could show the
[1:23:10] praises of God around the world to that
[1:23:15] you say you wish she could shout the
[1:23:18] principal a little more game
[1:23:22] there are many times we are put emphasis
[1:23:24] too much on I think on one citizen thing
[1:23:27] we put too much emphasis on emotions
[1:23:29] because the group of yes here tonight I
[1:23:32] feel very much at home in this pulpit
[1:23:33] I'm very welcome and I know I love you
[1:23:35] and that's why I see those things we
[1:23:37] have put too much emphasis on our
[1:23:38] emotions perhaps maybe we feel as long
[1:23:41] as we are shouting and praising the Lord
[1:23:42] that's fine
[1:23:43] I think that's good you say but in this
[1:23:45] Philadelphian church just received me as
[1:23:47] God's servant let me you would like to
[1:23:50] know what I think is it greatest need of
[1:23:52] the church today what I think what I
[1:23:54] think is lacking is no salt reveal the
[1:23:59] people are not broke up enough there is
[1:24:02] no burden seemingly you give me someone
[1:24:05] that so talk about lost souls they just
[1:24:08] cry want and a revival so bad they could
[1:24:12] hardly eat people are so selfish they
[1:24:14] wouldn't even testify the people about
[1:24:16] the Lord they really invite somebody
[1:24:18] service as far the concern they say man
[1:24:21] dies it is like the hell there's no
[1:24:26] travel of soul but when you're broken
[1:24:30] right now I have my sons and
[1:24:34] grandchildren and so on like that and I
[1:24:37] as a grandparent will want the children
[1:24:41] to be filled with the Holy Ghost because
[1:24:43] I'm sure to be filled with the Holy
[1:24:44] Ghost I have to pray for them I have to
[1:24:48] be concerned about them I just say well
[1:24:49] you know because they are my children or
[1:24:51] grandchildren
[1:24:56] because what what what they mean I can't
[1:24:59] give them God alone could give them so
[1:25:03] then we have to pray with a burden and
[1:25:04] unsafe same thing with the church if I
[1:25:08] could I give it to ya give it a already
[1:25:10] while holding about for every service I
[1:25:13] come hold me back at about a bank I do
[1:25:14] want a share a feeling selfish no the
[1:25:17] Bible said the kingdom is preached and
[1:25:19] everyone
[1:25:19] [Music]
[1:25:22] this continued every man who taught me
[1:25:26] preach upbringing bringing bringing
[1:25:27] bringing because he said no minutes I
[1:25:30] could bring a revival we have for 45
[1:25:33] years on wave arrival he said the people
[1:25:35] after bring it so I always understood
[1:25:38] the vision have to be transferred to the
[1:25:39] people and when you see the vision
[1:25:42] nobody could stop you know pass the cost
[1:25:44] of your worship and no nobody can stop
[1:25:46] you I'm approaching your board like we
[1:25:51] said the president of America even Prime
[1:25:53] Minister trailing that dead children
[1:25:55] when the children come they got a wheat

[1:26:39] us that's almost shut down for one
[1:26:40] sinner
[1:26:43] [Applause]
[1:26:45] when I say welcome to repent any holy
[1:26:47] rejoicing
[1:26:48] they say Allah here at look she

[1:27:01] when the last name come and holy not
[1:27:02] know your neighbors not the last one boy
[1:27:05] shut everything is fixed after that you
[1:27:08] have to keep reaching up today I got up
[1:27:12] I was sharing my wife you were seeing
[1:27:14] people see some experiment with
[1:27:17] thousands of all people help you over 60
[1:27:19] those who give money and do the gift
[1:27:21] service and I said the people that give
[1:27:23] service to others live longer than those
[1:27:26] who just give money those that help in
[1:27:28] each helping this one and they go into
[1:27:30] this home helping this wanna help in
[1:27:32] other words the joy of being selfless
[1:27:34] the joy of Sylvane the joy of doing this
[1:27:38] extended life than just passing the box
[1:27:43] is a science come with a thing you know
[1:27:48] what bombs eternal life is living for
[1:27:52] others so when you are you you yourself
[1:27:54] for myself and I you know what we don't
[1:27:56] it you're like shortening no I know
[1:27:59] gospel a I just see all right let's go
[1:28:03] wrong because a little more tonight let
[1:28:09] me stretch a little bit just a little
[1:28:11] bit if you notice this subconscious is
[1:28:17] where you live
[1:28:23] that is where you yourself live and
[1:28:28] that's the reason it's hard for them to
[1:28:30] have feet they say yes I could fit but
[1:28:33] don't hear somebody tell me it's not for
[1:28:35] you you hear any would say you can go
[1:28:38] free yeah because of a conscious and
[1:28:46] ever subconscious your conscious you're
[1:28:48] in the word and the contents want to
[1:28:50] agree with the word your conscious want
[1:28:51] to receive the word you can't just want
[1:28:53] to agree and work with the word but
[1:28:55] there's some god I've seen something
[1:28:55] else but you don't know what going true
[1:29:01] watch that's it friends many times in a
[1:29:09] meeting I noticed in a meeting watching
[1:29:12] these tapes they'll come back to the
[1:29:13] lines for the of discernment the people
[1:29:15] will be sitting there look like they are
[1:29:16] million miles away they don't think
[1:29:18] they're not even thinking about healing
[1:29:20] it's not their intellect is this
[1:29:22] subconscious working then he said your
[1:29:25] subconscious is your soul buddy
[1:29:36] spirit so that is why when somebody dies
[1:29:42] the human spirit breaks up not human
[1:29:46] spirit is we have CX CGC Doctor degree
[1:29:48] CEO all the position your nice house a
[1:29:52] nice car or Latin say that spirit when
[1:29:55] that breaks up now this soul comes up
[1:29:57] what you really are at the subconscious
[1:30:01] level three subconscious is really you
[1:30:07] subconscious is really very hot is that
[1:30:10] another man tink in his heart or his
[1:30:16] subconscious who is he
[1:30:18] see if we think he can't make it you
[1:30:20] can't if a teacher could make it you
[1:30:22] could make it because in your heart
[1:30:25] hallelujah killings I brought wood as it
[1:30:27] was in my heart so those other ministers
[1:30:30] couldn't deceive him because he had
[1:30:33] awareness and a consciousness of the
[1:30:35] promise of God that was more powerful of
[1:30:38] any enemy any giant David also had the
[1:30:42] same thing he never met Goliath before
[1:30:44] he said cut your head off even without a
[1:30:46] sword he was so convinced because he was
[1:30:49] operating at the subconscious level I
[1:30:51] [Music]
[1:30:53] mean subconscious level already know
[1:30:55] victory all glory to God I just love it
[1:31:02] tonight they had no one stone will do
[1:31:04] what he take up five I'm here and Tamika
[1:31:07] liya
[1:31:08] just one he needs a nobody took a five
[1:31:11] but he ran to meet Goliath he was
[1:31:14] operating on a subconscious level we can
[1:31:17] endure something
[1:31:17] Oh glory to God hallelujah where the
[1:31:21] bottom says no look not long ago to show
[1:31:25] PUFA quadword is the Bible said as a man
[1:31:27] taking his heart is that right the
[1:31:28] old-time infidel user say no isn't that
[1:31:30] crazy
[1:31:31] there is no mental faculties in a manner
[1:31:33] is a little blood blood but last year he
[1:31:36] said a big hand and science found this
[1:31:38] listen to this as found in the human
[1:31:40] heart there's a compartment that does
[1:31:43] Eve my blood cells in it it isn't in the
[1:31:46] animal it's only in the human it's the
[1:31:49] occupant of the soul so when a man
[1:31:52] distinct from his hat God was right Oh
[1:31:55] glory to God
[1:31:57] so therefore the other cometh
[1:31:58] consciousness I'm gonna be healed I'm
[1:32:00] gonna deliver tonight is my night
[1:32:08] this is amazing and this is of
[1:32:10] conscience he says take a walk from
[1:32:13] where I live the ARIMA to go up the
[1:32:16] drive in a sin a walk
[1:32:17] think about twenty minutes not walking
[1:32:19] on walking I want to walk up and I want
[1:32:20] to walk down so I walk up into the bank
[1:32:22] come back then when I started green cell
[1:32:24] phone I hadn't seen the rings on I
[1:32:27] wonder fulfil the complete to go back to
[1:32:29] back as a reinforcer I reach in his taxi
[1:32:32] stand away I could take an axe and go
[1:32:33] home I had a choice
[1:32:34] take a taxi and go home or keep walking
[1:32:36] keep walking I ain't boy like any ring
[1:32:38] and after I passed I gave him around a
[1:32:41] Noreen I said look at that now boy
[1:32:44] what if I jump in that car I break the
[1:32:46] whole spirit I want to do this thing
[1:32:47] because my body needed I feel good I
[1:32:52] said look at that in life sometimes
[1:32:54] these choices you make other choice
[1:32:56] the taxi Sun is there rain is falling
[1:32:58] wasn't falling hard but that's why I
[1:33:00] come here you know rain drizzling oh
[1:33:05] come here you know but I forget that I
[1:33:06] decide I want to walk I gonna keep on
[1:33:09] walking
[1:33:09] and I just walk straight to that you
[1:33:12] know what to induct is the level of this
[1:33:14] subconscious at work there if you're
[1:33:15] consciously watching arenal god we go
[1:33:17] for my body I'm gonna open up and what
[1:33:19] that I am and walking many things that
[1:33:21] happen
[1:33:22] you've got past your consciousness it's
[1:33:24] not what you see it's what it is healing
[1:33:27] from what I see so what you're here is
[1:33:29] what you deserve
[1:33:30] I will talk about Delilah what Samson
[1:33:34] didn't see is holy devil you see Lila
[1:33:36] she knows she good she look pretty
[1:33:39] everything else here you know and she's
[1:33:41] a nice person of good intention but the
[1:33:43] demon behind she is a no good intention
[1:33:44] he intend to strip Samson and the demon
[1:33:48] seed is a channel he could use so keep
[1:33:50] on fellowship and keep on going
[1:33:52] he will cut your head off befooling
[1:34:00] would what she didn't the hill okay so
[1:34:09] watch the right
[1:34:12] all right so we almost done thank you
[1:34:14] lord beginning economy I think we almost
[1:34:20] done no tomorrow night
[1:34:25] you know you come and listen a while
[1:34:27] cause you want to take our time and
[1:34:28] leave that would also close that the
[1:34:31] devil would deem up a little speck a
[1:34:33] room to move and when you let your feet
[1:34:35] run out to its kin till hear this you
[1:34:39] begin to believe and let your
[1:34:41] subconscious go to actin then the fate
[1:34:44] of God we'll back it up come here your
[1:34:49] lecture fate run out until they come to
[1:34:51] the place where you begin to believe

[1:35:30] know who your father is cause your faith
[1:35:34] won't do too much he say your
