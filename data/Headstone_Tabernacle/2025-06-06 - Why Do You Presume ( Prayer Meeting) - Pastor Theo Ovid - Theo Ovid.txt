Heavenly Father, we thank you for bringing us together again tonight. And this is a privilege. This is an honor. And I pray and trust that each one would take it as that. We would not always have this opportunity, Father, to seek your face and to cry unto you. Because when that angel came along Revelation 10, Lord, the voice said, "Time shall be no more. Time itself runs out. The time is running out. Running out for the world system. Run off empires, kingdoms, countries. Time is running out. Father, soon we'll be meeting you. Oh God, I pray that you would speak a word to us that will bring light and life and bring a present reality. We're not here to fool the people, deceive the people, or say something just to make them feel good or or whatever, but they need to hear truth. So, may truth come forth tonight by your word and by your spirit that will lead us into a channel of prayer where we have direct access to you and your presence. Granted, God, in Jesus name I ask it. Amen. And amen. God bless you. And welcome tonight. Tonight, I have something I like to share with you before we get on in prayer. And if you have your Bibles, I'd like you to turn your Bibles to Numbers chapter 14, reading verse 41 to 45. After all the scriptures and see how that goes. Numbers chapter 14 verse 41 to 45. And Moses said, "Wherefore do we transgress the commandment of the Lord, but it shall not prosper? Go not up, for the Lord is not among among you, that he be not smitten before your enemies. For the Amalachites and the Canaanites are there before you, and he shall fall by the sword because ye are turned away from the Lord. Therefore, the Lord will not be with you. But they presumed to go up unto the hilltop. Nevertheless, the ark of the covenant of the Lord and Moses departed not out of the camp. Then the Amalachites came down and the Canaanites which dwell in the hill and smoke them and discomforted them even unto Homer. Reading Judges chapter 16 19 to 21 from the scripture reading from verse 19. This is Elila. She made him sleep talking about Samson upon her knees and she called for a man and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head and she began to afflict him and his strength went from him. And she said, "The Philistines be upon thee, Samson." And he awoke out of his sleep and said, "I will go out as at other times before and shake myself." And he wished not that the Lord was departed from him. But the Philistines took him, put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bong him with fetterss of brass, and he did grind in the prison hopes. Our last scripture is from Luke chapter 2 reading from verse 42. And when he was 12 years old, speaking about Jesus, Luke 2:42, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast. And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tried behind in Jerusalem. And Joseph and his mother knew not of it. But they supposing him to have been in the company went a day's journey, and they sought him among their kinfolk and acquaintance. And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him. And it came to pass after 3 days, they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them and asking them questions. And all that heard them were astonished at his understanding and answers. And when they saw him, they were amazed. And his mother said unto him, "Son, why hast thou dealt with us? Behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrow." And he said unto them, "How is it that he sought me? They see not that I must be about my father's business. May God bless his word." Thanks again for being here tonight. Tonight, I have something to share with you. Why do you presume? That's my title tonight. Why do you presume? Now to presume is to suppose that something is the case on the basis of probability. To presume is to take for granted that something exist or is the case. Presuming is to adventure without authority. Presumption makes you jump to conclusion. Why do you presume? And remember the scripture we read these guys and if I got time to read it, these guys believe the Lord is with them, but they're presuming that Moses telling them point blank. God is not with you because you turn from the Lord. And this will reflect on all those people who like dates and this happened in this year 1982 or June or August or September and he was with me four years ago and three years ago and all the sort of historical drama I call that. But where is that in relevance to now and you will see what I'm we're getting at. Just hear these words. So God told him every place you put your foot is yours, right? And he said, "Now to you people that was prayed for all of you last night and somebody laid hands on you. We prayed. The presence of God came down and revealed himself right with the word to show that is the truth. There's no fooling. There's no mistake. It's the truth. We don't presume anything. We lay aside reasoning. We cast them down and take the word. Take the word and move on. The word said so. Now you say then the promise is mine." So God say the land is yours. Every place you take your foot is yours. Sure, but you'll fight every inch of it till you're well. Listen to what he's saying. He's talking to sick people and he's saying you cannot sit there and just presume you'll be well, presume or hope you're going to get well. You have to fight until you're well. Now, I don't believe in accepting sickness as a as God's will, God's plan. I am I reject that. I don't care what the sickness is. Sickness is of the devil. God could use sickness to discipline somebody and straighten somebody out. But healing is deterren. It is my right to claim healing. Can the doctor tell me I have 24 hours to live? It is my right to claim my healing even if I die 24 hours. But my right ears as a son, as a Christian, is to claim my healing. This is what I'm called to do. So brother Brandham says, "The promise is yours, minds, but you'll fight every inch of it till you're well. You will take every step of it. It's a battle. The promise is yours." That was a promised land. That was the promised land. But they had to fight to get every step of it. And the promise is yours, but you'll fight every inch of it. I was called by God to preach the gospel. 31 years ago I fought every ever since every inch of ground I fought with the sword of God taking the promise and cutting away. Now listen to this. Now this is getting deeper here. Now, now the way men and women do today, they will go so far in God. They will say, "I believe. Yes, I'll be baptized. I'll do this. Any rules of the church has to lay down." But when it come to surrender everything to Christ, so going to church, that's not a problem. Getting baptized, that's not a problem. Coming every Sunday, that's not a problem. hear this part. But when it comes to surrender everything to Christ, your life and all, that is where the line leaves. That is what make people say, "Well, I look at the rest of them." And here to you older Christians to to the younger the younger women look at the older women, the younger men look at the older men and see the way you conduct yourselves, see what you do. and they presume that they are all right is because you do the way you do. So what is he saying? The older women should be setting an example. The older men should be setting an example. Why is somebody watching you? You are older. He said now if the Pentecostal church would really live to its standard, if it would have lived what it claims to have, then the world will thirst after it. But when they got to see the Pentecostal church let down with so many things almost as the world has got, then they presume that they're just as good as you are. So why come to church? If you dress the way you dress, I could dress so too. If you're not sincere, I can be not sincere too. If you at the edge, I could be at the edge too. So watch you say what but we have got away from that. We can't presume. And tonight, if there's one thing I want to get across to you, let's not presume anything. Don't presume anything. We can't presume it. We have got to line up in the word. Now, it's almost an impossible thing to get people praying, fasting, calling on the Lord. See how weighted these words are relating to now. It is almost impossible thing to get people praying, fasting, calling on the Lord. It seemed like the church has got so drowsy and lazy in these last days, so pitiful. And I hate to come and just keep stirring and preaching and saying these things. But brother, sister, that's the truth. I just can't hold it. It's the gospel. It must be preached. So I think we are just presuming too much. We presume, this is huge. We presume, here we go. Because we had an experience five years ago, Brother Brandon, I was walking down the street one day and the Holy Spirit just blessed me and I run down the street. I thought, Lord, you have to take me somewhere cuz I I'm going to miss being on the street. Maybe you were out in the church and you got an experience. You spoke with tongues and think, well, that's all right. I can go ahead and okay, I see the rest of them doing this. You're just presuming that. So he is showing where historical experiences in context. People had genuine experiences 5 years ago, 10 years ago, 3 years ago. But what is happening now? Israel. Yeah. Here why you typing it. Israel had these experiences. Israel had come out of Egypt. Israel had seen signs and miracles and wonders all along the road. They had passed through the Red Sea and dry land. They've seen mana fall out of heaven every night. They were witnessing the blessings of God upon their life. But then they failed. They disobey one of God's commandment. And what happened? The blessing cut off from them. They presume here we go that because God had been so good, he just go on be good on. But God can't do that. And I think we have come to that spot. We come to Aespania and God has given the issue for the church to call a halt and back to our prayer life, back to consecration, back to a spot where we consecrate ourselves away from the things of the world and away from our little petty differences among us and get back to God and brotherly love and humility. Back to the power of God again. You see, we line it up back to God. What next? Brotherly love. That's how you're going to deal and treat your brother. And what next? Humility. Back to the power of God. We are just presuming. And we are running. All right. But God is blessing. He was blessing Israel probably. Listen. Oh my goodness. He was blessing Israel the probably the same day they refused to go and take the promised land. The same day that the disbelieve the spies, listen to this church, the mana fell that same night, but they were all together out of the will of God. So this is people thinking that the blessings of God is with them despite of what they don't understand. God blessing just like the rain falling just and unjust. But God is trusting and believing that you will get back on track. and not rock back. You know, God still blessing me, but I'm doing this. That Samson, he's doing this. He's lying. He's doing this. He's doing that. But the covenant, he hasn't confess that yet. He hasn't broken that yet. When Delilah break him and he talk about his hair, she get them to come and cut him. And the Bible says that Samson shake himself as other times. So, he's telling himself, you know what? Uh, God is with me. Um, I throw it off. I break it off and it going to happen again. And then afterwards he recognized he did not even realize God was no longer with him. The anointing left him. He was just like a ordinary man. He didn't understand the strength, power, anointing, grace and uncction. It was by divine intervention was by of God. And you cannot play with that. It's not a play thing. So listen, they were all together out of the will of God. They could not win another battle until they come back and made things right with God. I think it is time for the church to get back to God again. Let me ask a question. When last have you won a battle? When last have you won a battle? You're in a battle and in a fight and you come true. When last has that happened to you that you say win a battle? And if you're not winning your battles, what is happening to your Christian walk? Because he promised to be with you. He promised to go before you. He promised to make a way for you. I'm not talking about little stumbles and what to do. I talking about win back. I think it's which was um brother Brian. I'm talking about or or Brother Gideon on Wednesday night was talking about um comprehensive licks beating the devil comprehensively where you have victory where you overcome where even though you're wrestling and you roll on the floor you get up on top. It can't it can't be a draw. It can't be well you know 50/50 50 50. No 50 50. You won. You overcome. You you you conquer what was conquering you. You have conquered it now. That is what we're talking about. Oh, praise the Lord. Let me see if we wrap up here. Brother, I think the time for the church to get back to God again, get back and get started like it was going on our journey. Yet, they know God was a good God. He was full of mercy. He had given them mercy. He had showed them his glory. Even their shoes wasn't wearing out. Their clothes wasn't getting tread bear. Mana was falling from heaven every night. They seen miracles and signs all along of the presence of God with them. Yet, here we go. This is so important. Yet, they presumed that because God had did that, they could go up there and take that mountain. So they they're joining strength from the historical experiences of what God did in the past and they taking that presuming as a cue as a sign that based upon the past I could plow into the future to say I'm conquering and overcoming and so on like that that line. But here it is, brother B. If we want spiritual gifts in the church, if we want the power of God, the real power of God, now I tell you, brother, sister, it's so easy for someone to be deceived on sensation and things. The devil can impersonate any any sensation that God has got. But you see, our church is not moving the way it should move. We know there is something wrong. We know then that God will not be with us until whatever it is is straightened out. So it is time to check up and see the things that we should do and what things we should not do. Look how specific this is. You are checking your own heart, your own mind, life, spirit to see what things you should do and to see the things that you should not do and then get ready and for that blessing. Now, good people almost done caught up in this thing. Good people, sincere people like Mary and Joseph, that why I read the scripture. They were very sincere. See, thinking he was with them when he wasn't. Mary and Joseph, I'm going to skip a little bit and so on. And many people think that he was with them when they shook hand with the preacher and put their name on the book, but he wasn't. Many people thought when they were sprinkled, confirmed, baptized in the name of fathers and holy ghost thinking he was with them. They're good people. Mary and Joseph, good people. The facts was he wasn't there. And then he said these words, don't presume anything. The foolish virgins, I'll close with this. The foolish virgins presume two things. One, they presume that the oil that they had was enough. So they didn't see the need to pray like tonight to get some extra oil. They didn't see that need. And two, they presume they still had time to buy. So when the wise told them, "Go to them that sell," they went. They actually went. They actually thought shop was going to be open only to realize shop closed. No oil for sale. You can have oil in the shop but the shop is closed. Who go selling the oil? Go to them that sell. The foolish virgins in this message. I'm not talking about outside the message. In this message one day they're going to wake up and recognize they have word. They have lamp but they don't have oil. They have light. They have the lamp profession confession but they don't have oil. The foolish version had oil you know but the oil ran out. Friends, let's not take things for granted. There are some people I'm not like that. I try not to be like that. They like to have the gas meter close to E. My thinking is this. If some emergency come and you have a little gas in your car, how you're going to make that trip if an emergency come, I like to know that my tank is full whether or not you're going anywhere because I tell myself is better you're full and you're ready then you're close to empty and you're looking for the gas station. Now the gas station might be open but current might gone. If the current gone, they can't pump no gas. So the gas station is open but current just go. You still can't get the gas. So let's gas up tonight. Don't presume anything. Let's get some extra oil tonight. Israel presume that because God historically was with them, they could go up and fight. Moses tell them, "No, you cannot go up and fight nothing. You will get licks." And you know what the Bible said? Licks. They got licks. They get blows because they was off track. So God, help us tonight to get back on track. Search your own heart. Search your own self. Don't get into arrogance. Don't get into the message pride. And most of all, the entitlement that I see ever so often of people who think that because they believe this message, God entitled them some kind of thing. I don't know what they feel entitled to. But to me, you're entitled to die out. You're entitled to press. You're entitled to overcome. You're entitled to sweat it out. When they wanted wanted to when they wanted Clarence, when they wanted water and and and the prophet came down, he said, "Dig." He say just just sprinkle something, you know, dig. Get your fork and dig. You want to get water one inch, you dig one in. You'll get one inch of water. If you want to get more water than that, you have to dig deeper. And that is what we're here to do tonight. Dig. It's a labor. It's a grind. It's a grit. But if you do it, you'll reap the benefit of it. I put a little note from the pastors just this morning, yesterday, about fasting and how it's something to accompany prayer. How fasting get you more spiritually attuned. It is part of the Christian experience. You cannot tell me you walk in a Christian life and you have no clue what fasting is all about. This is part of the Christian walk in the flesh prophet nothing. You have to get in tune with the spirit some point in time and this is a platform an opportunity that we can get our spirits in tune with the mind of God. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, I thank you tonight for this word and I pray it rock us and shake us tonight. The wise virgin, the foolish virgin in their arrogance, they saw no need to get extra oil. They were comfortable with what they have. They felt satisfied. They felt they had the books, the tapes, and they were good. They could go and take a sleep. But then at midnight, the bright room call came out a meeting. They began to light the lamps only to realize a short little light up and then the lamps went out and they choose to ask the wise virgins, "Share now. Press the share button and share with us. Give us of your oil." And the wise was wise enough to tell them, "Not so, not this time. We only have enough for us and for the journey that's ahead of us. Go and buy." Father, what words to hear, go and buy. May we buy tonight. May we pay the price tonight. May we presume nothing tonight, but believe that this word is from you and this word is to be enrw written in our hearts that we will believe that you could confirm and bring assurance in our hearts as to what you want us to do, what you want us not to do, where you want us to go, how you want us to operate. Bless your people tonight. Bless the elders, the deacons, the ushers. Bless the leoty. Father, bless the song leaders, the equipment, the musicians. Bless from the pulpit to the backbench, all the helps, all the support around the church. Bless the upcoming meetings we're going to have in July. Father, may your hand extend. Lord, you promise a five ministry that would step forward, an international ministry that would minister to the bride body around the world. It will be the ministry of Jesus Christ. Oh God, step forward in this hour, Lord, and confirm your word with signs and wonders. Even tonight, I pray the anointing will break forth in homes, in hearts, in lives. Lord, may it accomplish healing, restoration, touch minds tonight. Touch hearts tonight. Touch spirits tonight. Touch the soul of people tonight that they'll be stirred up in spirit just as you stirred up the spirit of the people to restore the wall of Jerusalem. Just as you stirred up the people's spirit to build the temple. Oh God, stir our spirits tonight, knowing that there's a temple to be built, this statue of a perfect man. Oh God, bring a revival in our souls, in our hearts. Many are tired and weary. Many have long been in a vineyard, but give them strength, Lord. Even strength in the inner man tonight that Lord, we know that this walk and this journey has not been in vain. It's a privilege and an honor. Like I will say sometime, I wake up, I say, I thank you, Jesus. I have activity in my limbs. There are people who don't have that, Lord. But we have it, Lord. Even though there may be aches and pains, but we have activity in our limbs that we can give you praise and honor and glory. Father, once more, I ask that your healing virtue would go out to those that are sick. Lord, those that are weary, those that need encouragement, go out to them and minister to them and meet their need right where they are. May the pillar of fire sweep into their homes just like I told the prophet, I will meet you in there. Oh God, meet them where they are tonight. I commit them into your hands. I come at this time I pray into your hands in Jesus name I ask it. Amen and amen. Praise the Lord. So I trust tonight that the few words that were shared would be edified and strengthened to you. We cannot presume anything you know and and with that mindset you know you could press on. You could press on to believe God will come down and bless you because you to start right at the base not presuming nothing. You know Ram said this. He said that um the early church had so much of God and they acted and prayed as if they didn't have much. They keep praying for more and more. He said this last church don't have nothing much like what the early church has and they're not in that spirit atmosphere. We want to be hungry, thirsty like David said as the heart p after the book. This is the spirit atmosphere we want to be in. God bless you as we get on in prayer. Amen. Praise the Lord. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat.

Father, when we look to your word where we could look at our own desires to see if we have that passion to know the word, if we have that cry to get in the spirit and if we have that fervent desire to please you, oh God, may this be a moto, Lord. May this be a team. May this be a template for us, Lord, a passion to know your word, a cry to get in the spirit and a fervent desire to please you, to please you above everything else. to put you first, Lord, to seek first the kingdom. Oh God, help your people tonight. Bless the services coming Sunday. May the anointing roar through the church, Father. May there be a blast of the Holy Spirit. May you ride a trail once more with healing in your wings. God, may we see the restoration of every gift back in the church. Oh God, not just talking about a five-fold ministry, but every gift, healing, discernment, tongues, interpretation of tongues, prophecy, every gift to be back in the church. Repair our hearts, Lord. Sanctify us, Lord. Give us a wave of holiness, a wave of purity, a wave of a undefiled life, walking around without a blemish, oh God. Set the church in order. Set our hearts are right. Lord, set us on focus and we didn't presume anything, but we will wait upon you. You said in your word that the church couldn't wait. Eve couldn't wait. The church don't want to wait for the real Holy Spirit to come into the church to work and to perform and to do. Oh God, help us, Father, that we wouldn't jerk below. We wouldn't run ahead, but we will truly wait upon you, Father. Even as they promise they wait, shall we their strength. May each one here tonight be empowered. May each one here tonight be strengthened. Strengthen me in a man. Strengthen for the rest of the journey, Father. May they feast on the word of God. May they feast on the unfailing body word of the son of man that they could have the strength to press on in this journey. Father, through trials, through testing, through tribulation, through dark hour. Oh God, help us tonight. Bless bless your people tonight. Bless your children tonight. Bless the upcoming convention tonight. May your presence be dear and with the ministers, with the greeters, with the songs, with the worship, with everything, Father, that it will bring, as Binian preach on Wednesday night, glory to you, Father. It will be for your honor. It will be for your glory, Father. Our lives will be for your honor and for your glory. This is how we should live. This is how we must live to live for your honor and your glory. We commit our lives into your hands, your people into your hands in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. God bless your saints. We are so blessed to be here tonight and I pray that you get a charge. That is what we come to hook up tonight for. To get a fresh charge of this Holy Ghost power. God bless you. We dismissed. Praise the Lord.
