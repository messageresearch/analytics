[49:33] heart and life Lord may you move in

[49:38] we just surrender to your will and to
[49:41] your program tonight father have your

[49:46] Lord may you just uh uh take control of

[50:05] God I want to take my time tonight I
[50:09] uh amen it's been quite a week
[50:12] already um but we thank God for the
[50:14] holidays
[50:15] tomorrow and for a time of rest amen
[50:18] amen praise God but um I have a thought
[50:22] here
[50:23] tonight and it comes off of something we
[50:26] just share sh with the young
[50:29] people uh just Saturday gone we had a
[50:32] you a youth Gathering
[50:35] service and um we had such a great time
[50:38] in the presence of the Lord and so I
[50:40] felt led to bring back some of these
[50:42] thoughts here tonight that you know we
[50:44] would have shared there
[50:46] and trust it would be a blessing to you
[50:48] tonight amen as we talk on the word amen
[50:52] so I have a title tonight it's called
[50:54] shaping and forming
[50:57] of the sons of
[50:59] God shaping and the forming of the sons
[51:05] of
[51:06] God
[51:08] Amen and um just give me one second here
[51:11] I'm just going to get a file quick amen
[51:15] but uh we just read that scripture there
[51:19] Psalms 51 isn't that right and in that
[51:23] scripture he says plainly here behold I
[51:26] was shapen in
[51:29] iniquity and in sin did my mother
[51:33] conceive me isn't that
[51:35] right uh there was a shaping that took
[51:39] place when you were born here on Earth
[51:42] you came that way the Bible says you
[51:45] were shaped in iniquity it was not your
[51:50] choice you just come in that condition
[51:54] you didn't choose to battle
[51:57] but you came here and found a battle
[52:00] from the moment that you were born you
[52:03] were born into struggle born into a
[52:08] conflict isn't that right the Bible says
[52:11] there was war in heaven isn't that right
[52:15] and Michael fought and the dragon fought
[52:19] and there was no place found for the
[52:21] dragon so he had to find a place
[52:24] somewhere else because heaven is not a
[52:27] place for Dragons Heaven is a place for
[52:30] God and His angels and Purity and
[52:35] righteousness and love and tonight we
[52:39] come to reflect that same Heavenly Glory
[52:43] there's no place for dragons in here
[52:45] tonight there's only place for worship
[52:48] and for Glory and for giving God praise
[52:52] and for thanking God for what he has
[52:55] done there's no no place for negative
[52:58] thoughts negative attitudes there's only
[53:01] place for Revival and for worship and
[53:05] for getting on fire for God and for
[53:09] getting into the spirits this is a place
[53:12] to let off the pressure this is a place
[53:15] to shout this is a place to lift your
[53:19] hands this is a place to let the devil
[53:22] know whose side you are on let the devil
[53:26] know that you're on the Lord's Side that
[53:29] you're not here to take sides with
[53:31] demons but you're here to take sides
[53:33] with God that you're here to take sides
[53:36] with righteousness oh I to stand for all
[53:40] the things that Jesus stood for oh can I
[53:44] get an amen tonight oh am I speaking to
[53:48] Christians tonight am I speaking to
[53:50] people who are not afraid to show their
[53:54] true colors who are not afraid to make a
[53:58] stand while they're here on planet Earth
[54:02] oh we're not afraid of the devil and all
[54:05] of his forces but we're here to stand
[54:07] for the truth we're here to back up the
[54:10] word we're here to get filled with the
[54:14] Holy Ghost and Fire we're here to be
[54:17] changed we're here to be shaped we're
[54:20] here to be formed uh into the word image
[54:24] be not conformed to this world but the
[54:28] Bible says be transformed uh by the
[54:32] renewing of your mind that you might
[54:36] prove come on now what is that good and
[54:40] acceptable and perfect will of God oh

[54:48] something uh or don't stand for nothing
[54:50] at all I didn't come all this way
[54:53] tonight just to occupy a church
[54:57] but I come to stand uh upon the word of
[55:00] God oh Heaven and Earth uh will pass
[55:04] away but my word shall never pass away
[55:09] oh are you here tonight to be conformed
[55:14] uh to the image of his son and to be
[55:17] changed into that image from glory to
[55:21] glory to glory even as by the spirit of
[55:26] of the Lord oh there's an anointing
[55:29] coming tonight a glory that is getting
[55:33] bur to rest upon the Sons and Daughters
[55:36] of God uh in the last days say it God uh

[56:49] condition almost like
[56:51] a pre-shape or prefabrication
[56:58] uh but the objective of God is not for
[57:02] us to remain like
[57:05] that we thank God for giving us his
[57:08] word so that now he could begin a
[57:11] process of shaping us
[57:14] over of changing us from what we are now
[57:18] into what we are meant to
[57:20] be if Adam hadn't fallen in the Garden
[57:23] of Eden we would have come
[57:26] perfect knowing
[57:28] everything under the control of the
[57:31] master which is God himself we would
[57:35] have been just like attribute Sons just
[57:38] expressed in the fullness of
[57:40] that but it come that we bypass our
[57:43] theophany and drop down into flesh in
[57:46] this condition not knowing anything and
[57:50] needing God's help more than ever I
[57:53] thank God that he didn't leave us in
[57:55] that condition
[57:57] but he sent his only begotten son to
[58:00] shed his blood for us on
[58:02] Calvary and because of that sacrifice he
[58:06] has made an entrance for us to make a
[58:09] way for us to come back into Redemption
[58:13] isn't that
[58:14] right
[58:16] amen and amen so shaping and
[58:19] forming that's the subject of what we
[58:22] want to talk about
[58:24] tonight now we know that the world is
[58:26] made of shapes isn't that right the
[58:28] whole world if you look at it you know
[58:30] from a simple perspective we can see
[58:33] that it's made up of shapes different
[58:35] types of
[58:36] shapes you know and uh you on the on the
[58:39] internet tonight you in this building
[58:43] when you look around this building we
[58:44] look around where we are and our homes
[58:47] and we could see different shapes it's a
[58:49] very simple concept and I my trade as a
[58:54] designer and my skill that God has
[58:56] blessed me with um by the grace of God
[59:00] um this is kind of how I guess we see
[59:02] the world you know when everybody's
[59:04] walking around trying to pay bills and
[59:05] stuff we're staying into space because
[59:08] we're seeing all these
[59:09] shapes very interesting shapes some of
[59:13] them very unique some of them common
[59:18] common to the naked eye but the
[59:20] interesting thing is that all these
[59:22] shapes are meant for a purpose for
[59:24] instance the chairs that you're sitting
[59:26] on tonight are a series of this
[59:28] different shapes that were welded
[59:30] together to serve a specific purpose
[59:33] it's not just a loose shape but the the
[59:36] wisdom that God put into man is to be
[59:38] able to put these things together so
[59:41] that it can serve a particular purpose
[59:43] or
[59:44] function and it just like a natural
[59:46] thing is put together and welded
[59:50] together and fabricated together in
[59:52] order to serve a particular function or
[59:55] purpose so too are you tonight so too
[59:59] are all lives a series of shapes that
[1:00:04] God is putting together in order to
[1:00:06] serve a particular function Hallelujah
[1:00:09] in order to serve in a particular
[1:00:11] purpose or capacity isn't that
[1:00:14] right amen and this is uh this is the
[1:00:18] basic concept of it isn't that right and
[1:00:23] um yeah so it's made up of shapes isn't
[1:00:26] that right your life is made up of
[1:00:28] shapes as well and the interesting thing
[1:00:31] tonight is that God knows the shape of
[1:00:34] us tonight I'm not talking about your
[1:00:37] natural shape but I'm talking about your
[1:00:39] spiritual shape what shape that you are
[1:00:43] in tonight when you look in the mirror
[1:00:46] of the word how do we see
[1:00:48] ourselves how have we been shaped so
[1:00:52] it's quite an interesting thing to
[1:00:53] reflect on and I pray that you reflect
[1:00:55] on it
[1:00:56] tonight in an inward way so that we can
[1:01:00] begin to take account of our lives and
[1:01:03] see literally what shape are we in
[1:01:06] tonight are we in good shape are we in a
[1:01:09] bad shape do we need
[1:01:12] shaping do we need help
[1:01:15] tonight I believe there's a Master Mason
[1:01:17] in the room tonight and his name is
[1:01:21] Jesus and he can do things that we could
[1:01:23] never do or dream of he can shape us
[1:01:27] tonight shape us into what we want to to
[1:01:30] be tonight what he desires for us
[1:01:33] tonight oh on a higher place in a higher
[1:01:37] level he could take you tonight anybody
[1:01:40] that interacted with Jesus never
[1:01:42] remained the same whatever experience
[1:01:45] they had with him something about that
[1:01:48] experience shaped them differently they
[1:01:51] came in one way and then all of a sudden
[1:01:53] they were shaped differently
[1:01:56] maybe their mindset changed maybe they
[1:01:59] were depressed but something about
[1:02:01] meeting the Messiah had an effect on the
[1:02:04] shape of them tonight oh Hallelujah they
[1:02:07] came in prostitutes and they left clean
[1:02:10] they came in sick and they left healed
[1:02:14] they came in blind and all of a sudden
[1:02:17] something happened and they begin to see
[1:02:20] oh they came in spiritually blind and he
[1:02:23] opened their understanding that they
[1:02:25] might understand the
[1:02:27] scriptures understand where they were
[1:02:30] who they were and what they are to be oh
[1:02:34] what a wonderful thing it is to
[1:02:37] encounter this Jesus Oh hallelujah
[1:02:40] hallelujah hallelujah because no matter
[1:02:43] what Society does they could never have
[1:02:46] this transforming power that Jesus tends
[1:02:50] to have Society can put you in jail and
[1:02:54] they will in the e effort to reform you
[1:02:57] or to try to make you over to be fit for
[1:03:00] society but only the power of God could
[1:03:04] transform your nature only the power of
[1:03:08] God could transform your being oh
[1:03:11] Hallelujah can give you something
[1:03:13] powerful and give you something real
[1:03:16] isn't that
[1:03:17] right so God is the god of our destiny
[1:03:20] do you believe
[1:03:21] that he's a god that is in charge of our
[1:03:24] lives and he is the one putting you
[1:03:27] together
[1:03:28] tonight and putting you getting you in
[1:03:33] shape he's like your personal gym
[1:03:36] instructor he's working on you working
[1:03:40] on you and he's still working on you so
[1:03:44] tell the devil tonight I may not be what
[1:03:46] I want to be but I'm certainly not what
[1:03:49] I used to be he's still working on me
[1:03:53] tonight I may not be the perfect parent
[1:03:57] but I'm getting there I may not be the
[1:03:59] perfect son but I'm getting there I may
[1:04:02] not be the perfect daughter the perfect
[1:04:04] wife or the perfect husband but by the
[1:04:07] grace of God the word of God is teaching
[1:04:10] us how to get there and we know that by
[1:04:14] faith when we get there oh hallelujah
[1:04:16] we're going to be just like him oh Hal
[1:04:19] we going to see him as he is oh H we're
[1:04:22] going to see him face to face
[1:04:26] do you believe that
[1:04:27] tonight amen and amen so God is very
[1:04:30] interested tonight in our shape and he's
[1:04:34] interested in our form am he's
[1:04:36] interested in what we look like amen
[1:04:39] spiritually speaking yes sir because
[1:04:41] when we look back at the creation story
[1:04:43] we realize that you should have come a
[1:04:45] different way shaped a different way
[1:04:49] formed a different way but unfortunately
[1:04:53] because of the form man kind is all bent
[1:04:57] out of
[1:04:58] shape they are
[1:05:01] deformed they are without
[1:05:04] Conformity uh they are out of
[1:05:07] character out of order it seems isn't
[1:05:10] that right and more they go on is the
[1:05:13] more they become out of
[1:05:15] shape out of form until men want to be
[1:05:18] like
[1:05:19] women women want to dress like men
[1:05:22] becomes more and more like that because
[1:05:24] it start off bad to begin with so what
[1:05:27] we need now is a conversion what we need
[1:05:30] now is a change tonight and the only way
[1:05:33] that could come is by the baptism of the
[1:05:35] Holy Spirit an infusion of God's power
[1:05:39] in your soul to cause a change tonight
[1:05:43] in your nature and in your being
[1:05:46] Hallelujah because you can't do that
[1:05:48] naturally it's going to take something
[1:05:50] Supernatural tonight to change your
[1:05:53] Supernatural form to change your
[1:05:56] spiritual likeness and to make you like
[1:05:59] Jesus Christ to give you those Seven
[1:06:02] Virtues to give you those seven
[1:06:05] manifestations of one Holy Spirit into
[1:06:08] the individual it'll take a supernatural
[1:06:12] power in order to do that and to change
[1:06:15] you into this shape and change you into
[1:06:18] this form isn't that right so God is
[1:06:22] interested in our shape scientifically
[1:06:24] we could scientifically sorry we can say
[1:06:26] that our construct our human body is
[1:06:28] made up of shapes isn't that right or
[1:06:30] nose or eyes or facial construct and
[1:06:33] what we see outside as features of our
[1:06:36] natural appearance is really a
[1:06:38] reflection of a deeper construct which
[1:06:41] is our skeletal frame and our
[1:06:44] muscle uh tissue isn't that right all
[1:06:48] these deeper things is what actually
[1:06:50] give life to what we see on the surface
[1:06:54] that's why each one of us is unique yeah
[1:06:56] each one of us is made different there's
[1:06:58] no one person with the same fingerprint
[1:07:00] as the other even the iris and all these
[1:07:04] things are unique to you because God
[1:07:07] knows how you are shaped God knows how
[1:07:10] you are formed amen and beautifully and
[1:07:14] wonderfully are you made tonight give
[1:07:17] the Lord some Praises hallelujah
[1:07:21] hallelujah and I love it because his
[1:07:23] objective is not for you to stay even as
[1:07:25] you are
[1:07:26] but he wants to bring you to Perfection
[1:07:28] he wants to bring you into adoption he
[1:07:31] wants to bring you into the place where
[1:07:33] you could have the power of a son to
[1:07:36] sign the check and to do the father's
[1:07:39] will and to operate the father's
[1:07:41] business and the father's business is
[1:07:44] signs wonders and miracles the father's
[1:07:47] business is healing of the sick the
[1:07:49] father's business is raising the Dead
[1:07:52] the father's business is casting out
[1:07:53] devils and God wants people tonight in
[1:07:57] shape he wants people tonight in a
[1:08:00] certain form so that they could take up
[1:08:02] their mantle of authority to take up
[1:08:06] their mantle of position of power in the
[1:08:09] kingdom of God as sons of God and begin
[1:08:13] to do the works of the father and then
[1:08:16] you could be like Jesus and say I do
[1:08:19] only that which pleases my Father in
[1:08:21] Heaven don't you know I'm about my
[1:08:25] father father's business oh I want to be
[1:08:28] about my father's business tonight oh
[1:08:31] the devil has people distracted to in
[1:08:34] this to in that but I believe there's a
[1:08:37] people in here tonight who are
[1:08:40] interested in the Holy Ghost you are
[1:08:43] interested in getting it right you are
[1:08:46] interested in getting in shape in
[1:08:49] getting informed in getting fit to do
[1:08:53] the father's will oh oh do you believe
[1:08:56] that
[1:08:57] tonight oh God's got to have a
[1:09:00] people in the land who have this kind of
[1:09:05] Desire this is the
[1:09:07] generation of them that seek Him of them
[1:09:10] that seek thy face we are the ones that
[1:09:13] God has raised up for such a time as
[1:09:17] this to seek the face of God if there
[1:09:20] ever was a time to seek him now is that
[1:09:23] time tonight because we we are badly out
[1:09:26] of shape we need to be shaped tonight
[1:09:29] but the shaper is here tonight the the
[1:09:32] master builder is here tonight and he
[1:09:35] wants to make a masterpiece out of your
[1:09:38] life and it is only that you yield to
[1:09:41] his master craftsmanship tonight oh
[1:09:44] Hallelujah so shall you be formed so
[1:09:47] shall you be shaped in as much as you
[1:09:49] all be willing to be yielded tonight oh
[1:09:52] Hallelujah isn't that right glory to God
[1:09:57] and the work always reflects the man
[1:09:59] who's doing the work isn't that right if
[1:10:03] the man is a halfway man then he does
[1:10:05] halfway work if the man is a lazy man
[1:10:09] then he does lazy work but if the man is
[1:10:12] a perfect man if he believes in getting
[1:10:14] it right if he believes in measuring up
[1:10:18] if he believes in laying the line to the
[1:10:20] plummet if that's the kind of man you're
[1:10:23] dealing with then that is the kind of
[1:10:25] work that is going to come out of that
[1:10:27] man and if God is the man in whose hands
[1:10:31] you are in tonight then you are going to
[1:10:35] reflect his work his
[1:10:37] craftsmanship his Perfection I'm so glad
[1:10:41] tonight I'm not in the hands of a man
[1:10:45] but I am in the hands of Jesus and in
[1:10:48] his hands you're going to be all right
[1:10:51] when you're in his hands you're going to
[1:10:54] come out okay
[1:10:56] you can say like tonight like job though
[1:10:59] he slay me yet I'll trust him because
[1:11:03] I'm in his hands and if I'm in his hands
[1:11:08] I could never go
[1:11:12] wrong he will never steare you
[1:11:15] wrong he sticks closer than a brother
[1:11:18] tonight he's closer than a closest
[1:11:20] friend tonight oh Hallelujah brother
[1:11:23] brandham said he love his wife so much
[1:11:25] he feel like he could just wrap her into
[1:11:28] him he said God loves us so much more
[1:11:31] than that oh is accelerated so much
[1:11:34] wider so much greater so much
[1:11:38] deeper deeper than the deepest ocean
[1:11:42] tonight is where he put your sins is
[1:11:45] where he put your mistakes oh town in
[1:11:49] the sea of forgetfulness oh it's lost
[1:11:52] down there never to return again
[1:11:55] oh he don't even bring it
[1:11:58] up it's so far gone the Bible says as
[1:12:02] far as East is from the West is how far
[1:12:06] he has removed our transgressions from
[1:12:09] us oh do you believe that tonight oh
[1:12:13] Hallelujah I'm here to talk about Jesus
[1:12:15] I'm here to brag about Jesus oh because
[1:12:18] he is the best thing that can happen in
[1:12:22] your life he is the best thing that ever
[1:12:25] happened in my life oh and I know I
[1:12:28] can't live without him I didn't bring
[1:12:31] myself here he brought me out he brought
[1:12:35] me out of the myy CLA and the one that
[1:12:39] brought me out is the same one that's
[1:12:42] going to take me through every trial
[1:12:46] every test every
[1:12:51] condition oh do you believe it tonight
[1:12:55] amen and amen Oh Glory let me
[1:13:05] just amen amen that's right
[1:13:10] see Oh Glory Hallelujah so there's a lot
[1:13:13] of stuff happening down in the surface
[1:13:15] we talking about the body construct
[1:13:16] right so there's a lot of things
[1:13:18] happening below the surface that gives
[1:13:19] life to the things we see outside isn't
[1:13:22] that
[1:13:23] right and this is kind of what it
[1:13:26] is it's made up of deeper things the
[1:13:30] Bible says the world itself was framed
[1:13:33] by the word of God so that things that
[1:13:35] we see around us were not made by things
[1:13:38] which do appear isn't that right so this
[1:13:42] world that we live in right now all
[1:13:44] these shapes that we see around us there
[1:13:47] was once nothing here but there was a
[1:13:50] God one time that spoke it into
[1:13:53] existence and he said let there be and
[1:13:57] there was so therefore everything we see
[1:14:00] around us all these shapes we see around
[1:14:03] us is just a a a manifestation of the
[1:14:07] mind of God a God that spoke it into
[1:14:10] existence isn't that right isn't that
[1:14:13] right you see so so so that's what it is
[1:14:17] and so we thank God for a prophet who
[1:14:20] William Marian brandham isn't that right
[1:14:22] who sent to us in these last days amen
[1:14:25] to give us evidence that this spiritual
[1:14:28] World actually
[1:14:29] exists isn't that right he was
[1:14:32] influenced by it every day Visions
[1:14:36] Healing The Sick raising the Dead doing
[1:14:39] the works of God those are not Natural
[1:14:42] Things science couldn't explain what
[1:14:44] brother brandham was doing but he was a
[1:14:47] prophet he had the eyes to see what men
[1:14:51] could not normally see and what he saw
[1:14:54] were pictures
[1:14:55] from a place that was just as real as
[1:14:58] this place that we are in right now oh
[1:15:01] and his life and his ministry did
[1:15:04] testify of a supernatural place a
[1:15:07] supernatural World Jesus was the same
[1:15:10] way he said I come from God oh isn't
[1:15:14] that right I come down from God out of
[1:15:16] Heaven I am the bread of life I am the
[1:15:19] door I am the way he said I am the truth
[1:15:24] and I am the life no man can come to the
[1:15:27] father unless he come by me he came to
[1:15:30] give us evidence that there is a reality
[1:15:34] beyond the skies that there is a reality
[1:15:38] beyond the world that you are currently
[1:15:40] living in tonight there is a God
[1:15:43] somewhere that can heal your body that
[1:15:46] can help your condition that can uation
[1:15:49] oh that can heal the mess in your mind
[1:15:53] what you think is mess
[1:15:55] God could bring it back to order what
[1:15:58] you think is corrupted God could raise
[1:16:01] it up and bring it back into a semblance
[1:16:04] of order because he is the god that made
[1:16:07] order in the beginning oh and he knows
[1:16:10] your shape tonight he knows your form uh
[1:16:14] he knows what you're supposed to look
[1:16:16] like uh oh Hallelujah and he's here to
[1:16:19] get you in shape he's here to get you in
[1:16:22] form so that you can be
[1:16:26] as Sons and Daughters of God isn't that
[1:16:30] right amen and amen praise the name of
[1:16:35] the
[1:16:36] Lord isn't that
[1:16:38] right
[1:16:40] hallelujah praise God so that's how the
[1:16:43] natural and spiritual is Right amen and

[1:16:55] no clue that he and that God and the
[1:16:57] devil was having a conversation about
[1:17:00] him outside of his sphere of reality
[1:17:03] there are conversations happening
[1:17:05] tonight about you that you know nothing
[1:17:08] about the Bible says the devil is the

[1:17:37] leave a plaintiff in the Box he also put
[1:17:40] a defendant on the other side and his
[1:17:43] name is Jesus and the defendant is here

[1:19:05] I am sinking and if you are sinking
[1:19:08] tonight you have every right to cry out
[1:19:12] to your car tonight and say Jesus I need
[1:19:17] your help I can't make it without you I
[1:19:20] need your mercy I need your power
[1:19:25] I need your
[1:19:27] grace cry out to him tonight don't be
[1:19:30] afraid to call upon your lord cuz he is
[1:19:35] your savior
[1:19:36] tonight amen and
[1:19:42] amen amen do you believe it tonight so
[1:19:46] hurrying along with this thought
[1:19:48] now and we I'll make a reference to
[1:19:52] Genesis cuz I think it's a powerful
[1:19:54] reference here and if you want you could
[1:19:55] read it along with me it's just Genesis
[1:19:57] 1 the the creation
[1:20:00] story and you know of course you know
[1:20:01] Genesis 1 I'll read it out in the
[1:20:03] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[1:20:05] Earth
[1:20:07] right look in verse two says and the
[1:20:10] Earth was without
[1:20:13] form and it was void and darkness was
[1:20:16] upon the face of the deep isn't that
[1:20:19] right and so here we see identified are
[1:20:22] three problems three issues that need
[1:20:26] solving three things that need
[1:20:29] addressing and it's clearly identified
[1:20:32] here in the scripture isn't that right
[1:20:33] it was without form meaning it was
[1:20:36] without shape like what we are talking
[1:20:38] about tonight it was also void meaning
[1:20:42] it was empty of life and it was dark
[1:20:47] darkness you couldn't see nothing at all
[1:20:50] isn't that
[1:20:51] right and uh so the Bible goes on to say
[1:20:54] say that the spirit of God moved upon
[1:20:58] the face of the waters isn't that right
[1:21:02] any time God is getting ready to do
[1:21:04] something in your life he's getting
[1:21:07] ready to perform a work there's a move
[1:21:10] that takes place there's a rushing in
[1:21:12] the Mulberry Tree there's a there's a
[1:21:16] whirlwind there's a there's an action
[1:21:19] there's an
[1:21:20] incitement amen isn't that right there's
[1:21:22] a stirring when God begins to stir it
[1:21:26] means he already has a plan in his mind
[1:21:29] about something he's going to do but
[1:21:32] because we are living in the present
[1:21:34] instance what we first begin to see is a
[1:21:37] move of God and I believe tonight we are
[1:21:40] living in a time when we are about to
[1:21:42] see a move of God because God already
[1:21:46] has a plan in his mind about what he's
[1:21:49] going to create about what he's going to
[1:21:52] do about the work he is going to perform
[1:21:55] he wants to make back this pyramid he
[1:21:58] wants to rebuild the church again and he
[1:22:01] has to do it under the power of the
[1:22:04] spirit and when God has to do something
[1:22:07] he begins to move oh Hallelujah Hal and
[1:22:10] tonight oh we are here to move as he
[1:22:14] moves oh Hallelujah isn't that right
[1:22:17] when the children of Israel were going
[1:22:19] through the Wilderness and they were
[1:22:20] setting up camp it is because they were
[1:22:23] moving with the the pillar of fire isn't
[1:22:26] that right and wherever the pillar of
[1:22:28] fire went they had to go right along
[1:22:30] with it if the pillar of fire stopped
[1:22:33] they stopped and made camp and the Bible
[1:22:35] said it was a pillar of fire all night
[1:22:37] long and it gave light to them that were
[1:22:40] camping so that they weren't alone so
[1:22:43] that they weren't afraid what a comfort
[1:22:46] the pillar of fire is in the day he's a
[1:22:49] cloud and at night he's a pillar of fire
[1:22:52] to keep off the Scorpion and snakes to
[1:22:55] keep you in the light so that you never
[1:22:58] walk in darkness Oh How He loves you and
[1:23:02] me tonight we are not walking in
[1:23:04] darkness but we are walking in the light
[1:23:07] of his glory and where his light is
[1:23:10] there is healing in that light there is
[1:23:12] Deliverance in that light there is
[1:23:14] Restoration in that light every fi of
[1:23:17] your body can be affected uh by the
[1:23:20] healing power of the pillar of fire
[1:23:23] tonight oh somebody give him praise if
[1:23:27] only you can get in the spirit get in
[1:23:29] the atmosphere of Faith where the
[1:23:32] Miracles take place you will feel the
[1:23:35] effects oh the warm sensation of that
[1:23:39] Pillar of Fire Light coming upon your
[1:23:41] soul coming upon your body coming upon
[1:23:44] your spirit oh he wants to live inside
[1:23:48] of you tonight oh can't you feel those
[1:23:50] Warm Rays of the S so n of God oh until
[1:23:54] the day Dawn and the day star arise in
[1:23:58] your hearts who is he he is Jesus the
[1:24:03] son of the Living God he's here to come
[1:24:05] inside of you he's here to born in you
[1:24:08] again H by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:12] uh and fire and give you a real
[1:24:16] transformation and begin your
[1:24:19] shaping and forming process to bring you
[1:24:23] into the
[1:24:25] image of the stature of the fullness of
[1:24:29] Christ isn't that right to the stature
[1:24:31] of a perfect man amen that's what he's
[1:24:34] here to do tonight do you believe it
[1:24:38] amen so the pillari moving move with it
[1:24:42] that's right am amen if you don't move
[1:24:44] with it you'll get in
[1:24:46] trouble because you don't know the
[1:24:49] way he didn't take the the the the road
[1:24:53] that everyone knew
[1:24:55] God actually purposefully took the road
[1:24:58] L
[1:24:58] travel when he led the children of
[1:25:00] Israel amen by the way of the
[1:25:03] Wilderness and the purpose of that was
[1:25:05] to try them to get them in shape to get
[1:25:11] them to
[1:25:12] change to get Egypt out of them amen
[1:25:16] because they had come out of Egypt yes
[1:25:18] but they were still holding on to Egypt
[1:25:20] on the
[1:25:21] inside so God wants people tonight who
[1:25:24] can be affected by his school of
[1:25:27] character
[1:25:28] training where he can take you through
[1:25:31] stuff isn't that right take you through
[1:25:33] trials take you through Wilderness take
[1:25:36] you through sorrow Oh Hallelujah but all
[1:25:39] is to form you and to shape you into
[1:25:43] what he wants for you oh just like butov
[1:25:46] is saying on Sunday isn't that right no
[1:25:48] one likes discipline doesn't matter how
[1:25:51] it comes across whether it's soft or
[1:25:54] hard whether it's rough or smooth
[1:25:57] whether it's high or low whether it's in
[1:26:00] or out no one likes disciplining but
[1:26:04] disciplining yields the fruits of
[1:26:06] righteousness it yields the fruits of
[1:26:08] Peace it yields the fruits of humility
[1:26:11] and all these things that we long to see
[1:26:15] if only tonight we could yield to God's
[1:26:17] shaping and to God's
[1:26:20] Conformity because that's what he wants
[1:26:22] for us tonight is that
[1:26:25] right amen so you have to move with the
[1:26:28] pillar of fire isn't that right
[1:26:30] otherwise you will get lost and it is
[1:26:32] 100% possible to get
[1:26:36] lost we can actually get
[1:26:41] lost it is possible for us to actually
[1:26:44] go off track you know we preach the
[1:26:47] gospel as a positive thing God loves us
[1:26:51] and he cares about us and that he wants
[1:26:53] good for us and and that we're going to
[1:26:55] be perfect we're going to be filled with
[1:26:57] the Holy Ghost we're going to be this
[1:26:59] and that's how the gospel is preached
[1:27:01] isn't that right and there's nothing
[1:27:02] wrong with that but what we have to get
[1:27:05] in our minds is that if we don't do the
[1:27:08] things he says do we can actually go off
[1:27:13] track and God actually sometime allow us
[1:27:17] to go Plum off the beaten path and go
[1:27:20] kening down into the precipice
[1:27:24] and off into the Ravine somewhere in an
[1:27:27] unmarked map
[1:27:29] location and let you keep going until
[1:27:32] you realize that you are
[1:27:34] lost and that you really need his
[1:27:38] help until you come to that
[1:27:41] realization you will keep heading in the
[1:27:43] wrong direction and the more decisions
[1:27:45] you make is the more you will continue
[1:27:48] to spin out of control it happened to
[1:27:51] the prophet one time he needed a guy
[1:27:54] youall know what I'm talking about
[1:27:56] tonight he told his story about how he
[1:27:58] was a ranger and how he's supposed to
[1:28:00] know the woods like the back of his
[1:28:03] hands but all of a sudden he found
[1:28:05] himself making circles he found himself
[1:28:09] doing something called the death the
[1:28:11] death walk isn't that right going around
[1:28:15] and coming back to the same spot what a
[1:28:18] reflection of Our Lives sometimes we say
[1:28:21] we've made progress sometimes we think
[1:28:23] we've done so much only to come back
[1:28:27] around at the same spot and then we tell
[1:28:30] ourselves it's not so bad maybe I'll
[1:28:32] just keep walking surely I know where
[1:28:35] I'm going and then we come right around
[1:28:38] to the same spot we try to turn over a
[1:28:41] new Leaf we try to get a New Year's
[1:28:43] resolution we try to write it down on a
[1:28:46] book but we come back to the same spot
[1:28:50] when are you going to recognize tonight
[1:28:52] that you need a guide when are you going
[1:28:54] to recognize tonight that you don't know
[1:28:57] of him we need him more than we realize
[1:29:01] when I take a airplane ride and you you
[1:29:03] go up into the clouds and you look down
[1:29:06] at the ocean the mighty ocean below you
[1:29:09] you think for a second if this plane
[1:29:12] engine was to fail the ocean would be my
[1:29:16] destiny you tend to think how small you
[1:29:19] are at one time I was looking up from a
[1:29:22] from a from an airplane and I saw ship
[1:29:25] uh boat or something was on Water I
[1:29:27] could see it from there it looked like
[1:29:28] an ant of course cuz I was so high up
[1:29:31] and above that ship was a cloud and it
[1:29:34] was raining and I could see the rain
[1:29:37] falling like a stream like that you
[1:29:38] could see it swaying in the wind over
