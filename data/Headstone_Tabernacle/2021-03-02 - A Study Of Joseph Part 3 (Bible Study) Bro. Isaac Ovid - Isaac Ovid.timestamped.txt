[11:56] lord come around your wood
[11:59] lord it is your word that unites us it
[12:02] is your word that
[12:04] keeps us it is your word that guides us
[12:07] it's
[12:08] lord your word is the source lord for
[12:12] understanding your mind lord and father
[12:15] we are so grateful lord that
[12:17] we have the written word and lord we are
[12:19] even more grateful to have access to the
[12:22] revealed word that
[12:24] lord that put light on this word lord
[12:26] that we could
[12:27] read it and we could have a bible study
[12:29] and we could lord know
[12:31] the hidden things lord that you have
[12:33] been unfolding
[12:34] lord from the beginning of time lord to
[12:38] this present day
[12:39] lord and even until the consummation
[12:41] lord even until the ending of all things
[12:44] to
[12:44] know where we come from to understand
[12:47] our history
[12:48] to understand our destiny to understand
[12:52] where we come from to understand where
[12:54] we're going and to understand how
[12:56] everything fits together the pieces of
[12:59] the puzzle of our lives lord that
[13:02] lord you allowed it in so many ways lord
[13:06] lord like the potter lord and working
[13:08] with the clay
[13:09] lord to bring the image lord interview
[13:13] that you have in mind lord you sometimes
[13:15] have to
[13:16] break that vessel and put it back on the
[13:18] potter's wheel for the
[13:20] lore to shape and mold it into the image
[13:23] that you
[13:24] have in store and you have planned and
[13:26] lord you have envisioned lord and
[13:28] lord sometimes through these situations
[13:31] in our lives
[13:32] lord it is past our understanding lord
[13:35] at a point in time
[13:37] that we're going through something lord
[13:40] most times if not almost all times
[13:43] lord it doesn't make much sense lord and
[13:46] we struggle
[13:46] through the experiences with our fate
[13:48] and a confidence that there's a bigger
[13:50] plan
[13:51] than what we could understand so we
[13:53] thank you lord
[13:54] the lord because we have seen a true
[13:55] scripture in so many ways
[13:57] of that bigger plan that greater purpose
[14:00] lord the things that
[14:02] lord you don't allow us to see the
[14:04] things that you
[14:05] prevent us from seeing lord because lord
[14:08] sometimes it could do even more damage
[14:12] but lord in your great plan lord you
[14:14] bring us to a spot farther away
[14:16] lord we can look back and see it's been
[14:18] you all along guiding direct and leading
[14:20] us so we thank you for this message of
[14:22] this our
[14:23] lord and sometimes the situations of
[14:25] life could
[14:26] lord work in harmony as it were
[14:29] or to to distract to try to weaken but
[14:32] father we come tonight
[14:34] lord for our faith to be restored and
[14:37] for our strength and
[14:38] lord to get an encouragement to get a
[14:40] word even if it's just
[14:42] one word tonight even if it's just one
[14:44] word
[14:45] from you lord it's enough that we hear
[14:46] your voice and to know your thoughts on
[14:48] different matters lord so
[14:50] father as we are in this first session
[14:52] of this month of
[14:53] march lord it's something else to see
[14:56] how rapidly time is moving
[14:58] to think it's about a year that the
[15:00] world has already been dealing with this
[15:02] thing
[15:02] this pandemic as it were and lord no one
[15:05] could have envisioned
[15:06] how it would have unfolded but lord to
[15:09] see where we are at
[15:10] now and to see lord everything that's
[15:13] taking place lord we thank you for
[15:14] keeping us we thank you for
[15:15] strengthening us we thank you for
[15:17] lord reviving us we thank you for lord
[15:20] giving us the charge when we need to
[15:22] charge so
[15:23] lord may you bless each one tonight that
[15:26] lord made that sacrifice make the effort
[15:28] that commitment lord to be in this room
[15:32] report for duty as it were there are so
[15:34] many things that we could find ourselves
[15:37] doing
[15:38] there are so many ideas we can have
[15:40] about our time and
[15:41] how to spend it and how to use it and
[15:43] what is important or not
[15:45] important but lord uh give you
[15:49] lord the preeminence in our lives to put
[15:52] you first
[15:53] lord and to trust lord trust you that
[15:56] lord knowing that you are god that keeps
[15:57] your word lord you said if we put you
[16:00] first he said seek you first the kingdom
[16:02] of god lord and we want to put you first
[16:05] in our affairs put you first in our
[16:06] lives put you first
[16:08] in our marriages put you first in our
[16:10] businesses put you first
[16:11] in our careers lord and in everything
[16:13] that we do and even in this first week
[16:15] of this month where we have
[16:16] lord of prayer and fastest coming friday
[16:19] lord we want this week to be a week of
[16:21] reflection
[16:22] a week of introspection a week where we
[16:25] pause to look at the word to look at our
[16:27] lives and to do our own
[16:29] analysis as it were law to do our own
[16:32] evaluation the script
[16:34] of evaluation has been made clear lord
[16:37] god that you said that if we love you we
[16:39] would keep your commandments so we don't
[16:40] want to be
[16:41] guilty tonight lord of not keeping your
[16:44] commandments lord even the least of them
[16:46] we want to keep them father because
[16:48] it's important it's important that we
[16:51] keep your commandments that we keep your
[16:52] word that we guard it in our hearts
[16:55] lord we protect it with all that we have
[16:57] despite the pressures despite the
[16:59] stresses despite
[17:00] the situations that we may want to fly
[17:02] off the handle and lose control as it
[17:04] were
[17:05] lord we want to be very careful now no
[17:07] more than ever
[17:09] lord when we see the closing pages as it
[17:11] were
[17:12] of time as we blend into eternity have
[17:14] your preeminence tonight if there's
[17:16] someone
[17:16] that's backslidden tonight lord may they
[17:18] be shaken back into reality may this be
[17:21] lord of study tonight of repentance oh
[17:24] lord
[17:25] father may you take it in a certain kind
[17:27] of a way lord that
[17:28] lives could be restored this journey
[17:31] that we're on
[17:32] of this great restoration of fallen man
[17:35] lord
[17:36] back to his condition father lord the
[17:39] condition he was lord the adamic
[17:40] condition before the fall
[17:42] lord it's a it's a ministry of
[17:44] reconciliation a ministry
[17:46] of restoration a mystery of putting
[17:48] pieces back together lord you don't
[17:50] like broken families you don't like
[17:52] broken situations you don't like broken
[17:54] things
[17:54] lord when things are broken it's in your
[17:56] nature to see the pieces come back
[17:58] together so
[17:59] father may you bring the pieces together
[18:02] of our lives
[18:03] lord the pieces lord of our relationship
[18:06] with you
[18:07] lord that we have fallen aside lord we
[18:09] want to come back home
[18:10] come back to lord across come back to
[18:13] basics
[18:14] come back to first principles lord lord
[18:17] sometimes you get so caught up in
[18:19] lord the understanding and the knowledge
[18:21] and the revelation at times that we
[18:23] miss the first principles lord and lord
[18:26] the bible will say
[18:26] the first love that that first contact
[18:29] that first experience with you
[18:31] lord bring us back to basics father lord
[18:33] because it's the foundation that would
[18:35] last lord and
[18:36] may we rebuild upon that solid
[18:38] foundation lord
[18:39] build it the right way so we commit the
[18:41] teaching tonight into your hands
[18:42] we commend the fellowship into your
[18:44] hands may you bless your people
[18:45] lord if there's anyone sick may they be
[18:47] healed anyone wanting to hear direct
[18:49] from you speak to them take me out of
[18:51] the way
[18:51] lord use me as your microphone that you
[18:54] could speak lip to ear to your sons
[18:56] and your daughters lord even the little
[18:58] ones who may be connected
[18:59] lord and lord in their homes in their
[19:01] ways lord may this be
[19:02] lord of spiritual time in our homes and
[19:04] in our families we commit the meeting
[19:06] into your hands in the precious theme of
[19:08] jesus christ
[19:09] amen and amen and amen certainly a great
[19:12] privilege to be here tonight
[19:14] uh one more time uh in the presence of
[19:16] god and
[19:18] in the fellowship of the brethren around
[19:20] his word
[19:21] uh in these bible studies that have
[19:23] served
[19:24] to be somewhat of a a supplement
[19:27] or a vitamin as it were an encouragement
[19:31] um during the week uh you know so that
[19:35] we can keep pressing
[19:36] you know during the week and break this
[19:38] this sometimes this
[19:40] this this this formality of of of just
[19:43] sunday service and and wednesday service
[19:45] and these things so that
[19:46] we could have more contacts and we are
[19:49] also fulfilling scripture that
[19:51] even as the approaches we meeting more
[19:53] frequently we may not be doing it
[19:55] physically but we are still
[19:56] meeting using the the technology and and
[19:59] using the the system that we have and
[20:02] and these things so so we thank god for
[20:05] his love we thank god for his mercy we
[20:07] thank god for providing for us
[20:09] uh for keeping us for protecting us or
[20:13] watching over us uh he is very
[20:15] interested
[20:16] in everything about us that's his nature
[20:19] and uh
[20:20] sometimes even when we don't understand
[20:22] it
[20:23] um it's not for us to always understand
[20:26] at that particular point in time but
[20:28] things are made clear
[20:29] to us you know as time unfolds so we
[20:32] trust
[20:33] uh that you are doing well and that you
[20:36] are fighting the fight
[20:38] i was fellowshipping with a couple
[20:39] brothers after service on sunday
[20:42] and i asked a few brothers is is is the
[20:45] fire hot and heavy
[20:46] you know is he trials hot and heavy
[20:48] because every trial is not hot and heavy
[20:50] you need to talk to me because
[20:52] you know the trials not hot and heavy
[20:54] then something wrong
[20:55] you know so if these trials are hot and
[20:59] heavy
[20:59] that is a good thing you know so it
[21:01] means that the devil don't have you
[21:04] you know he's trying to get you he's
[21:05] trying to to mash up you know so
[21:07] once you feel the heat and the intensity
[21:10] of the trials then you know the devil
[21:11] you're never trying all that he can but
[21:13] you know what is so wonderful about the
[21:15] god we
[21:16] serve he put a seed in us that cannot
[21:18] give up that that cannot
[21:19] that cannot backslide that creator is he
[21:21] that's in you
[21:23] and he that's in the world and there's a
[21:25] joy in you that sometimes you don't even
[21:27] realize in you
[21:28] you know uh there's a piece in you that
[21:30] that somehow you don't realize
[21:32] in you it's locked up in the seed in
[21:34] that seed in the
[21:36] the genetic code you know of that germ
[21:38] of life in you has everything to
[21:40] reproduce itself
[21:42] you know that's a that is a first
[21:43] principle you know that's a genesis type
[21:46] principle
[21:47] you know every sea will bring forth it's
[21:49] kind and
[21:50] we thank god that it was not our ability
[21:53] or our strength
[21:54] or our merit or our efforts that put
[21:56] that seed in us but is a seed of
[21:58] perfection
[21:59] it's a seed of predestination and but a
[22:02] random typed predestination
[22:04] to an engagement ring a promissory ring
[22:07] you know so he put that seed in there
[22:09] and put in that sea the ability
[22:12] for that seat to take care of itself
[22:13] hallelujah in that sea that seed
[22:16] that sea don't need your help to take
[22:17] care of itself that seed is strong
[22:19] enough
[22:19] to withstand all kind of stuff uh all
[22:21] kind of stuff and sometime in the most
[22:23] messed up of conditions the same way you
[22:25] want to use manure
[22:26] and use a certain environment for these
[22:28] seeds sometimes the more messed up
[22:30] things get
[22:30] that seed actually begin to start to to
[22:33] thrive and
[22:34] no wonder the bible could say his
[22:36] strength is made perfect in our weakness
[22:39] his strength is made perfect when when
[22:41] our strength
[22:42] is not is gone and we have no strength
[22:44] to carry on
[22:45] that's when he relishes the opportunity
[22:48] to show himself
[22:50] and to make himself known to us you know
[22:53] after
[22:54] we have gone through the test you know
[22:56] so we are in a testing time friends
[22:58] we are being tested every day it's not
[23:01] like oh levels and and cxc and
[23:03] uncommon engines where you have a one
[23:04] day you know a few days of exams
[23:07] and and then you're waiting for the
[23:08] results this is a daily test
[23:11] and their daily results because you know
[23:14] at the end of the day how you did
[23:15] you know nobody had to come and mark
[23:17] your papers you know if you lost control
[23:19] you know
[23:20] if you know what you do you you can mark
[23:22] your own papers you know
[23:24] because the word is there your tutor is
[23:26] in force in action
[23:28] you know if you give up you know if you
[23:29] have joy you know if you pray this
[23:31] morning you know
[23:31] if you really would i don't have to come
[23:33] to your house and if you really would or
[23:35] if you pray
[23:36] but it's a test every day to see if you
[23:38] would put
[23:39] god first if you would acknowledge him
[23:42] in all your ways so that he could direct
[23:45] your paths you know and it's it's like i
[23:48] i'm back to basics calling
[23:50] him first principles the first principle
[23:53] of something is a is a foundational
[23:55] teaching a foundational concept
[23:57] that when all else is is moving around
[24:00] he can hold on to this first principle
[24:02] and know that that anchor holes you know
[24:05] and and if it's anything you hold on to
[24:06] tonight
[24:07] is that seed word has the power to take
[24:10] care of itself
[24:12] you know under any circumstance on any
[24:14] situation that seed
[24:16] will take care of itself so tonight by
[24:18] the grace of god
[24:19] i don't uh have a plan to be too long
[24:23] with you tonight i'm
[24:24] trusting god that we could bring this uh
[24:27] little
[24:28] thing that we have been on for the last
[24:30] two weeks
[24:31] to uh i would say somewhat off for close
[24:35] um by the grace of god i i
[24:38] i thank god that i've been able to to to
[24:40] you know
[24:41] make it to this point with this
[24:43] sometimes i've had experiences in the
[24:45] past where i had a part one
[24:46] and part two still coming but um
[24:50] we we are here tonight on a study of
[24:52] joseph part three
[24:53] uh the conclusion of this study and i
[24:56] trust it's been a blessing to you
[24:58] and i trust that in some way you would
[25:00] have seen over the last two weeks
[25:02] something you may not have seen before
[25:04] and if you did see it uh uh that it's a
[25:08] reminder to you
[25:09] you know of of so many issues of life
[25:12] because this story that we have been on
[25:14] is a story of love it's a story of
[25:17] restoration
[25:18] and india has betrayal india has
[25:21] hardship
[25:22] in there has struggles in there
[25:25] has has coming to to no oneself
[25:28] in there has the the whole experience of
[25:31] knowing who is for you and who's
[25:33] who's not for you uh india is the
[25:35] attitude and
[25:36] the resilience of survival in the in the
[25:38] face of hardship
[25:40] india is adapting to change and
[25:42] circumstances and situations and not
[25:44] curling up in the fetal position and
[25:46] saying god will love me anymore
[25:48] you know we would have gone through this
[25:50] whole journey
[25:51] from a young joseph as it were 17 years
[25:54] old
[25:55] you know and i want you to think back to
[25:56] when you were 17 years old you know
[25:58] what kind of person were you when you
[26:00] were 17 years old for some of us
[26:01] even five years ago we have made a major
[26:03] improvement
[26:04] you know but going back to when we were
[26:06] 17 years old
[26:07] and to see how we were and how we acted
[26:10] and how we live and to see this young
[26:12] boy not just confronted with a rough
[26:14] situation but in a different land a
[26:15] different language a different
[26:17] situation a different culture to see how
[26:19] he was able to thrive
[26:21] in the midst of that because of god we
[26:23] we went through that and it was very
[26:25] clear
[26:25] in scripture that god's hand was upon
[26:28] him and if you
[26:29] for a minute don't realize that god's
[26:32] hand is upon you you need to
[26:33] look back at the pages of your life one
[26:35] more time and go back to
[26:36] your genesis go back to your first few
[26:39] pages
[26:40] and to see in the midst of all that
[26:41] you've been through
[26:43] has been god keeping you god protecting
[26:45] you god's hand
[26:46] is upon you and if we are to take one
[26:49] lesson
[26:50] um from this it's to acknowledge god
[26:52] more for what he has done he loves
[26:54] to be acknowledged he loves to get the
[26:56] credit he doesn't like to share credit
[26:58] with anybody
[26:59] so it's not your ability it's not your
[27:01] strength it's not your knowledge
[27:02] it's not your insight it's not your hard
[27:04] work you know that is foundational for
[27:06] his principles
[27:07] you know it's not your effort sometimes
[27:09] he says me and you're pushing and you're
[27:10] doing and you're doing and you're doing
[27:12] and realizing that you can't do if god
[27:14] not with you you can't act if god not
[27:16] with you you can't live
[27:17] if god is not with you you know so i
[27:19] want to really encourage you
[27:21] to keep on pressing and to keep your
[27:22] feet high and don't let any situation
[27:25] because trust me it will come but don't
[27:27] let any situation uh throw you off so
[27:31] we would have reached that point where
[27:33] uh
[27:34] you know the the the joseph's brothers
[27:37] as it were
[27:38] would have come down uh into egypt and
[27:42] they didn't recognize joseph they didn't
[27:44] know who joseph was and joseph when he
[27:45] realized
[27:46] who they were he really began call it a
[27:49] series of testing
[27:50] you know um many times we don't you know
[27:54] express it in that kind of way but
[27:55] really what joseph was doing
[27:57] was testing them you know testing them
[28:00] to see
[28:01] if they had changed there is nothing to
[28:04] suggest that joseph's heart
[28:05] had any animosity there was nothing to
[28:07] suggest that in his heart was
[28:09] anger or enmity or a desire for revenge
[28:14] you know there was there was no evidence
[28:16] of him trying to hurt them to meme them
[28:18] uh looking at the holy scripture
[28:20] unfolded
[28:21] what we saw was not someone who
[28:25] was locked up with pent up rage and
[28:27] anger but we saw that there was a hoot
[28:30] there was a cry we we found two
[28:32] instances where he broke down
[28:34] and he did so in secret he did so
[28:36] quietly he did so away from the crowd
[28:40] uh so as not to to show how he felt
[28:43] about
[28:44] the to see that that there are issues in
[28:47] our lives that
[28:48] has a sensitive touch to it and we try
[28:51] to manage it as best we can
[28:53] but test nonetheless the test was there
[28:56] you know
[28:57] to test to see if these same brothers
[28:59] who
[29:00] had hurt him had changed you know and
[29:02] anytime we
[29:03] speak about change what we're really
[29:05] talking about is repentance
[29:08] we need to understand that the word chin
[29:10] in scriptural context
[29:12] and in this context is really repentance
[29:14] because
[29:15] to really repent or to repent is about
[29:18] not just a
[29:18] change of thinking it's a change of
[29:21] behavior
[29:22] it needs to translate all the way to a
[29:24] change of behavior
[29:26] you know a lot of people they come to
[29:28] the message or they come to christ when
[29:30] they come to the lord
[29:31] and they use that word repent you know
[29:33] repent and be baptized and
[29:36] and and and they usually will repent and
[29:38] by the
[29:39] let us repentance about a change in your
[29:42] behavior
[29:42] not changing your passion not changing
[29:44] your words
[29:45] because sometimes some of us we speak
[29:48] differently
[29:49] and our lives don't line up with how we
[29:51] speak we may have changed our vocabulary
[29:53] by
[29:54] virtue of the experiences that we have
[29:56] gotten
[29:57] and all this stuff but our lives didn't
[29:59] didn't line up with that so
[30:01] here we see joseph and he is listening
[30:04] to his brothers
[30:05] he's asking about their their family
[30:08] he's coming across a certain way
[30:10] because he's probing he's he's probing
[30:12] and and we see the same way jesus would
[30:14] probe
[30:15] you know the woman at the well go call
[30:17] your husband because he's probing so
[30:19] joseph is
[30:19] is probing but he's really want to bring
[30:22] it to that spot of a test
[30:23] and we know that when they came the
[30:26] first time he
[30:27] held simeon and he said listen go and
[30:29] bring
[30:30] your youngest brother and then i will i
[30:32] will release
[30:33] you know this one that i'm keeping here
[30:35] um and so forth and
[30:37] and and jacob said not me i'm not i'm
[30:39] not doing it i'm not sending not
[30:41] benjamin
[30:42] you know why earlier um go on and tell
[30:45] him you're the next brother
[30:46] or they want to kind of keep it just
[30:48] talk talk talk a little kind of keep
[30:49] pulling them out shuttle they just go in
[30:50] there and talk and embarrassing people
[30:52] and and he had this whole this whole
[30:53] situation that we read last week
[30:56] before they didn't stay quiet we'd like
[30:57] to go to this stress hold on we gotta
[30:58] have food and
[30:59] and the whole debate and then we reach
[31:01] that point where judah say
[31:03] you know i will take responsibility for
[31:04] it and we will go and
[31:06] and and and they are concerned we we
[31:09] read last week
[31:10] with the money that they were supposed
[31:11] to pay for the items
[31:13] that it was a stressful time for them
[31:15] but but that is
[31:16] a test is uncomfortable a
[31:20] testing that has pleasant things and and
[31:22] sometimes it's it's so much
[31:23] you're dealing with here it is they're
[31:25] going back to egypt the pressure of
[31:27] their father
[31:28] and knowing how sensitive he was to
[31:30] benjamin going the pressure of knowing
[31:33] if they would be received
[31:34] the pressure of knowing that they the
[31:36] money that they carry to pay
[31:38] was in their possession still and
[31:39] they're trying to carry it back
[31:41] and carry double the money we read that
[31:43] last week they carry double the money
[31:44] plus they carry gifts
[31:45] and and all this stuff is going on and
[31:47] they're dealing with multiple
[31:49] issues
[31:52] it is it is interesting that life at
[31:54] times
[31:55] doesn't allow us to to deal with
[31:57] situations the way we want to deal with
[31:59] it
[32:00] it'll be easy if we have one issue to
[32:02] deal with at the time
[32:04] i wish our issues can line up and order
[32:06] a priority and we can deal with them one
[32:07] at a time
[32:08] but that's not how it is that is the
[32:11] reality of it
[32:12] many times our issues come at us
[32:15] sometimes all at the same time
[32:16] so you have a situation with with with
[32:19] job while
[32:20] job reading the email really bad news
[32:22] our next email hit him here finish
[32:23] process the first email by the time he
[32:25] really second email i turn the email
[32:28] is the children is the cattle is eating
[32:31] all at once
[32:33] and it is about a certain level of
[32:34] resilience of character that has been
[32:36] developed in us
[32:38] we can sit and talk about it for hours
[32:40] and hours and hours
[32:41] how when he didn't wanting and when he
[32:43] thought that was it it's like
[32:45] it's almost the extra that really coming
[32:47] back when he's ready mixing up him
[32:48] but you know what you're back still
[32:50] there you know
[32:52] your bucket break you thought it was
[32:55] destroyed you taught you couldn't take
[32:56] any more
[32:57] but the reality is you could withstand
[32:59] the pressures
[33:00] of the situation so here it was
[33:03] the bo the brothers go back to egypt and
[33:06] they get to the house and we read this
[33:08] last weekend and they talked to this
[33:09] church and they explained to him
[33:11] we bring back the money and all this
[33:12] stuff and then they go there and
[33:14] and and they get invited to joseph house
[33:16] and they're trying to figure out
[33:18] what really going on here this thing
[33:19] this matter i'd not be accused nothing's
[33:21] being spied you know
[33:22] he feeding us and then we see the
[33:23] unfolding of it how
[33:25] by some mysterious mystery here it is
[33:28] they're sitting down in order of age
[33:30] from oldest to youngest
[33:32] you know and and they just marvel and
[33:34] they can't understand what is happening
[33:36] because they don't know who joseph is
[33:39] and they see the food laid out and and
[33:42] we would have ended
[33:43] last week down to the part where uh uh
[33:46] we went in chapter of 43 at the last two
[33:48] places and they sat before him
[33:50] the first born according to his
[33:51] birthright in a chronological age and
[33:54] the youngest according to his youth
[33:55] and the men marveled one at another in
[33:58] other words how do you know that boy
[33:59] how they know who first and second now i
[34:01] can understand
[34:02] if they put the oldest one on one end
[34:05] and youngest one alone
[34:06] but but but when you really amplify it
[34:08] is in chronological order so every
[34:10] single one in perfect order so they had
[34:12] to marvel
[34:13] and he took and sent messages onto them
[34:15] or food
[34:16] before him but benjamin's mess was five
[34:18] times so much as any of this
[34:20] the fact that the bible mentions it is
[34:22] significant in one of itself but i
[34:24] wonder
[34:24] how the other brothers felt when they're
[34:26] wondering how come benjamin has so much
[34:28] food boy
[34:30] human nature has this ability to compare
[34:33] with one with one another
[34:35] but here it is benjamin has five times
[34:37] the amount of food
[34:38] all right and that is where we ended
[34:40] last week so
[34:42] we are in genesis 44 to bring this a
[34:44] study of joseph part three to bring us a
[34:46] close uh trust will be a blessing
[34:48] unto you so this would have been after
[34:51] they would have eaten
[34:52] uh you know and and and they're getting
[34:55] ready to go
[34:56] uh genesis 44 from verse one
[34:59] and he commanded the steward of his
[35:01] house saying fill the men's sacks with
[35:03] food
[35:04] as much as they can carry
[35:07] and put every man's money in his sacks
[35:10] amount so one more time
[35:11] he he he's saying i'm putting back the
[35:14] money their money is not good
[35:16] with me and put
[35:19] my cup the silver cup
[35:23] uh in the sax mouth of the youngest
[35:28] and his call on money and he did
[35:30] according to the word
[35:31] that joseph had spoken and as soon as
[35:34] the morning was light the men were sent
[35:36] away
[35:36] there and their asses and when they were
[35:39] gone out of the city
[35:41] and not yet far off
[35:44] joseph said unto stuart up
[35:47] follow after the men and when thou dost
[35:50] overtake them
[35:51] say unto them wherefore have ye rewarded
[35:54] evil for good
[35:59] so i want us to picture the relief
[36:03] with which these brothers would have
[36:06] left
[36:07] egypt feeling accomplished
[36:10] feeling that they were finally out of
[36:12] the clear
[36:14] they left there without any accusation
[36:17] bear in mind the first time
[36:18] they left they would have left with a
[36:19] certain level of of anxiety as it were
[36:23] because they are left there being
[36:24] accused of being spies they would have
[36:26] left there with one of their brothers
[36:27] behind
[36:28] so the way they are leaving now is
[36:30] different how they left the first time
[36:32] they are leaving saying okay finally we
[36:34] are able to move on unable carry food
[36:36] back
[36:37] and here it is now another test has been
[36:40] set up for them that they don't
[36:41] understand
[36:44] and
[36:47] verse five
[36:52] wherefore you really forget that verse
[36:54] four and in verse five it's a
[36:55] continuation it
[36:56] is not this it in which my lord drink it
[37:01] and whereby did he divine it and he have
[37:04] done evil and so doing just speaking
[37:06] about that
[37:06] that um that that cup that he plays
[37:08] there
[37:09] six and he overtook them and he's these
[37:14] same words you know just a quick point
[37:17] about this
[37:17] it's important to have people around you
[37:20] who can communicate
[37:39] oh praise the lord keep praising them
[37:41] since blessed be the name of the lord
[37:43] hallelujah hallelujah praise god as far
[37:46] as the land has dropped
[37:47] but keep blessing his name father we
[37:49] bless you father we praise you we thank
[37:51] you for your word
[37:52] we thank you for your truth
[38:15] you back up by exactly seeing you
[38:26] i'm not hearing you
[38:30] can you hear me now yes yes
[38:37] we were at verse six and he overtook
[38:40] them and spake unto them these same
[38:42] words
[38:44] and they said unto him wherefore saith
[38:46] my lord these words
[38:49] this is very seven god forbid that thy
[38:51] servant should do
[38:52] according to this thing so
[38:56] these brothers are shocked at the
[38:58] accusation they can't understand where
[39:00] it's coming from they
[39:01] they have no idea what the man is
[39:04] accusing them of
[39:06] you know and uh so they are obviously
[39:09] defensive
[39:10] god forbid that i say once you do
[39:11] according to this thing this is not our
[39:13] way this is not our behavior there is
[39:14] nothing
[39:15] so verse 8 behold the money which we
[39:17] found in our sacks months we brought her
[39:19] again onto the
[39:20] outer hand of canaan so they are
[39:22] pleading their own case and defending
[39:24] themselves saying
[39:25] history will show the evidence would
[39:27] show that the first time we left and the
[39:29] money was that we brought it back so we
[39:30] obviously did not try to take anything
[39:32] at all
[39:33] how then should we steal out of thy
[39:36] lord's house silver or gold
[39:40] with whomsoever of thy servants it be
[39:42] found
[39:43] would let him die and we also will be
[39:46] my lord's bondman
[39:50] and he said now also let it be according
[39:52] unto your words
[39:53] he with whom it is found shall be my
[39:56] servant and ye shall be
[39:58] blameless no
[40:02] no
[40:06] it's it's it is it is a level of
[40:11] being convinced that you're right that
[40:13] this conversation would unfold this way
[40:15] that they would have the confidence to
[40:16] see okay if it is found let that person
[40:18] take the blame
[40:19] verse 11 then they speedily took down
[40:23] every man he sat to the ground and
[40:24] opened every man his sack and he
[40:27] searched and began at the eldest
[40:31] and left at the youngest so he go in an
[40:35] order again
[40:36] olessa youngest and the cop was found in
[40:38] benjamin's stock
[40:41] and they ran their clothes
[40:45] and laid every man his ass and returned
[40:48] to the city
[40:49] so in other words they tore their
[40:50] clothes and they load back
[40:53] up onto the donkeys all the items
[40:56] and they start to turn back to the city
[41:01] and judah and his brethren came to
[41:03] joseph's
[41:05] for he was yet there and they fell
[41:08] before him
[41:09] on the ground
[41:12] and joseph said unto them what deer is
[41:14] this that he have done
[41:16] what he not that such a man as i can
[41:18] certainly
[41:19] divine in other words what is this thing
[41:22] that you have done do you not
[41:23] realize that such a man is i can indeed
[41:26] practice divination and foretell
[41:28] everything you would do so joseph is
[41:31] testing them to see how they would act
[41:34] how they would respond
[41:36] and really i want to make this point
[41:37] here that
[41:39] joseph really wants to know in his heart
[41:42] of hearts
[41:42] if they change
[41:46] and i want to dwell on that concept a
[41:48] little bit if
[41:49] they have changed
[41:54] we're touching it a little bit again and
[41:56] judah said what shall we say unto my
[41:59] lord in other words
[42:00] i'm trying to i don't even know how to
[42:03] put it into words
[42:05] what shall we speak or how shall we
[42:09] clear ourselves
[42:11] god had found out the iniquity of thy
[42:14] servants
[42:16] behold we are my lord servants both we
[42:20] and he also with whom the cup is found
[42:24] in the amplified that verse 16 says so
[42:26] judah said
[42:27] what can we say to my lord what can we
[42:29] reply
[42:30] or how can we clear ourselves sin god
[42:33] since god
[42:34] has exposed the sin and guilt of your
[42:37] sins
[42:38] behold we are my lord slaves the rest of
[42:41] us as well as he
[42:42] with whom the cup is found
[42:46] now something is building here because i
[42:48] want us to recognize
[42:50] that all the years that have passed now
[42:54] at this point in time
[42:56] joseph is 39 years old
[43:02] he was 30 years old when he stood before
[43:05] pharaoh coming out of prison
[43:08] there would have been seven years of
[43:09] famine and now we are at
[43:11] two years sorry seven years of plenty
[43:13] and now we are two years into famine
[43:16] we'll see it a little later on in
[43:17] scripture i want us to
[43:20] notice that for all of these years in
[43:23] question
[43:24] these brothers had never come
[43:27] clean with their father
[43:33] that's a long time
[43:36] to hold something in your heart and not
[43:39] make it right
[43:42] that's a long time to hold something in
[43:44] your heart in agreement
[43:49] because they were all in agreement on
[43:51] this
[43:53] so thing are not seeing the situation
[43:56] for what it is there they are
[43:58] understanding
[44:00] and figuring out and trying to to see
[44:04] how it is unfolding that they are being
[44:06] dealt with
[44:06] for what they have held in secret all
[44:10] along
[44:13] so all of a sudden
[44:16] the condition and the situation the
[44:19] defense
[44:20] a billionaire the defense for for for
[44:23] not wanting to
[44:24] leave benjamin they begin to actually
[44:26] confess
[44:29] and what is the cages because we go in
[44:31] somewhere with this
[44:34] to come out of the situation that they
[44:36] were in
[44:37] here it is judah is saying what can we
[44:40] see it is almost
[44:41] he is saying what he's also thinking so
[44:44] he is logically
[44:45] he's processing he say what can we see
[44:48] how can we reply how can we clear
[44:51] ourselves
[44:52] because now god is exposing it so in his
[44:56] defense i wanted to catch this in his
[44:58] defense
[44:59] his defense becomes a confession
[45:05] let's build
[45:10] what shall we say unto my lord i want to
[45:12] catch it what shall we speak
[45:14] or how shall we clear ourselves
[45:17] and i want you to see it
[45:20] [Music]
[45:21] the greatest teaching out of this part
[45:23] is clearing yourself is coming clean
[45:31] god had found out the iniquity of thy
[45:33] servants behold we are my lord servant
[45:35] both we and he also
[45:36] with whom the cup is found verse 17
[45:40] but joseph we replied god forbid that i
[45:43] should do so
[45:46] in other words i'm not trying to hold
[45:48] all you know so joseph started
[45:50] to move closer to the issue but the man
[45:53] in whose hand the cup is found
[45:55] he shall be my servant and as for you
[45:58] get you up in peace unto your father
[46:02] so joseph is saying and i'll be fighting
[46:04] here far be it from me
[46:05] that i should do that in other words
[46:10] i know all they're saying always are
[46:11] union and all they're working together
[46:13] and our hole in
[46:14] i know they want to stick together but i
[46:17] don't
[46:17] want to stick together i really want the
[46:20] one
[46:21] and i want order to go free in other
[46:23] words he is testing to see if they would
[46:26] be comfortable
[46:27] with repeating what it did the first
[46:28] thing
[46:36] when together they left and left him
[46:39] alone
[46:41] so he's testing if they would do the
[46:43] same thing they did the first time
[46:45] which is move together as a group and
[46:48] leave their brother out in urine
[46:53] verse 17 he said god forbid that i
[46:55] should do so but the man in whose hand
[46:57] the cup is found he shall be my servant
[46:59] and as for you no problem get you up in
[47:02] peace
[47:03] and unto your father verse 18.
[47:09] the confession
[47:12] here judah then jew came near unto him
[47:16] that close to somebody this is this is
[47:19] it is
[47:20] an exposure of vulnerability it's it's
[47:22] that act of
[47:23] sharing and and sharing something that's
[47:25] just confidential
[47:27] then judah came near unto him and said
[47:28] oh my lord
[47:30] let thy servant i pray he speak a word
[47:33] in my lord's ear
[47:36] in other words i have something to tell
[47:38] you
[47:39] that i never tell nobody before
[47:46] i have something to share about my life
[47:50] that i've been keeping locked up it's
[47:52] been eating at me
[47:55] and over the last few experiences that
[47:57] we have coming down to egypt you
[47:58] recognize that the lord
[48:00] want light to shine on this thing
[48:04] this is unfolding in such a way that is
[48:06] better i tell you and
[48:08] even though after you lock up i'd rather
[48:09] tell you i know i can live because i
[48:11] can't live with myself
[48:15] what was transpiring as a test that
[48:17] joseph was giving
[48:18] was actually bringing liberty and
[48:19] freedom to them because
[48:21] it brought a point where they could come
[48:23] clean
[48:25] and i want to use this tonight as a
[48:27] challenge as an encouragement
[48:29] as a teaching about coming
[48:32] clean about making things right
[48:36] about confessing about setting yourself
[48:40] free from the chains of your past and
[48:43] what's binding you
[48:45] verse 18 then judah came near unto him
[48:47] and said o my lord
[48:49] let thy servant i pray thee speak a word
[48:52] in my lord's ear
[48:53] and let not thine anger burn
[48:56] against thy servant for doubt at even
[48:59] as pharaoh
[49:03] so so so judah is peeling a case now he
[49:06] said
[49:06] my lord asked his servant saying have he
[49:09] a father or a brother
[49:12] so now they're going back to the first
[49:14] time they came they go back to the first
[49:16] conversation
[49:17] and they're going back to the first
[49:18] answer they gave and i want us to notice
[49:20] a very subtle thing
[49:22] the first time they came they did not
[49:25] make it explicitly clear the status
[49:29] of their brother
[49:33] they said we have another brother home
[49:35] and another one he not
[49:36] he not whatever not means
[49:41] they never made it clear about their
[49:45] brother
[49:47] maybe it was this recessed part of their
[49:48] mind this gray area there's room in
[49:50] their mind they leave him
[49:51] there because they don't want to admit
[49:53] they don't want to confront they want to
[49:54] deal with
[49:56] verse 20 and we said unto my lord we
[49:58] have a father
[50:00] an old man and a child of his old
[50:03] and a child of his old age a little one
[50:05] and his brother is dead
[50:07] and he alone is left of his mother and
[50:09] his father loved him
[50:11] and thou said unto thy servants bring
[50:13] him down unto me that i may
[50:16] set my eyes upon him and we said unto my
[50:19] lord the lord
[50:20] cannot leave his father for if we should
[50:22] leave his father his father would die
[50:26] and thou said us unto thy servants
[50:28] except your youngest brother come down
[50:30] with you
[50:32] ye shall see my face no more and it came
[50:35] to pass when we came up
[50:37] unto thy servant my father we told him
[50:39] the words of my lord
[50:41] and our father said go again and buy us
[50:43] a little food
[50:45] and we said we cannot go down if our
[50:48] youngest brother be
[50:49] with us then we will go down
[50:52] for we may not see the man's face except
[50:54] our youngest brother be with you
[50:57] be with us sorry and thy servant my
[51:00] father said unto us
[51:01] you know that my wife bearing me two
[51:03] sons
[51:05] and the one went out from me and i said
[51:07] surely he is torn in pieces
[51:09] and i saw him not since if you take this
[51:13] also from me
[51:14] and mischief befall him you shall
[51:18] bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to
[51:21] the grave
[51:23] so they are relating all of this to
[51:25] joseph
[51:28] and joseph is now discerning the
[51:30] character the true character
[51:33] of the men and i want us to appreciate
[51:35] the number of tests that joseph took
[51:37] them through
[51:38] he tested them with money the first time
[51:41] they did not bring the money back
[51:43] so when they brought the money back he
[51:44] said okay well them them boys honest
[51:46] they brought even more they brought
[51:48] gifts they kept their word
[51:50] they brought the youngest brother so now
[51:52] this is like the final phase of the test
[51:54] now to see
[51:55] if they save their own selves what would
[51:58] they do
[51:58] or if they'd be willing to give up their
[52:00] brother and joseph is listening to the
[52:03] pleading of the
[52:04] case now therefore one
[52:07] verse 13. now therefore when i come to
[52:09] thy servant my father
[52:10] and the lad be not with us seeing that
[52:12] his life is bound up in this land's life
[52:15] so they're saying our father is tie up
[52:16] in this boy you want to keep here
[52:20] verse 31 it shall come to pass when he
[52:23] see that the lad is not with us when we
[52:25] go back home and this boy is
[52:26] not with us so in other words they say
[52:28] this is we explain to you
[52:30] why we're not going why are we not
[52:32] leaving this boy why if you keep
[52:33] keeping him you have to keep all of us
[52:35] it shall come to pass
[52:37] when he see that the lord is not with us
[52:39] that he will die
[52:40] and thy servant shall bring down the
[52:42] gray years of thy sermon our father with
[52:44] sorrow to the grief
[52:46] for thy servant speaking judah speaking
[52:49] about himself
[52:50] became surety for the lad unto my father
[52:53] in other words
[52:54] i accepted responsibility
[52:57] in the ambiface it says for your servant
[53:00] became security for the young man to my
[53:02] father
[53:03] saying if i bring him not unto thee then
[53:06] shall i barely blame
[53:07] to my father forever no therefore
[53:12] i pray thee let thy servant
[53:16] abide
[53:19] and this is where it shifted right here
[53:22] you remember we'd have touched on judah
[53:23] a little bit so
[53:27] it went from joseph saying i want to
[53:29] keep benjamin
[53:30] to all your brothers saying well if
[53:31] you're taking him you have to take all
[53:32] of us
[53:34] so now judah pleading a case
[53:37] now bear in mind judah was the one who
[53:39] sent long joseph into egypt
[53:42] this was the brother who was who was if
[53:44] you want to say the directly responsible
[53:46] individual
[53:48] who came up with the idea send him down
[53:50] to egypt
[53:51] here the transition now now therefore i
[53:56] pray he let thy servant abide
[53:59] instead of the land abundment to my lord
[54:03] and let the lord go up with his brethren
[54:08] judah was ready to take his brother's
[54:11] place
[54:13] and he gives a condition for how shall i
[54:15] go up to my father
[54:16] and the lad be not with me lest for
[54:20] adventure i see the evil
[54:21] that shall come on my father we almost
[54:25] done for tonight we're not going to be
[54:26] too long
[54:29] verse chapter 45 verse 1
[54:33] and this is when it is in this like for
[54:36] me it's
[54:36] it's a great climax
[54:40] of this whole journey a 39 year old man
[54:44] who spent more of his adult life
[54:47] away from his family
[54:51] than his time with his family
[54:54] left home at 17
[54:59] 22 years later seeing the signs of
[55:02] reconciliation
[55:04] he held it together as long as he
[55:06] possibly can
[55:08] and genesis 45 was one then joseph
[55:11] could not refrain himself before all
[55:14] them that stood by him
[55:16] bear in mind the last two encounters he
[55:18] had with his emotions
[55:21] and his feelings and his memories he did
[55:24] it in secret
[55:25] but sometimes they come to a point where
[55:27] you don't care no more
[55:29] there come a point where it's bigger
[55:31] than me it's bigger than you
[55:33] it's bigger than saving face it's bigger
[55:35] than what people think about me
[55:38] joseph couldn't refill himself before
[55:40] all them that stood by him and he cried
[55:43] he said cause every man to go out from
[55:46] me
[55:48] i'm sorry and there stood no man with
[55:50] him while joseph
[55:52] made himself known unto his brethren
[55:55] and we know that the prophet would have
[55:57] typed this
[55:58] so joseph sent all the gentiles out
[56:02] including his wife and children brother
[56:04] branham said
[56:06] this was joseph making himself known he
[56:08] typed into the 344 000
[56:11] so we understand all these things there
[56:14] but the magnitude of this
[56:18] it's it's just so real to see
[56:23] at that point he felt he could be honest
[56:26] with him
[56:27] because he felt love he felt compassion
[56:30] judah the same judah
[56:32] 22 years before
[56:35] to say true numb to egypt here he was
[56:38] pleading
[56:40] to keep his younger brother safe
[56:43] to make sure his father has no more hoot
[56:46] and at that point joe's ever seen these
[56:49] boys repent
[56:51] it was no longer words i wanted to catch
[56:53] this
[56:54] it was no longer the talking or talk
[56:57] they were willing
[56:58] judah was willing to put his life on the
[57:00] line for what he believed
[57:02] he was willing to take his brother's
[57:04] place he was willing to
[57:06] self-sacrifice to ensure that his father
[57:09] had no more good
[57:12] are you willing to self-sacrifice to
[57:13] make sure that your father your heavenly
[57:15] father have no more hit
[57:18] when you look at your life and your
[57:21] mistakes
[57:22] and decisions that you made that had
[57:24] consequences
[57:25] intended or otherwise when you reflect
[57:28] on these things
[57:30] are you willing to sacrifice to not
[57:32] cause your heavenly father any more hurt
[57:34] it's a deep question man because our
[57:37] actions
[57:39] contain god
[57:43] god has emotions you know
[57:46] he's a jealous god he gets angries
[57:53] he is touched he feels he he
[57:57] he the issues around your life affects
[58:01] him
[58:05] you don't think god gets disappointed
[58:09] way back in genesis the bible said
[58:12] god repented that he made man
[58:16] when he looked at how man came in there
[58:18] noah
[58:21] he said what this is not what i create
[58:22] them for look at them
[58:41] lord oh hallelujah
[58:45] thank you lord jesus
[58:49] do you understand how your actions
[58:52] affect god
[58:56] sometimes we think maybe of how our
[58:58] actions affect other people or something
[59:00] we don't even
[59:01] think of how it affects other people
[59:04] but at that point in time here i want to
[59:06] just kneel down
[59:08] the tipping point for joseph
[59:11] was twofold one it was judah's
[59:13] willingness to sacrifice
[59:15] for his brother and his consciousness
[59:19] of the effect that if he didn't do
[59:21] something about it
[59:23] how how his father would have been
[59:24] affected let's bring this to a close
[59:31] verse two and he wept aloud
[59:35] in the two previous encounters he wept
[59:37] in secret
[59:38] he wept in his room the last time he
[59:40] read he ran to his room to find a place
[59:42] to weep
[59:43] but now he wept aloud and and listen to
[59:46] this and the egyptians
[59:47] and the house of pharaoh hood
[59:51] that's powerful
[59:58] he didn't care anymore he didn't care
[1:00:00] who here
[1:00:02] he didn't care what people said because
[1:00:04] what was taking place was more important
[1:00:06] to him
[1:00:07] than people's perception of who he was
[1:00:10] what he was
[1:00:10] what he was going through in the last
[1:00:13] two encounters
[1:00:14] he was focused on saving face he was
[1:00:16] focused on
[1:00:17] people's impression the bible said he
[1:00:19] even washed his face to hide
[1:00:21] what he was going through but now i
[1:00:23] reached a tipping point for him it did
[1:00:25] not
[1:00:25] matter what people said too many of us
[1:00:29] are
[1:00:30] sensitive of what people say people's
[1:00:33] emotions how people will see it
[1:00:35] what they'll say about it
[1:00:39] you have to know what is so important to
[1:00:41] you
[1:00:42] what matters to you so much that it does
[1:00:44] not matter what anybody say about it
[1:00:48] if that people don't want to come to the
[1:00:49] altar when there's an altar called
[1:00:51] because
[1:00:51] they're wondering what people will say
[1:00:53] here it was
[1:00:55] the man who judah just said great like
[1:00:58] pharaoh
[1:01:02] the bible said you wept aloud and the
[1:01:03] egyptians and the house of pharaoh hood
[1:01:07] verse 3 and joseph said unto his
[1:01:10] brethren i
[1:01:11] am joseph but my father yet live
[1:01:15] now bear in mind this question was
[1:01:19] already
[1:01:20] answered earlier so it is not that he's
[1:01:24] asking the question
[1:01:25] for an answer he's now asking the
[1:01:27] question from a different context
[1:01:30] in other words he had asked the question
[1:01:32] before
[1:01:34] in his role of his office as governor
[1:01:37] now he's asking the question as his
[1:01:38] brother
[1:01:42] so so it's it's it's the relationship
[1:01:45] has shifted so
[1:01:46] so i am joseph that my father yet lived
[1:01:49] he knew he alive you know but he said
[1:01:51] asking us now
[1:01:52] a different kind of question then
[1:01:54] because
[1:01:55] this is 22 years in he making
[1:02:00] and his brethren couldn't answer now
[1:02:02] they answered this before you know
[1:02:05] but under the context of the current
[1:02:07] most
[1:02:08] moment they do even any words for they
[1:02:11] were troubled at his presence
[1:02:15] what a paradoxa in the amplified it says
[1:02:21] but his brothers were speechless
[1:02:24] for they were stunned and dismayed this
[1:02:27] made
[1:02:28] doesn't even mean excited you know devil
[1:02:30] is just shocked
[1:02:32] they cannot believe no 22 years is not
[1:02:34] two years ago
[1:02:37] 22 years ago
[1:02:40] by the fact that they were in joseph's
[1:02:42] presence they couldn't believe
[1:02:47] and joseph said unto his bedroom come
[1:02:49] near to me
[1:02:51] so the fact that he didn't say come near
[1:02:53] to me speaks volumes never say
[1:02:55] they almost catatonic everything
[1:02:57] catatonic
[1:02:59] people say in complete complete shock
[1:03:01] that frozen in position
[1:03:03] they cannot believe the secret that they
[1:03:05] kept for 22 years
[1:03:07] the thing that they couldn't confront
[1:03:09] with 20 years the guilt
[1:03:11] that they carried for 20 years come on
[1:03:13] now
[1:03:15] what they taught was a weight upon them
[1:03:18] for 22 years
[1:03:19] that they carried the burden of it for
[1:03:21] 22 years
[1:03:24] the burden that they thought was heavier
[1:03:26] was actually lighter
[1:03:27] because they didn't know that joseph was
[1:03:29] in this position joseph was okay
[1:03:31] joseph was alive what they buried and
[1:03:34] taught was secret was in front of them
[1:03:35] doing better than they could have ever
[1:03:37] expected and we'll see how joseph will
[1:03:38] bring it out
[1:03:40] and joseph said unto his version come
[1:03:42] near to me i pray you
[1:03:45] and they came near and he said i am
[1:03:46] joseph your brother
[1:03:48] looking repeating it to them so you see
[1:03:50] clearly trying to help them to realize
[1:03:53] that
[1:03:53] this is real whom you saw into egypt
[1:03:57] so you starting to bring pieces together
[1:03:59] for them to convince them because they
[1:04:00] cannot believe
[1:04:02] bear in mind the journey they would have
[1:04:03] gone through you you remember a couple
[1:04:05] of chapters before
[1:04:06] the man in egypt the man in egypt say
[1:04:08] you won this the man in egypt said he
[1:04:10] won this and here it is the man
[1:04:12] they say i am joseph every brother whom
[1:04:14] you're sold into egypt we almost done
[1:04:17] now therefore be not grieved no angry
[1:04:20] with yourselves
[1:04:22] that he sold me hither for god did send
[1:04:25] me before you
[1:04:27] to preserve life for these two years
[1:04:31] see that's where the mats come from
[1:04:33] right for these two years had the famine
[1:04:36] been in the land
[1:04:37] and yet there are five years in which
[1:04:39] there shall be neither
[1:04:41] be it shall neither be airing nor
[1:04:43] harvest
[1:04:44] and god sent me before you
[1:04:48] to preserve you a posterity in the earth
[1:04:51] you remember i said it that deal
[1:04:54] schreiber judah had to be preserved
[1:04:56] that the churn of israel had to be
[1:04:57] preserved
[1:04:59] so this whole unfolding of storing grain
[1:05:02] where there was the storage facility for
[1:05:04] green was designed
[1:05:06] for the posterity of the children of
[1:05:08] israel
[1:05:09] egypt was benefiting because the line of
[1:05:13] the tribe of judah had to be preserved
[1:05:15] all the nations would come into egypt
[1:05:17] the reason they
[1:05:18] had egypt to go to at that time was
[1:05:20] because of the children of israel and
[1:05:22] the line
[1:05:23] to preserve a posterity on the earth
[1:05:27] hallelujah i want you to see that
[1:05:34] and to save your lives by a great
[1:05:37] deliverance
[1:05:38] in the amplified it says god sent me to
[1:05:40] egypt
[1:05:41] ahead of you so here he not tapered into
[1:05:45] no prison
[1:05:46] and and he said god sent me to egypt
[1:05:49] ahead of you to preserve you
[1:05:50] for a remnant on the earth that's the
[1:05:52] amplified doesn't this song familiar
[1:05:54] look at the words in the amplified here
[1:05:55] look at me typing in here and to keep
[1:05:58] you alive by a great escape
[1:06:01] so they stored up food in egypt is a
[1:06:03] great escape for a remnant for posterity
[1:06:06] oh come on now
[1:06:11] what joseph didn't understand because
[1:06:14] up until this point up until this famine
[1:06:18] he didn't understand his purpose you
[1:06:20] know
[1:06:22] before this encounter with his family
[1:06:24] and what was happening
[1:06:25] all he knew he was a survivor that by
[1:06:28] the grace of god he was standing
[1:06:30] strong making it he didn't even
[1:06:32] understand the connection when he was
[1:06:34] thrown into the prison between him being
[1:06:36] there and him saving his house
[1:06:41] and that family in that messed up
[1:06:43] situation and in the
[1:06:44] agreement to keep in secret the bad
[1:06:47] decisions they made in life
[1:06:48] didn't realize that there was a bigger
[1:06:50] plan
[1:06:51] at work
[1:06:54] and we see on both sides what was
[1:06:57] intended for evil
[1:06:59] what was intended for this way or that
[1:07:00] way and what happened this week however
[1:07:02] it happened
[1:07:03] because god is so good god is the only
[1:07:06] one can bring together
[1:07:07] different stories and line them all up
[1:07:10] look at us in this room
[1:07:12] if we take all of us have stories that
[1:07:14] could unfold similar to this
[1:07:15] and god can line it all up no no tuesday
[1:07:18] evening we could be in the same room
[1:07:21] and christ could be making himself known
[1:07:23] to you
[1:07:25] when the whole world is outside and he's
[1:07:27] sending him out of the room he can make
[1:07:28] himself known to you
[1:07:29] by revealing himself to you anybody with
[1:07:32] me tonight
[1:07:34] so verse seven we're almost done and god
[1:07:37] sent me before you to preserve you a
[1:07:39] posterity in the earth
[1:07:41] a legacy in the earth a testimony unto
[1:07:44] the earth
[1:07:45] a remnant on the earth and to save your
[1:07:48] life by a great deliverance the
[1:07:50] amplified says great escape
[1:07:55] so now check this out now this is
[1:07:58] this we know this or no but this is big
[1:08:00] enough because
[1:08:01] many of us going through trials notice i
[1:08:04] say many of you
[1:08:06] i see many of us going through trials
[1:08:10] we in this thing you know
[1:08:14] all kind of experiences we going through
[1:08:19] but look now at the context
[1:08:22] of how somebody who
[1:08:25] went through 22 years of trials talking
[1:08:28] about the trials
[1:08:30] so now it was not you that sent me
[1:08:32] either
[1:08:33] hallelujah listen
[1:08:37] this takes away blaming anybody about
[1:08:40] anything you know
[1:08:41] i want us to get this here this had no
[1:08:43] this take blame audi
[1:08:45] listen it would not be out of context
[1:08:48] for judah to say but it was judah
[1:08:50] and it was you you remember we read the
[1:08:52] scripture how
[1:08:53] when them brothers started to talk and
[1:08:55] joseph was understanding them how they
[1:08:57] say
[1:08:57] when he was his soul was crying out
[1:09:01] because they were sending him to egypt
[1:09:04] this any gate the fact that that
[1:09:06] happened you know
[1:09:09] so so joseph was saying that it happened
[1:09:11] but he's now seeing
[1:09:12] it it's not your fault
[1:09:15] i'm not blaming you you are peace on the
[1:09:18] border
[1:09:19] on this chessboard like i'm a peace on
[1:09:22] the board
[1:09:24] you were being moved and he didn't
[1:09:25] realize he was being moved
[1:09:27] your jealousy your envy your hatred your
[1:09:30] all your feelings
[1:09:31] about me was just moves on the board to
[1:09:34] bring you to this spot and to bring me
[1:09:36] to this spot
[1:09:37] oh come on now so tonight tonight
[1:09:41] if i can kneel down shut down the blame
[1:09:44] it's not your wife it's not your
[1:09:46] children it's not the boss it's not the
[1:09:48] pastor
[1:09:49] it's not the church it's not the
[1:09:50] government there's nobody to blame
[1:09:53] here are mature seasoned sons speak
[1:09:56] so no it was not you that sent me hither
[1:10:03] you weren't even control of your
[1:10:05] emotions when you spoke ill that way you
[1:10:07] it wasn't your it wasn't your plan that
[1:10:10] that changed the trajectory of my life
[1:10:13] if you don't bring this into context we
[1:10:15] can look back and they say
[1:10:17] let us not kill him let us send along to
[1:10:19] egypt it was song as if it was their
[1:10:20] plan
[1:10:21] but it was god who was orchestrating all
[1:10:24] of that i want you to see
[1:10:25] that everything you look back that
[1:10:27] looked like it was a mess
[1:10:28] god hand was to bring us to which spot
[1:10:31] this one right now this spot in this
[1:10:32] room
[1:10:33] right now as god is making himself known
[1:10:35] to you in the midst of your journey
[1:10:37] that bring it to the spot that you can
[1:10:39] look back and speak
[1:10:41] like joseph so no no tonight
[1:10:44] it was not you that sent me heather but
[1:10:46] god

[1:10:52] that the job that you lost was god oh
[1:10:55] listen listen listen the house you lost
[1:10:57] was god
[1:10:59] the situation that didn't work out was
[1:11:01] god it's all god because god allowed
[1:11:04] everything that happened in your life
[1:11:06] nothing could happen friends that god
[1:11:08] didn't allow
[1:11:10] it's either god is in control or he's
[1:11:12] not in control
[1:11:13] and if he's in control then nothing
[1:11:15] could happen to you
[1:11:16] that god didn't allow to happen come on
[1:11:18] now
[1:11:20] that alone should make you want to jump
[1:11:22] that alone to make you want to shout

[1:11:27] experience
[1:11:28] every mountain every valley every
[1:11:31] situation
[1:11:32] is god's grace to you to bring you to a
[1:11:35] spot

[1:11:38] your life
[1:11:39] your life your family life those you
[1:11:42] love
[1:11:43] those that love you
[1:11:48] i'm trying to close out and listen to
[1:11:51] now how joseph speaking now this
[1:11:53] this when i read this it blew my mind
[1:11:55] completely
[1:11:56] so now it was not you that sent me
[1:11:58] heather but god

[1:15:38] god what a victory what a victory
[1:15:40] tonight joseph himself didn't even
[1:15:42] realize the
[1:15:43] magnitude of why he was done in egypt
[1:15:45] until his brethren came
[1:15:47] isn't that something that's powerful
[1:15:49] that is powerful
[1:15:50] from one's perspective he was just like
[1:15:52] a a ceo or next to pharaoh and
[1:15:55] and helping the egyptians and helping by
[1:15:57] vision and so on but
[1:15:59] little did he know when he saw it he it
[1:16:01] that revelation broke upon him
[1:16:03] that god sent me ahead to preserve life
[1:16:05] that's the bigger picture
[1:16:07] that is the big picture god call you
[1:16:09] ahead of the rest of your family

[1:16:31] the enemy mariana
[1:16:33] yay the enemy enemies
[1:16:37] don't let the enemy do it don't let them
[1:16:40] realize
[1:16:41] you know what is in store for them but i
[1:16:43] was i believe the last one i was making
[1:16:45] was joseph was telling them brothers no
[1:16:48] because
[1:16:48] the the egyptians were no longer in the
[1:16:50] room
[1:16:52] you know it was just him and the family
[1:16:54] so he could speak in a way that he
[1:16:56] could have never spoken before this is
[1:16:58] the first time
[1:17:00] he is in the presence of people that he
[1:17:02] can make this kind of statement
[1:17:04] he could not have said this to an
[1:17:05] egyptian they would not have appreciated
[1:17:07] this statement
[1:17:08] but here it is joseph is telling them i
[1:17:11] am like pharaoh's father you say god he
[1:17:15] had made me a father to pharaoh
[1:17:17] this is the first time it would have
[1:17:19] been a thought in joseph
[1:17:20] because joseph never forgot who he was
[1:17:23] hallelujah he never forget where he came
[1:17:25] from he'd never forget his story
[1:17:27] he was locked up in egypt but in his
[1:17:29] heart he still had canaan in his heart
[1:17:31] he still had his father in his heart he
[1:17:33] said his family in his heart
[1:17:34] and he could have never shared his
[1:17:36] testimony until this time now
[1:17:38] when for the first time he could tell
[1:17:40] egyptians go outside it's just me and my
[1:17:42] family alone
[1:17:43] and he could say it was not you that
[1:17:45] sent me hither but god
[1:17:46] and he had made me a father to pharaoh
[1:17:49] that accepted our whole message
[1:17:50] father to pharaoh and lord of all his
[1:17:54] house
[1:17:54] and a ruler throughout all the land of
[1:17:56] egypt i'm getting ready to close out
[1:17:58] here see
[1:17:59] and go up to my father and say unto him
[1:18:02] thus saith thy son joseph god had made
[1:18:05] the lord of all egypt
[1:18:07] come down unto me tarry not you see how
[1:18:10] joseph all of a sudden
[1:18:11] listen i can imagine the energy in that
[1:18:13] room and him i can imagine
[1:18:15] the vibrations in that room and him just
[1:18:18] said thy son joseph
[1:18:22] and he probably said and verse and verse
[1:18:24] 10 and thou shalt dwell in the land of
[1:18:26] goshen
[1:18:27] and thou shalt be near unto me all the
[1:18:31] years
[1:18:31] 22 years you were far from me but look
[1:18:34] how
[1:18:35] immediate and how permanent and how
[1:18:37] clear and direct restoration looks like
[1:18:40] and thou shalt dwell in the land of
[1:18:42] goshen and thou shalt be near unto me
[1:18:44] thou and thy children and thy children's
[1:18:47] children
[1:18:48] and thy flocks and thy hoods and all
[1:18:50] that thou hast
[1:18:52] and there i love it he's in a position
[1:18:54] of strength now
[1:18:55] all of the pain has turned into strength
[1:18:58] all of the sacrifice has turned into
[1:19:00] strength
[1:19:00] all of the crying is now strength all
[1:19:03] that he has gone through
[1:19:04] is now strength his umbilical cord was
[1:19:07] tied to suffering
[1:19:08] but before you could reign you must
[1:19:10] suffer so a perfect type
[1:19:12] of what we have to go through to be
[1:19:14] where we have now and there will i
[1:19:16] nourish thee for yet there are five
[1:19:19] years of famine lest thou and thy
[1:19:22] household and all that thou has come to
[1:19:24] poverty
[1:19:26] and behold your eyes see
[1:19:29] and the eyes of my brother benjamin that
[1:19:31] it is my mouth
[1:19:32] that speak it unto you and you shall
[1:19:34] tell my father of
[1:19:36] all my glory in egypt you see how we
[1:19:39] begin this to speak now
[1:19:40] tell my father of all my glory in egypt
[1:19:43] and all that he have seen
[1:19:45] and he shall hear and bring down my
[1:19:46] father heather
[1:19:48] and he fell upon his brother benjamin's
[1:19:50] neck and wept
[1:19:51] and benjamin wept upon his neck you see
[1:19:54] how this is a whole type here of
[1:19:56] reconciliation
[1:19:57] of reconnecting of of of of unity in the
[1:20:01] family again
[1:20:02] you see how real family time is and how
[1:20:04] god interested in family and restoration
[1:20:06] and coming back together
[1:20:07] and closing the divide so it doesn't
[1:20:10] look 22 years of separation
[1:20:12] and in that moment restoration
[1:20:17] moreover he kissed all his brethren and
[1:20:20] wept upon them and after that his
[1:20:23] brethren talk with him
[1:20:25] and i want us to understand friends this
[1:20:28] would not have been an
[1:20:29] easy experience for those brothers in he
[1:20:31] was trying to help them come unto the
[1:20:33] shell
[1:20:33] of their guilt and i just think just
[1:20:36] think
[1:20:36] of the grace that joseph extended to his
[1:20:39] brothers
[1:20:40] after what his brothers did to him and
[1:20:43] to think
[1:20:44] of the grace that god extend to us when
[1:20:46] we didn't even
[1:20:47] understand what you were doing to him no
[1:20:50] wonder on the cross
[1:20:52] joseph who's the type of christ he had
[1:20:54] jesus saying father forgive them
[1:20:56] for they know not what they do this was
[1:20:58] the same teaching taking place
[1:21:00] way back then genesis it wasn't you you
[1:21:03] didn't understand what he was doing
[1:21:05] you hurt me you didn't understand but
[1:21:07] there was a greater plan behind it
[1:21:11] verse 16 and the fame thereof was heard
[1:21:15] in pharaoh's house saying
[1:21:16] joseph's brethren had come and it
[1:21:18] pleased pharaoh well
[1:21:20] and his servants what a testimony joseph
[1:21:25] had
[1:21:25] that when they hear joseph family reach
[1:21:27] it please hero
[1:21:29] so much because he happy for pharaoh
[1:21:32] you see the paradox of this thing and
[1:21:35] pharaoh said unto joseph say unto thy
[1:21:37] virgin
[1:21:38] this do he laid your beast and go gets
[1:21:41] you onto the land of canaan this is the
[1:21:43] first time we see pharaoh get back
[1:21:44] involved
[1:21:45] into the affairs since he had over to
[1:21:47] jerusalem
[1:21:48] he get involved to give more strength
[1:21:52] to how important joseph is and jesus
[1:21:54] family to joseph
[1:21:56] check it out up until this time remember
[1:21:58] all of the rank orders everything even
[1:22:00] pharaoh said nothing will move
[1:22:02] unless joseph say it and pharaoh senator
[1:22:04] joseph as if to reinforce

[1:23:07] joseph gave them wagons
[1:23:09] according to the commandment of pharaoh
[1:23:12] and gave them provision for the way to
[1:23:15] all of them he gave each man changed his
[1:23:17] arraignment
[1:23:18] but to benjamin he gave 300 pieces of
[1:23:21] silver and five changes of agreement
[1:23:24] boy he loved that brother and to his
[1:23:27] father
[1:23:28] he's sent after this manner 10 asses
[1:23:30] laden with the good things of egypt
[1:23:32] 10 she asses lady with corn and bread
[1:23:34] and meat for his father by the way
[1:23:36] so he sent his virgin away and they
[1:23:37] repotted and he said to them see
[1:23:39] that you fall not out by the way in
[1:23:41] other words don't lose your way go
[1:23:42] straight there
[1:23:43] and they went up out of egypt and came
[1:23:46] into the land of canaan unto jacob
[1:23:48] their father and told him saying joseph
[1:23:50] is yet alive
[1:23:52] and he is governor over all the land of
[1:23:54] egypt and jacob's heart fainted
[1:23:56] for he believed them not poor
[1:23:59] poor jacob jacob
[1:24:03] made him land features and they told him
[1:24:05] all the words of joseph
[1:24:07] which he had seven to them and when he
[1:24:08] saw
[1:24:10] again i wanted to catch this they were
[1:24:13] talking to him all the time
[1:24:15] they told him joseph is alive they told
[1:24:18] him all the words of joseph
[1:24:19] which he had said unto them but listen
[1:24:21] to what convinced him
[1:24:23] you see the difference between word and
[1:24:24] manifestation and word and demonstration
[1:24:26] and the gospel is a word only and in
[1:24:28] power when he saw the wagons
[1:24:32] in other words when he saw the physical
[1:24:34] manifestation of what they were talking
[1:24:36] about
[1:24:37] he knew that wagon was in their wagons
[1:24:39] these were wagons ordered by the king it
[1:24:41] had to be a great poet he said when he
[1:24:43] saw the wagons
[1:24:45] with joseph had sent to carry him the
[1:24:47] spirit of jacob
[1:24:48] their father revived listen friends
[1:24:52] people have to see something
[1:24:56] you catch me people have to see
[1:24:59] something
[1:25:00] it can't be talk something has to be
[1:25:04] visible
[1:25:05] people have to know something change in
[1:25:08] your life in your walk in your talk
[1:25:11] and israel said it is enough in other
[1:25:13] words when he saw
[1:25:14] what came he said it is enough i don't
[1:25:16] need to see no more
[1:25:18] i see all i need to see it is enough
[1:25:21] joseph my son is yet alive i will go
[1:25:23] and see him before i die
[1:25:26] hallelujah and there will come a time
[1:25:28] friends that the manifestation
[1:25:30] will be enough the manifestation will be
[1:25:33] the interpretation
[1:25:34] the demonstration will be enough the
[1:25:36] fulfillment of prophecy will be enough
[1:25:39] the stored up food and the expression of
[1:25:41] it will be enough
[1:25:43] can we give the lord a way of offering a
[1:25:46] hand clap of praise
[1:25:48] can we give the lord thanks and can we
[1:25:51] pledge to hold in our heart if it's one
[1:25:54] lesson that i want to leave us with
[1:25:56] tonight it's the maturity
[1:26:00] in the face of situations
[1:26:03] to look at the situations that come and
[1:26:06] be able to say
[1:26:07] god sent me so it was not you that sent
[1:26:12] me but god
[1:26:14] i want you to see there's nothing
[1:26:16] tonight friends that you could do about
[1:26:18] yesterday
[1:26:19] about last week about last month about
[1:26:22] last year you can't undo a decision you
[1:26:26] can't change what transpired
[1:26:27] you can't do anything about yesterday
[1:26:29] you can't do anything about this morning
[1:26:32] it has already passed the most you do is
[1:26:34] say a word or
[1:26:35] say a prayer or say but the reality is
[1:26:38] the
[1:26:39] the ph has already turned and we're in
[1:26:41] this room tonight
[1:26:42] and the page is turning of what happens
[1:26:45] now what happens next what are the next
[1:26:49] moves that you have to make
[1:26:50] knowing fully well that you cannot
[1:26:52] change your past and the reality is
[1:26:55] god brought us into this room tonight we
[1:26:57] are little hiccups
[1:26:58] even the technology want to act up but
[1:27:01] it's it's a truth that is coming to us
[1:27:03] tonight to bring us to this spot
[1:27:05] that nothing is by chance nothing is by
[1:27:08] accident
[1:27:08] and you want to acknowledge this whole
[1:27:11] thing about
[1:27:12] don't blame anybody else and even bigger
[1:27:14] friends you can't even blame yourself
[1:27:19] i don't even want you to blame yourself
[1:27:21] i want you to trust
[1:27:22] the process and trust god
[1:27:26] and make a commitment tonight to press
[1:27:29] forward don't be on the sidelines
[1:27:35] this was a moment of truth for joseph
[1:27:38] because he couldn't talk this way before
[1:27:40] this point
[1:27:42] this chapter here in genesis 45 is the
[1:27:45] chapter
[1:27:46] when he could refrain himself
[1:27:50] in other words he lost himself i've seen
[1:27:53] people sit along in church
[1:27:54] for a long time and then they see when
[1:27:55] somebody have a real breakthrough
[1:27:57] you know they reach a point where they
[1:27:59] care what nobody see
[1:28:00] they jump they shout they cry
[1:28:04] that does not have put on a show
[1:28:06] something has to trigger on the inside
[1:28:09] and joseph would have had this locked up
[1:28:11] in his heart for a long time
[1:28:13] but he came to his crossroads where he
[1:28:15] was ready to be who he really was
[1:28:18] because he was seeing his brethren and
[1:28:19] tonight we are with our brethren
[1:28:22] we are here united by where we come from
[1:28:26] united by where we are going and we are
[1:28:28] all saying to one another
[1:28:30] it is god it's god in you
[1:28:33] it's god in me it's god who has brought
[1:28:35] us here it is god who has brought us
[1:28:37] together
[1:28:39] there's nothing that has gone wrong
[1:28:42] to bring us to this spot god brought us
[1:28:44] here for our purpose let us bow here for
[1:28:46] a word of prayer
[1:28:48] or heavenly father lord this little
[1:28:50] simple teaching and
[1:28:51] part three of this study of joseph and
[1:28:54] the unfolding
[1:28:55] of this this great testimony lord of
[1:28:58] this
[1:28:58] this joseph who typed out christ lord
[1:29:00] nothing against joseph and to see
[1:29:03] lord how he persevered how he withstood
[1:29:05] he had his moments he
[1:29:07] he clearly had his times of
[1:29:08] disappointment and all these things that
[1:29:10] to see
[1:29:11] lord the great climax the great
[1:29:13] reconciliation the great
[1:29:14] restoration and lord the maturity
[1:29:18] lord to look at the situation he could
[1:29:20] have said it was judah
[1:29:22] he could have said it was my brother's
[1:29:24] he could have said earlier she didn't
[1:29:25] have to do that and
[1:29:26] and and and while it was so and but he
[1:29:29] said
[1:29:29] it was god who sent me to preserve life
[1:29:34] he acknowledged the bigger plan he
[1:29:37] acknowledged a higher purpose he
[1:29:40] acknowledged higher calling
[1:29:42] he saw the bigger picture he looked
[1:29:45] beyond
[1:29:46] their force he looked beyond his issues
[1:29:50] and he saw the great plan that you were
[1:29:52] unfolding
[1:29:53] that there was a posterity there was a
[1:29:55] great escape
[1:29:56] there was an opportunity for his family
[1:29:58] to be saved not just saved
[1:30:01] not just avoid poverty but preserved
[1:30:04] life that the legacy of the
[1:30:07] tribe of judah and all the tribes of
[1:30:09] israel could be
[1:30:11] lord part of the the great journey of
[1:30:13] scripture
[1:30:14] and life even up to this time now lord
[1:30:17] even to

[1:30:56] believe it they told him
[1:30:58] all joseph's word he didn't believe it
[1:31:00] but when he saw
[1:31:01] what joseph sent when he saw something
[1:31:04] that he could say nah nah this is
[1:31:06] what i see here is too much this is not
[1:31:08] words anymore lord give us
