[14:02] well i greet you this morning in the
[14:03] precious name of jesus christ it is
[14:06] certainly good to be back home
[14:08] in fellowship at the church i feel at
[14:11] home
[14:12] amen after the nigeria convention and
[14:15] then i went on to germany for a meeting
[14:17] that they had over there and last sunday
[14:20] i wasn't here physically but i was
[14:21] connected to the internet by the
[14:23] internet to the live stream so i was
[14:24] just as much in service as you were and
[14:27] i know we had a tremendous time last
[14:28] week how many appreciate but over his
[14:30] message last week
[14:31] [Music]
[14:33] amen so on behalf of brother charles
[14:35] akachube and the believers from enugu
[14:38] nigeria and the many countries and
[14:40] churches and pastors and ministers i
[14:42] greet you on their behalf also from the
[14:44] believers in germany and france
[14:47] who gathered for the special youth
[14:48] meeting in germany we really had a
[14:50] tremendous time and i could truly see
[14:53] that all over the world the spirit is
[14:56] moving you may be seated
[14:58] so i'm going to close off this session
[15:00] billy branham and the message the spoken
[15:02] word is the original seed he said god
[15:05] never placed signs ahead of his word let
[15:07] me say that again god never placed signs
[15:10] ahead of his word they were added for
[15:13] proof of the word but the word is fist
[15:16] can the church say man so i don't want
[15:18] to see anybody running around caught up
[15:21] on the signs we want to make sure that
[15:23] the word is first we want to make sure
[15:25] our lives are in order with the world
[15:28] because that's what god is coming to see
[15:30] he's not coming to find out how much you
[15:31] know about what time the blood moon is
[15:33] going to be he wants to know when i see
[15:35] the blood i'm going to pass over you
[15:38] that's the blood i want to talk about i
[15:40] don't want to talk about the blood moon
[15:41] but when i see the blood i'm going to
[15:44] pass over you because before the
[15:46] judgment before this world is destroyed
[15:49] all of this is going to happen but god
[15:51] is going to have a people he is gonna
[15:53] have a bride it might be a handful of
[15:55] people it might be five people it might
[15:58] be ten people listen this is not for
[16:00] everybody
[16:02] you don't hear me this morning this
[16:04] gospel is not for everybody god wants it
[16:07] to be for everybody but through his
[16:09] foreknowledge he knew who would be here
[16:12] he knew who would stand he knew who
[16:14] would push back the works of darkness he
[16:17] knew
[16:18] can the church say amen so you are
[16:20] blessed this morning because you are
[16:22] predestinated to be here this morning
[16:25] and the devil the demon the no praise
[16:28] demon the backsliding demon the lost
[16:31] demon the selfishness demon the jealousy
[16:34] demon the envy demon we are serving
[16:37] every demon notice tell the devil you
[16:40] look at the signs but we are the cause
[16:42] this morning we are here to throw the
[16:44] devil out because we receive a kingdom
[16:47] that shall not be moved shall not be
[16:50] shaken shall not oh you don't hear me
[16:52] this morning you don't hear me this
[16:54] morning oh hallelujah the devil is in
[16:58] trouble i'm selling the devil notice he
[17:01] picked the wrong day he picked the wrong
[17:03] time this is the september the 27th let
[17:06] the world watch this time we are gonna
[17:09] watch our sign we are gonna be a sign a
[17:12] super sign a super church as we near the
[17:15] headstone we are gonna cause a revival
[17:18] can the church say amen
[17:20] oh you may be seated
[17:22] so let the devil laugh at you let the
[17:25] devil mock you let the devil tell you
[17:27] you're wasting your time they laughed at
[17:29] noah they mocked at noah they told noah
[17:32] you're wasting your time but there came
[17:34] a day that god shut the door could this
[17:37] sign be gone about to shut the door we
[17:40] don't know but let the world laugh let
[17:42] your family laugh let your neighbors
[17:44] laughter but as for me and my house i'm
[17:47] gonna serve the lord i don't need
[17:49] another sign we already have our time
[17:52] malachi 4 he already came as a sign to
[17:55] us that there is a new land that is
[18:00] oh
[18:02] glory you may be seated
[18:04] jesus he told the disciples you could
[18:07] tell the days and the season and the
[18:09] time but i'm right here and you didn't
[18:11] even see that i'm among you you don't
[18:13] even recognize that the message you're
[18:15] talking about has been made flesh up has
[18:18] been made a reality and one of these
[18:20] days this message we talked about this

[25:49] of scripture
[25:51] reading from the book of hagai
[25:53] in the old testament
[25:55] about two books before the book of
[25:57] malachi
[25:58] and the book of hebrews
[26:12] amen
[26:14] he guy
[26:15] chapter 2
[26:18] and reading from verse 6
[26:20] and hebrews 12
[26:22] reading from verse 25
[26:27] starting with higgai 2. for thus saith
[26:29] the lord of hosts
[26:31] yet once it is a little while and i will
[26:34] shake the heavens
[26:36] and the earth and the sea
[26:39] and the dry land
[26:41] and i will shake all nations and the
[26:43] desire of all nations shall come
[26:46] and i will fill this house with glory
[26:48] sear the lord of hosts
[26:50] the silver is mine and the goal is mine
[26:53] say the lord of hosts the glory of this
[26:56] latter house
[26:57] shall be greater than of the former say
[26:59] the lord of hosts and in this place will
[27:02] i give peace saith the lord of hosts are
[27:05] reading from hebrews chapter 12
[27:07] and reading from verse 25
[27:13] hebrews 12
[27:15] and verse 25
[27:17] see that you refuse not him that speak
[27:20] it
[27:21] for if we escape not hurry if they
[27:24] escape not to refuse him that speak on
[27:27] earth much more shall we
[27:29] shall not we escape if we turn away
[27:32] from him that speaketh
[27:34] from heaven
[27:36] whose voice then shook the earth but now
[27:39] he hath promised saying yet once more i
[27:42] shake not the earth only but also heaven
[27:46] and this word yet once more signified
[27:50] the removing of those things that are
[27:52] shaken as of things that are made that
[27:55] those things which cannot be shaken may
[27:58] remain
[27:59] wherefore we receiving a kingdom which
[28:01] cannot be moved let us have grace
[28:03] whereby we may serve god acceptably with
[28:06] reverence and godly fear for our god is
[28:09] a consuming
[28:11] fire
[28:12] may the lord have a blessing to the
[28:14] reading of his word can we bow our heads
[28:16] once more

[28:19] presence your love and your grace that
[28:21] you extended to us this morning lord now
[28:24] may you give unction to speak to your

[28:30] weapon against the works of darkness

[28:35] seven church ages but as we come to the

[28:51] spirit lord arrest every heart lord may

[29:03] amen you may be seated this morning so i
[29:05] have a title this morning and for quite
[29:09] some time i've wanted to speak in this
[29:10] subject and i don't believe i'll have
[29:12] all the time this morning to bring
[29:14] justice to it but i'm depending
[29:16] completely on god to breathe life upon
[29:20] it but it's taken from one time the
[29:22] prophet made a statement and i believe
[29:25] more than ever that statement is so
[29:26] relevant today
[29:29] and my title is the thunder
[29:32] that shakes the devil
[29:35] that's my title this morning the thunder
[29:37] that shakes the devil and my subject the
[29:40] unfailing realities of the living god
[29:44] and for inspiration the manifestation
[29:47] of the life
[29:48] of christ so as we said at the beginning
[29:51] we want to be very focused this morning
[29:53] because
[29:54] you come to realize as you go through
[29:56] life
[29:57] you are either getting closer to god or
[29:59] further from god and it is imperative
[30:02] that you maintain the focus on what is
[30:04] important in your life too often we
[30:07] spend times focusing on what is not
[30:09] important and the script to be read
[30:11] speak about a shaking that's coming and
[30:14] everything that can be shaken will be
[30:16] shaken
[30:17] but all the stuff that has no sound
[30:20] foundation is going to be destroyed and
[30:22] only what is eternal will last so it
[30:24] means your job is going to shake your
[30:26] house is going to shake your family it's
[30:28] going to shake your money it's going to
[30:30] shake your everything that is natural
[30:32] that is man-made that is handmade that
[30:34] is for the here and now it's going to be
[30:36] destroyed but with this shaking this
[30:39] final shaking only the things that are
[30:41] eternal that cannot be shaken is what is
[30:44] going to remain and that's what we want
[30:46] to focus on this morning the things that
[30:49] are eternal but before we leave this
[30:51] place god is going to raise up a people
[30:53] to give the devil the final knockout
[30:55] punch and by their lives their lived
[30:58] voices their testimony the sermons that
[31:00] they will preach brought in and out the
[31:02] pulpit will be but the branham said the
[31:04] thunder that shakes the devil so before
[31:07] you leave here your testimony is going
[31:09] to be one of shaking the devil shaking
[31:12] the devil in your house shaking the
[31:13] devil on your job shaking the devil on
[31:16] your school shaking the devil in your
[31:18] neighborhood you are going to have a
[31:19] testimony just like enoch had a
[31:22] testimony that before he leave this
[31:24] place he pleased god and you will also
[31:26] have a testimony before you leave this
[31:29] place that you please god you cannot
[31:31] leave this place unless you have that
[31:33] kind of a testimony somebody say man
[31:36] [Applause]
[31:38] oh glory glory glory glory glory so we
[31:41] had a wonderful time in digo martin on
[31:43] wednesday night and we were speaking on
[31:45] have you received the holy ghost since
[31:48] you believed and we were talking about
[31:50] you as an individual not the person next
[31:52] to you not the person behind you but
[31:54] have you received the holy ghost since
[31:57] you believe because god has a promise of
[31:59] something for you and without it you can
[32:01] go anywhere because he said you shall
[32:03] receive power after the holy ghost comes
[32:06] upon you so there's a prophecy and
[32:08] there's another prophecy there's a
[32:09] prophecy of you receiving the holy ghost
[32:11] and it's a prophecy of power coming with
[32:14] that holy ghost and that power is power
[32:16] to pray but the random said its power to
[32:18] overcome its power to speak its power to
[32:21] live a holy life its power to forgive
[32:24] its power to have a testimony and the
[32:26] church same am and you are going to have
[32:29] power
[32:31] oh
[32:32] somebody say man and that's why the
[32:34] devil is so afraid of the holy ghost
[32:36] he's not afraid of you coming to church
[32:38] he's not afraid of you shouting he's
[32:40] unafraid of you singing he's not even
[32:42] afraid of you praying too much but when
[32:44] the power comes up then the devil has a
[32:46] reason to be scared because the same
[32:49] signs and the same wonders that's your
[32:51] promise god never promised you to be a
[32:53] good church member and to have a good
[32:55] church seat and for people to know you
[32:57] in church know your promise is the same
[32:59] signs the same wonders the same miracles
[33:02] and most importantly the same life when
[33:05] people see you they must see jesus when
[33:08] they see you they must see the messiah
[33:10] somebody say man glory to god
[33:13] hallelujah i'm excited because we are
[33:16] coming into bride material we are
[33:18] getting into bride condition and we have
[33:21] a responsibility to make a church to
[33:24] make a revival that's not the pastor's
[33:26] responsibility that's not the minister's
[33:28] responsibility that's not the elder's
[33:30] responsibility it is our responsibility
[33:33] so god is going to turn the heat up in
[33:36] the church seven times hotter because
[33:38] there are some church members in here he
[33:40] wants to filter out there are some make
[33:42] believers in here that he wants to get
[33:44] out so that only true believers the
[33:47] ephesians church is only made up of true
[33:49] believers so god is going to begin to
[33:52] shake the church
[33:54] oh you don't hear me this morning he's
[33:56] going to be going to shake the church
[33:58] he's going to shake the church he's
[34:00] going to shake the world and anything
[34:02] that doesn't have a foundation it's
[34:04] finished but that's how god is going to
[34:06] know who are his children because those
[34:09] that are eternal do the skin worms
[34:11] destroy this body yet in my flesh i'll
[34:14] see god though ten thousand fall on one
[34:16] side i shall not be moved why there's an
[34:19] eternal gene inside of your soul that no
[34:22] matter what happens you're still
[34:24] standing you have no money you're still
[34:26] standing you're still sick but you're
[34:29] still standing knowing fully well that
[34:31] there's a prophecy over you that you
[34:33] shall be healed you're not delivered but
[34:36] there's a prophecy over you you shall be
[34:38] delivered but god has shaken this
[34:41] morning he is shaking everything around
[34:43] you glory to god
[34:46] somebody say man
[34:49] oh hallelujah
[34:51] hallelujah
[34:52] oh glory glory glory glory glory
[34:55] oh hallelujah oh glory glory glory
[34:59] hallelujah you may be seated i want to
[35:02] read that scripture one more time i'm
[35:04] going somewhere this morning hebrews 12
[35:06] see that you refuse not him that speak
[35:09] it in other words there's somebody
[35:10] speaking but don't make the mistake and
[35:13] refusing him because what he's speaking
[35:16] is the word of god and paul is writing
[35:19] and he said for if they did not escape
[35:22] who refused him that speak on the earth
[35:24] when jesus was here they rejected him
[35:26] they refused him he said much more we
[35:29] shall not escape if we turn away from
[35:32] him who's speaking from heaven and
[35:34] there's a voice that's still speaking
[35:35] from heaven and there's a voice that
[35:37] spoke from heaven on books and tapes you
[35:40] don't reject that now but that voice
[35:43] paul is saying once shook the earth when
[35:45] that voice came down on the pyramid on
[35:48] the mountain on mount sinai the earth
[35:50] trembled the earth shook and god
[35:53] speaking and the people say listen don't
[35:55] let god speak let moses speak because
[35:58] god's voice is a thunder when god speaks
[36:01] the rocks begin to tremble when god
[36:03] speaks the sky begins to shake when god
[36:06] speaks the animals know who's talking
[36:08] because that is el ella elohim that is
[36:11] jehovah jireh that is the king of kings
[36:14] it's the lord of lords it's the priest
[36:16] the pins of peace is the lord god mighty
[36:18] in battle and when he speaks everything
[36:21] knows it's messed up because he is god
[36:23] all by himself and the brother branham
[36:26] taught us one day this world will hear
[36:28] once more from god it will be that same
[36:31] god speaking but it will be true of
[36:33] pride it's going to be through you can
[36:35] the church say man
[36:38] you may be seated
[36:40] i know you don't feel like it
[36:42] i know sometimes you wonder
[36:44] why am i still going why i'm still
[36:46] fighting why i'm still pressing on and
[36:49] you gotta take that word you out of it
[36:51] you gotta take the word i out of it
[36:53] because you are not even the believer
[36:55] but abraham taught us the word in you is
[36:57] the believer so you haven't been coming
[37:00] to church you haven't been reading books
[37:02] you haven't even been praying but the
[37:03] word inside of you that seed inside of
[37:06] you is fighting pressing its way out
[37:09] there's another life in you and there's
[37:11] a war going on but one of these days
[37:13] that life is predestinated to come forth
[37:17] and that's why we come to church that's
[37:19] why we come to church to create a right
[37:21] atmosphere for that word cedar to come
[37:24] alive so we are watering the sea this
[37:26] morning with our worship we are watering
[37:29] the sea this morning with our praises
[37:32] that's why when the praises go up the
[37:34] glory could come down so we are creating
[37:36] an atmosphere this morning for the
[37:38] miraculous to take place and make no
[37:41] mistake about it it's going to take
[37:43] place somebody's amen
[37:48] hallelujah oh glory
[37:52] hallelujah
[37:54] hallelujah
[37:55] wherefore we receiving
[37:57] a kingdom that cannot be moved
[37:59] governments will move
[38:01] nations will move armies will move
[38:03] currencies will move sickness will move
[38:06] but the kingdom that we are receiving
[38:08] will not be moved your neighbors will
[38:11] move earthquakes will take place some
[38:13] tornadoes will take place up but if you
[38:15] are in that kingdom you don't need to
[38:17] worry about it no weapon formed against
[38:20] you could prosper because you are from a
[38:22] different kingdom you don't need a
[38:24] passport for this kingdom it's a
[38:26] heavenly kingdom you are citizen of that
[38:29] kingdom your dna is from that kingdom
[38:31] nobody can kick you out of that kingdom
[38:34] and by one spirit up you are baptized
[38:37] into that body by one spirit you are
[38:39] made a member of that kingdom can the
[38:42] church say amen
[38:46] glory hallelujah
[38:49] you may be seated
[38:52] and below it touching this last week and
[38:55] i want to touch it on on it briefly so
[38:57] that just we keep focused because the
[38:59] bible tells us in ephesians that we are
[39:01] predestinated
[39:02] onto being in the message for many years
[39:06] we are predestinated to come to church
[39:08] and just be like other people in the
[39:10] message
[39:11] no my bible tells me we are
[39:12] predestinated unto adoption
[39:16] [Music]
[39:19] and brother branham many times he gave
[39:21] the illustration and he talked about how
[39:23] you'd be born into a family
[39:26] but being born into the family the
[39:27] father can trust you with his business
[39:30] he can't trust you to run it because you
[39:32] don't know anything about running it not
[39:34] because your father is a businessman
[39:36] means you inherit the attributes of just
[39:38] being a businessman it has to be tested
[39:40] and proven that you could in fact do a
[39:42] good job
[39:43] in the natural and i said this on
[39:45] wednesday night in the natural many
[39:47] businessmen
[39:48] left businesses for their children and
[39:50] they spent 10 15 20 40 years to build it
[39:53] and in two years the children destroyed
[39:55] it
[39:56] because they didn't have the character
[39:58] for leadership they didn't go through
[40:00] the sacrifice and the pain that the
[40:02] father went through to build the
[40:04] business so god is not going to trust
[40:06] this great kingdom to any rascal any
[40:09] miserable any miscreant in discipline
[40:12] [Applause]
[40:15] so in the old testament when the son is
[40:17] born he was placed under the care of
[40:19] tutors and governors and their
[40:21] responsibility was to teach watch and
[40:24] monitor and to keep giving those report
[40:26] cards back to the father
[40:29] after the first term a plus after the
[40:31] second term a plus after the third term
[40:34] a plus and the father would look down
[40:36] and say i'm pleased that my boy is
[40:38] performing every single year in school
[40:40] he's doing well and eventually
[40:42] the father can say come and he brings
[40:45] him to the public and he gives him a
[40:47] robe and he gives him a ring and he says
[40:49] here he him his signature is just as
[40:51] good as my signature if he says you are
[40:54] hired you are hired if you said you are
[40:56] fired pack your backs as fast as
[40:58] possible because he has my name in him
[41:00] he has my authority in him no wonder god
[41:03] could tell peter whatever you buying on
[41:05] earth will be bound in heaven and
[41:07] whatever you loosen it will be loosed in
[41:10] heaven that was speaking of a people
[41:12] that will come into power that will be
[41:14] just like him that demon of sickness has
[41:17] got to go there's come at a time you
[41:19] won't even need the minister or the
[41:21] elder to lay hands there's gonna be
[41:23] power in you he will speak to your
[41:26] sickness he will speak to your family
[41:28] and you will see power move through you
[41:31] that's what's prophesied to you somebody
[41:33] save him
[41:34] [Applause]
[41:36] oh
[41:37] hallelujah
[41:38] hallelujah
[41:45] listen to what the prophet said in the
[41:46] message everlasting life
[41:49] and how to receive it
[41:50] is there anybody here wants to receive
[41:52] everlasting life
[41:54] i don't believe you came all this way to
[41:55] have church to just be a church member
[41:58] we are here because we want to have
[42:00] everlasting life alive beyond the river
[42:03] a life beyond this existence you know i
[42:05] shared with them in germany it was a
[42:07] youth oriented meeting and i said this
[42:09] is for the young people and
[42:11] those that through their walk with
[42:13] christ are getting younger every day
[42:16] hallelujah so i always rephrase but the
[42:18] kangaroo how i say these things about
[42:20] the young people and the caleb but now
[42:21] as a young people and those who by
[42:23] virtue of their walk with christ are
[42:25] getting younger every day my hair might
[42:27] be going but i'm getting younger i might
[42:29] be getting gray but i'm getting younger
[42:31] because i'm walking with christ and my
[42:33] destination is not the grave my
[42:35] destination is a resurrection my
[42:37] destination is the rapture and one of
[42:40] these days this body is going to be
[42:42] changed
[42:43] you may be seated i know it sounds crazy
[42:46] i know it sounds far-fetched but that's
[42:48] not my problem that's not your problem
[42:51] how is it going to happen he is going to
[42:52] work it out
[42:53] we don't need to know the mechanics but
[42:55] he is the dynamics and one of these days
[42:58] we shall be changed one of these days we
[43:01] shall be healed we just gotta say it
[43:04] speak it
[43:06] believe it plead for it declare it
[43:09] worship god because of it can the church
[43:12] say amen
[43:13] [Applause]
[43:15] hallelujah
[43:16] my i said indigo martin we have had
[43:18] enough of
[43:20] taking the milk bottles and eating the
[43:22] the the
[43:24] juba but anthony knows eating those
[43:28] gerbil food for babies and stuff it's
[43:29] time to get some strong meat people want
[43:32] to come to church and let's hear nice
[43:33] stuff but god is saying i'm going to put
[43:35] some fire on you because our god is a
[43:37] consuming fire and that fire is for a
[43:40] specific reason is to burn all the parts
[43:43] of you that's not supposed to be there
[43:45] off of you and i want god to burn me
[43:47] this morning you need to speak for
[43:48] yourself but i'm here this morning and
[43:50] i'm preaching to myself lord cut cut
[43:53] everything out of me that's not supposed
[43:55] to be here burn burn the world burn the
[43:58] ambition burn it out on me why so that
[44:01] that life of christ could be made
[44:03] visible somebody say man
[44:09] in the message everlasting life and how
[44:11] to receive it brother branham said now
[44:13] when the pentecostal church and these
[44:15] people in the last days here that's
[44:17] beginning to find a new birth being born
[44:19] again they thought
[44:20] listen they thought that settled it
[44:24] and that's a problem with many people
[44:25] the thing that come with the church it's
[44:27] settled being in the message it's
[44:29] settled believe in a thunder it's
[44:31] settled and brother branham said no sir
[44:34] because your ups and downs and ins and
[44:36] outs and things like that god can't
[44:38] place you as a son
[44:40] in other words right now you have your
[44:41] ups and downs one day on fire so much
[44:43] fire they can't even sit down put them
[44:45] with you sit down next to you
[44:48] yeah you're a all by yourself you
[44:49] just on fire
[44:51] and two sun is on the road you didn't
[44:53] you need to put somebody next to you who
[44:54] have fire
[44:57] because you had a hard week you had a
[44:59] rough time you had a bad dream you wake
[45:01] up on the wrong side of the bed your
[45:03] wrong foot on the bed your foot on your
[45:04] wrong shoes your shoes on your own
[45:10] but that up and down is temporary
[45:13] there's coming a time when you're gonna
[45:15] have a permanence of character
[45:17] where it's not a soul it's not you
[45:19] putting on your christian outfit let me
[45:21] put on the christian outfit today this
[45:23] is not that anymore but this is you
[45:24] living something all the time
[45:27] it's no longer an effort because it's a
[45:29] habit it's a way of life because it's
[45:31] not on the inside it's not a pretending
[45:33] a lot of people pretend
[45:35] they don't like you but how are you
[45:36] doing how are you doing i feel like a
[45:38] boy if you only need no one
[45:40] it's it's not real it's not real but you
[45:42] know there's some people who are genuine
[45:44] they just love everybody they're kind to
[45:46] everybody
[45:47] i want you to be real you know if you're
[45:48] a veteran everybody be sex with
[45:49] everybody
[45:53] because jesus told all your hypocrites
[45:54] you only love your people you only love
[45:56] your friend and you only love your
[45:57] friend and
[45:59] everybody can do that anybody can do
[46:00] that this is my circle but over the top
[46:02] of what it might click this in my group
[46:04] but be real
[46:06] and live this thing for real
[46:08] and that's why brother branham preaching
[46:10] the message the living realities of the
[46:13] living god the unfeeling realities of
[46:15] the living god we are looking for a
[46:16] reality
[46:17] not to be in church and you're
[46:18] struggling and struggling there has to
[46:20] come a time that the struggle must
[46:22] become easier because you're getting
[46:24] stronger because you're praying more and
[46:26] you're reading more and you're in the
[46:27] spirit more you can be past writing the
[46:30] same exam you're still in standard one
[46:31] you're still understanding the one
[46:32] you're still in standard one and you
[46:34] have form five form six degree until
[46:36] adoption
[46:39] every year you're supposed to say in
[46:40] last year was different this year the
[46:43] devil i'm coming for you last year i was
[46:45] running for him but they say i'm running
[46:46] towards him because why i know who i am
[46:49] i know where i come from i know where
[46:51] i'm going and i'm gonna give the devil a
[46:53] run for his money a run for his time he
[46:56] messed up lassie and took my prayer life
[46:58] but this year i'm taking it back i'm
[47:00] praying in the morning i'm praying in
[47:02] the noon time i'm praying in the evening
[47:04] [Applause]
[47:07] he may be seated
[47:08] you know that's what makes it a thunder
[47:10] that shakes the devil when you do what
[47:12] the devil don't expect because the devil
[47:14] thinks he has you figured out you know
[47:16] because he's looking at your resume this
[47:18] is where you were before this is where
[47:20] you were before this is where you were
[47:21] before but the devil god isn't going to
[47:23] resume me he is booking the flight based
[47:26] on where i'm going he is
[47:29] god is focused on your destination the
[47:31] devil is only focusing your past because
[47:33] he can't see your future
[47:36] the devil can only talk about what he
[47:37] did he can't talk about anything else
[47:38] but a kangaroo because he can't see your
[47:40] future but he is the author and the
[47:43] finisher he knows the end and he knows
[47:46] the beginning the devil doesn't know the
[47:48] end of your story and that's enough of a
[47:50] reason to shout to worship because
[47:58] oh
[47:59] hallelujah
[48:01] so we were reading here in the message
[48:02] everlasting life and how to receive it
[48:05] your ups and downs and ins and outs and
[48:07] things like that god can't place you as
[48:09] a son but listen carefully but when you
[48:12] stay in the kingdom
[48:14] stay in the gospel
[48:16] stay right one of these days god will
[48:19] call you out and set you aside adopt you
[48:23] as his son before the people and give
[48:26] you something that will shake the
[48:27] nations with it so this shaking that's
[48:30] coming you mean god's gonna use a people
[48:32] to do the shaking
[48:36] that's where i'm going this morning yes
[48:38] the bible said there's a shaking coming
[48:39] but god has an instrument for the
[48:41] shaking god has some weapons of mass
[48:43] destruction and that's why i pray this
[48:45] morning lord use me as your weapon
[48:47] against the works of darkness because
[48:49] abraham wished he could have been here
[48:51] david wished he could have been here but
[48:53] we are here and we have the
[48:54] responsibility to finish the war that
[48:57] started in heaven is going to end here
[48:59] on the earth because we shall reign on
[49:01] the earth
[49:03] can the church say amen
[49:08] from a message expectation but the men
[49:10] said i'm looking for something aren't
[49:11] you
[49:12] are you looking for something this
[49:14] morning but the of my soul is stimulated
[49:17] to the highest just before the coming of
[49:19] the lord jesus to see something happen
[49:22] that's going to shake the gentile world
[49:23] before god leaves it
[49:26] in the message of hidden life in christ
[49:28] he says no we don't have to get some
[49:30] kind of a makeup some kind of emotional
[49:33] or mental makeup we don't have to take
[49:36] something the devil would hand down but
[49:38] every believer that comes listen
[49:41] carefully friends and this is where many
[49:43] of us miss it
[49:44] every believer that comes from the altar
[49:49] to the consecrated life
[49:51] to the baptism of the holy ghost can get
[49:54] not only a mouthful but a soulful of the
[49:58] original baptism of the holy ghost that
[50:01] fell on the day of pentecost that'll
[50:03] bring the same results as it did on the
[50:05] day of pentecost so what are you looking
[50:07] for but isaac i'm looking for the same
[50:09] results that they had on the day of
[50:11] pentecost that god could take a bunch of
[50:13] men with no education with no schooling
[50:16] but they could have a certain kind of
[50:18] result and brother benjamin if the holy
[50:20] ghost comes upon you you're going to
[50:22] have the same results that they had
[50:24] [Applause]
[50:29] for the promise is unto you
[50:32] and to your children
[50:33] and to your children's children to them
[50:35] that are far off even as many as our
[50:38] lord our god shall call bridging the
[50:40] same holy spirit that fell on the day of
[50:43] pentecost that brought them results then
[50:46] will bring the same results to every
[50:49] believer tonight that's willing to
[50:52] consecrate their life to enter into the
[50:55] holiest of holies by the blood of the
[50:57] lord jesus can the church say amen he
[51:00] said it'll break down traditions it'll
[51:03] change men's hearts it'll melt you into
[51:06] one person in christ jesus sent an
[51:08] old-fashioned sweeping revival across
[51:11] this country amen what we need today we
[51:14] need an old-fashioned god sent heaven
[51:17] bought holy ghost brought revival not
[51:19] just a little bitty shaken up or a
[51:21] little emotional workout but an
[51:24] old-fashioned dying out
[51:26] self-consecrating hallelujah backwoods
[51:29] sky blue sin killing religion is that
[51:32] how you feel this morning but the
[51:34] branham said it won't whitewash you
[51:36] it'll wash you white the devil will
[51:39] whitewash everything that he can but god
[51:41] washes white and that's what we need
[51:43] today is an old-fashioned god-send
[51:46] revival that will just break down the
[51:48] hearts of the people and bring all these
[51:50] denominations into one great big unified
[51:53] group of the glory of god that's what
[51:55] the church needs today
[51:59] and but ibrahim is speaking there with a
[52:00] consecrated condition a consecrated life
[52:03] and i shared this in germany and i
[52:05] shared it in diego martin on wednesday
[52:07] everybody knows what a butterfly is
[52:10] and i want you to imagine if a butterfly
[52:12] were to land right
[52:14] on your hand
[52:16] and if a butterfly lands right on your
[52:18] hand
[52:19] and you want that butterfly to stay
[52:21] there
[52:22] you have to act a certain way
[52:25] because if you just move too quickly the
[52:26] butterfly is going to do what
[52:29] it's going to fly
[52:30] away and but the branham typed the holy
[52:33] ghost as a dove
[52:36] and he said we must be lambs
[52:38] we must be gentle
[52:39] so that the dove the holy spirit
[52:42] could rest on the lamb
[52:44] now i want you to listen carefully the
[52:46] holy spirit is a gentleman
[52:49] he's not going to force you to do
[52:51] anything
[52:52] he's not going to force you to come to
[52:53] church he's not going to force you to
[52:55] pay your tithes he's not going to force
[52:57] you to worship he's not going to force
[52:58] you to be on fire
[53:00] he's a gentleman
[53:02] and you have to conduct yourself a
[53:04] certain way for that dove
[53:07] to rest on your shoulder
[53:09] and to stay there
[53:11] because many times in our lives by the
[53:13] nights the dove would come but we do
[53:16] many things and the dove would fly away
[53:19] that's why the bible says grieve not the
[53:21] holy spirit
[53:23] that's don't offend the holy spirit so
[53:25] that dove he wants to not just be with
[53:27] you he wants to be in you
[53:29] but we have to be very careful how we
[53:31] live
[53:31] so now at home i tell my wife be careful
[53:34] we don't want the dove to fly away and
[53:36] it's powerful because if you live your
[53:38] life that way
[53:39] suddenly what you see begins to change
[53:43] who you spend time begins to chain
[53:45] because that dove can't go anywhere at
[53:48] once too that dove could only go to
[53:50] certain places so if that dove you want
[53:53] that dove to stay there with you then
[53:55] you have to speak to your wife
[53:57] a certain way
[53:58] speak to your children a certain way you
[54:01] have to do certain things because the
[54:03] moment you act
[54:06] that dove will fly away friends that's
[54:08] the consecrated life that god is looking
[54:12] for
[54:13] and if you practice that presence of god
[54:16] that's what real christianity is about
[54:18] and that's where brother branham talked
[54:19] about the thunder that shakes the
[54:21] devil's kingdom because it's easy for
[54:23] you to lose control and get upset and
[54:26] argue and debate
[54:28] but we want that dove that presence to
[54:31] be with us all the time remember the
[54:33] brandon was facing a bull he said a love
[54:35] came over him he said i wish i would
[54:38] have it all the time and if the prophet
[54:41] of god would be so just because he felt
[54:43] something.
[54:47] when you come to service
[54:49] the holy spirit the word comes in such a
[54:51] way to cut things off of your life
[54:54] and for many of us as the closest we get
[54:56] to a doubt because when we go to work
[54:57] and we go to school and we do this
[55:00] we quickly get out of spirit you get up
[55:02] in the morning and you go to work and
[55:04] you don't pray the dove can't dwell on
[55:06] that kind of person but if you wake up
[55:08] in the morning and you begin to worship
[55:10] and you're going to thank god and you
[55:11] welcome the holy spirit then the dove he
[55:13] just sweeps down and he rests there with
[55:15] a shame and when you walk at your house
[55:17] you see how great thou art and when the
[55:19] woman walk in the street you turn away
[55:21] your eye oh the top he loves that mind
[55:24] and when they're talking bad in the
[55:26] office and you turn away from them the
[55:28] dove he loves that he's having a good
[55:31] day because you are in the presence of
[55:33] god and when you turn in your jaw and
[55:35] you pray for your food or dove he loves
[55:38] that and and when there's a call for a
[55:40] prayer meet him and you can't wait to
[55:42] come to the prayer meet him oh the dove
[55:44] he loves that and when your brother
[55:46] calls you names and you say i forgive
[55:49] you oh
[55:50] the dove he loves that because if you
[55:53] speak back against your brother the dog
[55:55] is going to fly away
[55:58] you may be cheated
[56:01] oh
[56:03] that's a real message right there by the
[56:04] matthew to keep that dove
[56:07] resting on your shoulder when you among
[56:09] your co-workers that's the real gospel a
[56:11] lot of people know scriptures there no
[56:14] quotes they listen to tapes but the holy
[56:16] ghost is not with them
[56:19] it's an intellectual conception of the
[56:21] message but we are talking about the
[56:23] holy ghost moving from the presence of
[56:25] the holy ghost to the holy ghost on the
[56:27] inside and to that fate you're adding
[56:30] virtual knowledge so we're going back to
[56:32] basics this morning about getting our
[56:34] lives consecrated because the wesleyan
[56:37] church was so consecrated the holy ghost
[56:40] wanted to pour out on them and they
[56:42] didn't even know what to do with it
[56:46] because they were consecrated
[56:48] but we must be gentle
[56:50] like the lamb
[56:51] so that the dove would come
[56:54] gently like a lamb with your children
[56:57] going to keep saying it because it has
[56:58] to register because god is coming for a
[57:00] perfect church
[57:04] you think the dog is pleased when you're
[57:06] not in church
[57:09] but the brandon said you could go ahead
[57:10] and miss work but don't you miss church
[57:14] because everything that can be shaken
[57:15] will be shaken
[57:18] what are you gonna answer god well lord
[57:20] i miss the rapture because i was working
[57:22] overtime
[57:24] you have to make a choice of what's
[57:26] important because the dove he wants to
[57:28] deal with you but the brandon said god
[57:29] wants to fill you with the holy ghost
[57:31] more than you even want to receive it
[57:34] but so many things we do every day we
[57:35] just push the holy ghost away from us
[57:38] with the magazines that we read and what
[57:40] we watch on the internet
[57:43] and how we spend our time but i could
[57:45] guarantee you one thing when you get on
[57:47] your knees brother stephen and you begin
[57:49] to pray and you begin to call upon god a
[57:52] dove he draws narrow he draws narrow as
[57:55] you begin to cut off the things from the
[57:57] world he draws nearer and in every age
[58:00] there was a virtue for each age as you
[58:03] live the virtue for the age the dove he
[58:05] loves that and this age is the age of
[58:07] what is forgiveness to the dove he is
[58:10] looking for forgiveness
[58:15] and god will make you prove it and
[58:17] brother branham said the devil will make
[58:19] you prove it
[58:22] so every situation every test is to see
[58:25] forgive
[58:26] forgive and the more you forgive the
[58:28] more the dove comes and you know deeper
[58:31] than that jesus said how could the
[58:33] father even forgive you if you don't
[58:35] forgive
[58:38] because when you hold somebody else god
[58:40] is saying when i'm holding you until you
[58:41] let them go
[58:43] that's the real gospel that's the
[58:45] thunder that shakes the devil and that
[58:48] is what the devil is afraid of we can
[58:50] have a thousand people in here shouting
[58:52] and jumping and saying god send a
[58:53] prophet
[58:54] and people holding oats
[58:56] they're holding grudges they're playing
[58:58] around in shady places spending time
[59:01] with people who are pulling you away
[59:03] from god men spending time with women
[59:06] who are not their wives spending time
[59:08] inappropriately doing all kind of
[59:10] foolishness and you want the dove to go
[59:12] away
[59:14] oh yeah
[59:17] we don't need the signs on the outside
[59:19] we are speaking about the signs in the
[59:20] church to have that life that lived
[59:23] voice but the brandon said i have to
[59:25] quote i don't forget to read it not
[59:27] everybody is called to be a preacher but
[59:28] he said live your sermon
[59:31] that's the real message when you live
[59:33] the sermon anybody could speak it but
[59:35] when you live it it's a real testimony
[59:39] peter got home his wife didn't cook he
[59:41] didn't break up the pot and bust up the
[59:42] house no he went upstairs and praying
[59:44] god spoke to him the dog just swept in
[59:47] oh god give us husbands who want the
[59:49] dove to be on their shoulder give us
[59:51] wives who want the dove to be in their
[59:53] shoulder give us children who want the
[59:55] dove to be in his shoulder
[59:57] young men you think the dog will rest on
[59:59] you when you're wearing those short
[1:00:00] skirts you're trying to cut your hair
[1:00:02] and put your makeup on and your eyeliner
[1:00:04] and whatever it is
[1:00:06] the moment you even touch it flies away
[1:00:08] because he can't deal with that he's
[1:00:10] looking for a sanctified life looking
[1:00:13] for a holy life looking for a default
[1:00:15] life a life that separates from the
[1:00:17] world that's why he's a lamb
[1:00:20] brother branham types it too
[1:00:22] because the bulls and the goats and the
[1:00:24] other animals they do what they want but
[1:00:26] the lamb the lamb wants to be led the
[1:00:28] lamb wants to be protected by the
[1:00:29] shepherd can the church say man is this
[1:00:32] resonating with anybody so for this week
[1:00:35] starting from this service
[1:00:37] everybody should be talking about the
[1:00:39] dove
[1:00:41] if it's one thing you take from this
[1:00:43] service
[1:00:44] and i love because i was talking about a
[1:00:46] colon brain and he said it's so
[1:00:48] difficult
[1:00:50] to keep the dove
[1:00:55] it's not easy it is so difficult brother
[1:00:57] anthony
[1:00:58] to keep that dove
[1:01:00] it is so easy
[1:01:02] to snap at somebody
[1:01:04] it is so easy to be driving on the road
[1:01:06] and you just get out the spirit
[1:01:08] it is so difficult for the kangaroo to
[1:01:10] keep that dog but that's what god wants
[1:01:12] us to do
[1:01:13] to keep the dove with us all the time
[1:01:16] when you listen to worldly music the
[1:01:18] dove cannot stay with you
[1:01:20] can't
[1:01:21] you send the dove away friends keep the
[1:01:23] dove
[1:01:26] [Applause]
[1:01:27] [Music]
[1:01:33] [Applause]
[1:01:35] god's word is unbreakable
[1:01:37] god has no respect to a person
[1:01:39] when a wife disrespects her husband the
[1:01:41] dove just
[1:01:42] puts on turbo
[1:01:47] fought gear just just speed away
[1:01:52] the dove the holy spirit by the random
[1:01:54] said only backs up the scripture
[1:01:58] husband loves your wife love your wife
[1:02:01] when the husband doesn't show that love
[1:02:02] the dove he flies away
[1:02:05] children obey your parents
[1:02:07] the dove loves to see the scripture
[1:02:09] become a living reality in your life
[1:02:14] can the church say man
[1:02:16] i'm gonna mess with a hidden life in
[1:02:17] christ but ibrahim said the reason we're
[1:02:20] not getting anywhere today
[1:02:22] is because we got too many dry eyed
[1:02:25] professions
[1:02:26] and you know why but ibrahim said dry
[1:02:28] eyed because
[1:02:30] he types it as compared to when there's
[1:02:32] a certain sincerity of your soul
[1:02:34] and the tears stream down
[1:02:38] because it really resonates down on the
[1:02:40] inside and it's a reality to you you
[1:02:42] don't care about what anybody else is
[1:02:43] doing it's you and god
[1:02:46] but we got too many dry eyed professions
[1:02:48] and church joinings lukewarm backslidden
[1:02:51] church members that's the truth
[1:02:53] we need more of the old-fashioned
[1:02:55] god-sent saint paul's revival
[1:02:58] and the bible holy ghost with power and
[1:03:00] breaking up listen to make people act
[1:03:03] different
[1:03:04] and look different walk different talk
[1:03:08] different and be different and live
[1:03:10] different in their every day lives
[1:03:14] so the battle is not this church and
[1:03:16] come with the church on sunday it's what
[1:03:19] happens on monday and what happens on
[1:03:21] tuesday and what happens on wednesday
[1:03:23] and what happens on thursday because the
[1:03:25] tutor he's monitoring your behavior
[1:03:28] can the church say amen
[1:03:30] but the brethren said we needed friends
[1:03:32] the methodists needed the baptists in
[1:03:34] the dependent course they needed they
[1:03:35] all need it we all need it can the
[1:03:37] church say amen
[1:03:39] and that's what the holy ghost is given
[1:03:41] for
[1:03:42] but they brought him in the message what
[1:03:44] the holy ghost was given for he said
[1:03:46] it's to quit
[1:03:47] making you smoke
[1:03:49] and drink
[1:03:50] and one to be a big shot
[1:03:56] that's real you know
[1:03:59] want to be somebody
[1:04:00] it'll take that out of you
[1:04:03] it'll humble you when you do that
[1:04:05] that's what the holy ghost for listen
[1:04:08] it's for a holy life
[1:04:10] that's right make you quit gossiping
[1:04:14] make you quit playing cards
[1:04:16] shooting crafts and all these other
[1:04:18] things that you do around the corner
[1:04:20] it'll make you quit you're carrying on
[1:04:22] the way you're doing living untruth to
[1:04:24] your wife that's what it'll do that's
[1:04:27] right it'll quit making you want to
[1:04:29] marry somebody else's wife that's
[1:04:31] exactly right that's what it is it's to
[1:04:33] make you live a holy life that's what
[1:04:35] the holy ghost is powerful to set your
[1:04:38] affections on things above
[1:04:41] where god stands at the mind of christ
[1:04:44] in you
[1:04:45] you can't help from seeing those things
[1:04:47] when you look at them you tell in your
[1:04:48] head that's right it's to make you do
[1:04:51] that
[1:04:52] i remember the brand i'm saying and this
[1:04:54] to me is so powerful
[1:04:56] he said you say i can do it oh
[1:04:59] just i can do it sure you can't and i
[1:05:02] love that
[1:05:04] but everybody say you can do it
[1:05:06] you can't live this life
[1:05:08] but the holy spirit
[1:05:10] come for that purpose oh my god
[1:05:14] [Music]
[1:05:15] with ibraheem say your natural ability
[1:05:17] you can live this life but that's what
[1:05:20] the holy ghost comes for to give you
[1:05:22] power to live this holy life can the
[1:05:24] church say man
[1:05:26] [Music]
[1:05:29] holy ghost comes to burn the world out
[1:05:31] you burn your old nature
[1:05:34] some people go and meditate on the
[1:05:35] mountain for five years they'll talk to
[1:05:37] anybody and they believe they have the
[1:05:38] life in control see no evil hear no evil
[1:05:41] speak no evil but that nature is still
[1:05:43] there when they come up the mountain
[1:05:45] they start to deal with these same
[1:05:46] temptations back in the city when they
[1:05:48] come back because there's been no
[1:05:49] conversion no transformation no new
[1:05:52] birth no new experience because we all
[1:05:55] born in sin shaped in iniquity nobody
[1:05:58] better than anybody else but when you
[1:06:00] experience that new birth and you are
[1:06:02] born into the kingdom your affections
[1:06:04] begin to change listen you're not where
[1:06:06] you're supposed to be yet but you're not
[1:06:08] where you used to be but now you are
[1:06:09] born into the family no you can begin to
[1:06:11] add to your faith virtue knowledge
[1:06:14] temperance you rock a bit you move a bit
[1:06:17] but seven birds seven deaths and then
[1:06:19] charity comes down and seals the whole
[1:06:22] thing and then you are new creature you
[1:06:24] walk different you talk different you
[1:06:27] don't know where you get the strength
[1:06:28] from but all of a sudden you can testify
[1:06:30] like the prophet something came over me
[1:06:33] i don't know what it was but it's the
[1:06:35] holy ghost i don't know who started it
[1:06:37] but it's the holy ghost and fire and
[1:06:39] it's keeping me alive
[1:06:44] [Applause]
[1:06:46] to god
[1:06:48] friends
[1:06:49] god
[1:06:50] wants to get the glory
[1:06:52] and he wants to get the honor and he
[1:06:54] wants to get the praises so it cannot be
[1:06:57] your strength it cannot be your ability
[1:06:59] he said not by might nor by power but by
[1:07:03] my spirit sayeth the lord
[1:07:07] brother branham said if we are ever to
[1:07:08] see the power of god manifest it will be
[1:07:10] by the grace of almighty god it wouldn't
[1:07:13] even be our efforts all we have to do is
[1:07:16] be consecrated be sanctified and god
[1:07:19] will do the rest and that's what we are
[1:07:21] crying for lord clean up the church lord
[1:07:24] shake the church lord get our hearts in
[1:07:26] order lord we want to be gentle so that
[1:07:29] that dove that the holy spirit could
[1:07:32] rest upon my life and one day move on
[1:07:34] the inside and the pillar of fire could
[1:07:37] be filled on the inside that's how i
[1:07:39] want to be total surrender total
[1:07:42] surrender total surrender not part
[1:07:45] surrender but complete surrender lord i
[1:07:48] surrender everything surrender my eyes
[1:07:51] surrender my lips surrender my ears
[1:07:53] surrender my mind surrender my feet
[1:07:56] surrender my hands i don't want my hands
[1:07:58] to do what it wants i don't want my feet
[1:08:00] to do what it wants i don't want my mind
[1:08:02] to do what it wants i don't want to hear
[1:08:03] the wrong thing i don't want to say the
[1:08:05] wrong thing oh i surrender my emotions i
[1:08:08] surrender my pride i surrender it all up
[1:08:11] i give it up to you if i need to repent
[1:08:13] i repent if i need to forgive i forgive
[1:08:16] if i need to love i love but i want to
[1:08:18] be completely surrendered up so that
[1:08:20] that dove he could dwell with me all the
[1:08:23] time
[1:08:24] is that your prayer this morning is that
[1:08:26] your desire this morning is that your
[1:08:28] prayer this morning
[1:08:31] oh
[1:08:32] hallelujah
[1:08:33] oh glory glory glory glory glory glory
[1:08:37] so but the banner said you say i can do
[1:08:39] it oh i just can't do it sure you can't
[1:08:42] but the holy spirit come for that
[1:08:44] purpose that's why the devil fights the
[1:08:46] holy ghost so much because the holy
[1:08:48] ghost comes to give you power to
[1:08:50] overcome the holy ghost gives you power
[1:08:52] to live the life that you want to live
[1:08:54] deep down in the end time but you need
[1:08:56] something more than just your strength
[1:08:58] you need something more than your
[1:09:00] ability with your ability you're up one
[1:09:02] day your tongue one day you read one day
[1:09:04] you read the other day you pray one day
[1:09:06] but when the holy ghost comes up it's a
[1:09:08] different experience it's a reconnection
[1:09:11] it's a vertical connection it's you and
[1:09:13] god and no man bring the connection and
[1:09:16] no man could cut the connection because
[1:09:18] you are part of the body and like what
[1:09:20] the prince said when he preached here
[1:09:22] some weeks ago no matter what part of
[1:09:24] the body you are you are part of the
[1:09:26] body you could be weak but you are in
[1:09:28] the body wherever the body goes you are
[1:09:30] going to go to somebody say man can we
[1:09:33] give the lord a shout of praise
[1:09:36] [Applause]
[1:09:40] [Music]
[1:09:40] [Applause]
[1:09:42] [Music]
[1:09:42] [Applause]
[1:09:45] hallelujah
[1:09:47] this is not the kind of shot for joy
[1:09:48] master but it's a really sobering
[1:09:50] message
[1:09:51] hallelujah
[1:09:53] now
[1:09:54] when i on the phone i want to begin to
[1:09:55] talk to brothers and sisters
[1:09:57] are you keeping the dove
[1:09:59] are you keeping the dove
[1:10:01] do you have your dove
[1:10:02] i said to my wife the other day i say
[1:10:04] you can let your dove go i'm trying to
[1:10:06] keep mine off
[1:10:08] but it's a way of
[1:10:11] always now remembering
[1:10:13] that it's a walk with christ
[1:10:16] and that walk with christ is a walk
[1:10:18] that's on display
[1:10:20] in front of people
[1:10:23] because your neighbors are watching you
[1:10:25] your co-workers are watching you your
[1:10:28] family is watching you and that's why
[1:10:29] brother branham said it's so important
[1:10:31] to live your sermon
[1:10:33] because your life is preaching something
[1:10:37] i was doing a house education yesterday
[1:10:39] and i was saying that
[1:10:40] many times we pray for things and we
[1:10:42] look for things and god is waiting on us
[1:10:44] to get our lies in order to bring all
[1:10:46] the pieces back together we want to come
[1:10:48] back together and we try and struggle
[1:10:51] with our own abilities and all god is
[1:10:53] waiting for is to put him first
[1:10:57] put him in his place put him on the
[1:10:59] throne of our hearts put him in the
[1:11:01] control tower and say lord wherever you
[1:11:04] lead i'm going to follow
[1:11:06] and that's what this real walk is about
[1:11:08] that's what christianity is about total
[1:11:10] surrender
[1:11:11] you have your ambitions your dreams your
[1:11:13] goals but is it line up with what god
[1:11:16] wants for your life
[1:11:18] many of the desires we have that's just
[1:11:21] what they are our desires but he also
[1:11:24] has desires
[1:11:25] and you have to make sure that you are
[1:11:27] following his desires can the church say
[1:11:29] amen
[1:11:31] so friends are shaking is coming but i
[1:11:34] brought him in the message in his
[1:11:35] presence he said this is evangelism this
[1:11:38] is the time to shake people
[1:11:41] and that's what we're doing this morning
[1:11:42] with the kangaroo we are shaking the
[1:11:43] people this is the time that god said it
[1:11:46] come a time he shook mount sinai one
[1:11:48] time but it come shaking again
[1:11:52] he checked everything that could be
[1:11:54] moved but we receive a kingdom that
[1:11:57] cannot be moved
[1:11:59] everything that can be shook will be
[1:12:00] shaken the heavens will shake the earth
[1:12:03] will shake heaven and earth will pass
[1:12:04] away but that word will never pass away
[1:12:08] for upon this rock i'll build my church
[1:12:10] and the gates of hell will never prevail
[1:12:13] against it can the church say amen
[1:12:17] so all through the old testament
[1:12:20] shakens came and
[1:12:22] shakens came and go and throw out all
[1:12:24] the time and now in the message
[1:12:26] revelation chapter four
[1:12:28] but the brand i'm saying this is the
[1:12:29] quote i got it from i just want to make
[1:12:30] sure you hear it now everybody can't be
[1:12:33] a preacher but you got a voice
[1:12:35] and if you can preach the people a
[1:12:37] sermon if you're a preacher you're
[1:12:39] called to the pulpit to preach if you're
[1:12:41] not you're still a preacher but live the
[1:12:43] people assuming
[1:12:45] let your sermon be lived and it's the
[1:12:47] voice of god that will bring reproach to
[1:12:50] them who reject it
[1:12:51] they see no one can put a finger on his
[1:12:53] or her life their sweet living if there
[1:12:56] ever was a man of god it's that man or
[1:12:58] that woman see live your sermons don't
[1:13:01] try to preach them if you're not called
[1:13:03] to be a preacher get all mixed up anyhow
[1:13:06] and messed up and you'll get people
[1:13:08] tangled up and you won't know well
[1:13:10] you'll ruin them and you'll sell to just
[1:13:12] live your sermon
[1:13:14] the preachers call to preach his and to
[1:13:16] live it too if you can't live it then
[1:13:18] stop preaching it but you're supposed to
[1:13:20] live your sermons
[1:13:22] all right here was voices oh this is a
[1:13:25] quote here how we need in jeffersonville
[1:13:28] thousands of live voices the thunder of
[1:13:31] god thundering out in sweetness and
[1:13:33] holiness purity undefiled lives walking
[1:13:36] around in the earth today without a
[1:13:38] blemish yes sir real christians that's
[1:13:42] thunder against the enemy the devil
[1:13:44] don't care how loud you can holler the
[1:13:46] devil don't care how much he can jump
[1:13:48] how much he can do this or shout but
[1:13:50] what's hurts the devil is to see that
[1:13:53] sanctified holy life consecrated to god
[1:13:57] say anything to him call him anything
[1:13:59] just as sweet as it can be and move
[1:14:02] right on oh my that throws him away
[1:14:04] that's the thunder that shakes the devil
[1:14:06] can the church say amen
[1:14:08] [Applause]
[1:14:15] friends the devil has a response for
[1:14:17] scripture
[1:14:19] but the brandon said the devil knows the
[1:14:20] scripture
[1:14:21] better than better than we do
[1:14:23] know the scripture he's been around for
[1:14:25] a long time
[1:14:26] so when you argue scripture with the
[1:14:27] devil the devil could allow you
[1:14:28] scripture back the devil has a response
[1:14:30] to the quotes but you see the devil has
[1:14:32] no response to the life
[1:14:35] because he can't live this life but we
[1:14:37] could live this life the devil has no
[1:14:40] answer when you present the life when
[1:14:43] all the world expects you to hold the
[1:14:45] order and you drop it the devil has no
[1:14:46] response he can't deal with that that's
[1:14:49] the thunder that shakes the devil
[1:14:56] when people do you wrong and you can let
[1:14:58] it go that's you presenting the life of
[1:15:01] christ
[1:15:02] [Applause]
[1:15:04] could you imagine jesus didn't do
[1:15:05] anybody anything but they spit on him
[1:15:08] they mocked him
[1:15:09] they laughed at him they beat him they
[1:15:12] say you call yourself a king
[1:15:14] and jesus did what he didn't answer them
[1:15:17] a word
[1:15:19] he didn't argue with them he didn't say
[1:15:21] hey
[1:15:22] it wasn't me i didn't do it no
[1:15:24] because he was standing in the gap for
[1:15:26] us
[1:15:27] that we could have that opportunity this
[1:15:29] morning so we are here on this earth to
[1:15:32] shake the devil
[1:15:34] before the final knockout punch
[1:15:36] and your life your testimony is already
[1:15:38] shaking the devil
[1:15:40] even before you have the fullness of the
[1:15:42] life you are already shaking the devil
[1:15:44] because when you're supposed to be
[1:15:45] backslidden you are here this morning
[1:15:48] and the devil is already shaken that's a
[1:15:50] thunder that's already shaking the devil
[1:15:52] you're supposed to be sad but you're
[1:15:54] shaking the devil this morning because
[1:15:55] there's still a smile on your face
[1:15:57] you're supposed to be dead defeated
[1:15:59] depressed but you are here in the house
[1:16:00] of god that's already shaking the devil

[1:16:07] devil and satan is mad but i'm so glad

[1:17:42] uttering out in sweetness and humility
[1:17:46] and forgiveness can the church say amen
[1:17:48] [Applause]
[1:17:51] [Music]
[1:17:53] oh hallelujah could you take some more
[1:17:55] this morning
[1:17:56] i'm almost finished but i feel we have a
[1:17:58] good audience this morning we came to
[1:18:00] church to fellowship around the world so
[1:18:02] we are fellowshipping around the world
[1:18:04] this morning all week you fellowship
[1:18:06] with your co-workers and your family and
[1:18:08] the news and ian allen and you
[1:18:10] fellowship with all these people but now
[1:18:12] we let's talk about jesus this morning
[1:18:14] the prince of peace the lord of lords
[1:18:16] but the brandon said when we talk about
[1:18:18] him he comes nearer he comes close up he
[1:18:21] loves when we talk about him let's talk
[1:18:24] about jesus oh the king of kings is he
[1:18:28] the lord of lord supreme
[1:18:30] [Applause]
[1:18:36] i hope you got time
[1:18:37] [Music]
[1:18:41] from the message the world is falling
[1:18:43] apart
[1:18:46] and by the brandon preachers in 1963 and
[1:18:49] look at the world today
[1:18:51] woodson has ever been
[1:18:53] murders crime killings but
[1:18:57] that's that's one thing
[1:19:00] but when you look at the young people
[1:19:02] and
[1:19:03] what's happening and
[1:19:05] stuff that you've never seen before in
[1:19:07] our day it was here before because the
[1:19:08] same spirit
[1:19:10] sodom is only the same spurs because
[1:19:12] brother brad i'm talking those spirits
[1:19:13] don't die
[1:19:14] but they wait for some vessels that open
[1:19:16] themselves up
[1:19:18] and now they have found these vessels
[1:19:20] and but the branham said many years ago
[1:19:22] he said
[1:19:23] when he used to blast the movies and the
[1:19:25] picture shows he said now the devil did
[1:19:27] a number and brought it into the house
[1:19:28] and the devil is looking for any weak
[1:19:30] spot
[1:19:32] and you have to fortify yourself as a
[1:19:34] christian with where your weak spot is
[1:19:36] but everybody said the devil is going to
[1:19:38] try to punch you in that weak spot he
[1:19:40] owes us everyone a punch
[1:19:42] so don't think you want to escape
[1:19:45] every single christian is going to have
[1:19:46] a punch coming to you and it's not going
[1:19:48] to come at your strong point
[1:19:50] he's going to look for the weak point
[1:19:53] and he's going to give you a good punch
[1:19:56] and you know what you're going to have
[1:19:57] to do you're going to have to close up
[1:19:59] all the weak points
[1:20:00] because when you put on the arm of the
[1:20:02] god full arm of god then no more weak
[1:20:04] points
[1:20:05] so he's going to probe and press and try
[1:20:08] but what is it it's you getting ready
[1:20:10] until one day he's going to say you know
[1:20:11] what i give up on you because you are
[1:20:13] you are already sealed away until a day
[1:20:15] your redemption he can't mess with you
[1:20:16] no more can the church say amen after
[1:20:19] jesus met the devil in the wilderness
[1:20:21] the devil went away for a season
[1:20:24] it was like time emotional
[1:20:26] he had no idea listen vicky i don't know
[1:20:28] who approved his vacation he took a
[1:20:29] vacation
[1:20:31] jesus said it is written it is written
[1:20:33] it is also written and jesus defeated
[1:20:35] the devil without power
[1:20:37] with just the word that's how powerful
[1:20:39] the word itself is
[1:20:41] it is written it is written is also and
[1:20:43] the devil went away for a season
[1:20:45] but the brandon said electric volts went
[1:20:47] to the devil and he's still recovering
[1:20:48] from that
[1:20:50] [Applause]
[1:20:52] can the church say amen what about us
[1:20:55] you may not have the holy ghost yet but
[1:20:57] you have the word don't you
[1:21:01] oh
[1:21:02] my my my my and the word will defeat the
[1:21:05] devil anytime any place under any
[1:21:09] condition
[1:21:11] so i'm not going to be too much longer
[1:21:12] with you
[1:21:13] but the brandon said friends we are not
[1:21:15] promised a system in the message the
[1:21:16] world is falling apart
[1:21:18] jesus wouldn't have nothing to do with a
[1:21:20] system we wasn't promised a system
[1:21:22] we will promise a kingdom
[1:21:24] and how do you get into it by one spirit
[1:21:27] we are all baptized into this kingdom is
[1:21:30] the kingdom of god a kingdom of eternal
[1:21:33] life with an eternal king giving forth
[1:21:36] his eternal word with an eternal people
[1:21:39] predestinated to eternal life he is the
[1:21:42] king we are baptized into it setting in
[1:21:44] heavenly glory we are dead our lives are
[1:21:47] hidden god through christ not only that
[1:21:49] but we are raised with him raise up what
[1:21:51] in a system a denomination organization
[1:21:54] no we are resurrected in the kingdom of
[1:21:56] god the kingdom of god is within you all
[1:21:59] these man-made systems must fall not
[1:22:02] once more i'll shake the world but i'll
[1:22:04] shake heaven also and those things that
[1:22:06] cannot be shook is what will remain and
[1:22:09] we receive a kingdom a kingdom that
[1:22:11] cannot be shook or moved that's the
[1:22:14] kingdom of god not a system not a
[1:22:16] political will not a denomination but a
[1:22:19] kingdom can the church say amen

[1:26:18] for years people heard him he was like
[1:26:20] an entertainment he was like a show
[1:26:23] people would come to hear this man but
[1:26:24] you know what was about noah noah wasn't
[1:26:27] just preaching he was living his sermon
[1:26:29] because while he was preaching he was
[1:26:31] building the arkham and that was a
[1:26:33] thunder it was shaking the devil the
[1:26:35] devil didn't know what to expect noah
[1:26:37] wasn't just talking about it when noah
[1:26:39] say repent he was building and today we
[1:26:42] say repent and we are building because
[1:26:45] we are leaving this place up we are
[1:26:47] getting out of here noah in his day he
[1:26:50] could say the rain is coming we in our
[1:26:52] day can see the shaking is coming the
[1:26:55] fire is coming this world is going to be
[1:26:57] destroyed heaven is going to be changed
[1:27:00] can the church say man
[1:27:03] oh
[1:27:04] hallelujah heaven and earth will pass
[1:27:06] away i don't know if i'm going to get it
[1:27:08] but in the future home of the heavenly
[1:27:10] bridegroom and the earthly pride but
[1:27:13] apron said heaven and earth will pass
[1:27:14] away he said that past doesn't mean
[1:27:16] annihilated but the georgia doesn't mean
[1:27:18] destroyed he said that past means change
[1:27:21] it means from one form to another
[1:27:23] because this heaven and this earth it
[1:27:25] got corrupted because of the god of this
[1:27:28] evil age back in eden the devil came
[1:27:31] into god's kingdom
[1:27:32] and he caused a shake in god's kingdom
[1:27:34] he interrupted the order that god had
[1:27:37] set up and eden shook her something went
[1:27:40] out of order there was chaos in god's
[1:27:43] eden and god fouled from that day i'm
[1:27:45] gonna restore everything that was lost
[1:27:48] up man was supposed to have dominion man
[1:27:50] was supposed to have power you're not
[1:27:52] supposed to be sick you're not supposed
[1:27:54] to be depressed you're not supposed to
[1:27:56] have questions because you are supposed
[1:27:58] to be the answer you were supposed to
[1:27:59] have power but man fell and the devil
[1:28:02] came and shook the kingdom that god
[1:28:04] built but god said i'm going to raise up
[1:28:07] people through every age that will shake
[1:28:09] every age up to bring back to bring back
[1:28:12] order in the church to bring order back
[1:28:14] into the world can the church say amen
[1:28:18] oh
[1:28:19] you may be seated so in every age god
[1:28:21] had a voice because he said the voice of
[1:28:24] god is a thunder so in every age god had
[1:28:26] a thunder in every age he had a voice he
[1:28:29] had somebody who would speak but during
[1:28:31] the old testament they could only speak
[1:28:34] because they had blood of bulls and
[1:28:36] goats so their words were word of god
[1:28:39] but they were still speaking of somebody
[1:28:40] to come they were speaking of that great
[1:28:43] thunder to come they were speaking of
[1:28:44] that great voice to come oh you don't
[1:28:46] hear me this morning so abraham spoke
[1:28:49] and david spoke ezekiel spoke and isaiah
[1:28:53] spoke that a virgin would conceive and
[1:28:55] there was a thunder that went out that
[1:28:58] shook the devil the devil tried to
[1:29:00] understand it but it didn't make sense
[1:29:02] to him how a virgin could conceive but
[1:29:04] that's how god is it was a thunder that
[1:29:07] went out to shake the devil's kingdom
[1:29:09] and 400 years had to pass but one day
[1:29:13] that thunder that word became flesh and
[1:29:17] jesus he came and walked up and he was a
[1:29:19] living reality of the word that was
[1:29:21] spoken and his life was a thunder where
[1:29:24] he went he didn't have to speak up but
[1:29:26] the sick was healed and the blind saw oh
[1:29:30] you don't hear me this morning that's
[1:29:32] the kind of gospel
[1:29:36] hallelujah
[1:29:38] hallelujah i'm finished with the
[1:29:40] introduction i'm finished with the
[1:29:42] foundation now let's preach you may be
[1:29:44] seated so god
[1:29:47] in the beginning he said let there be
[1:29:49] the most powerful attribute of god is
[1:29:52] when that voice moves
[1:29:55] adam was in the eden he said i heard the
[1:29:57] voice of god
[1:29:58] walking in the garden that voice had a
[1:30:01] feet that voice had hands that voice had
[1:30:04] a party and in this age the voice of god
[1:30:07] will have feat his voice will have hands
[1:30:10] his voice will have a body that body
[1:30:12] will beat his pride buddy oh you don't
[1:30:14] hear me this morning and once more this
[1:30:17] voice will speak lazarus i know you're
[1:30:20] dead but comfortable it'll be the voice
[1:30:22] of the archangel fill in the pride
[1:30:25] [Applause]
[1:30:28] oh hallelujah
[1:30:30] hallelujah you may be seated so paul in
[1:30:34] his age he was a thunder
[1:30:36] a thunder in his age he shook his age
[1:30:40] his age trembled even peter trembled
[1:30:43] because paul was just different paul
[1:30:45] wasn't from their church paul wasn't
[1:30:47] from their group paul wasn't there when
[1:30:49] jesus was there paul didn't hear jesus
[1:30:52] himself but he had the voice of god and
[1:30:54] when paul spoke the dispensation changed
[1:30:58] from the jews to the gentiles and god
[1:31:00] unlocked something secret because there
[1:31:02] were some people in 2015 who had to come
[1:31:06] forth and god had to make a turn to pull
[1:31:09] up the gentiles and paul irenaeus martin
[1:31:13] columba luther wesley each age had its
[1:31:17] thunder each age had his voice each age
[1:31:20] had his virtue but now
[1:31:24] but now
[1:31:25] we have every thunder we have every
[1:31:28] voice every virtue has been restored by
[1:31:31] that malachi 4 elijah prophet
[1:31:34] [Applause]
[1:31:38] oh
[1:31:39] you don't hear me this morning
[1:31:41] you don't hear me this morning in paul's
[1:31:44] age he said death where's your grave
[1:31:46] where's your victory death where's your
[1:31:48] sting he said listen
[1:31:51] because the mighty conqueror had passed
[1:31:54] the devil was trembling paul spoke and
[1:31:57] challenged it
[1:31:59] challenged the grave but he still had to
[1:32:02] go down
[1:32:03] because he didn't have what it took to
[1:32:05] give the final knockout punch he could
[1:32:07] have shook the devil but there was a
[1:32:09] rail shaking that could have only
[1:32:11] happened in 2015
[1:32:13] the first church real trouble the devil
[1:32:16] but there was a church that was to come
[1:32:18] that was to finish the devil there's a
[1:32:20] difference between a problem and there's
[1:32:22] a difference with being a solution
[1:32:27] oh hallelujah
[1:32:29] you may be seated so the devil had
[1:32:31] trouble in the first church age he had
[1:32:33] trouble in the second childhood he had
[1:32:36] trouble in the third fourth fifth
[1:32:38] sixties
[1:32:40] and in the darkest age
[1:32:42] in the age where the prophet said the
[1:32:44] moon till into darkness as a sign of no
[1:32:47] light in the evening time day in 1964
[1:32:50] there was a super blood moon and the
[1:32:52] world was dark but he prophesied in the
[1:32:55] evening time there's going to be light
[1:32:58] in the evening time there'll be a people
[1:33:02] who will come to escape the devil the
[1:33:04] final shake and shake him out of the
[1:33:06] earth shake him out of this heaven shake
[1:33:09] him because we shall reign on the earth
[1:33:11] the devil has no right he has no power
[1:33:14] he has no authority the authority is in
[1:33:17] the church of the living god somebody
[1:33:19] say man

[1:41:46] [Music]
[1:41:51] oh let me read some encourage your
[1:41:52] friends
[1:41:54] from the message future home of the
[1:41:56] heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[1:41:57] bride
[1:41:59] but abraham said heavens and earth will
[1:42:01] pass away
[1:42:03] many of us do that scripture
[1:42:05] but brother branham brings to light what
[1:42:07] it means
[1:42:08] he said now this word
[1:42:10] means passing from one form to another
[1:42:14] it doesn't mean annihilation as the
[1:42:16] english word would mean pass away it's
[1:42:18] annihilated but the hebrew word or the
[1:42:20] greek here doesn't mean pass away it
[1:42:22] means passing
[1:42:23] from one thing
[1:42:25] to another
[1:42:26] to pass from one condition
[1:42:29] oh god to another
[1:42:32] and that's my prayer this morning to
[1:42:33] move from the condition that i'm into
[1:42:35] another condition
[1:42:38] the state that i'm into another state
[1:42:40] the walk that i meant to another walk
[1:42:43] the talk that i meant to another talk
[1:42:45] the life amen to another life
[1:42:46] [Music]
[1:42:48] brother went on now notice paul used it
[1:42:51] if you want to read it now put it now
[1:42:52] you can read it later in titus
[1:42:54] paul is using the same word means
[1:42:56] regeneration of man that man has passed
[1:43:00] from a sinner to a saint
[1:43:02] not completely annihilated
[1:43:04] when a man is changed he isn't
[1:43:06] annihilated but he's a changed person
[1:43:09] he has been changed from what he was to
[1:43:11] what he is not annihilated
[1:43:14] oh anybody with me this morning
[1:43:17] brother branham said jesus used the same
[1:43:18] word in matthew 19 28.
[1:43:22] he said to them you'll set with me in my
[1:43:24] father's kingdom regenerate it you see
[1:43:26] change
[1:43:27] when you change use the same word he use
[1:43:29] the same word when he said to the court
[1:43:31] lose the court and let him go
[1:43:33] said the same thing at the resurrection
[1:43:35] of lazarus he said lose him listen
[1:43:38] carefully to the prophet lose him
[1:43:40] change him
[1:43:42] he's been tied
[1:43:44] let him go
[1:43:45] what does it mean the earth will be
[1:43:47] loosed from the grip of satan
[1:43:50] oh god help me this morning it will be
[1:43:53] loosed
[1:43:54] it'll be loose from politics it'll be
[1:43:56] loose from the nominational religious
[1:43:58] system to be used for the kingdom of god
[1:44:01] to be established here on the earth
[1:44:06] but the random now he's under the
[1:44:08] anointing he's speaking he said one time
[1:44:10] i was his property talking about the
[1:44:12] devil but not now
[1:44:16] one time that little woman talking to
[1:44:18] somebody in church was his property but
[1:44:20] not now see he come to loose the grip of
[1:44:22] it he'll lose the grip of sin of satan
[1:44:25] upon my life
[1:44:27] upon your life now we are not his
[1:44:30] how you often heard me say in prayer
[1:44:32] take your hands off of god's property
[1:44:35] see
[1:44:36] have faith to claim your own that's
[1:44:38] right take your hands off of him take
[1:44:40] your hands off of him this earth will
[1:44:43] change politics will change religions
[1:44:45] will change the kingdom of god shall be
[1:44:48] established can the church say man

[1:44:58] man in stature
[1:45:00] that you was when god called you the
[1:45:02] same woman but you see what it did it
[1:45:04] was a regeneration the whole life passed
[1:45:06] away the old desires has passed away
[1:45:10] when you used to like to drink and cuss
[1:45:12] and fuss and stew and run around and
