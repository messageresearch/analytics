strike the church you promise the church [Music] glory to God hallelujah [Music] praise God before you take a seat I just want to turn your Bibles to send John chapter 7. we just want two scriptures two verses yesterday 17-39 Acts chapter 1 2 verses there four and five and John chapter 22 verses here 21 and 22. and don't try to figure out why just two verses just going to work with that today readings in John Chapter 7 and this is verse 37. welcome this morning God bless you and thanks for coming out in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus student Christ saying if any man tooth let him come unto me and drink oh this is three simple he that believeth on me was 38 as the scripture had said out of his belly shall flow Rivers already in water this is how it come out of his mouth right but vistina explains what that is but this speak he of the spirit which didn't believe on him should receive so this spirit is for believers this big he of the spirit which did not believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because the Jesus was not yet glorified acts 1 4 and 5. I'm being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which said he you have heard of me for John truly baptized with water but he shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many of these hence and our last crypto reading in Psalms in John chapter 20 verse 21. this is Jesus resurrection Ministry then said Jesus unto them again peace be unto you as my father sent me even souls and thy you and then he had said and when he had said this he breathed on them and said unto them receiving the Holy Ghost father God may you bless your word and confirm it in Jesus I ask it amen you may be seated o praise God praise God praise God I trust them that if you didn't wasn't live on the prayer meeting that you would listen it on YouTube and hear about building that altar Noah built an altar Joshua better alter Moses built to alter Abraham Builder altar every one of them built the altar our altar must be built there's not any anything I built altar a place a place that appeared where you could offer up your Praises or for your Thanksgiving or for up your worship make your petition unto God at the altar of God Amen praise God and when when Elijah gave the challenge about let the God be answered by fire be God he didn't just do anything and just start up and say Lord send your fire loss and if I have no he built the altar he restore the altar as the first thing he did to restore the altar because the altar is our connection and the prophet said the altar by unto the altar so we get back to Eden you cannot get back unless they come to the altar that is where Adam that's where Abel and King brought the offering and that's where God accepted Abel's sacrifice because Abel brought it by Revelation not by his senses and intellect but by Revelation because something in Abel told him it will take blood to reconnect us to Heaven's Door if we take blood to get us a SIM card to call back Heaven it will take blood to reconnect us to our father Oh Glory to God because sin had to be dealt with this holy righteous just God couldn't stand sin any form of sin minor sin major sin small Sin itty-bitty Sin he couldn't stand it whatsoever his law required Justice his law required judgment his law required a price had to be paid and in the Old Testament it was the blood of goats it was a blood of bulls that foreign peace offering this offering because God had to judge the whole earth because he knew he himself had to come even the blood of Jesus the perfect lamb and the Bible said this man when he offered his blood once Oh Glory that God has perfected forever them that are Sanctified his blood is why we are here his blood give us the opportunity to access presence it's not your works it's not your confession of what you believe or give the Lord some Praises is what he has done that's why the word said not by might not by power but by my spirit Oh Glory oh God hope this mountain in your life how is that going to be moved Oh Glory to God Hallelujah glory to God thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah hallelujah Oh Glory let me say it again how is it that mountain in your life going to be

morning you know but you know I come still because I don't people feel a backslide stay home I never find you the whole you know I can't hold you know all I can tell you never waiting out there for anybody who someone has slept he's looking for tricks he looking for traps he's looking at everything yeah if you think they're not interested he's interested in you he's shooting out there you know

cricket but that song is Brokenness Brokenness is what I long for Brokenness is what I need Brokenness Brokenness is what he wants from me Hallelujah Hallelujah so you build that altar Bullet in Your Heart amen so this is more of a title identified with the same kind of group this morning this is the prophet prayer our heavenly father we are preaching thy children of Grace we would not want to come by the Throne of Justice for we could not stand there we could not come by the Throne of judgment we could not stand there justly we would be condemned because we are of the world Adam's phone race but we are coming by The Throne of Mercy and Jesus when he was on Earth said if you'll ask the father everything in my name it'll be granted and I am asking now first Lord pardoning of all our transgression against thy Commandments forgive us Lord everyone we pray for Minister Brothers for the congregations for the sins of the city and of the nation of people everywhere God I pray for my own sins and we know that sin originally is unbelief he that believeth not has come them already and it's unbelief that causes us to commit the immoral crimes that we do and if we only believe we would not do those things so I pray father that you'll forgive our unbelief and will come to each of us tonight and bestow upon us the feet that will answer the request that we have below our hands granted Lord in our heart we come here by feeding lead of your spirit Satan Warren against to try to keep us from coming but that is why I believe the much more that there is something in store for us and we are pressing the battle tonight and you have opened the way no father may we all catch the vision and remember what we have asked and they are pressed forward with our petition and I'm laying mine upon the altar of sacrifice tonight my prayer my faith all upon your call and altar where our sacrifice Christ lives with the prayer and the requests of these people and together we ask for a great outpouring of your Spirit Lord to do exceedingly abundantly above all we could do or think may it be ported upon this meeting Lord and when it is over May there be an old-fashioned Revival break out throughout the country here and the churches all be on fire for God Souls being saved people being healed and the glory brought to the kingdom of God over this prayer with all these others laying here upon your bull and altar we ask over them in the name of Jesus and you will answer us according to thy great Mercy amen okay the Lord some praises glory to God what a prayer oh he wasn't just praying for his church or Tabernacle he prayed for all the churches that the fire of God would break out that God will pour on his holy spirit the golden oil not Portmore Mysteries not Portmore Revelation not Portmore understanding we have 50 plus years of that okay the Lord a shout is time in your heart after peace for something more he said If any man test let him come to me and drink oh he that delivered on me as the scripture had said out of his belly out of your belly shall flow rivers of Living Water or give the Lord some Praises that's your promise tonight that's your promise today I don't care what problems in life I look at what you have lost I became what happened in your home this is your personal promise of Living Water and everlasting fountain in your soul Oh Glory to God a spring of water inside of you this is the Holy Ghost that is promise so give the Lord some Praises I'm looking for Revival this morning I'm looking for an old porn this morning I the same prayer the prophet prayer we are praying that God will pour out his spirit this morning [Applause] Glory Glory Hallelujah may be seated and no church could hold the Holy Ghost so when somebody said holy ghost is a lie he said no church can hold it the church can hold brotherly love but only individuals could hold the Holy Ghost so this Holy Ghost Bunch or nothing like that there's going to be a holy ghost Bunch that bunch of Holy Ghost people gonna be individuals but the fire in them you ain't coming over fire you bring your fire with you when the Holy Ghost hit you oh give the Lord a shout when the Holy Ghost hit you you bring the fire with you oh Glory alright mentally Oh Glory the court Hallelujah I like all that song when the Holy Ghost hit you you will bring it with you or can they lost some praises here praise God praise God Hallelujah [Applause] that's all that you're supposed to be our Glory I shout A Hallelujah not somebody better not write their notes after the service write all you know what you want but when you come here you just give God praise lift your hands Stand Up Oh Glory the god responded Holy Ghost move by the spirit move by the anointing [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right let me see it every great achievement is tied to an absolute I ain't talking about you're making it yeah every great achievement is tight and absolute you cannot run life without having an absolute you can't make an achievement without it being an absolute for is the final typos it's a place where you are tied to something in the day we are living alone everything is breaking up so fragile I think that this message would be very appropriate thing especially to Christians when they're going through deep Waters now the Christian church is passing through the deepest what it had for the last two thousand years because we are coming to a spot to where there is something presented to Christianity something they have to make a decision on and I think that the Christian Church ought to have something that they know that their title instead of floating like a leaf upon the Water like up on the Wind as the Bible said carried about with every wind of Doctrine the winds Come Blow This leave this way another wind comes not when South went East when West Wind you'll never get anywhere you are not stabled the Christian Life should be a stable life no no complete and no mother and no father your same day forever you know you know what my father wasn't there you know my mother wasn't there no my grandmother wasn't there but Jesus there early and they still come up good men and good woman like no excuse people making excuse me Uncle remand women neighbor cut the crap out God called you your life begins with the call or can the Lord has Shout Give the Lord a shout no excuses [Music] my father died since 1981 I must blame him for what he'll leave a appearance shoes I have nobody to blame I am responsible for myself I'm responsible for my decision I'm responsible for my action I'm responsible for my conviction and I'm responsible to chase that devil out he said in my name you're gonna cast out devils not no negotiations okay the Lord some Praises do I have shout in the house no negotiations [Applause] you have to come to that place of conviction where what is wrong is wrong throw it out you're gonna affect your life listen if a pilot's supposed to go five degrees this way and they go six degrees just one degree over time he landed in a different place all together you know over time so you drift a little bit over time and guess what your family going so too you know I hear you if it's you by yourself is you alone but when you have a family where your father grandfather whoever it is you have to understand what you do affect them may be seated the father he grapes and the children's teaches on edge they're dead and gone and the effect of their lives till effect and affect the children under him Glory Hallelujah you must have something your title some people are tied to their business some people are tied to their families they can nothing but nobody else no burden nothing at all they tied to their families some type their Creed the lady Doctrine we can't Fellowship because we believe something different that the Bible like foolishness that you've been executive modern day Pharisee if you put you back in Jesus day you're wearing them every tall hearts and nice gongs hypocrites and Jesus blasted them he said want you Hypocrites outside you look so nice but inside the Dead Man's Bones you like see Falcons you like them Tombstone outside the pain you're right with nice letters and so on but there's bones are inside of there blast them why don't you Skype and Pharisees hypocrites your stream at a net and swallow a camel small little Buzzy a small little thing the strainer look look and eating a whole camel final four like bilam believes such a condition The backseating Profit I have all kind of profit you know they have lying profit go see them as professional that line professor and Prophets false prophets true prophets hypocritical prophets all kind of prophets non-profits praying Prophets they need a shaving wrong kind of persons but no they just continue with something else they repented the lies in them lying ministers lion pastors and they come back and say Saints in our sorry because of what I prophes I was alive and that is a false prayer Pray For Me that God will take that demon off of me because the devil doing that you know because God can't lie God don't have the abilities alive what God speaks it must always be the truth because God only speak his word he said my word not anybody else word my word shall not return unto me void whatever God said it has to come to pass he will shifting them for your sake Hallelujah he will pull long Kings for your sake he will change government for your sake Oh Glory to God I Daniel understood by books The Prophet Jeremiah say how long we supposed to be here walk and we are getting out give the Lord I shall be getting out we are getting up there's gonna be a Rapture there's going to be a body change there's water will put an immortality this corruption will put on interruption [Applause] Hallelujah right now in America I have a black nun that died I think last year two years ago and when they try to move her body they recognize your body still intact are you by not smelling anything else people touching it something like if it's decision body incorrupted to explain that you know I have no explanation for that I have not I have no experience but they say her body is interruptible and people come into respect and we have every season walking a dead person there May IMAX but she's all gone they might know where she's all going to and you know what that will do for them it gives them anchor to their feet that we have this Incorruptible thing too we have an anchor boy that's not normal that is something of power and there's so much a joker sitting here dead when ghosts are 20th Prophet 20th century Prophet Vindicated like no other man was Vindicated before and Joker standing looking like if they say I wonder and I wonder and he says oh I said a foolishness the prophet and I say last is already come there's a bride to come to Perfection there's a pride to be a Revival there's a pride to be unveiled hey there's a God to be a veil Oh Glory the God hallelujah Glory the God and the bride will have the voice of God God will be speaking to that bride amen I think a Christian or to be tied to where we know it is right because you might be tied to your family your wife could leave you you can be tied to the Army you might get killed you might be tied to any different things it got to end but it has to have a final typos there has to be somewhere the man has got to be tied to for his eternal destination because if you're going to trust in your work when your work is finished it's done you're retired you're finished you're expired the job don't want you to take you out they want somebody younger you're gray and that's impressing them you have 60 other history with them and they say out they say go hold some money and go leave Keep On Walking bye-bye thank you very service and you do like another expert when Moses died God had no long morning is dead in other words he can't function anymore here if a dimension what he could have done he can't do no more now Joshua take these people over Joshua was no leader man he was Moses minister he was menacing the Moses handling Moses stuff and helping Moses and doing this and that all of a sudden God said take these people over and crush them but let me get if I imprint okay the Lord I shout in the house come on young people glory to God don't us happy distinction good success or success where you want Hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God hallelujah as I said that I was sharing with Isaac about the scripture we read in any prayer meeting about Isaac Isaac sword in the land and received the same year wonderful and the Lord blessed him and the man works great and went forward and grew until it became very great you hear that is waiting the man worked great and went forward some people must create and go backwards you know Isaac was going forward until he grew and became very great for he had possession of flux and possession of hurts and great store of servants and the feelings and envied him run it over might come not halfway full my cup running over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life glory to God David was boasted don't prepare us a table for me in the presence of my enemies his enemies my cup run it over that's a man after God's Own Heart that's a man that pleases God and that professor gave me a housewife give me a farmer give me a preacher give me any man that will put God first I will show you somebody successful despite all what the devil put in their way oh give the Lord some praises we have no excuse to be short on God's blessings I expect no surgery amen for that channel but this is still the truth are you pleasing the Lord Jesus said I

when you when you leave there that that blue cut the anointing of him you Anointed with God hallelujah meat saying somebody entertaining or they are saying that title we've got to go to some church message church when you talk to them you dress up biscuit you gotta go back and pray in that corner the other preserve the anointing they have a brother you see me so he he was not all kind of thing with foreign why is that four guardians from the throne said that no Scalia could accept God's power you know God protect the throne you know power that King come over the SEPTA and Celesta praise God and Esther know that you're not supposed to go in except they can call you and they say I will if a perish perish are going but she was taking instructions she had to receive one thing half pink green and blue Here style and all kinds of things I say you know what they were electorate or lipstick and footstep foot nail and nail polish and finger polish and what kind of thing and put Rouge on the

after get into this power thing hey Hallelujah no the veil already rent from the top to the bottom all them high priest Mysteries over oh give the Lord a shout in the house it's for whosoever will Oh Glory [Music] so that anointing Came Upon Jesus isn't that right Brahm said that was God separate himself then he came upon the upper room people and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak in tongues as the spirit getting utterance it was God separated himself God first and a great Pillar of Fire God manifesting human body now God separating himself among his people the pillar of fire break it up and setting upon each of them like four licks of Blaze clothing tongues like Forks of fire clothing tongues like a fire set upon each of them and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and begin to speak in tongues and they speak of utterance how much mystery you think Mary know no then believe Christ together with a promise and they believe they promise and they went on expectation and receive it receive what it what it holy ghost they receive it not a book not yet they hear this tape and if you don't hear this date you're not in it that is false they have to receive it Oh Glory to God and that is the word in spirit form the Holy Ghost says what word in spirit form so that's why brother Brian could tell the Pentecostals you claim to have the Holy Ghost you you can't reject this word because the spirit in the wood is one if you say you have God's spirit and I give you the word and reject it it's not the spirit of God inside of you God's spirit can reject the word this Spirit and the word is the same my the words I speak unto you they are spirit and their life word and spirit is the same and the kingdom is the working power in your life don't say you have no power say you ain't had the spirit of the word inside of you yet because the secret is the word is in the pride God puts something inside of you that's why you receive the word that's why you come to church that's why you believe the message there is something inside of you you didn't put it your mother didn't give it to you is God put that inside of you acknowledge Him worship Him and thank him he put that yes you know you're miserable yes you know you're boastful and mouthful yes you know you're angry and bitter and whatever it is but he went past that he went to see what's inside your soul okay the Lord I shout in the house that's why he offer you a new heart that all I can make it and you spirit and his Spirit Give the Lord a shout he can only offer that to you because the seed is in you how many believe that this morning the seed is in you let me let me sting you a little bit he said no man can come except the father draw him so even though you don't feel recall in a God and you don't feel the anointing and you're feeling but there are people who very ivy they wish yesterday they just wish Jesus words they wish that double scripture I think let's do this because they're not feeling they're not feeling they're not feeling waiting Jesus feeling at the cross nothing ever I see you as being there and he expresses feelings you know he said my God why I was off forsaking me a feeling of abandonment Jesus wasn't singing Hallelujah he wasn't crazy why has funerals sometimes people just do like if he's not he's not dead it blew my mind you know people Rejoice like every person that have died we know they want the glory but they have planes that are people in their family who still grieving even Jesus was God word made flesh when he Allah he wept I guess every people you message me at Jesus Glory Hallelujah they might exhort Jesus but they will tell Jesus specials people crying coffee and biscuit coffee and biscuit coffee and biscuit then you say where have you

pass over anvil Fire coming off your hands Fire coming out your mouth fire color of your body Oh Glory to call the anointing all around you six to eight feet all around you the glory of God no devil is challenging that hey hallelujah praise God Hallelujah Hallelujah the anointing and camping itself around you Gloria Gordon Paul Paul in the Bible Spirits walking back behind him and and those he wouldn't have gone and whatnot Paul didn't talk to that Spirit down the spirits in the light upon Paul and walk and terrorizing him and Paul cast said nothing because God tell him say yet so there's a son light emanating from him natural people can't see that but the devil's in his Spirit realm the scene lies flashing like that they know that's a servant of God they're not you know it's only because they get kick out and boots in Heavenly long hair these Sons you know they have no body legitimately to be here you know that way they have to get humans they use humans so do I say we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against Prince and powers where are they behind flesh and blood so when you see another sister another brother it's as power behind that is an influence behind that Delilah was an influence to defeat Samson Samson like the girl something interesting illegal but the devil likes you too because he never see she's a sweet tool to get this Secret of his power or give

Oh Glory to God in the Pyramid of the anointing and the Pyramid of the colors Oh Glory to God hallelujah while order bands are empty only chosen pan have green oh give the Lord some Praises while other bands are empty only Joseph Brown have green Hallelujah everybody had to come under the pyramid and one of these days every group every Pastor every Minister have to come down to the pyramid to find out how to get over here you can hide from the atomic bombs you can't hide from the weapons of war the only way up is to death pyramid this being when it's completed is the servant of God in the Church of God that's good in a Rapture Oh Glory to God hallelujah maybe seated my Lord Hallelujah praise God the prophet said watch the Holy Ghost will always point to the wood if it points to our Creed or denomination it is not the Holy Ghost he couldn't do that he point away from the word he died here we go to confirmed that word and make that word positive to do what make the word positive he died so he could come himself into that word he is the quick in life that makes the word live again that was his promise of that purpose of dying and he could still project himself through his church and make every word through every Age act exactly to say it's supposed to act he is the Dynamics of the mechanics he is the Dynamics is a person he is the Dynamics not some man is a Dynamics he is the Dynamics of the mechanics the mechanics of the church what is it apostles Prophets teachers in other words the faithful Ministry becomes God's mechanics and he continued the code is the dynamic that works that So when you say mechanics and Dynamics together he is saying the minister the office of the faithful Ministry becomes the word and the Dynamics come upon him the pastor Apostle Prophet and whatnot and God speak to that Sunday of Pentecost the pillar of fire was resting on Peter's shoulder like I picked up with a pillow of his shoulder but that pillar fire was resting on Peter's shoulder and the Holy Spirit is speaking out through Peter these are not what you suppose but this is that this is the stone that you build has rejected so that God himself identified in the scripture what exactly happened then he says praise God this this is that that the prophet Joel speak of so it was the word speaking back it was the anointing speaking out and that same thing going to happen again direct inspiration there's no other name on the heaven on the wish must receive and because Peter had the key to the kingdom he said repent every one of you and be baptized and that Keyhole for all of us that key still holding because he was given the keys to the kingdom repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ foreign the gift of the Holy Ghost that has always been the promise in every age any generation even Cornelius received the Holy Ghost without even being baptized oh give the Lord as praise after he got the Holy Ghost surrender baptized in Jesus name Oh Glory the god the Holy Ghost come to our right heart Give the Lord some praises glory to God a right heart so when the disciples received this promise they went into an absolute fate period where they just believe in what God Said God said so God said so God said so they locked into the vision The Heirs wasn't itching hey with the new revelation that that the Pharisee preaching though they wasn't looking from tape to tape and scanning channels you know some people scanning channels they want to hear what this one praying after this one playing at this one playing I want to finish all the Mind confused no absolute because he said so he said so he's also so they were anointed with the words of the Solomon these disciples they were Anointed with the words the son of the son of man they had what Abraham called Resurrection feet that is Faith he's reached from the dead Jesus is not in public now he's not going by the and multiplying bread and fish just among the disciples quick then power revealing Mysteries quick and power revealing the word quickton power revealing the promise that they have to receive now remember they believe Christ before he is not raised from the dead but he is going deeper to give them promises from the father so he said behold I send you the promise of my father tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you be untrue perform on high so he set them up for power they were positive Powers coming at our body today that have no deal with it positive power is coming Hallelujah well the wife haven't cooked for me this morning now these brothers in the spirit they are Vex for this and vexada everything and you're grumpy and you're grumpy look grumpy Peter wasn't in that grumpy mood they was in the spirit someone God allowed things to happen to just to see what how you're going to behave you they could do what they want it's not it's not them he's testing he's testing you okay the Lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God so they were Anointed with the words of the son of man the son of man give them promises he opened their understanding and he opened the word to them you have to do both because if the world is open and you don't have the understanding you still miss it if you understand it open you wouldn't open he said you need both you know your understanding to open to catch a revelation of the word being open to you and the word being open to you shows you your promise and they show you just word open it shows you what you are promised notice what happened when Jesus Peter said the word of Christ he said the word Peter in other words as he acknowledge the reverence of the word the word acknowledge Him don't ask Peter I identify you and Upon This Rock I'll build my church the word speaks back to you isn't that right oh praise God so therefore all they had was to do was to go and wait wait under the promise of the age clothe themselves but I'm talking about the brightest wrapped in the gong of his promised word hallelujah are you with me he gave Abraham that faith when he that sixth sense when he was 75 years old and Sarah was 65 a woman dead he lived with her since he was about 17 years old no children he was 75 years old good as dead and God told him he was going to have a baby he called Everything concerted as though it wasn't for he was fully persuaded that God was able to keep the word that he said he didn't just wait from one night to the other he waited 25 years before it ever happened and he never failed one time he staggered not at the promise true unbelief but was strong evidence of strength given praise to God evidence given priest to God you have a problem I hear your Praises here giving praise to God I didn't say nothing unbelievable in the good time he praised his name and the bad time to do the same you have to be able to thank God and praise God you're looking at your neighbor house because you want yours fixed and the more your neighborhood sexy only more Vex you get you're in problems yeah your problems 996 cents at work because if God is with you he's going to work things out for you gonna make a way for you you don't know we're never doing you don't even ever

Lord some praises Hallelujah hear us he had a touch of that Sixth Sense he called Everything contrary to what God Said to do it wasn't what God Said was true and after 25 years the baby was born no it seems silly to the human mind could you imagine her old money and Tifton 100 years old a woman 90 going down to the doctor to make arrangement of a baby doctor would say the old man kind of touching his head something wrong he's a little crazy isn't that right watch more what so Moses so so so obviously Abraham didn't go with his intellect are you with me Moses needed a touch he tried to do it intellectually and that's the matter with the teachers of our day we are trying to do through schools we're trying to do to denominations we're trying to do it through education Reformation or what the church needs is a new birth a baptism of the Holy Spirit the touch the touch of the sixth sense that set the soul on fire Oh Glory that touched to bring him out oh my Hallelujah he called a conference with Moses he selected a place a burning bush another burning bush he talked to Moses I remember my promise and I'm sending you down yonder where you're made of failure I'm sending you right back to take up where you left off where you feel God's telling you back don't be ashamed we all fail whose success who succeed could we all fail but God will anoint you to go right back at the

such a giver a free giving person and she not only given things she will give of her time and listen to people and relate to people and communicate with people but he expressed how much he was in love with God's people how much he served and are sitting on hearing that and I'm watching with admiration that this is a son I'm not sure I don't think he's in church right now but this is our son

how happy with tears of joy we should be on our D knees day and night thanking God for what he has done I hear the bomb we are way over here at the back of the book [Applause] [Music] does that we are way over here at the back of the book what happens if the composer writes something and we find out it isn't acted out right we find out there is something that happens there is something lacking he who composed it has made it up and rooted out and then the symphony is playing it it's a wrong note there is something wrong the director gave the wrong motion that's what the matter of the day my Lutheran Brethren my Baptist bedroom my Pentecostal bedroom all my brethren for all these nominations you're trying to give a note hit back and there's a looter Wesley or actually the music sheet here shows with another day they have played their part back there now the only way we're gonna ever get to do it by bridging impression of the world I might say there's only one way for the director to do he has to get in the same Spirit of the composer so Beethoven and all these guys who write great music they could read it it's a script it have notes it is written anybody reading them noise could play it if a man playing something different he wins something else it has to be the same note oh this symphony is in order the man the spirit brought the symphony but a Branham brought the symphony and he write the music sheet and there's a fight for Ministry supposed to direct the plate according to the symphony according to the notes we'll give the Lord I shout but men seem to be writing their own notes Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right praise God to the directors after getting the spirit of the composer brother Branham we should be so on fire for God we should be going day and night nothing should be able to stop us yeah you're always supposed to be we supposed to be so sweet so pleasant so kind so Christ like in our lives it takes everyday life to be like that Another Sunday thing guys every day you're fighting every day is striving to be kind to let things go I remember a brother every living thing small thing but you just you just at it boy you just utterly family I said listen yeah as you can see you take a big helmetic approach I see you can't do that shouting of every little thing I said take it easy brother take it easy Let It Go you have to know what word the fight what would the rebuke isn't that right that's his wisdom oh blessed be the name of the Lord like that your pressure will keep staying up right there you know and when you see alter the spirit and your body run down is a difficult thing to manage stress and I've read the scripture where Jesus told disciples come outside and rest come outside and rest we'll see how the ministry I think they come aside and rest the rest is to recharge the rest is to get empowered get back strength to go back and face the battle for you oh give the Lord a shout there must be a balance in the Christian walk a balance in a Christian Life Hallelujah is it considered a Littlefield and and Jesus specifically identified the little reveal how it grows and pours and spin so but I'm talking about the personality it's done in the muck but it's pressing every day presently the sun calling just pressing and that person only Sundays alone let me seeing you Sunday yeah long just on Monday yeah just not so long no we're not talking about that we're talking about you person every single day every day you want to be a Christian every day you want to do better you want to do better than the day before Oh Glory to God isn't that something Hallelujah adoption placing positionally where are they at show me where they are God calling this children aside by manifestation they don't have

time that's a prophecy over you know that you'll come to the place to sign the check just take a little more here now was the Pentecostal Church a noisy Church back at the beginning when the Holy Ghost fell the Virgin Mary she was drunk staggered on the power of God all of them like that the people said they are full of new wine that's the way the church was ordained that's the way every church is ordained every time God has a church it has to be the same kind of church and I am identified with the same kind that's the only kind that God have same kind of church let me know he said cause that ain't no answers in town uncertain song it's strange wherever he is there's always a lot of noise you know noise is a sign of life remember the high priest when he dressed and went to the holiest holies on the end of the Garment he had a pomegranate on a bell and that noise is the holiest of holies was the one way the waiters know that he was alive or not it made a noise and when they ate no noise then he might be dead and I think that's the whole matter with the churches today there is not enough noise about it not enough enthusiasm not enough something so where Jesus is there is always a noise don't tell me God in Simplicity God in silence wherever Jesus is there is noise Heavenly noise worship noise show the noise but there's never gonna be quiet is never dead Oh Glory to God you know the priest went in dress for the holies of holies on the end of the Garment in the pomegranate and a bell and that noise in the holy holies was the only way they waited knew they was alive or not praise God isn't that right I think that that time in Europe you know in heaven in heaven the seraphs saying holy holy Lord God Almighty they cry in day and night when Isaiah went into the temple and he broke into the Heavenly atmosphere and saw them seraphims and they are the burners they take the fire off the altar they will touch his lips the word cleanse you are purged oh hallelujah hallelujah so the representation of that was the Bells on Iran garment there one time he coming to Jerusalem they were screaming and hollering Who Silence of the king had come out some of those priests standing there why do you make them keep still and hold their peace and he said if they hold their peace the rocks will cry out something has got to move when he's around glory to God hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah people say you make too much noise this is the quietest place you'll ever live in if you get to heaven even the angels are singing day and night holy and holy unto the Lord if they go to hell it is weapon and willing and National teeth this is the quietest place you'll ever live oh praise God praise God praise God hallelujah hallelujah you talk about woman don't want to make babies no more they will take dog and Captain so on she's a disgrace so if she did by sin loving society and so that type of woman right he said a true picture of the modern church today neither does the modern Church want any of these screaming shouting tongue-speaking Acts 2 38 young ones are wrong she don't want any of them hooping and crying and screaming amen hallelujah while such a child will immediately put out the denomination praise God they say why are you letting that stuff go on you see she's pregnant with something because she's bringing forth
