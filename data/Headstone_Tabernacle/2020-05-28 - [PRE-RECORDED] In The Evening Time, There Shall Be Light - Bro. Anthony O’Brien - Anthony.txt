Hallelujah the only Jesus that this world will see is the Jesus in you and the Jesus in me oh the world is waiting the world is crying out for Revival they don't know what to do about it but we have a promise from the Lord this morning that in the evening time there shall be light oh say Amen somebody oh Hallelujah glory be to God my subject is recognizing your day and its message and my inspiration is a word made flesh amen and amen you love him this morning amen so praise God today's word I trust is a word of inspiration to you amen a word of inspiration from the Lord we need to be inspired if the word of God is not inspired to us then it's just words that we're hearing then it's just church that we're coming to then it's just a building but when God is here it becomes more than a building when God is here it becomes more than a church but you've got to be inspired you've got to be in the spirit of the coming of the Lord you got to be looking for his coming watching for his coming waiting for his coming praying for his coming seeking for his coming oh because he is coming oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah many don't recognize it but Jesus said a little while and the world will see me no more they will go into their loling they will say oh Lord theay it is coming but you shall see me and because I live you shall live also and Greater Works than this shall you do because I go unto my father oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah when you realize when you recognize your day and your message you will do the Greater Works say Amen somebody oh hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah so God's word Must Be Inspired amen you mind if I take my time this morning but when it's inspired it comes to life to you the individual and that's when we hear it that's when we recognize it and that's when we're ready to act upon it isn't that right and then when we become convinced and then concerned about the time and the season and the day that we're living in Hallelujah isn't that right so the Holy Ghost wants to come in more than ever before amen and place the church positionally isn't that right but it's been bound by Creeds Bound by dogmas but in the evening time there shall be lights that's a promise this morning I don't care how bound you feel I don't care how messed up you feel in the evening time in the dark time in the shadows of the Dying World there shall be light oh you're not hearing me this morning oh Hallelujah if you heard me this morning we'd have to fix the roof cuz you be on your feet oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah don't worry we're going to get to it well what is the L well in order for us to understand what the light is we'll have to go back to Genesis isn't that right amen we have to go back to that original light amen that God spoke in the beginning amen so let's go back now Genesis 1 says that when God made the heavens and the Earth that the Earth was without form and was was void and there was Darkness amen so here was three problems that we have the first problem is it without it was without form which means the Earth was uh in chaos it lay in ruin it lay confused it was messed up there was also another problem the Earth was void it was void of Life there was nothing in it try and imagine a world with no animal life no human life no living creature nothing in it just the deadness of Silence it was void of Life void of action void of movement oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right furthermore there was another problem there was also Darkness sir you couldn't see anything because there was nothing to see there was no light at all there was nothing anywhere oh hallelujah what a condition sounds like the condition that some people find themselves in void of life without form talk is all over can't find a space can't find nothing nothing P trying hard to pray feel like you can't find your way I feel that God is here this morning to do something different to speak a word in due season a spoken word in due season how good it is oh [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so it's without form yes it was void empty and it was dark there was no light in there at all so then the only way God decided to move forward because even if he wanted to give the earth form we still have to see what we were doing and in order to deal with the voidness in order to deal with the emptiness we still have to see what we doing so there was a problem that he had to deal with this problem of Darkness Hallelujah stood in God's way of doing something about the Earth Hallelujah that he had created and in the earth he had created yes sir were seeds yes sir and those seeds were predestinated to bring forth life to bring forth herb yielding fruit to bring forth trees but they were over by this Darkness oh Hallelujah there was a void there was emptiness there was nothing oh hallelujah hallelujah and God looked at the darkness and he didn't argue with the darkness he didn't complain with the darkness he didn't have a meeting with the darkness he didn't issue a warrant to the darkness he didn't get sexs with the darkness he didn't get upset with the darkness he didn't get out of the atmosphere when he approached the darkness no no no no no oh God had to do was speak a word and God said let there be light God is not worried about the darkness this morning God just has to speak a word hallelujah his thoughts are not your thoughts his ways are not your ways his ways are higher his ways are thoughts but before it could become a word it had to be a thought so when God thought about it then he spoke it and said let there be light oh give the Lord a [Applause] shout huh let there be light let there be light this morning I don't care how you feel let there be light this morning let there be light in your home let there be light in your heart let there be light upon you lift up your hands worship God in a sanctuary let the light of God come upon your soul and make you a new creature a new creation oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we are the children of the light oh hallelujah oh we are no longer slaves to sin oh we are children children of God we are born for such a time as this we are raised up for such a time as this let there be light in this message in this world let there be light oh we declare it our faith declare it we are of our father and we speak a word this morning we speak our word this morning let there be light right in the evening time right in the middle of the darkness oh Hallelujah let there be light right [Music] [Applause]

hallelujah oh now he didn't argue with the darkness he simply spoke a word to the darkness and he said to the darkness let there be light Hallelujah and there was light isn't that right Hallelujah there was no more argument there was no more fuss there was no more debate all of the chaos all of the ruin was dealt with Hallelujah in the first F when he spoke let there be light isn't that right amen hallelujah G now what is Darkness Darkness is defined as the absence of light so when there is no light then ultimately we get Darkness isn't that right amen when there's no presence of light when there's no other positive influence the only other default position is Darkness isn't that right Hallelujah it means and it was such an encouragement to me as I studied this here it means that if darkness is the absence of light then that means darkness is not really an actual Force Hallelujah darkness is not really an energy light has the energy the prophet said from light comes life but out of Darkness nothing can come it means that when we turn on a light Darkness has to find its place it means that the devil this morning doesn't really have any power he has no power over the Blood Washed ones because where there is light Darkness got to fly on back death must know its Master because the kings of the Earth have come back to take back from the enemy what he took from us he took our children we're going to take it back if he took your joy we're going to take it right back and if there's darkness in your life if there's darkness in your home this morning let there be light oh hallelujah hallelujah oh yes oh yes Satan is powerless this morning the devil is confused this morning there's nothing he can do because when a light comes forth the darkness has to find its place the darkness has to be pushed back the maker of the earth is here to let you know that he is here to begin his Reign he is here to take control of your situation maybe it's too hard maybe it's too powerful but there's no power like our God he is the original Power he is the original life [Applause] Hallelujah that's why the Bible says resist the devil and he'll flee from you we'll split him seven ways praise God because a light of God scatters the Cockroaches scatters the Devils left and right Hallelujah and the light produces a life oh and our life is Jesus Christ and our life is seven Thunders that holds the mystery of the coming of the Lord and if these things be new and abound you shall neither be buried nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ escaping the world that is corruption through lust hallelujah oh my Glory my God hallelujah oh I don't know my holy spirit is here you just ride the anointing amen he just dropped down already The Devil Is On The Run the devil is running praise God probably reach Bo's tongue by now I see him on the way out praise God you have the victory this morning you have the victory right now oh hallelujah praise God Amen Hallelujah my huh so the power of that light is more powerful than the power of Darkness it's not really a power but where there's no light the defa position is Darkness so where there's no positive influence in the community young boys well you know what they get up to amen get up to trouble stealing robbing weed whatever that's default that's a natural position that's a normal position when there's no positive influence because we were born in sin shaped in iniquity and come into the world speaking lies so therefore some higher power some higher influence has to influence us not from here but from above not on the ground level but something from up there a vision we got to be caught up in to catch a higher realm to be in a higher place to see what's coming to see what God is trying to show us oh Hallelujah glory to God Amen young people it makes you walk different when you see it from a different perspective cuz all the time you're seeing it from your eyes how you feel how you are going through and what what's going in your mind but when you raise up into the mind of God into his purpose into his program and what he wants for your life then it changes the way you walk changes the way you talk changes the way you see things changes the way you approach this gospel this word praise God because you're operating by God's divine revelation Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah up in that second round amen thank you Lord glory god speaking to you God Amen now watch now watch he said now let there be light okay so God is the original Power God is the original light that came forth and darkness had to find its place so when God said let it be light God saw it was light amen isn't that right now this light is not a natural light remember the Nick Genesis 1:12 to 24 this light is not a natural light that we're talking about but this is a supernatural light am remember he spoke it in the beginning am but when we go down to uh Genesis 1 12 uh to 14 amen can you find it amen we put it up amen so you'll see it and God said let there be lights in the firmaments of the heaven to divide the day for the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days days and years and let them be for light in the firment of the heaven to give light upon the Earth and it was so and God made two great lights the greater light to Rule the Day and the Lesser light to rule the night and he made the Stars also amen thank you so that what we're talking about is the sun that's the moon that's the Stars that's the light he give for times that's a light he give for season that's a light he give for years but in order for was to do his work in the beginning there was a light that came before all those lights that's the light we're talking about this morning I'm not talking about a natural light but I'm talking about the light he spoke in the beginning that is the original light not the s n light but the s o n light that is a light you feel this morning in this Tabernacle That's What trapped down this morning Hallelujah the original light glory to God now watch that was the Sun the moon the stars but he said let there be light and then he said he let that light be separated from all other lights because after he saw that light he said this light is good and after that the Bible said he separated the light from the darkness so anything outside of the and light is Darkness but Bram said let every man's word be a lie and let God's word be true and if God spoke it it's got to happen because that is the original light he was that light he was the light of all men and the word became flesh and that flesh dwell among us and we beheld his glory the same Glory that spoke the Earth in the beginning that same Glory dwelt Among Us and he said when you see me you see that light when you see me you see the Father the father in me and on that day you shall know I am in my father the father will be in me and I will be in you and you in me what day this [Applause] day oh [Music] Hallelujah that was the original l now ride with me now we're going somewhere that was the original light it took the light to declare the day because when God saw the light he said that that light was good amen he was pleased with that light he rejoiced with that light he was uh he was happy about that light and he called that light day and he called The Darkness night so anything that is outside of the dark outside of the light that's in the darkness that's in the night time Hallelujah that's out there but God separated it light from Darkness day from night isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah isn't that right glory and the the morning and the evening was the first day isn't that right evening and the morning rather amen so here it was amen you love him this morning amen the prophet said now he said the son is the king of all the lights on this Earth in a natural light no matter how much artificial light that we can have and how many great electric Rays we can produce he said but when that sun rises all the rest of them dim out that's the same thing with the word of God he said when the word of God Rises all of the superstitions all of the denominational fanaticisms and things spread away and it shows just exactly what it is God in the beginning said let there be light and the light light only comes the True Light the king light only comes by the word of God he had to speak it then a manifestation can take place afterwards isn't that right the light of God only comes by the word of God isn't that right Hallelujah isn't that right God separated the light from the darkness in the beginning and the word of God was made manifest and always separates the light from the darkness I'll say that again the word of God made manifest always separates the light from the darkness hallelujah hallelujah the word of God when made manifest always separates the light from the darkness when the word of God produces a life when the word of God produces another Ephesians when the word of God produces another original Church another the original Branch then it separates everything else from itself praise God then it comes back to the original that I don't care what fanaticism what they preach what they say God will always point you back to the word back to the original the original light the original life the original Holy Fire that fell on the day of Pentecost that's what we going back to that is the day that we are living in right now it's got to come back to the original [Applause] life amen oh I'm getting a little h of myself amen right the anointing this morning amen you feel his presence Give the Lord a shout of [Applause] praise am Hallelujah okay so now watchall he said now separate the light from the darkness right so the word of God made manifest I want to drive this down the word of God made manifest always separates the light from the darkness so we've got to have a burden this morning Amen to become a manifestation amen because God is longing to reproduce himself in Sons and Daughters of God so God is Not happy God is not satisfied until we become a manifestation of this then when we Manifest this when we manifest St John 14:12 when we manifest St P second Peter 1 14-7 then God is pleased to dwell in you Hallelujah my God my God hallelujah hallelujah people can rise up with this or that or the other isms can rise communism fascism all other isms can rise up superstitions Cults whatever it may be interpretations dogmas Creeds all kind of men's ideas men's thoughts messing up the people messing up the churches messing up good people with false doctrines false teachings false Christ or rise up leaning away silly women were Laden with thus lust they have not recognized their

word of Repro to you and a word amen of exaltation amen amen wonderful hallelujah hallelujah so now you see but you see now we we uh we know it's here but it's until it's Vindicated prove that it's light then we have no right to argue against that because it shuts all other light out Jesus said let every man's word be a lie let mine be truth his word is superior H over all man's words over all anything his word is light isn't that right amen amen amen hallelujah I'll skip this down now okay okay well he says I know we know in the beginning it must have been foggy it must have been dismal dark as the world was turning before he spoke it isn't that right amen and when God knew that he need he had need of light now his seed was already in the Earth because he had he had planted it there but he needed light now to bring forth that seed to make that seed live because the seed SE was already there H when God made the Earth there was seed already there when you came forth from out of your mother's womb there was a seed already there when you were going to school there was a seed already there when you got your first job there was a seat already there when the devil tried to kill you in that accident in that fire in that whatever it was there was a seat already there the devil is trying to Snuff your light out but there was a seed already there God spoke that seed in the beginning and that seed's got to come forth God dispatch an angel to walk with you to make sure that you make it to that angel the angel of the Lord because you have an appointment this morning with the Supernatural and the UN God oh hallelujah praise God the same God that Moses saw in a burning bush the same God that Joshua saw as the captain of the host that same God is here to separate the light from the darkness in your soul GL [Applause] Glory HJ so we're not satisfied this morning yes until we have that light burning in our hearts burning in our souls burning in our system oh the apostles their hands were anointed their feet were anointed Peter Shadow was anointed people lay there sick on beds and couches by Adventure Peter would pass by and they would be healed in the shadow he didn't even pray he didn't even touch them but when the light reflected off of us Son of God his very Shadow is Anointed sh Hallelujah you know what I'm saying that kind of son is coming back that kind of daughter is coming back upon the earth when a royal priesthood we are a holy nation A peculiar people and when that light is ready to manifest itself then will the Philistines go backing up then the shorts will go off cigars will be missing faces will be washed the gospel will preach and its power and then the Philistines will go to back it up the darkness will go to backen up because

believe in the light oh hallelujah oh wave after wave wave after wave hallelujah oh my glory glory my my oh my hallu hallelujah oh we in the spirit now we all bathed down hallelujah oh wonderful now he says just like in each age God has foretold us what would take place in each age the only thing he needs is a manifestation of the light upon that scripture isn't that right the manifestation of the light needs to come upon second Peter 1 14-7 to come upon Revelation 22:17 the manifestation of the light isn't that right to make it live for that age and it would do it as long as a light can get to the word as long as a light can get to that seed in your soul then it then something happens something reacts because it's a Lord that's put into motion isn't that right remember in the days of Wesley they were so Sanctified yes that the Holy Ghost would want to fall upon the people that they would want to baptize them but it wasn't the days yet for that to happen so they would throw buckets on the people I think it was isn't that right to get him out of the spirit before that take place because if it did it would change a season but what that showed us is that there's a Lord that's put into motion Hallelujah that every time you meet God's requirements every time you meet God's conditions you in the right conditions then certain things will take place and if you are Sanctified If You Are Holy then the holy spirit is very attracted it's very excited about a person like that it wants to fall upon him oh Hallelujah because it's a law that's put into motion if my people shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their Wicked Ways then I will hear from Heaven I will he forgive their sin I will heal their land that's God's word and he will manifest it amen [Applause] [Music] oh when God's people begin to pray for the Lord to have his way then the spirit of the Lord is coming down when you begin to get into obedience to the whole word of God to everything that God told you to do Hallelujah your ABCs always believe Christ Sanctified holy separating yourself from all unbelief when you begin to do that the Holy Ghost the same holy spirit that fell on the day of Pentecost is obligated to meet you on the basis of his promised [Applause] word [Applause] hallelujah full obedience to the whole word of God entitles you to the Token amen and amenu do you love him this morning oh my time is just going but the holy spirit is here and that's all right and that's okay because if somebody's delivered then the work of God is finished doesn't matter what I have written here but the work of God must be accomplished this morning somebody's going to go free somebody's going to be inspired somebody this week is going to called on fire glory to God hallelujah somebody this week is going to break back past the natural going to go into the holies of holies they're going to go into their PR closet oh Hallelujah you the devil's going to see something then brother the devil's got another thing coming when you begin to get into your place when you begin to get into the right atmosphere in the right condition God will speak from heaven and this world will hear direct from God amen amen and there is another people in the land who under the Messenger will be the final voice to the final age and the final Junction of time right down in the evening time there shall be light oh Hallelujah glory glory to God amen amen oh let me hurry along here now he said you might plant wheat you might plant wheat at one time or grain at another time some come slower than others because it depends on the season but God's word comes in a season amen isn't that right the law and the grace and so forth as we went on Through the Ages and each time it is lit up by the manifestation of the light spreading forth the life that is in the seed amen the life comes from the light isn't that right and we realize that God's light of the day is his son the one was s n but this one was s o n s o n is the Bible isn't that right he was in the beginning was a word and the Word was with God and the Word was God Hebrews 138 he's the same yesterday today and forever it's the word of God always it was Christ that was in Noah it was Christ that was in Moses it was Christ in David that looked up as a rejected King upon the city where 800 years later Christ sat there weeping over a city being himself a rejected King just like David was isn't that right it was always the spirit of Christ and the full manifestation of God's word made known through Jesus Christ is the spirit of God and that's what they were doing that's the reason they did that because they were living now watch he's talking about something else now he's talking about amen people got qu of interpretation he said they're living in the glare of another light amen or they're living in the glare of a past light isn't that right they're living in the glare of the light of another day and that's what I believe he said is a matter with the world today friends is because we're trying to live in the glare of a light that shined in another day a glare is a false light just like a mirage on the road he said we go down the road and we see a mirage it's a false conception of the Sun and when you get there it hasn't produced a thing but something false because you cannot walk in the glare of the sun because it's a mirage always showing you something that there's nothing to and when people try to tell you that Jesus Christ isn't the same yesterday today and forever they're leading you to a mirage anytime someone preaches something that is outside of this gospel outside of this Bible outside of the correct interpretation they are leading you into a mirage that's all and when you get into church and then you join maybe a church or some cold Creed or something like that there's nothing there no more than what you had in the world from separation from unbelief the Bible says oh we believe that God is a great God yes and we read back there where he was with the people back 2,000 years ago the prophet said that's intellectual that's something that God did that's like a man he said freezing to death and a paint him and we paint him a big fire on the wall and say look what a beautiful fire that was see this picture here well he had a fire to come look how everybody was getting warm but everybody was getting warm then but what about you you can't get warmed by a painted fire you've got to have the fire itself oh Hallelujah so we are not here this morning to preach painted fires we not here this morning what we are here is to anoint the promise of God present tense now Faith is for your deliverance right now for your healing right now for your salvation right now the people need God today not a god of yesterday not a god of tomorrow we need God right now right now in this place not a painted fire but the fire of God itself the fire of God to burn in your heart burn in your soul burn out the lust burn out the lies burn out demon powers burn out the love of the world hallelujah praise God it has to be real oh Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it has to be real it has to be genuine it has to be God in your heart in your soul oh my oh my isn't that right oh holy spirit told me speak something here now amen let me read this here said now there you are don't fall short of that brother said said without the baptism of the Holy Spirit you're lost that's the only you won't have to worry about getting into heaven if there's nothing in there Supernatural the prophet said the doors cannot unlock over there you could walk there and bump your head against it but if the spirit of God is in there the spirit of God inside here will unhinge the doors God to have that thing in here to unlock it over there yonder Glory that's what I come for not to be a church member but to have that thing in here to unlock the doors over there open up your Gates glory to God a Son of God is coming home oh Hallelujah when the Holy Spirit it comes down into your soul it makes you a candidate for the Supernatural and for the Unseen Hallelujah pray you

always there in God's mind and he thought about you and he knew you would make a mistake and he knew you would fall and he knew you wouldn't always feel good he knew you wouldn't always feel righteous so God paid the price now it's not about what you feel but it's what about what he did for you on calvary's tree oh that's why we praise him that's why we shout that's why we lift up our hands that's why we ought to worship God every single day that's why I have no reservation when I come to church I don't care where I am I'll praise the name of my God in the sanctuary of my God I couldn't care

light will declare the day that we are living in and this day Omega Pride Day means back to the word back to the Bible back to the original back to the foundation that was laid on the day of Pentecost oh when the day of Pentecost was fully come there wasn't one mind there wasn't one Accord why because the word of God was open to them they were with Jesus 30 40 days and he unlocked their thinking he unlocked their minds as to who they were who God was who the devil was and they knew by Revelation what they had to receive and they were there praying continually in the spirit and in those days Peter stood up among them and said this Jesus of whom we were Witnesses who were slain on a cross and hung on a tree to die is now exalted at the right hand of God and he told us to T in Jerusalem and pray without ceasing and stay under expectation and Peter and them by inspiration begin to put the church in order and they cast lots and Maas was counted with them isn't that right but the Bible said that when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were in one mind they would want Accord and all of a sudden all of a sudden they heard a sound come from Heaven sound of a Russian Mighty Wind that sound swept into the house and we get to baptize individuals into the kingdom of God everyone receive their lick of fire this morning we come to receive our own lick of fire we are not satisfied we are not happy until the Holy Spirit comes into our soul and gives us a birth of the Holy Ghost and Fire another anointing once more Lord once more Lord we declare that the time is at hand for the

else will pass away oh hallelujah hallelujah God already swore by himself time should be no more the angel dropped down from heaven clothed with a cloud rainbow upon his head what was that rainbow reflection of the pure light of God the glory of the Lord that surrounds us he is that pure white light and then when science says when that white light is refracted through a glass prism there's a rainbow that sprays out and it's a natural type of the glory of the Lord that when the pure white light of the world is in you then we reflect seven rainbow glories seven rainbow colors the presence of light is what brings forth the colors not the darkness but the light the original light of God hallelujah oh man seven rainbow colors seven attributes of God faith virgin knowledge Temperance

brings a warming raise of the Holy Ghost upon you it makes you a new creature in Christ Jesus don't walk in some glare of another age that glare been made all right for them it's been all right for them it's that right the Jews thought that they were worshiping the True Light they thought that they were worshiping the same God that they were turning down the very one that they thought they were worshiping they were crucified they were making fun of the very God and making him a laughing stock of the people the very God that they thought they were worshiping Hallelujah may I say this with reverence and respect the prophet says but to bring light because as our brother said a while ago we're living later than you think we are amen and he said one of these days something is going to happen one day come on it's going to be too late yes sir and he said the people would take on the mark of the beast not knowing what they are doing Blind Le the Blind and they all fall in the ditch Jesus said and we're living later than we think many honest people follow that not even knowing what they're doing but the hour is at hand now the prophet said oh here what going to strike when the light is shining the Gospel Light and in its power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ manifesting himself that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday the same today and the same forever he lotted that for this day amen isn't that right amen he lotted that for this day the things that he promised for this day must happen in this day if the church won't accept it then God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham so if you don't want it God will find a drunken God will find a prostitute but he said my table shall be full Hallelujah but we are here this morning to recognize a call and to respond to the voice but when Jesus calls to us this morning he's calling to your heart this morning morning and we hear the voice of the lord we heard him when we was in this church and when we was in that church when we was over there and over here when we were tossed about with every wind of Doctrine but a voice came to us my sheep know my voice A stranger's voice they will not follow we have not followed conly Divine favors but this is the voice of God unto the children of this last day wake up this morning amen recognize the voice recognize your day recognize your message and what we are called unto hallelujah amen we are called to Perfection we are called to adoption the adoption of sons oh the adoption of sons unto Jesus Christ unto himself that's according to the pleasure of his good will it please God to adopt you into his family it pleased God to predestinate you to be conformed to the image of his son it pleased God to choose you say Amen somebody it pleased God to love you it pleased God to write your name in blood it pleased God to die for you it pleased God to pay the price it pleased God to give you the Holy Ghost Hallelujah it put a smile on his face because you are the children of the life [Applause] royal priesthood holy nation peculiar people hallel hallu hallelujah now we behold as in a glass the glory of the Lord when you behold his glory then you are changed into that Glory into that image from glory to glory from glory to glory H beholding the glory of the Lord that's what we come for this morning to behold his glory to look upon him to see him manifested in us when we see our nakedness when we see all all sinfulness we want to be washed by the blood of the Lamb we want to be sealed by the Holy Ghost and Fire and come into His Image and come into His likeness and be transformed by the renewing of our mind that we might prove what is that good and acceptable oh somebody say Amen am you didn't just come to church to warm a church pew oh to warm a church bench but to be changed from glory to glory to be sealed in your soul with the Holy Ghost and Fire to have the same nature hallelu that was in Christ live in you that your family could see it that your wife could see it that your husband could see it that your children can see it it's got to be a real change no more playing Church no more plain Christian but you smile genuine you love genuine you forgive genuinely not speak lovely the truth but speak the truth in love that's what we got to come back to the original gospel the original Bible Hallelujah the original [Applause] [Music] Church Hallelujah do you believe it and say [Applause] amen glory glory glory glory glory glory oh I just be a few minutes with you do you believe it God's coming back for the original church God loved that first church thean church isn't that right signs wonders Miracles but what happened fell from their first from First Love isn't that right but God through these seven Church ages has restored a bride isn't that right amen hallelujah isn't that right through the reformers and in the day of Luther he brought back justification isn't that right Hallelujah that was a light for his day and they rejoiced with that light and they love that light and they praise God in that land they had a Revival in that land but when it raised a little further Wesley came with a a higher realm isn't that right Hallelujah you must not always be also be justified because in those days they drank beer isn't that right it was all right Hallelujah the Germans isn't that right amen praise God but then here he come Wesley with a message of sanctification yes sir not only must it be justification but sanctification also Hallelujah sanctify yourselves set yourself for service praise God amen amen isn't that right and when that rose up it was a greater light Hallelujah and the Gospel Light kept moving on but then they organize and then down come the Pentecostals in the open door age and introduce the birth and the gifts and that was an even greater light receive the Holy Ghost oh H you must be born again born of the spirit Hallelujah isn't that right Hallelujah but when the prophet Malachi 4 came he introduced the fullness of the word so brother what day are we living in if we are living in a day when the son of man is being revealed and the fullness of the word is here am then that means we have what it takes we have all the revealing of the seals to unlock the fullness of the spirit upon a bride once more this world will hear direct from God there'll be a people in the land another people who will do just what that first church did it'll be another Pentecost there'll be another Revival there'll be another Spiritual Awakening and it will happen right in the evening time right when the devil thinks he's got everything on the Earth right when the devil thinks he's got him Bound in Creeds and in dogmas right in the middle of all of that God will raise up a bride with power and demonstration backing up the Devils hallelujah praise God hallelujah say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart you can have whatever you ask for ask you for rain in a time of the latter of rain latter of rain is fixing the fall oh hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I'm getting ready to close out musicians can get ready praise God hallelujah hallelujah my God I'm excited do you know what's going to happen do you know what's going to take place these same young people people who you thought was all broken up and all twisted up God the prophet said we'll do in one year what all theologians fail to do in 2,000 years because it won't be a work of man it won't be an intellectual workup but it'll be the ministry of the spirit quickening the word to the bride making you ready for the Rapture hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so I say this morning the time has come for the word to be made flesh the time has come for the light of God the manifestation of the Holy Spirit am to shine for the light of God isn't that right amen oh praise God hallelujah praise God hallelujah praise God hallelujah oh my the prophet said but if that tree keep praising him now but if that tree ever puts forth another original Branch it will bear its original Fruit the same fruit that was on Pentecost healings sealings deliverances baptism of the Holy Ghost it will bear the original Fruit and there's got to be a restoration of all these things right at the end of the vine the prophet said here's prophecy prophecy he said there is to come forth or restoration and evening light to light it up and make it right but it will come out of the vine not a denomination that's crafted into it but the original production of the word it is to comfort for the evening time there will be a light in the evening time it takes light to ripen it see how perfect the scripture is a day that won't be called day or night fruit cannot ripen here it is until the sun ripens it no matter how much you preach whatever you do it cannot be ripened it cannot be manifested it cannot be Vindicated only by him who said I am the light of the world the word isn't that right am so there it is it come forth as a power the prophet said therefore it has to come forth as a power the Holy Spirit himself not the work of man not men adopting one another nonsense but the Holy Spirit himself must ripen to vindicate and prove and manifest that what he said would happen oh glory to God the Holy Ghost is going to come forth in your heart in your life in your soul in this church as a power and anoint your soul the same original light this morning let there be light let there be light in your soul light in this church light in this Tabernacle we have received the word and the fullness of the spirit will pour out upon a bride in these last days and produce another Ephesians the prophet said on a paradox there must come another Ephesians to this another original church will have the same signs that Jesus had in the beginning we have the same signs that the apostles had in the beginning it was not the work of the Apostles but it was the acts of the Holy Ghost in the apostles your hands will be quickened your hearts will be quickened your bodies will be quickened your spirit your soul God will do a work of perfection in your heart in your life recognize your day recognize your message now we the sons of God do not appear what it shall be but we know that the devil has no power this morning the darkness is being pushed back lift up your
