[40:37] problem CU he says his sheep follow
[40:40] him and they hear his voice and he knows
[40:44] them and he also says he gives something
[40:47] unto them he give them eternal life and
[40:49] they shall never perish neither shall
[40:51] any man pluck them out of my hand so
[40:54] that's his commitment
[40:57] and for a
[40:58] title I have just three simple words
[41:01] when God
[41:02] speaks when God speaks cuz he wants to
[41:06] speak to you amen he wants to speak to
[41:09] us he wants to speak to me tonight amen
[41:12] and for a subject are you in a position
[41:16] to hear his
[41:18] voice are you in the right place that
[41:20] you could hear what he's saying to you
[41:22] tonight or is it when he's trying to
[41:25] communicate with you
[41:27] preoccupied with Facebook and Instagram
[41:30] and social media and movies and videos
[41:33] and he's just trying to have this
[41:35] relationship with
[41:37] you are you in a position to hear his
[41:41] voice when he
[41:43] speaks amen so that's what we want to
[41:46] share about
[41:47] tonight because no matter what we do no
[41:50] matter how much you achieve no matter
[41:52] how much you try no matter how difficult
[41:54] it gets you can can cry you could you
[41:57] could feel disappointed and
[41:59] distracted if you're not in the position
[42:02] to hear his voice you wouldn't hear
[42:05] it and the scripture says my sheep hear
[42:08] my voice so it means we must be in
[42:10] alignment to hear his voice
[42:14] amen so with that in
[42:18] mind the prophet in a message straight
[42:22] As the gate
[42:23] 59 paragraph 54 it says they for
[42:26] instance and this is referring to Jesus
[42:30] could not believe that God was in that
[42:32] man that was the biggest obstacle that
[42:35] they had to climb over was how him being
[42:38] man yet made himself God they couldn't
[42:41] see how God could dwell in human flesh
[42:43] and in all ages in all times God has
[42:46] always dwelt in Men in man sorry man is
[42:50] God's agent in every generation God
[42:53] speaks to his people through human lips
[42:56] he always chooses someone or something
[43:00] that he can use amen so he wants to
[43:03] speak to you tonight and in every
[43:05] generation he uses somebody or something
[43:08] to speak to you so he has a special
[43:11] message that he once spoken to you so we
[43:15] as his sheep should be interested in
[43:17] what message he has for us amen so today
[43:20] I'm I'm just going to show you quickly
[43:21] through scripture that God wants and he
[43:25] desires to speak to you so much that he
[43:28] has many many many many many ways and
[43:31] mechanisms and and and and and and
[43:34] channels that he will use in an effort
[43:36] to get to you like the Garden of Eden
[43:39] where you come in the cool of the
[43:40] evening and say Adam how was things how
[43:43] was everything I just came to check up I
[43:45] just want to know that everything is
[43:46] okay I just want to know that you know I
[43:49] provided you with the right resources
[43:51] and you're having a good time and you
[43:52] you're accomplishing and and you know
[43:54] what seems like a trial is is just my my
[43:57] desire to build your character a little
[43:58] more and I want you to get a little
[44:00] stronger so I know it hurts a little bit
[44:02] but it's okay if you just stick with it
[44:04] it's going to be all right and perhaps
[44:06] you failed the test and he sent it again
[44:08] you know in his wisdom he said I want
[44:10] you to do this over I want you to do it
[44:11] better next time that's all he wants to
[44:14] do so we don't have to put up a
[44:16] resistance but you know many times when
[44:19] we look a realize
[44:21] that if I were to say that you you have
[44:24] to become you have to come in a position
[44:27] to hear his voice it sounds like we have
[44:29] to do these things and and and what God
[44:32] really wants for me and and it sounds
[44:34] like a rule and and it sounds like God
[44:36] want to put me in a particular place and
[44:38] yes he does but you know what what is so
[44:41] interesting about this God I
[44:43] serve it doesn't matter what you think
[44:46] it really
[44:47] doesn't he is not dependent on your
[44:50] opinion of how he should work I remember
[44:53] one of the first quotes I ever heard
[44:55] when they would have released the
[44:57] electronic form of voice of God
[44:59] Recordings was you know he he would take
[45:02] something a big animal like an elephant
[45:05] a little bitty animal like a mouse and
[45:07] who's there to tell God what to do and
[45:09] how to do it we can't instruct God God
[45:12] determines how he want us to operate and
[45:15] we fit into that mold amen so with that
[45:19] said a reference Abraham and Sarah and I
[45:22] said it doesn't matter what you think
[45:23] and you know where I'm going with this
[45:27] in a
[45:33] message Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[45:36] and for yesterday today and forever this
[45:38] is 61 brother brandham spoke about
[45:41] Abraham and Sarah and he spoke about
[45:43] them in this way say paragraph 65 he
[45:46] said but this one stayed behind with
[45:48] Abraham referring to the angels who came
[45:49] to
[45:51] visit now remember he was a stranger had
[45:54] dust on his clothes he came from a
[45:56] foreign country year way away far and he
[46:01] says Abraham where's your wife Sarah how
[46:03] did you know that he was
[46:05] married and how did you know he had a
[46:07] wife named Sarah Abraham where is your
[46:10] wife Sarah now the Bible strictly states
[46:13] that he said she's in the tent behind
[46:15] you behind the angel the angel was God
[46:19] in human flesh am watch said she's in
[46:22] the tent behind you watch this I will
[46:25] visit you according to the time of life
[46:27] and Sarah laughed not obviously but
[46:30] within
[46:32] herself not out
[46:34] loud on the inside of the tent and with
[46:38] his back turned to the tent he said why
[46:40] did Sarah laugh what kind of a telepathy
[46:43] is that and we heard about telepathy
[46:45] last Sunday so he said what kind of
[46:47] telepathy is that what was it it was a
[46:51] sign that she's just ready to
[46:53] burn now he said as it was was in the
[46:56] days of Sodom and the world is in a
[46:59] Sodom condition now just before the fire
[47:02] fell the angel of the Lord comes back
[47:03] and dwell in human flesh and does the
[47:06] same sign to give the Gentiles the same
[47:11] Messianic sign it did to the Jews and
[47:13] the
[47:14] Samaritans amen do you see it he's got
[47:19] to if he lets this church Coast through
[47:21] on just me theology he'd give them a
[47:24] favor and a sign that he didn't permit
[47:26] to us and if God is the same and he is
[47:28] the same he will do the same and act the
[47:31] same to each one of his children and to
[47:34] every generation including ours he has
[47:36] to be the same and that was his sign in
[47:39] that day to the Jews Samaritans at the
[47:41] closing of their day this is the closing
[47:44] of our day the gospel returns again to
[47:47] the Jew pretty soon he's waiting right
[47:49] now for it just waiting for the sign to
[47:51] appear to him and then he will return
[47:55] which Elijah and Moses will do
[47:56] Revelation 11 amen so I think that
[47:59] clearly showed it didn't matter what
[48:01] Sarah thought it didn't matter her
[48:04] opinion God spoke that day and said I'll
[48:07] return according to the time of life you
[48:10] don't have a choice in the matter right
[48:13] and that's just the way God did it in
[48:16] that time you know there are times you
[48:18] need to be taught so this is another
[48:19] approach of God he so want to speak with
[48:22] you he not just leaving it like that he
[48:24] not leaving it up to ch
[48:26] he says sometimes you need to be taught
[48:29] because sometimes you don't
[48:31] know like the example with Samuel and
[48:33] Eli in 1st Samuel 3
[48:38] 4-10 and it says that the Lord called
[48:40] Samuel and he answered here am I and he
[48:43] ran unto Eli and said here am I here am
[48:46] I for thou called me and he says I
[48:49] called not lie down again and he went
[48:52] and laid down and the Lord called yet
[48:54] again Samuel and Samuel arose and went
[48:56] to Eli and said here am I for thou this
[48:59] called me and he answered I called not
[49:02] my son liong again now Samuel did not
[49:06] yet know the Lord neither was the word
[49:07] of the Lord yet revealed unto him and
[49:10] the Lord called Samuel again the third
[49:13] time and he arose and went to Eli and
[49:15] said here here am I for thou this called
[49:18] me and Eli perceived that the Lord had
[49:21] called the child keep in mind this child
[49:24] didn't understand the communication of
[49:26] God at that time so Eli said unto Samuel
[49:30] go lie down and it shall be if he calls
[49:33] thee that thou shalt say Speak Lord for
[49:36] thy servant heareth so Samuel went and
[49:39] laid down in his place and the Lord came
[49:42] and stood and called as at other times
[49:45] Samuel Samuel then Samuel answered speak
[49:49] for thy servant her it all he wants to
[49:52] do is speak with you to fellow
[49:55] fellowship with you to find out how
[49:57] you're doing because in any relationship
[50:00] if you don't communicate how are you
[50:02] really doing you're hoping that God
[50:05] could just do favors for you that's a
[50:07] kind of strain relationship huh you
[50:09] don't talk to him at all you don't pray
[50:12] you don't Fellowship you don't read his
[50:14] word you don't know what he likes and
[50:16] dislikes but when you need something you
[50:18] run to him is that the way we want to
[50:21] live so sometimes we need to learn and
[50:24] understand his voice and the way he
[50:26] wants to speak with
[50:27] you but one thing we must do above all
[50:30] else is approach with
[50:32] reverence so this is another approach
[50:35] Moses and the burning
[50:40] bush this one and you will see the
[50:42] relationship to Sunday's message again
[50:45] in a message God manifesting his gifts
[50:49] 57 paragraph s he said then we find him
[50:52] one day hurting his father-in-law sheep
[50:54] and you know the story coming down an
[50:56] old familiar part and all of a sudden
[50:58] his attention was attracted to some
[51:00] great
[51:02] phenomena that was a bush that was
[51:04] burning with fire and was not consumed
[51:06] and Moses never questioned the
[51:09] bush as we would today if if was today
[51:13] we it viral on Instagram it on Facebook
[51:16] we're creating some reals or some kind
[51:17] of thing
[51:19] yeah he just drew aside and walked up to
[51:22] it and wanted to find out what was going
[51:24] on and when he approached it reverently
[51:26] God spoke to
[51:28] him and when we approach God in the same
[51:31] manner God will speak to us so you want
[51:34] God to speak to you approach him with
[51:37] reverence but never in a critical way
[51:40] can we approach God and expect God to
[51:42] speak back to
[51:43] us we've got to approach him in a
[51:45] reverent way and that's why I said
[51:47] picking up from last Sunday's message
[51:49] perhaps what if Moses would have said
[51:52] being that I'm raised up as a scientist
[51:55] and as as a master in Egypt because he
[51:56] was trained in the ways of the Egyptians
[51:59] so he could have used that carnal
[52:01] knowledge at that point he said I've
[52:04] mastered all their Arts I will wait and
[52:06] find out when that fire goes off the
[52:08] bush I'll take some leaves and take it
[52:10] to the LA laboratory and find out just
[52:13] why those leaves didn't burn what kind
[52:15] of chemicals were on those leaves that
[52:18] would not burn in the great heat if he
[52:20] would have approached it in that
[52:22] standpoint in a scientific research God
[52:26] would would have never spoke to him
[52:28] that's the reason today that people
[52:29] doesn't get along with God as they
[52:31] should is because they are trying to
[52:33] scientifically prove everything and God
[52:36] is never known by science if you can
[52:38] prove God then there's no more Act of
[52:40] Faith you cannot prove God by science
[52:43] you've got to accept him by faith and
[52:45] you know faith comes from hearing by
[52:48] hearing the word of God Amen therefore M
[52:51] Moses Drew up with a willing heart to
[52:54] understand and God SP spoke to Moses and
[52:56] said take off your shoes for the ground
[52:58] you stand on is Holy Ground Moses
[53:00] removed his
[53:03] shoes Moses removed his shoes and God
[53:06] talked to Moses Moses learned more in
[53:09] five minutes time in the
[53:11] presence of that fire than he learned in
[53:14] 40 years of education he knew more about
[53:17] God in five minutes in the presence of
[53:19] that light than he did in 40 years
[53:22] studying and schooling how his mother
[53:24] had taught him and he would have been
[53:26] emancipator of the of Egypt all these
[53:29] things that has been taught by his
[53:31] mother and by teachers and by schools
[53:33] and yet he knew more about God in five
[53:35] minutes in the presence of that light
[53:37] and that's the power of approaching god
[53:40] with reverence amen so God could speak
[53:43] to
[53:44] him you know in another example said
[53:48] some sometimes you'll be forced some
[53:51] sometimes he'll Force his way on you you
[53:53] know when he wants to speak to you he he
[53:55] don't care what what you're doing he not
[53:57] waiting for you to turn aside he not
[53:58] waiting for you to pause you're busy no
[54:01] problem if he wants to talk to you he
[54:03] talking to you still regardless of where
[54:05] you are what time it is who you around
[54:08] whe whether at a family function whe
[54:11] they think it's Valentine's it doesn't
[54:13] matter if you want to speak to you
[54:15] tonight nobody could stop that Saul on
[54:18] his way to Damascus thought he was on a
[54:20] mission sometimes I said God will force
[54:23] his his his his hand to speak to you he
[54:25] said in in Acts 93-6 he said and as he
[54:29] journeyed he came near Damascus and
[54:31] suddenly there shined wrong about him a
[54:33] light from heaven and he fell to the
[54:35] Earth and heard a voice saying unto him
[54:37] Saul Saul why persecuted thou me it
[54:40] didn't matter who he was it didn't
[54:43] matter how powerful what rank he had God
[54:46] was ready to speak to him at that point
[54:49] and nothing could stop it in verse 5 and
[54:51] he said who art thou Lord and the Lord
[54:54] said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest it
[54:58] is hard for thee to kick against the
[54:59] Pricks and he trembling and astonished
[55:02] said Lord what will thou have me to do
[55:05] and Lord said unto him arise and go into
[55:07] the City and it shall be told thee what
[55:09] thou must do you see so it doesn't
[55:11] matter what attitude you have who you
[55:13] think you are he is no respector of
[55:15] persons when he's ready to speak to you
[55:18] he's going to do it as as a prophet if
[55:20] love can't do it conditions will he will
[55:23] flip you upside down because he want to
[55:25] have a conversation with you you could
[55:28] run but you can't hide when he's ready
[55:30] to have you settle down he will and
[55:33] there's nothing you could do about
[55:36] it you know often
[55:39] times we look at the loud we look at we
[55:42] look at The Bold and the brave but
[55:44] sometimes he he communicates in secret
[55:46] you know amen sometimes he talking to
[55:48] the sister next to you and you feel like
[55:50] nothing is going on because you're not
[55:52] hearing anything you're not seeing
[55:54] anything he's doing it in secret so I'll
[55:55] give you an example of
[55:57] that in the Book of Matthew chap 16:
[56:01] 13-18 it says when Jesus came into the
[56:04] coast of cesaria Philippi he asked his
[56:07] disciples saying whom do men say that I
[56:10] the son of
[56:11] manam and they said some say that thou
[56:14] are John the Baptist some Elias and
[56:16] others Jeremiah or one of the prophets
[56:19] he said unto them but whom say ye that I
[56:21] am that was his question to
[56:23] them now I'm sure sure he knew that he
[56:26] didn't tell them at the side or he
[56:28] didn't tell them in advance it was not
[56:30] test and he give them a practice test
[56:32] before but the next thing may have
[56:34] surprised some he said and Simon Peter
[56:36] answered and said Thou Art the Christ
[56:40] the son of the Living God and Jesus
[56:42] answered and said unto him blessed art
[56:45] thou Simon Barona for Flesh and Blood
[56:48] had not reveal it unto thee but my
[56:51] Father which is in heaven and I say also
[56:55] unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon
[56:58] This Rock I will build my church and the
[57:00] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[57:03] it nobody else knew no other disciple no
[57:07] friend no family no acquaintance knew
[57:10] that Peter got a revelation of who Jesus
[57:13] was but God spoke to Peter God spoke to
[57:17] Peter's heart so he knew something he
[57:18] got a revelation that nobody else had
[57:21] because he wanted to I'm saying we can't
[57:24] tell God how to operate he will do what
[57:26] he wants how he wants when he wants
[57:28] whether we like it or not whether we
[57:30] want it or not when he wants to talk to
[57:32] you he wants to talk to you when he has
[57:34] a message for you he has a message for
[57:36] you he don't care how busy you are he
[57:38] don't care what you're doing there are
[57:39] times he might ignore you but if he
[57:41] wants you you are the man for the job
[57:43] you know like like Jonah no matter where
[57:46] he went what he did he was the man for
[57:48] the job he couldn't run he couldn't hide
[57:52] he might have dug a tunnel and and and
[57:54] say you know what nobody could find me
[57:55] God was still going to find a way to use
[57:57] him because that was his man at the time
[57:59] that was his man for the job that guy
[58:01] was predestinated to do that Moses was
[58:04] the same Elijah was the same Isaiah was
[58:07] the same Daniel was the same there is no
[58:09] way Joseph was going to escape that
[58:11] Egypt root no matter what he tried no
[58:13] matter what he did God wanted him in a
[58:15] particular place and nothing no
[58:18] circumstance no boss no work colleague
[58:21] somebody talk bad about you and give you
[58:23] a bad appraisal it can't can't change
[58:25] the destiny that God has in store for
[58:27] you it cannot hinder it may seem to you
[58:31] that things not working out and they
[58:33] don't like me but it's because God don't
[58:34] want you there he has better for you he
[58:37] owns the the cattle on a thousand hills
[58:40] he don't even want you worrying about
[58:42] that and what the neighbor don't like
[58:44] you God don't want you in that
[58:45] neighborhood he wants you to move out
[58:48] that's why they troubling you amen so
[58:52] sometimes he works in secret
[58:57] you know at other times you need to wait
[59:01] until God don't rush you you
[59:04] know like like recently so so they said
[59:07] they were monitoring somebody for for a
[59:09] year and watching the social media
[59:11] activity and now the punks and they give
[59:12] them some
[59:14] charges it's not you do a crime now and
[59:17] they run and they bust down your door
[59:19] they monitor you for a while they gather
[59:21] the evidence and then they decide you
[59:23] know what are going to throw the whole
[59:25] book at you Butz they don't want you
[59:27] escape and most times it's not one
[59:29] charge just do multiple so even if one
[59:31] fail they catch you
[59:33] still sometimes that's how it works God
[59:37] will wait on you you let your run your
[59:40] run let you go as far as you want to go
[59:44] as as they a long time every long rope
[59:46] have a end you could run you could hide
[59:49] you could play yourself at the end of
[59:50] the day when you're ready for you he
[59:52] ready for you that's just the way he is
[59:55] so you
[59:56] know I use Daniel as the example thought
[1:00:00] it was a fine example in a message he
[1:00:03] his voice
[1:00:04] 58 here brother brandom talking about
[1:00:07] Daniel he said Daniel down in Babylon as
[1:00:10] we spoke of him last night he had
[1:00:12] purposed in his heart that he will not
[1:00:14] defile himself with the Babylonian
[1:00:16] Doctrine so he not going to allow at a
[1:00:19] time he not heing onto himself you know
[1:00:22] anybody teachers having itching and just
[1:00:25] listening to doctrines and things that
[1:00:27] they have that sound nice but one day
[1:00:29] down there Daniel got in need and he
[1:00:32] knowed he wanted to hear the voice of
[1:00:35] God so you mean you should have a desire
[1:00:38] to hear God speak you should have a
[1:00:41] desire to be in position so when God
[1:00:44] talk you could catch it one time you
[1:00:45] could hear it one time so that could
[1:00:47] activate the faith in your soul that he
[1:00:49] put there one time so he had a
[1:00:53] desire
[1:00:55] he wanted to hear the voice of God yet
[1:00:58] he had the scriptures but he needed to
[1:01:00] hear the voice of God not just wanted he
[1:01:02] needed that and he went down to the such
[1:01:06] River and he just didn't go down there
[1:01:09] and park his Chariot and needle down in
[1:01:11] the bull rushes and say Lord God I want
[1:01:13] to hear you where you at no that's not
[1:01:15] what he
[1:01:17] did you don't do it that
[1:01:21] way well he took his Chariot and the
[1:01:23] drivers and and he went down to the
[1:01:25] river and he sent them back so he
[1:01:27] allowed them to take him and he tell
[1:01:30] them well go ahead I good I save all
[1:01:33] right I spending some time by the river
[1:01:36] he sent them back he was going to stay
[1:01:38] till he heard you hear that till he
[1:01:41] heard Bram said that's the way he got
[1:01:44] desperate about it he had to get Plum
[1:01:48] away from all the soldiers all the
[1:01:50] astronomers all the wise men all the
[1:01:52] doctors of Theology and so for that was
[1:01:55] trying to tell him this you do this
[1:01:57] Daniel you do this Daniel but he got
[1:01:59] away from all of it that's the way you
[1:02:02] got to do amen and he got down on that
[1:02:05] River and he stayed there for 21 days
[1:02:08] wrestling with the angel of the Lord but
[1:02:10] we're told that he looked out upon the
[1:02:12] Water there he saw an angel standing
[1:02:14] with his foot on the land and the Sea
[1:02:16] and raised up his hands and swore by him
[1:02:18] that lives forever and ever when the
[1:02:20] things that Daniel saw come to pass time
[1:02:23] shall be no more he had been delayed 21
[1:02:26] days because of the evil of the land and
[1:02:29] if he was delayed and this is the
[1:02:31] prophet speaking he said if he was
[1:02:33] delayed 21 days because of the evil of
[1:02:35] the land of that land in the days of
[1:02:39] Persia what would he be in this
[1:02:43] day how long could he be delayed but
[1:02:46] that undying faith that hunger that
[1:02:49] desire in the human heart that wouldn't
[1:02:51] say no to God but will hold on till God
[1:02:55] speaks from Heaven you can't play with
[1:02:58] this you can't play with this gospel
[1:03:01] it's not to be played with it must hit
[1:03:04] the tack 10 times out of 10 it's got to
[1:03:06] be perfect or it isn't right or it won't
[1:03:09] work it's got to be perfect Daniel
[1:03:12] Prayed and I put a note here he was
[1:03:13] willing to stay however long it took he
[1:03:16] was willing to do whatever it took until
[1:03:19] he heard from God so sometimes it's not
[1:03:21] instant but you have to wait you have to
[1:03:23] T you have to be willing to sacrifice
[1:03:26] and see God move and allow God to speak
[1:03:29] in his own time
[1:03:32] amenl
[1:03:34] amen I have a note here you know and all
[1:03:38] these are different ways that God is
[1:03:40] going to speak to people God wants to
[1:03:43] commune with you God wants to share his
[1:03:46] his love gifts you know he want to say
[1:03:48] listen here what I find you're doing
[1:03:49] real good but what I want you to do do
[1:03:51] this different so I realize you you
[1:03:55] really you follow all the Commandments
[1:03:56] and you you know you listen to all the
[1:03:59] the preaching and teaching and you
[1:04:01] attend all the prayer meeting but what
[1:04:03] lack you yet I want you to do X Y and Z
[1:04:06] because it might be different for
[1:04:07] everybody he knows what you have need of
[1:04:11] he knows the trials he want to send you
[1:04:15] but I know in your heart you're hiding
[1:04:18] so you're busy you have all kind of
[1:04:20] things occupying your time but all you
[1:04:22] want to do is to some sometimes tell
[1:04:24] your hey you you did real
[1:04:26] good you do real good you know there are
[1:04:29] times when and I saying this in
[1:04:30] relationships your wife say listen I
[1:04:32] want to talk talk to you and as a man
[1:04:35] you
[1:04:37] say you want to talk to me what you want
[1:04:41] to say what you want to tell and she
[1:04:44] tell you this in the morning but she has
[1:04:45] say nothing for the
[1:04:47] day and whole day you une
[1:04:50] easy and all she want to tell you is
[1:04:52] that I appreciate the way you Wasing she
[1:04:54] wears yesterday you
[1:04:55] know sometimes God want to tell you good
[1:04:58] things he want to share blessings and
[1:05:01] secrets and things that he have in store
[1:05:03] for you but instead you running and
[1:05:05] hiding and
[1:05:11] ducking Sometimes some people will only
[1:05:14] respond and will only hear and only put
[1:05:17] themselves in position when fire comes
[1:05:20] in the still small small voes to
[1:05:26] easy the burning bush too too exciting
[1:05:29] they don't want to respond to that so he
[1:05:31] had a send some fire the fire had to
[1:05:34] burn you that to touch
[1:05:36] you that's the next example I'll
[1:05:39] use now brother brandham in a message
[1:05:42] hear his voice
[1:05:44] 58 talking about
[1:05:46] Isaiah he said and he got down in the
[1:05:48] temple and he realized then he raised
[1:05:50] his hands and said oh God I'm a man of
[1:05:52] unclean lips
[1:05:54] you think you're good but wait till that
[1:05:56] time comes I dwell among peoples of
[1:05:59] unclean lips what did he he got
[1:06:02] desperate and when you get desperate
[1:06:04] about this thing something will take
[1:06:06] place so it's obvious you're not
[1:06:08] desperate enough you're not desperate
[1:06:10] enough to hear from God for God to speak
[1:06:12] to you because if you're desperate
[1:06:14] enough you'll realize I am
[1:06:16] nothing I am no good I can't achieve
[1:06:20] anything in in myself on my own God
[1:06:23] don't need me
[1:06:26] he said when you get desperate about
[1:06:28] that thing something will take place
[1:06:29] you're not desperate enough oh well I
[1:06:31] join church that settles it but you have
[1:06:34] to be desperate about it you have to
[1:06:36] really need God Jesus said blessed are
[1:06:39] they that hunger and thirst after
[1:06:41] righteousness for they shall be
[1:06:45] filled but as long as you're satisfied
[1:06:47] with the things of the world how can God
[1:06:49] ever really speak to you you say God
[1:06:52] never spoke to me why he wants to but
[1:06:56] you're too filled up with things of the
[1:06:57] world that's what's the matter with us
[1:07:01] we put all our time on things of the
[1:07:03] world and the pleasures of the world and
[1:07:04] give no time to God it's true now we
[1:07:07] find out that Isaiah got
[1:07:10] desperate and he screamed out and
[1:07:12] confessed his sins and confessed the
[1:07:14] sins of the people and when he got
[1:07:16] through confessing he heard a noise
[1:07:18] above him and when he looked up there
[1:07:20] was the cherubims flying back and forth
[1:07:23] through the Wings over their faces Wings
[1:07:25] over their feet flying with wings crying
[1:07:28] holy holy holy Lord God Almighty
[1:07:31] something was taking place Isaiah got
[1:07:34] desperate God come on the job and Isaiah
[1:07:37] screamed I have unclean lips for a voice
[1:07:40] had just spoke it changed him who will
[1:07:43] go for us said the Voice who will go who
[1:07:46] is willing to stand in the breach among
[1:07:49] this bunch of theologians who will go in
[1:07:51] this day and claim that I'm still God
[1:07:54] amen amen who will go and condemn their
[1:07:57] uncleanness who will tear down their
[1:08:05] denominations and build the powers of
[1:08:07] the Living God
[1:08:08] again who will go Isaiah said Lord
[1:08:11] before I can go I've got to be
[1:08:14] alternate some of these little fears and
[1:08:17] fluster had to leave him so will it be
[1:08:21] with every individual God calls you
[1:08:23] think Moes when God called him he was
[1:08:25] just Brave and B and said I going down
[1:08:26] to Egypt you know because I spent 40
[1:08:28] years no he said listen I can't even
[1:08:32] talk this is a man that was perhaps
[1:08:35] second in command of all of Egypt would
[1:08:39] say I not qualified for this thing I
[1:08:42] able I can't face pharaoh and the Army
[1:08:45] and and all the politicians they have
[1:08:47] there they say everyone God called they
[1:08:50] have a little thing to shake off they
[1:08:52] still have to fix that's why there's a
[1:08:54] five-fold Ministry you know because God
[1:08:56] wants a Perfect Bride he wants to see
[1:09:00] listen Mastery in motion he wants to see
[1:09:03] when you step out he could see a
[1:09:05] reflection of himself he could say there
[1:09:07] is my beloved Son there's my beloved
[1:09:10] daughter they have all the attributes
[1:09:13] they could sign as good as me they could
[1:09:16] express just the way I
[1:09:21] would he said so it be with every
[1:09:24] individual God calls you got to be born
[1:09:27] again changed and made new not
[1:09:29] imagination but from your heart
[1:09:31] something that really takes place and
[1:09:33] one of the Angels if you ask you shall
[1:09:35] receive one of the angels went over to
[1:09:38] the Brazen Altar and took the tongues
[1:09:40] and reach over and got a coal of living
[1:09:42] fire and ran over to isai and placed it
[1:09:45] in his mouth said now you're clean go
[1:09:48] speak the word Isaiah was changed after
[1:09:52] he heard that voice
[1:09:55] only when the fire came then you could
[1:09:57] see that's the change he needed it
[1:10:00] wasn't just
[1:10:06] talk at the end of the day clearly God
[1:10:10] is is is ready to do whatever he has to
[1:10:12] do to speak to you he will accomplish
[1:10:16] whatsoever he desires whatever he set
[1:10:19] forth to accomplish he will whatever he
[1:10:22] wants to achieve he will no matter what
[1:10:25] the scenario looks like or what he has
[1:10:26] to do where he have to put you or what
[1:10:28] he have to shift around he will do
[1:10:30] whatever it takes to get to you because
[1:10:33] he loves you because he cares for you
[1:10:36] because he wants what's best for you
[1:10:39] because he wants to have fellowship with
[1:10:41] you because he wants to communicate and
[1:10:44] have such a relationship with you he
[1:10:47] wants to speak to you like Adam you know
[1:10:49] he wants to come and say listen how how
[1:10:51] things started off this year is the
[1:10:54] second month things all right you're
[1:10:56] paying the bills you're getting time to
[1:10:59] pray you're reading the
[1:11:01] Bible he wants to know that you're doing
[1:11:04] okay he wants to have that relationship
[1:11:07] with you he wants to know your troubles
[1:11:10] and your struggles and what you think is
[1:11:12] too much so he can give you that
[1:11:13] reassurance that
[1:11:15] listen those are the things I allow you
[1:11:17] know those are the things I I I want you
[1:11:20] to go through cuz I know when you come
[1:11:22] through you'll be better off
[1:11:24] can you imagine Joseph and how he might
[1:11:27] have complained look I have all these
[1:11:28] dreams and I know I gifted here but look
[1:11:31] at me I in
[1:11:33] jail jail how how I end up
[1:11:40] here but that wasn't the
[1:11:43] attitude God has a journey to to pass
[1:11:46] him through to get him to where he was
[1:11:48] supposed to
[1:11:49] be God knew exactly how he would feel
[1:11:53] God God knew exactly the mechanisms and
[1:11:55] methods he would use to get him
[1:11:59] there so it's not for us to complain
[1:12:02] there's a reason why the children of God
[1:12:03] went through the Wilderness for that
[1:12:05] period you know to to go around for 40
[1:12:09] years and that I believe was a two-day
[1:12:12] trip you
[1:12:13] know they roll around for 40 years
[1:12:18] know because God knew what was in them
[1:12:21] couldn't take them into the promised
[1:12:22] land you know he knew they couldn't go
[1:12:24] with without him that baggage was too
[1:12:27] great it would risk his reputation too
[1:12:29] much because he knew you had to conquer
[1:12:32] every city every opposition every he out
[1:12:35] there would have been defeated but not
[1:12:37] with his
[1:12:38] group so he spent them around for 40
[1:12:41] years for the children to go
[1:12:45] over and that was his
[1:12:50] way I did say I wouldn't be long tonight
[1:12:53] musicians could get
[1:12:55] ready at the end of the
[1:13:00] day he want you to hear his
[1:13:03] voice in a message hear his
[1:13:07] voice Bram in paragraph 61 he said would
[1:13:10] there be some here he said this morning
[1:13:14] but I want to say
[1:13:15] tonight which I know there is that would
[1:13:18] say Lord be merciful unto
[1:13:22] me joined church I've I've made a
[1:13:25] confession but I don't know what it is
[1:13:28] to get quiet before you and to hear your
[1:13:31] voice leading me and teaching me and
[1:13:34] guiding me and showing me what you have
[1:13:37] in store for me where you really want me
[1:13:39] to go is there anybody like that
[1:13:44] tonight I wouldn't know what to do if
[1:13:46] you should speak in an audible voice you
[1:13:48] feel that way if God were to speak
[1:13:50] tonight at an audible voice what would
[1:13:52] you do
[1:13:54] how would you respond how would you
[1:13:59] react if God said i' love to know
[1:14:02] you you know that you could speak to me
[1:14:06] and and and you want God to direct your
[1:14:09] path to direct your
[1:14:11] life you to say in all th ways
[1:14:15] acknowledge Him and He will direct your
[1:14:19] path your life different when he Direct
[1:14:22] in your path
[1:14:23] your attitude is different when he
[1:14:25] directing your part you're not operating
[1:14:27] by Guess anymore you're operating with
[1:14:30] the assurance that this is where he want
[1:14:32] you to be at this
[1:14:34] point that's why the scripture say for
[1:14:36] we know that all things work together
[1:14:40] for good to them that love God to them
[1:14:44] who are called according to his purpose
[1:14:47] because he purposed for you to be here
[1:14:50] tonight he purposed for you to be a
[1:14:52] particular place in in your life right
[1:14:54] now not to complain not to be
[1:14:57] frustrated but because he loves you he
[1:15:00] wants you here am you know you have
[1:15:02] heard it preach many many times
[1:15:04] sometimes God God bless you with a car
[1:15:07] and you everywhere except
[1:15:09] church he bless you with a house and and
[1:15:12] you you in the house more than you're
[1:15:16] working and all of a sudden these
[1:15:18] materialistic thing become Idols before
[1:15:20] you and we question why Lord why why you
[1:15:24] don't give me a little more why you
[1:15:25] don't bless me like you bless my brother
[1:15:27] why you don't do this like you bless my
[1:15:29] sister but God knows you he know listen
[1:15:33] he who is faithful in little faithful in
[1:15:35] much if he give you too much he might
[1:15:37] spoil you you may not be in a position
[1:15:41] to handle that yet so he had to pass you
[1:15:44] through a little longer he had to to to
[1:15:47] mold you a little more before you could
[1:15:49] really be in a position to manage that
[1:15:53] you need to die out a little bit a
[1:15:55] little bit more he knows deep in your
[1:15:57] heart the kind of Pride you have not
[1:15:59] right here you might say all the right
[1:16:02] things but you can't see that from the
[1:16:05] outside you know the kind of greed you
[1:16:07] have on the inside your brother don't
[1:16:09] know about it your sister don't know
[1:16:12] about it your neighbor don't know but
[1:16:13] it's on the inside amen like that Rich
[1:16:17] Young Ruler when when he say what lack I
[1:16:18] at and he say listen go go sell what you
[1:16:21] have Jesus knew exactly what the matter
[1:16:24] was you know he knew the issues he had
[1:16:27] right he didn't loow him up and go go on
[1:16:30] Facebook and Instagram and say look look
[1:16:32] who come and talk to mina no he didn't
[1:16:33] do
[1:16:35] that but he tried to address it in that
[1:16:37] particular way knowing the result he
[1:16:40] wanted and the Bible said Jesus loved
[1:16:43] him you know it wasn't a malicious thing
[1:16:46] he did you know he loved him his heart
[1:16:48] went out to him he really wanted better
[1:16:51] for him just like he wants for us he
[1:16:53] loves us to know imagine we were
[1:16:57] failures we were gone we were nothing
[1:17:00] but he still reach down throughout the 1
[1:17:03] almost 5 million in Trinidad to come if
[1:17:06] you look at Trinidad on a map it's a DOT
[1:17:09] he came to that dot just to find you
[1:17:12] your mother and father not even in
[1:17:14] church and he came just for you he
[1:17:17] inspired your coworker 20 years ago just
[1:17:20] to testify to you because he wanted you
[1:17:23] to hear his word and to share with you
[1:17:25] the love gifts he had for
[1:17:27] you how grateful we ought to be to know
[1:17:30] that this was his plan all
[1:17:33] along and you want to be frustrated and
[1:17:36] upset and you vexed because they put you
[1:17:38] in a SE that you don't like no no no no
[1:17:41] no no how could I compare to the glory
[1:17:45] he have stored up for you how could we
[1:17:48] compare that the kind of love he has for
[1:17:51] us no matter how we we fail and we fall
[1:17:54] and we we we we do things that might
[1:17:56] bring displeasure to him but he still
[1:17:58] reach out and forgive and sustain and
[1:18:01] keep and provide for us regardless to
[1:18:04] think so many persons that were here 10
[1:18:07] years ago are no longer here but you are
[1:18:09] here for such a time as this for this
[1:18:17] time he say would you raise your hand
[1:18:19] just now and say God be
[1:18:21] merciful the Lord bless you everywhere
[1:18:24] hands everywhere just continue putting
[1:18:26] them up that's right Lord be merciful
[1:18:28] unto me I need you so much would there
[1:18:32] be some more just before closing God
[1:18:35] sees your hands back there lady all you
[1:18:38] weigh in the back and standing in a rose
[1:18:40] and so forth God sees you even at home
[1:18:42] or on the Internet watching the stream
[1:18:45] God sees you he knows your heart he
[1:18:47] understands what's going on with
[1:18:51] you just like Samuel said Eli did you
[1:18:54] call me Eli said no I never called you
[1:18:57] that wasn't me that spoke to your heart
[1:19:00] friend that was God just speak back and
[1:19:03] say thy servant
[1:19:05] heareth and take me into your care today
[1:19:08] God ask him to speak to you just speak
[1:19:12] back and say thy servant hear it and you
[1:19:15] take me into your care today let me from
[1:19:17] this day be holy thine you could play to
[1:19:20] be like
[1:19:21] Jesus
[1:19:25] Eternal God
[1:19:27] lover of the Soul creator of all things
[1:19:31] while that still small voice of God that
[1:19:33] spoke to Samuel that spoke to Saul that
[1:19:35] spoke to Peter that spoke to Daniel and
[1:19:38] Isaiah the prophet and all down Through
[1:19:41] the Ages has spoken again tonight in the
[1:19:44] Tabernacle perhaps maybe 30 or 40 or 50
[1:19:49] hands or Sinners church members whoever
[1:19:51] it may be people with frustrations raise
