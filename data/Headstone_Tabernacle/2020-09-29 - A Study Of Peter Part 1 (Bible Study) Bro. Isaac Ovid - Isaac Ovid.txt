lord need an encouragement may you encourage them tonight we commit the service into your hands in the precious name of jesus christ amen and amen amen certainly great to be here tonight and thanking god for another opportunity it's a humbling experience to stand before you or sit before you or to meet in this way um in such a time as this and uh trust in god that he could help us tonight uh i covered over a short while ago uh somehow the internet these days i don't know i guess everybody connected to something so um i was having some connectivity challenges but we are trusting god tonight and um so we will go as long as he wants us to go and we will fellowship around the world tonight and uh trust that you're encouraged i trust that you're on fire i trust that you're looking the trials square in the face i trust that you're not letting these situations knock you out i trust that you're seeing what's happening around you as as a training ground this is not the final test huh there's a difference between the training ground and the final exam you know this is this is not the final exam this is all training ground this is still beer and lion category um goliath's still coming so i want to challenge your feet i want to encourage you that you are stronger than you realize and it is only the experiences of life can show what's in you and in this study tonight by the grace of god we might see one or two things that deal with that but i realize more and more um as i look into the word is the more i realize how much i don't know is the more i realize how insufficient we really are without god um and that we need him more more than we even realized you know there's a saying you you don't know what you don't know you know and i was having a conversation with over a day or so ago and i was saying the more i study it is not that you end up with more questions but you realize how god thinks so way above our thinking in so much of the bible say his thoughts are above our thoughts now when you start to look and say i wonder why god did this and and and not everything you could figure out because the secret things belong to god and he chooses from his secret things to reveal things to us the things that we need to live and those things which are revealed they belong to us and they belong at our children and it's an encouragement to us that he sees more than we could see you know our our site will always be limited you know sometimes it's only in hindsight when we look back we could kind of figure things out but he doesn't have to wait on hindsight he has for knowledge which is foresight the ability to see before it even plays out and knows how it connects and all the pieces would connect and that is where fate and trust comes in that we could trust him when we cannot see because if we could see everything there will be no need for faith but faith is needed because we have not been given that sight to see everything before us and even to his prophets we saw it with brother ranum we saw it even with elisha with the shunammite when he openly declared the lord did not show me this i don't know what this is so he himself is not that because he was a prophet he was given the the sight for everything around him god knew and god knows what he wants to show and what he doesn't want to show you know so but certainly those things which are revealed to us those things which are made clear to us you know we have a certain attitude about it a certain approach to it a certain way we approach things because once your eyes are open uh you cannot go back to where it was before it's like a chicken you know or a bird that breaks out of an egg once you break all the egg shell there's nothing you could do to put that chicken or that bird back in the shell anymore because it has reached a point where it has outgrown that shell you know and when the revelation of the word has come to you to such a spot that you realize that you are more than a conqueror and greatest in you and you break out of the shell of fear and you break out of the shell of doubt and you break regularly shell of of being insecure like oh gideon felt felt you know and the least tribe believes in my family and and but when he broke out of that and and god said use your name as well the sword of the lord and of gideon you co-sign in this thing you know that is a level of of confirmation that your calling your predestination your election has nothing to do with you and that to me is something that is encouraging to us to us all our calling our election our predestination we have nothing to do with it it is all by the sovereign grace of god not just the grace of god you know the sovereign grace of god and i said it in in praying his sovereignty and his grace doesn't need permission you imagine if god choosing you needed permission from somebody think of somebody who who who you know get along too well with who you know really wouldn't have me they may not have the best thing to say about you and god went to them and say should i like this one you know some of us wouldn't be in this room you know but god suffering grace he didn't look to anybody else when he picked us when he chose us when he called us you know so by the grace of god tonight you know i was kind of you know trying to find trying to catch the mind of christ for what what to do tonight and um so um i have personally found um every bible study to be different and it will continue to be different and i realize that you can't even start to even exhaust this thing but tonight i want to i want to call it at the at the risk of getting myself in trouble because i i remember i did a study of danielle and i call it part one and part two has not yet arrived um but it's because i know that that you can't call it just a study of danielle because there's so much to it you couldn't cover it in one sitting you know but tonight i want to call it a study of peter part one because i know it will have more to it but i want to just have a conversation about peter around peter um and kind of look at the life of peter a little bit is we don't have the time to delve into it tonight you know there are many characters in scripture that we speak about in passing even the last few sessions we did kind of revolved around the life of elisha but there is only so much we have of the life of elisha itself you know emphasis is placed on yeshua might woman there's more focus on what's around the prophet than the prophet himself he's a common theme in these situations but a lot of time and effort and energy is spent around him when you look at the old testament there are many biblical characters that we know just a snapshot of their lives you know and and it's one of the reasons i really like the story of david because david is somebody we see as a little boy we see him growing up we see him as a king and we see him all the way as an old man you know on on on his dead bed as it were we get a whole you know a whole fifty thousand foot view of his life and and i find in the new testament peter to be something like that as well um out of all of the disciples who were there with jesus there is no one to whom more attention is given than peter and i find peter to be an interesting study and and to kind of get into it tonight i want to kind of start closer to the end before we rewind a little bit so i want us to start uh from actually first peter uh first peter verse one and i just want to kind of lay a context and then kind of go back a little bit to kind of pick up some points in his life and then one specific incident that took place that i want us to just look at and see how we see our own life and our christian journey in that particular situation so this part is a i find it to be a fate building part um and then we're going to kind of get into more of a you know meditating pattern on what the word is trying to show us here so we're going to read from first peter 1 and from verse one peter an apostle of jesus christ to the strangers scattered throughout pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bifinia and i i i like it because when you look at this in the the amplified um let me just read verse two before i go there elect according to the full knowledge of god the father so he is he is speaking on the recipients of this letter he is calling the elect according to the full knowledge of god the father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling the blood of jesus christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied what a salutation what a way to introduce a letter what a way to place in context the grace of god the mercy of god and in the in the in the amplified it says it like this peter an apostle and it goes on special messenger personally chosen representative of jesus christ so those elect listen here now both jewish and gentile believers that that he's calling their strangers who live as exiles scattered throughout pontus galatia cappadocia asia minor and bithya who are chosen according to the full knowledge of god the father by the sanctifying work of the spirit listen to be obedient to jesus christ you see what we are called to to be obedient to jesus christ and and and verse three so now he's going blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundant mercy had begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead so that lively hope is by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead two verse four an inheritance incorruptible an inheritance that cannot be defiled an inheritance that cannot be destroyed that cannot be changed in the ambition on the fallen on feeding so it is value that your dwarf will wonder about can the church say amen to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fear is not away reserved in heaven for you you know many times i get caught up in what's going on here and you realize you have an inheritance reserved you ever went to a place and and you say i could sit here they said no that city is reserved that no matter what time the person comes for that reserve seat they got to worry about where they sit down because it is reserved so to your inheritance is reserved in heaven for you that is that should we warming up with them so if if if that ain't making you rejoice yet we'll go into more rejoicing stuff but just know just know if you didn't think about it for the entire day and if you first time here infidelity you have an inheritance with your name in it it's reserved it is not for an angel it is not for another brother it's not for another sister it is an inheritance that reserved for you so i do have to look at your inheritance because i have my own inheritance i'd have to wonder but by the mic inheritance because i have my own in it i don't know what what about brother popular inheritance because i am minor i want my inheritance anybody with me tonight first five who are kept by the power of god true faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time so so this is showing sister pauline that the keeping the keeping who is keeping you is not yourself there's nothing you and i could do to keep ourselves but i say who are kept by the power of god true faith under salvation ready to be revealed in the last time all right we're warming into something here wherein he greatly rejoiced though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations so so peter is saying even though now for a little while if necessary you have been distressed by various trials is there anybody distressed by various trials peter is saying that is just for a season the distressing of these various trials is just for a season these trials are just for a season and and it also has has a purpose verse 7 that the trial of your fate being much more precious than of gold that perish it though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of jesus christ can the church say men amen amen amen so i just want to kind of kind of skip down because i want to what i'm touching on is a couple high points of peter before we kind of go back a little bit right so i want to go now to to a familiar scripture let's go to second peter a very very familiar scripture to us ii peter verse uh chapter one verse one simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious fate with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according as his divine power had given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness so this is past tense a half-given is past tense given unto us all things that pertain under life and godliness through the knowledge of him that had called us to glory and virtue so through the knowledge of him so the more you get to know him is how you access this that he has already done which is why it's so important for us to come into fellowship like this to read study and meditate the word because the final objective is to read that level where you could meditate until this word becomes your word and you can't meditate on what you don't know what you've never experienced or what you never read about so by us coming together in these studies and you're coming to service and you're connecting and you're reading the prophets messing on the books is to come to an awareness of the knowledge of him not as just have knowledge but to know him as in by experience as well because once you get to know him and you have the knowledge of him now he can access that which he has already done given us all things and whenever the bible say all is not some all things put into life and godliness not godliness only but life and godliness god is interested in your daily walk he's interested in your daily life he's interested in what happened this morning he's interested in how you're when to work he's interested if you're working from at home he's interested in how you pay your bills he's interested in whether you have a mortgage or not having a mortgage all of these things are important to god because you're part of his family anybody with me tonight whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and now we come into our scripture and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance at the temperance patience and the patient's godliness and the godliness broadly kindness at the barley kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that he shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that luckett these things is blind and cannot see afar off and had forgotten that he was pulled from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence this is what we're doing to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ wherefore listen i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them so i'm speaking to you do you know them i would not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things so peter is saying forgive me but i will be reminding you and i will be reminding you even though you know it already i i will not be negligent to come back and remind you though you know them and be established in the present truth yeah i think it meet or fit as long as i am in this tabernacle meaning as long as i am in his flesh to stir you up by putting you in remembrance listen knowing that shortly i must put off this my tabernacle even as our lord jesus christ had showed me moreover verse 15 i will endeavor that ye may be able after my decease in other words peter is saying after i am gone to have these things always in remembrance so peter was so passionate about what he was talking about here he said while i'm here i will be reminding you constantly and even when i'm gone i don't want you to forget these things i want to put things in place that you will always be reminded of these things 4 16 we have not followed callingly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty for he receives from he received from god the father honor and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mount we have also a more sure word of prophecy where unto ye do well that you take heed as unto a light that shine it in a dark place until the day dawn and the day start arise in your hearts knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in all time by the will of man but holy men of god speak as they were moved by the holy ghost may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word we're not finished so i'm reading this here and if you didn't know the story of peter and you just read and that's that is just two parts of two chapters of first and second peter peter this man we read in this peter who is speaking under inspiration has such a story that took him to this place of such confidence and that is what to me is a great encouragement to us all because the peter who is speaking here is not the peter who this is not the same way peter was when jesus first met him so i want to make the point that the person who jesus met the first time and this man who is speaking here it looks like the same peter was a different man on the inside and if i want to talk about peter it's a story of great transformation peter is one of those peter is a such a it's almost like there's this contrast on the one hand he seems as he makes a a irrational decision on the next hand he ready to say lord did i you bid me to come he he is a mixture of so many highs and lows and emotions that i believe he can be an encouragement to us all tonight but before i go a bit deeper there's a quote i want to read from the prophet from the message here he him and in it is something that is a quote that always stuck with me and it kind of lays a bit of of something i wanted to touch on before we kind of dig a little bit more into in the life of peter in the message he him but ibrahim was speaking here about adoption he said you know what happened then when that child come to a certain age that that boy that had he had been a bad boy and was not exactly what he found that could trust him he never had any inheritance at all you brethren know that from the scripture but if he was an obedient son and when he become to a certain age the same son was taken out into a public place before the public and he was put up on a high place and there the father put a robe on him and he adopted his own son into his family and on this placing of this son the son's name was just as good on a check as his father's was because he had been proven he was obedient and his name was good just the same as the father that's what jesus meant when he said ask the father anything in my name i'll do it notice then god never asked anybody to do anything but what he did at first he pronounced death upon the human race he was made flesh and taken death for us now he was going to adopt his own son into his family he took him up on mount transfiguration a high place before the public he brought three witnesses of the earth a tree is a confirmation we know that he had three witness of the earth tree witnesses from heaven and there he clothed christ he overshadowed him and his raymond shine like the sun in the middle of the day that road he placed in him showing that he had accepted him he was about the father's business he did just what the father showed him god was with him peter said at pentecost jesus of nazareth a man approved of god among you by signs and wonders oh wouldn't it be wonderful if the church was in that condition to be obedient to the father reverent and placed in the holy ghost in those tight places when you're afraid to speak up if like a gentleman you stand where you should stand like a lady you take the place not with the world but with christ reckoning yourself dead to the things of the world and in conferences and gatherings where you ministers stand and your conference begins to talk against the supernatural against this or this was for another age take your stand god will honor you oh my thought goes out to that day that david danced around the ark and his wife laughed at him but god said he's a man after my own heart sure you can't stand with men and god too if you're a servant of god you can't be a servant of god if you're serving a god you won't be a silvante man no i want to come down to my point here now notice let's drop back time's about go on but i want to get something you peter got all excited the supernatural had been done there stood moses and elijah both been there for years here they were standing alive standing there with jesus witnesses two of the mightiest prophets that ever walked standing by the side to watch god adopt his own son it gave him all the powers in heaven and earth give into his hands and this is the quote here he will do for you the same if you stand after you receive the holy ghost and make yourself a christian and act like a christian should and that quote always blessed me because it said after the holy ghost you still make yourself a christian he said you stand after you receive the holy ghost and make yourself a christian and act like a christian should and it connects into this the fact that you knew birth as an experience but abraham put it like you're born as a spiritual being and that being has to grow and grow and grow and grow into maturity spiritual maturity but abandoned gives you type of feeding on your word and you grow he said you drink a little more and you grow and you drink a little more and you grow and you drink a little more and a lot of people really have a have an experience and they don't have growth and the growth and the experiences that come after experience after experience is what really develops the character in you so this message or this teaching tonight is about character development and the story of peter and the lesson of peter was one of character development because god took a man who was we know it peter wasn't a learned man he wasn't like paul he wasn't an academic he was a man with no education he wasn't off no fancy job or profession in that time he was a fisherman and brother branham brought it out he was a simple man but god came and took this simple man and through his experiences one after the other god began to mold and shape this man into what we just read where to this day we can look at the scripture and still say add to your faith virtue and the virtue knowledge this is the man we're reading from that this scripture is is what we want to be able to live out faith virtue knowledge temperance patient godliness probably kindness but this man had his own struggles this is a man who never thought he would deny christ i want you to just kind of we're just talking about peter tonight he never thought he would deny christ he never thought he would see what he would see and i realized that it is easy to look at peter and say but peter deny christ but many times experiences in life comes and many times you don't know how you will deal with the situation until the situation comes because peter himself didn't believe he would deny christ in fact when jesus told peter that he will deny me peter said no that can happen that's not happening peter himself did not believe that he was going to deny christ that is why when he end up denying christ he wept bitterly because the reality was he didn't realize how vulnerable he was and despite that god was showing peter that my four knowledge my predestination is bigger than your mystique i already see you deny me i already see you restored anybody with me tonight peter is a testimony of god's foreknowledge being bigger than every mistake that peter made you know peter was so such a special character you know he rebuked jesus you you know what the audacity is to rebuke jesus it is i think is it mark let me go to mark i have different scriptures here mark eight this is jesus and um this is similar to matthew 16. so what is the way any word is is written in him he said this is mark eight and verse one and he said unto them but whom say he that i am and peter answered and said unto him thou art the christ and he charged them that they should tell no man of him and he began to teach them that the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and of the chief priests and scribes and be killed and after three days rise again and he speak that openly and peter took him and began to rebuke him it takes a special kind of man to pull the lord jesus answered the rebuke you know you know to rebuke him but this is peter operating in what he understands he's operating with his understanding he's operating with his feeling with his emotions with what he's going through and he find that jesus shouldn't do that i want to start to work with it for a minute to understand in our own lives because he doesn't have the understanding of what this all means so because he is limited in his understanding he is judging it by his understanding but he is fearless and taken action and has the audacity to rebuke jesus and the next verse says and when he had turned about and looked at his disciples he rebuked peter so jesus now returned your rebuke to peter and say get thee behind me satan for those savories not the things that be of god but the things that be of men so in this case here this same man peter who we just read and that's why i started i started at the end so work how you reach there because nobody starts there anybody with me all right so we are on our road to adoption we're on the road to perfection we're on our road to transformation so along the journey this is the encouragement to us as believers of the church tonight along the journey they are stumbling points along the journey there will be things you don't understand yet but we have an encouragement because we see in the grace of god and if the same grace that god extend to peter could apply to your life then you could be encouraged tonight that he was able to transform peter peter was with his excitement and his excitement with his lack of knowledge through and god could say listen this is the man that i want to use to do certain things this is the same peter here who get the behind me satan for those savories the things that be of that that service not the things that be of god but the things that be of men so at that time god was saying peter you cannot know but the encouragement here is peter's change was yet to come anybody with me peter's change was still coming and whenever whenever situations happen in your life right now i want you to have the positive fee to say my change is still coming god is not finished with me yet my story is not over yet my story is still being written anybody with me tonight my story is not over anybody with me so peter we know jessica cannot touch and i want to it's a specific situation i'm trying to come to trust will be a blessing to you peter had a great privilege to be able to be part of quality the circle around jesus without a big education without being a big family he was called as a fisherman to be official of men even peter being called had testimonies in there because the bible said that when jesus people were coming to him and he decided to continue teaching he was by the sea so he stepped on a boat happened to be peter's boat and jesus is teaching from peter's boat and peter there washing here he had been washing his neck he was frustrated he didn't catch anything at all and jesus told peter cassian plural plural on the other side peter could be so such a character he didn't listen full obedience he cast the bible said annette single singular and in ned brook and over and over you see situations where peter was either doing part is either he do something kind of reluctantly you didn't have it or you didn't so much like a lot of is you build me to come and he jumped on it in the water until he realized well i cannot i cannot over over jump a little bit but i have to give peter credit because peter wasn't afraid to try peter was enough for it to to put his action where his belief was up until the point that a situation come that makes him go through something or feel something or experience something that he never experienced before or never dealt with before and this is the thing about life friends and when i look at the gospel and and i look at the word because you have not experienced every situation in life there are things that are in us that you don't know there i'll say it one more time there are things in us that you don't know there until the experiences come to show what's there and god allows situations to unfold to reveal what's in us everybody with me building a little bit so peter as we know he became almost the we call it the informal leader of the 12 he was always like the first to give a response to to to make a statement to say something it would seem at times he didn't he didn't think too much before he spoke he was prone to get very excited that is not necessarily a bad quality but his excitement got him in trouble plenty times he had the the best of desires but under pressure so we see when jesus said wouldn't you watch with me when people will be watching peter sleeping when the when they came to get jesus he's the man who pulled his sword out and chop of the ears so we see a level of of of ups and downs with peter when i guess the greatest trial for peter being peter's denial of jesus and i want to suggest process that for a little bit because the denial of jesus came this is close to the end of jesus ministry so peter would have seen all the miracles he would have witnessed he'd dead being raised he would have witnessed feeling of the five thousand he would have witnessed miracle after miracle he would have been a witness at hmong transfiguration and under pressure when he never told that he didn't have it in him to backslide pressure brought something out of peter that he didn't know he had so i want to encourage us tonight throughout every trial and situation that you go through that you have to look beyond your failures and your mystics to see your spiritual encounter you have to look beyond your up and downs to see the upper room and you have to see that when you have that experience with god that there's still the making yourself a christian because one once you even have the holy ghost you have life to deal with you know the holy ghost doesn't remove your bills you know so let's let's let's put it so so you think adopt be being adopted with with with suddenly the bank the mortgage you build windham there has to be a balance with your spiritual growth spiritual maturity spiritual inheritance and still being able to live in this world that we don't know until such time as god calls us out of here you know so it means that even when as you grow in the spirit you will still have frustrations uh-huh oh some of you told that when you have an encounter with god there's no more frustration oh you told that that as you're pushing towards and you're striving and you're climbing higher that suddenly is a stress-free life is that anywhere in the wood so it is not as if a spiritual experience or adding suddenly means that that your credit card bill mp anymore you know but your spiritual maturity and your spiritual experience repositions your glasses with how you look at situations and it increases your trust in god and your reliance on god with how to approach different situations for him to now lead you in places that you may not even be comfortable to go and we're going to get into the teaching because i do it all it's a billion dollar situation around peter's life that we cannot we talk about it but we kind of glaze over it a little bit to see that people who have an ex a spiritual experience you have to make sure but the brandon presented it as as doors indoors he said listen you could bring the lord into your living room and leave him right there he said when you invite a guest you could choose to keep on living but you don't want them going to the kitchen at all because then they get into the kitchen and they open your fridge you know all your all your food might go or what whatever the situation is i don't know but he says the more trust you have in somebody is the more rooms in your house you're comfortable for them to go into anybody with me tonight and the reality is god wants all of us every single part of us not 80 percent so so god must be able to walk into your office sit on the desk next to you and you supposed to be able to operate the way you normally operate remember pause there a little bit i can say that one more time he's supposed to be able to walk into your workplace and sit in the desk next to you and you operate or you normally operate in other words you're not supposed to change your behavior because he is there now your behavior supposed to be the same way because you're conscious of his presence anybody with me so this is how the spiritual maturity comes because if you do have a bill to pay as a son of god there has to be an approach repeating the bill you can't be flying on the handle because when it was time to pay the bill god was interested in it too you tell them go catch a fish and and when they catch the fish and they did the work to catch the fish and they cut it open and they had the coin in there anybody with me so it's not as evide and and for that brief moment you forget you're a christian anybody with me i'm trying to bring the reality of life and living in the spirit living with the spirit have any spirit and living in this world that we are in and maintaining a testimony some years ago i preached a message between sundays i think i did as a youth service and i mentioned it to you saying the real christian walk is what happens between sundays because on sunday oh forget it talk about anointing talk about inspiration talk about leave and charge your battery full on 100. but by the time you meet your boss you're encounter your tire went flat you're building something happens something happened your whole testimony is now uh you remember when it used to be because you reach so far out of the spirit anybody with me so let me get to the the teaching i wanted to get to tonight all of this here was a little background uh to kind of place context on this so we're gonna touch on an experience that peter had because we're holding in on peter in a certain experience and i want to bring it to us because this part in part came out of a question about one after he getting hold he goes he make himself a christian and two a lot of people wonder how could people claim to have the holy ghost or have an experience and behave the way they do anybody ever thought about that people claim big revelation big experience when they when when when you see them in operation you see it now something wrong and the issue is not so much about something wrong you know the issue is there's a lot more growth to do and the reality is you can't lay back and rest on an experience so there are a lot of people who rest on you remember how it was you you're remember 83. you remember oh and you remember this experience i remember when we were in this meeting and remember this is it but the reality is this if you don't stay in the spirit there much people have testimonies of 83 and yet and they're not nowhere near christ right now because life has gotten in the way situations have gotten in the way and they've had experiences that challenge their work or their thinking or they believe about something or they have allowed people in the world or in church to move them from their place of personal revelation so let's kind of drive home a little bit acts 10 so we're now going to look at peter from the book of acts and for those who familiar with it then we're going to end up in the book of galatians all right acts 10 said there was a certain man in caesarea called cornelius a centurion so he's not a jew he's a gentile all right a centurion of the band called the italian band or what would be a band in this context is regiment so he's of of of the of the italian regiment would be the actual word all right so a devote man so here it has so this here is is a transitional state a transition has taken place all right because we know that jesus came to his own and his own refused him all right so god is already beginning to now work with the gentiles and we know that paul is the messenger of the age he's the one to really bring the message home but there's a transition taking place all right so god is also using peter in a ministry to the gentiles as well so here is this man and and this is a testimony for us all and this year is a powerful teaching here in cornelius because he still didn't come to a fullness of the revelation of who jesus was but the bible can say he was a devout man with the little that he knew i wanted to drive his home a little bit with the little that he knew he was devout about what he was convicted about i want to drive this home a little bit more so everybody in this room tonight no matter what stage you are in in your revelation of this message you have enough to be qualified as devout with what you know in other words nobody has an excuse to have a testimony of being devout because we would find out cornelius had an appointment with finding out who what this thing was really about but he had a testimony before he even came to the fullness of the revelation of who jesus was anybody with me a devout man and one that feared god with all his house so it takes great wisdom to be able to bring your house to appreciate what you believe so not only are digging down here a bit not only was cornelius devout and he believed but he was able to persuade he was able to convince he was able to encourage he was able to inspire he was able to motivate he was able to push he was able to lead he was able to guide he was able to influence you see all those words there because it doesn't happen by accident it doesn't happen by chance one that feared god with all his house so he is being the head of his home all right so i'm pushing now i'm pushing i'm pushing somewhere and i'm pushing to how god is still working he's working on him he's working on pizza he's working on you he's working on me cornelius is a fantastic display of being head of his home and this speaks of the responsibility of the leaders of houses leaders of homes it is something that many have abandoned a long time ago where the bible said we are kings and priests and i preached to the young people about two or so years ago that read the old testament there's no king who was also a priest because to be a priest he was a son of aaron he was of the tribe of the levites and the kings came from other tribes in particularly the tribe of judah but with this new covenant you are both a king and a priest so as a priest because the bible said he jesus is the high priest you can't be a high priest unless they are serving priests so it means that this is a meeting tonight of priests but it's not only a meeting of priests with he as the high priest it's also a meeting of kings because we are kings and he is called the king of kings so you have to understand your authority you have to understand your rank you have to understand your position and you cannot be a king without a kingdom and a kingdom is your domain or your dominion and your first domain or dominion is your home if your family is your house anybody with me it is your place of work not that you're ruling your boss but if you're on a desk that desk is your kingdom you could choose what you put on that desk what is in your domain your computer your phone your laptop all that is yours you can choose what you watch what you do let's bring it personal who you message what messages you receive you have influence authority and power but you don't realize it and you allow other things to influence you but let's keep going a devout man lord help me to be a devout man i challenge you tonight to be a devout man i challenge you to be a devout woman let these be words that describe you let these be words that describe me a devout man a man one that feared god with all his house which gave much arms to the people and prayed to god always can this be said about you bear in mind he didn't have an experience yet i'm building and i'm trying to move because i'm trying to get something i'm not dealing with cornelius i'm dealing i'm trying to deal with peter i'm still trying to get back to peter we you're studying how god used this and other situations to keep working on peter so because he was a devout man because he was praying because he was seeking god will not allow somebody to seek him because he said if you seek me with all your heart you will find me so this man don't know what you're really looking for but you know it had to be something out there there's a deep calling to her deep oh come on now so there got to be a deep to respond so this gentile this man who was not of the royal covenant he didn't know what the royal covenant was he was not of any tribe he is a gentile a centurion of the italian so by by saying italian ban he had no connection to the abrahamic covenant anybody with me tonight but he prayed always and he saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day which is like 3 p.m an angel of god coming into him and saying unto him cornelius and when he looked at him he was afraid and said what is it lord my my my mind and he said unto him thy prayers undyne arms are come up for a memorial before god can your prayers and your arms form a memorial before god anybody with anybody with me tonight what kind of memorial would we find in heaven for your prayers and your arms what actions are you taking because you already want you already want to be a christian anybody and now so based on what you have been doing in other words it's not just a desire he had but based on what he was doing he said now send men to dropper and call for one simon whose surname is peter so this cornelius is living his life searching for god and because god has men on the earth i want you to catch this now because god has men on the earth god will use who he has can the church say amen now send men to japan and call for one simon whose name is peter he lodged it with one simon a tanner whose house is by the seaside he shall tell thee what thou art is to do now it really takes you to trust god because god is speaking to him and god chooses to not tell him what to do i want you to catch this god talking to him what can i tell him go and do this no no no no but god i do that he said listen i'm talking to you now and my instruction is going to talk to one of my sons now no god is already dealing with simon peter because simon is by simon ditano and i want us to catch that if you read i think it's leviticus i think it's a little bit limited because 10 11 the bible speaks about anybody who deals with the skins of animals that are eaten it's unclean so god was dealing with peter because peter reach a point to be stained by somebody who was a tanner but god is pushing because he's getting ready to deal with the gentiles so there are these hints that god is beginning to deal with peter and his ministry to the gentiles all right so peter rage as far as staying by the house of atana right he shall tell thee what orders to do and when the angel which speak on two cornelius was departed he conned us called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of them had waited on him continually and when he had declared all these things unto them he sent them to dropper all right i don't know if i'm going to get to finish it all tonight but i really want to try on the morrow as they went on their journey and drew nigh onto the cet peter went up upon the house stop to pray about the sixth hour the six hour is midday all right so when last have you prayed at the six hour anybody just encouraging you know this is i'm not another bikini i guess just a question when last have you prayed that he's sick so cornelius was pregnant at the ninth hour you know he had where are the times you know you know you have to know what hour what how are you praying all right so and he became very hungry and would have eaten but while they made ready he fell into a trance so he was hungry he would have eaten but while they were me ready he's selling her trance and i want to now i want you to see this jesus is already crucified resurrection this is this is later on so upper room already take place many ship so i wanted to see the context right and he fell into a trance and saw heaven open and a certain vessel descending onto him as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners and led down to the eighth wearing were all manner of four-footed beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and falls of the air so peter is seen like a vision as it were in a trance right and there came a voice in him rise peter kill and eat now i want us to understand something and this to me i'm not teaching doctrine but to me now i see him but wait a minute this is peter who was upper room peter this is peter who preacher 3000. this is peter who says silver and gold i don't have such as i have i give unto you this is peter there's nobody would question if peter had an experience with god there's nobody would question if peter heard from god there's nobody without it but here it is peter encounters something that in his mind and in the context of his experience he currently do it i want us to appreciate this in other words there was a part of the house of peter if i use any analogy of doors indoors there was a room in peter's heart that was yet to be consumed can we drive home with this so a lot of peter was under the control of the holy spirit but we are seeing here as we go further there came a voice in him rise peter kill and eat but peter said not so lord this is just a little bit above when peter was saying rebuke the lord this is peter directly or how are you going to say kind of rejecting what god's saying to him i want us to questions and pete is not rejecting it out of wanting to so just reject whatever you say to be rejectish you're not just trying to reject he said not so lord for i have never eaten anything that is common or unclean so peter pulling out a quote come on now he's pulling out the levitical law he's pulling out once again based on his understanding anybody with me he is pulling out based on the limits of his knowledge of what should be eaten and he's saying i already know if you're comfortable with this one oh lord and the voice speak unto him again the second time what god had cleansed that call not doubt come on in other words if i cleanse it you do have permission to now say this unclean but what struck me here and this is where when i say you slow down the scripture you get to process it the bible said this was done thrice three times that what's right means and the vessel was received up again into heaven no if somebody tells something once and you act on it then you get but here it is peter was so stubborn on this issue that god had to do it three times for this message to stick so when you look at this now it means then that and i want to bring it to us many have had experiences with god peter was holding on to a tradition he was holding on to history he was holding on to what he believed to be something to hold on to and god was showing him let that thing go and god had to repeat it repeat it repeat it and peter hardy holy ghost can i push can i push can i push so holy ghost phil peter god have to have him repeat first here repeat for us here repeat first say he can't graduate because something about his history his knowledge how he was raised can we push a little deeper his belief system how he tinctured supposed to be oh gosh let's let's let's push now how he think the minister supporter approached it how we supposed to do a service how we supposed to the way it was done for so many years was this way that he said it can't be the lord in him can i push can i push and peter has the holy ghost this is not an angel coming to him this is the lord coming to him dealing and the issue being dealt with is the interaction with the gentiles what god is dealing with god is showing him that listen i have a place in my kingdom for the gentiles how could you call them unclean when i give them clean space in this economy in this kingdom under this covenant you don't have a right to push them out come on now because if i let them in you have to drop whatever your perception of them are because i am welcoming them in and if i welcome them in you have to do it also and god have to give this servant multiple times him to get your message if peter didn't accept this lesson the dentist would have begun that would have never gotten place i wanted to catch us so i want to drive this home now to long-held beliefs that people have about who god will choose and how god will use and if god could bless and you you see how this turns this upside down when you say god kai use somebody or gokart turn somebody around or go can this just disrupts the whole thing all right i want to kind of speed here now why peter adopted in himself what this vision meant so after the three times he stepped doubting no no he wrestling with how heating distinction unfold and who he believed jesus come for all right don't worry peter doubted in himself what his vision which he had seen should mean behold the men which was sent from cornelius had made inquiry for simon's house and stood before the gate and called and asked whether simon which was surnamed peter were lodged in while peter taught on the vision the spirit said to him behold three me three men seek thee so the spirit is guiding peter now arise therefore and get thee down and go with them doubting nothing for i have sent them then peter went down to the men which was sent unto him from cornelius and said behold i am he whom you seek what is the cause where for you have come and they said cornelius a centurion a just man and one that feared god and of good report among all the nation of the jews was worn from god by an holy angel to send for thee into his house and to hear words of thee then call he them in and lodge them and on the morrow peter went away with them and certain brethren from joppa accompanied him so other brothers went with him too and the moral after they entered into caesarea and cornelius waited for them and had caught together his kinsmen and their friends and as peter was coming in cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshipped him but peter took him up saying stand up i myself also am a man and as he talked with him he went in and found many that will come together so cornelius was so convinced of what god told him he called his family he called his friends he called his relatives he called his neighborhood he said god gonna do something for me if you want to be part of it come and see that you you you see this man still i meet god yet he hunting he's searching but he's convinced of the answer so peter is blown away because peter coming commits an audience and listen to verse 28. so this is peter beginning to connect the dots he said he said unto them you know that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a jew to keep company one or come unto one of another nation but god had showed me you you see now we understand what it is now everybody with me but god had shown me that i should not call any man coming or unclean you see that now this is a whole deep teaching we can't get into all of it tonight but be very careful because there's no man that you can call come on or unclean all those in the message who want to be pushing people out and saying one of the worst things that has plagued the messengers people in the message acting as if they have the monopoly on how god will operate with the rapture and how god will operate with a lot of things and you god is suffering god could save who we want he can deliver who he wants how he wants to do it and and people want to cut this one off this one finish they could never make it there's no room that that's before peter's experience that's what peter thought that these gentiles or let's change it these people who didn't believe the way he believed come on now these people who are different customs from his customs these people who are a different family they want for different race they were different but god is saying i am including them in my covenant let's race here because i need to get to the next section before my time is up but god had shown me i'm in verse 28 again that i should not call any man come on or unclean verse 29 therefore came i unto you without gain seeing as soon as i was sent for i asked therefore for what intent you have sent for me and cornelia said this is cornelius without an experience cornelius with all the fullness of the revelation four days ago i was fasting until this hour and at the ninth hour i prayed in my house and behold a monster before me in bright clothing and said cornelius thy prayer is heard and thine arms are hard in remembrance in the sight of god send therefore to joppa and call hither simon whose surname is peter he is lodged in the house of one simon at tanner by the seaside who when he come and shall speak unto thee immediately therefore i sent to thee and thou has well done that dawah come now therefore are we all here present before god to hear all things that are commanded be of god and then peter opened his mouth and said for truth i perceive that god is no respecter of persons and in every nation he that feared him and working righteousness is accepted with him that's why when the prophet say he's gonna call from the methodist he quoted me baptist he's gonna call he said it'll be a great united time we don't know how it's gonna happen but we have to trust god the message needs to stop acting like they're better than anybody else the same grace of god that reach you that reach me could reach anybody we are no better than anybody i am no better than anybody can the church say amen oh hallelujah hallelujah and if you adopt that attitude god could begin to use you for his kingdom how can you help somebody if you operate like you're better than them that's how peter was before he had his encounter but let's push in every nation he'd have feared him and worked righteousness is accepted with him and the word which god sent unto the children of israel preaching peace by jesus christ he is lord of all that would i say you know which was published throughout all judea and began from galilee after the baptism which john bapu john preached how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed and of the devil for god was with him and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the jews and in jerusalem whom they slew and hung on a tree him god raised up the today he preached a whole message there and showed him openly not to all the people but unto witnesses hallelujah chosen before of god oh hallelujah so not everybody can see this but unto witnesses chosen before of god even to us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead and he commanded us to preach unto the people and to testify that it is he which was ordained of god to be the judge of the quick and dead to him gave all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins and while peter yet speak his words the holy ghost fell on all them with heard the word so by virtue of cornelius being persuaded to invite his family and his friends and his relatives as peter yet speak these words so when you hear the preacher say it this is where it comes from and as peter yet take these words the holy ghost fell on all them which heard the word and dear listen and day of the circumcision in other words the brothers who came with peter which believed were astonished so god shocked them hallelujah may god shock some more believers with who god will use hallelujah may god shock some believers with how god will take anybody and bring them into the economy of god and they of the circumcision which believe were astonished as many as came with peter because that on the gentiles also was poured out the gift of the holy ghost for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify god then answer peter can the church give the lord some praise god is sovereign his grace is wonderful so i want to kind of bring it a quick close but i want us to see then because we still now this is peter still learning still growing so peter with the holy ghost still being led and he is coming to a deeper revelation of how big god is because prior to this he was at the view that jesus only came to the jews come on now before this experience he was actually limiting god anybody with me before this experience he didn't know that god was bigger than his family bigger than his house bigger on his tribe bigger than the whole core of israel and god was interested in more than he even understood anybody with me tonight my last reading tonight is going to come from galatians and i want to kind of drill down now because you know with peter in particular peter is the man who said call me and he walk in the water and then peter fall in the water peter is is a is an interesting character in his journey so he's growing but he's growing in an interesting way now so a main reference that peter where the holy ghost wanted to tell him three times threw him three times him to accept this thing now this is the encounter now with paul and peter and i want to read from this is galatians 2. so this is paul speaking now and i want to just bring us our consciousness now of how it is so important for you to be able to stand by individual revelation so galatians 2 and verse 11. but when peter was come to antioch we could call this the antioch situation or the antioch incident but when peter was come to antioch i would stood him to the face because he was to be blamed in other words when peter was come to antioch i had to face off with peter for because for for before that listen to this certain came from james now bible scholars would know that at this time james was the pastor in jerusalem so brothers from the jerusalem church had come to visit antioch in good fellowship in good greetings to see all the brethren doing prior to those brothers coming from jerusalem brother clarence peter the bible says for before that certain came from james he did eat with the gentiles so peter is now totally accepting the gentiles he eaten with his entires he fellowship with the gentiles he would have had an experience with cornelius what can i differently call god taking him to our journey now so i want to kind of kind of bring this up close and to leave it to think a little bit but when they will come so when the brothers from the church in jerusalem reached he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcision so i want you to see something here now to make it this is the same peter god meets you on top of your house give you a revelation of having fellowship of feasting and and blessing but listen to i wanted to drop this here his fear of the brothers from jerusalem was greater than his experience i don't need time tonight to finish it but let me let me just kind of drive this home a little bit in other words he let them brothers make him forget his experience with god did him come to accuse him they didn't come soon he heard his brothers come he leave the table is that even sitting on a table with with some people eating i went in here with any brothers from jerusalem you mean from james you mean the brothers from you know james church [Music] um it's not you it's me it's not you is me and brother peter got up from eaton with i want you to see the context so this is not peer pressure from the world this is not peer pressure from the world now this is now inside the thing this is inside the message now this is inside the church now this is the lord because if you're not already show you something all right let's push home a little bit right is so i'm showing you how and this here is a city because anybody only when his situation come peter see what was still in him you know anybody with me if the brothers from james did not come let's push us home peter would have still been sitting eating with them normal but god raised up a situation so that peter could still see but whitner it's still a little in me in other words i'm valuing the opinion of the brothers from jerusalem a little more than what he lord show me about the gentile dispensation you know you see that there so listen to this as i wind along into a close this has so much spin off on it but i want to leave it in your mind this is the same peter walking water he's seeing peter who was there who preached on the day of pentecost the same peter called me the money house the same peter went to cornelius he's seen peter has a revelation god already dealing with him but he is still vulnerable to the opinions of man come on now the issue that paul had with him this is what it means it comes to he withdrew and separated himself fearing fear fearing them which were of the circumcision he allowed fear to be more to be greater than his experience and the other jews listen now the other jews december likewise with him in other words there were other jews just like the brothers who went to with him to cornelius who suddenly got a revelation at the holy ghost upon other people too there were other brothers there who when peter pulled back from the gentiles they pulled back also and to paul shock paul's complete shock he says in so much that barnabas also was carried away with this dissimulation the paradox of this as barnabas had worked with paul directly for 14 years dealing with the gentiles and barnabas i don't see them brothers from jerusalem i'm coming oh i can't eat i can't even return there no more so i want to know bring home we'll be studying peter and this is not just peter not because peter also has influence come on now so when you're in a position of influence so peter by his action in in a certain sense in strong words he almost had to lead him but at the backslide because this is why paul gets so upset listen now but when i saw that they walk not uprightly in other words this behavior was not upright behavior paul put under the gun peter all them brothers and man of us he said when i saw that they walk not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel what was the truth of the gospel the truth of the gospel was there was room for the gentiles and that the gentiles were not subject to the law of the jews so there should be no issue with with paul and peter and the gentiles and the jews god was dealing with them all she said when i saw that they walk not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel i said unto peter before them all so here paul peterson in front of them all if dog being a jew leave us after the manner of gentiles and not as do the jews why compel us though the gentiles live as do the jews for we who are jews by nature are not sinners of the gentiles knowing that a man is not justified by the work of the law but by the faith of jesus christ even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ and not by the works of the law for by the work of the lord shall no flesh be justified and he goes on and i'm trying to close out here but i want to bring this down to a close as you go through life it is showing here that that peter was still growing he was still learning even with his spirit god was guiding he was still being rebuked as if jesus himself was there he was still being advised as if jesus himself was there because until his complete transformation until god was finished with him he still had growing up to lose i want to see with the take on the life of peter because many times a lot of people end the story with well peter was heading to the upper room and and he denied christ but he had the upper room coming and sure and god but really coming after the upper room there was still work going on after the upper room god still dealing with peter even so much that paul who was a messenger of the age had to straighten out peter and say peter you have to do better than that you know you can't be living this way with and when brothers come is it a genuine revelation that you have so as we close out friends i want to encourage you because this is a paradox i want you to meditate on it the brothers from jerusalem wasn't coming to lead them down no wrong road or no peter's fear of what they would think led him to be a certain way so i want us to be very conscious of other people's opinions and how the only opinion that matters is god's opinion that's the only opinion that matters because god deals with people in different ways god never dealt with the church in under james the way he dealt with peter and paul and the gentiles those brothers in jerusalem was never given the insight to see what god was doing and they still had the blessing of god god still work with them but god chose who to show what he wants to show you have to walk uprightly with the fullness of the revelation as revealed to you because you cannot get anything more than what god will reveal to you let me say that one more time you can't study what god will not reveal to you and this is why you could have no insecurity in your faith in god and his word because god is sovereign he said flesh and blood did not reveal this to you peter but my father in heaven in other words the revelation you have you didn't acquire it it is the father who gave you the revelation but the the encouragement tonight is if god has given you a revelation stand by the revelation that's what i want to drive home tonight because a lot of people have had experiences and i've had a revelation from god and allow the opinions of man in other words i wonder why he brought us a little thing boy wherever jerusalem may reside now i don't know where jerusalem is and whoever james may be or the number of people who hold the portfolio by james that could have influence for uh a man as strong as peter peter led them brothers from james put them under some manners and it's a great lesson to us all that peter his whole life that is live before us is a lesson of what to do what to avoid what to see what not to see the grace of god and at the end of it we can look now at and i'll close with this in first peter we started reading it in uh look at the exact first first peter verse 1 verse 10 of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you searching what or what manner of time the spirit of christ which was in them that signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of christ and the glory that would follow and peter is going on that's going on and uh i want to get down to substitute unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient and he goes on to bless nine but ye are our chosen generation by the time peter is writing this he's writing to a primarily to gentiles but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood and holy nation a peculiar people that he should show for the praises of him who will call you out of darkness you know talk about jews there into marvelous light which in time passed listen were not a people but are now the people of god which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy you see the encouragement you see by the time peter finishes transformation hopefully they could preach daily beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain and he goes on having your conversation honest among the gentiles and he's speaking to so many lord richard bless you tonight in this little study of peter maybe an encouragement to you to have faith to keep pressing to stand by a revelation and if you're fall don't hesitate to get back up don't test me to be like peter and say save me i'm drunk then i stepped on faith and i need i needed to pull him up and he said jesus pull his hands up water know the encouragement that although peter was going to deny christ there was still a promise over him and a place for him that this denier of christ who slipped and felt so many times god is going to use him to say this is that which are spoken by the prophet joel these men are not drunk as you suppose and to see god saying listen peter i still have more for you to do because when you finish preach you have a work to do with the gentiles god knew that peter was the one to go to cornelius god knew he was he want to open certain doors god knew he god is so good may the lord is the bless you can we bow our heads for a word of prayer tonight heavenly father this little bible study around the life of peter a study of peter lord to see so many lord aspects of his life lord to see his ups and downs to see his encounter with the supernatural to see you trying to lord get more and more control of him lord to see how he can be used lord lord his ministry lord that was to the jews and then that switch lord where you begin to work with the gentiles to see how it is not easy for people to change it is not easy for people to adjust but it takes the spirit of god lord to open our understanding lord to see beyond how we judge things lord to see how you discern judge how you place how you call lord because we didn't stand a chance lord if you didn't switch to the gentiles but lord your in your mind lord you thought of us lord father you thought of us in this day in this
