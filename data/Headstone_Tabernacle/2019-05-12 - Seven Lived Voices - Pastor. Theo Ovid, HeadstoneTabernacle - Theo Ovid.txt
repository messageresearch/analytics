these mothers here this morning and I I want to thank you for that surprise last Sunday it was a surprise report me [Music] they caught me and I I enjoy myself thoroughly enjoy the day it was one of those have a least if I can see I really enjoyed the time with you guys a certain appreciated when you look back in history and look back at the pictures and look back at our story for the past 40 years it's quite interesting but the story's not finished yet oh sorry they'll finish yet this will have a great ending not a good and a great ending all glory to God I believe that with all my heart tomorrow I leave for Cameroon so making this be able to Cameroon I'll be back next week so I pray for those meetings and prefer us so we still continue as normal we've got four for a great time with the Lord amen so this morning I have something in my heart I was in prayer May 9th and this thing struck me and this is what I have I feel this message above my pay grade but it's quite put some in my heart that's that Amen so let's understand you want to go into the world Thank You musicians we certainly appreciate the singing under worship the atmosphere we have three portion of scriptures we like to Reese and John chapter five wanna be from verse 36 to 41 I read from 2nd Peter 1 we want to read from verse 3 to 12 also revelation 10 1 to 7 this is Jesus speaking it's in John chapter 5 from 536 but I have agreed a witness than that of John for the works which the father had given me to finish the same works that I do be a witness of me that the father had sent me and the father himself which had sent me had borne witness of me this is important now listen what he's telling them you have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his sheep and he have not his word abiding in you for whom he had sent he believed not then he says these words search the scripture so this word he's talking about is not Scripture he's talking about the word in them and search the scripture for in them you think you have eternal life but they are they which testify of me verse 40 and you will not come to me that you might have life Wow second Peter one whose tree according as his divine power given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness through the knowledge of him that had called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding precious great and precious promises now by D's he might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world who lust and besides this given all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and the knowledge temperance and to temperance patience the patience godliness to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity and if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be barren on fruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he did look at these things is blind cannot see afar off forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give divisions to make a call in election sure or if you do these things you shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in immense of remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth and from religions up to ten familiar Scripture I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven to with a cloud a rainbow I was upon his head his face was the Sun his feet as pillars of fire he had in his hand a little book open his set his right foot upon the sea his left foot on the earth car with a loud voice on a lion roar it a wing had cried seven thunders uttered the voices when the seven thunders uttered their voices I was about to write I get a voice from heaven saying unto me seek up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea upon the earth lift up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth for ever and ever who created heaven and things that therein are on the earth and the things that are Darren are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer so time runs out but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to song the mystery of God shall be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets let's borrow his father we thank you for your word God you know what's in my heart I was spoken to my heart Lord I know I come Lord and unless pray or helped me tonight I'm take me onto the way and speak your word to your people I don't know why we got this this morning but Lord this is what we have are we gonna share it or may drink food and bread on the table granted father and Jesus and I ask it amen and amen you may be seated oh praise the Lord this morning I have a title and the title is seven lived voices that's a title seven live voices amen other thing a context scripture like to read from this is from second constructor treat of the finite due week again begin to commend ourselves or need we as others epistles of commendation to you or letters of combination for a from you ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men you are our writen so this is not a reading of text you become that live in text or living word so now today you're gonna hear about these voices but not just normal voices is that talk is living word spirit word spirit voice good voice you said for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by US written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of spoon but in fleshly tables of the heart so this writin is a little different it's not on paper it's in your heart God writing and making you become a written epistle where when people read the scripture they could see you when you read a scripture you could see you because you become a written epistle what your red-meat manifests what's in the word become manifest hallelujah you're not born God didn't make you human just see if he could make humans you have a purpose behind you being here on earth Oh glory that God there make are the prophets that just to see if you could make car they make cars our purpose God make you for a purpose you in services model for a purpose you may have your agenda but God of a purpose behind you be in here and that purpose must be fulfilled and if you understand that there is no trial there is nothing present come with a stop that purpose of God from pre fulfill in your life and God Himself have a purpose but not canceled his purpose for anybody he's not change this man he say your thoughts are not my thoughts your ways are not my ways he said praise God my words shall not return unto me void so when God releases word he releases world with an objective behind it he releases word with a hook behind it he really is a word knowing something else to come back with it God not wasted words we speak idle words we speak free words we say what we want to say an altar Taner but the God he is perfect there is nothing to be added front to him he can't get more eyes because he is wisdom he can't know nothing new because he know the end from the beginning we believe that this morning so he knows all about your life you know all about your failures you know all about your shortcomings you know all we're gonna happen next week and still we put your name on the book that's why usually praising God continually no child should be so hard as you can't praise God no testing so deep that you can't praise God when job got his jamming job said the Lord gives the Lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord and the devil had to take that to the stripe and snake it because a son of God was confessing who he was and who is follow us or get the Lord I showed up raised brother [Applause] hallelujah the only reason got to call the devil attention to job is because I want to prove something but what you see is in that man it's not what around him that make him what he is is what's in him but make him what he is is what are you going to make you what you are [Applause] that's why the promise of the secret is the word is in the brain that's the secret the word is in the brain but would have to come inside of you Oh glory to God you hear what I'm saying glory to God a man hallelujah praise God seven live voices not as a description but an action live by you and through you oh praise the name of the Lord hallelujah but a Branham from future homies I always find my messages is know the way I always find my message is by prayer I'll be sitting in prayer and something reveals to me and I wait a few minutes and see if it's right and then sometime I keep waiting till it breaks into our vision and then I go to the scripture that is ought to be the confirmation of every spiritual thing that's done because the Bible is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ amen so God's strategy is on position my per witness is to take empty human vessels and shake the world with them dice watch strategy empty human vessels and shake the world with them like a Pentecost a Pentecost what did he do he take them 10 days to get or emptied up and when they all standing there with their vessels turned up God poked himself and fill them up that is all and they shook the world ignorant men men that carried all right nor degree nor CXC nor GCE nor PhD but they shook the world or give the Lord some praises people that's the need of today that's what we need today is empty vessels so God can fill them up and you cannot listen God cannot use them as long as they already filled up if we follow your thoughts and your ideas and what your pink and your temperature you feel of something already so go on our room no space like what he said clip put some tone from Jamaica talking about she went to some funeral I mean mine who died was a motif and he passed I seen all kind of nice will body man on the moon so funny and she said really she said she has tried to hold she pees all his I'm very good everybody really funny that a tea for what that passes in nice words she said she couldn't hold back when he passes the less prefer so they go to heaven she said that is when she woke him out and tell him room for me who has done it the hell she said said nobody belong that was something my hallelujah so you have to be filled up so God can fill up heaven with ascetic rocks and whatnot where you go for company that'll at least six dimensions for their sins who going on before God have a place reserved for them that never cooks and bandits and teeth trying to come to purgatory and come to the Catholic Church or come to 205 I'm chillin Mary no and there's a message causing a message and there's a way to get to where we supposed to go there is no other way there is only one way you have to want to know that one way you are plenty is is one way you after the word your name come out the book the tape from the wagon and come out the book this is serious remember when that which is perfect is come God s acceptance after that in the time of ignorance God winked because you don't know but when you come to full knowledge Jesus said no you have those your sins dear with you because I come to bring light on the word or give the Lord some praises so God cannot use them as long as they got filled up you got full of theological training court can use you is cut empty vessels to fill them and they had empty vessels in Pentecost got to fill them brother this daily man's that this day you got to have that we will have that or perish and that's how I want you to get to that I have to have this Holy Ghost I've got to get these dynamics I've got to get this power chord in me I'm coming to church for years but that's not good enough give me something more than that you let your pastor you love what you preach and that's good but that's not good enough you need something more than pastor preach and you need God Almighty that's why Jesus search the Scriptures for in them you think eternal life and these guys was going to church they was going to Pharisees and Sadducees he said but you wouldn't come to me that you might have life you see the person have life or give the Lord a shout in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God ha ha that's not written word you know that is the Lord a shout in him was life and the life was the light of men or glory in this living would shout living with something or I can say living word that living would have to come inside of you oh Jesus let's continue brother the lid of Hell has come off the linens come off of Hell and dreams of demon power is pointing from everywhere you can't see that you walk in normal normal normal but you have seen the little of Hell come on come out and streams of demon powers streaming into homes streaming upon families cheery little churches stream of demon powers listen to this what porn from everywhere is concatenations it conquered politics till it's rotten to the core it conquered the churches until they know nothing but denomination you say are you a Christian I'm a Methodist are you a Christian I am Pentecostal that don't mean no more I said the other day that I've been a pig or a hug or a horse or something that has nothing to do with it you are Christian when you are born again and filled with the Holy Ghost not until that and you are yielded from to the spirit not just you have the spirit but the spirit have you do I asked out is this the word is this the Bible is this the message not just you have to scrape or the spirit of you not even portal go away he just want to go he said the Spirit forbid me he was a prisoner I'm Jesus Christ or get the Lord a shout God looking for prisoners [Applause] Paul said I cannot move on table feet I can't heal the sick I cannot answer the Bible I can go to seminary with all this stuff everything else I'm nothing yet you say hallelujah talk about the little of the capital demons demons going around powers of the devil under the name of Christianity teaching for doctrines the commandments of men Theological Seminary doctrines leave in the Bible alone who was able who is strong enough who is wise enough who is powerful enough to tame this Legion chipping the clothes of a woman in the name of preachers Methodist Baptist Pentecostal paint in your face and jazz no Baba near wearing pants like men our preachers not enough about them to tell them about his devil possessed who is this roaring devil a penetration of power publishers powerless and lukewarm who is this roaring devil who is strong enough what kind of the nomination is able to come to him walking up and don't you pass we don't need a Holy Ghost who can tame that devil God we we can't do it by denomination we can't do it by ecological forces but there was a voice one time that did it [Applause] there was a voice one time that did it that came them devils and put them in the right man and put clothes on them that same voice came as i promised to push that I do shall you do also or glory that God you will never do it in our organization you will never you will do it when you are empty up you become weak poor all all yourself and let the Holy Ghost come in and flood every part of you and saturate every little of your body that's the only way to do it we don't need any organization or Gaia some praises in the house this morning and that's why brother Branham said God did not send me to build another denomination God send me to bring people into the structure of a perfect man where you will be a powerhouse not noriko shop clubs where you have the power on the inside where you could give her a silver gold have I none such as I have I'm a powerhouse that's what Peter was saying or get the Lord I show that that is what must be CC he's the only time you ever come to Jesus but know Jesus in me so I have a by my own power house I'd rather wait to ask for mission to raise you up from that I don't have Silvan global what I have the power that's as president in me this is the temporary power is that Matthew 10 power this is permanent power this is resident power this is a coroner got Holy Ghost power

make you strong and He will give you Christa Stan he will make you strong when you're ready to put your soul upon the brass altar will all your ambitions melt right in front across all your ears or ambitions they said take them Jesus you want this you want that you want the other that's what you want but what does God want oh and when you come to that spot when you want to honor God when you want the precent on the altar or God the will of God the purpose of God for your life everything changes after that Oh hallelujah praise God praise God you got to know God is still God God always was

took the book and brought that first seal God spoke from his eternal throne to see what that scene was to be revealed and then it was placed before John it was in symbol form when John saw it it was still a mystery red horse white horse black horse symbols isn't that right it wasn't even reveal right then it cannot be revealed until what he said here at the end time but a common symbol now remember a loud clapping noise of a panda is the voice of God that's what the Bible said a cup of thunder they thought he was a thunder but it was God he understood it for it was revealed to him it was a thunder or glory to God when he had Thunder is voice of God or glory of God maybe others in here any revelation of it but to you is the voice of God hallelujah glory to God I wanted to be sick

yield that under the voice of the Crete had uttered it he ought to know what is there but I think he wrote this but when he started to write those other seven thunders he said Oh righted it's been commissioned to write everything he seen but when there's these seven thunders in version 10 altered he said don't like them at all they are mysteries we don't know what they are yet but my opinion they reveal right away well do it will give feet for that rapture in Greece for that choice to move out the revelation will give fate for rapture in Greece to move out we just moved to dispensations we just see watch everything we have seen the miche's of God we have seen the appearing of the Great God in together the present last days but there is something in dear we just can't like no sense with there is something or another and I imagine when their missions begin to come forward John God said hold it back no wait a minute I'll reveal it in that day don't light it at all John they will stack over it I reveal it in the day when it has needs to be done they never utter for nothing you remember that little drop of ink everything has a purpose everything of the course and the cranly creator uttered he heard his voice he went to see and the lamb is showing John in the symbol of the church no know what what it is he said don't go down John just what it is no that's what's under

morning hallelujah Sabra Burnham was sent to reveal not part but the whole secret of God for the rupturing of the church and then this coming forth several mysterious thunders that's not even written at all and I believe that through seven thunders will be Raveena last days in order to get the bright together so there's the first filter and bright from church seven thunders will reveal to get the bright together what fall for rapture and feet because what we got right now we wouldn't be able to do it there's got to have something step further we can't have enough faith for divine healing hardly we have got to have enough faith to be changed in a moment that means before you see rapture and faith you have to see faith for the van Halen you have the secret Pro walking blind see and dead raisin up it has to be normal before your ends in a rapture and faith it can a bunch of sick people not getting heal you have to see healing you have to see miracles you have to see signs and wonders we believe that the message Tulsa not know enough or yes the only looking for more preachers and more man to come and review more ministries but I am saying crisis industry unless they have all the mysteries inside of you it's time to breathe in Christ forward and Christ will heal the sick he would raise the dead he will cast out devils Oh glory to God hallelujah or give the Lord a shout in our house hallelujah so you say we found in have enough faith for divine healing hardly we have caught you have enough faith to be changed in a moment and will be swept out of this earth and we will find after wife fine where it is written oh you'll find when I'm done this is up isn't that right Oh glory to God and the reason they can't understand this it isn't the hour we couldn't understand these things until the time comes for it to be understood seven thunders of Revelation may he show the ride how to prepare for create translation see all glowing is what it doesn't matter when the Lord come if you are ready you are fine you can come no because come whenever you want to come but if you're ready that's the main thing how are we supposed to be ready for the coming of the Lord or glory to God hallelujah get the Lord a show [Applause] ox ox 17:11 says these were more noble than those in Thessalonica for they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the Scriptures daily to see whether these things are true they received the word that was being spoken to them plus the sister scriptures it was a living word it was the Word of Life coming from these apostles and these prophets and these teachers and these pastors and these ministers it was the word of a life that would speaking was God that must live in word that was the early church and we are going to go back to that where the word spoke I'm going to be living word living voice word living spirit voice word Matthew 21 42 says Jesus said unto them did he not did you never read the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same has become the head of the corner this is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes now the word scripture thing is a Greek is a word called GRA P is e they never numbering 1 1 2 4 it means a writing acting written the scripture used to denote the book itself or its contents or certain portion of section of the Holy Scripture so therefore this scripture this word grouchy or non pronounce it the scripture used to denote the book itself or its contents a certain portion or section a statement in scripture so when he said the scripture he means says the written word but John 1:1 set in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and that word really is Lobos which is a different thing altogether it means a word uttered by a living voice scripture is written but Lobos word is living a word uttered by a living voice no you will see when we go in and Leroy says a [Music] speech a word uttered by a living voice and body is a conceptional idea what someone said the sayings of God a decree amanda's are order the more precepts given by God Old Testament prophecy given by the prophets what is declared a thought a declaration a witticism a dictum a maxim or glory to God so this word logos I think it's 3:05 6 calling logos a word uttered by a living voice and what is a conception of an idea hallelujah Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is quick and powerful sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even the dividing asunder of soul and spirit of the choice and the marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart that's hebrews 4:12 and the amplified and says for the word of god speaks is alive full of power making it active operative and the Jason an effective it is sharper than any two-edged sword penetrating to the dividing line of the breath of life soul and the immortal spirit of the joints and the marrow of the deepest parts of our nature exposing and sifting and analyzing and judging the very thoughts and purposes of the heart so that word that is the reasoner is not letter Senhora understand while Paul said they left a kill it but the spirit give it life no you could understand well Paul said I come with you - you never enticing words of man's wisdom but I come to you in the power and demonstration of the spirit that your faith may not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God or get the Lord a shout are you ride with me this morning John 6:63 Jesus speakin it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life so he seems spirit different words it was living words Oh glory to God remember when Peter never walked the earth there was no Bible called the New Testament you have to receive them as from God they were bringing Louis word will give the Lord a shout understand that when Jesus came on the scene the book was only of the Malachi the New Testament not written yet but they were living epistles written epistles they will wrote me like the finger of God Oh hallelujah praise God hallelujah no wonder P they can say obviously virtue and to virtue knowledge and the knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness he knew what he was talking about dies not attached like there's something on our board and we paint with colors that's not painted words I just live in Lucas words Oh hallelujah Laurita God thank you Jesus for me fees in church age 5th of December 1960 Justin Saville what about saying all the byberry he's in here he's Almighty God fresh among us no father son Holy Ghost is not no tree God got chopped in three pieces is one God working in three offices the fatherhood the sonship and the Holy Ghost God condescending from the gardener Eden trying to make his way back into the human hands to live and be sons and daughters again with him that's God above us God with us no God in us now those things the battery reveals was thoroughly said in the first chapter of Revelation which is the only book Jesus put a seal on blessing that he that readeth on them here in might hear it so it's a curse for anyone to take anything away this is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ so if we have to make three entry you know what happened your name's goes out you search the scripture you say well that's bound to be I've never seen like that oh here it is it has to run from Genesis to Revelation whatever revelation whatever mystery has to run it can be one care he said he elephant the elephant line upon line precept upon precept not one court not one scripture line upon line it has to come from Genesis to Revelation are you with me this is another prophet I believe God can do things that are not written in this Bible I believe he can because he's God but just as long as he does what he promised yet is good enough for me I don't believe that anything should be others in this book or taking from it I believe this is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ I believe that that is what it is all doctrine anyhow must come from this Bible so anytime anybody can put the doctrine back in the Bible you have to leave it alone all doctrine is scripture so mankind brilliance that presents an worth I'm no scripture for thee because the revealed Word the fact we have a revealed word the world is Scripture is whatever I'm came to reveal the scriptures is not right he said no and if you catch me seeing things and doing things that's not scriptural and promise scripture for this hour the thing to do you owe it to me to see the manager to see that I am straighten up for it because I'm a human being and I want to go to heaven the same as the rest of you done Oh glory the quality of the wood is posnick brother there's nobody

to that he spoke true it isn't me it wasn't the seven angel or no it was the manifestation of the Son of Man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that God unfolded it's not a man it's God the angel was not the son of man he was a messenger from the Son of Man the Son of Man is Christ he is the one you are feeding on you're not feeling man his words will fail but you are feeding on the unfailing body word of the Son of Man Oh glory to God give the Lord a show glory to God I love that coat not feel a man you feed me unfailing body wood of the Son of Man Oh cut a man with that low grade education bring all these mysteries it has to be caught by passing his intellect by passing his human element it has to be spirit yo ghost word coming on the lips are that humble 20th century prophet from Kentucky Oh give the Lord a shout [Applause] it was not theologian he didn't go Bible School so called a clear path that no intellect get upset the channel of God eyes I didn't have a

get me outta here get me outta here well glory to God my god I feel good this morning Wow mama mia all glory hallelujah [Applause] could you take some more question Lancers 22 August 1964 just as well some say brother Branham is the son of man I taught the pillar of fire was the son of man am i mystique that's a good question very good but I am NOT the son of man but II Senora there's quite a difference Jesus Christ was the son of man the Son of God is sort of dated now the reason that question probably have been asked is because people regard me as a seer but I am NOT the anointed son of man he said now he's a prophet a preacher on the English dictionary is the Prophet is a seer one who foresees things and foretell things but under the English interpretation our prophet is a seer so I don't want to call myself anything but your brother I'm your brother and you just regard me as brother Bill but the Branham what do you want to that's fine no what was the other question I guess the one with this was either Solomon here the son of man was Attila fire Salomon no the pillar of fire is the anointing the pillar of fire now this may go a little deep now the pillar of fire is the logos that went out of God to Louis which is actually the attribute of the fullness of God when God become into a form to where it could be seen it was the anointing of the Great Spirit that went forth it condescending command on God the Father the logos that was over Israel the logos dwelt in a human body I was made a sacrifice and when man was in male in the image of God God common in the image of man to redeem man and brought heaven and did hug and kiss each other Gordon man embrace each other as father and son ship when the logos became his flesh and dwell among us I come from God and I go to God after his death the resurrection when the body was taken up and set on the writing of God he says now this logos that was in him Papa Jesus which was the Spirit of God the anointing through the sanctifying grace of the blood brought many sons of God to God which is anointed with the same logos so he so he's bringing the anointing the laws and we saying the logos is that living would logos would the anointed no wonder they are Pentecost it came down that till a fire broke apart like that tongues of fire set upon each one of them not their tongues but tongues of fire said upon each of them an elected selected group identified by this pillar of fire showing that God had separated himself into man do you get it now God the logos separated himself into men God not in one person he's in his church universal that's the reason Jesus said greater works than you do is more right now why God is speaking here to our hearts he's in Africa he's in Asia he's in Europe he in England we ever believe is like added together da is in the myths of them so no one could cut bottle of God and have the Angels are private by the angel of a private room actually to attorney general Vindhya so after the death bear another an ascension the common of the Holy Ghost Paul Saul was on the way to Damascus he was shot down by the pillar fire the logos now you see we can say we come from Bobby went back to God we and Wayne Matten pallava Allah Jesus could talk that talk come from God go back to God in that way what he was struck down by the pillar fire and the Jew could never call that telephone orde unless he knew it was the same logos that his people follow to the wilderness that was not the Son of man that was the logos no vices had reverence and love and respects Jesus Christ the same yesterday 10 for ever he said no no in this last day the logos that was upon Jesus has come back to the pillar of fire again and descending on the earth and this pillar of fire have been identified by

anyhow one little nut from God they do it why why how could they know whether or not from God did all these virtues in there all those brethren the early church had them for choosing them so when God given and not just a little nut they could go and do it just one little nut one or not but unfortunately inside one not and you're going to do it Oh glory to God the first little nut of God compared

was talking about Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he lives and praises hallelujah hallelujah notice the open of the Seventh Seal is also not fearful mystery this one I will speak and I've spoken it's the mystery of the seven thunders the seven thunders of heaven will unfold this mystery and there will be seven voices of these thunders that will reveal the revelation at that time Oh glory to God and from it says this time he said under Ministry of the mission of God is finished what if is them same she's coming for and a home a little church like ours that the Almighty God has come down regardless low estate of his people and you say I don't think so it might not be but what if it is time has run out did you think it'd be serious it may be reasonably think watch these stars falling in the constellation back yonder that angel coming as John was sent the wine of the Old Testament and to bring the introduction of Christ a message will wind up the loose ends and listen and will introduce the Messiah just before his coming the message in the last days supporter Brenneman's would be two things wrap up the loose ends and introduce messiah which is full body word knowing

Li messenger all the messages finished the seven angels wind up his whole thing the angel come not to the earth he isn't a man from the earth this angel brings the next announcement he comes from heaven clover the pillar of light you see one for the partner it was Christ hallelujah those other angels mentions of the earth the reason Ephesus and so on time shall be no more then seven thunders

bodies are going to be changed can I live to see it he said could it be that that mighty thunder or the seven angels seven consolation they are primitive in a form drop from eternity could it be is this the mystery of the thunders that will bring back the headstone whatever wrapped up in that tumblers is to bring back the headstone pulled on the Holy Ghost seven tunnels even said to pull on the Holy Ghost is this the mission of the tunnels never been by the headstone you know the Primo's never capped the headstone is yet to come it was rejected it might be closer than you think it's got me scared I haven't done enough we are we are time shall be no more here not as a time is over what happens bredrin could that be so serious you think if it is then the perimeters capped by the seven thunders do you remember any premium message it's a capstone what did I do no what do you push already right let's continue now the Holy Spirit capped off the individual and sealed it when we add it to our faith righteousness godliness and faith and so forth we kept adding to it there we got seven things and the seventh one was love which is God that's how he makes the individual chaps him and cinema holy spirit if that be so he has got 78 ages that he had seven mysteries that would be song in a way and they fought for to bring back and the head song come to cap off does the Eternals me that my bed seven messengers seven manifestations the Holy Spirit each messenger bringing a message a qualification to build the church to build the individual that we can pin down the cap the last one is love which is a spirit that appear in our lives Oh glory of God that me with the restoration of the image of God which is this which is a perfect man then love is attracted to the lamb because dem sevens virtues bring us back the lamb again and the dust on the leader lamb so once court see the lamb here come the dove Giovanni commensal am not the goats yeah be seated my lord almost done oh

please God Oh glory to God you enjoy the word this morning [Applause] based upon all the course you read and what we preach and share with you let's see how what we preach compared to what what a Judith Coleman testify about 20th of September 1974 let's listen again what he said the Lord revealed the following inspiration was given to me between 10:30 and 11:00 iam the seven thunders are the seven voices of the seven church ages which are seven manifestation of the Holy Spirit as faith Allah voice virtue Allah voice knowledge a live voice temperance Allah voice patience a live voice godliness a live voice brotherly kindness live voice seven voices to build a perfect Church to be capped off with the capstone he builds his individuals the same way these voices shook the kingdom of the devil in each age it's the live voice that is the Thunder that shakes the devil the bride in each ears live the word voice for true for age we have got to live all seven for this age Malachi 4 is taught about that seven the churches seven voices for the bride to live and manifest brotherly kindness as a virtue of a age different charity falls the prey will not manifest one virtue but she will manifest seven voices as thunder to the devil's Kingdom the manifestation of seven live voices and action live by you and true you or get a lot some praises Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah oh my you'll be seated Oh glory to God so that revolution is perfect you can't put blow that up and blow it up with nothing it's just the word it's the word of God is Dossey at the Lord the seven thunders are seven voices of the seven churches seven manifest in the Holy Spirit all glory to God that we could bring back the cap by the voices seven the voices or glory I got all this argument can be built on church Wars it's over it has to have the voices let me wrap up here here you are seven churches seven steps God building his church is like one person into an individual into himself the power of God coming down through this well in this together therefore the pedicles are people that let all the Lutheran oh that's the way some people can call that height and drop off oh that's a big one climbing the perimeter and drop off this is not opposing man but there's a genuine part that keeps making that building comes on watch justification was coming in he brought a photo sign in this pyramid is seven steps go into the King's Chamber watch on the stubborn step if you ever study the dimension of the pyramid watch what comes to take the over come up on come up to introduce to the king watch door station that is standing there and you will see the day you are living in the pyramid so he prophesy one day you're going to see that you are actually living in the

can produce a manifestation of oil and blood and tongues and other science whether in wood or not whether properly interpreted from the word the majority will forfeit but what has happened to the void the will have been put aside so God says I'm going against you all I will spew you out of my mouth this is the end for seven out of seven ages I have seen nothing but men as steam in their own world above mine so at the end of this age I'm going to spew them out of my mouth it's all over I'm going to speak all right I am here in a mess of the church the a men of God faithful and true will reveal himself but it will be by my profit yes sir version 10 seven and this is the voice of an angel there it is here we go he is selling for you with me the final court beyond the stretch here now this is
