your needy children Lord we are not here this morning to hear from man but we are here to hear direct from you father so may you speak to us Lord and father may you touch hearts and lives deal with issues conditions situations challenges problems Lord the parts of us that we don't want to see the parts of us that you don't want to see father so that what is left standing is just what Lord you

burden for the sighing and the crying Lord the abomination in the city you promise to put a mark only on those who sigh and only on those who cry for the Abomination Lord that that's happening in the church happening in the world happening in our homes happening in our families but Lord there's a cause this morning there's a need this morning there's a cry this morning Lord for more of you Lord we

morning in the mighty precious name of Jesus Christ may you bless the reading of the word and the opening of our understanding in the mighty name of Jesus Christ and the church says and the church says amen so I'd like to welcome one and all in the precious name of Jesus Christ if you have your Bibles would you turn with me to three portions of scripture Ecclesiastes 3 Ephesians 1 Romans 8 starting in Ecclesiastes 3 and in just one verse to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven and let's go to Ephesians 1 reading from verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath past tense chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption sorry predestin us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he had abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that's so powerful the counsel of his own will he has to consult nobody is a counsel of his own will he is Sovereign in his decisions he is Sovereign in his choice he is cons he is Sovereign in his purpose he is Sovereign in his will he doesn't need to even know what your will is he doesn't need to know what anybody else will is oh my the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will he takes advice only from himself when he has to discuss you he discusses you with himself he doesn't ever need to go to an angel he don't go to your Pastor you to go to your father you to go to your mother he only talks to himself about you and he designed it that way because having predestinated so your destiny is according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who had first trusted in Christ and our last scripture reading from uh Romans we're going to read from Romans 8 very familiar scripture 28 but very important for us this morning and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are de called according to his purpose so I want us to understand that that that all things that working together for good is conditional there are two conditions that need to be connected to that all things so it's not just all things work together for good no no it's all things work together for good to them specific that love God and if you love God you do what you keep his Commandments you follow his laws you worship him because your love is something that is expressed love is an action word so to them who meet two criteria which is one to them that love God and to them who are called according to his purpose so if you are not called according to his purpose there's no all things working together for good but if you love God and you are called according to his purpose and that purpose is the one that is the counsel of his own will that he has designed it to be that way then you have nothing to worry about then your steps have been ordered by God and you could walk in the joy of the Lord even when things go wrong even when you make mistakes even when you fall down it's a purpose being unfolded can the church say amen for whom he did for no past tense he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning in the the presence of the Lord trust everybody feeling fine by the grace of God it's certainly a great blessing to be in the house of the Lord I'm happy to be here this morning this week was a very rough week for me I wasn't feeling too well for the whole week so I'm here this morning by the grace of God and uh I know there are different viruses and bugs and everything going around but we thank God for his grace that one of these days this pest house will have to not be in use anymore because we'll take on a etal body that could never get sick never get tired never get weary but right now we trying to bring this pest house under subjection to the word and to let him know that there's a soul inside of this body that has an eternal destination that nothing present nothing past nothing to come could separate us from the love of God so we thank God for his grace we thank God for his Mercy you thank God for the song service this morning and The Time Of Worship in his presence hallelujah amen and we thank God for the service last Wednesday from our pastor identification evidence of identity and identification identifying that this person has been redeemed and it was such an interesting thought because he was in Miami last Sunday preaching and he was not here in the Tabernacle when I brought the little thought last week around the Divine mystery of your spiritual identity because if you don't know who you are you already can't get anything so every time it hear about predestination and for knowledge God can't for know you if you don't know you and who you are is something that is you you are an identity you a person he knows you he say there's the mystery of who you are before Mary was born he know Mary before Jeremiah Was Born he know Jeremiah before Moses born you know Moses before George born you know George before Anthony born you know Anthony before Isaac born you know Isaac and because of that be who he for knew he could call he could predestinate he could glorify he could he could put things in place to make sure you're born in the right family in the right house at the right time in the right season in the right environment in the right economic situation to sure that no matter what happens you find yourself in the house of God that no matter what happens that the message of the hour would find it itself in the hands of the predestinated so you couldn't be born one day earlier you couldn't be born one day later you couldn't be born Ino Martin if you were supposed to be born in Porter SP you could not have gone to the Baptist Church if it didn't bring you to the message you couldn't have oh you don't hear me this morning and through all that journey of you not even knowing who you are it just take a point of you coming to a realization of who you are and your identity to recognize that you have an inheritance as the scripture we read and Paul is repeating it over and over to whom we have obtained an inheritance can the church say Amen so with the Clarance I said last week I didn't get to finish the message so I want to kind of continue a little bit from last week and kind of drive a bit further but for a title this morning the purpose of God according to election the purpose of God according to election and for an inspiration a time for every purpose and we have read it in scripture to every purpose there's a Time attached to purpose can the church say Amen so I want to connect to this title firstly the purpose of God according to election so I want to take a few minutes just to read from Romans 9 9 if you would allow me Romans 9 we take it from verse one if the brothers in the back could help me Romans 9 and this is Paul in pain this is Paul in anguish and this is what struck my heart even in opening the service today because many times people lose the burden amen many times people lose the Zeal many times people lose the urgency of the matter many times people forget the Great Commission many time we get so comfortable and we get so relaxed and we get so used to the tradition as the custom was similar to when Joseph and Mary went down to carry Jesus and they were so caught up in the custom that they just did what they did and they left forgetting and not even realizing Jesus wasn't with them because it was the custom become a routine and many people it become a routine to them being in church or being called a Christian and it's really a tragedy when it becomes something that hits Us in the message when we should know more and have a Greater Hope a greater understanding and a greater expectation but here we find Paul in almost one of his darkest moments as it were in the letter that he writes this is Romans 9 and verse1 I say the truth in Christ I lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost that I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart so Paul is saying I have a great heaviness anybody ever feel heavy here is the Apostle Paul saying I have not just heaviness but great heaviness and a continual sorrow in my heart this sorrow not going away I wake up in the morning and the sorrow is there I go to bed at night and I drift away to sleep and I'm dealing with an issue that's just it's just bothering me it's paining me it's not just a simple issue because he is adding adjectives to describe the issue so he's saying it's a great heaviness a continual sorrow in my heart verse three for I could wish that myself were a cursed from Christ for my brethren my Kinsmen according to the flesh I want to read those three verses in the Amplified so you could see a bit more of what's Happening Here this is in the Amplified I am telling the truth in Christ I am not lying my conscience testifies with me enlightened and prompted by the holy spirit that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart Hallelujah this is a brother in pain what is he in pain for what pains us as Believers what pains us as Sons and Daughters of God verse three for if it were possible I would wish that I myself were a curse separated banished from Christ for the sake of the Salvation of my brothers my natural Kinsmen in other words he was in pain because brothers were out of position brothers who should be on fire for God will not on fire for God brothers who should be brothers who should be sighing and crying and be on the firing line or not around and and it's not something that Paul is taken lightly do you take it lightly when somebody doesn't come to church when somebody backslides when somebody Falls when somebody slips or or does it cause pain because this s and cry for the abomination in the city means it's real to us there are people who come to church with no burden you know there people who live lives without Burden Burden is connected to sacrifice and understanding that something has to happen and it it weighs heavy on you there's a there's a burden when you go back generation because this age is different but when you go back to the grandmothers and the great grandmothers they had a burden for their home a burden for prayer a burden to see Soul save a burden to take the burden and and and see souls go down to the Riverside and and and get baptized and a burden to see Parts at the altar a burden to to hold on to the horns of the Altar and cry butall Paul goes on verse four who are Israelites to whom pertain it the adoption in other words Paul is saying I'm in pain because these are brothers Israelites to whom pertain the adoption in other words brothers are out of place who adoption is their portion but they're not in their proper standing this morning and I can't sleep because of it I find myself uncomfortable because of it because they are entitled to the promise but they are not in church can I can I go on who are Israelites to whom pertained the adoption and the glory and the Covenant and the giving of the law and the service of God and the promises This Is Us standing here saying there are people who they are called to adoption they are called to the Holy Ghost they are called to Deliverance they are called to Restoration but but who's going to reach out to them who's crying in for them who's sighing for them who's pleading for them this is not information this is not intellectual this is this is there's a Road to Hell there's a road to Heaven this is there's a road to Salvation And there's a road to death this is a Road to Redemption and there's a road to destruction if you truly believe that these roads exist we should be in pain like Paul was in pain verse five whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came who is overall God blessed forever amen not as though the word of God had taken none effect for they are not all Israel which are of Israel in the Amplified I want to read it so you could see the unfolding of it here from verse four who are Israelites to whom belongs the adoption of Sons The Glory the shikina the special covenants with Abraham Moses and David the giving of the law the system of Temple worship and the original promises to them belong the Patriarchs and from them according to his natural descent came Christ the Messiah the anointed he who is exalted and supreme overall however it is not as though God God's word has failed come to nothing for not all who are descended from Israel are the true Israel they are not all children of Abraham because they are his descendants by Blood but the promise was your descendants will be named through Isaac I'm reading the in the Amplified coming back to the King James now verse eight that is they are they which are the children of the flesh they are not the children of God but the children of the promise accounted for seed and I'm looking this morning are children of the promise Hallelujah D you are not blood and born of the Jewish lineage but you are children of promise you are born from the promise you are spoken from the promise you are evidence of the promise behold let there be let there be a bride in 2024 and here stands the promise the seeds of the promise Royal seeds of Abraham Royal priest Kings in whom you are priest and kings can the church say amen hallu for This Is The Word of Promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil this is where I got a title from that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that call it can I read that one more time Hallelujah for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that call it verse 11 in the Amplified and we'll get to the text hallelujah hallelujah you love the Lord this morning he's talking about the twins now right and though the Twins were not yet born and had not done anything either good or bad so that God's promise his choice his election would stand not because of Works done by either child but because of the plan of him who calls them it was said to her the older Esau will serve the younger Jacob as it is written and forever remains written Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord oh Hallelujah it is sent to her the Elder Shall Serve the Young as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated from before they were even born from before they did even good or evil this speaks to the election of God the predestination of God the purpose of God the design of God according to election might stand in other words whatever God desires to happen is going to happen it may look messed up it may look rough it may look as if it's falling apart and when it seems as if the purpose is defeated then the purpose of God according to election stands up and say this purpose is going to happen or you don't hear me this morning oh can the church say Amen oh Hallelujah I Fe religious this morning so I want to encourage you this morning we are almost there to the convention we

and say I shall not die but live to declare the works of God because the purpose of God is according to election Hallelujah can the church say amen hallelujah and in this election it only have one voter in this election there's only one voter only one vote matters in this election and that's the vote of the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ he has elected you to office and the purpose you are elected for

Spirit Hallelujah the purpose of God is bigger than your problem the purpose of God is bigger than your past the purpose of God according to election can the church say Amen oh somebody preach with me this morning Jonah Jonah was elected he didn't know it Jonah had a purpose uh he didn't know itth it's one thing to not have a purpose it's nothing thing to not be elected but Jonah had a purpose and Jonah was elected and God said Jonah come go preach a message Jonah didn't just backslide Sister Abigail Jonah went completely opposite to what God said he went opposite to his purpose he went opposite to his election but walking opposite to your purpose walking opposite to your election cannot stop the purpose of God according to election Hallelujah your purpose is bigger than your failures your purpose is bigger than the decisions you make that are foolish decisions Jonah made a foolish decision he say I'm going to go to I'm going to go to tashes Hallelujah Hallelujah you think God get upset you think God get oh gosh I don't know what you doing I don't know how we going fix this I don't know how we going and do this I don't know how we how no know Jonah doing what he want to do and God said let him go my purpose and my election I could rest on that I feel comfortable with that all things work together for good to them that love God and call according to his purpose in Jonah's heart I still see he love me he all B up this morning but he loves me and the purpose that I wrote about his life can never be defeated and this is what confuses the devil brother Joe this is what confuses the devil the devil taking notes he said look at Jonah look at Jonah Jonah not in church Jonah fall down Jonah go our way Jonah Jo her boat Jonah go on a a boat cruise I forget the name of them boat cruise they have here now you go a boat cruise and in the middle of that the purpose of God hallelujah according to election is is activated and that ball begin to Shake That B begin to rock and Jonah is no fool Jonah know he have a purpose Jonah know he's elected he say I am the problem I am the problem this election is about me this predestination is about me this storm is about me this situation is about me I own up to it I acknowledge I have a purpose and I'm not in my purpose I acknowledge I've been elected but I'm not living like I'm elected throw me overboard come on now somebody preach back to me you have to have a purpose you have to know your purpose you have to understand your purpose you have to live in your purpose you have to walk in your [Applause] purpose and your purpose is connected to your identity can the church Preach back to me this morning you may be seated I'm putting you on Note is God have to give me the strength to preach long today I don't have the strength I hear today encourage you I told my wife this morning this will be one of them short quick messages to shake the nation because I don't feel 100% but for the little few minutes that I have strength to S this morning I know I have a purpose according to election and no demon no devil no past no present no sickness nothing will separate me from showing the devil whose side I'm on and showing God whose side I'm on Whose child am I now this morning somebody preach back to me the purpose of God according to election Hallelujah and Jonah brother Stephen Jonah didn't even know that in his backsliding ways the purpose of God according to election because God operates multiple levels so while God dealing with Jonah he also know where Jonah have to go they worship a fish God so when Jonah jump overboard and say throw me over board you know Jonah thought he was going dead Jonah say when he did Jonah we make it seem as if Jonah knew there be a fish Jonah was prepared to die you know you never thought about that Hallelujah he said throw me overboard he didn't know what going to happen next but he knew if and that's you need to this is this is a issue of today people don't want to accept responsibility Jonah was prepared to say listen the problem in this ship is me there's somebody here the problem in the church I'm not going to say it the problem in your home the problem wherever because you know why you're out of position you're not in your purpose you're not walking your election but when a father is a father in the office of a father in the house as a leader and the mother is in her position in her Purpose By election and a son is in the house of God in Purpose By election and a daughter is in and a deacon is in his position by a purpose according to election when everything is in order then God can move but that is such a powerful thing because when Jonah got out the boat he can now allow God to put him in order so if you need go get thrown overboard for God to put you in your place H because plenty of us out of place oh gosh father help me help me this morning but the George I left my you know he say should here you fast and you're out of place Hallelujah God will never bless you out of place know but the brand said perfect faith is based on your position you have to be in your position you have to be on your ground you have to be standing on something God could defend and protect and act upon which is your position once you on the Promises once you in your Turf once you're on your terrain once you're in your jurisdiction the devil have to back up but when you go off of your jurisdiction then you are the mercy of the environment anybody with me this morning and Jonah there floundering he don't know a fish already prepared I don't have the details of the fish I don't have the the the biological definition the geneological history the the epical thing the whatever the fancy words they could put to describe it all I know God do it and God could do it whatever he needs to do to put you back in position he could do it and Jonah is in the fish but bam tab say he says he said let been look towards the temple and he say whatever Direction he was looking was the temple [Applause] yes but his purpose according to election was bigger than his situation took him straight to Nineveh and here comes Jonah walking out of a fish those people say well that had to be God whatever that man say listen to him and he said repent repent repent repent repent and he fulfill purpose showing once again that purpose could never be defeated this is an encouragement is also a warning because the story could have been different technically speaking Jonah could have just go straight to Nineveh you know and the purpose would have been achieved that way he take the Hard Road plenty of us like the Hard Road brother pel we want to go through a fish you're going to take the bus but you want to be a a geologist a biologist man venturing where he don't need to venture to try to avoid the purpose but you can't avoid the purpose whatever has to happen for the purpose to be achieved will be the purpose if God's purpose is for you to go to the Rapture I don't care what you do I don't care what you do if God's purpose is you for give you to get the Holy Ghost whether it's 1 minute before the Rapture you will come running down all the way down valenia you will if have traffic you will leave your car and run because it's your time because to every purpose is a time to every purpose and your son I don't care where your son is this morning if your son is elected predestinated there's a purpose there's a time that's attached to that purpose and I'm here to declare this morning the countdown is on the countdown is on there's a time to every purpose can the church say Amen can we give the Lord a shout of [Applause] Praise let me could I just take a little [Applause] don't worry I know we have a number of preachers here who could finish the message brothers who sword sharp your sord with be sharp B say be ready to give an answer you have to be ready you can't be getting ready if these Scouts could always be prepared you you had be better than these Scouts you all supposed be prepared to meet the devil anytime any place under any condition the devil come walk in your street you say now boy not this street now let me take the next one yes you'd have a Praying Woman on the street have a Praying son on the street somebody recognize who they are on the street last week I could have passed here but this week I ain't taking that chance now because once the bride get to know the devil know the devil know the word or that is why he works so hard for you to forget who you are the devil knows what you capable of you the devil know what locked up inside of you you the devil know you a threat to his kingdom the devil know the moment you shake off the world and shake out all them things around you that angels and the Holy Spirit just comes around [Applause] [Music] you and there's nothing you can do to stop it this was a quote that I had last week I don't believe I read it I believe I H I don't think I got it or maybe I did but if not it's still good amen hallelujah from the message the deity of Jesus Christ that's right men and women it's time that we found out who you are because I'm tying purpose to your identity you can't have a purpose without an identity Joseph had a purpose it's never written there is a purpose for somebody no Joseph had a purpose Mary had a purpose David had a purpose Jesus had a purpose brother Anthony Poppa has a purpose purpose is connected to a thing a person a place so there's a purpose for Bethlehem hallu there's a purpose for this Pulpit without this Pulpit this thing would fall on to the ground there's a purpose that's attached to a thing to a person so until the person shows up the purpose has to wait for the person and the purpose is only realized when the person is there or when the thing comes into being can the church say amen that's right men and wom it's time we found out who you are the devil is trying to hide you back tell you that you're some little cow down something you are not you are Sons and Daughters of God the deity is not in heaven it's in you Hallelujah you heard what I said this morning church the deity is not in heaven the deity is not in heaven the deity is in you and that's what the devil is afraid of the moment you realize no one that Jesus could say the Kingdom of Heaven is somebody preach back to me this morning you got to realize who you are that's why brother the Bram said the moment you get to know who you are in 5 minutes there'll not be a back pain there'll not be arthritis in 5 minutes female condition gone diabetes gone high blood pressure high sugar 5 minutes you know could it be today is that day in 5 minutes brother the George if the people could just get a revelation of who they are of who God is of who the devil is oh my can the church say Amen woo come on keep the fire going listen my strength to preach is connected to your worshiper not not your worship to me your worship to God because the environment I looking for a touch in my body you know I want to be in that 5 [Applause] minutes hallelujah sister Williams wanted me that 5 minutes but the terance want to be at 5 minutes but the ash me he looking for 5 minutes is there anybody else in the house looking for in 5 minutes there'll be not a feeble person in the building because we'll know who we are that deity is inside of your somebody give God a shout of [Applause] Praise deity is not in heaven it's in you Hallelujah brother bham said I know you think I'm crazy but let me tell you something brother when you realize that almighty God Lives in You Immortal Life woo it might be a little button this morning but it's growing every time you come to service it's growing it's a little button it's a germ a germ of life it's in you brother George that's what reproduces itself that's what has you here this morning that's what despite your sins your failures your doubt your fears your unbelief it's still beating is better than your heart when your heart can't beat that could beat oh God help me this morning you may be seated that's the real pacemaker you know somebody help me this morning when your natural heart get in trouble to beat it with a pacemaker to help the rhythm of it well in every believer have a supernatural pacemaker when your heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that P oh you make me feel religious this morning that pacemaker lead me to the rock that is higher than I so I get a heart adjustment a heart surgery a heart operation oh somebody helped me this morning ah blood transfusion oh he said a new heart I'll give you a new spirit I'll put in there I'll put the Holy Ghost Inside of there oh Hallelujah glory to [Applause] God the purpose of God according to election everything every service that we have preached every message the prophet brought was an unfolding of the purpose of God Hallelujah according to election the prophet was an expression of the purpose of God according to election but Bram could not not been who he was he was the Revelation the Fulfillment the manifestation everything of the purpose of God according to the election just as every hero of the Bible just as every believer who has gone on they were the expressions in their time and season of the purpose of God according to election what about you this morning that is why death doesn't scare me death can't scare you because we understand there a purpose of God according to election some of us have to go to sleep some of us have to go before some of us have to be part of the Resurrection train some of us have to get sick because the purpose of God ACC count election have to give way for healing we want God to be a Healer but nobody want to be [Applause] sick Hallelujah because you know and and and brother Jody t is said God really asking for volunteers Hallelujah they without us canot be made perfect they are waiting on us to bring up the resurrection all the volunteers who want to be who want to go and wait now nobody wants to volunteer but Joel to go and wait now for brother po to come to Perfection for Anthony to come to Perfection say well listen go wait for and wait for Anthony and wait for brother Joe to come to Perfection nobody want to Vol God want to be a Healer nobody want to volunteer to be sick so God in his Sovereign design pick who to sleep who to be sick who and in true this thing he unfolding the purpose that's why when the man came to Jesus and they asked him who sin his father sin his mother s his grandmother s said this man is blind so that the works of God can be manifest they're looking to blame somebody he said the only reasoning condition is that I am here now and I here to heal him and to show you that I'm Still A Healer I'm still a deliverer I'm still a wave [Applause] maker the lame man who 38 years she go Mar pool he get an award for determination longstanding service award Service Awards he get the 10 year award he 20 year award he 30 year award he 35 year award 38 he clocking him Jorge but fail talk about perseverance some people come to church for two weeks a month two years three years yeah still waiting when I go see something but that day was different Jesus decided to pass his way and Jesus come with one purpose purpose of God according to election that man was the ATT how much people was there was sick Jesus went touched that one man see W up ho and then disappeared to the crowd he could have heal everybody but to every time to every purpose there's a time to every purpose his Purpose By Design By God was to be healed on that day so your healing have a date I want you to understand that to know where if you could leave here with one thing Brother Thompson that your healing have a date that your Victory have a date that your child Deliverance have a date it's just God that tell you the day when God told Abraham you're going to have a son he he knew God knew the date you know he didn't tell Abraham the date Hallelujah because some of us can't handle the truth so God knows what to give us he know what we can handle Hallelujah but rest assured rest confidence your wife have a date your husband have a date your son your daughter your neighbor your friend whoever you love because brother said all you ever love or love you will be there so there are dates assigned to that purpose Oh Come somebody help me preach this morning [Music] so your purpose is connected to who you are I hope this helps somebody I'm I'm actually feeling better I'm not just saying that but the Adrian are feeling a lot better and you know what happened when I said I feel better and when you said I feel better the devil in trouble we go and give him a run for your money this morning it's so much licks the enemy put over the ages because Adam never knew what sickness were but when Adam fell sickness come and we dealing with that thing all these years there will come a time when we reverse sickness but bam say right now we lay hands and pray for people but when that time come we'll command the demons command the sickness to go that's the time I'm waiting for that happens when you get into your position can the church say Amen your purpose is connected to who you are your destiny is connected to who you are your ability is connected to who you are your ability to survive to overcome don't forget who you are do not forget your identity do not forget your purpose do not forget what God called you for I did a Bible study sometime ago the queen who didn't know our purpose talking about Esther I might talk about a little bit today as well because if you understand who you are and you understand your purpose that should be enough to keep you walking a certain way can I say that one more time if you understand who you are and you understand your purpose that should be enough to keep you a certain way and we have enough lessons in scripture and through the message to speak to this Samson knew who he was you know and he knew his purpose and he made the mistake of walking away from it but he was not ignorant of it so we're dealing with two issues here people who don't know their purpose and don't know who they are and then being able to act on and live out based on who you are and what your purpose is so you grow up in the world and you don't know who you are and do purpose that's one thing but when you come into the realization of who you are and what God called you to do now it's on you to live that to act that to walk that and we have examples in scripture of those who didn't know who they were and then those who did and they still dro the wall that God allowed us to see it so we can have examples of what we're supposed to do can the church say amen amen when Jesus was being tempted and tested by the devil the devil did not ask anything about his knowledge his ability what he was capable of his question was if thou be so the first thing the devil wants to attack is who you are because who you are is wor is connected to your purpose so if if the devil could throw you off of being a son or a daughter then he don't even need need to look at your purpose because you are not acknowledging who you are because your purpose is connected to your identity so you have to first accept that you are a daughter and a son of God you have to accept the fact that this message this scripture this word and the message being the interpretation of scripture for our day the fullness every loose end tied up every mystery revealed that we could walk in the plainness of the truth because today everybody else this book is a closed book to the Pentecostals to all the Christians this book is a closed book it took a prophet to come to reveal the mysteries of this thing all the things on to serp and seed and the godhead and the Mysteries and all these things in Scripture that we now know plainly the the the the the the statue of a perfect man brotherly kindness the virtue of the age the seven Church ages all these things that are now plain to us the that we are Beyond salvation and this is about Redemption and that we not predestinated there's no scripture but predestinated to Salvation you're predestinated to adoption Hallelujah amen when I meet spiritual Pentecostals and I say okay wonderful what are you predestinated to as get silence I say read Ephesians so what is your adoption when last of Pentecost I'll preach about adoption he say you know we never talk about that so you're predestinated to something and he has never talked about it so you miss the hold and they of scratch their head and because they have no clue and that's say you are not called to Salvation that the beginning amen but give the example you find the glass you wash the glass you sanctify you put something inside of there a new element has to be introduced so you walk around in the message and that's why in the message we have Baptist in the message Methodist in the message Pentecost in the message I'm not talking about the message or know I don't happy to be I saved I in the message that is that is just your confession and in the message but we talking about going all the way to adoption to perfection all the way till is no longer your emotions and your feelings but you die out and God sending experiences to help you to die out so that his purpose according to election could [Applause] stand can the church say Amen everybody feeling fine in the message wisdom versus Faith Jesus noted by Revelation in the revelation of God's word in his own predestinated life Glory I hope that soaks plum to into your heart Jesus knew who he was Satan was wondering he know that he was a predestinated creature of God that God himself was manifested in him it wasn't him doing the work it was the father that dwelt in him and the church say Amen can the church say Amen oh Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah so purpose there a small teaching is the reason for which something is done or created or for which something exists if you don't understand purpose you abuse things you misuse things you mistreat things if you don't want any purpose sometime I saw a story some of the stories you just have to wait and see if it really sing but the principle makes sense so i' still share it you have to fact check a lot you have to fact check a lot of this St in this especially now in this AI age but I heard a story somebody give somebody some money who wasn't familiar with cash currency and they put it in a rubber band hand them the money as a gift person look at the money had a fire going in there look at the r man take the money TR it in the fire to keep warm instead to play with the rubber man because he didn't understand any purpose of what he was dealing withall this microphone if somebody never I grown before they can say this look like something good to pong Nails in know because if you don't know the purpose of a thing you will abuse it if you don't need purpose you will misinterpret the use of it and the purpose of something is by the design of the Creator if you really want to understand how something is supposed to be used you're supposed to go to the person who made it to design it for a specific purpose Hallelujah but you know us in Trinidad whenever you buy something you don't ever read the manual you actually prefer to call somebody and say how this thing does work and we consistently build on the misuse of things that were designed for a certain thing and then when somebody who is a professional or somebody who is training it uses it the proper way they recognize but wait a minute this is how it really supposed to workall because you've been misusing it all along Hallelujah can say Amen am there's nothing more inspiring than a man or a woman who knows their purpose when you go to school you go to school for a purpose and you could put purpose into primary secondary tertiary you could have different levels of purpose you the number one reason to go to school cannot be to just make friends hallelujah amen hallelujah it is said that depending on the school you go and who you might meet you might Network in the future so that could be a sub purpose a secondary purpose or a tertiary purpose but it don't matter who you know if you dumb and you fail everything I'm not trying to speak badly here but I speaking about not missing the mark of the original purpose so you just go you just you network your way through school hallelujah hallelujah all you leave after school is with friends yes am I am I am I talking to anybody so it's important to understand purpose and what is the primary so some years ago but over it said let the main thing be the main thing it is wonderful to come to church and to be part of the fellowship and these things but if you miss a change in your heart something wrong with them if your behavior not changing something wrong or noall there are people in church their knowledge have increased and it's good because you're supposed to study to show yourself approved that is fantastic that's a secondary purpose the real primary purpose is for this body and this soul and this mind to be transformed be transformed by the renewing of your mind so your thinking becomes different your walk becomes different your talk becomes different so if there a choice between more knowledge or less knowledge and have to trade less knowledge for a change of behavior I rather be less knowledge and be a better Christian than have more knowledge oh come on now no wonder but the Brandon would say I rather be wrong in Doctrine and right in spirit than right oh come on now in Doctrine and wrong in [Applause] spirit this speaks to a true understanding of [Music] purpose I heard somebody say the purpose of money is to spend is that the purpose of money so if you don't know your purpose as a Believer your purpose as a Christian your purpose as a student your purpose as a father your purpose as a mother your purpose as a husband your purpose as a wife Hallelujah because if you don't know purpose you will abuse all these [Applause] [Music] roles you will misuse the seats of authority [Music] I don't know who this is helping but I'm feeling stronger about Anthony so I drive it you know I to drive a little bit one thing we are blessed with the different gifts you have the different officers come in here and speak different things everybody have their unique way of dealing with things Hallelujah purpose there's nothing more inspiring when than somebody who's on their purpose who knows their purpose they know what they about that's it they know what they thereare to do they know what they thereare to achieve but the brandom he knew his purpose he was letting nothing stop him from his purpose and many of the Natural Things We enjoy is because people were created for a purpose to do certain things there's nothing more intimidating than a man or woman who knows their purpose and that's why when you get a re revelation of who you are in God the devil is mad he's scared because once you are on your purpose that I'm a child of the king that means I have to have a prayer life I need to forgive I need to drop my ODS I need to be I need to be in a position to pray for somebody I can't be walking around depressed the Bible say let the weak say I'm strong that's part of my purpose so I need to be I need to be fighting and contending for the faith all that is my purpose I going to work but I'm not I'm not in the culture of the workers there I'm I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God because because of my purpose I dress a certain way I'm not dressing to to please the workers or impress anybody no boy could talk to me no girl could talk to me nobody can carry me to effect or party because of noral purpose there's nothing more dangerous than a son or daughter of God who knows their purpose so what are you speaking on about Isaac God has a purpose that cannot be defeated but you have to have a purpose you must know your purpose understand your purpose walk in your purpose there's nothing more frustrating than a man or woman who's out of their purpose one time the comes in where you going I don't know what you want to be I don't know what you want to I don't know hallelujah hallelujah young people now they don't want to work they they like entitlement I thought it was a Trinidad thing alone but traveling around the world and thing I recognize is a worldwide phenomena people just want things the easy way they don't want to work for it even when God himself worked first day second day Third Day fourth day fifth day sixth day then he put himself to rest people just want to get they want to to to to to to reap into that's why the crime you see going on here is entitlement to know people preer I I saw a video recently of a lady got I think was in Grandy got cuff up for her bag or something I said what will possess a young man to cough a female to get a handbag what is worse is they attacking grandparents and and you watch it and I'm feeling so sick because I asking myself go when you start to have children and you see it what it just it's it's it's it's crazy and when you walk around it have signs Help Wanted worker wanted worker wanted worker wanted here there all over it have jobs in them amen amen do you know God put man on the earth to workall the first purpose was to tell you before he even had a wifeu so when say it was not so from the beginning we really gone down a road here where people don't understand and I shared it many times before in Bible studies that the root word of work and worship is the same same word so your work is your worship and the Bible goes further to say when you're working working to your boss you're looking to the Lord It's a reflection of the very purpose of God by election that he put Adam therefore to work and then he ties it into other scripture because he who is faithful in little could be faithful in much if you got to be faithful for somebody else's thing how could you be faithful for even your own thing and if you got to be faithful in the natural how could you be faithful in the spiritual that's that's all true [Applause] scripture but we bypass these things we with purpose nothing is more exhausting and tiring than a man or woman out of their purpose that's why when you're out of your purpose and and this speaks to even your spiritual walk people say well I frustrated and I L my joy and are you doing the things you supposed to do that as part of your purpose as a Believer Hallelujah because Jesus Through scripture butov read it a couple Services ago my yoke is easy my burden is light there's a yoke there's a burden but I could guarantee it's lighten on whatever you're carrying right now if you're not carrying his own because if what you have is heavy all you are heavy laden and I will give you rest his rest is an easy yoke my yoke is easy and my burden is light and he will never give you more than you can bear so if you carrying more than you could bear and you say a car bear you have to check yourself with how you're living what you're doing and if you're already doing what God want you to do because if you're in your purpose then what God gives you as the strain or dist stress for your character is by Design only to serve the purpose to bring out what he wants out of you so this is encourage you Church to find your purpose your purpose is your protection your purpose is your weapon your purpose is bigger than your problems your purpose is more powerful than any challenge you have dealt with or will ever deal with Hallelujah your real purpose your spiritual purpose the reason you exist the Reason God put you here the fullness of your purpose your purpose comes with benefits your purpose comes with access your purpose comes with oh come on now can the church say [Applause] Amen because of your purpose God is obligated to provide you with whatever you need to achieve your purpose hallelujah hallelujah God is more interested in you achieving your purpose than you could ever be Hallelujah and this is not just your spiritual purpose it's your natural and spiritual purpose God is interested in your natural and spiritual purpose God is more interested in your success than you will ever be he is more interested in your healing than you'll ever be he's more interested in what you eat every day than you will ever be can the Church Say Amen [Applause] Hallelujah when a mechanic fixes a car a good mechanic will call you you say how it working Hallelujah can the church say Amen because he doesn't just fix it and just leave it he checks up on you he say come back in a few months so I could service it and make sure it working good again because he is the mechanic on the job just so God when he put you here how you going when Adam was he coming in the cool of the evening he checking on his creation to see how his purpose is being up oh come on now can the church say Amen it is so sad that most people live without ever knowing their purpose they live their lives without meaning but thank God that this message came to us to call us to a Heavenly purpose a Divine Purpose By a revelation of Who We Are by a revelation of the Divine mystery of God when purpose is not known you could use the right thing for the wrong reason and the wrong thing for the right reason it's ignorance of purpose that drives individuals to abuse their bodies with drugs and alcohol it's ignorance of purpose that drive people to go and put tattoos on their body it's ignorance of purpose to let people waste time when you don't know your purpose you waste your time but when you know your purpose every minute is important every time with Jesus is important every service is important can the church say Amen oh Hallelujah we have a short time on this Earth if the Lord chooses to take us home we want to live a purposeful life how many lives did you impact how many people did you tell about Jesus how many people did you invite to church what is the story of your life can the church say [Applause] Amen oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Oh Glory Glory Glory Glory the angels have a purpose the moon has a purpose the sun has a purpose if the sun decide to do what it wants you know it's chaos if the sun say you know I have feeling to the whole world is finished you know if the moon decide to change and say I don't like this purpose I feel I want to I want to have a change in career but it's even what happen these Sunday had to change his career the whole environment all these Seasons everything changing and man in his destruction with all the chemicals and stuff causing global warming and these things trying to affect the balance of what God created can the church say Amen angels have a purpose Hallelujah angels have a purpose to worship but the Bible also say angel have a purpose to encamp around those that hear him so Angels not just they're worshiping they're Angel around your home they're angeled around your car they're Angel around you when you're in your school and your job I read in newspapers and they hear about all these home invasions and thing and whenever I read one of the St I say Lord let me me be one who fear you so there are angels encamp around my house can the church say Amen you want Angels around your house at night Hallelujah I don't care how much alarm you have there's no better system than an angel to encamp around your house I don't care what security company sign up with there's no better protection to know that you have angels in Camp around you oh Hallelujah I thank God that they are angels with a purpose to protect can the Church Say Amen [Applause] sister Raj I give the testimony of having to go home and I'm wondering what's good on the car came and stuff and all of a sudden and it's more than one situation happen sometimes you see it some you don't see it and that's why I see this morning you have a reason to thank God you have a reason to praise God you have a reason to shout and sing you know what real testimonies it have I think I I shared one one time there's a sister walking the street somewhere and she was walking and and and she passed by and later on when they checked it or whatever and they said did you pass on that road they say well yeah well how do you made it through because other people were robbed on that road that same night and they say when they H the guys they say why it didn't touch that girl they say well why would it touch the girl she had two people walking with her that's what they saw how you explain that I can't explain that but I know my Bible tells me there are angels en camped around those that fear Him I do have to explain it I do have to figure it out I just want to know that the fear of the Lord is in [Applause] me you want angels with you when you go to your job when you wake up in the morning when you on the road goodness and mercy thank you he will follow you all the days of your life that's the promise that's over you can the church say amen and the more you walk in your purposes the more God showers you with protection and blessing and make sure because you are part of his plan do you realize that you are part of God's plan that God has a plan and he using you to fulfill his [Applause] plan I want you to see it friends you may be seated because listen Hallelujah there's nobody who don't get depressed let us not kid it let's not play games in your room brother Bram himself got depressed brother B felt so bad he he went suicidal so let's not play games there are times when you feel down when you feel low and you can't judge somebody when they feel low we need to know where to go in the word to pick ourselves up how to encourage yourself the Bible said David encouraged himself in the Lord sometime we need to do it ourselves sometimes somebody else happens to be around to say come on lift your head up it's going to get better this this two will pass this Storm Is Passing Over you're going to make it I had my struggle I made it over you can make it over to this two will pass hold your head up you want me to pray with you you want me to hold your hand we'll get through this thing together because we are part of this [Applause] family don't let somebody face fool you that they not going through some stuff you know Hallelujah I preach a message about the storm finding faith in the midst of your storm and I say everybody goes through a storm you either going in through a storm you're in the storm or coming out of a storm but storm is part of life so be kind to people because you don't know what storm they're going through and not because my face looking happy don't mean beneath me brother PO is a storm that you don't want to see and when you think that you going through something and I say you want to exchange you may not want to exchange my storm for your storm because my storm might be worse I just might be have a little more experience on on hiding storms because the Bible say keep your head up and and some of us have learned to keep our head up but don't get it twisted we deal with our storms we deal with our struggles we deal with our heartache some through the water some through the flood some through great trials but all of us all of us all of us go through the blood but it's the purpose of God according to election that keeps us standing none of us could stand on our own strength nobody we read this scripture you know hallu that scripture in Romans 9 say it wasn't even their good works before they could do good or evil you understand God loves to take credit Hallelujah God loves to take credit for your success amen that's why the Bible says acknowledge Him in all your ways and he will keep directing your path he'll direct your path because when you acknowledge Him God just feels good when you say that's my God he say That's my boy that's my God that's my boy that's my God that's my daughter that's my God that's my daughter that's my God that's my son said not by might nor by power by my spirit God wants the credit because he wants good what did God say through Jer I know the thoughts I have towards you thoughts of peace to an expected end God have no negative thoughts about you and God is not trying to punish you there's a difference between punishment and chastisement because his chastisement is as many as I love a rebuke and chasen he chastening because of love to get your behavior better he not punishing well I take away money and I take away God punish you no that's a storm to get you stronger for your promotion because the Bible says promotion will come from the East it don't come from the West it come from the Lord when the Lord ready to promote you no man could stop it nobody could stop it but your character has to be worthy of promotion because power without character is satanic and if God give you too much and see your little behavor he gave you a $2,000 raise and you acting like you have $2 million you say well hold him right there yes next raise in 22 years a littleit money went from ritual to Starbucks before let me let me get started prise God hallelujah and not knocking no coffee business thank you Jesus is the behavior because some people you get him a little thing and all of a sudden is where you buy your coffee uhhuh rituals I buying Starbucks I get promoted last week Hallelujah and two little blessing two little blessing change your your whole air your whole walk and the Bible say Pride come in before the fall just right there after pride is just the fall Pride just before the fall God looking brother say for somebody the more that He blesses the more humbl they become these are listen all you fin all you know the thing you know it's not no new teaching have only know the thing the more he blessed but it's how do you find humility in blessing there's a whole message you know how do you stay humble amid the blessing because God pour in the blessing and it's a test of humility oh God help me Jesus the more he bless you where you get humbler is that a word CU you see the more he bless you with a clown the more humble you become and he want to bless you more he want you and he's with David say I want to press your cup you want to press down shaking together running over your cup running over and some of us the first little blessing we get we get pride and we get con out he say well I go on to the next one let me see if this one if I could bless this one and see if this one could get stay in humility stay in humility and what does humility look like humility looks like acknowledging God for everything you know as simple as that you know hallu hallu is the Lord who make it possible my child pastor at night school is the Lord we want say the child bright we tell the child bright and you know much work I do I tell you if you don't I was up with them know 8 hours a nightall Hallelujah the moment you find a way to slip yourself into the thing that what God don't like because he want all eting oh God help me preach this morning anybody with me I don't know why I just I don't know this helping anybody this is not no complicated deep mystery I just taking what the prophet say the Lord want to bless you but if you could get humbler in the blessing you have more blessing to get because he can trust you with more so the word your homework is to take yourself out of the acknowledgment of the activity the company say performance was good is the Lord who do it to you need to practice it we just practice talking caners practice to speak the right things because life and death is in the power of the tongue you know and don't let it be just lip service it has to be from your heart because when you begin to see that it is the Lord who is working is the Lord made it possible is the Lord put food on your table listen you walk in the hospital and see what people cannot do if you ever wonder if you have to thank God Walk a hospital floor and see who can lift the hand and who can feed themselves and tell me what you doing we like to acknowledge well a study hard and and there are people who their minds are to fade they can't remember things they strength fading and you they will my mind my mind is the Lord give you that is the Lord made it possible anybody who achieved anything the Lord made it possible and that's why God is saying you even being here today is not even by your own choosing is the Lord made it possible that's why I can be better than you you can be better than me the Lord called both of us I didn't ask to be a minister I didn't put in an application is the grace of God I just here to share something that say I don't ever see myself as any Minister but others others say it Hallelujah but I want to just encourage you that time is short and if you have been living outside of your purpose because Esther we know the story she found herself by virtue of her identity and purpose and by virtue of the family because she was an orphan and her uncle morai was gracious enough to take her in he did the best he could do and he trained her well in so much that when she stood before the King after Queen vashi was like a woman of this age she was a 2024 womanall the king calling me I driving on there right now but Clarence stop it don't pull me down that road so for a while the king have no wife he say I want to find a wife he find all over the place they bring all the maidens from all around the land and here comes young hadassa who will be called Esther she have no makeup Nails clean you know how long I want to preach on this Hallelujah you see the Lord has make it this is a Comm we can have you see the Lord has make it possible to address some of these things brother Hallelujah Nails clean face clean life in order Hallelujah she grew up right she's well taught she's well trained so she knows her purpose she knows her identity she know she not from the world as it were and even though she has been called into this room with these other women she doesn't let them affect her dressing she doesn't allow them to put on airing and makeup and jewelry and cut this and cut this and snip this and the hair would the only thing they say the hair wouldn't grow and and and anybody they don't want to tell me what you he addressed as the he go drop and breakage Hallelujah all these modern interpretations that he we having a time this morning Hallelujah she didn't let let none of the sisters in the room well not sisters I apologize none of the females in the room to distract her and Esther by virtue of being a virtuous woman found favor in the eyes of the king and his chosen she's recognized she's respected she's acknowledged and the anointing of her virtue speaks for her more than any clothes could do more than any saching down the runway could do more than any outfit could ever do her virtue has a pulse that a king could say that is Queen somebody help me this morning that is [Applause] Queen and we know the story but over had preaching this many times as well with hmon getting elevated to power this is a good a good example of what we were just talking about he get promoted and as he say people supposed to Bow and everybody bowing but one man right in his Spirit why morai can't bow everybody else bowing just this one man morai who morai feel he is this man morai Hallelujah and that one man right him up so much he went to the king and said listen have a people in the land not he and and do you have to understand human nature he didn't say there's a person in the land know he said there's a people in the land who don't really respect our laws our cultures they don't listen to our music they don't really associate with our thing there's a people and you see how B The Squeeze could come because he squeeze it could be just one person trigger a people in one person that fall out of favor with somebody say there's a people in the land and we should deal with them and so so forth and so forth we know the story meanwhile Esther is in the palace she is content She is safe she has favor but she is out of touchu with what's happening in the political world the religious world the economic world the natural world because what's happening is outside of her circle of conversation of influence and she has lacked the awareness so when the Bron preach message like mother events made clear by prophecy and these things he's dealing with the events that's happening around so we could be sensitive to watch Russia see what's happening with Ukraine you see what's going on with Israel and Palestine you see what's going on with the gold standard you see this day is the election in the US his election here in Trinidad next year these things are important we wouldn't spend the whole service dealing with it but the reality is the clock is ticking on the economic World on the religious World on the geopolitical scene on the military scene these things are happening the clock is ticking you might be in a position of safety and comfort because you have been living and it contending and it but it doesn't mean you're outside of the danger zone as it were and Esther had lost sight of the vision she had lost her purpose we know the story meanwhile while hmon is looking to plan to exterminate the Jews we see Paul in anguish in Romans 9 we see the king getting trouble to sleep he say read me to sleep read some things that happened and let me see this going to help me fall asleep and they reading the Chronicles they reading the Chronicles and there was once that there was these two men who plan an assassination attempt against the king and Mori overheard it and Mori warn the king and and it goes on the king say wait wait wait wait wait wait what did we do for morai for saving the King's life I'm getting ready to close out I'm not going to be too much longer I left my watch time Clarence what shall we do to the man that that that that that that that that saved the King's life and what did we do he said we didn't do anything he said this C be right when I in the morning I want to deal with that call himmon hmon is my top guy he say hmon hallah if the king wants to bless somebody wants to reward somebody wants to acknowledge somebody who has going above and beyond the Call of Duty and has served the king faithfully and well and what would we do for such a man Hallelujah and hmon look around the room he say there only one person he could be talking about it's only one person you could be talking about here it had to be me yes he say he say I would want the king's horse and a robe and the ring and the bow down and every everything he have a whole listus Hallelujah I we know this story Hallelujah you say whatever you say day go and do for Mor and that's how God operates so this whole and and true script we see and I I really want us to leave here this morning with something that this gospel friends the purpose of the message is for us to change our lives our heart our Behavior the way we treat our husbands wives family neighbors Believers the world it cannot be you are God bless you Sister in church and to your neighbor your neighbor have no testimony the ne the neighbor can't be shocked you make the Raptor you know Hallelujah can I say that one more time if if you don't let your neighbor know you going into the Rapture they will put it an APB for you if you going missing your neighbor cannot be shocked that you make the Raptor because they can't believe because last week you were such a tyrant your behavior has to be consistent everywhere because your behavior is your conduct is your character is who you are 24/7 I'm not saying you when have moments when you struggle and because still figuring things out he still growing and he's still climbing the pyramid and these things but the reality as we get nearer our Behavior supposed to getting better not worse some of us going the other way we getting better as we get nearer to The Headstone our behavior and conduct which should be more Christlike our behavior in fact should invite a question from me neighbor and know you had a situation but how you manage it boy how you overcome that how you overcome and know the neighborhood because some of us in rough neighborhoods how you overcame how you maintain your sanity how you maintain your peace and though you didn't have much to eat but you made it work what I said the Lord who sustained me it's the Lord who kept me because it's the purpose of God according to election upon your life and you understand that whatever you go through is by Design because the purpose of God this is a simple bible study this morning I want to try to close up with this Esther yes get word her uncle is in sack cloth and Ashes send a message what going on with you uncle look some clothes look some food whatever you need you say I don't want that you don't know what going on our people are going to get killed and if you think that because you in the castle your life will be spared think again because per Advent it be for such a time as this you are in the position that you are in you got to do something and if you don't do something about it trust me Deliverance will come from some place else Hallelujah because God's purpose will not be defeated and nobody will wipe out this line of people here on the earth and Esther had to reconnect with her purpose and make her declaration if I perish I perish in other words if I have to die for this gospel I'm willing to do it but I'm not going to sit down here and let this thing die here you have Paul in Romans 9 saying I rather be a dead man be cut off because of what I seeing with my Bren not being in their position not all Israel is is is is is Israel I understand that but there are people who are called to the promise of adoption and Perfection and these things and somebody need to do something about it and that's what I want to encourage us this morning no matter what you're going through there's a purpose of God in the natural a purpose of God in the spiritual a purpose that ties to your family a purpose TI to your situation to your home and you have to walk in it may the Lord richly bless [Applause] you give the Lord a hand of [Applause] Praise oh let's praise him this morning Hallelujah amen amen and
