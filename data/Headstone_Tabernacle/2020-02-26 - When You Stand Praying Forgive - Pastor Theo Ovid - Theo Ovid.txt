God thank you Father your spirit as we approach your word tonight they come among us and speak to our hearts Jesus in Jason we asked a demon god bless you and welcome thanks for coming out tonight and if avi by bizarre like a return to st. mark chapter 11 we want to read from verse 11 he was 26 oh praise the Lord and Jesus entered into Jerusalem and into the temple and when he had looked around about upon all things and how they even type was come he went out on the Bethany with the twelve under the morrow when they were come from Bethany he was hungry seen a fig tree afar all heaven leaves he came if haply might find anything there on but when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of the figs was not yet and jesus answered and said unto it no man eat food from thee hereafter forever and his disciples heard it and they come to Jerusalem and Jesus went into the temple and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of them that sold us and would not suffer that any man did carry any vessel to the temple and he taught saying unto them is it not written my house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer but you have made it a den of teeth and the scribe and the chief priests heard it and sought told him I destroy him for they feared him because all the people was astonished at his doctrine and when even was come he went out of the city and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and Peter Colin to remembrance see it unto him master they all the fig tree which dog kisses with it away and Jesus answering saith unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall see under this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he said and therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them and when you stand praying forgive if you have aught against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your Father which is ever forgive your trespasses let's pray father we thank you Lord and I pray you would breed your spirit breath life upon your word and I'm touches with life tonight and light tonight in Jesus name we ask at him and you may be seated oh praise the Lord our title tonight when you stand praying forgive or praise the name of the Lord is a great need for forgiveness in this our people don't even know how holding grudges and Ortez thoughts affect the person who is holding the Ortz and grudges more than the person that you hold any author on grudges against sometimes people don't even know your hole in the ought against them they don't even know what they did but you have something against somebody else and you're holding it I'm not affecting all your other blessings because faith is based on forgiveness now I want you to understand that faith is not just by here in the Word of God fit itself is based on forgiveness hallelujah that's what ii would declares when your stand praying forgive if you have aught against any oh praise God you love him tonight hallelujah and Jesus live in that world that that no one note about he was an odd person he lived in a will of perfect feet in a perfect God because Jesus was unhindered in he had that six cells connected to him because he was the Word made flesh hallelujah so he wasn't just tied up in five senses he was connected to this sixth sense which was a perfect feet so he lived in another world another dimension and you are going to live in another world another dimension you're gonna bring you out of your five senses and bring you into a sense of a hidden feet Oh glory to God hallelujah praise God he said half-eaten God hallelujah so MP's I get excited about look the feet race victories covenant he said have faith in God all glory to God said he said no if we live in a perfect faith of a Christian to what we are will be a mystic to the world the people wouldn't understand you you would walk in the spirit what the spirit said you would do what it forbid you will not do because you're walking in the spirit or God one the spirit said do you want to do it because they're living for the will of God you're not living to compete with your neighbor you don't live in the compete with your brother you're living for the will of God that's all you want is God's will and what you will enjoy God's will Oh glory to God that's why the me said I rather be a doormat in the house of God then to be like King in the tents of the wicked or glory the cause you want to be an effective doormat let everybody wipe the shoes on you Oh glory to God hallelujah oh yes I want to be in course well I'm happy and God's will there is no jealousy in the will of God oh he has no Envy in the will of God okay squads will reveal to you Oh glory to God hallelujah going for you to prison tonight God's will see the show tonight boss will for you tucked in everything give them tents in the cut tiny princess named in the bath time you do the same old plumbing trouble come on every hand you do the same Oh glory to God I have a bum set up on you tonight if the power is a come among the people it will not leave me to pray of the people but it will be the grace of Almighty God have a bondage upon you tonight when the headstone come it will come a shout ins not be long in the message I'm not to be shouted let me day long time that's not by the Shelton be show them grace grace grace well Chloe the quality will be the grace of God to you hallelujah hallelujah so this should give you a consolation tonight that bow tie to figure out nothing with your head the same but I brought out rehab or chlorine about the same but I don't know about all these people you're gonna bring you out and be like your family - it's not by night is not by power but it's by my spirits here the Lord Oh glory to God and under message of grace the profits that the church got to be rebuilt a lot of preachers will talk about a key oh yes we build the church with the world all these years but he said the church will be rebuilt that mingo of a reserve I bought a bunch of rebuilders he's not my might and power but by the Spirit of God and no Manti do nothing by the spirit the spirit of self has to do it he said not by might not by power but by my spirit not by intellectual night not by knowledge power not by pressing play but by my spirit saith the Lord or give the Lord a shout in the house Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah brother using a machine what I use a nothing mechanical called using men or Gloria Borger put fire in men and the lasted a pillar of fire could be failing the sons of God no never never stop it no fallen angel stop it what technicians around I mean salami earth and sea's was in the earth the Seas of the sons of God and we are coming back he's gonna bring back them sons or glory the closed unit ordinary for through our supernatural or glory I'm a sailor again you're not ordinary folks you watch Supernatural glory to God hallelujah hallelujah buried Oh God [Applause] [Music] so you figure you feel a Christian soldier for none for not because you're walking on a walk in my sight you're walking by eyes this in flesh and blood but the Bible said will wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers but yet you doesn't think that all the time but the reality is we are not fighting flesh and blood which has an ultimate evil spirits every living day or glory of God hallelujah every living day you can't see them but they still there you can feel them but they're still there influencing and and pushing and manipulating and whatnot maybe Caesar you hear what rusev Attell said Jesus all these kingdoms are mine the gift of whosoever I want just bow down and worship hallelujah sit and see at last I catch him No oh my one man man love disporting to Vienna yes give my reporting this D melting you like that you know hallelujah man one power in his fallen Nietzsche listen listen to be over another man man in his fallen condition lost him for power over other men and Jesus who was the Word made flesh before his ministry take off God lead him the deal with the devil to see how he could handle himself before he can handle others and other things he makes sure the spirit itself nobody's bunch of ministers who say they adopted already they messed up big-time dem em makes me meet Lucy yet they meet Lucifer yet because Jesus was led by Dynamix into the wilderness to overcome lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life in a private test not believers proper in Europe you know nobody wave in your own come on you could do it better and come on another it wasn't that channel it was he taking a stand for the righteousness it was the same is also written or Gloria caught this wasn't a secret deal just as if you as is you okay a hungry of a tentative bread no he didn't do that he washed the stole he knew his power he knew his authority he could have done it but he didn't do it he wanted to prove that man truly shut up led by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth amount of God because the bread hallelujah is limited to the senses but the world is eternal or glory to God you're heading for eternity but we give them all some praises Alleluia so when a man leaves my feet and walks my feet I mean substance feet he's isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ they know you were getting into bright material you were getting into rupture and condition that means that each one of us not just the pasta the Deacons the trustees know for each one of us not just the pastor Dignan trustee that means the deity every individual walks in a world with God alone you're baptized into this kingdom and there is nobody in dere but you ain't God how come we don't hear that much there is nobody in there but you and God not you got any pasta not you got on this area not you got on the church nothing like that you and God baptized into this kingdom [Applause] give me them Kingdom people Agora feel inspired tonight Jesus came to preach the kingdom of God this is what the father's had this is what Jesus preached to Peter now the kingdom of God let's backtrack a little bit here these men fishermen cuspid smoking drinking lined were the one this man with a long beard Kumasi Peter come she won't come I started preach to them and teach them stuff that the scribes and Pharisees wasn't teaching and then he casts out the devil are unclean spirit and that is what started our weakened people when that Devil get booted out they say what never see that before we are customary Pharisees with a long long tall hats and beautiful robes doing all kind of stuff and healing me marketplaces and praline marketplaces but not demon a coming out Satan undercover because they had to get uncovered in oh oh yes as long as he's behind the scenes doing all mischief he undercover that's why Balaam said you don't see when the devil get exposed or the pure face has changed on the platform he said the devil don't like to be exposed people say don't tell I say don't tell don't tell is devil idol me I know what kind of confusion and bakkanna it's a tunnel behind that you know don't say you tell you do I see it the class said because the devil biting your tongue truth is truth okay the Lord a shout lie is lie and he's the father lies but he got xpx pose or glory of God hallelujah because of pride he wants to elevate themselves to the throne of God he got boots hallelujah he went and Telep to the Rangers a tail he lied to them or glory to God they set up another Kingdom and God kicking them on the earth under battle of angels became the and that battle raisin ever since or are you a caught in between that baffle and causing a profit to enter into the supernatural realm already stretched outward to reveal that you already call anointed justified all glory love God as if it never did it that is beyond your senses you may be seated so what butter bottom came to bring wasn't for the flesh wasn't for yours five senses what butter brown came to bring was for the fate that's supposed to be in you defeated in you because all these precious promises have to jam into your feet he wasn't watching Peter than flesh you know he was dropping upon them every promise he could give them to say what's I do shall you do also and then Peter was going to be nitrites or chlorine if he believed on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water you give Chaplin promises upon them if he shall say to the spoken be move on don't talk in your heart you can have what they don't know a clue what he's talking about he said have faith in God but he knew the idea potential he knew they had the gene he had the DNA they had the German them to become that [Music] [Applause] did you get that understand this he is not trying to come down to them you know he's trying to bring them up to him he said adopted you shall know I am in the father you and me and I am you he is puffy sign over

confirming the operation do you get that whatever your bow on earth is born in heaven it is recognised by heaven you become a heaven representative you become a kingdom representative you represent

already when Jesus died at Calvary and the devil don't guarantee Calvary when Jesus died at Calvary he paid the price for your Redemption by his blood you have blackboard you are blood wash or you are justified by his blood I went approver revealed classification he revealed as if you've never did it in the first place your human finite mind address that it is a divine revelation we don't understand if you are justified when you look back at your sin and your failures and your where you come from or what you do how that carnal mind could hold justification it has to be a revelation of God chopping down on your soul in your spirit and when you understand that you are justified how could you condemn somebody else when you didn't work to get this justification Oh Gloria caught that's right when you stand prayer or God will get me started tonight hallelujah when you are justified it's not good just if I not clean man you know is our faith justified again sanctified God taken you as

going to speak have faith in God Oh somebody win free tonight somebody jump in the Earth's the night somebody gonna forgive tonight you have to speak it to know I forgive this one I forgive that one I forget that I say you know do forgive them in your man you know that the cigarette emotional kimochi emotional oh yes hallelujah I don't care they get abused they can rape you get this I don't care what they went through what hell you ain't true that they go stop what God put inside of you I don't care if it was a prostitute that I forgive yourself true I will tell her the drunkard the pipe and coke his - table you're smoking drinking it doesn't matter he justify the ungodly well not even hungry for that one kill me for that boy Oh God no again would [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah my mind Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah I read nowhere whoever I justify who a long dress teacher who never pressed a justified like message thing the figure waving longest is bright he's right anybody looking like Kristin is bright that that women look like Kristin Allen sorry you could make a a rainbow-colored just as naughty like Diana that remember to come inside Anna and the only fat I really come inside when I look up inside we'd ever have to see it your cap Bluff it did ever understand Bluffs when you get kick-out he know what boot season he get he got boots Iranian so he understood and recognized when your boots on he know to get at a red yellow so he could get it again when he recognized you know had a boost as a different thing altogether so now by that demon say Paul I know Peter I know it was me man saying that you know it was the spirits in there no God no us anyway the Bible said you shall know as you unknown let me say it again Mary said you shall know as you are known god no you a certain way you know and the way God no you you don't know yourself yet but he said adapting you shall forget the lord I shall you shall know so there's something you don't know yet but your apprentice that you want to know a doctor or Chloe look good so pizza was speaking by the revelation of his fate when he said silver and gold have I none such as I have I give it was a revelation of the faith that was resident in him and that is the faith that God sent a prophet eternal hearts back true not this church joinin message thing not that that's why there's gonna be a unity of the faith not the message digit not groups disease and fit is based on forgiveness and forgiveness is the blood of the edge you have to have that blood there we go displayed [Music] [Applause] not a secret go tell em take a lamb kill the lamb and take the blood if you have all the blood in the bucket II that's not the only instruction god-given I wasn't in the blood have a bucket of blood you got a pootie blood sitting please you have to apply it not talk about it not solution about it not discuss eped not some emails about it and what suppose about it is they apply it that mean this gospel have we got to have things to apply to your life to your spirit Oh hallelujah the spirit of forgiveness the wife do this your marriage Brooklyn the situation on your son your daughter whatever God always a love stuff and the test is not them and when you see you're blaming them you have to get more mature than that is this that's right and that is why and that is why I'm you explaining all what is why because you do want to deal with you you don't want to face up to the mirror of your behavior of your attitude of your arrogance of your pride because you see forgiveness that's familiar especially when you are right and they are wrong and you have to forgive them and you know they're wrong and you are right but you still have to forgive them no I know let's say me man I don't know D by a man going back ugly but that's a powerful one when you know that they were wrong and you have the T grow and you have to forgive them and drop please do forgive them not talk forgive you know I mean drop it I mean anything to the spirit of forgiveness then make it pop them up and love them up and take them and eat dinner with them and bread with them right now you do you want to shake their hand you didn't want to talk to them your caste and them if they walk inside your head so because if something upsetting your spirit we talk more when you drop it when they get free from that nothing a second your spirit you're free when I say a free you're free you're free to hug them they don't feel a whole you know because they know that their things here but you over come back and you have to give your testimony I love you brother appreciate you brother god bless you brother or glory to God a tango if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us but if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us all our sins and to cleanse us of all unrighteousness or glory to God if we say we walk in the light and we hear to my brother we lie and do not the truth Oh glory to God hallelujah Oh glory to God praise God praise God yes yes yes yes yes or give the Lord some princes tonight [Applause] [Music] this on first John one that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also have fellowship with us and truly our Fellowship is with the father with his son then this is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all so God not any darkness thing God is light in him no darkness at all okay if we see we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth if we say we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light then we have no fellowship with one another that not escape together so evidence of you walking in the light you have to have fellowship one with another subretinal pull away yourself from the faith they don't want the fellowship be in that misery because if you're walking in the light I'm I read it again in the back of this one good God is light and him no documents if we say we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie then he come down if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin because the fellowship identified that the blood for you is the blood for me is there no one blood for you and no blood for me the same blood that forgive you forgive me too and if God put the blood on me I could put the blood on you too with the blood of Jesus cleanses the cleansing stream I see I see I plunge with me hallelujah Oh glory of God do you see it tonight the blood for you is the same blood for your brother so don't condemn your brother don't nag your brother your charity believe it all things who pit all things you don't hope you better fall you know hope he fails you what we make it your hope he comes true they believe in all things for him you're hoping all things for him or glory that God you expecting the best for him because I see a brother anyhow Oh glory to God hallelujah hallelujah one of the big testimonies considering William branham's life was that you couldn't tell his enemies from his friends think about Isaac as preachers and he's talking about when Jesus told Judas whatever no do is do quickly these are disciples thought he was going to buy something for Jesus something he won on the Aaron they had no clue that he gone to get his his thirty pieces of silver they didn't know he done negotiate already and looking to go and collect because this man wasn't made up to betray Christ but Christ didn't expose him there was one among you are you watching them zoom affects a column visit well you know Christ call Judas too he was elected to be among them he was anointed only thing Judas didn't make it was a perimeter but he was partaking of the ministry and Berman said his ministry was not inferior to the rest I [Music] want to say that again Julis ministry was not cut ministry I was finally Kentucky boy I don't know uh yeah yeah II given some praises people [Applause] hey glory hallelujah just give him some worship praise the Lord I share scriptable my wife's crib that blew my mind from Deuteronomy chapter 13 it says this year if there is among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and giveth thee a sign or a wonder and the sign or the wonder come to pass whereof he speak unto thee seeing so so if you give us an I wonder and it come to pass then afterwards saying let us go after other gods which thou has not known and let us save them don't shut not happen under the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams for the Lord your God prove it you to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul listener again if what the person said come to pass the wonder come to pass and the prophecy on the past you have to go to all and after that come to pass I say let me go show off the word show tell them no tell them keep your prophecy keep your sign and your wonder now if you're iooking and you can't wait to see something you will be deceived God say I only
