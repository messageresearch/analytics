[12:19] India brother ULU and I ministered in
[12:23] the city called loau and we had a real
[12:26] tremendous experience am um
[12:29] there were we got back uh got testimony
[12:32] of people who were healed in their homes
[12:34] as request for me me for prayer one
[12:37] brother saw the fire the fire Pillar of
[12:40] Fire others in meeting felt the fire but
[12:43] as one brother says most of all lives
[12:45] would
[12:47] change
[12:49] lives would
[12:51] transform but I will brought a
[12:53] tremendous inspiration on the seven
[12:54] Thunders showing is not even but the
[12:56] brand Thunders it's Christ Thunders amen
[13:00] Mighty Angel it came out of his mouth
[13:01] seven Thunders out of the voices from
[13:04] out the mighty Angel really really
[13:06] powerful amen and um the other brothers
[13:10] we were there we were tremendously
[13:11] blessed we still awaiting the Taps and I
[13:13] know it will be a blessing to
[13:16] you I spoke on the sovereignity of the
[13:19] local church and there's a fivefold
[13:21] Ministry
[13:24] yet how ministers have messed up so bad
[13:28] that um I was asked a question is there
[13:31] going to be a universal
[13:33] Pastor that one kind of blow me out so I
[13:37] told them if you're going to have that
[13:38] then you'll get a universal
[13:41] poop a universal message
[13:44] poop so we Pope pontiff and you Mr
[13:48] Francis or whatever so the Lord help us
[13:50] to address that I call that present
[13:53] matness where ministers are telling the
[13:56] people who's in the fold and who's not
[13:58] in the fold and go only to the fivefold
[14:00] and don't even listen to a local
[14:02] Minister but this is the exact nicolan
[14:05] Spirit sir that God said he hit in the
[14:08] church ages isn't that right which is
[14:11] the spirit to conquer the Ley the way in
[14:14] which they were conquered God must use
[14:16] men and the fivefold Ministries are
[14:18] gifts to the entire world but you cannot
[14:21] break the sovereignity of the local
[14:23] church so I told them I'm not there to
[14:26] govern them in India rule them Bishop to
[14:27] them anything like that I come to put my
[14:29] shoulder to the wheel to men who are in
[14:32] the vineyard amen men have like Precious
[14:34] fate facing this great battle I'm not
[14:37] going to answer for India or Africa or
[14:38] America or anywhere else right here I'm
[14:40] going to answer I'm going to answer
[14:43] for so then I spoke about the five4
[14:47] ministry yet so we had a tremendous time
[14:50] so we thank God for it and thank God for
[14:51] your prayer and uh God did answer your
[14:55] prayer for those
[14:58] meetings well I heard s the message
[15:00] messages put away childish
[15:03] things and um well teren exhorting on
[15:07] your position and finding your position
[15:10] acting on it am it's on the website so
[15:12] if you haven't heard it you should hear
[15:14] it and I really enjoy some things he
[15:17] said he said um all
[15:20] you call no man can come come except the
[15:23] father draw him so what you're doing
[15:27] here kind of like that no one could come
[15:31] except the father draw him so what you
[15:32] doing here the only reason you're here
[15:34] because the father draw you you didn't
[15:36] you didn't come on your own the father
[15:38] Jo that's why you're here I mean that
[15:40] was such a blessing the whole thing and
[15:43] um when I was a child I speak like a
[15:45] child I understood as a child and What U
[15:49] so strange read the same scripture in
[15:50] India 1 Corinthians 13 and he was
[15:53] bringing out a child how the Bible
[15:55] placed it when I was a child I speak
[15:57] like a child and that's what a child
[15:59] does is speak first before even thinking
[16:02] you ever see a 18mon old child could
[16:04] talk see a year and a month year old
[16:07] child say and say look a
[16:09] baby 18 months looking at 12 months and
[16:12] saying look a
[16:14] baby when I was a child I speak like a
[16:17] child I understood like a child but when
[16:19] I became a man I put away childish
[16:20] things and God requiring us to put away
[16:23] childish things but so when you see
[16:26] people speaking without thinking without
[16:29] understanding you know that is immature
[16:31] they speak because they have a mouth
[16:33] child children speak because they they
[16:35] know words they repeat words they say
[16:37] back what other people saying and many
[16:39] time people doing that they don't have
[16:40] their own Revelation so they're
[16:42] repeating what others saying without
[16:45] real understanding they're saying what
[16:48] this one is saying but Peter Peter
[16:50] didn't do that some say you're are John
[16:51] the Baptist some say you are this some
[16:53] say that but who do you say that I am
[16:54] and Peter said thou are the Christ the
[16:56] son of the Living God and then God
[16:58] blessed and so on Flesh and Blood had
[17:00] not revealed to you but my father and
[17:02] that was the first time the word church
[17:03] was used Upon This Rock I will build my
[17:10] church that's the first time the word
[17:13] church was used Jesus used it he said I

[23:33] well this morning I have a title the
[23:36] passion to know the
[23:38] word that's the title this morning the
[23:40] passion to know the word I have a
[23:45] subject the knowledge of the Son of
[23:48] God and I have an
[23:51] inspiration God said so amen amen have a
[23:55] context scripture from Psalms 119
[23:59] verse 9 says where it th shall a young
[24:01] man cleanse his
[24:03] way by taking heed there unto according
[24:06] to Thy Word with my whole heart have I
[24:10] sought thee am oh let me not Wonder from
[24:13] thy
[24:14] Commandments Thy word have i hidden my
[24:17] heart that I might not sin against thee
[24:21] I think that scripture what reading
[24:22] again this is from Psalms
[24:24] 119:9 where ital shall a young man
[24:27] cleanse his way how is a young man to be
[24:29] cleansed by taking heed there to
[24:32] according to Thy Word with my whole
[24:35] heart have I sought thee oh let me not
[24:38] Wonder from thy Commandments Thy word
[24:42] have i hidden my heart that I might not
[24:45] sin against thee so his word you could
[24:47] actually hide it in your heart you could
[24:50] treasure it nobody can see it on you
[24:52] it's inside of them you are covered
[24:54] inside your heart David said with my
[24:56] whole heart I sort out to thee
[24:59] now passion means a strong feeling or
[25:02] enthusiasm or excitement for something
[25:05] that's what a passion is it's enthusiasm
[25:08] a strong feeling that causes you to act
[25:11] in a dangerous way that's when you have

[29:27] was reading veran for nevertheless I
[29:28] have somewh against thee because thou
[29:30] has left thy First Love
[29:33] Hallelujah you see I like your labor I
[29:36] like how you hate them who H hate the
[29:40] nicolan spirit I like how you're
[29:42] challenging them who say the apostles
[29:44] are not and to be Liars you're exposing
[29:46] Liars they pulling a rank on you you're
[29:48] checking them out by the word of God
[29:51] Amen Hallelujah nobody pulling W over
[29:53] your eye no you know the word because
[29:55] Paul taught them they used to tell them
[29:57] you're not preaching what Paul preach
[29:59] you're not preaching what Paul preached
[30:00] Paul is a messenger of the age he's a
[30:02] star he's the in the right hand of
[30:04] almighty God you got to say what Paul
[30:05] say Amen if you're not say what Paul say
[30:07] you are false
[30:10] [Applause]
[30:11] amen that's how these Dre that's how
[30:14] these Ephesians Believers were like that
[30:16] they were in the word they know the word
[30:19] Oh Glory to God they had a passion to
[30:21] know the
[30:22] word they a Zeal to know the word they
[30:25] just come to church they want to be just
[30:27] in the message they want to become the
[30:29] message do you know your
[30:31] message hallelujah
[30:34] hallelujah so God have a complaint
[30:36] against them God you left your first
[30:38] love that works that building that Deon
[30:42] ushers and Elders that everything you
[30:43] can think about but the love was not
[30:46] there Hallelujah because for God it has
[30:49] to be about love you have to love him to
[30:52] truly serve him isn't that right listen
[30:55] to The Prophet now okay here we go
[30:59] to understand this you must
[31:01] realize that this now he's referring to
[31:03] this same statement nevertheless I have
[31:05] somewhat against thee because th was
[31:07] left thy first love to understand this
[31:11] you must realize the spirit is not
[31:15] speaking to the original Saints of
[31:16] Ephesus
[31:18] alone this message is to the entire age
[31:22] which lasted 120 years the message then
[31:25] is to all the generations in that span
[31:29] Now history keeps repeating itself in
[31:32] the generation of Israel we see Revival
[31:34] in one generation only to see the fires
[31:37] fading in the next in the third
[31:39] generation The Embers may be glowing
[31:40] slightly fourth there'll be no vestig of
[31:43] the original flame then God have to
[31:45] light the fire again and the same
[31:48] process is repeated what is he saying
[31:51] God's fire start off It Go lower It Go
[31:53] lower then you had to find it because
[31:55] you a see no fire right I will fire out
[31:59] and God the light is again fire flare up
[32:03] Zeal enthusiasm passion love of God and
[32:06] then fire cool down cool down and that
[32:09] repeat over and over so listen to how we
[32:12] describe it then God lights a fire again
[32:15] same process is repeated it's simply the
[32:17] manifestation of truth that God has no
[32:20] grandchildren that's right amen
[32:22] salvation is not passed by natural birth
[32:24] anymore than there's any truth to
[32:25] Apostolic succession that's right isn't
[32:28] in the word amen you start out with
[32:30] truly Born Again Believers amen and then
[32:33] the next generation are no longer just
[32:35] playing Christians but they have taken a
[32:37] denominational name they are now
[32:39] Baptists methodists that's exactly what
[32:41] they are too they are not Christians you
[32:43] have to be born of the will of God not
[32:47] the will of man not because your mother
[32:49] in church is a Christian your father in
[32:51] church Christian is to be
[32:53] [Music]
[32:56] Christlike Hall
[32:58] like brother tell me some of the most
[33:00] evil people you ever meet is in this
[33:01] message a good
[33:05] Lord that not bad behavior people know
[33:07] that not backing people they go on the
[33:09] other side now they need believe but the
[33:12] evil evil spirited now watch they are
[33:16] not Christians you have to be born of
[33:17] the will of God not of the will of man
[33:19] to be saved but these folks are all
[33:21] coming together by the will of man now I
[33:23] don't say that some of them not AR of
[33:25] right with God no but the original fire
[33:28] has died down this is where I get it
[33:30] from now and I see three message inside
[33:32] today the fervent desire to please God
[33:36] the passion to know his word the cry for
[33:39] reaching out in the spirit all begins to
[33:42] fade and instead of the church being on
[33:45] fire with the fire of God it has cooled
[33:47] off and become
[33:49] former that is what was happening to the
[33:51] Ephesians they were getting a bit formal
[33:54] the abandonment to God
[33:59] was dying out and people here we go
[34:02] weren't too careful about what God
[34:04] thought of them as they begin to be
[34:07] careful about what the world thought of
[34:10] them so then you have to do your here a
[34:12] certain way because you want nobody
[34:14] laugh at you they had to dress a certain
[34:16] way because they don't want laugh at you
[34:17] and you see Muslims you see people in
[34:19] the gong it could be hot and they only
[34:21] the eye alone showing they're not
[34:23] ashamed they're wearing the black you
[34:25] can see the juice the black pants the
[34:27] same white shirt you don't there one
[34:29] shirt and one pants they have every time
[34:30] you see them the same color they're not
[34:32] even looking colorful about it they have
[34:34] the thing in the back of the head boys
[34:35] are little curs and so on you can see
[34:37] them from a distance but Christian
[34:38] getting fight to even bow their heads
[34:40] and pray for their meals in public
[34:43] hallu we're talking about an abandonment
[34:46] to God and every time I see these
[34:48] extremities I tell myself why we can't
[34:50] be not so much extreme but zealous and
[34:54] enthusiastic about this glorious message
[34:57] and this evening light that God brought
[35:00] of us understand we were wretched

[44:53] focused himself away from the Beauty and

[47:07] that purpose so he focused it all out
[47:09] Pharaoh did not have that potential he
[47:12] was offered it but he refused it and
[47:14] when you refuse it you can't focus amen
[47:16] amen but made a powerful statement you

[55:37] first when you're not in the word
[55:39] hallelujah how could you put first God
[55:41] first when you don't have a passion to
[55:42] know the will of God you know what Jesus
[55:45] said I must be
[55:48] about my father's business my father's
[55:52] business is to finish the
[55:54] work that means his father's business
[55:56] was in the word am when Jesus went into
[55:58] the temple he didn't just read any
[56:01] Scripture the Bible said he found the
[56:04] place where it was written how could he
[56:08] find that if he wasn't in the word he
[56:10] was in the word he knew where to find it
[56:14] he knew when to find it he knew when to
[56:16] read it he know when to fulfill it that
[56:19] is what said he was so on point he was
[56:24] so caught up with word and thought of
[56:28] God and expressing God's thoughts that
[56:31] one day say heaven would pass away but
[56:33] my words could never pass away that's
[56:37] how conscious he became of the power now
[56:40] mind you the prophets had the authority
[56:44] also when Elijah cursed the children the
[56:46] Bears came after them because said God
[56:47] had to honor their his word because was
[56:49] the word of a prophet Prophet is the mie
[56:52] of God so they had to be careful what
[56:54] they say that curse was a curse blessing
[56:56] was a blessing or when they release your
[56:58] blessing nobody could take that back
[57:00] when there is a curse nobody could take
[57:02] that back so when the prophet blesses
[57:04] you you are blessed come on say Amen
[57:06] somebody when that word is released from
[57:09] his mouth you have it that's why when
[57:11] Christ came down the mighty Angel and
[57:13] seven tunders utter the voices when that
[57:15] voice is uttered to you nobody could
[57:17] take that
[57:19] away from
[57:21] you oh glory and God show you who you
[57:24] are when God show you your sunship then
[57:27] no devil could take that away Satan is
[57:29] jealous this morning because he can't be
[57:32] who you are he can't get what you are
[57:35] about to receive he has no inheritance
[57:37] in this

[57:59] his word is truth always the truth his
[58:02] believing children believe for it and
[58:04] cry for it until his word is Vindicated
[58:07] his word is always his will and if you
[58:10] want to know what the will of God is
[58:12] find it in the Bible once it's God's
[58:15] word it his will is God will for you to
[58:18] testify is God will for you to give him
[58:19] praise and glory I would all men

[1:10:01] now
[1:10:03] Hallelujah you kind of look at me
[1:10:06] strange I seen four fine young men young
[1:10:09] wives fine women I know them boys love
[1:10:11] their wives I said to them here's the
[1:10:12] way to test it if your wife before you
[1:10:17] were married say you before married life
[1:10:20] you've been dreaming you were married
[1:10:21] you really wasn't married but you dream
[1:10:22] you were and you woke up and went and
[1:10:25] talk it over with your girlfriend and
[1:10:26] said you know I dream we were married
[1:10:29] and we had children we living happy and
[1:10:31] waiting for the coming of the Lord and
[1:10:32] everything else and this girl said to
[1:10:34] you you know I love another man better
[1:10:36] than I love
[1:10:37] you I would be happier with the other
[1:10:39] man could you from your heart love her
[1:10:45] well enough to say God blessing rest
[1:10:48] upon you my dear go with this other man
[1:10:51] amen amen now that's serious stuff
[1:10:56] that is not skim
[1:10:58] milk you see you see how the amen's
[1:11:01] light light light light God this is
[1:11:04] serious stuff now check that each of you
[1:11:08] man or woman if your love is
[1:11:11] correct you would do that for you are
[1:11:17] interested in her
[1:11:20] welfare you see there are so many
[1:11:22] selfish people what come them out is I
[1:11:25] myself and I come back
[1:11:28] again so the story is I myself I what I
[1:11:32] want what I feel what I want they're
[1:11:34] selfish they don't give to those
[1:11:36] and the strange thing something open up
[1:11:38] to me about selfishness selfish people
[1:11:40] get jealous because there's one all for
[1:11:42] themselves when they see somebody have
[1:11:43] more than them or better than them they
[1:11:45] get a fight and get more selfish they
[1:11:47] get what them
[1:11:50] have so God could hardly bless somebody
[1:11:53] that is selfish because the blessing
[1:11:54] stop right there that's right the
[1:11:56] blessing stop shuts down there when God
[1:11:59] finds somebody that could give he
[1:12:01] channels things through them and the
[1:12:03] more they could give the more they get
[1:12:04] to give and God just using them because
[1:12:07] they come make a Channel of God's love
[1:12:09] and presence God know if he drop too
[1:12:10] much a bless up on that selfish Rascal
[1:12:12] that Rascal will keep it for themselves
[1:12:14] it goes nowhere so God like to get
[1:12:16] people that could he could flow through
[1:12:18] there is my spirit flowing freely there
[1:12:21] is my life there is my love flowing
[1:12:25] there is my grace flowing there is my
[1:12:28] power flowing because Christianity is
[1:12:31] not living for yourself it's living for
[1:12:33] others come on give the Lord a shout
[1:12:35] that's what e life
[1:12:38] is you don't come here for you you come
[1:12:40] here for somebody else it makes life
[1:12:43] worth
[1:12:44] living oh Hallelujah joy to testify a

[1:15:43] revelation 22 I testify unto every man
[1:15:46] whether B say that's priest Pope Bishop
[1:15:48] State presor whatever that hear the
[1:15:50] words of the prophecy of this book If
[1:15:52] any man shall add unto these things God
[1:15:54] shall add to him the plagues that are
[1:15:56] written in this book amen he said what
[1:15:58] about your Dogma what about your
[1:16:00] unscriptural Creeds you're listening to
[1:16:02] all the nomation there's not one excuse
[1:16:04] if any man shall take away from the
[1:16:08] words of the book of this prophecy God
[1:16:11] shall take away his part out of the book
[1:16:12] of life and out of the holy city but
[1:16:15] abam though he be a preacher though he
[1:16:17] be a church member all his life though
[1:16:19] he be a bishop a pope whosoever shall
[1:16:22] take one word just one word do you
[1:16:25] realize it was one word that Eve doubted
[1:16:27] caused all this trouble one spoken word
[1:16:30] of God doubted caused every sickness
[1:16:33] every disease every hospital to be built
[1:16:35] every operation to be performed just one
[1:16:38] word mixing you got to take the way God
[1:16:41] spoke it and won't mix with nothing
[1:16:44] Jesus said if you have faith like a
[1:16:45] mustard seed a mustard seed don't mix is
[1:16:49] that kind of Faith just one word isn't
[1:16:51] that right blessed be the name of the
[1:16:53] Lord so watch
[1:16:55] and we went that the seed started first
[1:16:58] and then slightly doubted and in Sarah
[1:17:00] and then he went on to Mary so today
[1:17:04] confused about the evidence of the Holy
[1:17:05] Ghost amen Satan can impl in any kind of
[1:17:07] gift of God but he cannot bring that
[1:17:09] word word by word that's where he failed
[1:17:12] in the Garden of Eden that's where he
[1:17:14] always failed and that's where the tape
[1:17:16] and false anointed ones they can be
[1:17:17] Anointed with the spirit speak in
[1:17:19] tongues shout preach the gospel and
[1:17:21] still be a
[1:17:23] devil did you hear that church amen
[1:17:26] anointed and still be a devil that's
[1:17:28] right but now the same thing is this if
[1:17:31] here we go if you are Son of God and if
[1:17:34] I am a Son of God or daughter of God we
[1:17:36] were in God at the beginning amen and
[1:17:38] when Jesus became the fullness of the
[1:17:40] word then we were in him in germ form
[1:17:43] amen when he was crucified we was
[1:17:46] crucified in his body am when he rose
[1:17:49] from the dead we rose with him and since
[1:17:51] we recognize that we are now set in
[1:17:53] Heavenly places
[1:17:55] in Christ Jesus because we are Sons and
[1:17:58] Daughters of God we are God's children
[1:18:01] we are attributes of God and when Jesus
[1:18:04] became all the world that we were part
[1:18:07] of him there you are and there is no
[1:18:09] devil no powers can ever move it that's
[1:18:12] the typos of the
[1:18:15] Soul no devil could move that no
[1:18:18] Minister could move that no Bishop no
[1:18:21] Pope could take your name out of the
[1:18:23] Lamb's Book of Life you are the words of
[1:18:25] the
[1:18:26] book Hallelujah that's why the book had
[1:18:30] to open because you are the words of the
[1:18:33] book come on say Amen somebody you were
[1:18:36] Jean thoughts in the back part of his
[1:18:38] mind but the word is a thought expressed
[1:18:42] so the thought had to be
[1:18:43] spoken Oh Glory to God to come into a
[1:18:48] manifestation and God said my word shall
[1:18:51] not return unto me void but it shall
[1:18:54] accomplish your purpose i s for to
[1:19:00] accomplish oh hallelujah hallelujah oh
[1:19:04] glory to God
[1:19:06] hallelujah so I don't care how much you
[1:19:08] can preach how much you love this and
[1:19:11] love that's one of the Outlets of the
[1:19:12] spirit you can't love with your buddy
[1:19:15] you love with your spirit that's one
[1:19:17] Outlets of the spirit you can love and
[1:19:18] even love God and still not be right you
[1:19:20] can cast out Dev and preach and do these
[1:19:22] things and still not be right but in the
[1:19:23] beginning was the word
[1:19:25] the word was with God and go was God you
[1:19:27] see the word touching your very Soul
[1:19:31] that's why Jesus could go to the one
[1:19:32] well and see what was in her soul the
[1:19:35] world see she was a prostitute she was
[1:19:37] living with this man and that man but
[1:19:38] Jesus saw beyond all of that and saw the
[1:19:41] seed in that woman and the word went to
[1:19:43] call the word the word went to call the
[1:19:46] thought the word went to call the
[1:19:50] attribute amen amen amen hallelujah amen
[1:19:55] so when the mighty angel came down he
[1:19:57] had to had a man on the earth that he
[1:20:00] could step in through to speak the word
[1:20:02] that Adam was supposed to speak because
[1:20:04] Adam was supposed to make and multiply
[1:20:07] and get back more Sons and Daughters of
[1:20:09] God but because Adam fell we have to go
[1:20:12] back to a whole cycle and now don't come

[1:20:16] sweat back Wings one with the seven seal
[1:20:19] seven T of in the voices to bring back

[1:20:26] passion to know the word a passion for
[1:20:29] that book give me the
[1:20:32] [Applause]
[1:20:38] book hallelujah oh glory to God
[1:20:42] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh
[1:20:44] glory to God hallelujah praise God
[1:20:47] hallelujah hallelujah there are some
[1:20:49] denomination and churches amen that are
[1:20:51] ultimately their Believers this is my
[1:20:54] church this is this is my church this is
[1:20:55] my church they love their Church the
[1:20:58] Catholic love their priests love the
[1:21:00] nuns love Rome love Pope Francis that's
[1:21:03] that is De
[1:21:08] Pope but to me and to the ones that I
[1:21:12] hope I'm leading to Christ and by Christ
[1:21:15] the Bible is our ultimate amen let every
[1:21:18] man words be a lie mind be true no we
[1:21:22] talk about some church Baptist Church
[1:21:23] meod Church yes Jesus all right the
[1:21:25] first time the word church was used was
[1:21:28] when he said Upon This Rock I will build
[1:21:31] my church it was upon spiritual
[1:21:33] revelation of who of Jesus
[1:21:36] Christ not of some man not of some group
[1:21:41] it's the revelation of Jesus
[1:21:44] Christ Hallelujah bringing us into the
[1:21:47] knowledge of the Son of God yes you know
[1:21:50] Jesus
[1:21:51] personally hallelujah hallelujah
[1:21:56] he said want to if you want to read it
[1:21:58] and you quote the scripture Revelation 1
[1:22:00] 1-3 the Bible is the revelation of Jesus
[1:22:02] Christ that's ahuh now we come back to
[1:22:05] something the Bible is what re the Bible
[1:22:08] is what re so the Bible is not just a
[1:22:11] history book A book of laws and ethics
[1:22:13] and behavior and what that is are people
[1:22:15] who not even Christians that behave real
[1:22:17] nice nice behave respectful humble and
[1:22:19] whatnot that's right praise God but the
[1:22:22] Bible is the revelation of of Jesus
[1:22:25] Christ not of some group not of some
[1:22:28] Bishop not of some Pope the revelation
[1:22:30] of Jesus Christ isn't not right so the
[1:22:34] Bible is the complete revelation of
[1:22:35] Jesus Christ wrote by the prophets
[1:22:38] Elijah all that they were were in him
[1:22:41] all that you are all that I am is in him
[1:22:44] words Witnesses of the word so it's not
[1:22:47] a book of systems moral ethics neither
[1:22:50] is it a history book or book of theology
[1:22:51] it is not it's the revelation of Jesus
[1:22:54] Christ God himself revealed from word to
[1:22:58] flesh that's why the say and the word
[1:23:01] became flesh and dwell Among Us this
[1:23:04] thought this word this expression
[1:23:07] actually become flesh that we could
[1:23:09] handle it that he touched me who touched
[1:23:12] me the word made flesh oh Hallelujah
[1:23:17] isn't that right God here we go God
[1:23:21] himself revealed from word to flesh
[1:23:25] that's what it is the Bible is the word
[1:23:27] and God is the Flesh and the God is the
[1:23:30] word rather and Jesus being the flesh is
[1:23:33] the Revelation how God was manifested in
[1:23:35] human flesh and revealed to us and why
[1:23:38] he became the Son of God he's part of
[1:23:39] God the body is part of the son isn't
[1:23:42] that right so let's go to the history it
[1:23:44] was written by 40 different writers 40
[1:23:46] men wrote the Bible over a space of 600
[1:23:49] years apart at different times
[1:23:50] predicting the most important events
[1:23:52] that ever happened in world history and
[1:23:54] no author but himself watch and there's
[1:23:56] not one error in the entire 66 books no
[1:24:00] author but God himself could be so
[1:24:01] accurate not one word contradicts the
[1:24:05] other these men wasn't even same age
[1:24:07] some most times and they have not
[1:24:09] contradicted each other that's the book
[1:24:11] we have called the Bible Hallelujah
[1:24:13] you're going to find out that is God in
[1:24:15] print form Hallelujah that book is God
[1:24:18] in print God in print devil hates that
[1:24:22] book and in that book two books he
[1:24:25] especially hate Genesis and Revelation
[1:24:27] cuz Genesis is his beginning and
[1:24:29] Revelation is his ending oh hallelujah
[1:24:32] praise the name of the Lord praise God
[1:24:35] so says now watch watch Luther was the
[1:24:38] feat Pentecostal the tongues lips now is
[1:24:41] the eyes prophetic look at that Luther
[1:24:45] was feet Pentecostal was known by what
[1:24:47] speaking in tongues and then after the
[1:24:49] tongues is what the eyes that's
[1:24:52] prophetic Malachi 4 now watch there is
[1:24:55] nothing else left for it to come but
[1:24:57] himself to step into that the next is
[1:25:00] the
[1:25:00] intelligence so after the eye is
[1:25:03] intelligence and we have no intelligence
[1:25:05] of our own we have no sight of our own
[1:25:08] he says then is the complete body of
[1:25:10] Christ being revealed in the form of a
[1:25:12] bride that's taken out of his side so
[1:25:15] when God was saying I'll restore he was
[1:25:17] restoring the bride body that Christ
[1:25:20] will come and connect with it as the
[1:25:21] head that is the invisible Union of the
[1:25:24] Bride amen connecting to Christ then
[1:25:28] you're going to see the visible Union of
[1:25:30] the Bride but you have to be an
[1:25:31] invisible Union where you connected to
[1:25:34] God by the Holy Ghost Hallelujah nobody
[1:25:37] in the world know where you at because
[1:25:40] you are in the body am you are not even
[1:25:42] in
[1:25:43] Trinidad amen you're in a capsule all by
[1:25:46] yourself you you're in a body the body
[1:25:48] of Christ so you walking but you're in a
[1:25:51] different world yeah that's right amen
[1:25:55] Hallelujah and that's how Jesus

[1:53:20] God the Bible is a perfect book if it
[1:53:24] wasn't they never talk about David
[1:53:25] adultery they never talk about Noah
[1:53:27] drinking they never talk about all the
[1:53:29] sins of the brothers in the Bible
[1:53:30] because the Bible is a perfect book it
[1:53:33] have truth in
[1:53:34] it it say all have sinned and come short
[1:53:38] of the glory not some but all there is
[1:53:41] none righteous no not one the Bible
[1:53:44] teaches that so we are all free this
[1:53:47] morning
[1:53:55] H thank you Jes I can't finish this
[1:53:59] today it's too much I'm going to come
[1:54:00] out hallelujah hallelujah
[1:54:06] hallelujah hallelujah let me drop a BM
[1:54:09] on
[1:54:12] you he designed the word all right that
[1:54:15] he could hide himself in the
[1:54:19] scripture to the smartest theologian he
[1:54:22] could hide himself set right there in
[1:54:24] the scripture and you can look all day
[1:54:26] long and never see it look for a
[1:54:29] lifetime and never see it he can hide
[1:54:31] himself
[1:54:33] there God in the
[1:54:35] word can hide himself showing the word
[1:54:39] that there's not a theologian in the
[1:54:40] school could find him yet he is sitting
[1:54:43] right there you say is that right
[1:54:45] brother BR how about the Pharisees and
[1:54:47] Sadducees how about every age he's done
[1:54:49] it he done it in every age Noah smart
[1:54:51] intellectual how he hid himself in his
[1:54:53] promised word in the days of Moses he he
[1:54:55] himself in Elijah he himself he said he
[1:54:58] came on his own his own receive him not
[1:55:00] so could sit in his word waiting for the
[1:55:02] believer to open
[1:55:04] it waiting for the believer to to to to
[1:55:08] reveal it to Hallelujah if you don't go
[1:55:10] how he can reveal himself to you when
[1:55:12] God waiting for you to part the Bible
[1:55:14] part the spoken word book begin to get
[1:55:16] into it and study and pray and the words
[1:55:18] to jump up wo then it brings stimulation
[1:55:21] of Revelation then that brings
[1:55:23] prevailing power upon your life so all
[1:55:25] this weak and you're struggling and you
[1:55:26] don't know how to make it all of a
[1:55:28] sudden you get prevailing power because
[1:55:30] God begin to reveal himself to you right
[1:55:33] out of the word because you're showing
[1:55:35] you have a passion to know the word of
[1:55:38] God you interested in the will of God
[1:55:40] you want to be about your father's
[1:55:42] business you don't just want to be
[1:55:43] hanging in church you want that
[1:55:48] breakthrough he hide himself from the
[1:55:50] smartest you see well this is Dr
[1:55:53] father's holy so and so I don't care who
[1:55:55] he is God hides himself from him and
[1:55:58] revealed to Baby s would learn the
[1:56:01] babies of God is predestinated seed so
[1:56:04] think think the Mighty God setting in
[1:56:07] his own word blinding the smart educated
[1:56:10] people of this present age and they
[1:56:12] think is a bunch of
[1:56:13] fanaticism and look at him there
[1:56:15] standing hiding to Pentecostal Baptist
[1:56:17] Methodist reveal himself publicly sh all
[1:56:19] kind of signs and so forth you said but
[1:56:21] Jones
[1:56:22] brother so and so he's a great man he
[1:56:24] will see it oh no he reveal it to
[1:56:27] whomsoever he will or this brother years
[1:56:30] in the message he old in the
[1:56:32] message but sometime the old one does
[1:56:35] get like that guy with Samuel dim
[1:56:37] sighted
[1:56:38] and not seeing right somebody is real
[1:56:41] blind they so long they get blind they
[1:56:44] say old they get numb they get kind of
[1:56:47] you know kind of Doty kind of old
[1:56:50] Hallelujah where they don't know what
[1:56:52] they're supposed to know but God reveal
[1:56:54] it to whom he will so you can't say God
[1:56:56] can Reve to that sister or that brother
[1:56:57] you can't say God can this one because
[1:56:59] this happened no no no to whomsoever he
[1:57:02] will oh musician come up please I think
[1:57:04] I know W up here God is known by
[1:57:07] Simplicity and a revelation of Jesus
[1:57:09] Christ to the most illiterate
[1:57:13] person not your theology it's a
[1:57:16] revelation of Jesus Christ Upon This
[1:57:18] Rock I build my church no other rocks
[1:57:21] accepted no other things accepted no
[1:57:23] other Roman Rock no other Protestant
[1:57:25] Rock no other school no other nothing
[1:57:27] but exactly the revelation of Jesus
[1:57:29] Christ through the new birth he is born
[1:57:32] in there Hallelujah and he injects his
[1:57:34] own life and your life is gone and the
[1:57:37] life of Christ is projecting itself
[1:57:39] through you Hallelujah showing the
[1:57:41] preeminence is to the people and the
[1:57:44] prophet said this the ministry comes to
[1:57:48] Perfection when Christ is manifested in
[1:57:51] natural
[1:57:55] we're not talking about a sermon we're
[1:57:57] not talking about what you could write
[1:57:58] down as a note we're not talking about
[1:58:00] what you say you never see it that way
[1:58:02] we're not talking about that we talking
[1:58:04] about Christ is reproduced in natural
[1:58:09] hallah that means the word amen has
[1:58:12] become flesh amen by lack of this
[1:58:15] revelation of what of Jesus Christ is
[1:58:17] why we have so much different divisions
[1:58:19] that's that's that's right not
[1:58:22] Revelations causing divisions but the
[1:58:25] lack of Revelation is why we have so
[1:58:28] many different divisions among us so
[1:58:30] much mockery so much division is because
[1:58:33] the people lack that Revelation they
[1:58:35] lack the Revelation the teachers
[1:58:37] hallelujah hallelujah who lack it
[1:58:39] teachers the teachers lack the
[1:58:41] Revelation because if the teachers had
[1:58:44] the Revelation they will point the
[1:58:45] people to Jesus Christ that's it that's
[1:58:47] it and not to themselves that's it or
[1:58:49] their groups that's it or their church
[1:58:51] that's it hallelujah hallelujah that's
[1:58:53] why I'm so blessed to preach in India
[1:58:55] the sovereignity of the local church oh
[1:58:57] praise God Timothy 3:16 all scripture is
[1:59:00] given by inspiration yes of God and is
[1:59:04] profitable for Doctrine reproof
[1:59:06] correction and instruction and
[1:59:08] righteousness that the man of God May
[1:59:10] stand perfect thoroughly furnished in
[1:59:12] all good works amen all scripture is
[1:59:16] given by
[1:59:17] inspiration God is a person amen are you
[1:59:21] ready yes God can
[1:59:23] speak God can talk God can write amen
[1:59:27] God wrote with his finger The Ten
[1:59:29] Commandments isn't that right God can
[1:59:32] talk he talked to Moses on the mount in
[1:59:34] the burning bush he talked to John in
[1:59:36] the form of a dove this is my beloved
[1:59:38] Son of whom please to dwell in he spoke
[1:59:40] to Jesus on my Transfiguration he spoke
[1:59:42] to Jesus before whole multitude so watch
[1:59:45] he said on the writing that not one Jud
[1:59:47] or tit shall ever pass away until it's
[1:59:49] fulfilled until it's manifested
[1:59:52] then it come to pass now a t tit means a
[1:59:55] small Mark in other words not one
[2:00:00] punctuation one expression shall ever
[2:00:03] fail in the word of God because it's
[2:00:08] God God manifested in the form of human
[2:00:12] flesh they only interpret the prophets
[2:00:16] as God would permit them to interpret
[2:00:19] amen and if you want first Peter 20 is
[2:00:22] of no private interpretation that's
[2:00:23] right so nobody not supposed to say I
[2:00:25] think it mean this the prophets alone
[2:00:29] have the qualification to interpret the
[2:00:31] word hallelu not a pastor that's right
[2:00:34] not a preacher the prophet alone has the
[2:00:38] authority to interpret the scripture the
[2:00:41] preachers have to come under the prophet
[2:00:43] and say what the prophet says because
[2:00:45] the prophet spoke for
[2:00:47] God Amen so the man of God the prophet
[2:00:51] cats the thoughts God speak the word of
[2:00:53] God for the entire age so if the age is
[2:00:56] a thousand years that word is for the
[2:00:58] Thousand Years the prophet may die
[2:01:01] whatever dim he die but the word Still
[2:01:03] Remains so the Bible said ration 10:7 in
[2:01:06] the days of the voice brother Bram is
[2:01:09] not here but the voice is still here we
[2:01:12] are still living in the days of the
[2:01:14] voice it's the voice of God in the last
[2:01:16] days but the bride will be the voice of
[2:01:19] God but the prophet and the bride and
[2:01:21] the spirit will will be saying the same
[2:01:23] thing and what they say has already been
[2:01:26] said in the word so there is no mistake
[2:01:28] about it there is no argument with it
[2:01:31] God word can't lie if God say he will
[2:01:33] heal you he will heal you if God said he
[2:01:36] will fill you he would fill you don't do
[2:01:39] like Sarah and slightly doubt believe
[2:01:41] God with all your heart oh
[2:01:44] hallelujah oh glory to God just a little
[2:01:47] more prophets did not always understand
[2:01:50] what they were writing or what they were
[2:01:51] saying or they were no wise have said it
[2:01:54] amen amen they couldn't they could
[2:01:56] understand it they were moved by the
[2:01:58] Holy Ghost moved by the Holy Ghost holy
[2:02:02] men moved by the Holy Ghost so when
[2:02:04] Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive if
[2:02:06] he was thinking it true he never write
[2:02:07] it but that's impossible but he had to
[2:02:10] write it Hallelujah because God said it
[2:02:13] in other words God Said So once God
[2:02:16] speak it it's got to come to pass there
[2:02:19] will be a Revival in Trinidad there will
[2:02:21] be the bride Revival once there's a
[2:02:23] bride in Trinidad there's a bride
[2:02:25] Revival in Trinidad and seven Thunders
[2:02:27] will be the bride Revival in Trinidad
[2:02:29] and Around The World God said so 7,000
[2:02:33] get fith God said so that's the pr
[2:02:35] Revival God said so you're going to have
[2:02:38] Dynamics and the mechanics God said so
[2:02:40] they will get back your joy God said so
[2:02:43] they will get your inheritance God said
[2:02:45] so hallelujah hallelujah but you got to
[2:02:49] know what God Said
[2:02:52] Hallelujah Glory so the prophet writer
[2:02:55] thank you Lord the prophet writer must
[2:02:58] be constant fellowship with the author
[2:03:00] amen he must live constantly in the
[2:03:02] presence of the auor to know what the
[2:03:04] book is going to be so these men were
[2:03:06] not intellectual men no these are men
[2:03:08] that was
[2:03:09] inspired oh Elijah he wasn't much to
[2:03:12] look at when he come down that dusty
[2:03:14] road but he had dust say at the Lord his
[2:03:17] ballhead gleaming at midday noon but
[2:03:20] when he stood there and not even du a
[2:03:22] rain will fall till I call for it my god
[2:03:25] when Prophet come people tremble because
[2:03:28] they know God was coming they know the
[2:03:30] word was coming they know thunder and
[2:03:32] lightning was coming because that was on
[2:03:34] the mountain and God said don't let the
[2:03:36] God speak let Moses speak Hallelujah
[2:03:39] isn't that right and God I'm going to
[2:03:40] lose prophets to bring the word to them
[2:03:42] amen oh Hallelujah and we have a 20th
[2:03:45] century Prophet my God how would you
[2:03:47] like to live back there with Elijah oh
[2:03:50] with Jeremiah or with Ezekiel and these
[2:03:52] men come out of nowhere stump down into
[2:03:55] a village and
[2:03:59] prophesy God could
[2:04:01] write there was writing on the wall
[2:04:04] Hallelujah time up thank you Jesus amen
[2:04:07] you found in the balance I found wanting
[2:04:09] Hallelujah man rejoicing King clanging
[2:04:11] and drinking and whatnot and he didn't
[2:04:13] know it was finished yeah that's right
[2:04:15] oh Hallelujah God could write God could
[2:04:18] speak amen that's right God is the word
[2:04:21] that's right so God know exactly what he
[2:04:23] said in his word he know exactly what
[2:04:25] going to be in the last days he know the
[2:04:26] spirit of men and lust of power he know
[2:04:28] the greed that going to be in the last
[2:04:30] days he know the authority listen we

[2:04:42] yeah God will not allow that that's
[2:04:44] right God took Jesus the example seat
[2:04:46] son the first thing God did is to send
[2:04:48] Wilderness not send him to get a a
[2:04:50] banner on Wave like the Pope
[2:04:53] Francis and everybody waving at Pope
[2:04:55] Francis
[2:04:56] no he went into the Wilderness to
[2:04:58] overcome the devil amen then he went
[2:05:00] into the scriptures to find what it's
[2:05:02] written because he was the it written
[2:05:04] son that what Mary had a son come is
[2:05:06] written and then he begin to his
[2:05:08] ministry looking to fulfill scripture I
[2:05:10] needs past through Samaria fulfill
[2:05:13] scripture his life was fulfilling
[2:05:15] scripture oh
[2:05:17] Hallelujah so that's why the prophet had
[2:05:19] his mindset constantly what God Said not
[2:05:22] what man thought what the age taught
[2:05:24] what the church taught what the kingdom
[2:05:25] taught what God taught he only expressed
[2:05:27] God thoughts to words because a word is
[2:05:29] a thought when is expressed oh blessed
[2:05:31] be the name of the Lord hallelujah
[2:05:34] praise God all other words I don't care
[2:05:37] well they are placed amen how who they
[2:05:39] come from what denomination they come
[2:05:41] from how smart the man is is to be
[2:05:44] absolutely
[2:05:47] ignored so we don't he the pre- Time
[2:05:48] Magazine Music Magazine and what in news
[2:05:51] paper we not here for that we here to
