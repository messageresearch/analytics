As Pastor Stephanas gets ready to come forward, let's do the song. They will all pass away, but there's something about that name. Oh, every hand lifted up. Let's sing to Jesus. You are Jesus. Sweet Jesus, you are Jesus. There is something about your name. You're my master savior. You are Jesus. Let all heaven and earth proclaim. Kings and kingdoms. They will all pass away. But there's something about that name. Oh kings and kingdoms. Oh kings and kingdoms. They will all pass away. But there's something about that name. There is something about that name. Let's sing it one more. Kings and kingdoms. Kings and kingdoms. They will all fade away, but there's something about that name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Isn't it something? Kings and kingdom will all fail away. But you serve a king. You are living in a kingdom that will never pass away. What our brother Wickley for speaking a spiritual revelation. When that kingdom becomes open to you personally and you personally get a revelation, you are a part of this kingdom that will never fail away. Only the spirit can reveal it to you. A revelation about the kingdom of God. I want to say that before we move on. You say, "But Stephanus, how can I get more revelation about this kingdom and about my calling and about what I am? How can I get more of that? Don't you want to have more about it? Or do you want to have revelation about things in the world? Do you want to understand the things in the world and the things in your friends life and things in there and things of the problems? I don't have to understand the problems. I know they are there. I don't have to analyze the problems. I know they are there. But I want to have a revelation. If you want to have spiritual revelation by the spirit of God, the Bible tells me, he says, "Knock and it will be open. &gt;&gt; Search and you will find." &gt;&gt; He said, "I will supply all your needs. &gt;&gt; Everything that you need." And I love what brother said yesterday. He says, "Revelation by the spirit gives you a vision. And when you have a vision, you shall not perish. But you know where your stand is, where you go and what to do." Peter had a revelation who the son of God is. But when the day of Pentecost was fully come, his revelation turned into a manifestation by the spirit. And Hebrews 13:8, THOU art the SON OF GOD. BUT NOW THE SON OF GOD IS IN ME &gt;&gt; turned into power, &gt;&gt; turned into life &gt;&gt; and turned into a light. &gt;&gt; And it shook the world. So I pray this morning as we invite our precious brother over it the second time. Father make us one. Make us one with your vision. Make me one with the vision that God has for my life. Make me one with your plan. Make me one with your spirit. And then when you're one with him, we can be one one another. Father, make us one. For what? The spirit CAN COME DOWN. 10 days they were together in the upper room. 10 days with a revelation, but then the spirit turned it into life and a manifestation of Hebrews 13:8. Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever in their personal life become a manifestation. &gt;&gt; You can never be too little &gt;&gt; for the spirit of God. It's rather you can to be big that God has to pull you down to be able to work with you. I'm looking for meetings. I don't know if it's today, but I'm looking for meetings and I have the face while Peter yet spake the word. The Holy Ghost comes down himself &gt;&gt; and he serves you. Preacher cannot preach anymore. Whenever is expect him, expect him to do the impossible because we serve a god as is in the impossible. He makes all things possible. God bless you. the make us one. Close your eyes and sing it with hands lifted up. Father, make us one. That the world may know that thou has sent your son in me. Father, father, make us one. And this atmosphere, I want that you greet each other as we sing it one more. Go to your brother. Go to your sister with a burning into your heart. Say, "Father, make us one. Make us more one, Father. as the world may know. Thou has sent your son. Father make us one. Oh may sing great how sweet the sound that has this is your personal testimony. He has saved me. A wretch like me. I once was lost by now. I found. Was blind. I now I see. Let's sing a verse before we move on. Oh, it was grace. Let my heart to fear and grace my fears really how graious that Praise appear. I first be through the day choice andess I have already Lord. Thank you Lord Jesus. I've come through it, Lord. Father, all this grace that brought me save this far and grace will lead. The Holy Spirit is the grace to you. He will lead you home. His grace be with you. Oh, then when we been there, we're going to look back one day. Yes, Lord. Bright shining as the sun. We've no less to sing God's praise than when we first beg. And that's why we all everybody of us can sing Amazing Grace. me. Sing great how sweet that sounds that have saved a rich And there's something in me that says, "Praise God." Oh, praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Let us have a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, we thank you for your presence this morning. We feel that we are in your divine will, your in divine order. And I pray that you would speak to us this morning. We need to hear from you. Take me out of the way and may be glorified in our midst. Come down, Father, and visit your children. This is such a critical hour, Father. Uh there's things going around the world that tells us the time is near. The time is ending. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; Lord. Revelation 10, the angel cried out, "Time shall be no more. Even time itself runs out." &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; God. We are running out of time. Time to make it right. Time to get it right. Time for the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Time for that breakthrough and deliverance. &gt;&gt; Time is ticking, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And just as natural time, whether we lazy, whether we are tired, whether weary, time keep moving on. &gt;&gt; We cannot stop time. We cannot harness time. We cannot prevent time. &gt;&gt; Time just keep ticking, Lord. &gt;&gt; And the clock of your promised word is ticking. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; That clock to fulfill your promised word. Father, come here today and may each one receive a revelation of their purpose, a revelation of their calling. give them vision, inspiration, and Lord, may you lead us this morning by your spirit and may the angel drop down here in our midst in Jesus name I ask it. Amen and amen. God bless you. If you have your Bibles, I'd like you to turn to two portion scripture. One, we want to read I'll read this one first in John 14. We want to read verse 15 to 21 and then we want to read Ezekiel 9 1-6 and then verse 11. So we want to turn to John chapter 14 reading from verse 15. And whatsoever. Okay. If you love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever. Even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him. But he know him, for he dwelleth with you, shall be in you. &gt;&gt; I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you. Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more, but he see me, because I live, he shall live also. And at that day he shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you. He that hath my commandments and keepeth them. He it is that loveth me. But he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I would love him and will manifest myself to him. Ezekiel chapter 9 reading from verse one. He cried also in my ear with a loud voice, saying, cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand. And behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lith towards the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand. And one man among them was clothed with linen with the writer's ink horn by his side. And they went in and stood besides the brazen altar. And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub whereupon he was to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen which were had the righteous incorn by his side. And the Lord said unto him, "Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof." And to the others, he said in my hearing, "Go ye after him through the city, and smite. Let not your eyes peer, neither have you pity. Slay utterly old and young, both maids and little children and women, but come not near any man upon whom is the mark, &gt;&gt; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house. And verse 11 says, "And behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the ink on by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou had commanded me." May God bless his word. You may be seated. Praise the Lord. This morning I have a title, the sealing angel. That's the title this morning. The sealing angel. I have an inspiration. Seal those who sigh and cry. &gt;&gt; I have a question. &gt;&gt; Have you been baptized &gt;&gt; into the body? Now, &gt;&gt; what we will share this morning has nothing to do with the element of man. As I said last night, we're not here to talk about Ukraine or Russia. We're not here to talk about the economy. We're not talking about finance and all the world troubles. We are here to focus &gt;&gt; on what God has promised for this hour &gt;&gt; and what we supposed to have and possess. Amen. &gt;&gt; And what God is expecting of us. &gt;&gt; You see, not only must we have expectations, &gt;&gt; but we have to understand God himself have expectations. &gt;&gt; He have expectations of us. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? &gt;&gt; In other words, he has expectation that we will do what he said we will do. &gt;&gt; Because he made promises that he cannot change. Now, that stone we spoke about last night, that stone that was cut out without the hands of man that Daniel saw, listen to these words. The coming of that stone up went the church into glory at the rapture because it ended the gentile dispensation. God ended it up the coming of that stone. So this stone, this dynamics, this holy ghost is what going to close off the gentile dispensation. The Gentiles have no certain time. It is called the times of the Gentiles or until the fullness of the Gentiles come in. What we don't know is when that last name will be called because one of these days this last name that is written in the book &gt;&gt; will be called. Isn't that right? Brought into redemption and then the book is closed. &gt;&gt; No more to be saved. &gt;&gt; The prophet said the bride will be here a while preaching to the eternal lost. &gt;&gt; Not the lost, the eternal lost. In other words, the witness of the gospel still have to go forth. &gt;&gt; Now Jesus himself said when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, &gt;&gt; the end is not yet. &gt;&gt; Earthquakes, the end is not yet. hurricanes and all kind of disasters. The end is not yet. He said this gospel must be preached &gt;&gt; and then the end shall come. &gt;&gt; So our signs is not earthquakes and hurricanes and all these different things around. We have to see this gospel &gt;&gt; and this gospel is not in word only. &gt;&gt; This gospel has to be in power &gt;&gt; and demonstration &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Do you see it now? So all the teachings &gt;&gt; and mysteries revealing &gt;&gt; and unfolding. He's not saying this gospel must be taught. &gt;&gt; No, this gospel must be preached. &gt;&gt; It have a teaching part. It have a preaching part. It have a teaching part which he call it the former rain to sew the seed. And it have the latter raining to manifest what the s the former rain has seeded down inside of you. This manifestation part is the gospel. &gt;&gt; The gospel is the word made manifest or the word confirmed or the word vindicated. That is the gospel. Hallelujah. That is what brother Branham had. That is what brother Brandham produced. He would preach. He say you know what I'm waiting on? I'm waiting on the angel. Then he say he is here. I take every spirit under my control &gt;&gt; for the glory of God. And he manifested Jesus Christ. He manifested the gospel. And Jesus said, "The same works I do shall you do also." That's a promise. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You be seated. And the same pay or the same salary that Peter received, we have to receive. It's the same penny. The same penny the early church had. We have to have. We don't want less than that. Isn't that right? So therefore, the stone comes out to close off the gentile dispensation because why? God have to go back to the Jews because there's 144,000 to be sealed. And in the book of Revelation chapter 7, the Bible talk about the four winds being stopped. And verse two of Revelation 7 says, "And I saw another angel." This is not a man. Now, not a man from America, a man from Europe, a man from Africa. No, I saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal &gt;&gt; of the living God. &gt;&gt; And he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and see, "Hurt not the earth. hurt not the sea or the trees till we have sealed the servants of God in their foreheads. &gt;&gt; So there is a sealing. &gt;&gt; Then he said he said and I heard the number of them that were sealed and the number was sealed 144,000 of the tribes. &gt;&gt; So we know by the scriptures 144,000 Jews will be sealed. But this just bring a confirmation or vindication before they are sealed. There's a bride &gt;&gt; to be sealed. &gt;&gt; And the sealing angel is already here. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Let's go, brother. Now, many times I don't really quote where I'm getting the message from, but this is from the seal of the Antichrist. He said this, "The first thing you know, the time will come when God will give a message and you will be sealed in or out of the kingdom." &gt;&gt; He is prophesying &gt;&gt; of a message coming, &gt;&gt; a message in the message, &gt;&gt; a sealing message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That people would either be sealed in or sealed out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Of the kingdom. He said, "Dear brother, if you haven't got the baptism of the Holy Ghost this morning, run into the kingdom of God as quick as you can. &gt;&gt; The sealing time is on." &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. So, William Brham prophesied there's going to be a sealing time. Do you know we have to be sealed from faith all the way up to charity? &gt;&gt; Those virtues are seven seals. Those virtues represent a finished work &gt;&gt; because when the work is completed, you put the seal on it. &gt;&gt; Grieve not the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The sealant time is on. The prophet in one of the seals he was saying we are now in the time of the revelations of these things being made known. &gt;&gt; So for the last 50 years we have been in the time of the revelation of the things being made known. But after that time is over, it transitions or shifts into the manifestation of the revelation &gt;&gt; of what was made known. &gt;&gt; So for 50 plus years, serpent seed, pope, mism, vials, woes, thunders, new name, all kind of revelations and mysteries being made known by teachings, by former reign, by people being positionally placed. And I ask a question. They like to say the quote, you know, the teacher positionally places the believers. But what are you placed for? &gt;&gt; You are not placed to be dead. &gt;&gt; You are not placed to be dull. &gt;&gt; Because when Jesus rose from the dead, he had a private ministry with his own disciples. Jesus didn't go on no mountain and feed no multitude. know he had a special private meeting with his disciples and he opened the word to them and he opened their understanding. In other words, he positionally placed them to receive something and he breathed upon them receive ye the Holy Ghost. So they were placed positionally to receive power. They were placed positionally to receive spirit. You are not placed positionally to warm a nice church bench. Oh, give the Lord some praises. You are placed to receive something. Give the Lord a shout. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God is NOT PLACING YOU JUST TO PLACE YOU. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; That's why when Samson asked to be placed, he said, "Lead me &gt;&gt; between the two pillars. I want to be in my position &gt;&gt; before the power strikes. because the power could you imagine Samson is nowhere and he's in the middle of the field and the power strike him and he just jumping &gt;&gt; nothing happening. &gt;&gt; So he said lead me &gt;&gt; between that two polars. &gt;&gt; So he could stand there and say Lord send your power and when the power struck him he could push &gt;&gt; like he never pushed before. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO YOU HAVE TO BE positionally placed &gt;&gt; to receive power. &gt;&gt; AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE POWER. &gt;&gt; YOU SHALL, NOT MAYBE, NOT PERHAPS, NOT I'M WONDERING. YOU SHALL RECEIVE POWER &gt;&gt; AFTER THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; NOT LUTHER, NOT WESLEY, NOT THE PENTECOSTAL. &gt;&gt; After the Holy Ghost itself, &gt;&gt; the person of Christ &gt;&gt; going to come upon you. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. He said the sealing time is on. Praise God. Jesus in Matthew 11, he was given a type. And Jesus said these words, "If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he asks a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? Or if he asks an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? Then he said this, "If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more &gt;&gt; shall your heavenly Father &gt;&gt; give the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; to them that ask him?" Oh, brother Oid, we have to ask for it. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; we have to know it is promised. &gt;&gt; You can't ask if you know it is promised. This Holy Ghost is promised and you have to ask for it &gt;&gt; to get it. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Do you believe that this morning? Brother Brandham in the 10 versions he said these words talking about the two spirits so close it will deceive the very elected. Listen to these words. These two spirits are marking their people for future judgment. So tonight right now in this service you are being marked. &gt;&gt; Marked for the Holy Ghost. Do do you understand? It's two spirits. &gt;&gt; Mark of the beast &gt;&gt; or the seed of God. &gt;&gt; He says these two spirits &gt;&gt; are marking their people for future judgment. &gt;&gt; What is the judgment of the bride? The reward. &gt;&gt; What is your judgment? The token. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost itself. Amen. &gt;&gt; But go in the midst of the city &gt;&gt; and put a mark. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; PUT A MARK. MARK THEM. &gt;&gt; THIS ONE HERE. &gt;&gt; This one here. &gt;&gt; And look INTO THE HEART. THIS ONE HERE. &gt;&gt; PUT A MARK. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; UPON THOSE THAT SIGH and cry. So God is marking his people even this morning. &gt;&gt; Woo. You may be seated. Do you know revelation marks you? &gt;&gt; But Abraham say it's not a mark on your forehead. It's not a physical mark. He says mark on your head and your hands. He said your head is your revelation and your hands is what you do about it. &gt;&gt; That is the mark. I'll say it again. The mark is the revelation and the hands is what you do about the revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What did Habac say? Write the vision. &gt;&gt; That's what brother Brandon is. Make it plain. That's what a five-fold ministry is supposed to do. &gt;&gt; That he that readth may run, not walk, &gt;&gt; not sit, &gt;&gt; but get into action. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, Brother Brham wrote the vision and a fifold ministry was supposed to come behind the prophet and echo and clarify and make known the vision. Because the vision OF TO GET TO THE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT THE MINISTER'S VISION. THIS IS THE VISION OF THE BRIDE. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE VISION OF THE BODY. &gt;&gt; OH, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Listen, the prophet said no minister could bring A REVIVAL. &gt;&gt; THE REVIVAL HAVE TO COME BY the people. &gt;&gt; IT MEANS SOMEWHERE THIS VISION HAVE TO BE TRANSFERRED. FROM THE PULPIT TO THE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; God love you so much. He promised to send a five-fold ministry &gt;&gt; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying. He concerned about you so much. He didn't send you for a fivefold, you know. Think about it. &gt;&gt; He sent a five-fold for you. &gt;&gt; His concern is you, your health, &gt;&gt; your strength, &gt;&gt; your power. Because God is a God of the audience. &gt;&gt; The reason we fell in the early church is because they took God from the people and put it on a man. &gt;&gt; AND GOD SAY, "I HATE THAT. YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; I want to get that to you. &gt;&gt; THE TOOK THE GOD THAT WAS IN THE MIDST of the people. He said, "I will be your people. I will be your God. You shall be my people. I would walk among them. I would wipe your tears. I will do this for you. This is the God we serve him." HE WAS A GOD OF THE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; They took the spirit. &gt;&gt; They took the God in their midst. And they end up with a pope. &gt;&gt; A message pope. A man poop &gt;&gt; our pastor our man man of the hour main man only manes message man &gt;&gt; God say I hate that &gt;&gt; because that is nicolating spirit &gt;&gt; that conquers the ley and if the ley is conquered the spirit can't move because a man is dominating your spirit dominating your mind dominating what you hear dominating but he says say what the tape say so if we say what the tape See, YOU ARE DOMINATED BY THE WORD OF GOD BECAUSE the spirit AND THE PROPHET AND THE BRIDE WILL SAY THE SAME THING. &gt;&gt; OH, glory to God. GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. WE DON'T HAVE OUR OWN MESSAGE. IT'S A ONE-MAN MESSAGE. OH, give the Lord some praises. It's a one-man message. That man is William, Marian, and Panam. GOD SENT, "BEHOLD, I send you Elijah." He sent Elijah with a message. And we are echoing that message this morning. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; 1 Peter 4 verse 17 says, "For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God. And if it begin at us, what shall the end be of they that obey not the gospel of God? And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear? Note six angels. These were judgment angels. God says destroy. Out of the six, one have the inhorn. God said, "Before you strike, put out that inkorn writer &gt;&gt; and let him put a mark &gt;&gt; upon those specific group, those that sigh &gt;&gt; and those that cry." outside of that group. Slay children, &gt;&gt; women, men, boys, girls, everyone without the mark. &gt;&gt; Where to begin? In my sanctuary. &gt;&gt; Do people still believe this message? &gt;&gt; People still believe this Bible. They believe the God of the word. &gt;&gt; This is not we are trying to say something to you. You know this is what the Bible said. Judgment will begin &gt;&gt; in the house of God. Anas and Safara very interesting. Brother Anas and sister Safh is living with him. My problem are not so much brother brother anas you know because he was a tricky guy. He was not living right. His wife knew him and she didn't have to go the way he went. They offered to sell their goods and they came to Peter and be said, "Is this all?" He could have said, "No, this is not all. We kept back some." &gt;&gt; That was open. That was honest. That was no lie. He said, "Yes." He said, "But you lie to me. &gt;&gt; You lie to the Holy Ghost." But Peter, you deny Christ. That has nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; PETER, YOU DENY CHRIST THREE TIMES. That has nothing to do with it. The past of Peter had nothing TO DO BECAUSE FIRE BOMBED OUT THAT DEMON OUT OF PETER. &gt;&gt; FIRE WAS IN PETER'S HEART. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Peter had the pillar of fire &gt;&gt; in his heart. &gt;&gt; You be seated. &gt;&gt; I know him. &gt;&gt; Do you really know him? Do you know what God did for him last night? &gt;&gt; You don't know him. You could look at somebody and last week they are one way and last night something happened to them. You don't know them. You don't know what the Lord has done for them. You don't know what THE LORD HAS DONE FOR ME. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LORD IS ABOUT TO DO FOR YOU THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY. &gt;&gt; GLORY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; That's why I said not because he is hidden, he is absent. &gt;&gt; Don't mistake God hiding from God being absent. Because those people thought that was just Brother Peter. We know him. We went to school with him. We eat bread with him. We fellowship with him. We went by his house and drink coffee. &gt;&gt; But God was veiled in that man. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the lie got called right out. &gt;&gt; We know the story. A casual attitude about God &gt;&gt; is in this message. &gt;&gt; A casual attitude about this me in this message. A casual attitude about God's wrath and God's judgment. And that's why I said last night, the same God that brought out Israel, the same God that killed them, he was angry with them. He tolerated all their issues, their complaints until they get to the promised land. And when they got to the promised land, he said, "Get your best men. Get these ministers. Let them go out. Let them cross over. Let them bring back evidence that I am true. You have a land full of milk and honey." Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want my people to say I am. I want my people to see that I am faithful. &gt;&gt; I am true. &gt;&gt; What I say I promise, I am keeping that promise. Go and bring back evidence. &gt;&gt; 10 ministers came back very quickly. They went, they saw the grapes, they saw the land, and they came back very quickly. And their testimony was, "We have seen giants." Now, if you were to interview these men, you saw giants. Did they see you? No. No. No. They didn't see us. And And we can't take it. Watch the effect of that. That negative testimony affected the whole congregation. &gt;&gt; It affected everybody. So negative could affect, negative could destroy, negative could bring judgment. GET AWAY FROM NEGATIVE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. A dark You may be seated. A dark gloomy spirit came over the congregation. The people didn't GO OVER. THE MINISTERS WERE SUPPOSED TO go over and BRING TESTIMONY. THE MINISTERS WERE SUPPOSED TO GIVE a witness of this Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; OF THIS HOLY GHOST LAND. &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY TO GOD. THE MINISTERS WAS TO GIVE A WITNESS THAT THIS LAND IS REAL. THIS LAND IS TRUE. THIS LAND is &gt;&gt; so the 10 men brought back. The Bible call it an evil report. &gt;&gt; See God doesn't interpret things how we interpreted him. &gt;&gt; God different. You see the man who buried the talent. One had two he produced two. The one that had four produce four. The one that bury it. You know what? God call him a wicked man. &gt;&gt; The same thing you give me Lord. Look at here. For 10 years God give you something and you add nothing to it. You say add to your faith virtue. And to virtue add knowledge. At least put it in the bank to get some interest. &gt;&gt; You take THE MONEY, YOU BURY IT. YOU DID NOTHING WITH IT. GOD GAVE YOU A GIFT. WHAT YOU DOING WITH IT? COME ON, PREACH BACK TO ME. COME ON. GOD GIVE YOU A TALENT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH IT? CALEB AND JOSHUA, they came back late because they were enjoying the grapes. So Caleb white gong was red, grape juice all over his mouth. He saw giants, that wasn't a problem. That this my land is my land. He saw tall giants, wasn't a problem. This land is my land. I'm eating big grapes this morning. This land, this land is my land. God, give me this land. Oh God, I thank you for giving me this land. This is my land. I'm going to take it. Come on. Come on. Preach back to me. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. I'M GOING TO TAKE IT. Be seated. These two brothers, Joshua and Caleb, the amazing thing is, Brother Brandham said, these were the only two guys who positionally knew what they were. &gt;&gt; They understood their position. &gt;&gt; And when they came back only to meet a negative atmosphere, oh God, you know when somebody depressed your head down. They say, "What happened? What is going on here?" Well, these ministers, you know, they high up in the message, they they long in the message and they say, "We can't take it." &gt;&gt; The irony of this whole thing is this. Caleb was the shortest man in the camp. &gt;&gt; Do you know about that? &gt;&gt; This shorty, we call him shorty. Shorty Bum say he took a box cuz he was too short. Nobody would hear him. &gt;&gt; And he stand up on the box &gt;&gt; AND SAY, "WE ARE WELLABLE. GOD is amazing. &gt;&gt; This short man &gt;&gt; on a box &gt;&gt; talking about we could take giants. &gt;&gt; He's not the big man in the in the congregation. He's a short guy &gt;&gt; SAYING WE ARE WELL ABLE &gt;&gt; TO TAKE IT. &gt;&gt; They wanted to stone them. &gt;&gt; The people was in such a negative atmosphere. They're ready to fight against truth. FIGHT AGAINST LIGHT. YOU HAVE LIGHT. &gt;&gt; DON'T LET NOBODY STOLE IT. &gt;&gt; DON'T LET NOBODY OUT IT. DON'T LET NOBODY COVER IT. &gt;&gt; WALK IN THAT LIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. You may be seated. Watch the judgment of God now. What's God's judgment? God said only Joshua and Caleb all those people going to die. And for 40 years funeral service after funeral service 40 years Caleb seeing friends and family and this one dying and he's there you know what God was doing waiting for the next generation &gt;&gt; the young people of their generation. Since they were leaving Egypt God know they would fail. So he was looking for every pregnancy. He was looking for the whole generation that being born. Every time God sees somebody pregnant, he say hallelujah because I'm going to keep my word. That generation going to fail, but the next generation will not. You can fail. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. YOU CANNOT FAIL. GOD CALL YOU TO SUCCEED. GOD CALL YOU TO SURVIVE. GOD CALL YOU TO OVERCOME. GOD CALL YOU TO POSSESS. GOD CALL YOU TO FIGHT. COME ON YOU CALEBS. COME ON YOU YOUNG PEOPLE. COME ON YOU JOSHUA. &gt;&gt; We are more than able. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. HALLELUJAH. THIS IS OUR LAND. WE HAVE A RIGHT TO IT. WE HAVE A RIGHT TO HOLY GHOST. WE HAVE A RIGHT TO SIGNS, WONDERS, MIRACLES. THAT IS OUR RIGHT. YOU may be seated. There's a lesson to learn from that experience with Joshua and Caleb and the giants. The giants didn't see them. They saw the giants. And that affected their fate. &gt;&gt; Is what your eyes choose to look on. Don't no let no one put limitations on you. &gt;&gt; Don't let anyone put limitations on where God want you to go. &gt;&gt; Because the prophet said he want to stop great man from entering into the places like this &gt;&gt; talking about the seven thunders. He don't want men to step into that platform. Don't speak on this. Don't talk about this. Don't preach this. No, we preach whatever God put on our hearts to preach. We say what God put on our hearts to say &gt;&gt; BECAUSE FOOLING YOU will not set you free. &gt;&gt; Tricking you would not set you free. The truth is what set you free. &gt;&gt; And you have to know the truth. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Let me just finish that little piece here. When they cross over into the land because Kale had three things to do. Just three. Not not 16, not seven. Just three. cross over, conquer, and divide the land. You cannot divide what you have not conquered. &gt;&gt; The land wasn't like a binoculars land. You're spying. That's 99 line across there. &gt;&gt; No. God don't want you to spy. Have a long lens and you're looking my mountain there. No. He tell Joshua every place you put your foot. Not Not every place you look. &gt;&gt; You have to put your foot on it. You have to put GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR FOOT ON IT. Not because you see it as IT'S YOURS. BECAUSE YOU PUT YOUR FOOT ON IT. PUT YET YOUR FOOT ON IT. &gt;&gt; THEN IT'S YOURS. You be seated. If you're sick, put your foot on healing. I'm the Lord that heal thee of thy diseases. Oh, glory to God. If your child sick, put your foot on the pray. They shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If you have financial trouble, you could put your foot on that something. They had to pay taxes. Jesus told THEM, "GO GET A FISH." AND THEY HAD MONEY. THEY HAD GOLD IN THAT FISH TO PAY THE TAXES. GOD COULD GIVE YOU MONEY TO PAY WHATEVER YOU NEED TO PAY. WELL, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. HE IS GOD THAT WILL SUPPLY all your needs. You may be seated. Caleb note when they came to the land and they conquered the land to divide the land, Caleb stepped forward. Note what Caleb did. He doesn't look around and say who is asking for anything. He wasn't coming on behalf of the tribe. He said Joshua you know what Moses said about me. And if the Lord be with me, &gt;&gt; he's old now. &gt;&gt; He is 80 years old now. Caleb said, "I am just as strong as WHEN I FIRST STARTED OUT, and if the Lord be with me, I SHALL BE ABLE &gt;&gt; TO DRIVE THEM OUT." &gt;&gt; I'm not even looking for assistance. HALLELUJAH. I'M COMING UP. &gt;&gt; OH, GIVE THE LORD SOME PRAISES. &gt;&gt; HE IS GOING UP A MOUNTAIN, AN OLD MAN. HALLELUJAH. AN ELDER MAN. HE SAID, "I'M COMING UP TO GET YOU, YOU SONS OF ANOCH." AND THE BIBLE SAID he expelled them. &gt;&gt; Maybe seated. &gt;&gt; You know what expel means? You know, some people have coffee with the devil. They drink. Say, "Satan, could you please not negotiate with the devil? You know, Satan, um, take this lollipop or take this chips or something like that. Could you could you leave?" &gt;&gt; No, NO, NO. JES, &gt;&gt; THROW THEM OUT. RUN THEM OUT. CAST THEM OUT. &gt;&gt; Caleb expelled. That's to kick out the boots to run them out. Those giants WERE RUNNING AND CALEB RUNNING BEHIND THEM. GET OUT OF HERE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. I COMMAND every foul spirit to LEAVE HERE. I COMMAND EVERY SICKNESS TO LEAVE HERE. I COMMAND EVERY DISEASE TO DRY UP. WE DRY UP TUMOR, CANCER, FEMALE CONDITION, WHATEVER YOU HAVE INSIDE OF HERE, WE CURSE IT IN THE NAME OF JESUS. OH, GLORY TO GOD. LEAVE HERE WHOLE. LEAVE HERE WELL. LEAVE HERE HEALED. GLORY, GLORY, GLORY, GLORY. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. They cross over. They conquer the land. And you know what Caleb said? Give me our mountain. No, he wasn't talking behalf of no hour. He said, "GIVE ME MY MOUNTAIN." GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. Listen friends, you have got to take this as an individual. You got to possess this as an individual. YOU GOT TO KNOW THAT IT'S PROMISED TO YOU. THIS HOLY GHOST LAND IS PROMISED TO YOU. THIS HOLY GHOST REVIVAL, IT'S PROMISED TO YOU. THE CEILING. &gt;&gt; Come see. You may be seated. This angel has the power and authority to speak and instruct the angels of destruction. In Revelation 7, stop the winds. Hold it. Hold it. Stop the wars. Hold it. Ask some to be sealed. &gt;&gt; And God stopping everything to make sure you are sealed. &gt;&gt; God will change governments. &gt;&gt; God will change world system to ensure that you are sealed. Brother from the preach. Listen to this. The book is sealed and you are sealed with the book. This book has more to do with you than you think. A lot of people don't understand that. That is why go John represented the bride and the voice told John go to the angel and say angel you think you think I'm worthy to have the book. It didn't say that. It says go to the angel and say give me &gt;&gt; the book. Note when the angel said who is worthy to take the book when the lamb stepped forward the lamb didn't go to the throne and said could you give me the book please? No, the Bible said the lamb went and took the book. That's an authority. So when Jesus died from the Pentecostal side or the Pentecostal version, they said people Jesus died to save my soul. What they don't understand, Jesus died to get the book. His death made the way for him to go and take back the book of redemption to call you and I. &gt;&gt; Because when Adam lost the book, the book went back in the hands of the original owner. God himself kept the book waiting for this last day. Here's Genesis on this side here. The book went up and here is the last day the book have to come back down. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. So God have to have a prophet on the earth and Revelation 10 said, "I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven with the book open and with this open book, seven thunders, throw their voices out." Now seven thunders is the only exclusive bride promise. The seven thunders gathers the bride together. The seven THUNDERS GIVE THE BRIDE FAITH. THE SEVEN THUNDERS IS THE BRIDE REVIVAL. THE SEVEN THUNDERS SHOW HOW TO PREPARE. OH, GLORY TO GOD. THE SEVEN THUNDERS IS FOR THE BRIDE. OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT. NOBODY ELSE. THAT'S BRIDE STUFF. HALLELUJAH. THAT'S BRIDE WORD. THAT IS PRIDE REVELATION. WE CAN'T DENY IT BECAUSE WE WILL DENY OURSELVES. THAT'S OUR NAME. THAT'S THE COVENANT. HALLELUJAH. WE ARE SEALED WITH THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. So listen, you may be seated. 1946, steal an angel came down. The angel of the Lord came down upon the earth to give the prophet three pulls by which to call a bride. first pull, second pull, the third pull was to get that bride. And he said the when the bride is taken up, he says the dragon will make war with the remnant of the woman's seed. That's the scriptures. And that remnant of the woman's seed, he said here in question and answers 1954, that remnant is the sanctified church without receiving the Holy Ghost, the ones you make war with. So in this message going to be nice message people sanctified people without the Holy Ghost. That is who the devil will go after because the devil will be so upset he missed the bride. &gt;&gt; He lost this bride. He'll be angry and he'll be going after church members. But the Brandham said this here are the ones that is sanctified and refuse to get the Holy Ghost. the church, the Roman church, and them will persecute them. But the bride is already raptured in heaven. &gt;&gt; So the 144,000 are Jews, God's servants. And when the Holy Ghost is preached to them, here we go. And they receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Just exactly like they did at the beginning. What is he speaking about? &gt;&gt; When I believe the message, I have the Holy Ghost. That's Baptist doctrine. &gt;&gt; That is not what they had in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Watch something. People said they use a quote the baptism of the Holy Ghost is not the real thing because you could have the baptism 24 hours and say be lost. The question that should be asked baptize where you could be baptized in your flesh. You could be baptized in your spirit or you could be baptized in your soul. So some people say that Peter had the seed in the soul or how brother say the seed in the soul is the real thing. So Peter had the seed in the soul. He could have said I don't need the Holy Ghost. I have the seed in the soul. I am brother Peter. I have revelation. &gt;&gt; But guess what? &gt;&gt; He was going to have no power. The whole understanding, the whole vision that Jesus presented to them in his postresurrection ministry was to get them to the upper room. He called it the promise of my father. Behold, I send the promise of my father upon you. Try in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high. &gt;&gt; Let's back up a little bit. These ministers or brothers or believers, they shared in Jesus ministry, but they did not have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; They did signs and wonders and cast out devils, but they did not have the Holy Ghost. To work with Jesus, he gave them an anointing to work with him. But when he came to this postresurrection ministry, he told them, "Stop preaching &gt;&gt; because the promise is not to be around you or over you. The promise is to be in you &gt;&gt; at that day. &gt;&gt; You shall know. I'm in the father. The father in you. I in you. You in me. &gt;&gt; So he was telling them if I don't go the comforter will not come. I have to go for the comforter to come. You may be seated. Note that when Jesus died, disciples were in tears. They were worried. They was depressed and sad. But when he opened the word to them and opened their understanding, no more tears, no more worry. Jesus is taken up and they're saying bye-bye. Bye-bye, Jesus. Because now what? The heart filled with joy. They said they return to Jerusalem not with a smile with great joy. That's different. Smile and joy is two different thing. Smile, you can smile, you get a new car, smile, you got to raise a pay, smile because you have a baby, whatever. Smile. That's smiling. But joy, that's different. &gt;&gt; That that is very contagious. &gt;&gt; Great joy. And they were ra praising God on Fridays. No, continually every service, hands up in the air. The pastor was a beggar to praise God. They were worshiping a revelation. They were worshiping under expectation. They were worshiping because they were expecting a manifestation. You may be seated. So revelation brings you under expectation. &gt;&gt; Did you get that? &gt;&gt; So that's why people sit in church quiet. &gt;&gt; They have no revelation. Revelation brings simulation. Do you know revelation is wine? This is water here, right? This guy get it drunk, you know. But you see wine. You ever see somebody drinking wine and the the car walk straight &gt;&gt; because they have wine. You know Jesus turned water into wine. The same word that you're hearing, God could turn it into revelation. &gt;&gt; And you know what? It will give you a stimulation. &gt;&gt; I've never seen that. Wow. Look at that. &gt;&gt; But Abraham says when it hit him, he run a tree. He run around the car. Why? Revelation is striking. Revelation is wine. Hallelujah. And Jesus said, you cannot take new wine and put it in old bottles. It wasn't the physical bottle like this. It was a wine skin. It was animal skin. And if it skin is too hard, the wine will pop and purse because the wine have energy in it. The wine does bubble. The wine does expand. So you have to have oil in your skin. Hallelujah. You have to have new skin. I trust this morning we have some new skins inside of here because this thing GOING TO BUBBLE. THIS THING GOING TO BURST. THIS THING GOING TO EXPLODE. This thing is the Holy Ghost. It's the Holy Ghost and fire and it's keeping me alive keeping me alive keeping me alive. It's the Holy Ghost and fire. Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; See this old man run up and down. &gt;&gt; I was 17 years old when God called me &gt;&gt; and the fire is still there. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The devil didn't start it and the devil can put it out. &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout. I AM JUST AS STRONG AS WHEN I FIRST STARTED OUT. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Praise God. Praise God. So this Holy Ghost, 140,000, they going to receive the Holy Ghost like in the beginning. Then he said these words, the Gentile church is finished. The church is sealed away. The rapture is come. The gospel has been preached. You don't hear no more crying, no more groaning, no more sign for the baptism of the Holy Spirit. These are the prophet's word. People talking all kind of mysteries, all kind of revelations, but they're not crying &gt;&gt; for the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And yet he says, God give the Holy Ghost to them that ask. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? Now, the Jews have got to receive the Holy Ghost and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ along. And the gentile church, watch. And as soon, here we go. As the Holy Ghost is presented to them, they receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost. The Gentile church is raptured. And those who refused and just walked under justification, the dragon, the Roman power, which this is something I never saw before, the Roman power spurts the water, which will unite with communism. That one blew my mind. and take the church into persecution. He is saying the Roman power will unite with communism and take the church into persecution. The gospel goes back to the Jews. 144,000 into the kingdom of God will be sealed by the sealing angel. &gt;&gt; Wait, brother O, there is something called the sealing angel. Yes, the angel from the east. The angel in Ezekiel 9. The ceiling angel is the same one with the inkorn writer. &gt;&gt; So as soon as that sealing angel here we go begins to seal that 144,000 the gentile church door is closed. &gt;&gt; So where are we at now? We are coming down to the fullness of the Gentiles or until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. We are coming down to Daniel's vision and prophecy of the stone cut out without hands where the kingdoms of man fell and then the kingdom of God established on the earth. We are coming down to the finishing listen of the seventh seal. That's where we coming down to the finishing of the seventh seal. Now you cannot go back into history. first seal, second seal, third seal and whatnot. The sixth seal is judgment. The fifth seal is Jews, souls under the altar. So we have to have a connecting seal that speaks of us. And our connecting seal is the seventh seal. That seal under they have the seven thunders all connected to the bride. The seven thunders not from a man. The seven thunders you find that written in revelation 10. Christ himself come down with those seven thunders. So seven telling on a man it's God himself. &gt;&gt; There's a purpose behind those voices. &gt;&gt; There's a purpose behind God speaking &gt;&gt; because when God speak something about to take place is not man speaking. It's &gt;&gt; God speaking. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham. What is the Holy Ghost? The Holy Ghost is your assurance. It's your protection. It's your witness. It's your seal. It's your sign that I am heaven bound. &gt;&gt; What the Holy Ghost is, you should want it. I couldn't go on without it. &gt;&gt; Listen, brother Brown, let us pray. He said, "Blessed heavenly father, tonight at the beginning of this revival, our time was swept up here tonight at these as 20 hands went up in the building and they needed, oh Lord, it's their souls. The spirit he's praying the oil is just about burnt out. There won't be much more. When that last drop is gone from the bucket or the container, there will be no more oil put in lamps. They realize that in the last days, there's not a hope on earth for outside of Christ. I pray tonight Lord that somehow in the somnness of this moment the solemnity that you will now send the Holy Spirit that made them raise their hands and save them from a life of sin. So the prophet described it as a bucket who the oil is going down and one of these days there'll be no more oil in the bucket or the container. Then in the date of Christ, he said these people who are formal in these formal churches is rising up against the move. And that move he's talking about, brother Stephanos, is a holy ghost move. He said they are taking their stand. Communism taking their stand. Now watch. And I'm seeing he said and that the church has taken a stand. I mean the Holy Ghost church. Now that's all I'm interested in friends. When I'm here out there, I'll pray for the sick. But in here I'm interested in one thing. I am not interested in bylaws and deacons and so forth or orders of the church. I am interested in the baptism of the Holy Ghost upon the church for this day that we are living in. &gt;&gt; So the prophet himself was interested in the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; upon the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen to this. The seal of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And all that was not sealed by the Holy Spirit took the mark of the beast. So don't get worried about am I going to take the mark of the beast or the mark of the beast. No. Understand this. If you get the seal of God, mark can't touch you. You're free from that. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? &gt;&gt; Get the Holy Ghost. Forget the mark of the beast. All that was not sealed by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Not some. All. &gt;&gt; The devil deceived all except &gt;&gt; those names written in the Lamb's book of life. He deceived bishops, popes, doctors, lawyers, prime ministers, everyone on the earth except. So if you are one of those whose names are on the book, you have to be praising God this morning, thanking God for this opportunity to hear what you hear and see what you see. Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch the mark of the beast. What it is is rejecting the Holy Spirit. Here we go. &gt;&gt; Jubilee year. When the year of Jubilee, so there a prophecy, a freedom time coming, a jubilee time coming. When the year of Jubilee or the blast comes, the people are receiving the Holy Spirit and you willfully turn it down. God is not under any more obligation to speak to you anymore. You are marked off to reject Christ to turn him down. He knocked on your door. You're in the danger line of being bored in the air. So if the seed of God is the Holy Ghost, then without the Holy Ghost is the mark of the beast. Note, he's not talking about who have books, who have tapes, who listen to message, who put the Bible under the head and sleep in it like a pillow, or who make a hat out of the Bible and make a Bible hat and say you're wearing the word, who put the Bible and quote all over your chest all about. I am not talking about that the devil coming for you. Mark of the beast coming for you. You got to get the Holy Ghost. We have got to get the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Watch. If the seal of God is the Holy Ghost, then without the Holy Ghost is the mark of the beast. And the Bible says that the two spirits be so close it would deceive the very elect of possible. Now we know, listen to this now. How we how we going? All the ones that were in captivity didn't have to pay a price. So if you were enslaved in captivity and that jubilee comes, you could go free. You don't have to do anything. You don't have to pay a price. You don't No. God's provided grace was the jubilee that with the gospel. So no. So you understand what Jesus did with the woman at the well. Do you understand what Jesus did with the woman in adultery? He freed them. You know, as I told him in France, when he spoke to one of well, she had five and the one she live in wasn't hers. He didn't come to address that issue. You know, he didn't come and say, "How much man you living with? how much boyfriend you had and no he didn't come to talk about that you know he came to call her name in the book &gt;&gt; that was his issue &gt;&gt; she don't know who she is &gt;&gt; because when you don't know who you are you live anyway &gt;&gt; you do anything you want but if you get to know who you are you're raised to a higher level &gt;&gt; so he came to free her from her past free her from her present free her to see so when she ran and said COME SEE A MAN oh gosh another She said, "No, not that kind of one. There's a perfect one. There's a different one." Hallelujah. This one spoke life to me. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a praise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When Jesus come, things are different. &gt;&gt; WHEN JESUS COMES, LIVES ARE CHANGED. &gt;&gt; So once, so watch. If the person didn't want to go free, he says that would be compared to the mark of the beast. They take them and put a thing in the air and that was to remain bound forever. He said now when you hear the jubilee sound and if you didn't want to go free then he had to be sealed. And today when men and women hear this marvelous gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and the baptism of the Holy Ghost, you have to make a choice. So if people want to be content that their pastor is the best thing after sliced bread or their pastor is the best thing in the world and they believe that they in the right church and the only church and they can't leave that church. They have to leave the church. Some of them you know they have to leave because the churches have built walls. They have built cemeteries and walls. Dead people inside of there. Just wall them up inside of there. Some of them can't hear the Jubilee trumpet. But there are people the spirit of God will go out right here in Germany. right here from this tabernacle around the world. The spirit of God will go out and call from the east and the west and the north and the south. The people will hear the voice of the spirit. He said the bride will follow the spirit wherever the spirit is. Wherever the spirit leads, the bride will follow the spirit. Not a man, but the spirit of God. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, I feel the spirit here right now. When there was chaos all over the earth, you know what God did? God didn't argue with chaos. God didn't say chaos, how long you chaos? How long you in trouble? How long is darkness? He just said, "Let there be light." He addressed the chaos with the word. Oh, give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah. God spoke to chaos and and there was light. Oh, h no argument. We're not going to argue with darkness. We're going to say, "Let there be light." Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You may be seated, brother. From fellowship by redemption. When the ceiling angel crossed through the country, he was commanded to put a mark upon those who sign and cry for their permission down the city. I say this with reverence now and with respect. Don't get mad at me, angry rather. But if the sealing angel crossed this nation today, where would he find men so deeply consecrated to God for the sins of this crumbling nation? till they cry day and night. Where would he mark the church that fast and pray? Lord Jesus, where would he find that person? The message will have become content. They have become satisfied. And worse than that, they have become entitled. Now, when you get entitled or get an entitled spirit, you feel you don't have to work for it. You don't have to earn anything because you are dear. You are entitled to the rapture. You entitled to the coming of the Lord. You are entitled. That is wrong. &gt;&gt; You know what you're entitled to do? &gt;&gt; You're entitled to fight. &gt;&gt; Did you get that? &gt;&gt; That is what you're entitled to fight. Because God sets it up that way that you have to fight. Listen for what you know is your own. &gt;&gt; Right. Write with me now. Come ride with me now. You have to fight for what you know is your own. So the revelation of the word come to reveal what is your own. &gt;&gt; And the prophet say I claim my healing that's mine. I claim joy that's mine. I don't claim depression. That's mine. &gt;&gt; I don't claim frustration. That's not mine. I claim deliverance. That's mine. &gt;&gt; I claim a Holy Ghost baptism. That's mine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What you doing? You're making claims. You are fighting for your portion. You are fighting for your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You may be seated. The woman whose daughter was vexed with the devil and Jesus say not fit to take the ter bread and cast it a dog. She knew this and Pharisees can't help her. They can't do no nothing. They can't heal. They can't cast out devils. So she stood there and she be to think what he's saying. Oh, he called me a dog. Then she said, "What does the dog see?" She see the dog. She see the dog eating the crumbs. So she said, "Ah," she said, "Lord, even the dog eat crumbs." Jesus said, "Go that woman. Your daughter is here. I I I can't. This is too much for me. Go go go. This is too much for me." The centurion, he did the same thing. Lord, come. Uh, don't come under my roof. Let's speak the word and my servant shall be healed. You know what Jesus said? I never even see faith like that in all of Israel. That was a gentile. &gt;&gt; That was like you and I. He said, "I have never seen faith like that." Just speak the word because I recognize you are under authority. Hallelujah. I RECOGNIZE YOU are a man under authority. You are not all the man. You are under authority of your father. And you have authority when you're under authority. Oh, give the Lord A SHOUT. THAT'S WHY brother Brandham this is good. That is why when brother banham say I don't know if he come I don't know if he's here and he say he is here. And once he say that he recognized that he's under authority now. He said I take every spirit not brother he know the person who authorized him is there. &gt;&gt; So he said I take every spirit under my control cuz that's what God want him to do. Oh glory to God. &gt;&gt; Brother can tell the angel do it do it. He has to do it. He has to say I take every spirit under my control. And then the angel will be there to energize him TO ANOINT HIM TO INSPIRE HIM TO SPEAK. may be seated. Brother Brandham, look at here. That inkorn marker, that inkorn writer, that marker, Brother Brandham, see was none other than the Holy Spirit. So get something, the sealing angel, the ink on writer and the Holy Spirit is the same person. The sealing angel. He says, "Notice, if he come to Jessville tonight to the Brinham tabernacle or to any other tabernacle in the city or in the church, who would he put a mark upon?" &gt;&gt; Who is so sincere and so honest before God that the weapon cry day and night? &gt;&gt; So the inkan writer is the ceiling angel is the Holy Spirit. People reject the Holy Spirit in this message because they don't want the Holy Ghost to lead them. They want to lead themselves. They have their own thoughts about ideas and so on. God let badam get lost in in the forest wherever it was to show bad brotherham I am your guide. &gt;&gt; But Brana was a natural guide guiding people. He knew how to survive. But God make sure he came to an experience where he understood he was lost. He made a circle and come right back. The Indian call it the death walk. You make a circle and find yourself back in the same position he was in. You're not going anywhere. And he had was to confess, "Lord, I am no guide." So he couldn't rely on the human element of his ability to lead himself out of what he was in. God had us to show him what to do and God led him. He saw the tower and he got out and so like that. But what I want to show you is this. Even in his natural gift and ability as a guide, God stripped that &gt;&gt; that he wouldn't have the confidence. Hey, I'm a guide. I know my dad can north, south, look up the sky and all that time you have a we call a compass right now. All of that failed because God want to introduce himself as the guide. And then brother Brandon preached that on a message called a guide and he said how the Holy Ghost ought to guide us to a wonderful glorious baptism. &gt;&gt; That is where it's supposed to take the church. &gt;&gt; 50 years of mysteries. How much how much more we could talk about mysteries. &gt;&gt; Sometime preachers preach and it's so mysterious you scratch your head. You don't even know what you have to find out afterwards what the man say. &gt;&gt; That is not how it's supposed to be. Yes. &gt;&gt; Every time the vision supposed to be clearer and clearer. &gt;&gt; God loves clarity. &gt;&gt; Because God was so mysterious, he had a problem. How do I reveal myself when I am so mysterious? &gt;&gt; So that is how he revealed himself in Christ. &gt;&gt; Because he wanted to get an idea of who I am, what I'm about. &gt;&gt; Understand this. When they came out of Egypt, God told Moses, "Bring them to this mountain. Those people don't know me. &gt;&gt; I know you. I call you. I spoke to you. I sent you to deliver them, but they don't know me. Bring them that I may reveal myself to them." &gt;&gt; So when Moses brought them out by the mountain and Moses went up to get the commandments, the people start to dance and party and drink and carry on. &gt;&gt; That's a human element. These are the same people that deliver me. Oh Jesus, I'll deliver me. He deliver you and then what? &gt;&gt; He call you out and then what? That's the problem in the message. People come out but they haven't gone in. &gt;&gt; Redemption is in two parts. &gt;&gt; Coming out of and going in. You can't just be happy just to come out. You come out a Baptist. You come out a Catholic. You come out a Lutheran. You come out of this church and that church or that group. But you have to go into the promised land. &gt;&gt; You can't build any house on the journey. &gt;&gt; The journey is the journey. you could build on your land. &gt;&gt; God fed them with mana AND BREAD. GOD FED THEM WITH THIS ON THE JOURNEY. &gt;&gt; And right now we are journeying to a promised land. Our land is adoption. Our land is perfection. Our land is the Holy Ghost itself. &gt;&gt; THAT'S OUR LAND. &gt;&gt; WE ARE STILL JOURNEYING &gt;&gt; AND WE CAN'T GET TIRED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Let's continue. Remember, each day ends a generation. Each day ends a 40-year period from some for somebody. Each day, here we go. So many is sealed away into the kingdom. &gt;&gt; One day that last day would arise. &gt;&gt; But is this just a quote or this is real? Every day close a generation. Every day somebody being sealed. Right now somewhere past the world, God is sealing somebody. It could be you this morning. &gt;&gt; God could seal you. He said, "Don't you rest there night until that quickening power has brought you from the things of the world into the kingdom of God." And you are truly brought into the kingdom of God and quickened by the spirit of God. How happy with tears of joy we should be on our knees day and night thanking God for what he has done. Now, the reason, this is a bomb here, the reason the Virgin Mary had to go up at the day of Pentecost and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost just like the rest of them did because she was born here as a mortal &gt;&gt; and had to be born again before she could go to heaven. &gt;&gt; So, Mary couldn't rely on I'm the mother of Christ. Are you mother Mary? No. Upper room. Yes. &gt;&gt; Do you see how vain it is in the message now that people feel that entitled? People feel that because they believe the books or they press play and they have the tapes and they had no all of that it entitled them. That is not right. &gt;&gt; It's amazing. Luke 17:30 was the son of man been revealed. Luke 18 right after that Jesus asked the question when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth? &gt;&gt; Yes. Look, look, Luke 17, son of man revealed himself. Luke, Luke 18, when the son of man cometh, will he find faith in the earth or will they out that fate? We have to say he will in my heart, &gt;&gt; he will. You're going to find here in Germany, he will. He'll find it in you. You are the one to answer that question. When the son of man cometh, if you're going to find faith on the earth, &gt;&gt; oh, praise God. So Mary had us to go up in the upper room because she's a mortal. She had to be born again &gt;&gt; by the spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's some question and answers. Mary Magdalene didn't realize the spirit that was on her. Now, when you kind of get that spirit on you, men, you get out here start lusting for women. You say it's human nature. Not like that. It's a spirit. The Bible said is a spirit. So, the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you from lust and passion called sanctification. Now the word sanctification means to be cleansed and set aside for service. Now that lost spirit leaves you under sanctification. Let a little lady goes to church. She sings in the choir. She has to mow her grass. She a little a short song. Let her get sanctified one time and put her on. Here we go. Listen prophet going deep. You are not sealed by sanctification. &gt;&gt; So you see what he did there? He show you could lose lust under sanctification. You could stop wearing shorts under the sanctification, but you're not sealed under sanctification. &gt;&gt; And yet, you're more Christian-like. You're behaving yourself. You come to church, you're worshiping, &gt;&gt; but you are not sealed by sanctification. You are sealed by the baptism of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; So, just as you are baptized in water, the preacher take you and dip you down and come back up. God will take you and dip you in the spirit and take you back up. Yes, &gt;&gt; you are baptized &gt;&gt; by the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; A ceiling is the completing of the work. &gt;&gt; It has been the Holy Spirit all along. A portion of the Holy Spirit. All right. So, Luther had a portion of it. Wesley had a portion of it. We have a greater measure. But the true bride, here we go, will be made up of thousands time thousands of people. It will be the elect of every age. Every time a message went forth and the people believed it and accepted it or the light it was, then they were sealed away until the day of redemption. So this sealing we talking about is not new. It's not now. In every age, the people were sealed away. &gt;&gt; Seal angel came and sealed them under justification, seal them under sanctification. It was a measure of the Holy Ghost. And now we have to seal you with the token itself. We have to have the literal life of Jesus Christ. I've been going to that. Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So when Jesus died, brother Abraham says his soul was his spirit ascended into hell. God put his body in the right hand of glory and sent back, here we go, the Holy Ghost as a covenant. Don't fall short of that, brother. Without the baptism of the Holy Spirit, you are lost. But if the spirit of God is in there, the spirit of God will unhinge those doors. His soul, Jesus soul returned back in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that comes into every believer to sanctify, clean up the mind, clean up the heart and leave a portion of the Holy Ghost in there. So when the Holy Ghost sweeps through you, clean up your mind, clean up your heart and leave, leave, he call it a little light in you like a button. &gt;&gt; And as you die out to yourself, that button expands. As you die out of jealousy and envy, the more you die out, the more that little light in you expand until it expands through your whole body. You are filled with the Holy Ghost. Give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. So you had seven golden candlesticks, a rainbow, a covenant that God made through Abraham, through Isaac, through Christ, through the church by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. The robe of seven colors that was upon Joseph that was upon Jesus is upon the church today. &gt;&gt; He call it the robe of seven colors. It was upon Joseph. He was perfection. It was upon Jesus. He was the perfect one. Is upon the church today. &gt;&gt; That robe is the common cover you're being. &gt;&gt; That's your wedding garment. That's the Holy Ghost all around you. Oh, give the Lord some praises. Hallelujah. All right. We on the home stretch brotherham but Judas Judas preached with them but when it come to Pentecost to receive the baptis of the Holy Ghost he refused it and betrayed Christ that was the antichrist and the spirit today will come right down and teach justification by faith and everything move right on up to the bapts. So Judas show his colors by not receiving the Holy Ghost. He didn't go in the upper room. He made it all into Christ ministry and he avoided and bypassed the upper room. That's how he end up betraying Jesus. You said, "Brother Brandham, I don't go to dances. I don't go to shows." That's the moral thing. Unless there have been a supernatural, not because you shouted, not because you spoke in tongues, but something supernatural has to happen in here, then you are sealed away in God. You are anchored. Okay, we on the home stretch here. He said, "I'm saying tonight, my Christian friend, no matter what church you belong to, as in the message in groups, wherever you are, if you are not into the kingdom of God by the baptism of the Holy Spirit, bringing you into the body of Christ, you press in now, for you don't know what hour he is coming." Acts 5:32 says, "And we are his witnesses of these things, and so also is the Holy Ghost, whom God had given to them that obey him. &gt;&gt; So right now through this message, words will be coming to you. God thoughts will be coming to you, things to make right, things to correct, things to follow through, things to adjust. And as you respond to the Holy Spirit, who in your heart as you obey him, he will take you to the Holy Ghost. He will take you into your baptism. He gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey him. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, the Bible says, watch, what is the kingdom of God? How do we get into the kingdom? &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God is the word of God made back into power. &gt;&gt; He say here we are the end time coming from the east and west, north and south. What are we doing? Getting ready for the rapture. Getting ready holding ourselves steady for a few minutes till every fiber is filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's how you're going to rapture. Not with a book and tape. You ain't walking to the rapture. Where's my Bible? I'm going to rapture. No, &gt;&gt; you're going to rapture by the Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Remember Peter and them had no Bible. You know, &gt;&gt; they were the living word. &gt;&gt; So, I'll say this to you. It have written word, &gt;&gt; have spoken word, &gt;&gt; it have living word. &gt;&gt; The most powerful one is the living word. &gt;&gt; The word itself became flesh. &gt;&gt; So Jesus was the living word. &gt;&gt; Some people could speak word &gt;&gt; but I ain't know the life behind that. But the living word that's different all together. Are you with me? Oh my. I'm going to skip down. Oh, we're almost there. Music, please. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Dynamics, Easter message, dynamics and mechanics together. The mechanics without dynamics no good. Needles dynamics without the mechanics. It only work if it come together. He says, so one will sit still and the other one will go up. No matter how good the mechanics is, until the dynamics come, nothing going to move. Then he said this this morning. In the church of the living God this morning lays the power to heal all sicknesses. &gt;&gt; In the church of the living God lays the power to overcome all temptation. In the possession of the church of the living God this morning lays the power to take change sin and throw it away and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Oh, praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. And then he began to pray a prayer in this uh this is where I'm finishing in the faith of the saints. I believe it is. He said, "How many ministers are in here that believe that the baptism of the Holy Spirit is for the believers today?" Raise your hands. Ministers of the gospel, would you walk right up here around here with these people? He's talking to them. Do you believe who are standing here seeking the baptism of the Holy Spirit? I'm very grateful to you. I'm grateful for that little ministry the Lord has given me here to be effective. He's standing here right here now. Begin to play something softly. He's standing here right now and he will give each one of you the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Now remember, it's a gift. It isn't a faith. It's a gift. You say, "Well, I believe I've got it." That won't work. It isn't that. It's a gift. Unmmerited gift. God just gives it to you. Not because you believe it, but because God gives it to you and you come asking him for it. Blessed are they that hung on after righteousness, for they shall be filled. God will give you the Holy Spirit. I want you to open your heart and say, "Father, dear, I'm a believer. I am your child." Let's all stand. I now want the Holy Spirit to come into my heart. I lay all the world on the altar. I lay everything on the altar. And then but I don't want to talk about the Holy Spirit is here. He say here's the angel of God standing right here. It isn't five feet above their head right now. The very angel you see on the picture standing right here above them right now. You feel the spirit of God pointing to your heart. Then when you raise your hands and thank him for it, say, "Lord, thank you, Lord Jesus. I'm so grateful that you give me the baptism of the Holy Spirit." You'll feel the power of God search through your body. You'll be a different person from time on. Hallelujah. That's what we supposed to do. Lay our hands on them who are seeking the baptism of the Holy Spirit. He said, "Father, I pray knowing this very hour millions of prayers around the world is coming into your ears. You hear every one of them. That's not way from you to fail, but hear every one of them. Lord, the dear poor children coming up. I pray for mercy. Oh God, send your blessings. May the Holy Ghost that's hanging right over this people now may he fall upon them just now. Then he said these words. Now Satan, you lost your authority. You lost your power and the Holy Ghost is here to take over and to bless these people and to fill them with God's goodness. Let's pray. Father, we thank you this morning. We thank you for your presence, Lord. May you pour out your spirit upon your people, seal them into the kingdom of God. May you fill them with the Holy Ghost. Fill them with your love. Fill them with your power. I pray in Jesus name I ask it. Amen and amen. May the Lord bless you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Oh, just worship him. Just close your eyes. Lord, please come and take control. I feel the poor. Oh, just raise your hands. I feel the poor. I hear the call. Oh, and I his spirit's move in me to give my all. He speaks to me and I agree. Oh Lord, please come and take control. I feel the poor. I feel the poor. He's calling this this afternoon. I hear the call and I know his spirit. him here to give my all. He speaks to me and I agree. Oh Lord, please come and take control. I feel the poor and holy spirit won't you come and fill me while I'm waiting for you. Oh, I am broken. I am thirsty. I am longing for you all over the building. Let me hear you sing it now. singing, "Holy Spirit, want you to come and fill me, Lord, why I'm waiting for you and I am broken. I am thirsty. Oh, I longing for you. Oh, let me hear you sing it now. Oh, and holy spirit, won't you come and fill me while I'm longing for you, oh, and I'm broken. broen. I am thirsty. I am longing for Oh Lord, just give him praise. Just worship him. Lord, we thank you the ceiling angel. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Do you appreciate the message today? Wonderful. And as brother Stephanos gets ready to come forward, let's do one more song. Oh, holy, holy, holy is the Lord. He is holy. God is holy, holy. Oh, he is. God is holy. Holy, holy, holy is the Lord. Let's worship with the angels together. The angels worship him. They're crying out, "Holy, holy, holy is the king. But for us, holy, holy is the lamb of God, the slave for our redemption to bring back the same life, the same Holy Spirit that was in Christ into the believer." Oh Lord, we say holy. We sing holy, holy are you Lord Jesus. Oh sing holy, holy, holy is my Lord. Holy, holy, holy is the Lord my soul say holy, holy, holy is the Lord. Holy, holy, holy is the Lord. Just praise him. Just worship him. Just continue to give him praise. Worthy is the lamb. Worthy is the lamb. Worthy is the lamb to open the book. To open my life, to open reveal my name. Worthy is the lamb. Thank you Jesus. Oh hallelujah. Let's sing the song. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. Let the people sing. Oh, thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. I want to thank you Jesus. Thank you for the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Thank you for this life. &gt;&gt; Thank you for giving yourself Jesus. I WANT TO SAY thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jes.
