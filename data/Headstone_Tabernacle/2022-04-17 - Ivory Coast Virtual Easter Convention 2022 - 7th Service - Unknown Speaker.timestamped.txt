[52:56] amen and amen
[52:58] while you're standing let's just read
[53:00] the scriptures and i'll do the greetings
[53:03] after
[53:04] reading two portions of scripture
[53:06] scene john 15
[53:09] and reading colossians 1.
[53:12] saint john 15. verse 1
[53:15] and reading colossians 1 verse 27.
[53:20] see in john 15 1 i am
[53:23] the true vine
[53:26] and my father is the husbandman
[53:29] the fact that jesus would use the
[53:31] reference of true vine speaks to the
[53:34] fact that they are false vines
[53:37] so i am singular the true vine
[53:40] and my father is singular the husbandman
[53:43] every branch in me that bear it not
[53:46] fruit he take it away
[53:48] so they are branches
[53:50] that do not be a fruit
[53:52] and they are consequences of not bearing
[53:54] fruit and every branch that beared fruit
[53:57] he pigeot it that it may bring forth
[54:01] more fruit
[54:02] now you are clean through the word which
[54:04] i have spoken unto you
[54:06] abide in me and i in you
[54:09] as the branch cannot bear fruit of
[54:11] itself except it abide in the vine
[54:14] no more can ye accept he abide in me
[54:19] i am the vine ye are the branches
[54:22] he that abideth in me and i in him the
[54:25] same bringing forth much fruit
[54:27] for without me you can do nothing
[54:30] if a man abide not in me he is cast
[54:33] forth as a branch and is withered and
[54:35] men gather them and cast them into the
[54:37] fire and they are burned
[54:39] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[54:42] you you shall ask what you will and it
[54:44] shall be done unto you that there's your
[54:46] promise hearing is my father glorify
[54:49] that you bear much fruit so shall he be
[54:51] my disciples and one verse in colossians
[54:54] 1 27
[54:56] a familiar
[54:58] uh scripture

[55:03] riches
[55:04] of the glory of this mystery among the
[55:07] gentiles which is christ in you the hope
[55:10] of glory may the lord have a blessing to
[55:13] the reading of his word you may be

[56:58] amen so what a time we're living in and
[57:01] with a paul and i'm sure through the
[57:02] various services you know you would hear
[57:05] over and over what the theme of the
[57:07] meetings are is the life of christ in
[57:10] you
[57:11] is the vindication of the rapture
[57:14] with an inspiration the revelation by
[57:17] the life of christ
[57:19] what a powerful inspiration the
[57:21] life of christ in you
[57:24] is the vindication of the rapture
[57:27] the life of christ in you is the
[57:30] vindication of the rapture the word
[57:32] vindication means it's proof that
[57:35] someone or something is right
[57:38] so the life of christ in you is proof of
[57:41] the rapture
[57:42] the life of christ in you is proof that
[57:45] he is raised from the dead
[57:47] because he's raised from the dead there
[57:49] could be a life that's operating through
[57:51] you
[57:52] can the church say man the life of
[57:54] christ in you is proof of the
[57:56] resurrection
[57:57] the life of christ in you is proof that
[58:00] there's a seed in your soul
[58:03] the life of christ in you is proof that
[58:05] you are predestinated you don't need
[58:08] anybody else to be the proof the life of
[58:10] christ the very life of christ itself is
[58:12] the proof that you are in the bride the
[58:15] life of christ in you is the assurance
[58:18] that you have passed from death unto
[58:20] eternal life the life of christ in you
[58:23] is the token the life of christ in you
[58:26] is the absolute the life of christ in
[58:29] you is the vindication of the rapture
[58:32] the life of christ in you is the hope of
[58:35] glory it is this great mystery that has
[58:38] been hid but now has been opened to us
[58:40] as gentiles that is this great mystery
[58:43] that the devil wished he understood but
[58:45] it bypassed him how almighty god who
[58:49] existed alone could tabernacle himself
[58:52] into badger skins how almighty god who
[58:55] existed alone who when there was war in
[58:58] heaven and the devil was kicked out that
[59:01] god found a way
[59:02] found a way to place himself
[59:05] into sons and daughters that here in
[59:07] 2022 in this easter convention the devil
[59:11] is trembling i'm not talking to your
[59:13] flesh i'm not talking to how you feel
[59:16] i'm talking to who you are because
[59:18] there's a life in you there's a seed in
[59:21] you there's a promise in you there's a
[59:24] purpose in you there's a calling in you
[59:26] there's a anointing upon you that the
[59:29] devil could be mad but he cannot stop it
[59:32] satan could be angry but he cannot stop
[59:35] it because he could not he cannot stop
[59:37] his life
[59:39] oh he couldn't stop it when jesus was
[59:41] here he couldn't stop it when it was in
[59:43] peter he couldn't stop it when it wasn't
[59:45] paul he couldn't stop it when it wasn't
[59:47] brother pranam how dare the devil thinks
[59:49] he could stop it now
[59:51] it's the same holy ghost it's the same
[59:54] power it's the same presence it's the
[59:57] same angel it's the same god
[1:00:00] oh unfolding this tree full mystery
[1:00:05] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:00:08] hallelujah hallelujah the life of christ
[1:00:12] oh that's what this all is about friends
[1:00:14] it's not about churches it's not about
[1:00:16] conventions it's not about being in the
[1:00:18] message it's not about the message it's
[1:00:21] about god's great purpose to tabernacle
[1:00:24] himself behind individuals
[1:00:27] unlikely individuals of individuals who
[1:00:30] don't stand a chance of individuals who
[1:00:33] messed up individuals who made mistakes
[1:00:36] up individuals who backslid individuals
[1:00:39] who were hanging in there individuals
[1:00:41] who have doubt individuals who didn't
[1:00:44] know where they stood in the video was
[1:00:46] born into all kind of situations of
[1:00:49] individuals who gave up on themselves in
[1:00:52] those very individuals there's a seed in
[1:00:54] there that is a little form of jesus and
[1:00:58] when the spirit connects to that word
[1:00:59] seed
[1:01:02] it's finished
[1:01:03] hallelujah hallelujah your natural
[1:01:06] father was just a trustee your natural
[1:01:09] mother was just a trustee oh you are not
[1:01:11] the son or daughter of child or ella
[1:01:14] branham you are not the son and daughter
[1:01:17] of whoever your father your mother is
[1:01:19] you are son of the king
[1:01:21] you are a daughter of the king
[1:01:23] they are angels dispatched around you
[1:01:25] today they are angels around you they
[1:01:27] are behind you they are the side of you
[1:01:29] they are the front of you wherever you
[1:01:31] walk because they have got to guard the
[1:01:33] presence they have got to guard the life
[1:01:36] if the devil only knew what happened
[1:01:38] when he touched a life he would have
[1:01:40] left jesus to live up but because he
[1:01:43] messed with the life there's a great
[1:01:44] consequence of messing with the life he
[1:01:47] messed with jesus and the life must
[1:01:50] multiply don't mess with me it's going
[1:01:52] to multiply don't mess with my house
[1:01:55] it's going to multiply it's going to
[1:01:57] grab my children it's going to grab my
[1:01:59] son it's going to grab my daughter no
[1:02:02] weapon no demon no principality your
[1:02:05] past your mystics could separate us from
[1:02:09] this life
[1:02:14] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:02:17] hallelujah
[1:02:18] so i have a title
[1:02:20] for a few minutes i'm not going to be
[1:02:22] too long with you but my title is the
[1:02:24] manifestation
[1:02:26] of the life of christ in you
[1:02:28] because when the life of christ is in
[1:02:30] you there's got to be a manifestation
[1:02:33] something has got to take place the life
[1:02:35] of christ cannot be in you and you're
[1:02:37] dead the life of christ cannot be in you
[1:02:39] and you're defeated the life of christ
[1:02:41] cannot be in you when you're giving up
[1:02:43] maybe you're struggling right now
[1:02:46] but there's a fullness of the life that
[1:02:48] when he steps in
[1:02:50] when he steps in it's impossible for you
[1:02:53] to fail it's impossible for you to
[1:02:56] backslide it's impossible for you to go
[1:02:58] back to the world
[1:03:06] my subject i am the vine
[1:03:08] you are the branches
[1:03:10] and as an inspiration there is my spirit
[1:03:13] flowing freely we know these statements
[1:03:16] but it's at a still in my heart there is
[1:03:19] my spirit flowing freely so the spirit
[1:03:22] could flow and it doesn't have to be
[1:03:24] flowing freely freely means uninhibited
[1:03:28] it means no restrictions
[1:03:30] it means nothing blocking the flow so
[1:03:33] when you come into the presence you feel
[1:03:34] is spirit but when you go back home
[1:03:36] things happen and and the flow gets
[1:03:38] interrupted we are here in this season
[1:03:41] to reach a position where there is no
[1:03:43] hindrance
[1:03:44] nothing stopping no limitation open up
[1:03:48] the channel oh come on now somebody help
[1:03:50] me this morning help me this evening
[1:03:54] oh hallelujah
[1:03:56] oh everybody feeling fine
[1:03:58] ride with me this evening ride with me
[1:04:01] this morning whatever time zone you're
[1:04:03] in i'm not going to be along with you
[1:04:05] but let's give the devil a knockout
[1:04:07] punch
[1:04:08] but abraham said there's more power in
[1:04:10] your little finger than what the devil
[1:04:12] has
[1:04:13] so come on now you sons and daughters of
[1:04:15] the living god and that prophecy that's
[1:04:17] over you is going to come into
[1:04:19] manifestation that sickness that you're
[1:04:22] dealing with cannot stay sick when the
[1:04:25] life of christ comes fully in you it's
[1:04:28] impossible for light and darkness to
[1:04:30] live in the same house it's impossible
[1:04:34] for fate and doubt to live in the same
[1:04:36] house by the time this convention is
[1:04:38] over you're gonna walk into your home
[1:04:41] and see a different home because the
[1:04:43] life of christ in you does things around
[1:04:46] you come on now somebody help me a
[1:04:48] little bit
[1:04:53] [Applause]
[1:05:00] [Music]
[1:05:01] the manifestation of the life of christ
[1:05:04] in you
[1:05:06] that's what the whole creation is
[1:05:08] running for
[1:05:09] that's what the message is all about
[1:05:11] i'm tired of church yes i said it i'm
[1:05:14] tired of church god didn't come for us
[1:05:16] to have church he came to connect with
[1:05:18] us in a different kind of way connect
[1:05:20] with us in a way that he couldn't do
[1:05:22] before but now we in this age when the
[1:05:24] fullness of the word is restored the
[1:05:27] word is the conduct of the spirit so now
[1:05:29] for the first time there's a pipe
[1:05:31] there's a way for the spirit to move
[1:05:35] because the word has been restored the
[1:05:37] word that was scattered throughout all
[1:05:38] the ages
[1:05:40] oh he could only move a certain kind
[1:05:41] away with the measure of the word that
[1:05:43] they had but now in our day we have the
[1:05:46] fullness of the word
[1:05:49] that's what the prophet came for not for
[1:05:51] us to focus on the prophet it was to
[1:05:53] focus on connecting
[1:05:55] the branch to the vine
[1:05:57] it was focused on that connection
[1:06:00] jesus told him i am the vine and ye are
[1:06:03] the branches but for a long time there
[1:06:06] couldn't be a perfect connection but
[1:06:08] after william branham came and the word
[1:06:11] was restored there was no perfect
[1:06:13] connection
[1:06:15] that the spirit could move freely
[1:06:19] oh hallelujah
[1:06:21] you may be seated
[1:06:23] i would like to take a few minutes to
[1:06:24] just remind us that we are not of this
[1:06:27] world
[1:06:28] it is easy with the distractions that
[1:06:31] exist and the pace of life to try to get
[1:06:35] comfortable that by design the devil's
[1:06:38] job is to make things easy for you to
[1:06:40] stay here
[1:06:44] convenience easy fast that those are the
[1:06:48] key words that drives the devil's
[1:06:50] motivation
[1:06:51] make you comfortable instant coffee fast
[1:06:55] this whatever it is to get you caught up
[1:06:57] in a world that is getting faster and
[1:06:59] faster
[1:07:00] you have to do more to keep up you have
[1:07:02] to work harder you have to study more
[1:07:04] you need to do two jobs you need to do a
[1:07:07] side hustle you need to study more all
[1:07:09] of these things to keep you focused on
[1:07:12] these natural things but let me remind
[1:07:14] us that we don't belong here let us
[1:07:17] remind ourselves that we are not from
[1:07:19] this world
[1:07:20] [Music]
[1:07:21] [Applause]
[1:07:22] oh hallelujah i would like to remind us
[1:07:25] despite the technological advancements
[1:07:28] despite the architectural conquest
[1:07:30] despite 3g 4g 5g or whatever g comes
[1:07:35] despite their nfts and cryptocurrencies
[1:07:38] this world is still guaranteed for
[1:07:40] judgment it's all going to be judged
[1:07:43] judgment is hanging over the world
[1:07:45] judgment is hanging over you judgment is
[1:07:48] hanging over churches
[1:07:53] i want to remind us that judgment is
[1:07:56] already set
[1:07:57] i want to remind us that only the bride
[1:08:00] the elect lady will be in the rapture it
[1:08:03] has nothing to do with the church that
[1:08:06] you belong to it doesn't even have to do
[1:08:07] with your belief it doesn't even have to
[1:08:10] do about your doctrine it's very simple
[1:08:12] if you are pride you go into the rapture
[1:08:15] can the church say amen in every church
[1:08:18] has three kinds of believers and this
[1:08:21] church has three kinds of believers in
[1:08:23] every country has three kinds of
[1:08:25] believers i don't care who your pastor
[1:08:27] is it's still three kinds of believers
[1:08:29] but there will be a bride who will have
[1:08:32] the life of christ it will not be their
[1:08:34] life it will not be their interpretation
[1:08:37] it will not be their understanding but
[1:08:39] it will be jesus christ himself
[1:08:42] tabernacled in 16 elements and that
[1:08:45] jesus will lead them to love that jesus
[1:08:48] will lead them to forgive that jesus
[1:08:51] will lead them to love their enemies
[1:08:53] in that house because you are
[1:08:55] tabernacles of the spirit in that house
[1:08:58] don't tell me you have the life of
[1:09:00] christ and you can't live with one
[1:09:02] another that's not the life of christ
[1:09:04] because the holy spirit cannot misbehave
[1:09:08] in one person oh come on now somebody
[1:09:10] preached back to me the life of christ
[1:09:13] creates a super church creates a super
[1:09:16] race up as we near the headstone it's
[1:09:18] the life of christ i'm not talking about
[1:09:20] the life of the pastor i'm not talking
[1:09:23] about the life of the prophet it's
[1:09:24] christ we're talking about
[1:09:26] that same jesus
[1:09:30] somebody help me
[1:09:31] [Applause]
[1:09:33] saul thought he knew him
[1:09:35] saul who became paul under gamaliel he
[1:09:39] read about him he studied him he was
[1:09:42] fighting for his understanding of him he
[1:09:45] stood there and stoned stephen because
[1:09:47] he thought he had an understanding of
[1:09:50] who god was but when this man called
[1:09:53] saul was on his road to do more of what
[1:09:56] he thought was right he met jesus oh
[1:09:59] hallelujah somebody say man and when he
[1:10:03] met jesus he went through a
[1:10:05] transformation his eyes started to see
[1:10:08] different his ears start to hear
[1:10:10] different his foot start to move
[1:10:12] different his mouth start to speak
[1:10:14] different
[1:10:16] it was no longer an understanding of who
[1:10:20] jesus was he met the life

[1:15:52] on earth walking on two feet
[1:15:55] stood in from the grave of lazarus
[1:15:58] and said lazarus
[1:15:59] comfort and the prophet told us if he
[1:16:02] didn't call the name lazarus everyone
[1:16:05] who was in the grave was going to wake
[1:16:07] up because that life cannot exist with
[1:16:10] death
[1:16:13] once that life comes in contact with
[1:16:14] something that's dead it's got to come
[1:16:16] to life

[1:16:23] don't care if you came into this service
[1:16:25] dead you're not going to leave dead
[1:16:27] something got a spark whether you lift
[1:16:30] one hand you lift two hands you stand up
[1:16:32] on your feet you jump around you spin
[1:16:34] around you roll on the floor something's
[1:16:36] got to happen to you
[1:16:38] because you can't stay the same
[1:16:40] [Applause]
[1:16:46] in the beginning the message beginning
[1:16:48] and ending of the gentile dispensation
[1:16:51] but ibrahim said what is it the mystery
[1:16:53] of god
[1:16:55] god in you the hope of glory shining
[1:16:58] forth
[1:16:59] the baptism of the holy ghost the
[1:17:01] baptism of the holy spirit that's what
[1:17:03] it is
[1:17:04] that's all god has been trying to do you
[1:17:06] know to step into your flesh to step
[1:17:10] into your hands when you recognize your
[1:17:13] hands moving and it's not you the
[1:17:15] brother who you couldn't shake his hand
[1:17:16] all of a sudden you find your hand
[1:17:18] connect with his and you can't explain
[1:17:21] it because you know you had issues and
[1:17:23] if it was up to you you know you
[1:17:24] wouldn't shake his hand but
[1:17:26] there's a different driver in the
[1:17:27] driver's seat and you're taking no
[1:17:30] taught you're just being led by the
[1:17:32] spirit because
[1:17:34] you have died to yourself
[1:17:38] but ibrahim said when these things take
[1:17:41] place time shall be no more
[1:17:43] they that know their god in the last
[1:17:44] days many shall run to and through
[1:17:46] knowledge and increase but they that
[1:17:48] know their god shall do exploits in the
[1:17:50] last days they shall do exploits oh
[1:17:53] exploits of fate is breaking around the
[1:17:56] world tonight over and over
[1:17:58] oh hallelujah over this weekend over
[1:18:00] this convention all over the nations
[1:18:03] great campaigns the blind are seeing the
[1:18:05] death by hearing the lames are walking
[1:18:07] people of all walks of life are coming
[1:18:09] in and receiving the holy spirit

[1:18:16] world
[1:18:17] listen friends nobody has a monopoly on
[1:18:19] this thing you know

[1:18:25] churches we don't know about in homes we

[1:18:29] hallelujah we can't claim that the angel
[1:18:32] is right here and it's not somewhere
[1:18:33] else nobody could do that because god is
[1:18:35] sovereign
[1:18:36] and his sovereignty allows him to come
[1:18:39] into your home and come into your
[1:18:40] situation and come into this meeting and

[1:18:58] god made man in his own image where was
[1:19:00] you he said to job when job thought he
[1:19:03] had some wisdom
[1:19:05] said where was you when i lay the
[1:19:06] foundation of the world before i laid it
[1:19:09] when the sons of god sang together and
[1:19:11] the morning stars shouted for joy the
[1:19:13] morningstar shouted with joy them
[1:19:15] shining ones shouted for joy when they
[1:19:18] seen that someday through a tabernacle
[1:19:21] here on earth and the king melchizedek
[1:19:23] would come in the righteousness of god
[1:19:26] and give his life to redeem us back
[1:19:28] again and outshine the styles forever
[1:19:30] and ever
[1:19:32] in the message oneness here we are in
[1:19:34] the end time coming from the east and
[1:19:37] west north and south what are we doing
[1:19:39] getting ready for that rapture
[1:19:45] getting ready for listen to the
[1:19:47] prophet's words holding ourselves steady
[1:19:50] for a few minutes till every fiber is
[1:19:53] filled with the holy ghost
[1:19:55] oh that's my desire is that your desire
[1:19:57] friends i want every fiber
[1:20:00] every fiber every molecule every cell
[1:20:04] every atom to be filled with the holy
[1:20:06] ghost or from the message i look uh the
[1:20:10] message the world is again falling apart
[1:20:12] but ibraham said i look for a rapture
[1:20:15] for just a handful of people that's
[1:20:17] right just a handful of people they'll
[1:20:19] never be missed in this world when they
[1:20:21] go you'll never know it's gone
[1:20:25] so it clearly can't be the old church
[1:20:27] you know
[1:20:29] he said a handful of people
[1:20:31] they'll never be missed that's a scary
[1:20:33] thought you know
[1:20:34] everybody clear that's a scary thought a
[1:20:37] handful of people they'll never be
[1:20:38] missing the world when they go you'll
[1:20:40] never know it's gone that's right it
[1:20:41] comes like a thief in the night
[1:20:45] hallelujah aren't you happy to know
[1:20:47] there's a way of escape
[1:20:49] aren't you happy to know there's a way
[1:20:51] out of this world
[1:20:52] hallelujah is a temporary escape you
[1:20:55] know because we got to come back to this
[1:20:57] earth because this is our territory this
[1:20:59] is our jurisdiction this is our domain
[1:21:02] this is our kingdom it's on this earth
[1:21:05] here so we shall reign on the earth but
[1:21:08] because judgment is set god has to take
[1:21:10] us and put us temporarily somewhere to
[1:21:12] deal with this to prepare this place so
[1:21:14] when we come back there's no more sin

[1:21:27] for lawyers there's no more need for
[1:21:28] judges there's no need for engineers

[1:21:36] need to move you could just translate
[1:21:37] yourself you don't need no cars oh come

[1:28:15] what you see happening in your life is
[1:28:18] directly connected to your connected too
[1:28:23] so when you say i'm not feeling the
[1:28:24] anointing what are you connected to
[1:28:26] because if you connect to him you'll
[1:28:28] feel the anointing
[1:28:31] i don't understand what all the fussing
[1:28:32] about what are you connected to
[1:28:35] because if you're connected to him
[1:28:36] you'll understand him better by and by
[1:28:39] and you'll understand that you can't
[1:28:40] tell god what to do he'll move in in his
[1:28:42] own time in his own way in his own
[1:28:45] season and he will move with you
[1:28:47] different from everybody else because he
[1:28:48] deals with us as individuals so don't
[1:28:51] look at nobody else look at your
[1:28:52] connection to god that's what's most
[1:28:55] important
[1:28:57] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:29:03] all of this for the life of christ to be
[1:29:06] manifested
[1:29:08] in us
[1:29:09] through us
[1:29:10] oh that's been god's desire
[1:29:13] hallelujah we've preached it before when
[1:29:15] god existed alone he had nobody to
[1:29:17] connect with he had nobody to flow
[1:29:19] through he was existing by himself but
[1:29:21] he wanted to express his attributes as a
[1:29:23] father he wanted to express his
[1:29:24] attribute as a healer he wasn't able to
[1:29:26] pour himself into somebody but there was
[1:29:28] nobody to do that with so god started to
[1:29:30] create and he created his stars and the
[1:29:32] sun and the moon and everything else and
[1:29:34] there was still nobody to connect with
[1:29:36] because he wanted a relationship and
[1:29:37] when god put man on the earth for the
[1:29:39] first time he could have a real
[1:29:40] connection he would come in the cool of
[1:29:43] the evening and have fellowship with his
[1:29:45] connection and he would be able to talk
[1:29:47] about what they did and what adam did in
[1:29:49] the morning and in the evening and all
[1:29:51] this stuff and when the devil saw that
[1:29:53] he was mad so he came to try to break
[1:29:55] the connection and since that time to
[1:29:57] this time it has always been about god
[1:30:00] reconnecting with his children it has
[1:30:02] always been about god having the
[1:30:03] preeminence revealing himself taking us
[1:30:06] back to eden where he had perfect
[1:30:09] fellowship perfect connection a perfect
[1:30:12] relationship with his children
[1:30:14] hallelujah and in our world man has
[1:30:17] tried to find ways to connect manners
[1:30:20] tried to use the mobile devices and fact
[1:30:22] machine and all kinds of stuff to
[1:30:24] replace that issue of connection
[1:30:27] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:30:29] lord but that is no substitute to a real
[1:30:32] connection with god hallelujah people
[1:30:35] are comfortable to be connected by
[1:30:37] technology to be connected by all kinds
[1:30:39] of stuff but there's nothing like a real
[1:30:41] connection with god oh blessed be the
[1:30:44] name of the lord god is longing for a
[1:30:46] connection he is longing to re-establish
[1:30:49] fellowship he is longing to find
[1:30:51] somebody that he could move through
[1:30:54] and he could see his spirit have the
[1:30:56] preeminence take the control hallelujah
[1:30:59] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:31:04] do you understand what you're missing
[1:31:06] and when man connection was broken in
[1:31:08] the days of the tower of babel they try
[1:31:11] to use human effort
[1:31:14] to reconnect to god they say let's build
[1:31:16] a tower
[1:31:17] to connect to god because they knew
[1:31:19] there was a connection they were missing
[1:31:21] there's something in you that is always
[1:31:23] going to have a desire
[1:31:24] that food cannot fill that reading
[1:31:27] cannot fill that knowledge cannot fill
[1:31:29] that information cannot film there's
[1:31:31] always a desire because god put a test
[1:31:34] in your soul for him so people tried to
[1:31:36] fill it with all kinds of stuff and here
[1:31:38] they were trying to build a way to get
[1:31:40] back to god and god looked at their
[1:31:43] hearts and he saw them motivate the
[1:31:45] objective he said if they agree and they
[1:31:48] keep doing this they would actually
[1:31:50] achieve it and he broke up that unity
[1:31:52] because that's not how he wanted to
[1:31:54] connect with them oh come on now
[1:31:56] somebody preached back to me but through
[1:31:58] the ages he found a way to connect with
[1:32:00] noah he found a way to connect with
[1:32:02] moses he found a way to connect with
[1:32:04] joshua he found a way to connect with
[1:32:06] daniel he found a way to connect with
[1:32:08] elijah and each one of these men had a
[1:32:10] connection with god he found a way to
[1:32:12] connect with joel we connect with ezra
[1:32:15] to connect with micah to connect with
[1:32:17] gideon to connect with deborah to
[1:32:19] connect throughout all the ages oh he
[1:32:21] connected with isaiah and said isaiah i
[1:32:24] want you to prophesy that a virgin will
[1:32:26] conceive and will be a child oh come on
[1:32:29] now somebody preached back to me but the
[1:32:31] connection brother joelle that he had
[1:32:33] with these men was not the connection
[1:32:36] that he had in his mind because he will
[1:32:38] come and visit them and it will be a
[1:32:40] temporary thing but he was longing to
[1:32:43] find a way to make it a permanent thing
[1:32:46] oh come on somebody preach back to me
[1:32:51] all these years
[1:32:53] he was attempting to connect
[1:32:57] like a wi-fi connection it connects and
[1:32:59] then sometime it breaks
[1:33:02] hallelujah they would have to go and
[1:33:03] make a or a sacrifice
[1:33:07] hallelujah and they would go and put
[1:33:09] this lamb there and they would they
[1:33:10] would kill islam and and the life that
[1:33:13] was in the lamb that was taking his
[1:33:14] place would try to be transferred
[1:33:17] but it couldn't the connection could
[1:33:19] last
[1:33:22] because that life was not compatible
[1:33:23] with the person who was offering the
[1:33:25] sacrifice
[1:33:27] these were all attempts have a
[1:33:28] connection
[1:33:29] because a sinful life had to be replaced
[1:33:31] with another life
[1:33:36] oh but then one day
[1:33:38] oh one day
[1:33:40] hallelujah one day
[1:33:42] there was a star in the sky
[1:33:44] oh and wise men say this is different
[1:33:47] this looks like something is happening
[1:33:49] we must follow this star we know
[1:33:51] something is happening we have seen this
[1:33:54] star and they begin to walk towards it
[1:33:56] because they knew something was
[1:33:57] happening they had a revelation of
[1:33:59] something was happening and this little
[1:34:01] baby that was born in a manger was god's
[1:34:04] way of creating a connection that will
[1:34:07] one day become permanent it will not be
[1:34:09] a temporary connection oh hallelujah
[1:34:12] somebody preached back to me is not what
[1:34:14] esa is we know what it is god desiring
[1:34:18] to have the preeminence but now he has
[1:34:21] put things in place to have the
[1:34:23] preeminence so jesus is growing up a
[1:34:26] little carpenter boy
[1:34:28] they don't recognize who he is they
[1:34:30] think he's just anybody no wonder they
[1:34:32] asked a question when he got older is
[1:34:34] not this joseph's son because he's
[1:34:36] moving kind of different he talking kind
[1:34:38] of different he walking kind of
[1:34:40] different what was it a mystery he stood
[1:34:43] there in the temple read the scripture
[1:34:45] and said that the spirit of the lord is
[1:34:47] upon me for he hath anointed me and he
[1:34:50] reads it and they think it's just
[1:34:52] brother jesus he was just in church and
[1:34:54] brother jesus you heard where did jesus
[1:34:56] read it and when he was finished and
[1:34:58] said this day this scripture is
[1:35:01] fulfilled something was happening
[1:35:03] it was one step closer to a permanent
[1:35:06] connection
[1:35:07] we moved one step closer to a permanent
[1:35:10] connection
[1:35:12] and jesus his whole ministry his whole
[1:35:15] purpose was not to feed the five
[1:35:17] thousand his whole purpose was not to
[1:35:20] open the blind eyes that was on the way
[1:35:22] to this great purpose being accomplished
[1:35:25] of restoring his preeminence of
[1:35:27] revealing his great mystery of christ in
[1:35:30] you the hope of glory or somebody
[1:35:32] preached back to me
[1:35:33] [Applause]
[1:35:35] [Music]
[1:35:39] oh hallelujah and when jesus died
[1:35:44] and rose again
[1:35:46] it was now in place
[1:35:48] that the life
[1:35:49] the spirit life that could not have been
[1:35:51] transferred from animals to man now this
[1:35:55] spirit life
[1:35:56] was now transferable peter and they
[1:35:59] didn't even understand it they didn't
[1:36:01] even understand it because when jesus
[1:36:03] died peter and all of them got depressed
[1:36:06] and these are to rose again and they had
[1:36:08] to open their understanding
[1:36:10] in his resurrection ministry to what was
[1:36:12] about to happen and even still they had
[1:36:15] to wait until the promise but then all
[1:36:18] of a sudden the bible says there came a
[1:36:21] sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty
[1:36:23] wind and it filled the whole house oh
[1:36:26] hallelujah it was not a regular service
[1:36:28] it was a different kind of service they
[1:36:30] had been in powerful services they had
[1:36:32] jesus as their pastor but this service
[1:36:35] was different all of a sudden there came
[1:36:38] a sound from heaven as of a rushing
[1:36:40] mighty wind and what was manifested
[1:36:43] temporarily before was now ready to be
[1:36:46] made manifested permanently and jesus
[1:36:49] divided himself and step into peter's
[1:36:52] heart and give peter a boldness that he
[1:36:55] never knew before give him an assurance
[1:36:58] he never had before
[1:37:01] and gave him something
[1:37:03] that he could go to the gate called
[1:37:05] beautiful
[1:37:07] and say silver and gold i don't have
[1:37:09] but i have a connection
[1:37:11] hallelujah hi i'm a branch and i'm
[1:37:14] connected to a vine
[1:37:16] harley look you say rise up and walk and
[1:37:19] that man who was crippled started to
[1:37:21] walk and started to jump and shout and
[1:37:23] then the devil knew he was in trouble
[1:37:25] because the connection was
[1:37:26] re-established and god made it so
[1:37:29] perfect that even to this day now you
[1:37:32] could still get that same connection and
[1:37:34] not a different connection because the
[1:37:36] promise of the holy ghost is just as
[1:37:38] real today as it was on the day of
[1:37:41] pentecost
[1:37:42] [Applause]
[1:37:45] not a different holy ghost
[1:37:49] and friends
[1:37:50] peter didn't even know who he was you
[1:37:52] know
[1:37:52] peter backslid
[1:37:54] peter denied christ peter made mistakes
[1:37:58] but he was still predestinated
[1:38:00] peter denied even knowing christ
[1:38:02] but that seed in him
[1:38:04] was a guarantee that there was a life to
[1:38:07] follow that word seed that even though
[1:38:11] peter was in his condition peter still
[1:38:13] found himself in the upper room and i
[1:38:15] don't care what condition you are in
[1:38:16] this day you have found yourself to the
[1:38:19] upper room may this convention be an
[1:38:22] upper room experience for you between
[1:38:24] you and god
[1:38:26] [Applause]
[1:38:33] oh blessed be
[1:38:35] the name of the lord
[1:38:37] everybody feeling fine
[1:38:42] brother branham said in the message the
[1:38:43] world is falling apart he said what we
[1:38:46] need to do is get connected that's all
[1:38:48] right now
[1:38:49] get connected with christ our lives of
[1:38:52] our emotion the lies of our mind
[1:38:54] connected to him
[1:38:56] the restoration of the full world made a
[1:38:58] way for a perfect connection the word as
[1:39:01] the conductor of the spirit so the
[1:39:03] husband and the lord himself send the
[1:39:06] prophet to reveal every mystery
[1:39:09] hallelujah so we could have the fullness
[1:39:12] of the word now in the message
[1:39:13] perfection but everybody said time now
[1:39:16] time is this little loop it loops down
[1:39:18] jesus was from eternity to eternity but
[1:39:22] he stepped into the time space and was
[1:39:24] made flesh and came through here in
[1:39:26] order to sanctify or put a streak of
[1:39:29] blood all over this place to redeem it
[1:39:31] and connect it back with god again for
[1:39:33] all eternity listen for all eternity you
[1:39:37] see it that's all time is
[1:39:39] in time-tested memorials that's the way
[1:39:42] god does his church
[1:39:43] and listen to this quote now he gives
[1:39:46] you trial after trial
[1:39:48] test after test
[1:39:50] trial after trial anybody feel this way
[1:39:53] test after test
[1:39:54] until listen what he's looking for the
[1:39:57] life of christ is reflected in your life
[1:40:01] until you become peaceful sober meek
[1:40:04] gentle humble ready submissive willing
[1:40:09] turn your head from the things of the
[1:40:10] world i'm reading the prophet's word
[1:40:13] looking straight to calvary to the one
[1:40:15] who's doing the beating many times you
[1:40:17] think it's strange because fiery trials
[1:40:20] and sickness and persecution is only
[1:40:23] done to test you to get the dirt out of
[1:40:26] you to get the sludge out of you to get
[1:40:30] the slowness out of you to wake you up
[1:40:33] to the place where you could look and
[1:40:35] see the reflection or men see the
[1:40:38] reflection of christ in you christ in
[1:40:40] you the hope of glory can the church
[1:40:43] give the lord a shout of praise
[1:40:44] [Applause]
[1:40:48] that's such a powerful quote i want to
[1:40:50] read it one more time
[1:40:51] hallelujah because this court puts the
[1:40:54] rest you're complaining this quote puts
[1:40:56] to rest your problems this quote puts
[1:40:59] the rest why me why this how this
[1:41:02] happened why this happened he said
[1:41:04] that's the way god does his church he
[1:41:07] gives you trial after trial so get used
[1:41:10] to it test after test trial after trial
[1:41:14] test after test
[1:41:17] somebody said trial after trial
[1:41:20] test after test
[1:41:23] and the where the prophet said trial
[1:41:25] after trial test after test trial after
[1:41:28] trial test after test
[1:41:32] until in other words this keeps
[1:41:34] repeating
[1:41:36] over and over and over again
[1:41:39] trial and testing trial and testing so
[1:41:41] don't complain about it because this is
[1:41:43] god's way
[1:41:46] trial after test until the life of
[1:41:49] christ
[1:41:51] so until he sees this
[1:41:53] you have another child coming you know
[1:41:55] until he sees his reflection you have
[1:41:58] another test coming

[1:42:01] turn your family against you he could
[1:42:03] turn the church against you he could
[1:42:05] turn your wife against you he could
[1:42:06] throw in a better sickness
[1:42:11] try it after triumph test after it's a
[1:42:14] process because when he's done with you
[1:42:16] it's no more your idea you're feeling
[1:42:18] your emotion it's just jesus
[1:42:21] it's just jesus
[1:42:23] says we would see jesus
[1:42:26] until the life of christ is reflected in
[1:42:28] your life until you become listen how
[1:42:31] much words brother branham use here
[1:42:33] peaceful

[1:42:38] humble
[1:42:39] ready are you ready submissive
[1:42:42] willing turn your head from the things
[1:42:44] of the world and look straight to
[1:42:46] calvary to the one who's doing the
[1:42:48] beating
[1:42:50] many times you think it's strange
[1:42:52] because fiery trials and sickness and
[1:42:54] persecution it's only done to test you
[1:42:57] to get the dirt out of you
[1:43:00] to get the sludge out of you
[1:43:02] to get the slowness some of us just too
[1:43:05] slow
[1:43:06] but the brandon would say stand up
[1:43:08] quickly and claim your healing he said
[1:43:10] don't move don't muslim receive it
[1:43:12] quickly the word is going for respond
[1:43:14] quickly
[1:43:16] to get the slowness out of you to wake
[1:43:18] you up
[1:43:20] how much more trials and testing do you
[1:43:22] need for you to be woken up
[1:43:25] to the place where you can look and see
[1:43:26] the reflection
[1:43:28] or men can see the reflection of christ
[1:43:30] in you christ
[1:43:31] in you the hope of glory
[1:43:34] hallelujah i am the vine yeti branches
[1:43:38] and these branches supposed to produce
[1:43:39] fruit
[1:43:40] the vine doesn't produce the fruit the
[1:43:42] branches produce the fruit
[1:43:44] in the message of conflict between god
[1:43:46] and satan
[1:43:47] fruits of the spirit what she's got
[1:43:50] listen to the prophet what is this fruit
[1:43:52] is with joy
[1:43:53] that's what he's supposed to have joy of
[1:43:55] her heart knowing that he's coming soon
[1:43:59] anybody have that joy anybody looking
[1:44:01] for that joy knowing that he's coming
[1:44:02] soon
[1:44:04] he said peace of mind what peace of mind
[1:44:06] know what no matter what comes or what
[1:44:08] goes
[1:44:09] let the ship rock let the storms come
[1:44:11] let the lightning flash the thunder roar
[1:44:14] whatever takes place don't make a bit of
[1:44:16] difference atomic bombs could fall you
[1:44:19] can build rock shelter bombshell
[1:44:21] whatever you want to do but she's still
[1:44:23] saying amen amen why she is 45 fortified
[1:44:27] and what the word the word what made
[1:44:30] flesh i'm reading the prophet you know
[1:44:31] dwelling among us
[1:44:33] watching him move among us in our
[1:44:36] assembly see
[1:44:37] there he is so what difference does it
[1:44:39] make
[1:44:41] oh hallelujah
[1:44:43] from the message what is the holy ghost
[1:44:45] now the spirit of god has worked under
[1:44:48] justification understand on the luther
[1:44:50] sanctification under uh under wesley the
[1:44:54] the baptism of the holy ghost under
[1:44:55] pentecost and here it is in the last day
[1:44:57] performing and doing the very same thing
[1:45:00] that it did when it was in christ what
[1:45:02] is it the church and christ has become
[1:45:04] one
[1:45:06] that's what is it branch and vine right
[1:45:08] as soon as they connect together that
[1:45:10] last link
[1:45:11] she'll go through the sky shouting up

[1:45:15] rest of them back in those days there
[1:45:17] he's at first will be last hallelujah
[1:45:20] we're at the end time
[1:45:23] listen that's what the holy ghost does
[1:45:25] the holy ghost by justification see just
[1:45:28] a little shadow of it the holy ghost by
[1:45:30] sandification so what is the prophet
[1:45:31] showing that is the same holy ghost that
[1:45:34] was operating in every age it was the
[1:45:36] same holy ghost by justification the
[1:45:38] same holy ghost by scientification a
[1:45:40] little deeper shadow of it the holy
[1:45:42] ghost by the baptism of it a deeper
[1:45:44] shadow no
[1:45:45] the holy ghost by the restoration of his
[1:45:48] very person being in here forming signs
[1:45:52] and wonders like he did at the beginning
