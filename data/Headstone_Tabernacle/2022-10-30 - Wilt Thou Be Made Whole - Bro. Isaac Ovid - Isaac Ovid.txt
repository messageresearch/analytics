the very reason we live father oh Hallelujah the name of the Lord [Music] also suddenly reach you in the precious theme of the Lord Jesus Christ thank you musicians if you have your Bibles let's get straight to the word just one portion of scripture I like to read from Saint John 5. from verse 1 . certainly appreciate a service on Wednesday night for the Solomon achina what a blessing what a an anointing word a presence what a word and you season and certainly the prayer meeting on Friday night man so reading Saint John 5 and reading from verse 1. after this there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem now there is that Jerusalem by the Sheep Market a pool which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda having five porches and in these lay a great multitude of impotent Folk of blind halt withered waiting for the moving of the water for an angel went down at a sitting season into the pool and troubled the water whosoever then fist after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had and a certain man was there which had an infirmity 30 and eight years and when Jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case he say it unto him will thou be made whole may the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning I like to take for a text will thou be made whole amen I remember preaching on this message maybe 20 years ago at that time we were having service downstairs because we were doing some work upstairs and it's been some time so I can't remember how the message was delivered 20 years ago but I do remember preaching on this subject will thou be made whole not all services are the same I'm not just speaking about difference in who is speaking and the day of the service but there are some services that focus on ministering to the needs of the people we are a needy people and different people have different needs and through the grace of God and the administration of the spirit there are some services that focus on the needs what is your need may he speak to your need this morning there are some services that focus on healing and deliverance and breakthroughs so this is tie to prayer lines and the prophet in his ministry and in his time and different phases of his ministry will have healing campaigns the whole objective of that service was to bring healing to the people bring breakthrough to the people cast out demons upon the people some services for ministering some services for healing and breakthrough and and then there are some services that focus on Doctrine teaching and bringing Clarity to the foundations and purpose of our faith our text this morning in Saint John 5 finds Jesus having an encounter on a certain day in a certain place in a certain way and effectively in this encounter he does all three he ministers he heals and he brings Doctrine all in one encounter all for the kind of service that God would Minister he will bring healing and he would bring Doctrine to us that not only can the needs of our hearts and our souls and our minds be dealt with but the spiritual activation and the moving and the rustling the mulberry tree that's required to shake us from lethargy into action could also move us from a state of being blind to being able to see from being lame to being able to walk from being dead to being raised up because there's a spiritual moving of the spirit that's beyond the world just going forth and yet still on top of that to give us doctrine that we can live a word in due season now we can know how to move how to act how to operate how to deal with those around us how to live as a Christian especially in such a time as this and the church say Amen this text we read in Saint John 5 I'm just laying a little background before we get into the preaching John is unique in how he delivers as part of one of the four Gospels I've said it before that when you look through the gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John they represent four perspectives of the same series of events Matthew looks at it one way Mark looks at it another way Luke looks at it another way and John looks at it when you look at Matthew he looks at the chronological movement and he goes back and lays out the genealogy and each one touches it his own way John is unique and the reason I'm raising it is because this passage of scripture is not found in any other book but the Book of John there are many experiences you can find in the different books but this one is unique and John is a unique deliverer of his of the word of God because he starts off with in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning was God and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made then him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shined in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not and he went strong on Doctrine he came unto his own and his own receipt I'm not that's the way John wrote that's the way John ministered but as many as received him to them give me power to become the sons of God he was introducing sonship in the very first chapter of John he was introducing this concept of sonship but as many as received him that them gave past tense he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not a blood nor of the will of the flesh so your birth was not your parents doing Family Planning Hallelujah it was not of the will of the flesh nor of the will of manner but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us that's how John ministered [Music] anybody with me this morning what is Captain here in John 5 is significant that is also paradoxical and I don't know what drove you to church this morning in the sea of the negativity of the weather and the storms maybe you have a great need maybe you're here because you're just supposed to be in church maybe you're here this morning because your heart is longing for a greater experience of a deeper Walker I pray to God that there's a deep desire for you being here yes you may have been invited but I pray that there's something more than just an invitation that's strumming the strings of your heart that you could say oh I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord the Bible says no man could come unless the father draws so even though you are here this morning it's God drawing you into his presence God drawing you into his word god drawing you into an experience with the supernatural that you could never be a Sim again every encounter with God is never to leave you the same way he met you it's always to bring change and your present here this morning is going to change you I guarantee it's going to change you it could be for the worse or it could be for the better some people they leave to church worse than they came in but I pray to God you live better you can never come to the house of God and leave the same way that you came something has got to happen somebody preached me this morning [Applause] can I just talk to you a little bit can we encourage one another a little bit last week Sunday we spoke about anchor points of Faith where we are reminded of certain things that took place so that when the devil shakes us we can rock back on the young car and know that the anchor holds in spite of the storm that no matter what the devil throws away no matter what I built through our way no matter what the doctors report your wife your children your neighbor the economy the government it doesn't matter there's an anchor in the scripture that he could hold on to and you could say the Lord did it for him he could do it with me if he did it for her he could do it for me I know he's done it for me before he did something for me last week he did something for me last month he did something with me 10 years ago he did something with me 15 years ago I saw what he did from Mama I saw what you did for Papa I saw how he changed brother so and so I saw returned from sister so and so when is it gonna be my time when is it gonna be my season I know he's a prayer answering God I know if a miracle working God that's not the issue this morning the issue is what about me what about my situation what about my need what about my conditioner what about my back against the wall nobody knows what I'm going through I'm here this morning on a wing and a prayer I'm here this morning barely screaming because the devil knocked me up against a wall but I'm here this morning to worship and to cry and to seek and to say Lord don't forget me don't forget your son don't forget your daughter don't forget me this morning [Applause] [Music] you may be seated Hallelujah a simple message but I prayed both this morning so it's in John 5 you read the scripture after this there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem in the Amplified it simply says later on so we are going Beyond Saint John 1 2 3 4 to just some point in time that's a bit later on there was a feast and Jesus went up to Jerusalem can the church say Amen the scripture doesn't tell us exactly which Feast it was every Jewish treat was important every Jewish feast was an anchor point every Jewish priests had a purpose and it was a reminder of how God had dealt with them where it was the Feast of the Passover when they will remember how God hallelujah tougher them in Egypt where it was the Feast of the unleavened bread or the Peace of the first fruit it didn't matter what the feast was Jesus wanted to be there every true Jew wanted to be present in Jerusalem once there was a celebration of a peace you couldn't tell me you were a real Jew if you were not going to celebrate the Anchor Point of the feast anybody with me this morning Hallelujah if you were not there there was a question about your revelation of the significance of how God took you out of Egypt Hallelujah at every Feast it was the same Feast they celebrated every year it wasn't a new message it wasn't a new doctrine it was the remember when when there was this plague and when all the firstborns were supposed to die and we took the blood and we put it on the doorpost and every single year they would have the same message the same reminder and every single year if you are real Jew you were identified with the feasts you couldn't absent yourself from the feedstock you couldn't upset yourself from the fellowship you can absent yourself from the service [Applause] what it was the Feast of Pentecost the Feast of trumpets the day of the atonement or the Feast of the Tabernacle any true Jew wanting to be there for the feast when it was Wednesday service when it was prayer meeting where there is Sunday service it didn't matter you were identified with every Anchor Point which was a reminder of how God took you through what God wanted you to know what he was building upon anybody in the house this morning [Applause] even outside of the seven Great feasts they had the Festival of the Feast of Purim you know what that one was that was a reminder of when Esther went to the king and save our parents are perish but are going to see the king oh Hallelujah and mercy was brought to the Jews God established a feast to remember that they could have all been dead wiped out as a people but through the grace of God and to the testimony of faster how could you forget that if it wasn't for them you couldn't be in church this morning [Applause] building into something because I want you to understand how this is unfolding so Jesus the word made flesh there was nothing about the world you could tell Jesus because he was the word [Applause] [Music] he didn't say I'm not going to it because I know it already the world made flesh left Galilee to head to Jerusalem for one primary reason to celebrate the feasts this should come as no surprise to us because when he was 12 years old Luke captures in Luke 2 42 they went up to Jerusalem I after the customer defeated Feast it was because of the feast I'm going to the speak to the faces how he end up in the temple talking about I must be about my father's business he ended up in the temple because he was going to the feast did you come to Feast this morning what did you come to is it Church you came to or you came to the feast oh the spiritual peace that God has laid out for us this morning [Applause] a little surprise I wanted to catch something because they will get so mature in their Christian walk that they don't think they need the Lord and they don't need Church any morning they sit on them I want to play tips and relax for Jesus left Galilee it takes 30 hours on average for the Raymond to leave Galilee and come to Jerusalem let me remind you there were no taxis there were no buses there were no trains there was no public transportation system so Jesus had to make a choice to leave Galilee to come to Jerusalem for the purpose of the feast it should come as no surprise to us because in Luke 4. the Bible says he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom words he went into the synagogue so Jesus was always in church listen to the name talk about him knowing but wait man that's it you have that mixed up there you know but he didn't he didn't correct him could you imagine Jesus sitting in the temple and they're talking about him and he's just smiling Discerning their hearts knowing what's going on there but he doesn't absent himself because it is part of what you're supposed to do as a Christian to be in Fellowship Hebrews 10 25 not forsaken the assembling of ourselves together if Jesus could make it his business to go to church what about you let this be a reminder to us because Jesus get a cycle going to heal somebody else but he placed himself under the law under the requirement to give us an example come the church say amen he was the word and the word still went to the temple every scripture reference in a temple would point to him and he still went to the temple there was nothing they could teach him but he still went to the temple anybody with me this morning you know it's a little bottle suddenly a little encouragement to you to find yourself in church find yourself in the presence find yourself in Fellowship find yourself among Believers find yourself where you can lift your Praises again as you were in the upper room in one mind and one Accord under expectation for the promise Hallelujah until churches get shut down find yourself in the house of God Hallelujah if Jesus had to plan in advance it'll take three fives I don't know how long it took to get there but Anthony but it was not getting up this morning I'm feeling to go to church he had to leave in sufficient time to get there on time because there was 30 hours of walking to do to get to the house so I want us to picture this morning Jesus leaving Galilee and he's walking walking walking to Jerusalem thinking about the I don't know which Feast what he was thinking about the feast because when you're on your way to do something it it consumes you it's your purpose it's your destination you're heading somewhere verse two now there is a Jerusalem by the Sheep Market the pool we're just calling the Hebrew tongue Bethesda having five poachers in the Amplified it says now in Jerusalem made a sheep gate so in the King James it says the Sheep Market in the Amplified it says the Sheep gate John is painting a very clear picture of what is unfolding friends there's more than one way to get into Jerusalem there's more than one gate to enter Jerusalem there's more than one kid that surrounds Jerusalem in fact around the time of Jesus there should have been at least seven entrance points if you go back to the days of Nehemiah there were about 10 Gates that you could enter the truth it was a choice which geared to choose to enter into the walls of Jerusalem Jesus chose to pass through the Sheep gate pass through the Sheep Market the Sheep Market was the main place where the animals for all the Sheep was gathered where the wait where you could go and buy a sheep to do the sacrifice the Sheep gate was where the Lambs would be led through the Sheep gave on their way to be sacrificed and Jesus choose to enter into Jerusalem via the Sheep gate I want you to think about that and what I felt it noteworthy that John would capture the subtle but significant fact that the Lamb of God that would take away the sin of the world would choose to pass through the same gate how many lambs would have been ushered through on their way to be sacrificed but he willingly subjected himself to just let me enter by the Sheep gate past the Sheep Market where they would be checking out looking for lambs without blemish looking for lambs without spotting looking for alarm saved could this one be the one that I can often sacrifice and Jesus says finally coming in close to Jerusalem walking between all these lambs and these conversations and he finds himself walking towards the looking back to Nehemiah and we studied it when we studied Nehemiah that in rebelling the walls of Jerusalem the very first place they restored was the Sheep gate in Nehemiah chapter 3 verse 1 then Elias shipped the high priest rolls up with his breath when the priests and they build it the Sheep gate they Sanctified it and settled the doors of it even into the Tower of mere they Sanctified it until the Tower of Hannon Hill and next to him build it a man of Jericho I'm next to them building soccer so they were building and restoring the walls around Jerusalem and they started at the Sheep gate because they understood the role of sacrifice they understood that the body altered and about a way for the ship to pass the end of that chapter ends with and between the going up of the corner until the ship gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants in other words by the currents they started at the ship gate restored the entire wall of Jerusalem and finish up by the Sheep just throwing some stuff to you in the scriptures in history if you were to walk into Jerusalem now but appeal to wear that place that was called as she did is identified and you ask anybody around there what is the name of this gate they will tell you it's called the Lion's gate you go figure that out we'll study that out the gate that was once called a sheep gate is now called the Lions Beyond [Music] back then it was called a chicken but today in our day that same place of Entry is called Lions game what do you research but there it was back then as John baptism Jesus is walking there and what is notable about there is that right where the Lambs are gathered and right alarms are passion there's a pool a pool and that word Bethesda means House of Mercy House of kindness having five porches five coverings to protect the people from the elements as it were the same you have Bethlehem House of God's bread or House of Bread path means house lehem means bread and Jewish Beth Esther that Esther means kindness or Mercy the house of kindness so Jesus chooses to not just pass through the Sheep market and pass by the ship gave body he's walking on the way to the feast yeah and the lamb walks through a sheep gate and mercy passes by the House of Mercy kindness passed by the house of kindness Hallelujah and there will gather the Bible said a multitude of people House of Grace a multitude of people who were there almost Hospital have you ever walked into a hospital and see people sick needy looking for help the Bible says indeedly a great multitude of impotent folk of blind heart with a waiting for the moving of the water oh what a sight to see Church of people who are gathered from all over looking for a chance to get help because they couldn't help themselves many were blind many were lame many were crippled many needs maybe they had spent all their money and they had no more money so they had to rely on coming right there by this pool of Bethesda because the Bible says at a certain season an angel will come and stir the waters they didn't know what day he would come they didn't know what time he would come but they knew that at a certain season an angel will come and stir the waters and whoever was first to get in whoever was the first person to get in was gonna get healed of whatsoever disease he had whosoever was first oh hallelujah hallelujah a stirring what we need is another stirring a storing of the waters a troubling of the waters some of us the waters are too still some of us there's nothing going on but may the angel come and stir the water in your home map may he disrupt what's going on in your home but some of us our lives are too calm May the angel come and Trouble the waters may he shovel the waters this morning oh hallelujah hallelujah in the message of third seal that's the reason the daily revivals we're supposed to have we have denominational revivals we have another real stirring no no no no no no no sir don't think we've got revivals we haven't or they've got millions millions of church members but that the Revival nowhere the pride hasn't had a Revival yet there's been a Revival there no manifestation of God to stir the pride we are looking for it it'll take those seven and none unknown pandas back here to wake her up again he will send it he promised it oh Hallelujah May the angel of the Lord May the angel of the Covenant stir the waters this morning oh it'll take those seven tunnels to stir these Waters it'll take a great power to stir these water [Applause] [Applause] the angel would stir the waters come on church I want you to pay attention and here's why I need to pay attention and whosoever then first after the troubling of the water step in was being whole of whatsoever disease so it's two things that are happening here you have to be first and it didn't matter what the problem was it didn't matter what the disease was it didn't matter what the situation was you had a blank check if it was mental if it was physical if it was emotional whatever the disease was it didn't matter there was no limit in what disease was being addressed so that is not the issue issue is not the disease because that's been sorted out whatsoever disease you had the issues first I want to be fish so it's another thing to be first for the clients you have to pay attention everybody's sick everybody dead everybody struggling but you have to be first now with your copy listen I've been in hospital rooms you know people talking to one another how you're feeling today but I feel alone better you know well I'm feeling worse but listen don't get interested to know I'm not here to make friends I'm here to be first I want you to get something here we can have Fellowship friendship is part of it but when the angel comes I don't know you and you don't know me that is the kind of situation it was because my problem is bigger I have a big problem and for everybody their problem and speak I don't know listen I don't you don't hear me this morning I don't know what you came to church for this morning it's wonderful to see everybody but I came to get mine I don't know about you but I came to get in mind and I want to be focused because I want to be first I love you I appreciate you but it is me or nobody else or me or listen I want mine you do not hear me this morning can I preach a little bit I'll pray for you I'll encourage you your time is coming but I looking for the angel I don't want to be so distracted in talking about this or that that I miss my chance because whosoever first steps into the water listen my body and pain my tiny Deliverance I pray for you you know but I want to be first I want a timer just right I can't afford to be late a cows want to be on my phone reading messages because I'm going to do your body tiny minute that the angel trouble the water so that the moment in trouble I want there to be or you don't hear me this morning oh God this is One race you don't want to be second you don't want to be filled you don't want to be present you don't want to be a participator you want to be anybody with me this morning to be first you have to pay attention you have to be focused you have to be alert to the current you know how I am by the grace of God I read back the scripture again many limb halt so I'm thinking about if Lord if I was there how focused I would be watching for the water but wait a minute the Bible said that blind people who couldn't see yeah so they couldn't even watch to see if the angel was going to search outside the water so you have to be listening don't talk to me right now don't talk I'm listening don't call me now I'm listening Angel is coming I've been praying for a long time I can't see him but I've got to listen or you don't hear me this morning anybody in the house foreign people it was a multitude you couldn't afford to be distracted the person next to you is needy I know but oh God helped me to be first we might be friends but oh God I need to be first being there is not good enough you need to be ready to go into action you can't be on a recliner team will I come and prepare area to wait so I could just lay back up with a pillow no you have to be ready to spring into action you have to have a first mover advantage they have to be in position so you dare you want to get there early you want to talk to people and you push away in front you want to somehow work your way to get here because you want to be close you want to be as close to the edge as possible you don't believe back in the back of the church well I had to see what's going on I just observing and see what they preach I go please you don't care who preaching you don't care what's going on you just want to be there so that the moment the angel trouble the water you could be the [Music] anybody here this morning being there was not just good enough God wasn't rewarding through the angel attendance he was rewarding action takers take a fast action figures being here in church this morning is not good enough are you ready to respond are you ready to respond because they're in the water this morning you know oh yes yes yes make no mistake about it he's here he's about to travel to what he's looking to see who will be first this morning do you have a need did you come with a knee this morning in the message the way back is there anybody want to find a way back said it is the holy spirit trying to get something into us he's trying to inject something your patience is wonderful and that does good but may God fail every hungry heart that will really Reach Out When You See It Don't Wait Another Minute reach up and get it right there it is passing by he may not pass away again friends don't miss the service I'm not going to be too long with you but one that rustle in the mulberry tree that's turning of the water diving diving head first forget who next to you forget what the side of you you dive in [Applause] the message look he said we're looking for the coming of the lord we look at the Holy Ghost falling in the last days we look at signs and wonders we watch what's taking place see don't you see what what you're looking at that's exactly what God would said would take place let Faith grab it say I wanted to the first little move at the pool of Bethesda I'm reading a prophet they rush to get to it or if the people here if you haven't received the Holy Ghost this morning if that first little tinkle would say that's your truth that man is telling the word that the truth and hurry as quick as you can don't wait what are you looking at what are you waiting for you're always later than you think get moving towards it as fast as you can oh God I wish that every sick person here I'm reading the Prophet this morning that feels his holy spirit in our presence now could realize that's the evidence of a prayer that you prayed has been answered in the presence of God every man who wants a baptism of the Holy Ghost if you feel a little Grand feeling saying I believe that's a truth that's the evidence raise up your hand and say God I receive it now something would tip I don't know so I want you to see the picture Jesus left Galilee walked for this walked by the Sheep Market is making his way in front of the people heading to the feast he didn't come to be recognized he didn't come to deal with situations he didn't come to minister to anybody I want to be clear on this and we'll see it as we read further in the scripture he was not ready for his ministry to be made public there were many times we started where he said tell no man what I did keep it a secret because the time is not hit so Jesus coming in quietly unannounced amen and verse 5 and a sin man was there which had an infirmity 30. and eight years what a time to have a situation in your life 38 years something wrong 38 years sick 38 years you're struggling 38 years you're coming to church looking for something and the Bible says in verse 6 when Jesus saw him lie a new that he had been now a long time in that case you see it unto him without be mean who in the Amplified it says when Jesus noticed him so I want you to see about the Karen Jesus is walking but many times speak about people ask why would Jesus not heal let me say because Jesus will only do what if I ever show him compassion is not feeling sorry for people got passions in the will of God so Jesus is walking and he's walking and I wonder if Jesus were to walk to the church this morning and just walk him and I don't know if at what point but Anthony he stopped walking because something caught his attention there were so many people but a joy was a multitude but one person caught his attention and he noticed him 38 years and he asked him a strange question a strange question to ask someone who had been sick for so long because who wouldn't want to be May rule but yet Jesus asked the question didn't this man choose to be in a place where people were looking for healing how could Jesus asked him well now we need who wasn't his condition obvious what was Jesus trying to get at shouldn't they have been a look in his face in his eyes that should have made that question unnecessary yeah man um could it be that Jesus or hope and hopelessness mixed together what a combination and part of this for me friends is I've been in so many services where and no people need help ask yourself the question do they rehab it's not a simple question you see all the calls and people should be the first at the altar but they don't want to come do you really want help could it be that the man was there but he wasn't there he was there but he wasn't there could it be that the Lord perceived at his infirmity had become moral physical and had now become an infirmity of the mind and the Heart could it be here to reach a stage where if it happens it happens could it be here become indifferent hungry for so long you're no longer feel hungry it's as if Jesus wanted to be really sure I see you here in church this morning but do you really want to be delivered I see your body here you're at the pool but I'm not seeing any real desperation anymore do you really want help do you really want to change do you really want Deliverance do you really want to break through I know you're saying amen or no but do you really want it [Applause] do you really want transformation will thou be made whole you see come into the pool had changed for this man it was not always that way there was a time even though he had his infirmity his feet was higher his expectation was higher his Hope was higher his desire was higher but no coming to the pool had just become a routine he was there with no real intention of going into the pool hear me and hear me well Church of the Living God he was at the place where the angel would come but he really wasn't serious he had already made up his mind that it was not for him after a long time in the message he had just come to accept this as something that he's supposed to do to show up just in case something work out just in case I go but it's just in case and out of everybody who was there that's what Jesus noticed I can't help but Wonder if there's anybody here today in the same condition yeah yeah in church but you're really not here the question the Lord Jesus asked on that day is still unnecessary question amen Jesus was asking this man quietly because he wasn't trying to bring attention to himself you really want this you really want the Holy Ghost you really want to change your talk you really want that jealousy to come out your heart you really want the Envy to come out you really want that lost demon that pornographic Spirit you really want that adultery and that fornication and that desire that lion Tom you really want to be made whole I see you here among people who looking for change but you're anyone to give up you're lying and is stealing and he's drinking and you really are you sure you're you're location saying you won't change your condition say change but your mind at heart something is still off yeah but do you really want to be made whole [Applause] in a certain sense it was a religious spirit you know how many people are in churches this morning knowing they need help wanting them but in their mind and heart they already make up their mind that this is not for them it's a real and we'll see it it's a real scripture it's a real situation and that's why this is so important to us oh God help us that we could see beyond our situation to see oh God do you desire 100 years ago when I would hold us I'm not there and it's supposed to be even more than where he was before all these years you come to church your feet actually lower your hope is lower your Expedition is lower will thou be made whole deeper than physical healing will thou be made whole it's about Deliverance it's about restoration it's about Redemption it's about perfection it's about adoption and friends the Lord Jesus wasn't making any assumptions he was not saying because you're in church I'm gonna bless you make no mistake about it there are some people who don't want to change you know you tell them forgive forgive forgive forgive forgive forgive forgive forgive and they still can't forgive will know me at home are you ready to give up that Grudge are you ready to shake that brother's hand your Wonder Revival what you're ready because this whole mess we're talking about Hallelujah not just a miracle is who unless we're talking about will tell me are you ready to give up that Grudge that you're hell everyone for all these 38 years 25 years 20 years I pursuited you're wrong and you still can't see them right here you're in church every year every Sunday every service but do you really want you really want change they're people who don't want to be delivered they give you lip service it is a tragedy when there are people who can't shake one another's hands you want to be whole are you are you you really want to read them all you can't reconcile with your brother can reconcile with your sister they don't want to forsake the world and be completely sold out is this for anybody this morning this friends is not a simple question the question is not do you want to be safe I'm going to hell that's easier than saying I don't want to go to hell not do you want to be saved go to heaven that's an easy question yeah I want to go to heaven the question of will now be made whole speaks to a state of holiness a state of kindness by definition wholeness is a state of forming a complete and harmonious wall a state of being unbroken or undamaged because Jesus was looking at this man and seeing more issues than his infirmity that was now hindering his own healing and his own Deliverance anybody with me this morning could you take some more anybody in the house cool Unity completeness let's have a few quotes before we begin to wind down in Oneness but Abraham said that's God's purpose his purpose as father was to be one with his family whole complete Earthly family the only way that they could be one with a family where God was because God's nature was in them if that's the requirement and the definition of wholeness do you really want that holds it's not a beautiful picture God in his family father over all Supreme no death no sorrow no heartaches no nothing just joy unspeakable never to be sick never to have a heartache just one with God what a picture because the very nature of God was in these people and therefore what they did they followed just in line with God and God with them made them one I'm not talking about coming to church I'm not talking about being in a message I'm not talking about being in the House of Mercy or the House of Grace or being in your Tabernacle this morning the question is do you want to be made truly whole allow me to remind you that only two men were truly whole Adam before he lost it and the Lord Jesus Christ and we can look back to when Adam to before Adam fell when he was whole old to behold like Adam before the fall to have dominion perfect fellowship with God no desire to find satisfaction outside of God he was whole he was happy he didn't have to look for happiness he'd have to go and get a drink you don't have to find another woman you know he was whole he was complete nothing could move him he was satisfied to be in the presence of God he longed to have Holy Communion fellowship with God in the cool of the evening that was being whole he was at peace he did not know sadness he did not know trouble is that the kind of wholeness will thou be made whole if we Define wholeness like that are you ready for that do you really want that are you ready to surrender you all and take his instruction and his will not your will but his will he didn't know pain he didn't know a sin he didn't have to drown his troubles in worldly pleasures oh he was whole I understand in an attending church because it requires you to give up your ambition lots of money loss of popularity lust for big things dead to the believer because he'll want to be whole you want God to complete thing you don't need your job to compete you you don't need money to compete you you don't need your family to complete you you don't need music to come pick you the clothes you wear doesn't complete you showing up the church doesn't complete you your ideas don't complete you only God [Applause] Adam was whole oh God I want to be whole well now we made whole are you really willing to give up friends to people some people are completed with their friends when you pull their friends you recognize how empty they are like when Isaiah when King uziah was pulled back from him and he recognized he was standing there by himself only then you recognize wait a minute I need something more and when he fall asleep at the presence of God he said oh it's me he recognize I'm undone I'm incomplete I thought I was okay I taught us coming to church was enough I thought just believe in the message was enough I told you nobody recognized by missing something look at the Rich Young Ruler he said I followed all the Commandments I know all the law from my youth I had to do anything crazy what lack I yet no I'm not a whole I know I'm not complete I know I'm missing [Music] what lack I yet oh God I want to be whole and when Jesus told him what was required about his head and left sorrow because he wasn't prepared to give up to be whole is there anybody this morning you really you really you really sure because people tell me the show and then they close their way and the way they move on social media and the friends they have it's not in alignment with their profession do you conduct with your wife with your children with your balls with your co-workers is not it's not wholeness it's still you trying to compete yourself and your own and go through a stuff your way to test to see where you will lean if you were lean on him or lean on your own understanding because once you lean on your understand that's not a whole leaning on him his Holiness trusting in Him is wholeness relying on him as wholeness it's a simple message but oh God how many people miss it I'm gonna sit on a chair this morning thinking they're comfortable and they don't realize that they're blind wretched there's a rubble naked and they don't know it will thou be made whole Adam was Hollow to take us back to how Adam was before the fall I'm not going to be too much longer with you but look at Jesus he was whole and it was different still because he lived in a paradise there was no rock shop there was no bar there was no prostitutes there was nobody else around there was nothing but Jesus came with our sinful and he was tempted in every mile and he didn't sit and he was whole in a fallen World in a sinful world and he yet Satan could find no gaps no entry points no points of weakness because there was nowhere to break him because he was old a sealed unit oh when the prophet speaks about seal at the sealed Hall unit the devil can get in and the Holy Ghost can't get out or seal until the day of your Redemption well I'll be made home [Applause] it's a deep message Lot's wife started off good enough she followed the message she believed the message you know started walking on them she said goodbye World enough she was almost out of it you know she was ready and then and then it's as if the question will now be made whole Hallelujah and she wasn't ready there was still something in her heart against the very best teaching she witnessed angels I can imagine she's hearing the noise behind a Sodom is being destroyed what made her look back and they would say Don't Look Back are you sure you want to be made whole amen how many young people have certain Youth Services certain messages and we are where where are they now you bet oh God we need to pray for them we need to lift them up we don't hold any horns of the Altar for them we need to have mercy and say oh God don't forget them don't let their ways turn your your eyes away from them Lord don't hold it against them Lord Hallelujah like Moses Moses said don't judge a people remember you have remember what they said to Abraham remember what they said to Isaac remember Lord stay up and stay here and remember when Moses tried to stand between god like people say Lord have mercy have mercy they deserve to be struck that I'm not saying the door but that's remember you say it's your people remember you see it's your people remember missing your young people Lord they don't have a revelation yet but me by the grace of God some individuals break into the kingdom by saying Lord I want to be the it all [Applause] this is not the kind of jump and Shout for Joy kind of message but it's it's needed Jesus was whole and he was mocked he was old and he was laughed at he was ridiculed he was rejected John said he came under his own and his own received him not are you ready to stand the reproach of being whole the criticism of being whole they caught Jesus the devil and he was whole so what do you think what do you what experience you expect how was the of a believer foreign we sing the song to be like Jesus Jesus was whole that song really means you want to be holen a sealed unit a complete unit nothing missing to behold means you could forgive to be whole means you cherish your prayer life is it just a lip service that I want to be any messenger where is your prayer life because when you're old you have a prayer life and as the prophet lived he said he hung a cross in his castle when he saw the woman on the street he looked at the cross he wasn't trying to live a certain kind of life what are you doing to practice the presence of God that's what wholeness means can the Church Say Amen [Applause] in a message just once more Lord but the man said drunk on the spirit if the Holy Ghost can't just pour into you till you're so drunk you forget what your name is till you forget all your doubts get so drunk on the spirit hallelujah hallelujah oh my children adults man then you can get somewhere with God then the cry once more goes up from the sincerity and then another one Hallelujah filled with the holy God these drunk on the spirit God's righteousness and Holiness and power get you so drunk till you forget who you are you're nothing to begin with remember God wants to come into you this is always once more Lord once more Lord once more Lord once more open Pentecostal run for your life there's just a little time left it's later than you think if I never set another word from this Pulpit remember run for your life it's later than you think I feel the Holy Spirit and me saying say it again run for your life it's later than you think come on your own Brother come on young sister come on Mama come on Papa once more Lord once more fill Life Tabernacle and I say headstone Tabernacle with eternal life every member in here and let the glory of the Lord fall upon this congregation Lord Jesus oh God hallelujah once more Lord once more let man forget who they are let man forget his unbelief and we will cry once more Lord once more oh God Heavenly Father give us a Revival in our souls see the Lambs are smoking the fire on the altar is going out oh Lord God looked down upon a simple Nation but Lord don't forget your people people here have strive for years Lord to build this little economy for you Life Tabernacle of soul-season oh God once more pour your holy Spirit into it search every member up take out every difference send down a reign of God's holy fire lightning our sword Lord with the presence of Jesus Christ May the people not be so stooped in unbelief this man was at the pool but he was we don't believe there they can see that you're here with us and you are the word and the discerner of the thoughts of the heart this great decision of the thoughts of the heart stolen from the wrong man saying will thou remain whole because I've seen a little doubt in your heart I'm not saying you're unbelievable and a senior don't believe but that doubt is hindering your feet help us with our senses oh my there's a few more quotes is this helping anybody this morning this is that I cannot jump for Choice service but Jesus was ministering to this man in the message the unity of one God and no one should be done with unity home is completeness but the working of the Holy Spirit the kingdom of God in you God sets on the throne of your heart that's all in his control room controlling your emotions and controlling are you willing to give up control because giving up control many things you want to do you say well I'll give up control but many of us we want to do what we want to do I want to tell him I want to tell him how I feel about it and God is saying well if once you take over the control let me take over amen we want to get back at people we want to do what we want to do we want to have our own desires our own way our own approach but God set on the throne of your heart in his control room controlling your emotions controlling your powers controlling your conceptions and making you one with him in fellowship and in love and God filled you in love he filled you with power he fills you with the spirit he filled you with his own divine nature and it changes your kind of nature into his nature then in this you become a new creation in Christ foreign so in order if you're born again and got a new parent can you got a new nature there's some people that they just want to hear me but they don't want no new nature [Music] the old nature is dead you got a new nature you want what's going one way now you're going another way you want to us going this way now you're going this way your affections are set on things above a new affection you don't love the things of the world no more what you with all that worthy music all those whirly magazines whatever it is your affections are Now setting things up of a new affection you don't love the things of the world no more and I don't have to be just

looking for a breakthrough and wear any Miracles and how amen church is a routine it cannot work you have to give up something to get something else you have to let go of something to get something else [Applause] people want to hold the things to make the god of their own imagination the way they think God should move and and how God should operate so they carve their lives a certain way having a form of godliness but denying the power the power of redemption the power of repentance the power of making things right I challenge you if you have an ought in your heart today drop it don't you

them mock you for being a Christian but it's time you've grown don't compromise don't give up you want to be whole no weak spots no entry points no one knows for the elevator step into your life close the doors whole complete satisfied anchored in the presence of God oh Hallelujah last quote before we wrap up with the scriptures that's the reason they're coming on the seals and the messenger guide at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of God shall be finished to know who God is what he is how he lives his nature his being you're supposed to be all the way up there by that time see bring us into the full stature of Sons and Daughters of God that's all false toucher means complete full stature mean ready for the headstone to jump down to see the whole thing [Applause] hear it it's for those who think is a Pentecostal message to preaching pregnancy the first touch Daughters of God a church that's washed in the blood of Christ that's brought without money is favored by the blood of Jesus Christ can we head to the home stretch let's go for a seven Saint John five or seven so after Jesus asked this man will thou be made whole but a punch you know what he said he said yes Lord I want to be made whole is that what you're seeing in your scriptures but the necklace could you help us get that that scripture up there Jesus asked the man and that's why the question is that an obvious question because you would think that if I say well though we may hold and say yes but nowhere in verse 7 we see the response yes I wonder how many in this room today would say yes or you will respond like this man sir I have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool so two things here at work firstly you say I hear but I need help yes I have no help I have nobody nobody for me I come here by myself some people here with their family but I hate by myself and nobody really look out for me I hear and nobody care and I have nobody and nobody and I have nobody and I have nobody and I have nobody that we sit here I have nobody so it's not my fault now it's the person who I'm supposed to have is their fault because if they had them the situation if I had some help and they know I was struggling excuses so instead of saying Lord I need help I want to be made whole this man start to bring excuses I have no man to his first excuse was I don't have the support system what is your issues you have an excuse this one a preached a person he has a word no more excuses and people today still I couldn't connect to this woman now because I had a meeting and I just and I immediated church because of this and a thing and a thing and the children get scammers so upset I had to calm down and it was a rough day and work it was rough days I stopped coming I'm not accepted he's supposed to be rough years but a recently with no excuses here it is Jesus asking the man will thou be made whole and his first responses it was more well if my wife to get your children ready for us or the food that is again no food and every Boston lemonly the time I wanted to leave at least I want to make it up time I have no man when the water is trouble to put me so you take yourself out of the effort you want somebody to put you in when the kingdom is preaching every man put me into the pool as the first one the first problem there the Nexus but while I'm coming so you're not saying but even when I try while I start to come another stepping down before me so this here was the University problem so he was there but not there because he didn't even believe that he could have made it his excuses Justified what Jesus noticed his response also showed that he wasn't even considering another possibility that the god of the angel that would Stir the Water could even visit him because his response about well done remain whole wasn't like Lord I want to be made whole and maybe if I against it there maybe God might visit me someday come to my house come to my court come to my mat maybe on my way home from church maybe on the way home from this Feast something can happen but no he who had closed all the possibilities but verse 8 is what I love about Jesus and this is why gurusi met this man Jesus didn't even acknowledge the man's response he rebuked the man for his response Jesus just said to him and this is what I love you though Jesus said you're healed go rejoicing he say rise yes brother Anthony he said do do something take up thy bed and walk all these years are coming to church what you do to be is rice take up your bed and start to walk there stop looking for help from somebody else stop looking for help to come from somebody else to do it for you I want you to rise take up your own bed [Applause] there's power in your hands to rise take up your bed it's not my bed it's your bed I'm not taking up your bed for you rise take up your bed and start to walk I wish I had a room this morning but over there to walk I don't think I have enough room to walk and I don't know but at all what came over this man because for 38 years he'll be doing the same thing but listen this message is something else because up to this point he didn't know who was talking to him I want us to appreciate that Jesus had not introduced himself but this man something triggered in him he began to reflect on his existence maybe it was the thing she said like La posa said whatever stay here and I might as well go on there and die but this man who he didn't know tell him rise take up your bed and walk and the Bible says and immediately it was on the next day it was only next five minutes it was nothing to do with the angel and immediate immediately the man was made whole and he took up his bed and he walked is there anybody this morning who is ready to rise take up your bed and walk out here healed is there anybody this morning maybe you didn't lift your hand in a long time but you're being encouraged to rise get under your feet oh God help me to kind of move a little bit this morning I haven't done in a long time this morning oh [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] man in his nature is rebellious against God he's against God but God loves the man since the Fall In the Garden of Eden God has still been calling for his child and he calls to him through the Thunder through the lightning through the setting of The Sun through the preaching of the Gospel through signs and wonders through prophets through Miracles through Visions God speaking to his people is there anybody really just wanted to rise teacup diet and walk oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh my the musicians helping him to come up I said get ready to wind out so verse 9 let's read a few more verses and immediately the man was made whole he took up his bed and walked and on the same day was he Sabbath verse 10. and the Jews and when John reversed the Jews over the High Council the spiritual leaders the ministers now the elders said unto him that was killed listened see how when God is cured they even say well Brothers let me just give another praise for us before we address this matter we have a city with me to address they even have acknowledge the fact that for 38 years they say it is a Sabbath day it is not lawful for you to carry thy bed you see they have people who will always have a problem with you go to something for you and they find better Steve on some reason to pick at you amen you 38 years you never told me you're getting liver you're finally walking are you excited welcome to the bed and say brother brother do you know what anything Sabbath it is not the law feeds a career but put on the bed verse 11 so he answered them he that made me whole oh I don't know about this Lord I think you're telling me here this morning I don't know what is legalistic you and it's legalistic things listen You Ain't Know My Story 38 years I come in here and I struggling and I'm struggling and you want to come and tell me is he Sabbath to put down this pin I've been bedridden for 38 years the man who made me whole he tell me to take on my bed and walk I don't know where you coming with food you don't hear me this morning don't try to shut up my praise if I listen if I bring the law I pray the Lord [Applause] don't try to take my joy away the man that made me whole he told me to take up my bed and walk the man that made me whole he has given me a new Joy the man who made me whole he has given me Grace I didn't have to wait on the agent he is still there waiting to be first but somebody came to me did they wait until I watched him but the man made me older I'm not the same man I'm not I'm used to be [Applause] verse 12. and listen I want you to catch us he didn't know who it was you know then asks pay him because you know what already happened people know all the people because this is 30 days this is a veteran man who did and he pulled all the time with a fixture he's a partly structure he almost had one brought you only almost approach it's too much yes he did he was he's going to be calling six Sports they say what man is that because up to this time most of the Miracles with not all Jesus did was in Galilee and some Mario hunting so they didn't know she didn't know about the kind of Miracle say which man which one I wanted to catch this nobody recognized them yeah coming in and nobody oh God did not recognize the reason they came to defeats was activists and they didn't recognize him this sheep Market did look at the trade ships and the Lamb of God didn't recognize him the House of Mercy Jesus walking and they didn't recognize him Jesus slipped him minister to a man and slipped out and didn't recognize you say which man is this [Applause] and verse 13. and he that was healed with not who it was he still didn't know for Jesus had conveyed himself away a multitude being in the place so Jesus healing man and disappeared left them all in the bag let the manhole in the mat oh God lead me to Holy mat leave me to hold my bed I can't explain this story I can't even tell you who did it I just know I'm not the same again [Applause] for free and this is what I love about this and this is why I said the issue was deeper than his physical healing it's confirmed here in scripture in verse 14. afterward Jesus finding him in the temple because Jesus knew there was something he had to say to this man and said unto him behold Thou Art made whole SIN number bless the worst thing come unto thee because apart from his physical sickness Jesus discerned some issues in his life Not only was he physically healed but the spiritual crippling held him for all these years God already dealt with it and God wanted him to know not only have I healed you in your body but yeah you're made whole enough I'll sin no more [Music] I know you didn't say yes I want to be made whole but you've been made all I'm challenging you don't go back the way you came don't go back don't go and sin anymore don't go back the way you used to live don't go back in your always I don't know this morning here in the Tabernacle who has issues physical what your issue is your challenge your issue I'm not I'm not trying to deserve that but the question still stands will not be made whole and if that great physician that great master was to move to this place and touch you and touch you and touch you I'm not talking about waiting for the angel now but the angel himself coming to you personally to minister to your need friends don't go back go sit no more don't go back into your always don't go back to your own life I want you to be sold out this message costs Jesus it was part of the plan but it cost Jesus [Music] 15. the man Departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus which made him whole maybe the man couldn't help himself he broke the covering on who it was and verse 16 and therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus and sought to slay him all of this at the of the cost that Jesus was paying to bring Redemption to bring healing this was a trial test or a first case of the cost to bring Salvation it cost to bring healing his persecution set in at that moment in Jerusalem and Jesus answered my father working Heather too when I work and that's why I said at the beginning this message was Jesus bringing ministering healing and Doctrine the moment you they begin to speak in verse 17 he said my father worked hitherto when I work Doctrine my father and I he started at Verse 18 therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him because he not only had broken the Sabbath but said author of God was his father making himself equal with God so God take the Jesus I just had to bring Doctrine to them a minister to a man who needed ministering I brought heal into a man need healing and now I'm gonna bring some Doctrine verse 19 Jesus then after Jesus and send them verily verily I say unto you the sun can do nothing of himself [Music] but what he said the father do for what things however he do with these also do it the sun likewise so he will start to get deeper you see what you see me doing is because he fight over me to do it so if you have a problem with this man who was healed don't just stick it up with me take it up because I am my father all one you don't hear me this morning I know who I am you can't cheat me you can persecute me but he was whole I'm finished this morning may the Lord will she bless you [Music] [Music] like wherever the Gideon comes I don't want to necessarily make an autopall but where you are right now when you see them whenever you hear about every that goes [Music] I preached a message some months ago what will your answer be [Music] if you were to meet the Lord this morning and he would ask you the question will that be made all what will your answer be will you give him excuses because this is the Anchor Point for us Grace met this man hope met this man kindness met this man the Messiah met this man Christ as well back then he overlooked he overlooked the word that came out of his mouth because God had someone to prove friends it will not always have Grace it will not always have mercy it's a judgment seat but because there's blood on the Judgment seated as a mercy seat oh may this be a House of Mercy this morning [Music] this morning message believer for 38 years 38 months 10 years 20 years lost disease lost the
