[15:30] thank you for making a way for us to
[15:32] gather
[15:33] those that are here already those that
[15:35] would join us along the way and even
[15:38] those that couldn't make it for whatever
[15:40] reason we pray that lord of peace that
[15:42] to surpass it our understanding would
[15:45] lord reach into every home into every
[15:47] life into every situation father there

[15:56] happening in our personal lives the law
[15:59] that have an impact lord and how we
[16:01] interact with our environment interact
[16:03] with each other and further we want to
[16:06] make it our business lord to have you as
[16:08] the center of our joy the center of our
[16:10] hope the center of our reality father
[16:13] lord we come tonight lord as a needy
[16:15] people or they are sons and daughters
[16:18] here who have need of restoration need
[16:20] of deliverance need of lord a spirit of
[16:23] reconciliation needs of a time of
[16:26] refreshing
[16:27] lord need that that rustle in the
[16:29] mulberry tree need to hear the still
[16:31] small voice and lord although this may
[16:34] be a virtual meeting lord and a bible
[16:37] study we know with assurance that you
[16:40] were the same yesterday today and
[16:41] forever and you are more than able
[16:43] tonight to break chains and to break
[16:45] shackles and to turn lives around and to
[16:48] give us comfort in the midst of our
[16:50] situation so father we turn this service
[16:53] over to you we want to remember our
[16:54] brother stetson tonight in a special way
[16:57] lord that your healing virtue would move
[17:00] upon him and he would touch him from the
[17:01] crown of his head to the soles of his
[17:03] feet and lord for every need tonight
[17:05] that was expressed in the hearts of your
[17:08] people lord and father as we approach
[17:10] you lord knowing that lord father you
[17:12] are more than able to meet our needs we
[17:14] commit your people into your hands we
[17:17] commit this bible study into your hands
[17:19] may you take me completely out of the
[17:20] way
[17:21] and may you speak with your children
[17:23] father we commit this time into your
[17:25] hands in the precious name of jesus
[17:27] christ and the church says
[17:29] amen and amen and amen so it's certainly
[17:33] good to be back in fellowship
[17:36] um in this way and um to get back into
[17:40] school as it were with our bible studies
[17:42] to encourage one another from the
[17:44] scriptures
[17:45] and to
[17:46] you know either get reinforcement of
[17:48] what we have already seen and know and
[17:50] understand and
[17:52] uh for those who have not had a time or
[17:54] a chance to look at things a certain way
[17:57] you know to get encouragement from the
[17:59] scriptures so that we could be better
[18:01] sons better daughters better stewards
[18:03] better parents better children better
[18:05] believers
[18:06] um better you know participants
[18:10] in this world that we are not of
[18:12] you know so that we could be equipped
[18:13] with the tools to be able to overcome in
[18:16] our daily lives i am a firm believer
[18:18] that this gospel is not a gospel that's
[18:20] limited to sunday worship or
[18:23] limited or wednesday night service or
[18:25] even limited to a bible study in a
[18:27] tuesday but it is a practical gospel for
[18:30] us to live and jesus when he was here on
[18:33] earth he demonstrated his interest not
[18:35] just in the spiritual well-being of the
[18:38] disciples but also the natural and it
[18:40] was for this reason when they had to pay
[18:42] their taxes he told them go fish and
[18:44] find a fish and there was gold in there
[18:46] to show that he didn't tell him go and
[18:48] pray about it he practically solved the
[18:50] issue and the need of that day which was
[18:53] to pay the taxes that they had to deal
[18:55] with so rest assured tonight and every
[18:58] night
[18:59] that the god that we serve
[19:01] is very interested in our well-being
[19:03] he's interested in your health he's
[19:05] interested in your wealth he's
[19:06] interested in your mindset he's
[19:08] interested in your conversations he's
[19:10] interested in your going out he's
[19:12] interested in your coming in and by the
[19:14] grace of god we want to endeavor into
[19:17] the word to find if it's one scripture
[19:20] one verse one word from the bible to
[19:22] encourage somebody tonight it is well
[19:24] worth it so thank you so much for being
[19:27] here we appreciate it we don't take it
[19:29] for granted
[19:30] there are so many ways we could spend
[19:32] our time on a tuesday evening but i can
[19:34] assure you there's no better way to
[19:36] spend your time on a tuesday evening
[19:39] than in fellowship around the word of
[19:40] god god loves to speak to us and he has
[19:44] written this
[19:46] wonderful very long love letter in the
[19:49] form of his word that we could reach
[19:51] into every day any day and find
[19:54] something to lift us up to encourage us
[19:56] to guide us to exhort us to admonish us
[19:59] to rebuke us so that we could be shaped
[20:02] and homes i want to challenge you
[20:04] for the next few minutes
[20:06] of this first day of class as it will um
[20:09] i don't intend to be too long just to
[20:12] kind of set the foundation for us
[20:14] reigniting this tuesday evening
[20:16] conversation
[20:17] but i do want to encourage you to give
[20:20] it your full attention don't let it be
[20:21] something that you you know doing as a
[20:24] as a as a you know we love to see we can
[20:26] multitask you know i'll be multitasking
[20:28] you know
[20:30] you have to give a certain level of
[20:32] attention to the things of god and when
[20:34] you really understand you know how much
[20:36] hours you have in a day in the week and
[20:40] how much you really give to the business
[20:42] of god's kingdom you know i could assure
[20:45] you that once you do the calculation we
[20:47] can do more you know so we want to do a
[20:49] little more tonight and look into his
[20:51] word for some encouragement
[20:53] from the scriptures like i said i'm not
[20:55] going to be too long but by the grace of
[20:57] god i trust that
[20:59] these few words of encouragement would
[21:01] be an encouragement to you tonight
[21:05] i do have a
[21:08] strange title tonight
[21:11] but i will get to it
[21:14] in a in a little bit all right so
[21:17] everybody feeling fine
[21:19] uh trust you have your bibles with you
[21:21] trust you have your
[21:23] some way to reference the scripture with
[21:25] you this evening and by the grace of god
[21:26] we want to turn it over to him so just
[21:30] to kind of layer foundation to introduce
[21:33] it tonight
[21:35] there are five natural senses
[21:39] that govern our interaction with this
[21:41] terrestrial world
[21:44] five natural senses that govern
[21:46] our interaction with this terrestrial
[21:48] world
[21:49] the sense of taste
[21:52] the sense of smell
[21:53] the sense of touch
[21:55] the sense of hearing and the sense of
[21:58] seeing
[21:59] and as spiritual creatures we are very
[22:01] conscious of that sick sense a sick
[22:03] sense of faith
[22:05] but i want to spend a little time here
[22:07] on these five senses to kind of drive
[22:09] down this road to our subject tonight
[22:13] these five senses taste smell touch
[22:16] hearing seeing
[22:17] work together to give us insight
[22:20] to give us awareness
[22:22] to give us consciousness
[22:24] of everything around us
[22:27] taste allows us to enjoy the fruits
[22:31] and good food
[22:33] and very often when you're sitting and
[22:35] eat good food you say tasting good
[22:38] could you imagine a life and an
[22:40] existence without a sense of taste
[22:42] that every meal that you eat
[22:44] taste quote unquote the exact same way
[22:47] that you are unable to differentiate
[22:49] good cooking from bad cooking you're
[22:51] unable to differentiate the work of a
[22:54] very good chef from somebody who's just
[22:56] starting off
[22:57] if without that sense of taste
[22:59] you know there are many things that you
[23:01] can enjoy with that without that sense
[23:03] of taste
[23:04] or the sense of smell that allows you to
[23:07] walk out in the morning after the rain
[23:09] falls and you get that that fresh due
[23:12] early morning
[23:14] people say they're going out to get some
[23:15] fresh air because we live in a world
[23:17] where we are trapped in offices and
[23:19] trapped in houses and if you have ac or
[23:21] whatever it is and you want to
[23:23] there's a difference when you have that
[23:25] sense of smell to smell what is fresh
[23:26] air from air that is not fresh
[23:29] these senses have an impact on our
[23:32] experience on our lives the sense of
[23:34] touch
[23:35] what is it to go down to a river or a
[23:38] beach or and you pass your hands and you
[23:39] feel the water ripple through your
[23:41] fingers there are people who
[23:43] can't experience that and therein lies
[23:45] the beauty of that sense of touch or the
[23:47] sense of hearing
[23:49] hearing birds
[23:50] hearing animals in the distance
[23:53] as opposed to hearing the engines and
[23:55] driving and people want to go into
[23:57] nature but iran himself used to go to
[23:59] escape
[24:00] into the forest into into a place of
[24:03] solitude because sometimes you want to
[24:05] not hear much
[24:07] and that distinction of hearing or not
[24:09] hearing is that sense
[24:11] and the ability to utilize that sense to
[24:13] interact with the world that's around us
[24:16] and then there's a sense of seeing
[24:18] seeing what's right in front of us
[24:21] seeing what's at a distance seeing what
[24:24] might be danger seeing what might be
[24:26] opportunities
[24:28] in isolation each of these senses have
[24:31] their roles to play but in combination
[24:34] they help paint a picture a real picture
[24:37] a picture that is
[24:39] multi-dimensional
[24:41] that allows us to experience the world
[24:43] around us
[24:45] they exist for many reasons to help us
[24:47] to protect us
[24:50] you're driving you're doing something
[24:51] and you hear a sound and you know it's
[24:52] dangerous warning without that you'd be
[24:55] in trouble
[24:56] you see something coming from a distance
[24:58] all of these things matter to us as
[25:00] senses that equip us
[25:03] and help us understand and interpret the
[25:05] world around us
[25:07] many of us we are blessed
[25:10] to have access to these five senses
[25:12] there are many people and and if you
[25:14] don't have a reason to thank god tonight
[25:17] just the ability to see or to heal
[25:20] because when jesus came he came to heal
[25:22] blind eyes he came to address people who
[25:26] who couldn't hear they were deaf and
[25:28] people who couldn't speak and and and
[25:30] sometimes we take these simple things
[25:32] for granted and i want to remind us
[25:35] tonight that just the ability to
[25:37] interact with this world around us to
[25:39] even hear this word tonight is a
[25:41] blessing because they are there those
[25:43] out there who can't even hear can't even
[25:45] see
[25:46] we take some of these things for granted
[25:49] but these things were given to us by god
[25:52] to interact with the world around us
[25:55] anybody with me tonight
[25:57] these senses can be both a blessing or
[26:00] they can be a curse
[26:03] it is not very common conversation to
[26:06] place one sense over another sense it's
[26:09] not something we sit down and say well i
[26:11] really appreciate my sense of smell more
[26:14] than my sense of hearing i really
[26:15] appreciate my sense of seeing over my
[26:18] sense of taste in fact in scripture in
[26:20] first corinthians 12 21 the bible says
[26:23] and the eye cannot say unto the hand i
[26:26] have no need of thee
[26:28] nor the head to defeat i have no need of
[26:32] thee
[26:33] but
[26:34] when you look a little deeper
[26:36] ride with me tonight not going to be too
[26:38] long when you look a bit deeper
[26:41] it is not as simple as needing one more
[26:44] than the other
[26:45] the truth is some senses
[26:48] may be more connected to your destiny
[26:51] than others
[26:53] in subtle ways
[26:55] we could see through scripture
[26:57] references to one sense in particular
[27:01] that can make you
[27:03] or break you
[27:05] revelation 3 17 says
[27:08] because thou sayest i am rich and
[27:10] increase with goods and have need of
[27:13] nothing and knoweth not that thou are
[27:15] wretched
[27:16] and miserable
[27:18] and poor and blind
[27:21] and naked
[27:23] of all the senses referenced here it's
[27:26] only one
[27:29] blind
[27:31] it didn't say can't smell it didn't say
[27:34] it can't taste
[27:37] it basically said can't see
[27:40] i want to
[27:41] encourage and remind the church tonight
[27:44] in many ways success in life comes down
[27:48] to what you see
[27:51] choose to see
[27:53] choose not to see
[27:55] do not see
[27:56] and cannot see
[27:58] i'll say that one more time
[28:00] many times success in life comes down to
[28:03] what you see
[28:05] choose to see
[28:06] choose not to see
[28:08] do not see
[28:10] and cannot see
[28:13] we often hear statements such as if only
[28:16] i had seen who he was
[28:19] who he really was
[28:21] if only i had seen who she really was
[28:26] we hear statements such as i do not know
[28:28] what she sees in him
[28:31] not what she smells in him
[28:33] what she sees in him
[28:35] in business we reference the fact that
[28:37] great entrepreneurs
[28:39] see
[28:40] opportunities
[28:42] that others cannot see
[28:45] there are countless stories of bankers
[28:48] who just could not see what was in a
[28:51] business plan only to regret missing out
[28:54] on a great opportunity
[28:57] such is this ability
[29:00] to see
[29:03] failure to see
[29:04] we reference lot
[29:07] and we say if lot had seen
[29:10] what was happening to his family
[29:12] or what could have happened to his
[29:14] family would he have made
[29:16] the same decision
[29:18] that he would have made
[29:19] that's how powerful
[29:21] sight is
[29:23] the ability to see
[29:25] without a vision
[29:26] the people perish it doesn't say without
[29:29] the sense of smell
[29:31] or the sense of hearing there's
[29:32] something powerful about vision
[29:35] about seeing
[29:37] about the ability to see about
[29:39] understanding what you see
[29:41] understanding what you do not
[29:44] see
[29:45] cannot see
[29:47] not trained
[29:49] to see
[29:51] within recent years and as time has
[29:54] unfold we have seen crime and criminal
[29:56] activity increase
[29:58] and with that increase in crime and
[30:00] criminal activity
[30:02] there's a term that is referenced called
[30:04] situational awareness
[30:07] and it speaks to the ability to be aware
[30:10] of your surroundings
[30:12] the ability to be conscious of where you
[30:14] park
[30:16] how you're getting from point a to point
[30:17] b
[30:18] of observing your surroundings
[30:22] of
[30:23] not walking with your head buried in
[30:24] your cell phone because if your head
[30:26] buried in a cell phone you can't see the
[30:28] oncoming threat
[30:30] in that situation is not that you lack
[30:32] the ability to see it is because your
[30:34] forecast is elsewhere you cannot see
[30:37] what you should be seeing
[30:40] that's the danger of not understanding
[30:42] the power of the sense of sight and of
[30:45] seeing
[30:47] and if any natural the inability to see
[30:49] a threat because you are distracted by
[30:51] your mobile device
[30:55] how much more dangerous is it to not see
[30:59] a spiritual attack
[31:00] because you are focused on the wrong
[31:02] thing
[31:05] we talk about seeing red flags
[31:11] and and and it was plain to the eye to
[31:13] see
[31:15] what biases and history and desires and
[31:18] issues clouded judgment
[31:21] the power of seeing
[31:23] as i build tonight
[31:26] my bible study is a question
[31:28] do you have an eye problem
[31:32] does the bible study tonight
[31:34] do you have an i
[31:37] problem e y e i
[31:40] problem
[31:44] this issue of seeing enough sight and of
[31:46] having an eye problem goes back to
[31:48] genesis
[31:50] i'm not going to be too long with you
[31:51] food for thoughtful to encourage you
[31:55] in genesis 3 verse 6 the bible says and
[31:58] when the woman saw
[32:02] that the tree was good for food
[32:05] she saw that the tree was good for food
[32:08] what are you seeing tonight where
[32:11] what holds your attention what are you
[32:13] watching tonight
[32:15] what's attracting you tonight we're
[32:17] gonna build into something because
[32:19] the challenge today
[32:21] with people losing their love for the
[32:24] lord is because they're not looking at
[32:26] the lord when you're in love with
[32:29] something and it holds your attention
[32:30] that becomes the object of your focus
[32:33] your attention but but we spend more
[32:35] time on social media and on the news and
[32:39] on following other issues but when the
[32:41] woman saw in genesis 3 6
[32:44] that the tree was good for food and it
[32:47] was pleasant to the eyes
[32:49] oh yes pleasant to the eyes
[32:52] and a tree to be desired to make one
[32:55] wise she took of the fruit thereof and
[32:57] did it and gave also unto her husband
[33:00] with her and he did it
[33:02] the next verse
[33:04] and the eyes of them both were opened
[33:09] and they knew that they were naked and
[33:11] sowed fig leaves together and made
[33:13] themselves aprons
[33:17] friends are your eyes open are your eyes
[33:20] closed what's holding your attention
[33:21] when you go through scripture we
[33:23] remember the story of elisha when he was
[33:26] hearing the plans in the army of the
[33:28] syrians you remember that and he said
[33:30] open up this boy eyes because he
[33:32] couldn't see and when his eyes opened he
[33:34] could he could see that there were more
[33:36] for him than against him what are you
[33:39] looking at tonight
[33:40] do you have an eye
[33:43] problem
[33:45] we preach a message when you look
[33:48] what do you
[33:50] see this issue of seeing
[33:54] could impact your family
[33:57] could impact your life
[33:59] could impact your business
[34:01] could impact your marriage
[34:04] could impact your influence
[34:06] what you see what you do not see genesis
[34:09] 13
[34:11] verse 10
[34:12] and lot lifted up his eyes
[34:16] this is after the conversation with
[34:18] abraham and lot
[34:20] and beheld all the planes of jordan
[34:25] and it was well watered everywhere
[34:27] before the law destroyed saddam and
[34:29] gomorrah
[34:30] he allowed his eyes to judge
[34:34] even as the garden of the lord like the
[34:36] land of egypt as thou comest under zoa
[34:40] so when abraham say a lot lot is not
[34:42] good for our brethren and your president
[34:46] my bridge into beef and have issues and
[34:48] debate and argue it's a plenty enough
[34:50] land where you want to go
[34:52] lot didn't look with his heart he didn't
[34:54] look with his head he looked with his
[34:55] eyes
[34:57] and he looked at what was pleasing to
[34:59] him
[35:02] anybody with me tonight
[35:05] we said earlier that what you see could
[35:07] be a blessing it could be a curse your
[35:09] eyes can be a blessing it could be a
[35:10] curse
[35:13] genesis 13 14 and the lord said unto
[35:16] abraham
[35:18] after that lot was separated from him
[35:22] lift up now than eyes and look from the
[35:24] place where thou art northward and
[35:26] southward and eastward and westward and
[35:28] we know the scripture there so these
[35:30] same eyes can look at the same situation
[35:33] the same context and see something
[35:35] different
[35:37] i'm building into something not going to
[35:39] be too much longer
[35:40] matthew 5 29.
[35:45] if thy right eye offend thee
[35:49] pluck it out
[35:50] and cast it from v
[35:53] for it is profitable for thee that one
[35:56] of thy members should perish
[35:59] and not that thy whole body should be
[36:02] cast into hell
[36:04] i want to read that in the amplified
[36:07] if your right eye makes you stumble
[36:10] and leads you to sin
[36:13] tear it out and throw it away if that is
[36:16] remove yourself
[36:18] from the source of temptation
[36:20] for it is better for you to lose one of
[36:23] the parts of your body
[36:25] than for your whole body to be thrown
[36:28] into hell
[36:31] i'm building friends
[36:35] in the peak of job's response
[36:39] to the pressure that was upon him
[36:42] i believe i would have mentioned this
[36:43] when we studied job
[36:45] job in job 31
[36:48] job 31 is close to the end of the back
[36:50] and forth debate
[36:52] he said i made a covenant
[36:54] with mine eyes
[36:57] have you made a covenant with your eyes
[37:00] have you made an agreement with your
[37:02] eyes
[37:03] i don't want you to look at this lightly
[37:05] tonight friends
[37:07] because the root
[37:08] of what took place in genesis was the
[37:11] fruit looked good
[37:14] it was pleasing to the eye
[37:17] the eyes deceived eve
[37:19] anybody with me this evening
[37:22] so job is said i made a covenant with my
[37:25] eyes why then should i think upon a maid
[37:29] in the amplified
[37:31] it says i have made a covenant agreement
[37:33] with my eyes how then can i engage
[37:36] lustfully at a virgin
[37:41] now i want to get to
[37:45] maybe quality substantive part of my
[37:47] text tonight
[37:49] we're going to read from the book of
[37:50] judges and i'm going to start by just
[37:53] pulling out one verse first before i get
[37:55] into our substantive reading
[37:58] judges 17 verse 6
[38:01] and the bible says in those days there
[38:04] was no king in israel
[38:07] but every man
[38:09] did that which was right in his own eyes
[38:16] you imagine a situation where
[38:20] well it's the way i see him it is dire
[38:21] why moving
[38:23] that that's that then
[38:24] i see the way you've seen it so i'm
[38:26] doing what i want to do
[38:28] well daddy i seen it so you know
[38:30] well wi-fi i've seen it so you know well
[38:32] husband i have seen it so you know well
[38:33] both i seen it so
[38:35] and the bible says every man
[38:38] did that which was right in his own eyes
[38:41] now when something is right in your eyes
[38:43] you judging by your past your experience
[38:45] your mistake what your father tell you
[38:47] what you went through your experiences
[38:49] and you judging
[38:51] and the fact that the bible will make
[38:52] the distinction every man did that what
[38:56] was right in his own eyes that is a
[38:58] formula for this agreement is a formula
[39:00] of a conflict it's a formula for
[39:02] problems because what you might think is
[39:04] right i might think is right and what
[39:05] somebody else think is right there all
[39:07] of us looking from
[39:08] our own bias our own perspective and
[39:11] from our own eyes and making sense
[39:13] because you know you every one of your
[39:15] ideas makes sense to you
[39:17] every one of my ideas makes sense to me
[39:20] isn't that right
[39:22] something wrong with us if we don't
[39:24] think of our ideas making sense until we
[39:26] can admit when you opened our new
[39:28] perspective or you opened a new idea
[39:30] when you look back at your history your
[39:33] story what you have done at the point in
[39:36] time you did something you did it
[39:38] because you thought that was the best
[39:40] move at a point in time outside of that
[39:42] you wouldn't have done it
[39:44] there is no action that you would have
[39:46] ever taken that you didn't think at that
[39:48] particular point in time with your
[39:50] available information you had that that
[39:52] was the best move you can make am i
[39:54] right
[39:56] whether you buy a house you buy a car
[39:58] your rent you apply for a job
[40:01] based on all the available information
[40:03] that you had
[40:05] you made what you thought was the best
[40:08] decision
[40:09] hindsight you've got to look back and
[40:10] say you know what that was a good move
[40:12] you know that was real stripping this i
[40:14] really should not do that you could look
[40:16] back now because you have gone further
[40:18] down the road you have the benefit of
[40:21] having hindsight to see now a now that
[40:24] i've learned more i realized i should
[40:26] have thought about this differently
[40:30] imagine if the church
[40:32] everybody wanted to do what was right in
[40:33] their own eyes what kind of choice we'd
[40:35] have
[40:37] this usher want to do it this way this
[40:39] deacon what to do with this way the
[40:41] piano man playing in f you get a man
[40:43] playing in g because it's right in his
[40:44] own eyes
[40:46] the song leader are singing in e flat
[40:48] because they're right in his own eye
[40:50] and remember the parents singing in b
[40:52] so now everybody singing
[40:55] doing what they think is right in their
[40:57] own eyes because they're limiting it to
[40:59] their decision imagine if a company
[41:02] everybody did what they want
[41:05] what they thought was right in their own
[41:07] eyes
[41:09] friends you could only see what you're
[41:11] trained to see let me say that again
[41:13] we're gonna build into where we're going
[41:15] you can only see what you're trained to
[41:17] see
[41:19] that's why when a situation happened and
[41:21] they say well hey did he catch his
[41:22] number plate on the vehicle most people
[41:24] are trained to see the number plate
[41:26] but if it was a police man or a security
[41:28] professional they would tell you that
[41:30] was a number plate we got a train to
[41:32] pick up on these things
[41:33] so the ability to see is greater
[41:37] than somebody who is not trained to see
[41:38] it so the danger the problem of
[41:41] everybody
[41:42] doing what is right in their own eyes we
[41:45] are forever limited by our sight our
[41:49] experience what we did in school our own
[41:52] knowledge our limited understanding of
[41:54] scripture our limited understanding of
[41:56] the message because we are limited by
[41:58] our own eyes
[42:02] no wonder we could thank god for the
[42:03] seeing eyes of a prophet
[42:06] who could see beyond all of us
[42:09] and reach into the mind of god to put
[42:12] plainly before us how we should walk
[42:16] because outside of that we'll be walking
[42:17] all over the place
[42:19] anybody with me tonight
[42:22] what happens if in a home in a family
[42:25] everyone does what is right in their own
[42:27] eyes
[42:32] isn't there a head of the home
[42:35] oh yes
[42:38] isn't there somebody supposed to have
[42:40] vision beyond everybody else to chat at
[42:42] destiny like a ship
[42:47] you rolling forward somebody has ruined
[42:48] backwards somebody you both will go
[42:50] nowhere
[42:52] or they're exercising that's that's what
[42:54] you're doing because you row in forward
[42:56] she run backwards his son ruined the
[42:58] right and the daughter ruined the left
[43:01] water just splashing this boat going
[43:03] nowhere because everybody doing what is
[43:06] right in their own eyes
[43:08] there must be leadership spiritual
[43:11] leadership there must be a vision no
[43:13] wonder the bible says without a vision
[43:15] people perish anybody with me tonight is
[43:17] this helping anybody
[43:19] what we're trying to do is see something
[43:21] different and more than that to not fall
[43:24] into the trap of our limited vision
[43:29] so we in the book of judges
[43:34] i want to know
[43:35] rewind a little bit to judges 13 that's
[43:38] the lair foundation because i know many
[43:40] would not have spent time reading it
[43:42] we're going to read this chapter in just
[43:43] a few points and then we're going to
[43:45] close out as we bring this home
[43:48] so do you have an eye
[43:51] problem are you looking at what you
[43:53] should not be looking at
[43:55] are you not seeing what you're supposed
[43:58] to be seeing aren't you seeing that
[44:01] what's happening in your job could
[44:03] destroy you aren't you seeing that
[44:06] you're missing church for the wrong
[44:08] reason is destroying your walk with god
[44:10] aren't you seeing the attack on your
[44:12] family
[44:15] let's go georges 13 and verse one
[44:20] and the children of israel did evil
[44:22] again in the sight of the lord
[44:24] again seeing right in the sight of the
[44:26] lord
[44:28] they don't even conscious that god is
[44:30] looking i want us to see it from two
[44:31] perspectives here
[44:33] and the children visit their evil again
[44:37] throughout this entire book of judges we
[44:39] see a repeated cycle
[44:41] of
[44:42] redemption and judgment and redemption
[44:45] and judgment because between judgment
[44:47] and redemption
[44:50] you have the people doing what they want
[44:52] to do
[44:53] what is right in their own eyes and god
[44:55] having to step in and address the
[44:56] situation
[44:58] and the children visited evil again in
[45:00] the sight of the lord
[45:02] and the lord delivered them into the
[45:04] hand of the philistines 40 years
[45:08] to discipline them i want us to
[45:10] appreciate the fact that god is just he
[45:12] is fair he is to his word you love him
[45:15] you abide by his word you follow his
[45:17] word your followers commandments he said
[45:19] if you love me keep my commandments
[45:21] there's no rocket science in this these
[45:23] are principles
[45:24] there's blessing that is attached to
[45:26] that you walk away from that road and
[45:28] choose your own road and do what is
[45:30] right in your own eyes there are
[45:32] consequences
[45:34] god could forgive you now now now and
[45:36] still deal with consequences i want us
[45:38] to appreciate that point
[45:41] because there are consequences it
[45:42] doesn't mean he doesn't love you
[45:44] but it's just because his law is written
[45:46] a certain way there has to be
[45:48] consequences when you step outside of
[45:50] god's word
[45:52] so this should be an encouragement to us
[45:54] it should be a warning to us it should
[45:56] be a reminder to us still in verse 1 and
[45:58] the lord delivered them into the hand of
[46:01] the philistines 40 years
[46:04] and there was a certain man
[46:06] of zorah of the family of the danites
[46:08] the house of dhan a tribe of man whose
[46:11] name was manoa
[46:13] and his wife was barren
[46:15] and bear not
[46:17] she was barren had no children
[46:19] verse 3 and the angel of the lord
[46:22] appeared unto the woman
[46:24] and said unto her behold now thou art
[46:27] barren and bearest not
[46:29] but thou shalt conceive
[46:31] and bear a son
[46:33] what an encouragement to a woman who is
[46:36] barren
[46:37] what an encouragement to a woman who
[46:39] undoubtedly may go through the emotional
[46:42] turmoil of wondering about her state has
[46:44] status a situation and to get a word and
[46:47] the right word at the right time to give
[46:49] her comfort
[46:51] verse 4
[46:52] but with that word of comfort comes the
[46:55] admonition comes the warning comes the
[46:58] playbook the guide the way to live to
[47:01] see this thing unfold i want us to
[47:03] appreciate that spiritual success
[47:05] natural success is based on principles
[47:08] here the angel not only says you're
[47:10] going to have this or not but
[47:13] verse 4 now therefore beware
[47:17] now i don't want to understand or have
[47:20] to deal with the consequences of feeling
[47:22] to beware the promise is given but the
[47:25] angel is saying listen there's there's
[47:27] some stuff you have to do
[47:30] there's a value to be in bible study
[47:32] there's a value to be in service on
[47:34] wednesday night on the stream there's a
[47:36] value to prayer meeting there's a value
[47:38] to being in service on a sunday
[47:40] because there's something about your
[47:42] principles of your life and here it is
[47:44] now therefore be where i pray thee and
[47:46] drink not wine
[47:48] nor strong drink and eat not any unclean
[47:52] thing
[47:53] for lo thou shall conceive
[47:56] and bear a son
[47:58] and no razor shall come on his head
[48:00] for the child shall be a nazirite unto
[48:04] god from the womb
[48:07] and he shall begin
[48:09] on the line begin to deliver israel out
[48:12] of the hand
[48:13] of the philistines
[48:15] what a powerful scripture and a context
[48:18] so this woman who is barren who has
[48:20] borne no children is given a promise and
[48:23] is also given a rule book a guide a
[48:26] structure of which to live what to eat
[48:28] what not to eat how to move not
[48:31] you you understand this
[48:33] you understand why when you have a
[48:35] promise from god it's not just a promise
[48:37] and it just will happen just so
[48:40] god has his path and we have our part
[48:42] this is to remind us tonight
[48:46] verse six then the woman came and told
[48:49] her husband saying a man of god came
[48:51] unto me
[48:53] and his countenance was like the
[48:56] countenance of an angel of god very
[48:59] terrible but i asked him not whence he
[49:01] was i didn't ask him where he come from
[49:04] neither told me his name he didn't tell
[49:06] me who he was but he said unto me behold
[49:09] thou shalt conceive and bear son and now
[49:12] drink no wine nor strong drink neither
[49:16] eat any unclean thing for the child
[49:18] shall be a nazarite to god from the womb
[49:21] to the day of his death
[49:23] then manoa entreated the lord begged the
[49:26] lord plead to the lord and said o my
[49:28] lord let the man of god
[49:31] which doubted their sin come again unto
[49:34] us
[49:35] look at this prayer friends
[49:37] parents i want you to note this
[49:40] young people in the lord terrorists who
[49:42] will become parents i want you to note
[49:44] this particular prayer
[49:48] i want to read it again then menoah
[49:50] entreated the lord in treat is a deep
[49:52] word it is beyond us it is deeper than
[49:55] ask
[49:57] intrigue connotes pleading begging is a
[50:00] level of suffocation it's not asking a
[50:03] light request
[50:04] then manoa entreated the lord and said
[50:06] oh my lord let the man of god which thou
[50:10] did ascend come again unto us
[50:12] and listen
[50:14] teach us
[50:16] if you have a physical bible underline
[50:18] it using an app highlight it teach us
[50:22] what we shall do unto the child that
[50:25] shall be born
[50:28] parents have you ever prayed for god to
[50:30] teach you how to raise your children
[50:32] or the play book you're using is your
[50:34] father playbook or your grandfather
[50:36] playbook or your grandmother playbook or
[50:38] some book that you read here it is
[50:41] and and the desire to be taught
[50:45] is is deeply connected to the fact that
[50:48] manoa and his wife didn't expect any
[50:50] children
[50:51] she was barren
[50:55] how much care and attention you would
[50:58] give to something when you didn't expect
[51:00] it
[51:02] manoa wasn't taking chances he didn't
[51:04] want to raise this child like any other
[51:07] kind of child because
[51:09] this was not supposed to happen
[51:12] he had been living with this barren
[51:13] woman for some time and grace and favor
[51:16] came to him and he didn't want to leave
[51:18] him and say lord send back the man of
[51:20] god so he could show me how to raise
[51:22] this child
[51:25] that shall be born
[51:28] and that prayer connected to god because
[51:31] in verse 9 and god hearkened to the
[51:34] voice of manoa
[51:36] because that request was such a noble
[51:38] request god or not that request anybody
[51:41] with me tonight
[51:44] i don't care what situation you have
[51:46] with your children tonight
[51:48] god can still teach you how to speak
[51:50] with them teach you how to deal with
[51:52] them teach you how to connect with them
[51:55] teach you how to guide them you have to
[51:56] believe it have you entreated the lord
[52:02] and god hearkened to the voice of the
[52:04] noah and the angel of the lord came
[52:06] again unto the woman as she sat in the
[52:09] field but once again manoa her husband
[52:12] was not with her
[52:14] and the woman made haste and ran and
[52:17] showed her husband and said unto him be
[52:18] all the man had appeared unto me that
[52:21] came unto me the other day and manoa
[52:24] arose and went after his wife and came
[52:27] to the man and said unto him i doubt the
[52:29] man that speaketh unto the woman
[52:32] and he said i am
[52:34] and manoa said now let thy words come to
[52:37] pass
[52:38] look at this question friends
[52:40] how shall we order the child
[52:43] how shall we command the child how shall
[52:46] we train the child because if there's no
[52:49] order
[52:50] anybody with me tonight
[52:53] god help us have parents who looking for
[52:56] order looking for the right way the
[52:58] right approach
[53:02] god directed parenthood
[53:04] parenting
[53:06] how shall we order the child and how
[53:09] shall we do unto him
[53:16] and the age of the lord said unto manoa
[53:18] of all that i said unto the woman let
[53:21] her beware
[53:23] she may not eat up anything that comment
[53:25] of the vine
[53:27] neither let her drink wine or strong
[53:30] drink
[53:31] nor eat any unclean thing all that i
[53:34] commanded her let her
[53:36] observe
[53:39] verse 15
[53:41] and manoa said unto the angel of the
[53:43] lord i pray thee let us detain thee let
[53:47] us keep thee until we shall have made
[53:49] ready a kid for thee
[53:51] they were the killer animal a young
[53:52] animal and prepared for him
[53:54] and the age of the lord said unto manoah
[53:57] though thou retained me
[53:59] i will not eat of thy bread
[54:02] and if thou will offer a burnt offering
[54:04] thou must offer it unto the lord
[54:07] in other words i am not here for the
[54:09] worship no glory nothing it is between
[54:11] you and the lord
[54:13] and manoa said unto the angel of the
[54:15] lord what is thy name
[54:17] that when thy sayings come to pass we
[54:20] may do the honor
[54:23] and the angel of the lord said unto him
[54:25] why ask your thou thus after my name
[54:28] seeing it is secret
[54:31] you see how a true angel of the lord
[54:33] speaks
[54:37] so manoa took a kid with a meat offering
[54:39] and offered it upon a rock unto the lord
[54:42] and the angel did wondrously and manoa
[54:45] and his wife looked on now notice to
[54:48] this point they thought it was a man of
[54:50] god they didn't realize it was an angel
[54:55] and manoa and his wife looked on verse
[54:57] 24 it came to pass when the flame went
[55:00] up toward heaven from off the altar that
[55:02] the angel of the lord ascended my lord
[55:05] in the flame of the altar
[55:07] and manoa and his wife looked on it and
[55:10] fell on their thesis to the ground
[55:13] but the angel of the lord did no more
[55:15] appear to manoa and to his wife then
[55:17] manoa knew that he was an angel of the
[55:20] lord
[55:21] and manoa said unto his wife we shall
[55:23] surely die because we have seen god
[55:27] but his wife
[55:28] said unto him if the lord were pleased
[55:31] to kill us
[55:32] he would not have received a burnt
[55:34] offering and a meat offering at our
[55:36] hands
[55:37] neither would he have showed us all
[55:40] these things
[55:41] nor would us at this time have told us
[55:44] such things as these
[55:46] and a woman bear a son
[55:48] and called his name samson
[55:51] and the child grew
[55:53] and the lord blessed him
[55:56] and the spirit of the lord began to move
[55:58] him at times in the camp of dan
[56:01] between zorra and astral
[56:04] everybody feeling fine
[56:06] go into the next verse verse 14.
[56:13] and samson went down to tim nut
[56:16] and saw
[56:18] i want this on the line the word saw
[56:21] a woman
[56:23] in tim nut
[56:25] of the daughters of the philistines
[56:28] do you have an eye problem
[56:33] grew up in a good home
[56:36] grew up in a message house
[56:40] anybody with me tonight
[56:42] young people are coming for you tonight
[56:45] parents praying
[56:47] not just praying they're asking the lord
[56:49] how to order
[56:51] how to teach how to train how to guide
[56:57] but samson have his own
[56:59] eyes
[57:02] do you have an eye problem
[57:08] when he saw
[57:09] this
[57:10] girl in tim nut
[57:14] the parents were not there
[57:17] mama wasn't there
[57:19] papa wasn't there
[57:20] because verse 2 says he came and told
[57:23] them
[57:24] what he saw
[57:26] so let me just go back to verse one and
[57:28] kind of
[57:29] dig up in this thing a little bit
[57:32] your own eyes
[57:35] eyes in your school eyes on your job
[57:38] eyes in your university eyes with your
[57:41] friends
[57:42] look at this
[57:44] you see that girl
[57:45] you see this game you see this website
[57:48] you see this xyz whatever it is
[57:51] you have your eyes do you have an eye
[57:54] problem
[57:57] do you realize that your eyes
[58:00] could be leading you down a road
[58:02] that when you come to church you have
[58:04] such condemnation you have such issues
[58:07] you have such problems because your eyes
[58:10] jesus is like a lamp
[58:14] if you're taking the wrong thing you
[58:16] darken your whole life or you can
[58:18] lighten your life tonight
[58:21] just reading these words and scripture
[58:23] you are rewriting your story tonight or
[58:26] you don't hear me tonight
[58:28] just reading these words of eternal life
[58:30] you are rewriting your story
[58:34] do you know the damage all that time on
[58:36] social media and all this stuff does to
[58:38] your spiritual work
[58:42] i don't want to belabor it but you know
[58:44] what i'm talking about
[58:46] so let's go
[58:48] not going to be too much longer and
[58:50] samson went down to tim that and saw a
[58:52] woman in tim that of the daughters of
[58:55] the philistines
[58:56] and he came up and told his father and
[58:59] his mother and said i have seen a woman
[59:02] in tim
[59:03] of the daughters of the philistines now
[59:06] dear forget her for me to wife
[59:14] verse 3.
[59:18] and i won in the church tonight
[59:20] after we do this bible study
[59:22] one there's no excuse but two this is
[59:25] releasing clarity blessing and also
[59:28] judgment
[59:30] because the word of the lord is clear
[59:32] and sharp
[59:36] then his father and his mother sent him
[59:38] is there never a woman among the
[59:40] daughters of thy brethren or among all
[59:43] thy people that don't go as to take a
[59:46] wife of the uncircumcised philistines
[59:50] so hear me and hear me well tonight
[59:52] church
[59:55] there is no excuse
[59:57] there is no point suggestion
[59:59] recommendation you could ever make to
[1:00:01] underscore
[1:00:03] marrying somebody from the world
[1:00:08] and shame on you parents who support it
[1:00:19] there's a direct quote from the prophet
[1:00:21] under no circumstances the believer
[1:00:23] married an unbeliever
[1:00:25] it's for your
[1:00:26] protection it's to help you
[1:00:29] anybody with me this evening
[1:00:33] so look at the question
[1:00:34] there is
[1:00:38] something
[1:00:39] i say
[1:00:40] i know what my bible say
[1:00:44] is there never a woman among the
[1:00:45] daughters of thy bridging or among all
[1:00:47] my people
[1:00:49] that dog goes to like a wife of the
[1:00:51] uncircumcised philistines
[1:00:53] and samson said unto his father
[1:00:58] get her for me for she pleased at me
[1:01:00] well i want to read that in the
[1:01:02] amplified
[1:01:04] that was three
[1:01:06] but his father and mother said to him is
[1:01:09] there no woman among the daughters of
[1:01:10] your relatives
[1:01:13] who believe what you believe
[1:01:15] worship the way you worship
[1:01:18] or among all of our people
[1:01:21] that you must go take a wife from the
[1:01:23] uncircumcised pagan philistine and
[1:01:26] samson said to his father get her for me
[1:01:29] because she looks pleasing to me
[1:01:34] that is the amplified
[1:01:36] so
[1:01:37] samson wasn't judging her by character
[1:01:41] he wasn't judging her by her values
[1:01:44] he wasn't judging her by her beliefs her
[1:01:47] interests her dreams her desires her
[1:01:50] focus her ambition what she was reading
[1:01:53] what her plans were what she wanted to
[1:01:55] achieve in life it was purely based on
[1:01:57] look
[1:02:00] anybody with me
[1:02:03] young brothers brothers in general
[1:02:07] sisters whoever it is
[1:02:09] what are you judging
[1:02:17] i'll skip a bit this is a lot of food
[1:02:20] for thought
[1:02:22] some people will eat it
[1:02:23] some people will say boys this food
[1:02:27] tasting
[1:02:28] jason boy oh gosh too much too much salt
[1:02:32] too much seasoning too much
[1:02:34] why i cook something gentle
[1:02:39] i want to skip down to verse seven
[1:02:42] and he went down and talked with the
[1:02:44] woman so no this is after the parents so
[1:02:47] listen i have to give credit to the
[1:02:49] parents
[1:02:50] for trying to tell samson this boy the
[1:02:53] right thing you know
[1:03:03] verse seven he went down and talked and
[1:03:05] she pleased samson well
[1:03:07] in the amplified it says she looked
[1:03:09] pleasing to samson
[1:03:17] between the verse we read verse three
[1:03:20] and verse seven verse six says and the
[1:03:22] spirit of the lord came mightily upon
[1:03:24] him and you rent him as he would have
[1:03:26] rent a kid and he had nothing in his
[1:03:28] hand but he told his father or his
[1:03:30] mother what he had done this is a lion
[1:03:32] you rip the lion so i just want to say
[1:03:34] quickly here between these two
[1:03:36] scriptures
[1:03:37] of
[1:03:38] georges 14 verse 3 and judges 14 verse 7
[1:03:43] judges 14 verse 6 right there
[1:03:46] highlights
[1:03:48] between his weakness and his eye problem
[1:03:53] the physical strength and the blessing
[1:03:55] that god gave
[1:03:58] but his weakness
[1:04:00] would be his undoing his eye problem
[1:04:03] will be his undoing i'm almost finished
[1:04:05] short lesson tonight just starting back
[1:04:07] bible study
[1:04:08] with lead ultimately to judges 16.
[1:04:13] where once again his eyes would lead him
[1:04:16] to another woman
[1:04:18] named delilah
[1:04:21] that would ultimately lead to his eyes
[1:04:26] coming out
[1:04:28] i wonder why god would allow out of all
[1:04:30] the punishments
[1:04:32] that the philistine would put samson
[1:04:34] through
[1:04:35] it would be that his eyes had to come
[1:04:37] out
[1:04:39] because when you really understand what
[1:04:41] was samson downfall it was his eyes
[1:04:46] by taking out samson eyes the problem of
[1:04:49] his eyesight
[1:04:51] and this woman he was looking at i
[1:04:53] didn't read it but between there he went
[1:04:54] after a prostitute to look good too
[1:04:58] his eyes was his weakness
[1:05:02] church
[1:05:03] do you have an eye problem
[1:05:05] are you guarding your eyes
[1:05:08] do you need to lose your eye like samson
[1:05:11] for you to understand that you need to
[1:05:14] make a covenant with your eyes like job
[1:05:16] oh my help me tonight
[1:05:18] job made an agreement with his eye he
[1:05:20] sent a contract with his eyes
[1:05:23] that he would lust
[1:05:27] jesus said pluck out your eye if you
[1:05:29] give any trouble and by pluck out you
[1:05:31] say take yourself out of the situation
[1:05:34] of temptation i don't know who this is
[1:05:35] for tonight
[1:05:38] but i pray whatever shackle holding you
[1:05:40] down
[1:05:42] will be broken tonight by the word
[1:05:45] so you could be free to worship without
[1:05:48] condemnation
[1:05:50] and make an agreement a covenant to
[1:05:52] bring your body under subjection of the
[1:05:55] word
[1:05:56] brother preach it on sunday a man that
[1:05:58] is clean
[1:06:00] waters of separation the red heifer god
[1:06:03] is calling for a clean walk a clean talk
[1:06:06] a clean life clean hands clean words
[1:06:09] dishonest they will say creating me a
[1:06:11] clean heart
[1:06:14] renew our right spirit within me
[1:06:20] covenant with your eyes church
[1:06:25] let's bring this message home tonight
[1:06:42] let's go down to verse 21 in judges 16.
[1:06:49] but the philistines took him
[1:06:52] this is after his eyes
[1:06:55] let him
[1:06:56] away from the sisters in church
[1:06:59] his eyes led him away from what his
[1:07:02] parents had prayed for
[1:07:04] his eyes led him away from the truth he
[1:07:07] grew up with
[1:07:08] his eyes led him from the reality he had
[1:07:11] known
[1:07:12] his eyes led him away from the fact that
[1:07:14] he was a miracle baby and should never
[1:07:16] have existed had it not been the angel
[1:07:19] of the lord had come and visited his
[1:07:20] mama
[1:07:26] but the philistines
[1:07:28] took him
[1:07:30] and put out his eyes
[1:07:32] and brought him down to gaza and bound
[1:07:35] him at fetters of brass and he did grind
[1:07:38] in the prison house
[1:07:40] how beard the heel of his head began to
[1:07:42] grow again after he was shaven
[1:07:45] then the lords
[1:07:46] of the philistines gathered them
[1:07:48] together for to offer a sacrifice unto
[1:07:51] diego and their god and to rejoice
[1:07:53] for they said
[1:07:55] our god had delivered samson our enemy
[1:07:58] into our hand what an embarrassment
[1:08:02] and when the people saw him they praised
[1:08:05] their god for they said our god are
[1:08:08] delivered into our hands our enemy and
[1:08:10] the destroyer of our country which slew
[1:08:13] many of us
[1:08:14] and it came to pass when their hearts
[1:08:16] were married that they said call for
[1:08:18] samson that he may make a sport
[1:08:22] and they called for samson out of the
[1:08:24] prison house
[1:08:26] and he made them sport and they set him
[1:08:28] between the pillars
[1:08:29] and samson said unto the lad that held
[1:08:32] him by the hand suffer me that i may
[1:08:34] feel the pillars whereupon the house
[1:08:36] stand it that i may lean upon them
[1:08:40] now the house was full of men and women
[1:08:41] and all the lords and the philistines
[1:08:43] were there
[1:08:45] and they were upon the roof about three
[1:08:47] thousand men and women that be held
[1:08:50] while samson made sport
[1:08:53] and samson called unto the lord and said
[1:08:56] oh lord god remember me
[1:08:58] i pray thee
[1:09:00] and strengthen me i pray thee
[1:09:03] only this once
[1:09:06] oh god that i may at once avenge of the
[1:09:10] philistines
[1:09:11] for my two eyes
[1:09:14] and samson took hold of the two pillars
[1:09:17] upon which the house stood and on which
[1:09:20] it was born up of the one with his right
[1:09:22] hand and the other with his left
[1:09:25] and samson said let me die with the
[1:09:27] philistines and he bowed himself with
[1:09:30] all his might and the house fell upon
[1:09:32] the lords and upon all the people that
[1:09:34] were therein
[1:09:36] so the dead which he slew at his death
[1:09:39] were more than they which he slew in his
[1:09:41] life
[1:09:47] i'm getting ready to close out
[1:09:54] in speaking on this and we have preached
[1:09:56] on this many times and speaking about
[1:09:58] once more lord
[1:10:01] and i just love the way
[1:10:03] the prophet brought it out
[1:10:05] that although
[1:10:06] samson lost his physical eyes
[1:10:10] he could still see
[1:10:13] and he could see
[1:10:14] the possibility
[1:10:20] i want to encourage you tonight
[1:10:22] mother father son daughter backslider
[1:10:25] strong believer can you see
[1:10:28] the possibility night tonight of a
[1:10:31] greater walk
[1:10:32] can you see the possibility tonight of
[1:10:35] our greater talk can you see the
[1:10:37] possibility tonight
[1:10:39] of a revival
[1:10:45] brother branham in this message once
[1:10:47] more i just want to close out with these
[1:10:48] quotes
[1:10:52] he said all the time
[1:10:54] while they were all standing there he's
[1:10:55] talking about that last scene and these
[1:10:58] thoughts was going through their minds
[1:11:03] i hope it sends some through yours
[1:11:08] especially if you have an eye problem
[1:11:13] they never noticed
[1:11:16] while samson
[1:11:18] his thoughts went through his mind
[1:11:24] maybe they passed the bottle took a
[1:11:26] drink again
[1:11:27] they find hollywood women stood there
[1:11:30] with their cigarettes in their mouth if
[1:11:31] it was such a thing in that day
[1:11:33] i don't think they got quite that low in
[1:11:35] that day but pushed up their hay and
[1:11:37] took another drink
[1:11:40] while all that is going on
[1:11:43] and while he taught the philistines had
[1:11:45] not noticed him this little boy had
[1:11:47] untied his hands walked back he said lay
[1:11:49] my hands upon the post there's a
[1:11:51] possibility
[1:11:52] i wish the church could see that
[1:11:54] there's a possibility of a real revival
[1:11:58] what did he do he raised up his sockets
[1:12:01] he had no eyes towards god
[1:12:05] and you know what i'm saying sometimes
[1:12:06] if love to get it that's pretty
[1:12:08] conditions will
[1:12:12] if you can't
[1:12:13] get your act together
[1:12:15] your soul is more important
[1:12:17] so important to god in fact that if you
[1:12:19] have to put you in a situation that you
[1:12:21] don't like to get your back into the
[1:12:23] house of god you do it
[1:12:26] that's what love will do
[1:12:29] he raised up his sockets towards god i'm
[1:12:32] about to close they never noticed the
[1:12:34] moving of his lips as he was sincerely
[1:12:36] confessing
[1:12:39] we don't need just a little lord forgive
[1:12:41] me
[1:12:42] we need a sincere cleaning up from the
[1:12:45] pulpit of the janitor
[1:12:47] they never noticed
[1:12:48] the tears running down from them sockets
[1:12:51] when he once had eyes
[1:12:53] they never noticed the moving of his
[1:12:55] lips his eyes briny tears streaming down
[1:12:58] from the sockets he wanted god to make
[1:13:01] his word once more vindicated
[1:13:05] to prove jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:13:08] today and forever
[1:13:11] once more he thought
[1:13:13] not a new denomination not a new
[1:13:15] sectarian but a vindicated word from you
[1:13:18] god i know you are still god i'm blind
[1:13:20] i've got off the track i'm not worthy to
[1:13:23] live let me die with this enemy you
[1:13:25] raise me up to destroy it and i failed
[1:13:28] you lord
[1:13:29] but there's a possibility you'd hear me
[1:13:31] once more lord once more in dead earnest
[1:13:34] he prayed he knew what was coming lord
[1:13:37] just once more
[1:13:39] once more let me see jesus christ as he
[1:13:42] was yesterday
[1:13:45] that's what the church needs confess
[1:13:47] you're wrong
[1:13:50] if you're out of the word of god confess
[1:13:52] it that you're wrong cry out once more
[1:13:54] lord once more once more lord once more
[1:13:57] avenge my blindness
[1:13:59] and give me strength
[1:14:03] he knew what was going to happen if his
[1:14:05] prayer was answered do you know what
[1:14:06] will happen if your prayer is answered
[1:14:08] tonight your prayer for your house your
[1:14:11] prayer for your family your prayer for
[1:14:13] the holy ghost
[1:14:14] you allow your eyes to be distracted by
[1:14:16] the world and missing the reality that
[1:14:19] the devil was creeping into your home
[1:14:21] but tonight tonight tonight tonight
[1:14:25] may god remove the scale of spiritual
[1:14:28] blindness
[1:14:30] oh god if the body of jesus christ i'm
[1:14:32] reading the same quote
[1:14:34] could stand as one and every fiber and
[1:14:37] every member begin to vibrate with the
[1:14:39] literal baptism of the holy ghost again
[1:14:42] not with new members and shaken hands
[1:14:44] and some creed as a strength began to
[1:14:46] move into those muscles every fiber
[1:14:49] began to twist he began to feel himself
[1:14:51] again
[1:14:52] feel the presence again feel the power
[1:14:54] again feel the anointing again
[1:14:59] and when he did the big wall fell all we
[1:15:02] need to do today see these
[1:15:03] denominational walls fall is to get
[1:15:06] deeply sincere before god to heal these
[1:15:09] blinded eyes that's been blinded from
