name of our Lord Jesus Christ certainly thank you pastor for the opportunity to speak and I like to get straight to the word this evening if you have your Bibles will you turn with me to two portions of scripture reading Zechariah for and reading second Kings chapter two you're going to start with second Kings chapter 2 i'm going to read from verse 9 when you have it's a man and it came to pass when they were going over that elijah said unto Elijah asked what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee and Elijah said I pray thee let a double portion of the spirit be upon me and he said that was asked a hard thing nevertheless if though see me when I'm taking from thee it shall be so unto thee for if not it shall not be so and it came to pass as they still went on and talked at behold they appeared a chariot of fire and horses a fire and parted them both asunder and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven and he likes a sword and he cried my father my father the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took whole of his own clothes and ran them in two pieces and he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smooth the waters and said where is the Lord God of Elijah and when he also had smitten the waters departed hither and thither and he'll I Shah went over and let us go to the book of Zechariah for and reading from verse 4 so I answered and speak to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord and then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me know as thou not what these be and I said no my lord then he answered and speak unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel seeing not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of Hosts shall we bar has four wheeler frame Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for being in your house once again we thank you for being in your presence because in your presence is fullness of joy and Lord go we are needy people tonight father come from the east from the west from the north from the south father come from different backgrounds from different occupation from different homes from different situations different challenges different trials Lord but we come father under one covering tonight a covering of the blood of Jesus Christ I was shed on calorie low that that blood covers us all tonight and that blood unites us tonight and father if we know that tonight is one Lord is one thing as one baptism and and lower United fear tonight on the expectation for the prophets prophesy to be made manifest Lord we have lived for many years under the Ministry of the word now God as we switch to the Ministry of the Spirit may you walk out the pages of the Bible and for the next few minutes father may spirit spoken words come from the desk here tonight Lord let lies be changed if there's anyone backslidden tonight may there be restored tonight if there's anyone still sick father because we know Lillian healing virtue when for this morning but it has anyone still sick Lord Lord may they be touch here tonight if there's anyone desiring the baptism of the Holy Ghost may they be filled with a baptism of the Holy Ghost on fire if there's anyone tired tonight maybe be given strength is there anyone weary tonight maybe encourage anyone depressed tonight may you lift them up anyone feeling down tonight may you raise them up anyone feeling discouraged tonight may you pour charity the capstone of love father me you move among your people tonight and may you confirm your word with signs wonders a miracle in the precious name of Jesus Christ and the church says and the church says amen and amen you may be seated this evening a man when I'm not going to be too long with us as our communion communion evening service so just for a few words encourage your fear this evening hallelujah so he can grow from strength to strength because every day with Jesus should be sweeter than the day before every day with Jesus we should love him more and more and I was saying in the prayer meeting that we had that the devil's tactics are just to distract us everything around us is to just distract us from keeping our focus on what we are born to do the job is designed to distract you it's one thing to have to make money to live but there comes a point where it becomes a distraction from your purpose and you have to become vigilant with protecting your purpose above all else you have to protect your purpose because your purpose is not somebody else's professor you can't expect your neighbor to watch out for your purpose you can't expect your father to look out for your purpose your natural mother she's not gonna help you with your purpose because your purpose come from God and I come from Gordon I'm going back to God so I want to be Purpose Driven I want to be focused on where I'm going this evening and I want to encourage you we are going somewhere this evening we are under expectation this evening I don't know what you came to do this evening but I'm on the expectation because if you have expectation it makes you for something a certain way if you don't expect you may be seated if you walk into church if you come to the service and you don't know what you come for then you'll accept anything but if you come looking for something specific then you know that you're going to position yourself that I come for that specific purpose and I'm not going to move I'm not going to turn to the left I'm not going to turn to the right the Deacons wouldn't have to carry me out because I'm not leaving until I get what I came for somebody helped me to see you then I'm not going to be too long with you but I want you to leave encourage this evening to know who you are to know who God is to know who the devil is up so you might be tired of seeing them but for a few minutes are gonna push back the tiredness sir we're gonna push back to wearing it we're gonna push back last week we're gonna push back last month we're gonna push back what people said about you and and what happened

seated so my title for the next few minutes the manifestation of God to stir the bride and my subject where is the Lord God of Elijah we have been in the message for many many years and we know that Malachi 4 was that Elijah to us but where is the Lord God of Elijah we have the books we have the tapes we have the scriptures but where is the Lord God of Elijah where is the God who wrote the word where is the God who prophesied there will be a bride where is the god of Elijah hallelujah hallelujah coroner cup how are you maybe see it if you can my inspiration my inspiration this evening as I was but Malachi 4 saw shall I be with them the same angel that was with the prophet as I was with malachi form so will I be with deep the same power the same angel the one with the swept-back wings up that flew into him as I was with malachi for so shall i meet with here with you with you hallelujah glory to God give the Lord a shout out praise in this anointing you are getting filled somebody's

he died for the Mystics you will make up we were under the 700 block tonight you are under the seventh under plots an item I'm the Holy Ghost shop he's riding in right now he is riding in right now to put a marker upon those who sigh and cry to put the marker and go to ask him where is the Lord God of Elijah where is the girl who wrote the word let that God come for tonight hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated I'm not gonna be too long with you but I gotta say something just a little thing here there hallelujah but over read this Court I believe on thursday from a message making the valley full of ditches keep the fire going this a couple more minutes this is not going to be long this is one of those inoculation but the branham use the word inoculation one of those quick inoculations he said they went to the upper room and they got the same inoculations that Jesus had to go when Jesus died and he rose again and the disciples went into the upper room to get the same type of inoculation so that if you die you're gonna raise up again that's a kind of inoculation we want so we came to church this evening to get a spiritual inoculation an inoculation against out against fear against unbelief against gossip against black biting against evil surmise him against fornication against adultery against loss against witchcraft against pornography against you however you may be seated hallelujah but I ran him in a message making the valley full of ditches he said the only way you're ever gonna see your way out is anybody here this evening who wants to see their way out of whatever you're in you want to see your way out there is there is there is too much talk in the message this quote that quote who said this foolishness nonsense the only we're gonna see your way out of it's an old-fashioned spiritual revival where the Hallelujah zuv God is ringing in the bottom of your heart somebody helped me preacher and the holy ghost tent revival hits the place that's what I'm looking for for a revival in this church I can't speak for any other church but this church this is my church this is my judge I'm in this church up for this church I want to do what I can do to see a 7-ton the Reviver breakwater is there anybody here who wants to help me bring a revival is there anybody in the church tonight who was supriya revival hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah toreador God you should stop smiling you said stop smiling just stop smiling let them wonder why you're smiling and if they ask you tell them I'm being delivered I'm being delivered I'm being set free I haven't smiled in a long time but I'm practicing because weeping may endure for a night but joy comes in the morning I'm there's a joy coming there's a joy coming there's a joy coming there's a piece coming my brother is coming my sister is coming my basset neighbors coming with my eyes shocked you may be seated hallelujah a revival that's what I'm looking for but a brand I'm Sarah I revival doesn't bring new members a revival turns up what's inside a church it true the trash out the church it brings alive what's sitting get in the church that's what we need are a revived up the stir of the church you may be seated a revival it means freedom it means restoration it means Redemption this revival is not like other revivals up hallelujah I'm supposed to get to the core later on but right now the Holy Spirit has already taken over so i might as well read it now so you know i got it from you know the coat Lord help me Lord help me Lord help me Oh keep the motor humming hallelujah we may not get to communion tonight hallelujah hallelujah this is the old fashioned send killing sky-blue Holy Ghost revival hallelujah where you can't sit down you can steer still you just leave church jumping people don't even notice he you on the sheet and and there's a disjoint there's a movement is a old fashioned gospel old-fashioned Holy Ghost it's that old fashioned sky-blue sin killing Holy Ghost revival that's what they need up that's what we need hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah my God my God hallelujah from the message of third seal butter Branham said no that's the reason today the revivals we're supposed to have he said we have the number national revival so he say oh that's a grown-ass denomination revival we haven't had a real stirring we are never real story no sub he in fact he says it multiple times have no no no no no sir we have another real Sturm so you me in 1983 you mean all the great 1993 you mean all that God has already done still hasn't been the real stirring you said the brighter hasn't had a revival yet maybe the church has had a revival but the bride has a revival coming the prize revival is coming and I'm here tonight to declare it's here it's here it's arrived but if adam said don't think we got me vayas we haven't he said the pride hasn't had a revival you see there's been a revival there and no manifestation of god I'm the stirred up ride yet time he said we're looking for it so it'll take those seven unknown thunders look back yet to wake her up again is this what's happening are you being woken up this evening hallelujah get a lot of some praise get the loss of worship I'm getting ready to close out because the Holy spread is already in charge of the service I can't do much more because the word is already in you I'd really give us back the trigger you may be seated for a minute there is power in the message of Malachi 4 there is no mistake in the message of Malachi for every word and he spoke what specific was chosen and he said he went to so certain sees because the real rain is coming so there are certain things in the message just as when Jesus was here in earth and he spoke certain things he said things throw off some people and he said things to pull some people so when he made us deep and accept you eat my flesh and drink my blood those that were just church members didn't understand the service that day so they walk out the church this shot the Deacons hands and say that we are not coming back Jesus had no problem and that he turned to his own disciples and challenged them he said will you go also and then I brother Troy no not again said where shall we go when you alone have words of eternal life so I want to drive something home yet i win when you read this message you cannot read from an intellectual perspective and that's what confuses so many people including ministers reading the code and think it's in its intellectual it doesn't matter how smart you are unless God opens your understanding by revelation to what the Prophet said it will remain intellectual I don't know how I got the I don't know where I came from but it needed to be said but I'm trying to come to a point where the plenum saying there's been no manifestation of God to stir the bride and I was thinking about a would stir there's so many words you could use to describe what's supposed to happen why did believe I'm sister the bride Anna and I began to think about the woods still and sir by definition it means to mix it means to combine it means to unite it means to bring the elements together in chemistry and I'm not a chemist but in chemistry there's something called a Bunsen burner the cameras can correct me it's where you put certain things in and you try to mix it together but for certain things to mix together you need to stir it but there's another element certain things you need to mix together you got to put some fire to heat the elements up Oh somebody help you preachers evening you gotta put some fire under the burnham so there's the manifestation of God it's going to bring a fire that when the bride is turn up there's gonna be a reaction there's gonna be a reaction there's going to be a chemical reaction hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated I might drop something off to you that's why I love it he said the bride hasn't had a revival yet there's been no manifestation of God to stir the bride so I want you to picture the bride in some vessel so to speak a Bunsen burner and if we all bride it can be this group on that side and this group on this side and this one can talk to this one if that is the current case when the heat begins to activate and the story begins to take place then all who can shake your hand they suddenly have to shake your hand because there's a mixture going on there's a combining going on there's a reaction going on there's a shop that's why you may be seated it will not be manner because of these seven tunnels to gather the bride I went a manifestation I shot takes place no man could take credit for bringing the unity of the faith no man could take credit for bringing a unity among the people it would be God himself hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah or somebody give the Lord praise somebody's going free today you are going free today you may be seated so by revelation this evening you are being placed because God is the greatest chemist he took 16 elements and mix it together and formed man and said this man right here he's analyze a little breathe some life into him I gotta wake him up hug I gotta use a seven ton of power that's rooted in me don't wake Adam up from his slumber and that's the same God that's coming to wake the bride up to put the bride into action because the brightest or work the two kind of church semen I'm trying to close out I'm gonna have to finish this message some other time hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory my mama mama mama so what are we looking for friends we are looking for you may be seated for the manifestation of God of God not of man we have had enough of man what we need is a manifestation of God to stir the bride can the church say Amen a present tense reality you walk the message world you walk the message churches it's all about pushing the manifestation away because it's all about had knowledge read this read and studied in study this and there's no focus under God of Elijah there is no focus on the dynamics and where the branham said that I name this could be perfect but what does it go due to polish the hubcaps and keep washing a car if you don't intend to start the car for all these years we have been under the Ministry of the word and what we need now is the Ministry of the Spirit to bring these words he's alive or to use the word and I recourse to activate it to activate it because it's already in you somebody say man my God my God my god I must skip a lot of this here huh my God my God a manifestation of God you may be seated so Abraham let's just pick up something here and i'll touch elijah and then we go out abraham had to work for 25 years it is not right but after a while he needed something more than just the testimony yet he needed the word revelation that he testified about to change form because in that current form he was going to have the Sun but for what he needed was to move to a manifestation of God isn't that right Jacob he had reached the end of his Road when he had problems with his brother his ideas had run out him his way of doing things came to an end up he ran out of solutions there was nothing else that he could do he needed more than he had himself so he had to wait for what for a manifestation of God to bring a radical transformation in his life so that when he got a whole of the angel and he wrestled all night long when the Bible said he was all alone he didn't have the pasture with him the Ellis with him the Deacons with him he didn't have the ministers with him he didn't have any books with him he could even reach our book because he was in the middle of a fight but he was wrestling all night long because he made up his mind that if I let this angel go I'm going to be in the same condition that I came to church with she said I'm not gonna let you go until you bless me listen Jacob was such a fighter and it's hard for the human mind to comprehend how a mortal man can fight an angel in so much that he ends up they say please let me go what kind of hold and he have on the angel until he say angel I'm not gonna let you go the inter they say okay okay okay what do you want you see I need a change I need a change I need a manifestation of God to change my life kind of church hey man you may be seated I always tell young people it's two elements you need a revelation and you need experience Moses he had a revelation part he had a revelation party and with that revelation he was successful in his mission of killing one Egyptian I'm freeing none of his people his revelation took him as far as I need to save one of my countrymen and I will kill this Egyptian and the plan fold it after that because his strength his ideas his training was insufficient to the magnitude of the task that layer hand the responsibility that he was born for his intellect could have never prepared him for it his education could have never prepared him for it he had the best he could have in the course of Egypt I'm none of that training was going to prepare him for the work that he had laying on him so Moses frustrated walked out of Egypt he didn't whether he didn't walk it in a nice car saying I'll see all they want to come back you know he left desperate to get out because he had to run for his life because his own natural ability the ability of man had come to its end number six could have only taken him so far he needed to reach number seven he needed to get the cell phone to dial number seven can the church here man but Moses didn't know we had to call the number so he runs her own living his normal life get a wife you have a child you have a nice tent nice-looking tent until one day he sees something on the hilltop you see a manifestation of God because God's purpose has always been to manifest himself what good does it do to be able to deliver and you don't deliver what good is it to be a healer and don't heal anybody so God always what's the manifest himself and he's looking for somebody that he could use after a long time he was looking out looking out looking out waited for the right man to come along who was waiting for the right opportunity for manifestation and here it was the pillar of higher here and Moses here and Moses saying i gotta go up and investigate this kind of church demon i'm not going to be too long i'm finishing every drive this point home they see Moses who was a politician who was next in line for Pharaoh they will never put somebody who cannot speak or articulate himself or explain his military position as leader of the greatest army and kingdom on earth but when he came in contact with a burning bush he said I can't talk I don't know how to use sign language I don't know how to write I don't know how to do anything because he realized he came into contact with something that was much greater than himself can the church team and is there anybody here tonight who wants to contact something greater than themselves hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated I'm getting ready to close out and what a ministry Moses had when Moses met a pillar of fire he was never the same God told Moses you will be like God and Iran will be a prophet that's how Moses been as she was and when Moses died God came to Josh ones here Joshua Moses my civic is dead no arise take my people over go across Jordan go possess your inheritance he said and as I was with Moses sure shall I be with me I will not leave him I will not forsake thee and bry come on Josh was tonight up as i was with malachi for so shall i be with thee the same God that was feeling the prophet and the church hey man and there's so many things that I have to skip through a lot of it the woman with the blood issue the Bible says he spent all she had it would appear that she was a woman of some substance because she went around trying man's idea trying different churches trying different doctors trying different solutions until the situation itself for start to make a decision it was not by choice or excitement that you went to Jesus it was because of money ran out and she was out of options now we could understand why but a random said if love doesn't get you desperate conditions will so there are people who have it so nice they can't make it to church they have it so good they don't want to pray they have it so nicely convergence when they wanted doing the Juan de pere ties when they want to do this thing when they wanted clapping the one God is going to change the situations because if you are predestinated you have to come into your purpose so there was something God had to prove with this woman that when everything ran out she had to look to our only solution which was Jesus and she said if I could just touch the hem of His garment I don't know if I'll make it all the way to shake his hand but if I could just touch the hem of His garment then I can see the manifestation of God that I want from my life kind of church came in and that's how I feel the ceiling looking for a manifestation of God looking to become so real to you that when you wake up in the morning you say Lord this is the day when you go to bed at night you see Lord this is still dirty when you drive in your car it's a constant planning in your heart like Elijah after Elijah because when Elijah tasted that anointing is to that power when the mantle dropped upon him and he fell the anointing he had never felt anything like that before and you feel the anointing that is here or right now and they are not even moved in the service you know that's the angel you know that's the law I mean I just said you know what I cannot live without that I cannot live without that and he got rid of everything he had he burned the bridges behind him because he wanted to follow after that and everywhere Elijah went Elijah was following it was an easy for him because people were there discouraging him your master will be taken from you why you going there why are you praying why are you desperate why are you still going out to service can the church see man but he never lost his focus it didn't matter what was going on he never lost his focus because he wanted a manifestation of God for his life he wanted something to happen in his life until he finally crossed Jordan and Elijah said him what do you want what do you want he said I want a double portion Eliezer looked at him you asked a hard thing it's one thing to have what I have one double you want the same world that I do I'm greater works than these shall you do that's what you're asking for you want the dynamics of this should be a refilling you want more you you just do with the feeling you want refilling after you one can you ask a hard thing but if you see me go if you see me go if you see me go you could have what you asked for can the church him and the musician good the musician go get ready to come off I don't know how i made about amazing and i could imagine we read the scripture the chariot appears never before has anything been seen like this but Elijah is not focus on the chariot he's not focus on the horseman he's not focused in the fire he wants the mantle he ones what was wrapping Elijah all along he want a covering that Elijah had he won the same message that Elijah was preaching he won the same seventh seal seventh and anointing that Elijah had and when he lied is going up he didn't even say goodbye Elijah I don't know we're not no no no no no no the moment he
