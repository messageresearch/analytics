[0:10] love amen love for god and love his
[0:13] people can we say amen this morning
[0:15] yes lord amen glory so let's move on
[0:21] what is god who is god
[0:24] we can't begin to come comprehend who
[0:26] god is
[0:27] but the bible being god in print form
[0:31] the word of god is god the bible said
[0:34] first john 4
[0:35] he that love it not knowing that god for
[0:37] god
[0:38] is love is that right god is love
[0:43] amen if our message said love is the
[0:45] most perfect thing there is in the bible
[0:47] and god is love they that love are of
[0:50] god can we say amen glory to god amen
[0:54] from hebrews chapter 2 abram says now
[0:56] god was in the beginning
[0:58] before there was any light before there
[1:01] was ever an atomos tau
[1:02] any visible thing god filled all
[1:06] space and in that space was nothing but
[1:09] purity pure love pure holiness
[1:13] pure righteousness it was spirit amen
[1:16] hallelujah and god is the very essence
[1:19] of love
[1:20] his spirit covers all the solar system
[1:22] from eternity to eternity
[1:24] all love all power godly love agapo
[1:28] he's the fountain of all that hallelujah
[1:31] amen
[1:32] amen he's the fountain of love this
[1:34] morning amen
[1:36] glory and men of all ages have tried to
[1:39] explain
[1:40] this great love of god it is fathomless
[1:43] as the skies brother branham says
[1:46] there is no way to ever try to explain
[1:48] the depths of the love of god
[1:50] hallelujah for god is loving man his
[1:53] very
[1:54] being is love amen seven perfect spirits
[1:58] can we say amen this morning
[1:59] glory to god god's love is divine love a
[2:03] god pull of amen
[2:05] and hebrews chapter four amen brahma
[2:08] explained that there are four levels of
[2:10] love
[2:11] amen first is perfect love that's god's
[2:14] love
[2:14] pure and adulterated divine love amen
[2:19] praise god number two then there is fill
[2:21] your love amen which is earthly
[2:23] that's the love for your family but it
[2:25] has some perversion in it
[2:28] my number three then lustful love
[2:31] it has more perversion in it then number
[2:33] four there's filthy love
[2:35] it keeps on getting more perverted
[2:38] but by the look babaram said god's love
[2:41] agapo
[2:41] is million miles higher praise god
[2:45] every love outside of agapo is perverted
[2:48] love
[2:48] which has an end a couple of has no big
[2:51] beginning
[2:52] and it will never have an end can we say
[2:54] amen praise god
[2:56] hallelujah glory to god amen thank you
[2:59] jesus
[3:00] so in the garden sin perverted the pure
[3:04] love
[3:05] that adam shared with his family and
[3:07] with god in the beginning
[3:09] sin brought lust and fear and hatred and
[3:12] murder
[3:14] my in other words the heart of love
[3:18] in eden pure gentle divine
[3:23] soft passionate for god
[3:26] tenderhearted that kind of heart it
[3:29] changed
[3:30] it became a heart of stone perverted
[3:33] carnal
[3:34] hateful fearful my my my amen my
[3:38] my amen glory to god glory to god
[3:41] jeremiah 17
[3:42] the heart is now deceitful above all
[3:45] things and
[3:46] desperately wicked who can know it my my
[3:50] my my no wonder the songwriter said what
[3:53] can be done with this whole heart of
[3:55] mine
[3:56] please soften it up praise god with the
[3:59] holy ghost and
[4:00] fire hallelujah hallelujah oh praise
[4:03] god that old heart praise god but in
[4:06] ezekiel 36 we have promised a new heart
[4:10] a new heart also will i give you and a
[4:13] new spirit will i put within you
[4:15] and i will take away the stony heart out
[4:17] of your flesh
[4:18] and i will give you a heart of flesh a
[4:20] heart of
[4:21] love o glory to god amen and i will put
[4:24] my spirit within you
[4:26] and cause you to walk in my statutes
[4:29] hallelujah if you love me keep my
[4:31] commandment o praise god hallelujah
[4:34] glory to god glory to god glory to god
[4:37] amen the holy ghost will be your control
[4:40] tower
[4:40] right in the middle of your heart tied
[4:43] by
[4:44] chains of love you become a prisoner of
[4:47] love
[4:47] only doing god's will your heart becomes
[4:51] the throne of god
[4:53] can we say amen can we say amen
[4:56] a place for god to live praise god amen
[5:00] glory so a whole christian experience is
[5:04] a journey back to god
[5:06] back to love because god is love can we
[5:09] say amen
[5:10] can we say amen amen back to perfect
[5:13] love divine love
[5:14] pure love agape love back to a heart of
[5:18] love give the lord a hand of praise this
[5:19] morning
[5:20] [Applause]
[5:23] glory so love is key
[5:26] love is the objective paul emphasizes to
[5:29] the church
[5:30] how we must get back to love
[5:34] make no mistake about it don't fool
[5:36] yourself
[5:38] from divine love but ibrahim said no
[5:39] matter how much we try to bluff
[5:41] we are negative without love can we say
[5:44] amen
[5:45] amen and first corinthians 13 though i
[5:48] speak with the
[5:49] tongues of men and angels and have no
[5:51] charity
[5:52] i'm nothing i've missed the mark
[5:54] completely praise
[5:56] god my god my god he said though i
[5:58] prophesy and understand
[6:00] all mysteries and knowledge i am nothing
[6:03] without love
[6:04] my god he said do i have faith to move
[6:07] mountains
[6:07] and have no love i am still nothing
[6:10] praise god my god my god
[6:12] he's trying to show the importance of
[6:14] love to the church amen
[6:17] my and some people feel that charity
[6:20] means feeding the poor
[6:22] but paul says though i give all my goods
[6:24] to feed the poor
[6:25] i am still nothing without charity my
[6:29] you say do i give my body to be burned
[6:31] and have not charity
[6:32] i am still nothing it will profit
[6:35] nothing
[6:36] whatsoever my
[6:39] so charity is not just feeding the poor
[6:41] some people say
[6:42] man this charity here is divine love the
[6:45] love of god
[6:46] can we say man praise god hallelujah
[6:48] amen
[6:49] and first corinthians 14 follow after
[6:52] charity
[6:53] we must get it somebody say must get it
[6:56] must get it praise god hallelujah the
[6:59] love of god amen that's the love of god
[7:01] even
[7:02] christ amen love love amen the perfect
[7:05] love of god and colossians chapter 3
[7:09] says above
[7:09] all these things put on charity
[7:14] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[7:15] hallelujah how many one charity
[7:18] how many won that promise praise god we
[7:20] must have it
[7:21] we must have it amen glory

[7:27] hand of praise we must have it
[7:29] we must have it we need it we want it
[7:31] praise god amen
[7:32] hallelujah hallelujah this feel your
[7:34] love that we have is nice
[7:37] but it could fail us we love and love
[7:40] until somebody does do something wrong
[7:42] and then we don't love anymore
[7:47] we love our family and our friends alone
[7:51] man you love people in your churches
[7:54] you love people in your church more than
[7:56] people in another church he said that's
[7:58] perverted love can somebody say amen
[8:00] this morning
[8:01] oh my god my god my god hallelujah
[8:04] praise god
[8:05] he said that is failure and it cannot
[8:07] work praise god
[8:08] ah hallelujah so fill your love cannot
[8:12] work
[8:12] we need charity this morning we need the
[8:15] charity praise god hallelujah
[8:17] the love of god hallelujah hallelujah
[8:23] when the people crucified jesus enemy or
[8:26] friend
[8:27] it did not matter he said father forgive
[8:29] them
[8:31] and when you fail and do things you
[8:33] should not do he says i forgive you
[8:36] i love you no less
[8:39] go and sin no more hallelujah and he
[8:42] wraps his arms of love around you
[8:45] he loves you with an everlasting love
[8:47] somebody praise him this morning
[8:49] somebody praise him somebody praise him
[8:51] hallelujah hallelujah
[8:53] hallelujah praise god thank you jesus
[8:56] oh glory to god so choose love
[9:00] over hate choose to love
[9:04] love is the most powerful force there is
[9:07] love will conquer anything every enemy
[9:09] praise god
[9:10] love will endure forever when everything
[9:13] else fails
[9:14] love will still be there can we say amen
[9:18] hallelujah hallelujah glory
[9:23] how will they know that you are
[9:25] christians how
[9:27] john chapter 13 by this shall all men
[9:30] know that you are my disciples
[9:32] if you have love one to another give the
[9:34] lord a hand of praise
[9:36] give the lord a hand of praise amen love
[9:38] one to another amen
[9:40] so we have to treat each other right
[9:42] with love show kindness
[9:44] colossians three husbands love your
[9:46] wives titus too let the older woman
[9:48] teach the younger sisters to love their
[9:50] husbands
[9:51] and to love their children amen can we
[9:53] say amen
[9:54] praise god amen so the older sisters
[9:57] have some work to do amen
[9:58] to teach the younger ones to love their
[10:00] husband brother smiling amen but he also
[10:02] say husbands love your wives amen
[10:04] sister smiling now amen glory
[10:07] so come on love is the key say amen
[10:12] love is the key amen hallelujah glory
[10:15] even the gifts of the church brother
[10:18] branham said
[10:19] perfect love brings perfect gifts
[10:22] he says so work first with love and then
[10:25] that brings
[10:26] fellowship and then fellowship brings
[10:29] gifts can we say amen
[10:30] hallelujah come on now he said one time
[10:34] i'd rather have a church that knows
[10:36] nothing about any spiritual
[10:37] gift and just be so in love with each
[10:40] other
[10:41] and with christ i'd rather have that
[10:45] then every spiritual gift operated in
[10:48] the church
[10:50] he was trying to show how important love
[10:52] is among the people
[10:55] amen a heart of love for god and his
[10:58] people
[10:59] thank you praise god he said you can
[11:02] have
[11:03] every gift and still be lost
[11:07] again he said i'd rather have that
[11:09] experience of love
[11:11] than all the gifts that god has in
[11:13] heaven
[11:14] my
[11:18] but paul kept talking about something
[11:21] that was perfect to come
[11:24] when that perfect thing comes brother
[11:27] everything
[11:28] else will fade away amen first
[11:30] corinthians 13 amen can we say amen
[11:34] so talking about the heart of love give
[11:36] the lord a heart of prayer
[11:44] a familiar story from urbana
[11:48] we remember the story of brother branham
[11:49] leaving his plane
[11:51] and just walking until he met the old
[11:53] shana mike type woman
[11:56] she said the lord gave my husband and i
[11:58] a lovely boy
[12:00] and i promised the lord i'd raised my
[12:02] baby for him
[12:04] but he took the wrong road a few years
[12:06] ago
[12:07] and now he has a venereal disease and
[12:10] now he's laying in the room
[12:12] dying the doctor has given him all kinds
[12:16] of shots
[12:17] and he can't get well he's been
[12:19] unconscious
[12:20] since yesterday she said i got down on
[12:24] my knees and i prayed oh lord
[12:26] if i am the shadowmind woman where is
[12:29] your elijah
[12:32] she said i prayed all night and the lord
[12:34] said to stand by the gate this morning
[12:37] she had a relationship with god amen she
[12:40] spoke to god and god spoke back to her
[12:42] amen praise god amen my relationship
[12:45] hallelujah and when brother branham
[12:47] reached he went into the house
[12:49] he saw the boy laying there making a
[12:52] song like
[12:54] he said mama is so dark
[12:57] she was patching him and loving him he
[13:00] was
[13:00] ramsay he was kind of unconscious but
[13:04] no matter how old he was
[13:07] or what he had done he was still
[13:10] mama's boy um yes lord

[13:34] and said god bless mommy's baby
[13:39] and baby said i thought if a mother's
[13:42] love will do that
[13:43] fill your love if a mother's love can do
[13:46] that
[13:47] how much more will the love of god do
[13:49] for us
[13:50] can we say amen this morning how much
[13:53] more will god's
[13:54] love do for us this morning hallelujah
[13:57] he said oh

[14:01] measureless and strong
[14:03] it shall forevermore enjoy hallelujah

[14:09] praise god if a mother's love can do
[14:12] that

[14:16] he said yes a mother may forget her
[14:18] suffering baby
[14:21] but god said i will never leave you nor
[14:23] forsake you
[14:24] your names are written and engraved in
[14:26] the palm of my hands

[14:30] him praise hallelujah
[14:32] i will never leave you now forsake you
[14:35] praise god as i promised you amen oh
[14:37] glory
[14:40] she said person can we pray
[14:44] and that old saint knelt down and raised
[14:48] up our hands
[14:49] and poured out her heart to god but
[14:52] ibrahim said i
[14:53] never heard such a prayer in my life my
[14:58] he said i when i heard her pray he said
[15:00] i held the
[15:01] little iron post off the bed and cried
[15:03] like a baby
[15:05] to see the outpouring of love it moved

[15:27] and you're in an obedience to the
[15:28] leading of the holy spirit
[15:30] i lay my hands upon this boy in the name
[15:32] of jesus christ
[15:35] he said next thing the boy said mama

[15:42] and in a few moments
[15:43] he was up on his feet rejoicing somebody

[22:14] insane institution about six feet two

[22:29] grass i'll show you how much
[22:31] man of god you are i'll break every bone
[22:33] in your body
[22:35] but abraham is a small man he said when
[22:38] that happened you could hear a pin
[22:40] drop in the audience hundreds of sick
[22:43] people were there
[22:45] he said i'm kept on speaking then a man
[22:49] rushed up to the to brother branham on
[22:51] the pulpit and spit in his face
[22:54] my and you know what
[22:57] happened the holy spirit came down and
[22:58] said you will fall over my feet
[23:00] and he did but from the message god
[23:03] provided a lamb
[23:05] he explained it a little differently
[23:07] brabham said
[23:08] what was it did i hate
[23:12] the man he said no
[23:15] i loved him a poor mortal in that
[23:19] condition
[23:21] that was not the man speaking that was
[23:23] the devil
[23:24] the devil made a challenge and the holy
[23:27] spirit challenged him back
[23:28] glory to god amen praise god

[23:43] we must have it we have to add it praise

[24:53] the inspiration

[25:01] brahm says when god placed man in the
[25:03] garden
[25:04] god gave him some of his birth
[25:08] part of his life he was in the image and
[25:11] likeness of god can we say amen
[25:13] hallelujah so adam
[25:17] had the love of god this is
[25:21] i'm seeing this it's not part of the
[25:23] quote so adam had the love of god amen
[25:26] the fellowship and harmony with god
[25:28] glory
[25:30] adam had dominion over every creature
[25:33] and over all the earth can we say amen

[25:45] power to control
[25:46] glory to god amen he ruled it
[25:50] well he ruled it with love
[25:53] hallelujah oh glory to god and i believe

[26:01] the earth felt the love the plants the
[26:04] animals the ocean
[26:06] nature itself felt the love praise god
[26:10] hallelujah he used the language of love
[26:15] he used the power of love to rule and
[26:19] conquer every creature
[26:21] no wonder the lion laid down by the lamb
[26:24] praise god
[26:25] what perfect peace and harmony existed
[26:27] praise god amen
[26:29] can we say amen he had
[26:32] a heart of love it was the oneness of

[27:25] sin came the true ownership
[27:30] of the earth never really changed
[27:34] because god still had it but the
[27:37] rulership
[27:38] the leadership change satan became the
[27:41] god of this
[27:42] world no wonder
[27:45] when satan temporarily took over and sin
[27:49] stepped in
[27:50] perfect love was gone the animals became
[27:54] fierce the leaves began to fall
[27:59] storms raged over the earth
