me let us go into the house of the Lord when the joy of the Lord comes back to be your strength then the sons of God cannot wait to come into the house of God to worship when the joy of the Lord is your strength you have been to all kind of hell this week but the joy of the Lord is still your strength all right yeah my son comes to my my mind Ain't Nobody Do Me Like Jesus you look for joy and job you look for joy and wife and husband but my goodness when God bring this kind of Joy everything has looked foolish you know I mean look foolish for the kind of joy that we have they have joined football and cricket and basketball but this is Joy a different kind of Joy no wonder why the songwriters that this Joy I have the world didn't give it and the world who didn't give it the World Cup take it away oh that that's why is it this joy that I have there's nothing money Joy a job Joy I got a new car Joy No but this joy that I have you could be in prison and have God's joy you could be in trouble and have God's joy it's God that gives you that joy and Jesus say I come that you will have life and have it more abundantly and when you get that Joy no man can take it from you how much men want to take that Joy from you but when Lord give me that Joy no man can take it from you oh Hallelujah my God I'm looking for a Revival I am having myself a revolver you let me see that I didn't know how we're going to preach today with the flu and everything else when I get up here and I feel the anointing my God I feel so strong I feel so empowered I feel like Samson Sam said my brother you know and so is David and Joshua and just iron all these other Heroes of Faith they are my brethren and when the spirit of God Came Upon Samson he did what he couldn't do before when the spirit Came Upon David but ashamed he did what he never did before what about when the spirit comes upon you you you have things to do that you ain't even think about yet not that you don't even know what God wanted I don't want to start yet that was seem to be seated I'll continue right oh Hallelujah breathe the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord o glory to God these are scripture I read in Cameroon you didn't already get to read it here from David after battle David came back home so David and his men came to the city and behold it was burned with fire their wives their sons their daughters were taking captives then David and the people that were with him lifted up the voices and wept until they had no more power to read and David two wives were taken captives and David was greatly distressed for the people spake of stone in him when you're having Victory people love you too bad but when you come back to a situation of disaster and defeat they want to Stone the same David hey there and mighty man of Allah you want to Stone him his own people because the soul of all the people was grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters but David encouraged himself nobody you but David encouraged himself in the Lord is God you yell that is himself in the Lord his God oh who you're filming this morning who you're worshiping this morning Jesus told a woman we know what we worship do you know who you're worshiping this morning David said to Abitha the priest to David and David inquire that the Lord saying shall I pursue after this Troop shall I overtake them and he answered pursue for those shall surely overtake them and without feel recover all hallelujah hallelujah did you hear that Hallelujah he came and see everything crashed Tiff but I asked me and David sought the Lord and God told him pursue go after them don't sit down and mope don't sit down and cry don't sit down and give up don't sit down and let go don't sit down and look like if they don't have no authority to do what you have to do what man got to do what man got to do oh God and this is what this is all about this morning we're gonna do all what we gotta do could we style if we want to turn to the scriptures to James chapter 2 you want to read from verse 15 to 26. and one verse of Saint John chapter 4 verse 34. thank you musicians thank you brother Gideon for that inspiring worship this morning everything needs to be inspired the singing must be inspired the specials Must Be Inspired musicians must be inspired the choir must be inspired the people must be inspired and the preacher must be inspired and and when all that inspiration come together oh my God will be inspired reading James 2 reading from verse 15. if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food and one of you saying to them departing peace be warmed and filled you're speaking the word notwithstanding you give them not those things which are needful to the body what does it profit even so feet if it had not works is dead being alone yeah a man may say thou has faith and I have worked show me thy faith without thy works and I will surely my faith by my Works don't believe us that there is one God they'll do us well the devil also believe and tremble but will though no oven man that faith without books is dead was that Abraham or father justified by works when he had offered Isaac and his son upon the altar seeing thou how Faith wrought with his works and by works was Fit made perfect and the scripture was fulfilled with said Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called a friend of God you see them how thereby Works a man is Justified and not by faith only likewise also was not rehabbed the halot justified by works when she had received the messengers and had sent them out another way for as the body without the spirit is dead so feet without works is death also I read it from Saint John chapter 4. excuse me I want to read from one verse 34. and this is Jesus disciples just before they came and said Master eat he said I have me to eat that you know love and then we'll study for Jesus said my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work let's pray father we thank you for your word interpret it to our hearts inspired the word to your people and made us be a life-changing service Lord May no one leave it the same way they came but may the word be effective to them in their spirits in their heart and may the word become flesh I may have confirmly with signs wonders and miracles May the anointed me so powerful that when they leave here it will go in their cars it will go in their houses it will go on the job wherever they go it will go with them and give them tremendous victory in GSM I ask it amen and amen you will be seated who prays the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord I have a title my faith in God's promises is expressed by my works my faith in God's promises is expressed by my works and I have an inspiration doing all we can do now last week's the title was let us provoke one another to love and good works and we asked a question who is responsible for the bride seventh and the Revival and I brought it to the part that you must play but there's a path that the Ministers of the play and there's a part that God has to play so all together is what going to produce that bride's Revival isn't that right and I have a thought I thought of God expect results an action is caused action don't just happen action is caused and today I want to introduce a new word which is like opposite to action that is caused and that new word is inertia i n e r t i a inertia and we're going to find out a little bit in a while what that is now I just have this written in my commission this is me is to go into all the world and preach the gospel that is the instructions that Jesus have given us so on the fields I know I'm in the will of God and but around say one once a minister is on the fields he is in the will of God now I know I could stay in The Newsroom and give comments on what is happening on the Battlefront because that is what Newsroom people do sometimes they have hurricane and earthquake and different things and somebody outside in a hurricane and they're reporting to headquarters and the person in the studio they're not getting wet they are commenting on who is getting wet outside the deal and they said now we have a report from so and so on they could talk and sometimes they have a big table and the son talking to this one and this one talking this one but they're not in the hurricane place they're not getting wet they're not feeling the breeze nothing in the storm they're just commenters or talkers or just uh yeah that's all I'm saying I wasn't ordained to be in The Newsroom praise God I wasn't ordained to be in the commentary box I wasn't ordained to be a wrong Morning Edition around a table and people sitting on a couch and this cuspect is happening no no no no I am going to be on the battlefield for my Lord Hallelujah are you with me so therefore there are three kind of people those who are wondering what is happening those who are watching what is happening and those are the commentators they're in the box they're watching what is happening and the last bunch is the part that I am in those who are causing things to happen don't you've got to pick your sluck you got to pick what you want to be identified but because everybody gonna be identified one way or the other or give the Lord some Praises people hallelujah it's not something so you have always heard about the tax a tax that was supposed to be done and everybody had a chance to do it anybody could have done it somebody thought anybody will do it but in the end nobody did it so everybody is looking for anybody and anybody thought somebody was going to do it so we don't want to be anybody and everybody and somebody know somebody gonna do the task because Jesus said my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish the work God will just have things God will just have talk God have things to fulfill is this when God speaks to a man he give that man ambition and purpose two things you give that man ambition and purpose and when that man gets Revelation one evidence you're going to see is two things you're going to see humility and fearlessness Oh Glory to God could we give the Lord some amens but because the Lord I shout when God speaks to a man he gave him ambition and purpose and after that when God reveals himself you will see two things a humble man and a man praise God with a tries Hallelujah Fearless because he has been in the presence of God and he has heard from The Lord Oh Glory to God that's when Elijah stumbled he said not even due or rain will fall till I call for it I don't care what the weather is saying I don't care what the weather man is saying I don't care what the people are saying I shut up heavens and you are awake till I call for it to get the rain that you're looking for I stop your blessings I stop the anointing I stop everything Hallelujah Heaven is short until I call cinnamon yes from God oh Hallelujah are we coming to crunch time now this is when the tire hit a solution hope you be part of the problem because if you're not part of the solution you are simply part of the very problem itself but Jesus said my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish the work he just finished handling the woman at the well all glory the God he said the disciples because he couldn't let them see what he was about to do he was about to call a name in the book and he had to push them guys away to always they get to speak to this woman and God will push this one away and push that one away to get to speak to you God will make sure you're in the right place and the right time to hear the right message come on shame man somebody got gonna make sure because you have to hear from God you must you must hear from God hallelujah you see it has been soon emphasized so much about ministers and ministers I have to push that straight into a corner no to bring it into a balance have been too much about men and men have just messed up Hallelujah but a real man messed up is not not the bad part you know yeah because in the Bible the fundament messed up but you know man uh who is real man man of God I should say they accept responsibility they don't blame they accept responsibility and they deal with where they messed up they confront but where they messed up they will handle where they messed up messed up as part of the package but is if you're gonna handle with what you're wearing messed up oh God because somebody say Amen oh praise the name of the Lord so when God tells you something you have got to do it nobody else that's a quote when God tells you something you have got to do it nobody else oh we have to face up to it and do it it's our responsibility so that's why I challenge you to provoke one another not a rat not the anger not the backslide but the love and the good works come on you could make it not to talk not the yap yap yap yap yap we had it for 40 years works Oh Glory to God is not right praise God from hearing him and this a part of this is on our Facebook page I just love it so much and I shall bring back that to you unless I'm hearing him but the RAM says uh ministers he said watch God going to he gonna give a great watch if he give us this great secret office he is going to require it at our hands so you think this is just stand up here preaching and I think I'm saying am I going to be judged they say yes that's what they told Brother Brown then he said but I Bishop Paul preached so it's not like just pass on okay okay there's a requirement that's why God said I require at the hands of those pastors who did not feed my flock and who fed themselves and did not feed the sheep they will unsuffer that my sheep that's what God Said in the past feed my flock Hallelujah Oh Glory to call him in so watch and we better preach the truth because God is going to if he's got a secret office he's going to require it in our hands so what the tutor brought the message to the father oh this is good this is good tutor reporting on your behavior not the Deacon not the Elder not the pastor the Holy Ghost he's the tutor he's reporting on your behavior not this man not somebody said in some drone over you looking where you're walking and whatnot no no no no no this is the tutor he don't need drones he don't need somebody to walk behind you he knows where you are he knows where you have been he knows who you're talking to he knows the very thoughts itself Hallelujah and he knows all about you and he can report on your very Behavior Oh Glory to God what your wife and see what your husband does see what the family don't see he sees whether you say Amen or not that ends up in what I'm preaching you know you don't ever hinder me you know Hallelujah you are free and I am free if you are not free I am still free to tell you the truth because only the truth gonna set you free I am not here to tell you what you want to hear I'm gonna tell you what God put upon my heart oh Hallelujah somebody's got a Revival in this place somebody gonna love the word all right so the future is reporting the child is progressing right or wrong so no matter what the outside people have to say about this child what the servants and the farmer to say he tried to work everywhere to please the father and no matter there we go no matter what the world has to say about you work to please God do everything you can to build the kingdom of God not to break it down to build it work to please God so I'm saying this for you to understand the beat that your past is in he's not trying to please anybody Hallelujah I'm not accountable to any man on planet Earth so I am not beholden to any man to impress any man any group of men on Earth I am only obligated to please my father foreign whose kingdom I represent when I go overseas I tell them I don't represent Trinidad I represent the kingdom of the most high God that is what I represent the kingdom that cannot be moved oh give the Lord some Praises people Hallelujah you see I am not preaching a private gospel customized for this country or for you Jesus didn't say hey go to all the world and preach your own private interpretation of what you think I am saying no he said preach the gospel and the gospel is the good news which is the word turn into Power oh that Miracle preaches in China in Japan and Asia in South America in Canada in America in Africa it doesn't matter I could preach the word because the word is God and the world can't return for it the word of power to deliver the way that power is set you free God's temptation to deliver his people the word of a hook on it he said my word shall not return unto me void you have got to believe that you are going to be delivered today because nowhere it is you have got to expect great things today because Faith don't say next week say don't say tomorrow no faith is oh Hallelujah don't never divide it by denominational barriers don't let those little things that man put over the church separate Brotherhood because your Methodist she can be the Baptist because you are Presbyterian she came with a Pentecostal we're brethren don't let little man Barb wires barriers separate you from The Fellowship of the sins of the Living God I will not let any man tell me Ikea fellowship at brethren I reject that nobody can tell me you can't talk to this one and you can't talk to that one you have to be crazy lunatic aim and nuts I will talk to whoever I want to talk to smile but whoever listen my God I will laugh I would smile I will eat I will fellowship with macgyvers but the Pharisees but the Sadducees but with the herodians it doesn't matter who they are they can't change who I am I am who I am you are who you are come on give the Lord some Praises people my my so don't let the little man by boyabaria separate you from The Fellowship of the Saints who are our brethren in like Precious feet if they don't know just as much as you feel you pray for them and associate with them and fellowship with them and God will spread his love abroad in the hearts too for Glory we ask something to spread you know Our Testimony the love of God coming to my heart I have a Visa stamped to Glory oh already approved oh Hallelujah somebody passed through God's immigration they just pull out the passport and are you already stamped already he said come on true come on true come on through sealed till the day of redemption see sealed Oh Glory to God passport stop Jesus stamped you're on your way to Glory you're like Abraham you're making look if I seek you is making Belarus God you pick up a wife but you're still looking for that City if it's not stop two children but they're looking for that city they're getting old but they're looking for that City the gray hair coming on but you're still looking for that City whose maker and Builder is God oh John saw that City we are going to a city oh give the Lord some Praises people Hallelujah praise God he said let's stay under the blood when that sun had come to the age of 21 we call it a day if the tutor had brought with to the father and told him everything was fine this boy was a gallant man he was zealous here we go of the father's Kingdom not just you know uh I don't even know my father businesses Jesus could have said that when he was five years old he said I am about my father's business now if you are both your father's business it means you have to know the father's business you're getting a revelation of the father's will to execute the father's plan for business because son has to be approved you can't be doing nothing and get approval there's an approval for nothing your holy ghost telling you all for nothing how was he he did nothing he prayed nothing he worshiped nothing he actually did nothing he just came and occupied a seat in church and worship sometimes according to how he felt he was never interested in seeking the father's business and reading a word to get the father's will for his life now watch watch that he was jealous of the father Kingdom and he'd done all here we go he's done all he could to improve and embedded the kingdom that is what the father is looking for Hallelujah to see the sons that want to improve and embitter the kingdom they father take him out in the pub that means every true ordained predestinated Ministry of God must become publicly identified it can't be hidden in the corner hiding under bushel saying God is with me no some point in time God himself will take the mask off of all of that he will push you into the position where you have to be public ified his son Jesus had 18 years of Silence but when the silence was about to be broken God loose John the Baptist to make a way for that announcement that the sun is about to comfort so when John the Baptist here Behold the Lamb of God God was ready to say this is my beloved Son and whom I'm pleased to publicly identify myself with come on same as somebody pull him out from the bunch I'm gonna pull him out from the rest and let the world know I'm with him oh give the Lord a shout to praise people that's what God gonna do for you one day that's what God is about to do for you maybe today they got fire that love of identification gonna come down upon your life oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah are you ready the father take them out into a public place set him up before the public his same son that have been born in his home years before all the time is sun here we go but his character and his conduct had brought him to another office notice not his sermons not his mighty Revelation an unfolding of many hidden mysteries no his character and his conduct had brought him into another office or position so all these messages is only part of it so God is not so much interested in The Newsroom dictation and reading the script over the prompt screen ah something kind of good behind Helen has the news coming in the slitting the news station she's reading off of a screen this has happened that has happened you can't get character reading off a screen you read the news in The Newsroom to get character you have to get out The Newsroom I'm not hearing you I am not hearing you reading quotes that come back The Newsroom but when you loosed into the situations and you could come true oh hallelujah hallelujah my God because character is a victory glory to God you've got to overcome something that means god does designed conflict we need conflict we need battles we need sword fighting we need issues because that is our character comes forward foreign hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah I told them in Europe there are plenty of people who don't like battles they do like confusion they don't like to hurt anyone distilled anyone so they have no stand they don't even have a sit they stand for nothing they have no witness in their mouth they please everybody they take no signs they hurt nobody they end up additional dish right I want the whole world to know what side I'm on I'm on the side of the word I will stand with any man who's with the word he don't even have to believe all that I believe but as much as he believed I will stand by him because the word is God I am not the revealer of the word the Holy Ghost is and if the Holy Ghost don't reveal it to that brother he can't get it because every man must Minister according to the grace and faith that God give that man and if God gave me this small measure and give somebody a bigger measure God bless them but you see this little measure I have I'm going to use it because that's the measure God gave me foreign you may be seated all those guys in the Army had their sword some with nice Hilt some with signature on it all of them sharp swords some broad some silver hat sip some gold tip brown simple kind of tip and all David had was a little old sing and some Stones just packing just in case he already killed a beer he already killed a lion in case a meat of anything I could handle myself I have something that I could use you may be seated that's the problem some of you have nothing to use safety bear come and call the pastor if the lion come yeah if a mouse come and call your husband all right Hallelujah but you have to call somebody because you're not prepared issues and challenges you see if you understand this you would love when the issues hit you like that you will never back down you will say born for this you know what it is to come back and meet your whole family taken your place burned down to the ground and all your Mighty Men depressed and discouraged and they want to Stone you you know the tragedy that is but David can courage himself pull himself up by the bootstrap and sometimes you feel so battered and bruised so beaten to give up but don't give up not this morning not this morning not this morning not this morning no no no no not today no we're gonna push you be gonna fight gonna press the battle you may be season what do you mean about Pursuit behaven I pray for material before prefer them again but this time different you said you're going for them the same it's the only time you're praying and God break the foot break the hand do something to them they'll come back in the house of God and what another no no not that they're coming back the first thing you have to declare they're coming back don't do it what they are they aren't coming back 7-Eleven you let the devil know that you saying today by my word listen listen to what God told David not only but I didn't read all this scripture for you but David ride all night long all night long pray oh God I'm tired just come true back could you please help the Philistines and the Amalia has to bring back my wife Inspire them turn around their heart impress them that you are God bring a vision to them God will be shaking hands everybody hear that kind of Prayer and God listen son wake up get on your horse I'm right get some Gallant man with you tell them tell them listen this you see faith tell sees the finished product all will be restored everything oh so listen they had a victory before they even leave when they go on the horse the fish she was there when the first Gallop started the victory was there the NCD amateurs yet but the victory was there he and the wife Abigail yet but she is coming back because God said all will be restored and if God said all gonna be restored all is going to be restored how many believe that inside of here this morning son restoration oh hallelujah hallelujah foreign Behavior brought him into another position inertia that's stupid that would call it nature last week he did about action scores wanna deal with another word what called inertia inertia is a tendency to do nothing or remain unchanged it speaks of inactivity passivity stagnation idleness sluggishness lethargy popidity indolence laziness and thoughtfulness that is inertia in physics it is a property of matter by which it continues in existing state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless that state is changed by an external Force so in inertia means when that comes to arrest it steers rest it don't move it is rested nothing change it inertia means when it comes to your lower line it says straight line so same speed same time same channel no change whatsoever 20 years no change 30 years no change it's the inertia I come to challenge that break that bust that rip into that shut down that act on his cause it means that could just happen we are here to cause something to happen the properly think about wrapping straight up in the air and don't come a whirlwind hold Hallelujah you'll be seated the tendency of a body to preserve its state of rest or uniform motion unless acted upon by an external Force says if love don't get you desperate the external force will also carries lack of movement or activity when movement or activity is wanted or needed a feeling of not having the energy or this that is needed to move or change one of the saddest thing for me as a pastor is to talk to Christians who don't want to change they are religious and they are spiritual but not happy spiritual at least I think they are spiritual but it is contented spiritual thing because there's prayer and they love Jesus but the thing to move them to where they're supposed to go they're not moving because this is all I was with all these years you call that inertia this is what I know and change is always hard Hallelujah Oh Glory Hallelujah Moses know what Wilderness but you know what landline Joshua was the man was the land man Moses was pushed out into the wilderness and there's a beautiful scripture where jecho take him and lead him and she was seen about Jethro sheep leading sheep you think Moses know he had to lead all them bunch of people out there Moses were even think about going back and then leading sheep so God had to strip him humble him give him an experience not knowing all of this is background for what he is going to do what if Moses said I you know who I am Joshua come on former Prince of Egypt and Joshua said correct former go and see body sheep they will come and claim your former power that's what you used to have this is not Egypt you're in my territory and you see my daughter there she's a nice lady so relax yourself settle down and he gets settled down leading sheep no burden for Egypt they're on their own back there until the Lord called out to him in the burden Bush but before God called unto him that God sent the attraction to see if he will turn aside and see and the Bible said when he turned inside the sea because some people are even telling aside they're so fixed in their ways in inertia all kind of things happening around them but they're going down one way one way one way you got to turn some point in time I hope this service is a turning point a change in point a different kind of point foreign aside to see what God is trying to tell you because he wants you to live on if your mind is crippled up your spirit is crippled up you you crippler you decide to see I went to another see God spoke to Moses and said Moses time up fella head down to Egypt new commission for you Hallelujah go down and bring the people out Hallelujah Moses started to make excuses lord I can't talk like you know what it is I settled down right now I get new furniture I have a new tent I have new goats I have a whole fresh block of sheep and sworn and lambs and so on but business going well good God said you didn't hear what I said do I have to repeat myself a pack-up shop and head down to Egypt and bring my people out then when Moses started to accept watch that word accept now accept that there's nobody else could do what he has to do and when you begin to accept that nobody else could do what you are to do stop running and accept responsibility that you have got a job Hallelujah when when Moses recognized God not taking No Excuses he wanted to talk differently and who shall I season me who who who because this is both of us talking here now but when I get down here I mean what I will tell them you should tell them I am tell them I am that I am sent you you're so someone said God not tell his wife uh we go in Egypt when a month from now no tomorrow you think Egypt is 24 hours is not a train ticket it's a long journey there and you had to come over one time and you know I mean God have a right timing for everything else when everybody come in with a gifts and so on they want to know what Moses bringing because those days Egypt was the place all modern technology there was a I mean they were the big guys the big players super plays Super country they were the Metropolis in that time and everybody bringing homemade to Egypt bringing this thing and that thing and the oil and whatever it is and Moses come what kingdom are you from everybody come for some Kingdom from Syria from this and whatnot what kingdom are you from Moses said the kingdom of the most high God what do you bring fellow asking that anyone yeah you think like some name King of the most high God eating like some country or something like that he said what do you bring I bring a word to Pharaoh what word let my people go that's a whole different ball game altogether that wasn't cotton that was nylon that wasn't perfume that was an ivory that wasn't gold or silver that was the word a bigger word for Pharaoh I've been a word to serve it take your hands off my children I've been a word for Pharaoh take my hands off my family I've been compared for Pharaoh let my people call and we bringing a word to that devil that's banging you we're bringing a word to the Yoke over your life living in a word to your sickness that you are going to be healed we have a prayer line next week we bring in the word bring the sick bring the halt break the blame whatever we're gonna pray for God to deliver he said these are these signs shall follow them that believe they shall lay hands on the second they shall recover all right Glory that they interrupted Egypt the custom getting natural gifts all kind of bongs and work and things like that but then let's get a word if you ever say what is this oh Hallelujah I have some men I could do some stuff they bring them out Giants and jamberries they could do some stuff man and they came up with some stops and throw it on the ground to shoot a Dean Spirit into sticks turn to snakes but Moses met snakes along the way in Egypt in the wilderness so he he accustomed with snakes if he never saw a snake before Moses get frightened but Moses are customer sneaks scorpions all kinds of things so is that what you bring well all right let me show you what I'll do take that move this snake eat up their snake pick up a bit stick he said it's only wrong number once come back tomorrow with the word and we're gonna stick with the word until the devil have to break his grip you see falling and afterwards he handsome yeah yeah he has to open his hands he has to let go yes the devil holding but he has to let go the sickness on your life have to let go the problem are wrong you have to let go how many Believers got to let go how many know each other let's go yeah yeah yeah it's gonna be broken it's gonna be broken it's gonna be broken oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God you may be seated understand this the devil can't get stronger the devil has always been the devil but we can get stronger come on Israel Give the Lord a shout the devil can't get stronger but we can Glory Hallelujah you may be Caesar so I want you to move from this inertia from this continue along the same path and get into activity into movement into becoming a Dynamo because from that narrative is where you get the word dynamics come from Dynamo is to be in constant motion to produce a result isn't that right you got to have a movement in order to get something going for you you've got to have a Stern up a worship up a praise up you've got to do something Jesus said the works that I do shall you do also we are talking about words let's call it this way we talk enough I said talk done glory to God we're gonna do something about all this talk that we talk that's why we're having a prayer line next week we are we are serving notice that we are going to do more than just preach we're gonna pray we're going to cast Devils out we are saying it before it happened we are going to heal the sick yes we have authority to do that yes how many believe that my God all right so it works but around them preached his feet expressed Works show that faith has already took a whole and Paul wrote about Josephine Abraham by what God saw in Abraham which is Faith and James Justified Abraham by works and people thought it was a conflict or argument but then the prophet brought out that one was what God sees and the other is what man sees so the thing of it is this if you claim to have faith that's what God sees they have to be Works to prove and bring evidence of the faith that you claim to have and if the word is bringing fit to you there got to be evidence by your work by your life by your action and attitude that faith is truly taken a hole so if we don't see a behavior that matches up with the faith you claim then you maybe don't have the faith that you claim because once that Faith inside you take a hole there's a behavior that goes with it the Bible said Abraham started not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving praise to God so when Faith take a whole it gives praises the evidence of faith is the ability to worship because you can't be condemned and worshiped so when all condemnation is ripped out of you Faith taking hold of you going to give God praise because faith is saying it's already done yeah see it have no need to be worried because faith is the very substance of what you're hoping for eign a while ago he's depressed he is struggling and after God speak to him he's smiling his wife is not there yet but he's smiling he's sure but he's smiling the people has not returned yet but he is smiling why faith is the victory and Faith listen is a revelation from God that's why people love group Revelation they like to hide because it saves them the burden of seeking God it saves them but guess what that's a group thing I'm fit never belongs to a group said never God never give a group a revelation so when the pastors mess up the people and indoctrinize them for a personal gain manipulate them all the group the whole bunch saying the same thing and sometimes the word of God that's why Jesus some say that man always have opinions men always have interpretation men always have ideas I could do what other brothers doing he said the reason we can't be placed is because this one want to do what I want doing so God blessing the brother with corn and everyone on the plant corn too God say you're the quarter plant corn your land is not a corn land your land is to go grass to feed the sheep draw your grass and feed your sheep let that everybody see what is called come on say Amen somebody say God give me corn leave me with my corn don't interfere with me messing with the wrong guy oh Hallelujah foreign it was a great thing to do as it was happening too why it was God listen revealing himself to individuals yet was 120 in the upper room but was God here we go revealing himself to individuals noting it wasn't a group baptism everybody get the liquor fire the Bible said tongues of fire sat on each and every one of them everyone got their portion so when Mary got abortion she didn't feel let the preach she feel led to make a nice apple pie you know something all right so the anointing have to come to produce what God Said supposed to produce okay now here we go here we go Noah Works expressed a man what his faith was in God's promise they couldn't see Noah's fate they could see him building an arc so man could see wait a minute he's serious he is asking upon what he believed now here we go David a Shepherd sling expressed to the whole Israel army the faith he had in their God notice when it's revealed David become Fearless so when I see people frightened and scared when I say mirrors are shaking and they're saying things because they don't want to upset the apple card I know they do have a religion they're just following you see because they don't want to be punished because the food bowl might be taken away and they crack the preaching the convention and if they need the attention of a convention they have to conform to the group theology to fit in but you know what the people have been denied genuine operation of gifts to minister effectively to the people by people trying to tell them what to preach and what inspiration to preach we don't need all of that all of us are different Anthony's different from Isaac from me all the different ministers they're different we want the difference foreign because that difference is how we could get the help you're all sitting here everybody here don't have the same need today man I am preaching here but everybody here don't have the same need then another Minister come and preach and admit this one need another man preach means this one need now a man preachers help this one and help that one and help that one we need help I'll keep reading over and over I read for you he said the Revelation and the Hidden Mysteries are for us to be able to know how to bring the members of our body in subjection to the word to know to conduct ourselves the message is not to just argue and talk about we have Mysteries I know more than you I am a Russian than you I deeper than you I liked it on you I floated on you a man what if I come and tell you this one Falls that one false that will never fall down for dismiss our fault that means our fault that is our fault you know why you're doing there I'm messing everybody up I'm showing you I am the man no I'm not saying that Direct I am seizing that at the subconscious level by messing everybody up like spoiling that off that off that off that off and the way I off at the weight all them off because I seen them off so they are off and if they are off I have to be on no that's that's wrong that's just plain wrong this church have faults of course these are false this church is open critic out there sitting listening to these services I don't like that I don't like that he could have said that he could have said that of course I can say that by not saying that I can't say what you think I see now there come and say it for me send it for me for me to say it so anybody can say what they want because what we are saying we have no private gospel we preach the word that's why after service we could put up on the internet and who want to hear it hear it who don't want to hear it they don't listen to it that's fine but we are free this church is free and I am free to preach the gospel the gospel is not bad news the cosplay is the good news come on saying that somebody the gospel is that bad news about this one and that one all them pastors struggling here's a double minute you didn't having a granted someone in my grand problems because the Holy Ghost not dear so to take the human element they have turned loads of digging ushers spies assistance and Associates people walking helping them nurturing them when I ride home and everything else people almost live in a nutritional so you never wouldn't get to them husbands the same body Church they serve in the church they're like church nuns you know how to say Amen is just the truth Hallelujah and God want to lose you out there to face the music wasn't God do Jesus loose him into the Wilderness Let The Devil tempt him amen do this do that you think God's Sorry God wants to break your spirit yes God went to breakfast be too strong yes God went to break the spirit that he could get a yield in a position where you depend on him it's good to be victorious but sometimes God does bring us to defeat for a purpose defeat this part of God's program I'm not hearing you some of you feeling dumb because you're defeated praise God defeat doesn't mean you're going to stay defeated defeat means Allah that is not the war somebody that is only wrongs number one Gloria Give the Lord a shout you're gonna bounce back You're Gonna Know amen struggling you know I always preach just as the treat of a vision or the prophet brought a vision a home should have a vision but everybody have a vision connected to where we want to go what we want to achieve if a horned of a vision the husband of a vision what the wife helping into it is a man going nowhere man I have no set of purpose man always had a vision because you're not seeking God for vision of where you want to go where you want to be what you want to accomplish because anytime you have purpose and you have a vision that is what will wake you up in the morning and say it is a great day because you are nearer than when your first believer in other words Sarah was a boss is here to get up because here was old and she didn't have a revolution so she had to hear Abraham saying don't worry Sarah you will make it and she promised oh and Abraham's story is I don't know but God said so that's the problem every so often there's a fight for the Abraham and Syria because Sarah don't understand why is Abraham smiling like that because Abraham only seen Isaac and she can't see what he is seeing because she don't have the Revelation he has and that's a problem oh Hallelujah so the stimulation of Revelation that Abraham had Sarah like that oh so when Abraham come home and sing I feel like traveling on ask me something to drink their sister when Abraham's singing that kind of way she don't understand why why you could sing like that when she is feeling old and still go and lie down oh give the Lord some praises oh Hallelujah Oh Glory Hallelujah but you know what anoint Sarah fate when the tree men came to walking it was a hot day it was about 12 o'clock noon and three men came walking and Sarah went to meet some big because Sarah taught by some other man talking and Abraham began to talk to that man and not to say Allah and that man began to talk he said I will return unto you and Syria gonna have that son and Syria last because she was hearing the conversation and the man said why did Sarah laugh and she knew she laughed within herself she knew not a man could have known that she was laughing in her heart that had to be God foreign after that realization Sarah was changed all together because she knew something went between the bone and the marrow something went beyond her spirit and he's still in the very total intents of her heart she knew that was almighty God she knew that was Elohim and everyone said I'm gonna come back not as man anymore but as power as Dynamics in the mechanics and Abraham knew his wife caught the vision come on say Amen somebody just had to wait on the physician but the wife caught the vision and once the pride that's the vision the only written for the visitation but the vision is from appointed time oh I will surely visit you there's gonna be Almighty Mighty visitation oh blessed be the name of the Lord you may be seated oh Hallelujah sometime I want to tell you something you talk about pulsation work on that position that's pay of the moment Joshua did it Mary Magdalene did it when something is revealed to you grab it in the Spear of the moment my work shows my faith your faith is what God sees on you your works is what other people see in you isn't that right so faith that doesn't produce Works anyone has a right to doubt your testimony isn't that right works is married to Faith so if you say you're married raise your husband and you're not producing them we conduct your testimony but once you have faith Works always are wrong Works Express the faith that you have they work together I I Faith Ibraham who is not right you keep testifying is that right hear this part no watch watch he considered not his own body now dead neither dead is a serious home it wasn't even brought under consideration that just shakes me body dead serious womb there and he doesn't even consider that no here we go are you ready everybody ready no circumstances will be considered When Faith Finds Its bed and ground than that no circumstances is considered there was doing coke last night there was smoking marijuana last night that not even considered the doctor said it's the last night tonight not even considered give up not even consider doctors say nothing can be done for you they're not even considered oh that's Wednesday take a hole you're speaking from Faith you're walking from Faith you're talking from Faith you're living from inside Faith by say bye say bye Faith the just shall live by faith oh I could give an example woman came and worship my daughter's next to the devil she walks to be psyched she worship Jesus she just says not fit to take the turns but then casted the dog that didn't pack her up she didn't give up she stood right there where she's going the daughter of Expedia devil if she go back the daughter still gets better she know Jesus could help her she's not going anywhere so instead of saying I'm not going anywhere she said Lord oh she said nothing after the dogs then she bought truth Lord I'm not going Lord keep on talking Lord I'm a dog Lord I'll take whatever remain Lord even the comes Lord Jesus said God I away woman nice his daughter is healed go die away woman like daughter raise him for their sin no prayer she said the right thing come on give the Lord a shelter praise you can say the right thing today inertia not moving you never stand up and change never raise your hands never wish you the reason this I say last five years and this morning you hear about Indonesia and it's still at the same height that is inertia nothing could move you you move it knock you change it not and you're not God that's inertia Hallelujah when you're ready for change oh when you're ready for action see Joshua was an action man David was an action man Mark is 16 chapters in The Book of Mark but he's an action man Jesus did Jesus cast the cast out devil healed the sick action words to do to act not talk some people like the philosophical thing philosophy we want to get into the action path oh Hallelujah no circumstance is considered oh man let me just skip down here remember Joe dad know what happens to read listen to this one he didn't have it as easy as we got today to read the words and see others who took it remember it's only by Revelation Joseph in Genesis there was no Bible Moses or Genesis Leviticus Deuteronomy none of those characters and they had any bible to read until after Moses they didn't have a Bible that we got to help us along in our condition they were rugged men God revealed to them and they stood right there nothing moved them it's once nothing can move you once it revealed to you but you just have to get a little start that's all you have to do just get your faith moving one time and God will do the rest oh hallelujah praise God he said the attitude is what brings the results it's the attitude you take towards God here was a woman touches garment she was healed with a blood issue a soldier spit on his face and no virtue it's your approach the attitude is what it takes and that's what it is tonight dear friend it takes the attitude we are and believe that we are in the presence of Jesus Christ but is our attitude that brings the results the mechanics is here here we go and so is the Dynamics if you can just get started God will do the rest he didn't say get seated he said started in other words you got to get the moving I'm not hearing you that's why he said what we see should make a church that can make a Revival you have got to want it you've got to want to make it yeah I'll make a cake let there be a cake you need eggs milk flour orange peel lime peel no you feel my cake gets booty just reading the book I can make cake too but what I'm saying that you need all the things to mix it together then you beat it bring it in that's not a cake that they mixed you you have to go in the oven and be baked at the right temperature isn't that right I went all that process you get the cake what it went through a process come on say Amen somebody so if we have to get a Revival come on you have to get the right mixture come on they were in the upper room they were praising God continually they have to mix it and blend in that's a blending blending oh hallelujah hallelujah Glory that God has to blend in and I said blending something being created around you and atmosphere is being created either that person being created it attracts the Holy Ghost oh Hallelujah praise the name of the Lord all right praise God Amen you will be seated Hallelujah Oh Glory to God so watch something now as a as watch as God was brilliant bringing Israel out his people a nation a nation out of a Nation a beautiful time of the day God is calling here we go a bride out of a church a Christian bride out of a church isn't that right it's sometimes called the chosen the elected The Remnant it was called the bride the for ordained and so forth isn't that right praise be to Jesus so what Ramadan says that he will call you a side church if you'll only obey him and stay on the word he will place into the church before the coming of Jesus Christ all the powers that was in Christ will be in the church isn't that right God wanted his work done he sent his son his son wanting the work done he sent it into the church a doctor you will know I and the father heal me and I knew isn't that right and the same power that was in Jehovah God rested in Jesus Christ the same power that President Jesus Christ rest in place sons in the body of Christ that's the prophecy isn't it right place another son there will be a power put into the church and now it's coming in that the Holy Spirit Will so anoint the people till they will speak the word I never created self right there like that we haven't seen power likes coming into the church I know it as a fact he knew it was coming the Holy Ghost is going to anoint the people how could the Holy Ghost anoint the people that means the people must become the word because the spirit comes on the word oh Hallelujah glory to God in the beginning was the word isn't that right then the world became flesh and Jill was anointed with the Holy Ghost but he was the word and the bride will become the word then the Holy Ghost have to come upon you the Dynamics will strike you because the Dynamics is for the bride and the church hallelujah it's going to strike you oh Blessed Be of the Lord no he listen to this adoption Ephraim don't want to stay one of them over there we send Manus over there God said well wait a minute I'm supposed to raise oats I'm gonna get corn too you ain't got nothing to do with corn get oats oats is your part to raise you until you're supposed to hurt sheep and you are supposed to hurt cattle God wants to place the church listen carefully I don't want anybody to miss this God wants to place the church but every one of them wants to do the same thing and you can't tell them nothing about that Hallelujah they got that goatee now what God can take a man adopt him into the family and give him something first try that if it is right the Bible said try the spirit so if any Minister pastor Pastor whoever claim whatever claim anything and they don't want to be tried that is not the spirit of God because if you have what is right it could be right try that we're supposed to try the spirits nobody say accept this no try it see if it's right I'm gonna claim a certain thing try it see if it is right if it is right move right with it and say Lord send us something else and that's how God going to place the church isn't that right oh Hallelujah now watch God could have chosen to preach the gospel by the Sun by the Moon by the Stars by window nature but he chose men to preach the gospel and that is where the voice of God will come from and you can judge the voice according to the word it expresses then you can see what kind of voice you're listening to if it is contrary to the word don't listen to it but if it is the word then God is Duty bound to back it up so God will always back up and confirm his word Moses Pharaoh look out the window and saw these bunch of madabas Moses look out the same window and Moses saw Victory he had focused himself though he was a prince he was a Heir but he knowed God promised Abraham that he would visit his people Moses looked out his window and he believed it because Moses looked out by faith and when you are focused with the word of God you are indirectly in line and zurion then that fate of God is in you isn't that right look at the church today God wants us to watch for the supernatural when his word is made manifest and Vindicated now if the devil says for you no wait a minute wait a minute maybe tonight you might be a little bit better when the Revival starts might be fear might be good but don't wait till Revival start become part of Revival right now God wanted started in you how many believe that boy want to start it in the church the holy spirit will take the messenger and send forth a message is not right and this quote I got it from uh pastor but a cliff Chima in Nigeria he said this on why I'm praying for the sick he said I don't come as a fanatic I do not believe in fanaticism I wouldn't stand for it I know you don't believe in financism you believe in the truth here we go and truth will always speak for itself you don't ever have to strain truth truth will always be truth your daughters try to prove truth and think truth no truth will speak for itself I love that oh praise God Amen Hallelujah do you believe that praise God so here we go he said no wonder God can send a Revival he has got nothing to build it on then he will take individuals and build it on them individuals and declare them before the world who will stay with the word from God called man he said we hear all this cry for Revival and so forth and it's uplifting but God made a promise if my people has come by my name shall Ascend themselves together and pray then they'll hear from heaven now this is the other half of what we're talking about the minister card being a Revival but listen to this part and before we can have a Revival God has to call out and train men God train men to carry this message and did he describe the kind of men that they are they don't care what the opposition is they are willing to go into sorry furnace and defeat or to the Lions them or wherever it is because they have been in the presence of God and they know he is whether it's victory or defeat they will stand the same and that's the kind of training God gave his man isn't that right God very seldom calls smart men educated and intellectual they play their part they're great men but usually when God wants the job done it have men who could explain the job they they could explain a job description they could conduct the interview they could explain all what you're supposed to do but when talking about the job done God have certain kind of men to get job done hallelujah my meat is to do the work the will of God and to finish the work in other words I have a job to finish to do it's not right so what's something usually he gets somebody who hardly knows his ABC look to the histories men that are marketed something with God were not men of great education but men who had no education only desire in their heart to serve God he got a plow man he got a shepherd He got fishermen he got hunters and so forth oh what we need is that kind of man today not polished Scholars but men who know God in the power of his resurrection oh bless let's all stand and give God some wish please oh Hallelujah Oh Glory oh praise the name of the Lord oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory to God so let your Works express your faith so we want to have a time of
