[12:21] prayer
[12:24] on
[12:25] sunday after service we got word that
[12:28] brother cosmos madoka his wife
[12:32] went home to be with the lord it was
[12:34] sudden
[12:35] and um
[12:37] we want to remember him and his family
[12:38] in prayer tonight
[12:40] along with
[12:42] sister and his family also
[12:44] that the comfort of god will go out to
[12:46] them grace boyheads close our eyes
[12:50] but we don't know when
[12:53] our name will be called
[12:56] a
[12:57] code of set boundaries that we cannot
[12:59] pass
[13:01] it is set
[13:03] and um
[13:03] [Music]
[13:05] we the scripture declare we shall not
[13:07] hold sleep
[13:09] but we shall be changed
[13:11] speaking about those who are alive and
[13:12] remain
[13:14] so god knows the situation and
[13:17] what he wants to unfold and
[13:19] what he has planned for us and we just
[13:21] have to walk
[13:23] in in his will
[13:25] maduka has been among us
[13:27] i believe twice and coming to the
[13:29] conventions in trinidad and
[13:31] you know his wife and
[13:33] and i know that is a tremendous loss not
[13:35] just for him but also for the church
[13:38] there
[13:39] in lagos nigeria so let's put our heads
[13:42] almighty god we
[13:44] do thank you for
[13:46] your grace lord and your blood and the
[13:49] cross at calvary
[13:51] that has given us the opportunity to
[13:53] cross each other's path
[13:55] without the gospel we would have never
[13:58] known each other
[13:59] or maybe encountered each other lord you
[14:02] made special provisions that
[14:05] we have friends and
[14:07] believers from around the world of light
[14:09] precious faith and father we thank you
[14:12] tonight for their lives and their
[14:13] testimonies in their various countries
[14:15] and to this can we
[14:16] bring brother maduka this family before
[14:19] you that your comfort will
[14:21] go to them lord and
[14:23] ministers of them in a way that
[14:25] that human and flesh and blood can
[14:27] minister
[14:29] remember the lagos church as they go
[14:31] through their own tectonic movement or
[14:33] their own
[14:34] portion of pain
[14:36] as this is what life affords us stress
[14:39] distress
[14:40] and and pain and suffering
[14:43] but through it all we are comforted by
[14:45] your word that
[14:46] romans 8 28 the lord and all things will
[14:49] work together for good to them that love
[14:50] you
[14:51] and we love you father and we created
[14:53] the love of god to reach out to the
[14:55] family and bless them remember the beach
[14:56] and family father visit them in a
[14:59] special way and those that don't know
[15:01] you may they come into the saving
[15:02] knowledge
[15:03] of jesus christ by the witness of your
[15:05] spirit
[15:06] calling them to come home
[15:08] to come to the cross to come to calvary
[15:11] bless this session tonight
[15:13] lord of the word of this bible study and
[15:16] what we will have to share
[15:18] may be an encouragement maybe a
[15:20] soul-searching maybe
[15:23] something to think on a silla rest
[15:25] opposed
[15:26] to think on these things granted father
[15:29] she wait on you
[15:31] in jesus name i ask it amen
[15:33] i want to thank you tonight for coming
[15:35] out and um being here with us
[15:37] to fellowship around the word of god and
[15:40] we certainly do appreciate it tonight
[15:42] and
[15:44] we'll see what the lord will do amen
[15:47] so
[15:50] the prophet said something here one he
[15:52] said here when god wants us to unfold
[15:55] the word
[15:56] we are living in the last days we are
[15:58] trying to linger back on some old church
[16:00] creed
[16:01] we're living in the time
[16:03] that god's great beautiful church ought
[16:05] to be standing on its feet shining like
[16:08] the lily of the family
[16:10] but we are back
[16:12] some say well i belong to presbyterian
[16:14] methodist pentecostal i'm this that what
[16:16] a disgrace
[16:18] you should be unfolding
[16:21] we should be unfolding
[16:24] god's spirit point out not just one
[16:26] little gusher
[16:27] not one little baptism but baptism after
[16:30] baptism
[16:32] not a revelation joshua by faith or
[16:34] sanctification of the gifts of the
[16:35] spirit but revelation after revelation
[16:38] power after power
[16:40] glory after glory we ought to be way up
[16:43] the road ready for the translation
[16:46] and we are lingering back down in all
[16:48] things saying well
[16:50] we keep going back
[16:52] let's
[16:53] go forward
[16:54] and i want to encourage you tonight
[16:56] friends
[16:57] let's go forward
[16:59] regardless of what took place back in
[17:01] your life seek to go forward this is
[17:04] what god wants you to do
[17:06] our scripture here tonight
[17:08] revelation 13 you've got to find it i
[17:10] want to read this here this is our
[17:11] backdrop to what we want to share
[17:13] version 13 says then up i stood upon the
[17:15] sun of the sea and saw a beasts
[17:17] rise up out of the sea
[17:19] having seven heads and ten horns and
[17:21] upon his horns ten horns ten crumbs upon
[17:24] his head the name of blasphemy
[17:28] and the beast which i saw was like on
[17:30] the leopard his feet were at the feet of
[17:32] a beer his mouth as a mother of a lion
[17:35] and the dragon gave him his power and
[17:37] his seat
[17:39] and great authority
[17:41] and i saw one of his heads
[17:43] as it were wounded to death and his
[17:46] deadly wound was healed and all the
[17:47] world wandered after the beast
[17:49] and they worshipped the dragon which
[17:51] gave power unto the beast
[17:53] and they worshipped the beast saying who
[17:55] is like unto the beast who is able to
[17:57] make war with him
[17:58] and there was given unto him among
[18:00] speaking greetings and blasphemies and
[18:03] powers given up to him to continue
[18:05] forty and two months
[18:07] and he opened his mouth in blasphemy
[18:09] against god
[18:11] to blaspheme his name
[18:12] and his tabernacle
[18:14] and them that dwell in heaven
[18:17] and it was given unto him to make war
[18:19] with the saints
[18:21] and to overcome them
[18:23] and power was given him
[18:25] over all kindreds tongues and nations
[18:28] note verse 7 here
[18:30] power
[18:31] was given him
[18:33] over all kindreds
[18:36] and tongues and nations who is him the
[18:39] beast
[18:40] was eight
[18:41] and all that dwell upon the earth shall
[18:44] worship him
[18:45] whose names are not written
[18:48] in the book of life of the lamb
[18:50] slain from the foundation of the world
[18:53] i read that one again and all that dwell
[18:56] upon the earth
[18:57] shall worship him who is him the beast
[19:00] whose names are not written
[19:02] in the book of the life of the lamb
[19:05] slain
[19:06] from the foundation of the world
[19:08] so we have something to thank god
[19:11] tonight
[19:12] if you recognize and understand that he
[19:15] put your name in the lamb's book of life
[19:18] and it is impossible for you to give the
[19:19] beast system
[19:21] any worship at all
[19:23] now what's the name
[19:25] you was thinking about that a name
[19:29] and it has
[19:30] this description a word or set of words
[19:33] by which a person or thing is known
[19:37] addressed or referred that's what a name
[19:39] is
[19:41] a name
[19:42] a person
[19:43] a thing
[19:45] and to this person an individual tonight
[19:48] we want to zero in tonight tonight we
[19:51] want to speak to the individual you as
[19:53] an individual
[19:54] not family
[19:56] or group
[19:59] but you as an individual
[20:02] not one hiding in church
[20:04] or hiding in a prayer group or hiding in
[20:06] a you know
[20:08] the ladies group or men's group or
[20:10] whatever but you
[20:12] as an individual
[20:14] before god
[20:16] now i believe
[20:18] that god has a low meant to feel
[20:21] ministries to feel
[20:24] pastors to feel
[20:26] big guys to feel and fall
[20:30] and i believe
[20:32] it is to ensure that our confidence
[20:36] doesn't rest
[20:37] on the arms of flesh
[20:40] we have seen men crumble and crack and
[20:43] feel and fall over the years
[20:46] and it tells us the god we serve this
[20:49] god who say i hate the deeds of the
[20:51] nicoletas he hate men that
[20:54] would conquer his people
[20:57] and we know that
[20:59] the church and the body of believers is
[21:02] not tools or to be tools in the hands of
[21:05] these manipulative men
[21:08] and the bible talk about in the statue
[21:09] of perfect man or shall i say in
[21:11] ephesians 4
[21:13] and one of the objectives of this
[21:15] fightful ministry for the perfection of
[21:18] the saints the work of the ministry
[21:19] edifying the body
[21:21] is is still we all come unity of the
[21:24] faith knowledge of the son of god and to
[21:26] perfect man
[21:28] under the fullness of the measure of the
[21:29] statute of the measure of the study of
[21:30] christ and this other party
[21:32] that
[21:33] we be no more children tossed
[21:37] to and through
[21:39] by the slave of men in conicon and
[21:41] craftiness
[21:43] whereby the line way to deceive now
[21:45] these are not
[21:46] uh
[21:47] irregular bandits and crooks
[21:49] these are crafty ministries men
[21:53] that actually handle the word with craft
[21:56] i don't think it's the man himself i
[21:58] believe the spirits
[22:00] that influence people
[22:02] to handle the word of god and craft
[22:05] deceitfully
[22:06] um
[22:07] command to manipulate people's lives now
[22:13] before i came on tonight i was thinking
[22:15] about truth
[22:17] i was wondering to share something about
[22:20] whole truth
[22:21] you know there's something about having
[22:24] full truth or whole truth there's a
[22:27] reason that it just said do you swear or
[22:30] to tell the whole truth nothing but the
[22:32] truth and only the truth there's a
[22:34] reason for that because you could leave
[22:35] all things
[22:37] and it's not a whole truth
[22:39] you could add things and it's not whole
[22:42] truth
[22:43] so
[22:44] we always look for that balance then
[22:47] it always had the jihad groups
[22:49] the the suicide bombers the extremists
[22:52] in everything extreme to the left
[22:54] extreme to the right
[22:56] but we have been taught
[22:58] to strive to come down in the middle
[23:00] of the road there is always a middle
[23:04] there is always fanatics on both sides
[23:06] it has the
[23:07] the conservative who should i see it the
[23:10] intellectual fanatics the fanatic to our
[23:12] fault in terms of the crimes i've said
[23:14] email i'd have the wild one they will
[23:16] swing on the lights they give them a
[23:18] chance
[23:19] but but we are called
[23:21] not to be a lemon
[23:23] not to be a tangelo but to be orange
[23:26] not sweetie sweetie sweetie
[23:28] not sour sausage but to be a real orange
[23:31] so tonight in looking at
[23:34] this individual
[23:36] um we want to look at abraham
[23:39] and
[23:41] i want you to note
[23:43] how
[23:44] the bible
[23:46] fleshes out this character called
[23:48] abraham as an individual
[23:51] and
[23:53] god called abraham out of the whole
[23:55] world of people why because ibraheem is
[23:58] better no it's grace
[24:00] god's chosen election
[24:03] and call
[24:05] you are
[24:07] what you are
[24:08] because the grace of god has made you
[24:11] what you are
[24:13] if you if you
[24:16] want to remember something tonight or i
[24:17] should say don't forget this tonight
[24:21] you are
[24:22] what you are
[24:24] because
[24:25] the grace of god has made you what you
[24:28] are it's by grace
[24:30] these things are called
[24:32] god are set in the church
[24:36] god has to call you to be a christian
[24:39] let me repeat that it's from the prophet
[24:42] god has to call you
[24:44] to be a christian
[24:47] god called abraham
[24:49] and he elected him not because he was
[24:51] better than somebody else
[24:53] but because god has called him
[24:56] and this is for christians
[24:59] then after god called him
[25:02] the first thing i want you to do is
[25:04] separate yourself
[25:06] that is what god calls
[25:07] for today
[25:09] so a genuine call of god
[25:13] is reflected
[25:15] by
[25:16] the call to separation
[25:19] because god don't ever call you and say
[25:21] stay where you are
[25:23] when the call of god goes to you
[25:26] it always calls you out of what you're
[25:28] in
[25:29] because that is why you come to call
[25:32] not stay where you are you're blessed
[25:34] and you have no stress and you're good
[25:35] and everything is nice no no
[25:37] you're in the wrong place
[25:40] in the wrong atmosphere
[25:42] in the wrong position
[25:44] come out
[25:45] if you stay where you are you'll be
[25:46] destroyed
[25:48] if you stay where you are things will
[25:50] fall apart
[25:51] so i'm calling you out
[25:53] to show you alone to give you allah
[25:57] to give you a promise this was god's
[25:59] approach to abraham no
[26:02] in chapter 11 of genesis
[26:05] it gives
[26:06] at the end india gives the background of
[26:08] ibraheem lineage
[26:11] and
[26:12] they talk about neho
[26:14] we got terror terror live 70 years we
[26:17] got ibrahim neho and hiran
[26:20] we find out that hiran
[26:22] and and abraham and neo took them wives
[26:24] the name of even what was sirai name of
[26:27] niho's wife was milka name of hiran the
[26:29] father of milka and the father of iska
[26:31] and syria was barren and she had no
[26:33] child
[26:34] and lot was the son of herod
[26:37] sun
[26:38] right
[26:39] and that is how the ending of
[26:42] chapter 11 closes off
[26:45] all of a sudden
[26:46] in genesis chapter 12
[26:49] of verse 1
[26:50] it
[26:51] it it goes here now the lord had said
[26:53] unto abraham get thee out of their
[26:55] country and from thy kindred and from my
[26:57] father's house onto a land i will show
[27:00] thee
[27:00] so it wasn't as if god gave him a
[27:02] blueprint a map a treaty a picture on a
[27:05] video of this land and trying to
[27:07] stimulate abraham after you see it you
[27:10] see it you see it look look at the trees
[27:11] in it look the food's in it no
[27:14] he said onto a land
[27:16] i will show you
[27:17] so you see it yet right it was true and
[27:20] i will make thee a great nation
[27:22] i will bless thee
[27:24] and make thy name great
[27:26] and doubt shall be a blessing i will
[27:28] bless them that bless thee and cursed
[27:30] him that cursed thee and indeed shall
[27:33] all the families of the earth be blessed
[27:36] that's all go tell abraham come out i
[27:38] will bless you
[27:39] i'll show you the land
[27:41] i'll bless them that bless you curse
[27:43] them i kiss you
[27:44] verse 4 and abraham departed as the lord
[27:46] had spoken unto him a lot went with him
[27:49] ivan was 70 and five years old when he
[27:52] departed out of here
[27:54] so abraham
[27:55] watch the action of fate at work because
[27:58] that's what we want to get into tonight
[27:59] and drain them a bit
[28:01] this action of faith make abraham leave
[28:04] his comfort zone leave his known world
[28:07] leave friends environments
[28:10] um
[28:10] fellowships um whatsapp groups whatever
[28:14] he left it watched and departed of the
[28:17] heron he took sarah his wife was five
[28:20] unlocked his brother's son and all their
[28:22] substance that they had gathered and the
[28:24] souls that they had gotten in here and
[28:26] they went forth to go into the land of
[28:28] canaan and into the land of canaan the
[28:31] king
[28:32] and abraham passed through the land unto
[28:34] the priests of shechem under the plain
[28:36] of mori and then canaanite was then in
[28:39] the land
[28:40] and the lord appeared to abraham and
[28:42] said and said unto thy seed will i give
[28:46] this land
[28:48] and dear
[28:49] builded an altar unto the lord
[28:53] who appeared unto him
[28:55] so now
[28:56] we want to go into our substantive
[28:58] scripture for tonight romans 4.
[29:01] and i call this a study of
[29:04] romans 4 study of faith counted for
[29:06] righteousness romans 4
[29:09] we want to go if you have your bibles
[29:10] going wanna go to romans chapter four
[29:12] tonight
[29:13] at first you wanna read
[29:15] from one to ten and we would take it
[29:17] down the track
[29:18] and see what the lord will have for us
[29:20] tonight praise the lord romans chapter
[29:22] four
[29:24] what shall we then see
[29:26] that abram or father aspecting into the
[29:28] flesh had found
[29:30] for if abraham were justified by works
[29:32] he had way of the glory not before god
[29:35] but what saith the scripture
[29:37] abraham believed god
[29:39] and it was counted for him for
[29:41] righteousness
[29:43] now to him that wicket
[29:45] is the reward
[29:47] not reckon of grace but of debt
[29:50] okay
[29:51] now that
[29:53] all right we continue
[29:56] but to him that will get not
[29:59] but believe it on him that justified the
[30:02] ungodly this is a big one
[30:05] his fate
[30:06] is counted for righteousness
[30:10] even as david also described it the
[30:12] blessedness of the man
[30:14] under whom god imputed righteousness
[30:18] without works
[30:20] and then paul here in verse 7 is quoting
[30:23] david saying blessed are thee
[30:26] whose iniquities are forgiven and whose
[30:28] sins are covered
[30:30] blessed is the man to whom the lord will
[30:34] not impute sin commit this blessedness
[30:37] then upon the circumcision only or upon
[30:39] the uncircumcision also
[30:41] for we say that faith
[30:44] was reckoned to abraham for
[30:46] righteousness
[30:47] then how was it then reckon how was
[30:51] the fate
[30:53] how was righteousness attributed to
[30:56] abraham's feet when he was in
[30:58] circumcision or in uncircumcision
[31:01] not in on not in circumcision but in
[31:04] uncircumcision
[31:06] and he received here we go the sign of
[31:09] circumcision and this is where the holy
[31:11] ghost comes in
[31:13] a seal
[31:14] of the righteousness of the faith which
[31:17] he had
[31:19] yet
[31:20] being uncircumcised
[31:22] so this is not faith
[31:24] when you go to church
[31:25] this is faith before you reach the
[31:27] church
[31:27] this is faith
[31:29] that you had as a sinner this is faith
[31:31] that god put inside of you because the
[31:33] cornerstone of fate
[31:35] was leading you
[31:36] guess where guess when before
[31:39] the foundation of the world
[31:41] so before the foundation of the world
[31:44] god put
[31:45] that
[31:46] seed inside of you that gene inside of
[31:49] you that germ inside of you something
[31:51] inside of you that could make you
[31:53] respond
[31:54] that's what we've seen here's the night
[31:55] he received a sign of circumcision a
[31:58] seal
[31:59] of the righteousness of the fate which
[32:01] he had
[32:02] yet being uncircumcised that he might be
[32:06] the father of all them that believe
[32:08] though they be not circumcised
[32:11] that righteousness
[32:12] might be imputed unto them also
[32:15] the father of circumcision to them who
[32:17] are not of this exception only but who
[32:20] also walk in the steps of feet
[32:22] of our father abraham which he had being
[32:24] yet uncircumcised
[32:26] here we go for the promise
[32:30] that he should be the heir of the world
[32:33] was not to abraham
[32:36] or to his seed to the law
[32:39] but to the righteousness of faith i want
[32:42] to read from the amplified verse 10 to
[32:44] 13
[32:46] and kind of kept that this part off
[32:48] and it says unlike how it phrased it in
[32:50] verse 10 how then was it credited to him
[32:53] was it before
[32:55] or after he had been circumcised
[32:57] it was not after
[32:59] but before he was circumcised
[33:02] he received the mark of circumcision
[33:05] as a token
[33:07] or
[33:08] an evidence and seal of righteousness
[33:11] where she had by faith while he was he
[33:13] still uncircumcised faith
[33:16] so that he was to be made the father of
[33:18] all who truly believe
[33:20] do without circumcision and who does
[33:23] have righteousness which is right
[33:25] standing with god imputed to them and
[33:27] credited to their comp if loved
[33:30] credited to their come as well as
[33:33] that he made the father of those
[33:36] circumcised persons who are not merely
[33:38] circumcised but also walk
[33:41] in the way of that faith which all
[33:42] father abraham had before he was
[33:44] circumcised for the promise to abraham
[33:48] all his posterity that he should inherit
[33:50] the world did not come true observing
[33:52] commands of the law
[33:54] but through the righteousness
[33:56] of faith may god bless
[33:58] his word you love him tonight
[34:01] i trust that this would assist you
[34:03] tonight
[34:04] in this fate walk and it is a feet walk
[34:07] and i want to emphasize again
[34:10] we are addressing the individual we're
[34:12] not addressing you and your mother you
[34:14] and your father you and your husband you
[34:15] and your wife you and your children you
[34:18] are the family and you're in the church
[34:20] no we're not talking about
[34:22] talking about you
[34:23] as an individual and when you see
[34:26] yourself as an individual it doesn't
[34:28] matter husband
[34:30] wife children mother father uncle aunt
[34:33] it doesn't matter
[34:34] it matters
[34:36] where you are standing with god
[34:39] that is what matters tonight
[34:41] genesis chapter 17
[34:44] we want to read
[34:47] this go down into genesis chapter 17
[34:50] chapter 17 when abraham was 99 years old
[34:53] and nine
[34:55] so this is quite some time from 75
[34:58] almost 24 okay
[35:00] and the lord appeared to abraham abraham
[35:03] and said i am
[35:05] the almighty god
[35:07] now he's an old man but look at the
[35:10] address called given walk before me
[35:12] and be thou perfect
[35:15] and i will make my covenant between me
[35:17] and thee
[35:18] i will multiply thee exceeding me now
[35:20] this is a barren man
[35:22] this is a man wife is barren this man is
[35:24] old he can't have children and god is
[35:27] speaking to him
[35:28] i will make my covenant between me and
[35:30] thee and multiply thee exceedingly and
[35:33] abram fell on his face and god talked
[35:35] with him saying as for me behold my
[35:38] covenant is with thee and thou shalt be
[35:40] a father of many nations
[35:43] not a father of children a father of
[35:45] many nations neither shall thy name
[35:48] anymore be called abram but thy name
[35:50] shall be abraham
[35:52] for a father
[35:54] of many nations have i made thee it's
[35:57] finished in god's mind it is finished in
[35:59] his thinking
[36:01] verse 6 and i will make thee exceeding
[36:03] fruitful i will make nations of thee and
[36:07] kings shall come out of me and i will
[36:09] establish my covenant between me and
[36:11] thee thy seed after thee in their
[36:14] generations plural for an everlasting
[36:17] covenant to be a god unto thee until i
[36:19] see it after thee and i will give unto
[36:21] thee until thy seed after thee the land
[36:24] wherein the water stranger
[36:26] all the land of canaan for an
[36:28] everlasting possession and i will be
[36:31] their god
[36:32] and quote unto abraham though shall keep
[36:34] my covenant therefore dull and thy seed
[36:37] after thee in their generations this is
[36:40] my covenant which you shall keep between
[36:43] me and you and thy seed after thee every
[36:46] man child among you shall
[36:49] be circumcised or shall receive the holy
[36:52] ghost back to the holy ghost and he
[36:54] shall circumcise the flesh of your
[36:56] foreskin it shall be a token of the
[36:58] covenant between mixed near you and he
[37:01] that is eight years old shall be
[37:02] circumcised among you every man child in
[37:05] your generations he that is born in the
[37:07] house or bought with money of any
[37:09] stranger which is not of thy seed he
[37:11] that is born in thy house he that is
[37:13] brought with thy money must needs be
[37:15] circumcised and my covenant shall be
[37:18] in your flesh for an everlasting
[37:21] covenant
[37:22] isn't that something so god
[37:25] and this was a natural land he was
[37:27] bringing abram to
[37:28] it was a whole natural satan
[37:31] and god give a natural
[37:34] cutting of the flesh
[37:35] in order
[37:37] to show a token evidence that this is a
[37:40] covenant between me and you
[37:42] between abraham and god and his seed
[37:45] after him so it was it was from one land
[37:48] the land that abram was in to canaan
[37:50] natural land to natural land but but we
[37:54] know where we are at that god call us
[37:57] into a spiritual baptism because the
[37:59] holy ghost really is our land in this
[38:01] time
[38:02] of either one land of promise isn't that
[38:05] right amen praise the lord
[38:08] so now we want to look at the covenant
[38:11] that god gave abraham and do you find
[38:13] that covenant is in genesis chapter 50.
[38:16] you go to slip to genesis chapter 15
[38:19] and uh you will find out what the lord
[38:21] spoke to abraham abraham reaction this
[38:24] was the very beginning
[38:26] of god really sticking
[38:28] giving abraham this jab this jab of this
[38:30] promised son coming to him
[38:32] after these things genesis 15 verse 1
[38:36] the word of the lord came unto abraham
[38:38] in a vision saying fear not ibrahim his
[38:41] name is not changed here yet i am thy
[38:43] shield
[38:45] an exceeding great reward
[38:47] so this is what god speak to abraham
[38:50] and abraham said lord god what will dog
[38:52] give me seen i go childless
[38:54] and the steward of my house is this
[38:57] elise of damascus
[38:59] abraham said behold to me that was given
[39:02] no seed and no one born in my house is
[39:05] my ear
[39:07] and behold the word of the lord came on
[39:09] them saying this shall not be done here
[39:12] but he
[39:13] that shall comfort out of their own
[39:15] bowels
[39:16] shall be dying here
[39:19] and you know
[39:21] sometimes
[39:22] we are challenged we are challenged
[39:25] about our own selves
[39:27] many times it eases a belief for
[39:29] somebody else than to believe for your
[39:30] own self you're praying for this one
[39:32] you're praying for that one you believe
[39:33] koga heal this one lord god bless this
[39:35] one but you're not believing god will
[39:37] bless you god will heal you or deliver
[39:39] you
[39:40] you believe that this one will get
[39:41] delivered you believe this one will get
[39:43] a breakthrough you believe that
[39:45] everybody else but not you why
[39:48] why is it so difficult to believe
[39:51] god
[39:52] speaking to you as an individual and he
[39:55] means what he says
[39:57] god wasn't generalizing
[39:59] god told abraham i am thy she
[40:03] i am thy exceeding great reward
[40:08] god told abraham this shall not be thine
[40:11] ear
[40:12] but he that shall comfort out of thine
[40:15] own bowel shall be done here
[40:17] this fight and he brought him forth
[40:19] abroad and said look now towards heaven
[40:21] and tell the stars if they'll be able to
[40:23] number them he said unto him so shall i
[40:26] see be
[40:27] and this is the path
[40:29] and he believed in the lord
[40:33] and he commented it to him
[40:36] for righteousness
[40:37] so god took abraham faith
[40:41] and pronounced him
[40:43] righteous
[40:45] based upon his fate
[40:47] trust
[40:48] confidence reliance on god
[40:51] what an exchange tonight
[40:53] that god could take your faith
[40:56] and pronounce you as righteous
[40:58] because of that fate
[41:01] now
[41:02] this fate
[41:03] is the original fate this is the same
[41:06] fate that noah had
[41:08] when noah couldn't explain how this
[41:10] flood was going to come and all know i
[41:12] could rely on is god said so
[41:15] when the scientists come and said
[41:17] we never come from heaven before and
[41:19] this and that and all the explanation
[41:21] and the scientific facts that they have
[41:23] all naw could rest back on
[41:25] is god said so
[41:27] how could abraham explain
[41:30] that his body will be changed or
[41:32] transformed to produce isa
[41:35] how could abram explain
[41:37] that syrah will be changed he couldn't
[41:40] all he could say is god said so
[41:42] could you come to that spot
[41:45] where you could receive the promises of
[41:47] god and just say god said so and count
[41:49] your feelings your flesh
[41:51] whatever come as a lie
[41:53] and believe god would to be true
[41:56] and become a daughter of abraham a son
[41:58] of abraham
[41:59] that's tackled not at the promise of god
[42:02] do you
[42:03] think
[42:05] that there will be people like that i i
[42:08] do i do because ghost and a prophet to
[42:10] turn our hearts back to the feet of the
[42:12] fathers and after luke 17 you get luke
[42:14] 18 and in luke 18 the question was asked
[42:16] jesus asking when the son of man
[42:18] committed shall he find faith and in
[42:20] other words things would be so messed up
[42:22] fatally so scarce because i'll tell you
[42:24] something one thing
[42:26] that you could see evidence of faith is
[42:28] praise and worship one thing that you
[42:31] will always see where fit is present you
[42:33] will always see an atmosphere of praise
[42:36] and thanksgiving because fate is the
[42:39] equivalent of that dollar or that money
[42:41] to buy the bread so even though you
[42:43] don't have the bread yet even though you
[42:45] don't go you haven't reached the bakery
[42:47] yet you have the purchasing power of the
[42:49] bread so therefore you could rejoice
[42:52] you have to journey to the bakery to get
[42:54] the bread but you have the money you
[42:55] can't eat the money you can't give away
[42:57] the money that money is to purchase the
[42:59] bread you exchange the fate and you get
[43:01] the bread
[43:02] but because
[43:03] you have the money you could rejoice
[43:05] because all you're waiting for is to get
[43:07] the bread faith is the substance of what
[43:09] you're hoping for is the evidence of
[43:11] what you have not seen that's what faith
[43:12] is so isaac was booted into abraham's
[43:15] spirit he couldn't show isaac to sarah
[43:19] because god didn't speak to her faith
[43:20] come by hearing and hearing the word the
[43:22] word came to abraham so abraham had a
[43:25] bit of faith syrah did not have that but
[43:28] god told abraham seerah is true syria
[43:31] you're going to have that son so he had
[43:33] was to believe not only for himself but
[43:36] believe for his wife also so he had a
[43:38] double challenge on his hand to believe
[43:40] god for himself and that is why tonight
[43:43] you
[43:44] have to begin to see yourself as an
[43:46] individual to your between the bed one
[43:49] taking one left two in a few one taking
[43:51] one left you have to begin to see do you
[43:54] have the faith i'm not talking about
[43:55] your husband praying for you i'm not
[43:57] sure about your wife praying for you i'm
[43:58] just going to church praying for you i
[43:59] talk about you yourself having defeat
[44:02] that was once delivered to the saints or
[44:04] defeat to go to this rapture or the fate
[44:07] and make it to be one of those who are
[44:08] alive and remain
[44:10] oh praise the lord tonight
[44:12] or do you get it praise the lord and i
[44:13] hope tonight that this is helpful to you
[44:16] so then
[44:17] uh verse four you can just go over that
[44:20] and behold the word of the lord came at
[44:22] him saying
[44:23] um okay no and he believed in the lord
[44:26] who's six and he counted it to him or
[44:29] righteousness and he said unto him
[44:31] and look how god speaks
[44:33] i am the lord
[44:35] that brought thee out of the earth of
[44:38] the chaldeans
[44:39] to give d to this land inherited
[44:42] and you could take it personal
[44:43] i am the lord that brought you out of
[44:46] adultery or lion or the bar or drinking
[44:50] or smoking or the world i am the lord
[44:53] that brought you out of the ear of
[44:55] charlie's to give thee this land to
[44:57] inherit it
[44:58] and he said lord god whereby shall i
[45:01] know i shall inherit it that's a
[45:03] beautiful question
[45:04] he wanted a confirmation of this
[45:07] inheritance
[45:08] so all this now a realm of faith and
[45:10] around the spirit and he said unto me
[45:12] take me a half of three years old she go
[45:14] three years old around three years old
[45:17] turtle love young pigeon he took unto
[45:19] them all these
[45:21] divine enemies made each piece one
[45:24] against the other but the birds divided
[45:26] it not
[45:27] when the falls came upon the carcasses
[45:29] ibrahim drew them away
[45:30] bush 12 and when the sun was going down
[45:33] a deep sleep fell upon abram and lua
[45:35] horror
[45:36] of great darkness fell on upon him so
[45:38] he's going into vision and god is
[45:40] speaking to him about the darkness
[45:42] speaking them about his experience he
[45:44] said unto abram no of a surety
[45:47] this is sure
[45:49] that thy seed
[45:51] shall be a stranger in a land that is
[45:53] not the earth
[45:54] and shall save them
[45:56] and they shall afflict them 400 years
[46:00] and also that nation whom they shall
[46:02] save will i judge
[46:03] and afterwards shall they come out with
[46:05] great substance
[46:06] and thou shalt go to thy fathers in
[46:08] peace
[46:09] though shall be buried in good old age
[46:12] but in the fourth generation they shall
[46:13] come here again
[46:15] for the iniquity of the amorites
[46:17] is not yet full so by this scripture
[46:19] here you could understand that god
[46:21] doesn't just work
[46:23] in a haphazard manner
[46:25] he is waiting for the iniquity of the
[46:27] amorites to be full verse 17 came to
[46:30] pass but when the sun went down it was
[46:32] dark they were smoking fullness fire
[46:35] right a burning lamb that passed through
[46:36] those pieces
[46:38] in the same day
[46:39] the lord made a covenant with abraham so
[46:42] what is happening here something
[46:43] supernatural is taking place here it has
[46:46] nothing to do with human this has to do
[46:47] with the light the burning lamp
[46:50] the white light the light of elohim the
[46:52] light of the holy spirit
[46:54] so in other words something supernatural
[46:58] this is abraham's experience it's not a
[47:00] group experience it's not a church
[47:02] experience this is not the pastor's
[47:04] experience this is abraham's experience
[47:07] in the same day the lord made a covenant
[47:09] with abraham saying unto thy seed have i
[47:12] given this land from the river of egypt
[47:15] unto the great river the river euphrates
[47:17] and god gave details the canites
[47:19] canazites cadmium knights hittites
[47:22] perizzites reaffirms amorites canaanites
[47:25] gershoscites jebusites
[47:27] oh blessed be the name of the lord so
[47:29] god lifted all these things to show
[47:32] the land the details of the land that he
[47:34] used to take so let's continue now
[47:36] switch back to rumors you want to
[47:37] continue romans 13
[47:40] to 25.
[47:42] want to continue of that same scripture
[47:43] romans 4
[47:45] 13-25
[47:47] oh blessed be the name of the lord could
[47:49] we give you god some praises tonight
[47:51] hallelujah hallelujah see what i said
[47:54] about faith
[47:55] one thing you could see
[47:57] these scriptures say says am i going to
[47:59] read it here now
[48:00] okay verse 13. for the promise
[48:03] that he should be heir of the world was
[48:06] not to abraham or to a seed to the law
[48:10] but through the righteousness of faith
[48:11] that's verse 13
[48:13] 14 run over forward
[48:15] and if d which are of the lobby ears
[48:18] fate is made void so it doesn't make
[48:21] sense having faith
[48:23] if
[48:24] keeping the law make your ear so it's
[48:26] saying faith is made void and the
[48:28] promise made of non-effect
[48:30] because for safety
[48:32] the law will get wrath for where no law
[48:34] is there is no transgression
[48:37] therefore it is a faith for 16 that it
[48:39] might be by grace
[48:41] here we go therefore it's what
[48:43] it is a faith reason that it might be by
[48:46] grace that would reason again therefore
[48:48] it is a fate that
[48:50] it might be by grace now the holy ghost
[48:54] alone
[48:56] alone
[48:57] is the divine
[48:59] revealer of the revelation of jesus
[49:02] christ
[49:03] so when you see my pastors and men
[49:05] pumping that they're revealing this and
[49:07] revealing that
[49:08] that is foolishness they could preach
[49:10] but they can't really reveal they could
[49:12] speak the word but revelation and that
[49:15] is what the church is built upon
[49:17] the church is not built upon knowledge
[49:20] the church is built upon
[49:22] peter gave it
[49:24] he said though had the christ the son of
[49:25] the living god the fact was
[49:27] if the key was given to what by what
[49:30] jesus said flesh and blood hath not
[49:32] revealed it's unto you so that is why
[49:35] the revelation of jesus christ can be
[49:38] made known in the most
[49:41] illiterate prison
[49:43] that is why
[49:44] you don't even have to have an education
[49:46] to get revelation how many standards
[49:49] tonight
[49:50] you don't have to have a degree you
[49:52] don't have to pass common entrance you
[49:53] don't have to even ever go to school and
[49:55] you could have divine revelation that is
[49:57] why the bible described peter and they
[49:59] as ignorant and unlearned
[50:02] but they had to take note that they've
[50:03] been with jesus because it's the holy
[50:06] ghost revealing it to you
[50:08] it has nothing to do with flesh and
[50:10] blood it has to do with the operation of
[50:12] the spirit
[50:13] so the spirit
[50:15] who know you by name
[50:17] hallelujah and a name is an individual
[50:20] hallelujah not a group not a group named
[50:22] an individual john jones harry whatever
[50:25] it is it's the individual when god
[50:27] called you by name john
[50:28] andrew philip peter all our names
[50:32] so god doesn't call you as a group
[50:35] gentiles
[50:36] god call you as an individual so when
[50:39] you think about that that means you
[50:41] could have your own personal revival
[50:43] tonight you can have your personal
[50:46] dynamics your personal presence your
[50:48] personal witness of the spirit your
[50:50] rainbow could come down the glory of god
[50:52] will come over you tonight right in your
[50:54] home
[50:55] and that has nothing to do with anybody
[50:57] else in the zoom room
[50:59] you are in a zone all by yourself as a
[51:02] son as a daughter of god blessed by god
[51:05] called by god elected by god
[51:08] predestinated by god whose name on the
[51:10] land local life before the foundation of
[51:12] the world and the devil can't do
[51:13] anything about it he can't take your joy
[51:15] he can't take your peace he can't take a
[51:17] revelation because jesus is upon this
[51:19] rock i will build my church and jesus
[51:21] can't lie if there's one thing we know
[51:22] jesus can't lie he said that the gates
[51:24] of hell shall not reveal against it's
[51:26] impossible think about it now they could
[51:28] break down the church building but they
[51:30] can't break down the revelation because
[51:32] the revelation is god himself that you
[51:34] heard from heaven you heard from your
[51:36] tiophone you heard from the spirit
[51:38] itself and that gives you the assurance
[51:40] in your heart
[51:42] oh my i can say the rapture is a
[51:44] revelation he said the bride of christ
[51:46] is waiting for the referee so if they
[51:48] react to the revelation which church
[51:49] could have that think about it it's so
[51:51] foolish join here come here come here
[51:53] which church would give the
[51:55] revolutionary rapture they can't that
[51:57] comes from god the church the pride is
[51:59] written for revelation of the rapture
[52:01] and i'll keep saying the rapture is in
[52:03] you it has to be inside of you just as
[52:05] the kingdom is inside of you and when
[52:07] the big magnet of the dynamics or the
[52:10] charity of the holy ghost or the voices
[52:11] of angel when they come to pick up you
[52:13] can only pick up those that magnetize it
[52:16] oh hallelujah oh being for tremendous
[52:18] time i tell you friends we in fact
[52:20] tremendous time this word from the
[52:22] prophet small cannot return void it's
[52:24] impossible he stood there for all these
[52:26] years speaking and we wasn't even wrong
[52:28] yet some of us was even born yet but he
[52:30] was speaking for us because he knew we
[52:32] would come he's a prophet he went up
[52:34] into the knowledge of god seed on the
[52:36] road dropped back down and said i
[52:38] believe the bride is called i see the
[52:39] bright seal into the kingdom she's
[52:41] waiting on dynamics and so on he see you
[52:43] so you guys sit down there like a lump
[52:45] and a log like in your old age and
[52:47] you're saying like you're dying like you
[52:49] were dead you don't make it or what kind
[52:50] of thing you can't go like that think
[52:52] about this man called abraham he was old
[52:54] and god said walk before me be not
[52:56] perfect not because you're old you had
[52:57] to walk like a sucker not because you're
[52:59] all gotta walk like if you're
[53:02] you're losing your mind or something so
[53:03] like that god still demands perfection
[53:06] because that is what where we come from
[53:08] come for something that is perfect you
[53:09] want us to go back to that we only
[53:11] bypass our tea offending our word buddy
[53:13] to be tempted here are the only purpose
[53:15] that is the only reason we we are how we
[53:18] are we bypass that word part that of any
[53:21] part is is come from taught the flesh in
[53:24] order to be tested and the reason god
[53:26] could say have you considered my seven
[53:28] job is because he knew that what in job
[53:30] the devil don't know the devil don't
[53:32] have a revelation with son of joke he
[53:33] thinks it's all these natural things
[53:35] he's not your blessing because bless his
[53:37] people you know what god blesses
[53:38] blessing what god bless is properly
[53:40] blessed and when god put his hand upon
[53:42] you nobody can take but change that
[53:44] blessing i don't care what they say i've
[53:46] seen it over the years people curse
[53:48] people expect you to fall you look in
[53:50] the waiting and you snake that bit pole
[53:52] you're waiting for it to drop down
[53:53] you're waiting for it to freeze up and
[53:55] you went to hell you went through all
[53:56] kind of thing but you're still alive
[53:58] today you're still pressing forward
[53:59] today you still have an anchor you still
[54:01] have a anchor to your soul people crash
[54:04] ships wreck and you're still sealing
[54:06] through and people want to know how your
[54:08] boat making sure you see you're both
[54:09] leaning so lean this way and what kind
[54:11] of thing but you're still making it true
[54:12] for the anchor whole
[54:14] that won't have to be christ
[54:17] gonna be a man you cannot be a pastor
[54:19] let me say good cannot be a
[54:22] evangelist it cannot be apostle and
[54:24] prophet it cannot be flesh and blood it
[54:26] has to be the holy spirit himself
[54:28] god himself
[54:29] oh glory to god man just parisian is
[54:32] beef in front of they presenting
[54:34] themselves and when they crack up and
[54:35] they fall under people lose faith and
[54:38] they think they're overthrown they call
[54:39] it trust present man and when isaiah was
[54:42] leaning on king uzziah and god removed
[54:45] king uzziah by judgment let me say it
[54:47] good when god removed
[54:50] king uzziah by judgment and as i have
[54:52] run into the temple and then god gave
[54:54] him a supernatural experience he said i

[56:12] abraham this man that stood for
[56:15] righteousness and stood for faith and
[56:17] leave his country leave a safe zone as a
[56:20] problem a lot of you you like to stay

[56:52] for if verse 14
[56:54] they which are of the lord be heirs fate
[56:56] is made void from his speed of
[56:57] non-effect because the law will get
[56:59] wrath and where no law is there is no
[57:02] transgression therefore it is a fate
[57:04] that is made by greece to the end the
[57:06] promise might be sure to all the seed
[57:09] not only the witches of the law but that
[57:12] also which is of the fate of abraham was
[57:14] the father of paul how else could
[57:16] revelation 22 17 be effective if not for
[57:20] the grace of god
[57:21] in this hour of judgment
[57:24] god put a blood cord
[57:26] god put a hidden mystery
[57:28] brought put in revelation in revelation
[57:30] 22 17 and the spirit and the bright side
[57:33] come
[57:34] that is for our loved ones
[57:36] that is for our family amidst judgment
[57:40] the monk zion will be the bride and the
[57:42] bride will have the blood of jesus the
[57:44] bride of the spirit itself the bride
[57:47] will pack the mercy seat for the final
[57:49] time
[57:50] just say the spirit and the bright say
[57:53] come here we go let him not hear it say
[57:55] come and whosoever will that is where
[57:58] they come in let him come and take up
[58:00] the water of life freely
[58:02] you
[58:03] as the bride of jesus christ
[58:05] will be unfolding the living fountain
[58:08] their teaching well the everlasting
[58:10] fountain to your own loved ones and they
[58:13] will come in
[58:14] not because of their works right now
[58:16] they wearing short pants hot pants
[58:17] earring tattoo whatever they have
[58:20] right the off off-key right now but
[58:22] because of the grace of god
[58:24] the fountain will be opened up to them
[58:26] and it's their choice to respond the
[58:27] spirit and the bride say come
[58:30] right now we say come they say what come
[58:32] to church they're not interested in that
[58:34] they're really not interested in the
[58:35] church but you see when the darkness
[58:37] covered you
[58:38] growth darkness covered the people
[58:40] and if the bible says mr arise and time
[58:42] for thy light has come
[58:43] and you could unlock the founding
[58:46] the fountain that the spirit will flow
[58:47] freely and they see that they are
[58:50] running straight to them
[58:51] and this is the joy that we have like
[58:54] the lily
[58:55] pressing from the muck and the maya and
[58:57] all the old tires and all the old filth
[59:00] coming down the stream and you are just
[59:02] hitting here all kind of thing hitting
[59:04] by you keep pushing pushing pushing and
[59:07] you're pressing upwards because you have
[59:09] some flower to unfold you have
[59:11] revelation to unfold it has spirit to
[59:14] unfold and then bees out there waiting
[59:17] to see something unfold to come and
[59:18] partake of the nectar of this love of
[59:21] god they're gonna be flowing from the
[59:22] heart of this bride of jesus christ
[59:24] isn't he wonderful tonight so what's
[59:26] something
[59:27] therefore it is a fate that's might by
[59:30] grace verse 17 as it is written i have
[59:32] made thee a father of many nations
[59:34] before him
[59:35] whom he believed even god
[59:37] who quick net the dead
[59:39] and call it those things which be not as
[59:41] though they were who against hope
[59:44] believe in hope that he might become the
[59:46] father of many nations according to that
[59:48] which was spoken so shall my seed be
[59:51] and being not weak and faith here we go
[59:53] saints
[59:54] being not weak in faith
[59:57] he considered not his own body now dead
[1:00:00] nobody anybody did it
[1:00:02] when he was about a hundred years old
[1:00:05] neither the deadness of savior's room
[1:00:07] and this is the bomb here
[1:00:09] he staggered not
[1:00:11] at the promise of god
[1:00:13] true unbelief
[1:00:15] but was strong in faith
[1:00:17] giving
[1:00:18] glory
[1:00:19] to god
[1:00:21] you mean brother
[1:00:23] evidence of the strength of your faith
[1:00:26] is in evidence by the praises and the
[1:00:29] glory that you give to god yes
[1:00:32] exactly
[1:00:34] you know that when you fall insane you
[1:00:35] can't worship
[1:00:36] you get banged
[1:00:38] you get dumb
[1:00:39] because you get condemned condemnation
[1:00:42] in your heart
[1:00:43] and the devil himself is sitting on your
[1:00:44] shoulder and telling you who you
[1:00:45] praising god your hypocrite look what
[1:00:47] you do
[1:00:48] and until you get that out your system
[1:00:50] you're in trouble
[1:00:52] your spirit is not free
[1:00:54] you see but when you repent you make
[1:00:56] things right it gets off your shoulder
[1:00:59] then you have to limit the time to your
[1:01:00] lord your love of god over your soul
[1:01:02] because you know the mercy of god has
[1:01:04] returned back to your life
[1:01:06] david was feeling terrible
[1:01:08] terrible
[1:01:09] and david said restore unto me the joy
[1:01:11] of my salvation oh god i said but oh god
[1:01:14] i lost my joy oh god help me it's
[1:01:16] pressure
[1:01:17] it seemed david said i was glad that he
[1:01:19] said unto me let us go to your house you
[1:01:20] know what when db57 are boxing condition
[1:01:23] he had no glad
[1:01:25] he asked water restore
[1:01:28] bring it back bring back the passion
[1:01:31] bring back
[1:01:32] to cry to get in the spirit
[1:01:34] bring back the fervent desire
[1:01:37] to please god so he's taken that to the
[1:01:39] promise of god to unbelief but a strong
[1:01:42] in faith
[1:01:43] giving glory to god
[1:01:45] watch stagger not at what
[1:01:48] the promise of god now what god gave him
[1:01:49] promise that he'd be the father of
[1:01:51] nations he changed his name
[1:01:53] to show that it's
[1:01:54] secure
[1:01:56] it is fixed it's a done deal i'm
[1:01:58] changing the name from
[1:01:59] abram to abraham father of nation
[1:02:03] what is the promise of god let's read
[1:02:06] something here from the prophet
[1:02:07] so you notice before they got to the
[1:02:09] promised land before they were to enter
[1:02:11] afghanistan which will only be a few
[1:02:13] days
[1:02:14] 10 or
[1:02:15] 11 days maybe not that much only 40
[1:02:18] something miles they would have went
[1:02:20] right on into the promised land
[1:02:22] right up to the year every stage of the
[1:02:24] journey that we have walked and they
[1:02:25] come across the red sea fire army was
[1:02:27] drawn behind them they were free from
[1:02:29] the enemies started through the
[1:02:31] wilderness got to the edge of the
[1:02:33] promised land
[1:02:34] that chemist by mia and there they feel
[1:02:37] why
[1:02:38] why
[1:02:40] did they fail
[1:02:41] moses said to the ten tribes you send
[1:02:44] out men of each man of each tribe to
[1:02:46] represent he tried to inspire the land
[1:02:48] to see what kind of condition it was
[1:02:50] i said that's exactly up to this place
[1:02:53] this morning where you come today the
[1:02:55] church has come to justification through
[1:02:57] luther through signification through the
[1:02:59] methodist and now up to the time of the
[1:03:01] promise
[1:03:02] the promise
[1:03:04] is
[1:03:06] the baptism of
[1:03:07] the spirit
[1:03:09] the promise is what
[1:03:11] the baptism
[1:03:13] of the spirit
[1:03:15] don't let nobody fool you
[1:03:17] the female promises have a high
[1:03:19] education
[1:03:21] knowing plenty things
[1:03:23] and because you know more than others
[1:03:25] it puts you on a higher plane
[1:03:28] than others that is
[1:03:30] foolishness
[1:03:31] that has absolutely nothing to do with
[1:03:34] the promise is
[1:03:36] the spirit
[1:03:38] that is what is wrong you shall receive
[1:03:40] power when when after that the holy
[1:03:43] ghost is come upon you
[1:03:46] so the promise
[1:03:47] is to get the holy ghost to come upon
[1:03:49] you
[1:03:50] and it has to have something to bring
[1:03:52] the holy ghost upon you
[1:03:54] there's a ladder
[1:03:56] there is faith and virtue and knowledge
[1:03:58] and temperance and patience and there
[1:04:01] will be kindness and then
[1:04:03] this holy ghost the person of the holy
[1:04:06] ghost comes upon that
[1:04:08] individual
[1:04:10] and then that is christ
[1:04:12] dwelling
[1:04:13] in sons and daughters of god he said
[1:04:15] when that time comes
[1:04:17] then you will see
[1:04:19] vindicated sons and vindicated daughters
[1:04:22] now before that time we are on our way
[1:04:26] we are journeying
[1:04:28] we will be deceiving you if we say we
[1:04:30] are dear
[1:04:31] never children
[1:04:32] say are we are you there yet and i say
[1:04:34] not yet
[1:04:36] are we there yet not yet we have a long
[1:04:38] day
[1:04:39] we get him to go down there that is
[1:04:41] where
[1:04:42] the position is to get here that's what
[1:04:44] we're promising to get there go there
[1:04:47] call out abraham
[1:04:48] to wild him up
[1:04:50] and and and gain a bogus and a
[1:04:52] fraudulent offer of this new land no no
[1:04:55] you give them a specific thing this land
[1:04:58] i'll give it to you when you see that
[1:05:00] that's what god did to give her
[1:05:02] so watch this you know
[1:05:03] the promise
[1:05:05] is
[1:05:07] the baptism of the spirit
[1:05:09] which is promised
[1:05:11] all to the old testament and new to
[1:05:14] the promise and he's identifying the
[1:05:16] promise there's not to you over the same
[1:05:18] islam
[1:05:19] behold
[1:05:20] i send the promise of my father upon you
[1:05:23] and peter said that on a little
[1:05:24] pentecost that is the promise
[1:05:27] and here we go
[1:05:28] the promised land
[1:05:30] is to live
[1:05:32] in this land
[1:05:33] of the holy spirit
[1:05:35] remember some bible let's not be had
[1:05:36] those that in the flesh cannot please
[1:05:38] god
[1:05:39] remember that
[1:05:40] so the promised land as many as led by
[1:05:42] the spirit of god they are
[1:05:44] the sons of god
[1:05:46] so god really want to hear us the
[1:05:48] pendulum swinging
[1:05:50] we're born in sin let's see
[1:05:53] you can see my finger let's say bonus in
[1:05:54] this way let's say the spirit is this
[1:05:56] way so now when we born instead we this
[1:05:58] week and this have to swing
[1:06:01] and come across this
[1:06:04] so this is what happened in other words
[1:06:06] you're being released from sin and as
[1:06:08] you go this way the grip of the devil he
[1:06:11] has less grip on your life
[1:06:13] so you're going this way
[1:06:15] you're getting nearer you're getting
[1:06:16] nearer you're going towards this other
[1:06:18] side here now which is the land of the
[1:06:20] spirit you see then you will see perfect
[1:06:23] visions
[1:06:24] perfect holy spirit books charity come
[1:06:27] down to give that you're going towards
[1:06:29] this way and when you're ready here now
[1:06:31] you're ready here for the translation
[1:06:32] you're getting ready for the rapture
[1:06:34] this flesh pan here he cannot subject
[1:06:37] himself to god whatsoever he's the enemy
[1:06:38] of god this guy on this idea so god has
[1:06:41] to do something together some here
[1:06:44] to get us
[1:06:45] over this other way here now
[1:06:47] so i'm saying it's not an overnight
[1:06:49] thing
[1:06:50] but it's a growth thing
[1:06:52] so as we grow in god we get closer to
[1:06:55] god
[1:06:56] and the experiences of our lives the
[1:06:59] journey that god takes us through that
[1:07:00] is why we have to hold to certain
[1:07:02] scriptures for example romans 8 28 we
[1:07:04] have to hold to that in real not all
[1:07:07] things work together for good
[1:07:10] um
[1:07:11] sometimes
[1:07:12] you know when things were kind of nice
[1:07:13] no
[1:07:14] all things it can be something all
[1:07:16] things work together for good because he
[1:07:18] is omniscient he know the end from the
[1:07:20] beginning so he know the jamming you're
[1:07:22] getting in this issue here and the
[1:07:24] pressure you're getting is good for you
[1:07:26] because this will qualify you for the
[1:07:28] next level
[1:07:29] if he ease up the pressure on you by the
[1:07:31] time the other level comes you will just
[1:07:33] faint and fall and just give up
[1:07:35] but you have to be taken from states to
[1:07:37] stage we was we were not born victorious
[1:07:40] we were born defeated we wasn't we
[1:07:42] didn't wasn't born victory we were born
[1:07:44] defeated we grow into victory we grow
[1:07:47] into faith and faith is a victory that
[1:07:49] overcomes the world so as we grow in
[1:07:51] faith we grow in victory as we go in
[1:07:53] faith we go into stature as we go and
[1:07:55] say all things of god is of hit
[1:07:58] so god has to give you the faith to be
[1:07:59] here tonight
[1:08:00] god has to give you the fear to believe
[1:08:03] that
[1:08:04] uh
[1:08:05] you would hear from him tonight you
[1:08:07] would hear a word to your life tonight
[1:08:10] god has to give you that faith so let's
[1:08:11] continue
[1:08:12] so what
[1:08:13] this is the promise the promised land is
[1:08:15] to live in this land of holy spirit
[1:08:18] notice all what we're talking here
[1:08:20] are we speaking about here now have
[1:08:22] nothing to do with the church
[1:08:23] like the church church fellowship church
[1:08:26] that is god's promise for the church to
[1:08:28] live in the power of the spirit it's
[1:08:31] another world
[1:08:32] it's another land and here we go you
[1:08:34] have to come out of the conditions that
[1:08:36] you have been in to come out to live in
[1:08:39] this promised land to receive the
[1:08:41] promise remember the promise is you
[1:08:44] shall receive power from an eye after
[1:08:46] the holy ghost
[1:08:47] is come upon you
[1:08:49] so then barbara is reading the scripture
[1:08:50] and beat now we weakened fate he
[1:08:52] considered not his own body now dead
[1:08:54] when he was 100 years old
[1:08:56] neither the deadness of syria's room he
[1:08:59] staggered not on the promise of god true
[1:09:00] unbelief but strong giving glory to god
[1:09:04] at 100 years old look his body now dead
[1:09:07] his manhood save his womb is dead he
[1:09:09] wasn't even considered when he revealed
[1:09:12] him
[1:09:13] that bed
[1:09:14] and then barbara switches now switching
[1:09:16] address the conditions in the midst that
[1:09:20] bed is not considered you are paralytic
[1:09:23] whatever you are isn't considered the
[1:09:26] wheelchair is not under consideration
[1:09:29] for the little boy so brother branham is
[1:09:32] preaching this teaching this and he is
[1:09:34] releasing faith
[1:09:36] based on abraham
[1:09:38] not considering his own body or sarah's
[1:09:41] room dead and he is challenging them to
[1:09:44] say the bed is not considered you are
[1:09:46] paralytic so a paralysic person was on a
[1:09:48] bed he said that that is not even
[1:09:50] considered whatever you are isn't
[1:09:52] considered the wheelchair is not under
[1:09:54] consideration for that little boy may be
[1:09:56] paralyzed whatever it is i don't know
[1:09:57] it's not
[1:09:59] under consideration don't even consider
[1:10:01] it but the doctor said he will never get
[1:10:04] out of here the doctor said she will
[1:10:06] never come that
[1:10:08] is not even considered well look i'm an
[1:10:11] old person i'm getting middle aged not
[1:10:14] even considered and we here we go are
[1:10:17] the children of abraham hallelujah not
[1:10:19] as isaac was but his royal seed through
[1:10:22] jesus christ by faith that he had
[1:10:25] abraham's seed coming forth in the last
[1:10:27] days to shine like the stars abraham's
[1:10:30] children considered not his own body now
[1:10:32] dead neither even considered it it
[1:10:35] wasn't even brought into question
[1:10:36] whether god would do it or not god said
[1:10:39] he would do it why it was revealed to
[1:10:41] him and when it's revealed to you
[1:10:44] then you don't even consider anything
[1:10:46] else or impossible it is don't consider
[1:10:49] what the doctor said you don't consider
[1:10:50] what mama said what papa said but the
[1:10:52] preacher said what anybody else said
[1:10:54] just consider what god said he
[1:10:56] considered not his own body now dead
[1:10:59] these are the deadness of syria's room
[1:11:01] it wasn't even brought under
[1:11:03] consideration oh my that just shaking
[1:11:06] body dead down the deadness of syria's
[1:11:08] womb that even brought under
[1:11:10] consideration no circumstances or glory
[1:11:13] will be considered when faith finds its
[1:11:16] bed and ground now we're talking about
[1:11:18] real fate we're not talking about usage
[1:11:19] in church you're not saying oh yeah but
[1:11:21] i hear that already you know ah
[1:11:23] you know
[1:11:24] but here's saying about the same thing
[1:11:25] over here but it's not revealed to you
[1:11:28] you're gonna see if it's revealed to you
[1:11:30] when fate
[1:11:31] hits that bedding ground
[1:11:33] everything changes
[1:11:35] everything changes your blues your
[1:11:37] tiredness your weariness you're
[1:11:40] struggling all of that changes because
[1:11:43] faith is hallelujah

[1:14:26] no circumstances will be considered when
[1:14:29] feet finds its bed and ground when a gym
[1:14:31] gene from a man finds the egg in the
[1:14:34] womb on both of them for a time
[1:14:35] something going to happen
[1:14:36] the doctors say you will not have a baby
[1:14:38] i can prove your genes are dead in your
[1:14:40] body and eggs will never be free time
[1:14:42] but let that fatal egg let that gym
[1:14:44] twist itself so like one time what
[1:14:46] should happen that little boy or little
[1:14:48] girl comes on the scene why feet has
[1:14:51] found his belly grub
[1:14:53] works
[1:14:54] go to work sell under pasel and here
[1:14:57] comes a little fella god have mercy upon
[1:14:59] us oh god if he was a rugged christian
[1:15:01] like we should be if we were men and
[1:15:03] women could take god of this word you
[1:15:05] can't do it until it's revealed to you
[1:15:09] how about the clues believe it or not
[1:15:12] oh now we know works as faith express
[1:15:15] and this is how we wrap up here and try
[1:15:17] to get enough balance notice the holy
[1:15:19] fate of god
[1:15:21] was united
[1:15:23] with the holy works of his prophet
[1:15:25] remember
[1:15:27] god's
[1:15:28] holy fate
[1:15:29] was revealed to abraham
[1:15:32] he received it
[1:15:33] and by dear he started with his holy
[1:15:36] works by believing
[1:15:37] and they see the promise are the place
[1:15:39] to grow
[1:15:40] what if he said abraham well you know
[1:15:42] syria after all have been 25 years since
[1:15:45] called me that promise if something
[1:15:46] would happen but it wouldn't god no it
[1:15:48] wouldn't
[1:15:50] the bible said
[1:15:51] in verse 20 we almost finished
[1:15:53] verse 20 of
[1:15:56] romans 4. he staggered not on the
[1:15:57] promise of god
[1:15:59] true unbelief
[1:16:00] but was strong and fake giving glory to
[1:16:02] god this to anyone says and being
[1:16:05] fully persuaded no
[1:16:08] you know what isaac would always say
[1:16:10] when it's worded like that
[1:16:12] it's for a reason
[1:16:13] it could say and being persuaded
[1:16:16] that he that had promised he was able to
[1:16:18] fulfill that what he promised
[1:16:20] he didn't see that
[1:16:21] and being
[1:16:23] persuaded
[1:16:24] no
[1:16:25] it's that fully there is for a reason
[1:16:27] and being
[1:16:29] fully persuaded
[1:16:31] you see you can be persuaded but not
[1:16:33] fully that's what he had promised he was
[1:16:35] able to find therefore it was imputed to
[1:16:37] him for righteousness oh
[1:16:40] you're mainly fully persuaded
[1:16:43] yes
[1:16:44] defeat
[1:16:46] fully persuaded it was then imputed unto
[1:16:48] him for righteousness oh glory to god
[1:16:52] and one time as a beautiful phrase the
[1:16:53] prophet said when abram came into the
[1:16:55] fullness of believing i just love that
[1:16:57] the fullness of it he believed but he
[1:16:59] came to the fullness of believing all
[1:17:02] right
[1:17:03] verse 24 we almost reach
[1:17:06] uh
[1:17:07] what and what
[1:17:09] okay it was 22. therefore it was imputed
[1:17:12] on him for righteousness no it was not
[1:17:14] written for his sake alone that it was
[1:17:16] imputed in him
[1:17:18] but for us also who's 24 to whom
[1:17:22] it shall be imputed if we believe on him
[1:17:24] that raise up jesus from our our lord
[1:17:27] from the dead who was delivered for our
[1:17:29] offenses
[1:17:30] and raised up
[1:17:31] for our justification
[1:17:33] oh blessed be the name of the law
[1:17:36] hallelujah
[1:17:37] thank you lord jesus i skipped
[1:17:40] a skip
[1:17:41] so let me just read this portion here
[1:17:44] from romans 18 amplified from film 18
[1:17:47] for abraham human reasons for hope being
[1:17:49] gone hope and fate that he should become
[1:17:52] the father of many nations as he had
[1:17:54] been promised
[1:17:55] so numberless shall your descendants be
[1:17:58] he did not weaken in faith when he
[1:18:00] considered the utter impotence of his
[1:18:01] own body which was good as dead because
[1:18:04] he was 100 years old
[1:18:06] but when he considered the baroness of
[1:18:08] serious dead womb
[1:18:10] no unbelief or distrust medium waiver
[1:18:13] doubting me question
[1:18:15] concerning the promise of god
[1:18:17] but he grew strong
[1:18:19] and empowered by faith as he gave praise
[1:18:21] and glory to god
[1:18:23] fully satisfied and assured that god was
[1:18:26] able
[1:18:27] and mighty
[1:18:28] to keep his word and do what he had
[1:18:30] promised
[1:18:31] that is why faith was credited to him
[1:18:35] as
[1:18:36] righteousness
[1:18:38] but the words
[1:18:39] it was credited him
[1:18:41] or written not for his sake alone
[1:18:44] but here we go this for us but they were
[1:18:46] written for our sakes too
[1:18:49] righteousness
[1:18:51] standing acceptable to god
[1:18:54] will be granted
[1:18:56] and credited to us
[1:18:58] also who believe in
[1:19:00] trust in
[1:19:02] adhere to and rely on god
[1:19:04] raise up our lord from the dead who was
[1:19:08] betrayed
[1:19:09] and put to death
[1:19:11] because of our misdeeds
[1:19:13] and was raised to secure our
[1:19:16] justification or acquitter
[1:19:18] making our account balance
[1:19:21] and absorbing us
[1:19:23] from all guilt before god
[1:19:26] or this had been so well praised well
[1:19:28] phrased
[1:19:29] in other words we were in the red
[1:19:32] we were owen
[1:19:34] but when jesus rose up for our
[1:19:36] justification
[1:19:37] it balanced off the account
[1:19:39] he paid the arrest he paid off the
[1:19:42] mortgage he paid for your sins
[1:19:45] and now you stand justified and that
[1:19:48] would justify as if you never did it
[1:19:53] this is defeat that is exchanged for the
[1:19:56] righteousness of god give god glory
[1:19:58] tonight give god some praises tonight
[1:20:01] right where you are in your home and in
[1:20:03] your house we are done tonight this is
[1:20:06] how it was exchanged oh blessed be the
[1:20:09] name of the lord the fate
[1:20:12] counted for righteousness
[1:20:14] oh glory to god this is the study we had
[1:20:16] here in romans 4. let us bow our heads
[1:20:18] father i bless you tonight i praise you
[1:20:20] tonight it was such a joy to see the
[1:20:23] life and see the testimony of this man
[1:20:26] called abraham a reflection of the true
[1:20:28] believer a reflection of how fate has
[1:20:32] this personal work this individual walk
[1:20:34] it doesn't matter what the wife thinks
[1:20:36] or what do i feel
[1:20:38] it was hard for abraham i guess he must
[1:20:41] have wished that god spoke to his wife
[1:20:43] sarah it would have been so much easy
