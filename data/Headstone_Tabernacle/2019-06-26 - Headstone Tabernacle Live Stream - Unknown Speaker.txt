overflowing with a burden to see quadrille the see God manifests it's not good enough to see the gods and a prophet we need quarter nach we need his presence tonight we need his power tonight it's not good enough to say you're Christian to say you come to church but what makes you a Christian it's a Holy Ghost and fire in your hearts speaking back power the Christ son of the Living God Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah something a flesh-and-blood cannot give it come by revelation it come by experience Oh hallelujah and even though Pete had a revelation I can read in the scripture there he still couldn't say it back yet really until a pillar of fire was in his heart speaking it back Oh hallelujah he knew it by revelation who the Christ was didn't come my flesh didn't come my intellect but caught with you but they were all there and he asked who do men say I am and the austere day and he said what time I say this some say that it's easy to tell about other people's experiences it's easy to talk about what other people think what other people say or other people's mind on the matter but it's a different thing when you speak from your own experience when you speak from your own revelation what God reveal to you if God show you something no tabla could take that away from you Carter field to Simeon and he was gonna see the Lord's Christ I don't care what doctor

maybe get on to pray amen so we're making a church a night isn't all right that make a revival a man hallelujah hallelujah praise God so I'll read this quote here just for context here a man we know it but praise God I think it fits right in tonight it's coming for the last days a true church it's not a real church oh not a put on what real Eagles a real church Oh hallelujah hallelujah props that'll be prized by churches churches groups groups hallelujah but it's got to come one it's got to come a real one there's got to come on regional original praise God even not original copy but an original that's gonna come forth out of all of these counterfeits running order volleys make-believe what about these grafted fruits that we've got here and there and here but it's gonna come put another original branch I'm not a real Church or not a genuine one just like she was on the day of Pentecost hallelujah is now I've run the power of God drop down and please the church back there that same power is fixing to fall in this last day and place a church one more time by a glorious wonderful baptism of the Holy Ghost now you are predestinated unto oh you didn't hear me you didn't hear me it's gonna come my glorious wonderful not by election of man not my favorite ISM not by nepotism but by a glorious wonderful baptism of the Holy Ghost the pillar of fire is gonna show who his sons are in the last ha also my ceiling hallelujah cord is gonna say this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased who better to please than Claude if man please he do it after his own fashion you do it after his own feeling is nice you do that to how we think what do you think it's supposed to be when I taught tango tonight that is not after man to choose you man didn't choose you tonight it was called I brought you here you are his bride you are his people and the Sheep of his pasture Oh hallelujah that means you could be sealed you can be delivered because God loved you I am only his servant tonight I am only sharing with you the lovely promises that Jesus has for you tonight but it's all for you God reached on from glory to pick you up and give you another chance to fill you with His Holy Spirit to give me his love to give me his power he chose to save your family he chose to love you when you didn't even know what love was he loved you before the foundation of the world Oh Oh send His Holy Spirit to commune with you to anoint you to bring you into himself to bring it back to oneness with himself Oh hallelujah so you could become his people and he could become your cohort hey Manny man what a glorious message Oh hallelujah Oh mom won't keep you too long again a few more totes and we get ready to pray amen but st. spurred friends yeah I wanted seasonals upon us a man I meet just finished his coat hear me man so the church knows who she is it's not right he knows that okay this is Thomas Eaton you know a man let me show another reason why I sitting it's a book of Revelation Jesus Christ in the church he knows that Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever amen a changes not he knows that a whole lot more than 90% of the theologians he knows that since God is immutable it is nature that he just has immutable in his ways the Sentinels are surely that the original Church at Pentecost with the power of God seeing mark 16 in action is the true church that Jesus claims as his own a man the original church that was a penny cause with the power of God moving in it hallelujah is the original church that he takes home with him all as his faults no remember is Christ the true church it is a continuation of the book of Acts it's nice a continuation signs wonders and miracles in the book of Acts what happened in there but it's gonna continue it how on earth with another true church with a real church a last one hallelujah before the resurrection Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah to this amen another true church st. mark 16 in action the true church that Jesus claims as his own all else's faults he matters now oh Christ in the church is the continuation now watch the book of Revelation shows how that Antichrist spirit will come into the church and if Pilate making it lukewarm formal and powerless a man ninety nine and nine-tenths isn't that right please God coming so close hallelujah Stella code is hidden like if it were possible oh but for the elects sake quarter make provision you will cut the day short he will do what he has to do hallelujah to get you out praise God a man is nothing oh my see he said making it lukewarm it's not right it's supposed to Satan revealing his works it matters not right or tend to destruction of God's people and discrediting of God's Word it's not right praise going pulling a little lie here a little lie there if me you may not surely die it's not right praise go any man twisting a word here and there we see it coming down to the ages even to this time now devil is fighting the word a man is fighting because he knows his time is short he has but a short time to work so he's trying to cut you off from the resurrection holily and if he gets you off the word he's got you but you stay with that word tonight because God promised to deliver God promised to restore God promised a 7-ton revival God promised a mighty harvest time or we're looking for it we're on that expectation for it Oh hallelujah hallelujah all the seats I was soon it's gonna reap a great harvest in the air is nothing oh my praise God hallelujah he said no he said he said right on to the time he's cast into the lake
