[43:51] people are hungry and looking for God
[43:54] God has to do something he's got to do
[43:57] something because your heart is burdened
[43:59] your heart is overflowing with a burden
[44:03] to see quadrille the see God manifests
[44:06] it's not good enough to see the gods and
[44:09] a prophet we need quarter nach we need
[44:12] his presence tonight we need his power
[44:15] tonight it's not good enough to say
[44:17] you're Christian to say you come to
[44:19] church but what makes you a Christian
[44:21] it's a Holy Ghost and fire in your
[44:24] hearts
[44:25] speaking back power the Christ son of
[44:28] the Living God

[44:39] experience Oh hallelujah
[44:42] and even though Pete had a revelation I
[44:44] can read in the scripture there he still
[44:46] couldn't say it back yet really until a
[44:49] pillar of fire was in his heart speaking
[44:51] it back Oh hallelujah
[44:54] he knew it by revelation who the Christ
[44:57] was didn't come my flesh didn't come my
[44:59] intellect but caught with you but they
[45:02] were all there and he asked who do men
[45:04] say I am and the austere day and he said
[45:07] what time I say this some say that it's
[45:09] easy to tell about other people's
[45:11] experiences it's easy to talk about what
[45:13] other people think what other people say
[45:16] or other people's mind on the matter but
[45:19] it's a different thing when you speak
[45:21] from your own experience when you speak
[45:24] from your own revelation what God reveal
[45:27] to you if God show you something
[45:29] no tabla could take that away from you

[53:55] church knows who she is it's not right
[53:57] he knows that okay this is Thomas Eaton
[54:00] you know a man
[54:03] let me show another reason why I sitting
[54:05] it's a book of Revelation Jesus Christ
[54:07] in the church he knows that Jesus is the
[54:09] same yesterday today and forever amen a
[54:13] changes not he knows that a whole lot
[54:15] more than 90% of the theologians he
[54:18] knows that since God is immutable it is
[54:21] nature that he just has immutable in his
[54:24] ways the Sentinels are surely that the
[54:27] original Church at Pentecost with the
[54:29] power of God seeing mark 16 in action is
[54:32] the true church that Jesus claims as his
[54:35] own a man the original church that was a
[54:39] penny cause with the power of God moving
[54:42] in it hallelujah is the original church
[54:44] that he takes home with him all as his
[54:46] faults no remember is Christ the true
[54:49] church it is a continuation of the book
[54:50] of Acts it's nice a continuation signs
[54:55] wonders and miracles in the book of Acts
[54:57] what happened in there but it's gonna
[54:59] continue it
[55:00] how on earth with another true church
[55:03] with a real church a last one hallelujah
[55:06] before the resurrection Oh hallelujah
[55:09] hallelujah hallelujah to this amen
[55:13] another true church st. mark 16 in
[55:16] action the true church that Jesus claims
[55:18] as his own all else's faults he matters
