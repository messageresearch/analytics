do but if we get a look and get a peek at what God is seeing then all it transform our lives altogether because you're not looking through the eyes of man the control God's eyes because as are we God sees things there's a way God approach things we approach one way and water push a different way one time David that was asking the Lord and God tell him when he hear a rustle the mulberry tree then

Pope Francis want to take a listen he and all particular listen this morning President Putin could take a share if you want to take a share this mind all that is fine but as a bride and the earth that

listened together not people in a corner here you serving God in your own way Jesus told a woman a woman we know what we worship he said woman the hour coming now is where the true worshipers he was separated idol worshipers make-believe and worshipers from you you are come on out you were surprised with the worship the father in season we couldn't correctly worship God because we did not the truth the truth was lost you seven Asians so God sent Monica for a profit the glad I call the truth together and reveal the whole secret of God not Pat the whole secret of God for the wrapping of the church so now that we have the truth we can come in the spirit and we can worship like we never worship before be not mrs. church we are bright material we are joining a heavenly chorus 24 elders the 4ps thousands and thousands st. blessing and honor and power made the Dominion under the lumber an air of adored worthy [Applause] all my so every service supposed to be increasing worship not less worship you'll get an altar here praise God praise God praise God not less worship more worship every tiny getting closer listen I'm excited this is 2016 we are nearer than when we first believed Oh forty years ago 1975 I was an exciting seventeen-year-old believe in this message I want to hear but I send me these young men take this mission of sweep on the Camaro I told you stalking on me not that young man is 58 years old this year I could claim to be like Hitler just as strong as when I first started out but this my point is this we are belong in the vineyard waitin on the common of the Lord getting all Krrish asleep and gratefully [Music] [Laughter] I'm enjoying the Lord all this one's the greatest times of my Christian life him an onion be seated on Sunday a last service introduce Isaac as the assistant pastor I want you to share with you my authority to do such and from Tottori Brahms in order to the pastoral Neville at this time remember he's the full head of the church but it never has the right to exercise any authority that the Holy Spirit would tell him to see in other words in the church he has the right to anything that God would lead him to do he also have the right over his Deacon board he can change the Deacon board the trustees the pianist any other office in the church but he is asked to change feeling led of the Holy Spirit to do so what he does I will recognize it as he I believed to be a godly man I will also recognize it to be of the Lord and was sanctioned the same therefore it gives him the authority named to operate the church the way he feels led to do it or any office in the church that he desires to switch positions of people for he has the authority to do that which I trust that this will always be lovely and never have to be used also we believe into its government and the government is ordered of the holy spirit in the Bible the pastor is always the head of the church the pastor is always that's God's elder in organization you have to come to the bishop now there is no higher order in the Bible and the elder of the church just tell me where it's at there's no higher order in the Bible for the children and the elder which is the pastor he's the highest order of the Bible and if don't receive any accusation against your elder unless its first be two or three witnesses no matter what anybody says about the hell that don't you believe it until you have two or three witnesses and let them witnesses be tried first and then if that elder has done something wrong and these three Holy Ghost witnesses have been tried and proved that they already done something to the elder then go to the elder and that's in open rebuke that others might see and take heed emails I sort of agree therefore you terrify you and I want to train you because that's what I'm supposed to do under the Holy Ghost to give you training but let nobody tell you anything about your pastor or negative or they find fault with a sufferer or if somebody shut them down in that you know you have no authority to go and see that have you spoken to the pasta make sure whatever you hear in ask the person did you speak to the pastor about that that's the first thing you have to do before you talk to anybody else speak to the pastor directly about that because we wanted to be on the world you don't want any spirits to come in now but a Branham said hear from African trip report there is something about New York City we are expecting a great leader in Africa we close one in New York and there is something about New York City now you watch remember there is something about New York City don't forget that he never said fall in New York City he said there is something about New York City don't forget that what you hear and and this is but a man and said that that there is following you he didn't set following New York and I did that I saw light shine on the word I saw better do the Coleman acquaint promises that no other minister was preaching at that time and the seven thunders and the Seventh Seal and my ministry and is there on our website considering that my testimony concern that he has been a mentor to me a teacher a help to me and put me in training which I receive I watched New York as Bertram said I saw the good the bad and the ugly I learn from the good had lead from the back and I learned from the ugly I learned not only what to do but what also not to do and it's not what we go through is what we learn from what we go through let me repeat that is not what we go through everybody goes through stuff and some learn nothing and if you don't learn you do and fall just the way others do one for you have to learn in other words failures is part of life go forth and feel it's a terrible thing for pastor to see no it's not because you will go forth and feel it's not so much the feeling is what you do but in that feeling it's what you learn from your feeling because well we'll let you feel to make sure you don't rest on the arms of man for example for example people are straining at the anointing that is in the church because we are not a legalist now the legalists and the message they wear do a chain the door dude is to depress they hear and everything else and I look to messages and so on like that but there's no anointing they're dead if legalism could have bring dynamics we should have had it already if beaten people in the submission on church or we have it already you can't judge this church by one individual and this is our tree kind of believers did I say so but a Branham said that so I don't know who is who I call everybody bright I supposed to do that I have no authority at all nobody don't want a shock no matter this no I do have that authority sorry or like a preachers don't worry hallelujah are you with me I don't have no authorities at this one time make it that one can't make it this one is a shot this one is not Chuck this was a sip and see this one is that I don't I don't know that all I know God saves me by His grace and I am under the blood and I'm grateful to God to be alive in the land of the living to see 2016 many people have written my age I'm grateful to God to be sober to be not mental [Applause] with all these half crap these spiritual dictators and puts in this message I escape all of them I'm a strong man maybe Donald Trump get training from some of them Donald Trump when he had a shoot on this one should he want to be on top so his job is to shoot this one dumb this one criticized this one cut this one or say it same thing about this one because you want to be on top maybe he'll in from them you don't know if comment on from how some meetings in this message and lien from some of these guys to get that approach but that is no quotas operate god I see the spirit and the bride say come what does draw people to him oh my that's what God does do you love him this morning o blessed be the name of the Lord so we're looking for for the Spirit of God to move among us in a mighty way amen and I believe that God want to raise up a genuine faithful ministry yes five for many people don't even understand if I formation will be adopted sons not potentially adopted not potential manifested they don't have that that no I don't have that all of us in potential they come like you're potentially rich you're not rich your potential even your patella of a crop that's potential until that crop comfort if a disease cut it off in Midway you have no crop it could be growing and disease come and wipe you all clean so then potential is gone so we're not talking about potential we're talking about this is my beloved son hear ye him not business my beloved son potentially no here he him the son went to stuff and now God is confirming this is my stuff this is my son so we said it in India and the message on India is on the website there's a FIFO ministry yeah and it's look at this affinity of the local church this is all their leaders inside idea but we said it but a Branham was born a prophet nobody didn't lean hands and lakid my prophet he was born a prophet and a he being born a prophet he was commissioned to do the work of evangelist and then he was confirmed to be a prophet there's got to be a task area where God assign you to check your attitude to check your response so Chuck your excuses because he God he's a progressive God he said let there create this and what we did first day the second day the third day the fourth didn't God said let us make man he's always doing something in a progressive way we see it second age to the age always doing something in a progressive manner God is not a deadbeat God he does said either when he rested his resting because it's already done just after unfold he could take over the Branham because it was already done when but Iran unless it was already done every seed that had was to be revealed was already revealed so he could have father takes his male prophet home and let the seeds just bring forth after his kind isn't in his time and it's season he said the seeds will fall in the hands of the predestinated look at where you come from look at this play where you come from and God had to find you God it doesn't matter who God use some of you Savior know and the people who invited you then I am I wrong some of them pastors and some of them not even serving the Lord but God have to use them to get to you God will use I thought you know what the Bible says my servant Nebuchadnezzar God called King Nebuchadnezzar his servant alleluia alleluia you know Putin is a servant of God not as we know it but you're gonna do God's will because Russia have an appointed thing to do glory to God to bum the war Laurita God hallelujah praise God when Romans destroy the baddest of rejoice he prophets rejoice he men and so on for God brought judgment on that prostitute Oh hallelujah in her was found the blood of all the matches of Jesus God was beating for this special and Oh hallelujah hallelujah what time is it we are approaching a time of judgment [Applause] maybe season over sudden things just turn pink does change all of a sudden is not as it used to be and some people want to go back in Australia how it used to be this is how it used to be back in times but goes back in loose lines 370 80s in a common man Oh hallelujah the jobs we have now didn't exist 20 years ago you jumped designations that I have now didn't even exist 20 years ago some major players in the business market get bum completely out of existence by new players in the market because the dynamics has changed life has changed Oh hallelujah Oh glory there's another change coming hallelujah changing of tank oh I wonder if it has already started hallelujah he said when the seventh seal when it begins it begins in silence it will start nobody knows and the calm down is on so today I would like you to stand as we want to approach the word let's sing that one song one more game through the blood to the blood we could come into his presence his water [Music] that's why [Music] Oh true we can come into this blue [Music] may that we can come into whoa [Music] we can come already made away that we can call [Music] Isaiah 63 verse 4 Matthew chapter 7 24 to 29 Russian chapter 10 et live and when you sit down I want you to keep the Bibles close to you we go via some scriptures we like to also continue to read Isaiah 63 verse 4 for the day of vengeance is in mine heart on the year of my redeemed is come Matthew chapter 7 wanna read from verse 24 therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them I would like him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock under rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall delight not a foolish man which built his house upon the sand the rain descended the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it and I came to pass when Jesus @m the D scenes the people was punished and his doctrine for it thought them as one having Authority and not as the scribes Revelation chapter 10 when I read from his heed the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again say go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which stands it upon the sea and upon the earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book he said unto me take it eat it up it shall make that very bitter but a shall be named out sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angels hand and eat it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings let us bow our heads with a prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for your word Lord your word is life Your Word is truth your word is a light Oh God shining our part that we could know where to place our feet inspire this message to the people Lord and may you give them inspiration and revelation that will drive them into a position to pray and to talk on the crown until you granted Lord in Jesus and I asked at him and he may be seated well have a title the closing times of the Gentiles I'll have an inspiration the time of the Gentiles and that word times of the Gentiles is taken from Luke 21 verse 24 and Jesus was seeing this and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive unto all nations speaking about Jews and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles until the time of the Gentiles be fulfilled until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled revelation 22 verse 7 says behold I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the scenes of the prophecy of this book and I John saw these things and heard them when I heard them I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel would show me these things then said he unto me see thou do is not for my a fellow servant of thy brethren the prophets and of them which keep the scenes of this book worship God he said unto me seal not the scenes of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand he that is unjust let him be unjust till this is the time that gonna be at hand a closing time a finishing time a judgment and God said Isaiah vengeance is in my heart but the year of my redeemed has come it's a to folding its judgment the ceilin its vengeance plus redeemed we it's a 2-14 I will be going for is it that we need the judgment yes there's a quote where I'm said the only thing to see that is the judgment because the same real that knows we turn on the flow DIAC was the same read I was gonna drown the world the same Holy Ghost dynamics the power and everything you'll be looking for the cap off this church the brain is the same spirit that will bring judgment to the world so I want you to understand it's not my gimmick is not my chance it's not a random thing it's the thing that's cordoned the Scriptures might be fulfilled hallelujah see you not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand he that is unjust let him be unjust still we're just filthy filthy still righteous righteous still holy holy still behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according into his work shall be so you don't have to boast God will reward you every man according to your works your works will manifest and prove what you are isn't that right o blessed be he love him this morning Oh hallelujah praise be to Jesus if everybody's I like it attempted Daniel chapter 2 this is a context Shipshewana bring out Daniel chapter 2 we know the story their comeback Nebuchadnezzar dream a dream and he forgot the dream he said the dream gone from him and he called his wise men switch sailors whole bunch of them and said interpret a dream they said no problem telesurgery he said gone from me and he said only to interpreted I will take on a head off cut Olien pieces he's all a better to poetry because that is a terrible dream they said be we can't do that never heard about that if you only tell us we're gonna interpret that he sold a plane for tang he said it has no more time tell me Lee dream and tell me the interpretation or your head is off and listen these things that play you know they said I decree he said wrong zapatti wise man and I saw Daniel get caught up in this thing then I want to know what he is why the king say they say the King see somebody is telling the dream and interpret Daniel said tell the king there is a God tell the King as a god that can reveal secrets give me a little time to talk to my god hold your hand all the destruction don't take the heads off yet because my god could reveal secrets even the one you can't remember my god let's go to verse 26 of Daniel chapter 2 the King answered and said to Daniel whose name was Bertie shaza are they able to make known at the media dream which I have seen and interpretation thereof Daniel answered in the presence of the King unsaid the secret which the King had demanded Connor the wise men the astrologers the magician the suitors shown to the King but there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets and make it known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days thy dream and the vision upon my head are these for thou for do King thy thoughts came and did I mine upon my bed what should come to pass Hereafter and he that reveal its secrets make it known to Z what shall come to pass as from me the secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living but for there six that she shall make no leader petition to the king that thou mightest know the thoughts of that heart dull Oh King saw us and behold a great image this great image was brightness was excellent stood before thee and the form was terrible this image head was of fine gold his breast his arms of silver his belly of tithes of brass his legs of iron his feet part iron part of clean dough saw is still a stone was cuddled with all hands which smote the image upon the feet that were of iron and clay and bring them to pieces then was the iron the clay the brass the silver the gold broken in pieces together and became at the chaff of the summer threshing floors and the wind kyurem away that no place was wrong for them and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled Jolla this is the dream we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king so diamond is on target all he King could see without dreamers even any time I could tell the dream he could tell the interpretation because Talia was a true prophet no King at the King of Kings for the God of heaven had given me a kingdom power strength and glory wheresoever the journal men dwell the beasts of the field the fowls of the heaven had he given into thine hand and had made the ruler of all Dow at this head of gold after thee shall arise another Kingdom inferior to Z another third kingdom of brass which shall be a rule over all the earth a fourth kingdom shall be strong as I am for as much as I am breaking in pieces and subdued all things as iron that breaketh all these shall break in pieces and bruise and whereas thou sawest the feet and tools packed potters clay and pad iron the kingdom shall be divided and there shall be in it the strength of the iron for as much as those swords the iron mixed with miry clay and as the toes of the feet were Pat I am Pat clay social the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken and whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with clay under the days of these Kings here we go shot the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the Kingdom shall not be left to another people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms it shall stand forever for as much as those soils that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands that had break in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver the gold the grid God had made know that the King watch shall come to pass thereafter and the dream is sitting and the interpretation sha hallelujah o blessed will supply there the dream is certain and the interpretation sure Daniel is unique in that daniel was seeking the Lord knowing Jama by book says seventy weeks are determined for his people it was 68 years two years remaining so that has got desperate watch this but it is passion to seek the Lord God given a whole unfolding of things right down to the end so daniel is like a Gentile prophet he's not a Gentile but he saw the vision of the times of the Gentiles are you with me now in Romans II let me rather find it if you want you can find it verse 11 and Paul was saying I see then have they stumbled that they should fall talking about Israel Israel we know is the true olive branch we are the one that was grafted in I want you to stick with me now this is not a game this is the real thing now God blinded the Jews that we could get stickin to get the Gentiles an opportunity we were not his people he came unto his own his own received him not and as many as received him to them he gave power to become the sons of God he came to his very own and his own rejected him and upon rejection they turned to the Gentiles knowing that the Gentile have a specific time not even a specific lucky time but a Branham said it has just call it trains of the Gentiles another terminology until the fullness of the Gentiles come in when that time is up it's over I wonder if you understand that so all this Corrigan's and pride a message pride as a God is God and you know he easily loved me so much and what listen be careful that same Savior one day will be your judge God is the word not the imagination of your heart God is the word could somebody say Amen so Paul in Romans he was saying I say he said god forbid but rather through their fall salvation has come under the Gentiles to provoke them to jealousy now if the fall of them be the riches of the world and the dimension of them the riches of the Gentiles how much more their fullness for I speak to you Gentiles inasmuch as I'm an apostle of the Gentiles I magnify my office in Miami means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh and might save some of them here we go are you ready this is Romans 11 or we right now in verse 15 if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead for if the first-fruit be holy the lump is also holy and if the root be holy saw the branches and if some of the princess has broken off and don't being a wild olive tree were grafted in among them and with them partakers of the root and the factus of the olive tree boast not against the branches but if dog balls don't bear it's not the root but the root the doll will see them the branch of was broken off that I might be grafted in well because of unbelief they were broken off and thou standest by faith be not high-minded but fear for if God spared not the natural branches how here we go take heed lest he also spare not deed behold therefore the goodness and the severity of God on them which fell severity but towards the goodness if thou continuing if thou continue in the goodness behold therefore the goodness and the severity of God and fell severity but to watch the goodness is Dow continue in his goodness otherwise doll also shall be cut off and they also if they are bad not still in unbelief shall be graffed in him for God is able to graft them in again and if doll will cut off of the olive tree which is wild by nature and will grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree how much more DS will be a natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree I would not brethren here we go that you should be ignorant of this mystery least you should be wise in your own conceits listen to it that blindness in part is happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles come in blindness to Israel until so once the fullness of the Gentiles come in God is ready to go over to Israel no we can understand revelation 7 I saw four angels coming down saying stop the four winds and then I saw another mighty angel having the seat of the Living God oh I still put a mark upon all those and those Jews day 144,000 you could understand right now go to the boat to go back to the Jews he had to wrap up the Gentiles isn't that right the time of the gentle has been in this Pentecostal feast this one feasted recognising the message but Obama says the trumpets all them songs in under the sixth seal we pick it on last Sunday under the feet of the trumpets watch to rush the Jews from all parts of the world to the homeland so Hitler Stalin Mussolini all of them was part of what's plan to get the jewels back into their homeland six million Jews lost their lives and as you know what Baran said the gentle hand of Jehovah leading them back to the promised land see it from the world's ten point we see no Hitler kill and look on Mussolini and Stalin but in God's plan that's God's getting them right back into position because we have to get the time of the end the time of the Gentiles and the coming to the closing time of the Gentiles we have to finish all of that under the last Church age the

Jerusalem into Babylon the car narrator Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar he was a young fellow when he went down to Babylon not many of them were still holding the grin old feet I like Daniel because he purposed in his heart when he went on to Babylon he was going to remain a believer he was not going to defile himself with the Kings meats now the very thing that Daniel was the prophet to the Gentiles Daniel saw all the Gentile age rise and fall he is called the Gentile prophet he wasn't a gentle himself but he saw the Gentile dispensation from start to finish in the head of gold ended up in the feet of iron and clay and while he purposed in his heart I skip dinner know Jeremiah the Prophet watch and he caught in from JAMA 25th chapter you'd rather find it and Jeremiah speaking therefore does say a lot of hosts are you with me anybody tired and sleepy raise your hands but expect many reasons just making shorter you know tired and sleepy January 25 if you see therefore does

god it is your refuse to see God you've refused to see what God has allowed here it is God is telling his people king nebuchadnezzar of king of babylon my servant will bring them again against this land and against inhabitants thereof and against all the nations wrong about i will utterly destroy them but Abraham remember them what gods elected he was talking about it wasn't individual infidels

tell you that here come to a time when Israel transgression will be finished go cut off the wild branch and grass in that real branch again sometime I heart jump to see them poor miserable people cut off young not knowing where they were going and think here we go that God in His mercy did so that I could be saved he blinded their eyes from their own Messiah shut their ears up that they could not hear him yet look right at his miracles right his miracles that he was doing God cut them off purposely and blinded their eyes so that we could have a chance to see and give us this opportunity and we walk along like we are somebody Paul tell them take heed how to do that take heed for if God spared not the natural bench how will he have any more mercy and a white branch we walk around I'm a Presbyterian methodist I'm Baptist and Pentecostal I read a book I disagree but over it say even if you disagree what I preach you should come and see me personally don't want to run and tell everybody you know I hate you but we see that I do like that I find so unfair because you have a book on tape that's why talking about the disrespect that's why I told you how I conduct myself over the years here in Iran overseas not too much a friend friend friend thing like that because I saw the games and politics people playing overseas among the ministers among the churches and I turned that down I sign up for the word not the politics and I rejected the politics and I took the win and at this day I am NOT a politician I have no pets I have no prefer this one and that one going have man everywhere it have meant that we haven't heard from yet I cope with the resep ago continues I believe pride is still to be called not these bunch of backside and churchy people that thing that God owed them something in this message sitting in the premises instead of standing on the promises no court is able to call it 11th hour Gentile workers if that people will be called by the spirit upon the bribe I believe that I truly believe that I believe that not 120 only that tree throws more people out this was going to be saved come on you don't hear what I'm saying the 120 gotta feel whatever they want to feel up in the upper room but when they came out there was 3,000 to receive the Holy Ghost there was a house of only less to receive the Holy Ghost hallelujah poor you can't put God in a box squat perceive God could deliver what the b-team gotta be store worker heel pockets a tree glory to God hallelujah praise God you gotta have a problem in your holster when you're back home it's already solved [Applause] a gentleman came up to Jesus and said Lord my my silver is sick just speak the word only I'm a man under Authority I said the one going to go let's speak the word only and she said go thy way by cylinder zeal when that man going to put now he said what time was he he not if he he'll let me see let me feel what time he said the same time - I said quote I will praise God dear say that I've never seen such faith in Israel please just speak the word only that was the tent I'll cover that tent I'm an that wasn't a Jew you supposed to speak the word you come for the word you are Gentile bride you supposed to speak the world my wife will be delivered my husband I know I'm going to be delivered Prince quire bring me in this church then not to be delivered come on you got to get the picture you've got to come out of water here hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glory to God this wonders this endtime message watch what watch the angel came to Daniel to seal up the vision and prophecy to seal it up because they'll be sealed till the time of the end so once the book begin to unfold it means we are actually live in any end of time isn't that right now what were wrong said what to see the vision prophet daniel i prophesy these things he saw it in a vision and the india come down to see the vision to see the prophecy they can read it but a cap on the standard until the end time the end time what is the end time the end of the 70th week when Christ the Prince the Antichrist will be revealed now the endtime message I reveal it the last church age glory there you are oh my 6 metres think of it the mystery things that the church will pass their eyes see it's nonsense the mystery of who Jesus Christ was not a third person not as a calm person not a third person but the person of God all these other mysteries of God will be revealed there we go because it's wrote in this book this one I get to you and to be revealed to the endtime generation because there's a power and vision behind it our Word of God that's been revealed to get the church in order for the rapture and going home the purpose of had been revealed is to what get the church in order for the rapture or praise the name of the Lord now the Gentiles was not lotted any sitting tank just the time of the Gentiles we find out Jesus didn't let them attain an equal descriptive reread Luke 21:24 they shall shut down the walls of Jerusalem until the time of the Gentiles watch be fulfilled then there's a lot of time but nobody knows what it will be it's a mystery so what we preach in this morning is a mystery I'll just read it to you it's no longer a mystery of this residue what apparitions more as a mystery anytime that Gentiles a mystery so the title is a mystery insufficient in the mystery there's a lot of time nobody knows what it will be is a mystery see the Gentile time the Jews we cannot tell time I wonder church well it's back sooner whatever it is remember in this great time of persecution there will be millions of millions of Gentiles that will die the rejected bride the remnant of the woman seed the sleepin virgin do you understand that those who missed the rapture will be killed most of them the piper quality remnant of the woman's seed for around some millions will not die all right she goes right on it is just clear he said if you haven't got the holy spirit you better get it us because you can we had the endtime Oh bless I've been in the land watch now after Dale is living by Wesley he said the pyramid shape into the headstone but it has to never had come the ministry from looter to the end of the Pentecostal age a minority and the true church all of the world here we go this is prophecy now how shape them to a place with his common ministry among them just exactly like the Ministry of Jesus Christ uh-huh so this is a man's ministry he's talking about a ministry shape down where they have the Ministry of Christ among them this is what we're looking for what they got what they got what that means when the Ministry of Jesus recommends what does that mean they have got knitting in condition what's next the rejected stone to the pyramid cut out of mountain without hands he is tying him the capstone with the stone that Daniel saw he said now watch God God centered do you see it the rejected one the rejected stone is the head the capstone the very one the rejected Judas gentle it is Christ and Christ was not cut and put here by a vicar son of God he is the Holy Spirit the camp of the pyramid will be Christ's coming do you see it no Daniel said he was a Gentile age until the stone come out of the mountains with all their cut of hands without hands they had never put the capstone of he tinysine what Daniel saw and the capstone so what Daniel saw ties him with us and what we expected and what we are looking for isn't none right no what and God's hand that cut the stone you see it what did it do hit the image schmuck in his feet broken in pieces grown little power what happened that time the coming of the stone up when the church and the glory caused it ended the Gentile dispensation God ended it up the coming of that stone so the common of the capstone dynamics and the time of the Gentiles ends the common of the Gentile dispensation isn't that right day is unlikely bring this Christ is that stone he wasn't born of a man he wasn't born of God he is coming for church that's been reborn again by the Spirit of God cause the strength of the headstone runs all through the church like a magnet I remember being in the middle they were shipping out all kind of things I'm scrap laying on the strip and a big stone come by and pick it up that big magnet stone pick up all of it because it was magnetized to it we have got to be magnetized to the headstone the headstone is the Holy Ghost Christ and every one of us that's got the magnetism of the Holy Spirit when that stole here we go strikes the image the children flee to it so they got to come a power back into the church or glory to God he says the power come it would leave me the prayer it will be the grace of God you understand Israel had nothing to do with them seventy years God judge them and say for 70 years Babylon will hold you and after that you're getting out so after 70 years course I was just the king of Babylon you understand when God said I will restore it I have none with you I will restore to you whether you like it you don't like it where you'll feel or at all feel it he said I am going to do it or get the Lord are shouting how many understand that you are going to be delivered every name on the port [Applause] Michael just turn up and deliver every name that not just choose Michaels Christ every name has to be delivered the Prophet came with the book the mighty angel came with the book the book was open my man Oh hallelujah Oh glory to God so everything must fall into their hands the Gentile churches loud is the age if the Jews and in homeland I'm the Gentile apostasy already taken place we have a president like we have we have a nation has broke up like behalf we have atomic bombs hanging on the hangers we have a church in lukewarm we have Church people that pull himself together we have a ministry that patents the ministry of Jesus Christ to catch the storm when it comes so the stone can't come if there's not many to catch it so the ministry of christ is to catch the headstone that Christ will be amongst the people so it's not just Minister five-hole like give me some political pause and sign by human beings it's the Ministry of Jesus Christ in the form of pastor in the form of a parcel in the form of prophet in the form of evangelist in the form of teacher that men produce in themselves and pioneer beef it's not that it's the Holy Spirit coming back for your perfection we need a gift for your perfection the final finishing touches on this bride [Applause] [Music] hallelujah consider whether they're right they just write all their pin up something on the right not this thing half and on one very bright some dirty dress bright when you see that so the bright column so you watching the next door that might not looking right and nothing sure daddy bright bright when tight tight closer came so the bride walking the holy I so like that you can be rained tight tight clothes what can my bride is that who shined that truck I thought Christ is your husband you don't have him already you're looking for no order he impressed not with your older garment he impression it in a diamond they're not pretty old Silas mutiny inside there many people pushing the oxide and it's terrible in your on the inside they put you know you're only outside the prettiest be on the inside bride is caught by character calling for private character not numbers if his numbers everybody a bit just you win that's somebody done enough recovery 15,000 people how come between a dude about Pope Francis you have millions so it's not a numbers game and then somebody up 12 in the bush somewhere and saying I Ephesians so it doesn't matter somebody a small group this if you're a little flock somebody a big picture say down Reviver everybody ever excuse for the stories you 12 actually cannot believers and we have in terms not chicken'll us do but yours is that's the truth I say amen to that got a perfect order is that all right so what okay now we had homeland I'm gonna wrap up sign right now when a homeland the Jews and the homeland with the end of the age ready for the rapture rapture come the church goes up we have caught up to meet him in the air we know that the stone I was cut out of the mountain is ready to come at any time and when it comes what does it do when this stone comes what does it do it does away with the Gentile age it's all over God completely quits dealing with them and you nobody could after that lets him that be first to be first he still let him that is holy be holy still what he do then he takes the church the Holy Ghost filled what's the filthy you know the filthiest is not fornicators and adulterers and to eat off but you know listen no he said there he said what's the filthy that's the sleepin versions that come up for judgment week over here that's a sleeping children he called them filthy oh Jesus was speaking of this storm not gonna strike every man he said that storm will strike you sometime on the other depends upon what foundations that you have whether your host will slam talk what appears to take warning they always come in and now is and the ceiling is about over where every man and woman on the face of the earth is going to be in a place of refuge like it wasn't listen or go outside of it you have to make your decision the safety is in Jesus Christ o blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah the storms are coming and there's a hiding place and he was praying he said I want you to think sincerely and sternly for the next moment have you ever found that blessed hiding place from the rat remember there's no - I didn't place just one you might be a good church member which I have not even to see against but if that's all you have your life isn't compared with the book of Acts if the Holy Spirit you profess to have it's not making you live like you did in the book of Acts your life could write another book you better take warning in the first vine brought for the Pentecostal church the second vine Museum coming please the branch rather of the vine before the another Pentecostal church with a Pentecostal experience being the same kind of fruits the first church had questioned now you abiding in the blessed sacred presence of the Lord have you passed from death unto life are you resting upon some emotion some psychological effect or some intellectual speech or are you consciously abiding in this presence with the fruit of the Spirit in your life long-suffering goodness meekness gentleness can you bear for someone to talk about you and you love them so much in your heart you pray for them or is it a selfish prayer oh Lord I know I ought to pray for him no brother does the sweetness and the love of God sweep over my stool or Holy Spirit move my foot soul Oh hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord and if he don't cut the work shortly lected sake there is some elected to eternal life we know that all of them are that's got eternal life and he do cut the work short for their sake no flesh shall be saved the world has met his doom the spirit the dynamics of the promised word to get
