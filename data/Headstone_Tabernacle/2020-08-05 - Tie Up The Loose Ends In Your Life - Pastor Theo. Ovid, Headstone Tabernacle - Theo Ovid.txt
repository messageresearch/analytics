worship a little better just split just really let's pop [Music] to break every chain there's still power in the blood of jesus so god bless you if i about this tonight there's two ports of scripture like to read from malachi chapter four and luke chapter fourteen malachi chapter four verse five and six and luke chapter 14 we want to read from verse 27 to 33 for scripture reading tonight god bless you and welcome uh luke malachi 4 5 and 6 behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadfully of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers least i come and smite the earth with a curse and from luke chapter 14 i want to read from verse 27. jesus speaking and whosoever dot not bears cross and come after me cannot be my disciple for which of you intended to build a tower sit it not down first and counter the cost whether he has sufficient to finish it at least happily after he had laid the foundation and is not able to finish it all that behold it begin to mock him saying this man began to build and was not able to finish or what king going to make war against another king sit not down fist and consulted whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that comment against him with twenty thousand or else while the other is yet a great way off he sends an ambassador and desired conditions of peace so likewise whosoever he be of you that forsake it not all that he had he cannot be my disciples let's pray heavenly father we thank you for your word and god any man could read scriptures and texts but it take the holy spirit to breathe life into it and we invite you to breathe life into it father give us that sincerity of heart as we approach your throne and as we comproach lord god to hear your word and to receive your word grant it and speak to us we need to hear from you tonight in jesus mighty ask it amen and amen god bless you have your seats so good to see all of you out here tonight it's always a blessing to be here in god's presence in the house of god amen and i was uh blessed to be here on sunday uh about uh tying up those loose ends the six seals is a tie up those loose ends now tonight message is a subset of sunday's message and as i said we're going to continue this coming sunday from last week sunday but this is the subset of the message from a sunday last where we spoke on sixth seaster sub delusions and that's what malachi 4 was sent to do uh as john the baptist was sent before run the first coming of christ you have a message that was going to foreign the second coming of christ and he tied up the loose ends and introduced the messiah so tonight i want to bring a little different emphasis the title of the message tonight tie up the loose ends in your life so we switch and know from what was the commission and and the scriptures and so on to bring it down to home now to bring it on to you and i yeah and i have this the subject the things that you can do and have the same team let the main thing be the main thing so the title tonight is tie up the loose ends in your life subject the things that you can do and the theme is let the main thing be the main thing i certainly appreciate pastor of lagos church he preached a message on loose ends in 2014 a tremendous blessing and i and i am withdrawing from that tonight what he had shared i know it will be a blessing to you oh praise the name of the lord so you love him tonight give the lord some praises [Applause] okay and uh this is from jeremiah chapter 2 and jeremiah speaking more of the word of the lord came to me saying go and cry to the age of jerusalem saying thus saith the lord i remember thee in the kindness of thy youth the love dinos puzzles when the winters after me in the wilderness in the land that was not sown israel was holiness unto the lord and the first fruit of his increase all that devour him shall offend the evil shall come upon them saith the lord hear the word of the lord o house of jacob and all the families of the house of israel thus saith the lord what iniquity have your fathers found in me that they are going far from me and i've walked after vanity and have become vain neither said they where is the lord that brought us out of the land of egypt that led us through the wilderness to a land of desert and of pits through a land of drought and shadow of death to a land that no man passed through where no man dwell and i brought you into a plentiful country to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof and when you entered you defiled my land and made my heritage an abomination and the priest said not where is the lord and they that handle the lord knew me not the pastors also transgressed against me and the prophets prophesied by bear and walked after things that do not profit wherefore i would yet plead with you saith the lord and with your children's children will i plead for pass over the eyes of chittiman see send unto kida consider diligently and see if there be such a thing at a nation change their gods which are yet no gods but my people have changed their glory for that which dot not profit be astonished oems at this and be horribly afraid be very desolate say the lord for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters and i've hewed them out systems broken systems that can hold no water or what a condition to be in after all these years and my spirit is still tonight because i i realize how far the church is from what god require and what god must have of us and we have to come up to line with god's requirement and god's program o pray is the name of the lord and i trust that all of you would have listened to the bible study we have was very important bible study about uh the will of god for you to be sanctified so if you have not listened to it please do amen but obama was praying and he was talking about men and on position and then he switched to the ministers and as my brethren standing this morning i prayed at each of these ministers in here these ministering spirits that god hear my prayer and i pray that you will purge that gift that's in them purge that gift that is in them if they are preachers make them better preachers if the evangelists make them better evangelists if their teachers make them better teachers if their pastors make them better pastors god grant that they'll be filled with the spirit of god and they'll be energized by the great supervine that will give them life eternal and power to minister with and to touch the needy world as it so needs today or give the lord some praises isn't that something he said forgive us of our shortcomings forgive us of our narrow-minded beliefs and little sectarian ideas and let us be baptized into one big brotherhood into one big fellowship that the kingdom of god might be furthered by our coming together this day we asking jesus what a prayer oh glory to god hallelujah thank you lord you love him tonight hallelujah and that's what the matter is if it's an order the church it's got the mechanics ready it only needs the dynamics tonight if we can get the mechanics ready get your hearts right here we go the things that we can do that's where i get that from get the mechanics ready our hearts right what is that the things that we can do then you say follow him in every word follow him baptism falling in every order he told us to do get every mechanic ready and stand there then we are ready for the dynamics to be lit off and only god can do that and that's to drop into our hearts the fate that says i am now healed oh give the lord some praises tonight so malachi 4 the scripture we read he came to tie up the loose ends in the church isn't that right that we could get a message that we could be prepared and be ready for the coming of the lord isn't that right hallelujah and god in the loose ends was to release what the power back in the church because god could only use the conduit of his word and because the word was scattered through seven ages he then seven ages from eternity to gather all that scattered word and bring it back and tie back into the word that he can release the fullness of the holy ghost and the fullness of the holy ghost has visited a church making manifest luke 17 30 this son of man back again in this last day oh glory to god and i believe the angel of god the manifestation of the holy spirit is that angel trying to get the people back to the word because he could only vindicate the word and now he's here to gather up and tie all the loose ends in your life so tonight you have to be under expectation for your loosens for your looseness to be tied up because before you could get that full manifestation of introducing the messiah the sixty you have to tie up all the loosens and before you get your portion before you get your inheritance before you get your baptism before you get your fire before you get your dynamics you have got to tie up the loose ends in your life oh give the lord some praises tonight hallelujah hallelujah he said he will do for you the same you don't want to adoption if you will stand here we go after you receive the holy ghost and make yourself a christian you don't born a christian you're the joint church and become a christian you say i make yourself a christian you have something to do because we give the lord a shout tonight make yourself a christian and act like a christian should if you put your face in god's word and your eyes towards heaven and let your pants be batted at the knees and be reverent before god there will be someday that god will take you over to a side and give you a power and a gift that the whole world will know he's been with you placing a son in position oh blessed be the name of the lord you love him tonight so the bible said his wife not the jewish members the scripture his wife had been yourself ready the church members will just continue on being church members but the wife she want to make herself ready so many says if the lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling or from lying or stealing i will serve him but that's up to you you see you have got something to something to do something too dare to overcome inherit all things they don't overcome you have power to do it that's the word now that is the word now i don't care what you feel or what you think this is the word now the word tell me that that you have power to do it the words say that and the word can't lie let your feelings be a lie tonight not that word that word is true you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down she has made herself ready oh my when i see and i'm seeing it more and more how far churches and and people has fell away from god fell away from the principles fell away from the spirit fell away from the expectation and it's all mechanical and intellectual and just it's it's astonishing that's why god said in jeremiah it's astonishment i bring you all to bless you and everything else and like my people leave and find other gods they leave me the living fountain to heal them out systems broken systems that can hold no water they leave the living fountain you see god could not push us through a little pipe and pull us out the other side and say blessed is he that overcome it you have nothing to overcome so i want to rip the entitlement over you that you believe a message are you entitled to what you're entitled to fight for every single inch that is what you're entitled to the entities are no rapture you're entitled to the resurrection you're entitled to leave here and we change the movement to write a song like the special thing not what he would say in here you have to have rapture in faith that's the ticket you have to have it to leave here who gives the lord a shout not teaching you have to have that that's why you said malakai for to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers that are living faith that a living god that a reality a manifested reality of the glory of god was in their midst or give the lord a shout that a person their spirit when they beat them they went back and pray and the building shook and they were refilled with the holy ghost that's why the prophet said the dynamic that this church will be a refilling of the holy ghost oh glory to god hallelujah get your soul on fire get your heart on fire ask yourself tonight what is it in my life that i have to do that must be done oh give the lord some praises hallelujah praise god you're with me tonight i want to drive it we have a little time here i wanna just drive it home you see god could not push us through a pipe and pull us out the other side and say blessed he'll overcome it you had nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you've got to make decisions for yourself i have to make decisions for myself and in doing that we show our faith and respects to god oh glory to god in doing what i love decisions oh praise god it is because you see the fruit of your decisions you make a wrong decision you get messed up you make a right decision you see the fruit of that love decisions you have a decision to make tonight if any man don't want to follow after me he's not worthy of me oh glory to god you have to go after him and pick up your cross you have something to carry you'll give the lord a shout tonight not no book no no spoken word but cross [Music] [Applause] a cross i wouldn't lie to you when they see the angle full one thing you'll get out of my mother's truth it will be cotton and might be rough and hard but you don't get the truth you know why you don't need the truth that we're gonna set you free oh glory to god nothing else got set to free but the truth is what will set you free hallelujah he just pushed you through and but you have got to make decisions for yourself i have to make decisions for myself in doing that we show his feet and our respects to god abraham was promised a child but he was maintained this promise for 25 years the ups and downs he had the temptations in those 25 years but he held to the world of promise and israel was promised a promised land but he had to fight for every inch of it wherever the soldier your foot tread upon that have i given to you god said to joshua it was all dear the lamb was there and god gave it to them but they had to fight for it and it's the same way it's about divine healing god has got the power to heal you if you've got the courage to accept it but you have to fight every inch of the way god has got amazing grace to save you and he will do it but you have to fight every inch of your way i've been behind the pulpit over 21 years and every inch of that has been a fight constantly we must fight if we must reign so we find out the bride has to make us have ready be willing to lay aside every weight that does so easily beset us that we might run with patience to race that we slayed before us oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord o glory hallelujah okay the lord some praises hallelujah water what are loose they are the untidy stuff they are the area of weakness they are the areas of leakage but things leak out therefore when the loosens are guarded or tight tied up there's no more leakage weakness disappear and is replaced by power so you end the leak of your life the leaking of your joy the leaking of your faith the leaking of your can't pray and you can't get a break all that leaking you tie it up and it begins to replace with power you're getting strength now oh glory to god hallelujah that's what tying up the loose end means hallelujah glory to god amen praise god and brother branham you're saying here i begin to notice something different it ain't the same like tabernacle i used to come to i want you to remember tonight you keep the old fashioned permitted keep the old fashioned holy spirit falling among you keep the world out seal christ in your letting down in prayer some way just remember as you saw you reap remember that you got one of the best churches i ever walked into my life anywhere on any continent life tabernacle one of my favorites it breaks my heart to see you letting the world reach into you the way you're doing so don't do that no more snap out of it pray out of it let god come back and take over submit yourselves to god get the old-fashioned blessing back again and shreveport you dear sadness down here you are the finest people i ever met i don't say that to compromise with you i say it because i love you and if you want to get some real good treatment the old-fashioned hospitality come to louisiana but i tell you don't let the world creeping on you don't let the world get into your church's bedroom he said pray it out fast it out until god comes down and take a hold keep the joy of the lord among the saints keep them prayed up at god every little place if noah seen a leaking in the act he put some pitch in it oh glory to god that's the best thing i know to keep the leak out is to keep the leak out the best thing i know is the only way to do it that's prayer prayer stops the leak oh give the lord a shout to the devil's job is to mess you up mess up your head mess up your mind mess up your confidence that you stop praying unless you stop praying you're under a man loose ends and when you're on the loose ends the devil is there to mess you and to conform you and to oppress you but when you have the loose ends you have to back up you have to pack up you have to leave tie up the loosens in your life tonight go give the lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah glory to god are we going to tie up the looseness in this church oh glory to god the church solution we're going to turn them up too we're going to set the church in order hallelujah get the treasure reboot hallelujah glory to god amen a loose end in a garment or a dress is an area of weakness that makes the dress weak and provides an avenue for further weakness oh glory to god that all of this loose ends isn't that right hallelujah and loose senses when things not in order and then the church become weak and powerless and what kind of spirits run through the church that's an illusion they have to get tied up because that brings weakness hallelujah and the church lose strength isn't that something else loose saying he's like those who don't want to wear a mask and they don't understand they're affecting others because they are asymptomatic and they have the coronavirus they will give it to others if they don't wear the mask they don't care about anybody else they care about their own self in that kind of a way they don't care but loose end means wear your mask you tie that up oh glory to god and everybody have a certain sense of safety in that sense not giving it to others hallelujah isn't that right hallelujah glory to god you have to watch it because it could be loose ends in the home or if your children don't want to behave their self and they want to run here and run there and fellowship here and socialize here and they could bring the virus straight into the house you have to tie up their loose end oh glory to god hallelujah you cannot do like if this business as usual it is not business as usual well the devil is on a rampage he would stomp out every church he can every pastor he can every minister he can he goes on them out but god promised in the last days there will be a super church a super race i hope you are part of it oh glory to god hallelujah glory to god glory to god it could be loosens in your life loosens in the church loose ends in your home but you have to tie up all the loose ends loses means shutting the back doors in your home that no demon that that comes to the front door will come to a window or back door that back door is what you do how you act how you live because you could be a door that things come and mess up your own home oh hallelujah thank you lord jesus ii timothy 3 the holy spirit warned that they have a form of godliness and would deny the power that went with the right thing having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof yes sir god hates a powerless religion and any religion today that hasn't got christ in it is powerless any religion that crisis is under on his own blood it's got power you say god hates a religion without power your solemn feast is stink he says he said make me sick i hate it he's talking about laodicea her to cold i will spew out my mouth isn't that right god hates powerless religion i want to get that now that means god hates a powerless life think about it now because that that word have to filter down to your very life it's not paul when he churchill is following you are when paul was in you and paul is a new one powering you and powering all of us when we come together there's power in the church because there's power in the individual what did he say about revival the people of the bring the revival where they're beginning from in their homes that we start with nothing in your homes you start to boot up that devil you boot up the magazine don't worry applying the token all the filth all the trash get kicked out your house oh glory to god that applied to tv shows and movies too or to cut them things off because those are doorways and entrance to spirits whether you say amen or not i still say nation god hits a powerless religion it's got to have power in it it's got to have sincerity sincerity brings power how could you be sincere when you're in iniquity or you could be sincere when you're doing the wrong thing how you could be sincere when you know in your heart you're wrong you can't be sincere you could be sincere to repent and then you get right then you could ask god if your heart condemned your god greater than your heart your heart condemning you so god want to release you from that condemnation to bring you into a cleansing that's why go back and listen and study back that message that we talk on tuesday about sanctification what god wants for your life and that is the will of god for your life sincerity brings power a long time you hear that like that sincerity that's why god tell the prophet what be more sincere when god examined the heart and god put all his instruments and so on everybody externally saying big prophet and prophet and prophet but when god put his binoculars and do his zoom zoom and zoom inside there he said i want you to be more sincere that is the realm of the spirit there's the realm of people getting delivered that is in that realm there and that was jesus i sanctify myself for dear sake you have got to make a sacrifice you can sit down like you some king on some throne and god entitled to do this for you and do that for you god entitled to do nothing for you he entitled he sent a prophet and he shall turn half and he put a message here for us to take and apply or give the lord a shout he said hear me when i'm taminacker not talking about his token you've got to apply the token oh glory to god and the token have to be displayed not just applied but displayed it means that you have to take it act upon it and then you have to have it so activated it's had to come back out to you to reflect the very thing that you apply sincerity brings real worship not forms but genuine power worship to know your past from death unto life god wants to perform his word by his power and when the church denies his power how can he perform and vindicate his word when the church explains it away and see from some other day who wants to fulfill that word oh hallelujah praise beaten them of jesus hallelujah loose ends make the church weak powerless loosens in your life making you weak makes you uncompleted incompleted isn't that right it rubs you of spiritual energy so you're feeling tired and weary it drops your joy you don't have it when they visit i was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the lord that that that when that when you're on the loose ends hallelujah you get robbed of that so you struggle to come you come because you don't want people to get backslide you come because you know it's church you want to stay home again people might call and ask how you doing and you don't want to tell them how you're really doing when you tap the loose end you have a pep in your step when you tap to loosen you can't wait to come to church you can't wait to be in the atmosphere you ain't coming because you want to see other members they're coming to worship your king and your lord who brought you out to egypt oh glory to god obviously not sanctification just wesley the journey is sanctification the journey is trials and testing as long as i hit that promised land you're on your journey your journey into an inheritance to a possession that you could walk on all the time the only talking about it and explaining it on the journey in egypt they're gonna talk about it but when you see jordan hit their soul and joshua said three days be crossing over sanctify yourself prepare yourself because we will do signs and warners among us then they're going to cross over to possess that land now then it's trouble for hitler's job besides and all their might because they're there they deer get deer you can't go to set up some swing and some something to swing on and some kind of merry-go-round or something they're not that's it's battling war but it's your land that god gave you it's not that you deserve it but god said this is yours i come to give you this i come to give you joy i come to give you empowerment don't limit yourself don't say because this happened that happened you can't get out god could bless you abundantly more than you could ever ask or think by the power that's already working inside of you oh glory to god don't forget you have you could ask god for big things oh let me remind you you can ask god for great things no no little petty things you know big things start to ask him acts abundantly that your joy might be full god wants you happy you know god wants to enjoy you know it's a serious hour but he wants you to have joy the joy of the lord is your strength oh glory to god by your name people who have a joy too much a loose sense in their life oh give the lord some praises hallelujah a chain is as strong as the weakest link if there's anything that makes christianity lazy it's when are on a flowery bit of ease we don't have it we don't have persecution enough i wonder if i read it right we don't have it hard enough like a brother told me this is good they said well you could revive us i said did this i said the more they come they said they'll go for something else to come he said i said you're born yeah this is go live family this isn't organizing like that this you see nothing yet but i'm talking about discomfort the worst time ever on a people since there ever was a people that you waste time have to go to a terrible time it would be a terrible time you know what if los angeles sink in a month from now and they used to recall from coronavirus you understand what calamity after calamity the earth rocking praise god and all today they're still a bride they're still a bride there is still a bride there is still a bride out of every nation there is still a bride oh glory to god there's gonna be a people on the earth that the devil could only watch but he can't touch because they are from under the seventh seal or give the lord a shout silence cover in them oh give the lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] [Music] this is not a game you may be seated and you come like that drills for something did that drill in the drill and then all of a sudden yeah this is not a drill this is the real thing oh let me start the trail let's continue a chain he said we don't have it hard enough silence inside here i'll give you seven seal break because you find it you find your going through a heart but i'm reading for you that we don't have it hard enough always the chain is as strong as the weakest link so you have a nice strong chain there's a big chain but you know how strong it is once that he devil jabbing on clinks springs he hitting every chain and when he hit your sword you see a reaction he said aha i know i know where to hit them now that's the part you have to protect because he party enemy coming for he knows he know where they hit you and where just where you're weak is where you're coming to get you you come in strong you put big burger proof in front there and you have a back door the back day that don't have nothing there you think you're never making it hard for himself so he go get bull blue torch it torched in front down front target and he have an entrance back there just open entrance and come in because you did that you didn't secure that back door you secured the front door because the already passed it was in front secure but what you didn't secure was the back door you have to tie up the loose ends could we say amen all right a man under pressure is what he is when he's under pressure his real true characteristics will show when he's under pressure get him all riled up and stood up you will see the real man come out if he got temper it will show itself if he's meek and gentle the ritual itself put him under pressure once and god puts all his children on the test to see whether there is any flaws in them flaws before the test coming this flows i mean that's coming to expose more flows what a position interesting to embarrass you know you got to know where the floors are at to tie it up to get it covered to get protected you're the story your life thinks oh lord i can't hear your words whatever you are the life that you live shows what kind of spirit is in you you may impersonate the wrong thing or impersonate the writing you may impersonate a christian but they will by and by come a time when the strain will be put on then it will show what you are a chain is as strong as his weakest link so then he talked about the virtues now this is why he's such a perfect man he's talking about no matter how strong this is built up and that is built up if he got a weak link there's where she breaks so you could be strong in faith i'm gonna fit you speak any word and whatnot and then you see temperance whoo when you see that devil recognize that empress is troubled oh patience oh god but that never rising boy and you get your blowing because your steam run out of patience you see the patient just trying to practice all the time it runs straight out it'll leak out that's why the bible calls for charity to burn the perfectness to seal the whole building that there'll be no leaks in the building after your feet virtue and knowledge and after that charity that come no one come down and seal the whole building the charity get the virtue just sealed inside of you you see on the inside and you sit on the outside you are you're moving anvil oh glory to god when you start to walk like that devil's falling to the right and throwing off yourself to the left they alter your way because a living moving monument is on the earth a son of god just like adam was back in the 8th again you and your jurisdiction and just as adam devil couldn't mess with adam before eve come on the scene he can't mess with you oh glory to god you give him a witness of what it was in the garden of eden back on the earth again oh hallelujah no wonder the prophet said i wish i could lift the shield oh grand them born sons filled sons predestinated sons speak and their word created them just like that all glory to god and our jurisdiction every devilish subject to the sons of god has that have been positionally placed with the pillar fire veiled oh glory to god what a thing to look forward to what a thing to expect hallelujah they ought to be nobody tired and they struggling and they automatic oh you're suppose you have great expectations [Music] oh hallelujah of course a lot of direct things going to come hallelujah nations against nation wars and rumors of wars earthquakes and diverse places pestilence and all kinds of stuff but this gospel must be preached and then shall the end come no no coming until this gospel is preached oh glory to god and the only way this gospel is preached is that bright positionally placed with power to preach his gospel with signs one of the miracles reproducing the original green proven hebrew state in it that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever oh give the lord some praises tonight hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah so you have to have all these virtues inside of there he said when you surrender your complete being then the holy spirit just pours through you watch in these virtues you are living tabernacle you see oh this is a concrete tabernacle you becomes a living tabernacle because the whole spirit is flowing through you why because all the virtues inside of you so he's using his own word or glowing no no flesh and blood trying to play a tango or trying a little thing it's not that it's the holy spirit flowing through the word inside of you you become a conduit you become a branch and divine life is flowing through you they preproduce fruit that's a man full of virtue then people look and see that's a man full of virtue knowledge he believes the word temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness full of love of of the holy ghost what is it a stature that the unbelievers can look and say there's a christian there's a man or woman who knows what they're talking about you've never seen a kinder sweeter godly person you are sealed i see your shoes on both sides whether you're coming or going you are sealed just the same there you are when a man or woman possesses this then the capstone comes down and sees them into the kingdom of god which is the holy ghost i know you know here taught much but when a man possesses this what this fate of birthday kindness then they kept charity the holy ghost itself comes down seal the man inside the idea then that must speak for his servants christ failed oh hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah now to fix a problem you have to recognize that the problem exists i think that would say in a game to fix any problem you have to understand a problem exist because if you don't think the problem exists you can't fix it you can't fix if you don't know there's a problem but david said i acknowledge my transgression and my sin is before me so the first thing is to identify and acknowledge your loose ends no that's not my losers like yours i am mind satire everybody have their own to tie up i'm not hearing you whether you say amen or not you still have to tie it up because if you don't tie it up the devil will tie you up or give the lord a shout is either you tie up your loose ends or the devil tie you up because enticing spirits and classical spirits going to follow loosens identify the loose ends and deal with them by the word hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god but as human nature we avoid or deny many times we go into denial we don't want to accept this is so this is how we going through or this is what taken us or this one overtaking us we don't want to admit it hallelujah loosens can be spiritual physical emotional intellectual or logical sometimes it's not a pleasant thing loose ends is what we push aside loose sense is what you don't want to deal with right loosen the water you prefer to sleep and to deal with it so you sleep longer why do these people go and drink do people go on booze they're certainly loose ends and issues that they don't want to deal with so when they drink it with friends and big loving but it's loose ends inside of there eating them up and they're paying liquor store paying the rum shop or whatever it is and the pain and the pain and the pain all they'll do is to get rid of them loosens and get them spirits off of them and they're free and no more money going for a cigarette no more money going for booze no more money for those kind of things [Applause] because they're getting satisfaction guaranteed by that living fountain oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah so you have to deal with the loose ends you have to bring the loose sense to completion you have to finish you have to meet the demands of what it demands of you you come like there's a leak in the roof and and i don't want to go there but i'm there already the wife said look the wife can't go up there i said kevin leake yeah and there's a lot up there another way the rings had to fall you get bigger and bigger one month past two months past one year past two years past three years when you're ready to stick up last on top of it it's still there we got to study the other girl ladder you go on top of the roof or get somebody to go up the roof and fix it but it has to be done so a lot of things that you have that need to be done after tonight confession of sins hidden for years whatever it means it means to tie up those loose ends oh hallelujah could we continue a little more god tempered this bride together with the spirit the tempest the individual together with that spirit when you are born into that kingdom very life that is in his church that was in life was in the vine jesus is inside of you isn't that right what body do you belong to the body of christ i want to skip down and watch he said no watch there can be a leak up here somewhere there can be a leak in your patience let somebody smite you on one side of the face and you turn the other one but you said that dirty hypocrite then there's a leak somewhere so you see somebody smite here and then it's exposed where you're leaking he said we better leave that alone now when you are sealed into the the body of christ then you are spirit-filled and you're a son of god now when closing i might say this anything different from this is a broken system and will finally leak out what you put in it if you are putting all your hopes all your time and everything in one of those stagnated systems they are broken systems and they will leak out their people put their hopes in churches hopes and pastors and ministers they hope not in christ and they will be disappointed because man will feel them and churches will feel them but jesus never fails so your hope has to be built in jesus christ and his righteousness isn't that right hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord praise god so if we could only be in the objective of this pentecostal move i'll just get down you talk about samson right and blinded and they stood there as big bulk of frame powerless and helpless all at once he began to something feel something happening every five of his body began to be filled with the power of god if the church could only get to that again all the way from the preacher to the deacon to the laity every fiber every member of the body will be filled with the holy ghost those bronies muscles straighten out and he crushed it all together let me die with them lord let me die with them you raised me up to destroy it no i've built myself along it let me destroy myself with it my reputation whatever it is let me destroy it i want to see the power of god again always when the power of god comes in the walls that you built around you fall your denominational walls will crush that's why we know it's no power wrong you know because walls building up them have some stone masons just going with the walls and every every every year the walls going higher and higher and higher as if they put taken those inside the deal with the walls but you have a rain coming you have water coming not i didn't say that and that's prophecy you know and the ducks will swim over the walls there's a great moving spirit going on happen you know that going to break upon people you know you're going to hear more about it on sunday hallelujah hallelujah because you see the people i see the gaussian life yet when that light begins to gush forget it every pedestrian seat have to connect with that because they are the life itself is the spirit of the seed that is in them let me say they're again good they're in churches now but that is not where they belong they belong into the logos which is the full body word which is the fullness of the atonement they belong to this message it's not just a message you know there's a message in the message and the message in the message is the bride's message because this message called tree kind of believers but there's a message in the message that is exclusive for the bride oh glory to god and it it will take the life to leave here he said this being this statue when it's completed is the servant of god in the church of god that's going on a rapture he said nothing but oh glory to god when it is completed hallelujah that means you have to start they have to complete inside of you and then that is what going to the rapture i'd like to say this way it's not you bullying rapture you know what groningen rapture will be inside of you the magnet coming to pick what up inside of you you hosing that but when the magnet come because that is inside of you you going through oh give the lord a shout that's why i said the rapture is inside out not outside in oh glory the rapture going to be in you you can't borrow anybody if you think about it you can't borrow anybody's feet so if you have the rapture and faith that is personal that'll be something inside of you to speak by the revelation of your faith that has to be something inside of you resident inside of you no man can't give that to you oh glory to god to this rapture really is the holy ghost inside of you connecting with the capstone with the same magnetism so no preacher can't stop that no minister could stop that as a son a daughter of god the fire inside that you are fired above you coming to take you up oh glory to god some ufo coming to pick you up and take you over yonder there'll be two in a bed one taking one left one day looking for sister so and so she's gone already brother so and so he gone already you gotta find out if you go in oh glory to god that's why the secret has to be the word and the bride the witch word the full word hollow the entire bible placing you as a seed and then the spirit come right in for that oh my hallelujah oh my my my my let me see if we could finish here whoo short message right that's because short term hallelujah i trust it's effective to you i trust it help you i trust you don't take it lightly not the shortness of it you know but the content of it what it's supposed to do for you which man going to battle with consider the cost that's an examination that's the script to be read which i'm going and bill wouldn't check out first if we have the ability to finish what he started people like this bad things but if you leave it unfinished is that collusion it is not finished it is not completed you just start in the star i stop i start last year after five years ago i reached here he was the vision you what the prophet say is not him who starts it's him who finishes he said many stats but only one group will finish is the overcomers oh i feel like we're running tonight you say many stats but only one group finishes the overcomers to be overcomer you had to overcome something give the lord a shout you have to be given something to overcome so when you get tests you are blessed to get the test it makes you separate from the rest just to get the test oh god you should be so happy because them dead members are not tested to get really you know then there's going through and going through and going through but the bride tests after test after test trial after trial after trial oh give the lord a praise offer oh my my my my let me see your farm oh glory to god hallelujah we shall come please believe it or not let's have two more pages ah i just like to deliver what god gave me to deliver him so it is a subset of sunday message you have to tie up your loose ends you have a message you're getting the message tonight a word from the lord tie up the loosens in your life hallelujah oh glory to anything unfinished tied up anything outstanding tie it up you have to do tie it up you have to repent you have to say this or what tie it up get it out that you can have the confidence now to approach god they come at the communion table somebody not taking communion why why they're not taking communion life not right wind up why your life is not right why you cannot take communion something is wrong resolution in your life because everybody is supposed to take communion and the only reason that you're not taking it is because something is wrong in your life we need to get to that you need to get to that deal with that get right with god and partake of the bread another wine remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts and the book of revelation shows how the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it how lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes satan revealing his works uh the attempted destruction of god's people and if and and he fights and and right down to the time he's cast in the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows here we go if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits working within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit and i was thinking about this thing about this word design and how there's such a great need of this illness because you have in this wilderness will protect you from spirits and deceivers ask god for diseasement designment of spirit oh hallelujah by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her he will be definitely tortured today as when christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes satan hates revelation but we love it where true revelation allies the gates of hell cannot prevail against it but we will prevail against them oh glory to god when the church allowed herself to move away from the original like adam and eve dead set in there was no strength in her she has become a monstrosity the minute the church moved towards form and ceremony and towards priesthood by organizing the ministers into a group that decided leadership apart from the holy spirit and his word that very moment dead entered and she started to get sick and as she got sick here we go she changed to a powerless group of people whose only weapon was argument only weapon i write you wrong mysteries you don't have none i have this you have that you have this only argument she could produce nothing in the spirit for her hopes were built on program and not faith in his word they sold program they reprogram the supervision the repertoire children so whatever you need to do to close and to tie up that loose end go do it i ain't talking about talking all this is getting into action this is you confronting yourself and sitting down because our enemy come in and you have to know how you're going to wage war and if you have what it takes to deal with what's coming don't think it's business as usual this coronavirus confirm is not business as usual all demoting is business as usual getting flogged fair it is not business as usual okay i'm finished you could play something what are loose ends the untidy stuff the area of weakness the area of leakage and when those areas are tied up the weakness disappears and you feel that strength coming back to you again hallelujah illusion in the garment or dress an area of weakness that make you dress weak and it provokes the avenue for further weakness when the devil find that weak spot and he hit your dear he come back again he want to break you and destroy you that leakage is where you lose the energy where you become less productive keeps you in a depressed mode you just don't know what to do you just don't have the strength and everything else but when they begin to tap the loose ends power comes back strength come back you have to be able to identify and acknowledge your loose ends is not right and to deal with them whether it's painful whether it's difficult whether it's unpleasant you still have to deal with it don't push it any further don't delay any longer deal with it tonight loosens can be spiritual physical emotional intellectual electrical you have to bring it to completion you have to fulfill your mandate to correct things to straighten out things to get your soul in order to get yourself right with god whatever you got to do do it let's all stand let's pray father god i pray tonight that your holy spirit will overshadow the people and what i could not say and didn't say well may you say it to them that they will know what they have to tie up in their own lives that they will sit down and think it through and come the course may this be such a sobering time for each one here those that are connected here tonight and those that would hear this message may they search your hearts out lord and if you could take tell a prophet be more sincere what about us tonight we struggle we we pain we we fight we we do this and do that but lord we pray tonight that you will help us may that spirit of wisdom discernment understanding revelation
