========================================

[Music] [Music] [Music] then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom carried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgin saying lord lord open to us but he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man coming [Music] oh it's going to be a wonderful day some more some of these times to show you if the resurrection is going to be universal there will be two in the field and i'll take one and two in the bed and i'll take one see it'll be the night one place in daylight on the other side of the earth be a universal resurrection that rapture the trumpet of god shall sound and every one of these of this little church here here here and even that little bunch that went through there come out here here here when that virgin that virgin when she's seen in the seventh watch that i remember there were seven virgins is that ryan i mean five virgins one out ten virgins went out to meet the lord five was wise and five was foolish is that right and now in the watchable there were seven watches and at the end of the seventh watch some spec from this watch this one this one this one that the seventh watch there was a voice went out behold the bridegroom cometh going out to meet him and they rose and trimmed their legs and all these others goes down to here oh won't that be a wonderful time [Music] pastor solomon nucino and the life tabernacle in tamale ghana presents lamp trimming time a virtual convention to close out 2021 this will include ministers from the uk ivory coast usa ghana nigeria tnt and south africa with greetings singing worship and special presentations from all around the world we invite you to come and rejoice and worship with us at this time we'd like to introduce the host pastor pastor solomon nichino god bless you saints it's good to be in the house of the lord we thank god for his grace for his goodness for his mercy and for keeping us alive to see this day i certainly want to welcome you all to this year's convention 2021 under the team behold the bridegroom comet lam dreaming time we live in such a time that the grace of god has been faithful to us and when the son of man cometh is he going to find the faith is he going to find people that are still holding on to the promised world and we thank god that we are alive today that when he comes he will find the people that are standing in the fate so i want to take this opportunity to greet you all in the name of the lord jesus christ greet all the ministers and the pastors that will preach that will greet all the specials that will be sung i trust that the lord will be it will be a blessing to you this weekend and the lord will visit you in your local homes in your churches and wherever the tape is played so the inspiration for the convention is behold the bridegroom cometh lamb trimming time it's time to dream our lives it's not just to know that he's coming but we have to make the effort to make sure that when he comes we are ready so i trust that the lord as the messages come forth the lord will bless you the lord will quicken the words to your hearts that your lives will not be the same again we live in a time that is so deadly now we can't even trust what we are breathing into our system but in the midst of all that god has a bride those are the bride that he's coming for and the scriptures say we shall not all sleep praise god but we shall be changed so we are going to receive a promise of his word that change is going to come and when it comes we will be quickened even as he is praise god we're not all going to sleep we shall lose that our life and remain to the coming of the lord we will have our lamb straight and we shall be changed to meet the lord in the air so i trust that the lord will bless us all and before i go i just want to read luke chapter 5 verse 36 to 39 and he speak a parable unto them saying no man put a piece of new garment onto an old if otherwise then move them then build the new wine make it a rent and the piece that was taken out of the new agreed not with the old no man put new wine into old bottles else the new wine will burst the bottles and then and be spilled and the bottles shall perish but new one must be put into new bottles and both are preserved praise god verse 39 no man also haven't drunk old wine straightway desired new for he said the old is better so we are not changing this gospel for any other thing we are not changing the promises of the prophet's word to us for any other thing and we know that the holy ghost is desiring the heart of the believer we must be changed in order for the spirit to come and quicken our mortal bodies for the coming of the lord so i trust that god will reveal himself to us even as the messages are coming forth as the ministers are preaching and pounding away don't just look at it as another virtual convention but get in the spirit praise god because every word spoken will not return back void but it shall accomplish for the people for which it was sent praise god amen so brother brahma said here in adoption paragraph 117 is that ten vegans went out to meet the lord all sanctified all believing the message all believing that god is coming back all believing that god has sent the prophet all holy every one of them sanctified five were diluted and let the alarms go out praise god so he's oppressed now we've got to press praise go to the mark of the high calling that is in christ jesus amen five hundred oil in their lambs and that is where we identify we want to have the oil in our lambs every day every moment every season praise god no matter what the enemy will throw at us the lamb is burning the light is shining praise god hallelujah oh five hund oil in the alarms and behold the bridegroom comet and the five that had oil in the alarms went in to the wedding supper and all others were left out where they were whipping and wheeling and gnashing of teeth be ready for you don't know what minute the lord comes praise god what is the oil represented in the bible the holy spirit praise god so we need the holy spirit to keep us burning we need the holy spirit to be the standard against the enemy we need the holy spirit to connect us to the coming of the lord oh blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah oh praise god hallelujah said in this minor church eight paragraph two three four he said aren't you glad to be in that little minority group tonight that keeps the faith praise god for it was his commandment fear no little flock is your father's good will to give you the kingdom and except this work would be cut short there will be no flesh saved see we are right at the end time praise god oh praise god it is he that promised the rapture it is he that promised the holy spirit and he is faithful that promised praise god so keep faith tonight keep faith this morning and know that god is able to fulfill his word paragraph two three six and i'm done he said the pentecostals becoming cold off lukewarm sputtered out of the mouth of god just a little bitty group pulled out here and you are that group praise god that god thought of you before the foundations of the world and made a way of escape for you today so don't be afraid you shall be filled you shall be sealed you shall receive the promise hallelujah just a little bit group just a little bitty group pulled out there just a few but in all but in that will come the behold the bridegroom cometh in that little bitty group will come behold a bridegroom comet and when it does every one of these watches every watch of these watches from paul all the way to elijah our time every one of these watches remember there's been seven watches of

mission bible church in ottawa canada it's a great privilege to speak to all the participants who will be enjoying this convention this online convention that life tabernacle in tamily is organizing this convention is starting on december 23 2021 the theme that the lord has provided for this life tabernacles online convention is behold the bridegroom cometh and i believe that it is a very timely theme which the lord has provided i pray to the lord jesus christ that as you participate in this convention that you open your hearts and open your your souls to receive all the supernatural blessings that i believe the lord has in store for you now as we approach these very momentous times i want to remind all the participants in this great online convention that is coming up very shortly that israel as was predicted by the bible has been back in palestine since 1948 and they've been waiting for the arrival of moses and elijah who will introduce them to the messiah they've been praying you can see them at the wailing wall crying out to god to visit them as they do that it is a sign to us a gentile believers the bride that the hour for the rapture is at hand i also want to put you in remembrance that the world as we know it today is going through what they call the global reset that will surely lead to the establishment of a new world order to usher in eventually the antichrist the bible has spoken a lot about the antichrist the son of perdition who will come and rule this world but you and i have been assured by the word of god and by the message of the hour that the bride will not go through that great tribulation that is soon to hit the face of the earth also we should not lose sight of the fact that the prophecies concerning america are coming to pass the prophet told us that america made a fatal mistake in 1956 and since that time the power of america has been waning you all saw what happened in the disastrous withdrawal from afghanistan and many things that are happening uh in that nation also we see the rise of china and russia because god is preparing these nations to use them to bring judgment to this world and so that's also happening we also see ah the tremendous shaking that is taking place in the churches around the world we see that world council of churches has finally come to a place where they have managed to rope in all the churches into their fold except the message of the hour what a tremendous event that has transpired to bring to fulfillment what has been predicted by the prophet in the message of the hour and through this shaking we've also seen many of the people in the message churches are falling away now apostle paul uh predicted that the falling away will come first the man of sin will not be revealed until the falling away takes place and we are seeing and witnessing it with our own very eyes indeed we also even seen the cooling off that is taking place in the churches the lukewarm spirit of love is here that has just taken a hold of the people now pray to god that through this convention there will be the release of the anointing of the holy spirit that will revive god's people everywhere also we see rome the purple curtain remember the prophet told us about three curtains he said there is a the bamboo curtain which is uh china the iron curtain which is uh russia and he said the purple curtain which is rome he said watch that purple curtain rome will rule the world again and we see a pontiff that has all that he needs to be able to rise to the occasion and is rising to the occasion to take over the governorship of this world it's coming but the good news is that the bride is also organized and have come together under the burner of the holy spirit amen god is calling the bride from everywhere around the world to what to prepare them for the home going amen the rapture so we are very excited about that when we hear about it our hearts rejoice with exceeding great joy now pray to god that as you participate in this life tabernacle online convention starting on december 23rd of this year to december 26th i pray to god that all the servants of god that will be used to bring forth the messages will cause the bride to trend your lambs i i'm persuaded in my heart that this is lamp trimming time i also pray to god that if you haven't put on the garment of righteousness yet this is the time to do it put a garment of righteousness on because it's been given to us by the opening of the word of god amen the bible has become a new book to us the bible says that the bride will put on that garment you must put it on and put it on during this online convention of the life tabernacle i also pray that you keep the faith amen this is the time when god expects his children to hold on unto the word of god that has been revealed to us jesus said when the son of man comes will he find faith on the earth i pray to god that you will be the one that will be holding on unto the faith that has been ushered and given to us that original faith amen and also i pray that this will be the time of soul-searching i believe that god is calling the church to a time of searching our hearts we must search our hearts and be sure that we are standing in the faith amen and so may the lord jesus during this convention of the life tabernacle causes blessings to be poured upon everyone may the virtue the power of god flow through the messages that will be coming to the people that everyone that will participate will be anointed by the holy spirit and will be refreshed recharged stimulated by the revelation hallelujah the wine of the revelation hallelujah to just stay in your souls again may god bring forth life as we hunt for the souls maybe out of this effort of the life tabernacle that allah soul will come into the sheepfold may god also use this time to bring healing and deliverance to everyone that will participate in this convention may the power of god be so real that everyone that is not well while they are listening to the messages will just be instantly healed in your very homes may the holy spirit prepare you and prepare your heart for the rapture that is soon to take place i love you and i i pray that you have a great time in this convention and made great testimonies come out of this effort and i commend everyone into the hands of the lord jesus christ that his mercies and his blessings will rest upon this convention now and forevermore amen [Music] dear lord jesus we thank you so much said you came in our life and transformed the lord from a life of a sinner to a of a saint to life together with you lord [Music] and with the assurance that we will never be separated we thank you so much that we know you lord [Music] as you know us lord may these few minutes now lord jesus be dedicated for you in jesus christ's name amen you may be seated hallelujah praise the lord praise the lord praise the lord hallelujah amen so greetings in the name of the lord jesus christ to all our friends to all the ministers and to all the precious believers that are connected to this wonderful convention and we greet also our brother nashina and his wife and family and church said brought out this tremendous inspiration for this end-of-year convention hosted by brother nashina and the title is of this great inspiration behold the bridegroom comments lamp dreaming time now i many of the ministers will speak anointed over the subject but i will take two two verses and just reflect a little bit in my greetings and maybe an encouragement for you verse 6 a midnight cry go ye out to meet him this is something personal it's always with jesus something personal uh in the midnight hour say midnight cry is gone out i believe this did you receive it says midnight cry go out and meet him because he he is the one that changes you he is the one that makes you perfect that has made you perfect already he is the one that gives you eternal life and verse 10 they that were ready went in with him so it's another personal thing to go in with him and to be prepared be ready be connected with him you know that you have an experience you know that you are sealed in there's nothing can get you out of this fellowship it's a love affair with him isn't it it's a love affair with him and brother bryan said something wonderful here and i want to reflect it from this side there are so many sides of the coming of the son of man it's personal he must come personal to you and personal to me the prophet said he comes to catch away his pride like a love affair secretly maybe nobody knows except you that's what i say he steals her out at night time and now he says this remarkable half sentence takes her away from the world you see he takes her to him to his atmosphere to his kingdom to his reality to his unseen world to the to that kingdom of that fountain of love says eternal love and he helps you and he he gets you out of this world as you feed on his words like a bride feeds on the words of a bridegroom what he says to her you feed on these promises said he gives to you personally see there are words that you like said your human said your human nature your reasoning likes like goodness and mercy will follow me all of my life it changes you jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever this evil food and evil food is for eagle wings the eagle is not created to be in the nest like an airplane is not created for the airplane factory and we are not created to stay and stay in a local church all the time we are created for a fellowship with jesus christ in our personal life this is where we are an eagle is created not for a nest but he is created to fly but there is a period where you stay in the nest and we get eel food fresh killed manna hidden manna said the world no no no nothing about it fresh-killed manner and if if we are sincere and takes this insight eat it digest it in our inner being sin we will grow our wings will grow we will we will start to some things that we never did before we were just coming out of the eggs and sitting in the ground sitting on the ground and then by this eagle food we something lifts our our wing lifts our wings something and lifts more we eat more illegal food it means we believing the word for our personal for us we believe in strong food that the world cannot never believe jesus said love your enemies this is a love command a command out of love to keep us safe said we and if we do this out of love not of out of of obedience a true wife a true bride obeys the husband because of love jesus said if if you love me you will keep my words and we do self-love because he spoke it out of love because if we would hate our enemy the devil would come and bring us migraine and and we could we would get sick because we would go inside get in such a complex but jesus helped us and if he says so then it's possible if he accepts the word and we say lord jesus for sure where is my next enemy i love him it's very easy not for his mind not for this stuff up here these five senses it's impossible but for the inward soul for the inward man is satisfied with this ill food and so our words we could continue for for thousands of weeks to to speak about this eating food but we have to digest it if they adjust it repent and be baptized for the remission of my sins jesus this is a love affair he wants me free from sin he said tell tell me said you are wrong and i will i will tell you said i have forgotten all this you are perfect in my sight it is such a glorious experience then this experience lifts you it lifts you in an unseen world in the world where jesus lives and this is how we prepare ourselves this house is oil goes into our vessel inside inside and and you know it's you start to know it's a it's a carrying power a carrying dynamic come is coming into you he helped me there i know i i could stretch here i i and i feel this i can get out of this world hallelujah i cannot get out and i he knows me and i know him so it is it is in a glorious affair and he says he says it takes her away from the world don't you want this from your desires from your lust from your understanding what you learned and all this in a in a dimension of love in the dimension of god in a in a godly atmosphere you live in a godly atmosphere all the time and this is prepared for us so he says he says see you love him express the word of god and because you love him you keep his words and keeping his word takes you away from this world hallelujah this glorious evil food yeah yeah so so hallelujah my time is going but anyhow the promises you think how can i be an adopted son to speak the word when you eat and digest these promises these promises are growing you into adoption if we swallow them like the eagles the fresh killed meat and i chest them and we stretch our wings and you feel that different atmosphere you feel a different dimension you feel that world where jesus lives it brings you into it hallelujah so this is this is real and you exercise it and so he takes you away from this world away from yourself you see he takes you away from yourself this is deliverance takes you away from yourself there are situations coming your old nature would fly up and then and uh insulation is coming but jesus said if if somebody hits you here and because of love he told you and your your your human mind says it is very it's very hard to to to show him this side said he can hit it here also but this is the way jesus was and this is his life it is love and if we obey the word and say we don't have to defend ourselves it is jesus's love that defends us and we enter into this world then many things become easy in our life and many complexes will drop from us as you are keeping his word not because of obedience because of love and it brings you in a different world to abide forever it is influencing you and it's called continue continually going on is it it is in a continually and continual pentecost continual serenes are blowing and it's not you know on housetop and then and then down and up it it goes into the valley but you always feel you always feel his power always feel his power he he he's always with you whatever happens he prepares you always it's it's his life continual sends his wins it's been our continual pentecost the blood of jesus christ continually cleanses you you make a mistake like the little eagle he he pulls pulls on the meat and something drops and he hurts his other eagle brother but he is listening to il mama and el papa and they give the food not the brother gives the food there's no brother that gives the food it's the parents so he gives the food is god he gives the food he uses uses other eagles but he himself is a one that gives us to your soul such a try to serve him to worship him to abstain from evil it's it's born in you all this nature is born in you as you love him as you love his word you you are hungry to hear more of this wonderful world of this wonderful wonderful life and [Music] a dimension where you realize you live in the presence of his spirit you live can you imagine you live in the presence of his will and then start to believe in it i am predestinated to live in the presence of his will god bless you in jesus christ's name and keep it keep these few words it is another world the kingdom of god and you live either in this world in this natural world or you live continually in this other world this is a promise and this promise will come so alive in some of his people may not be many that will come so alive that jesus christ will have full control through them and in them and it will sweep this world i believe it with all my heart just continue to dedicate yourself to him and obey his voice whatever your human mind is thinking and your mind will change into the mind of christ and he will have a great progress and out of the talents he gave you you will make more talents and out of out of see the things he gave you you will you will do greater things hallelujah we have such a great promise just experience the love of god and and speak with him and connect with him personally and don't wait till somebody pioneers before you but pioneer yourself in the in the heavenlies and
