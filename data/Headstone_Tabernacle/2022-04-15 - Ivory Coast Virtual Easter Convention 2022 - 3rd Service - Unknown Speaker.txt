love you and we worship you today blessed be your holy name hallelujah hallelujah amen amen but as you have your seats one more time praise god we'd like to pause praise god as we have a greeting uh coming in from one of our overseas ministering brethren we're here at the great convention amen and to greet you so god bless you amen as he comes and greets you amen and christian love amen we welcome him today amen so god bless you as he comes amen god bless you brothers and sisters today i would like to send you a greeting from germany and i would especially like to send my greetings to brother paul in abhijan from the ivory coast and i'm happy that we can have fellowship with each other like this i would like to call out to you with a few words of encouragement nothing new but i think it is so important keep going the road we still have to travel is certainly not far even if it becomes increasingly difficult we are looking up to heaven the political and economic situation here in europe is very frightening in the face of this terrible war but we know that god's judgment hanging over this world to judge the poor of babylon is being prepared we would like to escape from all these pressures and inconveniences but we know that there is only one way to get out of this dilemma and that is to go up in a rapture roman chapter 8 verse 22 to 25 contains the forces we all know well for we know that the whole creation growneth and travail it in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth why does he yet hope for but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patients wait for it paul says that not only they the creation groan but also we who have the first fruits of the spirit the people of that time were baptized with the holy spirit and yet they groaned even peter whose shadow was sufficient to heal the sick they did not obtain it because they had to wait until the fullness of the gentiles was called out that is why they waited for the adoption the redemption of their body and paul urges us to wait in patience but this is also very important to understand that jesus tells his disciples in luke 21 verse 28 that there will be a time for us to lift up our heads because our redemption is drawing nigh this is the redemption of our bodies our souls are redeemed we are sons and daughters from the beginning attributes of god but there is a quality in the sons and daughters of god that shall become invisible at the end of time that will bring a great change the speaking of the word the fullness of the third pull and the transformation of our earthly body into a glorified body we have understood that these things can only come forth in fullness when the pressure on earth comes to a certain point and it is rapidly increasing due to a pandemic and war with international implications we can learn something from the great pentecost 2000 years ago pentecost 2000 years ago brought about such a tremendous change or innovation so that this earthly body had to obey the spirit of god and they begin began to speak in new tongues so that the gentiles could grasp the gospel for their heard the believers speaking in their own languages will not something similar happen again at the end of time that the gospel will be returned to the jews we think of the two witnesses moses and elijah and the saints will be called out of the tombs a bride ready to be the final voice in the final age it took the transformation of tongues to call the gentiles will there not also be a transformation of the bodies in calling those who have died in christ how wonderful brother branham has explained this great mystery to us jesus said say to this mountain you have heard about what's been taking place that's the ministry that we are entering into we are way up the road now soon the coming of the lord jesus and we have got to have rapturing faith in a church that can be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and go out or will not go but don't worry it will be there it will be there and when the power of this church our church the bride in the end time rises it will bring its brethren the power of that church the overcomers from the church age before our age rises will bring its brethren the power of that church will bring the other brethren then there will be a general resurrection and we know at the end after the millennium there will be a white throne judgment and we are looking forward to it oh what a time we are entering now brother branham said his great glorious presence shall strike the earth he cometh in clouds oh i love that clouds there will be a wave after a wave of his glory will come across the earth and the resurrection of the saints shall come when that blessed holy spirit that lived in their hearts and they died with their corpse laying there and the deer stains over their cheeks and things like that and they are placed out here in the graveyard a great wave of that same spirit and a wash wave after wave he that was last will be first and he that was first will be last how can it be that way that's the order of the resurrection won't know nobody in the generation before me or the generation after me i'll know those in the generation of this and every generation will come successfully right as it went down they which were last will be first sure it has to be see i'll know my people the next fellow my dad will know his people his grandfather his people on down like that wave after wave after wave after wave and the saints arising from everywhere won't that be wonderful brothers and sisters soon very soon we will gather if not on earth there will be a gathering in the air what a glorious day god bless you amen

eternal father we thank you o lord jesus that we are found in your presence this morning and lord this is the day that the lord has made and we will be glad and rejoice in it and father god we we pray

alone may you come of father god and speak spirit spoken words may your father god your seed word find good ground and lord that it may come to a manifestation in your brides flesh your father god jesus for that's the word in us made flesh i pray your father god for the reading of the word that you may bless it oh lord and we pray father god even for the service may you come o lord jesus and just take glory in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and amen amen greetings church in the name of the lord jesus christ you may be seated just for a short greeting so uh this morning again i'm standing on behalf of the pastor for the virtual convention for cote d'ivoire ivory coast hosted by pastor paul on jake jacob so just on behalf of the pastor etmb johannesburg south africa we just want to greet the virtual convention in the name of the lord jesus christ and then also just to acknowledge the ministers that will be preaching the ministers that will be greeting we want to thank god for them and appreciate each and every one that will be watching these meetings when it's streamed may the lord bless you grant your heart's desires now brother paul's theme of the convention i just want to read that before we go into the scripture reading the theme of the convention is the life of christ in you is the vindication of the rapture and his inspiration is the revelation by the life of christ and so my message today is purely on the revelation of jesus christ and i trust and believe that it will be a blessing why because i'm preaching from a vindicated word that the prophet of malachi 4 had already brought and i pray that it will be a blessing to you today and also to the audience that will be watching it afterwards when we stand to our feet just to invite you to the reading of the word i've got three portions of scripture first one is second corinthians 3 and we'll read from verses 18 and if you want to keep the other one ephesians 3 9 and in colossians 1 15 and we'll read from there if you found it second corinthians 3 from verses 18 it says but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord and then if we can go to ephesians 3 9. it says and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in god who created all things by jesus christ and then i want to go to verses 26 to 29 it says that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that he being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all sins what is the breath and length and depth and height and to know the love of christ which passeth knowledge that he might be filled with all the fullness of god now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us unto him be glory in the church by christ jesus throughout all ages world without end then the last one colossians 1 and we read from verses 15. who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist my and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it please the father that in him should be all fullness dwell and then let's go to 26-29 same chapter even the mystery which has been hit from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach this is paul warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus where unto i also labor striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated amen my the scripture is already anointed [Applause] amen i trust you're going to be preaching with me this morning and uh i'm going to do brother luke i can't do brother raymond because that's two big shoes to fill so church the title of the message is uh living images of the living god subject revelation and manifestation an inspiration messiah it's on the earth again now in a message christianity versus idolatry the prophet says this he says you and i are made partakers of his holiness why because we are made in his image the prophet says we are living images of the living god and he says now when he says the living god he says he's not talking about a mythical or an imaginary god some way but he's talking about a living god and then he turns around in that message he says what is a living god he says it's the word in you making itself real and so therefore it's a living god that is being made manifest in living tabernacles so you and i are the living tabernacles that the living god is making himself known at this end time now the prophet says now god according to john cena 1 1 god was the word he says god is the word and if he is made manifest in you then it means that the word is made flesh again the very same way that the word was made flesh in him now looking at the inspiration of the convention i mean i just couldn't get away from this i mean this entire message is just built around christ is the mystery of god revealed and you know how the prophet breaks it down we talks about the threefold purpose of god the threefold unfolding of god and the threefold revelation of god and and you come to the realization that the bride is part of that unfolding why because you and i fulfill the second part of the threefold unfolding so you were part of the revelation of god himself for the purpose to bring back fallen eve he says to back to that hidden condition now if you look at the word revelation it says that it's a divine unfolding it's a disclosure it's an unfolding of himself or an unveiling of himself to you and that's a revelation now in christ is the mystery of god revealed he says now do you know that god is known by simplicity and of a revelation of jesus christ to the most illiterate person so in other words you get this revelation only by god you cannot get this revelation by your education not by your denomination not by being a good self or being a good moral christian he says he's christ is known only by a revelation of jesus christ and this is what we're going to base this entire message on my mind give the lord and praise for that [Applause] the prophet continues he says and by this revelation he's bringing his life to the body now he's the head the church is his body but by the revelation he brings his life to the body and for what he says in a vindication for the rapture and as we go along you'll see how it unfolds because all of this is the threefold purpose of god in matthew 16 18 who do you say peter i am well some say you are elias some say you one of the prophets jesus christ zoned into him and he said i'm not interested in what the group says i'm not interested in what your church says i'm interested to hear what you say who do you say i the son of man am and what did peter turn around he said thou art the christ the son of the living god now peter flesh and blood has not revealed this to you flesh and blood can never reveal this to you only my father in heaven can reveal this mystery can reveal it to you [Applause] and on that revelation he builds his church not on peter not on the catechism not only denomination upon the revelation of who jesus christ is to the individual that is where he builds his church by the revelation and by the revelation he has his preeminence in the body my am i it's powerful now in a message christ is the mystery of god revealed the prophet says jesus said at that day will know then the prophet turns around and he says which day he says this day you will know it and then he says when the revelation is made known then you will know that i mean my father my father is in me i am in you when the revelation is made known then you will know my my mind let's give the lord and the priest caleb give me more volume [Applause] he continues he says when the revelation comes forth then it's in you and you in me he says now do you see the threefold purpose of god unfolding himself now all of hell is against this revelation all of hell is against this teaching he says all of hell is against this truth why because it exposes him it takes away your spiritual amnesia why because it shows you who you are it shows you what plan what what what uh position you play in this drama in this unfolding of god himself so all of hell is against it yes the prophet says but it's truth nonetheless and it's these divinely revealed mystery truths that will literally turn the hearts of the children back to the pentecostal fathers so peter on this rock of the revelation of who i am to you is where i will build my church now he says the gates of hell can not never will prevail against this revelation in exposition of the seven church ages now satan knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater works the prophet says she will be an invincible army and that's the revelation that's the reason why christ him said the grace of el canned not prevail why because she becomes an invincible army because of the revelation of jesus christ now satan hates revelation the prophet says he hates it but you and i we love revelation [Applause] why because by the true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against it my my mind he continues and he says now what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the revelation is perfectly in harmony what are you going to do when that revelation becomes in harmony he says the church will know and she will realize the position if the church knew it then he says she will one day amen amen and give the lord and praise my my my mind i just want to get out i want to get it out now in matthew 11 25 the prophet says this what the scripture says now i thank you father lord of heavens and earth that you that heed these things from the eyes of the wise and the prudent and you have revealed it to the babes that will learn i thank you father that you have kept it for these who the prophet further down in another quote he says the sons of god then he turns around and he says we're the sons of god it's the same sons of god that he told job about where were you when the sons of god shouted for joy so when he comes and he reveals that mystery to you you are those sons of god that shouted for joy from before the foundation of the world amen why am i my mind so he's bringing that revelation to you why because you had representation before the foundation of the world amen who is this melchizedek the whole bible is the revelation of god the whole church is built upon the revelation of god there is no other way to know god only by revelation to whom the son will reveal him revelation everything is revelation and then he turns around and he says now not to accept revelation he says then all you are you are only a cold theologian and he says then there is no hope for you mine so in christ is the mystery of god reveal the prophet says that paul knew jesus by the revelation he says the very same way that peter knew empire revelation now paul did not meet him in the flesh even though they had lived in the same time period he he wasn't he didn't have the privilege of meeting him in the flesh he says but peter knew him in the flesh so in other words he knew him he was associated with him but peter also knew him by a revelation in other words really knew who this man was what was tabernacle behind that flesh and by that revelation he knew him now the prophet turns around again he says now you know that paul had something greater than any of these apostles now they could have turned around and said but paul we knew him we fished with him we walked with him we were with him on the campaign trail but paul saw him [Music] in in a different light he saw him in the way that the israelites saw it now he continuously says paul saw him after he was dead buried and rose why because he expressed himself to paul in the pull of fire when he said to him paul why are you persecuting me well who are you lord i am jesus and paul knew because he could identify within the polar fire this this this is what they knew the overwatch because that great pillar of fire is what led the children out of israel paul knew him as he was a burning a flame in the bush that had spoken to moses now the prophet says he proved to paul that he was the same yesterday today and forever in other words he was the god that the israelites knew he was god jehovah he was god jesus in the flesh and he turned back to god in the pillar of fire now the prophet says now can you imagine that revelation that peter had is that paul he said no wonder you could separate the law from grace because he got that perfect revelation straight from god now the prophet says in christ is the mystery and here he is today now remember he preached christ is the mystery in 6307 and this was just after the seals he says yeah he is today in the same manner by the same pillar of fire expressing himself and vindicating himself the same he's revealing the mystery of god that's been hit since the foundation of the world that was the ministry of the son of man in a son of man my mama let's give the lord and praise now the holy ghost is the only revealer of this divine revelation of jesus christ and it will only reveal it to the predestinated seed all that the father has given me will come and no man will come except the father draws him so the revelation comes to the predestinated seed now let's look at the threefold revelation of god spoken word is the original seed the prophet says that god the father was god that lived in the pillar of fire god the father lived in the sun why because the sun was only an expression the sun was the expressed image of god he was the image of the unseen god expressed in the sun and now because of the sun's death burial and resurrection he comes now as the holy spirit to dwell in the church to fulfill exactly what he did and he fulfills and he lives his life through the bright body the very same way he did in the sun why because it's the same spirit that was in the sun give the lord a praise amen my my my mind so the threefold purpose god wanted to reveal himself he wanted to make himself known the prophet says he wanted to make himself material because god is the spirit now he says how could he do it being this great being being this fountain of eternity he says he covered all of space and eternity it would have been too mysterious how could he reveal himself to man by becoming man the prophet says and what did he do he manifested himself as son son of man and he says no wonder he kept saying that the son of man they must they didn't see it or in other words they didn't catch what he was saying now as the sun he could express himself now the unseen god can be touched and he come to now now this is the unfolding this is the revelation of jesus christ that was heat from before the foundation of the world now the second fold is he wants to have a preeminence in a body of believers the prophet says his bride he wants to live in people because that is the very purpose that man was created for in the first place before the fall man was created for the indwelling of jesus christ for the indwelling of god himself that he can work through them and in them to fulfill his purpose [Applause] now the prophet says for what purpose it's to bring her back to eden is to bring back fallen eve back to eden then he says now what is god's purpose in all of this because i can say why did he let adam and eve fall why didn't he just prevent that from happening the prophet says then he is the entire attribute would not have been made known in other words in him was to be a savior now in that message he says how could god be a savior he says only through christ in him wants to be his son how could god be the son he says only through christ in him was to be a healer how would he be a healer he says only through christ now we see that all things are wound up in that one person the lord jesus christ [Applause] can we see the unfolding do you understand this mystery do we understand the unfolding of the revelation of jesus christ let's move on amen my christ is the mystery of god revealed the prophet says this secret of mystery is now revealed what is revealed god is manifested he says god and man had become one the anointed man he says the christ what does christ mean it means the anointed one then the prophet asked he says the question what is anointed one what was he anointed with he says he was anointed with the fullness of the godhead bodily that made him christ the anointed one that made him the messiah he says and for what purpose was god manifested it was to show god to man now this secret of mystery is now revealed only the prophet of malachi 4 could say that what is a secret it is something that is known not known or seen what is a mystery it's something that is difficult or impossible to understand but the secret of this mystery is now revealed god and man has become one my my mind let's give the lord a praise for that god and man has become one amen [Applause] he is the head of the body and by his own spirit the prophet says the body will move he will have preeminence in his church he says why because that's his rightful position because he is the head of the body the body will move by the intelligence of the head and by the spirit and like we preached before the very same way that eve's body was quickened to life by the dynamics of of adam my invisible union of the bride of christ in saint john the first chapter in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the same was made flesh and dwelt among us christ was the living word oh he always was the word he still is the word he always will be the word he was only the manifestation of the attribute of god for he was the son of god the only begotten of the father now this is a beautiful quote and we've read it before but just listen to what the prophet says because this alone just encapsulates it it gives you your purpose why you are here now he says any son is the attribute of his father and just as you were in the genes of your father in the body of your father when he was a young boy you were in him yet he could not have fellowship with you now when you are in your father you don't know you don't have recollection but you are in him as an attribute now the only way he could have fellowship with you is by the wedding grounds of the mother and he says now you are brought forth into the earth and you become in the image of your father and then you can have fellowship with you and so when they look at the baby elixir why because he's an attribute of his father he's now made manifest now the father can fellowship with him now here's the beautiful part about it the prophet says so and so were you sons of god and daughters of god before they even was a moon stars or a molecule now just as i was in my father i don't have a recollection of that but yet i was there now so you are sons and daughters of god you were in him the way you in your earthly father he says even before there was a sun even before there was moon even before there was a molecule so in other words you were part of that logos that came out of the eternal fountain of life you were an attribute in him and when you are made manifest on the earth the prophet says that you and i want to read the quote he says you are sons and daughters of god for you are only the physical manifestation of the attributes that was in god at the beginning you now you standing here today are the physical manifestation of the attribute that was in god at the beginning so in other words i was in him when he stood on the invisible platform and he said let there be light and there was light so i was in him i was an attribute in him and when i come into my designated decreed season now i become a manifestation of that attribute that was in the father that was in him way before the foundation of the world even before there was a molecule even before there was a moon even before there was in what was was the sun why am i catch the revelation know who you are let's get lord in the praise amen he says you don't know nothing about it neither did you know when he was in your earthly father he says but you are manifested in his image in the image of god you are made and you were manifested for the glory and for the fellowship of god the very same way that you were manifested because your father earthly wanted to have fellowship with you he wanted to know you because you were an attribute in him and he says for that very same purpose he says you were manifested for the glory and for the fellowship of god it's beautiful he says and therefore as sure as your gene had to be in your father before your natural birth your spiritual gene had to be in god because you're an expression of the attribute of his thoughts before the foundation of the world no way around it that's right he says now we notice then that life being in you it's god's life being in you from the foundation of the world so what does that make you a living image of the living god let's give the lord a praise my my now we come to nicodemus saint john 3. he knew that jesus knew something about life the prophet says and he wanted to inquire and the scripture says that except a man is born again the prophet says born of water and of spirit you cannot see the kingdom of god and the scripture continues and says that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of spirit is spirit now he says nicodemus knew that he knew something about life he says he just didn't know that he himself was eternal life that's why the scripture says the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended is not he came to his own and his own received him not the prophet continues he says you know why because they were living in the glare of a previous age they were too invested in the washing of pots and pans and failed to see that god was manifested in the flesh now let's look at the natural and this is in why i'm against organized religion he says for you and i to have natural life the life that we now live he says for you to be become active in natural life it required a natural birth so in other words what did the natural birth do for you it puts you into five senses that's what the natural birth done for you so now you become active in this world now you can walk you can talk you can feel you can taste you can smell but that's all that the natural birth does for you and what that only makes you it only makes you a human being it only makes you a mortal man you are born to die now the prophet says that that first birth made me active and job turns around and he tells you but that man that is born of a woman is of a few days and he is full of trouble but the man that is born of christ is eternal then he says if that man that now that man that is born of christ is born from above now if you had to look at those two births which one would be more important to you why because the natural birth only made me active in this world but to be born from above will make me active in the things above now listen how the prophet puts it [Applause] he says now it is for himself to act in his word through you he says that's the reason why he said that i am the vine you are the branches in other words if you are born from above he can throw his own life into the branch why because the vine doesn't bear the fruit the branch is what bears the fruit so the branch bears the fruit by the life of the vine and that is makes you active in the things from above why because now you are born from above he says that's the reason jesus said if i do not the works of my father believe me not why because he came to fulfill the life of the father through that earth that body that was man created man now nicodemus was still confounded why because jesus said to him no man has ascended up to heaven but ye that came down from heaven he says he should have seen it in other words he was almost there he almost got the revelation but he just didn't get it he says why because he ought to have seen that that is god this isn't why i'm against organized religion but he failed to see it he was there he was almost there he says but he failed to see that that is god now in the message the seed is not here with the shaq we know at this age that we are living in that the word is to be born into a manifestation in the last days in other words we know that the message of the hour was the full restoration of the word and when the restoration of the word came it came with the restoration of the power now in seed is not here with the shock he says now notice but at the opening of the seven seals revelation 10 the full word is to be born into manifestation again and vindicated by the same spirit of god in the full strength as it was when he was here on earth [Music] it was to be manifested he says in the same way doing the same things then it would that it did when he was here on earth then the prophet says hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday to reign forever now the spirit that comes upon the promised word for this age it brings forth and it manifests not two tablets of stone the way he did in moses's age he says but it manifests the presence of the living god now what was that that was a manifestation of luke 17 30 why because god himself prophesied and he said in that day when the son of man is to be revealed again and that day is this day this is this age that we are living in now the prophet says that that was a manifestation of the son of man again in our midst so in other words the very same way that he manifested himself in the flesh of jesus christ he stepped behind another flesh of malachi 4 and he manifested the son of man then he needed the rising of the sun then ask yourself who opened the seals then what was the opening of the seals it was revealing christ why because that's the purpose that malachi 4 came for to reveal christ that was the reason for the opening of the seals why because he is those seals he's the one that opened those seals [Applause] christ is the seals that was opened to you and i thank you my my let's give the lord and the priest i love this quote in the guide also he says now at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of god should be finished at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of god is finished and when it's finished then he says in the guide then it we see it and we know who god is he says we know what he is we know how he lives we know his nature he says he is being and when all of that comes he says we are all the way up here to the top of the purim why because now he's formed us into the full statue of sons and daughters of god and all that is left is he comes down and he caps the pyramids of our lives why because that makes you then the living image of the living god on earth in this last day and age my my mind let's give the lord a praise amen i'm almost there i think we're going well [Applause] [Music] [Applause] spoken word is the original seed these last days the troop church pride comes to the headstone what will that make it will make a superchurch a super race as she nears the headstone they will be so much like him even they will be in his very image in order to unite her him with the bride they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the living god the prophet says your denomination will never be able to produce this your denomination will only produce creeds and dogmas but the revelation of jesus christ makes you into the image of god the father my my statue of a perfect man what christ was these people are because his life is in here he says they are in christ and their life is dead and hidden christ through god sealed in there by the holy ghost first corinthians 12 that's right he says you reckon yourself dead then you're born of faith then virtue and these other things is added to you tell you a perfect living image of god the prophet says that's wonderful and the congregation says amen that's how he forms you into the loving image of the living god my my mind and then god through that as brought also seven church ages to show the seven steps that he brought building his individual into his image he's built a complete church in his image and at the resurrection his complete body will be raised up to live with him forever why because it is a bride his presence in the individual with a personal vindication of himself expressing himself in the living word that's promised for the day expressing itself through you he says a vindication of the great revelation of god now he says now look it was only an individual and never in a group so so then we can turn around like the prophet said in invisible union oh that spiritual union of christ and his church he says when flesh is becoming word and word is becoming flesh why to be manifested and vindicated he says and we near the coming of jesus he says when he's united with his church he says when the word becomes the word why because she is him because she was taken from the bosom of the word that makes her word she is him now the prophet says we near the coming of jesus where he's united with his church my my my let's give the lord and the praise amen i just want to see where i'm at now in a message the messiah the prophet speaks about he says the word of god is a conductor he says in the word of god he's a conductor to use the power the dynamics and he sent his word as a gift to you and i in other words he sent the conductor that will be able to conduct the power that you will be sending now if you look at a conductor he says what is a conductor it's a substance in which an electrical charge is carried in other words conductivity in general is the capacity to transmit something such as electricity or heat so if the word is the conductor of the power then we need to get the word in us because when he sends the power he is sending it on his word in other words that's the reason why we're feeding on son of man's seed so that when he sends the promise of his father we'll be able to conduct that power free flow through you as the individual now the prophet says outside of that word being in you you are lost that's the reason why he said if he abide in me and my word abide in you then you will ask what you will why because you and the word have become the same you become one and he turns around in christ is the mystery he says and by that he has the preeminence in his bright body then like paul you become a prisoner he says and why because you are so yoked to christ [Applause] and then you would also be able to say like he said i do only that which pleases my father then you can say like saint john 5 19 i do only what the father shows me and that scripture continues and it says the father loveth the son and he share with him all things that himself doeth and he will show him greater works than these why because the word is in the bride and the mind of christ and she knows what he once done with the word now listen to this quote in the messiah he says a conduct is a wire that conducts and let a man with that same faith in the conductor of the word of god he says he can raise the dead [Music] he cleanses the lepers he casts out devils he says amen he's fashioned like a god why because he's in the image he's made in the image of his father then he says he looks like god sure was that's the reason god was man man was god and this is his offspring then he says man man is his offspring he says he's only trying to get a hold of man he's trying to get man into his hands that he might walk with that he may work through man to fulfill his purpose amen that's dominion yes now the message the messiah man is made up of 16 elements and we know that man is also made up of cosmic light the prophet in that message he says now if we can only get to a place where we can push the cosmic light to the side because your body is meant is cosmic light he says if we can only get to a place where we can push cosmic light to the side he says and get the eternal light to come in he says then you have god in a man [Applause] my he says then god can dwell supremely he says he can do our thinking then he can do our walking then he can do our talking why because it's no longer man but it's god in the man in other words it's no longer deity in heaven it's deity in you so all we want to get to is we want to just push the cosmic light of this earthly body just push it a little bit to the side so we can get that eternal light to come in and what do you have you have god in the man that's the image of the living god [Applause] my my [Applause] in messiah but the kingdom of god is established in the heart and the soul of a man by a revelation of jesus christ he says and to have that revelation he says you become a believer and you believe that these signs will follow them that believe then he says do you see what messiah is he says messiah is the kingdom of god what is that he says you you become an anointed one why because he was anointed with the fullness of god that made him the messiah now if you are anointed with that same spirit what does that make you a messiah why because you are anointed with that same spirit that that body was anointed with then he says any church that's anointed with that same holy spirit is a messiah a little smaller god and someday when this body is resurrected i hope beforehand that god can get a hold of a bunch of people that will manif manifest his power listen to what he says in every dimension that it's supposed to be in [Applause] in every dimension that it's supposed to be in now when he gave peter the keys he said to peter whatever you die on earth will be tied in heaven whatever you lose or bind whatever you lose i will lose it what did he do with william branham william branham you speak to the storm and when you speak on the earth heaven will agree and nature will obey that's what it is because it's a manifestation in all the dimensions that it's supposed to be in william branham what do you need you're looking for squirrels speak it heaven will agree and nature will obey my mind why because it's the messiah it's the anointed one that's in a bright body manifesting himself the way he manifested himself in that body two thousand years ago you speak heaven agrees nature obeys let's give the lord a praise my my my [Music] [Applause] amen [Music] [Applause] now in this last days we know that the son of man is to be revealed again then in a message christ is the mystery of god revealed the prophet says this now he says that's the reason when this man sitting here dropped dead the other day now in that message there's someone that was sitting in the audience that had dropped dead maybe a couple of days before the prophet says and and the prophet prayed for him and called him back to life now listen how he says it in that message he says that's the reason when this man sitting here dropped dead the other day and he's sitting here now he says prophet says we could say come back life now the prophet was able to identify in himself the very same way and he says how close was jesus and the father he says the father was the very spirit and the life in him now willem branham could identify himself when he said we he says why because the holy spirit said so but the holy spirit spoke through him when he said life come back and he says here's this man sitting here today and this is when he preached christ is the mystery of god revealed then the prophet says now it's not them people he says it's the headshot in the body that has become one why this was the worst first wave shift he was manifesting the oneness and he says it is god that is making himself manifest in his people he says it's the anointed body of christ for what purpose it's to prove and to manifest god in that like it did in that body now he's referring to the body of jesus christ then he says that body is what redeemed these bodies and by that redemption he can have the preeminence and he can work through you the very same way he could work through that body over 2000 years ago and he says for what purpose it's to bring them back to the kingdom is to bring fallen eve back to an even condition and that's his threefold purpose that's the mystery of god revealed my [Applause] now let's get to saint luke 24. saint luke 24 this is the day of the resurrection we come upon a scene and we look at two believers the one's name is cleopas the other one is let's pull this one yes the other and and so it's cleopas and his friend in a message when the eyes were opened these two were walking and he says their hearts was heavy they were sad they were despondent why because jesus of nazareth was crucified he had died and they laid his body in the tomb now they had a different impression of what he was to do why because he was to come and restore the kingdom of israel and in their despondent state walking on the road to emmaus from jerusalem jesus himself drew nigh and said to them why are you so sad why are you so despondent [Applause] they turn around to him and say but are you a stranger in jerusalem don't you know what had happened in these last couple of days and they tell him about jesus now their eyes were failed now the prophet says hey jesus wants to preach the mystery of himself to them on the road to ebayers and he says why because they loved him they were one of his followers and the prophet in why in their eyes open he says the very same way that many of us people today he says we love him so much but we don't recognize him we don't know that he's alive we worship him as a historical god he says we worship him in our creeds but he's alive you're walking on the road emails being despondent don't you know he's alive don't you know for this purpose he came into the world [Applause] [Music] and this is what he was preaching to them the scripture says that he opened up the scriptures to them and he preached all of the scriptures from moses from genesis up until their time to show himself in scripture and he says it was pertaining to himself and at the cool of the evening in other words when evening it said [Music] he made us if he was going to pass by now the best thing that they could have ever done in their lives was to invite jesus in other words abide with us because when they said abide with us they were going to see the manifestation of the resurrection why the prophet says because on the road he only preached the resurrection but in the evening time he was to manifest the resurrection [Music] how by the breaking of the bread by the opening of the word by manifesting the resurrection [Applause] and the scripture says jesus blessed the bread and when he had broken it their eyes went open and they knew him the eyes went open what was it it was the opening of the word and by the opening of the word their eyes went open and they knew him [Music] [Applause] this is jesus this is the same jesus that we knew a couple of days we know that he died all of heaven had declared that he was dead but he's alive [Music] [Applause] now if you listen to the account of luke 24 he disappeared after that that very same night it took them six hours to walk from jerusalem to emmaus and prophet says jesus preached the six hour sermon to them that very same night they were back ran back to jerusalem what to testify to the 11 in the house that indeed he is alive and he is risen from the dead they had a perfect revelation of who he was of who he is as they testifying to the eleven jesus himself appears in their midst and says to them peace be unto you some that were sitting there that night thought they seeing a ghost [Music] he said behold i'm not a ghost a ghost doesn't have flesh and blood i mean in other words flesh and bone that very same glorified body asked for something to eat showing god himself in other words that same body that was dead the dynamics power that came back into it made that body live again made it real but made it a glorified body that can disappear appear and disappear and still be able to eat they gave him a piece of broiled fish now again if you understand the mystery some of them that was sitting there had a perfect revelation of who jesus christ was peter is an example but there was some there that was elected seed but still needed to understand it still needed to catch the revelation now luke 24 45 that same chapter says and then jesus opened up their understanding to the scriptures in other words jesus christ in that glorified body preached to them again and opened up the scriptures to them why because they needed to catch the revelation understand this is god unfolding himself this is all of this jesus christ coming in the flesh dying he's going to be ascending back into heaven why because he's going to be sending the promise of my father but some of you still need to catch the revelation so he's going to open up the scripture to you so that you can catch the revelation of who he is why because in a couple of days from that i will be sending the promise of my father so terry in jerusalem until i send the power from on high and that was the purpose why he preached to them the revelation and opened up the scriptures to them my my we're almost there in when the eyes were opened they knew him everything that pertained to the christ he had vindicated it a virgin birth healing the sick discern the thoughts of the hearts everything that you are supposed to be be the messiah he vindicated it he says raised from the dead and they still didn't recognize it they still didn't know it after the scriptures had been revealed in other words he came to fulfill what was written of him now remember how beautiful that is the word that he was revealing to them you are showing them they had walked right with him for three years and recognized that and know that he fulfilled that word there they went walking on to the down to emails he says just didn't understand it they didn't get it and for that purpose now you can think of it so think of it jesus went to them those two that needed the revelation why because they were represented before the foundation of the world and he needed to open up himself the way he did to the lady at the well now the prophet says that and this is in when the eyes are open they knew him he says that lady knew the scriptures even in a state he says her eyes come open and she knew him and when she recognized him he said i am me [Music] so they just busted the revelation so he needed to just give them that quickening he says now those disciples after the resurrection they didn't know the scripture that's the reason why to open it up to them and the very same way that the pharisees of the day didn't know him that's why he said to them search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life for they are they that testify of me what i came to do what i am to do and fail to see it no he says peter's eyes was opened why because he was looking for him he says nathanael's eyes was opened because he was looking for you [Applause] and jesus could say to them i knew you before the foundation of the world now in that same message now listen what the prophet says now in the face of all of this and he's asking a question here in the face of all of this in this age that we're living in what has it done to your eyes [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so we ask ourselves the question in this age that we're living in in the face of all of this what has it done to our eyes if we recognize him have our eyes come open and we see him for who he is what he was doing in this great unfolding of himself [Music] now the prophet says you you're gonna you're gonna be either associated with the pharisees or you'll be associated with the apostles or the believers now what was the difference between those two groups of people the one was theo theology they knew him by the theology the others knew him by a revelation so this is where we want to identify yourself with to know him is life [Applause] and that's how we want to know him by a revelation of jesus christ the prophet says why because that is the new birth now ever in in a message evidence of the resurrection listen to this one if that isn't just exactly what he's done again in these last days at the setting of the sun you can see where i'm going the prophet says now did you notice what he did with the church throughout the day and he's typing this with the road to emails so at the evening time he manifests the resurrection but throughout the day he's preaching it he says throughout the day he was only preaching the word but evening time has come now we know the message of the hour is the evening time message why because there will be light in the evening time now over seven church ages all he was doing he was preaching the resurrection or the revelation so over two thousand years in seven church ages was the road to emmaus that's all it was only because he was only revealing parts of himself in the scripture in that scripture justification a little bit in that scripture from their sanctification we're still on the road to emails over the seven church ages restoration of the gifts but now we have invited him in and we said to him abide with us in the evening time and now because we said abide with us in the evening time message he's going to be breaking the bread he's going to be opening the word he's going to be manifesting the resurrection by revealing the son of man why because it's only the son of man that was the one preaching along the road it's only the son of man in the evening time that was revealing and breaking the bread only he could do it no one else in this end time he only used a different body to do it but it was the son of man in a son of man at the evening time manifesting the resurrection and what do we say in this day he's alive we know him our eyes have come open and we know that jesus christ is the same yesterday the same today and forever more that's the reason why the one that was in the midst of the candlesticks was the son of man [Applause] he is the alpha and omega it was god himself through seven church ages it's god himself at the end time in the evening time that showed himself alive to you and i and our eyes have gone open and like them didn't our hearts burn within us as he spoke to us along the way didn't our hearts burn within us as he unveiled himself to us by a message of the hour [Applause] it's a wonderful revelation my mama let's give the lord a praise christ is the mystery of god revealed malachi 4 was to bring back the faith of the fathers to the children that's right to bring that same thing the same pillar of fire in on the scene the same signs the same wonders the same jesus making him the same preaching him the same vindicating him the same yesterday today and forever now remember the holy ghost alone is the revealer of the divine revelation of christ and has been in all ages now the prophet says now who did the word of the lord then come to only the prophet so what was william branham's ministry it was a son of man revealing the son of man manifesting scripture vindicating malachi 4 5 vindicating luke 17 30 vindicating revelation 10 7. all it was was it was ace it was the son of man doing it through a son of man we're almost there serpent seed now god is healed from the eyes of the wise and the prudent and he promised to reveal it to the sons of the last day then he says which sons he says the same sons that rejoiced before the foundation of the world he says that's the reason that god is opening these things to us it is god bringing his sons into a manifestation now how is it doing this he says he goes beyond the limitations of any human understanding or any human knowledge he says he goes way into the spiritual revelation as he brings it to you this is in serpent seed then in christ is the mystery of god revealed now the prophet says now what is the new birth it is the revelation of jesus christ personally to you so that's the new birth he says it's christ in you and then prophet says that is the revelation that he builds his church upon he says it's god revealing to you this great mystery that and the prophet says that's the new birth in patmos vision placing the foundation upon the deity of the revelation it's god being revealed in christ now where is god to be revealed in he says his church with his people in us the same spirit the same works the same manifestation the same love he says the same forgiveness why because that's god's spirit being revealed in you in other words when he pours in himself it's his faith it's his virtue it's his knowledge and what does it be it bears his fruit what does it bear the same forgiveness the same long suffering the same gentleness the same patience he says peace mercy all that was in christ is in the church now the prophet says remember and keep this in mind all that god was he put into christ he was the fullness of the guarded bodily and all that christ was he poured into the church so what does that make the church the the mystery of christ revealed and so we see then this was god above us god was with us and now it's god in us am i give lord and a praise almost there we are muslim now at that day you will know when the revelation comes forth now the prophet says now this is greater greatest either seen you he that is in you he says if we could only realize what that scripture means he that is in you is greater than ye that is in the world he says we know it to be true he says but we just don't understand it then again he asks you know what is what is in you that's so much greater he says it's christ the anointed god that same anointed god that was in christ is in you [Applause] then if he then if if it is heated in you then it's no more you living it's christ in you the hope of glory he that is in you he says no wonder the winds and the waves obeyed him why because that was the very manifestation of god in flesh and when he spoke through that human lips it was god speaking he says no wonder the winds and the waves obeyed him then he turns around and he says no wonder the demons was paralyzed when he spoke why because it's only he that is above all principalities and powers and demons so they knew who was in the flesh of jesus christ because he's the one who spoke speaks no wonder he could still the wind and the waves why because that was the creator of all of heavens and earth because all of what we see and all of that that was created came about by his word so the creator spoke and said peace be still and nature had to obey why because the creator himself was speaking through that flesh or speaking through that mouth no wonder the dead that was turning back to the dust when he called his friend lazarus back from the dead now the prophet says that his nose had really fallen in in other words corruption had already set in so corruption knew its master and corruption had to reverse its process why because that was the god of the heavens and the earth that was speaking when he said lazarus come forth the dust that was turning back to dust became back again in human flesh why because the creator had spoken from those lips and again if that creator or that same spirit dwells in you it shall also quicken your mortal bodies it shall also speak through your lips it shall also raise the dead it shall also speak and heal the sick why because it's that very same spirit that was in jesus is dwelling in his bright body and demons will be paralyzed why because it's the same god that is speaking through your lips that's why will and bran could say when we sit life come back into the man because the holy spirit spoke through him and that's the reason why it could happen as he spoke and so now you see that scripture or rather that quote that the pastor loves to quote we will be the final voice to the final age and when she speaks it will flash like lightning why because what she speaks will create itself because the very anointing that same anointing is now in the body of believers and that's the second part of this threefold purpose of god preeminence he wants to live in his bright body and that ultimately is to take her back to an even condition my mama let's give the lord a praise i'm almost there the musicians can come up [Music] now there was something that that if we go back to cleopas and his friend even in the evening time when when when jesus had broken the bread the prophet says that they recognize the sign then he says that that he done was something that he'd done before his death and i was thinking i mean what did he do before that they could recognize that this is the same man if you think about it now in that message when the eyes went open they knew him the prophet says that he done something in front of them as a sign so that they might recognize him but he that thing that he done he done before his death now was a time that he was preaching to 5000 on the hill and after the sermon they wanted to feed all of this multitude of people and they found a little boy with a basket two fish five loaves of bread this is all we have to be able to feed this multitude of people now the cleopas and his friend must have been there they knew what happened that day why because that day and it's in in he that is in you also he broke the bread and as he broke the bread the prophet says even when he broke the fish he says another piece grew you may stand to your feet so that was the sign that they would recognize him by now i just want to see where that was i think i skipped it actually but in any case the prophet says that he he he performed a sign you can play something he performed the sign that he did before he was he was dead so if you think about it the only thing that could have happened is because remember now jesus if they could see his palm they might have seen the nail pierce when he had broken the bread that was how they recognized him and the prophet then turns around and he says now isn't this isn't he that is in you isn't that the same one that could take a piece of fish and break it and another piece grown then he says now he didn't actually have to have that he could have said it sure i'll just catch it just play play play with louder looks he says he didn't actually have to do that because he could have said it in other words he could have just spoken it and it would have multiplied itself but if you think about it you needed to do it in that way because the prophet says he's the same one that breaks the fish another piece grows he's the same one that breaks the bread another piece grows and they recognize that as the sign only the messiah could do that and so therefore at the breaking of the bread the opening of the word that's how they recognized him so why did he why did he keep that why did he do that it was so that he could reveal himself to cleopas and his friend at the cool of the evening in other words in that way he was manifesting the resurrection to them a message a prisoner if we could only keep that in our mind and according to the word of god that in these last days he's going to have a church he's going to have a people and these things that he promised is going to do them he said that he would and we're living in the time the prophet says we're there he's just trying to get us to be real prisoners to be locked in with him so that he could do that through us revelations 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel them when ye shall begin to sound the mystery of god is finished now as he closes out that message in christ is the mystery of god revealed now just look at the type because only in the evening time he revealed himself because all along the road it was just preaching the resurrection but at the evening time he was going to reveal himself now the prophet says you have to watch spiritual things then he says not knowing this but god knows it he tells the audience at that time when he was preaching crisis the mystery he says now if you'll turn and look at the clock it's on the dot two o'clock the end of the second pool the prophet says the third pool is at hand now what was the third pull it was the opening of the word it was the breaking of the bread and our eyes went open and we knew him we know who he is we have a perfect revelation you have a full understanding of who he is now all along the road it was god himself it was god through seven church ages it was god in that man that broke the bread it was gone in that man that was that that brought us the revelation of himself this is one of my best quotes i love this one anointed ones at the end time i wasn't the one that appeared down on that river i was only standing there when he appeared i'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect that they are i'm only one that's near when he does it the prophet showing to us clearly that he was only a son of man revealing the son of man i was only a voice that he used to say it i wasn't what it wasn't what i knew it's what i just surrendered myself to that he spoke through he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man let's give the lord a praise man [Applause] it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that god unfolded it's not a man it's god the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is christ he's the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man in his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man amen he says if you haven't fed fully on every word to give yourself strength to fly above all these denominations and things of the world then he says will you at this time do it while we pray let's bow it grace is eternal father the very same way that he prayed that day when he said o father lord of heavens and earth i thank you that you have hid this you've hid these things from the wise and the prudent and you have revealed it to babes such as would learn lord we want to thank you for your grace it's grace grace grace father god that you have chosen us in you before the foundation of the world and in

father god jesus that we are a part of that mystery we thank you lord that you have sent malachi 4 to take away the spiritual amnesia lord and to make us known to make it known to us that we are part
