Saints and Angel song blessed be the name of the Lord thank you for Anthony praise God praise God we thank God to be here tonight let us bow our heads for a prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for this great opportunity that we have to call upon your name and to seek your face I pray a word be spoken to your people that they may receive into their hearts that will change the course of their lives so many things are connected to decisions decisions in our minds decisions in our hearts an action based upon the decisions that we have in our hearts may it be an action to the people tonight that they would see their lives not just going through the motion but making intentional decisions as to how to act how to behave how to react how to call upon your name how to seek you your own disciples one time ask you teach us how to pray because they saw John disciples praying they saw John praying they saw Jesus praying and they wanted to know how it is that they could effectively pray how they could receive from you teach us tonight we need to hear from you we are waiting upon you granted Lord in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen God bless you and thanks for being here tonight we appreciate all of you who choose to have fellowship with us tonight around the word and we're going to share a few thoughts and then we're going to get on in prayer I want to read two portion of scripture one from Matthew chapter 6 I want to read 30-34 and Mark 1013 to15 Matthew 6 reading verse 30 wherefore if God so clothe the grass of the field this is Jesus which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you or ye have little faith therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat what shall we drink or where shall we be clothed for after all these things do the Gentile seek for heavenly father knoweth that he have need of these things but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for tomorrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the days the evil thereof Mark 10 want to read from verse 13 and they brought young children to him about Jesus that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them but when Jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of God verily I say unto you whosoever list is it here now shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child he shall not enter therein may God bless his word I have a question tonight what is it to seek first the kingdom of God you know we ask God for things we ask God for family for healing for breakthrough for deliverance but that is not exactly seeking the kingdom that is we are still asking for things and Jesus was telling the disciples that the Gentiles seek after things but he wants you to seek the first the kingdom and these other things will be added now the word first seek first gives the weight of what you have as a priority and the work to seek is to go after to go after to receive to go after to get seek diligently so it's not as if you are casual about it you are making an intentional effort to go after so this word first means that he's asking to realign your priorities it means adjusting your priorities what is first and foremost on your mind when you wake up when you go to sleep is it the kingdom is it the holy ghost or is it things is it people first means prioritizing God's will and his purpose above everything else in your life making God's desires and plans Central in our lives letting his principles and word guide our choices and actions because you have to really believe that life is not just natural going to work going to home going to church driving a car and whatnot but life is also spiritual in a truest sense we want to be able to be living seeking for the kingdom according to God's standard according to God's character according to God's word growth in your life you must be able to see growth in your life not a stagnant broken system but an Ever vescent spring of water what this is doing by Jesus telling people don't take on these things don't take on what morold and take on this and take on clothes and food you know like they have the basic thing what you need is shelter food and clothing he said don't let that bother you and stress you out then but you have to put trust and you have to see by putting the kingdom first that you are trusting in his word that he will take care of you so De Jesus he is trying to get the people away from being anxious about Earthly things or Earthly concerns being anxious or anxiety is a reflection of a lack of trust so you have to do you have to you know you're all tense up you're all tight because you're anxious will it work out will not work out this trust listen carefully this trust that Jesus wants from us is what is reflected in a child children trust easily and fully without questions and wondering if you tell a child I'm going to bring a chocolate to you this evening that child have no doubt that that chocolate coming and when you reach by the door by the gate he's looking out or she's looking out for that chocolate so they have an natural instinct or belief that the parents or the Guardians whoever taking care of them will protect and provide for them that's why Jesus said consider the lies consider the bird of the field did he not spin or toil and yet God provides for them because he is in charge of them so Jesus is calling us to trust trust him completely and he said it this way therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or where it all shall we be clothed you are Believing on his goodness you are Believing on his love you are Believing on his promises even when you don't even understand what is happening you are believing listen what B said here message is is it I you said many times I wonder sometimes how so many things happen it is just simple prayer I come up I pray for someone maybe dimes sakas cancer or something just eaten up and after a while along the road you remember me brother Brandon I was the one that was so and so tens of thousands R around you see listen it is just simple fi it is nothing anything that we work ourselves up to is just something that we believe like a child would believe just like you promis your little girl a New Dress Saturday the little boy a overall jacket see they expect that just simply childlike fate that's all God wants us to be because we are just his children in any my title tonight is receive as a child the kingdom of God so he is saying here just as you promise your little girl a new dress you promise your boy a jacket and they just expect that that is simple childlike faith that we could pray Lord touch my brother heal him in Jesus name touch him take away this in Jesus name and you just believe that and you walk away simple childlike fate so Jesus was trying to tell the disciples we have got to get our prorities right you cannot put listen material things over spiritual things so Jesus was saying don't worry about material things don't worry about the food and the drink and the clothing seek first the kingdom have a spiritual Pursuit have one that you're actually seeking spiritual things it's about valuing things that are Eternal instead of what is temporary status wealth now status and wealth bring peace and comfort from the anxiety about material concerns because if you had money you went studying what house to buy or what car to buy or or if you have paid doctor bills or whatever it is you just have the money you just do what you have to do you go where you have to go so it's a it's a it's a weight off from the material but in God stretching it out in this way where he could say take no thought he is encouraging us to trust him he's encouraging us to surrender and this is what a child does and listen to this we have to understand that seeking first the kingdom of God involves surrendering our own desire our own ways and trusting in his sovereignity now man I see they love control we like to control things I'm not talking about male man I'm talking about man which is woman and man male female control their parents that want to control their children their mothers they are in charge of their children they figure they have control that is a problem in seeking first what God's want from you so therefore we have to trust that God in his sovereignity he would work things out well like you know often talk about Romans 8:28 and we know all things work together for good right then I'm not love God what we are actually seeing I'm yielding my fears I am yielding my plans I am yielding my ambitions to you to you God and you are seeing that knowing that he knows the end from the beginning and he is smarter than us he's wiser than us and I could trust in his decision and guiding me he would lead me right now the challenge is whether or not we would rock back and say well God will work it out and we do nothing that is not what he is saying here because we want to be able to have I call it the action of faith in seeking God you're not just waiting upon the Lord and doing nothing but you are making those steps of action in obedience in taking courage like how God Joshua be courageous in making sacrifices to show God your responding to his voice and his call there are too many Christian just sit back it's almost like they they in relaxed mode and they're not doing anything to draw nigh to God he said draw nigh to me I'll Draw N to you resist the devil and he would flee from you there's an effort and there's an intent in doing these things question tonight where are your steps where are those action that you know you should take the big issue for some of you is pride and was sham my wife tonight I can never saw it that way before called pride in this way Pride I wrote down these things keep you independent you ask no questions you ask no guidance you are not interested in God's thoughts on the matter because you are more interested in what you think what you want what you desire you have pummeled and bulli your way true life your own way which is actually selfish you don't ask because you don't want to admit that you don't know and to me it's Pride so you pretend and guess what you still don't know you are not humble it's a lack of humility and this is what a child has humility except you be as a little child I know this may sound light tonight but this is not light this is not light listen carefully children recognize their dependence on others particularly on adults and Jesus he said accept you be like a child don't stop the children let them come because the the kingdom works with that kind of spirit that kind of attitude the children are dependent the children as a child they don't exercise that independent and we have to be able to show God our dependency on him now if you're dependent of God you just can't walk out the house without prayer with you know acknowledging him and giving some worship because you are dependent on him no man could live without God when I saying that live the life normal make money normal go to work have this and whatever it is and there's not even a God in the taught he just living a normal life but we're not speaking about that we spoken speaking about what God expecting of us seeking the kingdom involves transforming your views that you could begin to see things to a spiritual lend instead of seeing natural somebody do you somebody affect you you don't like this one and if this one could you move off of the scene and you invest in natural you fighting against flesh and blood cousin and aunt and uncle and you need Flesh and Blood more you're not seeing through the spiritual lens to the eyes of the Lord godam said this all right very good talk about Jesus he was just one man the perfect man the Cal he gave his life and he made an example for you what must we do the first thing I want to say is Jesus never live for himself listen to these words I want you to forget everything else listen to this here Jesus never live for himself there's not a text there's not talking Mysteries and all that his life was spent for others that is perfect eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that is fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't eternal life and this is what I see now people are living in a bubble they in church but they in their own bubble they in their own world they're shaking hands through that bubble God bless you through that bubble but in a bubble God want to pun you with a little pin you a bubble PS and punch you that bubble that you could recognize you have to be connected you have to be relating you have to be uh connecting to your brothers and sisters and so like that now he says but when you live your life to yourself you haven't eternal life so eternal life is connected with living for others going Beyond yourself and that is where you are motivated to do much more because you're not serving you selfishness narcissism and you thinking about you and your what your interest is that is self-centered It could only go so far and no more as we see God's kingdom we are called to press on to a life of Holiness striving to become more like Jesus and this process is what we call sanctification this is the hard part this is the legalistic part this is the part where you fast you pray you die out you bring your flesh in subjection you put your feelings aside and let the word come forward because you are choosing this is what it it means confessing your sins and turning away from Habits that are hindering you confessing your sins because if you don't confess your sins the devil have stuff on you yeah stuff he could say no look he's this way she's this way he did that he did that and there's no confession so you have you have something on you then but when you confess and you repent to God because this is what God wants you acknowledge your ways acknowledge your bad behavior or attitude and say Lord I need you God could come and Minister and restore you forgive you and help you so let me hit the home shet here now children see the world simply with no complications no bias that ad dos have their hearts and motives are pure they approach people with no pretense No Agenda that is what a child had no hidden you ask that child a question the child answer you ask a Dos are question oh my God got to watch the carefully because they don't want to say this because this hidden here and they hiding something here and they don't you know this not a child a child will come and say daddy and mommy was doing this or this happened and happen and the child freely saying whatever it the child is opening to learn from those around them the child and Jesus want us to be like that to be shaped in a way where he could speak to us anything and we could receive it children forgive quickly this the part I just love no ODS no grudge when we have grandchildren some you know give them a little jle and whatnot cry but they come right back the mother might put a licks father might rough them or whatnot they might cry in a corner but they come right back why they cannot hold Arts they don't know what Arts is they get upset they cry and whatnot and like that but they come right back to mommy or daddy or right back to Grandpa and Grandma this is our children they hold no grudges except for be like a child they are willing to reconcile and let go of offenses this is what God wants of us loving others freely children find joy in simple things free from worries you buy a little car you buy a big car they happy drive it up and down like I those grand boys and whatever you buy a balloon they will blow it whatever whatever and they happy they get something new it might it might not last the whole day but they enjoy it while they can they not weigh down they have Joy they have joy children are unafraid to admit that they need help and how and they honor they're not afraid to share how they're vulnerable I fell I fell and they crying the knee hurting and what not they say where you get hurt and the elbow and they bring the elbow and show the elbow and the more you do it the more they cry and they say okay I'll fix fix it give it a kiss and and the tears is gone you know Grandpa could fix fix and so on like that children are also quick to learn and they're eager to absorb more knowledge more information that questions the eager to ask questions and to learn children display great generosity in giving in Sharing I just run too quickly children don't hold biases and judgment towards others they accept people as they are children they love connections a c here a friend here a Believer here whatever it is they would laugh Run play That's How children are and the last thing I have here children are transparent expressing their feelings is a term that Isaac uses a remember now that the children they might be blunt but they are honest they are truthful and we may call it plain Jan they will tell it like it is God help us to be like that they don't need to hide they don't need to pretend they are honest they are authentic they are original they are their true selves and this is what God wants of us tonight to receive the kingdom in all honesty and simplicity Jacob said I am Jacob you know good I'm I'm a trickster you have to be open and honest I'm a liar my tee I luster I whatever it is that you could tell God and God come tonight forgive me and cleanse me and Purge me and Purify Me I want to tell you about I am I want to you see God knows about you but you have to confess it to him that's the law that he put in forgiveness if you shall confess your sins he is faithful and just to forgive you of your sins not if you think about your sins in your mind and and it in your mind no his words say if you confess he is faithful and just to forgive you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness just a few more and we're close just a two more if you can believe on the Lord Jesus Christ not only for salvation for yourself or for your loved ones or for the healing of a child or a mother or anything that you desire that's right if you know if you desire something that wasn't right listen if you desire something that wasn't right you wouldn't have Fai enough to ask God in the first place because you know it ain't right if you are sincere and know that it is right then you can ask God with a clean heart knowing it's no selfish motive your objective and your motive is exactly right then ask God like a child believe you'll get it and you get it now we are going to start off with the early church and that just brings it about five minutes now what they did the great vision I have for the future now at the beginning the church was inaugurated at Pentecost and there the Holy Spirit fell upon them where Jesus had chosen 12 and one of them had fallen they had to choose Maas to take his place and the Holy Spirit listen waited until all this was in order before it come they had to choose one to take the Bishop Rick of Judas that fell by transgression to fulfill the scripture and I'm closing this last quote and I believe all these things have a time of lingering listen and sometimes you ask ask God for something you're seeking God and God lingers he says nothing but you have to wait all these things have a time of lingering waiting and it's waiting for a time for the scripture to be fulfilled till everything gets right everything is in order many times we get impatient like a child we get great anticipation and many time we jump ahead and that hinders the work until the works get caught up we must must move reverently of a purpose in heart that God listen if he would desire to use us in such and such but wait till he makes the opening because he has to go ahead of us if you don't wait for God to make an opening and for God to show the way you will crash you would end up in a in it's in a pickle you will end up in difficulties because you haven't let go enough to say you know Lord You're we sometime in releasing things to God it may seem very hard but it's God's will it is God's plan it is God's sovereignity and if you accept that brother Bram was working hard when they had the flood and the boat and his wife got sick and he helping to get this one and helping that one and that one and that one but then he was actually under Disobedience he did not obey what God has said and it brought a reaction to his own family that brought the effect his wife died his child died it was a serious test of faith for him but he didn't obey God the way God wanted him to obey and friends we get test we get test on obedience we get test if you really believe the word we get test and God is seeing our reaction to this this was very notable to me because it challenge this attitude that we are okay when we are not it challenges it that we pretend and we are not and here is the word tell us get down to be like a child in other words I trust tonight that you could begin to see something what a child sees especially with no ODS no grudge especially with authenticity freedom to speak not uh um you know on your had to think hard because you had to be careful how your words span out no no no no no like I tell a brother one time I say everything that I speak to you you could speak to anybody I'm not a whispering Pastor I don't whisper say sh don't tell anybody as it's you talking to you by yourself nothing to that I want to be able to speak from my heart and to speak truth and be what is right and if I could speak speak what is right to you then I could speak to right to God if you cannot be honest with your fellow man how could you be genuinely sincere to God something is wrong and let me tell you something I sh is my son Gideon and I said I'll close with this know I'll spend a little more time tonight I said like in the realm of the spirit if in your spirit have say pure colors and something is wrong consider and picture if the color is Muddy so you get a muddy red or a muddy yellow or muddy whatever just talking about in the real of the spirit and that is what is vibrating out of you in the realm of the spirit that is what is emanating from you a negative a muddy not correctly colored how you're supposed to be and regardless how nice your words are spoken it cannot change what you are giving out so when you have the colors right you have the right motive and objective every devil in hell could see what is vibrating off of you and this is what brother Bram could Des when the man came up on the platform he could say you not here for healing you're a minister you're here for Revival you are Christian what is it that brother brandham is seeing them to say you are Christian he's not living by them he's not going by home by them it is something that is vibrating out of that person that tells that is a Christian friends this is what I have to share for you tonight that I want to quote it back receive as a child the kingdom of God let's bow our heads heavenly father I thank you tonight these are the words that I felt I wanted to share with your people tonight and I pray it goes down in every heart may they see how the children are dependent that's a problem with adults they act so independent they don't seek counsel they don't seek advice they don't see the leading of the Lord they do what they want to do I went in Crash pray prayer requests pray for me and whatnot but they don't have to go through that Lord Lord as that song Right said what what what what so much peace we forfeit so much pain we Bear all because we do not carry Everything To God In Prayer may it be corrected tonight as we humble ourselves get off the pride horse and just simply wait on you call upon you seek and ask you and if they are mothers fathers brothers sisters husband and wives here with pride in their hearts may they repent tonight ask you God to take it out of their hearts and their lives because your word say you resist the proud you fight the proud they could call Christianity and they are in church and they Christians but if they are proud you resist them you push them back you come against them but you give grace to the humble God every humble heart here tonight that heard these words may you give them a extra blessing tonight as they call upon you in prayer in Jesus name I ask it amen and amen I trust in that these few words would have been edifying to you and helpful to you may God bless you and big down in prayer in Jesus name amen God be with you and B down in pray prayer raise the Lord [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
