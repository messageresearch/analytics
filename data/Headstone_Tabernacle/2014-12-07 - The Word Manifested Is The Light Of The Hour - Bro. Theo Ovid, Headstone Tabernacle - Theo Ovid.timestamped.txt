[6:28] 21
[6:33] verse 32 says verily ver verily I say
[6:36] unto you this generation shall not pass
[6:39] away till all be
[6:42] fulfilled

[6:54] and drunkenness and cares of this life
[6:57] and so that they come upon you una awes
[7:00] for as a snare shall it come on all them
[7:05] that dwell on the face of the whole
[7:06] earth watch ye therefore and pray always
[7:10] that you may be accounted worthy to
[7:13] escape all these things that shall come
[7:16] to pass and to stand before the son of
[7:19] man oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[7:23] Praise His holy name and let's go to
[7:25] Isaiah chapter 60 praise be to Jesus
[7:53] arise and shine for the light is come
[7:55] and the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[7:57] thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover
[7:59] the Earth and gross Darkness to people

[8:05] His glory shall be seen upon the may God
[8:07] the bless the read of his word you may
[8:09] be seated oh praise the name of the Lord
[8:12] blessed be the name of the Lord praise
[8:15] God what a time this morning in the word
[8:18] and what a contrast of that Good
[8:20] Shepherd from Ezekiel 34 where God says
[8:23] son of man prophesy against the
[8:25] Shepherds of Israel prophesy and say
[8:27] unto them thus say the Lord God unto the
[8:29] she Shepherds W be to the Shepherds of
[8:31] Israel that feed themselves should not
[8:34] the Shepherds feed the flock he eat the
[8:37] fat he clothe you with the wool you kill
[8:40] them that are fed but you feed not the
[8:42] flock the disease have you not
[8:44] strengthened neither have you healed
[8:46] that which was sick neither have you
[8:48] bounded up that which was broken neither
[8:50] have you brought again that which was
[8:52] driven away neither have you sought that
[8:54] which was lost but with force and with
[8:57] cruelty have you ruled them
[8:59] and they were scattered because there is
[9:01] no Shepherd and they became meat to all
[9:04] the beasts of the field when they were
[9:06] scattered my sheep wandered through all
[9:08] the mountains upon every High Hill yeah
[9:11] my flock was scattered upon all the
[9:12] Earth and none did search or seek after
[9:15] them therefore ye Shepherds hear the
[9:18] word of the Lord as I live sayth the
[9:20] Lord God surely because my flock became
[9:22] a prey my flock you see what God keep
[9:24] say my flock my flock my flock this is
[9:27] not meant churches the people don't
[9:28] belong to men it's my flock is my people
[9:32] the my people that's called by my name
[9:34] praise God Hal in the last days true
[9:37] Shepherds will be a hidden Mystery and
[9:39] brother preach a message called why it
[9:41] had to be Shepherds and reveal a hidden
[9:43] Mystery that God going to have true
[9:44] shepherds in the last day BTO the false
[9:47] Shepherds Hallelujah so what the
[9:50] shepherd supposed to do is to heal the
[9:52] brokenhearted to restore those that are
[9:54] lost to go after them in other words
[9:57] they're supposed to have a heart of a
[9:58] shepherd a true Shepherd that would lay
[10:01] down his life for the sheep and stand
[10:03] for what is right and stand for what is
[10:06] true and stand for what is righteous
[10:08] that is the kind of heart that God going
[10:10] to put in the last days oh hallelujah
[10:13] hallelujah glory to God him in listen to
[10:17] this as I liveed say the Lord God surely
[10:20] because my flock became a prey and my
[10:22] flock became meet to every beast of the
[10:24] field because there was no Shepherd
[10:26] neither did my shepherd search on my
[10:27] flock but the Shepherds fed themselves
[10:30] and fed not my flock therefore oh
[10:32] Shepherds hear the word of the Lord th
[10:34] say the Lord God behold I am against the
[10:36] Shepherds I will require my flock at
[10:39] their hand and cause them to cease from
[10:41] fending the flock neither shall the
[10:43] Shepherds feed themselves anymore but I
[10:45] will deliver them from their mouth for
[10:48] thus say the Lord I even I will both
[10:51] search my sheep and seek them out God
[10:54] promised the Lord himself to descend
[10:57] from heaven with a shout to come and
[10:59] seek his own sheep out so you don't
[11:02] belong to no man you don't belong to no
[11:05] system you belong to the Lord God

[18:16] a big one in small
[18:18] form I'll say it again a little Eagle is

[18:27] who he is if you got to know who you are
[18:29] if you got to know your potential you
[18:31] will see why the devil is fighting you
[18:33] toot and nail every single day of your
[18:37] life because he knows that if you come
[18:41] into an understanding and a revelation

[25:57] rapturing faith that will take the
[25:59] church into Glory you heard what he says
[26:03] the baptism of the spirit the baptism of
[26:05] the Holy Ghost that's the thing to bring
[26:08] Faith into the people and seven Thunders
[26:11] gives Faith so seven Thunders is the
[26:14] holy
[26:18] spirit I'm not hearing you I'm not
[26:21] hearing you then the same seven Thunders
[26:24] that caps the pyramid that's the thing
[26:27] to bring the faith
[26:33] so the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the
[26:35] thing to bring the faith into the people
[26:36] therefore the seven Thunders must be the
[26:38] holy spirit because the seven Thunders
[26:40] get Faith and the Holy Spirit gains
[26:42] Faith so therefore the tunders is the
[26:45] Dynamics in banic form in word form
[26:48] super sign that when light struck
[26:51] Rebecca she knew something within her
[26:53] that brought her to Isaac she veiled her
[26:55] face she wanted no more to do with her
[26:57] own thinking Isaac was the thinking from
[26:59] then on and the church itself here we go
[27:02] when it strikes the power of God the
[27:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost out of the
[27:06] international churches out of the
[27:08] Catholic Church wherever it is when the
[27:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost is made real
[27:13] to the
[27:15] people them that's predestinated like
[27:17] you people here to life sees it and
[27:19] walks in it what's it a super sign
[27:21] that's right and you possess the gates
[27:23] of the enemy so the baptism of the Holy
[27:25] Ghost has to be made real to the people
[27:29] rising of the sun he came to redeem or
[27:31] to bring to life those predestinate seed
[27:33] of God that he seen before the
[27:35] foundation of the world and put their
[27:37] names in The Book of Life so he put
[27:38] their names in The Book of Life he come
[27:40] down on the earth and looking for those
[27:41] seeds he's a great Shepherd looking for
[27:43] the seeds looking for sheep he had sheep
[27:45] in Trinidad so the great Shepherd had to
[27:48] bring the seven Thunders from under the
[27:50] seven seal and throw it over this island
[27:53] to see them seven tunders pick up the
[27:55] seed because the seven tund going to
[27:56] gather the bright together seven thund
[27:58] to give the bride fith seven thund going
[28:00] to UT the voices of that group The Seven
[28:02] Thunder going to show how to prepare
[28:04] those seven Thunders had to be loose
[28:06] seven perfect Spirits across the whole
[28:09] earth to get every predestinate seed
[28:11] it's the great Shepherd it's the great
[28:14] holy spirit it's the great Elohim moving
[28:17] brooding like it was in the Garden of
[28:19] Eden when cross Darkness cover the earth
[28:22] and the spirit of God move upon the face
[28:24] of the water and God said let there be
[28:27] light oh come on now come on now God
[28:31] said let there be light it was dark
[28:38] Hallelujah I want you to notice the
[28:41] darkness didn't intimidate God God
[28:43] didn't hide his PR but it's so dark I
[28:45] can't see anything that God they was
[28:47] intimidated by the darkness and Isaiah
[28:50] Isaiah said cross Darkness cover the
[28:52] Earth cross Darkness covered the people
[28:54] but the light going to come the light
[28:56] going to shine when God saw the darkness
[28:59] the Bible said Darkness was upon the
[29:01] face of the deep but the spirit of God
[29:04] move upon the face of the waters the
[29:06] spirit of God and the waters which thou
[29:09] sest at the multitude of the people the
[29:12] spirit of God begin to move upon the
[29:14] waters and when the spirit begin to move
[29:17] upon you you're going to hear the voice
[29:19] of God that's why you got to get in the
[29:21] spirit that's why you got to worship
[29:24] that's why you got to honor his name
[29:26] that's why you got to press your way you
[29:28] can't just watch and stare you got to
[29:30] watch and
[29:31] [Applause]
[29:36] praise listen to brother Bram he not
[29:39] only come to be a blessing but to share
[29:42] the blessing with every predestinated
[29:45] seed oh Hallelujah now the mystery was
[29:49] the seed was always in the
[29:54] earth you hear what I said in Genesis
[29:58] the seed was already there that was a
[30:00] hidden Mystery Darkness was covering it
[30:02] and once Darkness covered the seed it
[30:04] can come to life it make light to bring
[30:08] it into a manifestation so the word
[30:10] manifested brings light to bring forth
[30:13] the seed as long as darkness is covering
[30:16] the seed they can't produce anything but
[30:19] when God roll back the darkness when God
[30:23] rolled back the darkness when God rolled
[30:26] back the darkness you're going to hear
[30:28] Let there be
[30:30] [Applause]
[30:35] light and that light going to strike
[30:38] that seed inside of you oh
[30:41] Hallelujah listen to this Jesus he was
[30:44] God's first corner of wheat that have
[30:46] been raised from the dead Hallelujah the
[30:48] first corner of Wheat by God's
[30:50] quickening power God has Quicken his

[30:58] the first sample the first taste of
[31:01] others that could to raise he was the
[31:04] first fruits of them that slept and
[31:06] that's why they had to wave that Chief
[31:09] because it was the first one that come
[31:11] to maturity it was waved as a memorial
[31:15] of Thanksgiving to God believing that
[31:17] the rest of them would come so in the
[31:19] Old Testament when you plant your crop
[31:21] and you get the first Chief come to

[31:50] power all the going get power oh the
[31:53] first one come to maturity was waved
[31:59] [Applause]
[32:02] how many see the power of
[32:06] love God waving see that's why oh this
[32:10] is good that's why Jesus had no fight to
[32:12] tell the disciples what they need to
[32:13] know and what they not prepared to
[32:15] handle as yet he watched them and said
[32:18] the same works I do shall you do also
[32:19] and these guys have all kind of spirits

[48:06] Jesus was the first fruit of them that
[48:08] slept praise God he was waved over the
[48:10] promis SE that have life and watch he
[48:13] was waved on the day of Pentecost and
[48:15] there came a song from heaven so the son
[48:17] of man came and then the Spirit came
[48:20] Hallelujah and wave over them and each
[48:22] one got their Pillar of Fire they wasn't
[48:25] just in the atmosphere the tongues of
[48:27] fire settled upon each one of them so
[48:30] each one of them had their Kingdom had
[48:32] their fire had their portion had God
[48:36] failed and that is what is Promised
[48:39] pillow fire back in the church who is
[48:42] the church you are the church tell her
[48:44] fire back in you and when you have fire
[48:46] and he has fire and she has fire and I
[48:49] have fire and that fire come together
[48:52] that's the pillar of fire that's the
[48:54] bride prise God
[48:57] goise so says and it be wave again we
[49:01] realize to Luke 17:30 Hallelujah in the
[49:03] Sunday again the son man will be
[49:05] revealed now watch who is the son of man
[49:07] in the beginning was the word the word
[49:09] was but God and the Word was God and the
[49:11] Word was made flesh and dwell Among Us
[49:13] am watch and that word again is wave
[49:16] over the people here we go that the Dead
[49:19] traditions of man is dead and the Son of
[49:21] God is alive again with the baptism of
[49:24] the Holy Spirit right Among Us and is
[49:26] giving us life so I'm showing you right
[49:29] true and true praise God that the
[49:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost is what is
[49:33] Promised judgment was Fallen all over
[49:36] Egypt and if you notice now ministers
[49:38] you may disagree with me on this but
[49:39] before the Judgment started hit in Egypt
[49:41] God sent Israel to Goan they were in
[49:44] Goan no plague fell on them a perfect
[49:47] type of the church carried over through
[49:48] the tribulation and The Last Enemy the
[49:52] last plague that struck the Earth was
[49:55] death now this is something we may
[49:57] Overlook listen to these words and The
[49:59] Last Enemy that going to strike the
[50:01] church is
[50:03] death spiritually speaking those who
[50:07] will not follow Christ in the baptism of
[50:10] the Holy Spirit Will spiritually dry up
[50:13] and die Hallelujah and that is why I am
[50:17] against any teaching any doctrine that
[50:20] quench the desire for the holy ghost in
[50:23] the
[50:23] people any Doctrine Any teacher that
[50:27] quench the desire for the Holy Ghost and
[50:29] the people is
[50:31] Antichrist it is false it is demonic
[50:35] that's right because any church that
[50:37] don't follow you with the Holy Ghost
[50:39] will spiritually
[50:41] die
[50:42] hallelujah hallelujah why you say that
[50:46] because Isaiah prophesied that God
[50:48] Darkness cover the Earth God Darkness
[50:51] covered the people Darkness taken over
[50:53] homes Darkness taken over ministers
[50:56] Darkness taken over churches take
[50:59] Darkness they are blind leaders of the
[51:01] blind they are not seeing they can't
[51:04] lead the people because the light is not
[51:07] there when you turn down the word you
[51:10] walk into darkness oh Hallelujah but
[51:14] arise and shine thy light is come and
[51:18] the glory shall be seen upon
[51:24] you Isaiah didn't talk no hidden in you
[51:28] the glory going to be seen they're going
[51:30] to seen see your glory your cup going to
[51:33] run over go your table in the Pres of
[51:35] your enemies you didn't know you had
[51:37] enemies right of course you have enemies
[51:39] you think you think you're nice you
[51:41] don't do nothing wrong you know enemy is
[51:44] that right then you don't belong to God
[51:46] you belong to the enemy if you know
[51:48] enemies but once you are Son of God
[51:50] every devil in hell is against you the
[51:54] devil going drop on your son on your
[51:56] husband on your wife on your uncle on
[51:58] your aunt on your neighbor on the boss
[52:01] on whoever God ever will jump on them
[52:03] try to mess you and tie you up
[52:06] Hallelujah that's the devil job he come
[52:08] to steal to Rob and to destroy he's a
[52:15] thug he's a highway
[52:20] robber my God you have your joy devil
[52:23] come and hold you up steal your joy
[52:25] Jesus frustr you let some accident
[52:28] happen in your home this happen you're
[52:29] breaking up you're broken up you're in
[52:31] tears and he say good good good that is
[52:33] where I want you when you're messed up
[52:35] like that you're in your human Spirit
[52:37] but Jesus and brother Bram seem to have
[52:39] the mind of Christ for every
[52:41] situation so nobody could throw them off
[52:44] because they're dealing with the
[52:45] intelligence you see I caught something
[52:47] when Samuel went to anoint David when
[52:50] Samuel went to anoint David he didn't
[52:53] know was David God says one of the sons
[52:56] of Jesse that's how God does think God
[52:58] can to tell him David is the man thank
[53:00] you just go down there and pour the all
[53:01] in him God but how you look praise God
[53:06] Amen Hallelujah God like how things is
[53:09] looking how you look he just just PA and
[53:12] David my God tell us my Jesus on the
[53:16] contrary he didn't want to go at all
[53:17] because he say sa here that so will kill
[53:19] him God tell him listen just tell them
[53:22] to come to prepare a feast and invite
[53:24] the house of Jesse M so go around the
[53:28] whole thing just just make a spin around
[53:31] so when the first man come when them ad
[53:34] or whatever his name is man he's put his
[53:36] put cologne on forget it he check the
[53:38] mirror and fix his tie say good Lord the
[53:41] anointing coming put his tie and he walk
[53:44] out there with a little buns and Sam
[53:47] himself saying this had to be
[53:49] he so is a Harmony going on there he
[53:53] feeling like he and Samuel think is he
[53:56] but when the intelligence dropped down
[53:58] God said no that's not him because God
[54:01] doesn't see as man
[54:05] see God now this is the problem because
[54:09] man sees a certain way that's right
[54:11] that's right so he was teaching the
[54:13] prophet Samuel you have to have a
[54:15] discernment don't go by out with the
[54:17] parents and how the cologne smelling and
[54:19] how his tie is well fixed matching his
[54:21] shoes and matching his socks don't go by
[54:23] that but go by the inward part of the
[54:25] heart you got to be in the spirit to
[54:27] discern that so when when when Samuel
[54:30] caught it he said I check them out now
[54:31] on the inner man not him not him not him
[54:34] keep on walking praise God keep on
[54:36] walking next Hallelujah next Hallelujah

[58:39] hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus so
[58:42] then you're not depending upon some
[58:43] Pastor or some elder or some Deacon you
[58:47] understand by Revelation that he didn't
[58:49] come to be a blessing he come to share
[58:51] the blessing you understand by
[58:53] Revelation when the lamb took the book
[58:56] didn't take it for himself he wasn't
[58:57] feeling bookish he wasn't feeling to
[58:59] hold a book he like book he like to read
[59:01] books it wasn't about that it had names
[59:04] in the book he wanted to release those
[59:06] names those names were in captivity
[59:09] those people didn't know who they were
[59:11] he had us to release who you are and you
[59:14] are the word you are the germ you are to
[59:18] be released from the thoughts of God by
[59:21] the word of
[59:25] God
[59:28] my I don't know Hallelujah I want to
[59:31] finish off listen to this a word had to
[59:33] be created thank you Lord a thought
[59:36] Hallelujah is in the mind of God hallu a
[59:38] word had to create it God said let there
[59:40] be light was a word seed and that word
[59:43] could have remain a thousand years but
[59:45] all of a sudden that word have life in
[59:48] itself all of a sudden that word
[59:51] manifest itself and the word produce
[59:54] light that's the word being Vindicated
[59:57] that's the word being manifested the
[59:59] word have to be Vindicated in order to
[1:00:01] be light people can say what they want
[1:00:03] but when the light is made manifest when
[1:00:06] the word is made manifest that is the
[1:00:13] light say it again brother the word
[1:00:16] itself is not the light the word
[1:00:19] manifested that is the light so when God
[1:00:22] speak a word to you that's a word to you
[1:00:25] but when that word is
[1:00:28] [Applause]
[1:00:30] manifested that's the light that's the
[1:00:33] light oh hallelujah oh glory to God
[1:00:38] watch God provided a place called Goan
[1:00:40] there's coming a spirit of death upon
[1:00:42] the land death is the reason we die
[1:00:45] Israel had to have something to keep
[1:00:47] them from dying and it was the blood
[1:00:50] over the door death God could remove the
[1:00:52] deathu it was sentenced it was the
[1:00:54] penalty was released that angel itself
[1:00:58] was released by The Geral to take out
[1:01:01] anyone who not under the blood God had
[1:01:05] no jurisdiction upon anyone who was not
[1:01:08] under the blood he said when I see the
[1:01:10] blood I'm going to pass over he released
[1:01:13] a death angel to knock out to kill
[1:01:15] everyone who was not under the blood and
[1:01:18] the Seven Thunders is the blood of Jesus
[1:01:21] the seven Thunders is the blood that God
[1:01:24] has covered all these years
[1:01:26] that's why we are
[1:01:27] [Applause]
[1:01:34] alive do you understand without the
[1:01:37] seven Thunders we'll be reaching six
[1:01:39] seals on our way to the tribulation and
[1:01:42] know it not
[1:01:43] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:01:46] hallelujah but because we have a blood
[1:01:49] because we have the fullness of the
[1:01:50] atonement not just the atonement but the
[1:01:53] atonement in it fullness Hallelujah
[1:01:55] blood in it fullness and in the blood
[1:01:57] have the life no blood no life no blood
[1:02:02] no anointing no blood no power no blood
[1:02:05] No Authority the blood give us Authority
[1:02:08] right now we don't even have power but
[1:02:10] we have authority by the blood we have
[1:02:12] confidence that when we speak we speak
[1:02:15] through the blood there is no sin when
[1:02:17] the blood is dear because the blood
[1:02:20] speaks better things than the blood of
[1:02:22] Abel the blood of God speaks faith in
[1:02:25] your doubt speak weak virtue in your
[1:02:28] weakness speak knowledge in your
[1:02:30] ignorance it's the blood of God over
[1:02:32] your life it's a pyramid in your soul
[1:02:36] it's the word pyramid in mechanic
[1:02:39] form let me try to finish off here oh
[1:02:42] hallelujah oh glory to God listen to
[1:02:46] this bum when spiritual Darkness gets
[1:02:49] upon the Earth it is time for the enemy
[1:02:51] to
[1:02:52] attack the devil is bong yeah when the
[1:02:56] spiritual Darkness come upon the Earth
[1:02:59] it's time for the enemy to attack watch
[1:03:02] we see fearful sights earthquakes tidle
[1:03:04] waves Falling Away gross Darkness hey
[1:03:08] High minded lovers of Pleasures watch
[1:03:11] that's what the world is pointing to but
[1:03:12] the church has another sign a blessed
[1:03:15] call out sign he promised here we go he
[1:03:17] promised you want to hear your sign you
[1:03:19] want to hear your sign he promised that
[1:03:22] there will be line in the church the
[1:03:24] church spiritual in the last days he
[1:03:27] would pour out but the former and the
[1:03:30] latter in the former in come first the
[1:03:32] latter in come second both former and
[1:03:35] latter rain in the same season he
[1:03:38] promised
[1:03:40] it so what I'm supposed to look for some
[1:03:44] man coming no man could bring a Revival
[1:03:47] if man could have bring it we had it
[1:03:49] already it takes the people to bring the
[1:03:52] Revival you got to know who you are all
[1:03:55] right
[1:03:55] [Applause]
[1:04:02] oh my here we go Hallelujah the sun is
[1:04:05] the word of God in the beginning God
[1:04:07] said let there be light and when the
[1:04:09] manifested word here we go when the word
[1:04:12] of God was manifested there was light
[1:04:16] first God spoke it what if it didn't
[1:04:18] manifest then it wasn't light yet but
[1:04:20] when he spoke it and then it was
[1:04:22] manifested or Vindicated his word was
[1:04:25] Vindicated
[1:04:26] light come into existence and that's the
[1:04:28] only way it can be done now is when the
[1:04:31] word is Vindicated God's written word
[1:04:34] Vindicated it shows light oh blessed be
[1:04:37] the name of the Lord do you believe that
[1:04:40] Hallelujah pise God gross Darkness
[1:04:42] blinding of Israel was for the lightning
[1:04:44] of the Gentiles now the blinding of the
[1:04:46] Gentiles is the lightning of Israel God
[1:04:50] blind the Jews that the Gentiles might
[1:04:52] see now God is about to Blind the
[1:04:54] Gentiles that the Jews might see
[1:04:56] cross Darkness have to come Darkness
[1:04:58] have to cover the people but a missst
[1:04:59] all of that Darkness there's going to be
[1:05:01] light oh Hallelujah light in your life
[1:05:05] because the spoken word manifest is the
[1:05:07] light coming to your life oh hallelujah
[1:05:11] praise God praise God good people caught
[1:05:14] up sincere people watch like Mary and
[1:05:17] Joseph they were sincere they were
[1:05:19] presuming Jesus was with them but they
[1:05:21] miss Jesus isn't that right and there
[1:05:23] are many preachers people put their
[1:05:24] names on the book many thought they were
[1:05:26] sprinkled and confirmed baptized in
[1:05:28] father and Holy Ghost but the fact is he
[1:05:30] wasn't there what is light question the
[1:05:34] Vindicated spoken word of God outside of
[1:05:37] that there's no light it takes God word
[1:05:39] made manifest How can there be Darkness
[1:05:41] and Light it can't be dark and light
[1:05:43] together they can't Fellowship together
[1:05:45] and the Bible said and God separated the
[1:05:48] light from the darkness and the Darkness
[1:05:51] he called night and the light he called
[1:05:52] day so God has separate the light from
[1:05:55] from the darkness he don't have mix up
[1:05:57] light and darkness he just separate the
[1:05:58] light from the darkness so once light
[1:06:01] start to come he have to separate it and
[1:06:04] light do push back Darkness that's why
[1:06:06] the darkness has to have a Revival the
[1:06:08] darkness have to be pushed together when
[1:06:09] the light have to come something got to
[1:06:11] move people who never come together they
[1:06:13] have to come together because light is
[1:06:15] pushing light is coming as the light
[1:06:18] coming the darkness of the gather
[1:06:19] together oh say Amen somebody because
[1:06:22] the light is coming oh Hallelujah what's
[1:06:25] that light that's the morning Starlight
[1:06:27] that's the light of the uncoming sun
[1:06:29] reflecting upon the stars of God him
[1:06:31] that overcometh will I bring the morning

[1:20:04] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:20:06] which he was betrayed took
[1:20:09] bread and when he had given thanks he
[1:20:12] broke it and said take eat this is my
[1:20:16] body which is broken for you this do in
[1:20:20] remembrance of
[1:20:22] me after the same manner also he took
[1:20:25] the cup when he had SED saying this cup
[1:20:29] is the New Testament in my blood this do

[1:20:35] remembrance of me Hallelujah for as
[1:20:37] often as eat this bread and drink this
[1:20:40] cup ye do show the Lord's death till he

[1:20:50] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:20:53] and blood of the Lord
[1:20:56] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:20:59] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[1:21:02] cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:21:06] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
