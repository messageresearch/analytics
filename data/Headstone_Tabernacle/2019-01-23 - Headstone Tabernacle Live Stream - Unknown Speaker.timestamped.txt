[32:09] atmosphere pitch miracles could take
[32:12] place in the atmosphere pitch or the
[32:15] Prophet love that kind of atmosphere
[32:17] you didn't have to pretty much that was
[32:19] here just booth he said preach it rise
[32:21] up and receive your healing rise up and
[32:23] claim it in the ranch by happy fees
[32:25] cancer everything run hallelujah from
[32:28] the presence of Almighty Laurie so the
[32:37] first thing is Satan the serpent never
[32:41] read about he came against worship isn't
[32:44] that right he didn't want that worship
[32:46] he wanted I wish it for himself he did
[32:49] not want that worship for God he did not
[32:51] want that worship for the Most High
[32:53] isn't that right you wanted all to
[32:55] himself but first he has to stop the
[32:58] worship I was going on Harlan is nice
[33:00] first the other introduced holiday his
[33:03] thoughts he's thinking he got to
[33:06] interject his opinion on the matter and
[33:09] show the Angels why he thought that this
[33:12] was a better idea that this was a better
[33:14] way of living
[33:15] this is a better direction to go into is
[33:18] not the devil hates worship he heats let
[33:21] me get into the atmosphere he hates when
[33:23] you get into the spirits because when
[33:25] you're in the spirits you could hear
[33:27] from God the devil hates revelation but
[33:31] we love it were true revelation in our
[33:34] lives but gates of Hell could never
[33:37] prevail against it Oh
[33:41] with true revelation you know life you
[33:43] see what was written in the scripture
[33:46] and revelation teks the what was written
[33:49] in the scripture it takes the wood of
[33:52] God and it makes it present tense to you
[33:55] I'm gonna say that again
[33:57] revelation power revelation stimulation
[34:01] when it comes upon the world a written
[34:03] word it brings us to life it makes it
[34:06] present tense to you deeper believer it
[34:09] makes it present tense to you the
[34:11] individual so no matter how long the
[34:14] scripture is sitting there for years
[34:16] just as quotes just as books or just as
[34:20] teeps
[34:20] but when revelation strike it then it
[34:23] becomes real when it becomes alive then
[34:27] it becomes quicken when it's no more but
[34:30] now it's an anointing dropped upon it to
[34:34] make it present tense to you oh we could
[34:37] read that cortisol healer but when it's
[34:40] inspired to you and something in your
[34:42] heart can raise up and wrap your healing
[34:45] and take it from the devil what he took
[34:48] from you you can take back your joy take
[34:51] back your peace to do tonight create an
[35:09] atmosphere create an anointing for the
[35:12] spirit to come down and anoint the word
[35:15] as is being preached to us anoint the
[35:18] promises as it's coming to us hallelujah
[35:22] are no more words just flying away ahead

[35:33] real name is your name is not lavell
[35:36] your name is not John Jones but there's
[35:39] a mystery of what the book is

[47:42] hallelujah
[47:43] I Martin Luther listen his thing is nice
[47:47] they came to the requirement up today is
[47:50] not Wesley lived in LA they came to the
[47:52] requirement the requirement of
[47:54] sonification is not right they have to
[47:57] come to that it wasn't enough for them
[47:59] to be justified in that age you
[48:02] understand it or reveal something higher
[48:05] and because that you really high it
[48:08] required something more of them to step
[48:11] up to the standard the platform that was
[48:15] being presented in that day wasn't good
[48:18] enough for you to say do you believe
[48:19] Martin Luther's message hallelujah but
[48:21] with this that was revealed hallelujah
[48:24] can you take the word can you any man
[48:27] how can you die out to yourself and
[48:29] receive the word for nothing and they
[48:31] all had a requirement for that age is
[48:33] nice and they met the requirements god
[48:37] how do people in every to meet that
[48:40] requirement in that day and I'm seeing
[48:43] tonight that God has people tonight that
[48:46] I hear to receive the requirements I can
[48:48] beat the standard of this ha
[48:50] Oh hallelujah to meet the standard of
[48:52] perfection there has to be a quality of
[48:55] people like won't have to choose it
[48:57] couldn't just be anybody hard everybody
[48:59] choose somebody but standing Trinidad
[49:02] somebody Remus me granny
[49:07] when I know angel corners wherever he
[49:10] had to choose somebody to do it
[49:12] oh it's not you then who it's not yeah
[49:16] well if not now then Oh hallelujah
[49:20] however there's got to be a people in
[49:22] the land
[49:23] yeah Oh hardly the Prophet did not come
[49:26] in vain therefore as we have received
[49:29] much we are expected much of us a man in
[49:33] its last day
[49:34] why don't we got a pretty much printout
[49:37] ceasing until every one of these virtues
[49:39] these requirements be living in us we
[49:43] got to live our fate live our virtue we
[49:46] live our knowledge live our temperance
[49:48] live our patients we can't stick your
[49:51] head in the sand and try to prevent it
[49:57] hasn't been preached because the gospel
[50:00] was not me plead to them like it's me me
[50:02] clean to us in this last year unless or
[50:05] whom much is given much is expected
[50:08] that's why so much emphasis is being put
[50:10] on prayer and being put on 10 occasion
[50:13] and sanitation and consecration why
[50:16] because we got to rise up from our
[50:19] humanistic into a supernatural realm to
[50:22] catch the mind of God for this day
[50:25] that's why when you come to church we
[50:27] come to lift up our hands we don't look
[50:29] around us praise God we come to meet
[50:32] with God we come to meet the pillow we
[50:35] come to get in contact with that chain
[50:37] angel that was with the prophets that
[50:40] same angel with the rainbow presence
[50:43] that same angel with the rainbow glory
[50:45] that angel is on here now mixing things

[51:21] until the Holy Ghost has found its way
[51:24] in our hearts we can't stop tonight we
[51:27] gotta keep on praying keep on pressing

[51:55] fire he did it for Peter come on now he

[52:01] it for you tonight
[52:03] somebody say man Peter James John Wall
[52:17] in the upper room and they were human
[52:19] beings just like you and me it's night
[52:22] they were afraid prophetic shut
[52:25] themselves in the upper room but you'll
[52:28] be leaving on a promise believing on the
[52:31] Lord Jesus that the same Jesus had come
[52:34] holla at 8:00 with them and sup with
[52:36] them all the time they didn't know who
[52:38] he was but then real slowly
[52:41] when he come back in his resurrection
[52:43] ministry he began to reveal the
[52:45] scripture and I began to open their
[52:47] understanding but what he was telling
[52:49] them while he was yet with them
[52:51] in Galilee and in Jerusalem and all
[52:53] these places remember the things I spoke
[52:55] unto you you shall receive the Holy
[52:57] Ghost the son of man shall be delivered
[52:59] up and a sinful man and after three days
[53:02] he raised up again remember I told you
[53:04] those things and they have
[53:05] to pass look at my hands look at my feet
[53:08] look at my side it's me don't you be
[53:11] afraid don't be afraid of the devil
[53:13] don't be afraid of Lucifer don't be
[53:16] afraid of Roman army you want more than
[53:18] conquerors don't you be afraid I'm gonna
[53:22] come with you I'm gonna be in you even
[53:25] to the end of the earth and I'll be with
[53:26] you in Judea I'll be with you in Samaria
[53:29] I'll be with whoever you call and the
[53:31] Bible says the Lord went with hammer
[53:33] everywhere confirming the word with
[53:36] signs wonders and miracles it was not
[53:38] only talking about the world but they
[53:40] heal the sick on the spot they are
[53:43] rested the pebbles on the spot
[53:45] hallelujah are we gonna come back to
[53:47] that kind of a church in this last day
[53:50] tonight that's gonna be a church in
[53:52] Trinidad we're gonna heal the sick raise
[53:54] the dead
[53:55] that's how pebbles Oh rainbow glory will
[54:00] be all around you because I've been the
[54:02] same Jesus doing the same things he did
[54:05] when he was oh my whoa Jesus
[54:16] Eman so I was talking about the process
[54:21] just about 5-10 minutes again talk about
[54:25] a process in alright it's a process that
[54:27] destination and God's ultimate purpose
[54:29] for us it's not just to go to church but
[54:32] occupy a Pew is now or the pit hi don't
[54:35] be nice Christians but this process was
[54:38] the ticket a destination what's the take
[54:40] us to sonship what's it take us to our
[54:43] adoption was the tickets to all place in
[54:46] Christ the Prophet said all place in
[54:48] Christ's heavenly places it's actually
[54:51] the believers position in Christ that's
[54:53] what it is not just some airy-fairy
[54:54] thing it's not a made-up heaven earlier
[54:57] but it's a position that you haven't God
[54:59] Jesus came seeing the kingdom of heaven
[55:02] is at hand
[55:04] and you didn't know you just talked
[55:05] about the King number but he
[55:06] demonstrated the kingdom you heal the
[55:09] shake was the King number he reads the
[55:11] dead that was the kingdom because this
[55:14] gospel that we preach is not in word
[55:16] only but is in power and it's an
[55:19] administration of the Holy Ghost in
[55:22] other words there's going to be a people
[55:23] in the I'm going to demonstrate the Holy
[55:26] Ghost anaconda demonstrate the shaitaan

[58:36] as it was true intrapreneurship
[58:38] trying to establish business establish
[58:41] themself and society as someone but it's
[58:44] different when someone is carry on the
