about it they wish they had this opportunity and she won't you want to struggle in here like Honeywell they know it is you know it is there's not a cord of your imagination you know the same border take two million people kill all of them you know except just one killer bunny next generation you know this isn't God you know this God is God you know you're not serving me do not serve in this church you're serving the Living God not at that one to live in one the same one that said behold I send you Elijah and he said William Branham is the same God incentives will be a bride nothing gonna stop that right and if you are gonna be part of that bright nothing will stop you and neither here because show them that I'm talking to the bride this morning the church members can say Amen but the brightest a.m. after that law because the bride will be anointed the bride will be inspired it's not your pass yet to worry about you know it's the future if you take out salt pass he saw persecuted Christians his future was gonna be Paul a prophet so they let it devil tie you put your past your past can be messed up tied up tangle up wrapped up and contrary but got to straighten that out that's why you come to the gospel for what they strip know your past and forgive your past and bless your future or to the Lord a show [Music] what I said [Music] [Applause] [Music] let's act as if is Ovilus our let's pre as never before let's be a blessing to others and try to do all that we can for remember this is the only time that we will be mortal only time and from this on from that time that we leave this world we go into another world and we will never have the opportunity to win one soul in that world or that's gonna be one will be one right now and if this may be our last hour then what should we do on this hour this is the only opportunity and time for your toe in at least one soul testify to one person have a plan for one not two children one not your family one you can move the selfishness we're not talking about that for God so loved the world he gave His only begotten Son to find you and now we want you to find somebody else because this is what adoption is about [Applause] let me see sit we're going good setup chesnut buddy be linear and man she knows muscles they have for my spiritual power half how much quarter with them and corporate me that not adoption him but I'm sure that's what good enough steady loss like how quad caiman gonna guide me they say Adam Adam why I Dow adopter thought you said I'm gonna pee when you're like in a pasta I not adoption everybody saying I'm doing that that not adoption adoption is giving you the same spirit the hunt after the loss because he'll have his largest mouth and he'll sucking Souls down pulling people don't inhale down hallelu that's why God trying by the word to show to show that you wouldn't be a church member you want to be part of the word bride unless judge members forget them that's why butter Thompson said don't let no don't let nobody be your example in the church let the world be an example don't look what sister doing so she's and so and so the proper sister soy sauce lettuce also might be a cooking might be off hallelujah what you want is the word the living word you wonder would live in you so you can't just just just by one individual that might be I make believer or unbeliever but that genuine believers inside the air or glory to God hallelujah real Christians want to be changed want to walk right lived right talk right - right real sons of God and the devil know them you know you say Paul I know these I know of course the devil no the sons of God never liked over em okay the Lord our show of course them Devesh the who you are there's a light following you when you were smoking drinking that like was looking for you that lights on you and he will not let you go that light found you [Applause] [Music] you may be seated hallelujah so anything God chose you of between us when you repent then God chose you when you're very plain holy in the pain righteous that meant God chose you go to a lady for the function you were before he was even born she sell my in your mother's womb I call you and I got in you be a prophet to the nation before I was even born God see you coming God put your name on the book see you coming Oh glory to God you see the message was in the winter you see all these Horrors where they're going to already press on all your frustration or your anger all your temper or you're upset you see all at that and it still predetermined and predestined hallelujah ordained or glory the gaudiya children this way your son tap where your daughter tap with this one that way and that's less frustrate him you know you're gonna make it somehow a man in oh my believe that and someday the Holy Spirit will speak to you and call you out on one side somewhere in order to comment on a hillside in the washroom somewhere I will anoint you for a sitting service or a certain thing to do who gonna call your side Holy Spirit not a bishop not a pastor not a minister at all de the Holy Spirit will call you a side because the Holy Spirit compartments are coming on his last day to deal with sons and daughters be enough Pentecostals we are not Lutheran's or Methodists we are men who have to take the book and eat it we amend that Daniel saw that Ezekiel saw that all those prophets was looking at that the people that know their God shall be strong everybody that make another bragger be strong [Applause] every man woman that could be making it to the bride to be strong gotta handle weak mrs. Jesus this mrs. Jesus gonna be just like Jesus all glory to God quite a guy I know with wife this wife could be flesh of his flesh pool of his born world of his will and the parable and prophesy what you see manifested temporarily will be manifested in his fullness when the press come so our pressures coming so if you can't take this normal temperature that you're going through much as when God put the heat up when the heat it up if you can't handle what you're going to write now I'll sit still no sign of your Goose book that means you have to be able to endure and come true very nicely what you're going through right now because I recognize the present sufferings but you're barely going through right now it's not even going to be compared to [Music] one if you can't go to what you're going through right now forget it you ain't making it a human you I said you want to take me over here god I think what that were up to here is that a afraid to be changed in a moment they're gonna die are you looking too good I'm gonna groan take me away we want to get to do what to escape or you want to escape touch it so you are what's not you know I guess snatch out he walked with God and was not for God took him do you understand what we're saying this morning okay so Balaram says it won't be the lane of the hands of the presbytery of the elders it will be lane on the hands of God Almighty Himself to put a new ministry in you a new room on you and set you out as an example or you mean we after the example furs yes got a Quonset no power no Rascals it has to be an example well you can see live in fate living with you live in knowledge what is that an example seed Sun a living example of Jesus Christ then gotta put powers behind that hallelujah the Whitlam of spirits and angels behind watch and all the demons out of poor mint will never upset you god grant my brethren that with each one receive that blessing now we didn't say go and teach the word he said go and preach the gospel go teach the word no go preach the gospel and the word is the beginning like we see here or the forerunner of the gospel the word goes out and the gospel of the power of the demonstration of God follows the word and makes the word manifest so that's a what we striving for so people want to fight me because I started preaching us but yet noise that our body gets started 40 years like a started but we all guess either burned it or who get started already god bless them but we gonna get started or chlorine according the world reporter which power and after every service demons jamming right on the building as they come be backing them out as they can be cutting them off a sickness come with blowing it back push it back every service every time you believe that all glories are gone almost done he the world goes out the gospel of the power of demonstration of the God follows the word I mixed the word manifest that is the gospel and in order if man could preach the gospel the last word he said on what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us what he said they say the power was gone he said the power hasn't even arrived yet Oh glory to God hallelujah this city power God hallelujah the power gone before Eve Moravia God trying to prepare you for this power where they are you ready or not the power coming where every petal not be power coming Oh blowing up got the power in car blowing computer or the water space power to do support you what kind of things and a chisel lolly in some old power on old engine out there but the church gonna get that power dynamics what we are the preacher that's why we want you to be expecting it so when you come to service you come at a genuine expectation for the power of God to be loose to you okay just a few more hallelujah we have a specialty future this morning I listen to you it's not long so that's why I change something with you and Balarama saying let's add to our feet these things that we might comment the full search of Christ being joined together with godly love fear of God reference in our hearts to one another deep deep listen to this this is let's add to our feet these things then we might come in full statue of Christ being joined together with godly love fear of God so when somebody said I don't care that's a dangerous statement anytime you hear somebody's advocate watch them close what's that word please you have the key I'm talking about I care - the milkman I care how I treat the Cabot man I can't holler to the postman we can't don't want nobody misinterpret my behavior to have a way of seeing Christ because here no you don't care he's a Pharisee I don't care what if are sitting about me I'm a son of the king yes the Sadducees the Pharisees a hero do ya some people see this one is a super see they make it I can't go get him super these glasses this is so fancy I didn't win a special glasses they could see superseded and see shocked i hain't care as a shock you can't see that because is a soul and when you pawn your glasses he solves all so looking for funding Christians but Solomon superseded Salah the son of God he I know that yetee riding high horses Ellis he sell us for his doctrine the language flip them over is sell us for the kingdom of God what's that see you next week go under flip UT next week you for yourself you for your own life or your own ambition when is that I'm gonna flip you over because God can flip you over everything on a walk so perfect for you you'll be shocked oh go go the whooping smoothed out for you yes because you're putting God first so let's he said I he said watch what a godly love you have God reverence in our heart to one another deep respect to one another brotherly and sisterly kindness never vulgarity nothing just purity of the Holy Ghost listen be a Christian walk with feet let the virtue of God flow through you let the knowledge of God when it comes to right and wrong is I imagine and never acting like us they were men of few words till they got in the pulpit they walked him done what he's supposed to do and walked out they had power they had thought you they had no arguments with men they know where they stood he said hall and warlin not from God they just do it as soon why how could they know it wasn't not from God they had all these virtues in here all these qualifications and the first rule none of God compared with everyone of this denote it was the Word of God and the widow went oh praise God so no board is eternal he was the perfect perfect love perfect peace perfect joy perfect satisfaction all those seven spirits as we get in Revelation and the only way we can come back to perfection is to come back to that perfection which is God so to come back to what the perfect spirit is not right no there are seven steps that goes to God this is what the prophecy on my steps just seven not twenty-seven several steps that goes to God for the seven spirits as it comes down seven steps comes down seven steps go up isn't that right now there are seven Church ages seven steps God building his church it's like one person into an individual into himself the glory the power of God coming down through this well in it together therefore the pinnacles of people let all the Lutheran let all the Wesleyan they doesn't know what they're talking about you see but the way some people can come up at that

living in the pyramid and there are seven steps to go into the presence of the King and you're gonna hit that seven step you know what that seven step is that's brotherly love that's the blood of the edge one day you gonna strike it by revelation by inspiration by manifestation and because when you stand praying you could forgive the Holy Spirit charity dynamics come upon you because you have the

last week's talk mine so we continue some so mr. which sums 23 verse 6 first says surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for heaven some Psalm 22 verse 1 I was cleared when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord so what gladness this is what David is keep saying if we someone under there in Hebrews chapter 10 verse 23 let let us all fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promise and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works not fasciculus simply of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more has received the day approaching what is that day the coming of the hope so much the more we should do it amen Hilary the blessing to the reading was working yourself so I'm making inspiration of last week I made my subject of us my title just so it became a beautiful title on the tape so tightly I was glad when they said unto us and to me and to us let us go into the house of the Lord then my subject today is coming to church isn't that beautiful what a nice subject and my inspiration that I may dwell in the house of the Lord forever my isn't that your desire that's why I desire so I wanna just have it kept salgo but back so just pick up the caning since navien thinks it ought to be I send this to our church the smarty this is not the only way that you feel to be a son a daughter of God because you have to help eternal life in his only one form of eternal life and that's God's life only one form of eternal life and that was God there to be a son of God you had to be in him always the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was eco the Father before there was even a molecule and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life it was in God as a son of God and you exist after his word is coming to you to light up this age you express God's life in you because you're the son in daughter of God therefore you get what I mean congregation says amen you are it says you are now mate you said it says you sitting in this church tonight we said this morning because your duty is to express God to the solution and to the people of his neighborhood wait when you were so shy wherever you are God knew that you would be here because you have to be one of these genes all these attributes you had to be if you ever it says if you ever got eternal life then it was always eternal so you didn't come eternal the day you got saved of the day you gave your heart to the Lord or the day you met them as he says you are always eternal so in other words before you and your great grandmother and father came together you were already there now you mix orange you know what I'm saying now the German gets carried down all the ways so you were eternal before you your father and mother came together you are already there you are eternal he says and always was eternal life and God before there was a foundation the world knew that you would be here so if you see that then you realize what I got a great the purpose I'm not just here to to be in church and have a family and work and have a job no I'm here to express God to destination I am here to express God to my neighborhood on the job in the school adversity hallelujah you're an attribute of God God will take a great denominations apart he takes individuals apart speak to them this is in your him he says yeah he takes you apart and speak to you sometimes over in the closet when you feel led to go and you don't go then you might miss something so if you don't go to your closet to pray he says and if you don't go some as you feel led to go but you don't go he says you're gonna mess something and that's how these you feel led to go to church you don't go you miss something because God is imparting something don't want you to go to church you want you to manifest something to you through his word through some move that is making you fail to go and you must see something amen so that's the importance of coming to church we're trying to show the importance the reason we come we know Church don't save you the building or save you but there's something that God is doing in the church and this is easy imparting something and he says if you know that you gonna miss it and once it's gone is gone thank you brother gave recruited a nice message of thanks brother Gabriel I appreciated that put a nice message of the sermon of last week on his I don't know his profile in something and someone sent to me said I can mention my Peter James John come on the mountain of the Dead Mountain they would have missed that for nothing wish I had been there the prophecies says don't you and you wish you were there on the mountain when transfiguration he says here he says then he says you a position of a belief in Christ then just as sure as the church time comes you just can't keep from coming to church you're just going to go if you have to hobble yo sorry to use you brother Brian even if you ho brother Brian hello you're almost buddy comes this is the Rasta here today no but you see Oh co-op I believe she Hubble stitchers but she comes that's all you're going to you're gonna go to church because the spirit itself beareth record of gathering together in Christ now this morning we gathered in Christ we not gathered it in time message believers no we gathered in Christ that's the banner that's over us this morning and the Bible says we seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus so this morning you don't just own the chair you in heavenly places that's where we are simply brother this isn't natural seat but the spiritual see through you Satan is in heavenly places hallelujah my says yeah I only stole not long ago I was talking to a monastery safer on the plenum my congregation he said I wish I could get them to come to church he said every Easter day everyone there to show their new permits and new clothes he said they will bring a lily and put it on the altar and always but them Merry Christmas because they won't be back until next Esther I said because they just church members they just church members not born again so yet the prophets bringing a difference between people that's hungry for God they are born again but it says there's a difference and others why they why they do that because they church members now we know one church members we want born-again people you must say I am born again I don't settle to be a church member I don't settle to be a message member I want to be a born-again member of the body of Jesus Christ hallelujah he says yeah and a man that's born of the spoon of God loves to go to church now he loves to go to church hallelujah brother there's something when you love to go to church my and nothing can teach you you love to go to church better then you says then he loves to eat his dinner you can love God more than you love your food and then there's something in you brother that even the food doesn't matter food or no food we showed last week shoes or no shoes if you come in with an overall it doesn't matter no one is gonna look down Moneo why but you come into church my more than the dinner when he's hungry the spiritual man on the inside has to be fed if that man isn't fair he will die so I'm gonna say friends you can't survive only by just coming to church on Sunday and Wednesday you gotta feed that man if you eat every day isn't it and reverse it every day some eats three meals some it's five meals but you feel that this nature made how much more the spiritual man has to survive brother you will read your Bible you wanna pray you're gonna read the spoken word you get into why you feel in the spiritual man hallelujah the Bible said Jesus told Satan in the debate he said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God that's how man lives not by the bread alone but by the Word of God man lives he's out the man loves my British inward man lives by the bread of God Jesus and the bread of life that cometh down from the Father my Cillian position of the believer in Christ they just show us the church sign comes you just can't keep from coming to church you're just going to go if you have to hold okay that's the one we read so okay Souza is one of the most important days are they on Calvary of the days that God ever let down on the earth and if it's so important that the human race Calvary I think it's good for us to go back and examine see that what it means so we got to examine and see what did that day means to us for I'm sure that the slate power that we live in in now this was a breach in 60 and it's called it they're the late hours that we live in we are seeking every importance of God that we can know and and all that we can find out why we are here to learn of it to see what it is for us and what God has done for us and see what his promise to us for this day he says and that's what we come to church for to find out the hour the lateness the time we live in in how serious what is happening why is this going on and if I know most of the time is prophetic what you see that happening all day at the prophet prophesied what's happening this fools the pro football society what happening in the government that refer to society so you don't know the word now you wonder what's happening oh if you know the word you know the spoken word do you know the Bible then you know this must happen this must come to pass this must be it does fast take place so you don't get shaken you don't be back you realize thank you God I see the word fulfilled I see the power of God I mean back mind when the angel stirs the water you gotta get in there brother we don't know when he's coming again with another move of the Spirit so in that spirit move I'm shocking myself in I wanna be a part of it I wanna be part of the revival block don't pass me by don't don't pass me by that's how we come to church amen young people come on you can feel me if you serve there I'm gonna have to leave you and go feel hallelujah this is yeah and it's promised to us for Thursday that's why we come to church that's why the preacher preaches I mean coming here to entertain you and Ty and I must rebel on Wednesday I just come from overseas but I coming here since the preaches that's where the preacher says to preach that's why they study and meditate on the sculptor's and seek for inspiration is because this because he's the public servant to God's people and he's trying to find something that God would have to say to his people something that would help them so I don't say this to be funny and to it in different but something to help you and if I don't say what one to me if I don't say God would judge me but I said last week your blood is on my hands I pray sit I said it and I'm saying it again today and you might feel friendly but that's fine you find out wonder if there are only stupid brother Raymond said be safe from he'll be safe from what I'm going through [Applause] hallelujah and you say something to help you don't look don't look at the container but look what's in when you take the medicine after you treat you turn the container way right but the medicine helps you so don't forget the containing sample over the container take the medicine brother that's gonna help you that's gonna heal up spiritually okay now don't chuck me away please hallelujah but just to show you the many times we don't worry will contain we wonder what's inside so he says yeah it might condemn you in your son's butt but would be a help to raise them up then they might forsake this ins so I say please shake you so that you can forsake your sins forsake your negligence your laziness you stop unless you resent it must be broken by the Spirit of God then God helps you but as long as you certainly with a difference for the car can never help you I can never be a blessing to you because you're always sitting there with something on you I was something that you heard or something that must told you now you said they look at me hey come on man you see me I'm marching on I'm going on nothing stops me brother I'm so determined I'm so fired so when a servant even much the more nothing's gonna stop me by hallelujah and I wanna go that way men there's so many things I can say but I'm trying to keep my balance here hallelujah so you can forsake your sense raise up and serve the Lord and minister to seek those things then that's what I'm doing because I see the love I see the thing coming in so promises brother oppa then you go in there and you cut it out and I said last week don't move in squabble because if you're offended in the word it says blessed is he whose not offended in me and my words if the said I'm saying is truth and you get offended then there's something wrong your spirit let me my spirit can cooperate to the word then you gotta check your spirit and this is serious this is serious business we not plain we're not gambling we don't playing around the serious brother my and that only last week this is got to do with Jesus every interesting it's not about you it's about Jesus every quiet that comes into yeah it's about Jesus not about the choir all the magicians it's not about them it's about Jesus reduce about Jesus everything we do when we praised it it's about Jesus when we in the world it's about Jesus in the moon is about Jesus presence and his power when he comes down so get yourself out of the way and like I said he's not speaking to the church is speaking to individuals it's calling individuals apart by because you say otherwise if you would the group or you want your friend or your body no because your body that now you now you're upset now you throw the body body thing is little closer man you got a deal God deals with you as an individual [Applause] well I can say some real things yet that will shake you but I hope you spiritually enough to handle it and deal with it it says your influence I says I will try to be out early I don't want you to miss sunny school and it's alright for you to miss a day's work you won't miss that too much but keep you are keep you till about 9:30 or something on the other night but don't my son is what every do he says you can must work but don't miss church so and you see people don't miss church why because the boss the ducks so you don't want short pay well I don't want spiritual short pay now I want every blessing everything that is pouring out I want it yeah I want to be here no matter and I'm gonna read a quote the sea shall not be shall possess the gate to verse enemy fine thing that I ever have to happen me is when I come to the house of the Lord I can I can be so tired now listen how beautiful is this code I can be so tired wore out and upset now you even get to that condition where you walk out you tie it you upset something upset you your word per process but just let me get to the house of the Lord we all the Saints I've gathered and I pray then I go goofy there's something soothing about it don't you think so present something that you soothes you something that is up all the wrinkles and you are just satisfied that's how I feel brother I'm tired I'm upset at this moment but you know I feel so CUDA I can't do the law peoples also because I love in brother and to be with the saints of God because I know when I come here there's something good I doubt the obsess and the disappointments and all the things that went wrong God does that hallelujah man I feel like running and you don't wanna feel like that I do it brother because I won't Express going I want to express how I feel my isn't the Prophet something man even if I'm talk even if I'm disappointed even if I know how upset I come to those so there's almost no excuse but this happen if that happened so earth God died for you I'm coming to the house of the Lord I've not come to see program and I'm not coming to see anyone coming at all oh all worship all put each it is for Jesus until my notice Jesus invested with all the powers of God but when he met Satan he never used these powers you refer to the word he did he said it's written man shall not live by bread alone but proceedeth out of the mouth of God how can you say you can stay home and just be a good a Christian as you would be a church you can't do it now this is a prophet man and if you respect the prophets word right then you do everything why it says yeah you can't do it read the word the Bible that it says the Holy Spirit feeds on the word the Bible is God's spiritual diet of for his church and the Holy Spirit is the one who brings it to you and places it in your heart and what thing is giving you water it and every divine promise will produce just exactly what God said would do it's got to him in the word and his word is life you believe that it's a good it's a good spiritual diet my I don't do know you know ladies like to die it and some men also but I mean that's fine then it's good but what about the spiritual diet come on now let's believe this oh goodness it says here the Chilton is Commission there's so much of this legal today don't touch not taste not do not he says do these legal things legally I don't come to church tonight legally I feel tired I've been nervous but I came I didn't say good again I'm gonna say them because this happened I'm upset I'm wondering about something that's are out before me my heart's burning even so much the mouths for telling I watch the Prophet he says I've got current pains right at this minute just shooting back and forth up and down through year week he says weak nervous trembling catch a whole year sweet because I love disappointments because I love you not yet the Saints are deadly bumpy Kevin can you imagine me before you know the circulation is not working my brakes is the concern then the circulation on the work now you need a physiotherapy now you need more extra attention you need more medicine but if you just came you it wouldn't have happened because the Holy Spirit is giving you the proper diet but now you say the way you weren't here when he was giving it out when it was been pulled out when it was been imparted he would not hear so you didn't receive now you finally got complications more complications man now you find this one giving you this remedy try this try that and you further yo it may be okay to us cuz you listen out to someone else instead of coming to the house of God where the word is preached and the Holy Spirit knows your needs and its tipping point up or to myself but no you wanna listen brother do somebody else's opinion come on brother we must be grownups women don't bore children man to be tossed to and fro when I was a child I squeak like a child I acted like a child I did childish things but when I become a man I put away [Applause] that's why I said last week we're not gonna see you mom we didn't meet you brother we give it up me strong me that makes us grow

Abner is right that man said yes city yes your opportunity take him out he said woe unto me for touch God's anointed man so wait for your time wait for your season is coming brother this devil is not

the Lord brother we are going to tour the power of God and we come into power but wait until the time happens [Applause] don't be foolish to do something wrong my says I'm squeezing my shoes I felt anything but come down your why why did I come then because I love God I love love or die I must stand here for you it's not because I have I have to I wouldn't care about whether I do it or not if I die I still go to heaven anyhow but I'm coming because I love him you serve God because you love him not because you've got to do it because you love it enough now we're going to church to better ourselves and progress is watch every service you go out you go out worse or you go better and it takes like a just a matter of years and then we can see what what in the services do to you why is this one gone why is that why because did it do you better or did it to us admit it do you good I believe it's doing you good that's why you came I'm so glad to see you yeah thank you for coming I thought after last week man and Wednesday night I praise God he was for people hallelujah normal but it can't serve me better and I thought nobody will be here but I see the pictures of who god bless you for coming man hallelujah because we love one another it's a love affair we love God we love these people I can't say I love God but I don't love you my makes us better Christians made the citizens better fathers better mothers me the neighbors we come because Christ has told us if we could come in anything in his name we are we assemble gathered many as two or three he would be with us and would grant to us so what could be anymore be petted to us today them to know that we are at the church for for to better ourselves to broaden our understand so now you have a better revelation so when the enemy comes and it tells you already Wednesday morning you got the headachy honey now you you already got the better understanding and knowing that I'm gonna be in the house of God because I've broadened my understanding and I am bettered myself right speak back to him in church as police is so they're very loyal to go to church so they've a very light to go to church no matter how good our cold it is they'll wrap up in a blanket set on a bobsled and try for the horses for 30 miles he speaking of those who people in know know which went so slow and he says out there sell that donkeys itself this is just to come to a service walk through the snow for hours it says that underscore how cool it is they'll wrap up in a blanket sit on a bobsled and drag the horses for 30 miles to get to church they walk through the snowdrifts and everything else he hung an old they all grouped together one family gets another and they start walking and they go it's a sacrifice that makes that they make is what causes them to get so much out of the service so he sees what you put in what you get now if it's not a sacrifice then you're not gonna get nothing you just come to choose to be just you're gonna need nothing but when it's a sacrifice and I know I got so many things to do and though she's not done in the washing leave there brother but I come to also got this show and he says the bigger the sacrifice the bigger the blessing let's face it we are men what we are doing we haven't even resisted to blood yet but brother come on man we can make it yes we can make I'm here to tell you we can make it hallelujah and when there's no second friends is not very much to the service you have to really get down in and do something that hurts real bad us even at you to come my hurt you even if you force to use the rent money sometimes master but cuz you know it's gonna oh I can say something one woman was walking and those years it was very cheap but to go over the bridge was fifteen cents and that's all she had in the purse so she has go back over the bridge but for her to cross is gonna cost 50 cents but while she's walking years of megacity and the Holy Spirit says give that 50 cents to the beggar and then she's back in the soup I brought but how manicotti and he said to her what is that to you follow down on me when I can preach the sermon on that what is there to do what's going on what is that to thee follow thou me [Music] [Applause] span she took it out when she gave it because she wanted to follow the lead knowledge but it and she sits by fate she walked towards the bridge and she didn't know what's gonna happen when she get there and just before she gets to the bridge yes Lane the 15 cents now if she was an obedient to the Holy Spirit brother do you think that would happen disappointed my obedience thank you brilliance is better than sacrifice amen so I get to go to church show God that I love you and you make a sacrifice because then they do into something goes out because you don't know what's going out he says I just like Mikey disbelieve all I thought I would get anything that I was the kid mama used to get maybe once once sake of candy and she's measured out two or three pieces to each one maybe for Christmas we get a little turn 1 and our little kept personal or something and I seen other kids would sleep sleep what colored slaves slaves and bicycles and things good clothes warm jackets and it just made me feel so bad I said if I ever have any children of my own I'm gonna do everything for them I could well I would be willing to go hungry to get something for my kids and when I loved when belly was just a little boy I get him a little price a tricycle and I got him everything and mirror a mirror who tried everything to sacrifice her own clothes and things to get him something but you know what we begin to find out I got him a little tricycle and a little boy a bow and arrow and everything I find him with a spoon or a stick out in the backyard dick in some way the next ones won't be like that you just got to he says you can give anybody everything right on their hand and they don't want it it's something you have to sacrifice for so you can give people anything they want for name but you have to sacrifice and that's way these will suffice in other words promises wanted to do better but when he found him is a plane with a tricycle he's there with the spoon and a stick and it's not why it didn't happen it didn't sacrifice he got it for nothing and it says that some people is and that's the way with salvation it's a complete sacrifice you gotta sacrifice you willing to die you willing to sacrifice your own time it's a complete sacrifice brother boy it's a sacrifice that you have to do every day and if you believe the Bible says take up your cross and follow me every day I can't put it down after sons I can't put it down on Monday and pick it up pick it up Sunday no I gotta carry my cross every day's a sacrifice sacrifice if they do every day something to get close to God do something and I know it's a sacrifice to you all this morning sir Tina's heart building is we said yeah let's keep our minds on the greatest sacrifice that man kind ever was given to do that was Jesus Christ when he was charged to come to the earth and do a anti in our state not only that but he's so descended into hell and they was there for three days and nights and on the third day he rose and he ascended on high sitting at the right hand of God in heaven making intercession upon our confessions of his atonement and His grace that's been provided for us now I want to speak to you this morning on a parable on some way the most unchurched person is here we'll be able to understand now we come to church to better ourselves we come to ourselves he says yeah okay better Christians better fathers I didn't read that one it says yeah and we feed us by the word see and the Holy Spirit is sent from God to take his word of God and give it to us as we have need of and I'm glad that God made the provision like that aren't you glad that he would feed us aren't you glad that he would feed us this morning because there's a famine in the world right now for the yearly not the preaching for the year in of the true Word of God we have many preachers but God says for the yearling so you need an ear to hear what does Fergie sign unto you you need to hear what God does one is speaking to you and I'm not speaking of the natural here you can immerse it just put it to you man let him the death in here yeah my judgment is conditioned how many attend church this morning let's see your hands all over the building well that's fine how many intended to attend tonight let's see the ends

history no matter what happens to its history right we started at what ten o'clock exactly do you know that's fast I came up in the quarter to eleven it's almost awkward slim I mean current elements almost of course all that forty five minutes is gone you can't regain it and you know even if as you sitting there god knows what's in your thoughts what thought you thinking what's in your heart so that's why it's always important to come with the right attitude but the Matthew the right perspective how many he says will attend church tonight intend to a change so tonight let's see your hands

coming back again you remember the ready last week stated to possible to as loyal as you can because you can to the cause of Christ and pack up them understand everything that that's going on for the cause of nice that's why we come brother and you have to put my shoulder to the wheel I didn't have to but I said I'm going in the game for the cause of price brother Jethro that's why we are mine let's bring on and for the cause of Christ and that God will bless you and the only way you can respect God is respect one another is that right and if you want somebody to say something good about you you say something good about somebody else they'll say something good about you cast your bread upon the water amen now this is a very famous one we like a man and you listen what he says cast

help you put your shoulder to the wheel you come to strengthen the church your presence is here to strengthen you you get bless and while you bless you strengthen in others yeah it says be not afraid it is I and then we thought we thought this day begins to approach to the end that we should not forsake the assembly I'm trying not to preach because I want to save my voice because I want to preach the night again yeah and I need to say before I'm leaving on Wednesday so that's why I'm speaking others I would have preached this man that we should not forsake the assembling ourselves together as some who have not faith but we are to set ourselves together and we are taught also that we are set in heavenly places in sa that early we are taught that were seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus been baptized into his body by one spirit that we are with him raised up in his resurrection and in his presence knowing that he ever lives to make intercession and we thank thee for that so we are not seated just here we are seated in heavenly places and heavenly places brother when you're up there there brother says we are all the same there's no video and smoothly and no we're all the same and I said last week even if you came in a wheelbarrow you come in a wheelbarrow even if you came with a Mercedes or a 4x4 it doesn't matter we are still the same in price no big short small you pick me oh we all the same brother even if you ten years in the message two years two weeks in the message listen man with when our provinces they'll get baptised they'll be the same as us this 15 the message there's no difference anyone gets the same pain I so I can feel I'm better than you know there's nothing all dead man come on are we gonna come here together sit together than have any places don't stay home he says don't say oh if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for the doors to open up yonder if God is in your heart now I wonder when I don't see you is God in your heart
