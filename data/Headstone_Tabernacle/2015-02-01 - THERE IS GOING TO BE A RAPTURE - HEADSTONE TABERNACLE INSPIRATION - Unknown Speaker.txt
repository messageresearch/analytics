message of justification but unless somebody come and preach it there would no one be saved and how can a man preach unless he's been sent so god had to have one cent from the catholic church he couldn't find nobody he looked up he looked low he looked down but he needed a messenger oh to proclaim the tea of the um the word of the lord for that day isn't that right so he went to the catholic church got a priest by the name of martin luther all the bible's written in latin so nobody knows what's going on but he is the only one who could read it he's the only one who can understand it and god predestinated martin luther to interpret the word for that that the just should live by faith hallelujah same and somebody oh i'm not going to pre-sprinkle on you not by 10 amends any our fathers
