same system and we have to work with it and what we have we have to work with and I just fit in a new verse inside here and kinda emotional but I'm thinking how this God that we serve no one who understand against this is the to think that all these superpowers with all their weapons and all the fast planes and all the all the all the technology and whatnot could crumble with something that can't see and Dictys them and so on what would happen when a bride get into hurting with something that the world can't see and they don't know that you have and they don't know it's in you and and

not have that in his kingdom God will not have a man in position without character that ain't working that is not going to happen and God will I am convinced now where exact that there'll be no man handling of God's bride I am convinced that God has to have enough supernatural power to mess up the mind of man and to push him aside by the currents Oh Doris [Music] [Applause] ah but-but-but look

and judges 16 27 to 30 we did informs in Luke chapter 4 Jesus returned in the power of the spirits into Galilee and they went out a theme of him through all the region round about and he taught in the synagogues being glorified of all they came to Nazareth where he had been brought up on his his custom was he went into the synagogue Sawadee instead of water read and they was delivered unto him the book of the Prophet Esaias and when he had opened the book he found the place where as written the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he had anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord he closed the book he give it again to the minister and sat down in the eyes of all them that were under synagogue were fastened on him and they begin to say unto them this day is the scripture fulfilled in your ears and all their witness and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth and he said it's not his Joseph's son he said unto them ye will surely see unto me this proverb physician heal thyself whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum do also hear in the country he said verily I say unto you no prophet is accepted in his own country and I tell you of a truth many widows in Israel in the days of alas when the heaven was shut up three years and six months when great famine was taught but until none of them was Elias sent sieve on to Sarepta city of Sidon and a woman that was a widow and many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elias the prophet none of them was cleansed see the Niemen the Syrian mark 16 uniform verse 57 then go into all the world preach the gospel to every creature he that the livin is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name is shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover from them after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven sat down on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following our last scriptures from Judges chapter 16 we read from verse 27 now the houses house I was full of men and women and all the laws of the Philistines were there and they were about a roof about three thousand men and women that be held by Samson made sport and Samson call unto the Lord and said O Lord God remember me I pray thee and strengthen me I pray thee only this once o God that I may be at once avenge of the Philistines of my two eyes and Samson took a whole of the two middle pillars upon the house where the house stood and on which there was borne up a wooden one with unfinished right hand the other with his left and Samson said let me die before these lines and he bowed himself with all his might and the house fell upon the Lord's and upon the people the padorin so the dead which he slew in his death to put more than D which is new in his life may God bless his wood you may be seated oh praise the name of the Lord our title this morning the bride's Reviver the bride's Reviver all

believe we are at the end you could speak to the people you could put a Billy Graham in every city in the United States they will drink whiskey smoke cigarettes laugh at you they are in the spirit of the last days yes partner and God cannot send destruction before the people are in the spirit for destruction I think that would reason again God cannot send destruction before the people are in the spirit of destruction so therefore the people have to get in the spirit before destruction cut it please it happened lesser countries that America manages seem very the same thing you know it's not

America asking for prayers and different ones and believers and churches but so affected were you complaining about what what you're complaining about you need a rebuke if you have one complaint here in China that I said I said I believe that but the Prime Minister I come and coat the eyes a script over the country she's gone shut yourself inside until the pity party might be only man and
