[32:41] Lord
[32:43] amen
[32:45] and what a series of services we've been
[32:48] having you appreciate the service from
[32:50] Sunday
[32:53] [Applause]
[32:55] message after message
[32:57] we've been getting if you have your
[32:59] Bibles I'd like you to tune with me to
[33:03] a very familiar scripture
[33:06] reading from the book of Ephesians
[33:08] reading from chapter six verses 11 to
[33:11] 17.
[33:19] and it says
[33:21] Ephesians 6 from 11 it says put on the
[33:25] whole armor of God
[33:26] that he may be able to stand against The
[33:29] Wiles of the devil
[33:31] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[33:33] blood but against principalities against
[33:36] Powers against the rulers of the
[33:39] darkness of this world against spiritual
[33:42] wickedness in high places wherefore
[33:45] take unto you the whole armor of God
[33:48] that he may be able to withstand in the
[33:50] evil day and have having done all to
[33:52] stand stand therefore having your loins
[33:55] Goods about with truth and having on the
[33:57] breastplate of righteousness and your
[34:00] feet shot with the preparation of the
[34:01] gospel of peace above all taking the
[34:04] shield of faith wherewith you shall be
[34:07] able to quench all the fiery darts of
[34:09] the wicked and take the helmet of
[34:11] salvation and the sword of the spirit
[34:12] which is the word of God
[34:14] let me just bar heads once more father
[34:16] we pray that you have bless the word
[34:18] that we just read Lord Lord I pray that
[34:20] you would take full control everything
[34:22] that is said everything that is done
[34:23] Lord Lord may be careful to give you all
[34:25] the praise all the honor and all the
[34:27] glory may we have such an atmosphere of
[34:29] worship and praise and adoration to you
[34:31] knowing that it's just by your grace we
[34:33] are here Lord Lord and you are able to
[34:36] do above and and and and exceedingly
[34:39] above what we could ask or think Lord I
[34:41] pray that you would move throughout this
[34:43] place tonight in Jesus name we pray amen
[34:46] you may have your seats
[34:48] and just for a contact I read that
[34:50] scripture there
[34:51] and
[34:53] just as I begin
[34:59] I want to ask you to pray for me because
[35:01] the thought I have here I hope that God
[35:03] just put everything together like a
[35:05] puzzle and it don't make sense amen you
[35:09] know I just want to lay down some facts
[35:11] before we begin
[35:12] things we already know but just want to
[35:15] reiterate
[35:16] the devil isn't trying to play fair
[35:19] he isn't playing games
[35:21] he isn't trying a thing
[35:24] he knows what he's about he's he's out
[35:26] there to steal to kill to destroy to
[35:29] brutalize to to abuse to do what he can
[35:32] to Snuff you out to kill your potential
[35:35] before you could achieve what God may
[35:37] have set in your heart to accomplish and
[35:39] if he could do that he'll be very happy
[35:41] so it's our duty it's our job it's our
[35:44] responsibility to ensure that that
[35:45] cannot happen and we don't become a
[35:48] statistic of the devil amen as such read
[35:51] the scripture where we are we are
[35:52] admonish and encourage you put on the
[35:54] whole arm our God because we're in a
[35:56] battle it's a war we're not here to play
[35:59] games we're not here to just talk and
[36:00] fellowship and have a good time and
[36:02] shake hands and go back home we here
[36:04] because it's business it's serious
[36:06] like I say he's not playing games amen
[36:09] once we understand that and we have that
[36:11] as a context it should speak to the kind
[36:13] of attitude that we must have it must
[36:15] speak to the kind of responsibility we
[36:17] have to ensure that we know what we are
[36:19] about there is nobody that could could
[36:22] say they entertain a war entertain a
[36:23] battle entain a challenge and they do
[36:25] understand the adversary don't
[36:27] understand the enemy don't understand
[36:29] what to expect and whatever swear of
[36:31] life you look at if you look at sports
[36:33] if you look at education if you look at
[36:34] the military wherever you look you have
[36:38] to be able to gauge where you are the
[36:40] resources you have and what the enemy
[36:42] might look like and if you know what
[36:43] that is you could know how to stand how
[36:46] to oppose how to attack how to defend
[36:48] how to adjust amen and that's the
[36:51] context in which you want to look here
[36:52] and I'll give you my title one time it
[36:54] says
[36:55] as a title of after training is
[36:58] completed
[37:00] because yes we talk about being in a
[37:04] battle but this battle is not a Vegas
[37:07] haphazard random sporadic thing say go
[37:10] and fight no
[37:12] we have to be trained we have to be
[37:14] tutored we have to know what we have and
[37:17] how we want to approach the battle
[37:19] that's the only way I'll get the victory
[37:21] so for title after training is completed
[37:24] and for subject I have the test is
[37:26] coming
[37:27] so no matter what you do
[37:30] the test coming
[37:32] whether you decide to do the training
[37:34] halfway
[37:36] where they decide to not do the training
[37:38] at all this test still coming
[37:40] it's not up to you the tests coming
[37:42] because it tests is predestinated to
[37:45] come it's your duty to prepare for it
[37:47] amen
[37:50] so with that background I did a little
[37:52] research I'm not a military man but I
[37:55] did a little research into how they
[37:57] operate within the military and
[37:59] according to the institute for defense
[38:01] analyzes and the defense technical
[38:04] information center they add this to
[38:06] share and I want to share it with you
[38:07] tonight
[38:08] it says military training means definite
[38:11] but very different things to different
[38:13] people
[38:14] to the commander of a military unit it
[38:17] means exercising troops in the field or
[38:19] Sailors at sea so that they operate as
[38:22] an integrated coordinated unit to
[38:26] military personnel
[38:28] the personal managers rather it means
[38:30] preparing and certifying individuals
[38:32] across a full spectrum of Occupational
[38:35] Specialties that include Cooks Dog
[38:38] Handlers tank turret repairers radar
[38:41] technicians and fighter pilots so it's
[38:44] different categories of workers
[38:46] different categories of stuff different
[38:48] skill sets different areas of
[38:50] specialization and it says to develop
[38:53] to developers and providers of major
[38:56] military systems it means exercises
[39:00] performed in simulators or on the
[39:03] systems themselves to all concerned it
[39:06] means preparing individuals from a
[39:09] civilian Society to perform as
[39:11] professional military personnel why is
[39:14] this important to us because it goes to
[39:17] show it doesn't matter who you are where
[39:20] you are you could be a cook you could be
[39:22] handling the dogs you could be a fighter
[39:24] pilot you could be flying jets you still
[39:26] need to be trained you still need to
[39:28] operate with a certain level of rules
[39:30] you still need to to be able to to be
[39:33] disciplined you still need to understand
[39:35] instructions and know when to attack and
[39:37] when to retreat when to defend and when
[39:40] like like we had here in Trinidad let's
[39:42] say attack with full force you need to
[39:44] know when to to do that right and it
[39:47] goes to show this is not my words this
[39:49] is not my description this is something
[39:52] that the military you uses they want to
[39:55] convert civilians or what people talk
[39:57] lay persons into military professionals
[40:00] or military personnel
[40:03] it goes on and it says and you know I'm
[40:06] reminded every time you go through the
[40:08] airport you see immigration Customs I
[40:11] think TSA officers also and oftentimes
[40:14] you look at some of them and you wonder
[40:16] how old you're really operating because
[40:18] you see one guy
[40:20] but he have about three guns he have two
[40:22] knives a battle two radios
[40:24] walkie-talkies three handcuffs God knows
[40:27] what else he has probably a clipboard
[40:29] and some
[40:30] other things as well why
[40:32] the thing is when you are trained in the
[40:35] military no matter what arm of the
[40:37] military you are trained you have to be
[40:40] prepared for anything
[40:42] even as simple as it sounds I remember
[40:44] being a Cub Scout when I was very very
[40:46] small and the motor was always be
[40:49] prepared
[40:50] because the enemy can attack at any
[40:52] point the enemy don't have a face and
[40:55] they come and say well how are you today
[40:57] you know are going to start a war with
[40:59] you know are going to enter a battle so
[41:01] what I want you to do is meet me
[41:02] tomorrow because I'm gonna bring some
[41:04] backup they do operate so they're
[41:06] looking to get the edge to get the
[41:07] advantage you're looking as they call it
[41:09] the unguided moment so you have to be
[41:12] extra prepared to be able to defend an
[41:16] attack
[41:16] amen so
[41:19] that's what we are called to do to put
[41:21] on the full arm of God and you'll see
[41:23] there are items within the Arma itself
[41:25] to defend you and their items to attack
[41:27] you're not just standing still is either
[41:30] you're moving forward or you're going
[41:32] back a little bit
[41:33] and you're strategizing how are going to
[41:35] move forward next time right with that
[41:38] said
[41:39] it goes on to say military training must
[41:42] prepare individuals listen to this to
[41:46] enter into Harm's Way they didn't say
[41:49] the train and you have to sleep home to
[41:51] stay home and watch TV and relax to
[41:53] enter into Harm's Way and perform
[41:56] physically and mentally demanding tasks
[42:00] at the highest possible levels of
[42:02] proficiency so it means after you go to
[42:05] the train training your car walk out
[42:07] halfway and say boy I went through the
[42:10] Barack so you know I do some push-ups
[42:12] there you know and I really couldn't
[42:13] figure out how how to run the five or
[42:16] ten kilometers or no but but I graduate
[42:18] it don't work so they want you to
[42:20] operate at the highest possible levels
[42:23] of proficiency it goes on to say this
[42:25] requirement may be the defining
[42:27] characteristic of military training it
[42:31] can mean the def the difference between
[42:33] life and death
[42:37] just like in the military we are called
[42:40] upon to be trained we are called to
[42:42] understand instructions and react
[42:45] accordingly to take discipline to take
[42:49] information and you know there's a
[42:52] saying that nothing is is learned until
[42:55] there's a change in Behavior because
[42:57] somebody could teach the same thing for
[42:59] years you could preach for years and if
[43:02] there's no change is not as effective as
[43:04] it could be
[43:06] when you see a behavior change and you
[43:08] realize you stand up a particular week
[43:10] your boots shine up a particular way
[43:13] your reacts a particular way your eyes
[43:16] fixed and focus a particular way they
[43:18] know you graduate you went through it
[43:22] may be tough you may feel to give up at
[43:24] times you know but they wouldn't kill
[43:25] you
[43:26] amen they know they have a set of tasks
[43:30] that are predetermined that you must go
[43:32] through because they know chances are
[43:36] enemy that coming
[43:38] with one of these things so you would
[43:41] have heard me mention earlier on some of
[43:42] them even use simulators
[43:44] or use the real thing
[43:46] because you can't just watch videos and
[43:50] then say boy are going to Warriors
[43:52] are gone
[43:54] you never hold a backpack you never hold
[43:57] somebody on your back and run with them
[44:00] you never train but you want to go in
[44:01] the battlefield
[44:03] your dogs dead
[44:04] licks for you that's that easy the devil
[44:08] could send some little minion some
[44:10] little personal and say listen take him
[44:12] out fast
[44:13] there is no no opposition right but we
[44:16] are called upon to a higher level
[44:18] we are Kings and prisoner we're not just
[44:21] standing up and if we go on no
[44:23] not without a fight and we promise the
[44:26] victory so we can't just sit down and I
[44:30] wonder how we get any Victory I wonder I
[44:32] know what's going to happen next no no
[44:33] no no no no no no we want to go through
[44:35] the training and adopt the principles
[44:39] and be able to apply it I want to give
[44:40] you a secret here
[44:42] no matter how much you train
[44:45] how much you go to school how much you
[44:47] practice on your football field
[44:50] how much you explore
[44:53] the training you go through is almost
[44:56] never the same as the real thing
[45:01] so you could hike you could run you
[45:03] could jump do a hundred push-ups your
[45:05] practice in in in in the field of of
[45:09] sport right let's say football or
[45:12] basketball they have what you call set
[45:14] pieces or set plays so the coach will
[45:17] say listen pastor this one to this one
[45:19] to this one two three three point show
[45:21] or you do this on your free kick here
[45:23] but you know in the real game it'll
[45:25] always be so because while you think
[45:27] you're doing that the person on the
[45:29] opposite side trying to escape tackle
[45:30] you they're trying to do our next move
[45:32] so often times you have to use the
[45:35] knowledge you have and apply it in a way
[45:38] that it could be useful and effective at
[45:41] that time
[45:42] if you don't train you have no tools to
[45:45] draw upon
[45:46] so think about this
[45:48] Christ was tempted right
[45:52] treat us
[45:53] imagine if Christ don't know the word
[45:56] that making sense
[45:57] how how you respond but I really hungry
[46:00] yes boy you see it turn this thing into
[46:02] bread here it's best I make some bread
[46:04] by
[46:05] no if he do have tools to draw upon you
[46:10] have nothing to use
[46:12] imagine if David didn't have stones in a
[46:15] sling he could walk around he used to
[46:18] play the harp and things so he was
[46:19] creative I have a sling it is a sling
[46:23] it's a nice sling and with this we can
[46:27] win if he'd open a stone in there
[46:29] he sing and I know
[46:34] reality is you have to know
[46:37] these are the parameters these are the
[46:40] tools these are the techniques these are
[46:42] the tactics you may not use all in the
[46:44] battle but you need to know them
[46:46] is the same with tests you know
[46:49] this is this is graduation time this is
[46:51] exam time this is test time there are
[46:54] those young children who believe school
[46:55] is forever
[46:57] you might write an SCA or csec or CXC or
[47:00] whatever stage University and you go
[47:03] through school you go through years or
[47:05] months of tuition
[47:07] and you call upon to learn a hundred
[47:09] percent of what's taught
[47:12] that whole textbook not coming for The
[47:14] Examiner
[47:16] the whole textbook will not be on the
[47:18] exam but you need to learn the whole
[47:20] thing because something in the exam
[47:22] going to come from the book
[47:24] so you need to know everything in order
[47:26] to be prepared
[47:28] likewise this is just the way it is it's
[47:31] like a parallel this is just the way it
[47:33] is we know to know we need to know the
[47:35] devices of the enemy we need to know the
[47:38] way it has come
[47:39] to where he will try to tie us up the
[47:42] way he will try to deceive us the way he
[47:44] will try to nudger a little bit you know
[47:47] so if we know those things here they
[47:50] come real good
[47:51] and even when you come good if we never
[47:53] see it before we need to apply the
[47:55] principles that we've been exposed to to
[47:57] check him
[48:00] that's not going to work on this end
[48:02] time right because we train better than
[48:04] that we are Elite group we are a
[48:07] proficient Bunch we have a high degree
[48:09] of proficiency because we've been
[48:11] trained that's the only way I could pass
[48:13] the test
[48:16] listen no matter the level of
[48:19] educational training you have done there
[48:21] comes a time when the classes are over
[48:23] no matter you could be in the military
[48:25] sometimes it's six months it's two years
[48:27] they may send you a way to do a course
[48:29] there comes a point in which they tell
[48:31] you you know what we've reach the end
[48:34] this is it I have imparted or I've
[48:37] taught or I've spoken I have broadcast
[48:39] lecturers or so this is all you need to
[48:42] know
[48:43] you really think when you walk out there
[48:45] you walk out guns blazing you need the
[48:47] battle it don't work so I know
[48:49] you finish the training
[48:53] but they tested Rich yet
[48:55] you might finish the class you finish
[48:57] your course the lecturers say listen
[48:58] well exam is next month you know
[49:02] The Examiner every chat we finish the
[49:04] syllabus
[49:05] exam come in
[49:07] it's up to you now to prepare it's up to
[49:10] you know to learn it's up to you to
[49:12] reiterate it's up to you to remind
[49:14] yourself listen hold on one plus one is
[49:16] two two plus two is four because the
[49:18] test is going to come still regardless
[49:20] the data search engine right at that
[49:23] point when you're in the test
[49:25] are just trying to cover all businesses
[49:26] while you're in the test you can't say
[49:29] boy sir didn't go through the snow
[49:33] she didn't do this with me you know
[49:35] imagine they treat me in the Army there
[49:39] and they had me running up and down but
[49:41] they prepare me for the the winter they
[49:43] prepare me no at that time too late to
[49:46] blame Messina it's too late to blame at
[49:50] that point when it matters when the
[49:51] rubber hits the road is you and your
[49:54] experience your training your faith
[49:56] keeping you you know
[50:12] no no
[50:14] you can't make excuses at that point you
[50:16] know
[50:17] you can't come and say well boy if if
[50:20] you know what I went through the
[50:22] Examiner don't know your teacher
[50:24] personally you know
[50:25] they don't know you personally you know
[50:27] The Examiner coming just to check listen
[50:31] pass it as he failed liters he passed
[50:33] away field no respect to our persons we
[50:36] don't care who your mother is who your
[50:37] father is if your grandfather might be
[50:39] the pastor you don't care about that you
[50:40] know either you pass the test or your
[50:42] fairly test and in this case the
[50:44] difference is life or death so the idea
[50:47] life no he died you know this one dies
[50:49] statistic you know next one you know
[50:51] next one no next one listen I'm reminded
[50:54] in in
[50:55] within the children of Israel that left
[50:57] Egypt over 2 million people right
[51:03] I don't know how else to say this but we
[51:05] need to make it over right
[51:06] what that says is that the rest
[51:10] would have died
[51:11] that's failure you know
[51:15] so so although they may have heard a
[51:18] word their family might have told them
[51:21] Moses would I tell them this is what to
[51:23] expect we go into the promised land have
[51:25] faith believe line upon line listen at
[51:29] the end of the day the feeling
[51:31] but listen God's so sweet God so awesome
[51:35] God so amazing
[51:38] Gardener sitting on crying boil up all
[51:41] these people all these people fail the
[51:42] test
[51:43] no he looking for people
[51:46] who have a burning desire to pass the
[51:48] test
[51:49] if you have a desire to pass the test he
[51:52] working with you
[51:54] he has no respect to a person so he he
[51:56] don't care if if you have to do the
[51:58] training over and over he don't care
[52:01] about that sometimes you have to do it
[52:03] over and over he wants to know that you
[52:05] have a burning desire to pass that test
[52:07] and if you're willing to do what it
[52:08] takes to pass a test you're willing to
[52:09] work with you regardless regardless
[52:12] right so
[52:14] when all Audi tuition is done often
[52:18] times we come to graduation time
[52:21] and also I think in the in the in the
[52:24] local context of the military or so they
[52:26] call it passing out so you finish your
[52:29] train I know you're passing out and they
[52:31] tell you you know this this batch or
[52:33] this cohort you know in your University
[52:35] use at that tomb this cohort they
[52:37] graduate yeah
[52:39] no
[52:41] if you don't pass the tests where are
[52:43] you going
[52:44] yeah do it over
[52:46] if we graduate here
[52:49] if they allow you to pass and they send
[52:51] you any Battlefield that is as good as
[52:53] them signing it that warrant you know
[52:55] if God were to say well listen you live
[52:57] and hear all you want you come and go
[52:59] however you please you just go ahead man
[53:02] that's as good as saying you fail one
[53:04] time
[53:05] you're doing how to walk on the
[53:06] battlefield you're done because you're
[53:08] not prepared to fight this battle and
[53:11] this battle is a real battle there's no
[53:13] joke thing now I read it before and I'll
[53:15] read it again this battle is not against
[53:17] flesh and blood you know this battle is
[53:19] not if I like you I don't like you or
[53:20] the past I like you're the past I don't
[53:22] like you or you like this group and you
[53:23] find this one talk to your off that is
[53:25] not the battery talking about here
[53:27] this battle is like listen
[53:29] principalities and powers and spiritual
[53:31] wickedness in high places
[53:33] I tell you the devil not making joke he
[53:36] not playing he counter to kill to steal
[53:39] to destroy to see how he could snuff out
[53:41] no tonight that's his goal that's his
[53:44] objective that's his responsibility so
[53:46] in order to overcome that you need to be
[53:49] prepared you need to be trained you need
[53:51] to come through the training and pass
[53:52] till you could reach at graduation point
[53:55] no
[53:57] When You Reach graduation I want you to
[54:00] just flow with me you know when you
[54:02] reach graduation often times this is the
[54:04] point at which the teacher does come
[54:06] back
[54:07] teacher tends to come back to graduation
[54:09] and say you know what you're the top
[54:11] student or they often use that as an
[54:13] opportunity to give you life advice or
[54:16] advice to move forward they tell you you
[54:18] know what
[54:18] you make a true boy it was toughen over
[54:21] you know you give us a little trouble
[54:23] you know but your stand the test you
[54:26] make it true
[54:27] and oftentimes they use it as a time to
[54:30] reiterate what is expected of you
[54:33] so in the military I'm not a military
[54:35] man but I could only imagine they may
[54:37] come and say listen you're among the
[54:38] best
[54:40] you are trained nobody else could
[54:42] operate the way you are you could
[54:44] operate as a one-man army or in a group
[54:46] you all militant you all could do
[54:47] anything whatever they say so it kind of
[54:50] reinforces the purpose for the tricks
[54:53] you train in at that stage
[54:55] and just so it is in the Bible when you
[54:58] look
[54:59] and you don't have to turn with me but
[55:01] in the Book of Joshua
[55:02] chapter 1 verse one to eight it goes
[55:05] like this and I know it's a familiar
[55:06] scripture but it reminded me of that
[55:09] graduation effect they say now after the
[55:11] death of Moses the servant of the Lord
[55:13] it came to pass that the Lord speak unto
[55:15] Joshua the son of nun Moses Minister
[55:17] saying Moses my servant is dead now
[55:21] therefore arise go over this Jordan thou
[55:23] and all these people unto the land which
[55:25] I do give to them to the children of
[55:28] Israel every place now this is where the
[55:30] Declaration starts at this point they
[55:33] say every place that the soul of your
[55:35] foot shall tread upon that have I given
[55:38] unto you as I I said unto Moses
[55:41] so the same thing I said unto him are
[55:43] telling you because you graduate at this
[55:45] point you're going to be assigned to do
[55:48] a battle you're already went through the
[55:50] training so I do expect you to come and
[55:52] say but but but Moses said tell tell me
[55:55] exactly what I'm supposed to do here no
[55:59] no no no no no no this is not the point
[56:01] that's which you make excuses this is
[56:03] graduation time so we come now and we
[56:05] say from the Wilderness and this Lebanon
[56:07] even onto the Great River the river
[56:09] Euphrates all the line of the Hittites
[56:12] and onto the great sea towards the going
[56:13] on of the sun shall be your Coast there
[56:15] shall not any man be able to stand
[56:17] before the holidays of your life because
[56:19] you're trained so no man could stand
[56:21] before your holidays of your life as I
[56:24] was with Moses so I will be with thee so
[56:26] I'll I'll be in the background I'm
[56:28] watching you because I know you took the
[56:30] training and you graduate now you're
[56:32] qualified to go on the battlefield amen
[56:34] so it says as I was at Moses so I will
[56:37] be with thee I will not fail thee nor
[56:39] forsake thee be strong
[56:43] because there are times when you might
[56:45] feel weak but I want you to be strong so
[56:47] I said this is where they encourage you
[56:49] they come and tell you listen you could
[56:51] do this you have this you're trained
[56:54] you're qualified you're certified you
[56:56] could go out and represent but I want to
[56:58] remind you of these things in case you
[57:00] forget it says in verse 6 be strong and
[57:03] have a good courage For unto this people
[57:05] shall thou divide for an inheritance the
[57:08] land which I swear unto their fathers to
[57:10] give them only be thou strong and very
[57:13] courageous so this is second time so in
[57:15] case you forgot the first time listen
[57:17] focus and pay attention you know I want
[57:19] you to be strong and very courageous
[57:21] that thou mayest observe to do according
[57:24] to all the law which Moses my seven
[57:26] commanded thee turn not from it to the
[57:29] right hand or to the left that thou
[57:31] mayest Prosper with with us whoever thou
[57:34] goest
[57:35] now it goes on in verse 8 and I want to
[57:37] slow down to read this one this book of
[57:40] the law shall not depart out of thy
[57:42] mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein
[57:45] day and night that thou must observe to
[57:49] do according to all that is written
[57:52] therein
[57:53] for then Thou shalt make thy will
[57:56] prosper us and then thou shall have good
[57:59] success
[58:01] so listen this is this is the blueprint
[58:04] this is the guide so this is listen
[58:06] you're already trained you're qualified
[58:08] you're certified and I'm about to
[58:10] release you right so at graduation
[58:12] that's what what happens so you go
[58:14] through five years of schooling or three
[58:15] years or however long
[58:18] no matter what field of endeavor you're
[58:20] in at that stage you tell you listen to
[58:22] your goddess you've been through this
[58:24] we've gone through the course with you
[58:25] you've graduated you've passed the test
[58:27] so at this stage we want you to go out
[58:28] and succeed we want you to conquer we
[58:31] want you to apply everything that you've
[58:32] learned and we want you to be a blessing
[58:34] to people we want you to conquer and
[58:36] overcome and get a victory because
[58:38] that's what you're trained to do you
[58:39] have the tools you have the techniques
[58:41] you have
[58:42] colleagues and and everybody around
[58:44] there you have all the elements of
[58:46] success all you have to do is go forth
[58:48] and do it that's what's what's going on
[58:50] here and we know what happened now at
[58:53] the same time I want to just shift gear
[58:54] I guess a little bit and I alluded to it
[58:56] early on
[58:57] with respect to David
[59:00] often times and I said when you train
[59:03] no matter how long you train
[59:06] the test may not be exactly as you train
[59:09] so in academic tests they call it
[59:11] practice tests or mock exams so they
[59:14] will bring practice tests and mock exams
[59:15] and they tell you this this like this I
[59:17] think at least School a long time right
[59:19] and when they do that you do that on
[59:22] your aceit man you come out your head
[59:24] held high your chest up on your hey I
[59:26] got this but you know when the real exam
[59:28] comes it's not the same questions
[59:30] is different
[59:32] it might be similar but it's not the
[59:34] same you know I I'm reminded of late
[59:38] brother Knights when I when I got my
[59:40] driver's license
[59:41] the day I got my license he was the
[59:44] officer doing the test and my foot
[59:46] shaking I was nervous and I driving and
[59:48] at a balancing clutch on the thing when
[59:50] I was done you know what he said he said
[59:53] he have a good one
[59:55] you get your license today
[59:57] no I want you to go and practice and
[59:58] learn to drive
[1:00:00] right no the reason he said that is
[1:00:03] because you get a license which is
[1:00:05] certifying that you could be on the road
[1:00:07] but but that don't mean your
[1:00:10] professional your cargo on the race yet
[1:00:11] you know because I often say who does
[1:00:14] teacher to drive any night they don't do
[1:00:16] driving school any nighttime who does
[1:00:18] teacher to drive any rain they don't do
[1:00:20] Driving School in the rain and I'm sure
[1:00:22] there are other new answers so just like
[1:00:24] that in life
[1:00:27] God will come and say listen hear water
[1:00:30] you see that dear
[1:00:32] I want you to watch
[1:00:34] it more you see that one over there he
[1:00:37] may not read and spell everything but he
[1:00:39] gave a diseasement he gave you a
[1:00:41] training he gave you tools he gave you
[1:00:44] his word he gave you his guidance so
[1:00:46] when you go out into the workplace you
[1:00:48] can tell
[1:00:49] when your boss seems to turn against you
[1:00:52] or co-workers talk about you or whatever
[1:00:55] this scenario is that's just a testament
[1:00:58] just a test
[1:00:59] I've been preparing parents for a long
[1:01:01] time so don't feel big people like you
[1:01:03] and your neighbors say good morning
[1:01:04] every morning that everything cool and
[1:01:06] that he's anxiety because from time to
[1:01:09] time
[1:01:09] listen they are assigned to challenge
[1:01:12] you know they assign the testing they
[1:01:15] are assigned to see if those virtues
[1:01:17] living in Europe why they tell you add
[1:01:19] to your faith virtual knowledge and
[1:01:21] Temperance and patience and godliness
[1:01:23] and probably guys and we've been taught
[1:01:24] that those virtues will be tested so we
[1:01:28] can't find it strange and be surprised
[1:01:30] when but yes yo this one talk to me
[1:01:33] I I thought we were friends I thought we
[1:01:36] better than that no it's just a test but
[1:01:39] you prepared for that we train and day
[1:01:41] in day out meditating day in day out so
[1:01:45] we'll have good success that's why
[1:01:47] you're doing it
[1:01:49] in David's case
[1:01:51] same way the training is
[1:01:54] exact replication of what is to come
[1:01:57] it's almost like a template it's a guide
[1:02:00] you still have to apply the principles
[1:02:02] and the concepts right so David playing
[1:02:05] as happy
[1:02:06] singing and he's taking care of the
[1:02:08] sheep and this is what he does and he at
[1:02:10] ease inside and he doing his thing
[1:02:12] and a bear came a lion came
[1:02:15] he defeated them
[1:02:17] let me read it there's a there's a
[1:02:20] message but Abraham spoke
[1:02:22] a personal experience with God
[1:02:25] from paragraph 18.
[1:02:26] it says Saul found out that the
[1:02:29] ecclesiastical vest of Soul didn't fit a
[1:02:31] man of God
[1:02:33] and so it waited him down that's what
[1:02:35] the trouble with a lot of men today as I
[1:02:38] meet as I cross the land men of great
[1:02:40] standing in high churches and Things
[1:02:42] They believe this message of Deliverance
[1:02:44] they believe the message of the Lord
[1:02:46] Jesus and his power but they're so
[1:02:48] Shackled down with church denominations
[1:02:49] till they can't see no further than the
[1:02:52] church
[1:02:54] they won't let them any further what we
[1:02:57] need today is somebody to step out with
[1:02:59] some experience with a slingshot like
[1:03:01] David David had David said I don't know
[1:03:04] nothing about your theology you know and
[1:03:06] about these swords and so forth but your
[1:03:09] servant with this slingshot I had an
[1:03:12] experience out there that God let me
[1:03:14] kill a lion with it and kill her bear
[1:03:16] with it and if you let me kill a lion
[1:03:18] with it she surely that uncircumcised
[1:03:21] Philistine belongs to me this afternoon
[1:03:23] God give us some more Ruddy boys with
[1:03:26] that kind of Ruddy experience that'll
[1:03:28] take God at his word and believe him for
[1:03:30] everything he says is the truth amen
[1:03:32] that's what we need tonight my dear
[1:03:35] Christian friends and now I want you to
[1:03:37] notice he went out and proved exactly
[1:03:39] that God was with him because he had an
[1:03:42] experience that God could deliver the
[1:03:44] enemy into his hand by his slingshot
[1:03:47] David didn't care if it was a bear a
[1:03:50] lion a raccoon a spider whatever come
[1:03:52] his confidence was in God's ability to
[1:03:56] deliver him with his slingshot so once
[1:03:59] you see enemy are wrong it didn't matter
[1:04:00] what they look like remember I say
[1:04:02] you're trained for this when you train
[1:04:04] it don't matter who if the enemy coming
[1:04:06] from the north south east west day time
[1:04:08] night time it don't matter if it's if
[1:04:10] it's more looking like more for them
[1:04:12] boys
[1:04:16] Victory but he gave any tools he gave
[1:04:19] her the training and responsibility so
[1:04:21] you have to show up we often preach that
[1:04:25] that David spin in his sling
[1:04:28] you think he at the time you take listen
[1:04:30] I want you to spot me take a binoculars
[1:04:32] and see the distance that giant is
[1:04:35] check the wind speed David was not
[1:04:37] sniper
[1:04:39] he was trained but he was last night but
[1:04:41] he had confidence that listen you see
[1:04:44] the God I serve the God I serve could
[1:04:46] take the sling on me this sling is
[1:04:49] almost like the extension of me and if I
[1:04:51] serve God the way I serve God he able to
[1:04:54] deliver bear lion giant elephant
[1:04:58] whatever the opposition is he able to
[1:05:01] deliver me with my slingshot does the
[1:05:03] confidence he have and as a confidence
[1:05:05] we need to have in God that listen we
[1:05:07] defeat any devil anytime anywhere any
[1:05:10] place under any condition he will be
[1:05:13] defeated he will be conquered because we
[1:05:15] train for this amen
[1:05:21] I don't want to keep it too long but
[1:05:24] I just want to shift a little bit more
[1:05:26] you know there are some disciples I
[1:05:28] really admire this is disciples you know
[1:05:31] I'll tell you what I admire about them
[1:05:32] these disciples Walk With Jesus you know
[1:05:35] the real guy don't know they walk with
[1:05:36] Jesus for three and a half years Peter
[1:05:38] and all these fellas Walk With Jesus for
[1:05:41] three and a half years so if there was
[1:05:42] anybody seeking evidence is these fellas
[1:05:46] even despise the spies went out and came
[1:05:49] back
[1:05:49] so they brought evidence right but these
[1:05:52] fellas were walking with the evidence
[1:05:54] they're walking with God Walking With
[1:05:57] Jesus every day so they could see when
[1:05:59] he he sick and you raise it dead and you
[1:06:02] tell them listen give me a little space
[1:06:03] I want all the unbelief out
[1:06:06] just just bring some bread for this girl
[1:06:08] and she arose right so they are custom
[1:06:12] seeing these things that was really
[1:06:15] you know they have something we call on
[1:06:18] the job training that's what they had
[1:06:20] they had the ultimate on the job
[1:06:22] training because they're walking with
[1:06:24] Christ every day talking with Christ so
[1:06:27] they could see the manifestation they
[1:06:28] could see the challenges the problems
[1:06:30] they could see God passed this one but
[1:06:33] you bypassed this one but something draw
[1:06:35] him to this one and this was the result
[1:06:37] so they saw full sun so I say that to
[1:06:40] say
[1:06:41] that if it's anybody should have real
[1:06:44] Faith as these disciples
[1:06:46] because they have all the evidence
[1:06:48] they have a life on the job itself it's
[1:06:51] not somebody tell them is from before
[1:06:54] and listen my grandfather tell me a
[1:06:56] virgin shall conceive in one be I see it
[1:06:58] yet I'll be waiting on the promise no
[1:07:00] they weren't waiting like that at that
[1:07:01] time they were walking with the
[1:07:04] manifestation of the promise live on
[1:07:08] hand so with that
[1:07:11] I want to read a simple or I should say
[1:07:14] a short quote from questions and answers
[1:07:16] right but I was talking about conversion
[1:07:20] but it's he speaks of Peter he said no
[1:07:23] to make this efficient
[1:07:25] Jesus said to Peter who had also
[1:07:27] followed him for three and a half years
[1:07:29] and in the Book of Matthew the 10th
[1:07:31] chapter Jesus gave Peter power against
[1:07:34] unclean spirits to go out and cast them
[1:07:37] out to healistic and to preach the
[1:07:40] gospel he had power to do this so I
[1:07:43] don't want you to look surprised Jesus
[1:07:45] give him power to do these things
[1:07:48] and in Saint John 17 17 Jesus Sanctified
[1:07:51] Peter through the truth
[1:07:53] said the word was the truth and he was
[1:07:56] the word and then at before Pentecost he
[1:07:59] said after you're converted and
[1:08:01] strengthen your breath your brethren
[1:08:03] you are only taking steps to conversion
[1:08:06] as you believe and are acting right so
[1:08:09] what we could glean from that and what
[1:08:10] we could see from that and we could hear
[1:08:12] from that is that Jesus gave Peter power
[1:08:14] to do particular things
[1:08:16] he was walking with Jesus Jesus said
[1:08:18] Peter hear what you have power to do x y
[1:08:22] z
[1:08:22] I give you that power right so you know
[1:08:25] what you are the tools you're trained
[1:08:27] you walk with me you see how it's done
[1:08:29] you see how we can do it you know what's
[1:08:31] possible so you have faith you could
[1:08:33] believe
[1:08:33] now in Acts chapter 3 you don't have to
[1:08:36] find it
[1:08:37] just a few verses there
[1:08:41] um is it no Peter and John you know it
[1:08:43] they went up together into the temple at
[1:08:46] The Hour of Prayer being the ninth hour
[1:08:48] and a certain man lame from his mother's
[1:08:51] womb was carried whom they had laid
[1:08:53] daily
[1:08:54] at the Gate of the temple which is
[1:08:56] called Beautiful to ask arms of them
[1:08:59] that entered into the temple so he was
[1:09:02] placed there every day
[1:09:03] somebody placed him there every day to
[1:09:06] beg people who are walking into the temp
[1:09:09] temple so you're begging these Saints as
[1:09:10] they're going daily so what's a ritual
[1:09:13] it was something that you do you grow
[1:09:14] accustomed that you know what this is
[1:09:16] what I do to take me out here and I beg
[1:09:19] I go back home they bring it back
[1:09:20] tomorrow and I beg and go back home no
[1:09:24] more living that's what he was doing
[1:09:25] every day same thing
[1:09:27] and it went honestly
[1:09:29] who's seeing Peter and John about to go
[1:09:33] in the temple ask an arms so they were
[1:09:37] not exempt although they were walking
[1:09:39] with Christ
[1:09:40] they will ask us
[1:09:42] give me five dollars give me twenty
[1:09:45] dollars I know there's also plenty these
[1:09:46] days right so they were not exempt from
[1:09:49] from that so they were asked
[1:09:51] and Peter it goes on in verse 4 and say
[1:09:53] and Peter fastening his eyes upon him
[1:09:56] with John
[1:10:04] look at what I'm about to tell you look
[1:10:06] at what I'm about to do because you
[1:10:08] season one change I've been trained in
[1:10:11] here for a long time but Jesus not not
[1:10:14] here right now on my own
[1:10:17] so I go in and show you based on the
[1:10:19] tools and resources that I have power
[1:10:22] that was given to me I gonna express it
[1:10:24] no because I can right no
[1:10:28] Jesus wasn't behind them saying you see
[1:10:30] that guy there try it out on him
[1:10:33] no but they were trained right so
[1:10:37] it goes on to say in verse 5 and he gave
[1:10:40] heed unto them expect him to receive
[1:10:43] something of them so no problem you call
[1:10:45] me you acknowledge me yeah yeah already
[1:10:50] I'm willing to receive
[1:10:53] and Peter said in verse six Silver and
[1:10:56] Gold Have I None but such as I have give
[1:11:00] I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ of
[1:11:03] Nazareth rise up and walk
[1:11:05] and then it's more significant what he
[1:11:07] did after in verse 7 and he took him by
[1:11:10] the right hand and lifted him up and
[1:11:12] immediately his feet and ankle bones
[1:11:16] receive strength
[1:11:18] and he leaping up stood and walked and
[1:11:21] entered with them into the temple
[1:11:23] walking and leaping and praising God so
[1:11:26] this was the application of the training
[1:11:29] and the tools that they received so this
[1:11:32] goes to show
[1:11:35] just like
[1:11:36] Ebel
[1:11:38] and Kane when God said do as a brother
[1:11:42] you'll get the same blessing
[1:11:43] it goes to show the training is there
[1:11:47] Jesus was walking with them
[1:11:49] teaching them guiding them
[1:11:52] but there Comes A Time In which
[1:11:54] you're on your own
[1:11:57] you can't walk out walk behind you the
[1:11:59] pastor can't follow you to work
[1:12:01] we're not going to say I wonder if he
[1:12:03] behave good you read the Bible today
[1:12:05] you're singing out with this song
[1:12:07] yesterday no no no no no no at the end
[1:12:09] of the day when you are trained and
[1:12:11] you're prepared you're on your own
[1:12:13] but you have the tools so when called
[1:12:16] upon to act you have to be able to
[1:12:18] manifest that you have to be able to to
[1:12:20] to perform at that stage and they say
[1:12:24] you will be trained and you should have
[1:12:25] a high degree of proficiency so we're
[1:12:28] not halfway and well I I was one of them
[1:12:31] used to walk with Jesus you know but you
[1:12:33] know I never really tried that that
[1:12:35] healing thing I don't know if if it
[1:12:37] might work no no no no no the confidence
[1:12:39] he had is that Peter looked onto him and
[1:12:41] said listen
[1:12:42] look on us
[1:12:44] Focus here
[1:12:46] I don't have money right now however
[1:12:48] what I have are going to give you
[1:12:51] and he'll lift him up
[1:12:53] and immediately
[1:12:56] healing
[1:12:57] immediately he was able to leap and jump
[1:13:00] and go in the temple and worship he
[1:13:02] didn't just sit down he didn't just
[1:13:04] stand up and say well thanks
[1:13:07] well you know that was good to know
[1:13:10] this is somebody who overcame they say
[1:13:12] he was lame from birth from his mother's
[1:13:15] womb so for however old he was he was
[1:13:18] doing this all the time every day but
[1:13:21] here it is because somebody was trained
[1:13:24] you could have reach out to somebody
[1:13:26] else it kind of reminds me of going
[1:13:29] after the lost and and and and your
[1:13:32] family that backslidden because you
[1:13:34] trained you could reach out to them and
[1:13:37] you could cry out for them you could
[1:13:39] really stand the gap on their behalf
[1:13:42] without them but you trained you have
[1:13:45] the tools you have the resources right
[1:13:47] now
[1:13:50] you know
[1:13:53] in our time
[1:13:55] brother Branham actually identified the
[1:13:57] same scripture
[1:13:58] he used the same scripture and he broke
[1:13:59] it down and I want to break it down the
[1:14:02] way he did
[1:14:03] he said
[1:14:04] and
[1:14:11] in the message the greatest battle ever
[1:14:13] thought because we're in a battler
[1:14:17] in the greatest battle ever fourth
[1:14:21] paragraph 326. he says no what did he
[1:14:25] say here now listen closely
[1:14:27] finally my brethren be strong in the
[1:14:29] Lord and the power of His might be
[1:14:32] strong in the power of His might put on
[1:14:34] the whole armor of God and
[1:14:37] that you may be able to stand against
[1:14:39] The Wiles of the devil rather Trulia for
[1:14:42] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[1:14:45] shooting bullets and cut with knives see
[1:14:48] that's not it
[1:14:49] so I'm not fighting you
[1:14:52] don't fight in me this is not what it's
[1:14:54] about but against principalities against
[1:14:57] Powers against the rulers of Darkness of
[1:14:59] this world the rulers of Darkness who
[1:15:02] rules the world the devil
[1:15:05] certainly who is all these things going
[1:15:08] on all these ungodly things going on
[1:15:10] around through here and these
[1:15:12] governments and so forth It's all the
[1:15:14] devil the Bible said so
[1:15:17] I'm not making this up
[1:15:19] these are not my thoughts
[1:15:21] now I just want to jump down to
[1:15:22] paragraph three three one and it says
[1:15:24] now listen All You Soldiers now just
[1:15:27] before we start the prayer line take
[1:15:29] unto you unto you the whole not just
[1:15:32] part of it the whole armor of God that
[1:15:35] you may be able to withstand an evil day
[1:15:37] that's the day we're living in and
[1:15:39] having done all to stand stand amen get
[1:15:42] that see honey and he speaks to a sick
[1:15:45] sister you say when you have done all

[1:16:34] of Faith wherewith you shall be able to
[1:16:36] quench all the fiery darts of the wicked
[1:16:39] and take the helmet of salvation that's
[1:16:42] the soul the mind the mind in there the
[1:16:46] mind in here the head covers over the
[1:16:48] head and the sword of the spirit which
[1:16:51] is the word of God how you're going to
[1:16:53] let this helmet what it does it's a
[1:16:55] protection

[1:17:03] iron a brass comes from God

[1:17:10] knowledge of knowing this and my healing
[1:17:13] comes from God my salvation comes from

[1:17:29] that then go marching forward oh now now

[1:19:39] every time Satan throws anyone unto you
[1:19:44] God's Army is here to cast them out amen
[1:19:46] cast out
[1:19:48] you know as the musicians could get
[1:19:50] ready to come forward
[1:19:52] on to the final quote
[1:19:54] you know
[1:19:56] and in a message who has believed our
[1:19:59] report
[1:20:03] say now after all we've said now
[1:20:06] somebody that's really fundamental what
[1:20:08] are those people won't have tried it see
[1:20:12] God does things sometimes that's not in
[1:20:14] the scope that he's written in the Bible
[1:20:17] remember you're trained you go through
[1:20:20] the course you go where there's
[1:20:22] University or wherever and you believe
[1:20:24] you know what I do a management degree
[1:20:25] so I walk out tomorrow I should be a
[1:20:28] manager no
[1:20:29] there are things that's good you're
[1:20:31] going to encounter that you're not ready
[1:20:33] yet you're not ready for us yet right so
[1:20:36] sometimes you have to go and things are
[1:20:37] outside of the scope of what you learn
[1:20:39] but you need to apply the principles
[1:20:40] you'll have learned to this scenario and
[1:20:43] then you'll make it true then you can
[1:20:44] get a victory then he could overcome and
[1:20:46] they could say Hey you make it
[1:20:48] because he said listen you don't want to
[1:20:50] be an educated fool you don't want to
[1:20:53] train train and when it's battle time
[1:20:55] you train too much you're not sure your
[1:20:57] head from your toe your car apply any of
[1:20:59] it right
[1:21:01] so
[1:21:03] in this case you say listen there are
[1:21:05] things that may not even be in the scope
[1:21:06] that's that that is written in the Bible
[1:21:09] you believe that the Bible is a
[1:21:11] blueprint sure enough but what if when
[1:21:13] Peter passed through the gate called
[1:21:15] beautiful or I mean Jesus at the pool of
[1:21:17] Bethesda or if those people there said
[1:21:20] no wait go back in the Old Testament and
[1:21:23] show me where there's a scripture that
[1:21:25] that's an angel
[1:21:26] that's psychology that's nothing but
[1:21:28] just the wind so they they making their
[1:21:31] assumptions and want to put that out on
[1:21:34] Jesus and say you know is he wind
[1:21:36] blowing around the world there in the
[1:21:39] pool so when you think the angel
[1:21:41] Troubled Water is really the breeze
[1:21:43] that's what he's saying here
[1:21:46] that's what's doing that but the people
[1:21:48] believe there was an angel do you
[1:21:50] believe it was
[1:21:51] but it wasn't written in the scripture
[1:21:53] what if them laying in the shadow of
[1:21:55] Peter and every one of them getting
[1:21:57] healed what if somebody said no wait a
[1:21:59] minute
[1:22:01] now wait a minute show me that in the
[1:22:04] scripture where they lay in the shadow
[1:22:05] of a man Paul taking the handkerchief so
[1:22:08] apron says from his body somebody say oh
[1:22:11] show me that in scripture where it's
[1:22:13] going to be it wasn't in the scripture
[1:22:15] but God did it anyhow
[1:22:18] is that is that right he rewards you of
[1:22:22] your faith and it still comes back there
[1:22:24] to your faith that's what it is your
[1:22:27] faith whatever you want to do that's it
[1:22:30] you know so so he is going to take you
[1:22:32] carry through the training which you
[1:22:35] need to pass
[1:22:36] in order to face the battle
[1:22:38] because Devil in a plane the test
[1:22:42] comments still the date Not Gonna Change
[1:22:44] to accommodate you and the examiner
[1:22:47] don't know you personally he donate a
[1:22:49] father or mother or Uncle you don't care
[1:22:52] if he was in church two years or five
[1:22:53] years or ten years what he cares about
[1:22:56] is that you have the right answer that
[1:22:58] you can pass the test that you have the
[1:23:00] token that you have the requirement to
[1:23:02] pass the test amen God richly bless you
