[38:02] encouraged by the kangaroo's words he
[38:04] told me it blew him all the water
[38:06] he didn't expect his virtual convention
[38:08] and to see when it come in reality they
[38:10] come into the service and experience it
[38:12] i really want to salute in particular
[38:15] berna gideon here who was
[38:16] the project manager of this whole thing
[38:19] um we certainly appreciate him
[38:22] and he had that sharp feel to get the
[38:25] user experience to get what the people
[38:27] would be seeing and so on so he had that
[38:28] eye for that
[38:29] also about ian paul francis and brother
[38:32] anthony
[38:33] brother anthony ryan and also supporting
[38:37] brother nicholas
[38:38] and of course brother isaac the whole
[38:40] team that was there
[38:42] we certainly appreciate what what the
[38:44] time off and so on
[38:46] and to give you an idea you here had
[38:49] nine services
[38:51] but the reality was 20 something
[38:52] services because all had was to be done
[38:54] in french
[38:55] and spanish then uploaded and then
[38:58] streamed
[38:59] so all being streamed at the same time
[39:00] french spanish
[39:02] english so all that was done and that is
[39:05] what
[39:05] we have by gospel so we are grateful to
[39:07] god
[39:08] um we try to do our best
[39:12] because we see this kingdom this this
[39:15] kingdom i don't see
[39:17] i mean i remember the early years of my
[39:19] ministry when
[39:20] i got invites to go outside
[39:24] i didn't want to go i didn't want to go
[39:25] i felt that as a pastor
[39:27] staying with the home stay with the
[39:28] sheep and then the lord spoke to me you
[39:30] are going in the body for the body by
[39:32] the body
[39:33] and then i understand the body of christ
[39:34] which is a universal body
[39:36] it's not just this church here it's it's
[39:40] a universal body and that blood could
[39:41] flow
[39:42] through any part of that body that's the
[39:43] body of christ
[39:45] and when you begin to see the kingdom
[39:46] for what it really is your whole view of
[39:49] church and church life comes different
[39:52] so i see myself as a worker in this
[39:54] kingdom of god i want to say it again
[39:57] the kingdom of god that's why in october
[40:00] i believe was 2012.
[40:02] i was preaching in new york i said i'm
[40:04] not here to represent trinidad
[40:06] i'm not here to represent my church i'm
[40:08] here to represent the kingdom
[40:10] of the most high god and this is what
[40:13] god
[40:13] told me to say to them what i am
[40:16] representing and this is what
[40:17] all of us must represent that all of us
[40:20] supposed to represent
[40:21] god's kingdom and if you are part of
[40:24] that kingdom and you represent that
[40:25] kingdom
[40:26] you will get the support of that kingdom
[40:28] because that kingdom have a king
[40:31] that's why it's called a kingdom
[40:33] hallelujah we become
[40:35] his domain that he rules so just as but
[40:39] isaac preached so masterfully
[40:41] about the jurisdiction in heaven and on
[40:42] earth god's judicial earth
[40:45] is through his kingdom people
[40:49] because he's the god of heaven so he
[40:52] have to have
[40:53] people that he could sit on anoint
[40:56] and that's why he could tell samuel i
[40:58] found a better man
[40:59] saul messed up i found a better man
[41:02] quoted house at jesse
[41:04] and loit as one of the sons of jesse
[41:06] because i find a better man
[41:08] to replace that king called saul a man i
[41:10] could anoint
[41:11] a man that i can inspire a man that i
[41:14] could work with
[41:15] this is what god want from you he wanted
[41:17] you a woman he could anoint
[41:19] a man he couldn't anoint a daughter a
[41:21] son a husband and wife he can anoint
[41:23] for his purpose and his willingness plan

[41:28] hallelujah hallelujah you get protected
[41:32] in this kingdom

[41:43] bread in this kingdom

[42:29] you have to go back and listen to
[42:30] it is it is too much of food is this
[42:33] forget it you have to go and eat
[42:35] rest go back and eat again hallelujah
[42:38] it's just too much

[42:41] add a date to that because it's just too
[42:42] much
[42:43] it's too condensed too it's too packed

[42:48] food
[42:49] because this is spiritual food in due
[42:50] season this is juicy the food you know
[42:54] hallelujah so reading from luke chapter
[42:56] one we want to read from verse 26
[43:00] and in the sixth month the angel gabriel
[43:02] was sent from god
[43:04] and the city of galilee named nazareth
[43:06] to a virgin exposed to a man
[43:08] whose name was joseph of the house of
[43:10] david and the virgin name was mary
[43:13] an angel came unto her and said healed
[43:15] our highly fevered and the lord is with
[43:17] thee blessed the daw
[43:19] among women and when she heard him she
[43:21] was troubled
[43:22] at his sin and cast in her mind what
[43:25] manner
[43:26] of salutation there should be and the
[43:29] angel said unto her fear not mary for
[43:31] thou has found
[43:33] favor with god and behold thou shalt
[43:35] conceive in thy womb
[43:37] and bring forth a son and shall call his
[43:39] name
[43:40] jesus he shall be great
[43:44] shall be called the son of the highest
[43:46] and the lord god shall give unto him the
[43:48] throne
[43:49] of his father david and he shall reign
[43:52] over the house of jacob forever and of
[43:55] his kingdom
[43:56] there shall be no end then said mary
[43:59] unto the angel
[44:00] how shall this be seen i know not a man
[44:05] and the angel answered and said unto her
[44:07] the holy ghost
[44:09] shall come upon me and the power of the
[44:12] highest
[44:14] shall overshadow thee therefore also
[44:17] that holy thing
[44:18] which thou shalt be born of thee shall
[44:20] be called
[44:22] the son of god that's in john chapter 20
[44:25] reading from verse 19.
[44:30] then the same day at evening being the
[44:31] first day of the week
[44:33] when the doors were shut where the
[44:35] disciples were assembled for
[44:37] fear of the jews came jesus
[44:40] stood in the midst and says unto them
[44:42] peace be unto you
[44:44] and when he had so said he showed unto
[44:47] them his hands his side
[44:49] then were the disciples glad when they
[44:52] saw the lord
[44:54] and then said jesus to them again peace
[44:56] be unto you
[44:58] as my father had sent me so son are you
[45:01] and when he had said this he breathes on
[45:04] them
[45:05] and says unto them receive e the holy
[45:08] ghost let's pray father we thank you for
[45:10] your word may you come

[45:13] you put upon my heart to share with the
[45:15] people this morning

[45:18] the unction to hear
[45:20] granted lord and jesus may ask it amen
[45:22] you will be seated
[45:29] so this morning i have a title the
[45:31] dynamics
[45:32] of that promised wood
[45:36] the dynamics of that promised wood
[45:40] and of an inspiration my word shall not
[45:42] return unto me void
[45:44] that's the experience my word shall not
[45:45] return to me void and that's
[45:48] that inspiration my wish have not
[45:49] written to me void it's on isaiah 56
[45:52] you know it six eleven seek the lord
[45:54] while he may be found
[45:55] that means they're gonna come out oh you
[45:56] can't find him and call upon him while
[45:59] he is near
[46:00] let the wicked forsake his way and his
[46:02] unrighteous man his thoughts and let him
[46:04] return
[46:05] unto the lord that's not church now this
[46:08] is the lord
[46:09] and he will have mercy upon him unto our
[46:12] god
[46:12] for he will abundantly pardon for my
[46:14] torture not your torch neither your ways
[46:16] my ways here the lord
[46:18] for the heavens i hide on the earth saw
[46:20] my ways hide and your ways and my
[46:21] torches and your torch
[46:22] here we go for as the rain cometh down
[46:25] and snow from heaven
[46:26] and return it not thither but water at
[46:29] the earth
[46:30] and make it bring forth and bud that it
[46:33] may give sea to the sower
[46:35] and bread to the eater so shall
[46:39] my word be
[46:42] that goed forth out of my mouth not
[46:45] every word
[46:45] is important he's making a type as the
[46:48] rain fall
[46:49] gives sea to the sower bread to the
[46:51] eater so
[46:53] shall my word be not just word is where
[46:57] it coming from
[46:58] that go it fought out of my mouth
[47:02] hallelujah that's very important now it
[47:05] shall
[47:05] not return unto me void or empty
[47:09] but it shall accomplish that which i
[47:12] please
[47:13] and it shall prosper in the thing where
[47:15] to i
[47:16] sent it oh glory to god i feel inspired
[47:20] this morning oh glory to god because
[47:22] this word that you believe
[47:24] this word you're holding on to it cannot
[47:26] come back void
[47:28] [Music]
[47:29] it's impossible for the not to be a
[47:32] bride in trinidad
[47:34] and around the world it is impossible
[47:36] for the power of god not to strike the
[47:38] church
[47:39] that's impossible oh glory it's
[47:42] impossible for the brighton not to have
[47:43] a revival
[47:45] that is impossible because before once
[47:48] god
[47:48] speak it something has to come behind it
[47:52] to make it materialize
[47:53] [Applause]
[47:56] oh glory to god and the devil job is to
[47:59] get you to doubt
[48:00] the seed or to question the word
[48:04] ought to want a better uh uh a horizon a
[48:07] better fitting for the word that is why
[48:09] i like it
[48:10] the word that come out of my mouth no
[48:13] god mouthpiece are his prophets and god
[48:17] only had seven more peace through seven
[48:19] ages
[48:20] not 27 not 14
[48:23] just seven one two three four five six
[48:26] seven
[48:28] let me count it for you again one two
[48:30] three four five six seven
[48:32] in seven ages he only had seven
[48:35] mouthpiece
[48:36] this god we serve he called them seven
[48:39] stars
[48:40] in his right hand not 27 stars just
[48:44] seven stars
[48:46] in his right hand and we were honored
[48:49] and privileged to be in this day that
[48:52] god sent a prophet
[48:54] named william marion prana a 20th
[48:57] century
[48:58] prophet according to the scripture
[49:01] of malachi 4 behold i sent you elijah
[49:05] and god sent that prophet with a purpose
[49:08] to turn our hearts back to the faith
[49:11] that the fathers had oh glory not to
[49:15] explanation
[49:16] but to a manifestation or glory to god
[49:20] because god's sons was always supposed
[49:23] to be
[49:23] manifested beings
[49:28] that's what identifies as different from
[49:30] others
[49:31] oh glory to god you may be seated
[49:34] oh hallelujah i'm still feasting off
[49:37] that last message
[49:38] jurisdiction on heaven i'm judging on
[49:41] earth
[49:42] and jesus said all power up there
[49:45] and down here is in me and the way i
[49:49] went on to say all that was in god he
[49:51] poured into christ
[49:53] all i was in christ he now pours into
[49:55] the church
[49:57] therefore what you're binding on earth
[49:59] coming in heaven
[50:00] watching loose on earth and loose in
[50:03] heaven
[50:04] praise god we are stepping into a
[50:06] different realm altogether
[50:08] oh hallelujah praise god you know god
[50:12] longing for you to break into this level
[50:15] break into this expectation all glory to
[50:18] god
[50:18] hallelujah you will be seated you can't
[50:20] take the book as a sinner
[50:22] you have to take the book as a son you
[50:24] have to get converted from sin of the
[50:26] son
[50:27] this is not for sinners you know this is
[50:28] for sons sons who know who they are
[50:31] some who know where they come from sons
[50:34] who know where they are going
[50:35] sons who have been placed positionally
[50:38] oh glory to god
[50:40] i love it i love it i love it oh god
[50:43] this mighty cherub
[50:44] this mighty archangel once was in heaven
[50:48] no fallen he is troubled and disturbed
[50:51] by a man walking the earth with power
[50:54] given to him that he can't touch he
[50:57] could only watch
[50:59] other move mountain and until the
[51:01] streams go to the left and go to the
[51:03] right
[51:03] and satan couldn't touch such a man oh
[51:06] glory to god hallelujah
[51:09] a man of god on the earth made in god's
[51:12] image and likeness
[51:13] and you want to tell me if a man like
[51:15] that in god's image and likeness
[51:18] ruled and reigned and dominated the
[51:20] earth
[51:21] if god restores the image and likeness
[51:24] what will happen with sons of god in our
[51:26] last days
[51:27] when god was preparing us for satan's
[51:30] eden
[51:31] god was preparing us for such a time as
[51:33] this
[51:34] this battle is going on right now oh
[51:37] glory to
[51:38] god hallelujah hallelujah
[51:41] glory to god we are backing this morning
[51:43] between sickness and health
[51:45] between light and darkness or glory to
[51:48] god with your
[51:50] [Music]
[51:53] oh glory listen there's a prophecy
[51:57] hanging over the center the last days
[51:59] they're going to challenge sicknesses do
[52:02] you hear what i'm saying
[52:03] you're going to challenge diseases do
[52:05] you hear why i'm saying
[52:07] you wouldn't accept your condition you
[52:09] wouldn't accept your cancer
[52:10] your tumor your leukemia your diabetes
[52:14] your high blood pressure you will accept
[52:15] none of that
[52:19] [Music]
[52:21] [Applause]
[52:25] it's the devil's right to afflict you
[52:27] with sicknesses and disease
[52:29] it's our right to cast them out
[52:33] i wanna have a bigger show than that i
[52:35] wanna hear a bigger show than that
[52:37] devil to do what he wanna do what we
[52:39] have to do what we have to
[52:41] [Applause]
[52:42] [Music]
[52:45] and do said in my name shall cast out
[52:48] devils
[52:49] it's very interesting something but
[52:51] isaac said in the old testament you'll
[52:53] never hear one devil cast out
[52:55] the closest was david playing the harp
[52:57] to get him spirits of assault for season
[52:59] and after davidson playing after a while
[53:00] his spirit come back on soul
[53:02] so the first power of jesus released
[53:04] upon disciples is power to run devils
[53:08] what is he doing he letting them sons
[53:10] know that them devils could be subject
[53:12] to you
[53:14] the first thing he said in my name
[53:17] they shall cast out devils do i shall
[53:20] come on you sons and daughters
[53:22] the first
[53:26] if not second it's not third it's not
[53:28] fought it's the first
[53:30] they shall cast them out because he
[53:33] don't belong here
[53:36] [Music]
[53:38] oh glory to god hallelujah
[53:43] do you understand maybe seated his
[53:46] realm as an angel was up in heaven
[53:52] but he got boots and the only other
[53:56] place he got kicked out is only earth
[53:59] so he have no domain
[54:03] but the earth was made for sons
[54:06] [Music]
[54:07] [Applause]
[54:08] [Music]
[54:09] when god create everything he said there
[54:11] was nothing like him
[54:12] he said i want somebody like me on the
[54:14] earth
[54:16] let us make man in our own
[54:19] image and let them have dominion
[54:22] and god put spirit man on the earth and
[54:25] the devil couldn't touch him just watch
[54:26] him
[54:27] a son in position hallelujah a perfect
[54:31] man
[54:32] a son from god hallelujah
[54:35] but we know this story i hope and that
[54:37] somebody are repeating and it's a good
[54:38] repeat in any case
[54:40] oh glory to god but the devil when he
[54:43] saw adam he wonder how to get to his man
[54:49] i don't know how long it could be two
[54:51] years three years i don't know what time
[54:52] was unfolding that time
[54:54] a long time adam's spirit moving was a
[54:56] dust
[54:57] [Music]
[54:58] put that spirit man dust man man become
[55:01] a living soul
[55:03] i don't walk in now because he come to
[55:04] physical now he could turn to the ground
[55:06] tend to the garden speak this god gave
[55:08] him some time to know how to work and to
[55:10] work hard too
[55:12] then god bringing wife to him after he
[55:13] could work
[55:19] god gave my sleep and when he came out
[55:20] he said this is woman
[55:22] let's take another man put a label on
[55:25] eve
[55:26] things going good season just watching
[55:29] and observing
[55:31] watching and observing boy things
[55:33] looking different then he saw an opening
[55:35] when adam went to shift a mountain 36
[55:39] 20 degrees to the left
[55:42] in a northeastern position
[55:46] i'm saying a little bit so on a mountain
[55:49] doing so
[55:50] whatever i'm saying everything that will
[55:52] be
[55:53] while adam planting his garden and
[55:55] setting his
[55:57] his garden is right because i'm i want
[56:00] i want this line straighter
[56:04] why are you doing that the devil asking
[56:06] evil who will god has to
[56:07] tell earlier because he don't tell me
[56:10] nothing at all
[56:12] since i get caught things bad
[56:18] and eve in all her naive innocence
[56:22] say tell us we could eat a wally tree in
[56:23] the garden but it's in the midst don't

[56:29] surely die
[56:31] god knows god knows that tree what that
[56:34] she will do for you
[56:36] it will make you wise so the first offer
[56:40] at the earthly level was wisdom that
[56:42] that come with full knowledge
[56:45] hallelujah to break watch the word
[56:48] now that word don't eat out of that tree
[56:50] is the word from god's mouth
[56:53] that word cap got apple back that
[57:00] that would have a life in it the day you

[57:30] understand is the anointing and the
[57:32] grease and the blood is what keep you
[57:33] how you are
[57:35] and anytime you step out the dark you
[57:36] come back
[57:38] ordinary getting slapped up like the
[57:41] devil top up by the devil
[57:43] outside the doctor to get permission to
[57:45] approach you
[57:49] you ain't shouting the house especially
[57:54] in this day
[57:56] because this is the day of restoration
[57:59] shout out restoration
[58:01] god is not replacing you he's restoring
[58:03] you
[58:05] so don't say why me why not you
[58:08] to change you and to change you into
[58:10] what you're supposed to be
[58:12] [Music]
[58:20] let's read you put that little eye
[58:21] detector
[58:23] you try to impersonate the truth but
[58:25] don't inside
[58:27] you know that is you're lying talk about
[58:29] the light detector
[58:30] in the subconscious there's a place
[58:32] called the soul
[58:34] and this intellectual mind does not
[58:38] govern
[58:38] the vibration of the system
[58:42] the mind is only a director
[58:45] it will direct you and it's very
[58:48] it is in incapable of bringing you to
[58:51] god
[58:53] your mind cannot know god by your mind
[58:56] or you cannot know god by your mind or
[59:00] intellect it is just one of the
[59:03] resources or the
[59:04] channels that would lead you to it
[59:07] but your soul is what governs you
[59:10] you are what you are by your soul
[59:13] [Applause]
[59:14] [Music]
[59:16] so that is why when samuel went to
[59:18] anoint one of the sons of jesse and the
[59:20] first one
[59:21] come pass he says surely this is he he's
[59:24] tall he's handsome he looks right here
[59:26] degrees and so like that
[59:27] god said no don't watch by your senses
[59:31] however this isn't meant by your heart
[59:34] so it's not what your eyes see and when
[59:36] it all passed through because now
[59:38] he recognized he cannot go by his senses
[59:40] he had to go by the witness of the
[59:42] spirit
[59:43] that there was no witness for all them
[59:44] brothers that passed by
[59:46] and he said you have any more because
[59:49] god can lie
[59:50] if god sent me to anoint one of the sons
[59:52] of jesse
[59:53] it can have nobody with a witness it has
[59:56] to have somebody here
[59:58] to anoint god has sent me here this
[1:00:01] morning and
[1:00:02] and there is nobody here to receive the
[1:00:04] word of god if
[1:00:05] if god sent us to anoint and speak and
[1:00:08] prophesy
[1:00:10] and get delivered there must be somebody
[1:00:12] inside of here that is ordained for
[1:00:15] such a time as this and a service like
[1:00:17] this
[1:00:18] so they said do you have one more they
[1:00:20] say yes in the bush
[1:00:21] he with the sheep he he he obeyed yet he
[1:00:24] still smelly as ever
[1:00:25] she says send for him here come david
[1:00:28] david
[1:00:29] you have a clue what they set him for
[1:00:31] and as soon as david made his appearance
[1:00:33] samuel take the whole corner oil and
[1:00:35] dump it on a man
[1:00:36] the man i get baptized in jesus name the
[1:00:39] man i repent
[1:00:40] they might do nothing the man just is
[1:00:41] who he is
[1:00:43] oh glory god lord i feel like running
[1:00:45] through that troop
[1:00:46] it's not what you do is who you are oh
[1:00:49] god it's not who your mother is it's who
[1:00:51] you are oh glory to god not what your
[1:00:54] children do is who you
[1:00:55] are do you know who you are
[1:00:58] nor are we the sons of god you got to
[1:01:02] know
[1:01:02] who you are david was always a son a
[1:01:05] predestinated son
[1:01:08] oh glory to god hallelujah let me be
[1:01:11] seated here we go
[1:01:13] ah good and i think i read this last
[1:01:16] series that i preached
[1:01:18] dear brother branham what is the
[1:01:20] difference
[1:01:22] when jesus breathed on the disciples and
[1:01:24] said receiving the holy ghost
[1:01:26] when they had to go into the upper room
[1:01:28] to tarry
[1:01:30] it was he said watch uh what was the
[1:01:33] difference when jesus breathed on them
[1:01:35] receiver the holy ghost and then when
[1:01:37] they had to go in the upper monetary
[1:01:40] he said it was a promise he gave them
[1:01:43] he breathed upon them his promise
[1:01:46] so when he said receive the holy ghost
[1:01:48] they didn't get the holy ghost then
[1:01:50] what he breathed upon them was what
[1:01:52] sultan promised
[1:01:55] so that was a promised word to them
[1:01:58] [Music]
[1:01:59] [Applause]
[1:02:02] receiving your healing receiving the
[1:02:04] holy ghost
[1:02:05] receiving your deliverance receiving
[1:02:07] your breakthrough
[1:02:09] receive you the fire of god
[1:02:12] [Music]
[1:02:15] what is it a promise let's go
[1:02:19] then they went to the upper room to wait
[1:02:23] for the promise to be fulfilled
[1:02:26] and that's the same thing when we lay
[1:02:29] hands upon you to be healed
[1:02:31] then you go about your business waiting
[1:02:34] for the promise
[1:02:35] to be fulfilled oh glory to god you get
[1:02:40] prayed for
[1:02:41] i'm gonna be healed i'm gonna say that
[1:02:43] oh god you're back hurting your
[1:02:45] foot your hand whatever but you know god
[1:02:48] the word is already upon you the breath
[1:02:51] of god is over you
[1:02:52] the promises over your life
[1:02:54] [Music]
[1:02:55] [Applause]
[1:02:56] [Music]
[1:03:00] hallelujah
[1:03:02] oh so they were waiting for the promise
[1:03:06] to be fulfilled breathe upon them
[1:03:10] what the promise would and then the wait
[1:03:13] for the dynamics
[1:03:15] of that promised word to make that word
[1:03:17] manifest
[1:03:19] so don't let the devil say you don't
[1:03:20] have anything
[1:03:21] [Music]
[1:03:23] you are pregnant with promise
[1:03:26] [Music]
[1:03:27] [Applause]
[1:03:28] what's the secret the word is
[1:03:31] in the brain what word the word of
[1:03:35] promise
[1:03:36] oh glory to god so you become a target
[1:03:39] for the enemy because you just don't
[1:03:42] know who you are
[1:03:43] you have no manifestation you have no
[1:03:46] vindication
[1:03:47] you have no power you have no miracles
[1:03:49] but you are son of the king
[1:03:52] your name is on the book and you have
[1:03:55] received these promises
[1:03:57] and by these promises according to ii
[1:04:00] peter
[1:04:01] you become a partaker of the divine
[1:04:03] nature of god
[1:04:05] so this pyramid is being built into you
[1:04:08] by the word itself
[1:04:13] what are you saying preacher i am saying
[1:04:15] the pyramid word is already in you
[1:04:17] to connect with the germ that's already
[1:04:20] in you
[1:04:21] and that seed germ that's in you was now
[1:04:24] given to you
[1:04:25] you had that before the foundation of
[1:04:28] the world
[1:04:29] that path is what god was thinking in
[1:04:32] the back part of his mind
[1:04:34] before it dropping into flesh your flesh
[1:04:40] hallelujah hallelujah and only the word
[1:04:44] could bring that thought path into
[1:04:46] expression
[1:04:48] so that's why you have to hear the word
[1:04:50] oh glory to god to bring the german you
[1:04:52] into our manifestation
[1:04:54] hallelujah let's continue
[1:04:58] the holy spirit is an experience
[1:05:02] of being filled and endued
[1:05:06] with for service you don't hear much
[1:05:10] preachers talking about that
[1:05:12] power for what for service
[1:05:16] jesus the scripture he read he said as
[1:05:18] my father sent me
[1:05:31] the father that sent him went in him

[1:05:43] you see the father it is not me that
[1:05:46] with the words
[1:05:47] but the father in me
[1:05:51] he is doing the works what is he saying
[1:05:54] he said i am the word
[1:05:56] my father is spirit
[1:06:01] oh glory to god and when that same
[1:06:04] spirit comes into you

[1:09:40] that's what the prophet come to do you
[1:09:41] know to turn us back
[1:09:44] to the faith of the fathers not to the
[1:09:46] talk of the fathers you know
[1:09:48] be fair to the fathers listen jesus
[1:09:51] those disciples followed jesus for so
[1:09:53] much years three and a half years

[1:10:16] that service
[1:10:17] i didn't know what the prisoner
[1:10:21] and we know this story because they
[1:10:24] didn't have
[1:10:25] power for service yet
[1:10:29] they were given power given
[1:10:32] power power by
[1:10:36] association being associated with jesus
[1:10:40] they got power given to them including
[1:10:42] judas
[1:10:45] including judas a devil
[1:10:49] giving power with the other disciples
[1:10:53] but paul wasn't resident
[1:10:56] in them

[1:11:02] resident
[1:11:03] power artisan
[1:11:06] will power self-generation power
[1:11:11] a dynamo or dynamics

[1:14:00] where he came into the church there is
[1:14:02] where we find him
[1:14:04] because there is where the church left
[1:14:05] him here we go
[1:14:07] these greeks were not looking for a
[1:14:10] lecturer
[1:14:12] on jesus they came to disciples it says
[1:14:14] we would see jesus
[1:14:17] they wasn't looking for pulpit clones
[1:14:21] they were not looking for that they were
[1:14:23] not looking for entertainers
[1:14:25] they wanted to see him the prison
[1:14:28] jesus christ they longed to see him
[1:14:32] because they had heard of him and faith
[1:14:34] and my hearing hearing the word
[1:14:36] and he is the word and they wanted to
[1:14:38] see jesus
[1:14:40] no they never said they wanted to hear
[1:14:41] him
[1:14:43] i like that they heard about him already
[1:14:47] they didn't want to hear him on all the
[1:14:50] mysteries he was revealing
[1:14:52] they want to see the man who really
[1:14:53] mystery
[1:14:55] they want to meet the mystery himself
[1:14:57] because christ
[1:14:58] himself is the mystery
[1:15:02] of god reveal remember the word is the
[1:15:04] conduct of the spirit
[1:15:06] so the word gives a channel for the
[1:15:07] spirit to flow through
[1:15:09] if there is no word you can't get the
[1:15:10] spirit to come so he was the living word
[1:15:14] or the word made flesh so the spirit had
[1:15:16] the preeminences in him
[1:15:18] he said i do nothing unless my father
[1:15:20] show me first so the father himself
[1:15:23] and i a son always pleases my father
[1:15:26] and the father already announced this is
[1:15:28] my son in whom i'm well pleased
[1:15:31] so there was pleasing on both sides the
[1:15:33] son was praising the father
[1:15:35] and the father was very proud and please
[1:15:36] of his son and that is how the bride has
[1:15:39] to become
[1:15:40] all glory to god you please in the
[1:15:42] father and the father pleased with you
[1:15:45] and he said one day he will call you a
[1:15:47] side church if you stay with him
[1:15:49] he will call you aside and give you a
[1:15:52] power
[1:15:53] and give you something that the whole
[1:15:56] world will know
[1:15:58] god is with you do i shout in the house

[1:25:22] and no book of acts they write a book of
[1:25:24] acts

[1:25:55] [Applause]
[1:25:56] [Music]
[1:25:59] you see it
[1:26:03] give me a word preacher he said if that
[1:26:06] original tree
[1:26:09] was an orange tree right and the
[1:26:10] graphene grapefruit and lemon and
[1:26:12] tangelo and all kind of characters get
[1:26:14] grafted in the tree you say but
[1:26:16] when that tree put forth
[1:26:19] another original brand everybody
[1:26:22] important not
[1:26:23] not another branch original
[1:26:26] until the original brand shall go back
[1:26:28] to the original word
[1:26:30] original seed original life
[1:26:34] hallelujah when that seed put forth
[1:26:36] another original branch
[1:26:37] it will be a original fruit
[1:26:40] and that original fruit is what was
[1:26:43] manifested
[1:26:44] after the pentecost when peter spoke and
[1:26:47] the holy ghost was active now
[1:26:49] in suns with full sea germ in the body
[1:26:54] resident in the body
[1:26:58] what did that pentecost we're going to
[1:27:00] do that
[1:27:01] dynamics not talk
[1:27:04] not more word not more letter
[1:27:07] but the dynamics of the promised world
[1:27:12] oh glory to god so isaiah prophesied
[1:27:17] a virgin shall conceive like i was known
[1:27:20] by senses
[1:27:21] because the inspiration coming to this
[1:27:23] prophet was coming direct
[1:27:24] by passing the senses dropping into the
[1:27:27] heart
[1:27:28] and coming out the mouth if it only gets
[1:27:30] interpreted senses they get messed up
[1:27:32] you know you go question how a virginia
[1:27:33] could conceive but because it dropped
[1:27:35] from thought
[1:27:37] into heart then out his mouth that word
[1:27:40] can return void
[1:27:41] it's looking funny it's looking wrong
[1:27:45] it looking like nothing happened for
[1:27:46] hundreds of years but it's waiting for
[1:27:48] mary
[1:27:49] nothing can move till mary come that
[1:27:52] word lay in dormant
[1:27:53] dead letter but the word come out of
[1:27:55] god's mouth
[1:27:57] a virgin shall conceive that word
[1:27:59] waiting for mary to be born
[1:28:01] when mary born the worst had to jump a
[1:28:03] little bit all glory to god the word can
[1:28:05] stay quiet
[1:28:06] because mary now is on the earth to
[1:28:09] fulfill that word
[1:28:11] when mary's had to go angels are to
[1:28:13] escort mary
[1:28:15] in the spirit realm the catholic demon
[1:28:18] come and mess up mary with some contrary
[1:28:21] interpretation
[1:28:22] mary going to church marrying the gospel
[1:28:25] mary and a word
[1:28:26] a virgin shall conceive it wasn't
[1:28:28] something new to her
[1:28:29] they were preaching that it was a
[1:28:31] promised word
[1:28:33] [Music]
[1:28:35] oh give the lord a shout hallelujah one
[1:28:38] day

[1:28:47] god
[1:28:48] how many drop that promise weren't you
[1:28:50] and you had one question
[1:28:52] one question i know god said it in
[1:28:54] isaiah i know god promised it
[1:28:57] but how shall this be how shall this be
[1:29:01] i hear about transformation i hear about
[1:29:03] adoption
[1:29:04] i hear about the power of the last day
[1:29:06] church super church
[1:29:08] super race the headstone but how shall
[1:29:11] these things be
[1:29:12] he said the holy ghost the holy ghost
[1:29:16] the holy ghost the holy ghost they don't
[1:29:18] like it but it is the holy ghost they
[1:29:20] don't preach it but as the holy ghost
[1:29:22] i'm the power of the highest oh glory to
[1:29:25] god the holy ghost and power
[1:29:27] holy ghost and power holy ghost and fire
[1:29:29] they don't want to preach it
[1:29:30] they don't want to speak it but it's the
[1:29:32] same holy ghost
[1:29:34] i feel that holy ghost here this morning
[1:29:36] do you feel that holy ghost here this
[1:29:38] morning
[1:29:38] it's the holy ghost and fire it's the
[1:29:40] holy ghost and power
[1:29:42] all glory that god is keeping us alive
[1:29:44] this morning
[1:29:53] [Music]
[1:29:59] holy ghost
[1:30:06] [Applause]
[1:30:11] holy ghost holy ghost
[1:30:15] power of the highest holy ghost and
[1:30:17] power the eyes
[1:30:20] what is the angel telling her you have
[1:30:22] received the promised word
[1:30:23] but now the dynamics of
[1:30:27] the promised world will come upon you
[1:30:30] to manifest or to prove or to confirm
[1:30:34] or to vindicate the promise that god has
[1:30:37] made
[1:30:38] and if god send behold i sent elijah
[1:30:41] and he shall tell the hearts of the
[1:30:45] children
[1:30:46] back to the faith of the fathers not
[1:30:48] devil no fallen angel
[1:30:50] satan and all his angels just stopped
[1:30:53] that word
[1:30:54] from coming to pass he said my word
[1:30:58] that gold in my mouth cannot
[1:31:01] will not return void or empty you see
[1:31:16] why
[1:31:17] the prophet says say what the tips say
[1:31:20] so every revelation
[1:31:21] had to be identified by the scriptures
[1:31:24] and my what has been revealed not only
[1:31:26] by what have been revealed but by the
[1:31:27] scriptures
[1:31:28] because when the angel came to the
[1:31:30] prophet with the seals he went back in
[1:31:31] the bible
[1:31:32] to see if the angels were talking
[1:31:34] according to the word
[1:31:35] because if that innocent engine if only
[1:31:37] would that injure him take a post
[1:31:39] posted stamp and fly back to where he
[1:31:41] come from
[1:31:44] any angel wing or knowings
[1:31:47] that say any other thing than the
[1:31:48] scriptures pack him up and send them out
[1:31:51] i don't care what knowledge in the field
[1:31:52] you have a way of saying
[1:31:54] i don't want to see your wings and i
[1:31:55] want to say a talk let the engine open
[1:31:58] mount because satan
[1:31:59] disguise himself as the angel of light
[1:32:02] but he talks whether to expose him he
[1:32:05] have unbelief
[1:32:06] so don't just working like you're
[1:32:08] flapping you're flapping yes i wait a
[1:32:09] little talk
[1:32:10] go sing talk you can sing christian song
[1:32:13] and still be a devil
[1:32:14] talk i want to hear where you're talking
[1:32:17] what coming out your mouth because i
[1:32:19] know when god speaks it's only the word
[1:32:23] oh come on now when satan opens his
[1:32:25] mouth is a bunch of lies
[1:32:27] but when god speaks is the word and once
[1:32:30] that come on god's mouth
[1:32:32] there's going to be revival in this
[1:32:34] church
[1:32:37] a holy ghost revival a seventh on the
[1:32:40] rewriter
[1:32:41] oh glory to god god can lie i like how
[1:32:44] you feel
[1:32:45] the revival not turned by your feelings
[1:32:54] [Applause]
[1:32:56] [Music]
[1:33:05] some people some people feel that they
[1:33:07] see a certain thing
[1:33:09] that they want to hear or when they say
[1:33:10] that then you only would
[1:33:12] amen so the written see if you say no
[1:33:15] word
[1:33:16] if i say that
[1:33:30] and because this man is the high priest
[1:33:32] in his district and area and his kingdom
[1:33:34] he must have come straight to him hill
[1:33:35] caissons
[1:33:38] okay first had the biggest bible his
[1:33:40] bible is cool
[1:33:43] gold plated
[1:33:46] his scriptures is not normal print
[1:33:49] everybody
[1:33:50] have normal print but kaifa's bible is
[1:33:51] different
[1:33:53] his his hat is a little taller than all
[1:33:55] the rest because he is
[1:33:56] high priest not low priest high priest
[1:34:00] so what on his head is real high and he
[1:34:03] expect messiah to come to him
[1:34:06] herod get caught napping when them three

[1:36:31] he's supposed to call it the people and
[1:36:32] moses know all the word and mother sit
[1:36:34] down there studying it
[1:36:36] and my god moses feeling inspired
[1:36:39] to deliver them and he you make a move
[1:36:42] he killed one man
[1:36:43] and when he recognized dumb and dead
[1:36:47] look around me again moses take off
[1:36:53] god made a promise told abraham my
[1:36:56] peoples are jesus in australia's land
[1:36:58] and with a mighty hand i will bring them
[1:37:01] out
[1:37:02] that was the word from god's mouth that
[1:37:04] word can't return
[1:37:05] void moses was going to be the mighty
[1:37:08] hand
[1:37:09] that god was used to bring the people
[1:37:10] out now this mighty hand gone on the run
[1:37:13] this mighty hand take off does god get
[1:37:16] moses part two
[1:37:18] moses is second no moses goddard looking
[1:37:20] for no new moses
[1:37:22] is he saying moses what moses need is
[1:37:24] the dynamics
[1:37:26] of the promised word here made that yet
[1:37:29] that is why he failed
[1:37:31] and we will fail meeting the dynamics
[1:37:35] of the promised word look for it
[1:37:38] expect it pray for it ask god for it
[1:37:43] you've got to have it so god let moses
[1:37:46] out of egypt
[1:37:47] and moses there with his wife and family
[1:37:49] settling down for years
[1:37:51] and god do like nothing happening like
[1:37:53] god's sleeping
[1:37:54] because god of a time a tick tick tick
[1:37:56] tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick
[1:37:58] tick oh glory to god can't go and work
[1:38:00] out timing
[1:38:01] it has to be the appointed time then
[1:38:04] people have to cry and ball and groan
[1:38:05] and travail
[1:38:06] like all the people not doing now
[1:38:10] let me say it again those peoples had to
[1:38:13] cry
[1:38:14] and groan and bald like all the people
[1:38:17] not doing now
[1:38:22] bye bye pressure coming you know if you
[1:38:24] think pressure you see logan pressure
[1:38:25] more pressure coming you know
[1:38:27] people had to cry and grown and then god
[1:38:29] came down and tell moses moses moses
[1:38:31] moses moses
[1:38:32] hallelujah light come down fire and bush
[1:38:35] you bush that burn and moses is going to
[1:38:36] be able to see
[1:38:37] and when they come in the presence of
[1:38:38] god mostly got to take off your shoes
[1:38:41] this jurisdiction here is minds you're
[1:38:43] not on your grounds
[1:38:44] you're not in your carpet and you're not
[1:38:46] in your house this is my ground zero
[1:38:48] i come down because i hear in the cries
[1:38:50] of my people i
[1:38:51] come down to deliver them watch this i
[1:38:53] come now but you go in
[1:38:55] [Applause]
[1:38:57] because god has to use a man to
[1:39:00] accomplish his purpose
[1:39:02] hallelujah he after he's in the affairs
[1:39:03] of men when god flirted moses then moses
[1:39:06] gone back to his wife
[1:39:07] she said where you're going to pack up
[1:39:08] one time all the time
[1:39:11] is bringing in things and no he's
[1:39:12] packing up he said we should win she
[1:39:13] started going to egypt what for to take
[1:39:15] over
[1:39:16] baron said it like that to take over
[1:39:18] anybody here in that man's statement if
[1:39:20] he's a madman newspaper interviewing
[1:39:23] anything but his job on moses he's
[1:39:25] totally insane
[1:39:26] say moses gone looney
[1:39:30] he said in print he's going to take over
[1:39:32] egypt
[1:39:33] that newspaper on that side moses is
[1:39:35] going long straight down to egypt
[1:39:36] iran his wife child he go unknown egypt
[1:39:41] tell pharaoh let my people go no moses
[1:39:43] know the word
[1:39:45] they would carry turn void he has to
[1:39:47] bring them what god tell moses bring
[1:39:48] them to this mountain
[1:39:50] go get my return ticket a return ticket
[1:39:52] means you're going and you're coming
[1:39:54] back no devil can't kill you out your
[1:39:56] light you can't get no accident
[1:39:58] some motorbike jump over and function in
[1:40:00] the dead
[1:40:01] that can happen i say that is not
[1:40:03] happening so forget about that
[1:40:05] kill your fears today yet i know at all
[1:40:10] forget that that take another go make a
[1:40:11] spin somewhere check somebody else
[1:40:14] oh give the lord a shout you're not
[1:40:17] going to leave you and get depressed as
[1:40:18] it was before no no no that died today
[1:40:20] too oh give the lord a shout
[1:40:23] out we know the story
[1:40:27] pharaoh thought moses was joking when
[1:40:29] moses dropped down the stick they said
[1:40:31] that's what you're doing we could do
[1:40:32] that too
[1:40:33] then drop two sticks turn to snake moses
[1:40:35] snake is up there soon
[1:40:37] and that was as the first rounds and
[1:40:39] moses
[1:40:40] connected to the voice of god the mouth
[1:40:42] of god do you think was moses speaking
[1:40:44] it was god speaking
[1:40:45] let there be flies hallelujah let there
[1:40:48] be frogs let there be
[1:40:50] fleas and moses is only dropping the
[1:40:51] word
[1:40:53] oh glory to god bro says and just a
[1:40:55] little bit of flies and then so much a
[1:40:57] bounce per inch
[1:40:58] fly zest take over the place just words
[1:41:00] from the mouth the creative power
[1:41:02] and that could be in the bride we have
[1:41:04] five manifestations
[1:41:06] to fight for to contend for one of them
[1:41:09] is spoken with creation
[1:41:11] one or one is power over the element oh
[1:41:14] glory to god hallelujah praise god
[1:41:16] isn't that right hallelujah oh glory to
[1:41:20] god
[1:41:21] hallelujah the prophet said little fishy
[1:41:26] you may be seated god tell the prophet
[1:41:28] you have a resurrection of a small
[1:41:29] animal
[1:41:30] he thought what this he thought was that
[1:41:31] he was talking to that he forget about
[1:41:32] it he in the boat fishing
[1:41:34] take out the little fish trees on the
[1:41:35] ground all of a sudden he's a rumbling
[1:41:37] of the mountain
[1:41:39] what is that the dynamics the spirit
[1:41:42] the power roll off he stand up to his
[1:41:43] feet speak he's a little
[1:41:46] fishy i give you back your life in the
[1:41:48] name of jesus christ
[1:41:49] and a dead fish turn over and speed off
[1:41:52] and if god can get power ah
[1:41:55] a little old fish where's our fish
[1:41:58] thousands us die
[1:41:59] and god show and demonstrate if god
[1:42:01] could put power and bring a fish to life
[1:42:03] what about your loved ones what about
[1:42:05] your family
[1:42:05] what about your back sudden son your
[1:42:07] mental daughter whatever condition
[1:42:09] they're in
[1:42:10] god is able do you believe that
[1:42:14] [Applause]
[1:42:17] let me see if i can wrap up here
[1:42:24] we are looking for the dynamics of it
[1:42:28] so many we've got the mechanics of
[1:42:30] religion and the bible so bottle eyes
[1:42:32] it looks like a great big five coach
[1:42:34] sitting out there on a track
[1:42:35] but if you haven't got any steam in it
[1:42:37] it takes the dynamic to perform with the
[1:42:39] mechanics
[1:42:40] and what we need now is to see that this
[1:42:44] is what we have been taught all these
[1:42:45] years is it the truth or not i'm still
[1:42:47] reading
[1:42:49] it's been explained over and over and
[1:42:52] over
[1:42:53] through different seminaries and
[1:42:54] churches and so forth until we are
[1:42:56] looking to see who this person is
[1:42:58] no you say brother branham how would you
[1:43:00] do it well you know
[1:43:01] did you notice when they come to a
[1:43:03] servant of christ who had been trained
[1:43:05] to know what to do
[1:43:06] not just say sit down wait now
[1:43:10] sit down here i'll explain it no
[1:43:13] he brought them straight to him cause
[1:43:16] that is what they wanted to see
[1:43:18] they say we would see jesus oh glory to
[1:43:22] god hallelujah isn't that right
[1:43:25] that wasn't the question they wanted to
[1:43:27] see jesus god had someone standing there
[1:43:29] philip
[1:43:29] that could take them to show them to the
[1:43:31] person of jesus christ
[1:43:34] now that is what we want to see we want
[1:43:36] to see the person
[1:43:37] you say well brother branham we will see
[1:43:39] him when he comes yes
[1:43:40] but he promised that he in the person of
[1:43:43] the holy spirit
[1:43:45] would come in the last days and would be
[1:43:47] with us
[1:43:48] even in us to the end of the world and
[1:43:50] the things that he
[1:43:52] did we would do also
[1:43:55] so this is a little more than talk right
[1:43:58] this is a little more than explain right
[1:44:00] the same things he did we would do also
[1:44:04] oh praise god and notice hebrew state in
[1:44:06] it he's the same yesterday
[1:44:08] today and forever and there is only
[1:44:11] the only one way to know what he is
[1:44:13] today
[1:44:14] we find we couldn't find him and find
[1:44:16] lecturers because we find people who
[1:44:18] listen we find people who can stand up
[1:44:20] and explain the word in such a way it is
[1:44:22] just breathtaking
[1:44:26] and we find it it's still just a lecture
[1:44:30] just a lecture it's the mechanics
[1:44:34] and we find the entertainer who could go
[1:44:36] through all the action and so forth but
[1:44:38] that still isn't it
[1:44:39] that isn't what we are looking for we
[1:44:42] are looking for the person
[1:44:44] jesus christ who is the same yesterday
[1:44:47] today and forever
[1:44:48] oh glory to god could you take a little
[1:44:51] more
[1:44:52] god is here jesus christ is the same
[1:44:55] yesterday and forever his power is just
[1:44:57] the same today
[1:44:58] as it ever was he does not fail he
[1:45:01] cannot fail
[1:45:02] he is god he has to remain god
[1:45:05] says we would see jesus not hear the
[1:45:08] mechanics
[1:45:09] but see the dynamics of him
[1:45:13] so you understand where pastor over
[1:45:14] coming from now we're not talking about
[1:45:16] mechanics
[1:45:17] a nice explanation of vile sees wars
[1:45:20] mysteries between a woman and the sun
[1:45:22] and everything else we're not talking
[1:45:23] about that
[1:45:24] we talk about the dynamics of him
[1:45:28] so i'm not talking about the pope i'm
[1:45:30] not talking about israel
[1:45:32] god's time peace i'm not talking about
[1:45:34] those things
[1:45:35] i'm talking about the dynamics to your
[1:45:37] mechanics
[1:45:38] [Music]
[1:45:38] [Applause]
[1:45:40] and we call it the dynamics of the
[1:45:42] promised word
[1:45:44] oh my god here we go god
[1:45:48] in this holy ghost dispensation god the
[1:45:51] father was the word
[1:45:52] god the son was the word and god the
[1:45:54] holy ghost is the word
[1:45:56] it's just three offices and the holy
[1:45:59] ghost
[1:46:00] seals you therefore you are sealed by
[1:46:03] the word
[1:46:04] oh that's a big one that's a big one
[1:46:07] because the words that i speak this is
[1:46:09] jesus talking now
[1:46:10] they are spirit and they are life
[1:46:13] so before you are sealed with the spirit
[1:46:16] you are sealed by the word
[1:46:18] so when jesus opened the word to them
[1:46:20] they were sealed
[1:46:22] receiving the holy ghost they were
[1:46:24] sealed
[1:46:26] [Music]
[1:46:29] they were sealed with the word of
[1:46:31] promise
[1:46:33] [Music]
[1:46:33] [Applause]
[1:46:35] their wombs were sealed their minds were
[1:46:38] sealed
[1:46:38] their heart was sealed they were
[1:46:40] pregnanted with god
[1:46:42] they couldn't receive another seed what
[1:46:45] they had in them was the seed of god
[1:46:48] now here comes the bread of god
[1:46:52] in the upper room they had to wait for
[1:46:54] the prophecy
[1:46:55] that was hanging over them receiving the
[1:46:58] holy ghost
[1:46:59] oh glory to god so jesus told them
[1:47:02] carrying the city of jerusalem
[1:47:04] until until
[1:47:07] until you'll be endued
[1:47:10] with power from on high not from a
[1:47:13] fightful minister trying to make an
[1:47:15] explanation
[1:47:16] that's not what we talking about power
[1:47:18] from on high
[1:47:22] [Music]
[1:47:29] no i can't do that i ain't make the fifo
[1:47:34] i can't cancel god fight for ministry
[1:47:36] ephesians 4 says so
[1:47:37] the fight for ministry is for the
[1:47:39] perfecting the saints
[1:47:41] but the fight for ministry according to
[1:47:42] what the reveal is the ministry
[1:47:44] of jesus christ and that is the cap
[1:47:47] stone
[1:47:48] coming upon a man that have added them
[1:47:51] seven things
[1:47:53] and for them seven things to be proven
[1:47:55] and vindicated
[1:47:57] it has to be tested
[1:48:00] [Applause]
[1:48:02] and he says satan or lucy he will test
[1:48:06] them things for you
[1:48:07] oh devil lord you can't bluff it
[1:48:10] there'll be no impersonation
[1:48:12] to the temple we could talk or we talk
[1:48:15] but we have to walk the talk give the
[1:48:17] lord a shout
[1:48:19] out
[1:48:20] [Applause]
[1:48:23] my god but over the preaching brutal
[1:48:27] yeah brutal preaching because the devil
[1:48:31] not taking no prisoners
[1:48:32] he come to steal rob and destroy when
[1:48:35] adam lost his life he lost his
[1:48:36] inheritance in life
[1:48:38] then he lost the book and satan had the
[1:48:40] book temporarily fast to his hands
[1:48:42] his greasy hands was going to hold it
[1:48:44] but the greasy hands of unbelievable his
[1:48:46] hands
[1:48:47] went back to the hands of the original
[1:48:49] owner waiting for redemption claims
[1:48:52] wait is the who is worthy waiting for
[1:48:54] the royal sea of abraham
[1:48:55] to come and take that book and
[1:48:57] revelation 10 said i saw another mighty
[1:48:59] angel
[1:49:00] call with a clown descend from heaven
[1:49:03] with the same book
[1:49:05] that adam lost is open
[1:49:09] it's on the earth until the lord i shout
[1:49:13] i feel strengthened this morning i feel
[1:49:16] encouraged this morning
[1:49:17] because the book that i almost lost the
[1:49:20] book that was unsealed
[1:49:22] is now open tonight oh glory to god
[1:49:26] oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah
[1:49:28] hallelujah
[1:49:29] right with me right with me right with
[1:49:31] me right with me ride with me
[1:49:35] glory oh glory do you feel the anointing
[1:49:38] do you
[1:49:39] do you feel that that is what's going to
[1:49:42] come inside of you you may be seated
[1:49:45] this book adam lost this book that was
[1:49:48] sealed
[1:49:49] is now on seal every seal towed off
[1:49:52] because the seventh seal the last seal
[1:49:55] is what lock up the book
[1:49:56] say they pull out succeed the books are
[1:49:58] closed but the angel came with the book
[1:50:00] open
[1:50:00] that mean all seals traps was busted
[1:50:02] open duncan the angel
[1:50:05] drop it to the hands of the prophet they
[1:50:07] probably put it on books and tapes
[1:50:09] and then god john was told go to the
[1:50:12] angel
[1:50:13] not go to some man go to the angel
[1:50:16] i said give me that book that book that
[1:50:19] i might have
[1:50:20] that book that was lost that book i was
[1:50:22] sealed i want it
[1:50:24] i need to have it because he paid for
[1:50:26] that for me
[1:50:27] that is my book i know man book that
[1:50:30] book belonged to all the sons of god
[1:50:32] that's the book of authority that's the
[1:50:34] book of power
[1:50:35] that's the book that had your name you
[1:50:37] have to see your name
[1:50:39] or give the lord a show i want to see my
[1:50:42] name give me the book
[1:50:43] [Music]
[1:50:45] [Applause]
[1:50:46] [Music]
[1:50:50] maybe season in the catholic church
[1:50:52] there's the lock up the bible
[1:50:54] nobody can read the bible they tie them
[1:50:56] i have a chance
[1:50:58] luther got a revelation they just sell
[1:51:00] it by faith
[1:51:01] he struggled and opened a big old bible
[1:51:03] and read it just
[1:51:04] like my faith and that caused a
[1:51:05] revolution that shook up europe
[1:51:08] a thunder hit them because a man saw his
[1:51:11] name in the book
[1:51:12] and produced justification don't let no
[1:51:15] man keep you from themselves
[1:51:16] don't let their man keep it on the open
[1:51:18] book no man no bishop
[1:51:20] man no message man no pope man no
[1:51:22] fightful man no minister man
[1:51:24] [Music]
[1:51:28] maybe season
[1:51:32] just think about it you could go to any
[1:51:34] message and read it and eat it
[1:51:38] listen to any tape and say lord this is
[1:51:39] mine you had to wait for the pastor to
[1:51:42] interpret that to you
[1:51:43] god's speaking directly people you think
[1:51:46] the god have a kind of funny motherhood
[1:51:48] god can't talk goku talk french
[1:51:51] spanish english german god know all the
[1:51:54] language
[1:51:55] when peter the holy ghost fell they say
[1:51:56] oh here we our own tongue
[1:51:59] they was hearing in their own language
[1:52:01] so when god talk is an automatic
[1:52:02] translation
[1:52:04] oh glory to god you're hearing in your
[1:52:06] own tongue this is god we talking about
[1:52:09] do you think god didn't know they're
[1:52:10] trying to build the tower people to
[1:52:11] heaven that way he confused them
[1:52:12] again in other languages god could talk
[1:52:14] any language and god could talk to you
[1:52:16] this morning
[1:52:17] god is talking to you this morning you
[1:52:19] have a promise you will hear direct from
[1:52:20] god
[1:52:21] god is speaking to you this morning oh
[1:52:24] glory hallelujah
[1:52:26] glory to god so watch
[1:52:29] so the holy ghost is the word father is
[1:52:30] the word the son is the word
[1:52:32] but the holy ghost is also spirit see
[1:52:35] you get that now
[1:52:36] hallelujah so you see the letter why
[1:52:40] i just love that scripture jesus told
[1:52:42] them search the scriptures
[1:52:45] which is the text but in them you think
[1:52:48] you have eternal life
[1:52:49] but they testify of me what is telling
[1:52:51] them i am the scriptures made alive
[1:52:54] or i am the living word of the text that
[1:52:57] you're reading
[1:52:58] and when the living word has come you're
[1:53:00] getting life by living word
[1:53:01] [Applause]
[1:53:03] [Music]
[1:53:05] your care called text when living word
[1:53:07] is here
[1:53:09] so when the holy ghost fell on their
[1:53:10] pentacles peter and all of them they
[1:53:12] became the living texts
[1:53:15] remember there was no scripture called
[1:53:17] the book of peter and the book of paul
[1:53:19] and corinthians they just got the holy
[1:53:21] ghost
[1:53:22] gay were god's text a
[1:53:25] word made flesh or word manifest
[1:53:28] [Applause]
[1:53:30] so now life was coming out of their
[1:53:32] mouths
[1:53:33] [Music]
[1:53:35] to vindicate what they had peter
[1:53:38] was allowed to meet this man and they
[1:53:40] get caught beautiful and god allowed him
[1:53:42] to have no money that day
[1:53:44] because if he had money he just give him
[1:53:46] man money normal
[1:53:48] normal but because when he pushed in his
[1:53:50] pocket he didn't have anything
[1:53:52] he's a silver goal i do have but brother
[1:53:54] what i have
[1:53:56] what i have not what i think i have
[1:54:00] not what i imagine i have but what i
[1:54:03] have i could give
[1:54:09] rise up and walk in the name of jesus
[1:54:12] christ
[1:54:14] a man had to jump and leap and all
[1:54:16] jerusalem had to talk about that
[1:54:18] that was the talk of the tongue that
[1:54:21] went viral
[1:54:24] that was on facebook that was on twitter
[1:54:26] that was everywhere
[1:54:27] a man who was crippled is not walking
[1:54:30] that gone viral
[1:54:31] but god has something more to unfold
[1:54:35] because jesus told him the works that i
[1:54:36] do shall you do
[1:54:38] and greater.
[1:54:41] [Music]
[1:54:42] so to identify and unveil what greater
[1:54:45] was
[1:54:46] god let peter get an invite to come to
[1:54:49] cornelia's house
[1:54:50] and god gave cornelius to send her
[1:54:53] invite
[1:54:53] for peter this is god working on both
[1:54:56] sides
[1:54:57] peter don't want to go gotta drop a
[1:54:59] vision
[1:55:00] go cornea is on their expectation he is
[1:55:04] just he is devout he's a given person
[1:55:07] a caring person a praying person oh
[1:55:10] glory to god that's the kind of money is
[1:55:13] peter just come and start to testify
[1:55:15] peter air come to try to make no
[1:55:16] manifestation or do no action he was
[1:55:18] just talking about jesus
[1:55:20] and while peter
[1:55:23] spoke the words
[1:55:26] the holy ghost the word was a seed
[1:55:30] but the spirit the dynamics of the
[1:55:33] promised world
[1:55:34] was present tense so peter had mechanics
[1:55:38] and dynamics together working
[1:55:42] the cornelius didn't have to wait as the
[1:55:45] word went out
[1:55:46] the spirit went out and he was filled
[1:55:50] with the same holy ghost that peter had
[1:55:54] and corniness wasn't even baptized yet
[1:55:57] oh get the lord i
[1:55:58] shout is this real to you this morning
[1:56:01] [Music]

[1:56:08] eternal life by the word oh glory to god
[1:56:12] are we going to come back to that yes we
[1:56:14] will when dynamics
[1:56:17] the dynamics of the promised word make
[1:56:19] the word manifest
[1:56:21] oh glory to god let me drop a bomb on
[1:56:23] you

[1:56:25] the church is
[1:56:27] teacher prophet evangelist hallelujah
[1:56:31] they are god's mechanics and the
[1:56:33] dynamics is the fire

[1:56:39] a shout
[1:56:41] all glory to god so if the fifo ministry
[1:56:45] is god's mechanics
[1:56:46] you have to see the working of that
[1:56:48] mechanics by the dynamics
[1:56:52] not talk oh glory to god
[1:56:56] hallelujah give me another word look at
[1:56:58] philip
[1:56:59] you're the fightful minister evangelist

[2:01:07] [Music]
[2:01:10] the mechanics here we go there are so
[2:01:12] many people trying to explain the
[2:01:13] mechanics when they don't know it
[2:01:16] you ready are you ready you don't
[2:01:19] have to know the mechanics just
[2:01:22] the dynamics of it the dynamics is what
[2:01:25] you want to know
[2:01:27] i don't need to know about plugs spark
[2:01:30] plugs the line
[2:01:31] the connector and this unit and the

[2:06:20] bull and pay for it
[2:06:22] but god makes sure he is vulnerable well
[2:06:24] that's a big word
[2:06:26] we don't like to be vulnerable we like
[2:06:28] to be strong
[2:06:29] we let the people protected we like to
[2:06:31] know we have everything our base covered
[2:06:32] god make sure this base wasn't covered
[2:06:34] he was exposed
[2:06:36] he was vulnerable do you want to be
[2:06:38] vulnerable nobody wants to be vulnerable
[2:06:40] but god set him up to be vulnerable
[2:06:42] in order that he could become his
[2:06:43] strength he could become
[2:06:45] his protection he god could become his
[2:06:48] help
[2:06:49] [Applause]
[2:06:55] when he said bull i don't mean to they

[2:07:06] they both know how to talk back in them
[2:07:09] i had a privilege to have my
[2:07:11] granddaughter by me and anna anna just
[2:07:13] to tell her say what about your um

[2:07:30] understands
[2:07:32] she understands this is a ball there's a
[2:07:34] rubber ducky she understands that
[2:07:37] well the bull will understand when we
[2:07:39] speak
[2:07:40] with the language of love the bull will
[2:07:42] understand
[2:07:46] you can't bluff it
[2:07:48] [Applause]
[2:07:53] i hope they shake us today you know not
[2:07:56] shake you
[2:07:57] shake us because we have to deal with
[2:08:00] real things you know
[2:08:06] goliath was real enough the reason
[2:08:08] nobody has stepped up because he was
[2:08:09] really beginner
[2:08:11] he was really a giant channel he was
[2:08:14] really invincible until david came in
[2:08:18] when david came david shape him into
[2:08:20] size he said uncircumcised
[2:08:24] then you give us a bullseye target i
[2:08:27] ain't going to sword but he
[2:08:28] nice foolishness do you expect david
[2:08:34] david a good david come with a different
[2:08:37] tool they might see his head so and see
[2:08:40] the big big brother he's a target
[2:08:43] i'll take him
[2:08:47] his viewpoint is different and our
[2:08:50] viewpoint have to become different
[2:08:53] understand what brother isaac preached
[2:08:56] jurisdiction
[2:08:57] come the power on earth that satan tried
[2:08:59] to make a grab for and
[2:09:01] he had temporarily he lost it he is
[2:09:03] wounded
[2:09:05] he's already defeated what he can't
[2:09:08] handle
[2:09:08] is us getting back into our position
[2:09:12] that is the that happened to digest
[2:09:16] these men these humans oh being given a
[2:09:19] power and authority
[2:09:21] so when badabanam came but a man was
[2:09:22] running everywhere
[2:09:24] baron was a dangerous man to satan's
[2:09:26] kingdom you know because he was cast
[2:09:28] endeavors out
[2:09:29] one time he called some spirit and he
[2:09:31] said like a spirit asking for help for
[2:09:32] another one across there
[2:09:33] so like high blood pressure spirit here
[2:09:35] and he calling for other spirits because
[2:09:36] you don't want to go
[2:09:37] see ask him for help no you're not
[2:09:39] seeing that inaudible young people just
[2:09:41] saying no saying
[2:09:42] but spirits jumping on them
[2:09:46] and then you will just take say all the
[2:09:47] wi-fi represents stand up and
[2:09:49] bam some power and just slap them out
[2:09:50] all them demons go in one shot
[2:09:53] [Applause]
[2:09:56] casting them up cast them by groups
[2:10:01] all what diabetes stand up and then
[2:10:02] afterwards just get out
[2:10:05] all in spirits
[2:10:07] [Applause]
[2:10:09] what does balram do yeah what he says i
[2:10:11] don't know if what he will do
[2:10:12] i'm waiting on him you know what i'm
[2:10:13] waiting on i don't know if you come you
[2:10:15] know he's not sure he preached the word
[2:10:17] mechanics he just pushed it without
[2:10:19] mechanics but i'm waiting you know
[2:10:20] waiting on you're looking for the spirit
[2:10:21] the dynamics now
[2:10:23] all of a sudden he is here now let me
[2:10:25] backward a little bit
[2:10:26] when god told brother branham to show
[2:10:29] billy paul the angel not his brother the
[2:10:31] only dead
[2:10:31] and the ram came at night and covered
[2:10:33] billy paul with a pillow
[2:10:35] and said you know nobody table that you
[2:10:36] know what he think of that watch there
[2:10:38] the angel is there he saw the angel what
[2:10:39] that
[2:10:40] he said since that time he always know
[2:10:43] when the angel come into the building
[2:10:45] even
[2:10:46] before braham say he is here soon but he
[2:10:49] knows
[2:10:50] so god allowed by the paul to get the
[2:10:52] experience because billy paul gonna be
[2:10:53] working with his father
[2:10:54] the prophet right now notice when he
[2:10:56] says he is here
[2:10:58] what he says after that i take
[2:11:01] every spirit under my control
[2:11:06] for the glory of god this is putting all
[2:11:09] them in our kids
[2:11:11] and bind them up front and say you're
[2:11:13] not moving
[2:11:14] until i say so
[2:11:15] [Applause]
[2:11:20] these are the angels that fell from
[2:11:22] heaven these are fallen angels
[2:11:25] in the realm of sicknesses disease
[2:11:27] depression and affliction
[2:11:29] and he is binding them all of them i
[2:11:31] take every spirit
[2:11:32] under my control so now they can't move
[2:11:37] they're waiting to get cast out
[2:11:40] notice not not escorted out notice
[2:11:43] not uh you know you leave if you want to
[2:11:46] no he said in my name
[2:11:48] [Applause]
[2:11:50] you saw what say it say don't love you
[2:11:53] shall what
[2:11:55] cast out devils cast out means just that
[2:11:58] hold in my hand and fling them
[2:12:01] i'm not hearing you i am not hearing you
[2:12:06] you're throwing them out you're flinging
[2:12:08] them out
[2:12:10] you're casting them out get the enemy
[2:12:14] [Music]
[2:12:14] [Applause]
[2:12:16] [Music]
[2:12:18] satan
[2:12:20] [Applause]
[2:12:23] glory glory
[2:12:34] [Applause]
[2:12:36] you don't have to know the mechanics
[2:12:38] just the dynamics of it
[2:12:40] the dynamics is what you want to know
[2:12:42] but i'm saying he didn't know it
[2:12:44] moses he didn't know the mechanics he
[2:12:45] just know the dynamics that's the way
[2:12:46] now moses might have known the mechanics
[2:12:48] but there was nobody else's place to
[2:12:50] understand about moses
[2:12:51] then he said he is the dynamics christ
[2:12:54] who that was a man from america
[2:13:00] i thought somebody from europe he is the
[2:13:02] dynamics
[2:13:04] oh so you mean we have to connect with
[2:13:06] him
[2:13:07] oh that's really that's true he christ
[2:13:10] is the dynamics
[2:13:11] that's what we say we just become
[2:13:12] members of the machine of his body
[2:13:15] forming ourselves into his image
[2:13:17] and see him united with us and in his
[2:13:20] works love gifts as he hands them to us
[2:13:22] before the wedding supper museum please
[2:13:24] the dynamics of this church
[2:13:26] we know it will be a refilling of the
[2:13:28] holy spirit
[2:13:30] that we have worked in a small measure
[2:13:31] while it has some come down to unite
[2:13:33] with the body
[2:13:34] hallelujah it's your approach friends
[2:13:38] the attitude is what it takes and the
[2:13:40] other order just here tonight
[2:13:41] dear friend it takes the attitude we
[2:13:44] are and believe that we are in the
[2:13:47] presence of jesus christ
[2:13:48] but it's your attitude that brings the
[2:13:50] results the mechanics is here
[2:13:53] and so is the dynamics if you can get
[2:13:55] started
[2:13:56] god will do the rest and this is where
[2:14:00] i got the inspiration from the message
[2:14:03] the dynamics of the promised work
[2:14:06] hallelujah today we study mechanics
[2:14:07] until it's all mechanical
[2:14:12] okay let me back up a little bit our
[2:14:13] educational system or denominational
[2:14:15] system
[2:14:16] has took the place of the holy spirit
[2:14:17] leading the church our great fine train
[2:14:19] of ministers and things have taken the
[2:14:21] place of the all-night prime meetings
[2:14:22] and the old time we were used to get to
[2:14:25] god
[2:14:26] now instead of having preachers we got
[2:14:28] lecturers
[2:14:29] men knows the word just as well they can
[2:14:31] sit there and put it together in such a
[2:14:32] way
[2:14:33] that is astounding how they can do it
[2:14:36] they know
[2:14:36] the mechanics but that ain't the
[2:14:39] dynamics
[2:14:41] now we're talking about truth you know i
[2:14:42] don't know what force teaches you know
[2:14:43] man accurate with the word anything and
[2:14:45] no problem with what they're teaching
[2:14:46] our preaching
[2:14:47] but no dynamics
[2:14:50] that come like samson starts with no
[2:14:51] power he can't beat nobody
[2:14:54] he had muscles and things like that and
[2:14:55] all he could do is then bodybuilders do
[2:14:57] so
[2:14:58] pictures just posting
[2:15:02] something posing there's no good reason
[2:15:03] to post to get pictures
[2:15:05] all right watch they know the mechanics
[2:15:08] but that ain't the dynamics
[2:15:10] we want the dynamics i don't care about
[2:15:13] the mechanics
[2:15:14] i want to know the dynamics
[2:15:19] that you're talking about no i'm reading
[2:15:21] what the prophet said i don't know how
[2:15:23] that car runs out there you've got
[2:15:24] pistons cylinders i don't know how much
[2:15:25] pressure to use the only thing i know is
[2:15:27] the dynamics put it over there drive it
[2:15:29] that's what we know god made a promise
[2:15:31] i'll pour my spirit upon flesh
[2:15:32] your sons and daughters shall prophesy
[2:15:34] how is he gonna do it i can't tell you i
[2:15:36] just want to know the dynamics of god's
[2:15:37] system
[2:15:38] he said that's the main thing that's the
[2:15:40] what shout out maintain
[2:15:43] today we study the mechanics until we
[2:15:45] got it all mechanical what's good is an
[2:15:47] automobile without something to drive it
[2:15:48] what good is the lights or fixtures if
[2:15:50] there's no current to go to it
[2:15:52] we've got mechanics we've got schools
[2:15:54] educators man trained man
[2:15:56] he can stand the pulpit with such
[2:15:57] manners till he's an eloquent person
[2:15:59] that still
[2:16:00] don't bring the power of god where is
[2:16:02] the power that used to be in the church
[2:16:04] where is the pentecostal blessing that
[2:16:06] used to flow through the churches that's
[2:16:07] the reason the world is falling apart
[2:16:10] hallelujah and here we go we see nations
[2:16:13] breaking
[2:16:14] israel awakening the signs that this
[2:16:16] bible foretold for this day
[2:16:17] nor we see the mechanical taking place
[2:16:19] no are you ready
[2:16:22] the spirit the dynamics of that
[2:16:26] promised word to get into his church
[2:16:29] and drive them into calvary under unto
[2:16:32] the rapture
[2:16:33] that is where i get the title from the
[2:16:35] dynamics of the promised world
[2:16:37] before you see the dynamics he said the
[2:16:38] spirit have to do what
[2:16:41] drive you to calvary everybody
[2:16:45] gold got us here nobody is a calorie so
[2:16:49] and you're going slow you're going so
[2:16:50] you're going so you're getting feeling
[2:16:51] let it go this way if you're going to go
[2:16:52] this way
[2:16:53] feel it but when that time has come
[2:16:57] that commented drive you
[2:17:01] right now with conor vios running in
[2:17:03] america like if it's just like
[2:17:05] i don't know rampant some states looking
[2:17:07] to lock down again
[2:17:08] yeah stop in the bar stop any fets any
[2:17:10] party people they're not reading
[2:17:13] they don't care they don't want there
[2:17:15] were no masks and they're getting worse
[2:17:18] it passed 3 million that could take it
[2:17:21] to 9 million 20 million
[2:17:23] millions could actually die is something
[2:17:26] don't happen
[2:17:27] hallelujah what will drive people to do
[2:17:30] the right thing
[2:17:31] what will drive people to come with the
[2:17:33] liturgy and laziness and sluggishness
[2:17:35] dynamics is to drive you to calvary
[2:17:40] why calvary when those greeks act so
[2:17:42] with jesus what did jesus tell them
[2:17:43] except a corner wheat fall in the wrong
[2:17:46] and die it abide alone
[2:17:47] in other words at calvary is where you
[2:17:49] see me at
[2:17:51] calvary is where you get a manifestation
[2:17:53] i am done
[2:17:54] he is the dynamics of the mechanics the
[2:17:56] mechanics of the church what is it
[2:17:58] apostles prophets teachers and so forth
[2:18:00] he is the mechanic that works that
[2:18:02] then he says now watch when he tried
[2:18:04] this way he feels
[2:18:05] okay i'll skip that the mechanics don't
[2:18:07] run the church it's the dynamics the
[2:18:08] holy ghost
[2:18:09] that gets into this word it's not a
[2:18:11] seminary that teaches you all the
[2:18:12] theology in greek but it's the dynamics
[2:18:14] of the holy ghost that's set there
[2:18:15] it takes mechanics and dynamics the word
[2:18:18] and the spirit
[2:18:19] they are the one that give life it's the
[2:18:22] dynamics that got into the word
[2:18:24] he said we got the material and
[2:18:26] everything else we got the mechanics but
[2:18:28] where is dynamics that's what we need to
[2:18:30] move jesus christ in on the scene
[2:18:32] what's the matter i tell you there is
[2:18:34] one here today hallelujah called the
[2:18:36] holy ghost
[2:18:36] that can touch dynamics he is the
[2:18:39] dynamics
[2:18:40] of the mechanics so the dynamics is the
[2:18:42] holy ghost dynamics is jesus christ
[2:18:44] oh he's the one to touch oh glory to god
[2:18:47] it's the word here we go it's the word
[2:18:49] turn on
[2:18:50] the light turns on the mechanics and
[2:18:53] they become dynamics
[2:18:54] oh glory to god they have the word but
[2:18:56] the light is what turn it on
[2:18:58] like a switch the word is there but when
[2:19:00] the light comes it turn it on
[2:19:02] hallelujah and turn watch the mechanic
[2:19:05] become dynamics
[2:19:06] they are dynamics when the dynamics
[2:19:08] comes to the mechanics it start the
[2:19:10] thing and rolling
[2:19:10] oh praise one the enoch the mechanics he
[2:19:13] reflected became dynamics
[2:19:15] and god took him i'm almost finished
[2:19:17] here right now there have been churches
[2:19:18] churches brides brides churches and
[2:19:20] brides but there's got to come one
[2:19:22] that is the real bride there must come
[2:19:25] one
[2:19:26] that's not only got the mechanics but
[2:19:28] the dynamics of it
[2:19:29] to make that church live and move
[2:19:32] in the power of the resurrection not the
[2:19:34] power of argument
[2:19:38] nobody's like no no nobody power the
[2:19:40] beat
[2:19:41] therefore just laugh at that all the
[2:19:43] people's gonna argue one another
[2:19:44] that can work the power of the
[2:19:46] resurrection he said watch
[2:19:48] until we come to that place what the
[2:19:50] good does it do to do the
[2:19:52] cars and so on there's no dynamics that
[2:19:53] oh my
[2:19:55] until that church become both with
[2:19:57] mechanics and dynamics and the spirit of
[2:19:59] god moved in
[2:20:00] to do the same things he did oh praise
[2:20:02] god you can scream
[2:20:03] you can shout the mechanics with all the
[2:20:05] dynamics no good neither is the dynamics
[2:20:07] without the mechanics you can scream and
[2:20:08] shout jump up and down
[2:20:09] all you want to and deny this word it
[2:20:11] won't do you any good
[2:20:12] you're just cranking the pistons it will
[2:20:15] only work when they come together
[2:20:16] so one will set still and the other one
[2:20:19] will go up
[2:20:20] oh praise go it just won't move no
[2:20:21] matter how good the mechanics is
[2:20:23] until dynamics come when the dynamics
[2:20:27] come
[2:20:27] that fire is made to connect with the
[2:20:30] octane
[2:20:31] in the gasoline oh glory to god do you
[2:20:34] believe that
[2:20:36] national force put israel in our
[2:20:38] homeland national forest
[2:20:40] will put the church in the workings of
[2:20:41] churches but the power of god will put
[2:20:43] the
[2:20:44] people in the bride all glory the world
[2:20:46] forces this way
[2:20:47] and the world forces that way but god
[2:20:49] forces upwards the spirit of god
[2:20:51] which is the word of god my word is
[2:20:53] spirit and life
[2:20:54] will put the bride in a place because
[2:20:57] you recognize a position in a word
[2:20:58] then she's in christ so god you are here
[2:21:01] by chance
[2:21:02] you're not you haven't received the word
[2:21:04] by chance don't give up now and pack up
[2:21:05] now that word carry to avoid
[2:21:07] that word in you cannot go back to god
[2:21:09] empty
[2:21:10] that word in you will materialize your
[2:21:12] healing your deliverance
[2:21:13] your breakthrough your restoration that
[2:21:16] word inside of you
[2:21:17] oh glory to god amen hallelujah
[2:21:20] so when god dropped that promise on
[2:21:22] abraham that isaac coming
[2:21:24] hallelujah and he come down he said the
[2:21:26] lateran is fixing to fall you held that
[2:21:28] seat in there long enough believing
[2:21:29] you're looking for the common sun that
[2:21:31] real church oh praise god the lattering
[2:21:34] is coming
[2:21:35] oh praise god hear this part no what
[2:21:37] christ found
[2:21:38] christ find the people couldn't wait
[2:21:40] that's the matter with the people today
[2:21:42] they can't wait here this for the real
[2:21:44] holy spirit to take the church in
[2:21:46] position
[2:21:46] so that they make claims that god has
[2:21:48] not vindicated
[2:21:50] they have to put tall hats and make
[2:21:52] themselves fresh caiphus high priest
[2:21:55] otherwise known as the new modern out of
[2:21:57] the body fifo
[2:22:00] you've got to be in the body you have to
[2:22:01] be placed there and dynamics put you in
[2:22:04] the body
[2:22:05] to make you a faithful minister in the
[2:22:07] body of christ
[2:22:08] other than that is a fight for me
[2:22:09] outside the body just doing things and
[2:22:11] saying things
[2:22:12] with zero vindication all right they
[2:22:15] couldn't wait that's the reason the
[2:22:16] people today they can't wait for the
[2:22:18] real holy spirit
[2:22:19] to take the choice in position they got
[2:22:21] to manufacture something to get more
[2:22:23] members
[2:22:24] when christ come to his bride here we go
[2:22:28] she will be a virgin like mary was for
[2:22:31] god will not bring
[2:22:32] christ to the womb of a or
[2:22:34] prostitute
[2:22:35] and neither will he bring the bride he
[2:22:36] can't bring his word through
[2:22:38] a whole of his word that means you can't
[2:22:40] have no interpretation
[2:22:42] you can have no ideas you have to have
[2:22:44] what the tapes say
[2:22:46] what the promised words say you have to
[2:22:48] have what gossip the lord is
[2:22:50] that is what i have to have inside of
[2:22:51] you promise after promise after promise
[2:22:54] i'm done this is the last quote here
[2:22:57] holy spirit told and pick up the pen on
[2:22:59] the right right you see in the last days
[2:23:01] the true bride you're bringing the
[2:23:02] police will come to the headstone
[2:23:05] and she will be a super church a super
[2:23:08] race as she nears him
[2:23:10] not a normal church the promised world
[2:23:14] to you
[2:23:15] is a super church a super race
[2:23:18] as she near the headstone okay
[2:23:22] watch day in the bride will be
[2:23:25] so much like him
[2:23:27] [Music]
[2:23:29] you know people's behavior so off you
[2:23:31] have none with christ
[2:23:33] day in the bride will be like him
[2:23:37] that day will be in his very image
[2:23:40] do you believe that yes someone like
[2:23:43] mary there but how shall this be no
[2:23:45] it come in this is in order to be united
[2:23:49] with him
[2:23:50] they will be one there will be the very
[2:23:53] manifestation of the word of the living
[2:23:56] god
[2:23:57] denominations cannot produce this i'm
[2:24:00] finishing
[2:24:01] true the members of the bride will be
[2:24:04] fulfilled
[2:24:05] what was promised of god to be manifest
[2:24:08] in the virgin
[2:24:09] the word of promise came to the virgin
[2:24:10] mary but the word of promise was he
[2:24:13] himself
[2:24:14] to remain manifest god
[2:24:17] was made manifest he himself here we go
[2:24:20] ready
[2:24:21] acted at that time and fulfill his own
[2:24:24] word of promise
[2:24:25] in the virgin it was an angel that
[2:24:27] brought the message
[2:24:29] but the angel's message was the word of
[2:24:30] god isaiah 9 6
[2:24:32] he fulfilled at that time and the
[2:24:35] members of the bride will love him
[2:24:37] they will have his potentials for he is
[2:24:40] their head
[2:24:41] here's the secret the wood is in the
[2:24:43] bride
[2:24:44] as it was in mary the bride has the mind
[2:24:47] of christ
[2:24:48] for she knows what he wants done with
[2:24:49] the word she performs
[2:24:51] the command of the word in his name and
[2:24:53] she has dusty as the lord
[2:24:55] then the word is quickened by the spirit
[2:24:58] and it comes to pass
[2:24:59] so the bride will have mechanical
[2:25:00] dynamic yo you speak the word
[2:25:03] and it quicken son delivered
[2:25:06] daughter you are free and you speak it
[2:25:08] the spirit just back it up like
[2:25:10] that and enforce the word your child
[2:25:13] have demons and them and they come home
[2:25:14] but you'd visit them
[2:25:15] they come home visiting normal normal
[2:25:17] and all of a sudden god inspired to
[2:25:19] speak the word
[2:25:19] and you back the devil right off of them
[2:25:23] and the seed in them come forward to
[2:25:24] receive presents because you are now
[2:25:26] anointed
[2:25:27] with the spirit oh my the bride has no
[2:25:30] revival yet
[2:25:31] there have been no revival there no
[2:25:33] manifestation of god to stood up right
[2:25:35] yet
[2:25:36] we are looking for it it will take those
[2:25:38] seven unknown thunders back there
[2:25:39] to wake her up he will send it he
[2:25:42] promised it
[2:25:43] so this is a promised word now i know
[2:25:44] it's coming because he promised it
[2:25:47] he will send it and he said what we see
[2:25:50] happen here
[2:25:51] should put every soul into action it
[2:25:53] should make a church that would make a
[2:25:54] revival in phoenix
[2:25:55] that people would fly from everywhere
[2:25:57] from europe to see what's taking place
[2:25:59] they would say there's a place in
[2:26:00] arizona called maricopa valley
[2:26:02] a city called phoenix there is something
[2:26:04] broke out here
[2:26:05] until the seven thunders of version 10
[2:26:07] that's not even wrote in the bible
[2:26:09] is being manifested i'm closing final
[2:26:12] thoughts
[2:26:13] the devil all these years he no
[2:26:15] interpretation
[2:26:16] he know men's idea he know the power
[2:26:18] when them were trying to imprison it he
[2:26:20] would say paul i know
[2:26:21] peter i know he know when somebody
[2:26:22] blocked him he no one is serious
[2:26:24] authority and badge of power is upon a
[2:26:27] man of god or woman or god
[2:26:28] the devil knows that the devil could
[2:26:30] recognize that
