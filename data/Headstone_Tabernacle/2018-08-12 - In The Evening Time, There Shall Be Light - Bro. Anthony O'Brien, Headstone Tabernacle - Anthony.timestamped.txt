[35:12] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[35:14] and the Spirit of God moved upon the
[35:18] face of the waters
[35:19] and God said let there be light and
[35:23] there was light and God saw the light
[35:27] that it was good
[35:30] and God divided the light from the
[35:33] darkness and God called the light day
[35:36] and the darkness he called night and the
[35:40] evening and the morning were the first
[35:42] day

[36:07] darkness the people but the Lord shall
[36:10] arise upon thee and his glory shall be
[36:13] seen upon thee and the Gentiles shall a

[43:17] my subject is recognizing your teen it's
[43:21] message and my inspiration is the Word
[43:25] made flesh a man and a man 11 this
[43:28] morning so praise God today's would I
[43:31] trust is a word of inspiration to you a
[43:33] word of inspiration from the law we need
[43:37] to be inspired if the Word of God is not
[43:40] inspired to us then it's just words that
[43:43] we're hearing then it's just Church that
[43:45] we're coming to then it's just a
[43:47] building but when God is here it becomes
[43:50] more than a building when card is here
[43:53] it becomes born in a church but you've
[43:55] got to be inspired you've got to be in
[43:58] the spirit of the comment of the Lord
[44:01] you got to be looking for his comment
[44:03] watching for us coming
[44:06] waiting for his comment praying for his
[44:08] common seeking for his comment oh
[44:11] because he is comment oh mary don't
[44:17] recognize it but jesus said a little
[44:21] while and the world will see me no more
[44:23] they were going to their lolly and they
[44:26] will say all nor delay it is coming but
[44:28] you shall see me because I lived she
[44:32] shall live also and greater works and
[44:35] this shall you - because I go unto my
[44:38] father Oh hallelujah hallelujah
[44:40] hallelujah when you realize when you
[44:45] recognize your Tay in your message you
[44:48] will do the greater works same and
[44:52] somebody God's Word must be inspired a
[45:02] man you mind if I take my time this
[45:05] morning but when it's inspired it comes
[45:10] to life to you the individual and that's
[45:14] when we hear it that's when we recognize
[45:17] it and that's when we're ready to act
[45:20] upon it isn't that right and then when
[45:24] we become convinced and then concerned
[45:27] about the time and the season and the
[45:29] day that we're living in Holly is now so
[45:34] the Holy Ghost wants to come in more
[45:35] than ever before and place the church
[45:38] positionally it's now but it's been
[45:41] bound by creeds bound by talk much but
[45:45] in the evening time there shall be
[45:47] lights
[45:48] that's a promise this morning I don't
[45:50] care how bad you feel I don't care how
[45:53] messed up you feel in the evening time
[45:55] in the top time in the shadows of the
[45:59] dying world there shall be light
[46:03] oh you're not hearing me this morning Oh
[46:06] hallelujah if you heard me this morning
[46:09] we'd have to fix the roof because you'll
[46:11] be on your feet Oh hallelujah don't
[46:18] worry we're gonna get to well what is
[46:23] the line well in order for us to
[46:26] understand what the line is we have to
[46:29] go back to Genesis isn't that right we
[46:32] have to go back to that original light
[46:34] that God spoke in the beginning so let's
[46:38] go back now Genesis 1 says that when God
[46:41] made the heavens and the earth that he
[46:44] earth was without form and was was void
[46:48] and there was darkness so here was three
[46:53] problems that we have the first problem
[46:56] is it without it was without form which
[46:59] means the earth was in chaos it lay in
[47:03] ruin it lay confused it was messed up
[47:08] there was also another problem the earth
[47:11] was void it was void of life there was
[47:15] nothing in it try and imagine a world
[47:18] with no animal life no human life no
[47:23] living creature nothing in it just the
[47:26] deadness of silence
[47:27] it was void of life Freud of action void
[47:32] of movement Oh hallelujah hallelujah
[47:37] furthermore it was another problem there
[47:41] was also doctors you couldn't see
[47:44] anything because there was nothing to
[47:47] see there was no light at all
[47:50] there was nothing anywhere Oh hallelujah
[47:54] what a condition
[47:55] sounds like the condition that some
[47:57] people find themselves in Freud of life
[48:00] without form pop this all over can't
[48:05] find a space
[48:07] and find nothing Paulo trying hard to
[48:09] prayer feel like you can't find your way
[48:12] I feel like God is here too small to do
[48:16] something different to speak a word into
[48:20] season spoken word into season how could
[48:25] it is so is what up for it was void
[48:45] empty and it was talk there was no light
[48:50] in there at all so then the only way God
[48:54] decided to move forward because even if
[48:58] he wanted to give the earth form we
[49:01] still have to see what we were doing
[49:03] I didn't order to deal with the voidness
[49:07] in order to deal with the emptiness we
[49:10] still have to see what we do in there
[49:13] was a problem that he had to deal with
[49:15] this problem of darkness stood in God's
[49:19] Way of doing something about the earth
[49:22] that he had created in the earth he had
[49:25] created were seeds and those seeds were
[49:29] predestinated to bring for life to bring
[49:32] forth herb yielding fruits to bring
[49:35] forth trees but they were covered over
[49:37] by this darkness oh there was a boy
[49:42] there was emptiness there was nothing Oh
[49:44] hallelujah hallelujah and god looked at
[49:47] the darkness and he didn't argue with
[49:49] the darkness he didn't complain with the
[49:52] darkness he didn't have a meeting in the
[49:54] darkness he didn't issue a warrant to
[49:56] the darkness he didn't get back to the
[49:58] darkness he didn't get upset with the
[50:00] darkness he didn't get out of the
[50:02] atmosphere when he approached the
[50:04] darkness no no no no no all God had to
[50:08] do was speak a word
[50:11] and God said Let there be lights part is
[50:18] now worried about the topless this

[1:00:19] a sprinkle don't be satisfied now stay
[1:00:23] hungry
[1:00:24] you're gonna get it priest corny man
[1:00:27] believe it all all my heart
[1:00:29] Oh hallelujah a man a man
[1:00:33] Oh hallelujah oh now you didn't argue
[1:00:37] with the darkness he simply spoke a word
[1:00:40] to the darkness and he said to the
[1:00:43] darkness let there be light
[1:00:45] and there was much isn't that right
[1:00:48] hallelujah has no more argument there
[1:00:51] was no more fuss there was no more
[1:00:53] debate all of the chaos all of the ruin
[1:00:56] was dealt with hallelujah in the first
[1:00:59] four when he spoke let there be light
[1:01:02] isn't that right hallelujah
[1:01:06] now what is darkness darkness is defined
[1:01:11] as the absence of light so when there is
[1:01:14] no light then ultimately we get darkness
[1:01:18] it's now when there's no presence of
[1:01:21] light when there's no other positive
[1:01:23] influence the only other default
[1:01:26] position is darkness
[1:01:28] isn't that right holiday it means and it
[1:01:32] was such an encouragement to me as I
[1:01:34] studied this here it means that if
[1:01:37] darkness is the absence of light then
[1:01:39] that means darkness is not really an
[1:01:41] actual force darkness is not really an
[1:01:46] energy light has the energy the Prophet
[1:01:50] said from light comes life but out of
[1:01:54] darkness nothing can come it means that
[1:02:00] when we turn on a light darkness has to
[1:02:03] find its place it means that the devil
[1:02:10] this morning doesn't really have any
[1:02:12] power he has no power over the blood
[1:02:18] wash once because when there is light
[1:02:22] darkness butterfly on back death must
[1:02:28] know its master because the kings of the
[1:02:31] earth have come back to take back from
[1:02:33] the enemy what he took from us he took
[1:02:37] our children we're gonna take it back if
[1:02:40] he took your joy we're gonna take it
[1:02:43] right back and if there's darkness in
[1:02:45] your life
[1:02:46] if there's tapas in your home this
[1:02:49] morning
[1:02:50] oh yes
[1:02:59] Satan is powerless this morning the
[1:03:03] devil is confused this morning mr. Tekin
[1:03:06] - because when a light comes forth the
[1:03:10] tightness has the finest place the
[1:03:12] darkness has to be pushed back to make
[1:03:15] our theatres here the left you know that
[1:03:19] he is here to begin his reign he is here
[1:03:21] to take control of your situation maybe
[1:03:25] it's too hard
[1:03:26] maybe it's so powerful but there's no
[1:03:29] power like all God he is your eternal
[1:03:32] power is your eternal life that's why
[1:03:45] the Bible says resist the devil he is
[1:03:48] freed from you miss him seven ways
[1:03:52] praise God because a light of God
[1:03:55] scatters a cockroach's scatters art
[1:03:58] apples left and right hallelujah and the
[1:04:02] light produces a life Jesus Christ and a
[1:04:11] life is seven furnish all the mystery
[1:04:15] the coming of the Lord and if these
[1:04:18] things be in you and abound
[1:04:19] you shall neither be barren nor
[1:04:22] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[1:04:25] Jesus Christ and keep in a world that is
[1:04:28] print corruption through love
[1:04:31] [Music]
[1:04:38] my god Olivia oh I don't know my Holy
[1:04:48] Spirit is here you just ride he anointed
[1:04:50] a man he just dropped down already
[1:04:53] the temple is on the run the pebble is
[1:04:56] running priest caught what we reach boy
[1:04:59] stung by now I see them on the way out
[1:05:02] praise God
[1:05:03] you have the victory this morning you
[1:05:05] have to pick you right now hallelujah
[1:05:07] praise God a man
[1:05:13] mine so the power of that light is more
[1:05:21] powerful than the power of darkness it's
[1:05:25] not really a power where there's no
[1:05:28] light the default position is darkness
[1:05:31] so where there's no positive influence
[1:05:33] in the community the young boys well you
[1:05:36] know they get up to him and get up the
[1:05:38] trouble stealing robbing weed whatever
[1:05:42] that's the default that's a natural
[1:05:44] position that's a normal position when
[1:05:47] there's no positive influence because we
[1:05:49] were born and sin shaped in iniquity and
[1:05:52] come into the world speaking lies so
[1:05:55] therefore some higher power some higher
[1:05:58] influence has to influence us not from
[1:06:03] here but from above not on the ground
[1:06:07] level but solely from up there a vision
[1:06:11] we got to be caught up in to catch a
[1:06:14] higher love to be in a higher place to
[1:06:18] see what's coming to see what chord is
[1:06:20] trying to show us Oh glory to God Amen
[1:06:25] young people it makes you walk different
[1:06:28] when you see it from a different
[1:06:30] perspective that's all the time you've
[1:06:33] seen it from your eyes how you feel how
[1:06:37] you are going through and what what's
[1:06:39] going in your mind but when you raise up
[1:06:41] into the mind of God and to his purpose
[1:06:45] and to his program and to what he wants
[1:06:48] for your life
[1:06:49] then it changes the way you walk changes
[1:06:52] the way you talk changes the way you see
[1:06:55] things changes the way you approach this
[1:06:57] gospel this word praise God because
[1:07:01] you're operating by God's divine
[1:07:03] revelation hallelujah
[1:07:08] open up second round what speaking to
[1:07:12] you you man now watch now watch he said
[1:07:16] now let it be like okay so God is the
[1:07:20] original power God is the original light
[1:07:24] that came forth and darkness had to find
[1:07:26] its place so when God said let it be
[1:07:29] like God saw it was light a man is never
[1:07:32] now this light is not a natural light
[1:07:35] remember the Nick Genesis 1:12
[1:07:38] 2:24 this light is not a natural light
[1:07:42] oh we're talking about but it is a
[1:07:44] supernatural language
[1:07:45] remember he spoke it in the beginning
[1:07:47] well when we go down to Genesis 1 12 to
[1:07:52] 14 hey Randy can you find it
[1:07:54] man you put it up here man so you'll see
[1:07:56] it and God said Let there be lights in
[1:07:58] the firmament of the heaven to divide
[1:08:00] the day from the night and let them be
[1:08:03] for signs and for seasons and for days
[1:08:05] and years I let them be for lights in
[1:08:08] the firmament of the heaven to give
[1:08:10] light upon the earth and it was so and
[1:08:12] God made two great lights the greater
[1:08:15] light to rule the day and the lesser
[1:08:17] light to rule the night and he made the
[1:08:20] stars also hey man thank you so that's
[1:08:24] what we're talking about is the Sun
[1:08:25] that's the moon that's the Sun that's
[1:08:29] the light he gave four times that's the
[1:08:31] light he gave four season that's the
[1:08:33] light he give four years but in order
[1:08:35] for God to do his work in the beginning
[1:08:37] there was a light that came before all
[1:08:39] those lights
[1:08:40] that's a light we're talking about this
[1:08:42] morning I'm not talking about a natural
[1:08:45] light but I'm talking about that light
[1:08:47] he spoke in the beginning that is the
[1:08:50] original lunch not the SU and lunch but
[1:08:54] the Esso and lights
[1:08:56] that is a light you feel this morning in
[1:08:58] this tabernacle
[1:09:00] that's what drop-down this morning
[1:09:03] hallelujah the original light
[1:09:07] Florina car now watch that was the Sun
[1:09:12] the Moon the Stars but he said let there
[1:09:13] be light and then he said he left that
[1:09:16] light be separated from all other lights
[1:09:19] because after he saw a flash he said
[1:09:23] this light is good and after that the
[1:09:26] Bible said he separated the light from
[1:09:29] the darkness
[1:09:30] so anything outside of the air so and
[1:09:34] lunch is talking but a Panem said let
[1:09:37] every man's word be I like I let parts
[1:09:41] would be true if God spoke it it's got
[1:09:44] to happen because that is the original
[1:09:47] light he was how much he was the light
[1:09:51] of all man and a word became flesh and
[1:09:55] not flesh brother Mallis and we beheld
[1:09:58] his glory the same chlorine appropiate
[1:10:01] innovated let's say glory through Tomas
[1:10:05] and he said when you see me you see that
[1:10:08] light when you see me you see the father
[1:10:14] the father me I don't back there you
[1:10:17] shall know I am in my father the father
[1:10:20] would build me and I will peel you and
[1:10:24] you in me what pain this thing that was
[1:10:35] your original light now ride with me now
[1:10:37] we going somewhere
[1:10:38] how was your regional life it took the
[1:10:41] like to declare the day because when God
[1:10:44] saw the light he said that I like was
[1:10:46] good he was pleased with her lunch he
[1:10:49] rejoiced with her lunch he was uh he was
[1:10:52] happy about that lunch and it if I call
[1:10:55] that light a and he called the darkness
[1:10:58] night so anything that is outside of the
[1:11:01] talk outside of the light that's in the
[1:11:03] darkness that's in a nighttime
[1:11:05] hallelujah that's out
[1:11:07] McChord separated it like from darkness
[1:11:10] tape from night it's not hallelujah
[1:11:14] hallelujah hallelujah glory and afoot in
[1:11:18] the morning and evening was the first
[1:11:20] day all right
[1:11:21] you think in the morning rather a mine
[1:11:23] so here was hey man you lovin this
[1:11:27] morning you man the prophet said now he
[1:11:29] said the Sun is the king of all the
[1:11:31] lights on this earth in a natural light
[1:11:34] no matter how much artificial light that
[1:11:36] we can have and how many great electric
[1:11:38] rays we can produce he said but when
[1:11:40] that Sun rises all the rest of them dim
[1:11:44] out that's the same thing with the Word
[1:11:47] of God he said when the Word of God
[1:11:49] raises all of the superstitions all of
[1:11:53] the denominational fanaticism zand
[1:11:55] things spread away and it shows just
[1:11:59] exactly what it is God in the beginning
[1:12:02] said let there be light and the light
[1:12:05] only comes the true light the king light
[1:12:08] only comes by the Word of God
[1:12:11] the outer speakers then a manifestation
[1:12:15] can take place afterwards in the light
[1:12:18] of God only comes by the Word of God
[1:12:22] isn't that right hallelujah is not right
[1:12:25] God separated the light from the
[1:12:28] darkness in the beginning and the Word
[1:12:31] of God was made manifest
[1:12:33] I always separates the light from the
[1:12:36] darkness
[1:12:37] I'll see that again the Word of God made
[1:12:40] manifests always separates the light
[1:12:44] from the darkness the Word of God when
[1:12:49] me manifests always separates the light
[1:12:54] from the darkness when the Word of God
[1:12:56] produces a life when the Word of God
[1:12:59] produces another fishin's when the Word
[1:13:02] of God produces another original church
[1:13:04] another original branch and it separates
[1:13:08] everything else call it self praise God
[1:13:11] then it comes back to the original
[1:13:14] and I don't care what fanaticism what
[1:13:17] they preach what they say God will
[1:13:20] always point you back to the word back
[1:13:23] to the original your retina like the
[1:13:27] original life your original holy fire
[1:13:30] that said on the day of Pentecost that's
[1:13:33] what we're going back to that is the
[1:13:36] tale that we are living in right now
[1:13:39] it's gotta come back to the original
[1:13:42] life oh I'm getting a little ahead of
[1:13:51] myself
[1:13:51] hey man alrighty anointing this morning
[1:13:54] man you feel his presence get a lot of
[1:13:56] shot of free he said no separate
[1:14:12] electron doctors right so the Word of
[1:14:14] God made manifest I want to drive this
[1:14:16] down would've court made manifest always
[1:14:21] separates the light from the darkness so
[1:14:23] we've got to have a burden this morning
[1:14:25] to become a manifestation because God is
[1:14:29] longing to reproduce themselves in sons
[1:14:32] and daughters of God so God is not happy
[1:14:36] God is not satisfied until we become a
[1:14:39] manifestation of this then when we
[1:14:42] manifest this when we manifest in John
[1:14:45] 14:12 when we manifest st. Pete 2nd
[1:14:49] Peter 1:4 to 7 then God is pleased to
[1:14:53] dwell in you my God my god people can
[1:15:05] rise up with this or that or the other
[1:15:07] isms can rise communism fascism all
[1:15:11] other isms can rise up superstitions
[1:15:15] cults whatever it may be interpretations
[1:15:19] Dogma screech all kind of men's ideas
[1:15:22] men thoughts Messel of the people
[1:15:25] messing up the churches messing up good
[1:15:27] people
[1:15:28] but false doctrines false teachings
[1:15:31] false Christ's will rise up lean away
[1:15:34] silly women will laden with diverse loss
[1:15:37] they have not recognized they're telling
[1:15:40] their message oh and a prophet cried out
[1:15:43] against them you have not recognized
[1:15:45] your day you have not recognized your

[1:24:29] standing a captive spot don't stop

[1:24:36] disable the push what we in the spirit
[1:25:25] now we all beat down wonderful now he
[1:25:32] says just like in each age quarters for
[1:25:36] told us what would take place any change
[1:25:38] the only thing he needs is a
[1:25:40] manifestation of the light upon that
[1:25:43] scripture it's not the manifestation of
[1:25:47] the light needs to come upon second
[1:25:48] Peter 1:4 - seven - come upon revelation
[1:25:51] 22:17 the manifestation of the light
[1:25:54] it's not right to make it live for that
[1:25:58] age and it would do it as long as a
[1:26:01] Lycan kept to the word as long as the
[1:26:05] light can get to that seed in your soul
[1:26:07] then it then sonic punch something
[1:26:11] reacts because it's a law that's put
[1:26:13] into motion in now I remember in the
[1:26:18] days of Wesley they were so sanctified
[1:26:21] that the Holy Ghost would want to fall
[1:26:24] upon the people and they will want to
[1:26:26] baptize them but it wasn't the days yet
[1:26:29] for that to happen
[1:26:30] so they would throw buckets on the
[1:26:32] people I think it was alright to get
[1:26:34] them out of their spirit before that
[1:26:35] take place because if it did it would
[1:26:38] change the season but what that showed
[1:26:40] us is that there's a law that's put into
[1:26:43] motion and every time you meet God's
[1:26:45] requirements every time you meet God's
[1:26:48] conditions you in the right conditions
[1:26:51] then certain things will take place and
[1:26:54] if you are sanctified if you are holy
[1:26:57] then the holy spirit it's very
[1:27:01] attractive
[1:27:02] it's very excited about a person like
[1:27:05] that it wants to fall upon him Oh
[1:27:08] hallelujah
[1:27:10] because it's a law that's put into
[1:27:13] motion if my people shall humble
[1:27:16] themselves and pray and seek my face and
[1:27:20] turn from their wicked ways then I will
[1:27:23] hear from heaven I will he can forgive
[1:27:26] their sin I will heal Ellen that's
[1:27:29] called fern and he will manifest it when
[1:27:38] God's people begin to pray for the Lord
[1:27:41] to have his way then the Spirit of the
[1:27:44] Lord is coming down when you begin to
[1:27:47] get into obedience to the whole Word of
[1:27:51] God that everything that God told you to
[1:27:53] do now hallelujah your ABCs always
[1:27:57] believed Christ sanctified holy
[1:28:00] separating yourself from all unbelief
[1:28:03] when you begin to do that the Holy Ghost
[1:28:06] the same Holy Spirit fell on the day of
[1:28:10] Pentecost is obligated to meet you
[1:28:13] on the basis of his promised word
[1:28:16] [Applause]

[1:28:43] because if somebody's delivered and the
[1:28:46] work of God is finished
[1:28:47] doesn't matter what I have written here
[1:28:49] but the work of God must be accomplished

[1:29:19] when you begin to get into right
[1:29:20] atmosphere in a right condition God will
[1:29:24] speak from heaven and this world will
[1:29:27] help direct from God and there is
[1:29:32] another people in the land you another
[1:29:35] Messenger will be the final voice to the
[1:29:38] final age and a final junction of time
[1:29:41] right now an inland time there shall be
[1:29:45] like Oh hurry along you know he said you
[1:30:00] might plant wheat you might plant wheat
[1:30:02] at one time or grain at another time
[1:30:05] some comes slower than others because it
[1:30:07] depends on the season but God's word
[1:30:10] comes in a season it's not the law and
[1:30:15] grace and so forth as we went on to the
[1:30:17] ages and each time it is lit up by the
[1:30:20] manifestation of the light spreading
[1:30:23] forth the life that is in the sea the
[1:30:27] life comes from the light is now right
[1:30:28] and we realize that God's light of the
[1:30:31] day is his son the one was as you
[1:30:34] but this one was s o n s o n is the
[1:30:40] biome is now right he was in the
[1:30:43] beginning was a word and the word was
[1:30:45] with god and the word was God Hebrews
[1:30:48] 13:8 he's the same yesterday today and
[1:30:51] forever it's the Word of God always it
[1:30:54] was Christ that wasn't Noah
[1:30:56] it was Christ that wasn't Moses it was
[1:30:59] Christ in David that looked up as a
[1:31:01] rejected king upon the city when 800
[1:31:04] years later Christ set their weeping
[1:31:06] over a city being himself a rejected
[1:31:10] king just like David was isn't that
[1:31:12] right it was always the spirit of Christ
[1:31:15] and the full manifestation of God's Word
[1:31:19] made known through Jesus Christ is the
[1:31:23] Spirit of God and that's what they were
[1:31:26] doing that's the reason they did that
[1:31:27] because they were living now what she's
[1:31:30] talking about something else now I'm
[1:31:32] talking about a man people got caught up
[1:31:34] interpretation he said they are living
[1:31:35] in the glare of another light a man or
[1:31:38] they're living in little clay of a past
[1:31:39] light it's not right they're living in a
[1:31:42] glare of the light of another day and
[1:31:45] that's what I believe he said is a
[1:31:47] matter with the world today friends it's
[1:31:49] because we're trying to live in the
[1:31:51] glare of a light that shine in another
[1:31:54] day a glare is a false light just like a
[1:31:58] mirage on a road he said we go down the
[1:32:01] road and we see a mirage it's a false
[1:32:03] conception of the Sun and when you get
[1:32:07] there it hasn't produced a thing but
[1:32:09] something false because you cannot walk
[1:32:12] in the glare of the Sun because it's a
[1:32:14] mirage always showing you something that
[1:32:16] there's nothing to and when people try
[1:32:19] to tell you that Jesus Christ isn't the
[1:32:21] same yesterday today and forever they're
[1:32:24] leading you to a mirage any time someone
[1:32:28] preaches something that is outside of
[1:32:30] this gospel outside of this Bible
[1:32:33] outside of the correct interpretation
[1:32:35] they are leading you into a mirage
[1:32:38] that's all and when you get into church
[1:32:42] and then you join maybe a church or some
[1:32:45] cold creed or something like that
[1:32:46] there's nothing there
[1:32:48] no more than what you had in the world
[1:32:50] from separation or unbelief the bible
[1:32:53] says oh we believe that God is a great
[1:32:55] God yes and we read back there where he
[1:32:59] was with the people about 2,000 years
[1:33:00] ago the Prophet said that's intellectual
[1:33:03] that's something that God did that's
[1:33:06] like a man he said freezing to death and
[1:33:09] a paint him and we paint him a big fire
[1:33:12] on the wall and say look what a
[1:33:14] beautiful fire that was see this picture
[1:33:17] here well he had a fire to come
[1:33:20] look how everybody was getting warm but
[1:33:22] everybody was getting warm then but what
[1:33:25] about you you can't get warm by a
[1:33:28] painted fire you've got to have the fire
[1:33:31] itself

[1:45:33] team meets back to the world back to the
[1:45:36] Bible back to the original back to the
[1:45:39] foundation that was laid on the day of
[1:45:42] Pentecost or in the day of Pentecost was
[1:45:45] fully come it was in one mind
[1:45:47] there wasn't one Accord why because a
[1:45:51] Word of God was open to them they were
[1:45:53] with Jesus thirty forty days
[1:45:56] and he unlocked their thinking he
[1:45:58] unlocked their minds I saw who they were
[1:46:00] who God was who that pepper was and then
[1:46:04] you by revelation what they had to
[1:46:07] receive and they were there praying
[1:46:09] continually in the spirit and in those
[1:46:12] days stood up among them and said this
[1:46:16] Jesus of whom we were witnesses who was
[1:46:20] slain on a cross and hung on a tree to
[1:46:22] die it's now exalted at a right hand of
[1:46:25] God and he told us a Terry in Jerusalem
[1:46:28] and pray without ceasing I'd stay on the
[1:46:31] expectation I've beat on them by
[1:46:34] inspiration beginning to put the church
[1:46:37] in order and they cast lots and Matthias
[1:46:40] was cultivate them as much but the Bible
[1:46:43] said and when the day of Pentecost was
[1:46:46] fully come they were in one mind they
[1:46:49] won't want to cause and all of a sudden
[1:46:51] all of a sudden they heard a sound come
[1:46:55] from heaven son of a Russian might you
[1:46:58] in that sound swept into the house and
[1:47:01] we get a baptized individuals into the
[1:47:05] kingdom of God everyone received their
[1:47:09] look a fire this morning we come to
[1:47:13] receive our own little pile we are not
[1:47:16] satisfied we are not a happy until the
[1:47:19] Holy Spirit comes into our soul and
[1:47:22] gives us a birth of the Holy Ghost and
[1:47:25] fire another noise once more Lord once
[1:47:30] more Lord we declare that the time is at
[1:47:34] hand but a bride to be sealed before a
[1:47:38] hundred forty-four thousand the bride

[1:47:56] course we need the Holy Ghost run out

[1:48:59] time we have left but recognize your day
[1:49:02] recognize your message is small and
[1:49:05] recognize who we are it's time to wake
[1:49:08] up shake the dust off get next to
[1:49:12] ourselves we don't have much time left
[1:49:14] this is the closing this is the last
[1:49:18] chapter of the world as we know it one
[1:49:21] day it will explode God Himself the word
[1:49:26] alone with it will remain standing
[1:49:28] everything else will pass away I already
[1:49:36] swore by himself time should be no more
[1:49:39] the angel truck down from heaven clothed
[1:49:43] with a cloud rainbow upon his head what
[1:49:47] was that rainbow refraction of the pure
[1:49:50] light of God the glory of the Lord that
[1:49:53] surrounds us he is that pure white light
[1:49:57] and when science says when our white
[1:50:00] light is refracted through a glass prism
[1:50:02] there's a rainbow that sprays out
[1:50:05] and it's a natural type of the glory of
[1:50:08] the law that when the pure white light
[1:50:11] of the world is in you then we reflect
[1:50:15] seven rainbow glories
[1:50:18] seven rainbow colors the presence of
[1:50:21] light is what brings forth the colors
[1:50:23] not the darkness but we like the
[1:50:27] original light of God seven rainbow
[1:50:36] colors seven attributes of God hate
[1:50:40] putting knowledge temperance patience
[1:50:41] calling as brotherly kindness charity
[1:50:44] amen
[1:50:45] if these things be in you and abound
[1:50:48] then you have escaped the corruption
[1:50:51] that is in the world through lust oh
[1:50:54] that's why we give all diligence
[1:50:56] remember the lectures that add to our
[1:50:59] faith virtue and to offer to knowledge
[1:51:01] and to a knowledge temperance but he
[1:51:05] that lacketh these things is blind and
[1:51:08] has not recognized that day in their
[1:51:10] message hallelujah here and look at
[1:51:15] these things that still coming to church
[1:51:17] it's Ted playing church but without the
[1:51:22] Holy Ghost prophet said you're lost what
[1:51:28] you're gonna receive it because your
[1:51:30] sons because you're taught us because
[1:51:32] your children of the light you must
[1:51:35] receive that light we didn't hear it

[1:51:40] voice a stranger's voice they will not
[1:51:42] follow Oh hallelujah but you cannot be
[1:51:44] lost because a seed of God remains in

[1:52:08] children and as many as the Lord our God
[1:52:10] shall call Oh hallelujah praise God

[1:52:17] the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah ask
[1:52:21] for it see an expectation for it now
[1:52:25] only the sons of God
[1:52:27] it does not appear what we shall be but
[1:52:30] we know that when he shall begin to up
[1:52:32] here and we have seen his appearing he
[1:52:36] has appeared in a prophet that probably
[1:52:38] lived just like Jesus until the people
[1:52:41] took him for Jesus and he said no it's
[1:52:43] not me don't worship Me but worship Him
[1:52:46] look to Jesus the author and finisher of
[1:52:49] your faith he's the one that doesn't
[1:52:51] miracles I must decrease and he must
[1:52:55] increase hallelujah hallelujah I'm
[1:52:59] pulling away but there's a bride coming
[1:53:01] on eh she'll be without spots
[1:53:04] she'll be a not wrinkled washing of
[1:53:06] blood on a lamb when the prophet saw
[1:53:08] that bride in division she was marching
[1:53:11] in step
[1:53:11] she was marching in holiness she was

[1:54:29] creature in Christ Jesus don't walk in
[1:54:32] some glare of another age that glare
[1:54:34] been made alright for them it's been
[1:54:36] alright for them it's not right
[1:54:38] the Jews taught that they were
[1:54:39] worshipping the true light they thought
[1:54:41] that they were worshiping the same God
[1:54:42] that they were turning down the very one
[1:54:45] that they thought they were worshipping
[1:54:47] they will crucify they were making fun
[1:54:50] of the very God and making him a
[1:54:52] laughingstock of the people the very god
[1:54:55] that they thought they were worship in
[1:54:57] may I say this with reverence and
[1:54:59] respect the Prophet says but to bring
[1:55:01] light because as our brothers said a
[1:55:04] while ago we're living later than you
[1:55:05] think we are and he said one of these
[1:55:07] days something is going to happen it's
[1:55:10] going to be too late and he said the
[1:55:13] people would take on the mark of the
[1:55:15] beast not knowing what they are doing
[1:55:19] blindly the blind and they all fall in
[1:55:22] the ditch jesus said and we're living
[1:55:24] later than we think many honest people
[1:55:27] follow that not even knowing what
[1:55:30] they're doing but he our is at hand now
[1:55:33] the prophets here oh he was always
[1:55:34] striking when a light is shining the
[1:55:38] gospel lights and in its power of the
[1:55:40] resurrection of Jesus Christ manifesting
[1:55:44] himself that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:55:47] yesterday the same today and the same
[1:55:51] forever he losted that for this day a
[1:55:53] man is known he lot it up for his knee
[1:55:57] the thing that he promised for this day
[1:56:00] must happen in this day if the church
[1:56:04] won't accept it then God is able of
[1:56:06] these stones to raise up children unto
[1:56:09] Abraham so if you don't want it called
[1:56:12] find a drunken porter find a prostitute
[1:56:15] but he said my table shall be full
[1:56:19] hallelujah but we are here this morning
[1:56:21] to recognize a call and to respond to
[1:56:25] the voice but when Jesus calls us this
[1:56:28] morning

[1:56:31] and we hear the voice of the Lord we
[1:56:34] heard him when we was in this church and
[1:56:36] when he was in that church when he was

[1:56:41] about with every wind of doctrine but a
[1:56:44] voice came to us my sheep know my voice

[2:00:22] purple netflix has sip on first love in
[2:00:25] their eye but God to these seven Church
[2:00:27] ages has restored a bride isn't that
[2:00:30] right holiday is not to the Reformers
[2:00:34] and in the day of Luther he brought back
[2:00:37] justification is now hallelujah that
[2:00:41] wasn't like for his day and every choice
[2:00:43] with that light and they love that light
[2:00:45] and a priest caught in a like they had a
[2:00:48] revival in my life but when it raised a
[2:00:51] little further when she came with a
[2:00:53] higher realm it's not holiday you must
[2:00:56] not all would also be justified because

[2:01:27] Duncan the Pentecostals in the open-door
[2:01:29] age and introduced her birth and the
[2:01:32] gifts and I wasn't even crate alight
[2:01:35] receiving a holy coach or holla you must
[2:01:38] be born again born of the Spirit
[2:01:41] hallelujah is not
[2:01:43] hallelujah but when the Prophet Malachi
[2:01:45] 4 came he introduced the fullness of the
[2:01:48] world so brother what they are we living
[2:01:51] in if we are living in the day when the
[2:01:55] Son of Man is being revealed and a
[2:01:57] fullest of the world is here then that
[2:01:59] means we have what it takes we have all

[2:02:34] increase and in Thomas right in the
[2:02:38] middle of all attached for a raise up a
[2:02:41] pot with power demonstration backing up

[2:02:49] hallelujah say to this mountain be moved
[2:02:54] and don't talk in your heart you can
[2:02:57] have whatever you ask for asking for
[2:03:00] rain in a time of the latter rain it's
[2:03:04] fictional form I'm getting ready to
[2:03:16] close out get ready preschool my god I'm
[2:03:25] excited
[2:03:26] do you know what's gonna happen do you
[2:03:28] know what's gonna take place these same
[2:03:30] young people who your thought was all
[2:03:32] broken up and all twisted up God the
[2:03:35] Prophet said will do in one year what
[2:03:37] all theologians fail to two and two
[2:03:40] thousand years because it won't be a
[2:03:42] work of man it won't be an intellectual
[2:03:45] work up by a bit of Ministry of the
[2:03:47] Spirit quicker than a word to the bride
[2:03:51] making you ready for a rapture
[2:03:57] halleluyah halleluyah
[2:04:00] so I see this morning the time has come
[2:04:04] but a word to be made flesh the time has
[2:04:07] come for the light of God the
[2:04:10] manifestation the Holy Spirit does shine
[2:04:12] for the light of God is narrowing
[2:04:14] oh praise God praise God hallelujah
[2:04:19] hallelujah my prophet said but if that
[2:04:27] tree keep raising her now but if that
[2:04:29] tree ever puts forth another original
[2:04:33] branch it will bear its original fruit
[2:04:35] the same food ours on Pentecost healings
[2:04:39] ceilings deliverances baptism of the
[2:04:42] Holy Ghost it will pay the original
[2:04:44] fruit and there's got to be a
[2:04:47] restoration of all these things right
[2:04:51] Hadi and loved the vine the Prophet said
[2:04:54] he has prophecy prophecy he said there
[2:04:57] is to comfort or restoration an evening
[2:05:01] like to light it up and make it right
[2:05:06] but it will come out of the vine not a
[2:05:10] denomination that's crafted it is but
[2:05:13] the original production of the word it
[2:05:15] is to comfort for the evening time there
[2:05:19] will be a light in the evening time it
[2:05:22] takes light to ripen it see your
[2:05:24] proofing the scripture is a day that
[2:05:26] won't be called day or night fruit kind
[2:05:29] of ripen here it is until the Sun
[2:05:31] ripened it no matter how much you preach
[2:05:34] whatever you do it cannot be ripened
[2:05:37] it cannot be manifested it cannot be
[2:05:40] vindicated only by him who said I am the
[2:05:44] light of the world the word is that
[2:05:48] right so there is it comfort as a power
[2:05:55] the Prophet said therefore it has to
[2:05:59] come forth as a power the Holy Spirit
[2:06:03] Himself not the work of man not man or
[2:06:07] Tufton one another nonsense but the Holy
[2:06:10] Spirit Himself must ripen 250k CH and
[2:06:15] proof and manifest that what he said
[2:06:18] what happened the Holy Ghost is gonna
[2:06:25] comfort in your heart in your life in
[2:06:28] your soul in this church as a power and
[2:06:33] anoint your soul the same original lunch

[2:07:00] they must come another Ephesians to this
[2:07:04] another original church where are the
[2:07:07] same signs that Jesus had in the
[2:07:10] beginning whenever the same signs that
[2:07:12] the Apostles had in the beginning it was
