[41:19] profit you except I speak to you either
[41:21] by revelation or by knowledge or by

[41:29] below life given song where the pipe or
[41:32] harp to accept the give a distinction in
[41:34] the songs
[41:35] how shall we be known what is piped or
[41:38] harped for if the trumpet give an
[41:41] uncertain sound who shall prepare
[41:43] himself to the battle
[41:46] let's go cross to Joshua 17 reading from
[41:53] verse 14
[42:03] and the children of Joseph speak unto
[42:05] Joshua seen why has thou given me but
[42:08] one lot and one portion to inherit
[42:12] seeing I am a great people for as much
[42:16] as the Lord had blessed me either to
[42:18] that's a question isn't the answer
[42:22] and Joshua answered them if there'll be
[42:25] a great people then get the up to the
[42:29] wood country and cut down for thyself
[42:33] deer in the land of the parasites and of
[42:37] the Giants if mount ephraim between
[42:40] narrow fizzy and the children of Joseph
[42:44] said the hill is not enough for us and
[42:46] all the killa nights the burning land of
[42:48] the valley have chariots of iron but
[42:50] they who are the chiyan and the towns

[42:55] Jezreel and Joshua speak unto the house
[42:59] of Joseph even to every and the man
[43:03] assessing daughter greet people and thou
[43:07] have great power

[43:13] but the mountain shall be dying for it
[43:17] is a wood and thou shall cut it down and
[43:19] and the old goings of it shall be dying
[43:22] for for for thou shall drive out the
[43:27] Canaanites though they have iron of
[43:29] chariots and though they be strong he
[43:33] put it right back into their hands

[43:37] stop the old talk possess your land
[43:39] take your mountain spread your borders
[43:43] we're too small for your take more all
[43:46] right let's go to Joshua chapter 90 now
[43:49] one verse verse 47 you know is the
[43:55] favorite loser man
[43:59] and the course of the cheering I've done
[44:02] went out too little for them therefore
[44:06] the children of Dan went up to fight
[44:08] against Liam and took it and smooth it
[44:13] with the edge of the sword and possessed
[44:16] it and murder in and call a sham dam
[44:20] after the name of Dan their father miss
[44:24] ball has father we thank you for your
[44:26] word and we just by reason that we feel
[44:29] inspired already father because we're
[44:32] your children we are sons and daughters
[44:33] gathered here today to hear from heaven
[44:37] father may heaven drop down this morning
[44:39] with your Norton that breaks every you
[44:41] come upon me Jesus and speak life to
[44:43] your people use these lips of clay and
[44:45] speak spirit spoken word may there be
[44:47] Devils cast out victory granted Lord God
[44:51] people set free people be healed and
[44:53] delivered even while the wood is going
[44:55] forward granted father in Jesus name I
[44:57] ask it amen and amen praise God for
[45:03] title you may be seated
[45:07] war in heaven and that Israeli for my
[45:15] inspiration which is from revelation
[45:17] 2:12 and it says with seven there was
[45:19] war in heaven Michael and his angels
[45:21] fought against the Dragon and the dragon
[45:23] fought and his angels the subject
[45:27] preparation for war for your inheritance
[45:30] and my inspiration is war in heaven so
[45:36] we see what the Lord will do for us
[45:47] the word seer CSW r which is profit it
[45:54] means it's the one that has the divine
[45:58] revelation of the written word that's
[46:01] what we talked about Goss and a prophet
[46:04] we not seeing that just to say quartz
[46:07] and a prophet it was prophesied that he
[46:10] will send Elijah the prophet this book
[46:15] we call the Bible that we wrestle of
[46:17] faith and poop on is the book of the
[46:19] prophets this is the book that that the
[46:22] Prophet spoke so when Jesus a man
[46:25] suddenly by bread alone but by every
[46:27] word that proceedeth amount of God that
[46:29] mount is his prophets so the motive was
[46:33] not in the sky somewhere looking between
[46:34] the clothes the Mount of God are his
[46:37] prophets which I his servants that bring
[46:41] divine revelation to the people the day
[46:46] is a move trying to get people to play
[46:48] by the banner message in the churches
[46:49] like if that is the Ministry of the
[46:51] brain the mistake for the Branham for
[46:54] like some faithful prophet he is not he
[46:58] is a he's a major prophet and he William
[47:02] Branham represented son of man because
[47:05] the promise was true that Elijah the son
[47:08] of man would be revealed the disciples
[47:11] represent the fight for ministry so
[47:13] Jesus had a ministry which was son of
[47:16] man ministry but the disciples had a
[47:19] ministry also which was passed the
[47:21] Prophet teacher evangelist to bring
[47:24] clarity to what the Son of man has
[47:26] unfolded
[47:27] so even when Jesus said go into all the
[47:30] world and teach them and baptize them in
[47:32] the name of the Father in the numerous
[47:33] Sun and even the holy oh that's what
[47:35] Jesus said but when Peter came he said
[47:37] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he
[47:40] said that to bring clarity to what it
[47:43] meant by in the name of the Father and
[47:45] of the Son and the Holy Ghost because
[47:47] father is not a name son is not a name
[47:49] almost none amine but the Lord Jesus
[47:51] Christ is the name
[47:55] Loreena God
[47:57] so caught have an anointed faithful
[47:59] ministry to bring clarity to the words
[48:02] of the Son of Man he said because the
[48:04] spirit and the prophet and the bride
[48:07] will say the same thing and what they
[48:09] say what I've already been said in the
[48:11] world have known you mystery that God
[48:14] never spoke to a prophet because a seer
[48:17] is a divine revealer of the written word
[48:20] Oh could we give the Lord a shout in the
[48:22] house so normal is asking atomic
[48:26] criticism made no difference to know how
[48:28] many criticized he was the light of the
[48:30] day he was the word manifested for that
[48:32] day Moses a great highly polished
[48:35] theologian great man bought to be a
[48:37] prophet yet in all his theology his book
[48:40] knowledge of God here we go could not
[48:44] deliver the journal Israel by knowledge
[48:47] so the information of the message
[48:49] defended in Verne's
[48:51] he said he could not deliver that
[48:53] journal Israelite knowledge you see the
[48:55] Prophet cannot go by knowledge he has
[48:58] got to go by inspiration hallelujah
[49:04] so then he went in the wilderness you
[49:07] know burning bush and then God revealed
[49:09] to him the words he spoke to Abraham I
[49:13] am the God of thy father's Abraham Isaac
[49:15] and Jacob and I told Abraham the sand
[49:18] the sand us I am the court atole Bram
[49:20] that and I come down to confirm what I
[49:23] spoke to Abraham so then God said in
[49:26] light upon the world so in other words
[49:28] he's not missing anything he's bringing
[49:30] clarity to what he spoke to Abraham God
[49:33] come on the back Abraham off but I spoke
[49:35] that to him that's why I'm here to tell
[49:37] you I told Abraham I people shall
[49:40] sojourn for 400 years and with a mighty
[49:42] and I bring them out I come to let you
[49:44] know you at that hand
[49:46] that I'm going to use to bring them out
[49:48] and all your experiences as the come to
[49:51] this part that you could be energized
[49:53] that you could be inspired that you
[49:56] could be anointed because I have a work
[49:59] for you to do and your head knowledge
[50:01] and book knowledge could accomplish it
[50:03] but the fire that I have released and
[50:18] Boram says what does it so mysteriously

[50:22] orbit I love that

[54:20] manatee our your flesh and but hold that
[54:23] whatever you want what will give you
[54:25] that's why you have to want the will of
[54:27] God that's why you have to be a peculiar
[54:32] because if you don't know what to fight
[54:35] in an open fight you will get likk up in
[54:37] this matter
[54:42] my mom says the people has never want to
[54:44] go to lead them they want their own way
[54:47] of leadership and when you go down to a
[54:50] home he said read a book the book true
[54:51] consider in that scripture the people
[54:54] had come to a place where they wanted to
[54:55] change his program they had looked upon
[54:57] the Philistines and Amalekites the
[54:59] amorite sit tight and the other nations
[55:00] of the world and this scene there a king
[55:03] that ruling govern them and guide them
[55:05] for their battles and they see their
[55:08] lies sickening when I hear somebody
[55:10] doing some kind of kooky thing and you
[55:11] see Anna she does do it he does do it so
[55:16] that because he does do it and she'll do
[55:17] it
[55:17] that gives you a license to do it to
[55:19] your consort God or you're watching
[55:22] others what they do it's not what others
[55:24] do is what you would see don't ever see
[55:28] what somebody else do always find out
[55:31] what the words say hope they do it today
[55:36] I shot in the house
[55:37] but I am this brother doing that that
[55:41] brother doing that that's just supposed
[55:43] as a church member supporters are spies
[55:45] on the enemy camp
[55:46] suppose they then send them to do just
[55:49] for you to see to do live a follow that
[55:54] you are called to follow the word if I
[55:58] go on off run for your life
[56:01] don't stare with me stay where the world
[56:06] [Applause]
[56:16] so they have they saw Kings that ruled
[56:18] them and govern them and guided them for
[56:20] him but and so forth and this seemed to
[56:22] be that Israel wanted to pattern
[56:24] themselves like these Kings these are
[56:26] the people but it has never been in any
[56:28] age God's intention for his people to
[56:32] act I the people of the world or be
[56:34] governed or control like the people of
[56:37] the world God's people has always been a
[56:39] peculiar people if you were wearing a
[56:42] red node or combat no erecting every
[56:45] world he is so and so and so the coming
[56:47] that they would have out it don't bring
[56:49] it here that's what they have out there
[56:50] now what kind of clothes cloth material
[56:53] that is what they have that is not what
[56:56] you want to get that is not what you
[56:58] want you are supposed to be a peculiar
[57:01] people different people people must see
[57:04] a different from a distance they must be
[57:06] a different the walk must speak

[1:03:16] understand us at war let's continue free
[1:03:20] is gone
[1:03:21] God or God is our ruler King what the
[1:03:26] people today seems to have that same
[1:03:27] idea
[1:03:28] I'm so on they don't seem to able to
[1:03:30] grasp that God still rules man
[1:03:33] instead of man ruling man the truth is
[1:03:36] have a man in soul sonic Kish reputable
[1:03:39] man another man not a bad guy
[1:03:41] nice guy when he got annoying to me
[1:03:43] feeling like a victim so you feel well
[1:03:45] good started off good you going off
[1:03:47] after a while
[1:03:47] listen to this and he's true to the
[1:03:50] people right he was great
[1:03:51] tall noble statue of a man the scripture
[1:03:54] said he was head and shoulders above any
[1:03:56] man in Israel he was kingly looking he
[1:03:58] was handsome in the face he was
[1:04:00] brilliant extraordinary man they say no
[1:04:03] like there's no like wait this is soul
[1:04:06] no that's the kind of man people like to
[1:04:09] choose today the people does not seem to
[1:04:11] be satisfied with the way that God
[1:04:13] placed his church to be government
[1:04:16] controlled by the Holy Spirit they want
[1:04:17] somebody some man some denomination
[1:04:20] certain people to govern the church that
[1:04:22] they will not be able to show themselves
[1:04:24] completely into the hands of God
[1:04:26] you see this is what happens because
[1:04:29] they go onto Twitter 70 hands of God dr.
[1:04:32] Phylis ever the hands of a man and after
[1:04:35] backup the man will no be like that back
[1:04:37] underdog when they feel somebody gonna
[1:04:40] fight back in that church but it on the
[1:04:42] dog is that if anybody on the door you
[1:04:44] won't come out and after 20 years 20
[1:04:45] years is still a criminal back on the
[1:04:49] door back you wait
[1:04:51] what a quarterback Matthew wood are you
[1:04:55] with me
[1:04:56] so watch so watch they want somebody to
[1:04:59] do their religion for them somebody to
[1:05:02] tell them just how to do it all about it
[1:05:04] so this man's in the suit and it's the
[1:05:06] whole luck today
[1:05:07] we like to choose such people to control
[1:05:09] our churches the cultural district God
[1:05:10] nothing I have against it but merely to
[1:05:13] make a point that it is not it was not
[1:05:15] it will never will be the will of God
[1:05:17] for such to be God is to rule the people
[1:05:20] that govern each individual are you with
[1:05:25] me let me find out his son of Kish his
[1:05:28] stature you seem to sue the people is
[1:05:29] roll up when I look great the crown on
[1:05:31] his head
[1:05:31] we have of the people green I said to
[1:05:33] the king of Israel for the other kings
[1:05:35] where our nation will think look at that
[1:05:37] land right know how they would point the
[1:05:39] thing I said look here what a great
[1:05:41] thing we got look what a great man that
[1:05:43] Rovers sad to see it's true today with
[1:05:46] the church they love to see overpasses
[1:05:48] now minded is the Greek man is a
[1:05:50] graduate from Harvard visuality ology he
[1:05:52] has four degrees out of sausage on the
[1:05:53] place is a very good mix among the
[1:05:55] people all that would be right but God's
[1:05:57] Way for his church is to be led by the
[1:05:59] Holy Ghost and by the spirit but they
[1:06:03] like to say we have this great
[1:06:04] denomination or we belong to we are
[1:06:06] started back in the early parodies we're
[1:06:08] in a minority very few people and small
[1:06:10] no we have grown until the place we have
[1:06:12] is it largest denomination there is we
[1:06:14] have the best schools the best educated
[1:06:16] ministers we have the best Rest crowds
[1:06:17] the most intellectual people and so
[1:06:19] forth God forbidden I should speak one
[1:06:20] word against that for that is all good
[1:06:22] but still it isn't the will of God that
[1:06:25] man should rule of a man here we go
[1:06:28] God sent on the day of Pentecost the
[1:06:31] Holy Ghost the rule in man's hawks and
[1:06:35] rule in his lives it was not meant for
[1:06:39] man to rule over them so if God gives
[1:06:42] you the Holy Ghost your Holy Ghost will
[1:06:45] respond to this word that coming from
[1:06:48] the horrible
[1:06:49] you will agree with what the word is

[1:25:30] but that is true because he's Jesus
[1:25:33] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:25:35] forever
[1:25:36] Oh glory to God amen so therefore my so
[1:25:44] people long as long as Samuel they like
[1:25:46] to live to six days anyway they want to
[1:25:48] live 6 days everyone to go to church on
[1:25:50] Sunday morning fine intellectual college
[1:25:52] graduate 20 degrees can speak a little
[1:25:54] sermon the few jokes were thick layers
[1:25:57] of course them to be entertained like
[1:25:59] some movie or television program several
[1:26:01] programs and them home with a
[1:26:02] self-satisfied security that they've
[1:26:05] done their religion that is not the will
[1:26:09] of the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit here
[1:26:12] we go are you ready Holy Spirit wants
[1:26:14] you to live godly every day in the week
[1:26:19] and every night separating yourself from
[1:26:22] the teeth of the world but I just don't
[1:26:24] want that they want our man who can
[1:26:26] interpret the Bible the way they want to
[1:26:28] hear it they won't listen to the voice
[1:26:30] of the Holy Spirit he can chew the bible
[1:26:36] scripture will never say that we
[1:26:42] brethren as Isaac was at the cheerin of
[1:26:43] the promise but as then he that was born
[1:26:46] after the flesh persecuted him that was
[1:26:48] born after the spirit even so it is now
[1:26:52] nevertheless what saith the scripture
[1:26:55] cast out the bondwoman and her son for
[1:26:57] the son of the bondwoman shall not be
[1:26:59] heir with the son of the freewoman
[1:27:02] so the chairman of the freewoman have a
[1:27:04] different inheritance altogether isn't
[1:27:06] that right so Balram said that's the
[1:27:08] reason I so firmly the nomes organized
[1:27:10] religion it cannot be heir with the
[1:27:14] original program of God because
[1:27:17] organization is not of God it's of man
[1:27:20] because the organized system separates
[1:27:23] Brotherhood so instead of people asking
[1:27:26] are you a Christian that actually what
[1:27:29] church you go to
[1:27:30] and depend upon what you say they pull
[1:27:33] the hand back way behind a hand or
[1:27:34] whatever it is separate Brotherhood do
[1:27:37] go here do go dear door dear I water
[1:27:40] because they saw one this one is Oh and
[1:27:41] the Prophet taught us every church have
[1:27:43] three kind of believers I thought was
[1:27:47] only one church but is every to examine
[1:27:49] you see so I cannot say this church have
[1:27:52] it and that one doesn't it doesn't work
[1:27:54] that way no church got even all the Holy
[1:27:56] Ghost the Holy Ghost take the trash out
[1:27:59] the church what the group can hold is
[1:28:01] the honey which is the forgiveness we
[1:28:04] could share that as a group something
[1:28:06] called sticky honey wait let's stick to
[1:28:09] it forgiveness oh yes that could be
[1:28:11] released to you as a group but the Holy
[1:28:13] Ghost is given to individuals so I just
[1:28:16] can't hold it that's what the words say
[1:28:19] holding understand that now no group
[1:28:21] could hold the Holy Ghost
[1:28:23] individuals can the holy ghost is poured
[1:28:27] on in individuals got the power in your
[1:28:30] up you can leave here with your portion
[1:28:32] today that's not doing me that's you and
[1:28:35] God I am NOT doing the filling God is
[1:28:41] doing the villain okay the Lord I show
[1:28:44] how many understand the man is not doing
[1:28:48] the filling it is God that is doing the
[1:28:50] filling you shall be filled with the
[1:28:54] Holy Ghost
[1:28:55] that's your promise or glory to God
[1:28:58] hallelujah glory
[1:29:01] so the foolish virgins and the wise
[1:29:04] virgins will not be together the foolish
[1:29:09] virgins inherit the tribulation the wise
[1:29:11] virgins are the rapture they are not
[1:29:14] going to end together or port a virgin's
[1:29:16] bought in the message but what a lawyer
[1:29:19] and welcome to oil okay the Lord I'll
[1:29:22] show them a house or ones out

[1:43:36] because Saturdays have these shoes other
[1:43:44] qualities marriage seminar had companies
[1:43:47] Mary oh my so therefore tree woman
[1:43:54] reflected his cumin seed first Sarah
[1:43:58] Higa and then Mary see if we started
[1:44:02] with Sarah
[1:44:02] she doubted Sarah got word that
[1:44:06] she would have a son she thought was
[1:44:07] true HEPA is interact Mary come she said
[1:44:10] be done unto me according to thy word
[1:44:12] and she received that seed but Mary
[1:44:14] wasn't the seed she was a carrier of the
[1:44:17] see that same Mary had to when the Upper
[1:44:19] Room to receive a portion of the holy
[1:44:21] people have been Donna me according to
[1:44:23] your word and a certain man she really
[1:44:24] would say to me that she she had to work
[1:44:28] quickly on her compete on equality with
[1:44:29] us but I said maybe with a broom she
[1:44:31] said never see it so she had a seat
[1:44:33] correctly you have to get poured in to
[1:44:37] baptism and kunis easier Oh in water you
[1:44:41] need the baptism of fire
[1:44:42] it means something to break upon you I
[1:44:45] would give your anchor whatever Eliezer
[1:44:46] didn't have that anchor when he turned a
[1:44:49] common lightning but I believe God was
[1:44:52] enlightened goblet under global degree
[1:44:54] when he heard the still small voice he
[1:44:57] knew he could move now he wrapped
[1:44:59] himself up because yeah
[1:45:01] you have to have a anchor that tells you
[1:45:04] this is the word speaking to you anchor
[1:45:07] and that anchor come by experience with
[1:45:09] God
[1:45:10] oh my so Mary I'll just skip that down
[1:45:16] listen the song let off the pressure
[1:45:17] baram talk about a way let off the steam
[1:45:19] you said it builds up the place it
[1:45:21] breaks up things it course to put off
[1:45:22] hard feelings then snap them out
[1:45:24] everybody's guilty of it I'm guilty
[1:45:26] you're guilty we all do things listen
[1:45:28] under pressure that we wouldn't do
[1:45:30] otherwise there's an excess pressure
[1:45:33] built up today I believe before I go any
[1:45:35] further I may I say this I believe it's
[1:45:38] the enemy coming down and pressing the
[1:45:41] extra pressure I believe it's the devil
[1:45:43] knowing the common Lord is at hand
[1:45:45] the barbason and last days the devil
[1:45:47] would go up like a roaring lion he would
[1:45:48] get you listen under pressure hurryin
[1:45:52] running over something you will make
[1:45:54] decision you wouldn't make if you sit
[1:45:55] down and think it over
[1:45:56] so before you run and do this and run do
[1:45:59] this and you run a news that sports free
[1:46:02] tink we nothing is running away from you
[1:46:07] because Romans 8:28 say we know do you

[1:54:42] my the reason what God God put you here
[1:54:45] are nothing new today because you are
[1:54:48] both best
[1:54:52] I know I know someone you are I believe
[1:54:56] that yet yet Samson was was personal
[1:55:11] Samson was caught this seminal curry
[1:55:15] looks and the only thing come upon him
[1:55:17] and he liked the light like like
[1:55:19] somebody outside a church or sorry I was
[1:55:20] for everything else and it Deborah saw a
[1:55:23] channel he could use because once I'm
[1:55:26] gonna surrender to God Deborah could use
[1:55:28] them so he moving now to use the light
[1:55:31] to get Samson from old are the anointing
[1:55:34] that's like no she doesn't know that yet
[1:55:37] she likes Samson he finds that nice man
[1:55:40] she don't understand what's upon him she
[1:55:44] doesn't connect to the anointing upon
[1:55:45] him she don't know the Covenant that is
[1:55:47] with him but she loves him he loves her
[1:55:50] and she gonna lead him to lose his eyes
[1:55:54] she's gonna leave him plumb off but God
[1:55:58] is with Samson we know the story Samson
[1:56:02] collapse he granary milk and then they
[1:56:06] bring home all the entertainment not go
[1:56:07] to like that it's one thing for a man to

[2:09:41] so the first battle ever fought begin in
[2:09:43] heaven and Michael okay it was true
[2:09:45] don't even write okay no before any
[2:09:47] battle can put an array they first have
[2:09:49] to choose a meeting ground a place where
[2:09:51] the battles we fought okay and the great
[2:09:54] battle that Saturday on earth there has
[2:09:55] to be a neutral meeting place there had
[2:09:58] to be a splay selected for the battle to
[2:09:59] begin begin and will batter to reach and
[2:10:03] the path aground begin in the human mind
[2:10:06] there is where it starts the human mind
[2:10:10] was chosen for the place of the battle
[2:10:13] now I know you notice a new here
[2:10:14] especially Ennis intellectually you
[2:10:16] understand this a lot at most time in
[2:10:18] the lecture could you know what human
[2:10:19] mind but what are you doing about it
[2:10:22] because all the men that achieve in the
[2:10:24] natural is because they went past the
[2:10:27] human mind
[2:10:29] you hear they saw you in mind we like
[2:10:31] but how much mystics in Muhammad may
[2:10:32] thousand so my time he tried his
[2:10:34] Towson's upon chosen and every time he
[2:10:36] he ain't get true he final not only hold
[2:10:38] not to do it that's how he was
[2:10:41] interpreting it
[2:10:42] they made 976 try and know not to read
[2:10:46] so not to do it soon and he keep doing
[2:10:48] until he did it light bulb the right
[2:10:51] aeroplane them fellows when the first
[2:10:54] tired of people want to leave the plane
[2:10:55] bird how they go fly how they go take
[2:10:58] off from what not there a lot of
[2:10:59] criticism my mother story you must plane
[2:11:01] crash no madam flying wouldn't think the
[2:11:03] running we even walk on different things
[2:11:05] but eventually it took off not for fun
[2:11:08] but it was a start so you have to take
[2:11:11] off maybe not something listen either
[2:11:14] get some cuff some Phyllis time I guess
[2:11:16] I'm spawn and I just order to be from
[2:11:19] you and as a weird is the first one it
[2:11:22] has to the first one even if you bring
[2:11:25] ten order Phyllis nice to fight you you
[2:11:27] still get one true goal right now dole
[2:11:34] back know you're half this not to get
[2:11:36] victory you have to begin to fight if
[2:11:40] you're praying for the sick yesterday go
[2:11:42] on pray again today
[2:11:45] they are going to be healed because God
[2:11:48] said so
[2:11:49] isn't that right here's why there is
[2:11:52] where the battle starts the human mind
[2:11:54] was chosen for the battle the Bliss of
[2:11:57] the battle because decisions are made
[2:12:00] from the mind the head
[2:12:02] therefore organization can never do the
[2:12:04] work of God because the batarangs
[2:12:06] you have to go to meet your enemies in
[2:12:08] the mind you've got to make a choice
[2:12:09] that meets you decisions are made in the
[2:12:11] mind and tears where sit and mix you
[2:12:14] decisions are made because God has made
[2:12:16] it that way
[2:12:18] I love decisions I love mechanisms I
[2:12:22] like the choice of leadership I like the
[2:12:24] fruit it brings because sometimes after
[2:12:26] the decisions that that look like you
[2:12:28] have no bearing and religion on
[2:12:29] sometimes make wrong decisions right
[2:12:31] decisions but peace upon decisions you
[2:12:33] see the fruit of Italy turn on the road
[2:12:34] all because you want to choose God's
[2:12:37] plan and God's program and if you choose
[2:12:39] it and you have got intent and purpose
[2:12:41] god bless you if you're falling on you
[2:12:43] get back up if you make a mistake what

[2:15:47] I'm dead that CD shall now look upon you
[2:15:51] and consider the saying is this the man
[2:15:53] that made it the tremble that making
[2:15:57] them that did shake the kingdom is this
[2:16:01] the man and wherever I'm said here when
[2:16:04] God created me are you ready everybody
[2:16:06] arrived Azaria
[2:16:08] if anybody dead stand up alright alright
[2:16:11] just testing to see if anybody didn't
[2:16:14] select nobody's dead inside a
[2:16:19] everybody's alive all right here we go
[2:16:23] when God created me okay now the first
[2:16:26] man he made in His image and we are now
[2:16:31] returning back to that image the foolish
[2:16:35] created image could we say Amen on that
[2:16:38] you see what we're going back to the
[2:16:41] first created image the image that God
[2:16:43] said let us make man in our image and
[2:16:45] likeness we going back to Docs and the
[2:16:47] Prophet was said to reveal an image say
[2:16:50] virtue knowledge temperance patience
[2:16:51] godliness brotherly kindness that's the
[2:16:53] image coming back into you this is what
[2:16:56] around when God created me William
[2:16:59] Branham I was before the foundation of
[2:17:01] the world he made my bein my spirit I
[2:17:05] wasn't conscious of anything as far as I
[2:17:07] know Paul said he chose us in him before
[2:17:10] the world began
[2:17:11] though there was some part of me and the
[2:17:15] rest of all you hear that's in Christ
[2:17:17] Jesus before the world began here to my
[2:17:21] analysis of that I think that the people
[2:17:24] today that are possessed with this
[2:17:26] spirit or the spirit is a part of these
[2:17:30] angelic beings spirits which rotated off
[2:17:34] of God that never fell in the beginning
[2:17:38] and resisted the devil's like two-thirds
[2:17:42] of the IRS's and sin and putin's of the
[2:17:44] angel were kicked out and those demon
[2:17:47] spirits come into people and happy did
[2:17:52] their body they are demons that was once
[2:17:56] angels but because they fell they
[2:17:59] transform the demons
[2:18:03] it's not just demons it was angelic
[2:18:07] beings that fell and because they fell
[2:18:11] the major change come demons are you
[2:18:18] ready for some more coming a shout right
[2:18:22] with me I have a word from the Lord for
[2:18:25] you this morning
