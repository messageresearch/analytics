[10:44] a small portion of scripture reading in
[10:46] the Psalms
[10:48] as we
[10:52] get a context for our worship this
[10:54] evening
[10:55] Psalm chapter 138
[10:57] I'm going to read that chapter there
[11:00] praise God
[11:03] praise God Amen
[11:08] amen Psalm chapter 138 says I will
[11:12] praise thee with my whole heart
[11:14] before the gods will I sing praise unto
[11:17] thee
[11:18] I will worship to what thy Holy Temple
[11:21] and praise thy name for thy loving
[11:24] kindness and for thy truth
[11:27] for thou has magnified thy wood above
[11:30] all thy name
[11:32] in the day when I cried thou answerest
[11:35] me and strengtheneth me with strength in
[11:39] my soul
[11:40] all the kings of the Earth shall praise
[11:42] thee you alone
[11:44] when they hear of the words of thy mouth
[11:47] yea they shall sing in the ways of the
[11:51] Lord
[11:51] for great is the glory of the Lord
[11:55] and though the Lord be high yet hath he
[11:58] respect unto the lowly
[12:01] but the proud he knoweth
[12:04] and though I walk in the midst of
[12:06] trouble
[12:07] thou Wilt revive me Thou shalt stretch
[12:11] forth thine hand against the wrath of
[12:13] mine enemies
[12:15] and thy right hand shall save me
[12:18] the Lord will perfect that which
[12:20] concineth me

[33:52] under the utmost part of the earth let's
[33:54] pray one more father we read your word
[33:56] and we pray your presence will come down
[33:57] on your will and Speak Life lord lord
[34:00] your prophet prophesied he said oh God
[34:03] he said I I come to lay some seeds and I
[34:05] hope these men may take this word and
[34:07] and make it come to life Lord May the
[34:10] will come to life tonight
[34:14] oh praise the lord it's good to be here
[34:17] tonight
[34:18] who praise God so have a title tonight
[34:21] God's Earthly strength is his word made
[34:24] flesh
[34:25] and I have an inspiration I will go in
[34:27] the strength of the Lord
[34:29] that is sticking from the Psalms that we
[34:30] read tonight I have two context
[34:32] scripture and this from judges you of
[34:34] the final reader judges 16 6 and the
[34:37] lighter said to Samson tell me I pray
[34:39] thee wherein thy great strength light
[34:40] and where it thou might just be born to
[34:42] afflict thee oh praise God somebody
[34:45] always trying to find out what is your
[34:46] strength not because they want to admire
[34:48] your strength and say you're strong you
[34:49] know but to see how they could bind you
[34:51] and bring you down that's what the devil
[34:54] job he was you want to find out your
[34:55] strength to ban you and bring you along
[34:57] amen next context scriptures in John 3 1
[35:00] 8 1 to 80 there was a man of the
[35:02] Pharisees named Nicodemus a rule of the
[35:05] Jews that same came to the the same came
[35:07] to Jesus by night said unto them Rabbi
[35:09] we know that what a teacher come from
[35:10] God for no man can do these Miracles
[35:12] that they'll do is except God be with
[35:14] him so Jesus answered and said unto him
[35:16] verily very less unto you except a man
[35:18] be born again he cannot see the kingdom
[35:21] of God sent him how can a man be born
[35:24] when he's old can he enter the second
[35:26] time in his mother's womb and be born
[35:28] and Jesus answered very very that's
[35:31] absolutely absolutely identity except my
[35:34] mom be born of water and of spirit
[35:36] wooden Spirit he cannot enter into the
[35:39] kingdom of God duck which is born of the
[35:41] flesh's flesh first but that was one of
[35:43] the spirit and spirit second but
[35:45] marvelous you must be born again the
[35:49] wind blew it where it listed and thou
[35:51] hearest the song thereof but can't not
[35:53] tell when should commit and where did it
[35:55] go it so is everyone that is born of the
[35:57] spirit you can't pin them down they move
[36:00] as they feel led they move as they feel
[36:02] led by the spirit because the spirit is
[36:04] sent to lead his sons and daughters of
[36:06] the Living God okay let's go tonight
[36:08] could you think of a businessman how how
[36:11] far our church is behind could you think
[36:13] of a businessman that started a business
[36:15] a striving business and he got to get
[36:18] some help right quick and he go to a
[36:20] bunch of dead men corpses and saying
[36:22] would you come and work for me
[36:24] benefit to him that's the reason the
[36:27] organization never Rises a bunch of dead
[36:30] unbelief congregating themselves
[36:32] together like Nimrod like Kora all down
[36:35] to the eight he never use it he never
[36:37] did use organization he can't do it it's
[36:40] already out of the will of God it is Out
[36:42] Of Reach
[36:44] it is Out Of Reach so you see God have
[36:46] to come to individuals because he can't
[36:48] use that organization how could you go
[36:50] to a man that could move paralyzed head
[36:52] hand foot and tell him you want to run a
[36:54] race foot race for you
[36:56] run this race with patients lay aside
[36:58] how could you do it when the man can't
[37:00] move he is paralyzed you have got to get
[37:03] that paralytic off of him first then he
[37:06] can run so we find that this man has got
[37:08] to be born again in order to be active
[37:11] or all right or be born of the flesh you
[37:14] have the wisdom of the world and the
[37:15] wisdom of the world obey his fleshly
[37:17] teacher but to be born of the spirit
[37:20] is that though is that right to be born
[37:22] of respect that's something else the
[37:24] born of the spirit is to believe and
[37:26] obey the teaching of the Bible by the
[37:30] Holy Ghost
[37:31] so the Bible is the absolute
[37:34] Oh Glory to whoever the Bible say you
[37:35] have to believe
[37:36] because God have to be big enough to
[37:38] know what he write inside of here
[37:40] hallelujah God have to be wise enough to
[37:42] know no Mystics inside of there not a
[37:44] comma not a foreign
[37:48] [Music]
[37:51] [Applause]
[37:56] let's go
[37:57] watch to be born of the spirit
[38:00] is to believe and obey the teaching of
[38:04] the Bible
[38:05] by the Holy Ghost
[38:07] and a man that I was born of the spirit
[38:09] will obey God's word regardless of what
[38:13] any tradition tell him
[38:15] because what the elders say the minister
[38:16] Association say well this one said what
[38:18] the Bible said I'm holding on to it what
[38:21] the scripture said hold on to it because
[38:23] the prophet came to reveal the
[38:24] scriptures
[38:26] Hallelujah he come to reveal the Bible
[38:28] is that right all right
[38:31] I'm against organized religion to be
[38:34] born of the spirit
[38:35] is to believe and behave yourself in the
[38:38] spirit
[38:39] behave
[38:40] not just believe
[38:42] behave yourself in this world is to
[38:44] understand and believe with your heart
[38:46] that Jesus is Christ and this is his
[38:50] word
[38:51] and no other words can be added to it or
[38:53] taken away from it without your name
[38:55] take note of the book of life that was a
[38:57] strong one if you add one thing to it
[38:59] your tradition one thing from it he said
[39:02] your name shall be rubbed of The Book of
[39:03] Life
[39:04] oh Blessed Be There of the Lord now
[39:06] regards of the flesh the nomination
[39:09] teaching is contrary to the Bible
[39:12] because this is denominational teaching
[39:14] Born Again means to be built from above
[39:17] the new bird put it from above then we
[39:21] are active in the things from above
[39:23] isn't that right for it is himself
[39:27] acting his word
[39:29] through you
[39:34] to be born against be born from above
[39:36] not your first birth not the mommy and
[39:38] daddy business no from above my father
[39:41] had revealed unto you born from above
[39:52] from above
[39:54] this is a real father this is from
[39:57] heaven
[39:57] isn't that right
[39:59] is to be booted from above
[40:01] then we are active in the things from
[40:03] above
[40:04] for it is himself
[40:06] himself acting his word through you
[40:10] so this is a word brain justification is
[40:13] the word that's the bride Oh Glory the
[40:16] God signification was the word that was
[40:19] the bride so when Luther preached
[40:20] justification the word made flesh that
[40:23] was God strengthened here that challenge
[40:25] the Catholic church that was the pride
[40:28] what Give the Lord a shout because that
[40:30] was the word required for that hour
[40:32] for Glory to God when sanctification
[40:35] came Wesley on the Earth was the word
[40:38] made flesh it was the word living
[40:40] through him in sanctification Hallelujah
[40:43] that was God's strength Earthly strength
[40:46] because I was the word made flesh oh God
[40:49] and then come Pentecost and now here you
[40:52] are here tonight and Perfection is
[40:54] required oh give the Lord some Praises o
[40:57] glory to God it have to start somewhere
[41:01] Oh Glory to God
[41:03] if we're going to have a crop it have to
[41:05] start somewhere you have to stand by a
[41:07] seed then we know when they see the seed
[41:10] the crop is coming but they don't have
[41:12] to go through a process you have to put
[41:14] the seed in the ground then the seed go
[41:16] through a process a stalk a castle of
[41:18] wheat a go into a process that's the
[41:21] history of the church ages a process to
[41:24] come back to the original or glory to
[41:26] God so once we hit the seventh step once
[41:29] we hit this last age God is bringing us
[41:32] back to the original the spice and the
[41:35] prophet to turn our hearts back to the
[41:38] faith of the fathers because the faith
[41:40] of the fathers was the original
[41:43] or give the Lord some praises glory to
[41:46] God
[41:47] nothing short of that
[41:49] oh Gloria Capri shutting short of that
[41:52] Hallelujah
[41:53] back to the original
[41:55] amen
[41:57] now what you may be seated now remember
[41:58] he didn't say you ought to be born again
[42:00] you say You must must now as
[42:03] English-speaking people understand what
[42:05] the word must means
[42:07] it's absolutely you've got to do it it's
[42:10] a must there's an I believe the message
[42:13] this they must be born again I believe
[42:15] brother Branham that's not good he must
[42:17] be born again who said that no Jesus
[42:20] said that don't give the Lord some
[42:21] Praises Hallelujah
[42:24] Jesus said that first message first
[42:28] teaching First Gospel you must be born
[42:31] again Hallelujah that which is born of
[42:34] the flesh is flesh that Festival of GCE
[42:37] CXC and degree but they're still flesh
[42:39] that maybe have a doctorate and a PSC
[42:41] but it's still fresh but that which is
[42:43] born of the spirit is Spirit it may be
[42:46] illiterate it may be carried or right
[42:48] but the spirit will give the Lord a
[42:50] shout in the house tonight
[42:52] Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah
[42:56] your glory to God you don't have to be
[42:59] able to read or write to be born of the
[43:02] spirit glory to God Amen Hallelujah must
[43:05] be born again Hallelujah
[43:08] and if you could take that word this
[43:10] morning and break it down what it means
[43:12] that it's totally impossible then it's
[43:14] that essential that great it's totally
[43:18] impossible to enter the kingdom of
[43:20] heaven or even see it until you're born
[43:22] again so many different interpretations
[43:24] of what that were born again you have to
[43:27] seek it out with all our hearts to see
[43:29] what it means there's not a person that
[43:31] want to go to torment there's nobody you
[43:33] don't drive hundreds of miles over and
[43:35] spend your living your money to come to
[43:37] church to shake hands and and so on like
[43:39] that to praise God it's not right it's
[43:41] people that love God isn't that right
[43:43] they want to see what they want to do
[43:45] what is right isn't that right so no
[43:48] matter how much we try to think we are
[43:50] right in saying a Creed or joining a
[43:52] church we are still what we are until
[43:56] you're actually born again of the spirit

[50:22] oh
[50:23] something moving tonight when Samson was
[50:26] his anointing Samson wasn't anointing he
[50:30] had a reputation his name used to make
[50:32] people tremble Samson come in Samsung
[50:35] anointed they can't stop him one time I
[50:38] try to close the gate on him and he take
[50:39] up the gate and the post they couldn't
[50:41] stop him he was at Paris to the
[50:45] unrighteous okay the Lord I shout Son of
[50:48] God servant of God and when they saw the
[50:51] anoint him that devil upon them people
[50:53] want to get a crack at him and that's
[50:55] where the anointed Delilah
[51:00] and all she want to find out is where
[51:02] your strength lies where yes thank God
[51:04] how are you talking her after ice cream
[51:06] and cake where your strength lied after
[51:08] taking her to the to the wherever it is
[51:10] way a strength
[51:14] Samson wasn't descending what was behind
[51:17] her
[51:19] he was watching the lighter's flesh
[51:21] he was watching the human element her
[51:24] shape a complexion a color of face your
[51:26] beauty and everything else but he wasn't
[51:28] watching the spirits
[51:30] that was hiding behind that beauty
[51:32] hiding behind that flesh to discover
[51:35] what you wear strength lines
[51:37] because sons of God are strengthened her
[51:39] God put strength in you you know there's
[51:41] a strength inside of you you know you
[51:43] are not the believer right you know
[51:45] who's a believer

[51:49] glory the God Hallelujah the word in you
[51:51] is the believer you are not the believer
[51:53] I know the word inside of you now you
[51:55] have to believe the word inside of you
[51:57] because that's the secret the word is in
[51:59] the bride that's why we pump in all
[52:01] these things all these years they kept
[52:03] this word inside of you and preach my
[52:06] own thoughts on what I feel it has to be
[52:08] prophetic utterance
[52:09] has to be the word because the Bible
[52:11] said man shall not live by better alone
[52:13] but by every word that proceeds out of
[52:16] the mouth of God and the milk of God Is
[52:19] His prophets and God said behold I send
[52:21] you Elijah the prophet
[52:22] them Liars want to come and say false
[52:24] prophet and what kind of nonsense no
[52:26] it's too late it's too late this one
[52:29] backside and this one can throw off this
[52:31] Minister stop preaching a message it too
[52:33] late he never to leave he was never no
[52:35] messages he was a deceiver he was a
[52:38] false Messenger to begin with Oh Glory
[52:41] to God over my kind of Revelation now
[52:42] we'll never take it out when Jesus said
[52:44] Upon This Rock I will build my church
[52:46] and the case of Hell will never Prevail
[52:48] against it
[52:52] he crazy
[52:54] he could break the word okay the Lord I
[52:56] shout in the house
[53:11] God makes it simple she's brought them
[53:14] to a place where all of us can see it
[53:16] for whosoever will no no one man cannot
[53:18] save the other it makes no difference
[53:20] what anyone tries to say no man can save
[53:22] another no matter how smart or what his
[53:25] office is
[53:27] or what his office is let him be a
[53:31] pastor priest Bishop Cardinal Pope he
[53:34] cannot have one thing to do with saving
[53:35] him as life
[53:37] so if you come here you're finished
[53:40] are you foolishness
[53:42] man controlling people like if they
[53:44] control the book you have a big key
[53:46] and he control the book and he editing
[53:48] your name he could edit that book
[53:51] your name was written before that money
[53:52] whom you talk before the foundation of
[53:55] the world God put your name in Lamb book
[53:56] God is not put in your name because
[53:58] you're behaving good now to be a bad
[54:00] last week you put your name down when it
[54:01] be a bad he think of your name when you
[54:03] believe God you put him on your name
[54:04] that's how God really is this he'll get
[54:06] frustrated
[54:07] because you have more bad times than
[54:08] Good Times
[54:12] if God had to run his building like that
[54:14] when you behave got tick or God taking
[54:16] him off again
[54:22] you know what man God will have no sense
[54:24] after life
[54:25] you have nobody because all these same
[54:27] nature will just act up and after he
[54:28] gets it up make a whole new generation
[54:31] again yes
[54:32] God not doing that so you put your name
[54:34] in The Lamb book of life before the
[54:36] foreign
[54:41] or give the Lord some praises hallelujah
[54:44] praise God the Devil Couldn't keep you
[54:46] whether any Bush whether any Hill
[54:48] whether wherever you're born whatever
[54:50] conditional wrong the devil couldn't
[54:52] hold your back somehow this message had
[54:55] to get to you somehow somebody had to
[54:57] get this word to you because this world
[55:00] has to become flesh this message gonna
[55:02] live we will not all be preaching like
[55:04] this this message going to live Oh Glory
[55:07] to God they're going to live it's going
[55:10] to live
[55:11] God said so and God can't like because
[55:14] God's strength have to be manifested on
[55:16] the earth glory to God hallelujah
[55:19] glory to God
[55:21] Jesus at Calvary look weak he looked
[55:24] weak
[55:25] weakness weakness
[55:27] interpret meekness for weakness you look
[55:30] weak on Calvary looked like I was
[55:32] defeated but give him two more days
[55:35] when Resurrection morning come and then
[55:38] guards guarding the tomb they put the
[55:40] Roman seal and the tomb seal was busted
[55:43] God knock aside Stone roller aside power
[55:47] come forth Oh Glory to God this problem
[55:49] look weak despite my look insufficient
[55:52] you might even be looking like a bride
[55:54] but one of these days he said you shall
[55:56] receive power after the Holy Ghost come
[55:59] upon you you shall be Witnesses Oh Glory
[56:02] to God unto me who me Jesus
[56:05] [Music]

[56:12] Jesus people he has a witness nobody
[56:15] else you shall be Witnesses unto me who
[56:18] is it me Jesus
[56:20] as when I hear people preaching I want
[56:21] to hear they talk about Jesus who are

[56:40] at the end of the day all what we preach
[56:43] we have to be able to see Jesus
[56:45] amen
[56:46] all right so no matter all smart no
[56:48] matter what his office is and then we
[56:50] pass the priest bishop or Pope he cannot
[56:52] have one thing to do with even a man
[56:54] life because he's a sinner himself
[56:56] born in sin shape iniquity common the
[56:58] world speaking life is a lot to start
[57:00] with I ain't preaching nothing
[57:03] a liar trying to be comfort
[57:05] a lion trying to bring like Holiness a
[57:07] whole liar
[57:09] Hallelujah watch and what he would still
[57:12] be alive if he's contrary to God's word
[57:13] and God's plan but God made a plan for
[57:15] man to be saved and a man cannot add
[57:18] anything to that plan it is God's plan
[57:20] isn't that right let every man will be a
[57:23] lion man be true it's not right remember
[57:25] the first thing until you're born again
[57:28] you'll never understand twice he spoke
[57:29] it except you'll be born again
[57:31] Hallelujah get the Greek translation
[57:34] very nice unto you watch category you
[57:36] find not see with your eye but see with
[57:38] your heart you cannot see the kingdom of
[57:41] God with your eyes because the spiritual
[57:42] Kingdom see in other words you're never
[57:44] able to comprehend or understand the
[57:46] kingdom of God until you are born again
[57:49] it's all an unraveled mystery and when
[57:51] you're born again here we go here we go
[57:53] the plans of the Kingdom the kingdom
[57:56] itself becomes real to you
[57:59] no you say I am born again and deny the
[58:02] word
[58:03] how can you be your own life gives you a
[58:06] Vindication of it your own group that
[58:08] you're joined with feather wait till we
[58:10] get down to those things comes by the
[58:12] spirit how can you tell people things of
[58:14] the spirit that's not born of the spirit
[58:16] you have to be born of the spirit to
[58:18] understand the things of the spirit now
[58:20] today we say good church members shake
[58:22] hands with the pastor put his name on
[58:24] the book and son Jesus said you must be
[58:26] born again now in order to be born again
[58:28] it's letting yourself go and die and the
[58:31] spirit of Christ comes into you then
[58:33] your normal yours is Christ in you
[58:36] all sons of God must be the same to be
[58:39] born of the word and spirit here we go
[58:42] are you ready
[58:43] brings us back to the spoken word again
[58:46] like in John 3. to be born of the water
[58:49] and the spirit what does that do it what
[58:51] does what does it do it brings you right
[58:53] back again into the place where you
[58:55] should have been at the beginning
[58:58] So Adam wants to produce another spoken
[59:00] with son how did God speak Adam Let
[59:02] There Be and there was he created Adam
[59:05] in his own image by what the word so
[59:07] animals are spoken one son Adam and in
[59:10] return was supposed to speak for his son
[59:12] he didn't and come on to sex that's
[59:15] where we're born in sin when Jesus come
[59:17] he said must be born again of word and
[59:19] spirit to bring us back to adamic again
[59:22] which was before the fall okay the Lord
[59:25] some Praises glory to God hallelujah
[59:28] hallelujah praise God praise God
[59:32] all right let's continue now
[59:34] this is Brother Branham
[59:36] he was praying
[59:41] they might be saying we are crazy
[59:43] but brother to me right now these things
[59:45] are breaking like this
[59:47] under the supernatural thing
[59:49] I can almost hear the song as the clock
[59:51] of time takes away in the utility
[59:54] I can almost see the Angels standing
[59:55] there saying at the last
[59:57] of the seventh Angel's message
[1:00:00] so the seven angels of a beginning a
[1:00:03] middle part
[1:00:04] and a last part
[1:00:06] at the last of the Seven Angels message
[1:00:08] time shall be no more
[1:00:10] that little loyal bride will fly away in
[1:00:12] His Arms of Jesus one of these days be
[1:00:14] taken to the father's house let us think
[1:00:17] of these things as we go along
[1:00:18] he said Lord I pray that you'll honor
[1:00:21] these people for their respects of the
[1:00:22] world
[1:00:23] is from the six seal and heal them for
[1:00:26] Jesus sake out here in the audience lord
[1:00:28] they're sitting up people just like it
[1:00:30] was who listened to the Apostle Pete on
[1:00:32] their Pentecost how he went back to the
[1:00:34] word and got the word he said Jewel said
[1:00:36] in the last days these things will take
[1:00:38] place this is that and the three
[1:00:40] thousand will leave it unbaptize so
[1:00:42] and father today we stand here by your
[1:00:44] grace it's not because it's special
[1:00:46] people it's because just like the day of
[1:00:48] the land the ox of the man is Eagle time
[1:00:51] it's the anointing of the r it's the
[1:00:53] time you're living in it's the working
[1:00:54] of the holy spirit in this particular
[1:00:56] time to prove that Jesus is not dead the
[1:01:00] things he said he would do just before
[1:01:01] the evening lights went out and we have
[1:01:03] seen it do it right down the road we see
[1:01:06] it the picture taken of the pillar of
[1:01:07] foul who let the children of Israel who
[1:01:09] met Paul on the Road God let the people
[1:01:11] be quickly awakened Lord quickly those
[1:01:14] who have their names put in the Book of
[1:01:16] Life when this life flashes across their
[1:01:18] path may they see it like the little
[1:01:20] ill-filled woman at the well that day
[1:01:22] she recognized quickly she knew it was
[1:01:24] the scripture
[1:01:25] no father
[1:01:26] I pray that all will receive you at this
[1:01:30] time in their hearts we'll separate
[1:01:32] Forever at this hour that they are
[1:01:35] finished with sin now this turned out to
[1:01:38] me you know come into a place where
[1:01:40] you're finished with sin
[1:01:41] you have seen it you have done it you
[1:01:44] have went through it and you want no
[1:01:45] more of it you're finished you're cut
[1:01:47] you're draw a line in the sand and
[1:01:49] you're finished with sin that they might
[1:01:52] be workers in this last evil day for we
[1:01:55] realize we have just a short time
[1:01:58] and the church may go up anytime
[1:02:01] continuing
[1:02:02] the lamb might at any time leave the
[1:02:04] sanctuary
[1:02:05] sacrifice
[1:02:07] come from the Throne of God where the
[1:02:08] sacrifice lives and it's over there's no
[1:02:11] more hope for the world
[1:02:12] she is Finnish
[1:02:14] now we talk about the lamb
[1:02:17] living the sanctuary
[1:02:19] then you flip it in the spirit to the
[1:02:21] Earth then she goes into frustrations
[1:02:24] great spasms of earthquakes
[1:02:27] great chickens like it was at the
[1:02:29] resurrection
[1:02:30] as Christ Rose from the grave when the
[1:02:32] saints rise the same thing will take
[1:02:34] place Lord
[1:02:36] could be at any minute
[1:02:38] so he's saying the effect of the Lamb
[1:02:40] leaving the sanctuary
[1:02:43] have an effect on Earth
[1:02:45] with earthquakes
[1:02:47] and judgment
[1:02:49] hear this part this is where I get
[1:02:50] inspiration on for tonight
[1:02:52] take your children under your arm father
[1:02:54] now
[1:02:55] draw your little lambs to your bosom
[1:02:57] granted
[1:02:59] and feed them on the word
[1:03:02] till they are in strength for service
[1:03:09] that's what get this thing tonight
[1:03:11] this is what hit me tonight
[1:03:13] feed them on the word until when
[1:03:16] till they get strength
[1:03:18] for service
[1:03:20] when you when you get service when
[1:03:21] you're going service
[1:03:23] when do you see Power
[1:03:26] after the holy ghost coming upon you
[1:03:28] so he is talking about a prophecy for
[1:03:30] for Dynamics
[1:03:32] you're staying with the word
[1:03:34] you're feeling on with the word until
[1:03:36] the end you will pour from behind

[1:03:49] a fountain of Nora funk I know there's a
[1:03:52] function with blood draws Emmanuel vein

[1:07:57] whole church was here tonight all who
[1:07:59] ordained to be here tonight or the end
[1:08:00] to be here tonight what can tell you
[1:08:02] tonight God can heal you tonight God can
[1:08:04] deliver you tonight God can baptize you
[1:08:07] with fire tonight but glory to God
[1:08:10] Hallelujah glory Lord God you walk out
[1:08:13] here completely changed
[1:08:15] [Music]
[1:08:19] mine mine
[1:08:22] Hallelujah
[1:08:24] this is more than believing this is
[1:08:26] coming to receiving
[1:08:27] oh God Jesus had received the Holy Ghost
[1:08:30] Oh Glory to God that's what he breathed
[1:08:33] upon them he said receiving the Holy
[1:08:34] Ghost it was a promise to them oh God
[1:08:37] not your sin in your soul that's all you
[1:08:39] need is sealing the soul we know the
[1:08:41] seed in your soul but we receive in the
[1:08:43] Holy Ghost standing the Holy Ghost to
[1:08:45] come inside of there
[1:08:47] hallelujah praise God
[1:08:49] amen
[1:08:52] father son Holy Ghost these three are
[1:08:54] one what about Spirit the agreeing one
[1:08:58] so in show where it could be justified
[1:09:00] without being Sanctified you can be
[1:09:02] Sanctified without having about the Holy
[1:09:03] Ghost but you cannot have the fire we
[1:09:05] have in the Sun the calf this whole
[1:09:07] don't have an holy spirit because these
[1:09:08] three are one now if a man set a thought
[1:09:11] of the justification that all you have
[1:09:13] to have he's wrong he's got to be wrong
[1:09:15] then if the church who believes like
[1:09:17] many of the Pentecostals that the Holy
[1:09:19] Ghost is it that's all repenting at the
[1:09:20] Holy Ghost that's still wrong because
[1:09:22] you've got to get the sanification in
[1:09:23] there to be cleansed before the Holiness
[1:09:25] comes in
[1:09:26] you don't leave out the blood and the
[1:09:29] new birth as people talk about the
[1:09:30] Battle of the ghost is the new bird no
[1:09:32] that's wrong the battle only goes is
[1:09:34] different from the New Birth the new
[1:09:35] birth is when you're born again but the
[1:09:37] holy egos is when the power comes into
[1:09:39] that bird for service
[1:09:41] you mean we need Paul for civics
[1:09:44] you mean some just went but God have
[1:09:46] some that will be sent and have went and
[1:09:49] sent men go out and they just went out
[1:09:51] but then God went sent out that's
[1:09:53] different because Jesus as my father
[1:09:55] sent me so send that you and the father
[1:09:58] that sent him was in him Oh Glory
[1:10:01] according to me God will still send some
[1:10:03] out yes he's going to come in and then
[1:10:05] send them Oh Glory to God so the Holy
[1:10:09] Ghost comes when power comes into that
[1:10:11] built for service
[1:10:12] baptize into the Holy Ghost Oh Glory to
[1:10:15] God Hallelujah the new birth you have
[1:10:18] been a New Birth by believing in the
[1:10:19] Lord Jesus Christ by having faith
[1:10:21] acceptance of the Savior that's bird
[1:10:23] pass on death in the life but the Holy
[1:10:25] Ghost
[1:10:26] is power for service
[1:10:28] power for what
[1:10:29] no we're not talking about 1906 holy
[1:10:32] ghosts
[1:10:32] in this age for this message we're
[1:10:35] talking about Dynamics in the mechanics
[1:10:37] we're talking about Divine love we're
[1:10:39] talking about the Supreme anointing
[1:10:40] we're talking about the person of Christ
[1:10:47] when all these virtues are sealed inside
[1:10:50] of you then the Holy Ghost come upon you
[1:10:52] in the true baptism
[1:10:54] or give the Lord a shout in the house
[1:10:58] then that is Christ sealed into you
[1:11:01] let's go
[1:11:03] Holy Ghost is Paul for civics so when
[1:11:05] then talk about born again and applying
[1:11:07] that to the Holy Ghost many of the
[1:11:08] methodists were wrong it cannot it won't
[1:11:11] cope with the scriptures
[1:11:12] it said the way the scripture got its
[1:11:14] place over there the Holy Spirit you
[1:11:16] shall receive the new birth after the
[1:11:17] snow you shall receive power acts 1 8
[1:11:19] after this the Holy Ghost has come upon
[1:11:22] you and they had already believed Satan
[1:11:25] alive and so forth but they had to have
[1:11:27] the Holy Ghost for power
[1:11:29] watch you shall be Witnesses unto me
[1:11:32] after the Holiness come upon you here's
[1:11:35] why here's why because the Holy Ghost is
[1:11:39] a witness of the resurrection showing
[1:11:42] that you have become an adult in Christ
[1:11:47] that's where the power and signs and
[1:11:49] wonders and everything else because God
[1:11:51] see that you have become adult in Christ
[1:11:53] so he says the Holy Ghost as our witness
[1:11:56] of the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:12:00] Hallelujah and I prophecy I want to
[1:12:02] speak over the church is this after this
[1:12:04] morning the holy spiritual beautifully
[1:12:05] coming down business in his great Beauty
[1:12:08] I was just inspired to speak them words
[1:12:10] and say some glorious day
[1:12:12] that all the gifts that's in the church
[1:12:14] will be just set aside on the mantle as
[1:12:17] it was and the Holy Spirit himself will
[1:12:20] take the church
[1:12:22] note not the pastor not the minister the
[1:12:26] Holy Ghost itself himself will take the
[1:12:29] church in such a control of divine love
[1:12:30] until the sick will be healed the blind
[1:12:33] will see the lame will walk without
[1:12:36] hands being laid on them
[1:12:38] it will be just one great Unity
[1:12:41] and that is from then Jesus came
[1:12:44] o praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[1:12:48] Hallelujah such a control
[1:12:50] of the of divine love one time he said
[1:12:53] well Faith isn't ripe enough
[1:12:54] we have to lay in the presence of the
[1:12:56] sun until it be done
[1:12:58] lay in presence we have been laying on
[1:13:01] the word but lean and presence so it's
[1:13:04] prophesying presence Spirit Dynamics
[1:13:07] that's why he said when Daniel
[1:13:09] worshiping the living Christ when them
[1:13:11] Thunder start to Roar out him moving in
[1:13:13] and out
[1:13:14] what happened the anointing in the
[1:13:16] church then your wealth the other pump
[1:13:18] people raise your hands praise God give
[1:13:19] God a praise give God that crap nothing
[1:13:21] like that you know then you are
[1:13:22] worshiping the living Christ
[1:13:25] him moving in and out the pastor he's
[1:13:28] living Christ come on please hallelujah
[1:13:31] praise God the doors were shut when
[1:13:33] Jesus came among them peace be unto you
[1:13:35] then the disciples were glad when they
[1:13:37] saw when they saw the Lord you have to
[1:13:40] see the Lord
[1:13:41] amen right isn't that right
[1:13:43] he said why can't the weak lay out in
[1:13:45] the presence of the sun Yonder and see
[1:13:47] the are we living in Christ is our Ark
[1:13:49] but his original way to do it they had
[1:13:52] his spirit all right we know that they
[1:13:54] wait upon the Lord see his plan on his
[1:13:57] original word in its season to be
[1:13:59] Vindicated that's what we should be
[1:14:00] doing right now he reveals their fate by
[1:14:02] his word seen him confirm every plan he
[1:14:05] promised not man schemes of denomination
[1:14:07] not making members for his own act they
[1:14:09] got a message
[1:14:17] now God told the prophet eat the scroll
[1:14:19] in the Old Testament the prophet of the
[1:14:22] New Testament say eat a little book why
[1:14:24] that prophet and the word would be one
[1:14:26] the ark is the word of God God has
[1:14:29] promised his word how to be fulfilled
[1:14:31] and how now it come to pass when he
[1:14:33] chooses bride how it would be done it
[1:14:35] has happened right before you in the
[1:14:38] name of the Lord and that's my original
[1:14:39] word the even time message is here
[1:14:42] oh praise God pray are you ready now
[1:14:46] by faith Moses is led him to make the
[1:14:49] choice of the word not by glamor so when
[1:14:52] Faith looks at God's words it esteem
[1:14:54] it's better and more valuable than the
[1:14:57] best the world can show When Faith looks
[1:14:59] at it when faith can see it when faith
[1:15:02] in the wood can see the word may
[1:15:03] manifest it's more to them than all the
[1:15:05] glamor isn't that right Faith sees what
[1:15:09] God wants done
[1:15:10] that's why some people are stuck because
[1:15:12] they're not seeing what God want done
[1:15:14] but Faith does make you see that
[1:15:16] and when you see what go on done you go
[1:15:18] and do it
[1:15:19] you don't stay in unbelief or
[1:15:20] Disobedience you go and do what God
[1:15:22] wants done
[1:15:23] I hope this goes in faith doesn't look
[1:15:25] at the present time Faith doesn't see
[1:15:27] this here Faith look to see what God
[1:15:29] wants and works accordingly isn't that
[1:15:32] right are you ready tonight see it is a
[1:15:35] long-wind vision it don't lower its
[1:15:37] sights it holds to the Target Oh Glory
[1:15:40] to God so Faith don't look at your faces
[1:15:42] Faith to look at your unbelief
[1:15:45] see it looking at what God Said knowing
[1:15:48] that you go tally with that word
[1:15:50] I bragged with a match that word isn't
[1:15:53] that right
[1:15:54] in any way any any good shooter no it's
[1:15:57] a telescope it's hot it's binocular you
[1:16:00] don't look down around here if you you
[1:16:02] don't buy nothing to see what time it is
[1:16:03] you don't use that but you use that
[1:16:05] binocular way off
[1:16:06] so you can't take a binoculars and
[1:16:08] you're watching now anybody here
[1:16:09] something wrong with your eye
[1:16:12] off because you want to see where you're
[1:16:14] going
[1:16:15] you want to see what you have to
[1:16:16] accomplish you want to see what God have
[1:16:18] for you is that right fear does that fit
[1:16:21] picks up God binoculars both of them the
[1:16:23] Old Testament the New Testament and see
[1:16:25] every promise he made and Faith sees on
[1:16:28] the under and Faith chooses that
[1:16:29] regardless of what the present tense say
[1:16:32] it looks at the end he don't drop his
[1:16:34] side down to look this way in that way
[1:16:35] that's the fear that God does isn't that
[1:16:37] right oh glory to God I'm closing
[1:16:40] Hallelujah
[1:16:42] glory to God
[1:16:44] my my Abraham

[1:21:31] well I am missing from your child I tell

[1:21:35] put out and put a backbone inside of

[1:21:41] Oh Glory
[1:21:42] the Bible said Isaiah 9 second does a
[1:21:45] child is born son is given name Shall be
[1:21:47] Called Consular Prince of Peace Mighty
[1:21:49] God Everlasting father of his kingdom
[1:21:51] there shall be no end and the government
[1:21:52] shall be upon his shoulder that's part
[1:21:55] of the body mind what's his body then
[1:21:57] his shoulder is his body where is the
[1:21:59] government on the earth in his body the
[1:22:01] sin shall judge the Earth that's right
[1:22:02] Paul said dare you to go to court with
[1:22:05] one another not take it before the
[1:22:06] church see since the judge the Earth
[1:22:08] where is the government going to be upon
[1:22:10] upon the shoulders his body the
[1:22:13] government upon his shoulders that part
[1:22:15] of the body what is it
[1:22:17] his Earthly strength
[1:22:19] and this is a quote here God's Earthly
[1:22:22] strength is his word made flesh in his
[1:22:26] body here on the Earth
[1:22:28] bringing it to pass
[1:22:30] that is his Pokemon that's why I get it
[1:22:31] from God's history is this word made
[1:22:34] flesh so God has come to the uni to
[1:22:37] become the word made flesh his Earthly
[1:22:40] strengthen the Earth Lord glory to God
[1:22:45] now watch in the beginning was the word
[1:22:49] and the Word was God and the Word was
[1:22:51] with God and the word made flesh no
[1:22:54] that's as fast the human mind can go as
[1:22:56] far as we can go back to the beginning
[1:22:57] is that right but Revelation carries us
[1:22:59] beyond that isn't that right
[1:23:01] and the same word that was made fresh
[1:23:03] and dwell among us because of Revelation
[1:23:05] bring us before the beginning where
[1:23:07] there was God taught and our word is not
[1:23:09] expressed isn't that right isn't that
[1:23:11] right so in the beginning was the word
[1:23:13] as far as we can go by theology but
[1:23:16] before that it was a thought a thought
[1:23:18] was manifested isn't that right that all
[1:23:21] become the word as we close
[1:23:24] you can express it by mental conception
[1:23:26] but if it becomes a real revelation of
[1:23:29] God to you you see it before it happened
[1:23:32] an Express it in word form
[1:23:34] and that is why the message have to be
[1:23:36] inspired to people
[1:23:38] reason it is not enough
[1:23:40] listening is not enough
[1:23:42] the anointing have to come upon you
[1:23:45] to inspire to you and then you are
[1:23:48] changed Oh Glory to God if the anointing
[1:23:51] doesn't come nothing happens
[1:23:52] Hallelujah this was the problem we
[1:23:54] describing Pharisees there was hundreds
[1:23:56] of years in rituals reading Scrolls
[1:23:58] there was pressing play right through
[1:24:00] every Sabbath day but there was not
[1:24:03] inspired when Jesus come he found the
[1:24:06] place
[1:24:07] where it was written that's inspiration
[1:24:09] he find a player because he anointing
[1:24:12] upon him he said the spirit is upon me
[1:24:14] because he had anointed me if Jesus the
[1:24:18] word had to be anointed what about a
[1:24:21] bride in the last days what about you
[1:24:25] and I we have to be anointed
[1:24:27] by The Same Spirit glory to God
[1:24:31] here we go now watch if it becomes a
[1:24:34] real revelation of God you see it before
[1:24:37] it happened and express it in word form
[1:24:39] and that word takes a hole and because
[1:24:41] material a thought expressed
[1:24:44] we say if your heart your mind is so
[1:24:48] instilled with God's spirit until your
[1:24:50] thoughts become his thoughts when you're
[1:24:53] mine and your leading and your guiding
[1:24:56] becomes a direct place or a direct
[1:24:59] inspiration of the Holy Spirit moving in
[1:25:01] your mortal being what kind of people
[1:25:03] ought me to be if the very Holy Spirit
[1:25:05] have you so embodied or empowered that
[1:25:09] you don't use your own thoughts you
[1:25:11] don't use your own mind you don't use
[1:25:13] your own opinion but the Holy Spirit had
[1:25:15] you so built until your thoughts and
[1:25:17] your being is God's spirit expressing
[1:25:20] itself through you what kind of church
[1:25:22] it would be what kind of people would be
[1:25:24] this morning if this Branham Tabernacle
[1:25:27] this morning was so filled with the
[1:25:29] presence of God why you didn't use your
[1:25:31] mind just led by the spirit
[1:25:34] my and they that are sons of God are led
[1:25:37] by the spirit of God then the human
[1:25:39] animal goes out the spirit of God fills
[1:25:41] the vacancy you empty yourself out then
[1:25:44] will be when the church prophecy that is
[1:25:47] when the church will be in his power
[1:25:49] of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus
[1:25:51] will walk in his steps in his power in
[1:25:55] his thoughts in his being in his moving
[1:25:57] do you see what I mean then your
[1:25:59] thoughts will become words and words
[1:26:01] will become material when the church in
[1:26:04] his power and I believe it's on this
[1:26:07] road when the church will be so wrapped
[1:26:10] up in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind saw
[1:26:14] away from themselves they don't see
[1:26:15] themselves no they don't talk but not
[1:26:18] thoughts but they serve God their
[1:26:19] thoughts move on they refuse the things
[1:26:21] of the world they move in the spirit
[1:26:23] yeah it is they move in the spirit they
[1:26:26] live in the spirit they move in the
[1:26:28] spirit they walk in the spirit so
[1:26:30] fulfill the law of Christ then the love
[1:26:32] of Christ in the human heart moving in
[1:26:35] the Holy Ghost that great wonderful
[1:26:37] church will go forth with power and
[1:26:40] deity here's why because deity will be
