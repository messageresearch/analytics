the word hearing of it and the preaching of it in Jesus Christ amen amen amen praise the Lord so as we have our Bibles shall we turn to the Book of Joshua chapter 10 read verse 12 to 14 in Hebrews chapter 4 verse 1- 2 Joshua 10 ver2 then speak Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the amorites before the children of Israel and he said in and he said in the sight of the of Israel son stand thou still upon gibon and thou moon in the valley of aelon and the sun Stood Still and the moon stayed until the people had Avenged themselves upon their enemies is not this written in the book of josha so the son stood still in the midst of heaven and hasted not to go down about a whole day and there was no day like that day before it or after it that the Lord hacken unto the voice of a man for the Lord fought for Israel en is amen amen Hebrews 4:1 let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that had it may the Lord have a blessing to please be seated hallelujah hallelujah you love him praise the Lord so we are in for a good time this weekend because the word is written and the word is spoken and that word is eternal it came from God and it must fulfill the purpose for which God has sent so this weekend the lord has laid on the heart of our pastor to call us on the inspiration stepping into a higher Ministry of speaking the word and this word is not the word of man is the word of God Eternal Word full of [Music] promises in Jesus the ways that I speak they are so we are turning a corner the bride has left Pentecost bride has left the humanistic the bride is walking by faith led by the spirit the clouds may be dark but the is shining so we are stepping to a higher Ministry of the preach is the ministry of the the ministry of Sons and Daughters of God so for the title this morning I want to speak on the title return and now when God brought when God brought his first son on Earth gave them the word and they were to live by the word speak by the word manifest the word it was a spoken word that was handed over to Adam and Adam had the book it was the book of life that was Christ himself that was in the pages of that book Adam could speak and it will be because that book was God himself come on church and the prophet said the word is in the and that book is back onday when the enemy came in the garden came in the garden sin came in Adam lost that book but there was Prophecy in the word will say of the Lord sin came in fell short of the glory of God kicked out of the garden and God sent the cherubin to protect that book of life protect that of life because if he didn't do that we will eat that book of life we will live forever with sin so he drove Adam out of the gard and protected that of life that no sin could come near and at the time appointed he paid the price to get rid of sin and to restore us back so I am calling you back today that sin is over that's the essence of Calvary Jesus died that he would take away our sins and bring us back to the tree of life but this time we are coming back with discernment are coming back as born Sons we are coming back as true Sons coming back as fil Sons by the word the spirit we are not like Adam we are not like Eve we have a revelation that the word is our comfort the word is our Fortress the word is our overcoming power and that word is Jesus Christ it cannot be defeated the word must come to pass whatever that word has spoken conning you it shall come to pass so this day God is inviting you back because the sin person has been setled don't care where you are being I don't care what the devil has laid on you Jesus went to Calvary of Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah in Revelations 5 in Revelations that book no man was worthy to look on that book no man was worthy take that book and lose the seals thereof but there was one that was wor that was the lamb the Lamb of God was worthy there is not your righteous not returning by Your Righteous Jesus made a way this morning there was no way in sin in iniquity we couldn't help ourselves your name was there you are always a part of God saw your name shed the blood and the voice spoke out is not about man is about God's predestination names under the seven SE said wh not John wh not John the lion of the tribe God and that [Music] book this morning and when John turned to look it was a bleedy blooded lamb so what happened 2024 years ago was just a physical Pro because when the lamb was slain before the foundation of world Satan wasn't there so Satan thought he still held you captive but the word the that was loed made flesh and prove to the devil I di for them I redeemed them by my blood Satan cannot get Revelation Satan wants to see by his eyes Satan wants to hear by his want to feel it so said come on Satan feel my death the son declared that he was death the moon declared that he was dead the Stars declared that he was dead Satan was happy I have finally got him devil didn't know the price the price paid the price and told the devil is finished it is finish if I don't come if I don't go away the Holy Ghost will not come he went to the Cross he declared it is finished I have paid the price return back return back to the Tree of Life return back to the Holy Ghost itself return back to your freedom back to your Liberty return back to your possession return back to the word speak that word my word return back for prise God so we are returning to the word the spoken word is in the bride and said here is the secret here is the secret the word the word Christ himself is in the bright today what to do with the word healing this morning speak that word you need salvation for your sons speak that word you need restoration speak that word because Jesus died and brought you talking temps with the spirit brought you talking terms speaking terms with the word so the word is in you is not in the ministers the spirit the spirit today has returned is no Hing in the air looking for a body looking for a body can express itself you are the expression of the spoken word of God Authority Adam had the bride had that Authority power that Jesus had into Christ all that Christ was brought into you into you to you to you you can receive the Holy Ghost now the promise is Onto You The Promise is onto you make no mistake about it we are returning back to

Overcomers this morning praise to him that overc when the word is spoken you receive that word into your heart into your heart because the ministers are God dress well the mind of Christ to the bride

he had seen But when these seven tunders of Revelation 10 Ed he said don't write them at all they are Mysteries we don't know what they are yet in my opinion they will be revealed right away and when they do when the seventh Thunder [Music] mystery is revealed it will not be argument it will not create denominations create clicks what will it do when they are revealed praise God it will give Faith the seven tunders seven Mysteries when they are revealed you give faith for rapturing Grace it will give you a [Music] discernment to know that you came from God you are going back to God it will give you a desending to know that the life of Jesus Christ is not a testation it's a manifestation what will it do to give you faith for the rapturing grace for that church we just move through everything we know of through all dispensations we have wor everything we have seen the mysteries of God we have seen the appearing of great Gathering of the Bride in the last days yet there is something in there that we just that we just can't Enlighten ourselves with there is something or the other but I imagine when those Mysteries begin to come forth God said hold it back down wait a minute I'll reveal it in that day this was prophecy but today is revealed that's why you can shout that's why you can have Victory when he was sealed John was crying John was weeping when it was open all that was in heaven all that was on the Earth all that was under the Earth [Applause] quiet was sad and was bound oh come on now come on now there was a shout there was a praise there was a victory they had

in the last day don't write it at all John because they will stagger over it just let it go I will reveal it in that day when they have reason to see it when they have reasen to see it and today there's got to be a rupture and we have reason to see it we have reason to know our names are written in that book that is why nobody can hold you back praise God Paul said you can do nothing against the truth but for the truth so many are rejecting the message so many but sliding and leaving the message but the message is the word the message is true let everybody reject it let everybody walk
