[11:40] what's the use of coming to church if
[11:41] we're not going to be ready
[11:43] help us and prepare us this morning in
[11:46] jesus name we ask it amen why do you
[11:48] turn around and greet somebody

[11:53] [Music]
[11:56] through eyes
[12:01] [Music]
[12:18] you may be seated praise god
[12:21] it's great to be back home
[12:24] [Applause]
[12:28] and i guess
[12:29] one of these days when we get back when
[12:31] we get back to where we came from
[12:34] you would see it's good to be back home
[12:37] and i could see the heavenly father
[12:38] saying welcome home my children oh what
[12:41] a deed i'm going to do yeah
[12:43] [Applause]
[12:46] greetings from germany
[12:50] so what was in germany meeting with a
[12:52] whole new crop of believers and
[12:54] ministers
[12:55] and to see
[12:57] and experience such fine
[12:59] christian spirit
[13:02] now i i believe in my heart
[13:06] that many people
[13:08] have gotten away from this christian
[13:11] moorings
[13:12] and spirit
[13:14] somewhere along the line
[13:17] it has become so arrogant and pufter
[13:21] and i will say this to you
[13:24] and those who may hear this message
[13:27] if you are up there
[13:29] wherever up there is
[13:32] or you are higher than i wherever higher
[13:34] than i is
[13:36] or you are tall and powerful and mighty
[13:40] the question is
[13:41] how did you get up there
[13:45] how did you get up there now if god's
[13:49] grace
[13:50] put you up there
[13:52] what right or authority do you have
[13:56] to kick somebody in their face
[13:58] who is down there
[14:00] or below
[14:01] where you are
[14:03] so i want you to know we are
[14:05] where we are
[14:07] and we are what we are
[14:10] by the grace of god
[14:18] [Applause]
[14:20] hallelujah
[14:22] you know by ram says
[14:24] god is looking for somebody anybody
[14:27] that the more
[14:29] he blesses
[14:30] is the more humble
[14:32] it becomes
[14:34] because usually
[14:36] that's the norm
[14:39] usually
[14:40] when people get blessed
[14:42] they get puffed up
[14:44] as they know
[14:45] so it's very rare to see somebody where
[14:48] god points on them and they become like
[14:50] a channel of god's blessing
[14:52] they're not stinging and that means
[14:54] they're not clogged up they're like a
[14:55] vessel that god could just shh
[14:58] and save others
[15:00] and bless others and anoint others and
[15:02] help us and pull us up others and
[15:04] encourage others
[15:07] that's what god is looking for
[15:10] the politics is crazy right now in the
[15:12] world today
[15:14] there are wars and they're going to be
[15:15] more wars and more not just rumors of
[15:17] wars
[15:18] things will begin to take place
[15:20] it's going to get worse
[15:22] and worse
[15:24] why you are in church
[15:27] cherish the time
[15:30] take hold of the moment
[15:34] let your faith rise to to believe god
[15:37] for all things
[15:40] it will take more than sitting in church
[15:42] to get out of here
[15:44] it will take the supernatural
[15:47] not natural
[15:49] supernatural
[15:51] and that is what we're coming into this
[15:52] morning
[15:54] into the supernatural
[15:56] so could we stand this time
[15:58] as you want to sing i love him i love
[16:00] him because he first loved me
[16:09] [Music]
[16:18] he
[16:19] calls
[16:22] [Music]
[16:29] thank you jesus
[16:39] [Applause]
[16:44] one time
[16:52] [Music]
[16:54] he said
[16:55] the atmosphere was right he said things
[16:58] he said he can't see again
[16:59] it was just a right atmosphere to say
[17:01] those things they take the right
[17:02] atmosphere for things to really come out
[17:06] one thing we do know the walls are going
[17:08] to come down
[17:10] the walls that ministers bill
[17:12] interpretation bills men ideas bill
[17:15] it's going to come down
[17:17] but branham said god people will gather
[17:19] together
[17:21] hallelujah it may take persecution
[17:24] it may take pressure
[17:25] but they will gather together
[17:27] oh hallelujah praise god there'll be one
[17:30] more ride
[17:31] and the holy ghost himself is going to
[17:33] be in charge of that right
[17:34] so this morning

[21:28] scripture of joshua chapter 14
[21:30] i want to read from verse 6
[21:32] to 14.
[21:39] then the churn of judah came to joshua
[21:42] and igual and caleb the son of
[21:44] jeffernaire the kazanite said unto him
[21:47] dawn was the thing that the lord said
[21:49] unto moses the man of god concerning me
[21:52] and thee in kinish baniya
[21:54] forty years old was i
[21:56] when moses is the servant of the lord
[21:58] sent me from kenish bhania to his foul
[22:00] the land and i brought him word again as
[22:03] it was in my heart it has to be in your
[22:06] heart
[22:07] not your head it's got to be in your
[22:09] heart to bring a word
[22:12] nevertheless my brethren
[22:16] and that went up with me
[22:18] made
[22:19] the heart of the people melt but i
[22:21] wholly followed the lord my god
[22:24] and moses swear on that day saying
[22:26] surely the land where on thy feet of
[22:28] trodden shall be done inheritance and
[22:31] thy children's forever because thou has
[22:33] holy followed the lord my god and now
[22:36] behold the lord had kept me alive
[22:40] these forty and five years even since
[22:42] the lord spake his word unto moses while
[22:44] the children of israel won in the
[22:45] wilderness and now lo i am this day four
[22:48] score and five years old as yet i am
[22:51] strong this day as i was in the day that
[22:54] moses sent me as my strength was then so
[22:58] is my strength now for war but to go out
[23:01] and to come in
[23:03] now therefore give me this mountain
[23:06] where of the lord spake in that day for
[23:08] thou heard us in that day how the
[23:10] anakims were there the cities were great
[23:13] on fence if so be the lord be with me i
[23:15] shall be able to drive them out as the
[23:18] lord said
[23:19] and the joshua blessed him and gave unto
[23:22] caleb the son of jeffree hebron for an
[23:25] inheritance hebrew and therefore became
[23:28] the inheritance of caleb the son of
[23:29] jeffernaire the kazanite unto this day
[23:32] because he wholly
[23:34] followed the lord god of israel may god
[23:37] bless his holy word o praise god may we

[25:11] glory to god you're singing the same old
[25:12] body same old face same old eye but a
[25:16] brand new you
[25:17] because there's an inside man inside
[25:19] that man
[25:20] come on shame as somebody
[25:22] there's a man inside that man
[25:25] oh hallelujah
[25:27] glory to god second timothy 16
[25:30] second timothy 3 16 says all scripture
[25:33] is given
[25:34] by inspiration of god
[25:37] and is profitable for doctrine
[25:40] for reproof for correction
[25:43] for instruction in righteousness
[25:46] and the amplified of that scripture says
[25:49] every scripture is god breathe
[25:52] it is given by his inspiration
[25:55] and profitable for instruction for
[25:58] reproof
[25:59] for conviction of sin for correction of
[26:02] error and discipline in obedience
[26:06] and for training in righteousness
[26:09] in holy living
[26:11] in conformity to god's will in thought
[26:14] purpose and action
[26:17] hallelujah all scripture is god breathed
[26:21] god breathed upon it
[26:23] hallelujah that's why you can say my
[26:25] word shall not return unto me void
[26:28] because the breath of god is on every
[26:30] scripture
[26:31] holy men moved by the holy ghost
[26:34] holy men move by the holy ghost
[26:37] holy man moved by the spirit of the
[26:40] living god
[26:42] oh hallelujah
[26:44] we're not here to entertain you we're
[26:47] here to bring you a word from the lord
[26:50] oh glory to god
[26:53] oh my certainly enjoyed by the
[26:55] georgetown testimony
[26:56] he came and put a level on top of the
[26:58] process
[27:00] and he had a whistle at this side
[27:03] he said the level is to keep things
[27:04] level
[27:05] and the whistle is to blow when people
[27:07] falling asleep
[27:10] and he used it
[27:12] see you there
[27:13] [Music]
[27:16] so i think i'll get a whistle
[27:22] they can't believe you have the level
[27:27] okay
[27:29] now the bible talk about i write in you
[27:31] children i ranted to you young men and i
[27:34] write unto you fathers
[27:37] god's
[27:38] objective
[27:40] is to get us to christian maturity
[27:43] where we can handle god's stuff
[27:48] you can't give an inheritance to a child
[27:51] the bible said if the child is the heir
[27:53] even if the child is the heir he has to
[27:55] be on the tutors and governors until the
[27:58] time appointed
[28:00] by the father
[28:02] hallelujah
[28:04] you know what the guy bolt bullet the
[28:07] guy who win the the race
[28:09] i heard something from him
[28:12] and he said the race is the easiest part
[28:15] that's the easiest part to run the race
[28:16] that's the easiest part
[28:18] he said the path that he's had
[28:20] is the training
[28:23] that he has to go through every day
[28:26] hallelujah
[28:27] every day
[28:29] to run for nine point something seconds
[28:34] hallelujah
[28:35] and we have a race to run
[28:37] and we have a way to run
[28:40] and we have to run this with
[28:42] patience this race
[28:45] [Applause]
[28:46] that is set before us
[28:49] hallelujah
[28:50] keep on running brother
[28:52] it's not a sprint
[28:55] it's a long distance race it's not those
[28:58] who start
[29:00] it's those who finish
[29:02] is he that endure to the end
[29:06] oh give the lord some praises
[29:08] hallelujah hallelujah
[29:11] glory
[29:15] so therefore
[29:16] god's objectives
[29:19] is to bring you into a place of trying
[29:22] that is your behavior
[29:25] your chastisement
[29:27] you're writing
[29:29] you're maturing
[29:30] you're getting right in listening to
[29:32] preachers preaching in church
[29:34] you get ripened by your tests
[29:36] by your upsets
[29:38] by your disappointments
[29:40] by your prey all night
[29:43] your weep all night
[29:45] by the pain you get in the belly that's
[29:47] what you that's what does something to
[29:49] you
[29:50] god took away the prophet's wife
[29:53] took away the prophet's daughter
[29:55] and he was just testing him
[29:58] hallelujah
[29:59] because it is your behavior
[30:02] that sets you out to adoption
[30:04] everybody claimed to be christians
[30:07] everybody claimed to be born again and
[30:08] to be god's children
[30:10] but the bible said try the spirits
[30:13] to see if it is of god
[30:16] hallelujah
[30:18] try them by what by virtue
[30:20] by knowledge by temperance by patience
[30:24] by godliness my brotherly kindness is
[30:27] not i trying you
[30:29] the spirit's gonna try you
[30:31] because what's inside you are gonna
[30:33] speak for itself
[30:36] oh
[30:36] hallelujah
[30:38] glory
[30:40] hallelujah
[30:41] so when the pillar of fire the dove
[30:44] came upon jesus
[30:46] he got power amen but god couldn't say
[30:49] hearing him yet
[30:51] god gave him power and he had to prove
[30:54] himself
[30:56] so the spirit led jesus
[30:58] into the wilderness to overcome the lust
[31:01] of the eyes to overcome the lust of the
[31:04] flesh to overcome the pride of life and
[31:07] he told that all devil it's written it's
[31:11] written it is also written and jesus
[31:14] overcome by the word
[31:20] so that first anointing or power or
[31:24] presence came to position him as a son
[31:28] amen but then he ought to be tested
[31:31] and then afterwards god take him aside
[31:33] onto a mountain
[31:34] isn't that right
[31:36] he had to be tried isn't that right
[31:38] because god can't give you power yet
[31:41] you have to test it first
[31:43] you can't give your full power
[31:44] give you a little taste and pull it off
[31:46] you have to be able to climb up the
[31:48] ladder you have to remove the activated
[31:50] virtual knowledge because power without
[31:52] character is satanic
[31:54] and characters that the gift character
[31:57] is a victory a lot of people don't know
[31:59] that character is when you leave here
[32:02] and you deal with your issues when you
[32:04] leave here and you deal with your
[32:07] philistines
[32:08] your goliath
[32:10] your problems and you handle it and
[32:14] you're overcome
[32:15] then character to be formed in you
[32:18] then god could do something with you
[32:20] because you're not sitting on the
[32:22] premises you are standing on the
[32:24] promises
[32:25] these precious revealed promises
[32:28] oh can we hear the lord some praise his
[32:30] people
[32:31] do you believe he's this word now
[32:34] hallelujah
[32:37] hallelujah
[32:39] so in 1946
[32:41] to be angela
[32:41] on all right empower him
[32:43] but though god didn't only empower him
[32:45] it had others like all robots until i
[32:48] was born in different ones they all had
[32:51] power
[32:52] they all were doing signs and wonders
[32:54] but guess what only one was adopted
[32:57] oh give the lord a shout in the house
[32:59] give the lord a shout all that signs and
[33:01] wonders
[33:02] and all that crippled walking
[33:04] dead reason demon casting out but when
[33:08] come to adoption time when come to
[33:10] hearing him
[33:12] one man stood out
[33:13] one man was different one man had
[33:16] character one man god said here
[33:19] he
[33:20] him
[33:20] [Applause]
[33:23] oh give the lord some praises people
[33:25] [Applause]
[33:32] from hearing him
[33:35] amen
[33:36] now jesus there we go
[33:39] had proven to god
[33:42] that he's been the right kind of a son
[33:48] i'm a son i'm a son of
[33:50] god you know
[33:52] i hope you are back sitting here i'm a
[33:54] son you know i need backslidden as ever
[33:57] i like him god owe them
[34:01] they're on their way to hell
[34:02] and talk about their son their son
[34:06] [Music]
[34:09] god called you out to put you in
[34:13] it's not good to come out
[34:14] of baptist methodist of good religions
[34:16] it's not good to come out only you've
[34:18] got to go in this is to put you in

[41:07] when they were called out
[41:09] they become the church of god
[41:11] god objective
[41:13] wasn't the kingdom in egypt
[41:15] egypt was bondage
[41:17] god objective wasn't the rain mannering
[41:20] them along the wilderness journey
[41:22] the wilderness was just a journey
[41:24] the destination was canaan
[41:26] the destination was the promise
[41:28] it was a promised land
[41:30] by these promises
[41:32] by these promises precious promises
[41:36] god i'm a good god i have a land flowing

[41:54] [Applause]
[42:15] he is bringing you out
[42:17] he is bringing you out
[42:20] [Applause]
[42:29] let me caution you one time
[42:31] when you feel the world of the spirit of
[42:33] god around you
[42:34] respond
[42:36] react
[42:38] do something
[42:39] raise your hands
[42:41] shake your head
[42:43] do a spin around
[42:44] stand up and sit back down
[42:46] but don't just look
[42:48] people miss the healing
[42:50] people miss the blessing
[42:52] by not responding
[42:54] we are not come to read a magazine for
[42:56] you we come to bring dusty at the lord
[43:00] glory to god hallelujah
[43:02] [Applause]
[43:12] [Applause]
[43:24] like esther if i perish or perish
[43:27] but i'm going in
[43:29] i'm going in this morning got to go in
[43:31] this morning
[43:34] [Applause]
[43:45] hallelujah
[43:48] listen
[43:49] when you're pointing in the right
[43:50] direction the prophecy you could be
[43:52] reckless let your faith get reckless
[43:56] mankind help you forget about them so
[43:58] get you in front of you
[43:59] forget who behind you they can help you
[44:02] if god could help you
[44:11] my god if you just sit down on the
[44:13] platform i'm going to sit down
[44:15] praise god it's god to help me
[44:17] it's got to help us
[44:19] it's got to help you
[44:22] we need him
[44:24] [Applause]
[44:30] [Applause]
[44:47] you feel his presence this morning
[44:52] so therefore
[44:53] the power would rest in place sons
[44:56] because the disciples were given power
[44:58] and that was a temporary power
[45:00] that wasn't resident power in matthew 10
[45:02] power be who like send you power
[45:04] they were associated with jesus and
[45:06] therefore they had the power of jesus
[45:09] he's like you know somebody high up in
[45:10] the government and because you know you
[45:12] are rank
[45:14] because you know the prime minister you
[45:15] know this one you could go up to them
[45:17] because your partners
[45:19] were there with jesus father and they
[45:20] changed his blessing yes yes but when
[45:22] jesus went up the mountain in them had
[45:24] no power the cancer no epileptic spirit
[45:27] because jesus come off the mountain now
[45:30] but hear him upon him
[45:32] those guys was trying to cast all the
[45:34] devil saying look at you
[45:38] jesus told you to cast god and not one
[45:40] you could do it
[45:44] but jesus coming down the mountain
[45:47] here come faith
[45:49] virtue
[45:50] knowledge
[45:51] temperance
[45:53] patience
[45:54] godliness
[45:55] bradley kindness
[45:57] charity a sealed unit
[45:59] that devil know he was trembling jesus
[46:01] jesus started opening his mouth yet and
[46:03] you never want to know when to get out
[46:05] oh glory to god it will speak for itself
[46:09] did you hear what i say
[46:13] [Applause]
[46:14] damn devil said paul i know
[46:17] peter i know
[46:19] but who are you
[46:21] those devils seeing something on the
[46:23] inside
[46:25] oh it was more than a man
[46:26] if you look at the man you would say
[46:28] peter denied christ if you look at the
[46:30] man you say peter cursed that had
[46:32] nothing to do
[46:34] with the plan and program of god for
[46:36] that man like your failures is nothing
[46:41] your failures let me see it good
[46:42] [Applause]
[46:46] that's what the blood is for that's what
[46:48] the blood is for the blood is for your
[46:51] failures your blood is for your mystics
[46:53] your blood is for your sins oh give the
[46:56] lord a soul
[46:57] [Applause]
[47:04] hallelujah
[47:05] [Applause]
[47:07] glory
[47:09] hallelujah
[47:11] hallelujah
[47:12] hallelujah
[47:14] glory to god
[47:16] so brother branham um he was born a
[47:18] prophet
[47:19] born a prophet
[47:22] but god told him do the work of
[47:24] evangelists
[47:25] to do what
[47:27] to grow
[47:28] to mature
[47:30] to writing
[47:31] to be tested
[47:32] and when he loses his wife and his child
[47:34] never said look at you preaching all
[47:35] these years and you're serving lord we
[47:38] the lord wouldn't answer your prayer
[47:39] your daughter would not die too
[47:42] and he was almost given in
[47:44] to say it's true devil all of a sudden
[47:46] something in him
[47:48] not here
[47:49] something inside of here say the lord
[47:51] give
[47:52] the lord take it away blessed be
[47:55] the name
[47:56] of the lord the lord give the lord take
[47:58] it away blessed be the name of the lord
[48:01] what are you crying about what trial
[48:03] have you been to what what what what's
[48:05] so hard get next to yourself
[48:07] listen for no baby baby baby
[48:10] this is for men to be boys to become men
[48:12] oh glory to god this is this is
[48:15] championship time
[48:17] glory you don't go to olympics because
[48:18] you're just taking a run around the
[48:20] block no you go there because you're
[48:22] qualified
[48:23] to enter into races and enter into this
[48:25] and that because it's the best that the
[48:27] world i've got
[48:29] call me now woke up feeling good right
[48:31] now
[48:31] [Applause]
[48:33] so the devil has climax into his very
[48:35] best so god promised to get his very
[48:37] best
[48:40] do i hear a shout in the house
[48:43] no you're beginning to know who you are
[48:45] when god called you he see you as his
[48:48] very best
[48:50] i know you don't feel like it i know you
[48:52] don't feel like it but that does not
[48:55] change it
[49:02] uh
[49:04] [Applause]
[49:19] so whatever elementary processes
[49:21] went through tests and trial and
[49:23] character formation until god dropping
[49:25] him the king's sword
[49:27] and position he placed him as a son of
[49:30] god
[49:31] now he was placed in his position as
[49:33] that elijah
[49:35] to open six seals
[49:37] because christ is the seventh seal
[49:40] that was filled inside of him
[49:42] because he was sent with a message to
[49:43] introduce elijah
[49:45] so not only did he operate as moses to
[49:48] bring the people out but he got the
[49:50] joshua commission with the hand of god
[49:52] open the bible and point from joshua 1-9
[49:57] august the 7th
[49:59] 1957.
[50:02] and god reconfirmed that to him the 20th
[50:04] of september
[50:05] 1965.
[50:07] so william branham had the joshua
[50:09] commission a lot of people get mixed up
[50:11] with that because looking for a physical
[50:12] man to come and say let me go work the
[50:14] line
[50:16] what your father is all about
[50:19] god couldn't give you spirit
[50:21] when you have no seed word
[50:22] if god gave you a spirit without seed
[50:24] you end up by pentecostals speaking on
[50:26] the chandeliers speaking in tongues and
[50:27] going nowhere
[50:31] because dynamics struck the pentecostals
[50:33] they had signs wonders they still do
[50:36] miracles speaking in tongues and whatnot
[50:38] but no character so there was no
[50:39] adoption
[50:42] calling him scandal after scandal after
[50:44] scandal with those pastors because there
[50:45] was no life
[50:47] so of course i'm gonna reboot i'm gonna
[50:49] put my word in the people and use my
[50:51] word in them
[50:53] [Applause]
[50:56] and the word comes to a prophet
[50:58] so when they reject the prophet they
[51:00] reject the word
[51:01] and the word is a channel of the spirit
[51:06] the word is the conductor of the spirit
[51:09] so if you want to see the spirit flow
[51:10] put the word in
[51:11] [Applause]
[51:15] because in this seasonal time god is
[51:17] using his own word
[51:19] that is why the bride cannot fail
[51:21] [Applause]
[51:24] did you get that
[51:26] did you get that
[51:28] this bribe will not be like evil
[51:30] [Applause]
[51:35] [Music]
[51:36] [Applause]
[51:38] eve
[51:39] you said sit down please eve was
[51:41] supposed to stay behind the world
[51:44] and she came off from the word
[51:46] and the devil knocked her down but
[51:47] despite will be the word no false
[51:50] prophet no false teacher no false
[51:53] whatever could throw her off the word
[51:56] because god sent a prophet
[51:59] a seven angel messenger
[52:02] hallelujah
[52:03] who who went up in the in in the mind of
[52:06] god and brought down the mystery of god
[52:08] as the word of god and reveal all the
[52:11] promises of god
[52:13] so we were here to preach promises to
[52:15] you
[52:16] i'm not yet to preach my dream i'm here
[52:18] to bring promises to shake your flesh up
[52:21] to shake your spirit up to rock your
[52:24] soul
[52:25] to the very word of god
[52:30] [Applause]
[52:33] i didn't make the promise
[52:35] god made the promise
[52:37] and if god made a promise he's able to
[52:38] keep it
[52:40] you may be seated praise god
[52:42] hallelujah
[52:44] placing a son take him out to a certain
[52:47] place have a ceremony before angels
[52:50] place him positionally what he is in the
[52:52] body of christ
[52:53] then
[52:54] that person has the authority
[52:58] let me say this
[53:00] if you called me for a fanatic from this
[53:02] night on
[53:03] that
[53:04] very same thing
[53:06] that i'm speaking of
[53:08] will be done amen
[53:11] there will be a power
[53:13] put into the church
[53:15] and know is coming in
[53:17] that the holy spirit
[53:19] will so anoint the people
[53:22] they will speak the word
[53:24] and it will create itself right there
[53:27] we haven't seen power
[53:29] coming in the church now
[53:31] i know it for a fact satanist amount can
[53:34] be moved with no doubt in your heart you
[53:35] can have it what you says
[53:38] the placing of the church in
[53:40] position are you ready
[53:43] where the fullness
[53:45] of the holy ghost of the poor holy ghost
[53:47] comes into the church then the criticism
[53:49] will be shut
[53:50] it will be a short time

[1:11:43] the land and divided to them
[1:11:46] the promised land
[1:11:48] let's call it further
[1:11:50] now you see what coming to the jordan
[1:11:51] meant

[1:12:46] that god left for him
[1:12:48] so he put the seven pendants
[1:12:50] which is in the back of the book
[1:12:52] as the land of promise
[1:12:54] to be divided
[1:12:56] he said we're gonna cross
[1:12:58] take us back there
[1:13:00] that we could see our inheritance

[1:19:05] come on now come on now i want him i am
[1:19:07] man
[1:19:10] glory
[1:19:12] from world war in the park
[1:19:14] god
[1:19:15] is obligated to meet you
[1:19:17] on the basis of them promises
[1:19:21] outside of them promises he can't meet
[1:19:24] you because you don't cut yourself off
[1:19:26] from him
[1:19:28] god is obligated to meet you on the
[1:19:31] basis of them promises
[1:19:33] so when you see them brothers start to
[1:19:35] pray the god of abraham isaac and jacob
[1:19:38] who promised to bring us out and you
[1:19:40] said thy seed shall possess the kid
[1:19:46] let them start to pray to heaven to
[1:19:48] shake you know because they cannot be
[1:19:50] denied

[1:19:54] your blessings could be delayed
[1:19:56] but the cannot be denied
[1:19:58] [Applause]
[1:20:01] give the lord a shout in the house
[1:20:04] [Applause]
[1:20:11] i really want to get god's obligation to
[1:20:13] meet you on the basis of them promises
[1:20:16] outside and promises he can't meet you
[1:20:19] because you don't cut yourself off
[1:20:21] isn't that right
[1:20:23] so therefore until you speak it only
[1:20:26] when you speak it become a promise
[1:20:28] if i just leave right there it's just a
[1:20:29] thought of god
[1:20:30] but when it's spoken it's the word of
[1:20:32] god
[1:20:33] isn't that right as long as it's not
[1:20:35] spoken it's a thought
[1:20:37] so you want to be healed when you see
[1:20:38] and say nothing but you want to be
[1:20:39] healed you ain't claiming nothing you
[1:20:42] have to say i'm going to be healed but i
[1:20:43] start like what's here
[1:20:45] healing his mind
[1:20:46] thought the devil in trouble
[1:20:48] because your face had to light up and
[1:20:50] your face had to roll back the sickness
[1:20:51] that you must have to try to shrink
[1:20:53] the virus had to shrink in your body
[1:20:56] because you had to claim the anointing
[1:20:58] hallelujah praise god
[1:21:02] do you understand what we're talking
[1:21:04] about a woman came up on the platform
[1:21:06] with no eyes
[1:21:09] no eyes in a socket a man
[1:21:12] came up all right and baram spoke for
[1:21:15] the eyes
[1:21:16] and the light come and begin to create
[1:21:17] the eyes
[1:21:19] amidst the middle of creation he said i
[1:21:20] forget to ask you what color you wanted
[1:21:23] [Music]
[1:21:24] what color you wanted
[1:21:26] oh close she's here i hear blue is a
[1:21:28] nice color she had it
[1:21:31] that's what got me talking about
[1:21:33] he create new kidneys pancreas new womb
[1:21:38] new jawbone
[1:21:41] new backbone
[1:21:43] hallelujah
[1:21:45] a new heart
[1:21:47] new spirit
[1:21:50] come on
[1:21:51] yes yes you could change
[1:21:52] [Music]
[1:21:54] we have to want to change you have to
[1:21:56] see the need to change
[1:22:00] [Applause]
[1:22:14] so jesus
[1:22:15] had to speak his words to the disciples
[1:22:18] you have to give them a promise not many
[1:22:20] days hence he had to tell them you shall
[1:22:22] receive power from one hand
[1:22:24] you have to unlock john 2 28.
[1:22:26] it shall come to pass i'll put my spirit
[1:22:29] you have to unlock isaiah 28 with time
[1:22:31] release and another tongue you have
[1:22:33] unlocked the scriptures the old
[1:22:34] testament to them
[1:22:36] isn't that right
[1:22:37] and give them a positive vibes
[1:22:39] an equipment
[1:22:41] to go in the upper room
[1:22:42] it wasn't easy
[1:22:44] they were under pressure
[1:22:45] they went up there and fear the jews
[1:22:47] they shut the doors it wasn't easy
[1:22:50] waiting in the promise of god but it was
[1:22:53] a promise of god
[1:22:54] man didn't make the promise
[1:22:57] god made the promise and if god made it
[1:23:00] we could wait for it
[1:23:02] if god made it we could wait on it
[1:23:05] i will wait
[1:23:07] till my change come
[1:23:09] oh give the lord a shout in the house
[1:23:12] [Applause]
[1:23:15] oh
[1:23:16] hallelujah
[1:23:18] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:23:20] glory
[1:23:22] hallelujah
[1:23:24] so then they received the word first
[1:23:26] then the spirit came
[1:23:27] and the son of man come
[1:23:29] seventh seal
[1:23:31] took the written word
[1:23:32] took the promises of god and these
[1:23:34] divine promises
[1:23:36] that ministers don't want to preach
[1:23:38] because they find it boring
[1:23:39] they find it doesn't tell the story they
[1:23:41] want to tell but these are spirit-given
[1:23:44] words that's why the prophet says say
[1:23:45] what the tips say because them tapes has
[1:23:47] something in it it's not he that say it
[1:23:50] it's god that say it the spirit the
[1:23:53] scripture is god breathed
[1:23:55] holy men moved
[1:23:56] by god
[1:23:58] a man shall bread alone but by every
[1:24:01] word that proceeds out of the mouth of
[1:24:03] god and the mouth of god is his prophets
[1:24:06] so when william branham spoke that was
[1:24:08] the mouth of god
[1:24:10] speaking spirit spoken word
[1:24:12] are you hearing what i'm saying
[1:24:14] therefore the word has to come inside of
[1:24:17] you
[1:24:18] that's what the minister was supposed to
[1:24:19] do
[1:24:20] the secret is
[1:24:21] the word
[1:24:23] is in the bride
[1:24:25] oh give the lord a shout
[1:24:29] [Applause]
[1:24:34] that's why
[1:24:35] that's how you can never understand
[1:24:37] how jesus could find
[1:24:39] way to find this woman of the world fine
[1:24:41] find time to find out this woman i'm
[1:24:43] going to look for this woman and wait
[1:24:44] for this woman oh hell because something
[1:24:46] inside of her that she doesn't know
[1:24:48] inside of her she have a secret she
[1:24:50] doesn't even know people see her flesh
[1:24:51] and spirit and behavior and whatnot but
[1:24:53] she has something deep on the inside
[1:24:55] that he want to unlock he wanted to
[1:24:57] unravel
[1:24:58] he did it and she went free
[1:25:01] oh god let's go out and lock you today

[1:25:47] you i have ordained you to bring forth
[1:25:48] fruit
[1:25:51] [Applause]
[1:26:04] [Music]
[1:26:12] hallelujah
[1:26:14] hallelujah
[1:26:16] so how could gossip dynamics on me
[1:26:18] in 1975
[1:26:19] when i wasn't married yet
[1:26:22] and my sons locked up inside of me
[1:26:25] they are seeds of god
[1:26:27] they have to comfort in their season
[1:26:32] so if i say lord lord rapture me now
[1:26:52] [Applause]
[1:27:01] every name on that book
[1:27:03] going to be expressed
[1:27:05] here the shocker
[1:27:07] all the ages are already taken up
[1:27:10] the life already suck up its people
[1:27:13] we can't go back
[1:27:15] ahead is tribulation or rapture
[1:27:21] [Applause]
[1:27:27] you can keep all the car all the land
[1:27:29] all the money
[1:27:31] you can buy plain hotel spacecraft
[1:27:34] air ship
[1:27:35] you can go out to space and wait for a
[1:27:37] while you're still coming down
[1:27:39] heaven i'm gonna build with the fervent
[1:27:40] heat
[1:27:42] all the atmosphere
[1:27:44] fire fire fire
[1:27:47] oh glory to god but there's going to be
[1:27:48] a rapture
[1:27:50] we shall not all sleep
[1:27:52] but we shall be changed
[1:27:54] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:27:57] at the last chunk of the trumpet
[1:28:00] [Applause]
[1:28:04] oh and this mortal will put on
[1:28:06] immortality
[1:28:08] oh and this corruption gonna put on
[1:28:10] interruptions
[1:28:12] [Applause]
[1:28:19] oh give the lord a shout
[1:28:22] we are getting out of here
[1:28:28] [Applause]
[1:28:33] to the same
[1:28:34] prophet
[1:28:36] this malachi for prophets
[1:28:38] prophesy the ministry of the spirit
[1:28:40] to come to quicken the word to you
[1:28:43] because he said intellectually we hear
[1:28:44] in the message he knew all things
[1:28:47] of in prophecy
[1:28:48] he prophesied intellectually we are
[1:28:50] hearing the message
[1:28:52] but it has to come tender and be done in
[1:28:54] your heart
[1:28:55] it has to come from head to heart
[1:28:58] where the message sort of oozes inside
[1:28:59] of you because that invisible god want
[1:29:02] to become visible
[1:29:03] this is what it's all about
[1:29:05] isn't that right
[1:29:06] so therefore this capstone spirit
[1:29:09] have to come to a capstone world
[1:29:12] so god put that word inside of you
[1:29:14] isn't that right
[1:29:16] so malachi come to restore back the
[1:29:18] faith
[1:29:19] the virtue
[1:29:20] the knowledge that they come to respect
[1:29:22] all them virtues that is what the holy
[1:29:25] spirit had
[1:29:26] they had seven virtues
[1:29:28] that was thundering out
[1:29:30] that the devil couldn't handle
[1:29:32] people were healing peter's shadow
[1:29:34] because the image of god
[1:29:36] was standing in peter oh hallelujah
[1:29:40] when you're coming to peter's shadow was
[1:29:42] healed
[1:29:43] the power was so much in paul
[1:29:45] that when it touched cloth
[1:29:47] garments was anointed
[1:29:49] that when they take that the pew were
[1:29:51] healed everything you touch
[1:29:53] whatever your touch
[1:29:55] your hands anointed
[1:29:57] your foot anointed
[1:29:59] the words anointed
[1:30:01] anointed with god
[1:30:06] [Applause]
[1:30:18] enough sense
[1:30:20] to know how to touch the coldness
[1:30:22] how old you have to give the church
[1:30:24] if a doc can do that by instinct
[1:30:27] what about the holy ghost in the church
[1:30:30] it ought to bring us
[1:30:32] out of all formalities and creeds into a
[1:30:35] glorious
[1:30:37] wonderful
[1:30:38] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:30:40] it brings virtue
[1:30:42] it brings knowledge it brings patience
[1:30:45] it brings godliness
[1:30:47] and the holy spirit and that was under
[1:30:49] the guide so what the prayer was saying
[1:30:52] from 1966
[1:30:54] this guide of the holy ghost was
[1:30:57] supposed to lead the church
[1:30:59] into virtue
[1:31:00] and knowledge and temperance and
[1:31:03] patience whatever you preach
[1:31:06] whatever you teach it's supposed to
[1:31:08] bring it in godliness
[1:31:10] the brotherly kindness
[1:31:11] the charity
[1:31:13] that you could be a partaker
[1:31:15] of his divine nature
[1:31:23] this thing wouldn't live
[1:31:25] he'd have to live
[1:31:27] i want it
[1:31:28] i wanted to live in me i wanted to live
[1:31:30] through me
[1:31:32] my wife have to see it
[1:31:33] my children have to see it you have to
[1:31:35] see it i've got to see it others have to
[1:31:38] see it the critics have to see it the
[1:31:41] liars they go see it too the haters they
[1:31:43] got to see it
[1:31:45] hallelujah everybody going to see it it
[1:31:48] will speak for itself but abraham said
[1:31:50] he will let it be made known among men
[1:31:53] you can hide it the pillar of fire will
[1:31:56] hang over you and say look him here
[1:31:59] this is my beloved son
[1:32:01] look another one here you can hide look
[1:32:04] at daughter mine's here oh give the lord

[1:32:22] oh glory to god
[1:32:24] hallelujah
[1:32:26] oh glory to god
[1:32:29] hallelujah hallelujah

[1:45:04] but first corinthians twisted by one
[1:45:06] spirit we are baptized into one body
[1:45:08] which is the body of christ
[1:45:10] the body of believers by what not by one
[1:45:13] handshake not by one mode of baptism not
[1:45:16] by one feeling but by one spirit
[1:45:19] number one teaching and if i don't
[1:45:21] believe my teaching you're out of it
[1:45:22] you'll believe what i out of it that's
[1:45:24] foolishness keep your teaching

[1:46:20] tell you somebody's a christian
[1:46:22] give me
[1:46:26] [Applause]
[1:46:36] he was bruised toe open beside roman
[1:46:39] spear in order
[1:46:42] by the holy spirit
[1:46:44] we could be baptized into his body and
[1:46:46] become partakers of his divine nature
[1:46:49] you get it then you become a partaker
[1:46:52] after coming into his body a partaker of
[1:46:56] his divine nature
[1:46:57] christ
[1:46:58] nature in you
[1:47:00] how can you cheat
[1:47:02] steal
[1:47:03] lie
[1:47:04] backslide
[1:47:05] proselyte
[1:47:07] and everything else with divine nature
[1:47:09] of christ in you
[1:47:10] it's impossible
[1:47:12] that's why i said after you add these
[1:47:14] things
[1:47:14] charity have to seal it because things
[1:47:17] will leak out
[1:47:19] virtue leaking out knowledge leaking out
[1:47:22] this leaking out but virtue the bund of
[1:47:25] perfectness like elmo's glue
[1:47:28] [Applause]
[1:47:30] when it glue everything down
[1:47:32] then you're a sealed unit of the lord
[1:47:35] god
[1:47:36] and you are sealed
[1:47:38] until the day of your redemption
[1:47:40] devil can't touch
[1:47:42] he can only watch but he can't touch
[1:47:45] a sealed unit
[1:47:46] of the lord god
[1:47:48] then you see vindicated sons
[1:47:50] syndicated daughters with a living faith
[1:47:54] living virtue
[1:47:55] living knowledge
[1:47:56] living temperance living patience living
[1:47:59] godliness living bodily kindness
[1:48:03] [Applause]
[1:48:16] but they're not putting several
[1:48:17] properties in material
[1:48:19] that's what they see
[1:48:21] because that's what he would see
[1:48:23] so you see it too
[1:48:26] the honey sticks there's a phrase
[1:48:29] honey had a stick you had to go by
[1:48:30] somebody
[1:48:40] what kind of honey that private honey
[1:48:44] oh hallelujah it looked like it won't
[1:48:46] stick by the honey
[1:48:52] i'm feeling sticky this morning
[1:48:59] [Applause]
[1:49:06] yeah you could forgive your brother you
[1:49:07] could forgive your sister you could let
[1:49:08] things go you can or you can my nintendo
[1:49:11] you can mine your own
[1:49:14] and even get a bonnet fit
[1:49:17] and put it on your old head
[1:49:22] you could even feed your oat
[1:49:24] and say you really mean it
[1:49:27] and you're keeping it you know then you
[1:49:28] alter the girl
[1:49:30] they can't get better than you you know
[1:49:36] but when you see
[1:49:37] the need for charity
[1:49:39] when you begin to see
[1:49:41] you need perfect love to get out of here
[1:49:43] then you could understand when jesus
[1:49:45] said when he said when you stand praying
[1:49:48] for charity
[1:49:49] for the love of god
[1:49:51] for this total power
[1:49:53] for spirit for dynamics drop your order
[1:49:56] if you have it against any
[1:49:58] the our father pray forgive us as we
[1:50:00] forgive
[1:50:01] those that trespass against us
[1:50:04] and faith is based on
[1:50:06] forgiveness
[1:50:08] so how could they have real faith when
[1:50:10] there is no real forgiveness
[1:50:12] forgiveness means not that the person
[1:50:13] then do it but you drop it
[1:50:15] and you can hug your breath and hug your
[1:50:16] sister
[1:50:17] you can't hold them over the phone you
[1:50:19] know
[1:50:22] you can't hug them

[1:50:40] god didn't say that emoji when he wanted
[1:50:41] us to be willing to know them rascals
[1:50:45] for them
[1:50:45] god shall love the world he said emoji
[1:50:48] no he didn't do that
[1:50:50] god shall love the world he said his
[1:50:51] only begotten son

[1:50:55] named jesus
[1:50:57] hallelujah grow up to pay the price
[1:50:59] of all redemption pay the price that we

[1:51:08] then you become a new creature all
[1:51:10] things have passed away all things
[1:51:11] become new all your warrings and fossils
[1:51:15] and stewards and arguments and tempers
[1:51:19] all these things pass away you see it
[1:51:21] what is the fruit of the spirit we have
[1:51:24] planted it on church membership upon
[1:51:26] shouting demonstration but the fruit of
[1:51:28] the spirit is love love who
[1:51:31] that is when you love those who are
[1:51:32] unlovable
[1:51:34] the fruit of the spirit is love
[1:51:36] you love your family you love your
[1:51:38] friends you love them who love you bring
[1:51:40] cake for you who bring something nice
[1:51:42] for you
[1:51:44] that was the easiest one to love
[1:51:46] gotta bring our chocolate for you and
[1:51:48] you'll be making chocolate for them i
[1:51:50] love you you love me
[1:51:52] but that's not the love you're talking
[1:51:53] about yeah you know
[1:51:54] this love is the love the unlovable
[1:51:56] that's when you're looking to test your
[1:51:57] love
[1:51:58] [Music]
[1:51:59] you're looking for opportunity to
[1:52:01] release this love all this have locked
[1:52:02] up inside of you whenever when you let
[1:52:04] it out
[1:52:06] then you take the opportunity you're
[1:52:07] getting with me i'm going to see what
[1:52:09] you need
[1:52:12] and they come on oh i love jesus
[1:52:14] [Music]
[1:52:16] and jesus said look look so
[1:52:19] glory
[1:52:20] oh you're gonna love me and you can't
[1:52:21] love him
[1:52:22] you have to love one another because you
[1:52:24] are my disciples
[1:52:26] all men will know that
[1:52:28] when that love began to flow so you have
[1:52:30] to have an interest
[1:52:32] in being active and pursuing after love
[1:52:36] pursuing after kindness somebody i'm
[1:52:37] saying rat and anger you could answer
[1:52:40] them back in anger you can
[1:52:42] but you choose to defer that and answer
[1:52:44] back in kindness
[1:52:46] and deflate the whatever they have
[1:52:48] the big airbag of anger put the pin and
[1:52:53] [Music]
[1:52:54] but when that when that airbag of anger
[1:52:56] come up and you started bringing your
[1:52:57] air bag then there
[1:52:59] and there's a big city blowing up
[1:53:02] next made your neighbor hearing and and
[1:53:04] peace
[1:53:05] peace pipe had to come between you
[1:53:07] you don't need all of that you just need
[1:53:09] to apply virtue
[1:53:11] and knowledge and wisdom i called the
[1:53:13] bible said brothers that dwell with your
[1:53:14] wife with wisdom
[1:53:17] it's quiet in here boys
[1:53:21] sometimes wisdom is a distant thing you
[1:53:22] know the bible says let me just tip you
[1:53:24] off either have lack wisdom ask god
[1:53:29] because sometimes you're short on it
[1:53:30] it's god
[1:53:31] but your acts are wavering
[1:53:34] acts and faith believing
[1:53:36] hallelujah that god want to give you
[1:53:37] that wisdom isn't not right the fruit of
[1:53:39] this bridge is love when you love those
[1:53:41] unlovable that's the spirit of christ
[1:53:43] wow love joy peace long suffering
[1:53:45] goodness
[1:53:46] meekness journalist patience there's the
[1:53:48] fruit of the spirit so no matter what
[1:53:49] the church you belong to what you have
[1:53:51] done you can say but a pranam i tell you
[1:53:53] i do this i do that yet i know that that
[1:53:56] i've got it because i can pray for the
[1:53:57] sick and they can be healed brother
[1:53:59] branham god just revealed the word to me
[1:54:01] like this and that and the other i have
[1:54:03] a knowledge of the word
[1:54:05] you're wrong i heal the sick i speak
[1:54:07] with tongues i do these things i cast
[1:54:09] all devils
[1:54:12] in that way she said but ibraham said
[1:54:14] write any word
[1:54:15] listeners reply to that
[1:54:17] jesus said
[1:54:18] many will come to me in that day with
[1:54:20] the same story lord i haven't i cast
[1:54:23] whatever's your name have i prophesy in
[1:54:24] your name he's a depart from me you
[1:54:27] workers of iniquity i don't even know
[1:54:28] you that kind of changes the picture
[1:54:30] doesn't it brother you say brother brahm
[1:54:32] i know a man he does this don't never
[1:54:35] look at a man
[1:54:37] by what he can do in signs of works
[1:54:41] that is where he is nothing he might
[1:54:43] heal the sick he might have gift of
[1:54:45] prophecy he might understand all
[1:54:47] knowledge paul said do i speak with
[1:54:48] terms of men and angels do i understand
[1:54:50] all mysteries are afraid to do mountains
[1:54:52] but have no charity i am nothing i can
[1:54:55] understand the mysteries of god though i
[1:54:57] have prophecy and can prophesy in the
[1:54:59] tongues of men all those things i am
[1:55:01] nothing except first god who loves lives
[1:55:04] in my heart and brings forth the fruits
[1:55:07] of
[1:55:08] the spirit
[1:55:10] in other words the divine nature have to
[1:55:12] come out
[1:55:14] have to be expressed
[1:55:16] isn't that right prophesying is good
[1:55:19] speaking in tongues is right
[1:55:20] interpretation is right but that's not
[1:55:22] the fruit of the spirit that's the gifts
[1:55:24] of the spirit oh praise god be careful
[1:55:29] the fruit of the spirit is love what is
[1:55:30] god love if you can't love your enemy no
[1:55:33] matter what he says about you no matter
[1:55:36] what
[1:55:38] he says about you i won't say it again

[1:55:54] don't worry other philistines
[1:56:07] not with your lips now
[1:56:08] not with your knowledge that you should
[1:56:10] be doing it as a christian

[1:56:14] love them anyway regardless of what you
[1:56:16] say it's time to come to the altar again
