power Domin and forever thou worthy Lord worthy are thou oh God hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah my my my what an atmosphere we feel tonight wow praise God bless you and welcome amen if you have your Bibles i' like to turn to Deuteronomy chapter 8 we want to read 1 to3 Isaiah 55 61 and John chapter 6 57-63 I am moved I'm stirred I'm inspired tonight by the word by what we what God want us to speak tonight amen Deuteronomy chapter 8 1 to3 says all the Commandments which I command you this day shall he observe to do that he may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers and thou sht remember all the way which the Lord thy God LED thee these 40 years in the wilderness to Humble thee and to prove thee to know what was in thine heart whether thou wouldest keep his Commandments or no and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with manner which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man do not live by bread only but by every word that was seed out of the mouth of the Lord do man live from Isaiah 55 reading from verse six seek the Lord while he may be found call upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts let him return unto the Lord for will for he will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will this is a big deal tonight abundantly pardon for your my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayth the Lord for as the heavens higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts higher than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and return it not thither but water the Earth and make it to bring forth and Bud that it may give bread give seed to the sewer and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the things where to I sent it and John last scripture 6 reading from verse 57 Jesus speaking as the living father had sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did Manner and a dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in Capernaum and many therefore of the disciples when they heard this said this is an hard saying who can hear it when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them do this offend you what and if he shall see the son of man Ascend up where he was before it is the spirit that Quicken the flesh profited nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and their life let's go ahead father we thank you for your word tonight and I pray that your word will go out with power and heal the people those that are here that need a touch from you and those that are connected online in Jesus name we ask it amen and amen praise the Lord amen you may be seated blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah and I have a title and the title is my word that goeth forth out of my mouth this is what God Said the word that goes out of his mouth mouth that he might make thee know that man do not live by bread alone but by every word that proceed out of the mouth of God so shall my word be that go forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void and here we hear Jesus saying it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profited nothing the words that I speak unto you their spirit and their life he not talking about from rates and Plato and Buddha and man's word and philosopher's word that is not spirit and life he's talking about words from his mouth when it come out his mouth that makes a huge difference we read a scripture on Sunday for what man knowe the things of a man see the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God and he talk about the things that we speak with not with words of man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth so they are Holy Ghost words or spirit-given words or Spirit spoken words but the natural man receive not the things of the spirit of God but they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned praise God Amen you love him tonight oh praise God so I had this thing written here that your your your life is not a permanent thing your life is not a permanent thing your managing or management is only for a season you are not the owner God is the auor of Life the day of accountability is coming no had 120 years Jesus had 33 and a half years but AB BR had 56 years the question is are you Faithful are you faithful to the one who has called you you elected you predestinated you praise God because he find is rude it's disrespectful it's adulterous to be unfaithful to him because he brought you out he delivered you people is not right he tell them if if you do this I'll bless you and you blessed going out bless coming in I bless your feel I bless your flock I bless your I'll bless I bless I bless and after that he say if your ha fail to do it I will curse you I will shut the heavens over you things will not work I will shut the door in your face say God has sa bless them isn't that right for what obeying his word he said your thoughts are not my thoughts so when you come to church you come to get God thoughts on the matter not your feeling because your feeling have no application in the spiritual realm Hallelujah let me repeat that your feelings have no application whatsoever in the spiritual realm the currency of God is Faith that's what God here not tears not your feeling emotional and you hurt that that have nothing to do with God the only thing God recognizes is faith faith speaks back to him isn't that right and brother and the Bible said anybody that's trying for the Mastery but be temperate in all things or discipline so Mastery is adding to your gift and talent not just relying on the gift and talent some people are gifted talent talent to sing to preach whatever exalt whatever and and music and whatnot and they just stick right there with the gift that God give them nothing added to it but we talking about Mastery now that it have mechanic and it have massive mechanic it have engineers and master Engineers it have doctors and man it have specialized doctors why they get into Mastery have teachers they just getting a pay every month but have real teachers that want to see the teachers see the children bear fruit and learn we talk about striving for the Mastery striving for excellence and that's what God want us to be he's not satisfied that you give him back what you give you he say you're slothful servant a lazy servant come on now multiply what God give you act to your faith virtue multiply what your God don't expect you to you to show him what you give him Lord you give me this all these years and that no no no no no you got to do better than that isn't that right so good stewardship involves risk excellence and hard work stop living as if you have Surplus time that's a big one by punch stop living as if you are Surplus time what you could do today do today don't put off for tomorrow what you can do today because you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow a lot of people in that Los Angeles Fire they never thought that the whole place was burn down flat they never imagine that I saw old man crying he said he has lost everything is that your testimony lost everything wow some of them will get out of Los Angeles you because that going down into the sea there's preparation or know if they think this is bad and this has already crossed a100 billion dollar worth of damage the worst disaster out and it's like a Inferno it's the fire Hallelujah so God making a way for the next part because we know the next part is said to go down into the ocean that will be a whole different thing Al together stop living as if you have Surplus time you don't own that you don't control that it's un loone to you how are you using it treating it managing it what I'm talking about your time we give the Lord some Praises I'm happy to be here tonight something is riding me here tonight all right second Peter 2 and there will false prophets also among the people even as there will be shall be false teachers among you amen this is prophecy who priv shall bring in damnable heresies men opening the Bible and preaching false it's a spirit on them it's a spirit in them even denying the Lord that brought them and bring them upon themselves Swift destruction but many shall follow their pernicious Ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of and through covetousness shall they with fake words make merchandise of you whose judgment now of a long time linger not and their damnation Slumber not quickly just a few and we'll get down to something 1 Timothy 4 1 and two now the spirit speaketh expressly prophecy that in the latter times some shall depart from the fith now what what did the prophet come to do restore our hearts back to the Fai of the fathers in other words bring back the open book the open word being revealed and unfolded some will depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils these devils not working in the carnal B this is Pulpit Devils this is church Devils this is Devils upon men ministers pastors so-called Apostles prophets and teachers are you still with me speaking lies in hypocrisy have a conscience SE with a hot iron I didn't say that the Bible said that men with no conscience behind his death behind the pulpit 2 Corinthians 11:13 says for such are false Apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into Apostles of Christ and no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Light therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as Ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works oh I didn't know Satan have ministers that's just read out to you he has ministers could somebody say Amen I'm not talking from newspaper and I'm reading from the Bible Satan have his ministers they're preaching Bible they're preaching scriptures with deception and and what kind a spirit and I'm saying that to get to something we going to get there Matthew 24112 many false prophet shall arise Jesus speaking and shall deceive many and because of iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold Matthew 24:24 there shall arise false Christ and false prophets they shall show signs and wonders in so much if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect behold I have told you so so Jesus was making it quite clear is not a smooth sailing Everybody is one big family are we going down to the rapture we going to the resurrection no it's not that it's the devil laying snears and traps Hallelujah and our false teachers and false Revelation that people going to follow the prophet now speaks he said Christ not Christ uh not Christ but Christ plural not singular Christ mean the anointed otherwise you want to break it down so we'll understand it the word Christ means anointed false prophets it means anointed one one with a message and the only way the message can be brought out is by one that's anointed and that will be a prophet anointed there shall arise false teaching false anointed false teachings that what his message is Anointed teachers but anointed people with false teaching anointed ones there's a singular Christ but there will be many false anointed ones and their prophecy of what they were teaching would be the difference because they are anointed then he drop into this what is faith faith is something that revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the will of God watch watch this I like that in other words he put Faith as an action not Faith as knowledge information but Faith as a revelation of the will because once Revelation hit you it puts you into action when when Revelation hit Abraham it put him to prepare for Isaac coming you understand I'm saying then when Faith hit Jacob he know he going to wrestle with the angel Hallelujah because Faith struck him he had to go back to his land and when he get fear as he near the land and he near his brother he start to get fearful then he decide to do something send his some I'm some here some here and then he was all alone Faith make him hold on to the angel I say I will not let you go till you bless me in other words Jacob wasn't saying it's business as usual okay the Lord some Praises so Faith does put something in your spirit something in your soul something to inspire you that raises you above your condition you're not here looking for God to pity you you're looking here for the word to give you Faith because Faith come by hearing and hearing by the word of God and when faith is apply you get a result you got a response the churches today don't believe in spiritual Revelation they believe in dogmatic teaching of some system now these words are important be dogmatic teachings means you have to believe it so if you don't believe it so you're out of it Matthew 7 says beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep clothing that that's the clothes alone but inwardly they are ravening wolves ye shall know them by their fruits Hallelujah but notice now it's what they produce that tell you the difference by their fruit man does not gather grapes off a tisle even though the T may be right in the grap Vine he said what is the fruit the word or the fruit for the season what is it their teaching the teaching of what the teaching of the Season what time is it man's Doctrine denominational Doctrine now God didn't send a last day Prophet for us to be right in our spirit and wrong in Doctrine no we have to be right in spirit and right in Doctrine because he brought the full interpretation or the full revelation of Jesus Christ nothing to be added nothing to be taken away it was the complete Revelation because man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceed out of the mouth of God and God's mouth is His prophets he sent Moses he sent Elijah he sent Isaiah he sent William Bram I send you Legend Prophet the if what the words that was coming out of his mouth was God's word hallelujah that word cannot fall to the ground because God himself said my word shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish in other words the intent of the word what the word is to do it shall do because it's my word it's not man's word I am not a man that would lie Hallelujah words have to come out my mouth oh give the Lord a shout Oh Glory to God do you get it now words must come out the mouth of God because when Jesus was in his temptation and Jesus said Satan come and tell him turn these Stone into bread because you know Jesus hungry you telling because you full you know that devil not stupid Jesus is hungry and he tell the devil if thou be turn the stone into bread this the Temptation is Right Rich you know it's right there you ready to eat and Jesus pressed through and said man shall not let by bread alone but by every word that proceed out of the mouth of God Satan dropped down in a certain gear now he he changed gears he start to go in the scriptures now he said okay Jesus the scriptures say if you shall jump down now that is scripture he's quoting it is the word he is quoting but that he is quoting but that is not the amount of God the qu what Satan is quoting is not God's mouth he is quoting a text that he read and he's trying to get Jesus to invig him to make a jump to show off to display power to listen to him amen now if Jesus did it and even is he listen to Satan you know it's not God telling that you know but yet it is scripture and Jesus brst him and say it's also written don't come with that don't try that so the bride will always have it is also written don't come with that don't try that Hallelujah hear a little dear little word on top of word on top of word and when you add all that word it has to be the statue of a perfect man oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah so now you could understand Jesus speaking in Matthew 15:9 but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men oh praise the name of the Lord remember what we said on Sunday at the junction of each age when time runs out man ability Fades we read a scripture where God said the riches of people wouldn't even help them at that time so so the fire in Los Angeles all the money somebody homes is $20 million that's USA and I understand over 100 celebrities have lost their homes completely gone and insurance companies stopped giving Insurance about six months ago so the car go to insurance company and and insurance company say there Act of God not Judgment of go they make all the act of God they don't want to pay those Crooks and robbers when time Runs Out man's ability fade just this week had a earthquake in Japan things was rocking heavy I mean I don't know if you've seen these things but this year start off with a bang a big man six stars lining up this month Seven Stars February 2th next month it start off with a bang it's not going to stop so what if it start a bang like that and Heaven declaring and God start to move what do you think happen in the church what do you think happen among the bride it had to start with a bang praise God I believe January start off with a bang and we are in that bang it's either you're part of the Shaker or part of the shaken but something going to B the shaking and either a part of the Shaker or part of the shaking but things are going to get rough things going to shake that amen hallelujah praise God Amen Jeremiah 175 big scripture thus sayith the Lord curse be the man that trusteth in man and maketh flesh's arm and whose dep heart departed from the Lord years ago Tech and science was just a a sidh show they make a phone they make a this because remember long time P beep and be have a p is a big thing you you think people are pan now so what has happened is this man has gone so far in achievement science that men trust them men trus in AI now artificial in the trust what they really want to bring is God to them you know yes their kind of God a God that they make that they could check they could rely and Trust the intelligence of man human but the Bible said Jeremiah 17:5 thus sayth the Lord cursed be the man that trusted in man and make it flesh's arm whose heart depart from the Lord so Friends The Challenge is the heart it's a heart issue and something struck me the doctrines has become idols so what the churches have is Idol worshippers that is why they they they are bound in the church and some of those men are Witch Doctors because they're casting spells that's why Paul said who had Bewitched you you Galatians who had be Bewitched you to go into legalism to think that your behavior will justify who you are in that by your lord and by your rituals amen oh give the Lord some Praises amen amen so I have here written the devil is not intimidated by six SEALS or by six seal ministers who preach this message under the anointing of loose ends what intimidates the devil is the seventh seal because he don't know what it is the seven seal is a seal of life the life of Elohim seven perfect spirits that connects with the coming of the Lord there has to be something that the devil couldn't touch denominate or impersonate and the only thing he cannot impersonate is the life the life itself he could pretend to be a preacher he could be a pre pretend church and imperson whatever but he cannot pretend to be the life the life will speak for itself Oh Glory to God notice what Harmony Jesus never did anything until the of the father so will be the bride he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it nothing can harm her that's the confidence you have to have in God oh praise God sometime I hope that God helped me to preach about quiet trust people so stressed out and so and so you know frustrated and whatnot but what about the quietness what about the peace in the valley what about waiting upon God what about putting all your burd and leave it there not you're frustrated and you're picking it up and you put it in God's hand you take it out to see if it any happening and you put it back and you pull it back no you leave it there and you rest and you trust and you believe glory to God sometime if you don't want to rest God can put you in a hospital bed you know and you have to rest you have no choice you have a tube here and a tube and a tube there all the time you this to do you had that to do you had that to do but now you all you have to do is to rest and wait for your meals from the nurse bringing your meals and your injections so you could you could bypass all of that to come to a place where you say Lord I know me for so much years I am just this is enough this is it teach me your peace quiet Assurance quiet rest when that widow woman was come in with one more meal to make she said I getting six to make my meal and we go and die I'm my son but something inside of her because God told Elijah I have a widow woman to feed you dear she don't even know that come out the mouth of God hallelujah that word from God came out his mouth so our anointing has been released that to activate that woman to behave and act a certain way and ano is here tonight you are here tonight an anointing will be released tonight from the mouth of God oh give the Lord some Praises this is anointing is to deliver this anointing is to heal this anointing is to set free this anointing is to break the band of wickedness and to break the band of evil and to break the band of bad habits and all kind of habits Give the Lord some Praises because the anointing is to break the yoke he never doubts it nothing can harm and not even debt here is the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word that his wife that his wife talking there that his wife interested in husband pleasing the husband that his wife catching what would please a husband and she could do it amen she know what he want to do in his word she has thus sayth the Lord or she keeps still no one can persuade them otherwise they have thust say the Lord the Bri will have thust say the Lord amen okay let's go Jesus was God made flesh dwelt Among Us the word made flesh he was the body and in that body come water the spirit so we are Washed by the Water of the word and then went in him dwelt in him and there come the life of God manifesting himself through Christ so God was in Christ the anointed one Christ means the anointed one a man that was Anointed God dwelling in him what was it the germ with the flesh the anointed one flesh being Anointed with the spirit of God produce the word of God made manifest so God is invisible until it become flesh the word that is so when the word becomes flesh all of a sudden you see something manifested because it's not the man it's the word made flesh it's the word The Germ activated in the man so Jesus from 12 to 30 years of Silence doing nothing he just in the scriptures when his time came he got baptized fire hit him John saw the dove amen fullness of the spirit dwelt bodily in him and right away he was led by the spirit Into the Wilderness to face Lucifer without a deacon without Elder without church support without song leader and specials and play the or music there for me without all of that and he hit the devil for three steps it is written it is written it is also written and the Bible said he returned in the power of the spirit he had the power and God take it off of him to face the devil Dre what you call it a biscuit dry dry so truth is Wilderness you know not by the beach you know he went to the Wilderness you know note the condition dry dry couldn't feel nothing but he believed the word could no nothing it is written it is written God said so the word is in my heart Thy word have i hidden my heart that I might not sin against thee the word was in him and the word is in you even in thy mouth oh give the Lord some Praises Give the Lord I shout in the house man I feel F in the building the word is in you even in my mouth even in thy heart you got to speak amen hallelujah and when Jesus finished so if the anointing hit him here and this is Wilderness Wilderness all here all here all here all here and when he hit you no come back up on him the devil here he get shock here now he have go and get recuperate from that he get voltage so he going and take shock protection shock shock insurance he going for something else but Jesus returned in the power of the spirit Hallelujah the anointing is upon Him nobody can see it nobody can sense it they can't smell it they can't taste it he went in service normal and they invite somebody to read

want is a cry don't be ashamed I'm to say I'm hunging for God don't care whether the deacons pastors whatever is around scream out anyhow the Jones are sitting there what difference does it make cry out anyhow because that's the way you get it so the seed here we go sometimes there are no genuine new birs is because the seed will sympathize with the word but they don't want to R away from the old system I cannot understand how people could come out of false churches false teachers and they know it false and they wouldn't put dynamite and bums and blow up the whole thing behind them they still want to connect with umbilical cord well I my spiritual father and I come from Day history and history and history if I know I was under a false teacher a false Pastor false children what I come out

men because of the lineage our fathers in the wilderness we know Moses we know Abraham who are you he said before Abraham was I am well that that one send them skic that one sent them nuts he said before Abraham was I am Jesus went back in the pH he know they didn't understand what you're talking about but he rocked them because that was the Revelation that was puled inside of him you talk

Hallelujah Hallelujah the Bible said they shall lay hands on the sick it didn't say pray you know it didn't say pray you know just lay hands on the sick and they shall recover why because the anointing that was in Christ the anointing that was in God flow through Christ the anointing is Christ flowing through you hey glory to God hallelujah [Music] hallelujah hey when when them guys with

this is coming out my mouth my word carry done void pick up your bed and walk the man pick up the bed Hallelujah and walk who could talk now who could argue with that now who could question the fruit of the teaching pick up your bed and walk and that man walk I am telling you tonight before the false anointed get anointed the true anointed will be anointed before the false anointed can claim the anointing the true anointing will come forth first God will vindicate the elect as the original dollar and then the counter feet will be printed off of that oh give the Lord some Praises tonight give the Lord a showout tonight did you get that did you get that God will anoint the pray to be the original tell and then the counterfeit the devil will PR it off for that said they tried to hold on to the old system and claim this but the old system must die and rot in order to bring forth a new one Hallelujah he said this here now I'm going to skip them quickly Hallelujah systems does not have life oh word Believers give to my message hear me not my message but his message that he firmly declares to be the truth you've got to choose him somewhere you can't sit still after this the Bible said his wife had made ready to become his wife what does she what kind of garment she had on his own word she was dressed up in his righteousness the churches they build so much systems around the word until he shook her off her rocker when she came she had bird pains what was it here we go back to the word back to the life systems doesn't have a life that's why church scrumble it's built around a man when a man die or or something happen everything fall apart because built as a system it doesn't not built correctly system doesn't have a life it's only God's word has life the systems are built around it where it does not have life it's the word that have life oh praise God and this is what I want to get to Hallelujah praise God he said talking about Book of Revelation 19 and this angel of Light remember the that last Angel the last angel came to bring light saying what calling him out of Babylon caught up in the CH in in in in the cage watch this now the church had rejected Christ and Christ is the word watch that had been rejected and this Angel's message messenger come from God was echoing his message on the Earth to come out of Babylon come out of the organization here we go this the part I want to get to the Holy Spirit today the manifestation of the holy spirit is that angel trying to get the people back to the word here's why because the holy spirit will only vindicate the word what word the word from the mouth of God that word will be Vindicated Hallelujah the holy spirit will only indicate the word holy spirit is not going to V churches we believe this it has to be the word do you get it and the word is not partial now every man is subject to the word watch this Messenger on Earth was so inclined to God that when he spoke on Earth God echoed the same thing from heaven so when a man claim yeah we go this is big when a man claim he hear from Heaven he had to Echo the same thing that this Prophet spoke because what the prophet spoke echoed in heaven so when Heaven dropped down a revelation it has to compare oh give the Lord some Praises let me say that again that word saying again the messenger on the Earth was so inclined to God that when he spoke on Earth God echoed the same thing out of Heaven what is the fourth verse translation what the it means God's voice speaking to his predestinated people so anytime the voice of God drops down from heaven to you anyone it will Echo the same thing that this Prophet was inclined because he was the seventh Messenger to the seventh age the final age and even though he's not here the word prophecy was given for the entire age oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah God took the prophet 1965 but the prophecy is for the entire age amen because he caught the mind of God for the age and put it on books and tapes that's what we preaching tonight oh blessed be the name of the Lord do you believe that tonight Hallelujah and the voice said and I took the book of The Angel's hand go and and and and the voice tell John which give me a little book take it eat it up and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many people's nation and Tong that mean the bride will have the testimony of Jesus the bride will have the spirit of Prophecy but brandham he said he sending a Vindicated prophet he sending the prophet after almost 2,000 years he's sending someone who is far from organization and as John the Baptist Elijah old he will hear only from God he will have dust say at the Lord and speak for God he will be God's mouthpiece he as it is declared in Malachi 4:6 will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers he will bring back the elect of the last day and they will hear a Vindicated Prophet not no Vindicated man in Trinidad and man in Europe and a man every way and who Vindicated it and who want to correct the prophet and who want to say better than the prophet them is Liars them is just m Champions and so on it's one voice it's one messenger it's Seven Stars not 24 stars and one from Trinidad it don't have that it's seven stars that was in his right hand and William Mariam brandham was one of them Stars oh give the Lord some Praises that star still Shining Light that star still reflecting light go give the Lord a shout let's go he will bring back the elect of the last day and will hear a Vindicated Prophet give the exact truth as it word with Paul he will restore the truth as they had it here we go are you ready and those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the Lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his works oh glory to God the church can no longer speak for God they could no longer speak for God then God sent Wesley he was the voice for that day the people took the Revelation become the word Methodist fail the now we say yes sir the church now now is no longer the mouthpiece of God it is its own mouthpiece they speak the Revelation and like salt and pepper and like tomato ketchup they sprinkle a little message on it a little brother brown on it just to make it look like it's messy you know what I mean sometime you shake her empty and all sprinkle so really and truly they have their own message as I told the ministers I said I ain't coming to this message for men to tell me their Revelation I'm not interested sorry I F that a long time I want to hear what this Prophet say I want to hear this word this is why I stayed with all these years I move from it from 1975 to now I want us I want this this is what God revealed to me to stay with this and it will be Vindicated I know this word we preaching will be Vindicated Hallelujah if we stay with the word it must be Vindicated God can't lie hallelujah hallelujah all right here what he say now the mus come please the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it is his own mouthpiece so God is turning on her he will confound her to the prophet and the bride are you ready for the voice of God will be in her you know the some of the books Mark the voice of God are the books that voice of God will be in her so when the bride speak who's speaking God will be speaking so watch yes he give a scripture for it for Revelation said the spirit and the bright say come once more the world will hear direct from God as at Pentecost he said it specific what how they arrive at Pentecost Christ Jesus was son of man the disciples was bride message believers when son of man opened the word and the understanding and opened the not the the the scriptures to them they went in the upper room and the tongues of fire came down and filled them with the Holy Ghost that bride material represented by Peter step out that same man that Deni Christ that same man that was frightened he had the anointing on him of the land of of Judah and he said this is the stone that you Builders refuse this is that that the prophet Joel spake of Peter was God's voice what shall we do to be saved he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost hallu you get that let's read this back now once more the world will hear here direct from God as at Pentecost therefore there's going to be another Pentecost there's going to be another Dynamics to the mechanics there's going to be another Super outpouring of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and the world will hear direct from God oh my is cried out you have the word you have more Bibles but is that he said you only talking taking what you want leaving out what you want you are not interested in living it but debating it I'll reject that and I'll close he done had to ear let him hear what the spirit said the churches this is the last warning there will be not another the throne rule have been set up the 12 foundations have been laid the streets of gold have been paved the gates of gigantic pears are raised and hinged like a pyramid she stands so fair and glorious the Heavenly beings who have prepared her watch breathlessly for she glistens and shines with the glory that is unearthly every facet of her beauty tells a story of Amazing Grace and Jesus love she's a city prepared for prepared people she awars only for her inhabitants and soon they will trong her streets with joy it is the last call the spirit will not speak in another age the ages are over but thank God at this moment this age is not over he is crying his cry is not only in the spiritual ears of men by his Spirit but once again a prophet is in the Land once more God will reveal the truth as he did to Paul the spirit and the bright say come the corner weat that fell into GR and I has come back to original Green again yes listen to the authenticated prophet of God who appears in this last age what he says from God the bride will see the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing and what they say will have already been said in the word they are saying it now come out from among her now and be separated he that had an a them here the spirit has spoken the setting son is about to fail into Eternity for the church es then it will be all over then it will be too late to come but if somewhere in this series God has dealt with you by his Spirit may you even now turn to him in Repentance and give your life to him that by his Spirit he may give you eternal life just bow
