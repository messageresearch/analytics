that tonight father have you wait tonight in jesus name i ask it amen and amen who praise the lord i am god bless you i'm welcome i'm grateful all of you here tonight to be here and um tonight is a special service and what can i see i am i have something upon my heart i it is it's on parenting i want to touch something about parenting tonight parenting a story let's talk um so i am thankful for having this opportunity for this kind of session to talk different things that would help that would edify that would straighten us in some way and this is a very interesting topic because and i call it i didn't want to call it tips and and and so on like in that way for parenting but i wanted to something was striking me about parenting as a story that everybody have a story in reference to parents and even though you may be a child or a young person or teenager it still referenced you and i in some way whether you're old you're young you're single you're married you have no children it doesn't really matter because once you understood you are the product of a union between two people male and female so you have had parents half parents or you will become a parent but somewhere along the line it will be unfolded in your life so i'm hoping that something be said in this little session that will give you a i call it aha moment you know for some of us our parents are gone and we have memories of maybe they're being strict memories of their guidance or what they feel to do or what they did and sometimes we can't place it as we would like to because we accept them as they are or parents mother father or caregiver or stepfather whoever that stood there uh that had that care over your life but at some point in time we have to be able to look again at them at ourselves and what we will leave as a legacy for the next generation if there's to be a next generation this topic is vast and varied and there is no way it could be covered in one session and that's why i wanted to call it like a part e and that's why i kind of pull out a story because there will be other parts to this that i hope that the lord inspired me to bring to you and um i think that um you know this helps us get away from that religious covering and and understand we live in a real world where relationship comes where the the people who have influences in our early childhood it's it's influences over our lives and her guidance tears to where we are what we are and who we are so i trust tonight that this will really have something for everyone and um so let's talk i want to read a scripture from ephesians chapter 6 there's one scripture read tonight ephesians 6 verse 1-4 i think i want to get captured this year from the scripture ephesians 6 1-4 and it says children [Music] obey your parents in the lord for this is right honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment we promise reason verse 3 that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth verse 4 honey fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord let us pray again heavenly father i thank you for this scripture tonight and this word and this thought and this is something that i long to get delivered to the people and don't know how and i still don't know how it will be tonight but i commit this time into your hands and the few broken up words and thoughts and inspiration their hands that you would take it and and paint the picture that needs to be painted granted lord blessed tonight and jesus might ask it even this scripture or ephesians 6 1-4 in the amplified just want to read in the amplified says children will be appearance in the lord as his representatives for this is justin right honor esteem and value as precious your father and your mother this is the first commandment with a promise that all may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth fathers do not irritate and provoke your children to anger do not exasperate them to resentment but rear them tenderly in the training and discipline and the council and admonition of the law so look at two things here one the first was with children this is the children looking up to the parents verse four with fathers this is like parents dealing with the children so you cannot separate it you cannot separate it is parents and children and this is what god has allowed and god has permitted for us to be partakers of all right the family the family is the most important influence in a child's life the family and children as children look forward to be raised being protected being provided and the mother father are the first teachers where the child began to nurture from grew from and the mother and father if there's such that they become the exemplars for that child so i trust tonight that everyone that will see something and what we're gonna share tonight grandparents parents unmarried if you have no children we are here we are all born between a product of a union between a man and a woman and whether we accept this or not we are shaped by who have raised us and how we have been raised we are product of human relationships and we spend our lives in the context of relating to other people so who we are what we are is a function of our connections and our relationships and the people we choose to surround ourselves with let me say that again who we are what we are is a product of our relationships and who we choose to surround ourselves with you know you are limited by your friends and your associates who you choose to associate with and over the years church church is an interesting place in terms of human connections and relationships it's very very interesting you can go on a job be it an engineering job there are jobs that you work with people at the contract there are jobs that they work with things like machinery and so on and you're limited by the expertise that around you that particular aspect but church is a different thing altogether church has people from different backgrounds settings scenarios experiences careers jobs qualifications and and come from different backgrounds and they all come together saying hallelujah praise god hearing the same gospel and same word and their lines are honed by different experiences in their own home environment i remember a particular brother's wife and family after service they would leave almost immediately why because he experienced some difficulty in some other church and you don't want to get any confusion so he doesn't mix with anybody as far as he concerned he comes to church he goes back home he limits that relationship and what that does or what he doesn't see is how that affects his children because the children needs that connection needs that friendship and relationship so sometimes our behavior as adults as parents affecting seen and unseen unknown so i hope that this challenges us to think different to be better and want to be better and to do better because there is no school of parent and that is why i want to introduce this talk on parenting let's talk as a story your story my story our story the individual story and i could give you an example henry and i we got marriage at the age of 21 and what do we know absolutely nothing nothing nothing about finance nothing about parenting nothing about racial children we literally ignorant yet after 40-plus years children grandchildren we know some stuff now we know some stuff that we could share and we can hope that our stumbling block will become your stepping stone that where we bounce our foot and hit our head um you don't have to it doesn't make sense we reinvent the wheel it doesn't make sense you get your hand and head bruised where we got it when we could tell you don't go there don't do that approach it this way that way and you get a heads up on life a thumbs up on life that gives you an edge to survive and depress and to move forward and i hope that this strikes you tonight okay now because we need relationships and life is about connections sometimes it becomes difficult to manage because there's no school of relationship even as there's no school of marriage there's no school of parents personally i believe certain things should be taught in schools and it's not you know chemistry mathematics and whatnot and like for church they no longer dress and wear a tie and come to church and worship a god anything like that but you see uh what we call uh this thing called life and how we could do better in how we live not just with ourselves but with others it is not taught so you're good you don't get this in school to say well a school of how to be the one of to be a great parent i want to be a great dad i want to be a great mother i don't just want to have track you know and i know i'll be jumping here and jumping there it has some mothers no offense to anybody here i'm not speaking with anybody in mind i personally love parenting i i i was i couldn't wait to be a parent i couldn't wait to be a father it was a real excitement for me and um personally i could say i enjoy this thing called parent one time i felt i could write a book on parents and i wanted to but it's just not has that material i enjoy it i know there are parents who did not enjoy it and there's a reason for that but i was blessed and and was helped i got to enjoy this thing called parenting because i see it as shaping lives shaping lives that would affect the world shaping lives that will affect communities that will affect another generation so it has these women who put it this way they don't have this maternal instinct they don't have this maternal thing the child is i'm just a mother not just i make a baby or they see the fathers who have a similar sort of thing let's call it child father or child mother not not this neutering caring concerned burdened a parenting overshadowing like oh god said can a mother forget a stop and say i know i cannot forget you you engrave in the palms of my hands we know god is the first parent he had his concerns he made preparation at gardner eden he placed man and his wife he told them to replenish you know just up to the earth multiply and that multiplication was to actually make a reproduction of themselves another adam another son so we're going to see that parenting really is to bring a child son or daughter into a place of maturity and independence where the parental influence is no longer needed now you might find me repeating this because i haven't sort of written type down and so on like that so i'm just saying freon right now but to me this is what parenting is all about and we find that some parents they feel or they don't catch that the children is unknown to them this is very important the children are not yours they are unknown we are stewards of these gifts of god that was placed into our hands as babies and the scripture we read we are called the reason and the fear and the admonition of god this is what it's about and i apologize if if i'm jumping here and jumping there because all what is a me is not in sequence i might be in a certain order so i'll be kind of hitting here and you know just jumping here as i said to you i have nobody in mind i'm not committed to knock anybody or hit anybody that is not the intention of this tonight this is to edify you and make you i hope you can get the aha moment to say well aha i could understand why my dad acted like that you know there's some people okay maybe you lost your mother or father and um and you miss them and you wish they were wrong but is that what parenting is about i don't think so i believe that you have to see yourself as getting this strength and maturity that you don't have to go backwards to say well you know if my mother was here my father was here then what because when you drill down deeper you ask yourself what did they know how did they do how did they feel it is unfair to put like a test exam to parenting because there is no one way to do that it has the helicopter appearance and i hope maybe we could talk a bit about that sometime the only hovering hovering like a helicopter over the children even when the children get married they're still over it they're hovering over and hovering like they called to just over over their child from birth to old man if i could use that it has the disciplinary anti-parent no much smiles but the belt is always nearby or the rod and the strictness is always fear it have the liberal type current you can do what you want you know i mean as long as you stay within bonds and so on like that and the liberal type like when the children get big enough to say they're on their own i remember one one mother said when somebody was interested in a daughter you say you're taking her at your own risk so her daughter was coming with a disclaimer and you know some parents happy to get the chair in all the house not because um is because they can't seem to manage so it's best that they go better they get married that's how they get a house and anything like that so i know i'm kind of jumping jumping here but we're going to get some tonight so i i'm hoping for the clarence that this really really edifies and helps in some ways free for me all right let's go okay so now as parents and we have older ones among us as then as we get older responsibility chefs with the children in handling the older parents and you know i remember and speaking to her sister say when unless you brought something for yourselves she has a lot of children and so on and she's here tonight you know i'm speaking about her for sure and she's a long time burning faster buy for children and i told her i said don't live for your children live for christ i see your children will get big and they will leave and go on their own i guess she watched me and made me watch the kind of strange because a lot of mothers other parents they do so much for their children sometimes they just not just too much they just do they just do too much they actually spoil their children some of them the children are smothered by love what the parents think is love it's not really love it's being smothered covered and the children don't grow in a balanced healthy way so for us who are getting older we have to begin to appreciate solitude appreciate the kind of silence appreciate the times where our own children would have dear family to see about their own interests to see about and they may not have time for mom and dad this is also part of life where our own children become busy with their own lives so we have to learn and grow to the understanding that it's not like we are no longer relevant but the same burden of responsibility no longer applies because your children now have their own responsibilities and that is where it shifts from parent to grandparents when you find yourself connecting with grandchildren okay so i have something that i have here right now so this thing called relationship it's not something that is strong on us something that we are gifted with is something that we see is something that we learn i was blessed and fortunate not to have complexes i i don't know i can't remember ever having like a complex conflict being the ninth child of a family of twelve i i heard my brothers talk about who my father preferred and whatnot and i don't know about that i can't even remember what i thought i was young and swollen and i can't remember about that preference and what my father loved my mother preferred or whatnot all i know i live i i i survived i i pressed i fought and everything else so you know it's something else when you're free from complexities because when you have complex and it's not dealt with it goes along with you and could affect you one thing i could see when i was young in primary school i got bit by a dog and after that dog and i wasn't very close no one of my friends andrew he has three doors i'll go by him actually to him as some dogs i get a reconnection back but i choose as a parent not to put my own mind problems on my children let them be able to sort out and deal with their own challenges and honestly why put my fears on them this is what parents do this is what some pastors do so with complexes you know it adds to the weight of this thing called parenting and relationships so that's there's so much things going through my mind i mean i'm hoping that that that it helps somebody in some way you know um so parenting is leadership that's how i see that real parenting is leadership to raise a child under the protection and security of love care support discipline neutering and mentorship to bring a child son or daughter to maturity independent of mother and father this part is important because if you appreciate that your sons and daughters and children alone to you or given to you as a stewardship then you have to understand some point in time you have to release them some parents don't release their children the children are permanent children and they are permanent parents in that sense and that is not scriptural that is not what it's supposed to be the object is every feature brings forth after it's kind if you look at a thick sucker tree sometime before the fig even beer or put forward figs you see two young suckers at this side it's almost as if nature's singing before you produce you have to have a next crop or next generation or next conde next connection that would come to the same maturity when they think come to maturity now you cut the bunch of fig off cut down the whole plant the others coming strong right up to show it's not done it's the reproduction of the original and this is the same principle in humankind that as humans are sons of god god wants us to produce other songs songs that come into maturity and i had it written down isn't this what ephesians is four is all about that we come to maturity one that we can sort be no more children toast to and fro so the object of this thing called parenting is to take this bundle of love in your hands eight inches long ten inches long one tongue two pongs or whatever and bring that up to such a maturity that the other part of the scripture could come into place for this cause shall a man leave his mother and father and cleave to his wife in other words it has to be that this thing called parenting brings us to that spot of bringing who god has placed in our care to bring them into such maturity that we are happy and pleased and blessed to see them get on their own stand on their own and serve in the lord or give the lord a hand to pray but this to me is what the gospel is all about to raise up seas of the righteous to bring people in the fear and the acknowledgement of god not to raise them religious no but to raise a meta understanding about all things that pertain to life and godliness oh blessed be the name of the lord parents read children parents raised bandits robbers teachers lawyers prophets priests king and all in between someone has rocked that baby someone has raised that child you can raise a child that affects the whole world or either child influences nothing at all that's part of the power of parenting they are good parents they are bad parents they are terrible parents they are disrespectful parents a disrespectful son or daughter would eventually become a disrespectful parent who would raise disrespectful children the chain of command starts with you what you are who you are and more importantly what have you become is what will influence your child or children some parents are comparative they are competitive and that competition goes on and pass on to into the children churn becomes competitive and that competitiveness it affects them in sharing sharing what they know sharing what they have in a long time i remember in the early days years ago before it had all this internet the big thing that was selling was um encyclopedia and if you have these bunches of pizzas like this will make it brainy and cabriniak and make it bright and everything else so people were peddling encyclopedia that tons of different types of encyclopedia all the books all the research but when the internet break and information as the bible talk about knowledge shall increase information is now on the floor information is known to type in any question could be answered it may not effect these big hard big books that people stuck up in the library and stuck about home and whatnot because the knowledge is here and friends what i'm sharing tonight is not anything new the knowledge is already here of life of parenting of of how to raise children and how to do better it says dear it is all there some parents live their lives to their children instead of seeing their children as a loan from god to see their children as an extension of their own ambition of what they did not achieve they are extremely proud of the children not just of the children's achievement but in some weird way they actually live their lives to their children that is why they stay over and over they always appear somewhere influencing everything possible they can and even to the point of being manipulative now there are three positions that you could be in right now you have had or have parents you are now a parent or you are going to be a parent so whatever position you're in you could look back and see the actions and decisions of your own parents if you're a parent now it depends upon what stage your children in his life your children could be very young maybe two years and under three years and under five years another your children may be a little older get an injury all in between 13 14 15 your children could be much older in the 20s and so on there are questions what is this thing called parent why grandparents what do you do what do they do what can we learn from our parents or from parenting what things we should see what things we should not see what things should we do what things we should not do how can we improve are we parents forever is it that as our children gets more mature we become mentors and influencers into their lives i don't know one mother telling a daughter i could say what i want because i name you well of course that is i'll give you your name then i could i could you can't tell me anything and and that is not really the way and one of the things i do as a parent is at ten years to my children this one should come on that tip okay we'll call that tip what i should do when they are five i used to say next 10 years they'll be 15. and guess what i also did that in church so when i see a five-year-old a 10 year old i would think next 10 years they're going to be 20. what next no i didn't read that in a book or that's something that i personally do and enjoy doing adding years to give a visual as well they are going to be not where they are and where you see they're going to be you could make preparations you could treat them a certain way and you know i i can't ever remember disrespecting my children i can't ever remember you know negative with them i rebuke them correct them and whatever i have to do deal with them but the point about it is that i see and i try to see down the road and i want to encourage you to do that don't just look at 13 they're 15 they're 40 ask yourself what happens next 10 years if you keep focusing on where they are it could affect to me and that is what i did it could affect how you deal with them in where you want them to be because of what you see in a hand you could help guide them and direct them this is what you can do for example i worked in government service for many years most of my life and i kind of purpose in my heart that my children must not work in government service i cannot tell them don't work in the commercials i'm not in empowered to do that but this is in my heart what i could do is bring guidance bring an influence that will move them away from that so i was able to say influence them in some of their subject choices like business economics and so on because i wanted to get them into business i saw uh sitting there like a certain documentary garments there was just the tax man the axe man and you just stuck there in a rut with nowhere to go so i told myself you see this i don't want my children this at all and i this was in my heart and it's hard to you now remember and i i learn things because i i remember trying to push push up brother in ambition and the brother thought i was harassing him no i i i tried to light fire on him because he was too laid back and slow and if you know anything about me i am not in this um slow march thing you know i believe in peace getting things done i believe in defiance and so so then i learned from that because he reacted negatively to me trying to push him now here's what i discover there are some people when you tell them something negative they react completely opposite to that now that's your children that you have and there are some now when you tell them something negative they take it negative and they freeze so if you know your children that's why i'm saying it's not one-size-fits-all parenting is a story because a lot depends upon the child i know there are certain children you tell them you cannot make it and they will prove to you that they can make you tell them they cannot do it they will succeed they actually respond with the negative inner positive under some children with the negative they actually respond negative they freeze they fall up they say that is whether you are dumb you are depressed and they hit that dog on the press you cannot tell that different strokes for different folks that's the reality that's why you cannot treat all the children the same you have to have the discernment of each child to deal with the child to be an effective carrot there are some parents the banana cut into tree you're treachery the pineapple cut into three everything is the same it doesn't work that way some may have appetite for the whole banana and some may not want the banana they might like orange so if you get that one get a whole banana and a whole orange you cutting these pieces up and share with everybody because all are your children god don't even deal up with his children jacob is one thing abraham is another thing noah is another character more than another character joshua another character god have different guys different men different ways and he deals with them differently just those of our children so i hope that you would see something from all of this tonight and it would help you re-look and review how you deal with things now so so parenting is to bring a child to maturity and independence and that job and we said the same again is about over when that individual no longer needs the oversight of parents i think i think my wife sometimes told me about some his parents were dentists and he wanted to be at them and he um and they wanted their son to be a dentist and he hated this dentist he hated it and um it was very unfortunate but he rented because of his parents and eventually he did something with somebody's teeth and mouth and got sued and end up in prison and whatnot but it was a terrible thing and this is parents now who want their will and dictates and career choices upon their children and determine what they will do and what they will not do that is not right that is not how it's supposed to be we have to be able to work with them and and and see how best to influence them correctly in serving the lord and and soviet god this is what this is about so therefore i want to bring some stories now i call it little snippets and i know they are much more than this but i i trust them that um you know your own story so these are some snippets and some stories i guess your parents wish they could have told you and i have this only compassion one of love my parents didn't show me love my mother my parents didn't show me love in my life i found out afterwards my mother wanted a girl but she got me instead i didn't see love from her now i'm seeing that now this is not near i'm not talking about this is not my experience it's not my i'm just telling you a story and it this story could vary in different ways and um but let me just continue here i didn't feel love from her but what if you heard your mother's story how she was abused how she never experienced the love you needed and the love you wanted and she find herself short and she didn't know what love really was so she couldn't give what she did not have you need to forgive your mother this is very very very important when you could look back and you could really and i have it under if your parents could speak back to you what would they say for example you ask your father or mother a question or your parents a question and there's no answer and you say but why and your parents say because i say so but what if they could explain to you that they said that because they themselves didn't know and when you think back oh aha they didn't know that is why they behave like that that is why they acted like that had they had known or or if they had the answer it would have been different that is true parents afterwards you realize is just like you boys and girls young people that got married and didn't have a compass didn't have a guide or didn't have a map and they did what they did to the best of the ability with the tools that they have so this is just an example and i know that there are many many examples the other one i want to talk about is communication and and this one is a live one this one is the one that a young man spoke to me about his father don't talk with him his father doesn't really talk to him and he's angry i'm very angry but he doesn't know his father's story his father's story is that his father father or this young man's grandfather didn't talk much because he dropped out of school did not have words or the confidence to communicate effectively that was passed on to his father and this is where i want to bring it to you that every parent have a story you may not know the story you may not know why some of the dads are so easygoing some of the mothers are so hard while some of the mothers are easy going on some of the dads i had you don't know what we could trust and this is for you is that they all try to do their best for their children i miss their complexes and mix their failures and miss their challenges because they are failures they are short comments they are challenges and they are with us every day but we stand as parents we stand looking back i remember i mean a day my father wanted to give me a haircut and i knew my father didn't have a barbecue my father was a tailor this season was like a taylor scissor and i know that he's not going to cut it i was in school during age and i climb up a tree a plum tree and tie my head with with a with a shirt and my father said come to get you here i wasn't coming i was there retreat but my father took a belt well because of those are you sure i got licks plus the haircut no when my father died 1981 my son isaac was about one year old and i held on held him up looking at him and tears in my eyes and i'm going back in memory of my dad putting licks on me and disciplining me and i recognized that is love he loved me and he wanted me to go right at the time you know the bible talk about no [Music] discipline or chastisement is is this is happy or joyous or whatnot at the time i couldn't have seen it what i saw with my dad i never saw him hit my mother um he was always hard-working he got an accident and he broke his hands and i was the one that used to go to him to make market go every saturday and holy basket and he would buy the cucumbers and the tomatoes and everything else and through that i enjoy going to the market i enjoy choosing my stuff and so on that i still do and it is something that you can look back and see as examples and then the commitmental love the commitment of family and it's just something that is just part of what i believe and see and i know and would like to share this thing called parenting and um you know it's it's when you look and see that you are being given a responsibility to shape lives not just have children oh gosh this child can't stand it no more no not that to understand that they go through stuff like when my grandson's here i was talking to him a little bit he said grandpa i want to talk i want to speak i say okay are you six years old but he recognized that he had the confidence that he wanted to talk to us i have to listen to him the other day i know he was talking to him and telling him something and he said and we tell him how to do something he said grandma i have my own ideas no no what are you doing with that he's six years old and he in his creative juices already recognized that he could think and arrange and rearrange stuff so you recognize that there's a small man you have there you see the reality is this the little babies that is that baby you know i know anybody think that babysitting but but he beat me babies if you need that baby to get big without the feared motion of court that that little sweet little baby will become a big man sinner or daughter so we have to really be grateful to god and thank god for his grace and his love and his kindness to us that help us along livestream oh so you have to forgive your parents that is the only things that i find difficult because i recognize a lot of people stuck in complexes with at the parent level my stepfather didn't like me my mother was just my brother was this or whatever it is and you can't seem to let it go when you have to because it's affecting your life and um you know like this communication thing because the grandfather didn't talk to the father the father didn't talk to his son and then so here when i told this son i said okay i said your father is not communicative with you i said now what happens to the future i say you have to know what you will tell your children when your time comes now that young man wants to leave home because he finds the environment it's not good i said uh would you leave your job now said nope i said why you want to leave now i still still young i say what can you learn at your home i say what what are you running in life to leave home now for doesn't doesn't make any sense and you could see because we preach on us already freedom is our responsibility young people want to be free they find it the mother they want to be free some people can't wait to reach 18. i get 18 is a magic number i don't know what i think and after 18 is 19 then 20 and 21 then you wish you were 15. when you hit 2 tissue your wish was 40. when you were 42 you wish there was no cruising at 16. i only reached 60 oh god i wish i was when i was young but the point about it is this that as you grow older you have more to learn not less and that is what just be a very strenuous thing one of the things though is when people don't admit and acknowledge where they are at when they don't acknowledge their faults their fears their mistakes from another young sincerity and she said but although i know i have anger issues and i was so pleased with that i was pleased that she recognizes that she has hunger issues but if you don't say you know you have a big monster inside the day called anger but you're smiling and you're doing like it's not it's there it's only a matter of time to come out but when you know it's clear we could pray with you we could pray for you you could pray for yourself you understand the way a challenge is that and you can get delicious but it has to start with you being able to acknowledge where you're at and so you have to forgive the parents and you parents there's a next part of this whole equation here now tonight you have to forgive yourself this part is very very very important just as you forgiven your parents and mother i remember my fellow father never give me a long pants not you i can't explain that all right he's still bitter he found that dead and going in but to that individual it means something and you know what may be like to you is not like to somebody else and we have to appreciate that everyone has a story and that's why i call it a story parenting as a story a story of life and we have the opportunity to share things that you could learn i know this is not a night that we remember tips or advice or counsel in that sense but just an exposure of this thing called parent and whether or not you could forgive your own parents for their failures what you think they should have done could have done and your own failures know as parents where we feel and we recognize you know what we could have done better i'm willing to learn because you still have an opportunity for the future to influence those who god has put in your care because you know i used to think as a young person that the older ones really know about age and life and as i get older i recognize when i was young so let's put it this way when i was still 25 or 26 and i'm looking at somebody who is 64 which is the age i'm going to be this year not this year i think they know so much and i recognize now that i'm this age they were very clueless they were absolutely clueless of this process called agent and their stage in life when my brother exclaimed how on earth did he get so old you know like all of a sudden because he's in the 70s right now i almost felt like a revelation hey hey what is this he just lived [Laughter] he just lived eat live laugh and the gray here just set in this is life and um so i i um i'm about done you know i know you might not think so [Laughter] i would done but i'm hoping that um that something said in this would help you see this picture and the reason i'm saying that you have to forgive yourself is because sometimes you feel so guilty of your own feelings and shortcomings but did you have the tools did you know were you taught were you train and you hear me at times i do believe half and half make a hole in terms of two people are halves and when they come together husband and wife they become a whole i believe two whole make a whole there are some people who need to be healed they need to become whole i just say will you be who they come into a relationship in a marriage thinking their wife will complete them or the husband will complete or this will happen when i get married you have to become whole now holding your spirit in your mind no man could heal you no woman could heal you your path your fears you have to deal with your own life deal with your own sins your own fears and stop blaming because blaming just hinders you blaming will keep you back i have nobody to blame stop blaming you may not out how you manage your son you made it out you know you manage your daughter you mean also how you manage things get back to work i'll even keel where you want help now you want tools you want a fresh word you want a fresh area and think that if you have an opportunity to share your failures shortcomings your faults your stepping stones your your grounding and so on that you would have somebody get you in a position to help somebody so i'm going to wrap up so parents forgive yourself stop blaming yourself there was no school of parenting you tried and did the best that you know for your children so inclusion parenting is a process of really preparing your trial for independence not dependent okay so therefore one thing that i found was very interesting in dealing with the child and the child rebellion and the child's attitude is using when as opposed to if so letting the child know not if you do this then i will do this but putting it on the child when you're washing wears then you're gonna get this when you clean your room then not if but when and that brings it right and them to make a decision of their own action in response to you giving them discipline not if you do this you're gonna get this but when you're gonna do this so inclusive back to the scriptures fathers do not irritate and provoke your treatment to anger why would paul say that it means he is also saying that fathers can irritate can provoke can prove that the anger and resentment they could do that but read them tenderly in training and discipline and counsel and admission of the lord i have seen young girls with when i say young maybe six seven years ago going to school with dresses almost to the uncle and not even him not right and i see them and i know any message i don't know who children they are but i see the children and i tell myself that if that parent don't look closer what they are doing and how they are doing it they may eventually get that child to resent this very message because putting a long dress on a child doesn't make them a christian this christ is going to make him a christian and that christ has to start with you as the parent if today or tonight you have never considered your life being a direct influence over your children i want to challenge you that tonight for example if in listening to wednesday night service you in and out and you just no you're not serious about where you're taking in the world and your children are wrong they will see that and you may not take notice of it the effect that has on them but they could do the same also if you can get the service and you don't and you still on a sunday when you should be in service on a sunday then that you're not seeing your children how they view that how they see that many of us live our lives for ourselves and that is why the children loses out because we fighting for love fighting for recognition fighting for acknowledgement heightens your respect and we are dear in this world of life fighting and not recognizing in our hands have lies like a clean fleet to be written on lies like potty that can be molded shaped and guided if the 90 never saw yourself in that position of leadership by example i want you to see yourself like that way tonight not just as father but as a leader how do you lead in your home not talk not full rank but lead leading by example leading where you step forward to show how it is to be done let us bowl heads forward the press tonight heavenly father i thank you tonight this is full service kind and i was i felt a bit short of presenting this but lord i i asked for your help and i trust them that in all its brokenness that a picture will be painted to your people tonight of your love towards us and your care towards us when we were in sin you you died for us and you you expressed your love for us and you save us still and yet when our children in sin we have so much attitudes and and thinking and negatives and everything else and you're just testing us many a father times are many parents here tonight and maybe some that may be able to hear the thing they would be able to switch their own hearts they don't even know by silencing their children by covering up for their children and having a covenant with their children hiding sin hiding all kind of stuff because they don't want to get the wrong picture and they feel that they're in charge going to realize they are destroying lives god i'm concerned not just about them as parents but about the next generation how are they going to relate how are they going to communicate when mother or father silence the children when they don't have access to counsel and guidance when they wouldn't say a word and things are going struggling within their marriage and everything else and their ministries and their helps and their support and we could share and pull one another up but there's nothing a word everything is silent and covered up how could they get the help that they need father here it is that through this pandemic you have led us with zumbra meeting on a friday and now with special services and we could take special topics like we took parenting tonight just to bring us a story and there there are many stories we could have pulled out i just took one or two and i know that those who are hearing tonight would have their own story when they were angry with parents their own failures as parents i know the next generations are wrong the babies hanging around lord and they are wondering how they're going to do and how they're going to make them like sometimes i'll go farther talking about or the bible is like the older woman teach the young women how to love their husbands but if the older woman don't even know how could they teach a young woman we need help lord we need your help we need your intervention it's a little more than just i'm in church or i'm in a message you said i come that you may have life and have it more abundantly father may you charge these people here tonight for this abundant life not existence not survival help them tonight lord jesus was just a backdrop exhortation or talk lord to show them to share with them the stories of parents parents some succeed some has failed our lives are not defined by our own parents our lives are defined by our actions our words our decisions our attitude we are responsible we are accountable to you lord bless this meeting tonight bless those who listen patiently and i was dear listen to every word bless them father and give them a good rest tonight bless lord upcoming service on sunday their presence and power will be among the people and jesus jesus you might ask it amen god bless you saints and thank you so much for being here tonight i pray and trust that this was a blessing and help to you as i said to you this is not to cast on anybody there's nobody in mind i just wanted to share something to you and parenting a story god bless you and thank you again praise
