[12:39] service into the hands of the Lord that
[12:41] he would minister to our hearts. Lord,
[12:45] minister to our lives and the needs of
[12:46] the people this morning as we gather in
[12:48] his in his presence. Let's pray.
[12:50] Almighty God, we thank you to be here.
[12:52] Lord, it is your grace and mercy that
[12:55] has kept us alive that we should not go
[12:58] down into the pit.
[13:00] &gt;&gt; We are victorious this morning.
[13:03] &gt;&gt; Because we stand upon a rock and that
[13:06] rock is Jesus this morning. That rock
[13:08] has lasted throughout thousands of
[13:10] years. Men have walked the earth and
[13:12] find rest in the shelter of your wings.
[13:14] This morning we in our generation also,
[13:18] Father, have the same testimony. How
[13:20] you've kept us from a mighty long way,
[13:23] through wind and storm, through trial
[13:26] and temptation, through disappointment
[13:29] and heartache, through cuts and bruises,
[13:32] through nails and scars, through razors
[13:36] and wood and fire and tempest. You loved
[13:39] us anyhow and you brought us forth,
[13:41] Lord, Father, as a testimony against the
[13:44] enemy that our God reigns this morning
[13:47] and that you are able to do exceedingly
[13:49] abundantly above all we could ask or
[13:52] think according to the power that's
[13:55] working in us this morning. Lord, may
[13:57] you work in us this morning. Pour out
[13:59] your spirit upon your people, Lord. As
[14:00] we gather in your name, Lord, may you
[14:02] bless this service today. May you pour
[14:04] your spirit upon your people and anoint
[14:06] us. Minister to our hearts the needs
[14:09] Lord Father that we have. Lord, you know
[14:12] what we have need of. Lord, you the Holy
[14:15] Spirit, the great X-ray, Lord. May you
[14:17] examine us inside out, Father. And Lord,
[14:20] may you fix us, Lord Jesus. Fix what
[14:23] needs to be fixed, Lord. Minister to
[14:24] what needs to be ministered to, dear
[14:26] God. May you be glorified in this place.
[14:29] May the angels surround this place. May
[14:31] you blot out sin and transgression this
[14:34] morning. May you do battle for us this
[14:37] morning. We exalt you, Lord. Your sword
[14:39] and your shield is exalted in this
[14:42] place. We rebuke every power of the
[14:43] enemy. Rebuke the power of Satan. We
[14:46] rebuke the power of laziness,
[14:48] thoughtfulness. Lord, we want to press
[14:50] with all that is within us this morning
[14:53] to enter into the kingdom of God. Our
[14:56] father, may you reward our faith this
[14:57] morning with a glorious, wonderful
[15:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire,
[15:03] Lord, to each and every soul. That's our
[15:05] prayer today. May we leave today change
[15:07] and transform. We commit the service
[15:09] into your hands, the word of God into
[15:11] your hands, Lord, and the singing and
[15:12] the worship and everything.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's precious name, we pray
[15:17] and ask it. Amen and amen. You love the
[15:21] Lord today. Amen. Why don't you turn
[15:23] around and greet someone next to you?
[15:25] preach your brother.

[29:47] Before
[29:51] [Applause]
[29:52] you sit down, I'd like to
[29:55] ask that you please bring out your
[29:57] Bibles and let's read from two portions
[30:00] of scripture and then I have a context
[30:02] script scripture that I'm going to read
[30:04] afterwards.
[30:06] I'm reading from Romans 84 14-1 17 and
[30:10] Ephesians 4
[30:14] 11-15.
[30:41] Romans 8 14-17
[30:44] and then also St. Luke I mean Ephesians
[30:47] 4 11-15 and then I'll read also my
[30:52] context scripture um St. Luke's St. Luke
[30:55] 15 about the prodigal son.
[31:00] So um Romans chap 8 14-17 reads on these
[31:04] wise for as many as are led by the
[31:08] spirit of God they are the sons of God.
[31:12] For you have not received the spirit of
[31:14] bondage again to fear, but you have
[31:16] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[31:18] we cry, "Aba, Father."
[31:21] &gt;&gt; The spirit itself be witness with our
[31:23] spirit that we are the children of God.
[31:26] And if children, then hes of God, then
[31:29] hes of God and join hes with Christ. If
[31:32] so be that we suffer with him that we
[31:35] may be also glorified together.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Ephesians 4 11-15.
[31:42] And he gives some apostles and some
[31:45] prophets and some evangelists and some
[31:48] pastors and teachers
[31:51] for the perfecting of the saints, for
[31:53] the work of the ministry, for the
[31:55] edifying of the body of Christ, till we
[31:59] all come in the unity of the faith
[32:04] and of the knowledge of the Son of God,
[32:07] unto a perfect man, unto the measure of
[32:10] the stature of the fullness of Christ,
[32:12] that we henceforth be no more children
[32:14] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[32:16] every wind of doctrine by the slight of
[32:19] men and conning craftiness whereby the
[32:21] lion wait to deceive but speaking the
[32:24] truth in love may grow up into him in
[32:26] all things which is the head even Christ
[32:28] amen may the Lord add his blessings to
[32:31] the rhythm of his holy words let's bow
[32:33] our heads for a prayer please our
[32:35] heavenly father
[32:38] we thank you for grace to be back in
[32:39] your presence one more time this
[32:41] Morning. Thank you for the blessings of
[32:43] the past few days
[32:46] where you have given us more than we
[32:50] could have even asked for. And if you
[32:52] had to go home already, even last night,
[32:54] Lord, it was more than worth it already.
[32:58] But Lord, we are here one more day,
[33:00] Lord. And like Jesus cried out on the
[33:02] last day of the feast,
[33:05] I pray that your Holy Spirit will
[33:07] minister and pour out upon each one of
[33:09] us today on this great last day of this
[33:13] feast where we have come together to
[33:16] rejoice in your word in the promises
[33:19] that are ours from your word. I pray
[33:22] Lord that you'll help me this morning. I
[33:24] pray you'll help uh your people Lord.
[33:26] Lord, I pray you'll strengthen their
[33:28] child bodies. And I pray, Lord, that
[33:30] you'll help me, Lord, to speak only what
[33:33] want me to speak and shut my mind from
[33:35] what you don't want me to say.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; I pray, Lord, that the man of Christ
[33:39] will speak to your people this morning.
[33:42] May the person of Christ himself
[33:44] minister your word to your people
[33:46] because you know the needs that be in
[33:47] every heart and life. And Lord, may your
[33:49] Holy Spirit go forth with power and
[33:52] demonstration of the Holy Spirit. And at
[33:54] the end of this service and this day and
[33:57] this convention, we will be careful,
[34:00] very careful to give you alone all the
[34:01] praise, honor and glory for we ask you
[34:04] with thanksgiving in Jesus name.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. May be seated
[34:08] please.
[34:12] Good morning and God bless you.
[34:19] All right. I don't need to ask you
[34:20] whether you are happy. It's obvious in
[34:22] the services and especially
[34:27] after last night's um service. Um I
[34:31] don't need to ask you whether you're
[34:32] happy. I know you are happy and we thank
[34:34] the Lord for
[34:36] &gt;&gt; his goodness. So I just pray that God
[34:39] will help me and I'll be able to say
[34:41] something that will be a blessing to
[34:43] you.
[34:45] Um
[34:48] I get to speak many times on Sunday
[34:50] morning and the service already done and
[34:53] everything has been spoken. So I pray
[34:56] that you will be able to find some
[35:00] crumbs from what I'm going to say
[35:03] because the message has already gone
[35:05] forth and there's nothing more I can
[35:07] add.
[35:09] But I want to start by thanking brother
[35:11] Isaac and sister Grace for JB for the
[35:13] invitation to be here again and um
[35:17] brother Isaac said this is the 28th year
[35:20] of the convention and um I think my
[35:23] first one was 2000 and um brother Isaac
[35:27] I don't need to say anything more about
[35:28] him but I want to say here publicly um
[35:31] because everybody knows the situation
[35:33] that happened with our brothers recently
[35:35] and um many people may not know it but
[35:39] This was the hero of the whole whole
[35:42] thing. Brother Isaac was in the
[35:44] background instrumental
[35:46] to make sure our brothers came out. So
[35:50] on behalf of those of us from Lagos,
[35:52] will you please all stand up and let me
[35:54] thank brother Isaac for the tremendous
[35:56] help he gave us, for being such a hero,
[35:59] for being such a loving brother, for
[36:01] being such a good brother. Thank you,
[36:02] brother Isaac. Thank you, brother Isaac.
[36:05] We love you and I appreciate you so
[36:07] much.
[36:09] [Applause]
[36:11] Thank you.
[36:14] And I think I should just add right away
[36:16] too for all of you that are here and
[36:19] even those who are not here all of
[36:20] Nigeria and all over the world for the
[36:23] great show of love, concern, care that
[36:27] we felt, the prayers especially the
[36:30] contributions in cash and kind we can't
[36:33] thank you enough. I just want to say
[36:35] because the English language is so poor
[36:38] in finding adequate words but the best
[36:41] we can say is thank you. Thank you feels
[36:44] so light, so weightless, so inadequate.
[36:49] But because there are no better words in
[36:50] English language, I just want to say on
[36:52] behalf of those of us from Lagos and our
[36:54] church in Lagos, I want to say thank
[36:56] you. Thank you for your love, your
[36:57] prayers, your care, your contributions.
[37:00] We are very very grateful.
[37:03] Amen.
[37:04] the brothers are doing fine and they are
[37:06] getting reintegrated back into into um
[37:11] their regular schedule. I don't want to
[37:13] spend all the time about that because
[37:15] the devil is not in the picture. So I
[37:17] don't want to spend time. So So I just
[37:19] wanted to be sure to thank you all.
[37:22] Amen.
[37:24] So brother Isaac, thank you for the
[37:26] convention one more time in the 28th
[37:28] year and to the Hson tabernacle, brother
[37:29] Salem, the ministry and the different
[37:32] helps and governments in the church.
[37:33] want to thank you for inviting us to be
[37:35] here again and always making us feel so
[37:38] welcome. I always feel very guilty when
[37:41] I
[37:43] come here and I see the sisters the
[37:45] cooking and things. obviously very
[37:47] guilty that on account of you they are
[37:50] missing the services they are doing so
[37:52] much but I want to say thank you to the
[37:54] sisters who took care of us and
[37:58] make sure they are within miss home
[38:03] I can tell you I don't eat as much in my
[38:05] home I can tell you that but Isaac and
[38:08] the the brothers the sisters thank you
[38:10] so very much for everything you've done
[38:13] for us and for the pastors ministers
[38:15] church in attendance to leave your
[38:17] groups, your churches and come here.
[38:19] Thank you. Like brother Muka said and
[38:21] every so obvious if you've been here for
[38:23] anytime at all. This is so huge. This
[38:27] convention is so large and and and I'm
[38:30] sure you have not been disappointed
[38:32] because God has been here to bless us
[38:35] over above and beyond. So thank you to
[38:38] my pastor brothers who were all
[38:41] introduced this morning, the ministers
[38:42] and the church in attendance. Thank you
[38:44] so very much. And even the pastors who
[38:46] are not here who send their people want
[38:48] to say thank you because without the
[38:50] people there's no convention. Amen.
[38:53] And of course I want to thank my
[38:56] brothers the future speakers before me
[38:58] brother Isaac himself and brother oid on
[39:02] uh Friday night. Brother Kamera
[39:04] yesterday morning and brother um Kos Maz
[39:08] Maduk and brother Ibrahome yesterday
[39:10] afternoon. brother over again last night
[39:12] and I
[39:14] it's my honor and my privilege to be on
[39:16] the field with you brothers and I thank
[39:17] you so much. I love you. I appreciate
[39:21] you and I I've been so blessed. I've
[39:23] been so blessed and really because I I
[39:26] avoid going to convention sometime
[39:27] because I don't want to be on the
[39:29] pulpit.
[39:31] I don't want to preach. I just want to
[39:33] sit down and be blessed. And I've been
[39:34] blessed. I've had more than my portion
[39:36] in this convention.
[39:39] But I'd like to send out a word of
[39:41] caution
[39:43] because you know and
[39:47] thank you.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you.
[39:52] All right.
[39:58] Now, don't be nervous seeing me. Okay?
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Just relax and uh we'll enjoy the
[40:04] service together. Um I have it I have a
[40:08] repetition for preaching long and whiny
[40:10] but uh um brother Theo is here. Brother
[40:13] Theo last night he spoke 44 minutes. I
[40:16] couldn't do that in 3 hours.
[40:19] So I will try to
[40:22] um get to my point really quick.
[40:29] So I said I want to send out a word of
[40:31] caution because you know
[40:34] is the age of brotherly love, brotherly
[40:37] kindness and
[40:40] the honey sticking and brother Brandham
[40:43] taught us that and we all know that
[40:45] because that's the message and what I
[40:48] have found out my experience I don't
[40:49] know what your experience is because I'm
[40:51] speaking so I'm telling you my
[40:52] experience is that when we talk about
[40:55] love We all seem to take it very
[40:58] lightly.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; You know what the reason why? Because
[41:01] love is an emotion that every human
[41:04] being feels.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; Even if I don't love you, you don't love
[41:09] me.
[41:11] In all likelihood, you will love your
[41:13] dad and mom.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; Even if you are not married,
[41:17] because love, you love somebody, you
[41:19] love something. So when we are being
[41:21] spoken to about love is like something
[41:23] we know already. And that's the danger.
[41:26] Because human beings, human nature that
[41:28] we have, when something is spoken about
[41:31] that appears common to you, we tend to
[41:34] overlook it.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; And that's why I see I want to send out
[41:38] a note of caution this morning.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. so that we would we we've had a
[41:45] great time,
[41:47] &gt;&gt; great outstanding time, but I
[41:51] wonder that we are not just jumping for
[41:54] joy and not sitting down to way what is
[41:58] being spoken about.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Whether I'm a pastor, I'm a minister,
[42:03] I'm a deacon, I'm a brother, I'm a
[42:05] sister.
[42:06] If if brother oid or brother Ka or
[42:10] brother Gome or brother Isaac or brother
[42:12] Cosmos whoever is talking about drop
[42:15] your arts am I really taking that from
[42:19] me and I know I ought to go through my
[42:21] life and drop every art that I have.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; If I'm not doing that then my coming
[42:27] here has been
[42:29] &gt;&gt; in vain. I've just come for a jump for
[42:31] joy. But for a that's Pentecostal, but
[42:35] for a life the the the bride is a life
[42:38] when the word comes a life that will
[42:40] clean up. That's the bride.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; And that's what Pentecost cannot match
[42:45] up to.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; I just hope that we are not going to be
[42:49] in that category. And I know we're not
[42:51] going to be. I just wanted to send a
[42:52] word of caution.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[43:02] Two weeks ago, I think it was, we had a
[43:05] Thanksgiving service in our church in
[43:06] Lagos. And I actually told our church
[43:08] that
[43:10] um
[43:11] the heroes of the recent event that we
[43:13] had happen at church was brother Isaac
[43:16] here and the brothers with him and
[43:18] brother uch and you know brother Noel
[43:22] his head deacon in on who I mean they
[43:27] went over above and beyond the call of
[43:28] duty to be a blessing to us. I uh wanted
[43:33] to acknowledge brother Ouch. Also is
[43:36] like a son to me. Uh even though he's
[43:38] taller than me, he's bigger than me, but
[43:40] that's where you want your children to
[43:41] be to be bigger than you.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; All right, brother. Thank you so much. I
[43:45] mean, brother, I don't know if Noel is
[43:47] here, but but thank is here. medicine. I
[43:50] mean these brothers, that's what it is.
[43:53] That's what it is. Like brother Bernham
[43:54] said, the horny sticks when something
[43:56] happens, you know, you you don't you
[43:58] don't have the you just go all out and
[44:01] at the risk of your own life. And that's
[44:03] what the brothers did for one say thank
[44:05] you so very much. Amen.
[44:09] [Applause]
[44:12] Amen.
[44:16] Before
[44:20] I get started speaking, I'd like to read
[44:23] my corner scripture. It's long, but I'll
[44:25] try to read it. And um but my title this
[44:29] morning is the home that love built. The
[44:34] home that love built.
[44:36] And my inspiration is the spirit of
[44:38] adoption whereby we cry aba father.
[44:43] And my subject, if I can call it that,
[44:45] is the prodigal son and the prodigal
[44:49] older brother.
[44:57] All right.
[45:00] So, um, St. Luke 15, just read so that
[45:02] we'll get a cont because I'll get to it
[45:05] later. Um, St. Luke chapter 15, you know
[45:07] the story. It's been spoken about so
[45:09] many times during the convention here.
[45:11] Uh but I just want to run through it and
[45:13] read it about the prodigal son. So the
[45:15] story remains fresh in your mind when I
[45:17] get to it. Um St. Luke 15 11-32
[45:22] verse 11. It reads on these wise and it
[45:24] said a certain man had two sons. Now
[45:26] this scripture here is coming right
[45:28] after the scripture. Come and rejoice
[45:30] with us. I mean come and rejoice with
[45:31] me. I found the lost coin that I lost.
[45:34] So this is all tied together to
[45:38] adoption time where the woman the bride
[45:42] the bride woman swept the floors and put
[45:45] down the cobwebs and found the lost coin
[45:47] that she was looking for.
[45:51] Verse 12. And the younger of them said
[45:53] to his father, "Father, give me the
[45:56] portion of goods that fallen to me." And
[45:58] he divided unto them his living. And not
[46:01] many days after the young son gathered
[46:03] all together and took his join into a
[46:05] far country and there wasted his
[46:07] substance with rioters leaving. And when
[46:10] he had spent all, there arose a mighty
[46:12] famine in that land. And he began to be
[46:14] in want.
[46:17] And he went and joined himself to a
[46:19] citizen of that country. And he sent him
[46:22] into his fields to feed swine.
[46:25] And he would fill his belly with the
[46:27] husks that the swine did eat. and no man
[46:30] gave unto him. And when he came to
[46:33] himself, he said, "How many high
[46:35] servants of my fathers have bread enough
[46:37] and to spare, and I perish here with
[46:39] hunger? I will arise and go to my
[46:42] father, and will see unto him, Father, I
[46:45] have sinned against heaven and before
[46:47] thee, and I am no more worthy to be
[46:49] called thy son. Make me as one of thy
[46:51] hired servants." And he arose and came
[46:54] to his father. But when he was yet a
[46:57] great way off, his father saw him and
[46:59] had compassion and ran and fell on his
[47:02] neck and kissed him. And his son said
[47:04] unto him, "Father, I have sinned against
[47:07] heaven and in thy sight, and I'm no more
[47:09] worthy to be called thy son." But the
[47:11] father said unto said to his servants,
[47:13] "Bring forth the best robe, and put it
[47:16] on him, and put a ring in his on his
[47:18] hand, and shoes on his feet, and bring
[47:20] he the fatted calf, and kill it, and let
[47:23] us eat and be married. For this my son
[47:25] was dead and is alive again. He was lost
[47:27] and is found. And they began to be
[47:29] married. Now his elder son was in the
[47:32] field. And as he came and drew night to
[47:35] the house, he heard music and dancing.
[47:38] And he called one of his s one of the
[47:40] servants and asked what these things
[47:42] meant. And he said unto him, "Thy
[47:44] brother is come and thy father had
[47:46] killed the father cal because he had
[47:48] received him safe and sound." And he was
[47:51] angry and would not go in. Therefore
[47:53] came his father out and intreated him.
[47:56] And he answered and he answering said to
[47:59] his father, "Lo, these many years do I
[48:01] serve thee, neither transgress I at any
[48:04] time thy commandment. And yet thou has
[48:07] thou never gavest me a kid, that I might
[48:10] make merry with my friends." That's like
[48:12] a goat. That I might make Mary with my
[48:14] friends. But as soon as this thy son was
[48:17] come, which had devoured thy living with
[48:20] harlots, thou hast killed for him the
[48:22] fed cal. And he said unto him, son, thou
[48:25] art ever with me, and all that I have is
[48:28] thine.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; It was meat that we should make Mary,
[48:31] and be glad, for this thy brother was
[48:33] dead, and is alive again, and was lost,
[48:36] but now is found.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord add his presence to
[48:40] the reading of his holy words.
[48:43] The home that love built. Inspiration,
[48:47] the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry,
[48:49] "Aba, father." And my subject is the
[48:52] prodigal son and the prodigal older
[48:55] brother.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; All right. And I'm just going to talk to
[49:06] you because the ministers that preach
[49:08] the word I just want to talk to you and
[49:10] um and you know me we are not serious to
[49:14] one another.
[49:16] Um so just bear with me. Okay. All
[49:19] right.
[49:21] May the 7th, 1946,
[49:26] um,
[49:28] an angel came to brother Vanham in his
[49:31] cave at Greens Mill in Indiana in the
[49:34] United States. We all know the story,
[49:37] but the backdrop was that what had
[49:39] happened was brother Bam was having some
[49:41] supernatural manifestations in his life
[49:43] that he couldn't understand, visions and
[49:45] this and that. He couldn't understand
[49:47] it. And it was a gaming warden in the
[49:50] state of Indiana. So that day when he
[49:51] was coming back home and that home he
[49:53] was in at the time was the home just
[49:56] across the tabernacle. I mean for those
[49:58] of you who have been in Jeff you know
[49:59] that home and when he was passing by
[50:01] there was a tap um which he calls in his
[50:04] testimony a spigot like a water tap on
[50:07] the right side there. And when he was
[50:09] there the wind blew and I think he said
[50:11] throw him down. And he said no this is
[50:13] getting too much. I've got to find out
[50:15] what's going on with me.
[50:18] So he told his wife and there's a cave
[50:22] in Greensme where he will go to to seek
[50:24] the face of the Lord. So and he said
[50:26] he's going to go there and he's not
[50:27] going to come back until he gets an
[50:29] answer from God what all these things
[50:31] that's been going on in his life what
[50:32] they really mean. So he went and started
[50:35] praying
[50:37] and that night May the 7th 1946 around
[50:40] about 11:00 in the night he said
[50:45] a light shone in the room and he saw
[50:48] like somebody entered the room and he
[50:51] looked and from the legs up he saw a
[50:53] human being like somebody in the form of
[50:55] a human being and he looked up and saw a
[50:59] man like 200 lb with long hair and
[51:05] because he was naturally afraid you
[51:07] would be afraid and the green's meal
[51:09] even now he's in the bush so you can
[51:11] imagine at that time he was afraid and
[51:14] the voice the angel this man told him
[51:18] fear not
[51:20] &gt;&gt; I've been sent from the presence of God
[51:22] to tell you explain to you the mysteries
[51:26] about your mysterious life
[51:28] &gt;&gt; and he said when I once I heard that
[51:31] voice I knew it was the same voice that
[51:34] had always spoken to me.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; So that angel spoke to him that night
[51:40] and told him about his life. Now
[51:44] remember
[51:46] 1933
[51:48] June 11 while baptizing the 17th person
[51:52] the voice had come from the skies as
[51:54] John the Baptist was sent to for the
[51:57] first coming of the Lord. So you are
[51:59] being sent with a message to forun the
[52:01] second coming of the Lord. A message. A
[52:03] message
[52:04] &gt;&gt; that will herald the coming of the Lord.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; So he already had that. But then there
[52:10] were so many things he didn't understand
[52:12] still. And so this angel sat with him
[52:15] that night and they talked back and
[52:16] forth and told him things. One important
[52:18] thing, brother Vanam said, everything
[52:20] that angel told him, he went back home
[52:24] to check in the scriptures to make sure
[52:26] that those things were. So
[52:29] &gt;&gt; because he was an angel did not mean
[52:33] &gt;&gt; it was okay.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Because even Satan can appear as an
[52:38] angel of light.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; But where you'd always catch him was
[52:41] that he cannot stay on the world. He
[52:43] will always deviate from the world.
[52:45] That's the example from our prophet.
[52:48] Back to the word. Back to the Bible. Not
[52:50] it sounds good, it sounds nice. It's got
[52:52] to be the word.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Give me the word.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Give me the word. Amen.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; So the angel told him, "You are being
[53:17] sent to the world." Now before this
[53:19] time, the world did not know William
[53:21] Brandham. The people in his church, the
[53:23] tabernacle knew him and all that. So
[53:24] they didn't know who he was, his
[53:26] lifestyle, none of that.
[53:29] So the William Brandon, we got to know
[53:31] his life, his ministry, his humility.
[53:34] The world didn't know that at all.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; We don't even know what his life was in
[53:39] in the real sense before that time. I
[53:41] mean, not we didn't know how he was
[53:43] because we don't have that record.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; But after this time,
[53:51] &gt;&gt; he was introduced to the world. Amen.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; But before he went to the world, he had
[53:57] some conversation with that angel.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; And the angel told him together with
[54:03] your message, you are going to be given
[54:07] because he said, "I'm not educated. All
[54:09] the excuses like Moses and all that. I'm
[54:11] not educated. They're not going to
[54:12] listen to me." And things like that.
[54:14] Then you said, "You're going to be given
[54:16] two signs."
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Like Moses was given two signs. You're
[54:21] going to be given two signs.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; One, first one, you'll take them in by
[54:25] the hand and you'll be able to know
[54:28] what's wrong with them just by taking
[54:31] them in because you get some vibrations
[54:33] and some color change in your hand. You
[54:35] will know what it was. And for those who
[54:37] were there and saw brother Bam do that,
[54:40] they would tell you TB was a scalllet
[54:42] red on this side of his hand, you will
[54:45] see even from a distance. Some people
[54:46] have seen it so many times when they
[54:48] will see the color change. they will
[54:50] know what disease it was even before
[54:51] brother B would call it.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Cancer was a bright angry red and
[54:58] different things like that. And then
[55:00] second time, I mean second sign, it will
[55:03] get to a point where you'll be able to
[55:05] discern the very thoughts of the
[55:07] people's hearts.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; You're going to be given this to go to
[55:11] the world.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; With your message.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; And here's where I'm getting to.
[55:21] a daunting task. Now, don't be fooled by
[55:24] all the great miracles and things you
[55:27] see now. No, it wasn't like that at the
[55:29] time.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; The there were those on the field, the
[55:32] Smith Wiggleswarts and the the uh uh um
[55:35] uh um FF Bosworth and all that and
[55:38] things like that. But 1945, most of
[55:41] those old warriors died out.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; That's right. So for a man who had only
[55:47] a seventh grade education
[55:49] &gt;&gt; to go and face the whole world, it was a
[55:52] daunting task.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham knew his greatest
[55:57] challenge was going to come from the
[55:59] church.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; He said to the angel, "The ministers
[56:03] will not believe me."
[56:08] &gt;&gt; And the angel told me told him, "No, it
[56:11] is not for the ministers. It is for the
[56:15] people
[56:16] [Applause]
[56:22] &gt;&gt; and told him I want to assure you I will
[56:25] always be with you.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; It's not for the ministers.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; It's for the people.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; And brother Bam says once I heard that
[56:35] and that you were always with me, I was
[56:37] ready to go. And he said down through
[56:40] his ministry that not one time did he
[56:43] ever fail me. And that's why brother
[56:45] Brown will always wait and said that
[56:48] he's here now because he had a promise.
[56:50] I will always be with you.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:54] [Applause]
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; It's not for the ministers. It's for the
[57:06] people. And the angel father told him in
[57:10] taking this to the people I want to tell
[57:13] you this that your gift this great gift
[57:17] I'm telling you about I've been sent
[57:19] from heaven to tell you about is not
[57:21] going to be effective unless you do this
[57:25] one thing
[57:27] &gt;&gt; two things really but combine them into
[57:29] one
[57:31] &gt;&gt; and one he was to do
[57:34] he said when you go to the people,
[57:38] &gt;&gt; there's a way you've got to relate to
[57:41] them so you can really reach them
[57:45] &gt;&gt; or in spite of your great gift, you are
[57:47] not going to be able to reach them.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; He said the condition is when you go to
[57:53] the people if if if if
[57:57] &gt;&gt; you can get the people
[58:01] &gt;&gt; to believe you.
[58:03] [Music]
[58:07] Then nothing
[58:10] &gt;&gt; will stand before you
[58:12] &gt;&gt; when you pray. Nothing, everything going
[58:14] to melt away when you pray. If you can
[58:16] only do that,
[58:19] &gt;&gt; not even cancer.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Cancer was the great scorch at the time.
[58:23] It still is.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Not even cancer.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[58:42] In other words,
[58:45] no man,
[58:47] no spirit,
[58:50] nothing in creation
[58:52] &gt;&gt; will be able to stand before you
[58:54] &gt;&gt; if you can only
[58:57] live in such a way the people will find
[58:59] it easy to believe you. Now, you know,
[59:03] brother Benham never I I don't I haven't
[59:04] found the place where he explained
[59:08] what it meant or how he went about
[59:11] getting the people to believe him.
[59:13] Sometimes you'll hear him on the prayer
[59:15] prayer line say like that, do you
[59:17] believe me to be his prophet? Do you
[59:18] believe me to be his servant? But it
[59:20] runs deeper than that. Runs deeper than
[59:22] that. And that's my testimony and that's
[59:25] what I'm trying to speak about this
[59:26] morning. Because before this time, we
[59:28] the world did not know William Brham. It
[59:31] was after this time and I believe that
[59:34] encounter with the angel the things the
[59:37] angel told him
[59:39] he mixed it with his life
[59:41] &gt;&gt; and he came out and began to live in
[59:44] such a way it was easy for the people to
[59:48] believe him
[59:49] &gt;&gt; you know
[59:51] in recent times there's been a lot of
[59:53] talk about brother Brandham was lying
[59:55] about this lying about that and all that
[59:57] stuff I wish those guys all the best but
[59:59] one young person told me one time he
[1:00:01] said I cannot understand what they're
[1:00:03] talking about brother Brandham. This is
[1:00:05] a young man struggling struggling
[1:00:07] struggling struggling with his Christian
[1:00:08] life. He said because if you ever read
[1:00:10] brother Brandham or listen him one time
[1:00:12] you will know that man did not have the
[1:00:14] capacity to deceive anybody.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; It was just not in him
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; to do it at all.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Even that young man with a struggle
[1:00:24] found it easy
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; to believe William Brandham.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; What a commission that was.
[1:00:39] Now, let's examine this commission a
[1:00:41] little closeup. Uh because like I keep
[1:00:44] saying, this was before William Brennan
[1:00:46] was revealed to the world. And I
[1:00:48] personally believe
[1:00:51] that
[1:00:53] this commission from the angel how to
[1:00:56] interact with the people played a huge
[1:00:59] part in the person that we came to know
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; as William Brham.
[1:01:07] So let's see how that encounter shaped
[1:01:09] his life and what lessons we can learn
[1:01:13] from that encounter
[1:01:16] because that single admonition if you
[1:01:19] can get the people to believe you
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; it I believe it would turn it turn out
[1:01:25] to be quite pregnant with meaning one
[1:01:29] line one sentence but it was loaded with
[1:01:33] meaning
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; and you and I don't know what the angel
[1:01:36] told brother Bham and brother Bham the
[1:01:38] angel told him don't tell them don't say
[1:01:39] this don't say that he had the
[1:01:40] discipline to not say he just told us
[1:01:43] this but this is my own understanding of
[1:01:46] it was more than just asking the people
[1:01:48] do do you believe me to be his prophet
[1:01:50] do you believe me to be his prophet it
[1:01:51] was deeper than that
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; amenal
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; it would turn out
[1:02:01] that within those words if you can get
[1:02:03] the people to believe you.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; It would turn out that within those
[1:02:07] words was veiled
[1:02:10] what I believe to be the secret
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; and the process that gave William Brham
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; the Christlike life,
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; the Christlike ministry
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; and the Christlike descent to a full
[1:02:25] interaction with every human being.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:34] a Christlike life and ministry that so
[1:02:37] displayed
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; the love of God
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; in his every interaction
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; in his personal life and in interacting
[1:02:47] with the people even in interacting with
[1:02:49] animals
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; the love of God
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; decency
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; like brother Oie read the quote tell the
[1:02:55] animal oh I'm so sorry I barge into your
[1:02:59] place he said he wanted to reach for his
[1:03:01] gun holy spirit said no and said I'm So
[1:03:03] I mean to reach for his god but his gun
[1:03:05] wasn't even there
[1:03:07] and God let that happen on purpose. The
[1:03:09] prophet teaching us
[1:03:12] apologizing to an animal with no soul.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; But that was such the life he had
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; a life of love.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:25] Glory
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; in those words if you can get the people
[1:03:33] to believe you was hidden the tutoring
[1:03:37] by the Holy Spirit. In those words was
[1:03:40] hidden the mentoring by the Holy Spirit.
[1:03:43] Amen.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; And by these processes,
[1:03:47] brother Brandham was able to achieve the
[1:03:50] life and ministry
[1:03:52] that he had that set him so far apart
[1:03:55] from his contemporaries, from all other
[1:03:57] ministers, till there was never a
[1:03:59] ministry like his since the time of the
[1:04:02] apostles,
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; till his ministry revealed and
[1:04:06] identified the shout in the coming of
[1:04:10] the Lord.
[1:04:18] So in those words the angel told him
[1:04:22] it wasn't just about so when you get in
[1:04:24] the prayer line ask them do you believe
[1:04:26] me to be prophet it was deeper than that
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; in those words was really the secret and
[1:04:33] the process
[1:04:35] that gave William Branham that
[1:04:38] Christlike life the Christlike ministry
[1:04:41] and the Christlike interactions
[1:04:44] in his interaction with the people
[1:04:46] because he was sent to the people, not
[1:04:48] to the ministers, to the people.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; And if the ministers want to receive it,
[1:04:52] they had better become part of the
[1:04:53] people.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:59] [Music]
[1:04:59] [Applause]
[1:05:04] And like Peter and John of old, they
[1:05:07] went about and the people took notice
[1:05:10] and knowledge that they had been with
[1:05:12] Jesus. Same way William Bham went about
[1:05:15] and they took notice that he had been
[1:05:18] with Jesus. They took notice that never
[1:05:20] a man spoke like this man. Never a man
[1:05:23] did the things on this earth that this
[1:05:25] man is doing since the days of the
[1:05:27] apostles. And they took notice that
[1:05:29] Jesus Christ was very in Bam.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; And the people gladly believed him
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; just like the angel said.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; And you and I saw the result. Not even
[1:05:42] cancer
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; go stand before him.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Not even wild animals go stand before
[1:05:50] him.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; No critic, nothing, not even nature go
[1:05:55] stand before him. Hallelujah.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; If you can only get the people If
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; you can only get the people
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; to believe you.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Say hallelujah.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:11] [Applause]
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; So, William Bannon found the life, the
[1:06:17] secret, the process that given the life
[1:06:22] that was easy for the people to believe
[1:06:23] him. And because of that,
[1:06:28] what the angel told him that May evening
[1:06:31] of 1947
[1:06:33] came to pass.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; I mean 1946.
[1:06:40] This admonition by the angel to get the
[1:06:43] people to believe.
[1:06:45] So encapsulated brother Bam's life and
[1:06:47] ministry.
[1:06:49] The people. The people. Brother Kame, I
[1:06:52] read the quote yesterday about the voice
[1:06:54] of healing and brother God lining say
[1:06:56] fine gentlemen but you know the the
[1:06:58] story and all that and said brother B
[1:07:00] why did you do that he said I'm not
[1:07:02] after the s he's after I'm after the
[1:07:05] people
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; that's all he never forgot his
[1:07:07] commission it's about the people it's
[1:07:09] not about you it's about the people
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; that's the gospel hallelujah
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Amen
[1:07:20] So
[1:07:23] in my opinion,
[1:07:25] I'll say it again, that admonition from
[1:07:27] the angel was way deeper than the act of
[1:07:30] asking the people on the prayer line, do
[1:07:33] you believe me to be God's prophet?
[1:07:35] Friends, it was way deeper than that.
[1:07:38] Because I can assure you that if that
[1:07:41] prophet had had a questionable
[1:07:45] personal life
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; or a questionable relationship with the
[1:07:49] people that he ministered to,
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; if he was in quarrel with everybody in
[1:07:54] this church,
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; if Brother Brham had had a less than
[1:07:59] honorable reputation among the people,
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; if he had a life full of anything but
[1:08:08] the pure spirit of God showing forth the
[1:08:12] love of God in his life.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; If he not reflect
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; and represent Jesus Christ well to the
[1:08:20] people,
[1:08:24] no matter how gifted he was,
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; his ministry would not have been
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; that effective. It would not have had
[1:08:32] the effect that it had
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; to those people. And definitely
[1:08:36] definitely the incredible success he had
[1:08:39] he would never have had it even though
[1:08:40] he had the gift
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; but it takes the people bam said I'm not
[1:08:44] the one operating the gift is you
[1:08:45] operating the gift
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; the people would never
[1:08:50] have believed this shy of a minister I
[1:08:53] know he's gifted so what
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; so it's not about the gift
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; it's not about the preaching
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; it's not about you know it's not no
[1:09:03] about none of that
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; it's deeper than that.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. I'm just talking to
[1:09:16] you and I'll try to run.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Now, let's examine. Let's dig deeper
[1:09:26] still. This coming to brother Brandham.
[1:09:29] If you can get the people to believe
[1:09:31] you,
[1:09:34] nothing,
[1:09:36] not even cancer, will be able to stand
[1:09:38] before you.
[1:09:41] Our believer would have asked the angel,
[1:09:44] "How do I get the people to believe me?"
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Is a question I've always asked myself
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; and I wasn't satisfied that the answer
[1:09:54] laid in only.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Do you believe me to be God's prophet? I
[1:09:59] never it never registered with me that
[1:10:02] was where the answer was.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Don't ask me for a quote because I don't
[1:10:07] have a quote. But I believe brother Bam
[1:10:10] said he spoke to the angel a lot of
[1:10:11] things asked him a lot of questions and
[1:10:13] the angels took him to the scriptures
[1:10:15] and explained things to him about his
[1:10:17] ministry and about things. Brother Bam
[1:10:19] would have asked him how do I get the
[1:10:21] people
[1:10:23] to believe me? Because we think once I'm
[1:10:27] pastor the people automatically must
[1:10:29] believe what I'm telling them. No, it
[1:10:30] doesn't work like that.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; I said no, it does not work like that.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; No, it doesn't. No. Let me say it again.
[1:10:40] It doesn't work
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; like that.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Well, let me make it very plain and easy
[1:10:45] for you. You are dad and mom, right?
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; How many things you tell your children?
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; That doesn't take what you are saying to
[1:10:51] them. Even though you'll be dad and mom,
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; even with your children, you get to live
[1:10:55] and handle them in a way they would
[1:10:57] easily do what you tell them to do.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; They would easily believe you
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; that in their best interest what you are
[1:11:05] telling them. But many of us don't live
[1:11:07] that way. We just feel authority. I'm
[1:11:09] head of the home. I'm head of the
[1:11:10] church. You do what I say or you get out
[1:11:12] of here. It doesn't work that way.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:11:17] [Applause]
[1:11:33] Amen.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; So this
[1:11:38] admonition from the angel, you may be
[1:11:40] seated to brother Bannam.
[1:11:43] One sentence but has two house. Two
[1:11:45] house in it. Two house.
[1:11:49] Two halves to that admonition. First
[1:11:51] half, if you can get the people to
[1:11:53] believe you. Second half, nothing
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; will stand before you.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; And these two house are definitely
[1:12:00] intertwined.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; In other words, you must have one before
[1:12:03] you have the other.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Remember in the Bible when they said
[1:12:09] Lord, which is the great commandment in
[1:12:11] the law?
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; They asked for one commandment. Jesus
[1:12:14] said these are the two great
[1:12:17] commandments. He broke those two great
[1:12:20] commandments to two. Thou shall love the
[1:12:22] Lord thy God with all thy heart, with
[1:12:23] all thy soul, with all mind, with all
[1:12:24] thy strength. And a conjunction meaning
[1:12:28] something had happened and taken place
[1:12:29] before. And the second is like unto it.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
[1:12:38] On these two commandments hang all the
[1:12:43] law and the prophets. Jesus tied the
[1:12:46] whole of the Old Testament, the ten
[1:12:48] commandments. Moses on Mount Si crossing
[1:12:51] the Red Sea, he tied it all up
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; into these two commandments.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Same way. Same way. Same way.
[1:13:09] on these two things through these two
[1:13:11] instructions
[1:13:13] h
[1:13:14] the way I understand it
[1:13:17] the whole secret of William Bham's
[1:13:20] success in his personal life and in his
[1:13:23] ministry and his interactions with
[1:13:25] people till even his enemies said
[1:13:28] brother Brandham he was a very ethical
[1:13:30] person
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; I don't agree with his doctrine but he
[1:13:32] was a very ethical person
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; I heard that from his worst critics
[1:13:45] So just like the two great commandments
[1:13:48] where the second one you can't just love
[1:13:50] your neighbor and not love God,
[1:13:53] you have the ability to love your
[1:13:54] neighbor at all because it coming from
[1:13:56] thou shall love the Lord thy God and
[1:13:58] then
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; it will filter into loving your neighbor
[1:14:02] as yourself. Same way
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; this here
[1:14:08] Get the people to believe you first,
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; not beat them down. You don't believe
[1:14:14] the pastor. You don't believe anything
[1:14:16] here. No,
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; it doesn't work like that. It will never
[1:14:23] work like that. Not even with your
[1:14:24] children.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; And then the second half
[1:14:37] will automatically come from the frost.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; If you get the people to believe you,
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; then people will find it easy to believe
[1:14:45] when you're praying for them.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; They f the rest of the skies
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; because the first happened, the second
[1:14:55] can follow it.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:02] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:15:05] Amen.
[1:15:08] So because the first happened, the
[1:15:10] second will follow automatically.
[1:15:17] And the second have not even cancer did
[1:15:20] not mean only
[1:15:22] illnesses. That's why I showed you even
[1:15:24] animals couldn't stand before him. Even
[1:15:26] the natural elements couldn't stand
[1:15:27] before him.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; It could stop the sun,
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; whatever. So it wasn't just but cancer
[1:15:34] was a thing that was scary to
[1:15:37] the then known world even now it still
[1:15:39] is.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; So in other words everything cancer and
[1:15:44] under it
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; man's spirit nature will not be able to
[1:15:49] stand before you
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; if you can get the people to believe
[1:15:52] you.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; If it's so powerful if you get so much
[1:15:58] benefit from getting the people to
[1:15:59] believe you. Don't you think it's
[1:16:01] needful that you and I look a bit more
[1:16:04] closely into how to get the people to
[1:16:07] believe you?
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you think it's worthy of
[1:16:13] something to investigate? How to get the
[1:16:15] people to really believe you? Because I
[1:16:17] can tell you, they are not going to
[1:16:18] believe you because you are the pastor.
[1:16:20] They're not going to believe because you
[1:16:21] are fivefold. They're not going to
[1:16:22] believe you for that. Because if that
[1:16:24] was the case, the angel would have told
[1:16:26] William Brandham, you are a prophet.
[1:16:27] Same with the message. the the the the
[1:16:29] me the voice came 1933
[1:16:32] years before
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; telling me he was sent with a message to
[1:16:37] forerun the forerunner of Christ
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; it could not even tell the people
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; I'm forunning the message of Christ the
[1:16:46] coming of the Lord so you got to listen
[1:16:47] to me it's not going to cut it
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; can you say amen
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; I hope I haven't lost you yet
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; now I'm only I'm just warming
[1:16:59] Hallelujah.
[1:17:01] [Applause]
[1:17:08] So the second half of the statement, not
[1:17:11] even cancer will be able to stand before
[1:17:13] you
[1:17:16] was an inference that not any man, nor
[1:17:20] any spirit, nor anything in creation, no
[1:17:23] matter how difficult, how challenging,
[1:17:27] will be able to withstand him as he
[1:17:29] ministered. Christ to the people.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Don't you want to have that?
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; I want to have it.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; I want to have that. I long to have
[1:17:38] that.
[1:17:39] [Applause]
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Not for me, not for you, but so that our
[1:17:44] ministry will be more effective
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; to the people to whom we have been sent.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Not just preach a message and then we
[1:17:52] feel that was great.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; But what's the effect of it in the
[1:17:56] people's lives?
[1:17:58] Amen.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; What's the effect of the great mysteries
[1:18:03] you are preaching? I'm preaching in the
[1:18:05] people's lives. That's right.
[1:18:14] So not even cancer
[1:18:17] was an inference to brother Brandon that
[1:18:20] he would have such great power in his
[1:18:22] life and ministry over men over demons.
[1:18:27] Power in the human realm,
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; power in the supernatural realm, a power
[1:18:32] to talk, power to walk, power to live, a
[1:18:36] personal power
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; to have his own life under control.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Power over his own life.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; By the life of love that he demonstrated
[1:18:52] and lived. Amen.
[1:18:55] The power over man and spirit
[1:18:58] was not an action.
[1:19:01] It's not about I want to exercise this
[1:19:03] part. No, it's an it's a result. It's an
[1:19:05] outcome. Let me explain that.
[1:19:11] You know, in Genesis, it said when God
[1:19:13] told Adam and Eve, uh uh told Adam
[1:19:16] before Eve got there, be fruitful.
[1:19:18] What's that be? I am Adam. That's who
[1:19:20] you are. I am. Be fruitful.
[1:19:24] multiply, replenish, subdue,
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; and have dominion over all the things in
[1:19:31] the sea.
[1:19:35] The fruitful, Adam had to do it.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Multiply, Adam had to do it.
[1:19:41] The
[1:19:43] uh uh
[1:19:48] sub replenish, Adam had to do it.
[1:19:50] Subdue. Adam had to do it. But the
[1:19:52] dominion was the result.
[1:19:55] When you have
[1:19:57] multiplied, when you are fruitful, you
[1:20:00] have multiplied, you have replenished,
[1:20:02] you have subdued. That all added
[1:20:04] together, that's dominion.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; So the dominion was a result
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; of Adam doing all the four.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Adam didn't go said, I must have
[1:20:14] dominion. I must have dominion. I must
[1:20:15] have. No. No. But he went about say I've
[1:20:17] got to be fruitful here.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; I got to multiply here. But dominion was
[1:20:22] a result. It was an outcome.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; If he did not do the other works, he
[1:20:28] would never come to dominion.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Same thing here.
[1:20:39] If brother did not do the first half,
[1:20:42] get the people to believe you, he will
[1:20:44] never come to you.
[1:20:47] Not even cancer will be able to stand
[1:20:49] before you. So that wasn't an action.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; It was an effect. It was a result.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; It was an a consequence.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; It was an outcome of an earlier action
[1:21:02] that he had taken.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; In other words, he could not make it
[1:21:07] happen.
[1:21:09] That would only happen because of an
[1:21:11] earlier action that he took.
[1:21:13] In other words, Adam could not make
[1:21:14] dominion happen
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; if he hadn't multiplied fruitful and all
[1:21:20] the rest of them.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Same way, brother Benam could not make
[1:21:23] cancers bow to his words.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; If he did not go through the rigorous
[1:21:27] process
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; of getting the people to believe him.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you and I as you and I can
[1:21:40] testify and we know this promise that
[1:21:43] nothing will be able to stand before him
[1:21:45] was a promise to brother Brandham of the
[1:21:48] power and presence of the spirit of God
[1:21:50] in his life and ministry. It was a
[1:21:53] dynamics the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:55] working in his life and ministry. And we
[1:21:57] all the whole world saw that.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; That's right. and gave him a life and a
[1:22:04] ministry that revealed and identified
[1:22:06] the shout in the coming of the Lord. And
[1:22:09] I want to say I want to say
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; running through the message and the
[1:22:13] scriptures this promise that not even
[1:22:17] cancer will be able to stand before you
[1:22:20] is representative also of the promise of
[1:22:23] the dynamics to the brass mechanics
[1:22:27] to where nothing not even cancer will be
[1:22:30] able to stand before that bride.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; We have that promise also. We have met
[1:22:35] the same angel. The angel called the
[1:22:38] Holy Spirit
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; who has told us the same thing.
[1:22:43] Especially as ministers, get the people
[1:22:45] to believe you
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; and nothing will be able to stand before
[1:22:48] you.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:00] I You didn't notice the dynamics. The
[1:23:04] dynamics redemption
[1:23:07] comes by word and spirit. The word
[1:23:10] generally the mechanics the spirit the
[1:23:13] dynamics of the word.
[1:23:16] Have you noticed
[1:23:18] most of the dynamics has to do with the
[1:23:20] physical. Have you noticed that?
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Not all of it but most of it has to do
[1:23:27] with the physical.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; The mechanics are do with the spiritual.
[1:23:31] The world. The world. the word. But when
[1:23:34] the spirit comes on the word,
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; it quickens your mortal physical body.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; That's where you have the signs, the
[1:23:43] wonders, the miracles. That's where you
[1:23:45] have the healing the sick, raising the
[1:23:47] dead, blind eyes coming open, cancer has
[1:23:49] been healed. That's the dynamics.
[1:23:51] Usually has to do with the physical.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; In other words, God has everything under
[1:23:56] control. The spiritual, the physical,
[1:23:58] everything is under his control and he
[1:24:00] thinks about it all. Can you say amen?
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:13] So I believe that brother Brham's
[1:24:15] interaction with the angel before he got
[1:24:17] introduced to the world May 7 1946 is an
[1:24:21] example to you and I a shine to you and
[1:24:24] I of
[1:24:27] our lives ought to be and our ministries
[1:24:30] individual lives whatever we do whatever
[1:24:32] we are called to do but especially if
[1:24:34] you're called to minister because in the
[1:24:36] coming of the Lord there's an appearing
[1:24:39] and a coming.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. First he appears then he comes on
[1:24:45] the message end evangelism. Um
[1:24:49] same thing today when you see his work.
[1:24:52] Now we have already seen and are
[1:24:54] witnessing the appearing of the Lord.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Now remember appearing and coming is two
[1:25:00] different words
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; to appear and then to come.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Now is the appearing.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; He's already appeared in these last
[1:25:08] days. Amen.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Referring to his ministry
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; right here with us in these last few
[1:25:12] years.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Now, now, now this appearing, it's a
[1:25:17] sign
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; of his coming,
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; a sign how he would come.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Are you looking for the coming of the
[1:25:27] Lord?
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; That's your sign there. Look at how he
[1:25:31] appeared in the prophet. Then you know
[1:25:33] how he's going to appear in you also.
[1:25:36] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[1:25:43] [Applause]
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus appeared in Malachi 4 as a son of
[1:25:47] his coming.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Let me just close you. May be seated.
[1:25:51] Of how he would come. What does that
[1:25:53] mean? It means that the Christlike life
[1:25:56] and ministry that brother Benham lived
[1:25:58] was not his promise alone. It was only a
[1:26:01] sign to you and I of how it will be.
[1:26:06] Hallelujah.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; It was only a sign to you and I
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; of how we should carry on
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; in our own individual lives
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; and in our individual ministries as we
[1:26:16] wait for the coming of the Lord so we
[1:26:18] might be able to reveal and identify our
[1:26:22] own portion
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; in the coming of the Lord. In the light
[1:26:26] of this
[1:26:30] we can view and understand brother
[1:26:32] Benham's interaction with the angel
[1:26:34] May 7 1946
[1:26:36] because these instructions from the
[1:26:38] angel to brother Benham are pregnant
[1:26:41] loaded with deep meaning.
[1:26:43] Notice notice
[1:26:46] brought down to us today the
[1:26:48] instructions from the angel above the
[1:26:51] people.
[1:26:53] uh if you can get the people to believe
[1:26:54] you. It speaks to the ministers
[1:26:57] primarily but to all of us to husband to
[1:26:59] wife to everyone but the ministers
[1:27:01] primarily in the context in which I'm
[1:27:02] speaking here
[1:27:05] about their lives it speaks about if you
[1:27:08] you you can get the people to believe
[1:27:10] you whatever is hindering you from
[1:27:12] getting people to believe you get out of
[1:27:13] the way.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; In other words this was speaking to
[1:27:18] brother's personal life
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; was speaking to his reputation. If you
[1:27:23] have a reputation issue with any of the
[1:27:24] people you are sent to, they're not
[1:27:28] going to listen to you.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; So, get it out of the way.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Get it sorted out. Get it straightened
[1:27:33] out.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen?
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:45] If you can get the people to believe, he
[1:27:46] also speaks to the integrity which we
[1:27:49] carry themsel which we the the ministers
[1:27:52] carry themselves.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; The integrity.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; They being true to themselves, not a
[1:28:00] politician, not none of that stuff.
[1:28:04] [Music]
[1:28:07] It also speaks to the sincerity with
[1:28:10] with which they would uphold the word of
[1:28:12] faith
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; that has been committed to their care.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; All of which things influence and speak
[1:28:19] about their interactions with the
[1:28:20] people.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Because if the ministry can have no
[1:28:27] positive influence
[1:28:31] or impact on the people to whom they
[1:28:33] have been sent,
[1:28:35] I'm here to tell you simple truth is the
[1:28:38] people simply will not believe them
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; and if the people don't believe you are
[1:28:46] not going to get cancers healed
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; cancers will stay there
[1:28:52] eyes will stay there
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; because if you can get the people to
[1:28:59] believe you nothing's going to stand
[1:29:01] before you but people don't believe you.
[1:29:04] They sit down in church but they have
[1:29:07] their doubts.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; They sit down in church, they have their
[1:29:10] misgivings
[1:29:13] and they just are not going to believe
[1:29:15] for the miraculous to take place because
[1:29:17] brother Benham said it's not me, it's
[1:29:19] your faith
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; that makes it happen.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; I just speak the word and you trust that
[1:29:24] I'm speaking the words of God and you
[1:29:26] rise up in faith and it happens. Amen.
[1:29:29] That's what brother Bham said
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; healing comes from God. Any healing at
[1:29:37] all
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; if you go to DBA
[1:29:42] whoever
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; I know that's against many people's
[1:29:45] theology. But brother Benam said only
[1:29:47] God can heal.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; So he say how will the DB be able to
[1:29:52] heal the person? Said does Satan heal?
[1:29:55] People say yeah Satan heal. But said no
[1:29:56] Satan doesn't heal. He explained that
[1:29:58] because the people have so much faith in
[1:30:02] the personal that he is talking the word
[1:30:05] of God to them.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; That's why they get healed.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; So at the same time,
[1:30:12] the people are saying this is God
[1:30:15] healing me.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; They don't care if it's Dia, whoever.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; They don't care.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Same way in the church.
[1:30:24] The people that get to believe
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; you can bash them. You don't believe the
[1:30:28] word of God. You don't see what I show
[1:30:30] you this quote. Show you that quote. It
[1:30:31] doesn't matter.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; You are the agent
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; that's bringing the word. And you are
[1:30:36] part of the equation. Can you say amen?
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:30:45] [Applause]
[1:30:56] Oh, wow.
[1:31:01] [Applause]
[1:31:04] [Music]
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; All right, let me just let me just try.
[1:31:06] My time is really gone, but let me just
[1:31:08] try to run here. Um,
[1:31:13] okay. So, no matter how gifted you and I
[1:31:16] are, it matters not. If you don't have a
[1:31:19] positive influence or impact on the
[1:31:21] people, the people will suddenly simply
[1:31:22] not believe what we're telling them and
[1:31:25] we're not going to have the signs and
[1:31:26] wonders and miracles. It's as simple as
[1:31:28] that. If you think you're against some
[1:31:30] is just a small quantity to what could
[1:31:32] it be
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; if we can get the people
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; to believe.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my. So William Brown was warned by
[1:31:41] the angel that the only way his great
[1:31:43] gift will be received by the people. So
[1:31:45] they'll be blessed by his ministry and
[1:31:47] his gift is when he William Brandham
[1:31:50] will live and carry himself and his
[1:31:53] ministry in such Christlike manner that
[1:31:55] will cause the people to do nothing but
[1:31:58] just believe him.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; This is eating to brother Vam's personal
[1:32:01] life as he is going about with his
[1:32:03] ministry. So you can't have the ministry
[1:32:06] and then you just flip flop around like
[1:32:08] that. You can do it. You cannot do it.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; You are cutting away at your influence
[1:32:14] and your impact
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; in the on the people
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; and you cannot behave and live in
[1:32:20] certain ways.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; It's just going to eat away at your
[1:32:24] influence and the impact you have
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; on the people.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; So you understand why brother Bham live
[1:32:36] the life that he lived. All of us when
[1:32:38] we're talking about brother Bham, tears
[1:32:40] are coming down our cheeks. Brother
[1:32:41] Bham, what a life he lived. Oh my, oh
[1:32:45] great. Oh, brother Bham, what a life.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Well, I got news for you.
[1:32:52] A holy consequent life to God
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; was not brother Benham's promise alone.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; He was only a sign to us
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; of how Jesus will come.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Our lives ought to be like that too. So
[1:33:06] when they are talking about us, tears
[1:33:08] are coming down people's cheeks for the
[1:33:10] quality of life we have lived before
[1:33:12] them till not even cancer will be able
[1:33:15] to stand when we pray. It's not the
[1:33:17] shouting is just the authority and the s
[1:33:19] the devils recognize that authority many
[1:33:22] time is not shouting. Amen. Amen. You
[1:33:26] may be seated. May be seated. Amen.
[1:33:31] Can I take a bit more time please?
[1:33:33] [Applause]
[1:33:36] I'm getting nervous. I'm looking at the
[1:33:37] charm. I'm getting a little nervous.
[1:33:45] So this instruction from from brother
[1:33:47] Bham uh this instruction from the angel
[1:33:49] to brother Brandham
[1:33:52] went into his personal life, how to
[1:33:55] behave himself, how to conduct himself
[1:33:58] as a minister,
[1:34:00] how to conduct himself as a husband, how
[1:34:03] to conduct himself as a father, how to
[1:34:06] conduct himself in the neighborhood or
[1:34:08] your ministry will not be effective.
[1:34:12] You have brother Kmeta yesterday
[1:34:13] speaking about that woman in the
[1:34:14] neighborhood
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; and how she was trying to damage his
[1:34:16] reputation because she he had nothing to
[1:34:18] do with the people in neighborhood but
[1:34:20] the testimony was going to damage
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; him in the neighborhood. That's what I'm
[1:34:24] talking about.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; But what happens many times also you and
[1:34:30] I and I put myself in limits. I'm not
[1:34:31] talking to me. I'm talking to myself.
[1:34:37] We care so much about having a great
[1:34:39] reputation with people outside, but
[1:34:41] people inside, not so much.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Not so much. We can whip them. We can
[1:34:47] beat them. We can tell them this and all
[1:34:49] that stuff.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Did you see what happened? Excuse me.
[1:34:54] I'm sorry to say this. Yeah, forgive me.
[1:34:56] What happened recently with the minister
[1:34:58] and the soldier? I mean the NAV guy.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Would you want me to shock you? Many of
[1:35:05] us in the church on the pulpit we do
[1:35:08] that
[1:35:11] the impunity
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; with which we talk to the people
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; the audacity the the the gumption
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; to talk to the people like no because
[1:35:22] the people respect they're not going to
[1:35:24] come at you
[1:35:26] many of us do that
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; I've caught myself doing that
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; if you will catch you, you'll catch
[1:35:40] yourself doing that. If you if you if
[1:35:43] you're a leader in any way at all,
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; if you are a pastor or a husband, you'll
[1:35:48] catch yourself doing that to your wife.
[1:35:50] Many times you'll catch yourself doing
[1:35:52] that to your son, your daughter. Many
[1:35:53] times you'll catch yourself doing that
[1:35:55] to the deacons and the people in church.
[1:35:57] many times the impunity.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Shut up, sit down, get out, all that
[1:36:02] stuff, all that nonsense.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen?
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; After all, the seven thunder revelation
[1:36:11] is only an invitation
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; to live the life of Jesus Christ. The
[1:36:16] angel invited brother B into that life.
[1:36:18] And I'm only sharing with you my
[1:36:21] understanding of it for him to have that
[1:36:23] kind of effect because brother Isaac has
[1:36:25] gathered us together to find this lost
[1:36:27] coin. So we will not it will not just be
[1:36:30] like brother say years ago a talking
[1:36:32] festation but it will be a manifestation
[1:36:35] a living experience of brotherly
[1:36:37] kindness of the honey sticking of the
[1:36:41] honey sticking of the honey sticking.
[1:36:44] Amen. Amen.
[1:36:47] Oh hallelujah.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; So this instruction went beyond went
[1:36:57] into private private life, his personal
[1:37:00] life, but went beyond that
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; and then went into his interactions with
[1:37:04] the people
[1:37:06] and spoke about the atmosphere that
[1:37:09] would exist in his relationship with the
[1:37:12] people. You may be seated.
[1:37:16] My title is the home that love built.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; You know what that home is
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; should be our church home.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; But many of our church homes are not
[1:37:28] like that. No, not in Lagos. Not
[1:37:33] anywhere. I don't know about your
[1:37:34] church. Maybe you're like that. Our
[1:37:35] church in Los is not like that. We are
[1:37:36] still trying to get there.
[1:37:39] [Applause]
[1:37:41] The home
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; that love built. Love will be our home.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Love will. Love will. Love will be our
[1:37:53] home. Love doesn't scream down on
[1:37:56] people. Love doesn't tell people get
[1:37:58] out. Love is gentle.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; It's kind. It suffers long.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:08] does not v itself, does not behave
[1:38:11] itself unseemly like the minister did
[1:38:14] and like many of us I said do
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; even to your son to your daughter.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Father, mother love does not behave
[1:38:22] unseemly.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; You can get your point across without
[1:38:26] screaming down and shouting down people
[1:38:28] every time.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; That's love. That's brotherly kindness.
[1:38:35] Put yourself in your brother's place on
[1:38:37] the matter. How is he feeling when I
[1:38:39] chop him this way? Bring him to the
[1:38:40] pulpit and shame him before everybody.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Shame him and tell him and put him down.
[1:38:46] When his son is there, his daughter is
[1:38:48] there in the assembly and they are
[1:38:49] hearing you shame their father like
[1:38:51] that.
[1:38:52] [Music]
[1:38:56] [Applause]
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; The honey sticks.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, it does. You may be seated. You
[1:39:04] may be seated. Glory.
[1:39:06] [Applause]
[1:39:21] So what the angel told him create an
[1:39:24] atmosphere in his life. Atmosphere of
[1:39:26] the love of God in his heart
[1:39:29] in interaction with people. Gabriel saw
[1:39:31] it and gave him a life that measures up
[1:39:35] to the stature of a perfect man. A life
[1:39:37] that like brother Kameda said yesterday,
[1:39:39] brother Joseph Martin said of him,
[1:39:43] brother Panam, you would never know, you
[1:39:45] could never know his friends from his
[1:39:47] enemies.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; And like brother read in that
[1:39:53] outstanding opening message, the
[1:39:56] atmosphere that you create and live in
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; is everything.
[1:40:01] is everything
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; and the atmosphere you live in, you
[1:40:04] create for yourself determines to a very
[1:40:06] great extent the results that you will
[1:40:07] get.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Brother B said to get anything at all if
[1:40:10] you want to if you want if you want a
[1:40:12] healing line you create the atmosphere
[1:40:13] for a healing line for faith for in
[1:40:15] line. You want you want to preach you
[1:40:17] create the atmosphere for that.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; And brother Billy Paul said brother
[1:40:21] Brown will always stay in the study in
[1:40:23] the tabernacle until the atmosphere was
[1:40:25] just right for the preaching of the so
[1:40:27] you create the atmosphere you want.
[1:40:32] So if the atmosphere is wrong in the
[1:40:34] church, who's responsible the people?
[1:40:36] No,
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; the pastor.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; If the pastor picks a quar with
[1:40:42] everybody in church over every single
[1:40:43] thing,
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; what kind of atmosphere are you going to
[1:40:45] get?
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; You're going to get a we versus them
[1:40:51] atmosphere. That's war
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; in the church.
[1:40:58] fighting a battle that Jesus fought and
[1:41:00] won long ago.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Now the song says, "I'm going to study
[1:41:08] war no more.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; I'm going to study war no more. I will
[1:41:11] fight no more forever."
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Some of the nonsense we have had in the
[1:41:17] message in this country, I don't know
[1:41:18] about anywhere in this country because
[1:41:19] I'm part of it.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; The nonsense we have some of that going
[1:41:22] on. Some of our children who are in
[1:41:24] their 40s and brother Chibbo talked this
[1:41:26] morning about coming the message 1975 50
[1:41:28] years on we still have that foolishness
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; this church against this church bill get
[1:41:35] on the pulpit all they do on the pulpit
[1:41:36] is to spew this poison out
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; and you wonder we don't see signs and
[1:41:43] wonders and miracles among us how we
[1:41:45] going to see it
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; how is love going to drop down in that
[1:41:50] arms of air we'll be standing talking
[1:41:52] all of All of a sudden, just the prince
[1:41:54] of law will drop down
[1:41:58] and all that's wrong, all that's evil,
[1:42:00] all the cancers will be taken out.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; It's not going to happen when we still
[1:42:05] go on like that. Talk against this one,
[1:42:07] talk against that one. And the pastor,
[1:42:09] the minister himself creating war in the
[1:42:11] church where there's none.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Somebody does wrong, call them.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; I'll read you brother Bham today.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; I'll read you his quote.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:21] [Applause]
[1:42:34] [Applause]
[1:42:41] Let me skip all this.
[1:42:44] Brother, as you read this school, let me
[1:42:46] read a quote here
[1:42:48] from Love 1956. Now, do you realize
[1:42:51] being a son or a daughter of God that
[1:42:53] you're a man of creator? Do you know
[1:42:55] that you create the atmosphere that you
[1:42:56] live in? Do you realize that the
[1:42:59] atmosphere that you dwell in, you
[1:43:01] influence somebody else?
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; In other words, the pastor of the church
[1:43:06] has the has the power as a man of great
[1:43:10] under God to create the atmosphere that
[1:43:13] he wants to live in in his church.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; No matter what the prophets, what the
[1:43:16] Bible said. So
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; the parents in their home can create the
[1:43:22] atmosphere
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; they want in their home.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; It's not the children.
[1:43:31] [Applause]
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:35] [Applause]
[1:43:39] Therefore,
[1:43:41] I say that it's it's imperative,
[1:43:45] it's obligatory for the ministry in the
[1:43:48] local church to create the atmosphere
[1:43:51] that they want between them and their
[1:43:53] people,
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; the people they've been sent to minister
[1:43:56] to,
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; an atmosphere where it will be easy for
[1:44:00] the people to believe them.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; And that's an atmosphere of love.
[1:44:05] Hallelujah.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Where the people feel the love of God.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Coming from the ministry.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Coming from their leaders.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Bless your heart. Amen.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Means you should never rebuke sin. No.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; But where love will be there speaking
[1:44:25] the truth, love will be there rebuking,
[1:44:27] love will be there doing all that needs
[1:44:28] to be done.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; But you and I know we don't do that many
[1:44:31] times.
[1:44:33] No, we don't.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; And when we do everything from that
[1:44:41] atmosphere that we create in our
[1:44:43] churches, in our lives of love, the love
[1:44:46] of God, people will respond with belief
[1:44:49] in the words that we are speaking to
[1:44:50] them
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; and they'll do it quickly because
[1:44:55] they'll feel love coming back coming to
[1:44:57] you. They'll get love back to you. And
[1:44:59] Jesus say if you love me the things that
[1:45:01] tell you do them
[1:45:03] when you love you find it easy to do.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Let me read you this quote here. Brother
[1:45:12] Bramson divine love 956 because you have
[1:45:15] to come out of the atmosphere that you
[1:45:16] are in into this other atmosphere. When
[1:45:18] you do that God lifts you right up from
[1:45:20] the world and you live in a heavenly
[1:45:22] atmosphere. See and then to the wall you
[1:45:24] are just contrary to what that is. See
[1:45:26] this is contrary to the world. See, now
[1:45:30] what you want to do is to be lifted up
[1:45:33] by Christ into an atmosphere to where
[1:45:35] you are happy and peaceful and then in
[1:45:37] there you create a situation. And now
[1:45:41] many times we in churches this may seem
[1:45:44] strange but if you just watch it now
[1:45:47] this is for the church is for the
[1:45:50] people.
[1:45:51] The people get what get one another's
[1:45:53] spirit instead of getting the Holy
[1:45:55] Spirit. You go into a group of people,
[1:45:57] you watch the way that a person acts and
[1:46:00] then find people that come into that
[1:46:02] congregation. The first thing you know,
[1:46:04] they act the same way.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; You take a good man and a bad man and
[1:46:09] he'll either he either he'll become a
[1:46:11] good man or hire a bad woman.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; And the atmosphere that you live in, you
[1:46:15] project your associates
[1:46:18] what you are.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when the pastor has an
[1:46:22] atmosphere around him,
[1:46:25] it creates that atmosphere and projects
[1:46:28] it to his associates around him where he
[1:46:30] is. When the father, the mother has an
[1:46:34] atmosphere in their home around them,
[1:46:37] they project it to their children and
[1:46:39] their home around them. Thus say the
[1:46:42] prophet.
[1:46:46] Then what type of people ought we to be
[1:46:49] if we're a Christian? What type of an
[1:46:51] atmosphere should we live in? In a
[1:46:53] consoling, soothing, healing atmosphere.
[1:46:57] We should live in with our hearts
[1:46:59] constantly in prayer
[1:47:02] with a deep love for every person we
[1:47:06] come in contact with.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; If I say this to the little church,
[1:47:12] listen to this. Listen to this. If I
[1:47:13] said to the little church that's prayed
[1:47:15] for me for the world missions, that's my
[1:47:18] success in praying for the sick, in
[1:47:21] getting into a deep love with everybody
[1:47:24] I come in contact with.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; That's my success in praying for the
[1:47:29] sick.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; If I can't get it right down into the
[1:47:32] feeling of the sickness with the person,
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; it usually doesn't do any good.
[1:47:38] You've got to come right down
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; and you've feeded yourself.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; And he read this. I told this story.
[1:47:45] I'll quickly read it. You know it
[1:47:46] already. But let me to make a point to
[1:47:48] you here. Some time ago an old Mexican
[1:47:50] man down here on the platform where he
[1:47:52] run to the platform. Much faith. He fell
[1:47:54] down, grabbed out his rosary. I told him
[1:47:56] not necessary. And through the inter
[1:47:58] interpreter, brother Espinosa. So he
[1:48:00] raised up. He put the arms around me.
[1:48:02] Begin going some way. He was blind. I
[1:48:04] looked at him. I looked at them all.
[1:48:06] wrinkle up feet. Probably never wore a
[1:48:08] pair of shoes in his life. I looked at
[1:48:10] my shoes, see if they will fit him. I'd
[1:48:12] give him my shoes. He was blind. And I
[1:48:15] looked, he was wider across his
[1:48:17] shoulder, big man, weigh 200 and
[1:48:19] something. I guess he couldn't have worn
[1:48:21] my coat. And he, as he was standing
[1:48:23] there and the gray hair, I thought of my
[1:48:25] daddy. I thought if daddy would have
[1:48:27] lived to be about this age, he would
[1:48:29] have been about the same age as this man
[1:48:32] around 65 or 70 years old. And I enter
[1:48:34] into a love of that man the way that I
[1:48:38] thought. Amen. Maybe he never had a
[1:48:42] decent meal in his life. Maybe he never
[1:48:44] sit down at a table in his life and all
[1:48:46] this and then walking along in darkness.
[1:48:49] Then something come into my heart. God
[1:48:51] be merciful. He's a man. He's a brother.
[1:48:53] Then that strikes. There's something
[1:48:55] anoint that the creation moves around
[1:48:57] and is projected to this person. The
[1:48:59] love atmosphere of the Bible towards
[1:49:01] that man began to project to that man.
[1:49:04] He didn't even know how to pray for him.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; His prayer to this person in a few
[1:49:14] moments I heard him hollering something
[1:49:16] over my shoulder and he was hollering. I
[1:49:18] can see I can see.
[1:49:21] He said the secret of my ministry just
[1:49:24] get into a deep love with everybody. And
[1:49:26] then he gave an example.
[1:49:29] of the blind man and just go into a
[1:49:32] feeling for it. Would you know some
[1:49:34] young person in your church
[1:49:37] so twisted up, so so evil, so arrogant,
[1:49:40] so messed up and all we are is to show
[1:49:43] him and let him know the pastor
[1:49:44] authority is speaking here or you get
[1:49:48] into a feeling
[1:49:50] this young man is so twisted up. How did
[1:49:52] he get in this shape here? Oh father,
[1:49:56] that could be my son. That could be me
[1:49:59] in his age. Oh father, if you can only
[1:50:02] reach your grace out to him.
[1:50:05] That's the kind of thing he's talking
[1:50:07] about here. You won't have you may not
[1:50:09] even have to talk to the young man. And
[1:50:10] the Holy Spirit strikes him there
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; and he straightens up without you even
[1:50:17] saying one word. We make it so
[1:50:19] difficult. So difficult for ourselves.
[1:50:21] So difficult.
[1:50:29] What was it? The blind man. Divine love.
[1:50:33] Sympathy had been projected by the Holy
[1:50:36] Spirit into this man.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Can sympathy be projected from the
[1:50:41] pulpit? Empathy, a feeling of love for
[1:50:46] the people in who are wound up, who have
[1:50:48] messed up?
[1:50:54] sympathy had prayed by the Holy Spirit
[1:50:56] to this man and but that at the end of
[1:50:58] the road where he couldn't nothing could
[1:50:59] be done and love had taken its place and
[1:51:03] love had met love then sovereign grace
[1:51:06] went to work
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; and God through sovereign grace restored
[1:51:09] the sight to the man
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; first you have to enter into that
[1:51:13] thought
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; that's the way you have to do to a
[1:51:16] sinner
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; are you are you hearing me
[1:51:21] That's the same way you have to do a
[1:51:22] sinner to somebody who's messed up in
[1:51:24] the church.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Many people pray for sinners. That's all
[1:51:29] right. But that's not the way to win a
[1:51:31] sinner.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; It's your business to win the sinner.
[1:51:35] You don't win him by just praying for
[1:51:37] him. You win him by talking to him
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; and introducing him to Christ. That's
[1:51:43] your business. That's your duty is to
[1:51:45] win sinners by talking to them and
[1:51:48] projecting to them the love of God
[1:51:50] through the word of God that wins the
[1:51:52] sinner.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Someone say I won't go to church. I sure
[1:51:58] like that woman. I like that fellow seed
[1:52:01] because you are winning them. If you
[1:52:03] stayed home and just prayed for the
[1:52:04] sinner, never went to contact him.
[1:52:07] There's very little can be done. But we
[1:52:09] got to pray and then go. That's right.
[1:52:12] Go and do it. the projecting of this
[1:52:14] love.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; Oh friends, it's about the people,
[1:52:17] friends. It's about it's about
[1:52:19] projecting the love of God to the
[1:52:20] people. Hallelujah.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not for the ministers is for
[1:52:25] the people.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Now, if you notice Ephesians 4 where I
[1:52:28] talk about the fold ministry there, the
[1:52:29] work of the ministry is all about the
[1:52:31] people. For the work of the ministry,
[1:52:33] for the edifying of the body of Christ,
[1:52:35] for the perfecting of the saints, the
[1:52:37] work of the ministry has not to do with
[1:52:39] the ministers themselves. It's for the
[1:52:40] people. It's for the people. is for the
[1:52:43] people. Even from God's perspective,
[1:52:44] it's for the people.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; So the people are God's focus in
[1:52:51] redemption, not the ministers.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; The people like the angel of the Bham.
[1:52:57] It's not about the ministers. It's about
[1:52:59] the people.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; The five ministry or any ministry is
[1:53:02] there at all because of the people and
[1:53:04] not the other way around.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Like I just read to you, the job
[1:53:08] description of the five ministry is all
[1:53:10] about the people. the work of the
[1:53:12] ministry which consists of the edifying
[1:53:15] of the body of Christ, the perfecting of
[1:53:17] the saints. Without the people, there's
[1:53:19] no need for any ministry,
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; none whatsoever.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; If you are not here, what are we
[1:53:24] preaching to?
[1:53:29] So William Brandham was able to have
[1:53:31] this atmosphere of love relationship in
[1:53:34] his personal life and that deep love he
[1:53:37] projected to everyone like I just read
[1:53:39] to you
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; to the sinner to everybody to his
[1:53:41] children who were wayward
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; to Billy Paul in his wayward state
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; even after he was gone that influence
[1:53:51] still lingered.
[1:53:55] Brother Joseph was just a 10 year old
[1:53:57] when his father passed
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; and then he went into drugs. This same
[1:54:00] Joseph Brandham
[1:54:02] with long hair but that love was still
[1:54:05] projecting
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; and look at where he is today.
[1:54:16] So William Brandham was able to have
[1:54:18] this atmosphere of love relationship in
[1:54:21] his personal life and all of his
[1:54:23] interactions with the people only
[1:54:25] because first first he had a right
[1:54:28] perspective on his own love relationship
[1:54:30] with the savior first
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; and because of this he could create an
[1:54:34] atmosphere of love
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; in his relationship with everyone that
[1:54:37] he met deep love.
[1:54:41] So William and Brham lived in the love
[1:54:42] relationship all around.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; And the people could feel and experience
[1:54:47] that love atmosphere.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; And because they could feel it,
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; they believed him.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; And not even cancer
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; could stand before him.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; So going by this example, and I'm trying
[1:55:03] to find a place to wind down. I have to
[1:55:06] leave a lot of these. Going by this
[1:55:08] example, how the prophet went about to
[1:55:10] get the people to believe him in order
[1:55:13] for the dynamics to be on full and
[1:55:17] constant display in his ministry.
[1:55:19] The faithful ministry or any ministry at
[1:55:22] all should also live in an atmosphere of
[1:55:25] love at all times. Love the prophet did
[1:55:27] both in their own personal lives and in
[1:55:30] their every interaction with the people
[1:55:32] in the church, outside the church.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; Those who love them, those who don't
[1:55:35] love them.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:39] And furthermore, furthermore, beyond
[1:55:41] that,
[1:55:42] this atmosphere of law should translate
[1:55:44] into our churches
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; coming from the ministry.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; Trans into our churches
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; to where every one of our churches will
[1:55:55] become and truly feel like the home that
[1:56:00] love built.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, sir. And each one of
[1:56:04] our churches
[1:56:06] will become a home with an abundant
[1:56:08] atmosphere of love and a culture of
[1:56:12] fellowship, a culture of unity, a
[1:56:14] culture of growth, a place where the
[1:56:17] five-fold ministry or the ministry in
[1:56:19] that church has been able to get the
[1:56:21] people to truly believe them. Amen. and
[1:56:24] where the people gladly believe
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; and as a result the spirit will be
[1:56:29] flowing freely in that group with signs,
[1:56:33] wonders and miracles till not even
[1:56:35] cancer
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; will be able to stand in any of those
[1:56:40] local assemblies. Unfortunately, our
[1:56:42] churches are mostly not this way because
[1:56:45] many of our churches
[1:56:47] it
[1:56:49] most of us in the ministry and most of
[1:56:50] us believers do not have the right
[1:56:53] perspective on our own relationship with
[1:56:55] the Lord.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; We don't have a love relationship with
[1:56:58] the Lord even though we say we love him.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; Many of us ministers and I say again I
[1:57:03] place myself right in the mix. I'm not
[1:57:05] talking to anybody. I'm preaching to
[1:57:06] myself.
[1:57:08] Many of us know we are sons of God,
[1:57:12] but we do not think like sons.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; And neither do we operate like sons.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Many of us have a love deficit
[1:57:24] in our relationship with God.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; And because we have that relationship
[1:57:28] with God, we have a love deficit in our
[1:57:31] relationship with one another.
[1:57:37] We do not have a love relationship with
[1:57:38] God. We have a fear relationship with
[1:57:41] God many times. Even though we talk
[1:57:43] love,
[1:57:44] but a life that will truly reflect and
[1:57:47] reveal the love of the father, we are
[1:57:49] mostly far from it. And as a result,
[1:57:54] we are not able to rightly reflect the
[1:57:57] person and love of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:57:59] to the congregation because we have a
[1:58:02] love deficit ourselves in relationship
[1:58:04] with God.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; I'll explain to you what that means in a
[1:58:08] minute as I'm trying to find a place to
[1:58:10] wind down and close here.
[1:58:14] Because we have a love deficit in
[1:58:15] relationship with God, we pass this on
[1:58:17] to the church. And this love deficit
[1:58:20] becomes the default
[1:58:24] in the church.
[1:58:26] Becomes a default where we live in the
[1:58:28] church.
[1:58:32] Even though we talk a lot of love in the
[1:58:35] church
[1:58:38] because we the ministers
[1:58:41] do not have this right love relationship
[1:58:43] with the Lord and I'm making bold to say
[1:58:47] that.
[1:58:49] So we live in that atmosphere. We have a
[1:58:52] love deficit. So we project that love
[1:58:54] deficit to the people and the people see
[1:58:58] us representing God to them because
[1:59:00] that's what we do. And so they picture
[1:59:03] God the way we are to them.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; That person that's always angry with
[1:59:10] them, that's short fuse with them, that
[1:59:12] can't stand them, whatever they do
[1:59:14] something wrong. Instead of admonishing
[1:59:16] them, they every small thing they are
[1:59:18] cutting off their head
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; because we represent God to them. That's
[1:59:20] how they view God. That kind of person,
[1:59:22] you are not going to be free with him.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; You're going to be very edgy with him.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; And that's how many of our churches are.
[1:59:31] No, I don't need to give me a witness
[1:59:32] back. I know it.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; I've been around too long. I know it.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:59:49] have
[1:59:51] this right love relationship with the
[1:59:53] Lord. So the people also end up not
[1:59:55] having the right love relationship with
[1:59:57] the Lord either. Sure we are believers.
[2:00:00] Sure we love the Lord and we know it and
[2:00:02] I know you love the Lord.
[2:00:05] Sure we are sons of God.
[2:00:08] The only problem is
[2:00:11] we mostly have not fully
[2:00:15] believed or embraced and received the
[2:00:17] love of our heavenly father.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; We love him, but we're not so sure how
[2:00:23] deep
[2:00:25] his love toward us is.
[2:00:27] We must almost always feel he's
[2:00:30] dissatisfied with us. Almost always.
[2:00:33] Because the pastor is almost always not
[2:00:35] happy with you, not happy with the
[2:00:38] church about something. So the people
[2:00:39] get in that complex and see God is just
[2:00:43] never happy with them. When the Holy
[2:00:45] Spirit saying here is my beloved son
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; in whom I am well pleased, God's not
[2:00:51] angry with you.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; And so the people in the church live
[2:00:57] with a constant consciousness of they
[2:00:59] must have done something wrong. No, you
[2:01:00] haven't done anything wrong. If you've
[2:01:01] done something wrong, repent.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; God's waiting for you to repent.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; Not to go further away from you. Repent.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; When you do something wrong, it doesn't
[2:01:10] get away from you. Your sin takes you
[2:01:12] away from him.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; And whether you reconnect back or not is
[2:01:16] up to you.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; When you repent, you'll reconnect back
[2:01:19] to him.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; If your father loves you, he wants a
[2:01:23] love atmosphere in the church,
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; in your life, in your home.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; The devil is lying to you.
[2:01:31] Amen.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; Because we operate with that love
[2:01:44] deficit. Many times we serve God in
[2:01:46] fear.
[2:01:48] As a result, we're not able to fully
[2:01:52] believe for, embrace, and enjoy the
[2:01:55] blessings of our father's love
[2:01:59] that's already in store for us the place
[2:02:02] of our redemption. We know Jesus died
[2:02:05] for our sins. He died for our healing.
[2:02:08] He died for our deliverance. We say
[2:02:10] that, but how many of us really
[2:02:11] experience it?
[2:02:19] That's the reason friends
[2:02:21] the way I understand it while the
[2:02:23] supernatural not even cancer has not
[2:02:26] been a has been largely missing
[2:02:31] in our assemblies
[2:02:33] because we don't have a real love
[2:02:35] atmosphere in the place. Good brother
[2:02:37] Bham said love will be nowhere else but
[2:02:40] in the bride.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; You'll be standing talking just the
[2:02:43] prince of love will drop down. We've
[2:02:45] been quoting it and quoting and quoting
[2:02:46] it. When is it going to be
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; because faith workketh by love?
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; And because we're not just experiencing
[2:02:56] that love as we should, we're not able
[2:02:59] to trust and believe him for all that he
[2:03:01] has promised us in his word. Oh
[2:03:03] hallelujah. That's why the supernatural
[2:03:06] has been largely missing. We get it one
[2:03:08] here, one here, one there. But God wants
[2:03:09] such a flow of it to where you say
[2:03:11] there's my spirit flowing freely.
[2:03:14] Hallelujah. But I believe all of that is
[2:03:17] about to change. I believe God brought
[2:03:19] you to this ministry for all of that to
[2:03:21] change.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In your individual life in
[2:03:25] our churches to where we get back into a
[2:03:28] love affair with God. Hallelujah. Love
[2:03:30] affair with one another. So in love with
[2:03:32] God, so in love with this world, so in
[2:03:34] love with your brother, so in love with
[2:03:35] your sister. Hallelujah.
[2:03:38] Hallelujah.
[2:03:40] The prodigal son's home represents the
[2:03:42] type of church home that most of our
[2:03:45] churches are even to the very best of
[2:03:48] our assemblies.
[2:03:50] Home should be a place of intimacy
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; between all the various groups in the
[2:03:54] home, husband to wife and vice versa,
[2:03:57] parents to the children, vice versa, the
[2:04:00] children in the home to one another.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; And so should it be also in the church,
[2:04:05] in the spiritual home where God is the
[2:04:07] father and head.
[2:04:09] So be it at church, at home or work,
[2:04:12] every child of God should have that
[2:04:14] intimacy with God as their father.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; Every child of God should have that
[2:04:18] intimacy with one another.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; Other children of God in the same home.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; What this intimacy means
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; in the home
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; is a closeness
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; that's not based upon anything immoral.
[2:04:31] No, but based upon valuing and loving
[2:04:36] the other person because of who they
[2:04:38] are, not because of what they should
[2:04:41] they will do for you, whether they hurt
[2:04:43] you or don't hurt you.
[2:04:46] What constitute intimacy in the right
[2:04:48] and proper context in the church and
[2:04:50] elsewhere is loving one another, valuing
[2:04:53] each person because of who they are and
[2:04:56] not because of what they can do for you
[2:04:58] or what you can get or hope to get from
[2:04:59] them.
[2:05:02] loving and valuing God for who he is and
[2:05:05] not because of what he will do for you.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; Loving and valuing your children, your
[2:05:10] siblings, your Christian brothers and
[2:05:12] sisters, not because of what you can get
[2:05:14] from them, but because of who they are.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; Loving and valing your parents because
[2:05:19] of who they are, not because of what
[2:05:20] they will do for you
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; or what you expect to get from them.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Whether it be a natural
[2:05:28] home or a spiritual home, a home should
[2:05:30] be a place of security. It should be a
[2:05:32] place of love. Should be a place of
[2:05:34] value. It should be a place of
[2:05:35] encouragement.
[2:05:38] All of this sums up into home as a
[2:05:40] non-threatening environment
[2:05:43] where every member feels safe and
[2:05:45] secure. Unfortunately, many of our homes
[2:05:48] and church homes are environments where
[2:05:50] the occupants feel threatened
[2:05:52] continuously. I talk with many young
[2:05:54] people in this country, not many as in
[2:05:57] hundred but appreciably a number. Many
[2:05:59] of them feel so threatened in their own
[2:06:01] homes under their own father and
[2:06:03] mother's roofs
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; cuz the parents are so threatening
[2:06:08] commanding authority. That's the only
[2:06:10] way they interact with the children.
[2:06:12] Commanding authority, screaming,
[2:06:14] shouting. Is that how God does with you?
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; Is that how God does with you?
[2:06:25] A home should be a place of securing a
[2:06:28] non-threatening environment.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; Consistently screaming,
[2:06:35] demeaning,
[2:06:37] faulting, correcting all the time or
[2:06:39] make up a very threatening environment.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; Our home should be a place of love,
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; of forgiveness
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; and acceptance.
[2:06:49] Oh, hallelujah.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to close here. Amen. Oh my.
[2:06:54] It's too bad I didn't do justice to this
[2:06:56] at all.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; But the experience of salvation.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; When anyone gets saved
[2:07:04] is coming home to our father God.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; Salvation represents coming back home to
[2:07:11] a spiritual home where the father is
[2:07:13] God.
[2:07:15] Unfortunately, many come back up to God
[2:07:18] and they are saved,
[2:07:20] come out of the world, but they don't
[2:07:22] come into the loving embrace of a loving
[2:07:25] father.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; Because the atmosphere in the church,
[2:07:28] the atmosphere in the home doesn't
[2:07:30] present God as a loving father.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; Go check Brother's life the way he dealt
[2:07:36] with sinners. You say, "But we should
[2:07:38] rebuke sin, brother." You couldn't
[2:07:39] rebuke him more than brother Bam did.
[2:07:42] When you have that atmosphere of love
[2:07:44] like that, you can rebuke sin all you
[2:07:46] want.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; Then you'll get the results.
[2:07:52] [Applause]
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; So many come back to God, come back home
[2:07:59] to God and they are saved, even baptized
[2:08:02] in the Holy Spirit, but still fail to
[2:08:05] operate with all the benefits that God
[2:08:08] has for his family.
[2:08:11] because of a love deficit. They live
[2:08:13] almost like orphans.
[2:08:15] This God is their father. But they can't
[2:08:18] relate to him like a father because of
[2:08:22] the way we who represent God have
[2:08:25] projected God to them.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; And so they come to church, they're
[2:08:32] saved.
[2:08:34] They go from a prodigal son.
[2:08:38] They become saved now. They become a
[2:08:40] prodigal brother. Prodigal it simply
[2:08:45] means wasteful.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; It means generous in a in a in a in a
[2:08:50] wrong way. Just spend wasting your
[2:08:53] resources.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; When you get saved and you waste the
[2:08:59] resources of the love of the father,
[2:09:04] you are pretty girl.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; I am prodigy girl.
[2:09:14] the prodigal son's home. St. Luke 15,
[2:09:16] like we read as I'm I'm I'm trying to
[2:09:18] find a place to wind out here. The
[2:09:20] father typified what home should be
[2:09:22] like.
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; The big brother typified what home
[2:09:26] should not be like.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; What home should be like? With the
[2:09:30] unconditional love of the father God.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; We talk unconditional love and people do
[2:09:35] sin in church.
[2:09:37] and we cast them out
[2:09:40] and we major on whatever instead of
[2:09:43] looking for the sinner to come back
[2:09:44] home.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; This father God here in this parable
[2:09:50] here gave us an example
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; to always make room
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; for the prodigal son
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; to come back home.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; Leave the space to where the prodigal
[2:10:03] son
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; would come back home. Praise the Amen.
[2:10:08] [Applause]
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory.
[2:10:19] The father represent God. The prodigal
[2:10:23] son unsaved in the church, backing in
[2:10:27] the church. the prodigal brother saved
[2:10:31] but with a love deficit
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; because he cannot see God as a God of
[2:10:37] love like that. So that's how he deal
[2:10:39] with everybody else too.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; He just couldn't see God forgive this
[2:10:43] sin here, this sinner here.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; He just couldn't see it.
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; Because that's how he relates to God.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; He hasn't seen God throw his sins into
[2:10:55] the sea of forgetfulness.
[2:11:03] Oh hallelujah.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; The polygraph brother is saved but still
[2:11:10] is still so far away from a true
[2:11:12] experience of the father's love. So he
[2:11:15] becomes self-righteous.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; He becomes unconsciously relying on his
[2:11:20] works instead of on grace
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; on the father's goodness.
[2:11:25] The father's unconditional love, it
[2:11:27] begins to perform for love.
[2:11:33] The prodigy son, we know who he is. He's
[2:11:35] unsaved. Is wisful of the father's
[2:11:38] abundant resources because he has yet
[2:11:41] does not understand the father's love
[2:11:43] and has not come to a saving knowledge
[2:11:45] of the father's love. But the prodigal
[2:11:48] older brother,
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; though he is saved
[2:11:52] yet,
[2:11:55] He's prodical as well
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; because he's wasteful of the father's
[2:11:59] abundant resources as well.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; He has come out of the world but hasn't
[2:12:04] run into the father's love and embrace
[2:12:06] just yet.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; He's not experiencing the joy of in
[2:12:10] Christ.
[2:12:12] He's often insecure
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; and lacks the peace that comes from
[2:12:15] resting in the father's love. He just
[2:12:18] cannot rest in the father's love. He
[2:12:21] must do something. It's not enough for
[2:12:23] him to rest in the father's love.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; The prodigal brother,
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; he serves God out of fear instead of
[2:12:30] being rooted rooted deep in the father's
[2:12:32] love.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; He serves God out of duty
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; instead of from a joyful and delightful
[2:12:37] heart.
[2:12:39] [Applause]
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; He views God through the lens of a
[2:12:43] deficient father or parent, earthly
[2:12:46] father parent or a deficient ministry in
[2:12:49] the church.
[2:12:51] and he's reading to God as if there was
[2:12:53] that earthly parent.
[2:12:56] Consequently, he operates with a love
[2:12:58] deficit like an orphan. When in actual
[2:13:02] fact, all that the father has belongs to
[2:13:04] him.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; With a love deficiency, it begins to
[2:13:08] perform to please God so he can win his
[2:13:12] love and approval. And when we project
[2:13:14] this in the church, people in the church
[2:13:16] starts to perform to please the pastor,
[2:13:19] to impress the leadership instead of
[2:13:21] pleasing God.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; Because that's what we are presented to
[2:13:24] them that God is like
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; the prodigal brother,
[2:13:35] he does all of this seeking to impress
[2:13:38] God and win God's approval. Amen.
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; The prodigal brother is intent on
[2:13:43] serving God and winning God's favor and
[2:13:45] approval. And because of this, he reads
[2:13:48] his Bible and prays every day. Even
[2:13:49] though he read a Bible and pray every
[2:13:50] day, but his motive is wrong.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; He gets involved with Christian
[2:13:55] missions, evangelism and all that. He
[2:13:58] gives and he's serving in church and
[2:13:59] serving in the neighborhood.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; All this so he'll be accepted by God.
[2:14:05] Wow.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; He feels unwanted
[2:14:09] because that's how he's made to feel in
[2:14:11] the church.
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; He does something wrong. Instead of
[2:14:14] running quickly to the house like this
[2:14:16] young man run back to the house, they
[2:14:18] run further away because when they get
[2:14:20] to church with their wrongs, they're
[2:14:21] going to be shamed before everybody
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; for the wrong they have done.
[2:14:29] And so the body god brother, he puts on
[2:14:33] a performance
[2:14:35] to impress,
[2:14:37] to win approval of the pastor and God.
[2:14:44] He feels unwanted, so he must win God's
[2:14:47] approval. He feels unwanted, so he must
[2:14:50] he must meet the yard stick of the
[2:14:53] standards they have in the church. He
[2:14:55] must change his values to be accepted.
[2:15:02] He never feels he has done enough, never
[2:15:05] feels appreciated.
[2:15:07] That love deficit makes him such that
[2:15:10] he's never satisfied. Not with himself,
[2:15:13] not with other people, not with his
[2:15:15] wife, not with his son, not with his
[2:15:16] daughter. He complains, complains,
[2:15:18] complains, find complains, complains,
[2:15:21] complains because that's what he's been
[2:15:23] given.
[2:15:28] The prodigal brother is only longing to
[2:15:30] hear
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; the voice of approval. Longing to hear
[2:15:35] well done,
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; well done.
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; How many times are you told that to your
[2:15:43] wife, to your children, even with all
[2:15:46] their wrongs? How many times you told
[2:15:48] that to the people in church
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; with all their wrongs?
[2:15:52] Well done, thou good and faithful
[2:15:56] servant.
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; The emphasis is not on ability. It's on
[2:16:00] faithfulness.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; Faithfulness.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; The prodigy god brothers longing to hear
[2:16:09] the words of approval. Longing to hear
[2:16:12] well done when all the while God has
[2:16:15] already approved of him.
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; Because of him. No. Because of Jesus, we
[2:16:19] have already been made accepted in the
[2:16:21] beloved.
[2:16:22] Because Jesus died and rose for your
[2:16:24] approval and acceptance in the beloved.
[2:16:27] You don't have to do one thing to be
[2:16:30] accepted by God. Just receive and accept
[2:16:32] his love. Hallelujah.
[2:16:36] Oh hallelujah.
[2:16:39] That's why the prodigal older brother
[2:16:41] could not understand why all the Mary
[2:16:44] meant when his brother came back.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; He couldn't understand it.
[2:16:49] He never understood once you are a son,
[2:16:52] you're always a son. He couldn't
[2:16:54] understand the mis destination.
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That God saved you and he
[2:16:59] sit on a rocking chair and he said leave
[2:17:01] however you want because he knows you
[2:17:04] will never want to do the wrong thing.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; And should you ever do any wrong thing,
[2:17:09] God knows quickly you are going to make
[2:17:12] it right. So you don't have to go with a
[2:17:13] chip on your shoulder with a wrong
[2:17:15] consciousness on you. You are free. You
[2:17:19] are free. You're no sinner. You are a
[2:17:22] son and a daughter of God. And that's
[2:17:24] why Jesus came. Oh, Jesus is here today
[2:17:28] to break that hold. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:17:33] Hallelujah.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus came to break this bondage and
[2:17:37] oppression that keeps you from a love
[2:17:39] affair with your father God. Oh,
[2:17:42] hallelujah. He's calling out your name.
[2:17:45] Can you hear him calling your name? Can
[2:17:47] you hear me say, "This is my beloved
[2:17:48] son. This is my beloved daughter in whom
[2:17:50] I am well pleased."
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, God's not angry with you. You are
[2:17:58] beloved son and daughter. If you have
[2:18:00] sinned, here is grace.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; Grace is coming down
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; to you from your father. Come home like
[2:18:09] the prodigal son. I will arise and go to
[2:18:12] my father. in my father's house is great
[2:18:14] love. Hallelujah.
[2:18:18] Oh, sin should never if you have sins
[2:18:21] and they are so messed up, it matters
[2:18:23] not. Sin should never keep you away from
[2:18:26] the loving embrace of your loving
[2:18:28] heavenly father. And our homes, our
[2:18:31] churches, our natural home should be a
[2:18:33] place of home where love built.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus is here this
[2:18:41] afternoon. He wants to break every
[2:18:43] spirit off of you today. He wants to
[2:18:45] kiss your heart Aresh. He wants to break
[2:18:48] the the the love deficit spirit off of
[2:18:50] you today even right now and replace
[2:18:52] that spirit of bondage with a spirit of
[2:18:55] spunship, the spirit of adoption whereby
[2:18:58] you cry, "Aba, Father."
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; If you in sin is your father's tail,
[2:19:05] reach out. He will set you free today
[2:19:07] and put a power in you to break every
[2:19:10] grip of sin in your life. Oh hallelujah.
[2:19:14] He wants to baptize you with the baptism
[2:19:16] of love which is the baptism of the Holy
[2:19:19] Ghost. the abstract that will go all the
[2:19:21] way back to uproot that system, that
[2:19:25] fear system in your life, that prodigal
[2:19:28] spirit in your relationship and service
[2:19:30] to God and replace it with a spirit of
[2:19:32] love,
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; the spirit of adoption whereby you cry,
[2:19:36] "Aba, Father,
[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; you won't be leaving no more seeking
[2:19:40] approval." Hallelujah. Neither will you
[2:19:43] be afraid of rejection ever again
[2:19:46] because you have come into an atmosphere
[2:19:47] of love. There's love all around here.
[2:19:50] There's love in our home. Love in our
[2:19:52] churches. Love in our lives.
[2:19:55] Oh, and we are moving up. We're moving
[2:19:56] up to where not even cancer will be able
[2:19:59] to stand. We're moving to where all of a
[2:20:02] sudden love will drop down and not one
[2:20:04] wrong will be in the assembly. Oh,
[2:20:07] hallelujah. Like William Branam, your
[2:20:10] life and ministry will be a daily walk
[2:20:12] in the love of God. Hallelujah. Brother
[2:20:16] Panam said 957 but I believe it's coming
[2:20:19] to a time Paul said whether prophecies
[2:20:21] it shall fail whether they strong they
[2:20:23] shall seize I believe it's coming to a
[2:20:26] time till when the saints will get
[2:20:27] together like this and just a lost
[2:20:29] spirit will just sweep over the audience
[2:20:31] and just every person in there all
[2:20:34] that's wrong will be taken out such a
[2:20:38] presence of the Holy Spirit hallelujah
[2:20:41] and when our church homes get to become
[2:20:44] that home that love built under this
[2:20:47] atmosphere of love. The Holy Spirit will
[2:20:50] inspire the ministers in a greater
[2:20:53] measure to preach and teach. That's the
[2:20:56] ministry of Jesus Christ to preach and
[2:20:58] teach. Hallelujah.
[2:21:00] To preach and teach the kingdom of
[2:21:01] heaven and the power of the cross of
[2:21:04] Jesus Christ with all boldness. Calling
[2:21:07] out devils. Calling the sinner to
[2:21:09] repentance. Calling out diseases.
[2:21:12] Hallelujah. Calling out those who are
[2:21:13] bound by sin.
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; Under this atmosphere of love, the
[2:21:19] mission will be hallelujah.
[2:21:21] Hallelujah.
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, pianist organist and finish. Play
[2:21:25] something softly. Glory. Play the love
[2:21:28] of God. How sweet and how measurless and
[2:21:31] strong. Oh hallelujah.
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; While they are playing softly. Amen.
[2:21:40] Brother Bam on Joy. He says, "So Lot
[2:21:44] went towards Sodom and then after
[2:21:46] Abraham was completely separated from
[2:21:48] all the parasites and the hangons, God
[2:21:50] appeared to him again." I like that God
[2:21:53] came to him and said, "Abraham, come and
[2:21:55] hear just a moment. I want to show you
[2:21:56] something." Genesis 15 is talking about
[2:21:59] he said, "Lift up your eyes. Look to the
[2:22:01] north just as far as you can see, to the
[2:22:03] south, the east, and the west. I've
[2:22:06] given it all to you. So walk through the
[2:22:08] land. You are the possessor of it all.
[2:22:10] is all yours. No wonder David cried,
[2:22:13] "Forget not all his benefits."
[2:22:16] Why? You know, after you come into the
[2:22:19] kingdom of God, there's a lot of benefit
[2:22:22] goes with it. When God calls you, knocks
[2:22:25] out your heart, separates you from the
[2:22:27] things of the world, and gives you a
[2:22:28] little child training to see if you're
[2:22:30] going to hold out or not, gives you a
[2:22:32] little scolding, checks you around, get
[2:22:35] a little chastisement. All of you, all
[2:22:38] of you get it. If you are really
[2:22:40] children of God, you get a little
[2:22:41] training. Then God baptizes you into the
[2:22:44] fellowship of the kingdom and it's all
[2:22:46] yours. Then Abraham, the trials are over
[2:22:49] now. Get out and walk around. It all
[2:22:52] belongs to you. What a beautiful picture
[2:22:54] of the overcomer. The overcomer is heir
[2:22:57] of all things. I don't see what's the
[2:22:59] matter with you as Christians that you
[2:23:01] don't walk around a little while. See
[2:23:03] what you own. If I fell heir to a house,
[2:23:07] I should wouldn't want to move into it
[2:23:09] till I got in, looked everything over. I
[2:23:12] want to see what's mine. I want to see
[2:23:14] what I own. And when I fell air to the
[2:23:16] kingdom of God through the righteousness
[2:23:18] of Jesus Christ, baptized into this
[2:23:21] great archet of God's eternal blessings,
[2:23:23] I'd like to walk around, see what's
[2:23:26] mine, look on the shelves, see what's
[2:23:29] the promise there. Here it is. Every
[2:23:32] promise in the book belongs to every
[2:23:34] believer. Don't you stand still for
[2:23:36] somebody to push off in a corner, give
[2:23:39] you a little call later and tell you to
[2:23:42] wait. Don't you listen to that stuff.
[2:23:45] God's promise is right now. Push you off
[2:23:48] in a millennium somewhere. The Bible
[2:23:49] said now we are the sons of God. What we
[2:23:52] will be, we are now present tense. If
[2:23:56] anything that looks a little high and a
[2:23:58] blessing that looks like why it'll get
[2:24:00] me a step ladder, I'll get me a step
[2:24:02] ladder and move up and look at it
[2:24:04] anyhow. I look I like to look around.
[2:24:07] It's all yours. And every promise in the
[2:24:10] Bible is yours. When a Christian gets
[2:24:13] saved, God gives him a checkbook with
[2:24:16] the bottom of it with Jesus name signed
[2:24:19] in blood. Every redemptive blessing
[2:24:22] belongs to the believer. fill it out and
[2:24:26] send it to headquarters. Watch what
[2:24:29] happens. He's obligated to take care of
[2:24:31] his word. I challenge any sick person. I
[2:24:35] challenge any sinner here tonight to
[2:24:38] sign your name or your wants above a
[2:24:41] check in Jesus' name and send it into
[2:24:44] heaven once. Don't doubt the cashier is
[2:24:48] right there because the papy was put
[2:24:51] there at Calvary through the blood of
[2:24:54] the Lord Jesus Christ. Oh hallelujah.
[2:24:58] Hallelujah.
[2:25:00] Oh my. Let's go forward. If you only
[2:25:03] preach to the church justification,
[2:25:05] let's take them a little further than
[2:25:07] what we got now. Go a little higher. If
[2:25:10] it get into that, God begins to fill it
[2:25:12] with the Holy Ghost. Then let's go to
[2:25:14] divine healing and shack that out. Well,
[2:25:18] the Holy Ghost just like a great big
[2:25:20] apartment above. The people that's
[2:25:22] become Christians don't know what they
[2:25:24] own. Could you imagine me buying a house
[2:25:28] without looking all over it first? Could
[2:25:30] you imagine me owing a place like
[2:25:32] somebody gave me a big arage, big place
[2:25:35] with everything just everywhere? It's
[2:25:37] all mine. Well, that's the way it is
[2:25:39] when you come to Christ. Everything
[2:25:40] belongs to you. All the redemptive
[2:25:42] blessings that Christ died for is yours.
[2:25:45] Every believer has possession of every
[2:25:47] redemptive blessing. Amen. Is given to
[2:25:50] the believer by one spirit. We are all
[2:25:53] baptized to this great big Jesus Christ.
[2:25:56] My up on this here justation by faith.
[2:25:59] Over here is translation through the
[2:26:01] blood. Up there is joy. Here's peace.
[2:26:04] There's longsuffering, goodness,
[2:26:06] gentleness. my everything. Some of them
[2:26:09] may be hanging a little high. I can't
[2:26:11] get to them, but they got a step ladder
[2:26:14] over in the corner. Let's get up. Let's
[2:26:17] look at it. Let's see what it looks
[2:26:19] like. If they can reach up to divine
[2:26:21] healing, take God step ladder. Reach out
[2:26:25] and find out where it's all belongs to
[2:26:27] you. That's what the church ought to be
[2:26:29] doing. The church ought to be moving up
[2:26:31] the road. And I say as I close here,
[2:26:33] let's move up the road, church. Every
[2:26:35] blessing belongs to us. Let's just come
[2:26:38] and let not just come out of the world.
[2:26:40] Let's run into Christ. Let's run into
[2:26:42] our father's blessings. Let's run into
[2:26:44] our father's love. Our father's love has
[2:26:48] provided every redemptive blessing for
[2:26:50] us. Hallelujah. And they all yours. God
[2:26:54] bless you. Let's go out of here. Out of
[2:26:57] this great convention.
[2:27:00] Come and rejoice with us. That lost one
[2:27:02] that you have found. Take it back home.
[2:27:05] Take it back to your f family. Take it
[2:27:07] back to your husband. Take it back to
[2:27:08] your wife. Take it back to your
[2:27:10] children. Take it back to your church.
[2:27:12] Take it back to the people. And let's
[2:27:14] make our judges. Let's make our homes
[2:27:16] the home the judge home that love build.
[2:27:21] God richly bless you.

[2:36:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Let's first get ready to
[2:36:26] bring a ting offering. Know a lot of
[2:36:28] things he said came across like a
[2:36:30] leadership address. Came across almost
[2:36:33] like as a pastoral address. But really,
[2:36:36] each and every one of us
[2:36:37] &gt;&gt; could take what was said this morning
[2:36:40] &gt;&gt; and apply it in our daily lives
[2:36:42] &gt;&gt; and build the kind of home that we want
[2:36:44] to live in.
[2:36:46] &gt;&gt; We could determine what that atmosphere
[2:36:48] is.
[2:36:49] When we really truly do things the Bible
[2:36:52] said to do,
[2:36:53] &gt;&gt; love our neighbor as ourselves,
[2:36:56] all these other things. And then healing
[2:36:59] and deliverance comes as a result of the
[2:37:02] seeds we've sown, of the lives we've
[2:37:05] lived and the love that we project.
[2:37:09] &gt;&gt; It's a really powerful powerful thing
[2:37:11] today. So as we think on these thoughts,
[2:37:15] let's bow our heads as we ask God's
[2:37:17] blessing upon the ts offering. I'm so
[2:37:20] glad that Jesus set me free. We'll say
[2:37:22] that afterwards. Heavenly Father, Lord,
[2:37:24] we thank you for your grace and your
[2:37:25] mercy upon our lives. Lord, we thank you
[2:37:28] for your word that has come in this
[2:37:29] hour,
[2:37:31] rightly divided, Lord, to show us how to
[2:37:34] walk in Jesus name. We are grateful
[2:37:37] today with grateful hearts. We bring
[2:37:40] them to your house, Lord. Tithesi and
[2:37:41] offerings, we pray your blessing. Use it
[2:37:43] for the furtherance of your gospel. Use
[2:37:46] it for the furtherance of your kingdom.
[2:37:48] Bless your people as they give. May you
[2:37:49] provide for them and open doors for
[2:37:51] them, Father.
[2:37:53] Lord and uh pour out of the abundance of
[2:37:55] your own blessing, Lord, according to
[2:37:56] the offerings of our heart today. We
[2:37:59] pray you bless your people today. We
[2:38:01] pray you bless it as they pick it up in
[2:38:02] Jesus name. Pray and asking. Amen and
[2:38:05] amen. Amen. I'm so glad that Jesus set
[2:38:07] me free. Amen. You feel free today?
[2:38:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, love lifted you this morning. Love
[2:38:13] sets us free. I'm so glad. Oh, that
[2:38:16] Jesus set me free. Oh, and I'm so glad.
[2:38:21] Oh, that Jesus set me free. Yes, I'm so
[2:38:25] glad. Oh, that Jesus set me free. Sing
[2:38:30] glory hallelujah.
[2:38:32] Oh, Jesus set me free. Oh, sing.

[2:45:20] Bound his hand
[2:45:26] for me.
[2:45:32] Oh, give him praise today.
[2:45:35] Oh, hallelujah. I will never cease to

[2:45:57] playing softly. Amen.
[2:46:00] &gt;&gt; We just have one prayer request here.
[2:46:02] Then we pray to close out. We feel the
[2:46:04] presence of God.
[2:46:07] We feel we have the confidence to bring
[2:46:08] this request before the Lord.
[2:46:12] As brother old said today, it is God
[2:46:14] that heals.
[2:46:16] But
[2:46:16] &gt;&gt; it's our faith in God
[2:46:19] &gt;&gt; and the healing comes from him.
[2:46:22] &gt;&gt; So we approach the throne of grace.
[2:46:25] &gt;&gt; This prayer request says, "Good morning,
[2:46:27] saints. Requesting prayer for Myon
[2:46:30] Sagram uh for medical condition at Mount
