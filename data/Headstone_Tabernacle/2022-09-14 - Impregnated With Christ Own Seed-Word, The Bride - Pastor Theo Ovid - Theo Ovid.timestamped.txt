[30:31] the immense announcement so if you have
[30:33] your bibles i'd like you to turn to
[30:35] three ports of scripture tonight
[30:38] god bless you brothers musicians
[30:39] certainly appreciate all of you out here
[30:40] tonight
[30:42] uh luke chapter eight we wanna read from
[30:43] verse four to fifteen
[30:46] luke chapter 17 we want to read from 26
[30:48] to 30. and matthew 13
[30:52] only read one verse there
[30:54] verse 37
[30:57] praise the lord
[31:00] reading from
[31:01] luke 8
[31:02] jesus speaks and when much people were
[31:05] gathered together and will come to him
[31:07] out of every city he speak by a parable
[31:10] a soul went out to sow his seed as he
[31:13] sold some fell by the wayside it was
[31:14] trotted down the falls of the egg
[31:16] devoured it some fell up on a rock
[31:19] soon as sprung up it withered away
[31:21] because it lacked moisture some fell
[31:23] among torns and the torn sprung up and
[31:25] bit it and choked it others fell on good
[31:28] ground sprung up and bear fruit a
[31:30] hundredfold and when he had said these
[31:33] things he cried
[31:34] he done ears to hear
[31:36] let him hear
[31:38] and his disciples asked him saying what
[31:40] might this problem be he said
[31:42] he said unto you it is given to know the
[31:44] mysteries of the kingdom of god but unto
[31:47] the others in parables that seeing they
[31:50] might not see and hearing
[31:53] they might not understand now the
[31:54] parable is this
[31:56] the seed is the word of god
[31:58] those by the way sign are they that hear
[32:01] then commit the devil and take it away
[32:03] the word out of their hearts at least
[32:05] they should believe and be saved
[32:08] then day on the rock a day which when
[32:10] they hear
[32:11] receive the word with joy
[32:13] but these have no root
[32:15] which for a while believe
[32:17] the time of temptation fall away
[32:19] and that which fell among tones are they
[32:21] which when they have heard go forth and
[32:24] are choked with cares and riches and
[32:27] pleasures of this life and bring no
[32:30] fruit to perfection note those words
[32:32] don't bring no fruit to perfection
[32:35] 15 but
[32:37] but that on good ground are they which
[32:39] in an honest and good heart having heard
[32:41] the word
[32:42] keep it
[32:43] and bring forth fruit
[32:45] with patience
[32:47] okay and we've switched to luke 17
[32:50] reading from verse 26 and as it was in
[32:52] the days of noah so shall it also be in
[32:54] the days of the son of man
[32:57] they did eat they drank they married
[33:00] wives they were given in marriage until
[33:02] the day that noah entered into the ark
[33:04] and the flood came and destroyed them
[33:07] all likewise also i was in the of a lot
[33:09] days of luck they did eat they drank
[33:12] they bought they sold
[33:13] they planted
[33:15] they build it but the same day that lot
[33:17] went under sodom it rained fire and
[33:19] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them
[33:21] all even thus shall it be in the day
[33:24] when the son of man is revealed or final
[33:27] scriptures from matthew chapter 13 verse
[33:29] 37
[33:30] he answered and said unto them he that
[33:33] soweth the good seed
[33:34] is the son of man heavenly father we
[33:36] thank you bless your word and interpret
[33:38] your hearts tonight in jesus name i ask
[33:40] it amen you may be seated praise god god
[33:43] bless you and welcome
[33:45] so tonight our title
[33:47] impregnated with christ's own seed the
[33:50] bride
[33:52] that's the title tonight impregnated
[33:54] with christ's
[33:56] own
[33:57] seed
[33:58] the bride
[33:59] and the seed
[34:01] is the bible oh let's go let's see what
[34:03] the lord will do for us tonight
[34:05] he said no national force
[34:07] he said like israel back in the promised
[34:09] land she don't know how she got back
[34:10] there she was just automatically put
[34:12] back there why
[34:14] national force put her in a place we
[34:17] know the
[34:18] the six million jews were killed that
[34:21] drove them back to the promised land to
[34:23] hitler and eichmann and stalin and all
[34:25] these guys anointed with heavy spirits
[34:27] upon them is not right a force did that
[34:30] now i'm going to say something national
[34:32] force but israel in a homeland
[34:34] national force will pull the church in
[34:36] the work of the churches so it will be a
[34:38] forcing but the power of god will put
[34:41] the people in the bride
[34:43] no man can no pastor apostle prophet
[34:46] evangelist man could put the people in
[34:48] the bride the only thing that could put
[34:50] the people in the bride is the power of
[34:52] god now you have to believe this
[34:55] just as it is spoken
[34:56] no pastor man
[34:58] evangelist man teacher man prophet man
[35:00] apostle man putting anybody in the bride
[35:03] you could shake those people's hands but
[35:04] they can't put you in the brain it will
[35:06] take the power of god
[35:08] that power of man
[35:09] power of god and the power of god man
[35:11] don't control that
[35:13] are you with me tonight
[35:15] man don't control the power of god
[35:17] the power of god will put you in the
[35:18] bride isn't that right all right let's
[35:20] go watch the power of god will put the
[35:22] people in the bride the world forces
[35:24] this way and the world forces that way
[35:25] but god forces upward the spirit of god
[35:30] which is the word of god i like how it
[35:33] is placed
[35:34] so he's not just saying the word he's in
[35:35] the spirit and what spirit is that which
[35:37] is the word
[35:38] because he said my words are spirit and
[35:40] life so the spirit of god which is the
[35:42] word of god my word in spirit and life
[35:44] will put the bride in her place
[35:47] because she will recognize her position
[35:50] in the word then she's in christ
[35:52] will put her in her place no national
[35:56] force will do it but the national force
[35:58] will drive eligible homeland national
[36:00] force work on the churches would drive
[36:02] every organization into it but the power
[36:05] of god will raise the bright into glory
[36:09] oh blessed be the name of the lord now
[36:12] he promised to send you heavenly light
[36:15] to write in the word seed that would be
[36:17] sown for this day
[36:19] or
[36:20] you mean a seed have to be sown for this
[36:22] day
[36:23] exactly right
[36:24] and the seed is here
[36:27] i'm reading the seed is the bible
[36:30] so you see why the devil don't want
[36:31] people to connect with the bible because
[36:33] the seed is the bible once you said that
[36:35] connect with the word the devil in
[36:36] trouble
[36:37] because the word have the power in it
[36:39] the seed is the bible why jesus said so
[36:42] the word is the seed that the sower
[36:44] sowed
[36:45] now here we go before you can have any
[36:48] crop no matter if you sow the seed it's
[36:50] got to have light to righten the seed or
[36:53] it will rot and won't do no good
[36:56] it will perish and if it's got seed
[36:59] in the ground the right ground with the
[37:01] right kind of sunlight it's got to ripen
[37:03] and he promised in the last days in the
[37:05] evening time the sun would come out to
[37:09] ripen that seed
[37:10] the seed is being preached
[37:13] so if you miss the preaching you miss
[37:14] the seed
[37:15] so the revelation is defined what seeds
[37:18] to sow
[37:19] so we are not here to preach tribulation
[37:20] to you that's not weird that's not your
[37:22] destination we are here to preach bridal
[37:24] promises to you because the rapture is
[37:26] your destination
[37:28] you want somebody saying you know the
[37:30] seed is preached
[37:35] the son of god
[37:37] is ripening that seed
[37:39] by vindicating it and making it push out
[37:42] before you proven it's right do you get
[37:44] it
[37:46] so who is the soul of the seed
[37:48] the son of man but who ripens the seed
[37:51] son of god oh give the lord some praises
[37:54] praise god so the son of man is the
[37:56] sower of the seed but the righteous of
[37:59] the seed is the son of god
[38:01] which is holy spirit
[38:02] he just whitened the seed oh glory to
[38:05] god said jessica have son of man alone
[38:06] you have to have son of god too which is
[38:08] the holy spirit to ripen the seed that
[38:10] son of man show
[38:12] or give the lord some praises hallelujah
[38:14] praise god amen
[38:15] now jesus is the word of god and he was
[38:18] bursted open that life the life is the
[38:21] inside of the seed and this life here we
[38:24] go which is spirit
[38:26] water flowing over the spirit over the
[38:29] seed of god will bring forth the life of
[38:31] the seed
[38:32] oh here the purpose jesus died so this
[38:35] bring a higher revelation than jesus pay
[38:37] the price for me and by his cross i'm
[38:39] safe and so on listen to this and it
[38:41] brings forth something else what do you
[38:43] understand if the spirit of god
[38:46] comes forth to water the seed if it's
[38:50] the seed it's watering it will produce
[38:52] the life of the seed now i believe the
[38:55] bible is the word the whole truth
[38:57] and jesus is the word
[38:59] made manifest
[39:00] he and his word is one and the same
[39:04] now he was the seed
[39:06] that eve should have produced
[39:10] it's a big one
[39:12] jesus was the seed that eve was supposed
[39:15] to produce you get it he was the sea
[39:18] that he was to produce but she hybrid it
[39:20] by disbelieving god's word
[39:22] so he was the seed and the only way that
[39:25] life could be reproduction in life
[39:28] have to come through that seed that seed
[39:31] had to die here we go
[39:33] in order to spread out the life
[39:37] that's why the water was given to water
[39:39] the seed the holy spirit was in the
[39:42] garden of eden was the water the seed
[39:44] man wasn't made to die
[39:47] he was made to live but high breeding
[39:50] brought debt she hybrided he said
[39:52] there's a germ of life come from the
[39:54] real seed of god prove it was a seed
[39:57] that through that life that was going
[39:59] the original seed was given to eve his
[40:02] real church is bringing forth life again
[40:05] through the birth to the womb of his
[40:06] bride oh glory to god hallelujah so the
[40:10] bride will have living waters and
[40:12] through the bride praise god through
[40:14] monk zion oh glory to god bring forth
[40:17] life again another eve a second evil a
[40:21] second woman to reproduce the original
[40:23] grain the original life oh glory to god
[40:26] hallelujah praise god do you believe
[40:29] that
[40:30] oh glory to god says rich and glorious
[40:32] watch this now he is that seed that was
[40:35] produced by the word of god
[40:38] now jesus is the word we manifest
[40:41] he and the word is one and the same
[40:43] and why it was made manifest in him so
[40:46] perfectly and that's the reason that god
[40:49] manifested himself so perfectly in jesus
[40:52] because he was the seed wood
[40:55] he was what
[40:57] salted again seed word
[40:59] or he said the germ word itself
[41:03] he was the germ that was inside the seed
[41:07] that's the life of the seed
[41:09] hallelujah get it
[41:11] and the germ word of god the germ is the
[41:14] spirit
[41:15] i'm still reading the germ is the water
[41:18] so he was the spirit water word seed
[41:21] word
[41:22] original word
[41:23] if the devil only knew who jesus was
[41:26] oh god because through that seed word
[41:28] that water going to be released is how
[41:30] we are here tonight
[41:32] because the water release is what the
[41:34] spirit is released to find you
[41:37] it's hell on the earth there is no way
[41:39] you could escape these demons there is
[41:41] no way you could escape hell on the
[41:42] earth except a third pearl except a
[41:45] spirit of god come and bust you the
[41:48] demons bust you there the prince of the
[41:51] power of the air bust you all those
[41:53] dimensions define you praise god that's
[41:55] the only way you and yourself cannot
[41:58] pull yourself up
[41:59] a power have to release
[42:01] oh glory to god when hell came on the
[42:03] earth heaven came down god sent seven
[42:06] angels from eternity to bring heaven
[42:09] down on the earth that's why he sent
[42:11] this message this is a glorious message
[42:14] oh glory to god angels looking into this
[42:17] oh hallelujah therefore you have to be a
[42:19] glorious people you have to be kings and
[42:21] priests that god has elected elected
[42:24] call out
[42:27] hallelujah
[42:29] i think this word reading again he was
[42:31] the seed word
[42:32] the germ wood
[42:34] the germ that was inside the seed that's
[42:37] the life in the seed
[42:39] so jesus and that's why the bible says
[42:41] the virgin shall conceive god is very
[42:42] specific and detailed to identify this
[42:45] man that is coming is not born of a
[42:46] woman here born by sex he born by spoken
[42:49] word
[42:50] mary said be it done unto me according
[42:52] to thy word she received the word and
[42:54] then you're going to find out what mary
[42:55] did oh glory to god without any evidence
[42:58] of pregnancy without any evidence and
[43:00] any sign anything like that she could
[43:01] say i'm gonna have a baby oh glory to
[43:03] god because he asked one question how

[48:34] obeying the word husband love your wife
[48:36] that's the word wife listen to your
[48:38] husband respect your husband reference
[48:40] your husband that is the word you can't
[48:41] get a dream above that i can't get a
[48:44] revelation about that that is just a
[48:45] word
[48:46] oh glory to god children obey your
[48:48] parents that is the word you can't get
[48:50] no revelation above that
[48:52] that is just a word
[48:53] oh glory give the lord some praises
[48:56] you may be seated
[49:04] now watch
[49:05] the works all right
[49:07] god's son
[49:08] which is jesus
[49:09] was his example seed
[49:12] what his life was when the spirit pulled
[49:13] upon him after his baptism the holy
[49:16] ghost come upon him
[49:17] ouch
[49:19] you mean jesus didn't take it by fit
[49:22] you mean something come upon him
[49:23] you mean generally saw it
[49:25] you mean god tell john the one upon whom
[49:28] that dove come down
[49:30] and re-mean it because sometimes he does
[49:32] come and move away you know when he does
[49:34] land and recognizes the wolf this is the
[49:35] gun
[49:36] you know what the one that the dove land
[49:38] and remain that's the one you know i see
[49:41] duff hitting people and okay i think but
[49:42] afterwards stay in but when john see
[49:44] that one come on jesus and let him move
[49:47] he said behold the lamb of god
[49:49] he could identify the messiah because
[49:52] god told him what to look for
[49:54] isn't that right
[49:55] all right so they forgot son was his
[49:57] example seed and what his life was when
[49:59] the spirit poured upon him after his
[50:00] baptism the holy ghost come upon him
[50:03] and the very life that he produced well
[50:07] that same
[50:08] watering spirit of the holy ghost
[50:11] will bring forth the same kind of life
[50:14] doing the same thing that he did
[50:17] if there's
[50:19] if it's the same seed
[50:22] son of god seed will bring forth son of
[50:25] god's seed
[50:26] if
[50:27] it's
[50:28] the same seed
[50:30] now the spoken word is
[50:33] the original seed
[50:34] spoken by who
[50:36] by god
[50:37] and god's more beat is
[50:39] his prophets so the word coming out the
[50:42] mouth of the prophet is the original
[50:43] seed
[50:45] and the bride will be impregnated
[50:48] by god's own seed
[50:50] which is from the mouth of the prophet
[50:53] that's why he says say what the tapes
[50:54] say
[50:55] because them tapes those words are seeds
[50:59] the seed is the word of god
[51:01] the sower is the son of man
[51:03] and we are promised that day the son of
[51:05] man will be revealed that means the son
[51:07] of man coming his last day to bring
[51:08] seeds
[51:09] now when the son of man coming back he
[51:11] doesn't come out for seeds
[51:12] when somebody plant corn they conversely
[51:14] corn green they come in and see the
[51:16] process go through and they see a whole
[51:18] air of corn you're planting one seed but
[51:21] you're expecting a whole air
[51:23] some fifty fold some sixty fold some a
[51:26] hundred full but all have to bring forth
[51:30] or give the lord a shout
[51:32] hallelujah and this was the great
[51:35] parable that jesus teach as a foundation
[51:38] for all of the parables you have to
[51:40] understand
[51:41] the parable of the sower
[51:43] and the seed
[51:45] okay let's go
[51:46] now
[51:51] the gate to the soul
[51:54] remember there's a womb of the physical
[51:57] and there's a womb for the spirit
[51:59] there's a spiritual womb
[52:02] and there's a physical womb
[52:04] now the mind
[52:06] is the womb
[52:08] to the spirit
[52:11] just as a woman has a womb
[52:14] a mind is a womb
[52:16] justice there's a physical womb
[52:18] there's a spiritual wound
[52:20] now how is adultery
[52:22] that's how adultery is committed
[52:24] spiritually
[52:26] when you know better by the word of god
[52:29] by the intercourse of the mind taking a
[52:31] lie of the devil
[52:33] against the word of god
[52:35] that's adultery
[52:39] jesus said that every man would be a lie
[52:42] and minds be true
[52:43] now that's exactly what eve done
[52:45] with spiritual intercourse first
[52:48] that comes by believing satan's lie
[52:51] into the womb of a mind
[52:52] that polluted her soul
[52:55] set death in the soul then the natural
[52:57] act take place
[52:58] so first is a mind thing
[53:00] let's continue and that's the only way a
[53:03] woman can ever commit adultery against a
[53:04] husband is to let some man talk into it
[53:08] then receive another man that's not a
[53:10] husband then she comes with adultery
[53:12] and when the bride of jesus christ lets
[53:15] man-made creeds
[53:17] and dogmas take the place of the word of
[53:20] god she is committing adultery
[53:22] no rapture for that
[53:24] i call them tribulation saints
[53:27] oh glory to god do you understand what
[53:28] i'm saying it have no rapture with false
[53:31] teaching and false doctrine that is
[53:33] adultery
[53:34] that's adultery because you can't find
[53:36] that in the word you can't find another
[53:38] message man invent that
[53:40] because that's easy for people to
[53:41] believe because man invent that he
[53:43] dreamed that something hit him some
[53:45] things strike him but he's not in the
[53:46] world paul saver angel come from heaven
[53:49] and preach any other gospel let him be a
[53:52] curse we have a plum line to measure
[53:54] everything with or give the lord a shout
[53:57] nobody's supposed to pull wool over my
[53:59] eye
[54:00] praise god hallelujah you had to be a
[54:01] blind like a bat for somebody to pull
[54:03] all over your eye god sent ice alvin
[54:05] this last day that you could see clearly
[54:08] oh glory to god hallelujah god sent isil
[54:12] that you might see
[54:13] that your way wouldn't be stumbling and
[54:15] fumbling
[54:16] oh glory to god let me let's go
[54:19] i want the bride of jesus christ let man
[54:21] made trees and dogmas take that's why i
[54:23] don't i don't play with that you know as
[54:25] soon as there's something false it's
[54:26] sure you know
[54:28] what what if it could be right how many
[54:29] could be right
[54:30] here
[54:31] there's a lot could be waiting so
[54:33] somebody said be careful what you see
[54:35] you know
[54:36] not pretty but not before doctrine and
[54:37] teaching
[54:38] is chopped
[54:40] it's wood
[54:42] yes rolled over like a rolling pin
[54:45] like a steam roll over that that is dead
[54:48] like the same devil that come in the
[54:49] garden eating
[54:50] god wasn't talking to the serpent
[54:52] said what is he what what uh
[54:54] he what did god say she said god say we
[54:55] eat on the tree but and she missed don't
[54:58] touch it because the day
[54:59] that did you die no she said exactly
[55:01] what god said
[55:03] she didn't know it herself adam told her
[55:06] because the god told adam
[55:08] all those words that he could teach eve
[55:11] so eve was getting from adam
[55:13] and the serpent had no voice god wasn't
[55:14] speaking to him so he needed to
[55:16] understand what was the word that they
[55:18] had
[55:19] what for not to be edified
[55:21] what for to twist it
[55:23] and those anointed with satanic and
[55:25] fallen angel spirits all they're doing
[55:27] is twisting things they can't help it
[55:29] because the devil up there told a lie
[55:33] and caused angels to follow him and they
[55:36] were kicked out on the earth and that's
[55:37] how the battle of angel became the
[55:39] battle of men but we're fighting right
[55:40] back because we understand the battle
[55:43] glory the god i ain't taking that show
[55:46] praise god ain't gonna take licks lying
[55:47] down i'll go fight back
[55:49] everything i have anything i have gonna
[55:51] fight back i come tonight to fight right
[55:53] back
[55:54] oh glory to god but my womb is already
[55:56] closed
[55:58] praise god i am impregnated by christ's
[56:00] own seed word or give the lord a shout
[56:04] no man interpretation can get inside of
[56:06] here no man's idea could get inside the
[56:08] deal my womb is closed that's why i go
[56:11] pumbaa just the word
[56:12] oh give the lord a shout in the house oh
[56:16] hallelujah
[56:17] i hope your home is closed too
[56:20] all right let's go
[56:22] here we go
[56:23] did not jesus say whosoever looked upon
[56:25] a woman
[56:26] had committed adultery with her already
[56:27] in his heart
[56:30] what
[56:31] let it come into his mind
[56:34] so that's why jesus promote this whole
[56:35] thing with adultery not just physical
[56:36] touching anybody
[56:38] just the lust
[56:39] it already commits in this mind
[56:41] what
[56:42] i mean
[56:44] she doesn't come in the line that's the
[56:45] womb that stand the thing that started
[56:48] things moving sit and come in
[56:50] well now we were sold with the word
[56:53] what he failed to do mary did
[56:55] she took the word eve took satan's lie
[56:58] mary talks god's word
[57:00] and mary's seed replenishes the earth
[57:03] again
[57:04] through his bride through the world and
[57:06] will bring up the millennium what did
[57:07] mary said be it done unto me according
[57:09] to your word and she hit satan at slap
[57:12] she just take the wood and she's had to
[57:14] act on it
[57:15] isn't that right now watch something
[57:18] okay
[57:20] though that goes for the word
[57:22] and the word is planted into every
[57:24] predestinated heart and the spirit comes
[57:26] out and watered and they cannot die i'll
[57:28] raise him up at the last day he said
[57:30] brother sister that is real
[57:32] what is it
[57:33] the mind is the womb
[57:36] for the spirit
[57:37] to take in or let out
[57:40] that is how they commit adultery is by
[57:43] taking or let satan
[57:45] devil spirit put in something against
[57:48] the word of god
[57:50] then she commits adultery
[57:52] now watch look eve what did she do
[57:55] she received here we go the wrong seed
[58:00] how did she do it believe in satan's
[58:03] life
[58:04] and brother branham said this way you
[58:06] cannot accept the devil's line until you
[58:08] reject god's truth
[58:12] so rejection of truth set up people to
[58:14] receive lies
[58:19] you see all this world there's so much
[58:20] conspiracy theories
[58:22] people are believing all kind of madness
[58:24] and listen we could see them looking
[58:26] like it might bend them when they were
[58:28] it's real
[58:32] they're under strong delusion
[58:34] and people come in this message coming
[58:35] on a strong delusion to believe a lie
[58:38] and be done by it
[58:40] that's the devil in them
[58:41] praise god hallelujah
[58:43] all right
[58:44] she received satan lie what did she
[58:46] bring forth by doing it satan said you
[58:48] know this is glorious this is a
[58:50] wonderful thing do you know that you
[58:52] were made for that why you were actually
[58:53] made for this purpose who was i was
[58:56] present to the eyes good you should you
[58:58] should try it but the lord god said not
[59:00] yet wait a minute but you know you shall
[59:03] not surely die
[59:04] that's slick tongue devil he ain't got
[59:06] hoofs and folktale no they try to make
[59:09] you believe that he's a slicker behind a
[59:11] pulpit
[59:13] same devil
[59:14] but this time wearing jacket and tie
[59:16] that is incredulous no no red tail and
[59:18] pitchfork and thing like that you know
[59:20] well she could belong to a big church
[59:22] she could well told in the city that's
[59:24] exactly what satan would try to see with
[59:26] the when it would have got come to mary
[59:27] but she shook him away how can this be
[59:29] the holy ghost will overshadow you it's
[59:31] the word of god be it done unto me
[59:34] according to thy word
[59:35] that brought the life there you are
[59:37] praise god what do you know satan said
[59:39] they would laugh at you that little
[59:41] rosie chick gill didn't pay any
[59:42] attention to that right up to julia she
[59:45] went you know i'm going to have a baby
[59:47] before she felt anything because the
[59:49] word has already been set there she
[59:51] didn't have to go through a prayer line
[59:53] a second time she believed she didn't
[59:55] have any sign of life she never
[59:57] understand her pregnancy she never felt
[59:59] nothing she just said god said so
[1:00:02] oh glory to god and that's how i want
[1:00:04] you to become whatever the words say i
[1:00:06] believe it i receive it i'm going to act
[1:00:08] upon it god said it oh glory to god if
[1:00:11] your little finger move your whole hand
[1:00:12] stiff and if your little finger moved at
[1:00:14] night god is able to move your next
[1:00:16] finger on your next finger and your
[1:00:17] whole hand and your whole situation
[1:00:19] could be changed tonight
[1:00:21] oh glory to god hallelujah she said god
[1:00:24] said i'm gonna have a baby why god said
[1:00:26] so what's that the royal seed of abraham
[1:00:28] so the royal seat of abraham said god
[1:00:30] said so devil's a liar i don't care what
[1:00:32] the doctors say i believe what god said
[1:00:34] oh glory to god god said so abraham what
[1:00:37] do you say 25 years ago but god said so
[1:00:39] there you are hallelujah praise god
[1:00:43] so to both physical and spiritual but
[1:00:44] eve and anytime
[1:00:47] and any time a woman takes a wrong step
[1:00:49] she has to fully receive it in her mind
[1:00:52] some slicker has to persuade her
[1:00:54] and she listened to it against her own
[1:00:56] better judgment than the actors
[1:00:58] committed so first
[1:01:00] satan hit eve mine
[1:01:04] and in the womb of a mind she doubted
[1:01:06] god's word
[1:01:08] so what satan introduced is a question
[1:01:11] and anytime you start with question on
[1:01:12] god's word you're on your way out
[1:01:18] there must be no question
[1:01:21] on god's word
[1:01:24] so first satan hit eat mine
[1:01:27] and in the womb of her mind she doubted
[1:01:28] god's word then come the actual act
[1:01:31] and here he's flipping it over now
[1:01:33] and the only way that we could ever be
[1:01:35] born again
[1:01:36] is first in the womb of the mind
[1:01:39] so your mind have to get a
[1:01:40] transformation
[1:01:43] like how esther owned
[1:01:45] and i said question with me how esther
[1:01:47] got this transformation
[1:01:49] when when mordecai sent a message to him
[1:01:51] tell her you think you sit in the palace
[1:01:53] day
[1:01:54] that you will be safe
[1:01:56] you better wake up you know
[1:01:58] if you figure things are not coming to
[1:02:00] you
[1:02:01] then health have to come from somewhere
[1:02:02] else
[1:02:03] how do you not know that you are there

[1:02:10] all the time esther just staying there
[1:02:12] queenness are just sitting there normal
[1:02:13] normal normal and the people about to
[1:02:15] get killed
[1:02:17] she got a wake-up call
[1:02:19] that she had to reframe her thinking
[1:02:21] as to what she's doing there
[1:02:24] and you better get a wake-up call
[1:02:25] tonight
[1:02:26] to reshape your thinking

[1:02:32] you're in the service for reframe how
[1:02:35] you're thinking

[1:02:41] you may be seated
[1:02:43] and because her thinking was reframed
[1:02:46] a readjustment and she knew you cannot
[1:02:49] go in the prison of king accepted being
[1:02:50] called she said if i perish
[1:02:53] that's an anchor point you know as a
[1:02:55] punchy cowboy back on you know if i
[1:02:57] perish i perish i go into the presence
[1:03:00] of the king

[1:06:23] that won't mix with any denominational
[1:06:25] trash with it
[1:06:26] she's a virgin to him
[1:06:28] isn't that right
[1:06:30] it's not something else christ's own
[1:06:32] seed
[1:06:33] in you
[1:06:35] it have more coming
[1:06:36] jesus said he that receiveth them
[1:06:39] who i send receives me
[1:06:41] i know them that he sends and then that
[1:06:43] receives me
[1:06:44] receive him that sent me
[1:06:47] you can only serve god
[1:06:49] as you can serve god as you do and
[1:06:51] believe
[1:06:52] the servants that god sends
[1:06:55] you can only serve god and eat
[1:06:57] as god's servants that sent on earth by
[1:07:00] divine inspiration
[1:07:02] interprets the word to you
[1:07:04] some people could
[1:07:06] interpret the word by mental intellect
[1:07:09] and have something called divine
[1:07:11] inspiration
[1:07:13] now you want to put the scriptures down
[1:07:15] and he says first corinthians 6 14 16
[1:07:18] paul said you follow me as i follow
[1:07:20] christ
[1:07:21] he didn't say follow me only
[1:07:23] he said as i
[1:07:25] follow christ all right then he was
[1:07:27] going to read this luke 10 16. he that
[1:07:30] heareth you here at me he despises you
[1:07:32] despise it me he despises me this was
[1:07:35] him that sent me
[1:07:36] that proves that god speaks his message
[1:07:38] to his servants
[1:07:40] always has
[1:07:41] now
[1:07:42] the power of the believe in church
[1:07:44] christ has all power in heaven you
[1:07:46] believe that
[1:07:47] now what if he's in you
[1:07:49] has christ got all power matthew 28 18
[1:07:52] right
[1:07:52] he is the seed word in his body he is
[1:07:57] and he is in us becomes the seed word in
[1:08:00] us
[1:08:01] now all that god was he poured into
[1:08:03] christ and all christ was was brought
[1:08:06] into the church now that's the power
[1:08:09] the seed of christ
[1:08:11] must come through the body
[1:08:17] are you getting you said i want to get
[1:08:19] this in real good
[1:08:20] i want to grind on
[1:08:22] the seed of christ
[1:08:24] must and he said must
[1:08:27] must
[1:08:28] come to his body
[1:08:30] not your denomination but you are born
[1:08:33] again seed of the word it must come true
[1:08:36] remember what it is christ's seed
[1:08:39] how does my seed come through my body
[1:08:42] now see through the body and the church
[1:08:44] is the body of christ that's right the
[1:08:46] bible church
[1:08:47] this birth
[1:08:49] produces the new boot himself
[1:08:51] in body his church in the church now
[1:08:54] we're going to get to something deep now
[1:08:56] watch this see church this real church
[1:08:59] with the real true sperm
[1:09:01] now remember god never committed his
[1:09:03] preaching and his gospel to angels how
[1:09:06] many knows that how he knows that
[1:09:08] galatians 1 8 if an angel comes from him
[1:09:09] and preached something else he said so
[1:09:11] the angel is wrong
[1:09:13] if it's a different word
[1:09:15] god committed his gospel to men he never
[1:09:18] committed the angels now philip was up
[1:09:21] to pentecost
[1:09:22] to worship isn't that right and the
[1:09:24] eunuch ethiopian eunuch he was with the
[1:09:26] disease and elderly and so on and he was
[1:09:29] studying the prophecy of isaiah
[1:09:31] and we know god took philip from that
[1:09:33] event for that some service and bring
[1:09:35] him to the equivalent right
[1:09:37] although an angel direct directed philip
[1:09:39] to him but the dream of life had to come
[1:09:42] to the body
[1:09:44] and philip was part of that body
[1:09:47] philip was the channel that god was
[1:09:49] going to use
[1:09:50] and this is a reproduction of another
[1:09:52] book of acts
[1:09:54] this going to be this bright church in
[1:09:55] the last days this would be part of how
[1:09:57] the bride could be in action in the last
[1:09:59] days because the seed word that the
[1:10:01] bride is impregnated with going to be in
[1:10:03] the bright body
[1:10:05] oh glory to god that seeds gonna be in
[1:10:07] the bright body
[1:10:09] in other words the word will become
[1:10:10] flesh the invisible will become visible
[1:10:13] because the word will be in you god is
[1:10:15] gonna be in you oh glory to god
[1:10:18] hallelujah one day gonna wake up and
[1:10:20] recognize he is in you
[1:10:22] oh glory to god there's no fairy tale
[1:10:25] philip had it peter had it we're gonna
[1:10:27] read about it oh glory to god although
[1:10:31] our angel directed philip to him but the
[1:10:33] germ of life had to come to the body
[1:10:35] philip where did the jed come from to
[1:10:37] the angel no the angel showed him where
[1:10:39] to go our angel is a messenger here is a
[1:10:42] son philip philip had the germ the
[1:10:46] message the word that is how our child
[1:10:48] was born philip laid his hands upon him
[1:10:50] philip baptized him in the name of jesus
[1:10:52] christ and there come from the spirit of
[1:10:54] god now the germ had to come from the
[1:10:56] body what body christ body correct and
[1:10:59] philip was a member of that body
[1:11:01] and the same thing took place with peter
[1:11:03] in acts 10 48 peter was at house of the
[1:11:06] top angel directed into cornelius house
[1:11:09] but where did the word come from the

[1:22:02] won't be along with you
[1:22:03] time running all right all right
[1:22:06] let's hear this now butterburner
[1:22:09] okay so the seed green
[1:22:11] the green seed the original fell at
[1:22:13] nicer room it was the first denomination
[1:22:15] notice here we go the life that was in
[1:22:18] the stalk
[1:22:19] tussle no ends up in the seed
[1:22:22] the life
[1:22:24] the life that comes out of the original
[1:22:26] seed come to different processes
[1:22:29] and turns back to its original condition
[1:22:31] so when you plant a corn seed a stock
[1:22:33] come up down the seed it goes to
[1:22:35] possesses leaves stalk and then they
[1:22:37] can't put a flower and that flower is
[1:22:39] like a testimony a corn coming then you
[1:22:42] see a little corn come at the side and
[1:22:44] it has something along it we call the
[1:22:46] corn hub the husk and different things
[1:22:48] that's like the shock when you pick the
[1:22:50] corn you have to pull all that yeah
[1:22:52] sammy and when things green everybody's
[1:22:53] looking green see looking green sharp
[1:22:55] looking green they're looking green but
[1:22:56] then come the hot sun
[1:22:58] and the hot sun is the right in the
[1:22:59] green
[1:23:00] and then the shark spirit pulls away
[1:23:03] you don't pull away from them and then
[1:23:04] away from you so you know you don't have
[1:23:07] to put nobody knowing
[1:23:08] others have that pulling away
[1:23:10] and they have that scripted twitter to
[1:23:12] separate yourself
[1:23:15] from such turn away
[1:23:16] that time is shock talking nothing
[1:23:33] i shock behavior
[1:23:35] but the seed golden brown
[1:23:38] you're imagining your storm
[1:23:41] you're facing your storm you're no
[1:23:43] longer asking god deliver me the living
[1:23:44] give me no you want to know how to
[1:23:46] manage
[1:23:47] your storm
[1:23:49] you got that sunday gone oh let's see we
[1:23:51] can wrap up here
[1:23:52] here it is now
[1:23:54] here the light that was in the husk in
[1:23:56] the stalk in the tussle all gathers in
[1:23:58] the seed
[1:24:00] watch and the life that was in the stalk
[1:24:02] one went to make the other justification
[1:24:05] middleweight personification some
[1:24:07] religion made a way for the baptist and
[1:24:09] the background he goes made away for
[1:24:11] our promise the holy ghost itself to
[1:24:14] come down right in perfection and back
[1:24:16] to the word of god again
[1:24:18] all the history of church when it
[1:24:20] organized it died right there the life
[1:24:22] leaves the stalk to make the tassel from
[1:24:24] the tassel it makes the husk from the
[1:24:26] husk it goes into the original green
[1:24:27] again
[1:24:28] how noticeable this life is is to travel
[1:24:32] in the corner wheat than it is in a tree
[1:24:34] no go people is like a tree the light
[1:24:36] goes down come back up but not in the
[1:24:38] corner wheat
[1:24:39] he is making a comparison here
[1:24:41] in the corner wheat it goes up from the
[1:24:44] original stalk through the stock tassel
[1:24:46] husk and the thing that it passed
[1:24:48] through dies
[1:24:50] it can't
[1:24:51] get back to it again
[1:24:53] what is it it is no use anymore
[1:24:56] oh hallelujah but here this part now but
[1:24:59] when the green but when the green light
[1:25:02] begins to leave the husk i like always
[1:25:04] say the green life
[1:25:05] so the husk have a certain portion of
[1:25:07] life
[1:25:08] that the green needs
[1:25:10] and after a while the green life of the
[1:25:12] husk
[1:25:13] move on
[1:25:14] and he was gathering
[1:25:16] the life
[1:25:17] oh hallelujah so watch this when the
[1:25:20] grain life begins to leave the husk to
[1:25:22] go to make the green the bride

[1:26:52] passed through but what happened now
[1:26:55] that's why you have to fight for fresh
[1:26:56] experience that's why that's something
[1:26:58] called refilling we fill it in the
[1:27:00] filling all over again it's a fresh
[1:27:02] feeling of god a fresh experience of god
[1:27:05] you have to want that you have to ask
[1:27:07] for that
[1:27:08] you have not because your acts not you
[1:27:09] have to ask for the holy ghost you don't
[1:27:11] sit down and rock back brahma said the
[1:27:13] early church do like they didn't have
[1:27:14] none at all they're always asking god
[1:27:16] sent on your power once more they get
[1:27:18] blows and licks and didn't take sick
[1:27:19] leave and stop coming to service for
[1:27:21] wednesday night praise god they came
[1:27:23] back to the prayer meetings lord give us
[1:27:24] some strength to go back and preach the
[1:27:26] gospel and then fellows just get licks
[1:27:28] earlier any day
[1:27:29] look at the lord's praises and when they
[1:27:31] pray that kind of prayer holy ghost hit
[1:27:33] them again and they're ready to go out
[1:27:34] and jam them out there with the gospel
[1:27:36] of jesus christ because this gospel must
[1:27:38] be preached and then the end shall come
[1:27:40] if you think we go sitting in church all
[1:27:41] the time that that will happen we have
[1:27:43] to be a witness of this message but he's
[1:27:46] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:27:47] there will be one more ride
[1:27:49] oh give the lord some praises
[1:27:51] hallelujah hallelujah listen to this
[1:27:54] bomb as we close she is the dry shark it
[1:27:57] passed
[1:27:58] the spirit of god passed through her and
[1:28:00] she will not be here with the vindicated
[1:28:03] seed word
[1:28:04] she sure will not be she will not be in
[1:28:06] the rapture she'll be a church member
[1:28:08] may come up in a second resurrection be
[1:28:09] judged according to what she heard
[1:28:11] oh my hallelujah
[1:28:13] and then when you become subject to that
[1:28:16] spirit
[1:28:17] it choose your whole being subject to
[1:28:18] that spirit and that spirit tear this
[1:28:21] brother george is nothing in the world
[1:28:23] but this seed would
[1:28:26] made manifest
[1:28:28] or quickened
[1:28:29] or made alive
[1:28:31] so that's why jesus could say the words
[1:28:32] that i speak they are spirit
[1:28:34] and they are life because you know if
[1:28:36] you receive the word and god switched to
[1:28:39] switching you it turned to spirit
[1:28:41] oh hallelujah
[1:28:43] what is it here it is it's the illness
[1:28:45] of the resurrection
[1:28:47] this body will be raised again because
[1:28:49] it's already started
[1:28:50] it once was subject to sin
[1:28:52] maya and corruption now it's got an
[1:28:54] earnest tune heavily
[1:28:56] so the witness of the spirit in you is
[1:28:58] evidence that you're on your way to the
[1:28:59] rapture
[1:29:00] hallelujah now
[1:29:02] what kind of seed is in you
[1:29:04] what kind of seed you are shows what's
[1:29:07] in you
[1:29:08] you can't hide it whatever you are
[1:29:10] inside it shows outside you just can't
[1:29:12] keep from it you can't make that tree
[1:29:14] anything but what it is that's right the
[1:29:16] holy spirit
[1:29:18] transform the seeds
[1:29:19] on the inside of it no matter what kind
[1:29:22] of seed it is
[1:29:23] if it's evil it will bring for evil if
[1:29:25] it's hypocrite it'll be for hypocrite if
[1:29:27] it's genuine word of god it will bring
[1:29:28] forth genuine son the daughters of god
[1:29:30] by the transforming of the seed
[1:29:32] militants come up please
[1:29:33] but abraham as we close one night i was
[1:29:36] seeking the lord the holy spirit told me
[1:29:37] to pick up my pen and write
[1:29:39] as i grasp this pen to write his spirit
[1:29:41] give me a message for the church i want
[1:29:43] to bring it to you it has to do with the
[1:29:46] word
[1:29:47] and the bride
[1:29:49] and the spirit
[1:29:50] was writing to him
[1:29:52] said this here's what i'm trying to say
[1:29:54] to you
[1:29:55] the law of reproduction is that each
[1:29:57] seed species bring forth after its own
[1:29:59] kind it might go into genesis 1 11. and
[1:30:02] god said let the it bring forth grass
[1:30:03] he'll be then seed fruit tree and fruit
[1:30:06] after his kind whose seed in himself
[1:30:07] upon the earth it was so
[1:30:09] whatever life was in the seed comes
[1:30:11] forth in a plant against the fruit
[1:30:14] the same law applies to the church today
[1:30:16] whatever seed started the church will
[1:30:18] come forth and be like the original seed
[1:30:19] because it's the same seed
[1:30:21] in these last days the true bright
[1:30:24] church
[1:30:24] christ's seed will come to the headstone
[1:30:28] and she will be a super church
[1:30:31] a super race as she nears him this is
[1:30:34] god speaking now
[1:30:35] there in the bride will be so much like
[1:30:37] him that they will even be in his very
[1:30:40] image
[1:30:41] nice second peter 147
[1:30:43] very image
[1:30:44] this
[1:30:45] image here this is in order to be united
[1:30:48] with him
[1:30:50] there will be one
[1:30:51] there will be the very manifestation of
[1:30:54] the word of the living god
[1:30:55] when people read in text they will be
[1:30:57] the manifestation of the text that
[1:30:58] they're reading
[1:31:00] denominations cannot produce this wrong
[1:31:02] seed they will produce their creeds and
[1:31:04] their dogmas mixed with the word their
[1:31:06] mongolizing brings forth a hybrid
[1:31:07] product the first the first son adam was
[1:31:10] the spoken seed word of god he was given
[1:31:13] a bride to reproduce himself
[1:31:16] that
[1:31:16] is why
[1:31:18] the bride was given to him to reproduce
[1:31:22] himself
[1:31:23] so the bride was given to be impregnated
[1:31:26] with christ's own seed that's the title
[1:31:28] we have tonight oh glory to god the only
[1:31:31] reason there's a bride is to have a
[1:31:32] reproduction or give the lord some
[1:31:34] praises tonight
[1:31:36] nothing less than that
[1:31:37] a reproduction of the original grain
[1:31:42] let's go watch
[1:31:46] so that is why the bride was given to
[1:31:47] him to reproduce himself to produce
[1:31:49] another son of god but she fell she fell
[1:31:52] back hybridization she caused him to die
[1:31:54] the second son jesus also spoke of seed
[1:31:56] word of god was given to a bride like
[1:31:58] like was adam but before he could marry
[1:32:00] her she had also fallen
[1:32:02] she like aaron's wife was put to the
[1:32:05] test whether she would believe the word
[1:32:06] and live and daughter wouldn't die she
[1:32:08] doubted she left the word she died here
[1:32:11] we go now
[1:32:12] from a little group
[1:32:14] of
[1:32:15] are you ready
[1:32:16] the true seed of the word
[1:32:18] now this is god almighty speaking this a
[1:32:21] group from where
[1:32:22] the true seed of the word now that
[1:32:25] implies there's a false seed
[1:32:28] the group coming out of the truth of the
[1:32:29] word will present christ a beloved bride
[1:32:31] she's a version of his word she's a
[1:32:34] virgin because she knows no man make
[1:32:36] queries or dogmas
[1:32:38] by and through the bride
[1:32:41] will be fulfilled
[1:32:42] all
[1:32:43] that was promised
[1:32:45] of god
[1:32:46] to remain manifest in the virgin
[1:32:48] the word of promise came to the virgin
[1:32:49] mary but that would have promised was he
[1:32:51] himself to remain manifest
[1:32:53] god was made manifest here we go he
[1:32:56] himself
[1:32:57] acted at that time and fulfill his own
[1:33:00] word of promise no manufacturing
[1:33:02] necessary
[1:33:03] oh gloria has pumped that word
[1:33:05] abraham pumped for 25 years and elohim
[1:33:08] come walk in the night and say i will
[1:33:09] return unto thee according to the time
[1:33:11] of life
[1:33:12] hallelujah
[1:33:13] glory to god
[1:33:15] it was an angel that brought her the
[1:33:16] message but the angel message was the
[1:33:18] word of god from isaiah 6 which is
[1:33:20] scripture he fulfill that at that time
[1:33:24] the members of the virgin birth would
[1:33:25] love him
[1:33:26] they will have his potentials for he is
[1:33:28] their head
[1:33:29] not some church overseas
[1:33:32] not some man's overseas
[1:33:34] he christ is the head isn't that right
[1:33:38] and watch and all paul belongs to him
[1:33:40] they are subject to him
[1:33:42] as members of our bodies are subject to
[1:33:44] our heads notice the harmony of the
[1:33:47] father and the son jesus never did
[1:33:49] anything until it was first showed in by
[1:33:51] the father this harmony is known to
[1:33:53] exist between the groom and his brain he
[1:33:55] sure has word of life she receives it
[1:33:58] she never doubts it therefore nothing
[1:34:00] can harm her
[1:34:01] why you can receive it no doubt about it
[1:34:03] no weapon form against you could
[1:34:04] possibly you you have to believe that
[1:34:07] the angels of the lord and camp around
[1:34:08] those who fear him you have to believe
[1:34:10] that
[1:34:10] glory to god now here's the secret
[1:34:14] the word
[1:34:16] is in the brine
[1:34:17] as it is in mary
[1:34:19] as it was in mary the bride has the mind
[1:34:21] of christ for she knows
[1:34:24] what he wants done
[1:34:26] with the word
[1:34:27] and that gun is not arguably today all
[1:34:30] right she performs the command of the
[1:34:32] word in his name for she has thus said
[1:34:35] the lord then the word is quickened by
[1:34:37] the spirit and it comes to pass like a
[1:34:40] seed that is planted and watered it
[1:34:41] comes to full harvest silver and its
[1:34:43] purpose those in the bride do only his
[1:34:46] will
[1:34:46] only
[1:34:48] his will no one can make them do
[1:34:49] otherwise they have thus here the lord
[1:34:52] or they keep still
[1:34:54] so these seven thunder seas had to be
[1:34:56] planted for us to have a seventh on the
[1:34:58] revival may the lord bless you tonight
[1:35:01] quicken that word to you tonight
[1:35:03] inspired by his love for you tonight
