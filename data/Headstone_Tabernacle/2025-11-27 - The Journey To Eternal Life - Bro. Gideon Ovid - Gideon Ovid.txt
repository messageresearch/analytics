Blessed be his wonderful [music] name. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This time, I just want to switch over to [music] to the word. If you have your Bibles, I'd like you to turn with me to the book of Matthew. Thank you, musicians. Matthew reading from chapter 19 from verse 16. Very familiar scripture like us to explore this evening. from Matthew 19:16. And it says, "And behold, one came and said unto him, good master, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?" And he said unto him, Why callst thou me good? There is none good but one, that is God. But if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. He said unto him, "Which," Jesus said, "Thou shalt do no murder. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not bear false witness. Honor thy father and thy mother, and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." In verse 20, the young man said unto him, "All these things have I kept from my youth up. [snorts] What lack I yet?" Jesus said unto him, "If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come and follow me." But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. Let's just bow our heads a word of prayer. Oh heavenly father, Lord, this evening we've gathered together, Lord, and we've read your scripture, Lord. We've read your word, Lord. Lord, your spoken word that you have laid out for us, Lord. And we want to fellowship around your word, Lord. Lord, I pray that you would breathe life, Lord. I pray that you would use me as a instrument of just communication tonight, Lord. But you'll take me out of the way, Lord, and you'll speak lip to air to your people, Lord. I pray that some life, some heart, some mind be renewed, that some somebody will be changed and be made better off, Lord, because of the words that would have been shared, Lord. Lord, I pray that you would take the the few thoughts and and and and the scriptures, Lord, and you would would open it up to us, Lord, that we could receive all that you have in store for us tonight, Lord. Lord, I pray that you will have your perfect will tonight. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. You may have your seats. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Blessed be his name. You know, for a title, the journey to eternal life. Amen. &gt;&gt; And for inspiration, what lacets coming out of this scripture we just read. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this scripture is a powerful scripture. It's very familiar time. We refer to this as the story of the rich young ruler. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And just to recap a little bit, you don't have to find it, but we just read the scripture. I just want to highlight a couple things that we just went through from verse 16. It says, "And behold, one came and said unto him, good master." So clearly this young man knew who he was speaking with. &gt;&gt; He knew who he was addressing. He had manners. He had respects. Some may say he had discipline that he came and he said unto him, "Good master," and referred to him as such. &gt;&gt; He also said, "What good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?" So he acknowledged at this point that he believed that there was something he had to do &gt;&gt; in order to have eternal life. &gt;&gt; It also highlights the fact that eternal life was important to him &gt;&gt; because he saw the need to inquire about it. &gt;&gt; We don't inquire about things that don't impact our lives that are not meaningful to us. &gt;&gt; So he knew he was addressing the master. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he knew he wanted eternal life. That was his end goal. &gt;&gt; He was on the journey to get there &gt;&gt; and he wanted some advice and he believed he had part of the answer already cuz he knew it's not by bad works. It's not by lying and cheating. He said what good thing shall I do? &gt;&gt; So I know something is required of me. I just want clarity on what it is. &gt;&gt; So he said what good thing? And then it went on and he said unto him, why callst thou me good? And this was Jesus answering, "There is not good but one that is God, but if thou will enter into life and keep the commandments." So Jesus in this instance responded to him and give him an answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Told him these are the things you need to do. If you want to enter into life, you need to keep the commandments. &gt;&gt; Now in the message, we learn that Jesus was only testing him. You know, was trying to see what was going on with him. &gt;&gt; Jesus knew what was in his heart, but he wanted to see how he would respond. Yeah. So he wanted to see his religious background and and how grounded he was &gt;&gt; and as expected in verse 18 he said which which commandments. So clearly he knew the commandments which &gt;&gt; so he wasn't ignorant. He wasn't what what do you mean when you say commandments? Exactly what you're trying to express. No he wasn't like that. &gt;&gt; He knew they were commandments and he knew he kept all but he wanted to be certain. He knew exactly which one was required of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This was how specific he was. He said which Jesus said. You know it already. Thou shalt do no murder. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not bear false witness. Honor thy father and thy mother. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. And the young man said unto him almost as if to interrupt him and says, listen, you see all the things you went through there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I have kept those from my youth up. &gt;&gt; What lacker yet? &gt;&gt; But before he was trying to send a clear message to Jesus that listen when I mark my papers is 10 out of 10. &gt;&gt; All ten commandments in order &gt;&gt; full marks. &gt;&gt; If he had to mark himself 10 out of 10. &gt;&gt; Many of times just like us sometimes if we look at ourselves we believe we are right. &gt;&gt; We believe we do good. Amen. &gt;&gt; We believe that we've done done enough. &gt;&gt; We we we believe that we just in limbo. We just waiting because we finished everything already. &gt;&gt; But sometimes in tests, you need to check over. &gt;&gt; You need to review. You might know it, you know, &gt;&gt; but you might make a little mistake. &gt;&gt; So it's important is it's an important part of the process to to review &gt;&gt; to check over per adventure. You might be missing something. &gt;&gt; Just in case you may have left something out. So in this case he said all these things all the commandments you call there all of them &gt;&gt; I have done this from my youth meaning I was taught this as a child &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; so it's not a a now come thing &gt;&gt; essentially I born in church &gt;&gt; I grew up in the message I know the scriptures I know the quotes &gt;&gt; what is wrong with me &gt;&gt; what more I need to do &gt;&gt; to have eternal Amen. &gt;&gt; So he's in this processing of checking himself against the requirement &gt;&gt; and in his eyes he's all right &gt;&gt; but he's still asking so we can say he's humble enough to say &gt;&gt; what I really missing &gt;&gt; what I miss here &gt;&gt; I come to church I early I sing I play music I do all kind of thing I give charity I treat my neighbor all right I good with my family and my friends everybody have good things to say about me. What could be wrong with me? &gt;&gt; What could I be missing? What's the missing link or missing piece that I don't have this eternal life &gt;&gt; that I heard about? &gt;&gt; I don't have this Holy Ghost that I heard preach about. &gt;&gt; I don't have the token that I read about in the message. What is missing? &gt;&gt; This is the point he was at. And Jesus said unto him in verse 21, he said, "If thou wil be perfect, &gt;&gt; essentially perfection is necessary to access this eternal life." &gt;&gt; He said, "Go and sell that thou hast &gt;&gt; and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me." Now, there's three things there &gt;&gt; in Jesus statement. He says, "Go and sell." That's the first part. He said, "Give to the poor." That's the second part. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Come and follow me." &gt;&gt; That's the third part. &gt;&gt; And in the next verse, we'll come back to that. And in the next verse, he said, "When the young man heard that saying, essentially when he was given the advice or the instruction, he went away sorrowful &gt;&gt; for he had great possessions." &gt;&gt; And that's the end of the scripture that we would have read. But in terms of the the lessons to be gained outside of all the things already highlighted, I just want to delve a little deeper in terms of the things we highlighted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus told him to sell. &gt;&gt; What does it mean to sell? Not by definition, but to sell really is to give up. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Give up the things you work hard to build. &gt;&gt; Give up the things that you're so proud about. &gt;&gt; Amen. the titles and the accolades and the achievement and all the good stuff that people have to say about you. &gt;&gt; Jesus told him to give it up. &gt;&gt; Give it up. &gt;&gt; Let it go. &gt;&gt; Release it. &gt;&gt; That's good. That's good. &gt;&gt; Give it away. &gt;&gt; Don't focus on that. Don't bother with it. &gt;&gt; It's it's it's no longer important to say you know who I am. I am I am Mr. This. I am the CEO of that. I am in charge and I'm respons. Give up all that. &gt;&gt; Sell it. liquidate it. &gt;&gt; Dump it. &gt;&gt; Get rid of it. &gt;&gt; He also went and he said give and it's one thing to sell. It's one thing to have. And this is not against wealth or money or riches. But when he said give, he meant give of the proceeds of the sales. So he said sell and give to the poor. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Give to those who need. &gt;&gt; Give to those who are less fortunate. Give to those who are unable to give you back. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't give without expectation. &gt;&gt; Cuz he specifically said, not just give, don't give to the foundation and the charities. He said, give to the poor, &gt;&gt; the ones that are helpless, &gt;&gt; the ones that are in need the most, &gt;&gt; and to give. When I looked at it, it means to contribute more, &gt;&gt; to do more, &gt;&gt; to be more, &gt;&gt; to really allow yourself to become selfless and less selfish. to care for others, &gt;&gt; to have empathy. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; So Jesus was asking him, listen, I know you did all this stuff. If we had to look at it in black and white, probably got 10 out of 10, but when I look a little deeper, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; I realize there are some things that we still need to address that you may have overlooked the first time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he say, I want you to be able to go the extra mile. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what it is to give. So to give is to become uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So it's not just the norm. It is not giving because you your your you want to say that you give or for PR you want it to look good. So I want to pat myself on the back and say I give. No. But he said as an instruction to give to the poor &gt;&gt; to show that it's more than you. It's more than your needs and and and and just what you think and feel but to do a little more. And the last thing he said was to follow. &gt;&gt; And this is where we get a lot of problems. &gt;&gt; Follow. &gt;&gt; Follow. &gt;&gt; Cuz you're trained in your mind that you want to lead. &gt;&gt; Even my my daughter is five and she'll say, "I want to do it myself. &gt;&gt; I want to do it for myself. &gt;&gt; She don't want to guide her and push her. She wants to do it for herself." And and innately almost we feel this need to just do. &gt;&gt; But to follow is to seek advice. Amen. &gt;&gt; To follow is to allow others to lead. &gt;&gt; To follow is to take guidance &gt;&gt; perhaps from those who've done it before. &gt;&gt; That's what it means to follow. &gt;&gt; So following doesn't necessarily make you weak. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; But it makes you smart &gt;&gt; because you don't have to make the mistakes that others would have made. &gt;&gt; So when he said follow me, it means follow the lessons and the guidance and the wisdom that I am in a position to impart onto you. But as we know the scripture said he went away &gt;&gt; sorrowful. &gt;&gt; But suggest to us listen this was a little too much to ask. &gt;&gt; It was a little too much to ask you to give a little more. It was a little too much like Lot's wife to say forget that. Forget about it. Move on. Keep it moving. Press on. I know you work hard to establish yourself in this circle or in this group, but are you willing to give it up? &gt;&gt; Are you willing to walk away? Are you willing to let go? Are you willing to go beyond yourself and help those that cannot help you? &gt;&gt; That's good. That's good. &gt;&gt; This was the challenge of the rich young ruler on his journey to eternal life &gt;&gt; because that's what he wanted. That was his desire. He desired to achieve that which is why he inquired what I should do? What good thing should I do in order to get that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And although the answer may have seemed simple, it was a tough decision for him because in the last verse it say he had great possessions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now think think about it for the man who don't have you tell him sell everything you have. &gt;&gt; He don't have anything to sell. He don't have any sacrifice. He has no real burden. He has no loss or hurt to be gained by doing that. But for the man with great possessions, with great titles, with great accolades and achievements, &gt;&gt; it becomes a test. It becomes a trial to move past that. &gt;&gt; So Jesus indeed obviously knew what he was doing. Yes. &gt;&gt; Jesus was shaking him up a little bit, &gt;&gt; giving him a reality check, &gt;&gt; that despite how you look on the outside, it was more important the way it looks on the inside because he said, "When you do this, you will have treachers in heaven." &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what your neighbor think about it, you know, it doesn't matter if they impressed or not. &gt;&gt; But we also have to be conscious of what is really important. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I want to shift gears a little bit and talk about the other rich young ruler. For in the Bible, they talk about two rich young rulers. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One rich young ruler was the one we read about just now. And the next rich young ruler was Moses. And in a message, I believe leadership, &gt;&gt; brother Brandham talked about the other rich young ruler. &gt;&gt; He was just as young. He was powerful. &gt;&gt; He was wealthy. &gt;&gt; He was heir to the throne. &gt;&gt; He had the ability to do things that the average person couldn't. &gt;&gt; He had the ability to tell one go and he will go and come and so on. He had a nice title. &gt;&gt; He had nice achievements and accolades in terms of the things he had accomplished. He went to the best schools. He had great tutors, great teachers. He graduated first class honors, top of the class &gt;&gt; cuz they had to be trained. He was next in line to be Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; But you know what? &gt;&gt; He choose &gt;&gt; and he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He give it up. &gt;&gt; He say here what you see the title you're throwing on me. &gt;&gt; I don't want that. Amen. &gt;&gt; He say choosing rather to suffer the afflictions of God, &gt;&gt; esteeming the reproach of Christ greater treasures &gt;&gt; than all the treasures of Egypt. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this tells you it's possible [applause] &gt;&gt; to follow the leadership of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And see doors open &gt;&gt; and see that journey become a little easier &gt;&gt; as we traverse this life &gt;&gt; unto eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In that message, brother goes on to say, listen, Moses esteemed at the greatest. Now, this rich man didn't Moses was a rich young ruler to become Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; And it went on. They say, "By faith, he saw the promise of God through the word &gt;&gt; that his people would sjourn in a strange land for 400 years, but would be brought out by a mighty hand, and he esteemed that, hallelujah, greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt. for he forsook Egypt not knowing where he was going. &gt;&gt; I said sometimes when you follow it feels uncomfortable. Sometimes when you sell and you give and you decide, I'm going to make this move by faith, it might feel strange, &gt;&gt; but Moses did it. And he was led by Christ for the reproach of Christ, the reproach to be called a odd one to be called that fanatic to take his place with the mud dubbers and the fanatics because he seen at that hour that the scripture was promised to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Was there then an old church wake up? Can't you see the same thing tonight? The hour that's been promises on us esteem the reproach of Jesus Christ greater riches than all the fellowship of anything. If it takes father and mother church anything else follow the leadership of the spirit. Let us follow this Christ for a few this Moses for a little while that did that. Let's watch his life. The first thing when he had accepted to take the reproach of Christ and forsake his education, forsake all of his wisdom, he was taught in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and all of his popularity, his throne, his scepter, his kingship, his crown, everything he had, he rejected it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the other rich young ruler. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But I asked myself, why? Why was that important? &gt;&gt; We could have learned the lesson from the rich young ruler that walked away. Yes, &gt;&gt; but this highlighted that it's possible for you to do it. &gt;&gt; It's possible for us to achieve that. &gt;&gt; Mind you, it didn't say he forget everything he learned and he became a fool. But he rejected the education system. He rejected his passion. He rejected the styles. He rejected the music. And he decided to follow Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. He decided to follow the word of God &gt;&gt; because God promised to take them out after sjouring in this strange land. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and in the scripture it said, you know, the devil is like a roaring lion &gt;&gt; seeking who he could devour. &gt;&gt; So the devil have plans for you, you know. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If you don't have plans for yourself, he have plans for you. &gt;&gt; He looking for the chinks, the weaknesses, &gt;&gt; the imperfections. He looking to make sure you could lose marks on this exam. &gt;&gt; He making sure that you're weakened. &gt;&gt; He don't want you strong at all. Why? &gt;&gt; Imagine Simon after walking with Jesus for three and a half years. Jesus in the book of Luke, he said, "Behold, Satan has desired to sift you like wheat." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is after walking with Christ for three and a half years. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He desired to sift you like wheat. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I prayed for thee &gt;&gt; that thy faith fail not &gt;&gt; and when thou art converted strengthen your brethren. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the interesting thing about that is the the example or the words or the illustration used. &gt;&gt; He say the devil don't want to touch you and run away. You know &gt;&gt; he want to sift you like wheat. And if you ever research what sifting like wheat looks like, it's like a big seal that you rock and you shake violently. So imagine the devil want you upside down, inside out. He want to punch you on your head. He want like if you go in the ocean and the wave batter you and you roll over and you're out of control. That's where he want you. And I found out why. Cuz I started to do a little more research. You see, when you're battered and and and bruised and knocked up and and traumatized, it reminded me of those boxers. I remember hearing years ago that boxers have a higher probability of developing not just brain damage, but things like dementia, amnesia, because of the traumatic effects on the brain when they get knocked all over the place. when they box them in the face and in the head and in the mouth and all over. You see, that's what the devil want to do. If you could get amnesia, dementia, you could forget. It means you could get spiritual amnesia. Then you could forget who you are. &gt;&gt; Keep in mind, you're the child of the king. You know, &gt;&gt; at the end of the day, he left certain promises for you. And if you forget, [applause] &gt;&gt; the devil is happy, you know. &gt;&gt; But God don't want you forget tonight. God want to remind you &gt;&gt; that listen, I paid a price for you. &gt;&gt; Not for you to just walk around with your head down willy-nilly and you're not sure today or tomorrow, but he want you to be more than a conqueror. &gt;&gt; He want you to be victorious because he already won the battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] And at the end of the day after we we clap and we sing and we worship and we shake hands and we smile the question has to be asked with which we are all faced. Are you ready to meet God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When it's all said and done &gt;&gt; are you ready to meet him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the same message you say remember you're going to die someday or either be translated into heaven. Amen. And if you die before his coming, you'll be raptured first. Did you not know that the dead in Christ shall rise? If mama and papa dies before you do, and Jesus doesn't come in our generation, do you know know this? They will come first glorified before you. See, &gt;&gt; the trumpet of God shall sound, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up with them. &gt;&gt; We'll be changed like that. We've got to remember, listen, that's the main thing in life. You understand now? That's the main thing in life we got to do is to get ready to meet God &gt;&gt; after all is said and done. &gt;&gt; After every sermon is is preached and every song is sung, &gt;&gt; we have to understand that the main thing is to make sure you're ready. &gt;&gt; Make sure you pass the exam. Make sure you accept. Make sure you check over. Make sure you're confident in the word of God and his promises. And you could know it's not by might nor by power, but by his spirit that you're prepared to meet him. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now in the book of John and we know it, Nicod Nicodemus would have said um he he approached by night and they say he was a man of the Pharisees. He was an important guy. He was a guy with very experience. He had a lot of knowledge. He had a lot of information and he knew what he was doing. He knew what he was talking about. He was a wellrespected guy. And they say he came to Jesus by night under the cover of darkness because he too when he looked over his life &gt;&gt; although he was a a big boy &gt;&gt; although he was well respected &gt;&gt; he realized that listen &gt;&gt; that Jesus is doing some things that very different &gt;&gt; to what I know and I am a big boy. Imagine I am important. I'm well respected and that Jesus is doing some things that I can't really explain. So he said unto him, "Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God." &gt;&gt; Similar to the rich young young ruler, good master. &gt;&gt; So he say, "Rabbi, I know, listen, you're a teacher come from God." So I' given you respects. I want to show you that I know who you are. I recognize you. I am an important man and I want to give you all the the the accolades and all the the titles that I believe should be given to you at this point &gt;&gt; cuz I want you to be able to answer me the way I expect. &gt;&gt; And you say, "No man can do these miracles that thou doest &gt;&gt; except God be with him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus answered unto him, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." So, it was about being born again, but he had a question in his heart. He had something he wanted resolved. He wanted a clear answer on his question, his position, and he wanted it in his context. And in verse four, it said, "Nicodemus said unto him, how can a man be born when he's old? Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born?" Jesus answered, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a man be born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God." So once again, we see Jesus was responding to him and giving him an answer based on the question he asked. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; He said, "What do I need? &gt;&gt; I know you're an important man and I realize you said something here that have me a little unsettled. I want some clarity." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Please give me something more. And when Jesus answered him, he was at the point that it seems strange, but he was listening. Jesus said, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, he must be born again." So he definitely heard, "This is the answer based on what I asked." Once again, this was somebody recognizing that something was missing. &gt;&gt; Something was lacking. &gt;&gt; That I need clarity on because I want to fill the gaps. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I want to fill the void. &gt;&gt; I want to become a whole person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So despite my history, despite my experience, &gt;&gt; I wanted to get that. You see, at the end of the day, we might say it's part of us to desire perfection, but the devil job is to shift you out from that. You know, the devil's job is to convince you that you are right, &gt;&gt; the devil job is to convince you that you've done enough, &gt;&gt; that you're okay. &gt;&gt; So, he want to interfere with you know, but not not too much. &gt;&gt; Yes. Cuz if he interfere with you too much all of a sudden a standard raised up against him and know &gt;&gt; all of a sudden he have no access to your life. So in the story of the prodigal son I think it's relevant to to touch a little bit. He too reach a point and you'll realize every single character comes to a realization that something is not right. &gt;&gt; Yes. something is lacking. &gt;&gt; I need to fix this part of me or something missing. &gt;&gt; As we know in the story itself, two sons, he decide I want my inheritance now. I pressing on. I'm going to a far country and the Bible said he read spent it all riotous living. He had a good time. You know, &gt;&gt; he was on Instagram, Facebook, Tik Tok. It was viral. He had memes. He had all kind of followers. When when I tell he had followers, he had real followers and all until famine came. When famine came, he realized he start to lose followers. He thought was a glitch in the system. He thought it was Instagram fault or Tik Tok fault or Facebook fault. He really thought something was wrong. If you see him trying to restart the social media applications until he realized, wait a minute, without money, I don't really have a choice at this point is about survival. At this stage in my life is when he chose to do introspection. He start to mark himself and he say, "Wait a minute here. What? I'm in a bad condition, but I'm going to do the best I could do." So he became a citizen of the country and looking for work. The only work he could find was feeding the pigs, living with them, mining them, &gt;&gt; eating pig food, &gt;&gt; just being part of the society, just another one. And although this was his condition, it was in that condition that he started to think, what lacker yet boy, how I end up here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. You mean it have so much promises for me? But I living below my privilege. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. You mean it have so much more that I could be, so much more that I could gain, so much more that I could participate in, but this is the way I live in. &gt;&gt; Imagine he's in the club one day and he say, "But what are you really doing here?" &gt;&gt; I remember a time when I used to jump and sing, not because the DJ dropped some beats, but because I I was in church. &gt;&gt; All right. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Be wait a minute. You mean before the foundation of the earth, I was there. I was worshiping. &gt;&gt; I was giving praise. &gt;&gt; So you see, he experienced what I alluded to earlier. He had spiritual amnesia as well. &gt;&gt; He forgot who he was. &gt;&gt; And because he forgot who he was, something had to stir him up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To question what lack I yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I find myself in a precarious position. I find myself in a position that I never expected to be in. I find myself in a position because when I look back 10 years ago, I wasn't here. But slowly slowly I missed one service, two services, three services, then I'm no longer in church. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Then I find myself in the club. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then I find myself all over the place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I didn't even realize how I reached this far. &gt;&gt; But it started somewhere. So in doing introspection as he check back he realized wait a minute &gt;&gt; my father have &gt;&gt; servants &gt;&gt; servants he have workers he have people that are paid I not getting paid I I pay I getting paid in pig in pig food &gt;&gt; I getting paid in survival points &gt;&gt; but my father it's is a lord where he is you know &gt;&gt; he's a boss where he is &gt;&gt; my father has a estate &gt;&gt; my father have security. He have workers. He have staff. He have groundsmen. He have pool guide. He have everything in in order. As a matter of fact, he have guys on the outside of the walls looking out too to make sure everything is okay. And when he started to [laughter] think back, he recognized, wait a minute. I don't have amnesia anymore. I don't suffer from from memory loss anymore. I I I had an identity crisis before, but I now know who I am. I recognized that if I am in a different place, my circumstance will change. &gt;&gt; He was so real with himself. &gt;&gt; Come on [snorts] now. &gt;&gt; He said, "You know what? I have a plan. I will go unto my father and I will tell him I have sinned against heaven and against thee. I am no longer worthy to be called your son. So don't even consider me a son because I am a failure. I embarrass the family, the family name, the family title, the history. I am almost like a outcast at this point and I don't deserve to be part of this. However, if you will consider me enough to make me a servant at taking that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; That was his plan. Now God had other plans for him. His father had other plans for him &gt;&gt; because his father knew just like you and I. God make a promise &gt;&gt; that not one will be left behind. that your children come in &gt;&gt; that there will be a revival for the young people. &gt;&gt; He promised a revival in this hour. &gt;&gt; He promised to restore the gifts in the church. So he knew that. So he water in these promises every day with hope, with faith, with confidence knowing he who made the promise was well able to fulfill it. &gt;&gt; So he never stopped believing. He never give up hope because he know Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever. And his word can't fail. His promises can't fail. It shall not return void. As a result, the father stand up outside looking. So while you marking your papers and examining yourself, he looking, he looking, hoping and praying. One day you will walk through the door. One day you will remember that I still here right where you left me. They are still here [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; in a message the token. [applause] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham give the example. He say listen if you want to ride the bus and you see it all the time. You don't walk up to the bus driver way waving a bill at $10 or $20. You need to buy a ticket. &gt;&gt; The ticket is the token. The token shows that the price was paid for the ride you want to get. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this journey you want to take requires a price to be paid. &gt;&gt; And when you pay the price or when the price has been paid, you get a token. The token is evidence that you could board. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's evidence that you could be on this journey. &gt;&gt; That you could reach the destination in safety. &gt;&gt; That's the purpose of the token. &gt;&gt; It's not about you. It's about the representation you need to take you there. &gt;&gt; You could say, "Listen, you you know who I am. I am Mr. so so. I am the CEO. I don't need a ticket. I going to board the plane. I could go to the airport and go where I want because I am the manager. I am the CEO. I'm the boss." Listen, security will put you out. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't pass customs or immigration or whatever you call it &gt;&gt; because you need the ticket. &gt;&gt; You need the token to show the price was paid for you to be there. &gt;&gt; Even if somebody else paid it when you reach the air the the airport itself, you need a boarding pass. &gt;&gt; So I could buy a ticket for you, but you need the boarding pass to get on the plane. &gt;&gt; You can't say well well he buy the ticket for me. No, you need your boarding pass to get on the plane. &gt;&gt; It's personal to you. &gt;&gt; At that stage is an individual affair. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how old you are, how young you are, whe whether you're rich or poor, you need a boarding pass to get on the plane. &gt;&gt; No exceptions. &gt;&gt; None. &gt;&gt; So he said, you need the token to get on the bus, &gt;&gt; to get on the train, to get on the plane, to get on the ride, to be on the journey. You need that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, when you want eternal life, you receive a token &gt;&gt; showing that the price has been paid. It isn't the blood, but it's the token of the blood. &gt;&gt; It's the life itself." Amen. Full obedience to the whole word of God, to God's entire word, will entitle you to the token. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How do you do it? Peter said on the day of Pentecost, "Repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, the token, &gt;&gt; for the promise is unto you and to your children, &gt;&gt; and to them that are far off, &gt;&gt; even as many as the Lord or God shall call." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you need the token. &gt;&gt; There are things required to get the token. &gt;&gt; The price might be paid. Listen, you could have a ticket that's paid for. If you don't go to the airport, you go nowhere. &gt;&gt; That's not good. &gt;&gt; You can have a ticket that's paid for. You go to the airport, but you just pass the I forget what you call them, the CSRs or whatever it is, you go nowhere. It doesn't matter that the price of the ticket was paid. If you come late, if you don't have the requirements, your bag's too big or whatever the scenario is, you go nowhere. &gt;&gt; You can't take this journey. &gt;&gt; And the title was journey to eternal life. That's the most important thing. &gt;&gt; You want to be able to access eternal life &gt;&gt; because one day you're going to meet God. &gt;&gt; No exceptions. &gt;&gt; No exceptions. You're going to meet him &gt;&gt; face to face by yourself. &gt;&gt; Not with your mother and your father and and my grandfather and my uncle and they could vouch for me and they could tell you how good I was. No, by yourself you're going to meet him. So you need your tickets or your token &gt;&gt; in order to be on this journey. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we need to be able to ask ourselves what lera yet. &gt;&gt; Do I have my boarding pass? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do I have my ticket? Do I have what's required? Because Jesus gave the rich young ruler requirements. &gt;&gt; He chose to walk away with great sorrow. He thought it was too much. &gt;&gt; I don't want to reach 2 hours before. I like to sleep too much. You will miss the flight. &gt;&gt; Yes, you'll miss the flight. &gt;&gt; I don't want to, you know, I find you have too many restrictions. They tell Mak bring this on board and this on board and this on board. No, that's why they scan it. You can't go with any and anything. &gt;&gt; They will scan it. &gt;&gt; They want to make sure you have what's required to be on board. So this journey is like that. You can't just go on the journey because your father and your mother and your uncle. No, you need to have the requirements and the boarding pass to be on on this journey. [applause] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't be too long with you. Now I reme remember even as a child I heard this and and I read it myself where Brandham used to talk about the box cars &gt;&gt; and he talk about the fact that the box cars had to be filled. It were filled with cans &gt;&gt; and if it go loose if it start to rock and shake and out of place they had to disqualify it from going on the journey. &gt;&gt; It couldn't progress. couldn't go to the next step. It couldn't go to the next phase. &gt;&gt; So, it was important that you pack it right and be meticulous about ensuring that everything is in its place. &gt;&gt; All the requirements are in order. That you pack it the way he said to pack it. Why? Because at some point an inspector &gt;&gt; coming to check it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And when the inspector come, &gt;&gt; they're going to rock it and shake it a little bit. &gt;&gt; They're going to check it. They're going to do random selection perhaps &gt;&gt; to make sure what's inside the box, guys, what's supposed to be there. &gt;&gt; They're not going to just take your word for it. &gt;&gt; They want to ensure that the contents inside &gt;&gt; is exactly what should be inside. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, when it's packed properly, they put a seal around it. Amen. &gt;&gt; They always put a seal around it &gt;&gt; to make sure &gt;&gt; nothing could come out and nothing could go in. &gt;&gt; That's why it's sealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You seal to ensure that nothing could go in and nothing could come out. Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's important to understand how that works. &gt;&gt; The reason being &gt;&gt; the act of sealing is very very symbolic. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Seals could means various things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit itself is a seal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And seal signifies &gt;&gt; a finished work. &gt;&gt; That done. &gt;&gt; There's nothing else required. So you no longer have to ask the question what lera yet because I in order now a check over is 100%. As a matter of fact I have time remaining so I could afford to wait. I just waiting on God now. We're waiting for God because I do all that he asked me to do. I have all the requirements line upon line by faith holding on to his word. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So it is a seal signifies finished work. &gt;&gt; And when the seventh seal is broken, the mystery of God, that seal in these mysterious seals are finished. &gt;&gt; Until the day the seal is broke and then it's revealed what's on the inside of it. &gt;&gt; If the man is wondering what's in the box car say there is supposed to be such and such, there's supposed to be. He's presuming. But when the seal is broken &gt;&gt; and the door is open, we see into it and then see exactly what's in there. &gt;&gt; You see it? &gt;&gt; And that'll only be done at the end time. &gt;&gt; He want to see if you sell, &gt;&gt; if you give, if you follow. He want to see if you have full obedience to the word &gt;&gt; cuz that entitles you to the token. Amen. &gt;&gt; The musicians could could get ready. You see another thing a seal signifies is ownership. &gt;&gt; When you see that seal, you know where it came from. &gt;&gt; You know who that belongs to. &gt;&gt; The seal has a mark on it. The seal is not just a tie it up and somebody could untie it. No, it has a special identifier. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you're bought by the blood of Jesus, you're not just bought and well I buy you and I press on and I walk away. No. He want to put a unique identifier on you. &gt;&gt; That everybody knows &gt;&gt; you are special and he own you. &gt;&gt; He in charge of you so you could follow him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you're sealed by the Holy Ghost, you no longer belong to the world or anything pertaining to the world. You are owned by God. &gt;&gt; Another thing, a seal is a security. &gt;&gt; Seal means you're secured. &gt;&gt; Amen. You listen, you don't believe in eternal security. I don't know. But now a seal signifies security &gt;&gt; to its destination. &gt;&gt; So nobody could interfere with it. &gt;&gt; Nobody could could do so and do so and it choke some some something in and you don't know what's inside. No, it was sealed before taking the journey. &gt;&gt; So when it reach the destination, it should be in the same way. &gt;&gt; It should have the same contents. It should have the same thing on the inside. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; So he said the Holy Spirit seal cannot be broken. &gt;&gt; You all have heard me say that people said the devil made me do it. &gt;&gt; He said no. The devil didn't make you do it. &gt;&gt; I know some people never read this quote before. The devil didn't make you do it. Stop blaming the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The devil didn't make you do it. Hear what he said. &gt;&gt; He said you just wasn't sealed in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said cuz when you are sealed in He is sealed out. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now you went out to him. &gt;&gt; He couldn't get into you because the only way to get into you is to come through the same process that you have. &gt;&gt; He would have to be saved, sanctified, and filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Then he'd be your brother. &gt;&gt; So you see, he didn't do it. No. He just went to the borderline. You just went to the borderline and come back lusting for the things of the world. You never went all the way over into Canaan. you see across Jordan to death itself because you still want to hold on to these things. You still want to hold on to the title and the benefits and the accolades and all the acknowledgement and this one you know they really appreciate me so I feel good there. &gt;&gt; And what what did Jesus say? Sell it. &gt;&gt; Give to the poor. &gt;&gt; Don't worry about that. &gt;&gt; He listen he have you under control. &gt;&gt; He have you in order know he is Jehovah Gyra. He will provide everything you need. &gt;&gt; He will give. &gt;&gt; He will take care of you. He will see you through on this journey. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's play that song. Let your living water probably in D minor. He said education is fine. You should go to school and learn. You see, that's good, but it wouldn't save you. The education wouldn't save you. The knowledge wouldn't save you. The information wouldn't save you. to have plenty of money. That's good. You could raise your children, give them good clothes and things and like papa and mama has worked for you all and things. That's good. But it still wouldn't save you. [music] &gt;&gt; See, you could get in a lab, learn how to put different things together or split atoms or whatever lab folks do. You could get in a rocket and go to the moon, but those things wouldn't save you. You've got to face one thing. Just one, not two. You got to face eternal life. &gt;&gt; And there's only one person that could give that to you. Mama can't give it. Papa can't give it. Your pastor can't give it. Your leader can't give it. Everybody that gets eternal life has to come to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He's the only one who could give that part. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's stand tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] [singing] trouble my mind unto you I roll. Let's sing that verse again. Let your living water let it flow over my soul. said, "Let your Holy Spirit come and take control in every situation [singing and music] that troubled my mind." Listen.
