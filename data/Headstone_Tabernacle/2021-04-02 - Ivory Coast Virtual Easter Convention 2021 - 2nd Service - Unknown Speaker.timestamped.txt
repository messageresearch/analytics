[42:20] mark chapter 16
[42:24] reading from verse 15 to 18
[42:27] and he said unto them go into all the
[42:29] world and preach the gospel to every
[42:31] creature
[42:32] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[42:34] be saved
[42:36] but he that believeth not shall be down
[42:38] and these signs
[42:40] shall follow them that believe in my
[42:43] name shall they cast out devils we shall
[42:45] speak with new towns
[42:47] they shall take up serpents and if they
[42:49] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[42:51] them
[42:51] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[42:54] they shall recover
[42:56] god bless and good afternoon to each and
[42:59] every one of you
[43:01] who are looking at us on vote on virtual
[43:06] the virtual convention my name is
[43:09] brother timothy redhead
[43:10] from the island of grenada west indies
[43:14] the theme of the convention my
[43:17] understanding is
[43:19] manifestation of the sons of god as they
[43:21] were back in eden
[43:23] and the inspiration is the ministry of
[43:25] the bride and the ministry of christ
[43:28] are the same ministry brothers and
[43:31] sisters
[43:32] the team is defined as a subject
[43:35] of a talk or a sermon and inspiration is
[43:39] defined as the
[43:40] process of being mentally stimulated
[43:43] to do or to feel something creative
[43:47] and it is also timely it also means
[43:50] something that makes someone want to do
[43:53] something
[43:55] or give them an idea in other words
[43:58] it's stimulate one to act
[44:02] in this case we carry over the thought
[44:04] to manifest the terms
[44:07] at the one where this ministry is to be
[44:09] identified i
[44:10] i just read mark 16 15 to 18
[44:14] and these are the things that you are
[44:16] expecting in the ministry of sons
[44:20] of manifested sons and daughters of god
[44:27] we look far and wide today
[44:30] to try to identify where this ministry
[44:33] of christ
[44:34] with its signs and wonders are being
[44:36] demonstrated
[44:38] as in the book of acts and as in mark
[44:42] and after looking around i see much of
[44:44] the same
[44:46] eloquent words great emotions
[44:50] but hardly signs of that type of
[44:52] manifestation
[44:54] as it was in mark as it was
[44:58] in eden when adam give names to all the
[45:02] creatures
[45:03] of god brother paul i salute you for
[45:07] embarking upon such an excellent
[45:10] team this journey that is being
[45:12] spearheaded
[45:14] by anointed ordained sons of god
[45:18] but before we go forward i want you to
[45:20] just join me
[45:21] as we take a little trip imagine this
[45:24] scenario
[45:25] you're about to fly from cote d'ivoire
[45:28] to the caribbean
[45:30] and upon boarding the plane on its way
[45:32] to take off
[45:34] the intercom buzz alive
[45:37] with this announcement ladies and
[45:40] gentlemen
[45:41] welcome to flight 777 in command of the
[45:45] plainest captain anybody
[45:48] supported by first officer captain amen
[45:53] captain anybody has over 500
[45:56] hours of talking about planes
[45:59] plus 300 300 hours of looking at planes
[46:04] and a hundred hours of dreaming of
[46:06] planes
[46:08] today will be his first maiden voyage
[46:10] flying a plane
[46:11] let's give him a round of applause my
[46:14] brethren
[46:16] if i am on that plane i will ask to be
[46:18] taken off that plane because the
[46:19] information has not done
[46:21] anything to build my fate and confidence
[46:24] to fly on that plane
[46:26] the natural types the spiritual
[46:29] there comes a time when our message
[46:31] preach must take on a life
[46:34] not only to be acceptable towards
[46:37] salvation
[46:38] but in cast not of devils healing the
[46:40] sick even raising the dead
[46:43] loosen those who are born setting them
[46:45] free did
[46:46] this did jesus christ
[46:50] and we are supposed to be identified
[46:52] with that same ministry
[46:54] in this hour what have we done to
[46:57] measure up to this ministry
[46:59] the power is in the world and it's up to
[47:02] sons to have the dynamics come down upon
[47:04] the mechanics
[47:05] to give us the results
[47:08] when joshua was on his campaign
[47:12] to rid the land of the ice he
[47:14] encountered trouble on the way
[47:17] my brothers god is looking for men that
[47:20] he can put his trust in
[47:22] men who would listen to him are not to
[47:25] one another
[47:27] men who know god in his power the
[47:30] question today is
[47:31] where are these sons at men who care for
[47:34] the sheep enough to go down on their
[47:36] knees
[47:37] lie on their stomachs in order to get
[47:40] their egos out of the way that god can
[47:43] trust them
[47:44] who wouldn't get themselves full of
[47:46] pride and fame
[47:48] oh yes we need manifested sons as they
[47:51] were back in eden
[47:52] but it would not come by word only there
[47:55] has to be a consecration
[47:57] there has to be a dying note there has
[47:59] to be a lien done before god
[48:01] night on day night and day until we hear
[48:04] from him
[48:06] every revival that was sparked
[48:09] every son and every daughter that was
[48:12] manifested
[48:13] came about from prayer
[48:16] joshua sent his army to to view the land
[48:19] and they came back saying
[48:20] oh it's a small city we don't need to
[48:22] send everybody
[48:23] let's all just send about two to three
[48:24] legions of men and the legion is a
[48:26] thousand so that's about three thousand
[48:29] but without prayer or consecration they
[48:32] went and what happened
[48:33] they were beaten and driven back they
[48:36] had to get a red cross to go and help
[48:38] them with the 36 dead men that were on
[48:40] the ground
[48:42] this result prompted joshua to call a
[48:44] halt because the people's hearts were
[48:46] melted and became as water
[48:48] look around the message churches today
[48:51] and gage the hearts of the people
[48:53] gaze the the feelings of the people the
[48:57] frequency that is going through the
[48:58] church
[48:59] there's a lot of preaching and there's a
[49:01] lot of pulling but where are the signs
[49:03] and wonders to prove
[49:05] that jesus christ ministry is back with
[49:08] us
[49:09] and that is my greeting to you joshua
[49:12] rent his clothes and call up premeeting
[49:15] he fell
[49:16] upon his face before the ark of the lord
[49:18] until
[49:19] evening tithe most people could hardly
[49:21] make 20 minutes
[49:23] he and israel put dust upon their heads
[49:26] oh
[49:27] in his prayer he tried to put the blame
[49:29] on the law and many of us try to put
[49:31] them
[49:31] well god why are you not doing this and
[49:33] god why is this not being done but
[49:34] that's
[49:35] we put in the blame the wrong place he's
[49:38] not the one responsible for the defeat
[49:41] but the lord said unto him get up on
[49:42] your feet
[49:44] why liars down now you should have done
[49:47] that before
[49:48] before you went to fight then you would
[49:50] have known that there was sin in the
[49:52] camp
[49:53] and that the people that become too
[49:54] entangled in the things and the affairs
[49:56] of the world
[49:57] you can hardly tell the difference
[49:58] between a believer today and the people
[50:00] of the world we dress alike we talk
[50:01] alike we move alike
[50:02] the only places we go different is the
[50:04] church the prophet said when we bring
[50:07] the sick before god and they fail to get
[50:09] healed
[50:10] that becomes an issue so my challenge to
[50:13] you
[50:14] is to call us solemn assembly as joshua
[50:16] did
[50:18] and return back from whence we strayed
[50:21] for adventure god would intervene and
[50:23] come and perform among us
[50:25] that which we seek to have among us
[50:29] words are not enough painted pictures
[50:32] cannot
[50:32] warm us in snow time i challenge you
[50:36] brothers and sisters around the world
[50:39] men of god the dead angel is in the land
[50:43] and when the enemy come in like a flood
[50:45] god raises a standard where are the
[50:47] standards
[50:49] we don't want just standard bearers we
[50:51] want standards
[50:53] power power virtual power for service
[50:57] so i challenge you today and i challenge
[51:00] you the believers
[51:02] return from whence we came back to god
[51:05] back to pray
[51:06] back to being on our knees back to
[51:08] genuineness back to sincerity
[51:10] removed from the division removed from
[51:12] all this bias
[51:14] and discrimination and all the spirits
[51:16] that have entered into the message
[51:18] and let's go back to god and then just
[51:21] maybe
[51:22] we will see these manifested sons of god
[51:24] and we would not just be talking god
[51:27] but god will be talking back to us may
[51:30] god bless you

[1:00:36] nothing keeping back this resurrected
[1:00:38] christ promised to be among the bride
[1:00:41] oh blessed be the name of the lord so
[1:00:43] this morning i have a title

[1:01:06] rapport and the inspiration
[1:01:08] the manifestation of the sons of god as
[1:01:10] they were in the garden of eden
[1:01:12] and the other inspiration the ministry
[1:01:14] of the bride and the ministry of christ
[1:01:16] are the same ministry
[1:01:18] and that's actually an actual quote
[1:01:20] praise god from the prophet the minister
[1:01:21] of the bride
[1:01:22] and the ministry of christ is the same
[1:01:24] ministry oh glory to god and we are
[1:01:27] predestinated

[1:03:51] [Music]
[1:03:54] [Applause]
[1:03:56] promise seats
[1:03:59] that's what you are let's go back a
[1:04:02] little bit
[1:04:03] let's talk a little bit about the son of
[1:04:04] man anytime he has son of man you know
[1:04:06] he's a sower
[1:04:07] that's the first power but he's
[1:04:09] introduced he said a man saw seed
[1:04:11] some fell on three sides some fell among
[1:04:13] torns some fell on good ground some fell
[1:04:15] upon rocks
[1:04:16] and when the disciples asked him what
[1:04:18] you mean by that all this bible talk
[1:04:20] he said the saw he's the son of man
[1:04:23] hallelujah then another person said the
[1:04:26] seeds are the children of the kingdom
[1:04:29] so all of a sudden seeds become you come
[1:04:32] on now preach back to me
[1:04:34] oh glory to god hallelujah some fell
[1:04:36] here some fell dear
[1:04:38] but some fell on good ground so once you
[1:04:40] see santa man look for sowing
[1:04:43] wants to see sarah man look for seed so
[1:04:46] what happened in the beginning christ
[1:04:47] came
[1:04:48] the god prophet a son of man full of
[1:04:51] seeds
[1:04:52] full of the names all the names in the
[1:04:55] book
[1:04:56] because he was the book so son of man is
[1:04:58] logos word
[1:04:59] the book or give the lord a shout
[1:05:03] think about it now all the names locked
[1:05:07] up in solomon
[1:05:08] and the names come out as the word and
[1:05:11] the word is a seed
[1:05:13] and the seed is you
[1:05:14] [Applause]
[1:05:16] [Music]
[1:05:18] oh glory to god lord i hear you
[1:05:22] the seed is you
[1:05:27] now this is for a man so to bring back
[1:05:30] fallen man remember what he said born
[1:05:32] again right
[1:05:32] of word seed and spirit
[1:05:36] you say born again of the word alone you
[1:05:37] know you must be born again of the word
[1:05:40] and spirit so the word doesn't come
[1:05:44] first
[1:05:45] spirit coming after let me say it again
[1:05:48] word come first
[1:05:49] spirit come after jewish state it shall
[1:05:52] come to pass afterwards

[1:05:59] my spirit after i have restored
[1:06:02] it shall come to pass afterwards i will
[1:06:06] pour out my spirit
[1:06:07] young men shall see visions come on
[1:06:10] young men all men shall dream dreams
[1:06:12] upon my admins upon the sisters also
[1:06:16] will i pour out my spirit my people
[1:06:19] shall eat and be satisfied
[1:06:22] and praise the lord their god that heart
[1:06:25] dealt wondrously with them
[1:06:28] and my people shall never
[1:06:31] never never never never never
[1:06:34] never never never never never be ashamed
[1:06:38] or if you're oh glory to god i feel good
[1:06:41] this morning
[1:06:43] hallelujah let's continue
[1:06:46] oh glory to god so once you see son of
[1:06:49] man
[1:06:50] we see the sower we see the full body
[1:06:53] words sowing seeds
[1:06:55] because after sun a man you will see son
[1:06:58] of god so let's look at it this way
[1:07:01] son of man called disciples
[1:07:05] see them done with the promise they went
[1:07:07] into the upper room
[1:07:09] and received the spirit to manifest the
[1:07:12] seed that they
[1:07:12] are so peter step out apostle peter
[1:07:17] spokesman peter in other words god begin
[1:07:19] to move
[1:07:21] because the seas is coming alive the
[1:07:23] seas has been planted
[1:07:25] and i'm going to prove to you it's
[1:07:27] impossible
[1:07:29] for you not to come forward
[1:07:33] i'm not hoping you're comfortable it is
[1:07:35] impossible
[1:07:36] for if not to happen look at the pattern
[1:07:39] son of man then sons of god
[1:07:43] write in another book of acts then son
[1:07:46] of god
[1:07:47] through seven churches
[1:07:50] are you hearing me because the church
[1:07:53] fell away
[1:07:54] so the son of god was he that stand it
[1:07:58] or walk it amidst the seven golden
[1:08:01] candlesticks
[1:08:02] so all through the seven golden
[1:08:04] candlesticks which is the seven ages
[1:08:06] he was walking i know thy works
[1:08:10] i know and i know and i know he was
[1:08:13] walking back and forth
[1:08:15] to the seven golden candlesticks knowing
[1:08:17] at the end time
[1:08:19] there will be a promise of sonoma again
[1:08:22] according to luke 17 30 to be revealed
[1:08:25] again
[1:08:26] so once we get back to solomon when you
[1:08:29] look again
[1:08:30] you're going to see son of god coming
[1:08:31] forth so god sent william branham
[1:08:34] according to malachi 4 behold i sent you
[1:08:37] elijah
[1:08:38] and god was veiling that prophet
[1:08:41] according to luke 17 30
[1:08:43] to bring back son of man again but this
[1:08:46] time
[1:08:46] all the scattered word that was
[1:08:49] scattered through all the seven ages
[1:08:50] he come and gathered him up and bring
[1:08:53] back solomon
[1:08:54] full body word pregnant with god
[1:08:58] pregnant with seeds pregnant with names
[1:09:01] that was the burden upon william marion
[1:09:03] branham as an adopted son
[1:09:06] you have to come to speak the word
[1:09:08] because only your spoken word
[1:09:10] could bring you forth because only your
[1:09:12] spoken word
[1:09:13] is your original seed no church could
[1:09:16] bring your thought
[1:09:17] or give the lord a shout you have to
[1:09:20] come by original seed
[1:09:21] you have to come from the mouth of god
[1:09:28] [Applause]
[1:09:30] do you get that maybe see that all
[1:09:34] through the ages was the normation of
[1:09:35] spirit
[1:09:36] pathway pat revelation the son of man
[1:09:40] could only be son of man when he could
[1:09:42] gather up
[1:09:43] all the word to bring him back to full
[1:09:46] seed
[1:09:47] because god equivalent plant don't have
[1:09:48] seed if we have to have manifest sons
[1:09:52] like in the beginning like the early
[1:09:54] church
[1:09:55] we have to have solomon bringing full
[1:09:58] seed
[1:09:58] which is the full revelation of the
[1:10:02] mind of god what he told daniel go thy
[1:10:05] way
[1:10:05] the book is sealed till the time of the
[1:10:08] end because at the end of time
[1:10:10] i have some sons some born sons
[1:10:13] some sons that could be seed sons some
[1:10:15] children of the kingdom
[1:10:17] they have to get the full body word they
[1:10:19] have to be seated on
[1:10:20] and all these years god was trying to
[1:10:23] put the season to you
[1:10:25] and the secret is the word
[1:10:28] oh do you know where i'm going the word
[1:10:31] is in the bride so god put the word in
[1:10:34] you
[1:10:35] word without life word with potential
[1:10:39] word leading water word needing life
[1:10:43] word needing dynamics word needing
[1:10:45] inspiration
[1:10:47] oh glory to god remember this
[1:10:50] the age past gone the pentecostal age
[1:10:54] dynamics fell dynamic is the holy ghost
[1:10:58] the holy ghost fell but it couldn't
[1:11:01] produce the adoption of sons
[1:11:03] it couldn't preserve men to cry abba
[1:11:05] father because they didn't have the word
[1:11:08] the word wasn't restored yet so they
[1:11:11] couldn't come to perfection
[1:11:13] because you could only come to
[1:11:14] perfection by the word which is the seed
[1:11:17] that has to come inside of you oh glory
[1:11:20] to god listen
[1:11:21] so far we are talking about church we're
[1:11:23] not talking about group
[1:11:25] come on now preach back to me we're not
[1:11:27] talking about church
[1:11:28] we're not talking about group we're
[1:11:31] talking about what it has in the garden
[1:11:32] of eden
[1:11:33] which was a son of god standing
[1:11:36] represented god
[1:11:38] god said god of heaven you will be the
[1:11:40] quarter of the earth
[1:11:42] you represent me on earth with my intent
[1:11:45] with my purpose with my vision with my
[1:11:48] objective and motive
[1:11:50] you as a son represent me on the earth
[1:11:53] whatever your name
[1:11:55] is the name thereof oh glory to god
[1:11:59] adam was the son of god i remember the
[1:12:01] son of god under god
[1:12:03] and this message as a hidden mystery
[1:12:06] inside this message
[1:12:07] is wrapped up the return of the sons of
[1:12:11] god
[1:12:12] back into position and there has to be a
[1:12:14] way
[1:12:15] for us to get back and that way is the
[1:12:18] [Applause]
[1:12:20] blood
[1:12:22] maybe see that not just the blood they
[1:12:26] say jesus died for you
[1:12:27] but the blood to prove that you are
[1:12:30] justified
[1:12:32] [Applause]
[1:12:34] as if it never did sin i know that hard
[1:12:38] for the human mind to accept and grasp
[1:12:40] but that is a revelation
[1:12:42] you hear what i said that is a
[1:12:44] revelation
[1:12:45] god had to reveal that to you that you
[1:12:47] never did it in the first place
[1:12:49] because you see it's god's business when
[1:12:51] god sees you clean
[1:12:52] you see you clean when god you justify
[1:12:55] he see you justify
[1:12:56] when your saints drop in the sea of
[1:12:57] forgetfulness a drop devil can't fish in
[1:13:00] the but the devil cap on the fish and
[1:13:02] string and try to pull it up
[1:13:04] he crazy he know the name of that seal
[1:13:07] the name of that is the sea of
[1:13:08] forgetfulness god set it up
[1:13:11] that when god put that in his trash can
[1:13:13] he himself can't undelete it
[1:13:15] and do it he can't even fish it of
[1:13:17] himself or give the lord some praises
[1:13:20] when god put that in the sea all this
[1:13:23] will make everybody shout
[1:13:24] when god put that in the sea the name of
[1:13:27] it the sea of forgetfulness
[1:13:29] not just forgetting no forgetfulness
[1:13:32] every time you try to remember you
[1:13:33] forget
[1:13:34] every time you think about it you forget
[1:13:36] when you're looking at it you can't see
[1:13:37] it
[1:13:38] you scrape you dig you push your hand
[1:13:40] your feel
[1:13:41] is not there because you are justified
[1:13:44] as if you never did it and that
[1:13:46] justification
[1:13:47] brings us back into the illegal
[1:13:49] condition
[1:13:50] [Applause]
[1:13:53] [Music]
[1:13:54] god is not full he will only devote to
[1:13:57] matter
[1:13:58] god the devil children adam and eve
[1:14:00] negan
[1:14:01] and that's my god put man he must get
[1:14:04] back monday
[1:14:05] god have to win this race and the only
[1:14:07] way he could do it is through the blood
[1:14:09] he couldn't send an angel he came among
[1:14:11] himself to play a blood price that you
[1:14:13] could get back
[1:14:14] the only reason we have access to his
[1:14:16] presence this morning is by the blood
[1:14:18] is that you pray last night is that you
[1:14:20] in the message
[1:14:21] is that people in the message have no
[1:14:23] access to presence it's not to believe
[1:14:25] what a random is that people believe
[1:14:26] about ramen and who have not tested
[1:14:27] presence
[1:14:28] all glory to god access to presence is
[1:14:30] by blood
[1:14:31] [Music]
[1:14:35] access to presence is by blood
[1:14:40] if you didn't need the blood you didn't
[1:14:42] need just to die
[1:14:43] just need to read your bible and chill
[1:14:48] but because jesus paid a price
[1:14:52] and opened my door that sons of god who
[1:14:55] want to go free
[1:14:57] oh my all right praise god
[1:15:01] son of man isn't that right luke 17 20.
[1:15:06] promise to come back again in the
[1:15:08] beginning son of man jesus
[1:15:10] dropped promises in them the same works
[1:15:12] i do shall you do also
[1:15:14] if you shall say this wrong to be move
[1:15:15] on the dog in your heart you can have
[1:15:17] what you're saying
[1:15:18] what does son of man do and giving them
[1:15:19] seeds they're ready for it yet they no
[1:15:21] condition to
[1:15:22] activate it yet but you have to give it
[1:15:23] to them because that is what they could
[1:15:25] become
[1:15:26] you see god will wait till you're ready
[1:15:28] he give it to you before you're ready
[1:15:29] that's why he anointed david to be king
[1:15:32] before david was even ready to be king
[1:15:34] god put the anointing upon him so that's
[1:15:36] why i'm saying there is no way you could
[1:15:38] miss this
[1:15:38] because god already plays that will
[1:15:40] already place
[1:15:42] that spirit upon you it's upon you it's
[1:15:44] what you call the spirit of adoption
[1:15:46] that spirit that's what bring it to the
[1:15:48] word that's what bring it to the message
[1:15:50] god there bring in the message of warmer
[1:15:52] church bench and say in this church
[1:15:54] no no no no no no no god bring you to
[1:15:56] this message to be adopted
[1:15:58] that's the purpose you want adopted sons
[1:16:00] you don't understand adopted sons mean
[1:16:03] face in the devil's face adapted since
[1:16:05] means
[1:16:06] your foot on the devil's neck adopted
[1:16:08] sun speeds will retain
[1:16:10] back be taken back from the terror
[1:16:21] so you know what god's saying i live in
[1:16:22] that drama to my sons idiot
[1:16:25] that last day fight and drama i'm
[1:16:27] leaving that to my sons
[1:16:29] wait till they could sign just like me
[1:16:31] wait till this signature is just like
[1:16:32] the father wait till they have the
[1:16:34] authority
[1:16:35] and they're preaching the word with
[1:16:36] power with signs with wonders and
[1:16:38] miracles
[1:16:39] and just wait wait till you see that you
[1:16:41] have seen nothing yet
[1:16:42] that's why the bible sits still until
[1:16:44] the spirit moves
[1:16:45] until the spirit
[1:16:49] nothing happened until the spirit began
[1:16:52] to move
[1:16:53] the world i see the bride and actually
[1:16:55] now they think we believe in books and
[1:16:57] tapes and hearing a prophet and saying
[1:16:58] that stuff that's what they think
[1:17:00] but one day right timing walk into the
[1:17:03] temple
[1:17:04] the spirit is upon me for he has
[1:17:06] anointed me
[1:17:08] for glory to god and once your anointing
[1:17:11] come
[1:17:11] devil look out or give the lord a shout
[1:17:17] [Applause]
[1:17:25] that anointing is the notion of your
[1:17:27] name you know
[1:17:32] when i call her name john jones if john
[1:17:34] jones is here he alone could respond to
[1:17:36] that
[1:17:37] he knows his name he's not talking about
[1:17:39] nobody else
[1:17:40] he can look around as they go by
[1:17:41] somebody and says john jones
[1:17:43] and when god call your name release the
[1:17:45] anointing of your name
[1:17:47] there is nothing like a man on his name
[1:17:50] the power behind your
[1:17:51] name oh glory to god you call me
[1:17:55] yes it's me oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:17:58] praise god
[1:17:59] i heard my name
[1:18:00] [Applause]
[1:18:05] i heard it i heard it
[1:18:08] when john saw his name oh glory the book
[1:18:12] was spinning
[1:18:13] seals was breaking john was looking
[1:18:16] all of a sudden he saw his name he said
[1:18:18] glory he said hallelujah
[1:18:21] john began to get on
[1:18:26] you know the first thing john said we
[1:18:30] shall reign on the earth the reign is to
[1:18:33] conquer
[1:18:34] the rule to dominate or glory to god and
[1:18:37] you're going to conquer

[1:18:41] dominate right here
[1:18:42] in your heart on your earth
[1:18:46] in your environment and circumstance oh
[1:18:48] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:18:56] up to now we are talking about church we
[1:18:58] ain't talking about group
[1:19:00] we are talking about message people we
[1:19:02] talking that
[1:19:04] listen but abandoned behold i send the
[1:19:06] promise of my father upon you this is

[1:19:14] high
[1:19:16] so if all this seed word and
[1:19:19] predestinated mystery was in peter
[1:19:22] and all these brethren why would they
[1:19:25] still have to wait
[1:19:26] until jesus opened their understanding
[1:19:30] to the scriptures
[1:19:32] they know the word they know the promise
[1:19:34] they know the history they know what god
[1:19:36] said
[1:19:37] and yet you tell them wait because what
[1:19:40] you have can't make it
[1:19:42] what you have not good enough i know you
[1:19:44] are promising because you receive me
[1:19:46] you receive my words but the promised
[1:19:48] seeds have a promise of life
[1:19:50] and hallelujah life is the holy ghost

[1:20:18] be predestined to this morning
[1:20:20] how many know their words he's this
[1:20:21] morning how many know they are called of
[1:20:23] god
[1:20:24] and the devil didn't call you but god
[1:20:26] himself called you
[1:20:27] oh glory to god but you were promised
[1:20:29] seed that have the promise of life
[1:20:32] oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah
[1:20:37] i'm not just talking about life for you
[1:20:39] i know in life for your host
[1:20:41] life for your children life for your
[1:20:43] family or glory to god praise god says
[1:20:46] the hearty right
[1:20:47] he said i give you your two sons in the
[1:20:50] name of jesus christ
[1:20:52] life came out the mouth of the prophet
[1:20:55] life will come on your mouth
[1:20:57] he came that you might have life and
[1:21:00] have it more abundantly
[1:21:02] when this word turned to spirit when
[1:21:04] this word turned to power
[1:21:06] when this word turned to life he said he
[1:21:09] that believeth on me
[1:21:11] as the scripture had said i ain't
[1:21:13] talking no pastor
[1:21:14] i ain't talking about no bishop i am
[1:21:16] talking about he that believe it on me
[1:21:18] as the scripture had said out of his
[1:21:21] belly
[1:21:22] shall flow rivers of living water oh
[1:21:25] glory though that was a prophecy
[1:21:27] because the holy ghost was not yet given
[1:21:29] because jesus did not died
[1:21:31] had not died her glory looked good but
[1:21:34] once he died
[1:21:36] spirit was released
[1:21:43] remember if the devil could go back and
[1:21:46] forth
[1:21:47] on the eighth to one through your spirit
[1:21:50] that god can't go back and forth and yet
[1:21:52] come on now just as lucifer going back
[1:21:56] and forth on the earth
[1:21:57] he's going back and forth the spirit of
[1:21:59] god he's going back and forth in
[1:22:01] trinidad
[1:22:02] going in this home going in this house

[1:22:18] back unfold spirit
[1:22:22] that's not the pastor watching you now
[1:22:25] that's the spirit
[1:22:26] so here we go now to show
[1:22:29] not only did he draw all the benefits
[1:22:31] out of it but he shared
[1:22:33] those benefits he come to redeem
[1:22:36] watch or oh this is beautiful
[1:22:40] to bring to life
[1:22:43] doors predestinated seed
[1:22:46] that god seen before the foundation of
[1:22:48] the world and put their names in the
[1:22:50] book of life
[1:22:51] and here they are on the earth without a
[1:22:53] hope he came not only to be the blessing
[1:22:55] but to share the blessing
[1:23:00] peter seed of god woman of the well
[1:23:04] seed of god andrew james john seeds of
[1:23:07] god
[1:23:08] predestinated seeds that god has
[1:23:10] ordained
[1:23:11] the life soil seed of god
[1:23:15] persecuting the church but predestinated
[1:23:18] to receive life you can't tell god
[1:23:22] how to be destinated you can't tell god
[1:23:25] who to put it in
[1:23:30] he could put it in a drunkard put it in
[1:23:32] a prostitute
[1:23:34] put it in your grandmother your
[1:23:35] grandfather
[1:23:37] put it in a wicked man oh glory to god
[1:23:40] hallelujah
[1:23:41] when god finished with him all the
[1:23:43] wickedness come out oh give the lord a
[1:23:45] shout jacob i love
[1:23:49] he so i hate david was
[1:23:54] i've been going to it you know the kind
[1:23:56] of man who jacob
[1:23:57] jacob was he wasn't easy
[1:24:02] imagine jacob in this church
[1:24:07] and all they're hearing is complaints
[1:24:09] complaints completely rip off this one
[1:24:11] and you still come to church rip off
[1:24:13] that one you come to church
[1:24:18] when the pastor and the preacher said
[1:24:19] turn around and greet your brother
[1:24:20] tonight and see jacob
[1:24:22] and he rip you off
[1:24:26] and you hold your hand like that
[1:24:31] because jesus called you and jesus
[1:24:32] called him too
[1:24:36] and again i fight like if you know more
[1:24:38] than god should i shouldn't die
[1:24:44] first corinthians 3 5 to 8.
[1:24:48] paul speaking who then is paul it's paul
[1:24:50] talking
[1:24:51] who is apollos but ministers by whom he
[1:24:54] believed
[1:24:56] even as the lord give to every man i
[1:24:59] have
[1:24:59] planted apollos watered
[1:25:03] but god gave the increase
[1:25:06] so god revealed here a mystery of the
[1:25:09] seed
[1:25:10] it has to be planted it has to be water
[1:25:13] and gold have to give the increase if
[1:25:15] you don't plant you cut water
[1:25:18] if you don't water you can't get no
[1:25:19] breaking fault water is spirit
[1:25:22] water is life seed is weird
[1:25:26] seed is dramatized you are dramatized
[1:25:29] because you had representation
[1:25:31] by predestination and the germ is in you
[1:25:35] since your partying since you were
[1:25:37] smoking and drinking and fettered
[1:25:39] it was there the devil didn't know it if
[1:25:42] he knew it he was gonna leave you a long
[1:25:44] time ago
[1:25:44] but he thought he was one of his and god
[1:25:47] said no that is one of mines
[1:25:49] or give the lord a shout so when god
[1:25:51] take his spirit
[1:25:53] and throw it on you all them things
[1:25:56] that'll fall off
[1:25:57] because there was something deeper than
[1:25:59] that deeper than flesh
[1:26:01] deeper than human spirit deeper than a
[1:26:04] human element
[1:26:05] that's something in your soul your
[1:26:07] husband can't get there
[1:26:09] madness can't even get you little go
[1:26:11] plume of the rockers
[1:26:13] that mental thing can get there oh give
[1:26:15] the lord a shout in the house
[1:26:17] come on now nothing can't stop that
[1:26:20] you lost your husband that you're gonna
[1:26:22] stop that you're lost white that they're
[1:26:24] gonna stop that
[1:26:25] you lost boyfriend kill friend then
[1:26:26] you're gonna stop that you have a job
[1:26:28] daddy gonna stop that you don't have a
[1:26:30] job nothing will stop that
[1:26:31] you lost your job that wouldn't stop
[1:26:34] that
[1:26:37] because you are seed of god you have no
[1:26:40] education that is stopping that either
[1:26:42] because peter wasn't learned didn't stop
[1:26:45] that
[1:26:46] oh my he said i have planted
[1:26:50] apollos watered but god gave the
[1:26:52] increase
[1:26:53] so there neither is he that planted
[1:26:54] anything neither he that water it
[1:26:57] but god that give it increase now he had
[1:26:59] planted he that water it a one
[1:27:01] and every man shall receive his own
[1:27:03] reward
[1:27:04] according to his word so therefore
[1:27:07] the seeds that were sown by this prophet
[1:27:10] of willem branagh who wrote the vision
[1:27:12] had to be watered by the ministers
[1:27:15] that he put on the earth water what the
[1:27:18] same seeds
[1:27:19] we can't bring our own seeds we're
[1:27:21] supposed to be enochs
[1:27:23] you knock spiritual eunuchs we don't
[1:27:25] bring our own revelation
[1:27:27] to show how revelated we are i know
[1:27:29] that's not a word we have to bring the
[1:27:31] same seeds
[1:27:32] because man shall only rebread alone but
[1:27:34] out of the mouth of god the seed that
[1:27:36] come with the mouth of god
[1:27:37] so when god sends son a man yes his son
[1:27:40] man from eating stupid words
[1:27:41] i hear to say the same thing i'm an echo
[1:27:46] yeah yeah i'mma echo what the prophet
[1:27:48] said because i have a revelation
[1:27:49] these are the seeds that the spirit is
[1:27:51] looking for
[1:27:54] you see the spirit that was there in
[1:27:56] that prophet
[1:27:57] know the seeds that went off his mouth
[1:28:00] so when the spirit return
[1:28:02] is looking for them seeds
[1:28:10] so a man planted my toes here coming
[1:28:12] look at the lettuce
[1:28:14] you're looking for a fig here looking
[1:28:16] for guava
[1:28:17] it's pissed tomatoes he plant he watered
[1:28:19] him and he said i go overplan he said
[1:28:21] who planned that is that enemy
[1:28:23] plant everything else trying to tap the
[1:28:25] man field it's tomatoes you're looking
[1:28:26] for
[1:28:27] well god planted orange tree and the
[1:28:30] devil cut it down
[1:28:31] and as it as they cut so then others
[1:28:33] come and graft them grapefruit and lemon
[1:28:35] and tangelo and they keep grafting but
[1:28:37] the tree keep growing
[1:28:38] you can restore you cast up the tree but
[1:28:40] then after a while
[1:28:42] he said praise god when that come to the
[1:28:44] end
[1:28:45] and put forth another listen original
[1:28:48] branch
[1:28:50] and every minister that went off track
[1:28:52] the spirit can't fall dear
[1:28:53] to produce an original because original
[1:28:57] can't go to spirit first you have to go
[1:28:58] to wordpress
[1:29:00] ah because the spirit falls on
[1:29:03] everything
[1:29:06] oh glory to god so to come back to
[1:29:09] perfect seed
[1:29:10] you have to come back to original which
[1:29:13] is
[1:29:13] god said so
[1:29:17] that is what this prophet represents
[1:29:21] thou seek the lord
[1:29:24] so i don't care to penny about
[1:29:26] somebody's interpretation of what the
[1:29:27] prophet said
[1:29:28] because god is his own interpreter oh
[1:29:31] glory to god
[1:29:32] so watch the ministers were supposed to
[1:29:36] water the seeds until the time appointed
[1:29:39] so here's what the prophet said just
[1:29:40] beautifully he said when the enemy come
[1:29:41] in like a flood
[1:29:43] the spirit of god would raise a standard
[1:29:46] now watch that song's general and that
[1:29:48] song is powerful
[1:29:49] but when he put it in context he said
[1:29:51] what does he do
[1:29:52] he said take the same word and make it
[1:29:55] more positive
[1:29:56] why because the time is long but the
[1:29:59] vision is true
[1:30:01] so if the time is long and the vision is
[1:30:03] true you have to be quickened
[1:30:05] to see this world as positive in other
[1:30:08] words i am just
[1:30:09] as strong as when i first started out my
[1:30:12] faith is not waxing poor
[1:30:14] every day is going stronger i'm not
[1:30:17] going to stagger at the promise of god
[1:30:19] through unbelief
[1:30:21] because of revelation i'm a promised
[1:30:22] seed and i have a promise of life
[1:30:26] not pentecostal life
[1:30:31] no other life will work in her this
[1:30:34] bride you can't put not two volt battery
[1:30:36] has had a timeless engine it's ain't
[1:30:38] gonna work you have to get the right
[1:30:40] power
[1:30:41] because this engine is a ticket to the
[1:30:43] rapture
[1:30:44] so he said no other life will work what
[1:30:47] is he talking about the life of charity
[1:30:50] [Music]
[1:30:52] you don't hear much about that but
[1:30:54] that's the life
[1:30:56] life of charity the life of the spirit
[1:31:00] not the small measure part not the
[1:31:02] spirit of adoption part
[1:31:03] but the dynamic part that produces seven
[1:31:06] live voices
[1:31:08] that the devil recognized any time them
[1:31:10] forces are to live
[1:31:11] the devil is seated like a badge it's
[1:31:13] like identification mark
[1:31:15] it's something that like oh god look he
[1:31:16] come in he come in the community come in
[1:31:17] move
[1:31:18] movie coming you see it before he felt
[1:31:21] power before
[1:31:22] he know when that voice come walking
[1:31:24] anytime that voice come walking
[1:31:26] devil have to go high running oh glory
[1:31:29] the guardian conquered the light before
[1:31:31] and the life was manifested oh glory to
[1:31:34] god and there's going to be a bride
[1:31:35] they're going to manifest this life i
[1:31:37] look at my devils in half
[1:31:39] i look at my sex spirited half i reckon
[1:31:41] which
[1:31:43] become pornography on the internet in
[1:31:44] half i don't care what kind of demon
[1:31:46] glory they'll call the life will be
[1:31:48] manifested
[1:31:50] [Applause]
[1:31:54] their life not a life
[1:31:58] the life
[1:32:01] glory the god so the watering of the
[1:32:04] seed
[1:32:06] which you are is until the time
[1:32:09] appointed
[1:32:11] god told daniel the vision was long
[1:32:13] hallelujah the time was long
[1:32:15] but the vision was true we written years
[1:32:18] now
[1:32:19] eyewitnesses 1975.
[1:32:23] so don't complain if you come in two
[1:32:25] three years ago and four years ago and
[1:32:26] five years ten years ago
[1:32:28] are you breathing longer than you
[1:32:31] don't complain when i started my hair
[1:32:33] was black and going green now

[1:32:40] until not wait until your pastor get a
[1:32:44] better suit

[1:32:47] suit that's okay
[1:32:48] wait until you're enjoying power from on
[1:32:51] high
[1:32:52] when will you receive power when your
[1:32:54] pastor give you a book
[1:32:56] when you listen to that message on the
[1:32:57] tablet that's not when you're getting
[1:32:59] power
[1:33:00] when you listen to all the messages they
[1:33:01] know when they're getting power you
[1:33:02] charity power
[1:33:04] after after
[1:33:08] oh glory to god let a mystery around
[1:33:10] that let them teach around that
[1:33:12] let them explain that away when you will
[1:33:14] get power

[1:33:22] minister sermon after

[1:33:33] i say the holy ghost the holy ghost the
[1:33:36] holy ghost
[1:33:37] got to come upon you but you have a
[1:33:40] promise
[1:33:41] because you are promised seed with the
[1:33:43] promise of life
[1:33:44] that's what easter proved he was not
[1:33:47] only mechanics
[1:33:48] but he was the dynamics in the world
[1:33:51] to make it manifest what glory to god
[1:33:55] amen
[1:33:59] [Music]
[1:34:02] amen
[1:34:06] but banana says this
[1:34:10] we are the end time the seeds are sown
[1:34:13] now the latter rain is fixed into
[1:34:17] he'd have no promise at la terrain of no
[1:34:19] seeds there god will only talk about
[1:34:21] later if the season's in the ground
[1:34:23] that we can expect clattering when i
[1:34:25] found my plan to see there's no rain
[1:34:27] you have to wait for rain it could be
[1:34:28] rain rain rain sing rain whole day
[1:34:31] until the season change for rain you
[1:34:33] have to wait for rain
[1:34:34] because rain seed on the seed to begin
[1:34:37] to bring it forth
[1:34:38] it's online but here is prophecy
[1:34:41] remember
[1:34:42] there will be such a denominational
[1:34:44] gathering pretty soon it will be
[1:34:46] terrific
[1:34:47] and they will bring themselves together
[1:34:50] into this federation of churches
[1:34:52] then this kind of church will be put out
[1:34:54] of operation
[1:34:55] as far as they know at that time
[1:34:59] jesus will appear and he will show
[1:35:02] which is bride and which is not
[1:35:06] remember christian friends i'm a man i
[1:35:08] can make mistakes
[1:35:10] many muslims don't talk that okay the
[1:35:12] prophet talking that talk many men are
[1:35:14] making no mistakes at all
[1:35:15] they on their own i'm a man i can make
[1:35:18] mistakes
[1:35:19] but god being god cannot
[1:35:22] make a mistake all the words that have
[1:35:25] been written
[1:35:27] must be fulfilled jesus said so
[1:35:30] so we have got things here in the
[1:35:32] scripture that
[1:35:33] must be fulfilled and that is one of the
[1:35:36] things this boycott
[1:35:38] to come are you ready now but before
[1:35:42] this boycott can come
[1:35:46] this is before now so don't jump the
[1:35:48] boycott
[1:35:49] don't say the comment that commented
[1:35:50] coming you're no one with that
[1:35:52] i am talking about before before
[1:35:56] this project can come of the marking of
[1:35:59] the beast
[1:36:00] there has to be a seed sold
[1:36:03] for god to take a church out of it
[1:36:05] [Applause]
[1:36:08] and that's what i'm saying take a closer
[1:36:10] look because we are boxing tip that is
[1:36:12] foolishness
[1:36:15] that is not how you get close down
[1:36:17] they're closing on because christ has
[1:36:19] been
[1:36:19] manifest and denominations go can't
[1:36:24] handle it
[1:36:27] [Applause]
[1:36:32] won't we tell you what we could have a
[1:36:33] book
[1:36:36] that that could do something enemy
[1:36:38] laughing and put books on tapes
[1:36:40] you had to become the book manifested
[1:36:42] tape manifested
[1:36:44] word manifested and the only way that
[1:36:46] could be done is by power
[1:36:52] so what did the prophet said national
[1:36:54] force put israel in
[1:36:57] back in the homeland national forest
[1:36:59] will put the churches in the world
[1:37:00] council churches
[1:37:01] but the power of god will put the people
[1:37:04] in the bride

[1:38:51] sworn for this day
[1:38:52] oh you mean the seed must not just be
[1:38:55] sown
[1:38:56] no you'd have to get ripe oh how that
[1:38:59] makes it different now
[1:39:00] yeah there's no scary wacker coming and
[1:39:02] running out but i said they had a
[1:39:03] harvest no
[1:39:05] that my god had the hot sun for that my
[1:39:08] god have hot trials
[1:39:10] that my god have her testing for to see
[1:39:13] how the heat
[1:39:14] hits in your seed but if it dry up fast
[1:39:17] it's not that you i don't want to die
[1:39:18] see you know because you see the shot
[1:39:20] that's dry up fast
[1:39:21] but the sea does get golden brown when
[1:39:24] the sun hit it so when this devil think
[1:39:27] that what he coming at you is to dry you
[1:39:30] up and pack you up and make you give up
[1:39:32] he don't understand you are being
[1:39:33] ripened by the heat that is around you
[1:39:37] you flip the script on him you say i'm
[1:39:39] not giving up
[1:39:40] i'm not backsiding i'm too close to the
[1:39:42] finish line
[1:39:44] [Applause]
[1:39:46] is a man digging for gold he diggy
[1:39:48] digging going down 10 feet 12 feet 20
[1:39:50] feet
[1:39:50] and he tired for the picture of me folk
[1:39:52] i don't the night on me a final goal
[1:39:54] and somebody come and they do so clicks
[1:39:57] go right under there
[1:39:58] that's where we at right now we right by
[1:40:01] the goal
[1:40:02] we write by the power we write by the
[1:40:04] anointed
[1:40:05] we write by dynamics don't give up now
[1:40:10] [Applause]
[1:40:13] don't give up you promise to send you
[1:40:16] have any light
[1:40:17] right in the world see that will be sown
[1:40:18] for this day the seed
[1:40:20] is in here are you ready
[1:40:25] the seed is the bible jesus already tell
[1:40:29] them
[1:40:30] when a man said come here don't go after
[1:40:32] them
[1:40:33] lordy kingdom here don't go follow them
[1:40:38] chinese draw these cyborgs under
[1:40:39] themselves listen to what he said the
[1:40:41] seed is the bible
[1:40:43] why jesus said so the word is i see the
[1:40:45] source so now
[1:40:46] you can have before you can have any
[1:40:48] crop no matter how you sow the seed
[1:40:50] it's got to have light to ripen that
[1:40:53] seed
[1:40:54] oil rot it won't do no good will perish
[1:40:57] but if it's got seed in the ground the
[1:40:58] right ground
[1:40:59] with the right kind of sunlight on it
[1:41:01] it's got to ripen and he promised that
[1:41:03] in the last days in the evening time
[1:41:05] the sun would come out to write in that
[1:41:06] seed the seed is being preached
[1:41:12] so all them who don't want preachers the
[1:41:13] unknown they're heading straight for the
[1:41:16] tribulation
[1:41:17] without oil because the oil is a seed
[1:41:19] and you turn in the spirit
[1:41:22] thereby the foolish version never get
[1:41:23] the oil because the oil is what common
[1:41:26] to you
[1:41:26] now in wood form
[1:41:33] so the foolish version can't take the
[1:41:34] word therefore they can't get the spirit
[1:41:36] because the word and spirit is one you
[1:41:38] can't reject the word and expect to get
[1:41:40] spirit
[1:41:40] nice pentecostals i had shut up
[1:41:43] television
[1:41:43] talking tongues and the dead of the
[1:41:45] world that's not the word the spirit
[1:41:48] as if you said the rain doesn't fall on
[1:41:49] the matter tree or alone it fall in mind
[1:41:52] one or two two
[1:41:53] the rain does fall everyone says
[1:41:56] touching the marijuana no the rain
[1:41:57] doesn't do that
[1:41:58] the rain just fall it's not the rain
[1:42:00] it's the seed
[1:42:03] don't fight up with the rain make sure
[1:42:06] you have the right seed
[1:42:09] and the scene have to have the right
[1:42:10] soil or ground or heart
[1:42:12] or condition you're angry you mean
[1:42:15] you're hateful you're bitter you have
[1:42:17] issues on what that you're on your own
[1:42:19] we're too far down the road we have not

[1:44:11] proved it in all the days of the
[1:44:12] apostles he proved it now when this day

[1:44:51] then when christ had his crucifixion
[1:44:53] the with him and his resurrection we are
[1:44:55] beneficiaries
[1:44:56] quickened after being dead in darkness
[1:44:58] oh glory to god
[1:45:00] you say oh god we are hungry and
[1:45:02] twisting for god we joined them better
[1:45:03] this baptist pentecostal there was still
[1:45:05] something wrong
[1:45:06] we just couldn't find it and all of a
[1:45:08] sudden while we are groping in darkness
[1:45:10] the great
[1:45:11] resurrection came to us in the
[1:45:13] manifestation of the promised wood of
[1:45:14] god
[1:45:15] oh god he wanted us to look for that
[1:45:17] manifestation if everybody come
[1:45:19] in such an expectation he said the bride
[1:45:21] had no revivalist yet
[1:45:22] there have been no manifestation of god
[1:45:24] to steal the bride
[1:45:26] oh god it will take them seven thunders
[1:45:28] he promised it he would send it
[1:45:30] if the people would forget decrees and
[1:45:31] dogmas and plead the promises it will
[1:45:33] become effective to them
[1:45:35] and right now this morning we are
[1:45:36] peeling the promises you
[1:45:38] here oh glory to god i had the promise
[1:45:41] of god
[1:45:42] promises of god with a promise on top of
[1:45:44] promise
[1:45:45] god promised you and on top of you from
[1:45:47] his life the devil is in trouble this
[1:45:49] morning
[1:45:50] the bride gonna have the life oh because
[1:45:52] you are the written word
[1:45:54] oh glory word written word living word
[1:45:57] made manifest
[1:45:58] and the spirit had to come upon you
[1:46:03] give me a scripture jesus went into the
[1:46:05] temple found the pathways written
[1:46:07] isn't that right the spirit is upon me
[1:46:09] so the spirit had to hit him
[1:46:13] for him to manifest his promise and his
[1:46:15] spirit have to hit you
[1:46:17] as the bride revelation 2017 the spirit
[1:46:19] and the bride
[1:46:20] how could you how could you be part of
[1:46:22] the bride and you're not connecting with
[1:46:23] the spirit
[1:46:24] the spirit has to follow you you
[1:46:26] understand the spirit following the word
[1:46:28] the spirit follow the blood all the way
[1:46:31] from the book of redemption
[1:46:32] and you are drawn from the blood from
[1:46:34] the book of redemption your name go way
[1:46:36] back here
[1:46:37] that's why the devil could only amen and
[1:46:39] trap you up to this time of no time
[1:46:41] but when god bless you all you boss you
[1:46:42] out you can't go back in
[1:46:44] after a while the devil comes small
[1:46:46] afterwards the devil will get
[1:46:48] less and all you're dealing with is you
[1:46:50] and your issues
[1:46:51] you and your challenges the devil is not

[1:46:56] get it to give up he can't get you to
[1:46:57] let go
[1:46:58] so it's you you you you the picture have
[1:47:01] to get out of the way
[1:47:09] because he can't force his life into you
[1:47:13] you have to open the door and get rid of
[1:47:15] stuff and get rid of things
[1:47:17] that he could get the preeminences he
[1:47:19] will use what he can
[1:47:20] if you surrender your monkey you'll use

[1:47:23] tongue you will use your tongue
[1:47:24] you surrender his hands you use your
[1:47:26] hands your surrender is hard to
[1:47:27] use your heart whatever you want to

[1:48:25] adam knew what he was doing her eve
[1:48:28] didn't know what she was doing
[1:48:29] adam walked out with his wife and jesus
[1:48:32] took his wife place and became sin for
[1:48:33] her
[1:48:34] it's not like adam was stupid adam knew
[1:48:37] what he was doing
[1:48:38] he loved his wife and he walked out of
[1:48:40] the garden with his wife
[1:48:41] and jesus went and take his wife's place
[1:48:43] because his wife was a sinful
[1:48:44] or when he died in calories i died for
[1:48:46] them that's why he fighting for you this
[1:48:48] morning
[1:48:49] that's why the angels with the sword
[1:48:50] drawn trying to guide you back to the
[1:48:52] tree of life

[1:48:56] [Applause]
[1:48:59] let me say it to you good he removed
[1:49:01] kings for your sake
[1:49:03] [Applause]
[1:49:04] he'll remove ministers for your sake he
[1:49:07] will turn things upside down for your
[1:49:09] sake
[1:49:10] because you are wife of the lamb come
[1:49:13] here
[1:49:15] i will show you the bride the lamb's
[1:49:18] wife
[1:49:19] oh glory to god hallelujah
[1:49:24] oh my god this one is a big one you say
[1:49:26] like the pentecostal experience
[1:49:28] today i just love this the coming of the
[1:49:31] holy ghost in the last days
[1:49:34] as promised
[1:49:37] they're not just holy ghosts
[1:49:40] this is going a little deeper the holy
[1:49:42] ghost
[1:49:43] as promised is likely
[1:49:47] abstract to the title deed
[1:49:51] this is the promised one
[1:49:55] let's continue you say gonna get a title
[1:49:58] sure
[1:49:58] you're gonna title that place but that's
[1:50:00] still those say it's yours
[1:50:02] somebody way back here under could come
[1:50:03] in and put a claim on it
[1:50:05] so somebody get id that these is not
[1:50:07] really cleared
[1:50:08] that is why when you go to the bank to
[1:50:10] buy piece of property you have to send
[1:50:11] it now for them to check out
[1:50:13] the history of this property sometimes
[1:50:17] somebody sell you that is not theirs or
[1:50:19] they want to sell you something that is
[1:50:20] not theirs
[1:50:21] there are these are paper bogus looking
[1:50:24] legit until you check it all the way
[1:50:27] oh glory to god so this holy ghost
[1:50:29] coming is the legit thing
[1:50:32] this abstract is the title d that adam
[1:50:36] lost
[1:50:40] this is no game so nobody can claim that
[1:50:44] without vindicating i have what adam had
[1:50:47] they are liars
[1:50:49] they say they are persons but they are
[1:50:50] liars to claim this experience
[1:50:54] you have to show the evidence of the
[1:50:56] abstract
[1:50:58] because when the abstract have your name
[1:51:00] on it and you squatter on that ground
[1:51:02] any sickness on that girl any disease on
[1:51:05] that ground
[1:51:06] you have authority to run him out cast
[1:51:09] him out
[1:51:10] [Applause]
[1:51:18] let's continue when a man has said
[1:51:22] he believes the word and then
[1:51:26] when the holy spirit comes it is the
[1:51:29] abstract to the title
[1:51:31] and that gives you permission when you
[1:51:33] have that abstract
[1:51:35] and every bit of it belongs to you and
[1:51:37] everything on it belongs to you gives
[1:51:39] you the abstract
[1:51:40] when the holy ghost comes upon this
[1:51:43] title deed that god saw back under
[1:51:46] before the foundation of the world and
[1:51:47] put it name on the book of life and was
[1:51:49] born to a man or woman
[1:51:51] something to sin and guilty of sin but
[1:51:52] when i believe on it here we go there's
[1:51:54] the part i want to get to
[1:51:56] when i believe on it i received the deed
[1:52:04] but when the holy ghost come it was the
[1:52:06] abstract
[1:52:08] that everything against me whether my
[1:52:11] mother done it whether my father done it
[1:52:13] is struck off
[1:52:16] so the abstract is what literally
[1:52:19] rocks you back to eden
[1:52:21] [Music]
[1:52:21] [Applause]
[1:52:24] not the deed the deal is what the
[1:52:27] message have now
[1:52:28] the talking word that's deed but the
[1:52:31] bride will come with the abstract
[1:52:33] which will be the devil's answer
[1:52:35] [Music]
[1:52:38] because after jesus brother branham
[1:52:42] was the only man to prove the abstract
[1:52:45] is on the earth
[1:52:48] because adam lost the book and nobody
[1:52:51] could access that
[1:52:52] that was shot up in heaven waiting for
[1:52:55] the last days
[1:52:56] so when daniel get up go tell daniel go
[1:52:58] your way the time is not yet
[1:53:01] leave that for the end time people leave
[1:53:03] there for the end time punch
[1:53:05] oh glory to god so when the lamb took
[1:53:08] the book
[1:53:09] revelation 10 mighty angel coming from
[1:53:11] heaven another five fold there

[2:14:07] your wedding was a null
[2:14:09] you never done it in the first place oh
[2:14:11] my because adam why are we here
[2:14:13] if adam didn't fall we were okay so god

[2:17:05] when the full sons of god will be
[2:17:06] manifested when the power of god
[2:17:08] will walk out and will take every power
[2:17:12] that satan got away from him
[2:17:16] i'm closing you could begin to play
[2:17:18] something
[2:17:20] but obama said people say you claim to
[2:17:21] have power no no no
[2:17:23] we're just like them at monk
[2:17:25] transfiguration we do not claim power
[2:17:28] on mount transfiguration they wasn't
[2:17:30] saying moses say see who
[2:17:32] i am disciples say see who i am see who
[2:17:34] i
[2:17:35] am you know what happened notice the
[2:17:38] scene jesus glorified
[2:17:40] that's all they wanted to see
[2:17:42] represented
[2:17:43] jesus glorified so it is today

[2:17:48] don't care what the people say about us
[2:17:51] our name ain't nothing it's his name
[2:17:54] our life it's nothing it is his life
[2:17:56] it's his power not our power
[2:17:58] and there's only one thing that we love
[2:18:00] to do is to seem glorified
[2:18:02] how can it be when he is glorified in us
[2:18:04] by his resurrection that's in us
[2:18:06] did you get that our desire is not to be
[2:18:09] glorified
[2:18:10] our desire is not have some big name our
[2:18:13] desire is not to boost some church
[2:18:15] to make more sunday school to bring in
[2:18:16] on whatnot that's not the way that all
[2:18:18] his eyes are seen glorified
[2:18:20] not with self-pride but in us our lives
[2:18:23] to prove he's alive and live in us
