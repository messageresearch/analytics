[43:37] god bless you and thank you for uh being
[43:41] with us tonight
[43:42] i have two portions of scripture like to
[43:43] read uh from isaiah chapter six
[43:46] we want to read from one to eight and
[43:49] also from second corinthians four
[43:52] we want to read from verse 1 to 18.
[43:55] reading isaiah 6 reading from verse 1 in
[43:57] the year
[43:58] that king uzziah died i saw the lord
[44:01] sitting up on the throne
[44:03] high and lifted up his strain filled the
[44:05] temple above it stood the cell phones
[44:07] each one had six wings
[44:09] with twain he covered his face with
[44:11] twain he covered his feet with twain he
[44:12] did fly
[44:14] and one cried unto another said holy
[44:16] holy holy is the lord of hosts
[44:18] the whole earth is full of his glory and
[44:20] the post
[44:21] of the door moved the voice of him that
[44:24] cried
[44:25] and the house was filled with smoke then
[44:27] said i woe is me if i'm undone
[44:29] because i am a man of unclean lips and i
[44:31] dwell in the midst of a people of
[44:33] unclean lips
[44:34] for mine eyes have seen the king the
[44:37] lord of hosts
[44:38] then flew one of the seraphims unto me
[44:41] having a life call in his hand
[44:43] which he had taken from the tongue some
[44:45] of the altar laid it upon my mouth and
[44:47] said lord this have touched my lips that
[44:50] iniquity is taken away
[44:52] thy sin purged and also i hear the voice
[44:55] of the lord saying whom shall i send
[44:57] who will go for us then said here am i
[45:00] send me from ii corinthians
[45:04] uh chapter four we're gonna read from
[45:07] verse
[45:08] one
[45:13] paul speaking therefore seeing we have
[45:15] this
[45:16] ministry we have received mercy we faint
[45:19] not
[45:20] but i've renounced the hidden things of
[45:22] dishonesty
[45:24] so this is real quality spirit
[45:27] at the ministry level but we have
[45:28] renounced the hidden things of this
[45:30] honesty
[45:31] not walking in craftiness nor handling
[45:33] the word of god deceitfully
[45:35] but by manifestation of the truth
[45:38] commending ourselves
[45:40] to every man's conscience in the sight
[45:43] of god
[45:44] but if our gospel be heard it is hid to
[45:46] them that are lost
[45:48] in whom the god of this world had
[45:50] blinded the minds of them which believe
[45:52] not at least the light of the glorious
[45:55] gospel of christ
[45:56] who is in the image of god should shine
[45:58] unto them for we preach
[46:00] not ourselves but christ jesus the lord
[46:04] and ourselves your servants for christ's
[46:06] sake
[46:07] for god who commanded the light to shine
[46:09] out of darkness had shine in our hearts
[46:11] to give the light of the knowledge
[46:15] of the glory of god in the face of jesus
[46:18] christ
[46:19] but we have this treasure in earthen
[46:21] vessels that the
[46:22] excellency of the power may be of god
[46:25] and not of us
[46:26] we are troubled in every side yet not
[46:28] distressed
[46:29] we are perplexed but not in the spear
[46:32] persecuted but not
[46:33] for satan cast down but not destroyed
[46:37] always burn about in the body the dying
[46:40] of the lord jesus
[46:41] that the life also of jesus might be
[46:44] made manifest in our body
[46:45] for we which live are always delivered
[46:48] unto death for jesus sake
[46:49] that the life also of jesus might be
[46:52] made manifest
[46:53] in our mortal flesh like how specific he
[46:56] is speaking about it
[46:57] life of jesus might be made manifest
[47:01] in our mortal flesh verse 12 so then
[47:04] death worketh in us but life in you
[47:08] we have in the same spirit of faith
[47:10] according
[47:11] as it is written i believe and therefore
[47:14] have i spoken
[47:15] we also believe and therefore speak
[47:18] knowing
[47:18] that he which raise up the lord jesus
[47:22] shall raise us up also by jesus and
[47:24] shall present us with you
[47:26] for all things are of yours for your
[47:28] sakes that the abundant grace
[47:30] my true the thanksgiving of many redone
[47:33] to the glory of god
[47:34] for which cause we think not but do our
[47:37] outward man perish
[47:38] yet the inward man is renewed day by day
[47:41] for our light affliction which is but
[47:43] for a moment
[47:44] worked for us a far more exceeding and
[47:47] eternal weight of glory
[47:48] why we look not at the things which are
[47:50] seen but at the things which are not
[47:53] seen for the things which are seen are
[47:55] temporal but the things which are not
[47:56] seen

[48:17] appetite tonight tonight influenced by
[48:20] the word
[48:22] that's the title influenced by the word
[48:24] and inspiration
[48:25] is a word to you press into the unseen
[48:28] press into the unseen
[48:31] hallelujah praise god because the things
[48:33] that are seen as temporal
[48:35] but the things that are not seen are
[48:36] eternal hallelujah isn't that something
[48:39] all right let's go tonight praise the
[48:41] lord all right
[48:43] the spirit of god is not something that
[48:46] it is
[48:47] cooled into you it is something
[48:51] that is predestinated into you by the
[48:54] hand
[48:54] of almighty god your experiences
[48:59] cannot be schooled or
[49:02] taught into you and this thing about
[49:04] your experiences we're not talking about
[49:06] teaching and learning and saying amen to
[49:08] the world we're talking about your
[49:09] experience
[49:11] the spirit of god coming into you is an
[49:13] experience your experience cannot be
[49:15] schooled
[49:17] or taught into you it is predestinated
[49:21] by the god's hand and god's
[49:23] foreknowledge
[49:24] into you oh praise god that's why i i
[49:27] enjoy and love the sovereignty of god
[49:29] how god
[49:30] does things and he does it to whomsoever
[49:32] he will isn't that something
[49:34] so then nobody could hinder you or stop
[49:37] you from getting
[49:38] a divine encounters or experience it
[49:40] with god
[49:41] and tonight we are pushing that button
[49:43] on the supernatural i was thinking that
[49:45] the natural man went out of the unseen
[49:47] of his eye
[49:49] and pulled an atom down out of the sky
[49:51] and split that atom in two
[49:53] that destroy human life and if the
[49:55] natural man
[49:57] that knows nothing of god and cannot
[49:59] know nothing of god except he be
[50:01] converted
[50:02] then his soul comes alive with the
[50:03] supernatural if he could do that
[50:06] in the natural realm what ought the man
[50:09] of god to be doing
[50:10] my friends the church is so far behind
[50:14] let us pray that by god we will
[50:17] move the church up the natural man
[50:20] with the natural resources is getting
[50:23] greater results

[50:53] people

[50:55] had he was born for certainty
[50:57] god had a purpose and god has a purpose
[51:00] for your life or you've been here

[51:04] to that place
[51:05] how much trouble you will save god in
[51:07] yourself moses
[51:08] born and afterwards he was brought to
[51:10] the place where he was anointed notice
[51:13] the seed laying there with that
[51:16] intellectual conception
[51:18] with all the faith he was born to
[51:20] deliver his people and
[51:21] yet it never
[51:24] come to life until
[51:27] that light from the burning bush flashed
[51:30] across
[51:31] it the man of everything inside of him
[51:33] the seed
[51:34] the calling the words from his parents
[51:37] hallelujah the predestination everything
[51:39] correct
[51:40] but it couldn't come to life until
[51:44] hallelujah that light from the burning
[51:47] bush flashed
[51:48] across it until he seen something not
[51:50] something he read about
[51:52] oh glory to god not something he read
[51:54] about until he's something that he's
[51:56] seen
[51:56] with his eyes something that spoke to
[51:58] him and he spoke back to it
[52:00] how that bring things to life what is it
[52:03] the supernatural
[52:05] oh glory not explanation the
[52:07] supernatural
[52:08] it brings things to life let's press
[52:11] into the
[52:12] on scene and i think any man
[52:15] woman boy or girl i think in the
[52:17] intellectual conception
[52:19] of what they think the word is can never
[52:22] have a full foundation stand
[52:25] until they have met that light that
[52:27] brings that
[52:28] word to a reality no man could do that
[52:31] revelation doesn't come from man
[52:33] hallelujah man can give understanding
[52:35] but revelation comes from god
[52:37] that's when the father reveal it that's
[52:39] when the spirit reveal it
[52:40] oh glory to god that's why he's asked
[52:43] the question who do men
[52:44] say i am meant to say whatever they want
[52:46] but when the father reveal it
[52:48] that a man talking that's god talking
[52:51] that's the revelation of god
[52:52] and upon that rock he'll build his
[52:54] church and the gates of hell could never
[52:56] prevail against it
[52:57] hallelujah oh glory to god amen amen
[53:01] amen
[53:02] so he said until then he said what i
[53:04] think
[53:05] in an intellectual conception of what
[53:07] they think the word is and so forth
[53:08] a woman or boy or girl can never have a
[53:11] full foundation
[53:12] stand until they have met that light
[53:15] that brings that word to reality i think
[53:18] no church
[53:19] in its practice no matter how
[53:20] intellectual and fundamental it might be
[53:22] that church cannot strive until the
[53:24] supernatural
[53:26] is made known among that people and they
[53:28] see it
[53:29] something that they can talk to that
[53:31] will talk back to them
[53:32] that vindicates this written word i love
[53:35] that that vindicates the written word
[53:37] nothing wrong with the word but there is
[53:39] a supernatural to come to vindicate
[53:41] the supernatural world is that word
[53:43] vindicating word is that mysteries will
[53:45] negate the word
[53:46] it's the supernatural to vindicate the
[53:48] word that's why you say when omnipotence
[53:49] speaks the miraculous takes place
[53:52] that's when god talking that's when god
[53:54] speaking that's not man explaining
[53:56] that's pillow fire failed oh hallelujah
[53:59] and in the last days the pillow fire
[54:01] will be veiling your adopted sons god

[54:23] even on this there are two
[54:26] systems working in the church today

[54:36] nominational system

[54:45] one
[54:45] is after the flesh what is it esau and

[55:12] and goes out with it they said press
[55:14] play thing no
[55:15] they said no playing back the tapes on
[55:17] the prophet not that if these men
[55:19] will pick up this and go out with it
[55:22] they can make more
[55:23] sense to it and to see bring it to a
[55:26] place you would
[55:27] i want to just lay the seed then hope
[55:30] they make it come to life
[55:34] all these beautiful seeds in this
[55:35] message that laying on books and tips
[55:38] laying there waiting for god spiritual
[55:40] scientists
[55:42] waiting for men of god to pick it up and
[55:45] make more sense to it
[55:46] and connect this with this and this with
[55:48] this and put this here and put this here
[55:50] and then a bonfire break out then a
[55:52] revival break out
[55:53] oh glory to god some some amen
[55:55] hallelujah
[55:56] glory to god them fail in the wilderness
[55:59] because the word that they heard wasn't
[56:00] mixed with fate oh glory to god two
[56:03] million people came out
[56:04] and just two went in oh give the lord a
[56:07] shout
[56:07] oh glory to god this message coming with
[56:09] a rude awakening
[56:11] hallelujah praise god god is alive
[56:14] god is not dead he is not a god of the
[56:17] message
[56:18] he is a god of the word the god of moses
[56:21] the god of abraham the god of isaac he
[56:23] is alive tonight
[56:24] he's not going to change hallelujah he
[56:27] will not play as if you
[56:28] as you have a book i got to tell you
[56:30] he's not going to say that he's got to
[56:31] obey the message
[56:33] got to obey the word hallelujah
[56:37] oh my thank you lord
[56:40] praise god when he was
[56:44] here he was born in the world he come
[56:47] here with a black mark on his name that
[56:49] jesus
[56:50] because questionable how does mary have
[56:52] a baby and
[56:53] she married and so jesus come undercover
[56:57] different kind of cover god had his soul
[57:00] so he had my black mark already so his
[57:02] reputation at his start wasn't that good
[57:05] because of how it was implied about mary
[57:08] they may believe no words are conceived
[57:10] so jesus and that black man how that god
[57:13] so marvelously brought him here just
[57:16] before his coming
[57:18] the age had got just like it has come
[57:21] recently
[57:22] into a backseating condition israel has
[57:25] been brought into captivity by the
[57:27] romans
[57:28] and they have been taken away and the
[57:30] priest
[57:31] has got to a place and got away yes
[57:35] from the supernatural part of god they
[57:40] that they have been teaching just upon
[57:42] doctrine of their own
[57:43] theories of what they taught so the
[57:46] priests at that time
[57:47] they got away from the supernatural part
[57:51] hallelujah and just teaching doctrine
[57:54] of their own theories and jesus said you
[57:57] teach for commandments the words of men
[58:00] making the word of god of non-effect
[58:02] hallelujah
[58:04] because when john came and introduced
[58:06] jesus
[58:07] right there it moved from the prophet to
[58:09] the prophecy
[58:11] oh glory to god in this message it moves
[58:14] from the prophet
[58:14] to the prophecy we are being influenced
[58:17] tonight
[58:18] by the prophecy of malachi 4. oh glory
[58:21] not gossiping a prophet that finished
[58:22] with
[58:23] the last is already come what is the
[58:25] prophecy elias brought
[58:27] oh glory the god of all this bride
[58:29] becoming a super church about this bride
[58:31] becoming a super race are coming upon
[58:33] his bride
[58:34] that he will be proud of hallelujah
[58:37] praise god
[58:40] so jesus busted them he said you teach
[58:42] the commandments the words of men
[58:43] making the word of god of non-effect
[58:46] hallelujah they're christian friends we
[58:50] looked at the unseen
[58:51] hallelujah the supernatural is what you
[58:54] do not see
[58:55] but what you believe and act on as
[58:58] though it was
[58:59] and what a tremendous bible study we had
[59:01] last night
[59:03] hallelujah praise god what a tremendous
[59:05] bible study we had last night
[59:07] with those four lepers hallelujah having
[59:10] a little conference
[59:11] they say if we stay here we will die if
[59:13] we go inside the city we're going to
[59:15] die if we go out to the syrians we have
[59:17] a 50 50 chance
[59:19] if they kill us be there already but if
[59:21] they feed us we might live
[59:23] oh glory to god and they made a decision
[59:25] not to go back in familiar grounds
[59:27] that's the easiest part to do when you
[59:30] see you're in some kind of condition
[59:32] you tend to want to go back to where
[59:33] you're accustomed to where you relax you
[59:35] don't want to venture out
[59:36] but by faith call it dingy fate
[59:40] they say we are staying here why sit
[59:42] here and die
[59:43] i refuse to die in this message oh glory
[59:46] to god i left the catholic church
[59:48] not to come and die in this message no
[59:51] no i reject that i reject the tradition
[59:54] of the elders
[59:55] hallelujah i reject every interpretation
[59:58] they want to feed on me i reject
[1:00:00] it i will be influenced by the word and
[1:00:02] by the word only
[1:00:04] by the prophecy brought by malachi 4 not
[1:00:06] by jesus will
[1:00:07] not by function of god recording but by
[1:00:09] the word itself
[1:00:10] or give the lord a shout not by a man
[1:00:12] from anywhere
[1:00:14] hallelujah praise god anywhere no man
[1:00:17] hallelujah god put seven angels seven
[1:00:20] stars in his right hand
[1:00:22] and bring a message oh glory to god i
[1:00:24] was telling somebody
[1:00:26] oh my god i see him for the first time
[1:00:29] but the brandon had pastor prophet t.j
[1:00:31] evangelist all that inside him easy how
[1:00:32] do you find holy side
[1:00:33] so when you hear the tape you hear the
[1:00:34] whole fight for oh

[1:00:42] i said boy brown wasn't 95 fold he was
[1:00:45] not in the fightful
[1:00:46] that is just looter wesley spirit man
[1:00:49] spirit that come back in the message
[1:00:51] but brown was 950 he was a major prophet
[1:00:54] major prophet nothing no fifo that
[1:00:56] five-fold prophet is not a major prophet
[1:00:58] that that that he come there at all with
[1:01:00] the greatest prophet
[1:01:02] that walked the earth in this last day
[1:01:04] to catch the mighty angel
[1:01:06] that cuts the open book that adam lost
[1:01:09] what was lost in genesis
[1:01:10] was caught back in this last day and you
[1:01:12] want to put him in the fightful that's
[1:01:13] nuts
[1:01:14] oh glory to god god have men to come
[1:01:16] behind to make more sense to this
[1:01:19] to bring clarity to this that you could
[1:01:21] see hallelujah
[1:01:23] how are you getting into god's presence
[1:01:25] oh glory to god that's the purpose of
[1:01:26] the message not to have church
[1:01:28] and pews and deacons and elders there is
[1:01:30] mechanics
[1:01:31] there's governments there's systems and
[1:01:34] forms

[1:01:37] have nothing to do
[1:01:38] with a man sent from god that have
[1:01:41] nothing to do
[1:01:42] with elijah walking down to the jordan
[1:01:44] and striking it
[1:01:45] and shorten open it because a shot of
[1:01:47] god is walking
[1:01:48] i need me to walk across jordan i have
[1:01:51] nothing to do
[1:01:52] with the power of god to strike the
[1:01:53] church it's struck gideon
[1:01:55] oh shock samson it struck the heroes of
[1:01:58] faith of all

[1:02:01] oh chloe if it's chocolate upon him
[1:02:03] they're going to strike this pride
[1:02:04] because he was the first one
[1:02:06] that came to maturity the first one to
[1:02:08] be waived
[1:02:09] and when his way would mean others
[1:02:11] coming oh glory to god we know a lot of
[1:02:13] time pass but others still coming
[1:02:15] hallelujah over 50 plus years past but
[1:02:18] others coming oh glory to god the sheep

[1:02:42] over us
[1:02:43] oh hallelujah i feel good tonight
[1:02:46] glory to god hallelujah praise
[1:02:50] god and when the supernatural comes upon
[1:02:52] a mortal being
[1:02:54] it causes a conflict with the flesh it
[1:02:57] weakens the human being
[1:02:58] that's why daniel said fellas one dead
[1:03:01] john phillips one dead
[1:03:02] and that power hit the prophet he was
[1:03:04] back up in a room numb for days
[1:03:06] now you know rejoicing and jumping and
[1:03:07] arguing that's presence hallelujah
[1:03:10] oh glory to god that's power
[1:03:13] that's presence and isaiah was leading
[1:03:17] on king uzziah
[1:03:18] nice guy called of god god put him as a
[1:03:21] king
[1:03:21] honorable man hallelujah but he wanted
[1:03:24] to do priestly work
[1:03:26] and they warn him and tell him no don't
[1:03:27] do it hallelujah he still want to do it
[1:03:30] because he was blessed what's that word
[1:03:32] now
[1:03:33] he was so blessed he thought he could do
[1:03:35] anything
[1:03:38] i'm not talking about the kingpin trying
[1:03:39] to be priests i talked about the best
[1:03:42] part
[1:03:42] trying to do anything because you are
[1:03:44] blessed
[1:03:45] like brother isaac say not because god
[1:03:48] forgave your sins you escaped the
[1:03:49] consequences
[1:03:51] hallelujah you plan trouble you reap
[1:03:54] trouble because you see they don't
[1:03:55] replant it

[1:04:22] none of that going on
[1:04:23] talking about the supernatural the only
[1:04:25] thing that this has done this
[1:04:27] supernatural
[1:04:28] has awakened ministers out of their
[1:04:31] sense bound realm
[1:04:32] into the place where they see god is
[1:04:34] present
[1:04:36] that is what the message need right now
[1:04:38] the supernatural the power of god

[1:05:37] shekel

[1:05:40] everything everything cancelled
[1:05:42] everything changed overnight hallelujah
[1:05:45] what is he saying
[1:05:46] he said there's going to be a
[1:05:47] supernatural intervention that you can't
[1:05:49] even explain
[1:05:50] and figure out and elijah wasn't even
[1:05:52] trying to figure it out he just said
[1:05:54] tomorrow

[1:05:58] is connected with foreman leopard
[1:06:01] hallelujah you hear that that tomorrow
[1:06:04] he's talking about
[1:06:05] is connected with foreign lepers
[1:06:08] who are negotiating hallelujah by
[1:06:11] logic as to what to do do we stay here
[1:06:15] in this church and die or do we move
[1:06:19] and live oh glory to god are we gonna
[1:06:21] stay
[1:06:22] in this interpretation and die we died
[1:06:24] for so long
[1:06:26] he said no i'm gonna move i'm gonna move
[1:06:28] where i didn't think i was going i'm
[1:06:30] gonna move
[1:06:31] i can't stay where i am i've got to move
[1:06:34] oh glory to god and as it began to move
[1:06:36] go of course i ramble god cause i ramble
[1:06:39] god calls them thunders to roar out
[1:06:41] and shake up the enemy's camp
[1:06:44] those syrians run they drop everything
[1:06:47] they
[1:06:48] think about the horses the fear that god
[1:06:50] put upon them
[1:06:51] the hallelujah and you talk about fear
[1:06:54] when
[1:06:55] god starts to anoint that bride fear
[1:06:57] going to take people
[1:06:59] because they're going to hear what the
[1:07:00] lord did here and what the lord did here
[1:07:02] and what the lord spoke here
[1:07:03] and what the lord manifested here oh
[1:07:05] glory i shall send my fear
[1:07:07] before you oh give the lord some praises
[1:07:10] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:07:12] thank you lord jesus oh blessed be the
[1:07:14] name of the lord
[1:07:15] they dropped everything and then four
[1:07:18] men
[1:07:19] got food got rain men got gold
[1:07:23] went back and dealt the city you'd have
[1:07:25] more than you have needed
[1:07:27] hallelujah thank you lord
[1:07:30] you're the prophet 80 percent
[1:07:33] of jesus ministry was divine healing
[1:07:38] 80 of his ministry
[1:07:42] was on the miraculous side showing the
[1:07:45] people
[1:07:46] the supernatural god was working in
[1:07:49] human flesh
[1:07:51] and what did that prophet say the word
[1:07:54] was invisible until the word
[1:07:59] became flesh let me say it again so i
[1:08:02] don't have to argue with
[1:08:03] nobody let them talk the talk but the
[1:08:06] word
[1:08:07] was invisible until the word became
[1:08:10] flesh
[1:08:10] and when the word become visible when it
[1:08:13] became flesh
[1:08:14] then the word become visible how how how
[1:08:17] by manifestation of god
[1:08:18] that is the only way not more talk we
[1:08:21] word
[1:08:22] that's why the supernatural have to
[1:08:24] vindicate the talk
[1:08:25] of what is written hallelujah has to
[1:08:28] come behind us
[1:08:29] oh man i want a close up of this part
[1:08:32] with this
[1:08:33] my god this is something that i
[1:08:37] feel to share tonight about the spirit
[1:08:40] of blindness
[1:08:42] now mother i want you to look here to me
[1:08:44] you see me
[1:08:45] you see me good i want you to put your
[1:08:48] finger on my nose this was not blind
[1:08:50] can you see my fingers all right could
[1:08:53] you see my fingers now
[1:08:54] you can see them how many have i up
[1:08:57] how many now there you are mother you
[1:08:59] have your sight
[1:09:01] you speak what has happened
[1:09:05] satan a blind spirit
[1:09:09] now the bible said when the death
[1:09:12] and dumb spirit now the doctor would say
[1:09:15] it was your eardrums when dead
[1:09:17] your eyes went dead the nerves you know
[1:09:20] but listen
[1:09:21] what is it the only thing he says the
[1:09:24] nerve went dead but what made it die
[1:09:27] there was something taking a hold of it
[1:09:29] supernaturally
[1:09:30] it didn't die all over your body it just
[1:09:33] died deer
[1:09:34] now if i had a transparent ban around my
[1:09:37] hand holding it like that
[1:09:39] it will shut the circulation off all the
[1:09:42] sound i put on fingers wouldn't help the
[1:09:44] thing to do is to get loose
[1:09:45] so nature can flow again is that right
[1:09:48] well the energy
[1:09:49] the sight the optical nerve wasn't
[1:09:53] flowing in your eye
[1:09:54] because a supernatural being a demon
[1:09:58] a blind spirit had caught your nerve and
[1:10:02] holding it
[1:10:03] now he is gone that's the reason you can
[1:10:05] see better
[1:10:07] so the prophet wasn't talking about
[1:10:08] nerves and no he's seeing the spirit
[1:10:11] banging that nerve affecting the eye i
[1:10:14] went that demon go out
[1:10:16] person could see you are going to be all
[1:10:19] right
[1:10:20] you can see good now all right she says
[1:10:22] she sees well now god bless you my
[1:10:24] mother
[1:10:24] go off the platform by yourself
[1:10:26] rejoicing and praising god
[1:10:28] and then he said he said then how are
[1:10:29] you sister come forward you want to be
[1:10:31] healed
[1:10:32] of your eyes also don't you do you
[1:10:34] believe god
[1:10:35] if he could make that woman who was
[1:10:37] almost blunt blind and that last one
[1:10:39] totally blind uh can he give you your
[1:10:42] sight sister
[1:10:42] now i what i want you to do is to
[1:10:44] believe that
[1:10:46] this which is near now to bless you now
[1:10:49] if you will believe
[1:10:50] with all your heart that god will do it
[1:10:52] he will flow right down to you
[1:10:53] and heal you bless you your eyes going
[1:10:56] bad they're getting worse
[1:10:57] isn't that right that's the same thing
[1:10:59] it's the power of the devil sister
[1:11:01] doctors can do no more of it because
[1:11:03] it's over it's it said so it's shutting
[1:11:06] off the nerve there the optical nail the
[1:11:07] energy wouldn't flow no more
[1:11:09] now the nerve is not shot off in your
[1:11:10] hand or nowhere else it's in your eye
[1:11:13] it was in your ears then you couldn't
[1:11:15] hear now the doctor would say the nerve
[1:11:17] is dead course he just works on five
[1:11:18] senses
[1:11:19] but jesus said when the death spirit
[1:11:21] went out of a man the death spirit
[1:11:23] then the blind spirit went out of a man
[1:11:25] it's a spirit it's supernatural now do
[1:11:27] you believe
[1:11:27] that upon the authority of god's word
[1:11:29] that i have been sent here to pray
[1:11:31] a prayer of faith and that i will cast
[1:11:33] that spirit away from you you will get
[1:11:34] well come forward my sister
[1:11:36] oh glory to god hallelujah that is where
[1:11:38] we head in that is where we going oh
[1:11:40] glory to god because demons are
[1:11:41] supernatural and the holy ghost is
[1:11:42] supernatural
[1:11:43] oh harlow do you believe that tonight so
[1:11:45] i thought i would share that
[1:11:46] that that would edify you and strengthen
[1:11:49] you
[1:11:49] now this uzia he got lifted up he took
[1:11:53] the censer went to the altar
[1:11:55] which was for consecrated men to that
[1:11:56] office he tried to take a minister's
[1:11:58] place
[1:11:58] they tell him you got off the beaten
[1:12:00] road we honor you we respect you
[1:12:02] you're great man don't try to do that
[1:12:04] was he humbled no sir
[1:12:05] he said god bless me so i'll do what i
[1:12:07] want
[1:12:08] to do you say brethren be careful there
[1:12:12] because here we go no matter how much
[1:12:14] god has filled you with his spirit
[1:12:17] how much you have done how well you have
[1:12:19] been blessed you stay
[1:12:21] with the calling of god don't get caught
[1:12:24] off
[1:12:24] of some traditions organizational
[1:12:27] schemes and so forth
[1:12:28] come better back to come come back to
[1:12:31] the part
[1:12:32] you better come back to what god laid
[1:12:33] down at the beginning
[1:12:35] we find out this man when he was
[1:12:37] corrected
[1:12:38] instead of humbling himself and
[1:12:40] admitting that the word
[1:12:41] was right and god was right
[1:12:45] he became angry in other words he was
[1:12:47] ready to kick
[1:12:48] him out of the organization no he was
[1:12:51] very upset about it very perplexed he
[1:12:53] got angry i
[1:12:53] have to turn and say no you just wait a
[1:12:55] minute do you realize who i am
[1:12:58] i'm an apostle i'm a pastor i'm a bishop
[1:13:02] i'm in charge of this side message long
[1:13:03] time you know who i am
[1:13:06] that's that's the pride let's see
[1:13:09] arrogance notice people who
[1:13:10] afterwards they have small salaries they
[1:13:12] get big salaries they get bigger
[1:13:13] salaries afterwards they feel like they
[1:13:14] do anything no because they
[1:13:16] they reach there are more money i could
[1:13:18] handle
[1:13:19] and they kick god up usually when people
[1:13:22] get blessed they get arrogant they get
[1:13:24] and god looking for somebody the more he
[1:13:27] blesses is the more humble
[1:13:28] it becomes how they find that because
[1:13:30] pride and power
[1:13:32] is a very strong thing see
[1:13:35] so watch he said when you're corrected
[1:13:38] by the word of god
[1:13:39] listen you must be subject to the word
[1:13:42] the minister have to be subject to the
[1:13:45] word also

[1:14:40] influenced
[1:14:41] by the word you see all the time isaiah
[1:14:44] was influenced
[1:14:45] by usia he was lean on king uzziah
[1:14:49] when you lean and think that is not the
[1:14:50] word god of a way of
[1:14:52] shifting the prop and getting it broken
[1:14:54] for more for you
[1:14:55] and let you stagger because you have no
[1:14:57] more props you see you're leaning
[1:14:58] and when you're leaning and relaxing

[1:15:02] to do
[1:15:03] when you're leaning you have no fighting
[1:15:04] to fight because you're leaning
[1:15:06] you're being a man you're a priest
[1:15:09] you're an organization you're leaning on
[1:15:11] on the books and the tips you're leaning
[1:15:12] on you're pressing and playing
[1:15:14] you're leading all kind of stuff so
[1:15:16] there's no need to press
[1:15:19] there's no need to push there's no need
[1:15:22] to fight
[1:15:23] hallelujah let me sing you a little bit
[1:15:26] some people just lean on their own
[1:15:27] ability
[1:15:29] god give them their ability and they're
[1:15:31] not honing that ability
[1:15:33] they're not improving with that ability
[1:15:35] just going with natural
[1:15:37] talent and that is where that man get
[1:15:39] busted
[1:15:40] with the one thousand two thousand five
[1:15:42] thousand
[1:15:43] and god gave them the master give them
[1:15:45] according to
[1:15:46] his discernment according to their gifts
[1:15:49] the one with one thousand buriat the one
[1:15:51] with two produced two the one with five
[1:15:52] produced them

[1:15:56] one have a lot of talk
[1:15:58] i know you're a hard man i know you're
[1:16:00] just repeating so
[1:16:01] i know this i know that and also why if
[1:16:03] you know all of that
[1:16:04] why didn't do something with it he bury
[1:16:06] it and say well just what you're giving
[1:16:07] me just want to give him back
[1:16:09] hallelujah same way for the last 40
[1:16:11] years
[1:16:12] god didn't want that he said virtue
[1:16:14] active virtual knowledge
[1:16:16] god is in increasing multiplying adding
[1:16:19] god is never in staying how you are and
[1:16:22] if you are who you are last 10 years
[1:16:23] something wrong
[1:16:24] hallelujah praise god is every place you
[1:16:26] put your foot in not mocking time
[1:16:28] god is a god that's make progress
[1:16:30] hallelujah he's a progressive god
[1:16:32] abraham faith exactly love
[1:16:34] jacob grace drew the perfection he's
[1:16:36] unfolding something he's always
[1:16:37] unfolding something
[1:16:38] doesn't stand sell the pill of fire
[1:16:40] moves you have to move with it
[1:16:42] isn't that right oh praise the name of
[1:16:43] the lord hallelujah
[1:16:46] so when he wasn't pleased then what
[1:16:49] happened he was smitten with
[1:16:50] leprosy's anger raised the priest
[1:16:51] detected leprosy
[1:16:53] in his face leprosy represents sin when
[1:16:56] a man won't stand correction by the word
[1:16:57] of god he's full of leprosy
[1:16:58] blows up carries on what does that do it
[1:17:01] ruin your
[1:17:02] influence and this young prophet what a
[1:17:05] lesson
[1:17:06] that was to him then when he seen this
[1:17:09] king by the very thing isaiah learned
[1:17:11] here we go one of his greatest lessons
[1:17:14] listen to the lesson that no matter how
[1:17:16] great a man might be
[1:17:19] how much influence he might have
[1:17:23] when he fails to walk in light
[1:17:26] when he fails to obey god then his
[1:17:29] influence is ruined
[1:17:30] he took off the field i would say that
[1:17:33] i remember when branham listened to his
[1:17:36] mother-in-law
[1:17:37] and didn't do what god wanted to do he
[1:17:40] lost his wife
[1:17:41] he lost his daughter and that's still
[1:17:44] changing from being a prophet god didn't
[1:17:47] say all right
[1:17:48] as is you you heard the prophet no
[1:17:51] no god didn't do that and i am saying if
[1:17:54] god
[1:17:55] didn't spare him why would god spear you
[1:17:58] or spear this message people hallelujah
[1:18:01] god is the word we have to come back to
[1:18:04] be influenced by
[1:18:05] what is written by what is spoken
[1:18:08] hallelujah
[1:18:09] by what has been revealed by waters on
[1:18:11] the unveiled
[1:18:12] no compromise oh glory to god like i
[1:18:15] tell exact stay with the world
[1:18:16] regardless of what look go my feelings
[1:18:18] this one that one stay with the world
[1:18:20] whose ex-vets
[1:18:22] who angry with you angry let them get
[1:18:24] vex them get angry let them criticize
[1:18:26] them laugh
[1:18:27] but don't get god angry please god
[1:18:30] hallelujah stay under god it's
[1:18:34] god you have to fear not man man right
[1:18:36] now only have
[1:18:37] mouth do your talk hallelujah praise god
[1:18:40] fear god
[1:18:41] another thing isaiah learned he learned
[1:18:43] by this
[1:18:44] that god orders his man to his place
[1:18:48] not putting yourself in that place but
[1:18:50] god put a man in his place
[1:18:52] who want to pick fivefold and who that
[1:18:54] and he followed whom he followed who
[1:18:55] only followed who caller what
[1:18:56] i said that nonsense hallelujah i said
[1:18:59] some man
[1:19:00] could make a way for the fivefold it
[1:19:02] have don't have that in the word
[1:19:03] no man can make away from no fivefold is
[1:19:05] god places a man
[1:19:07] the bible said for god set in the church
[1:19:09] first apostle prophet teaches the
[1:19:11] violence and so like that then where
[1:19:12] around when long in detail put a
[1:19:14] magnifying glass and that he said when a
[1:19:15] church
[1:19:16] is growing in that the holy ghost is
[1:19:18] just as real
[1:19:20] as it was to pentecost how they groan
[1:19:22] and cry
[1:19:23] but when they are born and positionally
[1:19:26] born
[1:19:26] then god sets in the church hallelujah

[1:26:24] he called the berliners the beginners
[1:26:28] that that prepares people to come into
[1:26:30] god's presence
[1:26:32] he said the temple was moved hallelujah
[1:26:35] they are the burners of the sacrifice
[1:26:37] making way for the worshippers
[1:26:40] hallelujah
[1:26:41] they just burn the sacrifice to make way
[1:26:43] for the worshipper the saints
[1:26:45] and two wings they cover their faces i
[1:26:48] call that the presence with reverence
[1:26:50] two wings their feet he called that
[1:26:52] humility
[1:26:53] you compare that with moses take off
[1:26:54] your shoes wings they cover their feet
[1:26:57] and they realize them they're on holy
[1:26:59] ground is that right and when you're
[1:27:00] recognized on holy ground
[1:27:02] you wouldn't go into places that is
[1:27:03] wrong and listen be conscious of your
[1:27:05] littleness unless you heard that be
[1:27:06] conscious of your
[1:27:08] littleness be conscious of your
[1:27:10] littleness the consciousness of it how
[1:27:12] you can be conscious of it that is not
[1:27:13] normal
[1:27:14] we more conscious how big we are what
[1:27:17] would he have what we could do and
[1:27:18] everything else
[1:27:19] but this give a change mindset now this
[1:27:22] changes your mind and your attitude
[1:27:23] approach
[1:27:24] that you're little you're nobody your
[1:27:26] dust
[1:27:27] everybody beats it and see sun think
[1:27:29] about you being a greener sun and you
[1:27:31] look and see
[1:27:32] wow the whole bitch's son and you are
[1:27:35] one little green there and you think you
[1:27:36] are big
[1:27:37] you kind of like a ants raising a voice
[1:27:39] and shouting and shouting at you
[1:27:40] an aunt one aunt and all you do you take
[1:27:43] your shoes and just smash it like that
[1:27:44] cooks and all that shout
[1:27:47] out that's where we are that lands
[1:27:49] shouting
[1:27:50] shouting hallelujah defending arguing
[1:27:54] battling fighting sword fighting word
[1:27:56] fighting church fighting all kind of
[1:27:58] foolishness and god have promises here
[1:28:01] to fulfill to see who will be influenced
[1:28:04] truly by the word
[1:28:05] because this experience that isaiah had
[1:28:08] showed the quality that god expect is
[1:28:10] that a threefold key
[1:28:11] a tree level key is that a three-pronged
[1:28:14] key
[1:28:14] is a three stage that god allows or what
[1:28:17] permits or god wants
[1:28:19] for us to have hallelujah first one
[1:28:21] reverence
[1:28:22] second one humility and then he said now
[1:28:25] let's do two wings cover his face
[1:28:27] he was showing watch and then he two
[1:28:29] wings
[1:28:30] uh flying and that was wings in action
[1:28:32] two wings
[1:28:33] two more wings covered his face in
[1:28:35] reverence two wings couple of speech and
[1:28:36] humility and two wings he was an action
[1:28:38] what was he doing
[1:28:39] he was showing the prophet by this by
[1:28:42] this
[1:28:43] he was showing the prophet how his
[1:28:46] prepared
[1:28:47] servants must be
[1:28:52] how reverence humility
[1:28:56] and an action if you don't have the
[1:28:58] reverence and humility and your action
[1:29:00] it can work
[1:29:02] it must be all together so your season
[1:29:06] brother is arrogant and carrying on
[1:29:07] and there are plenty of action and drama
[1:29:09] it can work
[1:29:11] it can't work
[1:29:16] if you uncover your face and cover your
[1:29:18] feet and your action isn't going to do
[1:29:19] you no good
[1:29:20] because you are stood wrong it takes it
[1:29:23] all
[1:29:24] to guide you reverent humble
[1:29:28] and in action and that is what god wants
[1:29:30] this pentecostal group to be
[1:29:32] for god wants his church to be in action
[1:29:35] he said and they will
[1:29:36] watch and listen the people at pentecost
[1:29:38] they cover their feet they cover their
[1:29:39] faces
[1:29:40] they didn't care what the jews said they
[1:29:41] had a commission from god a word
[1:29:43] of god to go up to the temple to
[1:29:45] jerusalem and wait until the holy spirit
[1:29:47] came wait
[1:29:49] until the holy spirit not wait in our
[1:29:52] revelation that they are the holy spirit
[1:29:53] that's a lie
[1:29:54] die some hell hallelujah yeah yeah
[1:29:57] wait until the holy spirit came and
[1:29:59] there it was obeying his word
[1:30:01] oh glory to god because they were
[1:30:03] influenced by the word the word said
[1:30:05] tarry in the city of jerusalem
[1:30:07] until you be endured with power from an
[1:30:09] eye not until brother so and so come
[1:30:11] down to explain the revelation to you
[1:30:13] that's not what he's saying until you're
[1:30:15] endured with powerful on high now there
[1:30:17] is it brother so and so come to reveal
[1:30:19] the mystery that you didn't know
[1:30:22] until you'd be entered with powerful
[1:30:25] manhair
[1:30:27] no god was bringing power resurrection
[1:30:30] power because they had power before you
[1:30:32] know there was cast no devils and doing
[1:30:33] stuff that was temporary power
[1:30:35] and that temporary power is what peter
[1:30:37] draws sword with playing star boy
[1:30:39] trying to draw sword but when come the
[1:30:41] crucifixion night he running and denying
[1:30:43] because that power wasn't resident but
[1:30:45] this power that jesus christ appeared
[1:30:48] and said behold who received the holy
[1:30:50] ghost that power of promise
[1:30:52] that was breed upon them that was to be
[1:30:54] permanent that was to connect with what
[1:30:56] he said he that believeth on me out of
[1:30:58] his belly shall flow rivers of living
[1:30:59] water
[1:31:00] this fake he of the spirit which was not
[1:31:02] yet given or give the lord a shout he
[1:31:04] was speaking specifically
[1:31:06] about the adhesion well to break inside
[1:31:08] a man's soul
[1:31:10] change and transform his walk talk life
[1:31:12] attitude and spirit

[1:31:52] church neither shaken

[1:31:57] faces covered in the presence of god oh
[1:32:00] lord
[1:32:00] the upper room he's dramatizing you give
[1:32:02] the promise if there's any evil in me

[1:32:15] need it empty me i'll tell me upside
[1:32:17] down and shake me out
[1:32:18] i'm almost done musician
[1:32:24] they who were scared couldn't give a
[1:32:26] testimony out in the street
[1:32:28] and there was in the ultimate street
[1:32:30] speaking in tongues and in action
[1:32:32] and so much of people said these men are
[1:32:33] full of new wine hallelujah
[1:32:36] and peter said these are not full of new
[1:32:38] wine but this is that i've always said
[1:32:40] if this isn't that i'll keep this till
[1:32:42] that comes
[1:32:43] what is it they have seen gorge promise
[1:32:45] fulfill and it put them into action
[1:32:47] we just finally cover yourselves get
[1:32:50] into and then get an action
[1:32:52] and that is the backdrop of this quote
[1:32:55] we're about to read
[1:32:56] cover yourselves and get into action and
[1:33:00] then he says here this year
[1:33:02] what we have seen happen here should put
[1:33:04] every soul in action
[1:33:06] it should make a church that would make
[1:33:08] a revival here in phoenix
[1:33:10] that people will be flying from europe
[1:33:12] to see what's taking place
[1:33:13] they will say there's a place in arizona
[1:33:15] called the maricopa valley a city called
[1:33:17] phoenix there is something broke out
[1:33:19] here
[1:33:20] until the seven thunders of revelation
[1:33:22] 10 that's not even wrote in the bible
[1:33:24] is being manifested not revealed
[1:33:28] not taught not unfolded but being
[1:33:30] manifested
[1:33:31] oh glory to god there's a revolution
[1:33:33] packed and there's a manifestation part
[1:33:35] we could talk from no till the
[1:33:37] tribulation on the revolution part
[1:33:38] but if it don't get manifested we'll be
[1:33:40] all in the tribulation
[1:33:41] and that can happen because there's
[1:33:43] going to be a pride going in the rapture
[1:33:45] so there's going to be a manifestation
[1:33:46] part the capstone revelation
[1:33:48] gonna be turned into a capstone
[1:33:50] manifestation oh glory to god the
[1:33:53] capstone manifestation of jesus christ

[1:35:26] lose his hole because he failed to keep
[1:35:30] the word oh my
[1:35:33] we have lived to see that same day
[1:35:36] denominations are losing the influence
[1:35:38] these great denominations by their
[1:35:39] creeds lose their whole why
[1:35:41] they are trying to manufacture something
[1:35:43] to take the place of the office
[1:35:45] of the anointed you see there'll be no
[1:35:48] impersonation to the table
[1:35:51] this final thing is here it's be god
[1:35:54] himself doing it
[1:35:56] the word to the bride he said god
[1:35:58] himself acted at that time
[1:36:00] to fulfill the word to the virgin nobody
[1:36:04] and manufacture and call mary out and

[1:36:25] god will take his anointed
[1:36:27] and you cannot impersonate that office
[1:36:32] god anoints he chooses who he wills
[1:36:36] he condemns who he wills it is god that
[1:36:39] does the justifying
[1:36:40] it is god that does the choosing and he
[1:36:43] raises it up
[1:36:45] we see god made him king that's right
[1:36:48] when he tried to take himself into make
[1:36:50] himself a priest he couldn't do it
