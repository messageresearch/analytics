you with all the hearts all their lives we commit the service into our hands we pray bless the reading of your word we committed your hands in jesus and we ask it amen and amen god bless you it's so good to be here in the presence of god bless that be the name of the lord so this morning we have three portions of scripture we'd like to read ezekiel chapter nine we want to read verse one to six and verse eleven we also want to read in john chapter fourteen 15 to 21 and we want to read revelation chapter 7 verse 1 to 4. we read ezekiel 9 1 to 6 and then we see them he cried also in my ears with a lord voice singing calls them that have charge over the city to draw near even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which lied towards the north and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them was clewed with linen with the writer's ink on by his side and they went in and stood beside the brazen altar the glory of the god of israel was going on from the cherub whereupon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the righteous income by his side and the lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be then done in the midst thereof unto the others he said in my hearing go after him through the city and smite let not your eyes spear neither have a pity slay utterly old and young both maids little children and woman but come not near any man upon whom mr mark can begin at my sanctuary then they begin with the ancient men which were before the house and verse 11 reads and behold the man included with linen which had the income by his side reported the matter seeing i have done as god has commanded me so in john chapter 14 verse 15 if you love me keep my commandments and i will pray the father he'll give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it sees him not need to know him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while and the world sees me no more but you see me because i live you shall live also and that day you shall know that i am in my father and you and me and i knew he that had my commandments and keepeth them he it is that love at me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i would love him i will manifest myself to him in revelation chapter 7 in verse 1 and after these things i saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth hole in the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth no on the sea nor any tree and i saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the living god and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to her the earth and the sea saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of our god and their foreheads and i heard a number of them which were sealed and they were sealed 144 000 of all the tribes of the children of israel father god we pray that you would bless this word interpret our hearts in jesus name i ask it amen you may be seated wow uh i've tried this morning the ceiling angel was a title this morning the ceiling angel and uh if you note that the scripture that we read in ezekiel 9 where god started to begin he said begin at my sanctuary begin at my sanctuary is not something and to think that the scripture speak about uh the the the the lord voice saying caused him to have charged over the city to draw near every man with his destroying weapon in his hand but before they hit the city it hit the sanctuary hit the church it's not something i wonder if people have considered that first peter 4 17 18 says for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of god and if it be first begin with at us what shall the end be of them that will be not the gospel of god and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear so this is something worth noting that there was is come a time the judgment and the bible will use this term must begin at the house of god that is before the city before instructions before other places you see so i know uh people may be concerned about the mark of the beast and the council of churches and the churches closing down but that is not the emphasis this morning uh we want to look at this a ceiling angel this silly ninja because destruction is on its way and and it's troubling to see people have a casual attitude about god a casual attitude about a message a casual attitude about god's wrath very casual you know you come like you see preachers and and people speak in the word without fear of god they see what they want to see how they want to see it as if they don't understand that we are all in the palm of his hands and if he move his hands then we all would fall and god already spoke that that terrible is coming and he talked about behold i send you elijah the prophet before and great and terrible day of the lord and we find out that elias has already come and god sent elijah the prophet in this last day for us to escape to become the escape ones isn't that right and ezekiel the slaughtering angel was not not mercy angels the bible called them the slaughtering angels and if you have not listened to that bible study the story of jehu you should listen to it because it describes when the anointing of judgment is upon a man or upon a city upon a world nothing stops it it's it's cruel it's it's destructive it's nothing stopping it and this scripture we read it says slay utterly male female young old little children have no pity but come not near those with that mark hallelujah so when that time breaks when the announcement when it is announced then the question is that who is your pastor the question is not where you go to church the question is not how long in the message the question is not how much knowledge you have the question is not how much mysteries that you have or how much revelation of mysteries that they have the question becomes do you have the mark not a mac but d mark the mark that god expect and god require the seal of god hallelujah praise the name of the lord they have to have a seal in time because that angel from the east we read read about that angel of power and authority to tell the other four angels that are already in position they ain't coming you know they're already in position they've taken instructions from the angel from the east say hurt not the sea hurt not the earth don't hurt anything until hallelujah the jews be sealed this seated angel this angel from the east have a commission to make sure that 144 000 elected jews are sealed but before they are sealed there's elected bride to be sealed it's one seal it's the seal of god oh hallelujah is one holy ghost baptism even as there's one lord even as there's one fate oh hallelujah praise god so the sealing angel has the power and authority to speak and instruct the angels of destruction that is already on the earth hallelujah that is already on the earth in position oh hallelujah when you talk about that destruction isaiah 13 16 11 talk about holy for the day of the lord is at hand it shall come as a destruction from the almighty therefore shall all hands be faint and every man's heart shall melt and they shall be afraid pangs and souls shall take a hold of them they shall be as pain as a woman in travail they shall be amazed one at another their faces shall be as flames behold the day of the lord cometh cruel both with rat and fierce anger to lead the land desolate he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it for the stars of the heaven and this constellations thereof shall not give their light the sun shall be darkened it is going forth on the moon shall not cause the light to shine and i will punish the world for the evil and the wicked for the iniquity and i will cause the arrogancy of the power to cease and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible o glory to god this angel of god hallelujah i hear the prophet says to see whether this message that we got is connected with it or not the very hour that israel was signed to be a nation the very hour the very hour that israel was signed to be a nation it was the very same hour the very same day the very same month everything else i was at greenville indiana when the angel appeared to me and sent me out on the field with this after he met me down in the river and told me what would take place then commissioned me 11 years later at the same hour that israel was signing the nation it's all connected together the angel of the lord is an earth now he is moving around and fixing everything for the coming of the lord so 1946 don't come and angel samawa israel declare the nation same hour this prophet come to this gentile bride to be commissioned hallelujah with a message that will take three pulls to call a bride out oh glory to god first person second pull that purple that gonna catch the rainbow trout they're gonna get that bride hallelujah 1946 angelina fixing things are wrong he's still in the earth fixing things are wrong oh glory to god listen hallelujah praise be to jesus thank you lord oh glory to god the upper room there to wait 10 days hallelujah but god put a word to us i will return it to thee according to the time of life next 20 days there will come a time of life for the brain it will be a seal in time all glory to god when god will seal us from faith all the way to charity a ceiling time gonna be on it'll be on around the world a ceiling time for the bride there is no escape from it it has to happen it's got to happen that's why he said we are striving to enter into the kingdom of god before these plagues strike o glory to god hallelujah and elohim veiled in the prophet was the same elohim that was veiled that appeared to abraham and gave him a promise i will return and that return wasn't a man coming wasn't a man from america wasn't another prophet another man of the hour it was dynamics to the mechanics to change abraham body and that return is coming i will ride this trail once more not another man but the same holy spirit the same white horse rider the same angel from the east the same incorn writer he's going to ride the trail once more there is going to be a ceiling for sure oh give the lord some praises hallelujah thank you lord thank you lord so i hope that today's service would shake you rock you shake us and rock us to battle and wrestle like jacob until we meet that angel and we get that supernatural touch that only god can give hallelujah not man but god can give man could give words but god could give that supernatural that is veil behind the world he is in charge of that he is in charge of that peter was in charge of the words coming out of his mouth but while peter speak those words the holy ghost peter ain't charged at that part all glory to god peter didn't even know that was going to happen he was just saying a testimony and words was coming out of his mouth but while peter was speak speaking those words the holy ghost fell on them that heard the word and i pray this morning the holy ghost fall upon you because we are not in charge of that is god in charge of that oh hallelujah man could speak oh glory to god but has got to confirm the word spoken hallelujah out of the lips of a man who to battle and fight and wrestle until you be sealed from revelation book of symbols he said god in this last days is going to draw two hearts from everywhere no matter how much counterfeit and chaff the devil has god will rise this church right out of it it will be a ceiling for sure as i am standing in this platform it will be what a ceiling for sure as he is standing on the platform it will be a ceiling and we read a quote already one day of message gonna come and you'll either be sealed in or sealed out the kingdom o glory to god hallelujah he says many shall run to and fro and the people that know their god shall do exploits in that day gods revelation to the church sets the little flock he said keep holding on don't worry god is waiting and trying and pressing to get that mystery of god revealed to his church who is doing god oh glory is waiting we talk about we written on god god is waiting and trying and pressing to get that mystery of god revealed to his church that is what is holding back the coming of christ now and the great millennium is this great supernatural power that really lays dormant in the church what the great supernatural power that lays dormant in the church you really think after all two thousand years god expects some bride to sit down in a church and bowling amen hallelujah glory and then go home to the rapture when satan come and gods even and mess up things and god will wait for satan to accomplish his season to come and rip a bride and pull up build the veil of this bride and put her on display that bribe will be displaying the supernatural dude that driver will display signs and wonders and miracles and the power of god that supernatural is laying in the church and we haven't seen it yet oh give the lord a shout in the house oh hallelujah praise god amen amen hallelujah hallelujah so while madame luck was bombing her here and getting a fight down in sodom and the angel come along to get her out and she had couldn't control she she couldn't she had no she had started move out of sodom but the heart is what kept her there and make her turn back and turn into pillars so but abraham but sarah was different she was up there with her husband she was called out and sealed away by a promise that she was going to have a visitation from a son that was coming all glory for our son that was coming sarah was different she was with her husband husband held known for her because god didn't speak to syria husband had to tell syria what god promised promise us a son abram can make no child have to come to syria so he have to prophesy for himself and prophesy for his woman prophesy for his wife and he had to believe god for her and really go for himself he couldn't divorce sarah he couldn't put on sarah the house you have to stay right there because god tell him to sarah you're going to have this son or give the lord a shout and this morning and he said i will return unto d and before the prophet left he gave us a promise of dynamics to the mechanics so we are not ashamed of the son of man know his words we ain't shame and not one promise inside of here i ain't come to talk about pope i ain't come to talk about rome i have come to talk about mark of the beast i'm talking about the seal of the living god i'm here to talk about the promise of god to me to promise to you the bride's revival glory to god this is what i'm here for this is what i'm called to do oh hallelujah not to kill time then the pulpit and stretch the hours dawn because we are plenty to talk by these promises we become a partaker of his divine nature oh give the lord some praises hallelujah and so sarah type church today called out hallelujah letting the world do anything they want to do that's none of her business she is keeping a mind on the promise and i want you to encourage you this morning keep your mind on the promise keep your mind on the promise let trump do what trump want to do let america burn down if you have to put him down but you keep your mind on the promise oh glory to god we don't know what's going to happen next every day is uncertain it's a certain uncertain song every single day but when we hear the scripture when we hear these promises it's a certain song oh glory to god i will return unto thee according to the time of life john didn't make no mistake he said i saw an angel arise from the east having the sea of the living god not no fightful not no pastor not no bishop it was an angel it was the seal of angel that angel is here to seal you into the kingdom of god or give the lord a shout i trust you feel the anointing where you are that's how we are feelings inside of here oh glory to god hallelujah so sarah she was keeping her mind on the promise oh god help me jesus back in the old testament there was a year called the jubilee it was the year that all the captive scopes be set free every man that had been in captivity could go free it must have been a great meaning to this day or what is stood for in time oh hallelujah many hundred years has passed god have sent the jubilee in them days is the same god who sends jubilee today all the people have been captured so are you in captivity this morning you could go free some pastor kept you some church creed are you born praise god because you made a long dress you figure you're in the kingdom of god because you have a long dress and you have a book and you believe a prophet that is a lie you know hallelujah you better get the holy ghost he said mary the reason mary had was to go in the upper room to get the holy ghost is because mary was born a mortal and she had to be born again to go up into heaven so mary didn't have a bligh or her excuse because i said be it done unto me according to that word and that makes you eliminate or excuse her from the upper room she had to go and style with them like the rest of them she had to die out like the rest of them she had to fall along like the rest of them she had to scream like the rest of them try to get pack out like the rest of them and so would you oh give the lord some praises hallelujah chica came to be mother of god and mother jesus she still had to hit the upper room we'll give the lord some praises if god is pear mary god is sparing you sitting on with your longest and your church hallelujah glory to god amen thank you lord all the ones that were in captivity didn't have to pay any price they could absolutely go free they could drop their whole if they were going whatever they were instrument they were working with and they could go and be free that was by choice if they did not want to go free then they would call to the temple and their master would bore their air and they would have to save this master forever then this person that did not want to go free had to be sealed aha if you don't want to get go free you're going to get sealed here you'll be sealed out a beautiful type of the day of the seal of god or the marking of the beast which has been so much disputed what it was now fake on my hearing hearing the word of god right then when we hear that we are free here we go and refuse to act upon our freedom then we will be sealed to my opinion to be sealed away from god is to receive the mark of the beast so you see how you bring it now they go close we don't or you care buy and sell is that right people don't understand the ceiling going on now you're being marked to be filled with the holy ghost or mark to be judged oh glory to god remember cain went off the presence of god and was marked that was the first mark come from but before you as matthew went out of presence the bride will be coming into presence oh glory to god know that when the hero of the heard the jubilee song if you if he didn't want to be free then he had to be sealed and it is today that when men and women hear this marvelous gospel of the lord jesus christ and of the baptism of the holy ghost you are the same place where you have to make a choice you can never hear and be the same you accept it and receive christ if you refuse it you are seated away from christ oh glory it's your attitude towards the hearing of the word of god hallelujah praise god in acts 19 when they drop above the holy ghost then people say we even know we have that they say don't make jokes it have that said but how will he baptize he's under john baptism he said that yet again but it's over again it has something called holy spirit we have been here but no holy ghost there are people in the message they didn't hear about the holy ghost because they have been taught once you receive the message of the holy ghost which is a lie but a man was addressing that to the pentecostal who claimed to have an experience of the holy ghost he said if you have the holy ghost you will receive this word so people come in the message read when you believe the word you have the holy ghost and they believe the old self is holy ghost some some even believe they are the holy ghost demons lying to them doctrines of devils some even believe they are the holy ghost oh my god hallelujah when the seal and angel for the brown message fellowship by redemption crossed through the country he was commanded to put a mark upon those who sigh and cry oh you mean the ink on writer is this you in angel yes same angel in ezekiel they call him the ink one writer in revelation 7 they call calling the angel from the east but here the prophecy when they see an angel crossed through the country he was commanded to put a mark upon those who sigh and cried for the abominations done in the city and i see this with reverence now and respect don't get mad at me angry brother but what if what if that ceiling angel crossed this nation today where would he find men so deeply consecrated the god for the sins of this crumbling nation till they cried day and night for the sins where would he mark the church that fast and pray and long j lord jesus where would he find that person you say out of there come a man dressed in white let's stop a minute dressed in white righteousness holiness dressed in white he had an ink on by his side go to the city first and before they come and put a mark upon the forehead and mark upon the fourth every man woman boy and girl in the city that size and cries for the abomination that did in the city he said put a mark upon them and then he went to unmark and return back it is done then he said the man go for it don't spare nothing but utterly slay everything that hasn't got the mark upon it lucky here brother that marker here we go was none other than the holy spirit so the student angel is the ink on writer and the income writer is the holy spirit and notice if he come to justin civil tonight uh to the branham tabernacle or to any other time like in the city or any church who would he put a mark upon notice what he said he has said he will have books and tapes and plain tips in berlin or any other tabernacle he said who you're going to put the mark upon so this message for all these years oh glory is supposed to bring us in condition to receive the mark ah oh glory look at how many see that this morning right in your home says shout out amen hallelujah this message of preparation that is what is about what's the sense being a message and we're not prepared prepared for what for the press when you press come down not that the press come down you have no mark you're messed up you're finished prepared for the mark because the angel have to put that mark hallelujah and the anointing upon him is to look for those who sigh look for those who cry look for those who hungering and taste after righteousness is a scripture for that blessed are the deed of hunger until after righteousness this shall be filled there's a scripture seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all other things shall be added there's a scripture no pastor can force you to seek god you have to want to see god supposed to pass the backslidden hallelujah you got to seek him for yourself and work out your own salvation with fear and trembling oh people have to wake up hallelujah and fight for your inheritance hallelujah killer didn't wait for the other tribes to call for their stuff he said no

taking everything with you your card games everything else every other thing that you can load into the church you're trying to take with you god just condemns it you ain't ready for a ceiling wait a minute brother over do you mean we ought to be ready for our ceiling yes that's what i'm preaching you have to be ready for this ceiling you have to ready to meet the ceiling angel you could meet me after service you know you could shake my hand i can't see you that job is a stealing angel job there's no scripture man ceiling man they don't have that in the scripture you have to steal an angel dropping down to seal goes outside and cry it has the ink on writer that is coming to bring mercy because judgment is next anytime you say angel ink on writer steal an angel that is mercy that's jubilee trumpet that is you could go free okay the lord has shout you can break out you can bust out you can break out the bondage you could come out of your prison when god but when god sees a man what kind of man contrite broken spirit sincere heart done at the altar god closes the door of the world to him and sees him in deer by the baptism of the holy ghost and it lasts until jesus comes not from one revival to another but until the day of your redemption when that boxcar the door is closed and they go and put the seal up on it you cannot open it no more until it's reached the final destination and every man that's born again and sealed into the kingdom of god has no more desire of the world until the day that jesus christ take him into the kingdom so if you are having trouble and seeing you've got the holy ghost where they belong you have to take all the loose way oh my and get it out hallelujah mary magdalene didn't realize the spirits that was on her and when you get that kind of spirit on you men you get out of there and start lusting for women you say well it's human nature not like that no it's a spirit the bible said it was a spirit that's right and the thing to do then the blood of jesus christ cleanses you from lust and passion called sanctification now the word sanctification means to be clean and set aside for service now that lust spirit leaves you under sanctification let our little lady nice goes to church she sings in the choir she has to move her grass a little bit of shorts on let her get sanctified one time and let her put on appear you said that almost have a wreck looking at the woman in the yard i let him get simplified one time and go down the street he will keep his mind on what he's doing that's right oh my that is signification you are not sealed by sanification you are sealed by the baptism of the holy spirit a ceiling is the completion of the work and that's the reason it couldn't be seen on the luther wesley either one so it's the holy spirit all along and that's the portion of the holy spirit this is a greater portion of the holy spirit then when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost that's the completion of the holy spirit taking this abode in you to manifest gifts speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues and gifts of power wisdom knowledge understanding oh praise god hallelujah oh my so this true bride will be made out of thousands times thousands of people but it will be the elect out of every age every time a message went fought and the people believed it and accepted it and the light it was they were sealed away until the day of redemption so the lutheran was sealed away by justification they experienced give the lord a shout hallelujah the wesleyan was sealed away by sanctification it was an experience oh my hallelujah he said they were so sanctified hallelujah that the holy ghost you come upon them and they had buckets of water because when they get packed out on the floor they used to throw water to revive them because they couldn't get it because it wasn't it yet but they were so sanctified that it attracted the holy ghost could you imagine a stunning right but praising and worshiping god and i just sit in the church bam holy ghost come upon you but yeah you're ready you're ready for the cylinder to seal you into the kingdom of god hallelujah sanification and worship oh my hallelujah so when jesus died calvary what happened his soul was his was his spirit ascended into hell and he rose and god picked up his body and gave him life took the body of jesus set to the right hand of glory and sent back the holy ghost as a covenant there you are don't fall short of that brother without the battle of the holy ghost you are lost but if the spirit of god is in there the spirit can back up a little bit that's the only you don't have to worry about getting to heaven lost if there's nothing in there supernatural the doors can't unlock you could walk in there and bump your head against it but if the spirit of god is in deer the spirit of god inside it unhinged the doors oh my so jesus was tore apart right his soul went to god god blessed him his soul written back in the form of the baptism of the holy ghost that comes into every believer shout out every believer every believer it's supposed to to be and clean up the mind clean up the heart clean up a porsche and and leave a portion of the holy ghost in there hallelujah oh glory to god so what did john said he shall baptize you with the holy ghost i'm with fire and barbara explained the fire come to burn the snake in your heart because the snake is there even when you get baptized in water the snake is there you hear any way they bully him and glory hallelujah and those sweets are touching jesus and jesus is sweeter than the day before and everything else all them nice phrases and stuff snakes still there hallelujah that snake ain't moving till fire come hollywood we can pour word word mystery on top of that deeper mystery hidden mystery mystery after mystery seals in the back sealed in the front seat in the middle wherever the seals are all over the seals jump all that up on that that snake and moving but you see when fire come out of them seals oh glory to god when fire come out of them seals snakes have to go oh glory to god and then the dove take up the snake place oh hallelujah that's what anas and sapphira did not understand they thought they know brother peter because they're talking about the pizza yes now but fire burned in peter's heart the dove was sitting inside of there a rainbow was along the throne because a portion of the holy ghost was resident oh glory to god not temporary power that's what he had in in matthew 10 but this was permanent in power when they asked about him he said you don't like that man you like to do what he goes i alter this thing man oh glory to god peter have powers working with him he opened this thing he's not in charge of that he said this division i'm not in charge of that that division like the vision of god hallelujah after that people had come into the church and the bible said the lord added to the jewish yes no man don't want to join them people because they know fire power pillar fight inside of there liar's staying out hypocrites staying out fornicators staying out adulterously involved mis amen lust us distain out oh glory to god and the prophet prophecy there will be a church like that in the last days i'm fighting for it we're going to have a church like that a church with a shout of the king in the camp jesus christ will be walking in it oh glory to god hallelujah so watch so jesus here the holy ghost comes into every believer to sanctify clean up the mind clean up the heart and leave a portion of the holy ghost in there and when the holy ghost is given out that same holy spirit that brought the body of jesus out of the great will rapture remember i talk about the magnet it's not you being raptured it's what inside are you being raptured remember i keep saying the rapture is inside out are they not going any rapture you ain't going no way the raptor will be inside of you hallelujah because when that magnesium saturday and the cat mark that the main mag that the chief magnet comes he'll pick you up you have to go they can't leave you all you are magnetizing the headstone the headstone coming the stone cut out without the hands of man no fight for cutting that out no message pope got no doubt oh glory to god that that stone cut out with all the hands of man oh hallelujah in the eighth kingdom the god will fall and the kingdom of god will be established oh praise the name of the lord hallelujah praise be to you where did judas show himself judas was preaching with them shouting with them jumping with them he said he was shouting and rejoicing too he followed the church right on down to the count of the pentecost and when it comes to pentecost to receive the to receive the baptism of the holy ghost is he refused it and betray christ and that was the antichrist and that spirit today here we go will come and done and teach justification my feet and everything move right on and down to the baptismal holy ghost then show his colors they can't handle that see his baptism this thing this holy ghost fire thing like trouble hallelujah easier for the mystery thing because because um you take the crowbar and rip off the top and an unwritten word yeah yeah unwritten word and that is why it's not written because that is spirit word that the unwritten word hallelujah cries hid in his own word looking like it on written but he is here and as the bride open christ the word she sees him and connect with him because she he is her the husband the revealed word oh glory to god hallelujah not the mind might be pulled back to the husband christ is your husband because you are wife of the lamb oh give the lord some praises people thank you lord so but so so watch the ten versions five why is five foolish you say brother i don't go down says i don't go shows that's just a moral thing unless they have been a supernatural not because you shouted not because you spoke in tongues not because you jump up and down but something supernatural has happened in here that changed you then you received away in god you were anchored not any fleshly demonstration or emotion but something has happened in here that change your whole opinion change your whole nature you are converted not you but christ has come into you and converted you your nature is dead the old man the old and you're born a new man oh hallelujah you said i believe i believe in jesus christ then god gives you the baptism holy ghost as a sign that he accepted your fate and then you are sealed into the kingdom of god abraham hallelujah first you believe and then god had abraham and his children his seed circumcised as a sign and he gives you the holy ghost today as a sign what does circumcision do what was the whole object of ibrahim being circumcised to cut off surplus flesh that is always natural all the things of the world it circumcises you from the things of the world the love of the world the love of the flesh the pride of life it circumcises you from that you have nothing to do with it it does it itself and puts the love of jesus christ it was an undying love so what is he saying is this you could play monk uh forget hold him shave the head and stuff hire my harukisha people you could play mountain water and have nothing with the world woman and whatnot that's you then them meditating and closing their eyes and meditating and and you know messing up their head and stuff they have no new operation god you know that is power human and moral behavior and stuff he is talking about something supernatural that coming into you that changing your desires that you know is god is good i was so but now i am so i was to do that i said i should live that way but no i'm living different you could see as the hand of god upon your life is something supernatural that has has affected you and infected you that's what we're talking about then you're gonna say election abraham justification is isaac jacob uh grace and julia perfection there's not one thing recorded against joseph that is perfection hated of his brother isn't that right and his father gave him a quota many colors and if you watch that robe without seeing hallelujah which represented the holy spirit that covered his being so it wasn't just a robe of colors that was represented the holy ghost and then the prophet said he said and which you say and today the holy spirit that covers the church the robe of many colors and there are seven colors in the rainbow it's all tied together so joseph and type which represented through the perfection had a rainbow coat which represented the holy ghost upon the church that same rainbow fate virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness hallelujah that has to be displayed you hear what i said not talk to you know i appreciate it talking it that has to be displayed it has to be seen what glory the god seen hallelujah praise god davis have to see it the world have to see it your family have to see it it will be christ and you the hope of glory the invisible become invisible because the word has become flesh oh give the lord a shout praise god amen hallelujah praise god he was to look at ruben stone sadness benjamin first and last he was to look upon the first and the last a rainbow around his head seven golden candlesticks a rainbow there we go a covenant that god has made through abraham to isa to christ through the church by the baptism of the holy ghost the robe of seven colors that was upon joseph that was upon jesus is upon the church today you mean joseph rope was upon jesus yes he was filled with the holy ghost without measure hallelujah that robe have to come upon the bride if he is the example seat son and he had an experience at the jordan where you get your experience not be it done under me according to your word people like to talk about general that sounds good mary said that be it done unto me according to the world america conceivably your son yeah that's the same way you have to hit up a room say something nice be it done under me according to that word and something quick mary didn't feel nothing burram said she didn't feel nothing she just ruined liza better said grab a baby he made me call jesus and john's had to jump inside her bedroom she had feeling nothing and that's what we had to become we just received the word what's the secret the word is in the brain hallelujah then come what the spirit to activate the word that's in the bride why because the word is a seed who shows the seed sun a man so sonam had to come back again to sow seed what seed the original seed is a bible seed because the word was lost to the ages so you have to gather all the word to bring it into a seed what the seed must produce the son of god again oh glory to god because after son of man is son of god after son of god will be son of david oh give the lord a shout did you get what i'm saying son of man then the holy ghost fell in the upper room son of god spirit coming upon the sons in the upper room the produced son of god seven church ages son of god then come back a prophecy and even thus challenge being the day when the son of man is revealed luke 17 30 son and come back again to bring seed hallelujah after he saw seed what happened the enemy hallelujah the enemy come and see so this is logical this is accepted this is the word we are worried about that who preach and false which are all kind of crazy stuff that is the seed of the devil i have nothing to do with that they are their own hallelujah i am interested in the solomon seed sown for the bride a question was asked when the solomon cometh shall we find faith on the earth oh glory to god not talk faith faith have works that goes with it oh glory to god man can fool me hallelujah could talk you talk talk and talk but shall we find faith on the earth let's finally find churches massachusetts and tabernacle and this tabernacle and this prayer no no shall we find faith on youth and that figure be expressed because he was sent a prophet to turn our hearts back to the feet of the fathers oh glory to god and peter didn't have no education to pump new set of mysteries and all kind of thing but they have to take note you've been with jesus oh glory to god and this bride hallelujah they had to take note that she had been with jesus all glory to god because the works of jesus will be manifested through her he said by and through the bride will be fulfilled all so don't worry the bribe will fulfill all whether she educated or not whether she informed or not whether she know mysteries or not because christ in her is the mystery of all what are they talking about oh glory to god amen hallelujah and i'm saying tonight my christian friend no matter what church you belong to wherever you are if you are not into the kingdom of god by the baptism of the holy spirit bringing you into the body of christ you press him now for you don't know what all he's coming he said okay what you should and i don't care what group you belong to what church who's your pastor is you have to press on he said cain realized what he had did he went off from the presence of god and was sealed away from god by a mark that was placed upon him so the seal going both ways sealed into god and seal away from god the seal away from god is the mark of the beast but every man getting a seal oh hallelujah all that well on the earth shall worship the beast except those whose names are written in the lamb spoke of oh blessed be the name of the lord oh glory to god so he saw revelation 7 chapter are we going good hallelujah praise the name of the lord he said watch revelation the seventh chapter there where we'll end up the gentile dispensation watch his timing watch revelation the seventh chapter and he's turning into ezekiel 9. he said revelation the seventh chapter where we will end up the gentile dispensation see if it's right or not that was where the prophet of ezekiel 9 prophesied the ending of that age now here the holy spirit is prophesying the end of this age so he is connecting ezekiel 9 with revelation chapter seven what is ezekiel 9 go and put a mark upon those that sigh and cry and after that be slaughtering angels what is revelation 7 hold back the four angels of destruction until the jews be sealed all glorious the gentiles have to be sealed and jews have to be sealed the closing of the gentile age is a sealant god seals off the gentiles and then goes to the jews to steal 144 000. listen to what he says you know after these things i saw four angels that was four horse riders when fought after the sixth chapter i saw four angels standing in the four corner of the earth holding the four winds that it should not blow up on the earth upon the sea no watch the vision he first saw i saw four angels standing at the four corners places around the eighth angel hole in the four winds and i saw another angel from the east having the s-e-a-l he spelled us out seal the finished work in other words having the seal of the living god and he cried loud voicing the angels he was given the hurt hurt not the earth or see until we have sealed the servants of god in the forehead then he talked about so much from the tribe of benjamin and and babylon and so on like that and after this after this i saw a great multitude that no man could number all kindred nation he said where did they come up from you seen the ceiling away of those jews at the end but when the angel was given forth to go and destroy he said i seen them where these come from all kindred and the prophet said they were clothed with white robes and palms in the hand that's the bride the gentile bride had been sealed away here oh give the lord a shout oh glory to god your meanings are sealed with a gentile right yes that's why here comes the angel from the east it's the stealing angel oh glory to god and the angels wrong about the throne elders four beasts fell on the throne on their faces and worshiped god saying listen if this don't sound like a holy ghost meeting blessing and wisdom and thanksgiving and power unto the glory of god forever and ever oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah praise god so this is no pleating this is no game he said in northern nation remember this morning lesson these virtues has to be in there before the capstone can even come on it you might shout you might sing you might speak with tongues and dance that has nothing at all to do with it until these things are scripturally proven and sealed into you the holy spirit seals you as an individual then you are sons and daughters i love that so there's no church ceiling there's no group sealing that why he said no church can hold the holy ghost it will leak right out nobody could say i have it you don't have it that's foolishness you don't have no scripture for that hallelujah they can have their teachings and doctrines and revelation that is their own but you see the holy ghost no man are controlling that oh give the lord a shout i love that this is what has given me excited you see what man number six he got in charge of that he he got hold and said i have it your church not getting it no no no no you could you have something else you're on your own with that like foolishness oh that's why he's telling them those when they say the kingdom here he said whatever with them the kingdom is within you bully them fool you that are coming from the kingdom you're taking from the kingdom no no the kingdom is within you the kingdom is the word turn spirit and power in your life that's the kingdom inside of you or give the lord a shout hallelujah give the lord some praises glory to god hallelujah so the income rider our glory the god is a sealed angel and the stealing angel is the holy spirit and the holy spirit is the white horse rider isn't that right thank you lord jesus hallelujah so but i brought her in oneness he says the bible says in the last days there's going to be churches another power babel they'll have a form of godliness to deny god's word and power the power of his word what is the word what is the kingdom of god we've got to belong to the kingdom before we can be subjects of the king i love that did you hear that the king not in charge of nobody not belonging to the kingdom the king and that is where they get the kingdom from it's the domain of the king because the king is the boss the king is in charge so when you belong to the kingdom the king protects you the king had to feed you hal the king had to help you hallelujah the king covering you because that is his domain so you cannot be subject to the king if they're not in the kingdom oh glory to god hallelujah thank you lord he said what is the kingdom we belong to our kingdom before we can never be subject of the king how many knows that he see amen well how do you get into the kingdom how here we go the kingdom of god is the word of god made back in power so we appreciate mysteries let the machine turn into power let me see where that message really is you're preaching word let it work on the power that's the kingdom oh hallelujah here we are the end time coming from the east west north south what are we doing getting ready for that rapture getting ready holding ourselves steady for a few minutes till every fiber is filled with the holy ghost oh you mean after all this teaching and preaching for 50 plus years we had to hold steady for a few minutes to be filled every fiber yes how do you expect this motor to put on immortality this transformation had to come from inside out hallelujah can't put a two-volt battery and you have a big engine a big engine is you have to start that thomas engine you cannot tumble an engine with a torch like that tree you have to get the power on the inside the tomilac engine so to move on to the rapture you have to get rapturing power otherwise known as rapture and faith not norman said no rapture in faith that you could believe that you'll be changed in a moment and a twinkle of an eye hallelujah he's calling people together in true oneness with himself by his holy spirit isn't that right hallelujah by one spirit we are all individually baptized into one body collectively the body of jesus christ and is jesus living with his spirit in your flesh serving the church and doing the same things signs and then sign that you love him you're ready for the rapture and the word of god is a sword here we go and it takes a hand to hold the sword it takes that hand of fate and that hand of fate it depends upon how strong it is this hand of feet might just be strong enough to cut out a little hole and say by fate i'm saved that's a great cut but then if a stronger hand the whole that sword of a strong hand it will cut plump to everything the devil can put out there and make every promise shine through in the power of his resurrection strong on our feet you could cut up what you want you could go down lord that give you a blessing they cut the blessing out and you could cut out to be filled with the holy ghost and he being the groom and the bride has to come forth because it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations and others that spoke of the bride let me read it again this thing worthy of reading again he being the groom the bride has to come forward cause it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfillment of all the revelations that spoke of the bride it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride because he is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power is power oh glory to god so the bride will be the manifestation of the promised word not talkation it has to come into our manifestation hallelujah oh my dynamics to the mechanics the world will not be able to withstand it i'll reason up again last day that's the easter message the dynamics and mechanics together mechanics without dynamics no good neither is dynamics without mechanics you can scream shout jump up and down all you want it won't do no good it'll only work as they come together so will one set still and the other one will go up the only thing of it has got to be you have you might look alike here we go both claim to be churches both claim to be bright but one has mechanics and dynamics it brings to pass of what he said is the truth it just won't move no matter how good the mechanics is until the dynamics are so the mysteries and revelations and doctrines and teachings can be laid well out in well in order until dynamics come oh praise god it can't move and then he says you know in the church of the living god this morning lays the power oh hallelujah to heal all sickness in the church of the
