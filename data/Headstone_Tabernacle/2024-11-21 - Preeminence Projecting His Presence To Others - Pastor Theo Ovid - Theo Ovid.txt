Bibles to Colossians chapter 1 we want to read from verse 9 to8 and we certainly appreciate brother uh Pastor Timothy redhead the message on Sunday being identified in faith and not by attributes of unbelief the Bible even said let the weak say I am strong in other words don't go and confess the negative and confess the unbelief no confess What God Says in his word is true reading Colossians 1 reading verse 9 for this cause also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding that you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God strengthened with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness specific words giving thanks unto the Father which had made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light who had delivered us from the power of darkness and had translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities ities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence is May God is bless his word you may be seated oh it's great to be here tonight see all of you out here tonight that's is really wonderful well I have a title tonight preeminence projecting his presence to others that's the title night preeminence projecting his presence to others but BR he said notice God had a three-fold purpose in his great in this great mystery secret this great mystery secret he had before the world began he had a three-fold purpose the first fold of that purpose was God wanted to reveal himself to the people in the memorial I was talking about time was given to us to fulfill purpose but not only us was given to fulfill purpose God himself have a purpose God is Not Without aim God have an objective just as we have time and within that space of time we are called to fulfill purpose God himself have a purpose and the first thing he wanted to get across was to reveal himself to the people because he was too mysterious so the question was how do I reveal myself to these humans to these people on the Earth isn't that right he couldn't do it as great Jehovah God who covered all space Time and Eternity he is too great ever to be revealed to the people because it would be too mysterious how a great being that never did begin and Beyond the cycle of a 100 billions and trillions and trillions of years of light space out into the infinite into eternity a great creator that was and but what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood for he was a father and the only way he could express it was to become a son of man son of man Hallelujah and that's the reason Jesus keeps saying son of man they didn't know what he was talking about but do you get it he wanted to express himself that is what his one of his great threefold purpose was to express himself to identify himself with human beings to reveal himself in Christ secondly here we go to have the [Music] the third is to restore the kingdom that Adam lost Back to Eden so listen what was Jesus manifested for to show God he was God he had to be no man could die no Prophet could die he was God he was the god of the prophets he was the prophets he was the Kings he was the history he was that was to come he what was was that is the same yesterday today and forever he was manifested for that purpose and through that purpose Jesus purpose now amen he will achieve a church yes sir that he the fullness of God might bring to pass every promised word of God in these last days we can't fail we can't afford to fail oh give the Lord a shout because Jesus came to accomplish this purpose so when he says finish something happen it's really finish in truth it has to unfold right now give the Give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah so he said Jesus said he that believeth on me the works that I do shall you do also even more than this shall you do because I go to my father see that was his purpose there was the manifestation and now today he wants to get somebody shout to somebody he wants to get somebody that they could see it and they could let the word come and have the prayer Min in their lives you have to see it first you have to understand it first it's not about you it's about him and in all things he might have the pinen is I say it's not about you it's not about me it's about him oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah praise God Amen watch oh this is so beautiful when he seen his creation had fallen his own loving character molding himself into the person of Christ God's own character of Love projected himself in the man Christ Paul speaking said think it not rubbery but make himself equal to God rather his own character molded that kind of person no one ever could do it but God this was done so he could pay the penalty of the fall of creation Oh Glory to God in other words the devil had a strapped bong finish but he projected his love and that love as a projection projected Jesus Christ oh God we love him tonight it projected Jesus Christ the Redeemer the Savior oh give the Lord a shout what for for his purpose on the earth God in service to die to pay the price and say Satan I paid for them Hallelujah I paid for them I brought them back to get us back where Back to Eden oh give the Lord a shout but before we go back to Eden he must have the pinenes Oh Glory to God hallelujah something had to be projected out of us oh give the Lord a shout in the house Hallelujah there must be something save his creation nothing could save it because the highest species of his creation had fallen and everything under it fell with it because it fell because remember we say let us make man in our own image so all the giraffes monkeys um dinosaurs everybody was under that so when man fell the boss gone then the animals running Havoc Lions had the bite this on had the r this one carry on and whatnot and the boss gone the boss finish the boss fall so God had to come down to be one of us to get us back oh glory to God that's how the word became flesh that's how the invisible became visible we handled him the word of life Oh Glory to God it's not just a text oh glory to God but it's the word of life he said I come that you might have life and have it more abundantly he told them people he said you you you you search the scriptures but in them you think you have eternal life but they testify of me all you have is text all you have is written word but I am the living bread I am the living word that came down from heaven that a man that eat of me shall not die but live oh come the night Hallelujah come and live my brother come and live my sister this Abundant Life oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah the highest speci of his creation had fallen everything under it fell with it because it fell there's only one thing left that did not fail that was God the heavens so something of the heavens had to come down to redeem this creation because there was nothing here that could create it so this creation had to come from above because as far as Earth is concerned Earth is finished like one man say he he don't know what will happen after the third world war but you know what happened in the fourth world war they be fighting with sticks and stones meaning that the third world war would finish everything so he sure for the fourth world war is Sticks and Stones that's all remaining all right so therefore when man fell nobody could help anybody so the word had to come from Heaven that's why Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive because this conception this creation have to come from above all right let's go watch and everything under it fell there's only one thing left that did not fall that was God so something of the heavens had to come down to redeem the creation because there was nothing here that could create it God's Own love for the World created the character expressed in Christ I hope this resonate with you tonight I hope this this just revive your spirit tonight like when you first come to the Lord I hope this that tonight he was God's character he was God's Express image in him was God God in Christ revealing himself to the world and no love could ever be greater than that love such a person could become what he did in order to redeem what has been lost oh praise God here we go projecting himself to make a plan of a Redemption to redeem his Fallen character of ours that was done so that the penalty could be paid because the penalty was debt and one under the sensus of debt could not pay the penalty for the next one under the sensus of debt there had to be somebody come from who was free from debt in order to pay the penalty and none other could come but God because he was the only one that was free from the penalty of debt because the W of sin is Deb that's why Adam died Eve died and all died but Jesus he come from the volume of the book well give the Lord a shout there was no sin in him but he came to pay the penalty therefore let me go let's go his loving character of love it makes it so plain John 3:16 for God this this how oh my this is is like a melody inside here this morning this for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but would have eternal life God projecting himself and become a man that he might upon him the form of a creation in other words he changed his tent Hallelujah and he spread it among human beings infant Jehovah crying a Manger could you imagine it it ought to alarm the hearts of the Believers could you imagine Jehovah being a baby in a Manger a stable of man could you imagine that Jehovah playing as a boy could you imagine him as a teenager could you imagine imagine him as a carpenter shop could you imagine him in such complete obedience to God dying on the cross to redeem Fallen creation that's the kind of love God had he had to become that in order to die to hold the sting of death oh give the Lord a shout in the house and then Jesus come and say who do men say I the son of man am and all I'm happy to talk about others what other saying find in the message know people don't want to talk about themselves they don't want to talk about the revelation some say you're this some say that some say other he said who do you say I am and he caught them Fallen three and a half years they still didn't know how books and tapes they still have no revelation of what the prophet brought talking about seeds and Mysteries and have a clue cluel L and all of a sudden Peter broke through one man th the Christ the son of the Living God then Jesus said Flesh and Blood had not revealed revealed not understand reveal it unto you but my father has revealed it unto you here we go and Upon This Rock of Revelation I will build my church so Jesus have a church and the Gates of Hell Lucifer the fallen angels all way kicked out Heaven can't Prevail against it oh give the Lord a shout he's saiding Lucifer all who was with him that were kicked out of heaven that fall on the earth they can't Prevail against that church oh are you ready tonight Hallelujah are you ready hallah he said the only way you are saved is is by knowing him by Revelation his church here we go is himself revealed that's a message church that's a message church that's a tabernacle that nothing talking about you do you get it now now when he said th Peter upon his Ro my church he wasn't talking to other disciples if the other say that what Christ the Christ they repeating what Peter say what Peter got was from Heaven if anybody said that the Christ after that listening to what Peter said they only repeating what Peter say but Peter heard from his theophany he heard from Heaven he heard from his father you understand what I'm saying now he heard from Heaven that is revelation so his church is what himself revealed so the church real church we don't we don't about this Tabernacle and this group and this church and we not talking about that his church this Rock Church is himself reveal so the church is a revelation hallelujah hallelujah but said this way if you if I take the Presbyterian Doctrine and tie I could tie you Pentecostal till they don't know I can take Baptist Doctrine and show you Pentecostal a million things you know about but that is not it that's why I read it in other words Ty up people with Revelations and Mysteries that people don't know that's not it I know more than you that's not it I have the information your pastor do have because he can he need he need to come up in that level now like somebody said I'm not high enough I'm not preaching deep enough but that's is not it depth preaching deep that's not itall his church is himself revealed do you see it and expressed by the word itself that he is God now watch Joshua and Caleb being tbre by the word of God know God said I give you the land they said we are more than able to take it it depends on when you born from if you are born of the word of God God's word has the preeminent in his church so lies and negativity that doesn't affect you who fall off who St come into church who backslide that doesn't affect you because you're born of the word and you know God can't lie God can't give us a promise about a bride Revival a$7 Bri Revival and God back down on that if God spoke that to a prophet the bride has not Revival us yet he's not talking about church members talking about the bride if will take them seven Thunders to wake up the bride which minister going to stop that from happening that man a liar which minister will refuse to say that when the prophet said it and he say say what the tape say it will take them seven Thunders and he will send it if God could speak that to the prophet he will send it we waiting on it the devil's a liar tonight glory to God there will be a seven Thunder Pride Revival around the world that's only for the bride Give the Lord a shout church members by them thousands but the Bible of a Revival hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God hallelujah may be seated remember Joshua and Caleb just two people in it's 10 other minister they ruling the show with the Min Association you know it's time holding the crow you know but them guys those guys they were word born so they only speaking back the word not the feeling the word all right but God holds this key to this revelation of Christ himself he said if want to read it Matthew 11:25-26 I thank the father Jesus words God Of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid this from the eyes of the wise and prudent in the message and reveal it unto babes such as would learn Oh Glory to God when you're in the learning mode Hallelujah you could get Revelation oh give the Lord a shout in the house after you know what you know and you can still learn you can get Revelation most times after they learn they forget it become Theologian not Revelation look at those Scholars of that day Jews fine men organization Pharisees Sadducees herodians whatever they might be all their great organization Jesus said you are blind you lead the blind did you hear that blind pastors leading blind people in because he can't see and they blind as ever they can't see too he said you are blind you lead the blind well did Des speak of you you have ears and can't hear eyes you can't see CU Isaiah said this is the spirit therefore the god of Heaven has blinded your eyes you're doing like Eve did accepting the intellectual side and know nothing of the spirit of God that's the message right now blind people have nice specials nice songs and everything else but blind why accepting the intellectual side and know nothing of the spirit of God therefore or won't they all fall in a ditch both the leader and the blind the leader will fall with the blind cuz he's blind too the leader fall that's blind leading the blind they both fall in a ditch then he continues God Alone hold this key he expressed the same thing in the previous scripture and so on like that therefore there is no school no theologians no teachings of the Bible among any school that knows anything about it they cannot know nothing about it it's impossible for them to know anything about it God has hid the senses of knowing it from the very elected teachers so in other words this book cannot be intellectually accessed this have to be accessed by spirit so a man could say the say the same quote read the same quote and he is talking from intellectually another man reading the same quote and he's accessing it by the spirit it is not the same one could go to the books and one could go to the angel oh give the Lord a shout Oh Glory to God Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the book is there the tapes are there the text is there the scriptures are there but God told John go to the angel and say give me the book when you get the book from the angel oh give the Lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah glory to God the bookall hlj [Music] they cannot know it God has hid the senses of knowing it from the very elected teachers and everything else it's a personal affair with the person that Christ is revealed to them and if you say he's revealed to me and then the life that Christ produced in the Bible that same life is in him does not produce life in you then you get your own Revelation so the Revelation is not just text and talk the Revelation is the life being revealed because remember the church is himself revealed and if you are part of that church you will also reveal Christ because Paul was saying what I'm preaching is to produce Christ in you the hope of glory so what you'll be revealing or what you'll be projecting is Christ in you the hope of glory that mean you have to be disappearing hallah and Christ will be coming forward come on I want to hear say Amen that means they going to be you must decrease come on preach back to me somebody preach back to me somebody you must decrease your flesh man your human Spirit your self must decrease and he must increase and he increasing will be showing the pinenes oh give the Lord a shout glory to God and through you his presence will be projected His Image will be reflected oh help me preach somebody tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God so he said now watch he said if you say he has been revealed to me and then the life that Christ produced in the Bible that same life is in him does not produce itself in you then you got the wrong revelation the life of if the life of Jesus Christ ever puts forth another body of believers they will have books and they'll argue with other churches no have if the Life of Christ ever put out another but Bel body of Believers it will bear the fruit that the first one did they will write a book of Acts behind it not write new textbooks on the message not write new explanation books in the message or new Mysteries being revealed in the message they will write another book of Acts because it will be the same life you can't get away from it it's the Life of Christ in you being injected In You by the Holy Spirit itself living it life through you in other words you're getting inoculated from the virus of the world and when you get it injected inside of you it gets projected out of you oh glory to God there's another life coming inside of it that life going to give a repellent Hallelujah it will give opposition to the things of the world give the Lord a shout blind leaders of the blind notice god holds this key no Theologian can tell you it is not known they it from there if no Theologian can tell you how come a minister could boast I reveal her to you he's a revealer I thought the Holy Ghost alone is the revealer of the revelation of Jesus Christ so tonight tonight I can't reveal nothing to you I preach in the word but the Holy Ghost you in the spirit Holy Ghost could take that up and give you a revelation then you jump out of your seat you run downstairs and come back up because Revelation doesn't be highest stiff Revelation not water Revelation not information Revelation is wine and when you get wine it has make your behave a certain way your lips sayy glory to God it make you move wi this get you Active water you're struggling with the water that what kind of colored water this water that kind of water to help you drink the water it's all water you're talking about but why something different why have something ferment inside of there it has Bubble Up Inside of there that's why say cannot take new wine and put it in Old bottles you have to have some oil in your lamp you have to have some oil in your bottle and when that wine hit you so you can expand you can't set up stiff with wine you can't just walk stiff with wine wine is loosen you wine is loosen your mouth Hallelujah land your eyes be little glassy glassy glassy oh give the Lord I sh Give the Lord I shout you can't even walk straight hallelujah hallelujah to watch how you're walking they were like drunk men in the upper room because the stimulation of the revelation of the love of God was striking them Hallelujah we not crazy tonight you know we love Jesus we preaching about Jesus we preaching about God's love we preaching about him having the in all things not in some things in all things every area of your life oh all what you do to him to have the preeminence is oh let's [Music] go hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah so a man who say can give you Revelation he's a liar who tell who says so but you say so don't be afid to tell my pastor say you a liar amen let's go God is known by Simplicity and of revelation of Jesus Christ to the most illiterate person a person who don't know how to handle WhatsApp or go on Facebook a person who can read or write that person could be full of Revelation don't say Amen now that we just read God lie God is no my licity and of revelation of Jesus Christ to the most illiterate person not your theology it's the revelation of Jesus Christ Upon This Rock I'll build my church no other rocks accepted no other things accepted no other Roman Rock no other Protestant Rock no other school no nothing but exactly on the revelation of Jesus Christ through the new birth he borns in there and he injects his own life and your life is gone Shout gone that's your life we talking about gone where he gone he gone Hallelujah and the life of Christ is projecting itself through you oh glory to God what is that the preeminence is projecting it through you not more of you less of you something bigger than you something more than you projecting itself to the people oh give the Lord a praise that is God's intent that is God's purpose that is God's objective for his church could we give the Lord a shout in the [Applause] house you know the teacher that's position place you like the teacher kneel inside the seat people can say Amen they kneel your position place to be dead they're waiting for La Rose they waiting for for bel's funeral home or Simpsons funeral home that's not the objective the placing is to get you to understand where you're going the placing is for understand what you're called onto you're not called onto wrath you're called on to honor and Glory you're called to be a vessel of Honor if you prepared to purge yourself yeah born vessel of Honor you're born a Scamp a rogue a thief a cook you're born in sin to begin with filthy to begin with no good there was n righteous no not one that's all of us preacher believer all of us in that bucket non righteous no

your trouble above your depression above your frustration he's above all of that oh give the Lord a shout we have a champion in the house Oh Glory to God his name is [Music] Jesus so let's go over that again Hallelujah he borns in there he injects his own life your life is gone and the life of Christ is projecting itself through you years ago I talked to brother soon I talked about it wasn't even five minutes was three minutes maybe two minutes he talking about his Pastor is the man of the hour it was so fast said say you know in five minutes you can tell somebody is that the Holy Ghost this man have a different ghost that's not the Holy One that's a different ghost his Pastor is an idol and he worshiping him so as soon as you meet me a minister and you know I'm a pastor Minister he telling me what the glory of his Pastor as I supposed to Bow like because his Pastor have all the glory all the honor foolishness intellectual idiot fools but you see that's the training they get this is it we are it we have it they have the prominences God have to PR again you know I'll tell you about a man I think I read it one time this is 3 John 9 you know John have one third book of John only have one one chapter in it verse 9 says Paul I wrote unto the church about Dees as a brother who love it to have preeminence among them receive us not the amplifier of that says I have written briefly to the church but Dees who likes to take the lead among them and put himself first does not acknowledge my authority and refuses to accept my suggestions or listen to me that is Pope Dees we have them Min message so we have brother Dees plurals in Trinidad and around the world they like the pre evidences they like to be on stage they like the mic yes hallu you want to be in charge and they have a big fight when people don't bow like modai so let's leave Dees and his drama alone so watch he borns in there he injects his own life and your life is gone and the life of Christ is projecting itself through you with the the people that they see the very life and works and signs and wonders that he did is doing the same thing through you you want to know the BM after that outside of that the rest of it is not even called to at all did you hear that brother George you hear that after that he said he said outside of that the rest of it is not even called to at all listen to this bum by lack of this Revelation is why we have so many different divisions Among Us so Revelations don't cause divisions is the lack of it the lack that God is Sovereign and he can reveal himself to whomsoever he will somebody back sitting a 100 years and God come down and reveal himself to them you can't stop that because you suffering oh give the Lord a shout hallelujah by lack of this Revelation is why we have so many different division among us so much mockery so much division Among Us is because the people lack that Revelation they lack that Revelation the teachers the teachers or the pastors or the well-known elected ministers they lack Revelation that is why you have div Vision they're not seeing the kingdom they seeing their group their Church they the bride and everybody else fals and their own and whatnot amen when God told the prophet pick a pen and WR he said many true ministers not false many true ministers will misunder understand that Prophet I can't said this one false and that's one false and that's one false some could be very true but they under misunderstand and with when you misunderstand you miss the boat you know you not just misunderstand it you know you miss it clean you know God has send no message of perfectionist last day for us to be right in spirit and wrong in Doctrine no we had the right in spirit and right in Doctrine too God has sent no message for us to be false in Doctrine and right in spirit we have a humble Spirit we nice and so on and you're off the word that's not it at all you know because the spirit is the spirit of Truth Give the Lord a shout in the house do you get it now the spirit is not just spirit it's the Spirit of Truth so the spirit of truth will only lead you to truth the spirit of Truth wouldn't give you a lie because it's the spirit of Truth itself and Truth is a person truth is Jesus Christ I am the way I am the truth I am the life oh give the Lord I shout in the house glory to God so truth is not just text truth is a person and Truth have a spirit behind it and just as you have the spirit of truth but I can't it have the spirit of error oh give the Lord a shout so somebody can ministering under the spirit of error speaking lies speaking false doctrine that the Bible talk about they will have itch in ears and turn from truth to fables my the Greek came and act says we would see Jesus but Bram now we find ourselves a finite we can make many mistakes I make more than all because we are finite but he is in F night he cannot make a mistake now I can promise you something and with the very best of my ability I can say I really mean that and then might not be able to fulfill what I promised because circumstances would alter cases but not so with God he cannot make a promise that he cannot fulfill Moses taught the same thing Abraham rather but he tackled on the promise of God through unbelief but was giv God praise to God for he was fully persuaded that what God had promised he was able to perform therefore all the scriptures that God has given to us our promises now we get ourselves worked up here we go in the human element of the time element the only thing we know is inches feets yards miles measurements days weeks hours months years but God is eternal we have limited powers limited intelligence but God is infinite in all things he knows all things he knew all things before the world began he knew this meeting would be here tonight he known all things before there was a world because he could could tell what would be the end time from the beginning and that makes him God sir nothing else no one else no other being no other person could ever do that but God Alone Now we sometime wonder why he's so great and why we don't see him more than we we do now through the blood here we go he sanctify a church that he might continue his work so when God came to pay this price he had an objective that true the blood now cuz we ourselves we can't do anything we finish but through the blood out out blood this is Jesus blood now he can sanctify a church that he might continue the work himself living in that church because God have certain laws and principles certain things Angels cannot do man have to do God have to use man to do a angel can't be a prophet a angel is a servant we are Sons oh give the Lord some Praises so God has to use the human element of the 16 element he had to pick up some flesh to step into it that he could communicate and speak to us and share himself with us oh give the Lord a shout in the house he sanctify a church that he might continue to work his work himself living in that church we are absolutely Unworthy of any blessing right right right right with me tonight Prophet is preaching tonight we are absolutely Unworthy of any blessing there is nothing that we could do to Merit it but by unmerited Grace God give us this privilege to be called his children his sons and his daughters sanctifying us as we confess our sins you have to confess your sins you have to repent and as you repent and you confess your sins he come sanctifying sanctify them through Thy word Thy word is truth oh give the Lord I shout every day you have to confess every day you have to repent every single day oh glory to God you put it all on the altar of God and let the blood deal with that Hallelujah s def find the world from us that he might work his way through Us by the Holy Spirit and do his work oh my oh my oh my brother Bram then God can manifest it in one man Jesus now we manifesting it in the entire church Universal everywhere God can work through every man and every woman that will open up their heart and let the Lord Jesus come in and work his will through them that's right but say thank you Lord God could work through every man and every woman that will open their heart and let the Lord Jesus come in and work his will through them I don't care if you don't even know your ABCs just the only thing you have to have is a humble submitted heart to God and God will work his will through you question do you believe that tonight do you believe that's the the you he talking about is you that not 100% some of your mouth still closed do you believe that this you he's talking about working through you is you he's talking about that's good that's good that's good let's [Music] continue Jesus he said no man eat it from thee and the tree withered away and brother brandham say as a man takeen his heart so is he he said now what he said wait a minute you say Have Faith In God I'm skipping now now you can express it by mental conception but if it becomes a real revelation of God you see it before it happened so so so so Abraham's revelation of Isaac wasn't just a thought in his mind he actually had Isaac he saw Isaac Isaac was the substance of his Fai you know he couldn't show his own wife it you know because it was a revelation from God hallelujah so he knew Isaac coming he is not going to produce it he is not going to get it out Sarah is through Sarah that life going to come but he had a revelation of it he knew it by Revelation Revelation is something that you just know you sense you see when Moses hide and say God help me help me and God rebuke him and say why cry speak of me forward then Moses raised up his hand mes fully know going stand still and see the salvation of God he's staring now because he catch back out of the human he he jump back out of his humanistic realm into the realm of faith into the arms of God where all things are possible where God could lead and God could die stretch forth thy rut Hallelujah when you open up rest he open up that never happened before Moses say God give me a give me a preview you see a preview of what coming give me a preview also you the holy St so hold it so hold it so there are things God will do with you that he never did with anybody else so you can't look for a preview because God dealing with you customize your experience for you Hallelujah so you say when you you can express in my mental conception but if it becomes a real revelation of God that you see it before it happen and express it in word form that word takes a hold and becomes material a thought Express if your heart and your mind is so infilled with God's spirit so he's prophesying here he's saying how it's going to be he's saying God's intent if your mind and heart is so infilled with God's spirit until your thoughts become his thoughts there you are when your mind and your leading and your guiding becomes a direct place or a direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit moving in your mortal being what kind of people should we be if the very Holy Spirit has you so embodied or empowered that you don't use your own thoughts you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinion but the Holy Spirit has you so built until your thoughts and your being is God's spirit expressing itself through you am what kind of church would we be what kind of people would we be this morning if this brandom Tabernacle this morning was so filled with the presence of God why when you didn't even use your own mind you didn't use your own thoughts you didn't even have no alternative of your own but just to be led by your spirit and this here is where he dropped this bomb then when the human element goes out am I told the ministers in the Min Association already I said how could you get to the Holy Ghost when you haven't even got to the Trad Spirit a bun of people sitting down in the church with a triny spirit pure Trinidadian and they know word they know mystery they have understanding and they have knowledge but their Spirit have never been busted over them amen that why they fight and like you're American and you're American satellite and like you're foreign and we don't want no foreign thing and and and this local what you local flesh to prot to perfect local bride so that means somebody with a foreign flesh C come and Perfect Bride since when flesh perfecting right that is just Insanity that's just Madness but that's the kind of mental thing it had in the ear so in other words you have to go past so Germans have their Spirit ger St and what ger had to break out of that to get into the Holy Ghost French French France had a spirit America have the spirit English had a stiff stiff Spirit God to bust that out to get to the Holy Ghost but now he's talking beyond that now the human element when the human element goes out and the spirit of God fills that vacancy is this getting anywhere tonight the spirit of God F of Vy where you empty yourself this church fighting we fighting back and what and who saying who saying what to do with this these IND ual mins love the church F people get woke up fight fight f p better bu that in Italian restaurant a pastor stand by that fight up with that when the human element goes out and the spirit of God fills that vacancy sir where you oh boy help me tonight I could see how people will be judged I could see how people going to be judged in Trinidad and around the world when the Holy Spirit begin to play Sons and have the [Music] could see it and that's why I fought for two things main things brotherly kindness and respects is that right brother kangi K talking that brotherly kindness and respect got TR Trinity tongues loose and they're disrespectful oh my oh my oh my hallelujah hallelujah the figure they could say anything and say anything about anybody and pastors encouraging that foolishness because they seeing anything not they same thing side too to the elders and deons and the people everybody know they everybody know they talk I was telling my wife I said I so glad I protect my sons from crap and the church from a set of nonsense I don't talk them talk free you from that all we could focus on is what God promised I am pleased all these years not to be in this church foolishness and who's saying what and doing what have nothing to do that out here this is just the Word of Promise sermon to you is either you take it or you leave it but this is what we preaching this is what we standing for this is what I want to see manifest I have nobody to fight this had to come through me this have to be expressed through me Hallelujah he said by and through the bride will be expressed all what was promised will be fulfilled by and through that bride oh the Lord I shout not no church thing is a God thing it's a individual thing God was in Christ reconciling the world himself oh give the Lord a shout Cornelius didn't send for the whole church oh give the Lord a shout Cornelius sent for Peter because the angel tell him send for Peter oh give the Lord a shout and Peter had the Holy Ghost Peter had the full germ Peter had the whole pyramid inside of him from Faith to charity he was a living moving Monument he was a redeemer by himself oh he was sent Oh Glory to God to pick up Cornelius Oh Glory to God how is it that the Holy Ghost could fall among them non tunders Brethren oh Hallelujah who tell you to go there God tell me to go there oh give the Lord a praise in the house give the Lord a shout in the house house I will go wherever God tell me to go well if so and so he wasn't going to go there that's them that's not me as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God give the Lord a shout Oh Glory to God hallelujah but Kang they come and try to lock Peter neck the church folks you go there where you doing there we don't go now normally go there Peter wait wait wait wait wait let let me let me go over this Peter went over the whole story with them when they finish they shut them out BR said we going to shut them out of the critics we rag jaming time take the rag and jam it in the M let them back let them laugh let them talk rag jaming time coming oh give the Lord a shout they going to rag they're going to shut them out oh give the Lord a shout it will speak for itself you wouldn't have to say one word about it God will let it be made known among men because you will be true you the Prem will be expressed his presence will be revealed his presence will be unfolded and they will know it is God oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah let me see if I can finish [Music] here I just love this when the human element goes out and the spirit of God fills that vacancy where you empty yourself then will be when the church is in its power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Will walks in his steps in his power in his thoughts in his being in his moving see what I mean then your thoughts will become words and words will become material and then that is when the church will be in its power then he prophesied I believe it's on this road when the church will be so wrapped in Christ not in argument not in debate not in I right you wrong and you right and I wrong no not that when the church will be so wrapped in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind so away from theirselves they don't see themselves they have they no thoughts but to serve God their thoughts move on they refuse the things of the world they just move in the spirit live in the spirit move in the spirit walk in the spirit to fulfill the love of Christ then the love of Christ in the human heart moving in the Holy Ghost that great wonderful church will go forth with power and deity because deity will be revealed in human beings by the Holy Spirit bringing to pass the thought of their [Music] mindu Hallelujah that not a know that not a good text and a message you know this is for Real GL he said compassion is doing the will of God we mix it all today we put the human element to it like in love we try to use love God's love like we do human love you cannot fall in love with God like you do your wife you cannot fall in love with God like it do your husband or your girlfriend or boyfriend it's two different loves one is the Greek word are different one of them is called filio that's the love you have for your wife that kind of love would make you kill a man over jealousy but agapo love which is Godly love instead of killing a man you'll pray for his sinful soul and we get the human element mixed up with the Christian Godly element are you ready with me tonight then we just got a big mess out of it because we only know inches feets miles so forth ounces and pounds and so forth that's what we know we are time people God is eternal he has no inches no miles no yesterday no tomorrow it's eternity with him and we to bring God's infinite mind down to our little finite mind we just get mixed up so the best thing in doing it is reading his word remember in his word will not contradict itself wow we going real good but brandham if you notice it is always those who trying to get away from it that God uses as long as a man wants to do something and thinks he's got enough ability he can't put over a job over God can never use that man look at Moses running Paul running all the rest of them running I said don't seek nothing if God got anything for you he'll give it to you instead of trying to be great what punch they they should the great ones George instead of trying to be great we ought to be trying to find how little we can get that should be a goal then that should be our ambition how small I could get boy then God can use us notice the weakest and the rejected and practically every hero God ever had on the front line was that type of person a person that was rejected a person that thought he was insufficient a person that had no ability at all then that's a person just in good shape so God can start using them when they feel like they can't they haven't got nothing that's when God can take a hold of them and do something with them but when we are thinking we are able to do it God can't use us because because we are wanting to do it ourselves now the other side we get these feelings and we think that we're insufficient and we don't want to do it but if we listen to the call of God that's the very thing God want to you get us into the kind of shape so he can oh here we go when we are insufficient ourselves here we go then we are subject to yield to God's spirit so that's why the Arrogant proud boastful character they yielding to no Spirit they yielding to their brains the head the G matter that's what heing too you could see it you could pick it up they walk with pride they walk with arrogance they walk with KN it all and everything else there's no yielding there because they study so much them spoken with books and their Bible and books and thing that they they have a frow they head high when we are insufficient ourselves then we are subject to yield to God's spirit as long as we think we can do it then we can't do it but when we get to a place I'm almost done where we are trying to do it we'll fail but if we'll yield ourselves to God then God can fail there's only one thing God cannot do and that is fail so as long as we are trying in ourselves and dependent upon our own abilities we'll do nothing here we go the most the important thing one of the important things that we must master master remember this especially young preachers lay members alike there's one thing we have got to master if we expect to fulfill God's desire in our Liv life is we have to master the thought of human ability if we get to a spot where we think we can do it with our intelligence our abilities we have got to master in such a way that we can get rid of the thing and later sight so that God can use us and make a complete surrender we cannot use one ability we have got to make a surrender to come to God you've got to surrender to him soul body Spirit everything that you has has to be surrender to God in order that he can work his will in you and in me I telling the choir people who sing and sing I don't want your voice I want you to own the song So when you sing the song the song is yours then you become the song you sing it and it becomes your song and you sing it from your heart if you just sing it because you have a nice voice it's just the voice going it has no effect but when you take the song and make it your song this is my story this is my song it must be yours amen Hallelujah and when it becomes yours the anointing is with you oh glory to God give the Lord some Praises same thing with preaching when it's revealed to me or I get it by inspiration it's m so when I come here I have the anointing for it because of how I got it if I say it back because somebody say it and I say it I say let because they say it too and it's s good it's the right thing to say but it's not mine but when I get it by inspiration I own it it is M because you reveal it and have the authority to speak it oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah so everything that you have has to s be surrendered to God in order that he can work his will in you and me now that's hard I know because we always wanted to put our part in something that we know you know we want to do it and so on I know it should be done this way as long as you're doing it that way it's going to be wrong God will never use that effort maybe with the help of the Lord we're going to get into a few minutes and so like that he said that's oh skip down now when we are expecting saying this guy he's a great person there's a great person I lean on him that displeases God ministers will preach that because they want to be the great one mighty one you had to hold your briefcase for them and open the door for them and so on right right this is a great person lean on him that displeases God when you do that we must lean upon God and God Alone we mustn't trust the ability of ourselves or any man or any what any man we must completely yield to God no ability I don't care what it is will never be usable in the sight of God God had to get all of our abilities out of us before he can achieve his purpose if he's got something for us to do as long as we feel that we're doing a pretty good job out of it he never able use of God now you say you're making an awful broad statement in brother Bram that's a broad one but just look around and find out whether it's right or not look around today and our achievement look at the churches and the nominations worse than ever was in the beginning and it's true right now it is worse off today it ever was I've been this message 975 and right now it's the very worst that people wouldn't talk to you people want way on their own worse and they actually think that they're bride yes I find it so mental they supposed to know it's tribulation material they part of because that cannot be the bride the bride car be in hatred the bride car be in jealousy the the bride can be insecure who you call insecure bride you're still marrying me you still marrying me when bam dramatized about that bride when the man promised to marry her and she washing dishes in the back she believe it you know she received it you know she start to prepare you know they laugh at her preparing you know because he said coming back same time next year he didn't tell nobody else that she alone had that Revelation and she was preparing and the dress and the thing and that day come she preparing herself oh no they laughing they take put it on Facebook everything else but the man did come oh give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah so we have to forget our own ability we need a place of yielding to the spirit instead of so much depend upon schooling and programs history proves that God always chooses the nobodies to become a somebodies God takes that person to be nothing mus come up please but talk about Moses he's talking about Moses 5 minutes in the presence of the burning bush he he learned more than 40 years in Egypt 5 minutes encounter 40 years with books and tapes in the message and 5 minutes encounter change you change you change Ministry everything else here brother Abraham when Moses get that experience I'm going to Egypt to take over a one-man Invasion going against the greater in number than all the world chariots Horsemen spearmen Bowman of Egypt one little old wrinkle up 80-year old man with a stick in his hand and the white whiskers blowing going down to Egypt to take over and the thing of it was he did it hear this is the closing part he did it because he had been alone with God when have you heard that phrase alone with God there is where the church needs tonight is not some fantastic not some new denomination but to be alone with God all selfishness all malice all fear all unbelief just Fades away and God becomes preeminent there it is that is what will make a person different that is what made Moses different that is what will make you different I you prepare to go alone with God am you begin to play something Sly but is talking about the Masterpiece The Perfect Image the God man God and morphe had changed from the supernatural to the vision here we go and the vision was projected into an image and the image was smitten so the supernatural could taste the feeling of debt God's perfect Masterpiece he could not do it in Moses he he could not do it in the prophets Isaiah who was sord with SED he was s to Pieces he couldn't do it in the prophets that were stoned he could not do it because he couldn't feel it they were just a portion of him but in this perfect Masterpiece he was the fullness of the godhead body he not only project Moses he could project his entire being into this person and taste debt for the whole human race God's perfect Masterpiece so inspired by seeing it all promises was met in him he was the Perfection of the Perfection our kinsman redeemer in root and Boaz our Lord Giver from M SI our prophet in the wilderness he come from the mountain he come from the Wilderness he come from eternity and become man the perfect enage God down to the ages has been heu away by Patriarchs brought them through different things that he would lay his foundation upon and now here we go in order for this to speak he's the word and for the word to speak he must come into an image amen and then that image to speak it must be smitten yes sir he must come into an image in order to speak so what are you saying about over it this statue of perfect man is God's image it's God's likeness through this is seven steps that through these seven steps he
