christ with thanksgiving amen lord and amen praise god praise god amen so god bless you one more time amen in the name of jesus god bless you brother pastor and all of you here tonight we welcome you in a special way let's just turn to our bibles to second timothy chapter two if you have your bible tonight ii timothy chapter two verses 20 and 21. praise the name of the lord glory to god amen hallelujah amen so it goes like this but in a great house they are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of earth some to honor and some to dishonor if a man therefore purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor sanctified and meet for the master's use and prepared unto every good work praising of the lord blessed be the name of the lord amen so tonight the thought for this bible study is vessels of honor vessels are on let's look at the word vessel there are many different examples of how vessels can be used so a vessel for example can be a bull or a mug to hold water or food items or anything you may want to store you may have a blood vessel for example veins that are trees to transport blood throughout the body my sister benedict she's smiling there we may have a vessel could be a boat or ship to transport passengers or cargo from one place to another or it can be a person whom god calls and uses to do a job so what we observe in all these different examples of how the word vessel is used in each case we see the vessel is tied to our purpose somebody say purpose purpose in other words the vessel is used to achieve to achieve an objective so it has a specific use one hardly designs and makes and crafts any item without having a vision or specific plan or use in mind for the thing for example a pen is made to write with it has ink it is slender for the user to hold it a car is made to drive on the road it has tires there are seats for the passengers to sit on a house is made to live in different rooms and facilities for the inhabitants to occupy and anything you can think of that was carefully made is tied to a pulpers is tied to a vision of the manufacturer so again any vessel has a use it has a purpose for which it was created praise god a vessel must also have the ability to accommodate or hold or carry what it was made to contain it must be receptive amen okay so now what is honor honor means given high respect to great esteem admiration it also means uprightness and righteousness so when we say lord we give you all the honor we are saying lord we lift you high high above all others we are giving a special salute we are given great recognition and high adoration so putting the phrase together a vessel of honor what does it mean question in second timothy 2 we read in a great house there are vessels of gold and silver wood and clay but over in second chronicles chapter 9 verse 20. you don't have to find it all the drinking vessels of king solomon were of gold so there are special vessels in a great house some esteem more highly than the others the golden vessels were only used for the king's drinking purposes but there were vessels some of wood some of clay note note there were vessels of honor and there were some vessels of this honor praise god so depending on the purpose for which it was created there is where the value lay and each vessel was made to achieve a specific purpose praise god but for this study tonight we will focus on the human vessels vessels that are created by god himself to achieve a desired purpose praise god amen so that was just an introduction and say praise the name of the lord so vessels of honor let's go so as a vessel of god we want to know lord what is it that you will have me to do what is your purpose for my life my analyze in fulfilling the purpose you have intended for me i want to do your will can we say amen tonight i want to do your will today amen i want to please you in every way help me to find my purpose and be the best that i can be there one time the prophet said if you are a bomb be the best bomb you can be dig in every dustbin look as dirty as you can be as smelly as you can be but just be the best bob can we say amen glory to god amen he said if you are a dormat in the house of god be the best donut be fluffy and comfortable and well padded so that when people wipe their feet they would feel good amen can we say amen praise the lord have you ever gone to pay a utility bill at an office and the customer rep is so unmanly and hostile that you feel to just still not walk out the building it's like but you are saving customers you are the feast to represent all that the company stands for and that is your best representation you are certainly a misfit you are in the wrong job maybe you need to go and grind iron or something the mean face might be appreciated there but the thing is are you achieving the purpose for which you were specially designed and created and one songwriter says you are a designer's original hallelujah so to speak amen you are unique you are a unique and special vessel unique special amen so god does not make halfway christians but a christian can be halfway and you don't want to be a halfway christian we've come too far just to be a halfway christian can we say amen today we don't want to be a happy christian so what is a vessel of honor a minister that is sanctified consecrated and set apart for that holy office now in the old testament brother isaac this was just for the priests but in the new testament when jesus ran the veil in two we all became royal priests so now who are the vessels of honor question and in second timothy 2 again verse 21 if a man purges himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor so three things one sanctified consecrated and set apart two fit or meet for the master's use and three prepare to do every good work so these are the requirements for a vessel of honor from the message earnestly contending for the faith sanctification note cleansed and set aside for service is not being in service let me say that again if you are cleansed and set aside for service that is not being in service that's just being sanctified he says blessed are they that hunger and this after righteousness for thee shall be filled glory the holy ghost comes in and fills up that vessel till it's running over till it's bubbling over and then you are in service of the lord can we say amen tonight glory to god thank you jesus so we get cleaned up or sanctified then we seek the holy ghost once we are filled now you are a christian as it will the journey has only just begun don't say you're ready to go after you get the holy ghost so don't say you're ready to go after you get the holy ghost then you make yourself into a christian it's praise god then you start to add and add and add and eat and grow and die and add then the more you dive the more you can add less of you and more of him fighting your way to perfection like the little lily at the bottom of the pond pushing up to get to the top all the way to perfection can we say amen praise god from the message the seal of god he says a vessel must first be broken up sorry must first be taken up full of mud so it's justified the man has picked it up the next thing is got to be cleansed and scored out sanctified cleansed and set aside for service set us again he says set aside does not mean you are in service the holy ghost comes in the sanctified real true sanctified believer as soon as the sanctified believer gets right the holy ghost got into it praise god praise god notice you can't bring oil out of a bottle unless there is oil in there no matter how clean the bottle is amen praise god so don't expect god to put that power in an unclean vessel and he's talking about the disciples he had to clean them up and give them a life of sincerity before he let them go out to preach praise god so once again the vessel is cleansed cleaned up it is ready to go in service to be used one songwriter says if you can use anything lord you can use me he is looking for vessels that are willing and able to be used praise god i'm born into the kingdom i'm booted in at the bottom of the pyramid and i'm growing closer daily climbing up the steps but yet yet there are things in me that need to be thrown out a death is required and paul said i die daily a total death to self is required we say i have the holy ghost but does the holy ghost have you that's jim is every emotion and that whole self in total subjection to the holy spirit you look fine you're a very nice person you treat everyone nice your earthen vessel is all polished up but god your maker your manufacturer demands more are you pleasing the designer are you pleasing the manufacturer you are good but a manufacturer wants perfection you are given 50. 75 but can you give more what do i do and where can i go question where can we go tonight let's go down to the potter's house praise god let's go down to the potter's house glory to god and we go across you can write this one down jeremiah 18. this versus one to six remember preached a message on the potter's house some years ago jeremiah chapter 18 verses one to six the word which came to jeremiah saying arise and go down to the potter's house and there i will cause thee to hear my words then i jeremiah went down to the potter's house and behold he wrought a work on the wheels a potter is someone who makes pots out of clay verse 4 and the vessel talking about vessels of honor tonight and the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter so he made it again another vessel a seemed good to the potter to make and was for any amplified but a vessel that he was making from clay was spoiled in the potter's hand so he made it over reworking it making it into another pot that seemed good to him verse 5 then the word of the lord came to me saying o house of israel cannot i do with you as this potter saith the lord behold as the clay is in the potter's hand so are ye in my hand oh house of israel praise the name of the lord we stop right there and i decided to look up for the research on the process of making pottery and i found a simple one and the first step involves one sourcing the clay sourcing the clay you need to get the right mixture of clay to give the work character and texture and consistency so you must have the right type of clay two then you prepare the clay you mix and roll the clay to make it consistent and air bubble free you have to knead the clay with a slight rotation because this helps to push out any air bubbles within the clay air bubbles will cause issues when throwing the clay on the potter's wheel and if they remain in the clay during firing they can cause the clay body to break or even explode next step putting the clear on the wheel you want to form well formed vessels where the walls have an even thickness clay is attached to the wheel head and is shaped with the potter's hands or tools as it spins around after the pot is formed it is usually cut off the wheel to dry i mean uber and twine knows a lot about making pots and man god bless you rather than trying so on the potter's wheel is where you are shaped somebody says shape tonight shapes even on the potter's wheel so when you think of the potter's wheel you're thinking about the place where you are shaped praise god another step they call it bisque firing the pots are fired to make them more suitable for glazing and surface decorations then there's glazing a mixture of materials that when fired will melt and fuse into the clay usually creating a glassy surface it adds color and texture and functionality that's glazing then you have other decorations like putting images screen plate printing brush work carvings and so on can be done on the vessel finally firing the pot vessels are placed and maintained at high temperatures which can change clay and glaze into a permanent object amen so that kind of summarizes the stages in pottery making to some extent a very simple illusion but this scripture of jeremiah 18 1-6 it shows how sometimes god uses things physical real situations and visible objects to convey a clear understanding of his mind and will for us amen and in the new testament he uses parables and stories to enlighten our understanding and to make us as christians see clearly how he feels and thinks he uses vessels of clay in the potter's hands he compares the potter to god and the clay vessel as human vessels so that's austenite it shows how the potter has power over the clay to mold it however he chooses to and this implies that god can do whatsoever he wants with us and will do whatsoever he wants to bring us to a place that he wants us to be can somebody say amen tonight hallelujah praise god a place of perfection a vessel of honor that he can use so god and god wanted to talk to jeremiah get up jeremiah arise i have a message to give you but i want you to see something first you must go down to the potter's house and there i will cause thee to understand fully then jerry buyer arose and went down to the potter's house and when he went there the potter was at the wheel shaping a vessel with his hands spinning the wheel and shaping the pot but then the potter was not pleased because the clear pot did not get the sheep he was trying to make the bible says it was marred in his hand in other words there was a flaw there was a fault in it it did not please the potter so as the amplified said the potter made it over reworking it and making it into another pot that pleased him or that seemed good to him can we give god a hand to praise tonight thank you jesus hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god and right here is where we are at some of us on the potter's wheel being remolded being broken being remade being crushed because the potter god is only pleased with a perfect vessel a vessel of honor that is meet or fit for the master's use praise god if you are sanctified set aside that's good that's a requirement but now we must be fit for the master's use not how you like it or what looks good to you but what he demands of you which is a work of perfection amen praise god glory so from a message why are we not a denomination prophet says can the pot say to the potter you made me this you made me this who is on the wheel in other words who is in charge who has got the clay in his hands whose hands is it in hallelujah so we can't tell god how to shape us because we are in his hands we as clay must know how to yield ourselves to the touch of the potter's hand can we say amen tonight hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise god look at how the prophet says from the message witness he said the prophet jeremiah was going down to the potter's house to be broken up to be made over again the prophet himself jeremiah he says if there is no breaking up there is no making over can we say amen to that you have to be first broken up you have to break up your ground first tear it all to pieces then you can plant your seed and it will come forth let me see amen from the message why is it that so many christians find it so hard to live the christian life that's the name of the message he says thou art the potter i am the clay mold me and make me tonight this is this is the prophet not after some church creed but after thy will can we give him praise tonight just raise your hand wherever you are tonight oh praise god more last lord mold us lord we make us lord after i will tonight let seth be the name of the lord thank you jesus he said not after a church creed you don't want to be molded after church creed but after his will so not only did jeremiah get broken up himself because prophecy god took jeremiah down to be broken up but god gave the prophet a message to the people jeremiah chapter 18 verse 6 o house of israel can't i do with you as this potter said the lord behold as the clear is in the potter's hand so are you in my hand o house of israel see where we are located in the master's hand in the potter's hand being shaped be informed into a pyramid vessel as it were into a word image by the process of character formation seven deaths seven birds seven voices glory to god amen being turned and shaped and molded and cut into the stature of a perfect man hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen and that's where we want to be that's what we want that's our goal amen oh let us go down to the potter's house tonight i have a message for you there i will show you something i'm forming a vessel of honor a vessel that is sanctified consecrated and set apart a vessel that is fit on meat for my use a vessel that is prepared onto every good work hallelujah praise god so how does he shape us amen i'm not going to be very very long praise god how does he shape us tonight how i see the clay on the physical wheel spinning and being shaped by the potter's hands but how does he shape the human vessel what is the potter's will to shape the human vessel how will he break me and mold me how will i know when he is shaping me hallelujah on the message god call man i hope i'm not too short tonight i'm not too loud that's the way god takes his men and beat out all their fears all their intellectual and the great master potter puts them on the weave and begins to mold them over again oh glory to god hallelujah the prophet has answered the question here from god call man let me see that one more time so the question was what is the potter's wheel to shape the human vessel i see the physical wheel for the physical clay but what is the potter's will to shape the human vessel how will he break me and mold me how will i know when he's shaping me so he says from god call man that's the way god takes his men and beats out all their fears all the intellectual and the great master potter puts them on the wheel and begins to mold them over again the workman worthy it's god's man who could train a man better than god himself hallelujah praise god watch the way he trains them god himself is training his men amen hallelujah shaping them on the potter's wheel so god shapes us take note of this god shapes us and removes us by training us by experiences by trials oh glory to god give the lord a praise tonight hallelujah hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord o praise god david he made devil david to be a vessel of honor but david had to go through rugged training david went through rugged training in god's school david was going to be a vessel of honor that god was going to use mightily god had a specific job for that vessel but david had to be trained and shaped and molded come on now hallelujah hallelujah don't feel that one day you will just be turned into a vessel of honor you have to go through the process you have to sit on the potter's wheel and be turned and shaped by the potter's hand you are his vessel not your own you are his vessel not your own vessel it is just you and the potter at the wheel of glory to god nobody else it's just you and the potter at the wheel notice david was led beside the still waters in other words that means he was alone brother himself david was on the backside of the desert that means he was not contaminated by the things of this world still in training glory david had experiences with the bay the lion so he learned how to be fearless how to be courageous he is being prepared for his specific purpose as a vessel as a chosen vessel for a specific purpose and the prophet said he cannot use you if you are afraid to take his word and believe him god cannot use you if you're afraid to take his word and to believe every word hallelujah trade in us glory to god amen so god elected david that specific vessel for a specific purpose he was a chosen vessel praise the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory so tonight can we see our trials and tests as training in preparation for a greater purpose that the master potter has in his mind for us oh hallelujah hallelujah the trials paul said the trials or trials are more precious than gold tried in the fire can we change our mindset or the way that we look at our trials tonight one songwriter says lord i long to go higher with thee he said son you can't grow in this mountain so he picked out a valley for me and he leads me besides still waters somewhere in the valley below and he drove me aside to be tested and tried and there in the valley he restore it my soul hallelujah give the lord i had the praise tonight oh glory to god amen blessed be the name of the lord he restores our soul tonight oh praise god praise god praise god so is it that his child is his love for us training us shaping us glory so it's in the valleys where he trains us some i mean in other words in our low points then in our low areas it's in the valleys where he trains us on the backside of the desert moses in the wilderness rocks and deserts hard trials there he was cooled in character development preparing to be used as a vessel of honor for god and he had a specific job to do hallelujah hallelujah in the wilderness rocks and deserts falling down getting back up school in character development and the back side of the desert praise god amen he grew up as a nice prince of egypt but he had to get on that wheel to be remolded to be broken up to get all the intellectual from egypt out of him and become fit for the master's use a tool in god's hands oh glory to god a tool that will bring honor to god a vessel of honor is to be used by god for his glory and for his honor can we say amen tonight hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory glory to god thank you lord thank you jesus from the message to the exodus prophet remember the pot must be broken into sheaves little pieces to be remolded and ground again this may look like a terrible thing to destroy it but it has to be done in order to get the pot remade again or the verse or whatever you are making it must be done from the message who do you say this is o foolish man can they clay say to the potter why make us meet us doesn't he have power to make one vessel to honor and another to this honor the potter yes he does yes you can only be what god made you he is the potter and we are the clay oh glory to god another place he says god is his prayer god make me what i ought to be i am the clay and you are the pot of lord amen can we say amen tonight that's our attitude tonight that's our disposition so i want to stress tonight that god can do what whatsoever he wants he can show mercy on whomsoever he chooses he is the potter hallelujah he is the father amen and from the message half this time glory this spot on this this this master potter he also likes variety and god has to display all of his attributes glory so he has to make one vessel of this honor and the other one to honor yeah why to show up the vessel of other amen glory so he makes one vessel of this honor and the other to honor to show up the vessel of honor glory he is sovereign god is sovereign tonight he can do whatsoever he wants hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah nobody can tell him what to do hallelujah that's a direct code nobody can tell him what to do glory to god he likes variety don't tell him how to make it and why to make it and when to make it he likes variety he makes us different the stars are different the angels are different they have some cherubims there are some seraphims amen he makes mountains he makes valleys he made plains and deserts and seas he made black people he made white people he made yellow people he made red people and they are all his people and he loves them all right man give the lord a praise hallelujah glory glory thank you jesus continue from who do you say this is if he hadn't made night you would never appreciate the sunshine and if it was all sunshine you wouldn't know how to appreciate it see he said if there was no sickness you could never appreciate good health they are good people and they are evil people god made one to be dishonorable to show up the honorable one is just a law of contrast so god is the master and he can do whatsoever pleases him i'm just trying to underscore that tonight he is the potter tonight and we are just play in his hand you can't have a bogus dollar until there is first a real level there is no sin unless there was righteousness first there is no lie until there's truth first there are two systems one the right system which is god's word and two the perverted system which is denomination but god is the master and he uses the law of contrast he is suffering hallelujah give me a lot of hand to pray god is talking tonight i'll don't try to bind him don't try to fix him won't try to box him praise god hallelujah he's bigger than our mind he's bigger than this universe amen glory okay it's nine o'clock so to break it up close a bit i'm not available a powerful word i'll say that one more time we have vessels on the potter's will be in shape and prepared for a short quick quick work powerful a bride being prepared being shaped a chosen people chosen vessels hallelujah cutting out all the world cutting out cutting out all of self baking out all the greenness because part of the pottery making process is the firing bacon there's a bacon part of it burning also with the fire of god burning out with the hard trials burning out all the greediest if we don't come out right on the spot as we guess what he will crush us over and remake us until we come out right because he will only have perfection hallelujah glory amen so if we don't come out right he will crush us over and remake us until we come out right righteousness vessel of honor if it takes seven deaths he will do it glory glory glory and when we are fully prepared all baked out then we will stand as empty earthen vessels we tend to be refilled ready for the master's use ready for that powerful short quick powerful work praise god amen rory and you know i was thinking [Music] if it is that the only group that will make it on the other side it's not this church or that church or this group of people but the only group that will make it on the other side is a group of overcomers the prophet said and then god must give us trials and tests to overcome so what are you going to overcome if you say you are an overcomer god of necessity must give us trials and tests to overcome and to learn how to overcome ourselves i wonder if we could on the line in red if you're writing on the line overcome ourselves in red and circle it and highlight it and stick it up on the wall overcome ourselves that's a real important part of the process because once we can't overcome ourselves then we are as clear yielded in the master's hands hallelujah glory not my will lord but thine you are not fighting up anymore with what he wants do whatsoever pleases you i am just a lump of clay in your hands tonight hallelujah praise god praise god praise god make me a vessel of honor a vessel that you can use to bring honor to your name because the vessel only gets its honor from its purpose that is saving that's where the value lies solomon vessel the golden vessel was the one that the king drank from and those are the ones that were prestigious in the king's house in the great house because of the purpose it was fulfilling make me a vessel of honor a vessel that you can use to bring honor to your name fit for the master's purpose hallelujah glory to god that's in closing off now prophet has given up prayer there's a prayer here from the prophet from the message jehovah miracle jehovah america brother isaac jehovah he says that we could just raise our hands wherever we are tonight he says send us anywhere do anything with us you want to take us in your hand you are the potter and we are the clay mold us and make us after your own way make us images of god next place he continue praying make us thy servants we are the clear and you are the potter lord mold as each one in your own way that we might fit together with christ jesus as a member of his body hallelujah let's just close off in a word of prayers i said i said hand over over there thank you jesus amen blessed be the name of the lord heavenly father lord tonight we thank you for this bible study for this thought that you place on my heart for months now lord and i thank

the word we subjecting ourselves to his will and this purpose and it gives us written heart heart condition to do that this is what we want to know that we are willing that we could surrender to god amen this is what we want to be able to do surrender and yield to the lord so let's just raise our hand just without a minute father god we thank you and we praise you and bless you for your goodness

call to be under potter's wheel that is where he calls to places and father sometimes things happen and we can't explain it like the winds blowing contrary this happening and that happening but here we have a word from you the vessel was uh prepared and and the purpose was channeled and i saw love what was here tonight that is connected to our purpose our lives are connected to purpose and if we are not fulfilling that purpose then then then what is our vessel about what what are we here for so lord i thank you that the word is becoming clearer and clearer as to what you call us unto father vessels of honor and the vessels of honor can only be truly identified as honor when it is served in your purpose or we thank you for this end time because your prophet taught us that a lot of people millions and millions of people will be atomic father they'll be just material where the atomic bombs begin to fall that their bodies will be dissolved and destroyed atomic further but amidst all this darkness that cover in the earth and gross darkness covering the people you call out a people for your name seek my baptism not matter this not pentecostal not your witness but a people for your name say we believe that a bunch of these peoples got here tonight we believe you're calling us to accept this purpose of god jesus in the beginning of his ministry father he was healing the sick and the cast now devils and doing miracles and multiplying bread and fish and all of that was just a channel a road a pathway to his real purpose when he got down to garden of gethsemane when he began to pray if it's possible let this cup pass i guess and i believe that it was a group experience for him to graduate from the first stage when he said the spirit is upon me to hit to the garden of gethsemane when he knew it's all over no more signs no more wonders that he's gonna do no more breaking bread and fish and multiplying it it was the cross that was in front of him at some point in time lord after all the bubble dancing after all the rejoicing after all the jesus is so sweet after all of that we have to come down to our own garden of gethsemane where before us lays the cross and jesus himself didn't run into the cross he said father if it's possible let this compass and he's it's a reflection of all of us that when we come down to that hour we're going to ask if is there another way is there a different way for character formation is there a different way they're almost so much catch phrases of too blessed to be stressed and all kind of a cuckoo things that people have in their own mind and yet every prophet every siege every wise man every man of god that you have truly called there's only one process which is the potter's wheel where you take your break you reshape your mold you reset your repurpose father me each individual here tonight find the right spot that right fit someone was saying today that if you take a one-year-old child and give them a five-year-old shoes until i'm going around they may lose the shoes and maybe fall down because it's it's not a fit it has to fit just right and every vessel has to fit just right for the purpose it was created for each one of us are different called the different purpose and things but we want to yield ourselves to you father we want to be truly purged because that was the conditionality that was placed if a man push himself he shall be a vessel of honor you have left something for us to do to clean up to get it right to give up to let go to walk away from to cut off all these things are things that we can do and that is what the mechanics is all about to do all that we can do in the questions tonight have we done all that we can do for you to do the rest just like it said if we could only get started god will do the rest may this be a starting point tonight may this be an anchor point tonight would this be a moving uh a place that we could look back and say you know what i have accepted that i'm a vessel of god i am accepted that i'm called to be a temple of god and i want to be a vessel of honor not just a vessel because a vessel could be used for different purpose but i want to be a vessel of honor oh god may this word tonight become flesh may this word tonight coming real touch the families lord the husband the wives the mothers the fathers the brothers the sisters the sons and daughters touch the ministry father such the operation in the church that you might be glorified that you might be magnified we thank you for life we thank you for your love we thank you
