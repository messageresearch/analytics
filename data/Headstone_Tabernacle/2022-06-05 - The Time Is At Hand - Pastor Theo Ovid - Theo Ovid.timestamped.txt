[41:53] oh glory to god hallelujah
[41:56] hallelujah
[41:57] he said unto my say unto me these are
[42:00] the true sayings of god and i fell at
[42:02] his feet to worship him and he said unto
[42:04] me see thou do it is not i am thy fellow
[42:07] servant and i have thy virgin that have
[42:09] the testimony of jesus
[42:12] worship god
[42:13] for the testimony of jesus is the spirit
[42:16] of prophecy
[42:18] so when god sent a prophet
[42:21] to reveal seven seals
[42:23] open up the prophetic vision
[42:25] it was to release that spirit of
[42:27] prophecy that would give the bride the
[42:30] testimony of jesus
[42:32] oh glory to god so all these years we
[42:35] are walking around with the testimony of
[42:38] jesus
[42:39] which is the spirit of prophecy after
[42:42] taking the open book
[42:44] according to scripture to prophesy about
[42:47] the bride's revival to prophesy away to
[42:50] them seven thunders after their voices
[42:52] in that group
[42:53] they're gonna slice and cut like the
[42:55] talk that's a manifestation what we see
[42:58] should make a church that would make a
[43:01] seventh under revival that people will
[43:03] come to see what is being manifested not
[43:06] as what being taught not what being
[43:08] explained but what is being manifested i
[43:12] say that time is at hand
[43:14] for a bright revival when the enemy
[43:17] comes like a flood the spirit of god
[43:20] praises standards
[43:22] [Applause]
[43:25] [Music]
[43:28] glory
[43:29] you maybe see that
[43:31] i don't want something you come here for
[43:33] but i come in the preacher without god
[43:35] i have a message to deliver
[43:37] oh glory to god i know come what you're
[43:39] coming to hear but i am a word from the
[43:41] lord
[43:42] oh glory to god at the time is at hand
[43:45] and the prophetic vision is here that's
[43:48] what the prophet come to do to bring a
[43:50] prophetic vision to turn our ass back to
[43:52] the faith of the fathers that will be
[43:54] that focus
[43:56] oh glory we know where we come from we
[43:58] know where we go into
[44:00] oh hallelujah
[44:01] let me see that praise god
[44:04] hallelujah for the testimony of jesus
[44:09] is the spirit of prophecy
[44:12] and the prophecy could only come from
[44:14] the book
[44:15] so we cannot prophesy something that is
[44:17] not in the book it has to be the book
[44:20] because the lamb opened the book give it
[44:22] to the prophet the prophet gave it to
[44:24] the bride and there was supposed to be a
[44:26] fightful ministry saying what the texts
[44:29] say
[44:32] not interpreting what the tapes say
[44:37] but speaking what the tips say by
[44:38] revelation
[44:40] [Applause]
[44:44] because this vision that we connected
[44:46] with is what was sealed in daniel when
[44:49] god told daniel go that way
[44:51] the book is closed until the time of the
[44:54] end some end time people
[44:56] going to come in the end time

[45:00] did you hear what i'm saying
[45:02] you are not just normal people you are
[45:05] end time people we gonna close time we
[45:08] gonna close because in the end the
[45:10] seventh seal is the end of all things
[45:13] it's the end of the files the end of the
[45:15] plagues the end of struggling nature
[45:18] when the seven seals break
[45:20] [Music]
[45:20] [Applause]
[45:26] let me see this
[45:29] [Applause]
[45:32] to me we have the testimonies yes
[45:34] and that has been misunderstood
[45:36] because it's the spirit of prophecy
[45:39] prove isaac i can't prove isaac
[45:42] is in revelation
[45:44] hallelujah the transformation of syria
[45:45] happened yet prove this and prove that
[45:47] we can't prove nothing we say god's
[45:50] natural plural you have this through
[45:53] your new name
[45:54] we have this we have nothing we have the
[45:57] testimony of jesus
[45:59] take that devil
[46:00] oh glory to god we have the spirit of
[46:02] prophecy we know it's going to happen
[46:05] because god is a lie
[46:07] if god say you will be delivered you're
[46:08] going to be delivered if god say obesity
[46:11] you're going to be sealed if god sail be
[46:13] free only free
[46:14] [Applause]
[46:18] guarantee

[46:21] there's gonna be a revival in trinidad
[46:24] a holy ghost revival a seven thunder
[46:26] revival nothing will stop it
[46:31] and when i say nothing
[46:34] i mean nothing you know
[46:36] i mean lucy himself
[46:38] nothing will stop it because the mount
[46:40] of the lord had spoken it and god said
[46:43] my word
[46:45] shall not return void
[46:48] oh glory
[46:49] glory to god
[46:52] hallelujah

[58:21] and decide
[58:23] what you want to do
[58:24] if god be god serve him

[58:39] one way or the other and christian
[58:40] friend i believe we live in the end time
[58:42] that's when all things that are written
[58:44] in the bible is time now for all these
[58:46] things to come to pass
[58:47] and i believe that the very things that
[58:49] we see happening now is just exactly
[58:52] in season with god's word
[58:54] there was a time when the hebrew
[58:56] children had to make their stand
[58:58] whether they were going to bow down the
[59:00] hidden image and whether they're going
[59:01] to keep their fate that you were living
[59:03] god whether they will pray and so on
[59:06] them guys mark the behavior of the
[59:08] believers in that time and decide to get
[59:10] this statue for them to bow down and
[59:12] they can't pray and whatnot then fellas
[59:14] slam you open pray normal normal normal
[59:17] [Music]
[59:18] but if
[59:20] if there wasn't praying they couldn't
[59:21] get out there
[59:24] there wasn't frightening clothes now you
[59:25] don't say you know
[59:28] lord have mercy
[59:29] if you're not praying you can't come you
[59:31] can't match up with them you know
[59:32] because they had a consistency
[59:35] they're not praying no one again you
[59:37] have to come into a consistency in
[59:39] prayer how much time do muslims pray a
[59:41] day
[59:47] on the plane
[59:49] they put out a matter writing
[59:50] where they get girl mata milan pray i

[1:00:24] muslim

[1:00:29] and these people walk in the street with
[1:00:31] a smile
[1:00:33] they're walking proud
[1:00:38] let's continue
[1:00:44] god here we go
[1:00:46] daniel
[1:00:47] when he speaks anything
[1:00:49] he forces it into the place
[1:00:54] and daniel had to make a decision he
[1:00:56] went straight to the space of worship
[1:00:57] raised his windows and worshiped god and
[1:00:59] god protected his prophet god will
[1:01:02] always do it the time has come now for
[1:01:05] us to realize these things the time has
[1:01:07] come when god is breaking the boundaries
[1:01:10] down and the time has come when that
[1:01:12] devil is rising like a white lion going
[1:01:14] about roaring everything he can but the
[1:01:16] great battle is being set
[1:01:18] so god has to set us up for the battle
[1:01:21] if you ain't ready it will fight your
[1:01:23] ever be able to fight any battle the
[1:01:25] bible said when the enemy coming like a
[1:01:27] flood the spirit raises a standard and
[1:01:30] the prophet said the spirit raising the
[1:01:32] standard by making the world more
[1:01:34] positive because we have to raise rate
[1:01:37] for the time
[1:01:39] when the time is not yet you have to
[1:01:40] wait
[1:01:41] so god raises standard by making the
[1:01:43] world more positive in you
[1:01:45] so amidst abraham experience god to
[1:01:47] encourage him so when the angels came
[1:01:50] down he said i come to you to come again
[1:01:54] i come to remind you of your promise
[1:01:57] i will certainly return unto thee
[1:01:59] according to the time of life
[1:02:01] when abraham saw the angel he's oh gosh
[1:02:03] i can't make transformation oh gosh i
[1:02:05] cannot exact no no no no not yet i
[1:02:06] cannot tell you i coming
[1:02:09] so keep on prophecy
[1:02:12] you stand for 25 years
[1:02:14] oh hallelujah but at the time of life
[1:02:17] are coming back
[1:02:18] not in angel form not in man form not in
[1:02:22] messenger form not in flesh form but in
[1:02:24] power form

[1:02:28] shout out power

[1:02:41] i ain't pushing no man on you don't look
[1:02:43] for no man you have to look for the
[1:02:45] power the same power that struck abraham
[1:02:48] the same power that struck sarah
[1:02:51] that's empowered to strike you
[1:02:53] that same power struck them in the upper
[1:02:55] room
[1:02:55] was no man come along in the upper room
[1:02:58] explaining to them
[1:03:00] how to be a son of god
[1:03:02] come on people to me
[1:03:04] the power came upon them and placed them
[1:03:06] positionally
[1:03:08] and a cusp of fisherman said this is
[1:03:10] that
[1:03:11] that the prophet
[1:03:14] [Applause]
[1:03:23] and power hit him so he said this is
[1:03:25] that
[1:03:26] that the prophet jewel speak of
[1:03:28] hallelujah dynamics but clarity that
[1:03:31] there'll be no more confusion there was
[1:03:33] no confusion this is that
[1:03:36] there is no confusion because the
[1:03:38] manifestation
[1:03:40] is the interpretation all
[1:03:43] in the guarantees
[1:03:44] we don't need you to explain it
[1:03:47] let's see what you got come on now

[1:04:07] [Music]
[1:04:09] when god spoke to abraham and he
[1:04:10] received isaac a substance faith within
[1:04:13] him he couldn't share that with sarah
[1:04:17] that is his faith
[1:04:19] that is his revelation that is his
[1:04:21] testimony that is his prophecy he had to
[1:04:24] watch his ring of his wife and prophesy
[1:04:26] over her you have to watch her body
[1:04:28] getting hold and prophesy over her you
[1:04:30] have to keep her right there and not
[1:04:32] divorce her because that is the woman
[1:04:34] that god said by sarah you're gonna have
[1:04:36] this son call isaac okay the lord i
[1:04:38] shout sarah had our own interpretation
[1:04:40] to use hagar but god said at you sarah
[1:04:44] and if god said through you i don't care
[1:04:47] how you feel this morning you can feel
[1:04:49] backslidden you can feel whatever you

[1:04:55] somehow
[1:05:00] [Applause]
[1:05:09] hello
[1:05:11] [Applause]
[1:05:33] it take a certain time to be the white
[1:05:35] house known to take certain actions to
[1:05:36] call certain things
[1:05:41] come and take your foot and push
[1:05:42] all right
[1:05:43] [Music]
[1:05:47] he couldn't do it
[1:05:49] it's not his nature
[1:05:51] he can't do it
[1:05:53] he has to put man as a free moral agent
[1:05:55] believe out the eave walk
[1:05:57] [Music]
[1:05:58] that's why he has a lot by product
[1:06:00] because satan can come to the original
[1:06:04] that is why what we have here is
[1:06:05] original
[1:06:07] it cannot be defeated
[1:06:09] we
[1:06:10] will defeat that devil any place anytime
[1:06:14] anywhere on any condition i'm not

[1:06:44] because when jesus
[1:06:46] recognized he had to die and everything
[1:06:48] else he said destroy this body and three
[1:06:50] that raises up jesus talking on top of
[1:06:52] your head he's talking because david
[1:06:54] prophesied
[1:06:56] david prophesied i shall not suffer my
[1:07:00] holy one to seek corruption not leave
[1:07:02] his soul in hell
[1:07:10] so jesus knew
[1:07:11] by revelation he could rest his soul
[1:07:14] on david's prophecy
[1:07:16] [Applause]
[1:07:19] i daniel read my books what the prophet
[1:07:22] jeremiah spoke

[1:11:55] here
[1:11:55] look me here i was in joseph i was in
[1:11:59] daniel i was in paul i looked me here
[1:12:02] did you know you're only looking for
[1:12:03] greek
[1:12:04] and latin and they're interpreting this
[1:12:06] and figuring it out you have figured out
[1:12:08] nothing all you know is the same god
[1:12:11] that was in abraham saying god double
[1:12:14] moses that shame god
[1:12:16] is with me because he said i'll never
[1:12:19] leave you i never take you but i'll be
[1:12:21] with you even in your
[1:12:23] [Applause]
[1:12:31] [Music]
[1:12:32] [Applause]
[1:12:36] [Music]
[1:12:38] [Applause]
[1:12:43] if you confess jesus with your lips
[1:12:45] it won't do no good
[1:12:47] but from your heart
[1:12:49] if you believe jesus is the son of god
[1:12:51] you can't live the same life you want to
[1:12:54] live
[1:12:55] you can't if you ever
[1:12:56] get a true view of calvary
[1:12:58] or if you just take in a past that way
[1:13:01] you're fooling yourself
[1:13:02] but when you really get a view
[1:13:05] of what jesus was who am i how i like to
[1:13:07] preach the deity the supreme deity of
[1:13:09] jesus christ
[1:13:10] if you could ever realize who he was
[1:13:13] and what he did for you
[1:13:15] men and women your hearts would reign
[1:13:16] within you
[1:13:18] you'll be willing to throw away the
[1:13:19] trash of the world
[1:13:21] to live for him
[1:13:22] how marvelous what a person he was if
[1:13:25] you realize condescending of god himself
[1:13:29] unfolding himself coming down till he
[1:13:31] could get into your heart
[1:13:34] the purpose of the word is to present a
[1:13:36] channel that god could ride in here
[1:13:40] [Applause]
[1:13:42] the word is the conductor of the spirit
[1:13:48] so before the spirit could come there's
[1:13:50] a whom he hath believed you were sealed
[1:13:53] with that spirit of promise
[1:13:55] because the word gave you a channel to
[1:13:57] access god
[1:13:59] adam fell from the word
[1:14:02] and because of that he couldn't stay in
[1:14:04] perfection
[1:14:06] god had to put him out
[1:14:08] because that gardner even was prepared
[1:14:09] for perfection so adam fell from the
[1:14:12] image of god so god has to kick him out
[1:14:15] but god purposed to restore back the
[1:14:17] image
[1:14:18] which is the first man that god made
[1:14:21] back in the earth
[1:14:22] so adam was placed an adult
[1:14:25] he never went through process
[1:14:29] and he fell
[1:14:31] because he didn't go through the process
[1:14:33] so god purpose money coming that way
[1:14:35] again
[1:14:36] he's going to process
[1:14:38] he himself accept the process
[1:14:41] a virgin shall conceive
[1:14:46] he himself stopped from baby
[1:14:49] and that is the christmas story
[1:14:51] [Applause]
[1:14:54] jehovah jehovah's the baby
[1:14:57] hallelujah go into the process
[1:14:59] because you know you have to go to the
[1:15:00] process
[1:15:02] hallelujah give you a scripture in the
[1:15:04] beginning was the word
[1:15:05] the word was with god the word was god
[1:15:08] with god and the word was god he came
[1:15:10] onto his own his own receive them not
[1:15:12] but as many as receive him to them
[1:15:15] give power to become

[1:18:06] know what something the people making
[1:18:07] love in the church right and the holy
[1:18:09] spirit dropped back on the prophet
[1:18:10] whatever you say what happened to them
[1:18:12] you said dead blind blind whatever you
[1:18:14] give my whole list
[1:18:15] and he chose none of the above
[1:18:19] even humanistic man taking all oil in
[1:18:21] them blind death this that that speak
[1:18:23] the world
[1:18:27] [Applause]
[1:18:37] what should i pick
[1:18:40] blank not dead
[1:18:42] [Music]
[1:18:43] maybe blind undead
[1:18:47] the prophet chose none of the above
[1:18:49] he said i forgive you
[1:18:51] you nobody did that you can do it there
[1:18:54] because he recognized he did mistakes he
[1:18:56] had his failures he had his shortcomings

[1:19:17] and and and get away to us
[1:19:19] that is big problems
[1:19:22] because arrogant spirit is not of god
[1:19:26] god works

[1:19:46] are
[1:19:47] almighty or and powerful you are let
[1:19:50] your works declare your greatness

[1:23:41] i don't know which one's the lesser
[1:23:44] but bo is both evil
[1:23:46] either one is evil but god set it up
[1:23:49] that way yeah

[1:26:49] ahead of your situation let's continue
[1:26:51] oh my
[1:26:52] god hallelujah hallelujah
[1:26:55] [Music]
[1:26:57] almighty being
[1:26:59] who
[1:27:00] humbled himself unfolding himself and
[1:27:02] committed a body of flesh that any man
[1:27:04] could touch with his hands what is he
[1:27:06] doing claiming his role trying to get
[1:27:08] into man
[1:27:09] he went and offered his own blood when
[1:27:12] no other blood could do
[1:27:14] no wonder he was the priceless price of
[1:27:16] heaven no wonder he was king of kings he
[1:27:18] unfolded himself and come down
[1:27:21] and submitted himself
[1:27:24] on the cross and die
[1:27:26] and when he was standing there someone
[1:27:28] said i could call my father and he could
[1:27:29] send me ten legion of angels but my
[1:27:31] kingdom is not of this world
[1:27:33] and here the crowd saying away with him
[1:27:36] away with him why didn't he turn around
[1:27:38] and say away with you
[1:27:39] here's the reason he couldn't friends
[1:27:41] look at it
[1:27:43] them
[1:27:44] was his own children to think of a man's
[1:27:47] children
[1:27:48] crying for their daddy's blood
[1:27:51] if my children was running for my blood
[1:27:53] there's been nothing else i could see
[1:27:55] take me
[1:27:56] he if he refused to do it he lost his
[1:27:58] child his very creation his human beings
[1:28:02] and they was the one that was calling
[1:28:03] for his blood could you imagine the
[1:28:06] children calling for their father's
[1:28:07] blood
[1:28:08] that is the reason he couldn't say no
[1:28:12] if he said no they were lost
[1:28:14] i will die freely from my child for my
[1:28:17] children and any other father would look
[1:28:19] what he was his own children crying for
[1:28:21] his blood
[1:28:22] oh my and the blood of sheep couldn't do
[1:28:23] it blood of goats couldn't do it blood
[1:28:25] of cattle couldn't do it but the blood
[1:28:27] of god himself
[1:28:28] and the great thundering person among
[1:28:30] sinai was here in flesh then
[1:28:32] then he cleansed the way that he could
[1:28:35] come and live in your heart
[1:28:36] now that same spirit that funded from
[1:28:39] mount sinai is living in the human being
[1:28:42] what a marvelous that ought to set every
[1:28:44] heart jumping
[1:28:45] a man done a sin
[1:28:47] he committed adultery he stole or broke
[1:28:51] the sabbath commandment then he had to
[1:28:53] get a lamb he had to bring this lamb
[1:28:55] into the elders now there's a reason why
[1:28:57] i'm reading it right with me
[1:28:59] this may be a very long time but i want
[1:29:00] you to go with me there's a reason i'm
[1:29:02] reading this
[1:29:03] watch this so the man sin he commits
[1:29:06] adultery he's told he broke a sabbath
[1:29:08] then he had to get a lamb this is
[1:29:09] protestant he had to bring the llama to
[1:29:11] the elders they had to look this lamb
[1:29:13] over the lamb had to be blameless had to
[1:29:16] be without a flow on it look at the
[1:29:18] significance here the lamb had to be
[1:29:21] blameless
[1:29:23] for a blamed person
[1:29:28] [Applause]
[1:29:33] i remember the story i don't know
[1:29:35] whether i ever told it or not just a
[1:29:36] fiction story under the law if our old
[1:29:39] mother horse had a cold and it was a
[1:29:40] mule you know and his ears broke down
[1:29:42] his knees knocked what a cross i
[1:29:44] horrible looking mew that mew he could
[1:29:46] look at himself he said oh god oh my
[1:29:48] when a master come he will kill me
[1:29:51] because he couldn't feed me i'm not
[1:29:52] willing to live look at me what a
[1:29:54] horrible looking mess i am but if the
[1:29:56] mother could speak back to that little
[1:29:57] fellow she would say wait a minute honey
[1:29:59] you can live
[1:30:00] because you are my first and you have a
[1:30:02] birthright now when the master come out
[1:30:05] and sees you with all your condition he
[1:30:06] has got to go back and get a lamb
[1:30:08] without blemish on it and kill it so
[1:30:10] that up looking moon could live
[1:30:13] you see the priest never seen the mule
[1:30:15] he saw the lamb
[1:30:17] it wasn't whether the mule was perfect
[1:30:20] it had to be a perfect lamb
[1:30:22] i hope you see it it isn't whether you
[1:30:24] are good enough to be a christian
[1:30:27] or not it is whether he was good enough
[1:30:30] and if god accepted him and his blood
[1:30:32] makes an atonement god don't see you
[1:30:35] he sees the lamb
[1:30:37] that's the little mule could stick up
[1:30:39] his air tail in the air and snort and
[1:30:41] jump and run around over the field and
[1:30:44] have a good time
[1:30:45] he is going to live
[1:30:49] but one perfect had to die
[1:30:51] that was me william branham no good not
[1:30:55] fit to live worried to go to hell born
[1:30:57] in a sinful family raise a sinner no god
[1:30:59] at all
[1:31:01] but one day
[1:31:02] i accepted
[1:31:04] and when god looked upon christ christ
[1:31:06] took my place then god don't see me
[1:31:09] he sees the perfect one
[1:31:12] then as long as i'm in here in him
[1:31:15] i am perfected
[1:31:17] not in myself in him
[1:31:20] this is the part i want to get to
[1:31:22] not my perfection i don't have any but
[1:31:25] it is his perfection
[1:31:27] oh give the lord a shout
[1:31:30] oh glory to god is not your perfection
[1:31:33] it's his perfection
[1:31:35] oh glory to god
[1:31:37] hallelujah
[1:31:39] glory to god
[1:31:41] let's just cap it off here so paul said
[1:31:43] when the worshiper come and bring
[1:31:45] if he done wrong he come with a little
[1:31:47] lamb the priest checked the lamb and so
[1:31:48] on and here comes the man that was done
[1:31:50] wrong i have been stealing and i know
[1:31:52] now i'm subject to death because i did
[1:31:55] wrong god wouldn't want me to steal his
[1:31:58] commandments said not now i'm going to
[1:32:00] lay my hands upon the lamb and god
[1:32:02] commandment said here thou shalt not
[1:32:03] steal i stole i know i am somebody said
[1:32:06] that something got to answer for my sin
[1:32:08] because i stole and god said the day
[1:32:10] either of that day you die you steal you
[1:32:13] gotta die for it so he required if i
[1:32:15] didn't want to die i had to bring a lamb
[1:32:17] so i laid the lamb down here i put my
[1:32:18] hands a little fellow i said lord i'm
[1:32:20] sorry that i stole i confess and promise
[1:32:23] you i won't steal anymore but accept me
[1:32:25] now and god accept him
[1:32:27] because the lamb took that place
[1:32:29] oh isn't that right
[1:32:31] hallelujah
[1:32:32] so you see
[1:32:34] now we see that we do wrong and i have
[1:32:36] did wrong i have sinned i have lived
[1:32:38] wrong i've done wrong now i come to the
[1:32:39] altar by feet i see the sacrifice i lay
[1:32:42] my hands upon jesus head i said dear god
[1:32:45] i know i'm a sin and the wisdom is dead
[1:32:47] and you get talking and so on oh
[1:32:49] hallelujah oh glory to god the first man
[1:32:52] went under the law on the animals but
[1:32:54] couldn't change his heart because our
[1:32:56] animal life wouldn't compare with a
[1:32:58] human life our animal life is a living
[1:33:00] being but not a soul but god put a soul
[1:33:02] on man and what is the soul the nature
[1:33:05] of the spirit so the soul of jesus
[1:33:08] coming inside of you you release the
[1:33:10] holy ghost and your nature change and
[1:33:13] you are dying out and you are being born
[1:33:15] again by the spirit isn't that something
[1:33:17] else hallelujah and when he made one
[1:33:20] sacrifice for himself every sin every
[1:33:22] desire everything was taken from the
[1:33:24] man's heart and he stands perfected in
[1:33:26] the sight of god not by what he has done
[1:33:29] but what jesus done for him
[1:33:31] [Applause]
[1:33:33] this song is so simple right but many
[1:33:35] people still don't accept this they're
[1:33:37] still wallowing in the condemnation and
[1:33:39] you have to accept this
[1:33:40] oh glory to god you accept the blood
[1:33:42] speaking on your behalf and when god
[1:33:44] looked down he doesn't see you he sees
[1:33:46] your voice coming through the blood that
[1:33:48] blood is speaking i die for them
[1:33:52] i took their place
[1:33:53] see they said the guilty the guilt is a
[1:33:55] year but i pay the price
[1:33:57] that's why i win the calvary
[1:34:00] so you have to dismiss the case
[1:34:02] oh glory to god because they were to die
[1:34:04] but i stand in their stead
[1:34:06] you have to go free
[1:34:10] you have to go free

[1:36:21] him he needs some writing joy and
[1:36:23] writing you get him he gave them some
[1:36:25] time
[1:36:26] to think it over
[1:36:27] to search their heart because the word

[1:36:31] insane as he tossed and sent to the
[1:36:32] heart he know them as ratchet you know

[1:37:30] run for the money
[1:37:32] when she set her free she's had said
[1:37:33] iran you know and you know
[1:37:35] the reason jesus could catch at that
[1:37:36] time because she's not going to have
[1:37:38] virgins and other nice people who who
[1:37:39] going to church regularly did go in a
[1:37:41] certain time
[1:37:42] so she going different timing from the

[1:37:45] went out to thailand she didn't expect
[1:37:47] me jesus but he come out to time into
[1:37:49] because he want to meet her
[1:37:51] this is his appointment because he's the

[1:50:18] testimony of jesus
[1:50:20] by the spirit of prophecy
[1:50:23] all glory to god to prophesy
[1:50:25] of this bride
[1:50:26] that could not come to perfection
[1:50:28] before the resurrection i want to say it
[1:50:31] again you have to come to perfection
[1:50:34] before the resurrection
[1:50:35] and that's why i read is not your
[1:50:37] perfection
[1:50:38] it is his perfection
[1:50:40] oh underneath the blood
[1:50:43] hallelujah
[1:50:45] glory to god
[1:50:47] hallelujah
[1:50:49] so this prophetic vision
[1:50:51] of the end time
[1:50:53] that was loose by that malachi for
[1:50:55] prophet
[1:50:56] came in two parts
[1:50:58] one
[1:50:59] was the learning of his word
[1:51:02] as he said
[1:51:03] in the time of the revelation of these
[1:51:06] things being made known
[1:51:09] so we have been living under that time
[1:51:12] of the revelation
[1:51:14] of these things being made known
[1:51:17] but at some point
[1:51:19] it have to change
[1:51:21] to the manifestation
[1:51:23] of these things
[1:51:25] that was made known
[1:51:27] oh glory to god i say the time is at
[1:51:29] hand
[1:51:30] all glory to god
[1:51:32] the change on the mechanics of the
[1:51:33] dynamics the change from the revelation
[1:51:35] of these things we may have known all
[1:51:37] the mysteries being revealed these
[1:51:39] mystery truths being revealed into the
[1:51:42] manifestation
[1:51:44] because you cannot say seven thunders

[1:51:48] seven thunders is to become a
[1:51:50] manifestation
[1:51:51] seven thunders is in two parts
[1:51:53] revelation and manifestation i say the
[1:51:55] time is at hand
[1:51:56] for the manifestation of the seven
[1:51:59] thunders
[1:52:00] oh glory to god where sons are replacing

[1:52:25] all of them with the open vision
[1:52:27] i want the whole church to have this
[1:52:29] vision the whole church have a prophetic
[1:52:31] vision what the prophet revealed
[1:52:33] that you have to become you have to
[1:52:35] become a living word right let's
[1:52:37] continue
[1:52:38] oh hallelujah
[1:52:39] [Applause]
[1:52:41] what abram says seven seals seven
[1:52:43] spirits seven angels seven horns
[1:52:45] seven churches seven sevens

[1:52:52] lamb i've been seen having seven heads
[1:52:54] seven eyes which which are the seven
[1:52:56] spirits of god same for the holy earth
[1:52:58] what is those seven spirits
[1:53:01] them
[1:53:02] seven messengers
[1:53:07] he interpreted that
[1:53:08] he converted seven spirit into seven
[1:53:11] messengers he said there is in columbus
[1:53:12] irenas john wesley martin and so forth
[1:53:15] the seven spirits which are seven men
[1:53:18] which are seven messages

[1:53:24] you have to preach the messages
[1:53:26] [Applause]
[1:53:30] these seven men don't come into you
[1:53:35] so when you're converted to seven
[1:53:36] spirits

[1:54:11] seven church ages at the seven seats of
[1:54:13] mercy for the people here they are seven
[1:54:15] seas of mercy seven seats seven churches
[1:54:19] seven stars seven manifestation seven
[1:54:21] spirits seven lamps oh my oh god is
[1:54:24] perfect
[1:54:26] oh glory to god
[1:54:28] so what the prophet did the prophet come
[1:54:30] and bring us a big panoramic
[1:54:32] of this vision
[1:54:33] of the end time showing the jew that is
[1:54:35] supposed to be the six seals being
[1:54:37] unfolded judgment the white horse rider
[1:54:38] riding straight to hell oh glory to god
[1:54:40] but he saw a vision of the bride being
[1:54:43] called out he saw a vision of a bride
[1:54:45] come back and step he saw a vision of
[1:54:47] the bride just like the first one
[1:54:49] oh walking on what christian soul is
[1:54:51] matching on the wall
[1:54:53] he saw that bride and the one who had
[1:54:55] outer step the voice said get back in
[1:54:57] step
[1:54:58] what step the step of the word
[1:55:00] there's only seven steps to go
[1:55:02] get back in step fate
[1:55:04] virtue knowledge only stem cell
[1:55:06] perfection it's not 27 steps no it's not
[1:55:09] 27 mysteries there's only seven
[1:55:11] mysteries
[1:55:12] it's seven voices
[1:55:14] seven thunders
[1:55:15] seven voices seven steps oh glory to god
[1:55:18] are you with me
[1:55:20] hallelujah praise be to jesus
[1:55:23] hallelujah
[1:55:24] so what all this message to produce is
[1:55:26] supposed to bring back listen carefully
[1:55:28] the ministry of jesus christ
[1:55:35] not my ministry
[1:55:37] this is my ministry no no
[1:55:39] it's supposed to restore
[1:55:42] the ministry of jesus christ back among
[1:55:45] the people
[1:55:46] then you say at the finishing of the
[1:55:48] seventh seal we're supposed to be all
[1:55:50] the way up there
[1:55:52] and then we are worshiping the living
[1:55:53] christ
[1:55:54] him moving in and out
[1:55:56] among us who is that christ
[1:55:58] oh hallelujah priest do you believe that
[1:56:01] thank you no thank you lord
[1:56:04] hallelujah give him some praises
[1:56:06] glory to god
[1:56:09] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:56:11] thank you lord
[1:56:12] jesus glory
[1:56:15] god alone holds the key
[1:56:18] who do men say either son of man
[1:56:20] thou art the christ
[1:56:22] so god holds the key to revelation
[1:56:25] god alone who is that
[1:56:27] now there is no school
[1:56:29] no theologians
[1:56:31] no teachings of the bible among any
[1:56:32] school that knows anything about it
[1:56:35] they cannot know nothing about it is
[1:56:38] impossible for them to know about about
[1:56:39] it god has hid the senses of knowing it
[1:56:44] from the very elected teachers
[1:56:49] it's a personal individual fear
[1:56:52] with the person
[1:56:54] that christ is revealed to them
[1:56:58] so when somebody wants to manage you
[1:57:01] and bring it on to the umbrella
[1:57:03] like if you're gonna lose your salvation
[1:57:05] if you're gonna lose your life you're
[1:57:06] gonna die at church or whatever it is
[1:57:08] all of that is foolishness because this
[1:57:10] is not you and mary and god
[1:57:13] this is not you the pastor and god is
[1:57:15] you and god
[1:57:16] the pastor is dead to fulfill a role in
[1:57:18] a purpose but you are his sons and
[1:57:20] daughters
[1:57:21] and the faithful ministry is placed for
[1:57:24] your perfection
[1:57:25] to bring you into the channel that the
[1:57:26] spirit could flow freely
[1:57:29] oh glory to god because the spirit have
[1:57:31] to come into the body
[1:57:33] and flow out
[1:57:35] peter was in the body
[1:57:36] and it flowed out to the etobin eunuch
[1:57:38] it flowed out to cornelius house why
[1:57:40] people he had speak these words god
[1:57:42] shocked him he didn't expect that
[1:57:45] when he began to speak the word the holy
[1:57:46] ghost fell on cornelius and open up the
[1:57:49] door for the gentiles they serve the
[1:57:51] truth look the holy ghost that fell on
[1:57:52] us fell on them
[1:57:54] so god mixing up this thing god is
[1:57:56] stopping with us the jews alone it going
[1:57:58] on to the entire world
[1:58:00] no it's going the opposite god about to
[1:58:02] finish the gentiles
[1:58:04] that is where we have to get desperate
[1:58:06] because there is so much hole he goes in
[1:58:08] the bucket
[1:58:09] to access
[1:58:11] he call it he call it the last drop in
[1:58:14] the bucket
[1:58:15] when that access that's it you know
[1:58:17] book is closed
[1:58:18] captioning not
[1:58:30] [Music]
[1:58:33] he has revealed available me
[1:58:35] and the life
[1:58:36] that christ produced here in the bible
[1:58:39] that same life is in him doesn't produce
[1:58:41] itself you have got the wrong revelation
[1:58:45] i a man talk all kind of thing about the
[1:58:46] angel and and his ministry and this and
[1:58:50] that and so on overseas i i hear
[1:58:53] everybody claiming some kind of thing
[1:58:55] but the life
[1:58:57] is something completely different
[1:58:59] and that's what seeing if the angel come
[1:59:01] and say something
[1:59:02] and the life is not there what do you
[1:59:04] want with the angel
[1:59:05] change the angel
[1:59:07] dismiss that angel say i don't want you
[1:59:10] because you have to produce a life
[1:59:13] i don't want to angel with me because i
[1:59:15] give and i'm a slacker
[1:59:17] and there's no life with it and i came
[1:59:18] in some manifestation i don't want no
[1:59:20] manifestation like that i want that
[1:59:24] i don't need to see a sign you know i
[1:59:26] just want this
[1:59:27] i want this thing living in me i want to
[1:59:30] know my wife could see it feel it i want
[1:59:32] a maturing to see it
[1:59:36] let me drop this bomb on you he said the
[1:59:38] ministry
[1:59:40] has reached perfection
[1:59:42] when christ is reproduced
[1:59:45] in the natural
[1:59:49] that is not talking christ
[1:59:52] that is not preaching a message
[1:59:57] that is reproducing
[1:59:59] the same life that jesus had
[2:00:03] oozing out your flesh

[2:05:38] is love
[2:05:44] you will write the book of must be on
[2:05:45] your season cause it's the same life
[2:05:48] see what i mean you just can't get away
[2:05:51] from it it's the life of christ in you
[2:05:54] being injected in you
[2:05:55] by the holy spirit itself living its
[2:05:57] life through you
[2:05:59] he said god here we go
[2:06:01] is known
[2:06:02] by simplicity
[2:06:04] and the revelation of jesus christ
[2:06:07] to the most illiterate person
[2:06:15] so the person who can't read and write
[2:06:17] in here or anybody
[2:06:19] they could get a revelation
[2:06:22] of jesus christ
[2:06:23] and god can make himself known
[2:06:25] to that person
[2:06:27] the most
[2:06:29] illiterate person
[2:06:31] therefore you don't need education
[2:06:33] to get revelation
[2:06:35] [Applause]
[2:06:38] you don't have to be educated
[2:06:41] to get
[2:06:42] revelation
[2:06:44] here we go
[2:06:45] see not your theology it's a revelation
[2:06:48] of jesus christ upon this rock i'll be
[2:06:49] in my church no other rocks accepted no
[2:06:52] nothing's accepted not a roman rock nor
[2:06:54] the protestant rock nor that school no
[2:06:55] nothing but on exactly the revelation of
[2:06:57] jesus christ through the new birth he
[2:06:59] bonds in there and he injects his own
[2:07:00] life and your life is gone and the life
[2:07:02] of christ is project itself through you
[2:07:05] with preeminences
[2:07:07] that means
[2:07:09] yourself is disappearing
[2:07:11] the life of christ projecting through
[2:07:13] you so it wouldn't be okay i know me
[2:07:15] right i am to you i know me i know my
[2:07:17] nature and something like that but when
[2:07:19] christ begins to take over i would see
[2:07:21] less of me
[2:07:23] and more of him
[2:07:25] because you will know you
[2:07:27] and when you begin to behave in a
[2:07:29] behavior that is unlike you you know
[2:07:31] it's him
[2:07:32] [Applause]
[2:07:35] come on come on come on now come on now
[2:07:37] [Music]
[2:07:37] [Applause]
[2:07:38] you are you
[2:07:42] but when his life began to be projected
[2:07:44] through you you will find yourself
[2:07:46] operating on a higher level
[2:07:48] not the humanistic realm but the realm
[2:07:51] of revelation breaking it division
[2:07:54] because that's the three steps
[2:07:55] is that any humanistic
[2:07:57] okay the humanistic realm is making
[2:07:59] fight for the pastor
[2:08:00] in fact we see we see that for
[2:08:02] extremists for me and like
[2:08:20] shooting now they want to get one person
[2:08:23] you know but
[2:08:25] i don't do that
[2:08:26] i'll meet him by yourself and shoot your
[2:08:27] poo
[2:08:32] one shot one shoot
[2:08:35] you will know is who i'm talking to
[2:08:37] i don't need to take pulpit time to
[2:08:38] blast
[2:08:40] one person with an issue
[2:08:42] no
[2:08:42] i will tell you
[2:08:44] and you will know it's you i'm talking
[2:08:45] to you
[2:08:48] you can have time i see pastors
[2:08:49] preaching and blasts in the water and
[2:08:51] you personally trying to get you looking
[2:08:52] wrong soon
[2:08:56] one time my sister owen simon amen
[2:08:58] before the statement even finished he
[2:08:59] said amen amen amen amen and he passed a
[2:09:02] blast in that email but she wants people
[2:09:03] to aim into that too
[2:09:05] she still knows she is easy
[2:09:09] she's taught me
[2:09:18] he said watch god's revelation unfolding
[2:09:22] by lack of this revelation is why we
[2:09:24] have so much divisions among us so much
[2:09:27] mockery so much division is because the
[2:09:30] people lack that revelation they lack
[2:09:33] that revelation the teachers
[2:09:36] he is saying teachers
[2:09:38] lack the revelation of jesus christ
[2:09:42] then what are they really teaching is
[2:09:43] intellect
[2:09:45] all right i think i'll try to wrap up
[2:09:47] here listen i can walk two more always i
[2:09:49] feel sorry like a rock i feel like
[2:09:51] strong like a ox
[2:09:54] i feel like i know started here right
[2:09:55] now there's not even a second when i
[2:09:57] step in the first round
[2:10:12] let me see where i'm at let's see what
[2:10:14] page i'm at here
[2:10:17] i have
[2:10:19] 22 pages and i think i've now reached
[2:10:21] page 15.
[2:10:22] yes after you two pages i know you
[2:10:24] should be 15. it's about papa and he
[2:10:26] trained right now all right so this is
[2:10:29] uh pick up the pen and write the lord
[2:10:31] spoke to him i was seeking the lord and
[2:10:32] the holy spirit told me to pick up my
[2:10:34] pen and write i grasped the pen to write
[2:10:37] his spirit gave me a message for the
[2:10:39] church and i want to bring it to you it
[2:10:41] has to do with the word and the bride
[2:10:43] now i know this is things we heard
[2:10:44] before but i want to hear it again i
[2:10:46] feel it's a special season and time and
[2:10:48] i feel it's applicable to the time and
[2:10:49] season we're in that is why i'm bringing
[2:10:51] it to you
[2:10:52] this is what the prophet this is what
[2:10:54] god spoke here is what i'm trying to say
[2:10:57] to you the law of reproduction is that
[2:10:59] each specie would bring forth after its
[2:11:01] unkind even according to genesis 1 11
[2:11:04] and god said that it would bring forth
[2:11:06] grass to help even see the fruit tree
[2:11:07] and fruit after his kind whose season
[2:11:09] itself upon the earth it was so whatever
[2:11:11] life was in the seeds came forth into a
[2:11:13] plant dancing to the fruit that is a
[2:11:15] process the very law applies to the
[2:11:17] church today whatever seed started the
[2:11:19] church will comfort and be like the
[2:11:21] original seed because it is the same
[2:11:23] seed
[2:11:24] in these last days here we go
[2:11:26] the true bright church
[2:11:27] christ's seed
[2:11:29] will come to the head soon
[2:11:31] number one
[2:11:33] hallelujah will come to where
[2:11:35] the headstone the bright church will
[2:11:37] come to the headstone
[2:11:38] then he said in citizenship does the uh
[2:11:40] does the uh
[2:11:42] um
[2:11:43] the thunders cap the pyramid
[2:11:47] so the thomas is the headstone
[2:11:49] yes
[2:11:51] the thundus is the capstone revelation
[2:11:53] of jesus christ
[2:11:54] in two parts
[2:11:56] mechanics and dynamics
[2:11:58] so people fight up with mechanics these
[2:11:59] years not even understanding them
[2:12:02] mechanics was only making way for
[2:12:04] dynamics
[2:12:05] because he said my word is spirit and
[2:12:07] life
[2:12:08] it's not just learning of the word is
[2:12:10] power being manifested
[2:12:11] so your promise is not just a word
[2:12:13] promise your promises have to be a
[2:12:15] living promise a manifested promise when
[2:12:18] god gave abraham the word of isaiah that
[2:12:19] word for 25 years but then isaac had to
[2:12:22] come
[2:12:23] to vindicate the word
[2:12:24] that god came 25 years ago
[2:12:27] god not lying to us if god said in the
[2:12:30] last day we'll be a super church there's
[2:12:31] no no lie
[2:12:32] super race another life
[2:12:34] as we near the headstone
[2:12:39] that means every message should be
[2:12:41] pushing us towards the headstone
[2:12:46] [Music]
[2:12:48] which is the love
[2:12:49] because the love is the strength of the
[2:12:51] entire body
[2:12:52] [Applause]
[2:12:53] so as they climb up higher getting more
[2:12:55] stronger and stronger we're getting the
[2:12:56] strength let's continue
[2:12:58] watch
[2:12:59] the true bright church christ seed will
[2:13:01] come to the headstone and she will be
[2:13:07] this is prophecy
[2:13:09] she
[2:13:10] did not church members
[2:13:12] this is not natural church this is the
[2:13:13] bride
[2:13:15] she will be
[2:13:17] the super church
[2:13:18] a super race as she nears him
[2:13:22] day in the bride
[2:13:23] will be so much like him that they will
[2:13:26] be in his very image
[2:13:28] number one very image
[2:13:31] before power image
[2:13:35] i'm not hearing you
[2:13:37] before adam had power what did god say
[2:13:39] let us make man
[2:13:40] in our image and likeness then let him
[2:13:43] have dominion
[2:13:44] so to come back to power you have to
[2:13:46] come back to image to come back to power
[2:13:48] you have to come back to the pyramid to
[2:13:50] come back to power you have to come out
[2:13:51] to them virtues
[2:13:53] [Applause]
[2:13:55] i'm not having you
[2:13:57] hallelujah
[2:13:59] she the bride will be in his very image
[2:14:02] so he is prophesying that you will have
[2:14:04] the token he is prophesying you will
[2:14:06] have all m7 virtues he is prophesied you
[2:14:08] will have the life of jesus christ he is
[2:14:10] prophesying he will come to perfection
[2:14:11] oh give the lord a shout you can't sit
[2:14:13] here under that prophecy
[2:14:18] without giving god some worship
[2:14:26] [Music]
[2:14:27] [Applause]
[2:14:28] why this image
[2:14:30] why
[2:14:31] let the spirit that turned people
[2:14:33] attendants right explain why the bride
[2:14:35] have to be in his very image the next
[2:14:37] statement identifies why
[2:14:39] this is in order
[2:14:42] to be united with him
[2:14:46] they will be won
[2:14:50] that is why the holy ghost can never
[2:14:51] come down and dry
[2:14:54] they were praising and blessing god
[2:14:56] continually so they had an atmosphere
[2:14:59] to prepare themselves for the atmosphere
[2:15:03] so if there is no worship nothing is
[2:15:05] coming
[2:15:06] i have no revival coming that church is
[2:15:08] a tribulation church
[2:15:10] every dead church is tribulation church
[2:15:20] [Music]

[2:15:26] purpose of image
[2:15:28] to be one with him
[2:15:30] what is he fight for ministry for
[2:15:32] for the perfecting his sins
[2:15:34] work of the ministry

[2:21:09] oh glory to god because that's the
[2:21:10] promise to turn our ass back to the feet
[2:21:12] of the fathers
[2:21:14] oh glory to god i could say so much
[2:21:15] things
[2:21:16] this is an ordinary with him there will
[2:21:18] be one yetis prophecy they the bride
[2:21:21] will be the very
[2:21:24] manifestation
[2:21:25] of the word of the living god
[2:21:28] denominations cannot produce this
[2:21:31] he's a wrong seed they reproduce their
[2:21:33] craze and dogmas mixed with the word
[2:21:36] this mongolizing brings a hybrid product
[2:21:39] the first other adam was a spoken seed
[2:21:41] word of god he was given the bride to
[2:21:43] reproduce himself that is why the bride
[2:21:45] was given to him to reproduce himself
[2:21:48] to produce another son but she fell by
[2:21:51] hybridization she caused him to die the
[2:21:53] second son jesus also a spoken seed word
[2:21:56] of god was given a bride like adam but
[2:21:58] before he could marry her she also
[2:22:00] fallen she like adam's wife was put to
[2:22:02] the test whether she would believe the
[2:22:04] word of god and live and dull the word
[2:22:06] and die she doubted she left the world
[2:22:07] and died but here we go
[2:22:09] from a little group
[2:22:11] of the true seed of the word
[2:22:13] that's the first part it has all seed
[2:22:16] but it's the true seed so from the true
[2:22:18] seed
[2:22:19] have a little group coming out god
[2:22:21] represents christ with a beloved bride
[2:22:23] she's a version of his word she is a
[2:22:24] virgin because she knows no man made
[2:22:26] christian dogmas by and through the
[2:22:29] members of the bride
[2:22:31] will be fulfilled all
[2:22:32] that was promised to be made manifest by
[2:22:35] the virgin the word i promise came to
[2:22:38] the virgin mary but the word of promise
[2:22:40] was he himself
[2:22:42] think about that now the word was he
[2:22:50] he's not saying the word is doctrine
[2:22:52] the word of promise
[2:22:55] was he himself
[2:22:57] to remain manifest
[2:23:01] so it's more than just word
[2:23:03] word changing the he
[2:23:08] so the mystery comes known as the word
[2:23:10] and the word changed to him
[2:23:13] ah
[2:23:14] who is him
[2:23:18] as many as receive him
[2:23:20] to them give he power
[2:23:23] he and the word is the same
[2:23:24] in the beginning was the word the word
[2:23:26] become him by the word becoming flesh
[2:23:28] that's him
[2:23:30] but for him to come into you and come by
[2:23:32] the word the world coming to you that's
[2:23:34] the secret
[2:23:37] and then the word turned to spirit power
[2:23:39] in you
[2:23:39] [Applause]
[2:23:41] [Music]
[2:23:42] it come like right under the devil's
[2:23:44] nose god slipped the word inside of you
[2:23:47] in silence
[2:23:53] and the devil is messed up because he
[2:23:56] cannot see the treasure hidden in
[2:23:58] earthen vessels oh could we give the
[2:24:00] lord a shout out
[2:24:02] [Music]
[2:24:06] remember season
[2:24:07] so as far as satan come back again as if
[2:24:09] there will be because he's not sure he
[2:24:11] don't know who you are
[2:24:12] so he don't know who we are you think
[2:24:14] we're playing with words and playing
[2:24:15] with game and and things like that a
[2:24:16] bunch of people on the internet and they
[2:24:18] ram this and random that and i said as
[2:24:19] foolishness and whatnot fighting the
[2:24:21] prophet half of them was even wrong they
[2:24:22] wasn't born there they know nothing
[2:24:24] about no experience they're only saying
[2:24:25] what other people say
[2:24:29] and they're fighting they have to do it
[2:24:32] they are non-seeds
[2:24:36] so they can be quickened
[2:24:38] this message is not for them
[2:24:39] this message is for his brain
[2:24:42] let me continue quickly
[2:24:44] watch the word of promise was he himself
[2:24:47] to be manifest god was being manifest he
[2:24:49] himself acted at that time and fulfill
[2:24:52] his own word of promise to the virgin it
[2:24:54] was an angel that brought her the
[2:24:55] message but the angel's message was the
[2:24:57] word of god and he fulfilled it at a
[2:24:59] time the members of the bride will love
[2:25:01] him
[2:25:02] they will have his potentials
[2:25:05] for he is their head
[2:25:07] not the man in england that's a man in
[2:25:09] these states not some man in africa or
[2:25:12] south america or trinidad i don't know
[2:25:13] where he is the head
[2:25:15] hallelujah and all paul belongs to him
[2:25:18] they are subject to him
[2:25:21] as the members of our bodies are subject
[2:25:23] to our heads
[2:25:25] [Applause]
[2:25:28] so all wife could be a bullhead not
[2:25:30] subject to your husband and be right in
[2:25:31] that sense
[2:25:35] you're not subject yourself to the
[2:25:36] ministry that's why some people will
[2:25:38] jump from church to church they don't
[2:25:40] want to be under no subjection
[2:25:43] they want to be under no authority
[2:25:47] and to have authority you must be under
[2:25:49] authority
[2:25:51] god placed me here with authority
[2:25:54] but is only if you allow that authority
[2:25:56] to be over you
[2:26:08] authority
[2:26:09] that ministerial authority and govern
[2:26:11] people lies and run people lives we
[2:26:12] don't have that doctrine here
[2:26:14] we do have that teaching here
[2:26:16] i like freedom
[2:26:18] i love freedom i want you to be free and
[2:26:21] i must be free
[2:26:23] you could be free but i have to be free
[2:26:24] to tell you the truth
[2:26:26] you can be free and buy me
[2:26:28] is that working so
[2:26:32] it's not working so i have to be careful
[2:26:35] and walk on excels because i want to
[2:26:38] offend this one and offend that one it's
[2:26:40] not so you know
[2:26:42] this is friend or no friend you know
[2:26:44] i love god
[2:26:46] god first this message is first a lot of
[2:26:50] people fight with it
[2:26:51] wrestle with it because again i fight
[2:26:53] because cutting their behavior
[2:26:56] and their spirit and their attitude and
[2:26:57] they don't want to die
[2:26:59] some people love how they are that's why
[2:27:00] they are changing
[2:27:02] [Applause]

[2:27:05] whether you say abel are not coming
[2:27:07] through you know
[2:27:08] are coming through you know where do you
[2:27:10] say amen i don't need amen for that no
[2:27:12] some people are changing because they
[2:27:14] don't they don't want to change
[2:27:17] they love themselves
[2:27:19] they satisfy with themselves they're not
[2:27:22] hungry they're not thirsty they're not
[2:27:24] looking for a transformation they just
[2:27:25] come into church because it's a
[2:27:27] religious atmosphere that they're living
[2:27:29] in is a religious spirit upon them
[2:27:32] [Music]
[2:27:33] their amends means nothing to god
[2:27:35] they're worshiping nothing to god
[2:27:37] they're not sincere

[2:32:45] human beings always blaming somebody
[2:32:47] she is he is them is this everybody else
[2:32:50] but themselves
[2:32:52] i remember one time preaching when the
[2:32:54] presence of god came down isaiah said
[2:32:56] woe is them.
[2:32:59] when that person said isaiah as i said
[2:33:01] woe is me
[2:33:03] no man could commit a real presence
[2:33:07] and be arrogant
[2:33:08] and be indifferent
[2:33:10] and blame others you're coming to
[2:33:12] presence who is me oh god

[2:33:46] unworthy if god grace didn't keep me i'm
[2:33:50] gone
[2:33:51] it's not by your might it's not by your
[2:33:53] power it's by your spirit
[2:33:56] all right

[2:34:53] and when he think about you he was
