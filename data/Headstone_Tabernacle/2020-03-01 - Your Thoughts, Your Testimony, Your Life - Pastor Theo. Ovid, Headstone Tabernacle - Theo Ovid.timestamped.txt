[19:58] homage as our hearts desire it's just to
[20:01] point people to you have your way Lord
[20:03] in Jesus name and amen god bless you
[20:06] welcome this evening if their Bibles I'd
[20:08] like to take to portion of scripture
[20:09] proverbs chapter 23 verse 7 and send
[20:14] mocking 11:23 scripture reading
[20:20] / verbs 23
[20:24] for as heating gets in his heart so is
[20:26] he
[20:27] eatin drink see it he to thee but his
[20:31] heart is not with thee and for mark
[20:34] 11:23 savour verily I say unto you but
[20:37] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[20:39] be thou removed and be no cast into the
[20:42] sea and shall not doubt in his heart but
[20:44] shall believe that those things which he
[20:47] says shall come to pass he shall have
[20:50] whatsoever he saith may God bless his
[20:51] word you may be seated the continuation
[20:54] that same scripture is it was 24 it says
[20:57] therefore I said to you whatsoever
[20:59] things you desire when you pray you not
[21:01] speaking yet you just pray believe that
[21:04] you receive them and you shall have them
[21:06] so your believing that you get it before
[21:09] they get it we see believe that you
[21:11] shall receive them and you shall have
[21:14] them so that is really applying that
[21:17] prayer with faith believer is already
[21:20] done believe you have received it and
[21:22] you will receive it
[21:24] when you stand praying forgive if you
[21:27] have aught against any so that your
[21:29] father also which is in heaven may
[21:32] forgive you of your trespasses
[21:33] but if you do not forgive neither will
[21:34] your father which is in heaven forgive
[21:36] your trespasses
[21:37] so it has FG just give the tuple first
[21:40] second pull next and the football so you
[21:43] see if you cannot speak but before you
[21:46] speak you have to pray and before you
[21:49] pray you have to forgive if you want to
[21:53] be in speaking condition you have to
[21:55] start with forgiveness when you pray
[21:59] after believe is already done the show
[22:02] is faith and believing that it's already
[22:04] done well if you believe is already done
[22:06] then you can wish him then you could
[22:09] praise God because you believe in your
[22:11] heart is already done
[22:12] then you could come in to speak in terms
[22:14] speaking condition because the devil
[22:17] don't want you to come and speak in
[22:18] condition never want to say you're a
[22:20] mope and any press somewhat not devil I
[22:22] want you to speak speak your healing
[22:26] speak your breakthrough streak your
[22:29] besan you don't want your speaking but
[22:30] you have to speak it because you see God
[22:32] Hawk was to speak it he said let there
[22:35] be light let there be a earth let us
[22:38] make man God at the speaker themself and
[22:40] we are sons of God we have to come in to
[22:42] speak in terms so it's not just God want
[22:44] you to hear hear hear go over here and
[22:46] converted to speak or glory to God so as
[22:50] a man thing in his heart so is he
[22:52] you have to think it a certain today of
[22:55] a title your thoughts your testimony
[22:58] your life
[22:59] your thoughts your testimony your life
[23:04] Baram says watch this he says that the
[23:10] human being was not metal lying lying is
[23:14] a deceitful Harting it's a evil thing
[23:18] I'd rather have a drunkard with me any
[23:21] day than a liar you're not a drunkard a
[23:23] motor smell
[23:28] I wait think about that now alaya could
[23:31] have good cologne and perfume in ER but
[23:34] drunkard smelling a liquor and he said
[23:36] he rather have a drunkard with him than
[23:39] a liar
[23:44] so if you put the lie detector on the
[23:46] person it will register negative every
[23:48] time because the human was not metal eye
[23:51] line is deceitful evil thing I rather
[23:54] have a drunkard me a liar a liar and
[23:56] your body wasn't me to lie so if it Eve
[24:00] something L said you see that no I did
[24:03] you can see it slow is the lion the
[24:06] machine was a ping ping ping lie lie lie
[24:08] lie like the machine will register lie
[24:10] because it picks up the subconscious
[24:13] level
[24:14] not yet conscious the subconscious level
[24:17] then what it picks up register on the
[24:19] machine is that right so listen is part
[24:21] so no matter how sinful you are you are
[24:24] still a fall Son of God the most sinful
[24:30] person in this city today God didn't
[24:33] intend you to be sinful he wanted you to
[24:36] be a son or daughter you made up the you
[24:38] are mirror in his own makeup but sinners
[24:41] caused you to do that and no matter how
[24:43] much you try to impersonate and try to
[24:45] make a lie see right they got scientific
[24:47] instrument to prove its wrong you can
[24:50] tell it with all the innocence you want
[24:51] to it's still register negative because
[24:54] it's a subconscious dong in the human
[24:56] being and that subconscious knows what
[24:59] is the truth
[25:00] so this speaking thing now have to do
[25:02] with the Hat if you shall say to the
[25:06] mountain be move and don't doubt in your
[25:09] heart you can have what you said so what
[25:12] is also seen is this if you believe and
[25:14] is activated from the subconscious level
[25:16] you can have it
[25:20] because is not intellectual that is
[25:23] truth from the inward parts you believe
[25:26] it yourself
[25:27] let me scum now if you believe you could
[25:29] speak and you can be here you could get
[25:31] it yourself because that's that
[25:35] intellectual belief now that is a faith
[25:37] from Kemeny from the soul and this is
[25:41] where get it from the man dear for if a
[25:43] man or woman could ever get their
[25:46] thoughts and their testimonies and their
[25:50] lives so line up with God until the
[25:55] channel of the Holy Spirit would be
[25:57] perfectly one with God what would take
[25:59] place your thoughts your life your
[26:04] testimony and the Bible said it overcame
[26:06] him my what by the word of their
[26:08] testimony and the blood of the Lamb you
[26:11] overcome by what the word of their
[26:13] testimony and your testimony is your
[26:14] confession what you come out your mode
[26:17] what you come out your Mochis your
[26:19] testimony you will all have that
[26:21] testimony and God want you to speak it
[26:24] or glory the can hold it in your head
[26:26] it have to come out of that testimony I
[26:28] believe God will heal me I have you over
[26:30] streaming I becau go and seal me I be
[26:34] God God will deliver my family that's
[26:35] your testimony come and give a testimony
[26:38] tonight I believe God will deliver me
[26:39] everyone will free me I will call the
[26:42] anointing of all gonna super than my
[26:44] house I believe everyone in that house
[26:46] will be delivered that's my testimony
[26:48] that's my confession and he's the high
[26:51] priests of your confession
[26:53] he cannot intercede unless you confess
[26:54] it you have to confess that you have it
[26:57] you have to believe it and pray fair be
[26:59] unbelieving receive it before you
[27:01] receive it and if you believe it and you
[27:04] receive it and you believe it will get
[27:05] it you're gonna praise God for it they
[27:08] will listen like a mope
[27:09] he will settle any pressure on the feet
[27:11] you would worship God because Abraham
[27:13] staggered not at the promise of God
[27:15] through unbelief but for strong in faith
[27:18] giving glory to God and he didn't see
[27:21] Isaac yet in reality or give the Lord
[27:25] some praises
[27:26] he had Isaac my revelation in the socket
[27:30] of a soul it was so real yet he couldn't
[27:33] show searing it because she needed the
[27:35] same revelation to get down inside a
[27:37] system
[27:37] and God didn't talk to Sarah so I exact
[27:40] Abraham at something that Sarah did not
[27:43] have Oh glory to go that's why he could
[27:46] start not at the promise that's why he
[27:48] could be along with Sarah that's why he
[27:50] can understand your frustration her
[27:53] depression upset and dumbshit or give
[27:55] the Lord some praises or glory to God
[27:59] and when you get revelation like that
[28:01] you will understand your family
[28:02] condition they can see what you see you
[28:05] try to tell them tell them it have to be
[28:07] revealed or chlorine or qualities divine
[28:11] revelation and when that revelation
[28:13] strike them nothing will take that out
[28:15] or glow because yourself on this rock
[28:18] I'll build my church and the case of El
[28:20] Cap prevail against that that is when
[28:22] revelation break upon your soul and
[28:25] you'll give your mother backslide your
[28:26] father back where your husband backs
[28:28] like to fight back like you will not
[28:30] backslide because of Revelation has
[28:32] brick upon your very soul Oh glory to
[28:37] God passed on or pasta church or no
[28:40] church
[28:41] Daniel survived Shadrach Meshach and
[28:44] Abednego a survive David survived all
[28:47] the onshore from shore you gonna survive
[28:50] or god one of all the caves and intense
[28:55] destitute and afflicted of whom the
[28:57] world was not worthy
[29:01] hallelujah and they obtained a good

[44:03] let me wrap up
[44:05] Oh
[44:07] many people come to the altar to be
[44:09] prayed for they have intellectual feet
[44:11] they confess their sins and join a
[44:12] church my intellectual feet they believe
[44:14] it in their heart they're mine they
[44:16] believe it they could hear it they
[44:17] believe it because it knows the best
[44:18] policy but that's not what God looks for
[44:21] he don't look at your intellectual faith
[44:23] so if you have 99% intellectual faith
[44:26] and point one percent enjoy give Rick a
[44:28] hot feet God look I do 1 1 percent in
[44:32] you only one percent Rick tional Oh
[44:34] hallelujah have 99 percent fellowship in
[44:37] 99 percent discussion 99 percent
[44:41] understanding but praise God what the
[44:43] most important faith that's why you
[44:45] don't have to be even educated because
[44:49] education is up here but Revelation is
[44:52] down here
[44:53] that's right peace alone can be ignorant
[44:55] and unlearned you can have a doctorate
[44:57] and a degree up here but it's how much I
[44:59] have down here we thought almost Kazim
[45:02] and money if he had money is my money
[45:03] I'd wanted to the temple think about
[45:06] that now that's why is there no money if
[45:10] he had money all the years I'm going to
[45:15] implant in service normal normal

[45:19] nothing but even for himself he said
[45:22] this a right I had to give him an
[45:24] something I have nothing I have no money
[45:26] to give him but I have something what I
[45:29] have Sylvan goal didn't buy that money
[45:31] didn't pay for that what I have I could
[45:33] give this a price up and walk in the
[45:35] name of Jesus Christ if I do our money
[45:37] or power
[45:38] I do our money I've hurt you I'd want
[45:40] money of the life of Christ I had no
[45:42] money of the anointed one more money but
[45:45] I have the faith that was once delivered

[49:31] it's a few minutes ago he doesn't look
[49:34] at your intellectual feet so I was happy
[49:37] I believe I believe I believe and I
[49:40] believe is a big big balloon on the
[49:43] intellectual side looking real big it
[49:44] was a good topic at the rich plenty and
[49:49] I'm so carried even before kinetochore
[49:52] cutting up simple allocation to apply
[49:57] the blood and Moses there was an
[49:58] application for exotic plant life that
[50:01] to put on it to put on any blood you
[50:03] know it was his Sofia to put it when
[50:07] they kill the lamb and take the blood
[50:08] what was the blood shall be applied so
[50:12] you can say I have a bucket of blood
[50:14] here boy
[50:20] you die with your bucket of blood
[50:23] because God has a walk with no bucket of
[50:26] blood no bucket that's for hornbooks
[50:28] when I look at that tapes he said take
[50:30] the blood and put it on the doorpost put
[50:34] it on the side post and when I see the
[50:37] blood not in the bucket
[50:41] [Music]
[50:43] should have a place inside out here come
[50:47] on I'll give the Lord a shout never
[50:49] places have your heart where the blood
[50:52] must be applied or glory to God God must
[50:55] hear not the pastor Matt the bishop God
[50:58] must see it inside a heart but in Moses
[51:07] time everybody can see it and everybody
[51:10] go sit upon YouTube because they will
[51:12] see that you are playing what you're
[51:13] hearing to door your life so that will
[51:17] bring your testimony on your life and
[51:18] line up all the time you say it about
[51:25] this but when you begin to apply what
[51:28] you believe then that makes a whole
[51:30] difference altogether that bucket
[51:32] identify you're ready to leave but this
[51:34] why you kill the lamb that is why you
[51:36] have the blood but no you have to apply
[51:38] what you believe even then is not good
[51:41] enough you have to apply what you
[51:43] believe when you take the blood and put
[51:45] it on the doorpost of the whole show
[51:47] just pitch white you just spend all your
[51:53] money - here's your host right and God
[51:55] said put the blood and if you're
[51:59] miserable you might want them like to
[52:01] learn bloody but Jase you want to live
[52:03] you will put that okay look like right
[52:10] bloody coronavirus right all right
[52:12] people right then go in panic mode
[52:14] actually panic move yet but it's wrong
[52:18] it's coming but he said come not near

[1:12:43] [Applause]
[1:12:46] [Music]
[1:12:46] [Applause]
[1:12:54] then the human element goes out and the
[1:12:57] Spirit of God fills a vacancy
[1:12:59] where you empty yourself then will be
[1:13:02] when the church in its power of the
[1:13:03] resurrection of the Lord Jesus will walk
[1:13:05] in his steps in his power in his
[1:13:08] thoughts in his being you see what I
[1:13:10] mean then your torch will become words
[1:13:12] your words will become material that is
[1:13:15] when the church in its power I believe
[1:13:17] it's on this road when the church will
[1:13:19] be so wrapped in Christ not politics not
[1:13:23] in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind's so
[1:13:26] away from themselves they don't see
[1:13:28] themselves their thoughts is just a self
[1:13:30] God their thoughts move on they refuse
[1:13:33] the things of the world they just move
[1:13:35] in the spirit here we go
[1:13:36] live in the spirit move in the spirit
[1:13:39] walk in the spirit so fulfill the law of
[1:13:41] Christ then the love of Christ in the
[1:13:44] human heart moving in the Holy Ghost
[1:13:46] that great wonderful church will go
[1:13:49] forth with power and deity because deity
[1:13:52] will be revealed in human beings yeah
[1:13:55] what by the holy spirit bringing to pass
[1:13:58] that thought of their mind deity which
[1:14:02] is God will be revealed human beings how
[1:14:06] by talk no by the Holy Spirit
[1:14:10] bringing the past the thought of their
[1:14:13] mind unfinished
[1:14:16] so when Peter came at the man at the
[1:14:19] gate called beautiful and he couldn't
[1:14:22] give me man money because in half you

[1:14:27] but you knew what he had so he says the
[1:14:30] van goal I don't have such as I have I
[1:14:33] give it that was the thought in his mind
[1:14:35] he knew what the man need us the money
[1:14:39] is a walk you know what he said rise up
[1:14:42] and walk in the name of Jesus Christ
