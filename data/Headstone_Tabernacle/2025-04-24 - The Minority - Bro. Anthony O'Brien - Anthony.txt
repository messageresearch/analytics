And if you have your Bibles, we'll just read a portion of Psalms here from the Psalm 98. Psalm 98 and verse one. And it says, "Oh, sing unto the Lord a new song, for he hath done marvelous things. His right hand and his holy arm hath gotten him the victory. The Lord hath made known his salvation, his righteousness hath he openly shued in the sight of the heathen. He hath remembered his mercy, and his truth towards the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. Make a joyful noise unto the Lord. All the earth, make a loud noise, and rejoice and sing praise. Sing unto the Lord with the harp, with the hop and the voice of a psalm, with trumpets and sound of cornet. Make a joyful noise before the Lord the King. Let the sea roar and the fullness thereof, the world and they that dwell therein. Let the floods clap their hands. Let the hills be joyful together before the Lord, for he cometh to judge the earth with righteousness. Shall he judge the world and the people with equity? May God add his blessings upon his holy word tonight. Let us bow our heads. Almighty God, we are thankful to be in your presence there, God. Father, Lord, Lord, uh better is a day night courts, Lord, than a thousand elsewhere tonight. Lord, we thankful to be in your house, Lord, to be found in your grace, Lord Jesus. Lord, and we just surrender ourselves now to the moving of the spirit, Lord. Lord, and we pray Lord that as this service begins, Lord, and as we sing praises unto your name and we invite your presence amongst us, Lord, that you would come and minister to our hearts, Lord, and bless us and help us, Father, along the way. Give us a word in due season, dear God. Give us a praise upon our lips there, Lord, Father, for all the marvelous things that you have done, Lord. We come to uh just get in the spirit of the coming of the Lord, Lord, and to and to worship you and to and to and to praise you for your promises that will soon unfold. Bless your people tonight.

And as we get ready to switch over to service tonight, God richly bless you. We want God to speak amongst us tonight. Amen. And we pray that this will be his will. Amen. Well, praise God. Uh certainly happy to be in the house once more. If you have your Bibles, let's turn to a portion of scriptures. We want to read from the word of God. One portion of scripture we have for our um praise God. our little message tonight and it's taken from 1st Chronicles chapter 16. We'd like to read from verse 15 to 22 inclusive. So that's 1 Chronicles chapter 16 we'd like to read from and uh at this portion of the scripture we see David and uh he is uh reciting this a psalm before the Lord and before the ark of the covenant and just in the prior chapter we would read where David dances before the ark and it finally comes into view and they are worshiping and celebrating God and his testimony before the people. As we know, God is a God of testimony. And David is giving testimony in this psalm of how he had brought them out uh of a mighty long way and made them a peculiar people, a chosen people for his name's sake. And here's what it says. 1 Chron 1 Chronicles chapter 16 verse 15. It says, "Be mindful always of his covenant, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations." Now, of course, this can also be found in Psalms 105. It's the same Psalm, but we wanted to take into the context of David here and his his praise that he's giving to God for for recognition for what God has done for his people. Amen. Verse 16 says, "Even of the covenant which he had made with Abraham, Amen. and of his oath unto Isaac. Hallelujah. And hath confir confirmed the saint uh to Jacob for a law and to Israel for an everlasting covenant, saying unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance, when ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it. And then they went from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people. He suffered no man to do them wrong. Yay. He reproved kings for their sakes, saying, "Touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm." May God add blessing to the reading of his his holy word. Let's just bow our heads one more time. Almighty God, we are happy to be in your presence, Lord. We feel honored, Lord, that that we could come at your feet, Lord, and hear what you would have to speak to us tonight. Lord, we just prayed out that you take me out of the way, Father. Take everything out, Lord, that you don't want. Flush it out, kick it out, Lord, dear God. You put in there only what you what your will is tonight, Father. What you once said, oh God, we just surrender to your mighty will, Father. There's none like you in all the earth. And we look to you now. Our eyes are upon you, Lord Jesus. what you would speak to us, Lord. What you would say to us, Father. Your at thy word, Lord, we would go as you command, Father, tonight. May you anoint your word and inspire it. Breathe life into it as only you can do, dear God. And help us tonight for we are much need of thee, Lord. Inspire us, Lord. Inspire us to pray. Inspire us to action. Whatever your will is tonight, Lord, we just pray that you come and have your way tonight with us and in us in Jesus Christ's precious name. Amen. And amen. You may be seated. Hallelujah. Okay. Wonderful. Well, it's good to be here. Amen. Amen. And uh we thank God for his grace. So tonight, just have a message of encouragement for you. And I know we're coming out of the Easter weekend which we had such a tremendous time and again we thank God for what he has done among us. Amen. We are grateful to God. Amen. Praise God and certainly appreciate all the helps and governments that helped it make it possible. and uh you know just we couldn't do it alone. Amen. Uh we need all the help we can get and so everyone putting their shoulder to the wheel. Such a real blessing and we thank God for all of us and all of you and as we continue in the in the in the uh in the Christian way. Amen. Let us uh continue to serve where we can. Amen. Hallelujah. Well, praise God tonight. So, I have a thought and certainly want to uh and this just was whispered to me just during the weekend. something whispered to me and the the title of it was the minority. The minority. And so I I only got recently be able to put pen to paper for this and uh this is how it came out here tonight. So just trust in the Lord that he would fill in the blanks and uh help us tonight to bring this out in a way that would be encouragement to your heart. But this is the title I have tonight. It's what what I just got by the grace of God, the minority. And um and I like to start with my key objective. And tonight we want to prove and show how God has always worked with and will continue to work with a minority to bring his word to pass. Amen. I believe throughout the ages we could see a pattern emerging out of the scripture. Yes, sir. And there's many places where brother Brandham talks about that minority group, that little group that God's going to call out in the last day and so powerfully anoint them and shake the whole world with them. uh that is undeni undeniable at this point that that this is what the reality of the scripture is showing us that uh the glory of the crowd and the beauty that the world puts on great and enormous things um is not where God's mindset is at all when we consider the end times. As a matter of fact, while I was reading the scripture just now, I don't know if you could see it, but but but even in this scripture, we could see how God was glorifying that little church down there in the book of Acts. Few in number, but he suffered no man to do them wrong. They were few in number, but he reproved kings for their sakes. Touch not mine anointed. Do my prophets no harm. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. God will not take you out before your time. You will stand there for a testimony and let the whole world know that he is real. That God is alive. That he still heals the sick. That he still raises the dead. That he is still the greatest power that this world has ever known and will ever known. And by and through the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised in the book. Isn't that right? Praise God. Hallelujah. So, it's all happening in a minority. It's a very it's a very paradoxical thing. It's a very strange thing. Uh and God has a way of doing that because because God always wants to do opposite to what man is doing. That's the best way he can show how much of God he is. Anytime man's mind is in a certain direction, usually God is in a completely opposite direction of thinking from where man is. And that is how God finds a way to hide himself in his agenda because he is doing it in a way that man does not expect and man is not looking for God. And that's exactly where God is. Isn't that right? you know and uh and how this thought come to me. I was thinking of how great God is. He is mighty. He is powerful. He is vast. You know, if you take this building, this floor plan and multiply it a million times that way and multiply it a million times in this direction and in this direction and in this direction, you still couldn't contain God. He's still outside of that. Uh there's no house that you could build for him. There's there's no place that you can contain him in. He's just greater than anything you've ever known. The finger of God can shift galaxies. And in those galaxies are billions of stars. And in those galaxies are millions of planets. Planets that might look just like this one. But somehow in all of those millions of planets, God chose this planet to move in and to create and to and to put man in and to look after and to glor be glorified in to manifest himself to and make himself known to oh the wonders of God. He is great and powerful. He is above all things, all planets, all galaxies. Our mind can't even begin to fathom. uh when we go out beyond our universe, it it begins to get very blurry for us. Uh the math and the science is just is not not enough. They move in quantum leaps. Uh it's humanly impossible to reach that far. And yet beyond that point, God is there. Beyond a point that you don't even can't even calculate anymore, God is there in all of this vastness. Amen. In all of this greatness, in all of this omnipotence, and yet with all this greatness that God is, yet with all of this power that God has, yet with all this omnipotence and all this omniscence that he is, there's one thing about God that still astounds the people today. And it is this, that God has always shown a keen interest in little things. Amen. As big as he is and as powerful as he is, as as glorious as he is, he somehow has always found a keen interest in little things. He's always found a keen interest in simple things. Even though the decree of God goes out, even though the love of God covers everything, he takes care of every little detail. Right in that grace, right in the measure of his love, encoded in his love is him, his care for you and for me and for every bird in the in the air and every beast of the field and every fish in the sea and everything is taken care of. Hallelujah. When you go down into the depths of it, into the details of it, yet at the blanket statement we could say God loves us and his love covers the world. But when we go drill down deeper, we see love over here. We see love in a blade of grass. We see love in the petal of a flower. We see love in the wings of a butterfly. We see love in the laugh of a baby. God is interested. He is encoded. He is in involved in every little thing. The little details about our lives that that if we look closely enough, we'll see God because God love you so much. He wouldn't let harm come to you. He loved you so much that he took care of you even when you weren't looking. He took care of you when you weren't paying attention. He was looking out for you to make sure that you could come to your time. That you could come to your season. That you could come to your day of fruition. That no weapon formed against you will prosper. God made sure. The Bible said he set his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways unless you dash thy foot against a stone. God loves you so much that he doesn't want your foot to dash against a stone. And that's just us here tonight. Think about the thousands and millions of people just like you that he is also taking care of. Uh but he knows it all and he's in control of it all. Amen. Yet he loves it all. Even the littlest thing. Even the smallest thing. Isn't that right? Every member of the body is important to God. Even brother Bannon was making that reference that I wouldn't want to lose my little toe. I wouldn't want to lose my little finger. I may not use it much, but I don't want to lose it. It belongs to me. It's a it's a part of me. Uh uh it's precious to me. And if I could keep it, I would. I would keep it. Praise God. As long as I could. And that's the way God feels about every little part of the body. To some people, it may not feel significant. To some people, it may not feel like something that's great. Praise God. Amen. Or glorious. To some people, it might just be a fiveminute ministry. But no matter how short it might seem, no matter how insignificant you might feel, you are very important to God, doesn't matter how small the world makes it out to appear, it is still very important to God because he is interested in every little thing. He's interested in every little personal because they all play a part, a vital and key role in the economy of God. and how things move and how things happen and everyone has a contribution to make. Amen. Isn't that right? So with even with all this greatness, see, he's still interested in the little things. He's always found pleasure and worked with and hid himself in those very little things. Hallelujah. What God calls wise, man calls foolish. And what God calls foolish is called the wisdom of men. Isn't that right? And human beings by nature we are usually in awe of great things. We are in awe of vastness of something that is great or big or enormous. Uh we live in a world where they're always trying to do the next big thing. Isn't that right? We are greatly impressed by it. Everyone thought the Empire State Building was one of the biggest, most to power powerful, biggest towering uh uh buildings in the world at that time when it was built, I guess, in the 1930s or whatever. Until they built something bigger than that until now, the biggest building is not even in America. It's now in Dubai. It's called the Burj Khalifa. The tallest building in the world. And and they just keep going taller and taller and taller. Isn't that right? And bigger. Isn't that right? Man is usually in in awe of greatness. Greatness tends to overwhelm us. We want the biggest houses. We want to drive the biggest cars. We want to swim in the biggest swimming pools, own the biggest yachts, build the biggest stadiums, build the tallest massive tower, build the biggest mall. Isn't that right? More and more shopping, more commerce, more industry. When we think of God as great as well, we should. But whenever God wants to do something, especially when he wants to do it in secret, he hides it in something very simple. He hides it in something so humble that you would pass by you if you're not looking for it. Hallelujah. It would just bump you on the street and keep on going. There goes a man that God can use. So simple, but yet so great and so powerful. All the big distractions of the world could get you caught up in the spirit of that and miss and see what God is doing today right among the people. You could miss what God is doing right among us if you're not in the spirit of it to see what God sees. Amen. Praise God. It's not right. But we're here to see what God sees tonight. God wants to fix our eyes upon Jesus Christ. He wants to fix our mind to let the same mind that was in Christ be in us. That we could love the way he loves. That we could forgive the way he forgives. That we could see each other the way God sees us. That God is with the little person. He's with the big person. He's with the medium shot. He's with the rich and the famous. He's with the homeless and everybody in between. Because at the end of the day, we are all God's children. and he still loves all of us the same. And no matter what your bank account looks like or what kind of shoes you're wearing or or what kind of social status you've got, God still loves you. And God wants to put that love in our hearts that we could reflect him. When we live and we act and do amen. Amen. We could reflect God. I believe that's the purpose. And Barham said, "Eternal life is living for others." And that's what we want to be tonight. Amen. Amen. The prophet said, "Hey, God keeps his word." The church of God has always been in the minority. Until Jesus comes, he said, "Fear not, little flock. It's your father's goodwill to give you the kingdom." That's right. We are in the minority. He said, "But that's all right. As long as God is there, it's still a majority to me. He said, "And I know it is to you. For if God is with you, then who can be against you?" Many, many men. So, if you're in the minority tonight, that's all right. As long as God is there, you're still in the majority. Even if you're in the minority because God makes up the rest. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Where the twos and trees are gathered, there he is in the midst. Where the twos and trees are gathered, as long as he is there, he can fill the void. Do you need healing? He can be the healer. Right in that minority. He can be the sealer. He can be the deliverer. He can be the restorer. He can be the reclaimer. He can be the baptizer. He can raise you up. Oh, he can become something. when the when the opportunity is presented for him to become something in that environment. And I believe that's the beauty of the minority. Hallelujah. Most times the people are just in a certain mindset. They they they're not great in number. They are not looking for numbers to win the battle. Uh because if they look to numbers, they will fail. If they look to their own resources or their own power or their own skill sets, it's just a few of them. what can they do? And when they turn their eyes towards God, when they begin to turn their eyes towards the Lord and say, "Lord, we don't have enough. We need more. We need something or else we're not going to make it." Then in that desperation, God can now reach down and fill a need that is there. But when the numbers are there, people get more confident in their numbers. They get more confident in their ability to raise funds. If each one of us throw $50, we could raise enough funds to do this. and we could do enough to do that. And they have the money and the financial backing and the social status and they have favor and people in high places. But when you don't have much to work with, that's when Jesus becomes your everything. When you don't have a lot to go on, that's when he becomes your all in all. When you run out of things to do, when you run out of things to say, when you run out of ways to help yourself, when you run out of money and the doctors don't have an answer, that's when he becomes everything because you recognize how much of a nothing you are and how much of God you need. The world needs to come back into that place. They ever want to find God again. Amen. They have to turn away from all this science and civilization and technology that they have hinged their lives upon and they have to begin to rest their souls upon Christ in order to see a real difference. Amen. Many are called but but few are chosen to do that. Blessed are you tonight. Happy are you tonight. You are chosen by God to see what you see and to hear what you hear. That your heart could be allowed to be convicted. to turn the corner and to turn your eyes upon Jesus. Amen. We are a blessed people tonight. Amen. Praise God. So, and so there's something called the herd mentality. I don't know if you or the herd instinct. I don't know if you know about it. Um but it's something that's built into your DNA as a human being. It's a natural response. Whenever we see a large crowd of people going or standing in a particular direction or they're doing something, usually it causes an attraction to you, the individual. You see a large crowd like the one there is tonight down by the rally. Yeah. Look all looking in this direction to see what's taking place over there. What's all this noise about? What all the music about? You know, what's all these crowds of people about? And usually it draws the attention away. You know, uh uh uh people want to know what's going on down there. Uh there are social experiments. There are social experiments, I'm sure on the internet, maybe YouTube, you might have seen them where they would get a a whole crowd of people, like about 100 people, like a mass crowd, and they would just do this experiment where they would get them to run down a street, you know, and just to see what people will do, what what their response would be. Nine times out of 10, the people would look in the direction the crowd is running away from to see what they're running away from. And then they might run along with the crowd. Even if they don't know what's happening, they're still running with them. Amen. And this is something that is just encoded in us as people because we tend to follow the crowd. We tend to go with the crowd even if we don't have a reasonable explanation for what's happening, why people are running, why people are shouting. Uh but we just do it. It's something we do. We we as human beings, we are drawn to the crowd. Whether it's out of fear or whe it's out of excitement or whatever it is, we are drawn to it. Isn't that right? And I can only imagine how the crowd was when Jesus was was being accused of uh uh uh this crime that he said he'd committed. Uh and they brought him out before the people and they said, "Who do you want uh uh to lead uh uh to be uh set free? Do do you want this Jesus praise of Nazareth or do you want uh called the king of the Jews or do you want Barabus? Praise God. Isn't that right? And they began to say, "Give us Barabus. Give us Barabus." And the whole crowd went after them. Sure, it probably was a few angry Pharisees who started up the crowd, but pretty soon everybody got on the train and started shouting, "Give us Barabus. Give us Barabus." 90% of them don't even know what they're saying. Amen. But they are but they are they are they are slowly but surely finding themselves in the throngs of of evil and death uh because they are denying Jesus Christ in that moment and they are exonerating a murderer uh they exonerating a criminal as it were and no wonder can Jesus could come while he was on the cross and say father forgive them for they know not what they do. There's a lot of people tonight that are following the crowd and they don't know what they're actually doing. There's a lot of people that are following the crowd tonight that are running to the people in droves where the people are, where the crowds are, where the noise is. Hallelujah. They are going and trying to do what they think is supposed to be right, what they think is instinctually right. And yet they don't know what they are doing tonight. Many of them are lost. Many of them are misguided. Many of them don't have a leader. Many of them are running and going uh hellbound into hell. Isn't that right? Praise God. They're running. They're breaking all of the red lights, going straight to hell, following the crowd. When Jesus said, "Straight is a gate and narrow is the way. Few there be that find it." Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And that word straight doesn't mean a straight gate like a straight line, but it's something peculiar. It's something you'll miss if you're not looking for it. You'll miss that turn if you're not looking out for the gate, praise God, that leads to righteousness. There are very few that are going to go out there. But I'm so happy tonight that God tapped us each on the shoulder. And while we were heading in the crowd, while we were chipping down the road, while we were hellbound, someone tapped us on the shoulder and said, "Have you noticed the straight gate on your left?" Oh, hallelujah. Why don't you come aside with me? I want to show you something. I want to reveal something. I want to tell you something that you you have heard before because before the foundation of the world, there was a seed inside your soul. You don't know that now, but you knew it then. And when the sons of God were sen together, you were there in the beginning. You were there before the beginning. Oh, hallelujah. And God wants to reconnect with you and take you through that straight gate. Pass you through that narrow way. That narrow way that leads to repentance. That narrow way that leads to salvation. That narrow way that leads to forgiveness. That narrow way where men pow before the feet of God. When men go through the desert, go through the wilderness with God and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost. That narrow way that changes you. That narrow way that transforms you. That narrow way that burns all the filth, burns all the muck, burns all the evil out of your life, puts forgiveness in your soul, puts charity in your heart. It's a narrow way. Oh, it's a road less traveled. But it's a road we got to take tonight. It's a road that leads to Calvary. It's a road that leads to the cross. It's a road that leads to our debt. It's a road that leads to our burning, to our sacrifice. And then a crown would be laid up for you when you pay that price. Amen. And amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. So we don't want to be doing the natural inclination cuz that's just human nature. See, following the crowd, what it gives us a sense of security, a sense of community, a sense of belonging that you naturally would like. That's something you want, you know, and the devil knows that. He knows you want to feel like you belong somewhere. And so he presents the crowd as an idea, as something to follow. Look how many people there is. You know, it can't be wrong if there are so many [Music] people. Huh? Nobody goes by the doubles man who hardly have anybody standing next to him. Everybody want to follow the crowd. I have to be tasting good if there's so many people at his stand and there's none on the other side. I think I'll go where the people are cuz it sounds like look like he have the taste. Isn't that right? And the devil is like this. He He's like the candyman. He makes the world taste good and he has the crowd going cutting the price in half. Keep them coming. Isn't that right? Praise God. But it's death. People say this is life. Brothers used to say it, you know, people say that's how life is. No, that's death. That's how death is. They calling it life, but it's really death. Disguised as a crowd, as an attraction. Praise God. But God has a different attraction tonight. A oh so humble attraction, a peculiar attraction, but it's his attraction tonight. Amen. And it's attraction of his word. And that's what we want to follow tonight. Amen. It's nothing that anybody would desire in themselves, but it's something God put in our hearts to reveal to us. And it give us a gladness, a joy, a wonder, an amazement when his revelation pours down in you. Amen. Amen. All of a sudden, begin to do things that people don't normally do. You begin to follow the lesser crowd that people wouldn't normally follow. But it's because God has influenced your life and you're doing something very, very different. Praise God. Hallelujah. Isn't that right? Praise God. Amen. So, so, so that's that's what goes on. The crowd doesn't make it right. Isn't that right? Following the crowd where the purpose is wrong, if you follow a crowd where the purpose is wrong, then the crowd is wrong, too. Following that crowd doesn't make you right. If the purpose is wrong, isn't that right? Isn't that right? So, so, so, uh, it's about the objective. It's about what we're trying to achieve. And it's about who or what is leading that crowd. It's about who or what is leading that audience. Where they are pointing the people to. Nothing wrong with a crowd if the objective is right. That's right. If the purpose is right. There was a big crowd following around Jesus. He was the only one who could heal them. Sure, there's a time for a crowd then. Praise God. But even in that crowd, there are chosen few who really have faith to pull from Jesus the things that they really want to get. So, it's still not about the crowd so much, but it's about the individuals in the crowd. And that's who God works with. He always works with individuals who have a personal revelation, who have a personal understanding. And that is what can work the things of God. That is what can tug on the heartstrings of God because they see something. They see God in the midst of all that is happening in the natural or whatever it is, but they could see something that's real. There it's almost like they could grab God's arm in spite everybody's they can't look around. They look around. They can't see God anywhere. But these people to whom the word is revealed have a revelation. They could see God in every little thing. Praise God. Amen. They don't take prayer for granted. They don't take praise for granted. They don't take church for granted. They don't take worship for granted. No. Everything to them is an opportunity to get through the door. They didn't come by chance. They didn't come to occupy a space. They didn't come to take up time. No, no, no. They didn't come to waste. No, no, no. They come to get something from the Lord. And that is who God could work it. That is the kind of faith that shakes God. That'll shake him and bring him on the scene. Praise God. And that's the kind of people he wants today. When the Son of Man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth? Faith that moves God into action. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's what we need tonight. A faith like we never known before. Amen. An anointed faith. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. So, nothing wrong with the crown, but it all depends on where it's leading them. See, and what they're trying to actually achieve. Isn't that right? And there's an argument that says that uh the Roman Catholic Church and it's just so funny that the the last pope has just passed away. They've been going through transition. Isn't that right? And uh you see the millions of people coming to see the body and the go flying to Rome. Is that right? To to see what's happening out there, to see the death of this pope and to mourn and so forth. And when you just look at it, it's amazing. millions of people around the world, different places, North America, South America, Latin America, you know, Europe, Asia, they come from everywhere, you know, and uh and uh it's amazing. And they and they say, well, look at the Roman Catholic Church. Some people might say we follow the Roman Catholic Church. One maybe because they're one of the oldest religions in the world. It's an argument people like to make. Praise God. They've been around a long time, so they must know what they're doing. Another argument they make is because they have so many members across the world, so many prominent people in society are devoted Catholics. Surely there must be something right about it if so many people are following in it. But that's not how God thinks. That's not how God acts. He don't need a crowd. He doesn't need a big religion. God works with individuals tonight. Isn't that right? Praise God. Let's take up a story. God calls Noah. Isn't that right? Amen. In Genesis 6 and 1, it says, "And it come to pass when men begin to multiply on the face of the earth." Look at the condition in that antidian age, the world was multiplying at a rapid pace. I don't know how many children there were per family, but it was getting kind of out of hand. Isn't that right? And the line of Lemch was coming to its end. Noah and his family was almost the last of it. Isn't that right? And God calls Noah and he said, "Come to pass when the men begin to multiply upon the face of the earth and the and daughters were born unto them." The Bible said, "The sons of God saw that the daughters of men were fear and they took to them wives which he had all chose. And the Lord said, "My spirit shall not always strive with man. For he also is flesh, and yet his day shall be 120 years." Amen. So God already set a time limit for when this thing is going to run up to. It's not going to run into your year 121. No, no, no, no. They're going to be a different world at year 121. Isn't that right? Praise God. 120 years. That is the border that man cannot pass as far as the antilian world is concerned. Isn't that right? My and verse four, it said there were giants in the earth in those days. And also after that, when the sons of God came into the daughters of men, they bare children unto them, and they became mighty men were old and men of renown and so forth. And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thought of their heart was only evil continually. Oh my, what a condition. Amen. More people, more problems, more situation, more evil. Isn't that right? And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart. And the Lord said, I will destroy man who I have created from the face of the earth, both man and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air, for it repented me that I have made them. But Noah, verse 8, found grace in the eyes of the Lord. Oh, hallelujah. God found grace in one man. One man called Noah. And that man represented his family. Oh, hallelujah. Noah and his family, glory to God, found grace in the eyes of God. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. What a picture tonight. Oh, I can only imagine God looked down at the earth now and God is looking for hearts who would serve him, who would love him in this untoward and wicked generation. There's so much evil, so much technology, so much this and so much that. Pray the people kick God out. They kick him out of their homes. Kick him out of society. Kick him out of the church. Kick him out of America. God is on the door knocking. Oh, hallelujah. Open somebody would open the door. And yet in all of that, God has found a people tonight. God has found you tonight. Individuals that he could veil himself in. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. You might look like much, but you will have God inside of your flesh, inside of your hands, inside of your feet. You might be few in number, but touch not my anointed. Do my prophets no harm. Oh, God's going to have his anointed ones in the end time. They're going to heal the sick. They're going to raise the dead. They're going to cast out devils. They're going to walk with power. They might look like much. Humble women, simple men, but God will fail in you. The mighty God that created the earth will be speaking through your lips and out of it will flash like lightning. Rainbow glory. Oh h whatever you say will be bats because you'll be adopted and perfected and set in the book of life. Oh hallelujah. And out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water. Somebody give the Lord a shout of praise. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Applause] Oh, revive us once more. God will have a church full of the Holy Ghost. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. He'll do it. Oh, hallelujah. He can do it in one year. All that they failed to do in thousands years, in a thousand years, God could do it. Hallelujah. In less than no time. Amen. Praise God. Cuz he's God. That's what he can do. Amen. Noah found grace in the eyes of God. That's wonderful. And we found grace in his eyes tonight. Isn't that wonderful? He said, "These are the generations of Noah." Noah's just a man perfect in his generations. And Noah walked with God. What a testimony. I believe that's what God wants to hear of you tonight. He walked with God. She She walked with God. Amen. enter Scotia Bank. She walked with God down the prominard. He walked with God in the ministry. In here, in there, they're walking with the Lord. Isn't that right? Praise God. Wherever you go, he went everywhere with them, confirming the word with signs, wonders, and miracles. Amen. Verse 10. And Noah begat three sons, Shem, and Jeepth. And the earth was so corrupt before God that the earth was filled with violence. So many people, so many hands should come before me. The earth is filled with violence through them.
