[1:03:58] taken place but at the same time is just
[1:04:00] the sign to us all that the bride is

[1:04:07] I remember a bishop a Pentecostal bishop
[1:04:11] with a very thundering voice friend of

[1:09:33] I'm so anxious for part two
[1:09:37] amen amen hallelujah
[1:09:40] how many were blessed last night praise
[1:09:42] is wonderful name you know I the Bible
[1:09:48] says in Proverbs you see a word and due
[1:09:52] season how good it is amen anyone can
[1:09:56] speak a word you know and is open but in
[1:09:58] due season how good it is
[1:10:01] amen and this is why I feel good because
[1:10:04] a word was spoken in season last night
[1:10:07] amen so therefore if you have any word
[1:10:11] in you you've got to feel good how good
[1:10:14] it is amen I appreciate my good friend
[1:10:17] brother feel open
[1:10:18] [Applause]
[1:10:24] hallelujah as I said last night he has
[1:10:29] taken time to from his very busy
[1:10:31] schedule to drop in and be a blessing to
[1:10:35] us from which we are so thankful for him
[1:10:40] too you know he leaves his family he
[1:10:42] leaves his church and just trying to be
[1:10:45] a blessing to God's people everywhere no
[1:10:51] one really knows really what a minister
[1:10:53] goes through there's a lot of mountains
[1:10:57] is a valley but when a man of God is
[1:11:02] called God call man
[1:11:07] very different than just men God corn
[1:11:13] brother Bram said he cannot even send a
[1:11:17] revival unless he has men right ready to
[1:11:21] carry out that reviving and so therefore
[1:11:24] as sure as he has promised a revival
[1:11:27] he's preparing men to carry it out amen
[1:11:30] amen
[1:11:31] and we all know this so much has been
[1:11:34] spoken about the Fife own ministry and
[1:11:37] who was this and who was that brother
[1:11:41] Graham said if you love me call me
[1:11:42] brother man you see the fivefold
[1:11:46] ministry is a business of God amen
[1:11:49] God has put in a church some apostles
[1:11:52] teachers evangelists and so forth
[1:11:55] and you know he will anoint his men with
[1:12:01] a certain anointing that it will speak
[1:12:03] for itself
[1:12:04] amen I remember I had a very interesting
[1:12:07] conversation with with a another brother
[1:12:11] one time and I we were debating whether
[1:12:16] this person should be called this and
[1:12:19] that
[1:12:20] they say you know if I said he is but
[1:12:24] he's not it doesn't make him any less I
[1:12:28] said my word doesn't make him bad amen
[1:12:31] god that's nice put in a church amen and
[1:12:34] it'll speak for itself
[1:12:36] yes say Amen so we see the revival and
[1:12:39] the the move of the Holy Spirit around
[1:12:41] the world is because God has trained his
[1:12:44] men a man through the fire through the
[1:12:49] struggle through the battles and that is
[1:12:53] all to mold character because he wants
[1:12:58] one day to put his men in position and
[1:13:01] we realize without you no power without
[1:13:07] character what would we do look like
[1:13:10] Joseph Amen he come out finally out of
[1:13:14] the prison and who he was even we see
[1:13:17] him in the next scene on the right hand
[1:13:20] of Pharaoh he had power
[1:13:23] but he had to meet his brethren he could
[1:13:28] have now if he acted any other way
[1:13:32] the history of the Bible certainly would
[1:13:36] have been very different today but I
[1:13:40] believe with all my heart he went
[1:13:43] through all that he had to go through
[1:13:45] for a purpose - main character amen amen
[1:13:50] before because he could have done great
[1:13:53] damage to his family but when he
[1:13:55] recognized his family you know what he
[1:13:58] saw and he cried and he saw how can I
[1:14:02] have anything against you I mean I mean
[1:14:04] the whole thing was a plan anyway you
[1:14:06] didn't know it was a plan I didn't even
[1:14:08] know it was a plan but God purpose will
[1:14:10] be fulfilled Amen even there are many
[1:14:13] things that we don't even know I'm gonna
[1:14:17] tell you something God is leading us
[1:14:19] somewhere but before we arrived we've
[1:14:22] got to go through certain things we've
[1:14:25] got to go through certain problems we've
[1:14:27] got to go through certain fiery trials
[1:14:30] and we wonder why why why is because
[1:14:33] Amen well Joseph remain in jail not one
[1:14:38] day longer a one day earlier until God
[1:14:42] knew that he was ready so don't try to
[1:14:47] rush God out of your trial he knows when
[1:14:51] to take one when to call you out Amen
[1:14:54] praise God so I appreciate these God
[1:14:58] called men and I wanna on behalf of the
[1:15:02] church here apologize for I think we had
[1:15:05] some technical difficulties with the
[1:15:07] streaming online I think the sound
[1:15:12] I went off about 3/4 into the message or
[1:15:16] so but we got the entirety but we copied
[1:15:21] the DVD so it's I'm going to send it to
[1:15:24] brother Isaac to have them put about put
[1:15:26] it up on the on YouTube and we are
[1:15:29] committed now to really upgrade our
[1:15:32] system to make sure that these things
[1:15:34] don't don't happen again because the
[1:15:37] world is dying the world is longing for
[1:15:41] reality for so long we have heard so
[1:15:45] many is it so many wonderful messages
[1:15:47] you know it's blessed us but at the end
[1:15:50] of the day the life is in you and I I
[1:16:00] was so blessed when brother Theo was
[1:16:05] sharing with me about a message that was
[1:16:10] preached by Minister about power power
[1:16:13] and for the very beginning in Genesis as
[1:16:19] long as God was in the human heart and
[1:16:25] that man was given power over the
[1:16:29] elements over whatever
[1:16:34] you see but today everybody wants power
[1:16:39] but what is lacking is that man on the
[1:16:43] throne that's the only way anything
[1:16:47] outside of that is is control its
[1:16:48] control control control you control this
[1:16:51] control this church control enter you
[1:16:53] can't go you know people become members
[1:16:56] of church and they they check in and
[1:16:58] they can't get out that's not God's
[1:17:01] church a man the Church of the Living
[1:17:03] God is free amen with one body praise
[1:17:06] the Lord we love one another
[1:17:07] so with that revelation you see the
[1:17:11] power will be there I believe in the
[1:17:16] church and in the manifest manifests as
[1:17:19] sons of God but we must remember the key
[1:17:22] thing you'll have authority and you'll
[1:17:26] have power and you'll have control as
[1:17:28] long as he is in your throne that's the
[1:17:32] way it was in the beginning anything
[1:17:34] else outside of that was not so from the
[1:17:38] beginning praise this wonderful name
[1:17:40] amen god bless you richly so I want to
[1:17:43] welcome you off to the original faith
[1:17:45] Gospel Tabernacle we are a small Church
[1:17:48] here in New York where we love the Lord
[1:17:51] Jesus and doing our best to hold the
[1:17:54] banner up high of his endtime message

[1:18:04] people often say here we live to work
[1:18:09] and work to live
[1:18:11] very

[1:18:17] and pull aside and to just think about
[1:18:22] the things of God and things like that
[1:18:25] but we New Yorkers we're tongue we have
[1:18:29] to be tough if not then the devil really

[1:21:02] and I just want to read it real quick
[1:21:04] before we have our brother because in
[1:21:08] the seat of discrepancy brother Branham
[1:21:11] says here now now we live through
[1:21:13] Luther's age Wesley's age the Methodist
[1:21:16] age all down through the ages and the
[1:21:20] Pentecostal age and each age is given a
[1:21:23] promise of the word each age is given a
[1:21:27] promise of the word seeing they have to
[1:21:29] come up to that promise of that word
[1:21:31] even though it may be a lot lower than
[1:21:33] what our word is of course it was
[1:21:37] and the people of that age that
[1:21:40] manifests it that promise word is the
[1:21:44] sea of that age
[1:21:47] Amen so remember the people that
[1:21:51] manifested amen the seed of that age
[1:21:55] amen the promise were for that age is a
[1:21:57] seat at a do you want to know who is C
[1:21:59] well it's not just saying I'm C amen
[1:22:03] it'd have to be manifested amen and
[1:22:06] those that manifest that word is the
[1:22:09] seed of that age oh it's manifesting
[1:22:12] time I better not start singing I like
[1:22:16] to sing
[1:22:17] amen the seed of that age according to
[1:22:19] what Jesus said right here they are all
[1:22:23] children of the kingdom that's right I
[1:22:26] listen this is it the manifestation of
[1:22:30] the Holy Spirit operating through his
[1:22:35] children is those seeds of the kingdom
[1:22:39] at that age so whenever you see the Holy
[1:22:42] Spirit operating Amen among his people
[1:22:46] those are the seeds of the kingdom glory
[1:22:50] be to God so don't don't question or a
[1:22:54] wonder why are people shouting and
[1:22:56] glorifying God and why the Spirit of God
[1:22:59] is moving we're manifesting the seed of
[1:23:02] our age glory be to God I don't thankful
[1:23:06] Haman I will never be ashamed of this
[1:23:08] gospel amen because it's the power of
[1:23:10] God unto salvation

[1:23:25] because you know why I have my eyes on
[1:23:27] the prize
[1:23:30] a man let me manifest the Holy Spirit
[1:23:33] amen and I want to be a part of this
[1:23:35] seed of that kingdom
[1:23:37] it meant that brother auger was
[1:23:38] preaching about let's stand to our feet
[1:23:40] everybody every man as we welcome the
[1:23:42] man of God a real man of God who has
[1:23:45] really been a real blessing as I said
[1:23:50] it's not many people that I really have
[1:23:55] confidence not men I don't say that
[1:23:58] there's as many good friends of mine and
[1:24:00] I do have confidence in but there's a
[1:24:02] unique confidence and brother feel of it
[1:24:05] because I see the hand of the Lord upon
[1:24:08] him and not only that I see where the
[1:24:13] Holy Spirit is trying to get his people

[1:25:09] not be made it wasn't it was couldn't be
[1:25:11] done in the wilderness Israel didn't
[1:25:16] possess anything in the wilderness
[1:25:17] couldn't be done in Egypt but as soon as
[1:25:21] Joshua crossed over who did he's meet
[1:25:23] amen he let the angel of the Lord even
[1:25:27] he could do those things things that he
[1:25:31] could never do in the wilderness son
[1:25:35] stand still a man he didn't have that
[1:25:38] premeditated in his mind he had a need
[1:25:42] amen the enemy was running and he knew
[1:25:46] that if the enemy would would run away
[1:25:48] they had a chance to regroup and he had
[1:25:51] a knee and he just spoke it son stand
[1:25:55] still amen amen and that's where Amen

[1:33:12] got something since I've only 18th of
[1:33:15] July and I knew I felt that this is to

[1:33:21] little treasure chest and I'm open that
[1:33:24] chest this morning I'm gonna speak on it
[1:33:27] and the title is the to dwell Extremes
[1:33:33] title the to weigh the subject the
[1:33:37] spirit of the bride say come an
[1:33:38] inspiration crossing Jordan by the
[1:33:41] spirit of forgiveness into the land of
[1:33:44] Ephesians oh praise the name of the Lord
[1:33:47] crossing Jordan by the spirit of
[1:33:49] forgiveness in the land of Ephesians and
[1:33:51] and Paul prayed the prayer in Ephesians
[1:33:54] for this cause I bow my knees in to the
[1:33:56] father of our Lord Jesus Christ from
[1:33:58] whom the whole family in heaven and I
[1:33:59] just mean that he would grant you
[1:34:01] according to the riches of his glory to
[1:34:03] be strengthened with might in his spirit
[1:34:06] in the inner man saying as the inner man
[1:34:09] his auto man but he want you to be
[1:34:11] strengthened in the inner man that
[1:34:12] Christ may dwell in your hearts by feet
[1:34:14] and that he being rooted and grounded in
[1:34:17] love may be able to comprehend with All
[1:34:19] Saints what is the breadth and length
[1:34:21] the depth the height and a little love
[1:34:23] of Christ which passeth knowledge that
[1:34:25] ye might be filled with the fullness of
[1:34:27] God filled with the fullness of God
[1:34:30] praise God and to know the love of
[1:34:34] Christ which passeth knowledge and oh my
[1:34:37] my knowledge have increased but we have
[1:34:39] to get into the love of Christ which
[1:34:41] passeth knowledge isn't that right
[1:34:43] because we could know all things we
[1:34:45] could Norma's Therese but if we don't
[1:34:47] have this charity we are nothing and
[1:34:49] this is what I referred to last night
[1:34:51] yet Jesus bore on print from a man
[1:34:54] presently Lord he said help us tonight
[1:34:55] in these few words as we wait upon thee
[1:34:58] and we pray that your grace and mercy
[1:35:00] will be with us and tender hearts move
[1:35:02] back the shocks the thorns the t-cells
[1:35:05] let the Blessed sunshine of God falling
[1:35:07] upon the word Lord and Miriam such a
[1:35:09] meet until there will not be an unsafe
[1:35:12] whistle among us all the children will
[1:35:14] be in the kingdom of God light see not
[1:35:17] good Kingdom it just raises you above
[1:35:20] this church thing more glory to God
[1:35:22] right the kingdom of God doors with all
[1:35:26] the baptism of the Spirit may they
[1:35:27] receive it father here we go
[1:35:29] may all the great mysteries that we are
[1:35:32] supposed to know at this age Lord be
[1:35:34] unveiled to us that we that we will see
[1:35:38] the plainness of God so that we will
[1:35:40] know how to behave ourselves and act
[1:35:44] correct in ourselves and bring in the
[1:35:47] members of our body into the discipline
[1:35:49] of the word that we might know how to
[1:35:52] live in this present day at the
[1:35:54] approachin of the Lord Jesus so the
[1:35:55] purpose of the ravine of the mysteries
[1:35:57] wasn't the education now wasn't the
[1:36:00] information what's for us to seek this
[1:36:02] is God to see the cleanness of God to
[1:36:05] bring you into unconsciousness you can
[1:36:07] remember we lost our consciousness the
[1:36:09] cover you're born in sin Minicozzi
[1:36:12] like we said those children born into
[1:36:13] monarchy in England they born into a
[1:36:16] certain environment they have to take
[1:36:18] the child and place the child and groom
[1:36:20] the child in that environment then the
[1:36:22] child's consciousness is I'm royalty so
[1:36:25] when they emit unaccompanied on the
[1:36:26] tractor or on Duke I don't know what I
[1:36:31] call the carriage and so on and people
[1:36:33] we even they expect that if nobody wins
[1:36:36] the corner will miss my world it always
[1:36:40] this is the princess and a princess that
[1:36:43] you want to flash and so that is what is
[1:36:46] supposed to do because that's royalty
[1:36:49] but you are royalty that is what you
[1:36:52] come here to get into unconsciousness
[1:36:53] and awareness and that's what we say
[1:36:56] last night
[1:36:56] the Bible said you shall know as you are
[1:36:58] known
[1:36:59] think about that now you shall know as
[1:37:02] you are known you don't know yet what
[1:37:04] God know about you but one day you want
[1:37:07] to know as you unknown glory number
[1:37:11] beseech you exactly but then since this
[1:37:15] is we knowing that we prophesy in part
[1:37:18] but when that which is perfect is come a
[1:37:21] perfect realization where come from your

[1:49:37] version
[1:49:43] I was a breeze advisor I was oh man
[1:49:49] but a Branham oh the book to be sealed
[1:49:53] with seven mystery seven revelation
[1:49:55] relation ten out of the loudest and last
[1:49:57] message of the church age and these
[1:49:59] seven mysteries several misshapen left
[1:50:01] off he said no watch
[1:50:03] he's a looter previous on my feet and
[1:50:05] come Wesley sonification but we are
[1:50:07] promised a correlation 10 according to
[1:50:10] Malachi 4 Luke 22 17 and so forth that
[1:50:13] has got a common other Ephesians to this
[1:50:16] this is promised friends not groups
[1:50:21] Ephesians and we find Ephesians is a
[1:50:26] parallel of Joshua
[1:50:27] so the previsions with a bit Joshua and
[1:50:30] there's more land to be taken some
[1:50:32] people figure this satisfied with a
[1:50:34] couple of books and tapes on the prophet
[1:50:35] and ice plenty like books and tips
[1:50:38] there's more land to be taken you see
[1:50:41] other warm water spirit now from
[1:50:43] profession to possession real and to be
[1:50:46] taken the only problem is the other
[1:50:47] cross Jordan they take it so doesn't
[1:50:49] make sense don't use it binoculars and
[1:50:51] same way looking real good let's check
[1:50:54] the map okay let's check these books and
[1:50:56] these tips on modern technology is
[1:51:10] zooming in and zooming out the bigger
[1:51:14] picture closer to you but you're not
[1:51:16] cross enjoy because there's a way to
[1:51:18] cross Jonah
[1:51:19] there's a spirit atmosphere across drive
[1:51:21] yeah there's something that will kill
[1:51:23] you controlling represents husband your
[1:51:31] wife your chair and your family
[1:51:34] the minutes 30 past or whatever you have
[1:51:36] to drop that's not a football thing
[1:51:38] we're talking about dropping and you had
[1:51:41] to drop this off all of these woods
[1:51:43] it's dropped when the spirit of
[1:51:45] forgiveness comes upon you then you're
[1:51:48] free then you can see the person where
[1:51:51] I'll get enough right I wonder I wanted
[1:51:55] to be that brother I wonder if I thought
[1:51:58] negative I want to meet it because if I
[1:52:00] have something against them
[1:52:01] oh gosh II can't proper have some kind
[1:52:04] of funny business
[1:52:09] see because you see you don't want that
[1:52:11] you want in your and you will see why to
[1:52:15] be a channel of charity and that's why
[1:52:18] brotherly kindness you could feel with
[1:52:20] that but but the chemist is the platform
[1:52:22] for charge it come upon you because
[1:52:25] faith is based upon forgiveness so all
[1:52:28] this tune your heart back to the faith
[1:52:29] of the fathers and you're grumpy mean
[1:52:31] and nasty on earth that could be
[1:52:33] defeated under the seat that can't be
[1:52:38] before the woman have a baby a sweet
[1:52:41] spirit comes over her regardless if
[1:52:44] she's a prostitute
[1:52:46] that's God's operation a man that sweet
[1:52:49] spirit that's properly kindness supposed
[1:52:52] to come upon the bride before the charge
[1:52:54] is splitted into a manifestation because
[1:52:56] the son support have to be born into
[1:52:58] manifestation did you hear that yes
[1:53:02] Jesus born grew up and he came to
[1:53:05] maturity and he came at the
[1:53:06] manifestation by coming to identify the
[1:53:09] book and say the Spirit is upon me any
[1:53:10] bit of duty words of God what sons of
[1:53:13] God have to be born as a manifestation
[1:53:16] so we are promised another Ephesians the
[1:53:20] spirit here in the scripture and if I
[1:53:22] believe we are living and Ephesians
[1:53:23] again back again we are living in what
[1:53:26] was left off in estate agents so Alpha
[1:53:28] and Omega that's what it's all about so
[1:53:31] that God hid from the devil and put it
[1:53:34] under the seventh seal this unfolding of
[1:53:38] this Ephesians
[1:53:39] and put the thunders to make the bridge
[1:53:41] to unfold that Oh hallelujah praise God
[1:53:44] listen Tommy said Maria in the last days
[1:53:46] we are given to understanding by the
[1:53:49] word we are going to understand it
[1:53:51] because it will come on Ephesians to it
[1:53:53] so you would not in ours you're not
[1:53:56] supposed to be confused by any promise
[1:53:58] it's too late for that
[1:54:00] if over 40 plus years William Branham of
[1:54:02] come on the earth there should be no
[1:54:03] confusion there's a big charity of mine
[1:54:06] and purpose and vision as to what we're
[1:54:08] looking for we are looking for dynamics
[1:54:10] to our mechanics not as dynamics floated
[1:54:13] in the air to your mechanic you become
[1:54:16] God mechanics you become part of what
[1:54:18] machinery you become papa boards buddy
[1:54:20] and the dynamics coming down to pick you
[1:54:23] up or give the Lord some praise and says
[1:54:32] now you see what coming on to the Jordan
[1:54:34] meant we are down here now let's cross
[1:54:36] over let's quit playing let's cross to
[1:54:38] the other side now cuz it all belongs to
[1:54:40] us them fishes never feel they can't
[1:54:42] feel because they come from God I
[1:54:43] believe it will always within me we are
[1:54:45] not the Harlan that will run back at the
[1:54:47] wilderness we will cross Jordan prophecy
[1:54:49] the separation caught brick toss the
[1:54:52] seals in the back of the book let us
[1:54:54] enter into this great place now for
[1:54:56] juncture divided to the people the
[1:54:58] inheritance that God left them
[1:54:59] Joshua have to take three things to do
[1:55:02] cross over Jordan fight conquer the land
[1:55:05] and divine you cannot be valid in
[1:55:08] dranzer conquered it is already
[1:55:11] apportioned come and take it up you
[1:55:14] can't do that you have to literally
[1:55:16] conquer the land and then is that people
[1:55:19] just cautious cautious and then King
[1:55:21] that common in front I said listen I
[1:55:23] know you talk on everybody behalf I come
[1:55:25] to talk about my mother
[1:55:28] my tribe I thought my anybody else I
[1:55:31] just want what God promised me I'm
[1:55:33] killing step forward and after what's
[1:55:35] because have to make their claims how do
[1:55:37] I give me the book go on set take the
[1:55:40] book I love that I love that
[1:55:41] but once again need a book get the book
[1:55:44] and eat the book Oh hallelujah God
[1:55:47] requires a Jordan in every life or you
[1:55:50] believe that
[1:55:51] and there's approach across Jordan I
[1:55:53] believe that just really is the spirit
[1:55:54] of forgiveness and God allow a lot of
[1:55:57] things to happen to test our attitudes
[1:55:59] to see how we will make up them so on
[1:56:02] like that
[1:56:02] Oh script I read in Genesis 26 who is
[1:56:09] one of gira this is amplified Corbin
[1:56:11] Isaac Ruth Smith and say the what is
[1:56:13] ours I mean in the world think that name

[2:04:41] testimony no but a coma testified were
[2:04:44] burned the kindness and everything else
[2:04:46] that's his revelation this inspiration
[2:04:48] this manifestation you mean you have to
[2:04:50] get yours yes you have to get your
[2:04:52] because God alone is the revealer of the
[2:04:55] divine revelation of Jesus Christ so
[2:04:57] this word of prophecy you have to come
[2:04:59] inside of you you have to find that
[2:05:01] bloody long there have to be somebody
[2:05:03] that mess you up tie you up
[2:05:05] curse you whatever and I push you to the
[2:05:07] point where you have upset with that
[2:05:08] person to see if you will forgive
[2:05:12] I'm sorry I'm sorry
[2:05:59] [Applause]
[2:06:07] [Applause]
[2:06:11] with all the spread of Christ you may be
[2:06:13] seated
[2:06:15] after those blasts and see this I'll see
[2:06:17] that they want to see supervisor come
[2:06:19] come away my head off the Spirit is not
[2:06:24] right to come the spirit and the bride
[2:06:27] say come
[2:06:28] I feel that just welcoming that is
[2:06:34] inviting I wouldn't judge me because of
[2:06:36] my skin or my here or my color on my
[2:06:38] court or whatever or where I come from
[2:06:40] on my way I'll speak it must be the
[2:06:43] spirit and the bags and come because God
[2:06:46] how he no plan Gordo have no bad blood
[2:06:49] with anybody all glory to God God has
[2:06:51] get upset with his son servants but it's
[2:06:53] not bad blood or glory who so L will
[2:06:56] come look at rehab where was a
[2:06:58] prostitute rehab DC listen really didn't
[2:07:02] demand tell them they're not here
[2:07:05] there's a life
[2:07:10] and I could see it so this is plane dogs
[2:07:12] they picked over his body that's a life
[2:07:17] actually hit them and for doing that
[2:07:20] mister listen put that red phone outside
[2:07:25] a man and you and your horse will be
[2:07:26] saved
[2:07:27] she is say coming to get baptized in
[2:07:29] Jesus name you have a book you have a
[2:07:31] teep you believe this you believe that
[2:07:34] no she's just plain rehab all she do
[2:07:36] she's protect these men and she wants a
[2:07:39] covenant with these men because Joshua
[2:07:41] is coming and when Joshua coming Josh
[2:07:44] are not stopping for nothing and when
[2:07:46] judgment coming is coming for nothing
[2:07:48] when that danger they get to move is
[2:07:51] nothing that was enough not asking who
[2:07:53] your pastor here in the Maximus book
[2:07:55] your red if I'm asking for that is where
[2:07:58] I see the blood over you real this is
[2:08:04] the Messier this message put a banner
[2:08:10] book is not dead
[2:08:11] this seven thunders is not dead
[2:08:29] [Applause]
[2:08:38] no when I get older I can understand
[2:08:41] more why I use a here but for my psyche
[2:08:43] which was younger I can understand that
[2:08:45] no because there was so much to push and
[2:08:48] if you do not be straight the push it is
[2:08:50] hard because you've seen it by vision
[2:08:52] and your seen it as a reality because
[2:08:55] officials become a reality
[2:08:57] it's a reality in vision form but the
[2:09:00] vision itself is from appointed time we
[2:09:03] fit don't backslide don't give up the
[2:09:06] vision is the vision is God's care the
[2:09:14] Lord don't you give up the ministers I

[2:17:49] step
[2:17:50] Oh glory to God let's continue a little
[2:17:52] bit talk about adoption the tutor
[2:17:54] brought bullet to the father that there
[2:17:57] was to be a placing of a son and we have
[2:17:59] we have seen one and the same son that
[2:18:03] was born into the family could be
[2:18:04] adopted into the same family or placed
[2:18:06] in the same family or give up position
[2:18:08] in the family was born into and I do
[2:18:10] believe that is what the work of the
[2:18:12] Holy Spirit today among the church is
[2:18:14] trying trying to place in the trench
[2:18:17] positionally apostles and and teachers
[2:18:20] and prophets before and we have seen
[2:18:22] here we go
[2:18:22] many false alarms go forth among the
[2:18:26] people which only vindicated indicated
[2:18:29] real genuine adoption wasn't have not
[2:18:35] before salon for adoption listen listen
[2:18:39] no what we wish last night about royalty
[2:18:40] and so listen up around words he was
[2:18:42] taken out in the public place and he was
[2:18:45] robbed on a robe past purple or some
[2:18:47] color of royalty
[2:18:49] royal Roop - those sons all mine and was
[2:18:54] set up to the whole city they could look
[2:18:55] and he was here
[2:18:56] oh my the next move of the church is for
[2:18:59] God after your scene for Salaam but no
[2:19:01] God will please in His Church correctly
[2:19:04] God will do that not a man picking man
[2:19:09] man has choosen man God sets in the
[2:19:13] church not some man set in the church
[2:19:15] okay
[2:19:17] so God replacing is just correctly
[2:19:18] apostles prophets teachers evangelists
[2:19:20] not man-made cemetery important
[2:19:23] important but calmly please into the
[2:19:26] church not theology removers and Coover
[2:19:28] Knights but go away please attitude as
[2:19:30] God has chosen as the Holy Ghost has
[2:19:32] tutored oh my please Pizza Jesus Oh
[2:19:37] hallelujah
[2:19:38] oh my mind there are traces of the
[2:19:42] journey we went good pitch 1302 30 just
[2:19:47] has something on peaches nori all right
[2:19:49] there are three states of the genie and
[2:19:50] their teacher that is Jenny but we are
[2:19:52] justified by faith believing on the Lord
[2:19:54] Jesus and so then in Israel in the
[2:19:56] wilderness
[2:19:57] Joonas no place of rest traveling night
[2:19:59] and day fallen a pillar of fire but
[2:20:01] finally they come to the promised land
[2:20:03] where they settle down Israel had not
[2:20:05] received their promise but they were on
[2:20:07] their journey
[2:20:08] so what can't give you inheritance on
[2:20:10] your journey the journey is like a
[2:20:15] wilderness walk talk like you could only
[2:20:18] get your inheritance in the land that is
[2:20:21] white jewelry could tell them when you
[2:20:22] point to the lamp
[2:20:23] take my boots with you don't leave it
[2:20:26] here put it in that land oh praise God
[2:20:29] in a hallelujah you love it please cross
[2:20:34] the bottom says but the believers and
[2:20:35] the killer was just an outfit that was
[2:20:37] going on to the promise they move over
[2:20:38] into the land and took the land as a
[2:20:40] possession let's not go on to the back
[2:20:43] to the Holy Spirit let's not stop
[2:20:45] believing Lord Jesus being baptized but
[2:20:46] we go on to the promise of the Holy
[2:20:48] Ghost itself how God has set in the
[2:20:51] church to labor pains they get
[2:20:53] tremendous sometimes I wonder church has
[2:20:55] grown in this one of my favorite quotes
[2:20:56] if you're hearing my similar might hear
[2:20:58] me cuttin it over and over and over
[2:20:59] say policy always equal
[2:21:00] same thing because it's uh it's so real
[2:21:03] to me I thought when you scored a set
[2:21:05] some in the church to deliver pains they
[2:21:07] get tremendous um time I when the change
[2:21:10] is groaning under the persecution of the
[2:21:11] outside world believe in our Lord Jesus
[2:21:13] yet if we have ego that the promise of
[2:21:15] the Holy Ghost is just as real as it was
[2:21:18] to the Pentecost how they groan and cry
[2:21:20] under lima beans but when they are born
[2:21:22] and positionally born into the kingdom
[2:21:24] then god has set in a church apostles
[2:21:27] and prophets on son like that oh praise
[2:21:29] the name of the Lord glory dog or demon
[2:21:32] God is trying to please his church and
[2:21:36] position to manifest himself manifest
[2:21:39] himself
[2:21:40] so all these sermons and teaching like
[2:21:42] you know people like to talk about
[2:21:43] teachers and teachers and their
[2:21:45] preachers you know the speechless sinner
[2:21:47] and evangelist to talk to the sinner and
[2:21:50] teachers does positionally please the
[2:21:51] believer and I ask myself what are the
[2:21:53] believers being pleased for you have to
[2:21:56] be pleased for power so it comes right
[2:21:59] back to the spirit it's not just
[2:22:01] teaching to be taught and preached and
[2:22:03] evangelist eNOS and time is not
[2:22:05] regularly vandalism you say vandalism is
[2:22:08] shipping stones so the Evangelist
[2:22:11] endtime evangelism is not regularly
[2:22:13] vandalism any time evangelism is cuttin
[2:22:16] I'm shipping you to fit into God's
[2:22:18] program that is what that is about
[2:22:20] so God is trying to place his church a
[2:22:23] position to manifest himself getting one
[2:22:25] you can work through like this and say
[2:22:27] there's my spirit flowing in freely
[2:22:30] adopt him please sin manifest and take
[2:22:32] him out there I'm visiting with an angel
[2:22:34] tell him something if he's just making
[2:22:37] it up it won't work I mean
[2:22:38] manifestations of sons of God when God
[2:22:41] manifests himself he sends him out when
[2:22:43] he goes forth what he says his truth
[2:22:45] what he does is the truth what he does
[2:22:47] he manifests Christ or do you judge him
[2:22:49] by the way he steals with the word right
[2:22:51] with the world all glory to God so this
[2:22:54] week would bride would have signs
[2:22:57] wonders and miracles

[2:35:07] I want to see that again
[2:35:12] God showed me that my own hand wasn't
[2:35:16] right because I was trying to condemn
[2:35:19] her I'm not looking at what I come from
[2:35:21] - so we can always remember look back to
[2:35:26] the bit where we was huge from things
[2:35:29] will look a lot different we don't want
[2:35:32] to condemn no one love everybody
[2:35:34] whenever you lose that genuine love
[2:35:37] that's in your heart you've lost
[2:35:38] everything
[2:35:39] don't forget that when you lose love
[2:35:42] it's all gone remember that the love
[2:35:44] this little brother had all for you you
[2:35:46] remember the love of the Brethren I am
[2:35:49] NOT saying listen I am NOT saying all
[2:35:51] you organization break up an
[2:35:53] equalization I'll never it'll never be
[2:35:55] that way you will never do it just go
[2:35:59] through life just to same old mangling
[2:36:01] and first man's doing that's wrong keep
[2:36:03] your organization stay in there if you
[2:36:05] can that's all right but reach out an
[2:36:08] arm and love everybody else and have
[2:36:11] respect give him a little blanket too
[2:36:13] because he wants to get covered also it
[2:36:15] stretched far enough for all of us room
[2:36:19] there is plenty of room there's room for
[2:36:22] all of us there's a fountain for me
[2:36:25] there's a fun day for all of us who
[2:36:27] remember that if I could see our clothes
[2:36:29] this is a final code if I could see
[2:36:31] every Pentecostal Church the Foursquare
[2:36:33] blue open Bible standard Pentacles
[2:36:36] assembly
[2:36:36] United Pentecostal church and all the
[2:36:39] rest of them put the answer on one
[2:36:40] another and forget the differences just
[2:36:42] fell upon one another I will still let
[2:36:43] by so many paths and peace for mine eyes
[2:36:45] have seen thy salvation are you ready
[2:36:48] for the closing words as long as Seaton
[2:36:52] got you shooting at one another
[2:36:54] he's just sits back and take a vacation
[2:36:57] you don't have to do more for him I pray
[2:37:00] I'll live to see that day and if you
[2:37:03] don't do it within yourself if you don't
[2:37:06] do it within yourself
[2:37:08] some kind of persecution will hit this
[2:37:10] nation one of these days you would long
[2:37:13] for one another then brothers of like
[2:37:16] precious faith so why go to this
[2:37:18] punishment when you can have a little
[2:37:20] piece of heaven on earth right now God
[2:37:23] be with you
[2:37:24] and I say God be with you god bless you
[2:37:27] but it just let's all stand up give them
[2:37:42] some presents
[2:37:48] [Music]
[2:37:56] praise the Lord let's give the Lord a
[2:37:58] hand to pray did you appreciate that
[2:38:05] message I feel such a wonderful
[2:38:14] anointing in the place here in this
[2:38:16] moment we were encouraged to begin to
[2:38:20] dig Amen that third well amen before
[2:38:25] over the first and the second but the
[2:38:28] third well is this room for everybody
[2:38:30] there's plenty for everybody the
[2:38:32] spirited debry say come amen and I trust
[2:38:37] and pray that from this meeting not only
[2:38:43] intellectually we have been blessed and
[2:38:46] understood words that were preached but
[2:38:51] is very different when a revelation
[2:38:54] strikes you Damon a revelation puts you
[2:38:58] into action
[2:38:59] that's right to practice that which you
[2:39:02] have heard amen amen
[2:39:04] because there's no longer here amen I've
[2:39:07] heard so many over the years yes this is
[2:39:12] okay we need to drop our office and yet
[2:39:16] we've never dropped them see only the
[2:39:21] Holy Spirit can bring a real unity of
[2:39:24] the faith
[2:39:26] and as feared as you but we've got to
[2:39:28] get started brother Berman said if we
[2:39:30] can only get started
[2:39:32] God will do the rest
[2:39:35] amen and let us also remember there are
[2:39:39] some that cannot forgive and will never
[2:39:45] be able to forgive because only the seed
[2:39:48] of God amen
[2:39:52] this is why John said beloved let us
[2:39:56] love one another for love is of God and
[2:40:00] every one that loveth no one he that
[2:40:04] loveth not for God you may know the
[2:40:14] Scriptures you may know this quotes you
[2:40:17] may know the Bible from cover to cover
[2:40:21] but you don't know God because God is
[2:40:25] love
[2:40:27] amen and that we need to stop just
[2:40:31] talking about and we need to begin to
[2:40:35] practice it and I trust and pray that
[2:40:38] brother open had expressed to me that he
[2:40:43] is willing to come by every three four
[2:40:48] months as the Lord will lead him I wish
[2:40:52] he was coming back next week actually I
[2:40:56] certainly would appreciate that myself
[2:40:58] we're fighting we need all the help that
[2:41:01] we can that's right and but I am so
[2:41:04] happy that when any man of God points
[2:41:08] people back to the
[2:41:09] god I mean there's so many people
[2:41:11] pointing to different things and but we
[2:41:15] need to get back to the simplicity of
[2:41:17] the gospel of Jesus amen to think what
[2:41:22] the whole mystery of this entire Bible
[2:41:28] Paul wraps it up into one thing Christ
[2:41:33] in you the hope of glory that's the
[2:41:39] entire mystery all that God was he
[2:41:42] poured it into Christ that's right and
[2:41:44] as brother
[2:41:45] Ovid saying oh what a mighty God that
[2:41:48] created the universe I mean two spaces
[2:41:51] there is no beginning no end in the
[2:41:54] universes and listen you would think
[2:41:58] that his son would come in a way that
[2:42:01] would it be impressive to everyone and
[2:42:04] everyone would recognize supernaturally
[2:42:07] oh yes he is a son of God I know
[2:42:11] they come down and condescending it to
[2:42:14] God the form of you and I soorma are the
[2:42:19] former sinful flesh because he had to do
[2:42:23] that in order to be a kinsman redeemer
[2:42:25] he had a job to do
[2:42:27] he had to be human he was total human
[2:42:33] and he was total that's what's beautiful
[2:42:37] about that
[2:42:39] how God could be so great and yet make
[2:42:42] himself man and yet still be God going
[2:42:46] around with a little beard and
[2:42:48] everything else has brother brought his
[2:42:49] brother Theo was speaking about it's a
[2:42:51] healing to sink raising the dead and
[2:42:53] everything else and there's some people
[2:42:55] that today you hear them saying oh if I
[2:42:58] was living in the days of Christ I would
[2:43:00] have recognized them no you would not
[2:43:01] have because if you don't recognize this
[2:43:04] you won't you would have never
[2:43:05] recognized what Amen praise the Lord
[2:43:09] because this is the word and the word is
[2:43:12] Christ amen so therefore thank you
[2:43:17] brother Ovid for taking your time I
[2:43:18] appreciate you and may God bless you
[2:43:22] bless your ministry bless your church
[2:43:24] and give you strength to do what God has
[2:43:29] called you to do
[2:43:30] amen and to travel and in different
[2:43:34] places you go and it's difficult friends
[2:43:38] to to do what you know what a preacher
[2:43:42] does and getting on planes and traveling
[2:43:47] through time zones and things like that
[2:43:49] arriving jet lag and then your preaching
[2:43:52] the next morning and you just don't know
[2:43:55] where you're at actually but I'm so

[2:49:13] praise this wonderful name you know the
[2:49:16] word goes forth and it's time he meant
[2:49:21] that we express our thanks to God we can
[2:49:27] never thank him enough for what we have
[2:49:31] heard today and this weekend has been
[2:49:33] glorious and I trust as the beginning of
[2:49:36] many more I am speechless I moved I am
[2:49:45] inspired and I have often said this in
[2:49:51] my heart this message is they'll say of
[2:49:59] the Lord
[2:50:01] [Music]
[2:50:04] as many distractions in the world today
[2:50:09] we were speaking to the church not too
[2:50:11] long ago on it may have mentioned it
[2:50:14] last night I'm not sure but Peter was
[2:50:22] wondering about John
[2:50:26] the one that Jesus loved
[2:50:32] who leaned on Christ marasmus chest and
[2:50:39] he asks Peter asked what shall this man
[2:50:43] do and you know sometimes we just
[2:50:47] looking at what others are doing and yet
[2:50:53] [Music]
[2:50:54] Jesus said what is it to you if he
[2:50:57] should tear it till I come
[2:51:00] and then we're not a saying an
[2:51:03] interpretation it wasn't correct that's
[2:51:08] not what he said he said but what is it
[2:51:11] what is it to you
[2:51:14] if he should tarry till I come and yet
[2:51:17] it was spiritual because John did see
[2:51:21] the coming of the Lord amen so many
[2:51:27] times Jesus may say something in the
[2:51:29] Bible we think it's natural and so forth
[2:51:32] but his spiritual meaning but the main
[2:51:37] thing what is that to be follow about me
[2:51:40] and I was reading a quote how brother
[2:51:43] Branham said this is why we are holding
[2:51:48] back the adoption of children because
[2:51:53] we're so busy trying to figure out what
[2:51:56] shall this man do why shall desk this
[2:51:59] one do but if you're focused on he said
[2:52:03] follow thou me Amon and he is a word
[2:52:08] hallelujah and I'm so thankful that we
[2:52:11] need to get refocused there's been a lot
[2:52:14] of distractions here and there we need
[2:52:16] to get refocused follow thou me let's
[2:52:21] get back to the middle of the road amen
[2:52:24] and I don't care what you see on the
[2:52:27] internet what you read and how many
[2:52:29] defections and so forth and how many
[2:52:31] people on the internet want to disprove
[2:52:33] this message I say to you what is that
[2:52:37] to thee just follow thou me because if
[2:52:41] you have a genuine revelation you'll be
[2:52:43] like Peter who said when Jesus asks them
[2:52:46] will you leave - Peter said where can I
[2:52:50] go you alone have the words of eternal
[2:52:52] life amen and I say today amen this is
[2:52:56] the best I know this is the very best I
[2:53:00] know you alone have the words of eternal
[2:53:02] life amen
[2:53:04] and to think that God would take me out
[2:53:06] of oh I'm out of Harlem out of a place
[2:53:09] that I don't know if God didn't express
[2:53:13] his mercy to me and take me out of that
[2:53:15] place I may be in prison I may have been
[2:53:17] dead
[2:53:18] may have been whatever because many of
[2:53:20] my friends ended up in prison dead
[2:53:22] whatever and I was so shy
[2:53:28] growing up never ever that I ever in my
[2:53:34] wildest dream expected to be a witness
[2:53:40] for his name
[2:53:43] [Music]
[2:53:44] but is not your choice it's his choice
[2:53:48] a mana be an abyss his choice he's got
[2:53:51] to give you what it takes I know God
[2:53:54] loves me I know why he took me from and
[2:53:58] I always tell the church and don't
[2:53:59] forget where you come from a man we like
[2:54:03] to judge somebody else and so forth oh
[2:54:05] no but we've come from many many hard
[2:54:09] things and we like to judge but no no
[2:54:12] this is what makes God so beautiful
[2:54:15] amen we love him because he first loved
[2:54:21] us the relator you always speak about
[2:54:24] love oh I love love God is love
[2:54:29] amen amen and I want to always make sure
[2:54:33] that I express my gratitude to him we
[2:54:38] try to sing this song yesterday I said
[2:54:41] we tried I but I didn't have all the
[2:54:43] words and I was mumbling amen above all
[2:54:47] can we sing that above all one more time
[2:54:50] because it's such a beautiful song above
[2:54:55] all
[2:54:58] of all Kings above all nature in all
[2:55:06] created things above all wisdom and all
[2:55:13] the ways of man

[3:06:36] seals half seals whatever they think men
[3:06:41] amen you know the time has come for
[3:06:44] character that's the main thing
[3:06:47] amen and character God you know you
[3:06:49] realize that God cannot give you care
[3:06:51] that's right character is not a gift see
[3:06:55] that character see is a victory amen and
[3:06:59] we have
[3:07:02] a challenge we have a test we have
[3:07:05] something to overcome and that is what
[3:07:08] will develop the character that Jesus is
[3:07:12] looking for in our life amen
[3:07:15] so therefore that's what we're striving
[3:07:18] for to strive to be positioning please
[3:07:21] [Music]
[3:07:22] god bless you thank you all for coming I
[3:07:25] appreciate you anytime you're in this
[3:07:26] area
[3:07:27] amen you're more than welcome to come
[3:07:29] and join in fellowship with us
[3:07:32] Amen we people ask what do we believe we
[3:07:36] believe everything we meant what Amen
[3:07:39] what's in the Bible what brother Graham
[3:07:40] says we've been there as long as it
[3:07:42] lines up perfectly with what brother
[3:07:44] Graham said that's what we believe
[3:07:45] that's right so God richly bless you
[3:07:48] [Music]
[3:07:49] just one there is just one announcement
[3:07:54] that I want to make after this service
[3:07:59] after the service we're going to Venice
[3:08:02] and it's typical of what we do
[3:08:06] we will be meeting or rather gathering
[3:08:10] so people wanted to know I want to know
[3:08:13] where we'll be
[3:08:16] afterwards it is lunchtime there is an
[3:08:20] island buffet the Chinese buffet it's
[3:08:25] located at 1874 Grand Avenue Baldwin so
[3:08:33] that is where we will be having lunch
[3:08:37] and I wish it was within our means to
[3:08:42] pay for everyone here but we certainly
[3:08:45] cannot do that but if you want to come
[3:08:51] and join us
[3:08:52] that's where we will be and it's
[3:08:56] moderately priced there's a Chinese
[3:08:59] buffet or you can eat those that like to
[3:09:01] eat oh that's this is your place
[3:09:04] so god bless you richly amen and let's
[3:09:08] have
[3:09:16] Heavenly Father is truly we can truly
[3:09:22] say from the bottom of our hearts
[3:09:25] like those dear God that there was a man
[3:09:33] that come by these two disciples didn't
[3:09:38] recognize this man but this man joined
[3:09:40] them on their journey and begin to speak
[3:09:44] precious words and they were astonished
[3:09:50] first of all because this man appeared
[3:09:54] not to know what was going on in
[3:09:58] Jerusalem and the current events of that
[3:10:01] day
[3:10:02] but sometimes you like to sneak up one
[3:10:07] our fellowships your God and to manifest
[3:10:12] yourself in such a way until we
[3:10:15] recognize and it's the presence of the
[3:10:17] Lord among us and they had a testimony
[3:10:24] after it was all over did not a heart
[3:10:29] burn within us as he spoke to us along
[3:10:32] the way I have to say the same thing did
[3:10:35] not our hearts burn within us today
[3:10:38] yesterday today yes as the Holy Spirit
[3:10:43] ministered to our hearts amen a heart of
[3:10:47] burning law would fire and we realize
[3:10:51] that the revival starts in the
[3:10:53] individual heart of every person father
[3:10:56] may this weekend start a revival father
[3:11:01] god and may it spread out there God to
[3:11:05] different places father for the glory of
[3:11:10] God because we realized their God that
[3:11:13] there is coming a revival and the only
[3:11:18] revival that there remains there's an
[3:11:21] exclusive revival is to Brys revival but
[3:11:24] the Branham referred to it as the brides
[3:11:27] revival denominations they've had their
[3:11:30] revivals they've had their healing
[3:11:32] campaigns they've had their dance and
[3:11:34] that but oh but this revival Oh
[3:11:39] we'll bring a translation faith your God
[3:11:43] in so much dear God that oh it'll give
[3:11:49] us that faith dear God to walk like
[3:11:53] Enoch walked and take a walk with you
[3:11:56] Lord and be found not one day people be
[3:12:00] looking for us looking on the job
[3:12:05] looking whatever it is to our homes and
[3:12:08] we are found not oh we have taken a walk
[3:12:12] with Jesus hallelujah that sounds like a
[3:12:15] fairy tale to some but that's thus saith
[3:12:19] the Lord
[3:12:19] a man there's going to be a bride it's
[3:12:22] going to be a rapture and we're so
[3:12:24] thankful that we are part and we are
[3:12:26] elected to that group there god that's
[3:12:29] gonna be not only called out Laura
[3:12:33] predestinated Laura because brother Bram
[3:12:35] said that this bride will not be like
[3:12:39] the first one she cannot be the seed the
[3:12:42] word is in the bride already so
[3:12:46] therefore there can be no other strange
[3:12:48] seed that can enter in that bride their
[3:12:51] God we cannot be deceived
[3:12:53] Amen because the word is already in us
[3:12:56] father I pray that you would give your
[3:12:58] people traveling mercies whether they're
[3:13:00] traveling far or or locally father may
[3:13:05] you bless each and every one on of them
[3:13:08] on their journey and may they think on
[3:13:09] these things they're gone
[3:13:11] the things that were spoken this weekend
[3:13:13] what a beautiful weekend it was and if
[3:13:18] it be your will we would love to do this
[3:13:21] again father perhaps at another location
[3:13:25] if
[3:13:25] to be your will and Oh we'd love to have
[3:13:30] brother if you all would come every
[3:13:31] three whatever two months every two
[3:13:36] months or three months as his schedule
[3:13:39] permits may God bless each and every one
[3:13:42] and bless those that are on the Internet

[3:13:49] would have been a blessing to those that
[3:13:51] were listening the father and if they
[3:13:53] have not if they don't know you as a
[3:13:56] personal Savior father God may they
[3:13:59] realize that what they have heard what
[3:14:02] they have heard amen is a call a man to
[3:14:06] come and make right with God because we
[3:14:10] cannot sit and listen and say that's a
[3:14:13] good message good sermon we have got to
[3:14:15] react to the Word of God and make our
[3:14:18] lives correct with God we ask these
