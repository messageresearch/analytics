it that Dev is a liar this this morning not because you're struggling you're not going to make it not because in a mind ping you're not going to make it not because your he man under press and stress you're not going to make it you're going to make it [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah woo my feel the spirit inside of here let me deal with something though got this email and uh 3D January to our website dear brother ID greetings in Jesus name I want to thank you so much for your labors of love for God's people I'm enjoying and hearing the good news the Lord has blessed you in such a time that the devil is on a rampage to destroy all the hard work that has been done by the prophet and the Apostle thank you for yielding to the Holy Ghost I want to kindly ask a question but forgive me if it's not in order as I'm not trying to interfere in your local church decisions but the enemy is looking to do damage where he can in the message follow me but the kman Blasted drums as Voodoo instruments and I see little drums used in your church and most churches in the message especially the seventh and inspiration don't use them I don't know much but the critics could use that in a negative way please help me here so I know what to say people ask me this is my humble question not trying to be critical please understand I love your ministry to death God bless and a brother put his name I wouldn't put his name and I want to thank that brother uh for his respects and humility in sending the question and I love the question I um intend to deal I say with every elephant in the room we're not going to back down we're not going to run out we we will deal with issues as the common questions and I welcome criticisms I welcome uh questions we welcome whatever it is that will improve what we do and how we do we welcome it I want to say we welcome it we not tinin to get fight because there's a complaint we want to hear the complaints we want to hear the issues that troubling and and affecting you that we could deal with it because where we fail we want to succeed where we have to throw things out we will boot it out where we will correct things we will correct things we have nothing to defend we have nothing to pretend we just want to stand for what is right and we want to stand for Jesus Christ we love him and that's why we're here we here to serve him you're not here because of me you're here because God called you isn't that I remember when I was invited I was 16 years of age when I was invited to hear a tape the message was why Christ speak I sat down in the room deceased by the prince and you know when I think back about my life it's so much deceased now and deceased brother the prince he was obliquely opposite my house down in San Fernando and he invited me to hear tape was right CHR speak sat down there listen to the whole message and he at the end of the tape he asked me an astonishing question do you believe this to be a prophet and I give an answer I say yes because something in me bought record what I heard there was no Prophet there Apostle there Pastor there teacher there evangelist there there was just a brother a humble brother who wasn't even so educated just played a tape and I listened to the tape receive the message and never turn back or look back since that time there was nobody else no man no Elder no Deacon nobody saying anything that was God speaking to a son calling him by the eagle it was a eagle to the eagle call so when God called you there was no man in between there is no human being in between there's the spirit of the Living God calling you so let me deal with this this morning I want to deal with this and then I'll go and preach in October 28 2012 I spoke a message in New York the dispensation of another Ephesians in it the Holy Spirit guided me to make a clear distinction between what was echoed there and brother colan own personal inspiration that he had and I said Brother Joseph colan echoed the message of Malachi 4 I also said he did not have his own message if he had his own message it would be not complimentary to what he labed for all these years his testimony has always been to be an echo of what brother Bram said as you might be aware very few ministers quote brother Bram majority of preachers for all the years I've known don't even quote William Brown they preach what they want to preach and when they're ready they flavor it like if you're sprinkling some salt in it with whatever they want to think on the message but Joseph one of the few men and I was what 17 1975 when he came quoting the promises for the bride that's right that's the seven Thunders was never a New York promise it was always B branham's message amen it so happened nobody else choose to quote it and he did so it became aligned with him and New York but it had was to come that way because brother said there was something about New York so it was lined up with the prophet's prophecy that it will come that way which is the echo not a new message not another message but echoing the promises that brother Brandon brought so I said that Brother Joseph Coleman echoed the message of Malachi 4 and he had his own inspiration for his church Church his ministry and his family and I believe that distinction and division must be made because if it's not made you'll be confused I am not confused I never was Hallelujah I am not confused I never was because God sent one messag one messenger and that messenger is Malachi 4 from that one man message other men came for to make bring sense and life to the very message that the prophet brought he himself said May these men make it come to life I am only laying the seeds so all we could preach over the years was the seed because you cannot bring it forth until rain come as long as there is no rain all you could preach is seed all you could do is prophecy and give I give a testimony of the the spirit of Prophecy which is the testimony of Jesus so so all we could really do over the years was to take the message and Echo the promises God said it it's going to come to pass God said so there's going to deliverer that's what 400 years was God going to send a Moses we don't know when he is coming but we know he is coming that's all it was all these years Hallelujah Ministry of the word prophecy amen amen okay sa said that um I want to say that this itself this question and this statement clearly shows the importance of the sovereignity of the local church this is very important because the Bible said God have a people out of different Nation tongues people and so forth when I went to India they had the drums they had all the instrument instrument that you don't use we don't use they use across the as musical instruments and they playing that and they're doing that normal normal normal uh brother came to sing a special and he was barefoot normal normal normal no that ain't going to work in America but Barefoot that is normal I on the platform and that is normal that's fine because every country have its culture its environment its language its tongue its people it's food it's taste but God said out of different nations tongues people he's going to call a people for his name's sake so God is Not measuring one people with another people come on now say amen somebody God is Not than one people but how this one do it and how that one do it God allows the operation within the local that is why God must have local Elders local ministers and that's why it's a horrible thing when a nicolan spirit and political spirit and spirit trying to conquer the lady to come on to tell preachers and churches what they're supposed to do and how they're supposed to do it amen that's that's that's where the problem lies amen so therefore he BR woman blasted drums in the church and I know it but I couldn't do that because I have to go by what the word Say by what the prophet said I cannot go by his personal inspiration or what he sees for his church and follow it because he did it because if it's not a revelation to me I'll be following here we go without Revelation and I remember preaching in pen Harris about I think was president rean he had some guests at his table in the White House when he was president and everybody had the cup and had milk and the and he pour his milk into a plate and everybody watched the milk and pour it into the plate too and then the president take it and put it on for his cat and then everybody got caught because they were following here we go without Revelation they were watching the President they're not watching what inside of there what they're supposed to do and that's [Applause] me Hallelujah I don't copy I don't just do because others do if it's revealed to me you can't lock me and stop me from it glory to God I will stand regardless if everybody don't stand with it I will still stand with it hallelujah praise God now watch just as okay go ahead now watch so I never found or see where brother brandham refer to Drums as Voodoo instruments now if brother K get that inspiration for his church that's fine nothing against that he could say he don't want drums he don't want piano that's fine any Minister can say what they want and what they don't want and that's supposed to be respected some Churches have sisters on one side Brothers on one side I can't go and blast that that is what they have they have brothers in front sisters behind that's fine every church is Sovereign what we come for is the word and in addition and I was thinking it over from the of spirit but I'm say you do not judge somebody by Inner rain outer R you don't judge somebody by what church they go to who they associate with you judge them how by what spirit is in them John the Baptist didn't mix with anybody and they criticized John Jesus mix with everybody this he he too much M bibbers and Drinkers and so on why is he you see so you can't judge Jesus he liing with drunkers he's a drunk too that's wrong check the man Spirit out H check the man motive and objective out Hallelujah even if he looking uh tricky like Jacob you got to watch it you got to watch it because that is God's son all right we going to go there all right so I never found or see where brother bham refer to Drums as Voodoo and I guess we could call the electric a rock music instrument but it depends upon how it is used that's right so I want to share a few quotes of what brother manam said concering drums I check out voodo drums I check out whatever I I checked it out I have to go by the word so this is what we have here but brandham from Mees called pardon 963 28th of October what we need today is a prophet to rise on the scene with dust he the Lord and strip those things to the bottom and say that they have become a stink our denomination has growned our churches are big they are finer than they ever was we'll be a lot better off with a pan standing on the Alley again with a guitar out there beating a drum or something with real Pentecostal fire burning our souls than to set in great pews that we setting today dying with the world dying under our feet next quot just once more Lord 1 December 63 and the very thing that God raised a Pentecost to do that has them bound stripped of Fellowship stripped of power fussing St luk on members find great things they are better off having a old Salvation Army drum or little old guter down on the corner somewhere I'd rather have that than have Cathedrals costing millions of dollars just about two more voice of the sign 21st of March 1964 right then the church is worth a lot of money milon million dollars in buildings there'll be better off father I believe back standing in the corner beating a tambourine with a hat in their hand old drummer and the corn like Salvation Army then it would be to sit in these great mars tonight trying to pattern after the world having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof last quote and this is from God's provided way and he said if I didn't respect the presence of Jehoshaphat I wouldn't even look at you now he got all chewed up he said play me some music so they got to play in the music the tamarine now listen if you can't be a prophet you can be one of the instruments that plays the music to bring the spirit down on the prophet you know what I mean so they begin to play the tambourine and beat the drums and play the instruments and all of them begin to beat and play and had a great big old song Maybe playing going to be a meeting in the air in the Sweet By and By and then the prophet begin to get in the spirit and the first thing you know get in the spirit things begin to happen oh blessed be the name of the Lord so that is what the prophet say about drum so even though I was aware of those things spoken I ignored it because that was not a revelation to me you see I cannot do what other churches do just because they do it uh I as the pastor of this church have to operate by Revelation so even though I know what was spoken I had to ignore it because it was not revealed to me not knocking that inspiration that Boman has because sometimes men are different and even in counseling uh some some pastors approach things a certain way different from how I would approach things and that's fine I don't question that because God have a way of using men differently amen so I can't question I may have a different approach so therefore I can't judge another man's approach I can't do that I'm not in a position to do that but I want to say this though when I sign up for the message I sign up for the word hallelujah hallelujah I didn't sign up for church politics Hall therefore I didn't sign up for a minister fighting another Minister I never bought any Minister's fight everybody who know me knows that I didn't buy any man's fight whatsoever if a man have a problem with a brother because this is what happens this is what church politics does I'll give you explanation and I people give me back testimony if this pastor have issue with another Pastor the whole church against that church because the pastor put that issue upon the people and screw the people up mess the people up and the people don't even know why they hate presentent and can't take that other church or that other Pastor I have never been in that there is no Pastor could accuse me of that I've never done that I'm free as a bird you're free to come welcome you're free to go or bye-bye praise God no attachment I don't run the church like a family I don't run the church like a club I don't do that you are God's people and I see God's people as not belonging to any man Hallelujah you don't belong to me you belong to him you're here to serve God I'm here to preach the word of God I'm here to inspire you to get closer to Christ yeah yeah yeah I may not be the smooth type of preacher I may not come with the psychology that others come with to play mind games I don't play Mind Games I tell you like it is can somebody say Amen oh Hallelujah Glory so what I'm fighting for is the kingdom of God remember years ago I told a brother I said listen if you fighting for your family in your church and you want to build your own church and Old Kingdom that's up to you I say I will support and back any man who is for the kingdom of God there are some people stop right at the family right there right there everything is right there like if that is the kingdom we can't afford to do that we can't afford Jesus called people from their family Peter come Andrew come come come come come come follow me not stay in your family business follow me I'll make you fishes of men that's the commission that's with your family your family will mess you up because they have thoughts but you're looking for the thoughts of God to drop down upon your soul to infect your life Hallelujah so this is what I want to show us trust that the brother get blessed uh with what we share here before we go into the word play Jesus's sweetest name I know just play a bit um praise God so I tell my wife and say know I love progress I love to see people achieve I love people to to want to change I hate people who don't like challenges there are some people praying praying praying pray oh God God God and they can't follow instructions when they come out to the prayer and God bring a word for them they can't follow that but they oh Jesus help me help me help me Jesus say I'm coming to help you I'm sending a word for you and when the word come for you I can't do that I don't want to do that you you're wasting your prayers he say your own prayers locking up your blessing because all you got to do is to obey and follow what God want to give you that's all you got to do Hallelujah you could ball you could scream you get nothing if after you come out of that you cannot follow simple instructions because the word come to give instructions and guidance and many times it's contrary to what you think what you feel how you feel is going to be like God love to raise the pressure man we can say some things here I I can drop it on you I'm going to drop it on you but I going say when the Press come down I have a coach and know the Press have to press have to press have to press have to press they don't want to say Amen Isaac because they hearing about the Press oh not not de press when the Press come down so therefore the Press is very important in your life you don't even know how much that important in life you leave people as they are in the comfort zone they do nothing they stay right there they're safe you see right now the budget is on One Price the oil change and whatnot that is circumstances that chain cannot control the world cannot control that is external circumstances and that's what going to happen if love doesn't get you desperate external circumstances God going to force the issue my God I want to get out of here I want to get out of here when I get out of here listen listen listen go listen a little bit Jacob Jacob do all kind of tricks he was Son of God called of God God spoke to him Commission of God elect of God talking about Jacob now same SK guy tricky as ever but watch this God allow Esau to be so dread that when Jacob was told to go back home go back to your Homeland go back go back to the word go back to where you come from go go back to your country go back to where you belong how many feel like going back this morning we saying back to the word he us to come to confront see I could find this scripture the Bible I'm going to read it and sing and then we going to start the scriptures let me just [Music] Hall this is Jacob and Jacob said he's praying he know to confront Esau he send gifts split up his family send wife this way wife this way compan this he give up everything you people hold on to the family God strip him of everything now he have no family now I not I'm not hearing amens now I'm not hearing all the attachment he he had to SP he had to give up everything then give up his family is give up everything and then Jacob is all alone now all alone all alone he have no wife to lean on he have no children to comfort him he have no grandchildren running around his foot he has nothing like that he has no weal to say oh I'm somebody you know when somebody have nothing they ordinary they happy they go lucky shake your hand when somebody get something two chain of clothing they walk the head up in the air like the air like it's very rare they get two piece or something go God don't like that God want you to be as you are he wants some body the more He blesses the more humble he becomes the more humble he stays God want that kind of heart he want to bless you more and you already stopped up when God trying to push you already full up of yourself he can't even push any blessing inside of you because you already full of you if you get out to you this morning God going to pour pour inside your house this very morning amen you may be seated I'm about to finish this session here now and Jacob said oh god of My Father Abraham this is Jacob the Rascal this is Jacob the SC man this is Jacob the Scamp amen this is Jacob PR he's not changed [Applause] [Music] yet oh god of My Father Abraham God of my father Isaac this this Genesis 3:9 the Lord which said unto me ah return unto that country andto thy Kindred and I deal well with thee this is worm Jacob the worm this this is not the butterfly come on now give the Lord a shout inside of here this is not Jacob the butterfly this is Jacob the worm praying I am not worthy of the least of all thy mercies hallelujah oh give the Lord a shout you Hallelujah I love that man I love that man he know he's unworthy he's telling go listen I'm not worthy of the least of thy mercies for of all the truths without thou have showed unto thy servant for with my staff I pass over this Jordan and now I am two bands deliver me I pray thee from the hand of my brother from the hand of Esau for I fear Him leis he will come and smite me and the mother with the children and thou sayest now he is talking to God and you say I will do thee good and will make thy seed as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for a multitude oh bless the Lord bless the word Oh Glory to God so when Jacob locked God into that channel in which he said you said you going to bless me you you said my sea going to multiply and I'm scared as ever of Esau my brother God deliver [Music] [Applause] me so Jacob was caught alone angel came to him and Jacob saw the way out amen he had to get rid of everything Hallelujah including the Family Circle to be alone with God all his comfort around him is gone now stripped how many you feel stripped yeah get stripped yet it coming we're going to read about it y you're stripping coming I know you glad you're not stripped yet yet yet but it coming everybody got to be stripped and and and then when Jacob felt all alone and and the angel sat he said wrestle with that angel he said I will not let you go till you bless me Oh Glory to God and God tested him on his own words there was a big fight going on brother poell Jacob wrestling with the angel locking the angel neck wrestling rolling down all night long it wasn't a five minute wrestle it wasn't a 10-minute wrestle it was all night long until the angel said let me go let me go you're looking there desperate let me go you're looking like you really want to be changed let me go jaob said I'm not letting you go angel said let me go he said no come on S is that's what we talking [Music] about you see and some of us not fed up enough we not tired enough we're not wear enough we not move enough to transformation not move enough to be so desperate and say Lord I'm not going to let you go till you change me I want to walk out here different than I came inside of here hallelujah and we know what happened the angel touched him and immediately he walked different he couldn't walk with that proud arrogant look he walked humble Hallelujah he walked with a limp he he that that was something caused that it changed his it changed his walk and then God changed his name he didn't have the same name so if you have a new name and you have the same life something is wrong you got to check back that name because when his life was changed his name was change come on say Amen somebody you can't have a name and your Di and change glory to God a change life you have to get a new name upon that change life and you're going to have a change life this morning let's all stand and Worship the Lord Jesus is the sweet name I know hallelujah hallelujah and Hallelujah His holy name that's the reason [Music] [Applause] [Music] why Hallelujah hallu Jesus is the sweetest name I know one more time Jesus is the sweetest name I know Jesus is the sweetest name I know and he's just the same hallelujah praise God his that's the reason why I love him so hallelujah hallelujah for Jesus is the sweet name oh Hallelujah as you're about to read the scriptures may I say this it is so ironic that the people that might criticize the drums and so on they have no problems singing specials with recording with drums in it with trap set with drums and music they'll put on a a soundtrack I'd have drums in it and they could sing normal normal that's not a problem but what we have that's a problem but you know what the disaster that struck the church up in America they they had no drums in it and disaster struck things still fall apart things doesn't fall apart by drums things doesn't fall apart by you don't wear chain or you're dress long to the ground things don't fall apart by that you're message you look at messages cuz you're wearing your hairstyle one way things don't fall apart because of that Things Fall Apart when things go off of the word amen that's why Things Fall Apart and when we come back to the word things get

on now say somebody Hallelujah I wonder y healthy amen not amen no healthy Amen Let It Rumble from the inside I I love oh forgot to give the title is restoration of all things that's my title this morning restoration of all things and my inspiration is back to the Bible back to the word and I'm dead serious on that one because you have to go back to the Bible you have to read the scriptures you have to get back in the Bible you see this book is sealed and what the prophet came to do was to unseal it that we can know what is it a lot of people could say what bam said but they don't know what the Bible say so they can't tie back into the Bible but we have to be able to take the scriptures and tie back into what God Said here then it becomes alive then it becomes Quicken then it becomes scripture I think brother George tell me that brother bam said Jesus believe a drunk man it was that brother George but Jesus believe a boid preacher who he's talking about David David said I shall not see my suffer my Holy One to see corruption or see leave a soul in Hell David said that and call a back preacher and Jesus believed that word because that was God forget that back preacher forget that but when that man mov in the spirit and spoke by the spirit that was not the man come on give the Lord out come on now come on now when the spirit of God Came Upon that man you cannot touch what's coming out of here when that voice of God Rose out Hallelujah okay praise God praise God but bam said no doubt Mar of the Lamb your lovely Pastor has approached the subject many times and I know that there's going to be a bride and that there's going to be a wedding supper served in the sky just to show us God is because it's his word hallah and we know that those that are going to make up the bride is going to be his church and they're going to appear before him without spot or wrinkle and they're going to have listen watch H here we go are you ready and they have the material on earth now to make themselves [Applause] ready that amen s going light it have the material here on Earth now to make themselves ready because the Bible said his wife had made herself ready here we go notice it is said she has made ready Hallelujah so many says if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking from gambling from lying or stealing I'll serve him but that's up to you you have got something too they that overcome shall inherit all things they that overcome you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down she has made herself ready I like that word you see God here we go could not push us through a little pipe and pull us out on the other side and then say blessed is he that overcome it God cannot push you through the pipe and then come around and pull you out and say blessed is he that overcome it no his Blessing is he that pull it that is not overcome it now watch you had nothing to overcome he just pull you through but you have got to make decisions for yourself listen brother Bram I had to make a decision for myself and in doing that we show our faith and respects to God Amen when it dropped down what did Dev voice said because thou has chosen you have walked in your own choosing you have picked the precise and correct decision it is my way it is the harder way it is the narrow way oh glory to God because of this DEC ision a huge portion of Heaven awaits thee what a wonderful glorious decision thou has made this in itself is what will make and come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine Hallelujah at the end of staying with the word God will show you a continuation of the word and God will confirm the word to your life Oh Glory are you with me but the Bram saw recognizing his message the seven Angel message is to open the mystery of the seals calling the 11 our Gentile to receive the same pay that the first hour workers got and Jesus taught it he said there were some people went into the Harvest they were hired and when they did early morning receive a penny for the day noon time came and work and then at the 11th hour last hour of the day someone come in and receive the same kind of pay that they did at the first hour of the day so it's perfectly the first hour Messengers with the word with the gospel the truth they came in the day of Pentecost there was a Dark Age block them out then at the middle of the day Luther Wesley then there's to be an evening time message to receive the same thing they did at the beginning yes sir this is very important not a new thing but the same thing here we go the evening time message is to restore back again to bring back that same thing am notice the scripture you read the Disciples of John came to Jesus and said why why say the scrib the disciples came and Disciples of Jesus why say the scribes Elias must first come the answer Jesus say Elias must first Truly Come and restore all things he's talking about Malachi 4 but Elias has already come and did what he's supposed to do he's talking about John the Baptist Same Spirit of Elijah but the first thing he said Elias shall F come first come and restore all things that means we have to see a restoration of the Holy Ghost back in the church a restoration of signs wonders back into the church I'm not talking about William brandham now he had that because he was restored back to Adam before the fall pray Hallelujah but Bram was a full demonstration of a son before the fall that's why he could say before the doctor son touches my wife the true will go down the tumor goes down little fishy

God hallelujah you mean Peter like Andrew and all them yes glory to God you got to be careful how you see people that's right how you view people that's right Peter deny Christ that is true people have the recording they put it on Facebook amen perf Sprint it they talk about it they tweet it but that man going to be converted I hope you put that on Facebook too come on say Amen somebody don't just put negative put the positive also because that same man that Deni Christ that same and that curse was the front man to say these people are not drunk as you supposed but this is that that the prophet you see we have to go back to the word hallelujah we have to identify the manifestation back into the scripture Jesus I was to find the place where it is written to say the spirit is upon me we have to go back to the scripture and the bride have to find her scriptures could somebody say Amen your scripture is not church member hallelujah hallelujah sit down sit a minute you see people want to believe this message and don't go to the word is that possible yes you could believe the message as a Doctrine as a teaching as a belief that is right but for you to go to the word means that you are applying the word to your life and wherever the sword Falls it falls hallu in other words you are not doing something because somebody else is doing it you ask what does the word say well this pastor allowing this or this pastor doing that and we should do it too no what does the word say so your measurement is not another church your measurement is not another group we have no Mecca the Muslim have Mecca Mecca is where they journey to that is the they say holy Place amen amen we have a me Hallelujah we have a headquarters to where where you going at BIR you I'll tell you but Bram he says we cannot all come into one organization we cannot do that can do these little organization I think God been in it the whole thing but we are different each man sees different each person is different no two minds is exactly the same no two people is the same no two noses no two Thum prints we made different and that way we should have different groups I want to hear a Bigg amen than that amen so we can't figh for one group little group the group it doesn't have that amen that's right watch God always works with an individual he don't save you because you're Methodist he doesn't save you because you're Baptist he doesn't save you because your Pentecostal he saves you because he has dealt personally with you and you are saved on that basis that you have accepted it so therefore God could deal with you he doesn't deal with you in the order of his church he deals with you as an individual therefore when God sent forth His prophets his messengers of The Testament he spoke to one man and that man had to bring the message others went from him everywhere bringing the same messag amen or supposed to bring the same message but there had to be one headquarters God has always had it I'm thankful he's got it tonight that's the Holy Ghost not some group but the holy spirit is God's headquarters that is God's messenger of Y I want to hear a bigger amen so we have a headquarter this morning and we are connected to it so any group any church anyway want to be mecca for the bride that's that doesn't make sense they on their own somebody said a journey to that not me not us not the bride we have one headquarters could we do you know that headquarters it's the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is God's headquarters and if the Holy Ghost anoint brother Anthony you're hearing from the headquarters if the Holy Ghost anoint brother Isaac you're hearing from the headquarters and if the holy goes on your pastor you are hearing from headquarters I say this morning you are hearing from headquarters because there's going to be a restoration of all things I am going to be your God he said I will wipe away your eye tears from your [Applause] eye how much inner pain is in the heart of

you don't have a clue see a bunch of weaklings a bunch of struggl people made it m made it but Lord have mercy we like to boast how strong we are yeah we like to talk about David Samson jeffi we hardly talk about Jacob amen because Jacob speaks a lot about us who preach about Jacob Jacob gra Jo Perfection Perfection Jo Perfection we don't even understand Revelation Jacob Grace because to me if you get Grace to your life it must show extending to others you cannot have a genuine revelation of God's grace and really really take it out on somebody else because Grace means God's blood coming to your life Grace means god listen but dramatized it he talk about a man who killed a King's son amen amen the king only son not his seventh or sixth or fourth the king had one son amen and but jeram the man the king came to see the man who killed his son came to the prison why have you killed my son my only son and the man very repentance say sir I didn't mean to do it I got in a temper and I I acted and whatnot and and the man said now today you are going to be my son the king took his robe put it on that man and that man that was a condemned prisoner walk out as the King's son that is Grace I'm not hearing you maybe some of you up somewhere but that is Grace now this is what God want us to extend to others you have to have more patience H come on Hallelujah patient like God

Perfection is waiting on God and waiting for God you're waiting you're not waiting you're struggling you're waiting God is silent but you're still waiting you're not backsliding waiting you're holding on waiting under sanctification you're waiting because God gave you a promise you're [Applause] waiting Jacob hallelujah amen because he was a son yes he had the ability to hear from God that's right that's right Hallelujah that is tremendous amen hallelujah he is not changed yet but he could hear from God that's why he told God you told me to go back home you told me to go back to the word back to the Bible and I am struggling but I'm going back Hallelujah I have fears but I'm going back I have challenges but I'm going [Applause] back and I trust thank you Lord that God put upon you a burden to get back to your first love get back to an abandonment to God where you free yourself from the world and the things of the world and the environment to say God I really need you Hallelujah I need a breakthrough I need an infilling of your spirit I need an empowerment from on high hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I don't need the hands of an elder laid on me oh God I don't need a part

Israel are you the troubl man and he answered I have not troubled Israel but thou and thy father's house in that ye have forsaken the Commandments of the Lord and thou has followed bam now therefore send and gather to me all Israel on onto Mount carel and the prophets of Beal 450 and the prophets of the Grove 400 so that is 850 prophets all together which eats at Jezebel table Hallelujah you see where them prophets eaten from so Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel gathered the prophets together unto Mount carel and Elijah came unto all the people and said how long shall you halt between two opinions if the Lord be God follow him and if baale then follow him Hallelujah and the people answered him not a word there was silence then said Elijah unto the people I even I only remain a prophet of the Lord but be prophets of 450 men that's a huge comparison there let them therefore give us two Bullocks let them choose one bulock for themselves cut it in pieces lay lay it on wood put no fire under and I will dress the other block lay it on wood and put no fire under Hallelujah and call the on the name of your gods and I will call on the name of the Lord and the god that answer it by fire let him be God hallelujah then the people tongue get loose and all the people answered it is well spoken and Elijah said unto the prophets of Beal choose you one Bullock for yourselves and dress it first for ye are many and call in the name of your Gods but put no fire under and they took the bulock which was given him they dressed it calling the name of Baal from morning even until noon saying oh Baal hear us but there was no voice no any that answered and they leaped upon the altar which was made it came to pass at noon Elijah mocked them and said cry aloud for he is a God either he's just talking or or he is pursuing or he is on a journey or per Adventure he sleep at and must be waking and they cried aloud cut themselves after the manner with knives landet till blood gush out among them and it came to pass when midday was passed they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that there was neither voice nor any to answer not any that regarded and Elijah said unto the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him here we go this the part I want to get to Hallelujah and he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down keep your pages right there we not finish the first thing Elijah did was to repair the altar repair it in your home amen repair it in your house repair it in your life repair the altar of God the place where you pray husband and wife the place where you pray father and sons and children or whatever the place where you pray repair it and bring it back bring it back in the house repair restore the altar of God back into the home back into the church we having a prayer meeting and Thursday we going to repair we're going to bring back the offering up unto God incense going up unto God are you with me and Elijah took 12 Stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob unto whom the word of the Lord came saying Israel shall be thy name and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord and he made a trench about the altar as great as could contain two measures of seed he put here we go the wood in order he didn't just throw the word on the altar he put it in order and that's why the church must be set in order that's right that's why your life have to come into order there must be an order isn't that right he cut the Bullock in pieces laid him on the wood and said fill four barrels with water pour it on the bird sacrifice and on the wood he said do it the second time they did it the second time he said do it the third time and they did it the third time and the water ran about the altar he filled the trench also with water and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice Elijah the prophet came near and said listen to this prayer Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Israel let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel that I am thy servant and that listen I have done all these things at Thy word hear me oh Lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the Lord God here we go and that thou has turned their heart back again amen keep your fingers right there the Elijah's spirit is to restore and turn the hearts back to God and this is what he is praying here now watch then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust lick up the water that was in the trench and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the Lord he is the god the Lord he is the god and Elijah said unto them take the prophets of Baal let not one of them escape and they took them and Elijah brought them down to the brook Keon and slew them there may God bless the reading of his word before the fire fell before the fire fell the altar had was to be repaired the altar had was to be restored prayer had to be offered for the god that answer by fire Hallelujah let him be God and before the fire of Dynamics Falls got to be a restoration of all things a restoration of the prayer altar back in the church a restoration of s and crying and travailing and groaning for the Holy Ghost there's got to be a restoration because the opening of the word is supposed to bring us back to the Bible praise God the opening of the Mysteries thank you Lord is supposed to bring the people back Hallelujah to the word amen amen but Bram said this Moses was the word in that day because the word was given to him for that day am Mo Joseph was the word in that day portraying Christ each one of them was the word here we go are you ready but when Jesus came he was the word in its fullness because the whole Plan of Redemption laid in him the whole Plan of Redemption didn't lay in Moses didn't lay in Joseph didn't lay in Elijah they were part of the word pointing to where Hallelujah notice keep your thought here it comes as I see it the whole plan wasn't in them they were pointing to it am therefore after him the fullness here we go we cannot point to something else amen it points back to him the word so when the fullness come we can't point to some man we can't point to some group we have got to point to The Headstone himself the Capstone of divine love even Jesus [Applause] Christ so anybody point to a man or group is false it's off the word it has to be back to Christ the fullness because you have to be brought into the measure of the fullness of the stature of Christ which means you get your measure of this stature this is the fullness but you get a measure of that fullness in your life hallelujah oh Hallelujah glory to God so therefore the five4 ministry amen will take the bride amen back to the word amen back to the Bible Hallelujah isn't that right because the Bible brings on the fullness of the atonement that's what came to bring the fullness of the blood understand this the altar is where judgment strikes and because the altar has blood on it it becomes a mercy seat he said the altar was there in the Garden of Eden that's where k able come to worship he said the way back to Eden Is by The Altar and through the altar we have to come back to the altar the altar is where the sacrifices approved where your life has come on the altar stripped of ambition stripped of will stripped of Pride stripped of who you think you are and you say God consume the [Applause] sacrifice remember we talk about three things last Sunday amen hallelujah three things to make fire yeah and we talk about the word we talk about worship and we talk about sanctification it must have those three ingredients must be a Sanctified Bunch some part of this Earth God going to bring a Sanctified Bunch through you have to be Sanctified by the word God have to clean you up wash them by the washing of the Water by the word and with that you come worshiping praising God oh Hallelujah I I don't want to be quoting quoting quoting he said the Mysteries is to bring you to a spot where you have to where you could behave yourself amen that's what it's for amen not for you to go and say you have Mysteries you have knowledge because Paul handled that do I know all Mysteries do I have all knowledge and I do have the love of God I am not Z nothing zero n Paul hand that already do I have faith to move mountains nothing [Applause] still the Miracles Jesus they didn't do it no it was the cross that did it the powers in the cross that's why he went down to hell that's right that he brought the resurrection he raised the dead you think they say thank you for raising the dead come for come to us Jesus no look how live brother brah Live the Life of Christ manifest Christ do so much of Miracles and the Pentecost still hated him and rejected him they still push him aside they was impressed with the Miracles but that that St As It Go but guess what he said the message going to get in the hearts of the predestinated amen some of us wasn't even born yet some of us wasn't wrong but he knew by Vision this word can't return void God circle the Earth with this message and God had to find you in TR look where you come from look how far you come from I care if he was in the bush somewhere God have to find you if your name is on that book and pull you out God couldn't let you born in some Big Rich family God let you born under poverty God let you born under struggle God let you born wherever to make sure you get in position to hear the message this is the greatest thing you could hear this is the last message this is the final message this is a message from the angel Glory Glory you may be seated of a prophecy Hallelujah BR said th say the Lord Russia have a bump for the Vatican it's already built it's already nuclear bombs are going to be used the world is heading for a war I don't want to be part of that it going to affect the entire world we can't say we in Trinidad and we are immune from it the Bible say every island will be fled away and the island is a small thing in God so if you figure you on an island here everything is safe and nice and Dy look at the Prime Minister the budget was the $80 look at the price of oil now she can't say don't let the price fall don't sh not fall blow than 76

God just prayed but the BAM said they're going to stop diseases they're going to stop cancer they're going to stop sickness come on now come on now we not talking about talking about it we talking about [Applause] action read your Bible read your Bible read your Bible go back to the word may be seated you read the book of Mark you only seen action words Jesus healed the sick cast our Devils do this do this only action not just information not just Revelation you see we had us to go through the Revelation stage we have to go to the unfolding of the word stage but when that is over the teaching of the word time is over then it come the time of refresh sent by God Jesus must receive the Heaven Must receive Jesus until the restitution of all things so Jesus Jer have to stay up there until everything be restored until the church is restored and we have a scripture from Joel I will restore all with the Conqueror and the caterpillar and the P so the scriptures itself is lining up to restore back the church to its former glory the church had a glory That Glory was over the church when Peter walked people were healed in Peter Shadow it wasn't Peter Shadow it was the shadow of God Peter had a light in him that light was showing a shadow and when you walk under that shadow you have to be healed when Paul touch you touch them men you get healed come on now they quickening power oh I'm telling you some of you need that inside of here some of you are dead inside of here you need quickening power but there's a promise for you of the quickening power oh give the Lord some Praises people oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Glory Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah so friends we have to go back to the word we have to go back to the Bible isn't that right blessed be the name of the Lord Brother Bram said to the Lutheran age they Jud by faith the outer Court Along Came the Methodist age sanctification age they call it the second definite work of Grace which come in that age watch and now there's that's the alter age I like that that's the gring that's the Train That's the travailing you see sanctification is what you do God has not come to come and clean up your house no angel coming to sweep no broom in your house you will clean up your house you will cut the grass around your yard you will cut the grass in your heart and you will clean up your life you will do it say after me I will do it I will do it say I've got to do it do it I will do it I will do it say I've got to do it do it give the Lord a shout so the alter age is a signification age is a traviling age once we waiting in the spirit we waiting on the sanctification hallah because Dynamic is coming yes sir Hallelujah now I can say Dynamic is here and it is here it is here in the form of Promise sir but brandham had that promis Amen brother K identify his Dynamics as the spirit of Prophecy because Dynamics is Spirit but if the spirit is not here for power and demonstration it can only be here as prophecy which is taken the word and prophesying it that's what we have to do from version 10:8 to11 we have us to take from the prophet and prophesy back to the people because we don't have our own message that's why I bring the quotes that you will know I'm saying what the tape say and I'm inspired saying it and God is anointing it so there is no mistake I'm trying to say this I'm trying to say that I'm not trying to say anything but what the tape say come on get the Lord some praise His People oh Hallelujah you see I know God only confirm his word not an interpretation of it I understand that years ago that is why I start to stay and say even if I'm preaching free and know I'm preaching what the prophet said am a brother ni come and tell me I said something and he was searching to find it I was happy he did that afterward he found it because you never heard it before so even though you see I'm preaching free I'm not preaching my own thoughts you could find it back in the prophecy word years ago I purposed to do that when not preaching if I'm not quoting I'm still saying what the prophet said oh Hallelujah but I'm saying it free I'm saying what the tape say I purpose that I do that not trying to interpret it means so it means so the 10 vision and this and that and twist here and twist here and try to figure it out I'm not trying to figure out anything if God said it it have to come to pass God said there's going to be Revival it got to come to pass God said you will be formed to the word image it's got to come to pass you have to be formed in the word image before you're going to Rapture you are not in the word image right now because your trials is what going to do that and some of you a ready for that yet some of you just got a little test and you want the ball and give up Hallelujah you have to go through let's call it the Wilderness hallu you hear that only 10% amen let's call it the Wilderness the Bible said I pass them true Hallelujah it had a shortcut to go to Danel know but God send me long way to hoping hoping that the had give up on Egypt notice when the trial come let us go back to Egypt that's God afraid of every time something go you have a rock back like you have a man in the closet if your husband get trouble you go right back to that man in the closet you said kill him kill him kill him kill him kill him kill your first husband bury him I hope nobody had no man in the closet bury him that first husband that first flesh kill him so have nothing that's why when the those armies was fighting and what not the first thing to do is what blow up the bridge amen hallu no turning back these Al-Qaeda people who get radicalized them going one way you know they hoping the commotion know they going straight to paradise that's how they're thinking look like some people get radicalized in this message with hate and envy and Malice and what they radicalize it look like the life take a backseat is
