[21:19] coming out tonight if you have your
[21:20] bibles i'd like to turn to matthew
[21:22] chapter 12
[21:23] wondering from 22 to 32
[21:25] ephesians chapter 6
[21:27] reading from 10 to 19.
[21:33] matthew 12 reading from verse 22
[21:38] then was brought unto him
[21:40] one possessed with the devil
[21:42] blind and dumb and he healed him in so
[21:45] much that the blind and the dumb boat
[21:47] speak
[21:48] and saw
[21:49] and all the people were amazed and said
[21:51] is not this
[21:53] the son of david
[21:55] but when the pharisees heard it
[21:57] they said this fellow dot not cast out
[21:59] devils but by percy bob
[22:01] the prince of the devils
[22:04] and jesus knew their thoughts
[22:06] said unto them
[22:08] every kingdom
[22:10] divided against itself is brought to
[22:12] desolation
[22:14] and every city or house
[22:16] divided against itself shall not stand
[22:20] and if satan casts out satan he's
[22:22] divided against himself
[22:24] how shall then his kingdom stand
[22:27] and if i
[22:29] by belzebub cast or devils by whom do
[22:31] your children cast them out
[22:33] therefore they shall be your judges
[22:35] but if i cast out devils by the spirit
[22:38] of god
[22:39] then the kingdom of god has come unto
[22:41] you
[22:42] or else how can one enter
[22:45] into a strong man's house
[22:47] and spoil his goods
[22:49] except he first
[22:51] bind a strong man
[22:52] and when then he will spoil his house
[22:56] he that is not with me is against me
[22:58] he that gathered us with me is color
[23:00] abroad wherefore i say unto you all
[23:02] manner of sin and blasphemy shall be
[23:04] forgiven unto men but
[23:06] the blasphemy against the holy ghost
[23:09] shall not be forgiven unto men
[23:12] whosoever speaketh
[23:14] a word against the son of man shall be
[23:16] forgiven
[23:17] but whosoever speaketh against the holy
[23:18] ghost it shall not be forgiven him
[23:21] neither in this world or neither in the
[23:24] world to come
[23:25] ephesians chapter 6 reading from verse
[23:27] 10.
[23:28] finally
[23:29] my brethren be strong in the lord and
[23:32] the power of his might
[23:33] put on the whole armor of god that you
[23:36] may be able to stand against the wiles
[23:38] of the devil for we wrestle not against
[23:40] flesh and blood but against
[23:41] principalities against powers against
[23:44] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[23:46] against spiritual wickedness in high
[23:48] places
[23:49] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[23:52] of god that you may be able to to
[23:54] withstand in the evil day haven't done
[23:56] all to stand
[23:58] stand therefore having your lawyers good
[23:59] about your truth having on the
[24:01] breastplate of righteousness your feet
[24:03] shud with the preparation of the gospel
[24:05] of peace
[24:06] above all taken the shield of fate where
[24:09] he shall be able to quench all the fiery
[24:11] darts of the wicked and take the helmet
[24:13] of salvation the sword of the spirit
[24:15] which is the word of god praying always
[24:17] with all prayer and supplication in the
[24:19] spirit watching there unto it all
[24:21] perseverance and supplication of all
[24:24] saints and for me that utterance may be
[24:26] given unto me that i may open my mouth
[24:28] boldly to make known the mystery of the
[24:30] gospel may god bless his word you may be
[24:32] seated all praise be to jesus
[24:35] thank you again for coming out here
[24:37] tonight
[24:38] the advertiser the whole armor of god
[24:39] well that's what we talk about tonight
[24:41] the title is the whole armor of god
[24:43] put it on
[24:46] that's what i have at the title tonight
[24:47] the whole lamb of god put it on an
[24:50] inspiration stand therefore in other
[24:51] words hold your ground stand therefore
[24:54] hold
[24:55] your ground
[24:57] and brother branham uh going to just run
[24:59] it through
[25:00] uh he said paul is speaking here talking
[25:02] about preparing us solely for battle
[25:04] remember you have to prepare for the
[25:05] battle right
[25:06] all right but yeah they get armed you
[25:08] have to get trained for this battle and
[25:10] paul was talking about preparing a soul
[25:12] for battle the gospel you say you can
[25:14] liken into one thing on the other one
[25:16] time in hebrews he spoke about a runner
[25:18] scene we we let us lay aside the weight
[25:21] and the sin only beset us he's speaking
[25:23] of olympics he's speaking of i know he's
[25:25] speaking about ahmed men going into
[25:28] battle and how to prepare themselves and
[25:30] no nation would dare send a man on the
[25:33] battlefield untrained he might not only
[25:35] get himself killed but another group he
[25:38] doesn't know how to take a hold he must
[25:39] be prepared for it and the nations that
[25:41] are wise to that they get their men
[25:43] ready isn't that right
[25:45] praise be to jesus so before we continue
[25:48] i just want to get a prayer from the
[25:49] prophet here and he's praying
[25:52] he's a great god
[25:53] you have never lost your power you never
[25:56] will because you are the infinite god
[25:59] who had no beginning or you will never
[26:01] have an end
[26:02] when the old world has so staggered with
[26:04] sin until it come beyond the stars and
[26:07] if you have sent judgment and destroyed
[26:09] it and there's no more world no moon no
[26:11] stars no solar system you'll still be
[26:13] god when the oceans has become deserts
[26:16] weeping from sin you'll still be god and
[26:18] what is mandatory mindful of him why is
[26:20] it that you so kind to us to send jesus
[26:23] your only begotten son that he should
[26:25] die to save from our sins and then in
[26:27] this closing hours of the world's
[26:29] history when the world is staggering
[26:32] under the impact of sin and hydrogen
[26:34] bombs and atomic bombs in the hands of
[26:35] the heathen and the unbeliever and the
[26:37] ungodly who could destroy the world
[26:39] within seconds
[26:41] we are told by our modern science it's
[26:43] just one minute until midnight oh god
[26:46] wake up men and women
[26:48] anoint your ministers lord like flames
[26:50] of fire making the last call the sign of
[26:54] the last day may it be great and may we
[26:57] see it tonight
[26:58] the living christ isn't his expectation
[27:01] may we see it tonight the living christ
[27:03] who is not dead but has raised again for
[27:06] justification now lives among us in the
[27:09] person of the holy ghost
[27:12] may he come tonight and speak to every
[27:14] heart visible and invisible audience may
[27:18] he perform in their hearts that work of
[27:20] the new birth
[27:21] bring to them redemption power or his
[27:24] resurrection taking away all shadows and
[27:26] doubts and unbelief destroying all
[27:28] skepticism that the church might move on
[27:31] in perfect harmony with the will of god
[27:34] as presented by the bible and the holy
[27:37] spirit
[27:38] take the words that i shall read tonight
[27:40] from the word lord and anoint them in
[27:42] the lips of your servant place them in
[27:44] the hearts of the hearer circumcise the
[27:46] ears and hearts lord that they might
[27:48] receive thy word and then in the end
[27:50] we'll bow our heads in humility towards
[27:52] the dust from which we are taking and
[27:55] give thee praise for we ask in jesus
[27:56] name amen what a prayer
[28:00] now the first script that we read
[28:04] jesus actually said
[28:07] that satan has a kingdom
[28:12] let me read it back for you just in case
[28:13] you missed that one
[28:20] he said every kingdom divided itself
[28:22] against itself is brought to desolation
[28:25] and every city house divided against
[28:26] itself shall not stand
[28:28] and if satan casts out satan he is
[28:30] divided against himself how then shall
[28:33] his kingdom stand
[28:36] so satan has a kingdom
[28:38] a structured kingdom
[28:41] not a guest or haphazard it is
[28:43] structured
[28:45] and paul said we rather not against
[28:47] flesh and blood
[28:49] but against principalities and powers so
[28:52] the satan have order
[28:54] system and different levels of operation
[28:57] to accomplish his programs
[28:59] and design
[29:00] so without a doubt
[29:02] we are dealing with a formidable foe
[29:05] and we have to have the equipment
[29:08] to deal with this battle
[29:10] and tonight we want to get not the armor
[29:13] of god
[29:14] it was
[29:15] no no what is out of order the whole
[29:17] armor
[29:19] not armor
[29:20] but the whole armor
[29:22] you can fight with us you can fight with
[29:24] a sword and no spear you have no shield
[29:26] you can fight with this and don't have
[29:27] that you want the whole armor
[29:30] somebody ball hole
[29:32] shouted out whole again you want the
[29:34] whole armor of god
[29:36] not part of the old armor of god oh
[29:38] blessed be the name of the lord listen
[29:41] so what are we fighting for
[29:43] if we have to fight we have to fight for
[29:45] something
[29:46] if it's difficult we reach
[29:48] if it's our chairs we reach if it's not
[29:50] deacon and earlier we reach that's what
[29:52] we fighting for if it's to have press
[29:55] play we reach
[29:56] hallelujah if we have spoken books we
[29:58] reach if it's just to have church we
[30:00] reach but that is not what we fighting
[30:02] for
[30:02] that is not what jude exhorted us for
[30:05] judah exhorted the earth he fight for or
[30:07] contend for the fate
[30:08] that was once delivered to the saints
[30:10] something the church had
[30:12] noticed with all these mysteries that
[30:14] peter didn't have and paul didn't have
[30:15] and whoever didn't have we said it'll go
[30:17] back to what they had
[30:18] oh glory to god do you know what i'm
[30:20] saying
[30:21] all the new name all the mysteries seven
[30:23] seas open all what they didn't have the
[30:25] only church we have to still go back to
[30:26] what they had
[30:27] because they had the fate
[30:29] because paul explained though i know all
[30:30] mysteries have all knowledge if i don't
[30:32] have the faith to prolong charity i am
[30:34] nothing oh glory to god so to go forward
[30:37] we have to go backward
[30:39] and pick up the faith that they had
[30:41] that's why gosh is not prophet not for
[30:43] us to have mysteries and revelations and
[30:45] inspirations and knowledge and
[30:46] information but something that will take
[30:48] us back to the faith and pick it up and
[30:50] come forward and stand with that faith
[30:52] and don't give up any groan
[30:54] oh give the lord i shall stand therefore
[30:57] it means you're not giving up any groan
[30:59] every grunge you get don't give up on it
[31:02] don't back down from it because that's
[31:04] what the devil want to do move you
[31:05] backwards but you have to hold your
[31:07] ground hold steady
[31:10] oh hallelujah everything rocking but
[31:12] hold strong
[31:13] hold steady
[31:16] hallelujah we have to earnestly contend
[31:18] for the faith
[31:20] hallelujah for the that was once
[31:21] delivered to the saints not message
[31:23] people but sanctified ones as they would
[31:26] seem for now watch the beginning of the
[31:28] church it was inaugurated at pentecost
[31:31] let's look at what they had back there
[31:33] what that church contended for what they
[31:35] had lost just 33 years after the
[31:38] beginning of the church 32 years
[31:40] just 32 years you know jude wouldn't be
[31:42] talking about back in the old testament
[31:44] under
[31:45] because he was a christian so he was
[31:47] talking about the first church that was
[31:50] set in order he said now notice what
[31:52] kind of faith they had
[31:53] are you ready
[31:54] not not faith the kind
[31:58] the kind of faith they have
[32:00] they had a faith in
[32:02] a resurrected living christ
[32:06] a way to wield these words
[32:09] someone
[32:10] who rose from the dead and was living
[32:13] among them
[32:17] not for a full ministry
[32:19] not pastor teacher prophet evangelist a
[32:21] living christ
[32:22] that way temporary thunders and then
[32:24] you're worshiping the living christ him
[32:26] moving in and out among you
[32:31] watch
[32:32] someone arose from the dead was living
[32:34] among them just the same as he was
[32:36] before he ever died
[32:37] they wasn't contending for some
[32:39] historical affair they wasn't contending
[32:41] for they would come from a living christ
[32:44] a resurrected one who was in their midst
[32:48] so when christ come back amidst the
[32:50] bride then brother branham's prophecy
[32:52] will be fulfilled
[32:54] we don't need to get back brother
[32:55] branham we don't need to come back to
[32:58] open any mystery that doesn't make sense
[33:01] alas is already come
[33:03] what you need is a fulfillment of the
[33:05] prophet's prophecy
[33:06] so when he said i longed to see a church
[33:08] with jesus walking in it so when you see
[33:11] jesus walking in it then we know that's
[33:13] the church the prophet was coming for
[33:16] that's the church rather he wanted to
[33:17] see but that is the church jesus is
[33:19] coming for
[33:21] oh glory to god because you have to pay
[33:23] and then to come
[33:24] isn't that right
[33:25] so watch they were contending for living
[33:28] christ
[33:29] a resurrected one who was in their midst
[33:32] so why raise up a man
[33:35] right glorify number six why put a crown
[33:37] on number six
[33:39] when you're supposed to see this some
[33:40] number seven
[33:43] the living christ
[33:45] why people want a man
[33:48] pour us at a man
[33:51] now when he rose from the dead
[33:53] what he done the same thing he rose from
[33:54] the dead through the apostles
[33:57] what he did the same thing
[33:59] shelter same thing
[34:00] it's the same thing
[34:02] not a new thing the same thing
[34:05] that he was doing through the apostles
[34:07] he was doing the same thing
[34:09] let's go
[34:11] through the apostle he did before he
[34:13] died even greater and more of it so you
[34:15] had a little while the world see it be
[34:17] no more
[34:18] yet he shall see me the church the
[34:19] believer i'll be with you even in you to
[34:22] the end of the world now
[34:23] what was
[34:26] now that was what the apostles believed
[34:29] and they believe
[34:30] that what he was in the
[34:32] flesh he also was more in the spirit
[34:38] so there's jesus walking in galilee here
[34:41] he will the sick raise the dead multiply
[34:43] bread and everything else that same
[34:44] jesus was known among them in spirit
[34:48] the world can't see him
[34:50] praise god the church but the church
[34:52] seeing him the apostles know he's alive
[34:55] he tell them go and tell my disciple i'm
[34:57] not dead
[34:58] i'm raised from the dead he's the one
[35:01] that could pass you walls he's the one
[35:02] that can make his appearance tonight and
[35:05] he'll leave this and deliver you off
[35:06] this and free you of this and baptize
[35:08] you with it he's the one to do that
[35:12] do you believe that
[35:14] because you have to believe it you know
[35:16] hallelujah
[35:18] so watch they believe
[35:20] that what he was in the flesh he was
[35:22] also more in the spirit
[35:24] that is what they taught
[35:26] so this was what isaac this was taught
[35:29] to them
[35:31] you see what the expectation was
[35:33] you see what paul said i didn't come
[35:34] among you
[35:36] after the flesh
[35:37] i come to see jesus christ i'm crucified
[35:40] i don't want to know any man after the
[35:42] flesh and he said my preaching and
[35:44] teaching was not with enticing words of
[35:45] man wisdom and the purpose was that your
[35:47] faith wouldn't rest in flesh but your
[35:49] faith will rest in the power of god so
[35:51] when you see the power of god you will
[35:52] know that is where your faith is
[35:53] supposed to arrest him you could plug
[35:55] into that you can access that you know
[35:58] that is for you you could take it home
[36:00] with you tonight you could have it in
[36:01] your house you can have it in the
[36:03] kitchen in your bedroom and your
[36:04] bathroom wherever you go i'll never
[36:06] leave you i'll never forsake you but the
[36:08] power of god is with you no weapon form
[36:10] against you will prosper i will not
[36:12] leave you comfortless i'm gonna come to
[36:14] you this is why they will see at me no
[36:16] more but you are gonna see me because i
[36:18] let you shall live also at that day you
[36:20] shall know or give the lord some praises
[36:23] tonight
[36:24] hallelujah praise god hallelujah that is
[36:27] what they taught that is what they
[36:29] believe
[36:30] that is what they practiced and that is
[36:32] what god confirmed
[36:34] oh glory to god
[36:36] they taught it they believe it they
[36:39] practice it and god confirm it
[36:42] oh give the lord a praise this night
[36:44] hallelujah
[36:46] let's continue
[36:48] during this time 32 years of lapse
[36:51] there become many false brethren raised
[36:54] up and brought in heresies just like
[36:56] today
[36:59] many
[37:01] false
[37:02] people in the message
[37:05] false as ever
[37:07] and they are spoken with books someone
[37:09] in person play and all
[37:10] but false
[37:13] brethren
[37:14] that is not unbelievable baptism
[37:16] brethren
[37:18] bringing heresies
[37:20] false teachings false doctrines
[37:23] false revelation
[37:29] and brought in heresies and brought a
[37:31] people off to theology
[37:34] and different things
[37:35] and paul i think of him laying there
[37:37] they come they told him this little jew
[37:39] with his hook nose laying there in
[37:40] prison the chains around him wrong his
[37:42] anchor and so forth he said well
[37:44] someone's preaching for gain some is
[37:46] turning other disciples aside then they
[37:48] begin to organize and a great
[37:50] organization and here was his
[37:52] credentials he said i have so many marks
[37:53] on my body that was put there i've been
[37:55] in perils upon the sea i've been perils
[37:57] among false brethren all these different
[37:59] things that he showed was marks his
[38:01] credentials before god he suffered for
[38:03] the cause of christ therefore
[38:05] god help us to have that type of
[38:07] credential today and let us contend for
[38:10] the faith the true faith that was once
[38:13] delivered to the saints the saints
[38:14] believe in the debt burial and
[38:16] resurrection they believe in the baptism
[38:18] of the holy spirit
[38:22] there's a strange thing today
[38:23] they believe in the baptism holy spirit
[38:25] the early church believe it you believe
[38:27] it then content for it content for with
[38:30] the baptism of the holy spirit they
[38:31] believe it you have to contend for it oh
[38:34] glory to god so we fight in for the
[38:36] faith right then who's the enemy
[38:38] let's see who the enemy is
[38:40] we know our enemy
[38:42] brethren i have i have led away from
[38:44] doctrine he said i've got to say this
[38:48] any enemy you say any person
[38:51] any church
[38:52] any organization any individual that
[38:56] reasons against
[38:57] one punctuation of god's word is your
[39:00] enemy
[39:04] it takes the word to defeat the enemy
[39:07] so don't shift the punctuation
[39:09] don't shift what the prophets say don't
[39:11] shift what in the bible before they talk
[39:13] the prophet said tell them let's show
[39:15] you any bible
[39:17] because the prophet come to reveal the
[39:18] bible
[39:21] a mystery scripture a previously hidden
[39:23] truth no divinely revealed and with the
[39:26] revelation of a supernatural element but
[39:28] a scripture a hidden truth
[39:30] being unveiled or revealed so it has to
[39:32] be back to the word
[39:34] or back to the bible
[39:35] so let me say it again any person
[39:38] any church
[39:40] any organization from trinidad or older
[39:42] trinidad
[39:45] any individual from trinidad or ultra
[39:47] trinidad
[39:50] that reasons against one
[39:52] punctuation of god's word is your enemy
[39:55] it takes the word
[39:57] to defeat the enemy
[39:59] so what we supposed to look for
[40:02] and then he but abram talked about moses
[40:04] was not permitted to take the churn of
[40:05] israel into promised land because he
[40:07] failed
[40:08] moses what he failed
[40:13] go talking let the air to moses
[40:15] but he failed
[40:17] and the church organization denomination
[40:20] has failed
[40:21] prophecy you ready they will not take
[40:24] the church over
[40:26] god will raise up a new system
[40:29] and enter the non-national system
[40:32] by by what by the power of god
[40:36] not by books not by everybody press play
[40:39] no
[40:40] a new system
[40:42] by the power of god
[40:44] hallelujah
[40:46] that will take the church into the
[40:47] promised land
[40:49] so the church has to be taken into the
[40:50] promised land god dropped moses like a
[40:52] hot potato and said more than my servant
[40:54] is dead no joshua take them people over
[40:57] oh glory to god and i say tonight

[41:04] kind of ice in it but it's our land
[41:07] and we're gonna fight for it we'll give
[41:09] the lord a praise
[41:10] oh glory to god in many many men
[41:13] hallelujah it's an organization and the
[41:16] nomination has messed it up each one
[41:18] after their own theology each one after
[41:20] their own way of thinking but god will
[41:22] take his holy spirit and will raise up
[41:24] his joshua's plural and will take the
[41:27] church to the promise with no
[41:29] denominational strings tied anywhere but
[41:32] will take over his church that's a true
[41:34] anointed joshua faithful ministry we'll
[41:37] give the lord a shout
[41:39] god's commanded officers
[41:42] hallelujah
[41:43] give the lord a shout in the house
[41:46] he would raise up his joshuas by his
[41:49] holy spirit
[41:50] to take the people over
[41:52] moses had failed he was a lawgiver
[41:54] joshua's call of grace he took the
[41:56] church on we find out that joshua
[41:58] knowing his commission knowing that it
[42:00] laid in his hands god had called him for
[42:02] a duty and he must not fail he walked
[42:05] softly before god
[42:06] and when he called the people together
[42:08] and told him that god had commissioned
[42:10] him watch the request of the people they
[42:11] said we will follow you as we did moses
[42:14] if we can see the same thing that
[42:16] followed moses following you

[56:24] up here
[56:26] above
[56:27] back behind but in them
[56:31] so brother branham oh my brother is just
[56:33] the holy spirit
[56:35] he he laid out in such a way to show you
[56:38] it could be in front
[56:39] it could be above you know people like a
[56:41] picture they have a light over the
[56:42] head they're lighting them
[56:45] we don't know
[56:47] have actually side
[56:48] and they pose in really light like if
[56:50] it's instagram they're posing
[56:54] this is scarier
[56:56] when i read in harvest time how about
[56:59] in in harvest time he said that you will
[57:01] get a supernatural offer
[57:03] to
[57:04] some gift some kind of thing for people
[57:06] to follow you
[57:07] is that what you want you want some big
[57:09] ministry anything yeah
[57:12] when them fellas were following christ
[57:14] with all the ministry they had this
[57:15] christ ministry that god gave him a
[57:16] lease on just hold that
[57:18] do you have all the ghosts
[57:21] shall we like elijah thank you
[57:24] all of a sudden anointed fifa fire
[57:27] of all the fire they want to burn
[57:28] somebody
[57:30] just saying you didn't know what spirit
[57:32] you have
[57:34] a little blessing again you want to do
[57:36] your own thing and run you want to get
[57:37] lighter your spiritual
[57:40] next minute they see somebody preaching
[57:42] and you're not with them shall we stop
[57:43] him
[57:45] she said lizzie man alone the man
[57:46] talking about me
[57:48] is the iranian coming against me if
[57:49] you're preaching about me
[57:50] but abraham revealed they were jealous
[57:52] of the man
[57:53] the man was doing something they wasn't
[57:54] doing and they find they supposed to be
[57:56] in charge of he
[58:00] that's the problem there no they want a
[58:02] holy school tale
[58:04] and because the man independent they say
[58:05] i probably shall we stop him
[58:07] because you know jesus between you and i
[58:08] you know me
[58:10] we in front we are disciples right right
[58:12] jesus
[58:14] jesus straighten them out
[58:19] what so each one backing one another up
[58:22] with him the chief captain
[58:25] not out here in front
[58:27] up here above
[58:29] back behind them but in them
[58:31] that's the army
[58:33] vindicating
[58:34] physically what i'm still reading
[58:37] finnick is in what his resurrection
[58:40] by proof of his works
[58:43] how else could people know he's raised
[58:45] from the dead if
[58:46] not the works of jesus has not been done
[58:50] when the works of jesus be made manifest
[58:52] it's evidence
[58:53] this is jesus
[58:55] it's not flesh and blood
[58:58] then brother branham sticking saint john
[59:00] 14 12. jesus said
[59:02] he that believeth on me the books that i
[59:04] do shall he do also what is it it is god
[59:08] in the church
[59:10] in these five
[59:11] predestinated offices
[59:14] backing up every word that he said
[59:17] with the holy spirit himself in deer
[59:20] which is the word made manifest
[59:23] proving his resurrection
[59:25] to when he lives
[59:26] in these men
[59:28] so watch but the banham says there's no
[59:31] moving faculty past the eyes
[59:33] he was the eyes he's the seer
[59:35] next is the intelligence
[59:37] so the intelligence have to come down
[59:40] the intelligence is not separated from
[59:41] your head from your brains the
[59:43] intelligence needs a body to walk
[59:44] through
[59:47] so the fightful ministry will be a
[59:49] channel that the intelligence of god
[59:50] could drop down
[59:51] and walk through his body
[59:54] and move out to the bride
[59:55] oh glory to god hallelujah and then you
[59:58] will see evidence of the intelligence
[1:00:01] which is to know what god wants done
[1:00:03] with the word
[1:00:04] and that is the supreme anointing
[1:00:06] knowing what and how oh give the lord a
[1:00:08] shout do you understand that tonight
[1:00:10] it's not just making a racket and a
[1:00:12] bunch of noise but clarity to know what
[1:00:15] and how he said the bride the secret is
[1:00:17] the word is the bride then she has what
[1:00:19] the mind of christ what's that the
[1:00:20] intelligence
[1:00:21] to know what he wants done with the word
[1:00:25] oh give the lord some praises
[1:00:27] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah do you
[1:00:29] see it tonight
[1:00:31] so what she said the holy spirit himself
[1:00:32] in there which is the word made manifest
[1:00:34] proven his resurrection proving that he
[1:00:36] lives
[1:00:39] all other religions are dead their forms
[1:00:42] are dead there's only one that's right
[1:00:44] that's christianity because christ is a
[1:00:47] living in the church
[1:00:49] making his word manifest for he is the
[1:00:52] same and if the same word it will do the
[1:00:55] same thing and show the same works and
[1:00:57] the same signs
[1:01:00] matthew 28 says so
[1:01:01] be with his army that great word general
[1:01:04] triumph in us

[1:01:21] conquered debt

[1:01:33] fortification
[1:01:36] of god's army they say on uk and they're
[1:01:39] begging for guns at one time they
[1:01:41] stopped people from signing up to the
[1:01:43] army because they know what happens to
[1:01:44] them
[1:01:47] god is not that yeah

[1:07:48] all this
[1:07:49] god
[1:07:50] packed in
[1:07:52] the baptism of the holy ghost with what
[1:07:54] which speaking in tongues into petition
[1:07:56] that don't god put that all inside
[1:07:58] speaking in tongues interpretation of
[1:08:00] tongues prophecies gifts and all kind of
[1:08:02] things that may seem hard in training
[1:08:06] but brother
[1:08:07] on the battlefront
[1:08:09] every one of them's got to be used
[1:08:12] god equips his soldiers exactly what it
[1:08:15] takes to use
[1:08:16] and they might say just live in
[1:08:18] psychology that won't work no sir that's
[1:08:20] as thin as i brought me to the shell of
[1:08:22] a chicken that started dead so that's no
[1:08:24] good

[1:10:02] right in you
[1:10:06] the all-wise god knowed how to equip his
[1:10:10] army
[1:10:11] he equipped it with the baptism of the
[1:10:13] holy ghost that's exactly what he sent
[1:10:15] for these last days
[1:10:17] he knew
[1:10:19] that we have to have it
[1:10:21] but upon she had a bomb here he knew
[1:10:24] that people would reason
[1:10:26] would go to reading this word when it
[1:10:28] come on print out here
[1:10:31] that that it would happen
[1:10:34] oh
[1:10:35] you mean we had this poke book it's on
[1:10:36] print
[1:10:38] yes
[1:10:38] so he know that because it's on print it
[1:10:41] will work up mr reason and the lecture
[1:10:44] go get inspired because it can print and
[1:10:47] they could figure it out mix it out drag
[1:10:50] it out i'm going to say it again this he
[1:10:53] knew that we'd have to have it what the
[1:10:55] holy ghost he knew that people reason
[1:10:57] would go to reading this word when it
[1:10:59] become in print out here what would
[1:11:02] happen and today we find people saying
[1:11:04] well no where is the god of history
[1:11:06] where is a god across the red sea where
[1:11:07] is the god that healed the sick you see
[1:11:09] what good does it do to give a canary
[1:11:11] bird vitamins
[1:11:12] i'm making off strong winds and keeping
[1:11:13] my cage
[1:11:15] that's what they try to do with people
[1:11:16] feed them all kind of things vitamins
[1:11:18] and thing and they clear fly and they're
[1:11:20] getting seeds mysteries all kinds of
[1:11:22] they catch up
[1:11:25] bumping up the wings but
[1:11:27] the trap then we know
[1:11:30] hallelujah
[1:11:31] glory to god are you with me
[1:11:34] the first thing you know tell them all
[1:11:35] the days a miracle is past you're pinned
[1:11:37] up in some little thing like that it's a
[1:11:38] lie i'm reading
[1:11:41] christ is the same yesterday and forever
[1:11:44] here we go are you ready almost done
[1:11:46] god knowed musician come on please
[1:11:49] it would take the baptism of the holy
[1:11:51] ghost to prove his latter-day signs
[1:11:58] let me read that again
[1:12:00] god
[1:12:01] knows it will take
[1:12:03] the baptism of the holy ghost to prove
[1:12:06] his latter day signs and that is why
[1:12:09] they don't want to emphasize dynamics
[1:12:11] spirit baptism they don't want to do
[1:12:13] that they can't produce it they don't
[1:12:14] want to go deer because it ruins their
[1:12:17] intellectual influence
[1:12:19] and their intellectual teaching and
[1:12:21] preaching and that's why we said on
[1:12:23] sunday teaching can do it
[1:12:25] christ did something among them
[1:12:27] that make them know that he's the same
[1:12:30] it's not it was supernatural satan knows
[1:12:32] still continue that reasoning and where
[1:12:35] reason lays yes sir to be an effectual
[1:12:38] witness
[1:12:39] of his resurrection
[1:12:41] he knowed it will take the holy ghost
[1:12:44] cause man cannot do these things
[1:12:47] he equipped his army with the holy ghost
[1:12:49] to do those things to make known the
[1:12:51] seekers of the heart as he promised you
[1:12:53] can't do it with any kind of training
[1:12:55] you've got to do it by the baptism
[1:12:57] of the holy spirit
[1:12:59] the armor of god
[1:13:00] and this is the even light to make
[1:13:02] hebrews doesn't it a reality it will
[1:13:05] take more than a training
[1:13:07] you can read words
[1:13:08] and read words
[1:13:10] and read words he said three times
[1:13:12] and it will never make it come to pass
[1:13:15] until you have the holy ghost here to
[1:13:18] manifest that
[1:13:20] that word reading again by terence
[1:13:22] this is brother branham you can read
[1:13:24] words
