prayers of the orders of the saints any man so we know that whatever we we get what we expect amen and what have we put in is what we get out of the revival so you men wanna continue by the grace of God but let's turn over now for an exhortation second Kings chapter 2 let's read from verse 6 talking about Elijah and Elijah here amen and it says and Elijah said unto him Terry I pray thee here for the Lord had sent me to Jordan and he said as the Lord liveth and I soul ever I will not leave thee and they too went on and 50 men of the son of the prophets went and stood to view far off and they too stood by Jordan and Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smooth the waters they were divided hither and thither so that they too went over on dry ground and it came to pass when they were gone over and Elisha said unto Elisha ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee and Elijah said I pray thee let a double portion of the Spirit be upon me and he said I was asked a hard thing nevertheless if they'll see me when I am taken from be I shall be so it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be soon and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold they've appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire and parted them both asunder and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven mine they were just talking and then something dropped down in their myths and he said and Elijah saw it and he cried my father my father the child of Israel and the horsemen their oven he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces he took up also the mantle of Elijah and fell that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and said where is the Lord caught of Elijah and when he had also smitten the waters they parted hither and thither and Elijah went over and verse 50 says and when the son of a prophet of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him they said the spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elijah and they came to meet him about themselves to the ground before him Makana blessing to the ring of his word tonight he made me you might be seen a man okay you man threes good Amanda lovin tonight amen glory will have a title here tonight just for a small exhortation before we have a time of Prayer tonight and we want to eman continue in the Lord Jesus Christ amen for a revival that is yet ahead amen but our title where is the Lord God of Elijah amen that's my title to name where is the Lord God of Elijah he men any men it's a question and Elijah is asking here in this scripture we just read Amen praise God amen and he journeyed for a long time with Elijah he saw miracles he saw signs he saw wonders from first kings where we pick up this Elijah character amen and we know the Lord told Elijah to go down on anoint Elisha and Elijah was in his daily routine I suppose he'd get up every morning and plow the capital and and and and keep the land and till the soil and he was just doing his part was just doing what he thought was right keeping that straight line but there was something about Elijah that God loved there was something that he liked about Elijah that Elijah himself did not know Amen hallelujah but he was appointed praise God he had an appointment to meet the supernatural he had an appointment to meet the unseen he had an appointment to meet caught for himself Oh hallelujah didn't matter who was around him a man caught his life was predestinated and when the time was right when the moment was right Elijah hallelujah was inspired by God or heart to go down and to speak to this young man Oh Holly Holly and dropped a mantle upon him it was no talk it was no explanation Elijah didn't go down there to have some big long conference or to explain something no no no Elijah went down there to get Elijah Elijah buy an experience and that's what we got to come to friends all this talk about the pile of all his talk about this and talk about that but it's got to come down to an experienced something that anchors you in your heart and in your soul and in your life hallelujah amen isn't that right it's something that wakes you up in the morning it's something that inspires you when you wake up you feel like Oh in a church you feel like worshiping God why because there's an experience that you have there's an experience that you met your God that you know caught for yourself Oh hallelujah that's what makes it real that's what makes it living that's what makes it alive that is what makes it more and just come into church that's what makes it more than just people saying you've got to pray and you've got to do this and you've got to do that but you met something real you met something real Halla anointed inspired of God spirited uplifting something that was not from the natural something that you encountered something that you know is not human being it wasn't science it wasn't your mother it wasn't your father it was a magic it was poor but doing something for you Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen amen me and my dad was talking and he said he was testifying to somebody and he said that they was talking about him saying that they it lost faith in Christianity and he said oh I soul and he was talking about how that you know they heard that Jesus Christ died on a tree and they got confused because he heard somebody say he got died on a cross so is it a tree or is it a cross and Jesus said and dad said well what are you worried about what you want to be concerned about is the fact that he died he tried to take your place doesn't matter they say it's a cross it's a tree praise God it's the same thing don't worry about it the most important thing you need to know is that Jesus died for your sins because you were supposed to die but he took your place you are supposed to die but the core of love was broken for your sakes his blood poured out so that you could have a chance to be called the sons of God oh that you could shout that you could say man that you could say hallelujah that's the grace of God to us that is the most important thing tonight Oh glory to God the fact that Jesus died for us is what brings us into fellowship and the Prophet said you cannot have fellowship unless you have something common to fellowship about and the most common thing we have tonight is that the blood of Jesus that forgive me can also forgive you and if God forgive me then why can't I forgive you oh why can't I love you brother why can't I love you sister why can't I pray for you Oh hallelujah oh but a blood of Jesus I've made us kings and priests we were strangers we were foreigners we were strange we were lost in the world we were lost and undone without God his son but then he reached out his hand for me are you telling me I can't praise God you gotta be kidding me I'm gonna make such a noise when I come into the house of God I'm gonna worship I'm gonna praise God every day like it's Sunday Oh hallelujah praise calling man oh praise Him when I'm sick I praise Him when I'm wearing I praise them and I'm pizza Oh hallelujah I'm still praise Him he's still my god and if I die I'm going to heaven please tell my god the devil still loose he's still defeated tonight we serve a risen god oh the cross has broken the enemy tonight oh we are free free to lift our hands with the same man free to worship with a shout through the dance with the let God know how much we love him how much we appreciate him free to love our brother with a lover sister free to pray for one another we are free man hallelujah who does son of man set free it's free and appraised so were Christians and we're proud of it because of a sacrifice that one man made and all the world went free you understand when Jesus died when he paid the price an instant transaction took place right there instant transaction the veil the Bible said the veil to the temple as rent from the top to the bottom not the bottom to the top it wasn't a man that taught of hail it was cause that tort of hill the same field of shadow was test to go in the presence of God God flip the page now it's dead to stay out of that presence hole holla but in that presence is life in that presence is peace in the presence is joy in that presence is where we are tonight in the presence of Almighty God in his presence of sick of heal the terror raise the blind shield the cripples walk the tongue Oh somebody tell me about my core tonight he is a God of miracles the part of armies the core of wonder the court of power he still fills with the Holy Ghost he could do it tonight he could do it right now and God knows we need it tonight the Lord taught of Elisha hallelujah hallelujah prophet said and in that time he was looking at different denominational movements and he was talking about how they wanted a cry for revival different movements wanted to cry for revival the oneness and the Baptist and different ones Pentecostalism they were printing Flyers and they were putting out big message messages billboards and things saying come to the Reviver we want a revival prophet said as a cry going out for revival it's now right he said the world knows that the end is near hallelujah hallelujah the Spirit of God moving upon the earth looking for people that he could use a spirit is useless any spirit it's useless tonight unless it has a body that it could use know ye not tonight that you are the temples of the Holy Spirit the devil is looking for people and he could influence that he could holla drive to do this and to do that and to perform crime the for murder and rape and burglary is looking for people and he could use the destroy lives and to tear our homes and the same way that the devil is looking for people God is looking for people tonight he could use he could fill with his holy spirit the closer you get to God it's a more God could speak to you go here go there do this he is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to twelve Oh hallelujah hallelujah that you could hear the desires of God Oh hallelujah and speak them and express them and believe them and then you yourself become a living manifestation of God on the earth in this wicked and adulterous age God is going to raise up sons and daughters Oh hallelujah they might look ordinary they might feel ordinary but what is inside of them is not ordinary it is so explosive that when they speak it will create itself just like that it is an anointing oh you don't hear me tonight what's laying inside of your soul is an anointing come from God wait to see the perfection it's a seed of adoption she's gonna be a people on the earth that shall be adopted Oh hallelujah you're gonna walk like Jesus you're gonna talk like Jesus I don't care if you don't see like it God promised to bring you out with a mighty hand

it gives you action it makes you feel to pray makes you feel to worship makes this is a shout when I think of the goodness of Jesus and what he did for me I was lost I was until I was no party without Jesus but he died for me he paid a price so that I could receive the gift of his spirit what then shall we say to these things if God be for us who can be against us oh we are more than conquerors through him that loved us through him that overcame ojala overcame the luxury world lust of the eyes pride of life he overcame and Jesus and he will overcome in you tonight if you put your trust in him Oh give him a shout of praise hallelujah hallelujah what's no talk session Elijah come down with a mantle and the power of God and he dropped it upon your life he didn't have an explanation of talk he didn't pull in one side and say you know what church I go to you don't wear a shirt like that would you wear a name no no you just dropped something on him pull it off hallelujah and that experience that wants one little brief moment so many it might not seem like something fancy maybe somebody might say I'll serve God if I see him open the skies up or I'll serve God if I see him split open the river but this man just receive a touch all it took from God was a touch from the Lord and that convinced Elijah enough to tell to turn on his cattle and to burn the plow hollow you put away the oxen he said I'm gonna follow you I'm gonna go where you go I'm gonna serve your God I'm gonna follow after you as long as you live nice to live it I will not leave thee hallelujah honey I'm gonna

in Hollis now right yes last night was a supermoon praise God I don't know couple you've all heard about it I don't know what it means but overall it says another interpreter of these things well we know we live in a spiritual time God is on the move French don't you ever be mistaken hold on it might seem quiet it might seem like nothing's moving but the Prophet said that's the time to be sitting of God Oh hallelujah very certain of God oh and I'm convinced tonight I caught is on the move Oh Lord don't leave me out whatever it is you're to in Tennessee don't do it without me but remember me or not remember my family remember my loved ones remember my brother my sister remember me or Lord I'm standing in need of prayer I'm standing in either deliverance I'm standing in need of the Holy Ghost and fire in my walk in my talk in my life I want my wife to see it I want my family to see it I want my whole ones to see it they need to see Jesus in me that's the only thing I will call them out of this world and to the resurrection talk is cheap time for talk is over brother - stay here Elijah said no I'm not staying okay if your prophecy I felt something and I wanted I've got to have it and whatever you got it's not here where I am it's where you are praise God it's this common sense if I stay here I don't think I'm gonna get it but if I go where you go if I stay where you stay the Prophet said if you want a Holy Ghost come around people who have the Holy Ghost praise God a man and some will come upon you brother hallelujah hallelujah if you sleep with the dogs you get the fleas

real desire and I feel tonight Friends of the Holy Spirit it's asking us this very same same question tonight what do you want what is your desire Jesus asked the people to his ministry many times he walked the streets yet he knew that condition he knew they were blind some of them hold lame different conditions isn't alright but yet still he with a system will Tom be made whole he said give him a choice he's taking the opportunity to ask whatever you have need of why because the I am that I was inside of him and whatever you have meet up you have to put it inside of there to make it come to life if you need healing I am your healer then he said what do you want hallelujah hallelujah praise is not pretty will down be made whole please God is not right you would ask a question and they say yes Jesus I want to be made whole I want to be made well I'm blind I have no man to put me in the pool help me Lord Jesus save me and as soon as they utter those words here come Jesus to their rescue hallelujah praise to bind up the brokenhearted to bring liberty to the captives to heal the sick Oh hollow tube raise the dead cast out Devils Oh hallelujah it was Jesus on the scene and it'll be

that tonight amen amen please gone what we wanna see this gone we want to see this God in the church we want to see this God move upon our young people now that it just come to a service but at the power of God will be so milky it would break their hearts and it would scream and come to the altar and demons will run out of their heart screaming coming to repentance coming to the pillar of fire some to the water some to the flood all to reply all it all to the Holy Ghost baptism that's how you gotta come there's only one way to come to it jesus said I am the door I am the way I am the truth I am the life no man could come to the Father unless it come to me but he told his disciples tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high Mary had to receive it Peter had to receive it yeah Peter walked on water but he still had to get on his knees and you see the same Holy Ghost in his heart and in his soul hallelujah every one of them do we see the same penny did you see the same spirit or they were none of his Harley but he identified himself he made himself known to among them by his power and by his glory by the vindication of his word for that time a man is now right a man i'm closing and here it was Elijah sin he likes you told him I want to top a portion a man all right and he like just said you ask a hard thing but nevertheless if you see me go you can have what you see and so Elijah was now on double alert praise God because he had to see him go he didn't know when he didn't know where he didn't know how he just had to keep his eyes on the target he just had to keep his eyes on the prize he just had to stay very focused and that's what we've got to do tonight don't look to the left don't look to the right keep your eyes on Jesus keep your eyes towards Calvary keep your head to one heaven I get your pants legs maggot at the knees and stay there until go to something for us tonight after all this coming and going it's got to point
