feels good in here this evening amen you love the Lord thank you Jesus blessed be his name you know before you have your seats thank you for coming this evening um and you know I just want to thank the pastor for the the opportunity to share a few Thoughts with you amen I pray that it blesses you I pray that it helps you along the journey that we are on Amen so before we have our seats um if you could get your Bibles and we look at a few verses of a scripture in the Book of Proverbs reading from chapter 3 veres 1 to 8 as we look at for now amen um and reading from verse one and it says my son forget not my law but let thine heart keep my Commandments for length of days and long life and peace shall they add to thee let not mercy and Truth forsake thee bind them about thine neck write them upon the table of thine heart so shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not onto thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy path amen be not wise in thy own eyes fear the lord and depart from Evil it shall be Health to thy Naval and Marrow to thy bones and we'll pause there for now let's just bow our heads oh Heavenly Father this evening Lord we counted such a awesome some privilege to gather together in this way Lord Lord we could have been doing so many other things right now Lord but you predestinated us to be here this time Lord Lord we pray that your holy spirit will move throughout this Camp Lord and and touch the lives and touch hearts Lord Lord touch the very beings that are gathered here Lord those that are connected on the internet those that may even interact with this content afterwards Lord I pray that your holy presence and your spirit be with them Lord Lord meet the needs of your people those that might might be sick those that may need a special touch Lord those that may be feeling down and out today Lord Lord the backsliders those those that might be weak that may just need a little extra push Lord I pray that you be with them Lord and you raise them up and lift them up Lord we thank you for your people gathered here tonight and we know you have something special in store for them I pray that you will anoint my lips Lord Lord the singers have already sung and worship has gone forth Lord Lord and and it's time for your presence to pause among your people we've gathered together under expectation not just to hear words not just to see each other or talk about you Lord but we want to come into communion and and have True Fellowship Lord we come because we're needy Lord we come because we have expectations Lord and you left promises that we want to be able by faith to believe and catch a hold of Lord Lord we come for our special portion as individuals tonight Lord Lord we pray that you will pour out over your people gathered in Jesus name we pray we be careful to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory amen amen amen you may have your seats amen you love him so just for a title um the title tonight is God's provided way I know the prophet would have preached this message a couple times but this is how I F LED tonight you know I pray that God will anoint the words and the thoughts that are put together and be a blessing to you and for subject lean not onto thine own understanding and and reading the scripture the scripture described it as one of the most beautiful scriptures he ever read it's a powerful scripture in Proverbs yeah and what I would Endeavor to do this evening is to really go through parts of the scripture um I hope it doesn't sound too much like a Bible study but I think it's it's relevant to us right now tonight amen so I want to just start things off uh from from a message of the same title in 26 he said now there's only two ways of anything not three not four just two he say that's the right way and the wrong way there's no in between either hot or you're cold either black or white you say and them ways are your ways and God ways so that cancel out your ideas and opinions immediately it has nothing to do with you it doesn't have to do with how you feel or or or or who invited you tonight or why you're here or why something happened yesterday is either his way or your way you have to choose he said you can't be in your way and God's way at the same time so his word is clear you can't be a a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways we can't be two plac at the same time amen so you got to forget your own way to get in God's way and you got to get out of your own way to get in God's way for as long as you're in your own way you're out of his way amen so we understand that this is his word now so forsake your ways forsake your thought forsake everything and just rely one thing on thus said the Lord that's all then you know you're right though you can't see it none of the senses will say it's right everyone will say it's wrong but you know it's right because God said so amen because he said it you know it's right has nothing to do with how you feel or what time it is or what kind of day you had yesterday but God said so so it's right that's what we want to stand on the word of God that's what makes it right the fact that it's God's word now that's his provided way it has been his word it is his word God's provided way for the human to live is not by your senses it's not by how you feel taste touch scare smell no no no no no it's by his word and his word can't lie it's the same yesterday today and forever if he promised it yesterday he will keep the promise today is not going to change his mind he's not going to change the way he feels about you he knows you didn't come in here 100% you didn't come in here a perfect man but that's why he called you to perfect you to deal with you to carry you through to build your character into somebody that he could [Applause] use I remember brother Anthony just Sunday speaking about it he spoke about Joseph he said despite what he went through Hallelujah the jealousy the slavery the the prison experience even being forgotten in jail God's provided way was to place him in a position that he could bring Deliverance to his people so it didn't matter where he went it didn't matter where he was placed or what he went through at the end of the day God's provided way is beyond what we could ask or think or imagine or conceptualize in our own minds his way is his way and his way only that's the right way and that's what we want to be guided by that's what we want to follow that's why we want to come in line and in tune and in step with his provided way because he has a provided way in store for you it may be different from the journey that he has for me but you need by Revelation to grab a hold of faith and understand and believe that his promise for you is just as real as it was in in previous years in previous time Divine Healing is just as real the Holy Ghost is just as real and this is his provided way that he has made and created for you to be able to maximize your potential and your benefit of his promises [Applause] amen you know I want to tell you a little story it's not my story it's a story he said later on in that message and I think it's so beautiful I just want to share it again I I know it's something you're familiar with and you would have heard before but I just want to recap it again he says it reminds me of a little Irish mother coming from Ireland coming across the ocean she was going over to New York to meet her daughter and you will see the parallel between the story and the wise virgins on the road over they sent a SOS the ship was about to sink and they were just playing some kind of jazzy music just having a good Grand time coming over let's just imagine was like a cruise they having a good time and they were playing that jazz music down on the floor and they were dancing the captain the skipper you know he come down and rather and said just a moment moment everybody change your music change your attitude let's change your atmosphere because something has happen we if we can only hold out 30 minutes we'll be there amen if we don't we're going to the Bottom of the Sea so those were the the two options they had if we hold out 30 minutes we'll be in New York if not we'll be at the bottom of the ocean so that was their reality at that time right so he said everybody they began to play Nara my God to thee and everybody falling on the floor and they begin to pray little old Irish mother with a little old dress hooked up around this way and her long sleeve she said Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah why the skipper said Madam what's wrong with you did you hear the announcement I made he said did you misunderstand me he said said did you know I said in 30 minutes Hallelujah from now we may be at the bottom of the sea she said I I understood you I understood you clearly he said why don't you pray she said I'm prayed up don't have to pray I'm prayed up said Oh Glory praise the Lord he said how can you do that lady what are you shouting about if you prayed up he said well and she said you said in 30 minutes from now if we held out we'll be in New York he said that's right and if we didn't hold out we'll be at the bottom of the sea say that's right she said Glory she said I got a daughter in New York I'm going to see and if if we don't hold out I got one in glory so I'm going to see one in 30 minutes whether it's the one in New York or the one in glory I definitely could stand on the promise of God and the faith I have that he is going to allow me to see one of my daughters in 30 minutes that's her testimony she said hallelujah praise the Lord that's the way you want to live Hallelujah right pray it up and ready to go anytime he calls you're ready to go pray it up and ready to go Hallelujah he said walk in God provided way ready for any minute amen for you don't know what minute he'll call you to come in his presence amen that's how we want to live like those wise with extra oil we may not know the time or the hour but you want to be so prepared you want to be filled you want to be sealed you want to be prayed up that at any moment's notice you're ready hallelujah hallelujah so if you don't mind I just want to revisit that scripture we read at the beginning from Proverbs 3 just going through it's a little slower this time and chapter 3:1 it says my son forget not my law and when we hear law we often think legalistic we often think this is something dramatic don't want you to forget and yes it is but even Sunday when the pastor shared he shared that scripture very familiar scripture in Psalms 1 which was David at the time and he says blessed is the man that walth not in the Council of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sit it in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the law and in that law in his law do he meditates day and night so we see a parallel between what David said and what Solomon said amen he said it's very important he said my son forget not my law forget not so I want you to meditate on it I want you to study it I want you to have it ingrained in your system so it's almost aate it becomes a part of you that's how I want you to appreciate my law my rules my guidance my leadership I want it to be part of your life amen then it goes on to say in the same verse he said but let thine heart keep my Commandments yes so I I had to research this a little more cuz he talk about the law in the first instance forget not the law learn this almost like an academic exercise make sure you know it don't be caught with it undone don't be caught and and you're not sure what the law says but he also says let thine heart keep my Commandments that has nothing and I'll clarify in a second that has nothing to do with an academic um academic exercise your heart keeping his Commandments has all to do with you loving respecting and appreciating him it doesn't matter how bright you are how intelligent you are if you have a master's degree or if you're past CXC if you love him and you understand who he is you'll obey his word that's how you keep his Commandments by honoring his word and the relationship that you have with him which could only come through love amen as a matter of fact in St John 14 12-21 I'm going to read it for you you don't have to find it it says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than the shall he do because I go unto my father verse 13 it says and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it and then on verse 15 he says if you love me on keep my Commandments he didn't say if you're in church long time or if your father told you so or if you wrote it down on the back of a book or you have it stuck up by your bedside no he said if you love me so if you have that loving relationship with me and that respect for me and that ability to honor my word then I want you to keep my Commandments he said I will pray the father in verse 16 and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live you shall live also and then in verse 20 he says at that day ye shall know that I am my father and ye in me and I in you then in verse 21 which is the last verse we'll read at this point he he said he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me so hold on you mean your ability to keep his Commandments is proof that you love him so this love is not a talk love you mean this love is not something you profess now and you walk down and you forget about it this love have action with it this love has listen it actually have something we could measure and check and quantify and say listen you need to love me to keep Commandments and when you keep it and I see you keep it and know you love me so you could prove it it's not just a talk love it has action with this love this is his provided way this is what he has determined and predestinated for us because he said he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him so hold on so you mean I need to have love to keep his Commandments and when I keep his Commandments I prove that love him and it have benefits to go with that it's not just instructions so I want to revisit the scripture in a little bit to show this scripture is filled with instructions and benefits instructions and benefits that's how it's defined that's how it's outlined that's how it's guided you have instructions on one hand and the benefits of going through the instruction he said listen he said he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him so this has nothing to with rules this has nothing to do with the pastor say and the deacons say and my mother say and my cousin long time tell me I should do this this is not your recommendation and and the way we see it and culturally we believe no no no no no this is God's word his way his provided way if you keep his Commandments you need to have love in your heart to be able to do that and when you do that it have benefits father could love you he could love you and he could manifest himself in you amen it's all about love it's not about you it's about him and his ability to have that relationship amen amen isn't Jesus wonderful my my my I don't want us get too distracted but going back to that original scripture in Proverbs I'm on verse two it says for the length of days and long life and peace shall they add to thee so just to bring it in context that's the benefits so think about the first one he said listen keep keep your mind on my law make sure you keep my Commandments don't forget it don't forget it you have a part to play but if you could follow my instructions these are the benefits Length of days long life and peace shall they add to thee you know some people cut short you know some people they miss miserable they cast it away they struggle through no matter how hard they it's always a fight it's always a fuss but wait if that's the case and my Bible say and God's word says for length of days and long life and peace if you want this it give the prescription Above So if you're feeling odd you're feeling out of place you're feeling a little weird listen the instruction is at the top you know you go to the pharmacy or the drugstore and they tell you take this twice a day after meals and you convinced you see that I I taken mine before meals because I like to do my own thing and you feel upset or something go wrong all you had to do was follow the instructions you know it reminds me of a time they they had a bottle and they say shake well before opening and the person jump and Shake right they didn't follow the instructions they supposed to shake the bottle and then take it so sometimes you need to catch up a revelation of what's required so you can really apply it to your life so in this case no explanation required yes sir no no no opinion required no addition no subtraction this is not algebra it clearly says listen keep my law keep my Commandments and here what long life peace long days simple 1 equal 1 1 + 1 equal 2 it have no mats in that easy understood now here's the thing in a message leadership here here what he says paragraph 11 1965 he said you know what you know what the first commandment is in the Bible the first commandment with Pro with promise maybe a little hard for you to understand these Commandments the first commandment is not to have any God but him but the great Commandments and the first commandment that has a promise to it see is to the children did you know that that see he said obey your parents which may lengthen the days upon the Earth that the Lord has given thee goes on to say to mind your parents and to do what you're doing it may give you a longer life upon the earth look that the Lord has given you so so the days he gave you he it could be more he could extend it if you follow the instructions if you follow the prescription right he said because it gives more time to serve him him you're not living long to harass your grandchildren you're not living long to harass somebody but he said to serve him so he give listen the prescription and the benefit one time prescription benefit and as we go on you'll see prescription benefit by the time you do two you you you will get it trust me you see wait now prescription benefit prescription benefit if I do this this happening if I do this this happening wait now all I I to do is have faith and believe God's word I mean it's simple I don't have to try to figure it out I don't have to wonder I don't have to add something and I you know what I need to to to do something special or know because I want to catch something in it no listen it it plain it clear do this and this is the result imagine they say listen do as your brother K just do what your brother do know you get blessed the same thing get the same pay you just do this and the outcome is that but we find that hard we find that hard it's just two ways or know it's not multiple ways it's not five and 10 and 20 ways and choose one and Mickey Mouse thing going on no no no no no it's either your way or God's way at the same time I'm not saying don't eat healthy and don't exercise and don't do what the doctors say no do what you have to do but at the end of the day God has a provided way to give you guidance and direction to be able to achieve your goals and objectives that you aspire to accomplish amen that's why step by step it's it's outlined Amen in verse three hope I'm not going too slow take your time take your time he says let not mercy and Truth forsake thee bind them about thy neck write them upon the table of thine heart now that's a long one but let's just look at the front let not mercy and Truth forsake thee you remember when Peter ask how much times we should forgive what is Mercy there goes I but for the grace of God that he could reach out and and and take us out of the mar clay we should have the same kind of Mercy right and I made a note here that we shouldn't have we shouldn't be a stranger to forgiveness and honesty so for the virtues to really live in us it's it's there it's all in the word mind you I'm not making this up this is not my thoughts and ideas this is God's word he said it it he puts it together I just rehash it in second Peter 1 and here's a familiar scripture verse 5 to7 he said and beside this given all diligence add to your faith virtue no science there and to Virtue knowledge he didn't say minus it he said add add not divide and find the square root and find Co coefficient X sulf for x no he say add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patient godliness godliness Bradly kindness and to Bradly kindness charity so you have to forgive your brother anyhow no matter how you feel they they wrong you and I feel so bad and I was embarrassed at the end of the day what the word say forgive Let It Go leave it alone that might be God's provided way for you because he know what you want to get out of of you think about the Rich Young Ruler good Master what I could do he are Welter already he had honor as a matter of fact brother brother preached about it a few weeks ago he had everything going for him charismatic fell goodlooking come from a good home he probably went the best schools oh eloquence you can't compare yourself to him Hallelujah and he said what La yet what I do have Jesus say you know keep your command keep the Commandments you know do the regular do the things that you expected he said I've done this from my youth since I was a child are doing it this is normal it's almost on the verge of insulting because I in church a long time I I practically born in church you understand I grew up I'm a a ruler I I oversee people you know I am management early amen but Hallelujah but of course the prophet revealed that there were still things that God needed to work on I can't tell what you need to work on it I don't live by you or work by by by by you I'm not in your house but you know and God knows so when God pull you through and you say oh Lord why are going through this he knows why you may not even understand your family may not understand and you know what it's not even important it may not even make sense if you look at some of the characters in The Bible to you it may not even make sense imagine Samson was smaller than the average person but when the spirit came on Samson he could do above and beyond what people could imagine was possible think about Noah buil a boat Noah was not architect a carpenter you know what this man is a engineer he do I think it's nautical science they call it he focus on this so he could tell you exactly how long the both should be no but God give him instructions and tell him if you build this boat you will survive you do this you will make it true I go and send rain so I'm going to send this instruction here to get you out this is my provided way to take you through just do it and you're in order how difficult is that simple once he follow the instructions you're good to go and guess what God is the same yesterday today today and forever so he give instructions here and say listen do this forgive tell the truth keep my Commandments learn the law keep it keep it sacred and near love one another love me show me you could do it what difficult in that simple in Simplicity that is his provided way and he hasn't changed now I showed you earlier on and we may have missed it wait now both David and Solomon were saying the same thing how come how come they're saying the same thing God way didn't change when he tell you meditate day and night yeah meditate day and night your son meditate day and night your great grandchildren still meditating day and night because important to know the law how could Jesus say it is also written and it is written and it is written if he don't know the law if he don't know what the words say how he can quote it the rules remain the same you with me so it doesn't change it's no respect to a person to know it's not well because you're you're younger or you're female or you're older you have more children or more responsibility no God requirement is the same in Moses time time when God said that angel going on pass you feel you could put put I I want to put my blood in a Nike sign because I executive no no he said Put it on the door post on this stop here on the side make a cross with it that was his instruction he say if you do that when he Death Angel pass he passing you straight passing your household straight you're protected so you have the instruction this is the benefit so once we understand that all we do follow God's provided way and you're free and you're released you could see this is what God have in store for you because he love you so much he give you the instructions in advance and tell you do this if he tell you in this age listen you need to seek the Holy Ghost you need to seek the holy ghost at what point the instruction change it change just like Noah say it will rain It Will Rain It Will Rain 120 years it was still going to rain right so if this is the token and this is the requirements and this is what they're looking for it hasn't changed same instruction that is the instruction what is the the benefit of that clearly outlined you want oh oh you don't want it you don't want eternal life you you don't want to spend eternity with God you don't want in the in the Rapture you don't want to to to to to be counted as one of them right no but you see brother brandham say you know that that that is actually easy he said this debt here is simple you know he said but you see the second thatt do you trouble someone because it's easy oh gosh all you have no commitments to the bank and financing and you have no pain and no sorrow and that sounds good but you don't have a second that when you rais up again and have to give an account for why you didn't you didn't didn't forgive and and listen why you just ignore this part of the scripture why you ignore this why I give you instructions and you didn't follow whose fault is that and you had the same time the same opportunity he give you this is your instructions at that point we can't blame and say his brother you know his brother so so so the way he look at me he thrw me off he put me in the wrong seat that day so I really couldn't receive what was being said you understand so it's not good enough we have to do what is required of us and what his word said in order to get the benefits we can't make excuses we can't use somebody else experience and say well you know my parents used to go to church long time so they go say a prayer for me no it don't work so God don't have grandchildren so this is just the way his provided way to achieve that Hallelujah going quick quickly to verse four it says so shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of man of God and man let me read it one one more time so shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man you know it is so interesting that they talk about finding favor and in Trinidad in particular you know we say is is is it's not it's not who who you know but who know you and finding favor so favor is a good thing so imagine God say he want to favor you he want to show you favor he want to give you things different than your neighbor he want to bless you he want to keep you he want to guide you he want to put a hedge around you he want to show you his favor and he want to find favor not just with him but with man and humanity and Mankind that people could love you and respect you Amen in Joshua and and this reminded me of of the Lord's commission to Joshua so in Joshua 1 vers 7 and 8 he said only be thou strong and very courageous and we familiar with it that thou May observe to do according to all the law you hear what it said there all the law right which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper withersoever thou goest so he said listen if you could follow the law that Moses give unto you don't go left don't go right do divert and try to go your own way just follow the Lord that I give to Moses and Moses give to you look the benefit here so that was the instruction right it says that thou mayest Prosper withersoever thou goest in verse eight it says this book of law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt listen meditate therein day and night not on a Sunday and a Wednesday night it says day and night right that thou must observe to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then sht thou have good success so remember I say above and beyond so we not looking at profits of 2% and 3% I see government I believe doing a bond for four 4% over five years it sounds good but the government I'm a part of the the the community I'm a part of the Kingdom I'm a part of he said good success you not 4% success listen he talk Bountiful and when he when he mentioned fs and say 10 full and above and listen the God I serve does operate under different rules and I hope you understand and you catch it by now that we operate under different rules his provided way man can can sit down and it you know they can sit and say listen you know what if we do this we think this will happen and let's do a a fact fine or we do a comparative analysis of what we should do they brought that to Joshua you know when Joshua had a crossover the professionals the Consultants came to him and said listen if you wait just wait a little while because we have meteorologists and and different chologist and we check it out and we could see a far off and when we check we realize if you're wait you could just wait over and you know what he said what God say we moving in three days we crossing over it doesn't matter what you think how you feel your mindset your opinion your attitude this is the instruction I get and this is what we're going and do and that is the benefit of following the instructions of God Amen now I can say I'm moving quickly along it says in verse 5 trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding and this was the subject today trust in the Lord with all thine heart and the latter part said and lean not unto thine own understanding so that should cap it off there it has nothing to do with if you find it song nice if you find it sound harsh if you find it sound bad it's not about your ability to understand what God say or what I am even saying it has all to do with his word is truth his word is what we living by his word is God so when he said do it you do it it's right because it's his word just because he said it it's right we don't have to figure it you think we could have figured out when when God told told Gideon he said listen take the pictures put the light at a particular time break it listen I don't know they have Art of War by sunsu and different things about military planning and and catching people off guard and things but I don't think any planner of any kind of War could really rationalize what God instruction to Gideon was you know his instruction was so complicated to the man at that point that everybody would have been confused if he tried to explain how this was going to work but I could tell you what I know God said it here that was the instruction he did it and when you looked the victory was won the battle was over they didn't have to go and run people down and fight people and and come with spars and swords and shs no they cause a loud noise and the lights and the drama similar to when Joshua went around he went around once next day went around next day went around when he went seven times they didn't rush and say all that once let's pull the walls down no they just had to shout and once they followed the instruction that was God provided way to capture that adversary Jericho was their because they could follow instructions amen so it says trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lead not unto thy own understanding and with that verse Hallelujah I want to just give a little background Hallelujah the prophet preached a message called lean not unto thine own understanding and he said you know today we send out children to school to have understanding amen so he wasn't condemning school he said then after they go through the grammar school he send the high school they they get a better understanding then after they go through there some trainer even fortunate enough to go to to college which we call University and they go through college to complete the education and and the understanding of knowledge what they are acquired of many times they acquire that in an effort to get a job a lot of them do that right you have to have at least a high school diploma or so so on he say yet imagine Solomon who's regarded as the wisest man to ever live he told us not to lean to it not to lean our own understanding it's not what the teacher in the classroom will take you out and and pull you through and bring you out is not that by the way I'm not condemning formal education he said because we wonder why he would say such a thing as this for it's because that usually our modern understanding is usually the wisdom of man which is contrary to the word of God I think that's what Solomon was was trying to advise his sons was not to be illiterate but not to lean to their understanding and I think it would be a good exhortation today if we said to our sons and the sons of God that is it's all right to have an education Hallelujah there's nothing against that but when the education is contrary to the word of God then lean to the word let your education go see because the word education will stand and will give you a good job and per perhaps a good standing in society and and among the intellectuals you'll be regarded and and you know red as as somebody intelligent but you see it may even help your financial your finances and your livelihood making a living perhaps better but remember one thing you've got to die so after you achieve all you plan to achieve and you want to achieve you've got to die no matter how much education you got how many culture you're able to accumulate you've yet got to face death because is it written men must die and after that judgment and God when debt debt is not so bad but coming to judgment is the bad part now you could die but after that the Judgment God is not going to inquire of you how much schooling you got who was your lecturer perhaps who was in your cohort and who was in your class if you study with Dr Williams or something no he not going to ask you that he want to know if you have the requirements because his requirements is very different than the academic requirements he say he not going to ask whether you got a A Bachelor of Arts or or what degree you might have done even as a minister it's not going to be required of you but it's going to be required of you what you did about the understanding of God's word amen that's where the requirement comes because that your education is fine but the word of God is life am my word is is life and to know it is life and he said know him he is the word so you can only know him by the word for he is the word that's the only time you'll know him by his word amen in verse six of the same scripture in Proverbs 3 it says in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy paths if you ever wanted a Christ directed Life and you wanted to see your way you wanted to see doors open and windows closed and doors Clos and windows open and opportunities that are for you this is a scripture that you need to really really be able to internalize and really catch a a a revelation of in all thy ways acknowledge Him not some and he shall direct your path this is not you throwing out an act and you say well I going here know bless me Lord help me Lord because this is what I want no he going in front you and all you have to do is follow Lead Me Lord that's it all you do is follow so he in front you think he will lead you astray you think he Lead You Wrong it says in all I ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy path in a a message God hiding himself in Simplicity in 63 he said he wants you he wants all you are he wants every compartment in your heart he wants your private life he wants all your life he wants to be a lord lord is ownership he wants to own you so he can guide you direct you take you use you are you willing to do that if you are he's wanting to come in and you wouldn't be standing there see so now is the hour for you to receive it now it's up to you now if you'll believe it with all your heart it'll be settle from right now this will be a memorial night right now tonight this Wednesday night they probably won't close these doors tonight you'll stay all night in here but if you do like this say Lord I'm standing on my feet until you fill me according to your promise I'll never move from here where I standing you mean business with God he'll get to business with you because he's obligated to give you the benefits of his [Applause] instructions in verse S of the same scripture he said be not wise in thy own eyes fear the lord and this ties back into what we spoke about earlier you know in a in in a message respects 61 he said in verse this is paragraph 48 sorry he says now when you hear the term fear the lord he say now that doesn't mean that you're afraid of him but that means that you are giving him respect and reverence and when you respect God you fear God you fear that you might displease him in some way you fear lest you would do something wrong you wouldn't want to I fear my mother I fear my wife I fear my church I fear all of God's servants unless I should put a stumbling block somewhere in their way I fear the people I fear the people of the city unless I should do something wrong that'll cause them to think I wasn't a Christian see you've got before you can have respect you got to have fear and God demands it he demands respects God does he demands it and fear brings it and we know that fear brings respect so you see we talk about love we talk about fear so fear is not a a shout at you and I look at your fun to you feel bad no but because you respect God and you reverence God and you love God and you want to honor him and you honor his word you have no choice but to follow his instructions you have no choice but to look for his way that he has provided for you to find that and follow him amen and then it says and depart from Evil from the message deity of Christ of Jesus Christ he says and today that's what the matter with the church the hope of glory the baptism of the Holy Ghost has come into the people's hearts and they don't recognize what it is amen they don't recognize it they think it's a little church joining or something like that but that is the god the creates are living in you and giving you all the powers and you're in possession of anything that he had so is it in you to abstain from Evil to do good to shun evil and flee to righteousness to turn away from temptation all malice hatred Strife envy and so forth turn away from it for that will take him from your heart if you will receive receive him Embrace him and love him and hold him in your hearts and love him I can tell you the church together in that kind of a power has the power to bind the heavens heal the sick Open the Eyes of the blind Hallelujah the death speak the dumb speak the deaf hear the cripples walk the blind see why it's recognizing the power of almighty God in your heart there he is the deity do you want that tonight amen amen amen hallu looking to wind down now and and in verse eight it says it shall be Health to thy Naval and Marrow to thy bones held to thy Naval Lord and Marrow to thy bones so you know I went and and and I had to check it out according to Better Health bone Maru is is the blood cell Factory healthy bone marrow releases blood cells into the bloodstream that are mature and when required without bone marrow our bodies could not produce the white cells we need to fight infection the red blood cells we need to carry oxygen and the platelets we need to stop bleeding I'm not a doctor I'm not a medical professional but I know this means bone Mar real important we need it because it helped fight off illness it help extend your life it it help preserve your life so if the reward if the benefit is it shall be Health to your neighbor and Marrow to your bones I want that I want that I need to follow the instructions to get that because the benefits in there I want to get that and if you only look at it from that perspective and you realize wait a minute Hallelujah if I want long life and peace if I want good success if I want to find favor with God and man if if I want to get these things I just outline the instructions to get itlu all you have to do is accept it as yours by faith and know this is the word of God I'm going to follow this and guess what you'll get the same outcome amen now I want to wind on and wrap up so what what I want to do at this point I just want to read a couple other verses not going to explain them too much but I want to read a couple of other verses so from verse 9 listen to this because it's good it says honor the Lord with thy substance and with the first fruits of thine increase verse 10 so shall I remember instructions benefits so when you honor the Lord with the substance and the first fruits he the benefits so shall thy bands be filled with plenty and thy presses shall burst out with new wine listen to this one my son despise not the chastening of the Lord neither be wary of his correction for whom the Lord loveth he correct it even as a father the son in whom he delighted happy is the man that findeth wisdom and the man that get it understanding amen that's verse 13 He said for the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver and to gain thereof than fine gold verse 15 she is more precious than rubies and all the things thou can desire and not to be compared unto her verse 16 Length of days is in her right hand hand and in her left hand riches and honor now this is the same chapter they're still talking about Length of days and riches and honor so my friends in this same chapter they have instructions benefits instructions benefits throughout and it still come back to repeat Length of days is in her right hand and in her left hand riches and honor her ways so you notice we don't even have instructions here he reiterating benefits her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her parts are peace amen let's just pause right there at verse 17 you know the musicians could get get ready at this point and I just want to say that God's provided way is there to lead and guide you it's not yet there to fight you down and you know too much rules and somebody say and somebody tell me and I don't like how rough it was and what no no no no no it's there to lead and guide you he just wants you to love him and to serve him with all your heart he doesn't want you to try to make natural sense out out of it it needs no detailed explanation no no no fancy interpretation no opinion no you consult with with a Brethren and you find this some kind of word it has nothing to do with that this is the word of God and if God said it it will come to pass because that is his provided way he probably play through the blood hallu you know in that same message God's provided way he says men today are trying to make themselves a way people always be believe they're creative and they're bright they want to make their own way no matter how many times you say there are only two ways your way and God's way Hallelujah the wrong way and the right way he said men today are trying to make themsel a way they say well now I go to church and I do this I'm a good man well there's nothing wrong with that but still that's not God's way for you God's way he had to kill something for you that was his son Jesus Christ and on and and the blood has was is and will always be God's provided way of Escape for any person that's a sinner or any need it's through the blood it's only way in a world that that that God has created you know he has a way provided for you it's through the blood of Jesus Christ amen let's just stand
