[17:40] Christ and people the believers their
[17:43] host pastor john Shakuni Street was
[17:46] dedicated at about 50 ministers over
[17:49] their passes I believe and we had a
[17:52] great time in the Lord and it's so good
[17:54] to see God's people hunger and twisting
[17:58] for righteousness Oh blessed be the name
[18:01] of the Lord's we'll be hearing more
[18:02] about those meetings but God has been
[18:04] good to us and got us being good to me
[18:07] it gave me the strength and they gave me
[18:10] the grace to be able to him and make
[18:12] these trips and his journeys but I thank
[18:15] God for his love and to think that you
[18:18] know we just have a short space of time
[18:20] to do what we have to do before you know
[18:24] it the years just passed by
[18:26] hallelujah whatever you do what comes is
[18:30] what you do for the kingdom of God not
[18:32] the house that you build at the car that
[18:34] you drive no what you do for the kingdom
[18:37] of God
[18:39] we went out not to represent Trinidad
[18:41] represent this church but to represent
[18:43] the kingdom every Christian represents
[18:46] the king
[18:47] of God you represent a higher power a
[18:50] higher authority your anointing and your
[18:53] unction and your authority comes from
[18:54] above it doesn't come from the local
[18:57] church it doesn't come from an elder or
[18:59] a pastor or bishop it comes from above
[19:02] hallelujah praise God you are sons and
[19:05] daughters of the Living God it doesn't
[19:07] ever greet one among us and a greater
[19:09] one among us it doesn't have that you
[19:12] only have sons and daughters of God
[19:14] I passed the past and five people is
[19:16] just as good as a pastor pastor in
[19:18] 10,000 people
[19:19] it's just sons and daughters of God that
[19:22] God would give some places and and
[19:24] talents and so forth for his glory and
[19:26] for his honor he know what you could
[19:28] handle he know what you could manage he
[19:31] know what stress you can take and he
[19:33] wouldn't give you more than you can bear
[19:34] that's the God that we serve with every
[19:37] temptation he makes a way of escape he
[19:40] wouldn't leave you just to give up and
[19:41] let go and pack up shop he will always
[19:44] make away because he has proven himself
[19:46] to be a way maker when it seems to be no
[19:49] way when you seen press pop panic on
[19:51] Halloway to turn he have a way of
[19:54] opening doors that you didn't even know
[19:56] was there
[19:57] sometime in the room all locked up but
[19:59] God
[20:00] címon open I went caught open that door
[20:03] for you whatever God to open no man
[20:06] could shut that door or even God
[20:10] hallelujah maybe this morning Gordon I
[20:13] open a door to good health
[20:15] maybe this morning God could open a door
[20:18] to you for revival
[20:19] maybe this morning God could open a door
[20:22] that you could receive the baptism of
[20:25] Holy Ghost and your deliverance maybe
[20:27] this morning God would open your prison
[20:30] and you could walk a free man a free
[20:33] woman this morning or what a mighty God
[20:36] we serve Oh hallelujah hallelujah
[20:40] hallelujah hallelujah but for the blood
[20:45] of Jesus where would we be without that
[20:47] blood that's why the day they were still
[20:50] power in the blood you may not
[20:52] understand all when we preach for there
[20:53] is power in the blood
[20:55] a blood price was paid for your
[20:57] deliverance that's why the devil has no
[21:00] right this morning to hold you back hold
[21:02] you down and catch you the devil all
[21:06] right this morning because jesus paid a
[21:08] price that you could saw where you never
[21:11] went before Jesus paid the price that
[21:15] you could go free
[21:19] you may be seated but a random said one
[21:22] of the worst things as I see our Eagle
[21:24] caged up
[21:25] you got kids up a bird that was born to
[21:30] show no limits oh hi you could go where
[21:35] you could fly what meat you wanna eat no
[21:38] limits Oh hallelujah and some spirit a
[21:42] man come to entrap ajita
[21:45] hold I dig along the soil you can't tell
[21:49] a heel don't try to fly out it's built
[21:52] into flies built into soy build in the
[21:56] press and when you tell a son of God you
[21:59] have to stand at a state you cannot tell
[22:02] a true son of God that you will build to
[22:04] rise from the ashes you will build the
[22:07] bunks back up you will build Ariz up
[22:10] from the jaws of defeat to be given
[22:13] victory over the kids of the enemy you
[22:17] will raise up for God's honor unscored
[22:20] glorious good to be here this morning
[22:22] it's but to be in the presence of God
[22:25] it's good to be under the anointing of
[22:28] victory of triumph Oh blessed be the
[22:35] name of the Lord glory legardie man god
[22:39] bless you may be seated
[22:40] I want a time but uh Anthony and by the
[22:43] exact for hauling on and amen preaching
[22:46] the Word of God that's what they anoint
[22:48] you to do the preach the gospel without
[22:52] compromise hallelujah we are not
[22:56] responsible for what God said we're
[22:58] responsible for giving the message of
[23:00] what he said if you are fight with it
[23:03] that's your problem that's not our
[23:05] problem because once God said is it got
[23:07] to come to pass
[23:08] God don't waste words God don't waste
[23:11] time god don't play games god don't play
[23:15] politics God said my word is different
[23:18] from every other world my world have a
[23:20] beat up aware about it it just cannot
[23:23] return void
[23:25] always accomplish the purpose that I
[23:27] said and thought to accomplish and of
[23:30] course send me in this morning with a
[23:32] word for you that word can't return void
[23:35] Oh glory not God hallelujah glory Lala
[23:39] you know somebody made a statement
[23:43] if it keeps speaking the truth every
[23:45] time you wouldn't have to fight them to
[23:47] try to remember what they said last oh
[23:49] hallelujah hallelujah if you keep
[23:53] speaking the truth every time you
[23:55] wouldn't have to fight up with what you
[23:57] try to remember what just told that
[23:59] person time before because it is not so
[24:01] straight because you lie become
[24:03] consistent your life comes you directly
[24:06] with the words from your mouth you see
[24:09] it is powerful to be authentic it is a
[24:12] stressed act to perform the deed to
[24:15] impress people you have to make a great
[24:17] effort to do that but when you are you
[24:20] you and you are you and when you know
[24:22] who you are where you come from you are
[24:24] just who you are
[24:25] you don't think effort to be who you are
[24:28] you you just you just who you are when
[24:31] you see me you see the father because
[24:34] the father dwelleth in me that's what
[24:36] Jesus said hallelujah praise God did
[24:39] Lord some praises glory and the only
[24:47] thing that could return you to that
[24:49] uniqueness is divine revelation and
[24:53] Jesus said upon this rock I will build
[24:55] my church the Prophet said he don't even
[24:58] mind to help embellish it he is the
[25:00] architect he draw the design for it he
[25:03] know where he wants what so stop trying
[25:06] to help God I'm just moving the spirit
[25:09] the way God wanted to move be free to
[25:13] serve Him be free to push up your after
[25:16] said step like you belong to some
[25:19] priesthood back there no you don't have
[25:21] to walk like you have some angel's wings
[25:23] and some falls and you're looking to
[25:26] recover it yeah this morning no no he be
[25:29] making seven lower than the Angels he
[25:32] became one of us to become like a
[25:35] the feel the way we feel you feel tired
[25:38] you feel weary but he kept pressing on
[25:41] because you know if you only get the
[25:43] cavalry he will come true
[25:50] Oh precious is the flow that mainly wait
[25:58] to snow nor the song title nothing but
[26:02] the blood of Jesus we need the power of
[26:10] the blood the song as they look beyond
[26:14] my force and so my name's what are

[27:45] how many expectation this morning that
[27:53] God can do more then you could ask or
[27:57] think reaches a little higher than where
[28:00] you are raise your feet little higher
[28:02] than where you are really focus on hard
[28:06] and where you are go on to bless this
[28:09] morning go to one to deliver this
[28:11] morning God want to change this morning
[28:14] a from the powerful statement and I
[28:19] believe it's from Franklin D Roosevelt
[28:20] that said not everything that is feast
[28:23] can be changed but nothing can be
[28:27] changed until it is feast I kind of like
[28:31] that I want to see it again not
[28:36] everything that is faced can be changed
[28:40] but nothing can be changed until it is
[28:44] faced if you want to change you have to
[28:49] listen confront yourself you're not some
[28:55] people had to confront other people at
[28:57] the confront is one the afraid of
[28:58] confrontation the comfort of
[29:00] confrontation they love confrontation
[29:01] they some people run from confrontation
[29:03] but when are you going to begin to
[29:05] confront yourself where you are the way
[29:12] you operate what you think what you feel
[29:16] where you go why are you seeing all of
[29:20] this this morning but over it I don't
[29:21] know I just just to see what she gave me
[29:25] to say and I just hope it stick someone
[29:29] we need a left rib somewhere down here
[29:32] inside your heart but you got to
[29:34] confront yourself some point in time as
[29:37] a husband as a wife as a man as a woman
[29:43] as a sister as a daughter its parents
[29:47] father mother are the believers of
[29:50] worship are the child of God you have
[29:53] got to confront yourself because you're
[29:57] gonna find out that the God's behavior
[30:00] is his prison so the God's behavior is
[30:07] this person not what you say but what
[30:10] you are so on the authenticity comes to
[30:14] the point of what you are not what you
[30:16] see you are but what you and that's what
[30:21] Jesus came to do to bring us into a
[30:24] revelation and a recognition of who we
[30:27] are because we lost it
[30:32] we lost it we lost our Dominion
[30:36] we lost our inheritance we lost our
[30:40] position with God we lost when we look
[30:43] in the mirror we didn't recognize who
[30:45] that was
[30:45] because we lost the vision we lost the
[30:49] purpose and intent of God for what we
[30:51] were born for what we created for but
[30:54] Jesus and sins and 14:20 said that day
[30:57] you shall know but I am and the father
[30:59] he and me and I in you and Paul said we
[31:03] know in part we prophesy in part but
[31:04] when that which is perfect is come then
[31:06] that which is part is done or it and we
[31:09] shall know as we unknown so we're going
[31:12] to know that we don't know just yet but
[31:14] we gonna know something that's so
[31:16] powerful that it will change and
[31:18] revolutionize your life you are done
[31:20] because you don't know who you are
[31:21] you are depressed because you don't know
[31:23] who you are you ask week before you
[31:25] don't know where you are but if the we
[31:27] begin to say I am strong and that the
[31:29] strength of God on the inner man then
[31:31] you begin to see something different you
[31:34] stop complaining he's that praising you
[31:37] stop complaining he's not worshiping
[31:46] we're gonna read the script adjust now
[31:49] we want to float a little bit and a feel
[31:53] something like that hallelu let the
[31:55] prove of this spirit go down to pop our
[31:57] hearts football minds and souls mmm
[32:00] holla it takes effort to act it takes
[32:03] effort to be like somebody else but it's
[32:06] natural to be unique and people don't
[32:08] appreciate their uniqueness in God
[32:09] that's why we can't have one covering
[32:11] one banner one Methodist what Baptist
[32:12] economy one church to be under have to
[32:14] be one whole Eagles has to be one
[32:17] Kingdom because mana different countries
[32:20] are different culture is different and
[32:21] we are shaped by an environment or
[32:23] culture country and everything else make
[32:25] us act and behave a certain way but the
[32:27] life could have be Christ in the
[32:29] different countries in the different
[32:31] environment open be Christ one Christ
[32:33] there's only one Lord got ten Lords only
[32:36] one Lord there's only one baptism
[32:38] indistinct they this thing today is
[32:41] there's only two forces or two
[32:44] influences it don't have tree you don't
[32:46] have ten just two I want you to think
[32:49] about that because this is one when
[32:50] today and the title this morning has
[32:52] been influenced hallelujah praise the
[32:57] name by the prophetic vision to get into
[33:00] action hallelujah praise the name of the
[33:03] Lord blessed be the name of the Lord
[33:06] getting into action by the prophetic
[33:09] vision being influenced to get into
[33:11] action by the prophetic vision and that
[33:13] is what has happened to your life you
[33:15] have to be influenced Amen to get into
[33:17] action there are only two influences you
[33:20] are influenced to watch God or we from
[33:22] God some types of something coming to
[33:24] influence your marriage to break it or
[33:26] to heal it you come into church I get
[33:28] closer to God or further from God
[33:29] influences everywhere it's ever all
[33:32] around us all the advertisements are
[33:34] wrong is the influences to buy this
[33:37] product or that product they have it on
[33:39] the airwaves they had it on Billboard's
[33:40] what is that for to influence us to make
[33:43] a choice between Coke and Pepsi or
[33:45] whatever it is they want to influence us
[33:48] and the devil have his influence and God
[33:50] have his influence
[33:51] God influence is his word and that's
[33:54] what he want to bring to you this
[33:55] morning and influence of people
[33:57] hallelujah and if you have the influence
[34:00] of the word then you have the inference
[34:02] for life Oh glory to God so as we want
[34:05] to stand and give God some praise 'as
[34:08] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God
[34:11] hallelujah hallelujah Oh G Jesus
[34:44] little why why I wanted to run with
[34:52] somebody and look at them at the blood
[34:53] is washing them all away
[34:57] love
[35:00] Jesus
[35:08] Jesus
[35:17] the blood
[35:24] why
[35:27] why has no one more time for the blood
[35:33] Jesus
[35:39] who the blood of Jesus
[35:47] ah Jesus
[36:05] watch this one we want to turn off
[36:12] Piper's Ezekiel chapter 12:1 Ori from
[36:15] who's 22 to 28 also from Habakkuk
[36:20] chapter 2 1 2 3 proverbs 20 29 verse 18
[36:32] influence into action by the prophetic
[36:35] vision Ezekiel chapter 12 reading from
[36:42] verse 22 son of man
[36:46] what is that proverb that he have in the
[36:49] Land of Israel saying the days are long
[36:52] and every vision feel and tell them
[36:56] therefore thus saith the Lord God I will
[36:59] make this provoke the Seas and they
[37:02] shall no more use it as a proverb in
[37:04] Israel but say unto them the days are at
[37:08] hand and the effect of every vision for
[37:11] there shall be no more any Veen vision
[37:14] no flattering designation within the
[37:18] hooves of Israel for I am the Lord I
[37:22] will speak and the word that I shall
[37:26] speak shall come to pass it shall be no
[37:30] more prolonged for in your days or
[37:33] rebellious house will I see the word and
[37:35] will perform it see the Lord God again
[37:39] the word of the Lord came unto me saying
[37:41] son of man behold day of the house of
[37:45] Israel see the vision that he see it is
[37:48] for many days to come and he prophesied
[37:51] of the times that are afar off therefore
[37:55] see unto them thus saith the Lord God
[37:59] there shall none of my words be prolong
[38:01] any more but the word which I have
[38:04] spoken shall be done see it the Lord
[38:08] reading from Habakkuk chapter 2 reading
[38:12] from verse 1
[38:15] I will stand up on my watch and set me
[38:19] up on the tower and we'll watch to see
[38:21] what he will see unto me on what I shall
[38:24] answer when I am reproved and the Lord
[38:27] answered me and said write the vision
[38:30] and make it plain upon tables that he
[38:33] may run that reads it for the vision as
[38:38] yet for an appointed time but our the
[38:41] energize speak are not lie do it Tyree
[38:44] read for it because it will surely come
[38:47] it will not tarry and from proverbs
[38:50] chapter 29 read in verse 18 where there
[38:58] is no vision the people perish let us
[39:01] pray father we thank you for your word
[39:03] and I pray give us brutal insight bless
[39:06] the word Lord take me out of the way and
[39:08] be glorified in Jesus name I ask it amen
[39:11] amen you may be seated
[39:28] per gram our eternal destination is not
[39:32] altogether determined by what we see or
[39:34] what we hear it is determined on what
[39:40] discernment we have of what we see on
[39:44] what we hear what the Christian looks to
[39:49] is never the scene all our power and
[39:52] strength is unseen that's why we walk
[39:55] not by sight but by feet isn't that
[39:58] right and the Prophet said an influencer
[40:01] Phoenix what we have seen his promises
[40:04] in the last days or to put each one of
[40:07] us into action you have to see something
[40:10] that will inspire you into action many
[40:14] people sit and hear and you know
[40:18] understand but that's more on an
[40:21] intellectual level but what you hear
[40:24] must put you into action so somehow the
[40:28] Holy Spirit have to translate what you
[40:30] hear into an understanding that is so
[40:33] simple now when you read it you could
[40:35] run because he was told in Habakkuk to
[40:39] write the vision and then make it plain
[40:41] it ought not to be complicated it ought
[40:45] not to be that you don't understand the
[40:47] vision because the vision must be made
[40:50] clear must be made clean plain for you
[40:54] to understand it that you could move
[40:57] into action if you don't understand that
[40:59] you would freeze if you understand it
[41:02] you're gonna begin to understand the
[41:03] patterns you have to play because a
[41:05] minister cannot bring a revival if the
[41:08] people have to bring a revival therefore
[41:10] the understanding of the come to the
[41:12] people so it's not about the minister
[41:14] it's not about the preacher it's about
[41:17] you getting divine revelation to enter
[41:20] into your inheritance
[41:22] o blessed be the name of the Lord do you
[41:25] believe that this morning now watch what
[41:27] we have seen do you know what he said
[41:30] cover yourselves home by themselves then
[41:33] get into action watch what we have seen
[41:36] happen to put every soul in action it
[41:38] should make a church that would make a
[41:40] revival here in Phoenix
[41:41] that people will be flying in from
[41:43] Europe to see what's taking place
[41:45] there's a place in Arizona called
[41:47] Maricopa Valley a city called Phoenix
[41:49] there is something broke out until the
[41:52] seven thunders of revelation 10 that's
[41:54] not even a road is being manifested in
[41:57] other words somebody some group
[41:59] somewhere some part of the world will be
[42:01] able to say this day the scripture is
[42:03] fulfilled Oh hallelujah got the seven
[42:06] thunders it's being made manifest you
[42:09] mean that's a promise that's a promise
[42:11] you mean that's efficient that's a
[42:13] vision it's a vision of perfection
[42:14] because you cannot move unless you get
[42:17] revived you see if the pipe is dripping
[42:24] you could let it drip you don't have to
[42:29] fix it right away
[42:30] if you choose not to they could drip
[42:32] hole there and this make noise big dip
[42:35] but if the kitchen catch a fire you can
[42:38] just watch the city kitchens on fire
[42:39] that's a different thing altogether you
[42:42] get into action you see the tripping
[42:44] right get along to move because that
[42:47] says drip drip drip but the fire forget
[42:50] it if you don't move your house is gone
[42:53] and that's what we need we meet the seat
[42:58] somebody say fire
[43:01] Oh hallelujah but I like those five on
[43:05] the move all and petals

[43:08] little come off the shell beating them

[43:28] that come fresh I didn't even know we
[43:31] have to limit it was Brazilian

[43:39] coconut and green back in then doing
[43:43] nothing but I met a turtle on the beach
[43:44] and he hits it it wouldn't come out like
[43:48] some fire then that head come on move
[43:50] move get more spot church members who
[43:59] want to rise up hallelujah so don't tell

[44:27] man praise the name of the Lord
[44:30] hallelujah praise God so friends this is
[44:34] the time to be influenced by the world
[44:37] to be put into action with reverence and
[44:39] humility isn't done right blessed be the
[44:44] name of the Lord and that's why people
[44:45] feel safe hiding in groups they feel
[44:48] they want to take the burden off of
[44:51] there being an individual and put it
[44:54] under group so therefore you are safe in
[44:57] the group I belong to this group I'm a
[44:58] Methodist I'm about this I'm a dis you
[45:01] want to belong to a group but God does

[45:25] part is unique now when you come into
[45:28] that authentic who you are there is no

[45:38] don't want that position you want to be

[46:20] is in harmony with your outer you don't
[46:24] have no internal self conflict you have
[46:26] no points to prove you're not trying to
[46:28] get people to respect you respect me
[46:30] respect me will live a life and people
[46:35] will respect you because we will respect

[47:20] of Christ on this play
[47:26] Oh hallelujah if you believe that
[47:30] hallelujah glory to God Amen so then
[47:35] when you have to please people you have
[47:37] to find out what they see somebody asks
[47:39] a question you can't answer yeah because
[47:41] I want to nobody or the scene we've seen
[47:43] we've seen we use alright I say the same
[47:45] thing to you have no revelation you have
[47:51] no inspiration it depends upon what the
[47:54] group see what the feel of say and Jesus
[47:58] had that he said who do men say I am
[48:01] let's hear what the group of men
[48:03] otice him some say you a dis some say
[48:05] that everybody have interpretation who I
[48:07] am no church tell me who I am and they
[48:12] look to the left look to the right
[48:13] nobody got hurt because they didn't know
[48:16] he's a good man it's a powerful man he's
[48:21] a man of God but nobody is wandering
[48:24] here everybody knew that but Peter said
[48:26] I'm at the Christ the Son of the Living
[48:29] God
[48:30] now the revelation is not what he said
[48:31] but he haven't revealed to him and
[48:35] that's why Purim says it will take
[48:36] divine revelation so what people have
[48:40] for these years is a lot of intellectual
[48:42] conceptions but luck and divine
[48:45] revelation because we've an revelation
[48:47] TQ otaku think divine revelation raise
[48:54] you up into a reconciliation with God as

[56:43] your joy they get a chance to their
[56:45] swords their grapefruits their lemons

[1:14:14] someone who stand and merciful forgiving
[1:14:17] ready to run the other side of the cheek
[1:14:19] or give a second coat or go a second man
[1:14:23] Christianity in action not just taught
[1:14:27] from the pulpit but acted among the
[1:14:30] members among the pastor's that's when
[1:14:33] you see Christ living in the church Oh
[1:14:35] hallelujah
[1:14:36] yes Christ in action not just in
[1:14:39] teachings
[1:14:40] people love the teachings it is
[1:14:43] intellectually stimulating and it
[1:14:46] stimulates the gray matter in front or
[1:14:47] behind the head but the action life
[1:14:50] that's different that's applied
[1:14:52] Christianity Oh glory to God you come
[1:14:58] later go to school you learn knowledge
[1:15:00] but you have to apply the knowledge down
[1:15:01] apply the Christianity where you have to
[1:15:03] love your wife where you have to listen
[1:15:05] carefully to your husband and talk how
[1:15:08] to talk the same language at least that
[1:15:11] he will understand what you've seen and
[1:15:12] you will understand what he's saying
[1:15:13] and you want to understand what you seen
[1:15:16] because you are there to be a helpmeet
[1:15:17] not the other way around even going
[1:15:21] that's okay still the truth right you
[1:15:25] see Christ living in a church decisions
[1:15:28] are made over here and before when the
[1:15:29] Calvary the father brought his own son
[1:15:31] into a conference and Gethsemane while
[1:15:33] angels taking their positions to see
[1:15:36] what the decisions would be so Jesus was
[1:15:40] having a conference in the gonna get
[1:15:41] cemani angels at their poster duty
[1:15:43] watching to see what the Son of God will
[1:15:44] do anything if it is possible let this
[1:15:46] cup pass nevertheless not my will but
[1:15:48] thy will be done he was confronted by
[1:15:50] decisions and that's all our lives will
[1:15:53] be confronted by decisions on choices
[1:15:54] and
[1:15:55] upon the choices you will see whole life
[1:15:57] unfold for you and Jesus took the
[1:15:59] decision to go to Calvary it was a hard
[1:16:01] choice but that's what the father
[1:16:02] presented to him a cup of death a bitter
[1:16:05] cup a cup of cruelty whipped beaten
[1:16:08] embarrassed humiliated shipped up his
[1:16:10] clothing but he was going to pay a price
[1:16:12] because he saw people coming forth like
[1:16:15] the power of the blood being released go
[1:16:17] when the blood was shed the spirit came
[1:16:19] out and that spirit was to hunt every
[1:16:21] predestinated seeded that is why you're
[1:16:24] here this morning because the spirit
[1:16:26] found you go give the Lord some previous
[1:16:28] people do you understand what I'm saying
[1:16:31] there are so many people right off this
[1:16:34] one and right off that one because they
[1:16:35] write talking their minds and got a
[1:16:37] write off notes when I got in right of
[1:16:38] that one if God was writing on rate of
[1:16:40] all of us for all our sin that come
[1:16:43] short of the glory of God but the Bible
[1:16:45] teaches God so loved the world we have
[1:16:47] to stretch amen amen
[1:16:53] Oh hallelujah are you ready for some
[1:16:56] more watch if God acted any one time on
[1:17:00] a certain circumstance and if that same
[1:17:02] circumstance arise again he's got the
[1:17:04] ark a second time like he did the first
[1:17:06] time
[1:17:06] oh he's unjust no matter how bad you are
[1:17:09] in sin how stupid they become he has got
[1:17:13] to act to you like he did that fallen
[1:17:16] woman
[1:17:16] or he acted wrong them that is and here
[1:17:19] we go
[1:17:19] God's behavior is his person what he is
[1:17:23] in his behavior declares his person and
[1:17:26] that's the way you are in your behavior
[1:17:30] of life tells what you are as you went
[1:17:33] on lesson to you two days ago the
[1:17:36] Methodist people wanted to declare when
[1:17:38] you're shot you got it the Pentacles
[1:17:40] don't see when you spoke it down I got
[1:17:41] it
[1:17:41] the shake can say when you shake I got
[1:17:43] it what your life declares it your
[1:17:48] person declares what you are so it's not
[1:17:52] when you shout people want them
[1:17:54] simpleton identification or when you
[1:17:56] have this when you're on this when you
[1:17:58] believe this and so forth they want that
[1:18:00] but what about when you have the life
[1:18:02] when they can manifest his works when
[1:18:05] you can manifest his presence when you
[1:18:07] can live something
[1:18:08] that is more important but but people
[1:18:11] come like if all of you is a believer
[1:18:13] but it has to be more than that because
[1:18:15] even the devil believe and tremble but
[1:18:17] you have to believe and go on and to
[1:18:19] possess what you know is your so our
[1:18:22] revelation have to come to you as an
[1:18:24] individual because you're kind of
[1:18:26] possesses as a church because your name
[1:18:29] is you join heritance is yours
[1:18:32] you cannot take somebody's hair is your
[1:18:34] glory
[1:18:37] look juices heated by his brothers and I
[1:18:42] see he was set up to be hidden so I love
[1:18:44] them openly give him a quote openly love
[1:18:47] them openly his brothers got a fight
[1:18:48] with that his brothers wasn't feeling
[1:18:51] that love from the father dividual that
[1:18:52] was feeling it plus dress of my dreams
[1:18:55] that's even more complicated so they had
[1:18:58] enough on him to get rid of him
[1:19:00] they say know what let me solve a
[1:19:01] problem get rid of him and that's what
[1:19:03] God wanted know you may not think that
[1:19:09] way and you may not like the experience
[1:19:12] of being stripped of being give up by
[1:19:15] your family and and separated and so on
[1:19:17] and penis plenty pimping for Joseph he's
[1:19:19] young he's in pain left to the Egyptians

[1:31:03] that's what we're trying to say Jesus of
[1:31:06] course they try to belittle him Baram he
[1:31:08] said no they want to hurt your inference
[1:31:10] before the people that's the way you
[1:31:12] want to watch care for what you do walk
[1:31:14] like real men of God talk like men of
[1:31:16] God act like men of God live like men of
[1:31:18] God because the devil your adversary is
[1:31:20] going about like a roaring lion seeking
[1:31:22] what he may devour why did he do this
[1:31:24] why did it act like that to Jesus they
[1:31:26] were jealous of him
[1:31:27] that's the main reason they tried to
[1:31:29] belittle him they were jealous of his
[1:31:31] ministry and that's the reason they
[1:31:33] tried to belittle him he had a Ministry
[1:31:35] of God and they knew that but it was
[1:31:37] contrary their Creed's so the track were
[1:31:40] trying to belittle him make everything
[1:31:42] every little floor they could find that
[1:31:45] way they want him to quit they wanted
[1:31:48] him to quit they wanted the people that
[1:31:50] he knows him they wonder said no this
[1:31:51] guy's nothing look here o years how is
[1:31:54] this dis you know that's not right
[1:31:55] we've been told all our life we should
[1:31:57] believe the elders and here's the right
[1:31:59] down bald ear though what choice do what
[1:32:07] I've made if Jesus come back again and
[1:32:08] she does the security bunch Elvis in
[1:32:11] this message we are being taught by each
[1:32:17] rabbi oh yes true and this comes along
[1:32:21] and disagree with them that man ain't
[1:32:24] fit to be a preacher they were trying to
[1:32:26] belittle him but all of that the ones
[1:32:27] that believed him loved him they seen
[1:32:29] the scriptural mirco signs that would
[1:32:32] not be hindered back there no sir
[1:32:33] damn who believed him believe him those
[1:32:35] who loved them stood by him and brought
[1:32:37] they would not see what others pointed
[1:32:39] to them Oh hallelujah God always cause I
[1:32:43] ready they're not sure to hit the
[1:32:45] spiritual not the other way are wrong
[1:32:51] that events are in the light boy are you
[1:32:56] spiritual you'll be you'll be heated I
[1:32:59] told them at Olin Africa join the bunch
[1:33:03] Alleluia all those who work were not the
[1:33:06] perfection will be heated because Joseph
[1:33:08] was the word that's why he was heated
[1:33:10] Jesus was the word that's why he was
[1:33:12] heated the pride will be the word that's
[1:33:14] my she be heated join the bunch so don't
[1:33:17] think everybody will put a bookie over
[1:33:19] your flower over your head and put us
[1:33:21] row by a ring of flowers I wrong out
[1:33:23] your neck no no no no they wouldn't see
[1:33:25] with you because you are going to
[1:33:26] perfection oh praise God so what's
[1:33:29] something they're not trying to hit the
[1:33:31] spirit of course the kids hit evil it
[1:33:32] cause Cora to hit Moses
[1:33:34] it's called Judas to hit Jesus and on
[1:33:36] and on it goes is not right they tried
[1:33:38] to destroy the influence tried to
[1:33:39] destroy everything
[1:33:40] because nothing but jealousy started in
[1:33:42] Keene and proved was jealousy and its
[1:33:45] kind and then when the natural the
[1:33:46] Conner and the spirit on me together it
[1:33:48] proves seat an order we called jealousy
[1:33:51] comes from Satan and then causing an
[1:33:53] impersonation of truth
[1:33:54] Oh hallelujah if people don't want God's
[1:33:58] perfect will God give you a permissive
[1:34:00] will isn't that right God made a perfect
[1:34:03] will and it's perfect will isn't what we
[1:34:05] want today a man isn't that right so God
[1:34:07] wants his people to be one and the devil
[1:34:10] of a plan to try to put people under his
[1:34:12] one under his plan God has a plan and
[1:34:14] the devil has a plan I when the devil is
[1:34:17] trying to get all people on his plan
[1:34:18] while God is trying to get people to be
[1:34:21] under his plan there are two great
[1:34:24] spirits in the world one of them is a
[1:34:26] devil
[1:34:27] the other one is gone so all in your
[1:34:30] life there are just two influences
[1:34:33] everything is connected with those two
[1:34:36] not three not four just two is either
[1:34:41] the devil is inspiring something or God
[1:34:44] is inspiring something influence come
[1:34:47] towards or against
[1:34:51] hallelujah
[1:34:52] somebody could influence somebody
[1:34:54] against this church or watch this church
[1:34:56] somebody could influence people away
[1:34:58] from what is right or towards something
[1:35:01] that is wrong is to untrue that's how
[1:35:04] your influence and Jesus came to bring
[1:35:06] an influence of God upon the face of the
[1:35:08] earth they wanted an influence of a man
[1:35:10] to take power back from room until I
[1:35:13] said My Kingdom is not of this world so
[1:35:16] the inference you want I come to bring
[1:35:17] you that because you have men to fight
[1:35:20] for me my kingdom is of a different
[1:35:21] world altogether got that Rome and all
[1:35:24] and things just temporary
[1:35:25] isn't that right or what have you kept
[1:35:28] it is this temporary isn't that right so
[1:35:31] the devil of is messengers and
[1:35:32] Quatermain messengers and we had Liberty
[1:35:34] to take our choice to whom we would heal
[1:35:36] ourselves to so who have influence over
[1:35:40] your life up all over you
[1:35:44] are you hearing me whatever have
[1:35:47] influence over your life have the power
[1:35:50] over you that's why the adopted son must
[1:35:54] have dominion over himself before you
[1:35:56] have dominion over others and other
[1:35:58] things
[1:35:59] that's why Jesus was led into the
[1:36:01] wilderness that he get a pole or himself
[1:36:03] over the lust of the eyes the pride of
[1:36:05] life lust of the flesh when you overcome
[1:36:07] that he was ready to return in the power
[1:36:09] of the Spirit to deal with the humans
[1:36:11] because when you could deal with the
[1:36:13] devil humans are secondary because
[1:36:15] you're already deal with the devil it is
[1:36:16] written it is written it is written and
[1:36:18] he dealt with it never liked the word to
[1:36:20] prove we got a deal did ever like the
[1:36:21] world and overcome it is written it is
[1:36:23] written it is written then the Spirit
[1:36:26] come upon Jesus to really handle the
[1:36:27] devil until you with the devil and I
[1:36:30] brought I bring a tremendous thought in
[1:36:31] Uganda there he said the devil's Jesus
[1:36:34] the going to the pigs and Jesus give
[1:36:37] them their requests and if Jesus could
[1:36:41] give Devils their requests because the
[1:36:45] acts they're going to pigs do more
[1:36:46] mischief what about his sons and
[1:36:48] daughters
[1:36:49] the devil's asked Jesus let us crawl
[1:36:52] into the prints and Jesus said I allow
[1:36:55] you to I give you information like I
[1:36:57] answer your request what about you sons
[1:36:59] and daughters of God that should wake
[1:37:01] you up inside of here to make a request
[1:37:03] known unto God
[1:37:04] there's no good thing he really hold
[1:37:06] from you there is no good thing he would
[1:37:09] withhold from you
[1:37:09] let me say it good now there is no good
[1:37:11] thing he would withhold from you he
[1:37:14] won't appoint on you and let you come
[1:37:15] run over said my cup runneth over
[1:37:20] my cup runs over surely goodness and
[1:37:23] mercy shall follow me all the days of my
[1:37:26] life oh that's a man that I love that
[1:37:29] man loved God he anoints in the promises
[1:37:31] of God I look on to the hill so my
[1:37:33] coming my help my help comes from the
[1:37:35] Lord isn't that right oh praise God Amen
[1:37:38] so what the only two forms are gonna
[1:37:41] skip down Oh blessed be the name of the
[1:37:43] Lord praise God praise God hallelujah
[1:37:47] hallelujah you talked about United
[1:37:50] Nations everybody trying to get the
[1:37:51] unity everybody only same thing I watch
[1:37:53] it's choosing time you must choose you
[1:37:55] this day whom you're gonna serve the
[1:37:57] devil has presented many things
[1:37:58] glamorous that you can choose if you
[1:38:00] wish true isn't that right he said no
[1:38:02] you said when I unclean spirit here we
[1:38:04] go he's gone out of a man he walks in
[1:38:07] dries places and he's going around
[1:38:10] trying to find rest here we go
[1:38:13] a spirit is not very bad until he can
[1:38:17] find somebody he can talk to or live
[1:38:20] through so the spirit is harmless until
[1:38:24] it gets somebody he could talk to and
[1:38:27] work through just recently I could feel
[1:38:30] the spirit in a meeting all sending a
[1:38:32] letters of apology
[1:38:33] the first night I forgive you God does
[1:38:35] too when the meter was going on an evil
[1:38:38] spirit in the meeting and that spirit
[1:38:40] here we go is almost harmless until it
[1:38:43] can catch somebody it can work through
[1:38:46] watch then it kind of worked through it
[1:38:49] certainly be damaged because it's an
[1:38:51] evil spirit and the Holy Spirit is here
[1:38:53] trying to find somebody to work through
[1:38:56] and when it finds somebody to work
[1:38:58] through it can do good
[1:38:59] so it's two spirits their motives the
[1:39:03] objectives watch how it is watch their
[1:39:06] works watch their fruits and then you
[1:39:09] see what spirit is on you you are
[1:39:11] motivated by spirit are you hearing me
[1:39:16] this morning you are motivated by spirit
[1:39:20] if you have no spirit you are dead if
[1:39:24] you have spirit it motivates your life
[1:39:26] and your life bears the fruit of a
[1:39:29] Christian it's a Christian spirit if
[1:39:31] you're in the fruit of a Christian is
[1:39:32] not right you see it and deep quality
[1:39:36] people coming on the platform and Baram
[1:39:38] says you not a Christian what does he be
[1:39:42] man didn't speak there's a spirit that
[1:39:44] vibrate love the man that Barham know
[1:39:47] he's a Christian he said your Minister
[1:39:49] the gospel you're not here you here for
[1:39:51] revival
[1:39:51] he could discern the spirit of a
[1:39:54] Christian it sends out the vibration you
[1:39:58] don't have to even speak it with speaks
[1:40:00] for itself
[1:40:00] so when Jesus walking them Devils crying
[1:40:03] out because the devil seemed big bright
[1:40:07] light walking and other people watching
[1:40:10] him all invisible and those never seeing
[1:40:13] son of God hallelujah don't ever seem
[1:40:17] pretty bright light walk in the face of
[1:40:20] the earth catches about what they want
[1:40:22] to see what thousands of live voice is
[1:40:25] the Thunder of God don't know not and
[1:40:28] sweetness and humility undefined lies
[1:40:31] walking around the earth without the
[1:40:33] blemish
[1:40:36] Oh hallelujah hallelujah are you with me
[1:40:40] so what this spirit now goes out walks
[1:40:43] in dry places hunting the fine rest the
[1:40:45] bobber I said he could not find it so he
[1:40:47] said I'll return to where I come out of
[1:40:49] so it goes back to this person that he
[1:40:51] was was in and he find all the house
[1:40:53] swept cleaned up sanctified condemnation
[1:40:58] gone I read how a believer but it is
[1:41:00] empty
[1:41:01] he said come here seven other spirits
[1:41:04] worse that he was when you please try to
[1:41:07] get this the Bible said that's the truth
[1:41:10] jesus said it's the truth he comes back
[1:41:13] to this house a man who confessed Christ
[1:41:15] to be a savior got rid of his wickedness
[1:41:17] the Christians drinking quitting smoking
[1:41:19] his line is stealing he has become
[1:41:22] sanctified cleaned out he's always all
[1:41:24] swept if he's free he comes back find
[1:41:27] that house then he goes and gets seven
[1:41:28] other spirits who worse than he was
[1:41:30] comes into this person and the Bible
[1:41:32] said the last state of that person is
[1:41:34] seven times worse than wasn't the
[1:41:35] beginning was that I tell you our empty
[1:41:39] house is a target for the devil so we
[1:41:44] have to get the empty house filled with
[1:41:47] the Holy Ghost so you really have no
[1:41:50] time to waste you have time to be hungry
[1:41:53] none Tilson looking to be filled with
[1:41:56] the Holy Ghost
[1:41:57] because the devil look at my empty clean
[1:41:59] house and he know he got kicked out so
[1:42:01] he's not coming by himself so I got
[1:42:02] takeout again he needs some help
[1:42:04] so he gets seven more and they're not
[1:42:07] gonna be bad and he was those seven
[1:42:09] worst and him to help pass down the door
[1:42:12] to come and occupy your house
[1:42:14] but today the Bible said when the enemy
[1:42:17] coming like a flood the Spirit of God
[1:42:20] raised a standard so we have been living
[1:42:22] this morning that's time that will be
[1:42:24] raised in your life o blessed be the
[1:42:27] Lord hallelujah hallelujah
[1:42:30] so watch if you are filled with the
[1:42:33] world of us God sent the Holy Spirit to
[1:42:34] the earth to motivate the church you
[1:42:37] might be filled with toys you might be
[1:42:38] filled with geology you might have an
[1:42:40] education you might be filled with
[1:42:42] religion and still be a target of the
[1:42:44] devil or watch when God made you that
[1:42:48] you could empty I love that
[1:42:49] when you are born you was made with a
[1:42:52] place to be filled by Nietzsche you're a
[1:42:55] child of the devil the evangelists come
[1:42:58] along you repent get cleaned up you see
[1:43:00] what the devil comes he brings back to
[1:43:02] you and sets you in some little
[1:43:03] denomination and say our church is the
[1:43:05] biggest one and then you get heady
[1:43:07] highminded why don't condemn it just
[1:43:08] stay home watch television
[1:43:09] it doesn't condemn me to smoke a little
[1:43:11] friendly cigarette your food tell you
[1:43:12] what you are no watch and then somebody
[1:43:15] come and talk about miracle you sit down
[1:43:16] somebody said don't believe that we
[1:43:18] don't believe it and then you get behind
[1:43:21] it is the same motive that was in store
[1:43:23] be there
[1:43:24] God don't want that he don't want us
[1:43:26] United all on the Methodists under
[1:43:28] Baptist or any Church Dominion he wants
[1:43:31] united under his spiritual Kingdom the
[1:43:33] Holy Spirit and when the Holy Spirit
[1:43:35] comes the world becomes dead and you are
[1:43:38] filled with the baptism of the Holy
[1:43:39] Ghost and the devil is a person that has
[1:43:41] to stay away from you you are under
[1:43:44] court domain so with the Holy Ghost
[1:43:46] inside of you that devil of the get
[1:43:48] permission he will stay away from you
[1:43:50] because he got shocked when Jesus touch
[1:43:53] when he had a touch I need a favor Jesus
[1:43:55] in the wilderness isn't that right so
[1:43:57] God made you a place that you could be
[1:44:00] emptied out oh praise the name of the
[1:44:02] Lord blessed be the name of the Lord and
[1:44:04] Jesus would not permit the disciples to
[1:44:06] preach the gospel until they receive the
[1:44:08] Holy Ghost that been honored to walk
[1:44:10] with him for three and a half years they
[1:44:12] were holy men accepted in his sight but
[1:44:14] he would not let them preach until they
[1:44:15] waited up there and got all the
[1:44:17] differences out of them and then the
[1:44:19] Holy Spirit came what the world needs
[1:44:21] today is that same feeling when the
[1:44:23] dumpin comes out its need a filling it
[1:44:26] brings love where you have doubts it
[1:44:27] brings feet where you have indifference
[1:44:29] it brings love where you have hatred it
[1:44:31] brings fellowship I went and when the
[1:44:33] Church of the Living God someday will
[1:44:35] united under one head the head of God
[1:44:37] oh praise the name of the Lord blessed
[1:44:40] be the name of the Lord
[1:44:42] Oh hallelujah hallelujah glory to God so
[1:44:46] watch watch your life being different
[1:44:50] from what they see your testimony of
[1:44:53] your life is loaded and the testimony
[1:44:55] that someone could see something about
[1:44:56] you so keeping that in your mind we are
[1:44:59] bringing influences everyday on the life
[1:45:02] you live
[1:45:03] what's inside of you you kind of changed
[1:45:05] that it reflects what's on the outside
[1:45:07] and if we take the testament of being
[1:45:10] Christians I think that is one of the
[1:45:12] most solemn things that a man a woman of
[1:45:13] Y could do when you take on the name of
[1:45:15] Christ here we go he is going to be a
[1:45:18] representative of Christ so you are not
[1:45:22] representing headstone Tabernacle you
[1:45:24] are representing Jesus Christ you're
[1:45:27] representing the kingdom of God when you
[1:45:29] leave here is not the believers watching
[1:45:31] you is God watching you amen and others
[1:45:34] watching you too is not right
[1:45:35] so season was canceled from heaven isn't
[1:45:37] that right and he actually oh praise God
[1:45:41] okay then he said no watch when you get
[1:45:44] man that will break up and organize and
[1:45:46] break up Brotherhood that's the devil to
[1:45:48] me I've never seen a person too low I
[1:45:50] have never seen a person to find sin yet
[1:45:53] I have never seen a woman too stooped or
[1:45:56] a man to stoop but what I would go to
[1:45:58] him and put my arms around him and bring
[1:46:01] him out of that if I can I have never
[1:46:04] seen a bunch of holy rollers or whatever
[1:46:06] you want to call them shouting and
[1:46:07] routing whatever they might do but what
[1:46:09] I'll get right there and root and jump
[1:46:11] and hollow with them to glorify God when
[1:46:14] I use black yellow brown whatever years
[1:46:17] the Holy Ghost comes on one level and
[1:46:19] that's when you meet watch your comment
[1:46:21] if you ever get it it will come on
[1:46:23] course level or praise the name of the
[1:46:25] Lord you believe that Oh hallelujah
[1:46:28] hallelujah all glory to God bless her
[1:46:32] beat him alone if it gets it it gonna be
[1:46:34] on God's level hallelujah praise the
[1:46:36] name of the Lord so let's go over it
[1:46:38] again right division make it plain the
[1:46:42] he that readeth mirror on the word has
[1:46:44] to be made plain to you that as a child
[1:46:47] of God the book was sealed it unsealed
[1:46:49] to bring back what sons and daughters of
[1:46:50] God that's what's purpose and plan that
[1:46:53] sons and daughters got be restored he's
[1:46:56] in a message to restore hearts back to
[1:46:58] the faith of the virus it then have to
[1:47:00] take us the power Paul must take us to
[1:47:02] the promised to manifest the promise
[1:47:04] so God send the word that we get our
[1:47:06] fate theater reason from where you are
[1:47:08] to possess what God promised you so
[1:47:11] faith leads to power power to the
[1:47:14] promised
[1:47:14] the promise isn't that right so the
[1:47:17] vision is this God sent a revelation of
[1:47:19] perfection

[1:47:23] bring a resurrection no perfection Norma

[1:47:32] will be the capstone bride she gonna be
[1:47:34] the magnet to pull the others out of the
[1:47:37] grave

[1:47:40] for to become squad magnet that we are
[1:47:43] Christ is forming a headstone bride
[1:47:46] and he gonna come into it and raise the
[1:47:48] rest of them from the grave l.o.v.e is

[2:13:16] being yourself we have a lot of people
[2:13:19] we have a lot of actors they're acting
[2:13:22] as Christians but when the life of
[2:13:23] Christ is in you you don't have to act
[2:13:25] anything it'll just come out naturally
[2:13:27] it no longer be God bless you with a
[2:13:29] smile and behind that is something else
[2:13:32] but when you say there's no real it's
[2:13:33] genuine because the life of Christ has
[2:13:35] to produce itself and that's about to
[2:13:38] happen all over the building one there
[2:13:40] one over there one of it that's Jesus
[2:13:42] that's Jesus that's Jesus that's Jesus
