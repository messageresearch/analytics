When we have a work to do and a task ahead is bigger than you, that's when he steps in. When you know in your heart that God's command takes more that can be done by man, that's when he steps in.

Lunch of fish and bread is all you have for the meal ahead. That's when he stops singing. Let him take it and bless it and break it and give it and it will multiply it in the moment you leave it. In the moment you come when you've given your all, he steps in. He steps in and he say what's that you have in your hand. I tell you this morning, I can use it.

God bless you. Thank you, brother Jonathan. Thank you so very much. God bless you. Before you sit down, I'd like to ask that you please bring out your Bibles and let's read from two portions of scripture and then I have a context script scripture that I'm going to read afterwards. I'm reading from Romans 84 14-1 17 and Ephesians 4 11-15. Romans 8 14-17 and then also St. Luke I mean Ephesians 4 11-15 and then I'll read also my context scripture um St. Luke's St. Luke 15 about the prodigal son. So um Romans chap 8 14-17 reads on these wise for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God. For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry, "Aba, Father." &gt;&gt; The spirit itself be witness with our spirit that we are the children of God. And if children, then hes of God, then hes of God and join hes with Christ. If so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ephesians 4 11-15. And he gives some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and conning craftiness whereby the lion wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ amen may the Lord add his blessings to the rhythm of his holy words let's bow our heads for a prayer please our heavenly father we thank you for grace to be back in your presence one more time this Morning. Thank you for the blessings of the past few days where you have given us more than we could have even asked for. And if you had to go home already, even last night, Lord, it was more than worth it already. But Lord, we are here one more day, Lord. And like Jesus cried out on the last day of the feast, I pray that your Holy Spirit will minister and pour out upon each one of us today on this great last day of this feast where we have come together to rejoice in your word in the promises that are ours from your word. I pray Lord that you'll help me this morning. I pray you'll help uh your people Lord. Lord, I pray you'll strengthen their child bodies. And I pray, Lord, that you'll help me, Lord, to speak only what want me to speak and shut my mind from what you don't want me to say. &gt;&gt; I pray, Lord, that the man of Christ will speak to your people this morning. May the person of Christ himself minister your word to your people because you know the needs that be in every heart and life. And Lord, may your Holy Spirit go forth with power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit. And at the end of this service and this day and this convention, we will be careful, very careful to give you alone all the praise, honor and glory for we ask you with thanksgiving in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. May be seated please. Good morning and God bless you. All right. I don't need to ask you whether you are happy. It's obvious in the services and especially after last night's um service. Um I don't need to ask you whether you're happy. I know you are happy and we thank the Lord for &gt;&gt; his goodness. So I just pray that God will help me and I'll be able to say something that will be a blessing to you. Um I get to speak many times on Sunday morning and the service already done and everything has been spoken. So I pray that you will be able to find some crumbs from what I'm going to say because the message has already gone forth and there's nothing more I can add. But I want to start by thanking brother Isaac and sister Grace for JB for the invitation to be here again and um brother Isaac said this is the 28th year of the convention and um I think my first one was 2000 and um brother Isaac I don't need to say anything more about him but I want to say here publicly um because everybody knows the situation that happened with our brothers recently and um many people may not know it but This was the hero of the whole whole thing. Brother Isaac was in the background instrumental to make sure our brothers came out. So on behalf of those of us from Lagos, will you please all stand up and let me thank brother Isaac for the tremendous help he gave us, for being such a hero, for being such a loving brother, for being such a good brother. Thank you, brother Isaac. Thank you, brother Isaac. We love you and I appreciate you so much. Thank you. And I think I should just add right away too for all of you that are here and even those who are not here all of Nigeria and all over the world for the great show of love, concern, care that we felt, the prayers especially the contributions in cash and kind we can't thank you enough. I just want to say because the English language is so poor in finding adequate words but the best we can say is thank you. Thank you feels so light, so weightless, so inadequate. But because there are no better words in English language, I just want to say on behalf of those of us from Lagos and our church in Lagos, I want to say thank you. Thank you for your love, your prayers, your care, your contributions. We are very very grateful. Amen. the brothers are doing fine and they are getting reintegrated back into into um their regular schedule. I don't want to spend all the time about that because the devil is not in the picture. So I don't want to spend time. So So I just wanted to be sure to thank you all. Amen. So brother Isaac, thank you for the convention one more time in the 28th year and to the Hson tabernacle, brother Salem, the ministry and the different helps and governments in the church. want to thank you for inviting us to be here again and always making us feel so welcome. I always feel very guilty when I come here and I see the sisters the cooking and things. obviously very guilty that on account of you they are missing the services they are doing so much but I want to say thank you to the sisters who took care of us and make sure they are within miss home I can tell you I don't eat as much in my home I can tell you that but Isaac and the the brothers the sisters thank you so very much for everything you've done for us and for the pastors ministers church in attendance to leave your groups, your churches and come here. Thank you. Like brother Muka said and every so obvious if you've been here for anytime at all. This is so huge. This convention is so large and and and I'm sure you have not been disappointed because God has been here to bless us over above and beyond. So thank you to my pastor brothers who were all introduced this morning, the ministers and the church in attendance. Thank you so very much. And even the pastors who are not here who send their people want to say thank you because without the people there's no convention. Amen. And of course I want to thank my brothers the future speakers before me brother Isaac himself and brother oid on uh Friday night. Brother Kamera yesterday morning and brother um Kos Maz Maduk and brother Ibrahome yesterday afternoon. brother over again last night and I it's my honor and my privilege to be on the field with you brothers and I thank you so much. I love you. I appreciate you and I I've been so blessed. I've been so blessed and really because I I avoid going to convention sometime because I don't want to be on the pulpit. I don't want to preach. I just want to sit down and be blessed. And I've been blessed. I've had more than my portion in this convention. But I'd like to send out a word of caution because you know and thank you. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you. All right. Now, don't be nervous seeing me. Okay? &gt;&gt; Just relax and uh we'll enjoy the service together. Um I have it I have a repetition for preaching long and whiny but uh um brother Theo is here. Brother Theo last night he spoke 44 minutes. I couldn't do that in 3 hours. So I will try to um get to my point really quick. So I said I want to send out a word of caution because you know is the age of brotherly love, brotherly kindness and the honey sticking and brother Brandham taught us that and we all know that because that's the message and what I have found out my experience I don't know what your experience is because I'm speaking so I'm telling you my experience is that when we talk about love We all seem to take it very lightly. &gt;&gt; You know what the reason why? Because love is an emotion that every human being feels. &gt;&gt; Even if I don't love you, you don't love me. In all likelihood, you will love your dad and mom. &gt;&gt; Even if you are not married, because love, you love somebody, you love something. So when we are being spoken to about love is like something we know already. And that's the danger. Because human beings, human nature that we have, when something is spoken about that appears common to you, we tend to overlook it. &gt;&gt; And that's why I see I want to send out a note of caution this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. so that we would we we've had a great time, &gt;&gt; great outstanding time, but I wonder that we are not just jumping for joy and not sitting down to way what is being spoken about. &gt;&gt; Whether I'm a pastor, I'm a minister, I'm a deacon, I'm a brother, I'm a sister. If if brother oid or brother Ka or brother Gome or brother Isaac or brother Cosmos whoever is talking about drop your arts am I really taking that from me and I know I ought to go through my life and drop every art that I have. &gt;&gt; If I'm not doing that then my coming here has been &gt;&gt; in vain. I've just come for a jump for joy. But for a that's Pentecostal, but for a life the the the bride is a life when the word comes a life that will clean up. That's the bride. &gt;&gt; And that's what Pentecost cannot match up to. &gt;&gt; I just hope that we are not going to be in that category. And I know we're not going to be. I just wanted to send a word of caution. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Two weeks ago, I think it was, we had a Thanksgiving service in our church in Lagos. And I actually told our church that um the heroes of the recent event that we had happen at church was brother Isaac here and the brothers with him and brother uch and you know brother Noel his head deacon in on who I mean they went over above and beyond the call of duty to be a blessing to us. I uh wanted to acknowledge brother Ouch. Also is like a son to me. Uh even though he's taller than me, he's bigger than me, but that's where you want your children to be to be bigger than you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; All right, brother. Thank you so much. I mean, brother, I don't know if Noel is here, but but thank is here. medicine. I mean these brothers, that's what it is. That's what it is. Like brother Bernham said, the horny sticks when something happens, you know, you you don't you don't have the you just go all out and at the risk of your own life. And that's what the brothers did for one say thank you so very much. Amen. Amen. Before I get started speaking, I'd like to read my corner scripture. It's long, but I'll try to read it. And um but my title this morning is the home that love built. The home that love built. And my inspiration is the spirit of adoption whereby we cry aba father. And my subject, if I can call it that, is the prodigal son and the prodigal older brother. All right. So, um, St. Luke 15, just read so that we'll get a cont because I'll get to it later. Um, St. Luke chapter 15, you know the story. It's been spoken about so many times during the convention here. Uh but I just want to run through it and read it about the prodigal son. So the story remains fresh in your mind when I get to it. Um St. Luke 15 11-32 verse 11. It reads on these wise and it said a certain man had two sons. Now this scripture here is coming right after the scripture. Come and rejoice with us. I mean come and rejoice with me. I found the lost coin that I lost. So this is all tied together to adoption time where the woman the bride the bride woman swept the floors and put down the cobwebs and found the lost coin that she was looking for. Verse 12. And the younger of them said to his father, "Father, give me the portion of goods that fallen to me." And he divided unto them his living. And not many days after the young son gathered all together and took his join into a far country and there wasted his substance with rioters leaving. And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land. And he began to be in want. And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country. And he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he would fill his belly with the husks that the swine did eat. and no man gave unto him. And when he came to himself, he said, "How many high servants of my fathers have bread enough and to spare, and I perish here with hunger? I will arise and go to my father, and will see unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee, and I am no more worthy to be called thy son. Make me as one of thy hired servants." And he arose and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. And his son said unto him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight, and I'm no more worthy to be called thy son." But the father said unto said to his servants, "Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring in his on his hand, and shoes on his feet, and bring he the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat and be married. For this my son was dead and is alive again. He was lost and is found. And they began to be married. Now his elder son was in the field. And as he came and drew night to the house, he heard music and dancing. And he called one of his s one of the servants and asked what these things meant. And he said unto him, "Thy brother is come and thy father had killed the father cal because he had received him safe and sound." And he was angry and would not go in. Therefore came his father out and intreated him. And he answered and he answering said to his father, "Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgress I at any time thy commandment. And yet thou has thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends." That's like a goat. That I might make Mary with my friends. But as soon as this thy son was come, which had devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fed cal. And he said unto him, son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine. &gt;&gt; It was meat that we should make Mary, and be glad, for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again, and was lost, but now is found. &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord add his presence to the reading of his holy words. The home that love built. Inspiration, the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, "Aba, father." And my subject is the prodigal son and the prodigal older brother. &gt;&gt; All right. And I'm just going to talk to you because the ministers that preach the word I just want to talk to you and um and you know me we are not serious to one another. Um so just bear with me. Okay. All right. May the 7th, 1946, um, an angel came to brother Vanham in his cave at Greens Mill in Indiana in the United States. We all know the story, but the backdrop was that what had happened was brother Bam was having some supernatural manifestations in his life that he couldn't understand, visions and this and that. He couldn't understand it. And it was a gaming warden in the state of Indiana. So that day when he was coming back home and that home he was in at the time was the home just across the tabernacle. I mean for those of you who have been in Jeff you know that home and when he was passing by there was a tap um which he calls in his testimony a spigot like a water tap on the right side there. And when he was there the wind blew and I think he said throw him down. And he said no this is getting too much. I've got to find out what's going on with me. So he told his wife and there's a cave in Greensme where he will go to to seek the face of the Lord. So and he said he's going to go there and he's not going to come back until he gets an answer from God what all these things that's been going on in his life what they really mean. So he went and started praying and that night May the 7th 1946 around about 11:00 in the night he said a light shone in the room and he saw like somebody entered the room and he looked and from the legs up he saw a human being like somebody in the form of a human being and he looked up and saw a man like 200 lb with long hair and because he was naturally afraid you would be afraid and the green's meal even now he's in the bush so you can imagine at that time he was afraid and the voice the angel this man told him fear not &gt;&gt; I've been sent from the presence of God to tell you explain to you the mysteries about your mysterious life &gt;&gt; and he said when I once I heard that voice I knew it was the same voice that had always spoken to me. &gt;&gt; So that angel spoke to him that night and told him about his life. Now remember 1933 June 11 while baptizing the 17th person the voice had come from the skies as John the Baptist was sent to for the first coming of the Lord. So you are being sent with a message to forun the second coming of the Lord. A message. A message &gt;&gt; that will herald the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he already had that. But then there were so many things he didn't understand still. And so this angel sat with him that night and they talked back and forth and told him things. One important thing, brother Vanam said, everything that angel told him, he went back home to check in the scriptures to make sure that those things were. So &gt;&gt; because he was an angel did not mean &gt;&gt; it was okay. &gt;&gt; Because even Satan can appear as an angel of light. &gt;&gt; But where you'd always catch him was that he cannot stay on the world. He will always deviate from the world. That's the example from our prophet. Back to the word. Back to the Bible. Not it sounds good, it sounds nice. It's got to be the word. &gt;&gt; Give me the word. &gt;&gt; Give me the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the angel told him, "You are being sent to the world." Now before this time, the world did not know William Brandham. The people in his church, the tabernacle knew him and all that. So they didn't know who he was, his lifestyle, none of that. So the William Brandon, we got to know his life, his ministry, his humility. The world didn't know that at all. &gt;&gt; We don't even know what his life was in in the real sense before that time. I mean, not we didn't know how he was because we don't have that record. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But after this time, &gt;&gt; he was introduced to the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; But before he went to the world, he had some conversation with that angel. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And the angel told him together with your message, you are going to be given because he said, "I'm not educated. All the excuses like Moses and all that. I'm not educated. They're not going to listen to me." And things like that. Then you said, "You're going to be given two signs." &gt;&gt; Like Moses was given two signs. You're going to be given two signs. &gt;&gt; One, first one, you'll take them in by the hand and you'll be able to know what's wrong with them just by taking them in because you get some vibrations and some color change in your hand. You will know what it was. And for those who were there and saw brother Bam do that, they would tell you TB was a scalllet red on this side of his hand, you will see even from a distance. Some people have seen it so many times when they will see the color change. they will know what disease it was even before brother B would call it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cancer was a bright angry red and different things like that. And then second time, I mean second sign, it will get to a point where you'll be able to discern the very thoughts of the people's hearts. &gt;&gt; You're going to be given this to go to the world. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; With your message. &gt;&gt; And here's where I'm getting to. a daunting task. Now, don't be fooled by all the great miracles and things you see now. No, it wasn't like that at the time. &gt;&gt; The there were those on the field, the Smith Wiggleswarts and the the uh uh um uh um FF Bosworth and all that and things like that. But 1945, most of those old warriors died out. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. So for a man who had only a seventh grade education &gt;&gt; to go and face the whole world, it was a daunting task. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham knew his greatest challenge was going to come from the church. &gt;&gt; He said to the angel, "The ministers will not believe me." &gt;&gt; And the angel told me told him, "No, it is not for the ministers. It is for the people &gt;&gt; and told him I want to assure you I will always be with you. &gt;&gt; It's not for the ministers. &gt;&gt; It's for the people. &gt;&gt; And brother Bam says once I heard that and that you were always with me, I was ready to go. And he said down through his ministry that not one time did he ever fail me. And that's why brother Brown will always wait and said that he's here now because he had a promise. I will always be with you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; It's not for the ministers. It's for the people. And the angel father told him in taking this to the people I want to tell you this that your gift this great gift I'm telling you about I've been sent from heaven to tell you about is not going to be effective unless you do this one thing &gt;&gt; two things really but combine them into one &gt;&gt; and one he was to do he said when you go to the people, &gt;&gt; there's a way you've got to relate to them so you can really reach them &gt;&gt; or in spite of your great gift, you are not going to be able to reach them. &gt;&gt; He said the condition is when you go to the people if if if if &gt;&gt; you can get the people &gt;&gt; to believe you. Then nothing &gt;&gt; will stand before you &gt;&gt; when you pray. Nothing, everything going to melt away when you pray. If you can only do that, &gt;&gt; not even cancer. &gt;&gt; Cancer was the great scorch at the time. It still is. &gt;&gt; Not even cancer. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. In other words, no man, no spirit, nothing in creation &gt;&gt; will be able to stand before you &gt;&gt; if you can only live in such a way the people will find it easy to believe you. Now, you know, brother Benham never I I don't I haven't found the place where he explained what it meant or how he went about getting the people to believe him. Sometimes you'll hear him on the prayer prayer line say like that, do you believe me to be his prophet? Do you believe me to be his servant? But it runs deeper than that. Runs deeper than that. And that's my testimony and that's what I'm trying to speak about this morning. Because before this time, we the world did not know William Brham. It was after this time and I believe that encounter with the angel the things the angel told him he mixed it with his life &gt;&gt; and he came out and began to live in such a way it was easy for the people to believe him &gt;&gt; you know in recent times there's been a lot of talk about brother Brandham was lying about this lying about that and all that stuff I wish those guys all the best but one young person told me one time he said I cannot understand what they're talking about brother Brandham. This is a young man struggling struggling struggling struggling with his Christian life. He said because if you ever read brother Brandham or listen him one time you will know that man did not have the capacity to deceive anybody. &gt;&gt; It was just not in him &gt;&gt; to do it at all. &gt;&gt; Even that young man with a struggle found it easy &gt;&gt; to believe William Brandham. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; What a commission that was. Now, let's examine this commission a little closeup. Uh because like I keep saying, this was before William Brennan was revealed to the world. And I personally believe that this commission from the angel how to interact with the people played a huge part in the person that we came to know &gt;&gt; as William Brham. So let's see how that encounter shaped his life and what lessons we can learn from that encounter because that single admonition if you can get the people to believe you &gt;&gt; it I believe it would turn it turn out to be quite pregnant with meaning one line one sentence but it was loaded with meaning &gt;&gt; and you and I don't know what the angel told brother Bham and brother Bham the angel told him don't tell them don't say this don't say that he had the discipline to not say he just told us this but this is my own understanding of it was more than just asking the people do do you believe me to be his prophet do you believe me to be his prophet it was deeper than that &gt;&gt; amenal &gt;&gt; it would turn out that within those words if you can get the people to believe you. &gt;&gt; It would turn out that within those words was veiled what I believe to be the secret &gt;&gt; and the process that gave William Brham &gt;&gt; the Christlike life, &gt;&gt; the Christlike ministry &gt;&gt; and the Christlike descent to a full interaction with every human being. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. a Christlike life and ministry that so displayed &gt;&gt; the love of God &gt;&gt; in his every interaction &gt;&gt; in his personal life and in interacting with the people even in interacting with animals &gt;&gt; the love of God &gt;&gt; decency &gt;&gt; like brother Oie read the quote tell the animal oh I'm so sorry I barge into your place he said he wanted to reach for his gun holy spirit said no and said I'm So I mean to reach for his god but his gun wasn't even there and God let that happen on purpose. The prophet teaching us apologizing to an animal with no soul. &gt;&gt; But that was such the life he had &gt;&gt; a life of love. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory &gt;&gt; in those words if you can get the people to believe you was hidden the tutoring by the Holy Spirit. In those words was hidden the mentoring by the Holy Spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; And by these processes, brother Brandham was able to achieve the life and ministry that he had that set him so far apart from his contemporaries, from all other ministers, till there was never a ministry like his since the time of the apostles, &gt;&gt; till his ministry revealed and identified the shout in the coming of the Lord. So in those words the angel told him it wasn't just about so when you get in the prayer line ask them do you believe me to be prophet it was deeper than that &gt;&gt; in those words was really the secret and the process that gave William Branham that Christlike life the Christlike ministry and the Christlike interactions in his interaction with the people because he was sent to the people, not to the ministers, to the people. &gt;&gt; And if the ministers want to receive it, they had better become part of the people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And like Peter and John of old, they went about and the people took notice and knowledge that they had been with Jesus. Same way William Bham went about and they took notice that he had been with Jesus. They took notice that never a man spoke like this man. Never a man did the things on this earth that this man is doing since the days of the apostles. And they took notice that Jesus Christ was very in Bam. &gt;&gt; And the people gladly believed him &gt;&gt; just like the angel said. &gt;&gt; And you and I saw the result. Not even cancer &gt;&gt; go stand before him. &gt;&gt; Not even wild animals go stand before him. &gt;&gt; No critic, nothing, not even nature go stand before him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you can only get the people If &gt;&gt; you can only get the people &gt;&gt; to believe you. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, William Bannon found the life, the secret, the process that given the life that was easy for the people to believe him. And because of that, what the angel told him that May evening of 1947 came to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean 1946. This admonition by the angel to get the people to believe. So encapsulated brother Bam's life and ministry. The people. The people. Brother Kame, I read the quote yesterday about the voice of healing and brother God lining say fine gentlemen but you know the the story and all that and said brother B why did you do that he said I'm not after the s he's after I'm after the people &gt;&gt; that's all he never forgot his commission it's about the people it's not about you it's about the people &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; that's the gospel hallelujah &gt;&gt; Amen So in my opinion, I'll say it again, that admonition from the angel was way deeper than the act of asking the people on the prayer line, do you believe me to be God's prophet? Friends, it was way deeper than that. Because I can assure you that if that prophet had had a questionable personal life &gt;&gt; or a questionable relationship with the people that he ministered to, &gt;&gt; if he was in quarrel with everybody in this church, &gt;&gt; if Brother Brham had had a less than honorable reputation among the people, &gt;&gt; if he had a life full of anything but the pure spirit of God showing forth the love of God in his life. &gt;&gt; If he not reflect &gt;&gt; and represent Jesus Christ well to the people, no matter how gifted he was, &gt;&gt; his ministry would not have been &gt;&gt; that effective. It would not have had the effect that it had &gt;&gt; to those people. And definitely definitely the incredible success he had he would never have had it even though he had the gift &gt;&gt; but it takes the people bam said I'm not the one operating the gift is you operating the gift &gt;&gt; the people would never have believed this shy of a minister I know he's gifted so what &gt;&gt; so it's not about the gift &gt;&gt; it's not about the preaching &gt;&gt; it's not about you know it's not no about none of that &gt;&gt; it's deeper than that. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. I'm just talking to you and I'll try to run. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let's examine. Let's dig deeper still. This coming to brother Brandham. If you can get the people to believe you, nothing, not even cancer, will be able to stand before you. Our believer would have asked the angel, "How do I get the people to believe me?" &gt;&gt; Is a question I've always asked myself &gt;&gt; and I wasn't satisfied that the answer laid in only. &gt;&gt; Do you believe me to be God's prophet? I never it never registered with me that was where the answer was. &gt;&gt; Don't ask me for a quote because I don't have a quote. But I believe brother Bam said he spoke to the angel a lot of things asked him a lot of questions and the angels took him to the scriptures and explained things to him about his ministry and about things. Brother Bam would have asked him how do I get the people to believe me? Because we think once I'm pastor the people automatically must believe what I'm telling them. No, it doesn't work like that. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I said no, it does not work like that. &gt;&gt; No, it doesn't. No. Let me say it again. It doesn't work &gt;&gt; like that. &gt;&gt; Well, let me make it very plain and easy for you. You are dad and mom, right? &gt;&gt; How many things you tell your children? &gt;&gt; That doesn't take what you are saying to them. Even though you'll be dad and mom, &gt;&gt; even with your children, you get to live and handle them in a way they would easily do what you tell them to do. &gt;&gt; They would easily believe you &gt;&gt; that in their best interest what you are telling them. But many of us don't live that way. We just feel authority. I'm head of the home. I'm head of the church. You do what I say or you get out of here. It doesn't work that way. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; So this admonition from the angel, you may be seated to brother Bannam. One sentence but has two house. Two house in it. Two house. Two halves to that admonition. First half, if you can get the people to believe you. Second half, nothing &gt;&gt; will stand before you. &gt;&gt; And these two house are definitely intertwined. &gt;&gt; In other words, you must have one before you have the other. &gt;&gt; Remember in the Bible when they said Lord, which is the great commandment in the law? &gt;&gt; They asked for one commandment. Jesus said these are the two great commandments. He broke those two great commandments to two. Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, with all mind, with all thy strength. And a conjunction meaning something had happened and taken place before. And the second is like unto it. &gt;&gt; Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. Jesus tied the whole of the Old Testament, the ten commandments. Moses on Mount Si crossing the Red Sea, he tied it all up &gt;&gt; into these two commandments. &gt;&gt; Same way. Same way. Same way. on these two things through these two instructions h the way I understand it the whole secret of William Bham's success in his personal life and in his ministry and his interactions with people till even his enemies said brother Brandham he was a very ethical person &gt;&gt; I don't agree with his doctrine but he was a very ethical person &gt;&gt; I heard that from his worst critics So just like the two great commandments where the second one you can't just love your neighbor and not love God, you have the ability to love your neighbor at all because it coming from thou shall love the Lord thy God and then &gt;&gt; it will filter into loving your neighbor as yourself. Same way &gt;&gt; this here Get the people to believe you first, &gt;&gt; not beat them down. You don't believe the pastor. You don't believe anything here. No, &gt;&gt; it doesn't work like that. It will never work like that. Not even with your children. &gt;&gt; And then the second half will automatically come from the frost. &gt;&gt; If you get the people to believe you, &gt;&gt; then people will find it easy to believe when you're praying for them. &gt;&gt; They f the rest of the skies &gt;&gt; because the first happened, the second can follow it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, hallelujah. Amen. So because the first happened, the second will follow automatically. And the second have not even cancer did not mean only illnesses. That's why I showed you even animals couldn't stand before him. Even the natural elements couldn't stand before him. &gt;&gt; It could stop the sun, &gt;&gt; whatever. So it wasn't just but cancer was a thing that was scary to the then known world even now it still is. &gt;&gt; So in other words everything cancer and under it &gt;&gt; man's spirit nature will not be able to stand before you &gt;&gt; if you can get the people to believe you. &gt;&gt; If it's so powerful if you get so much benefit from getting the people to believe you. Don't you think it's needful that you and I look a bit more closely into how to get the people to believe you? &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you think it's worthy of something to investigate? How to get the people to really believe you? Because I can tell you, they are not going to believe you because you are the pastor. They're not going to believe because you are fivefold. They're not going to believe you for that. Because if that was the case, the angel would have told William Brandham, you are a prophet. Same with the message. the the the the me the voice came 1933 years before &gt;&gt; telling me he was sent with a message to forerun the forerunner of Christ &gt;&gt; it could not even tell the people &gt;&gt; I'm forunning the message of Christ the coming of the Lord so you got to listen to me it's not going to cut it &gt;&gt; can you say amen &gt;&gt; I hope I haven't lost you yet &gt;&gt; now I'm only I'm just warming Hallelujah. So the second half of the statement, not even cancer will be able to stand before you was an inference that not any man, nor any spirit, nor anything in creation, no matter how difficult, how challenging, will be able to withstand him as he ministered. Christ to the people. &gt;&gt; Don't you want to have that? &gt;&gt; I want to have it. &gt;&gt; I want to have that. I long to have that. &gt;&gt; Not for me, not for you, but so that our ministry will be more effective &gt;&gt; to the people to whom we have been sent. &gt;&gt; Not just preach a message and then we feel that was great. &gt;&gt; But what's the effect of it in the people's lives? Amen. &gt;&gt; What's the effect of the great mysteries you are preaching? I'm preaching in the people's lives. That's right. So not even cancer was an inference to brother Brandon that he would have such great power in his life and ministry over men over demons. Power in the human realm, &gt;&gt; power in the supernatural realm, a power to talk, power to walk, power to live, a personal power &gt;&gt; to have his own life under control. &gt;&gt; Power over his own life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; By the life of love that he demonstrated and lived. Amen. The power over man and spirit was not an action. It's not about I want to exercise this part. No, it's an it's a result. It's an outcome. Let me explain that. You know, in Genesis, it said when God told Adam and Eve, uh uh told Adam before Eve got there, be fruitful. What's that be? I am Adam. That's who you are. I am. Be fruitful. multiply, replenish, subdue, &gt;&gt; and have dominion over all the things in the sea. The fruitful, Adam had to do it. &gt;&gt; Multiply, Adam had to do it. The uh uh sub replenish, Adam had to do it. Subdue. Adam had to do it. But the dominion was the result. When you have multiplied, when you are fruitful, you have multiplied, you have replenished, you have subdued. That all added together, that's dominion. &gt;&gt; So the dominion was a result &gt;&gt; of Adam doing all the four. &gt;&gt; Adam didn't go said, I must have dominion. I must have dominion. I must have. No. No. But he went about say I've got to be fruitful here. &gt;&gt; I got to multiply here. But dominion was a result. It was an outcome. &gt;&gt; If he did not do the other works, he would never come to dominion. &gt;&gt; Same thing here. If brother did not do the first half, get the people to believe you, he will never come to you. Not even cancer will be able to stand before you. So that wasn't an action. &gt;&gt; It was an effect. It was a result. &gt;&gt; It was an a consequence. &gt;&gt; It was an outcome of an earlier action that he had taken. &gt;&gt; In other words, he could not make it happen. That would only happen because of an earlier action that he took. In other words, Adam could not make dominion happen &gt;&gt; if he hadn't multiplied fruitful and all the rest of them. &gt;&gt; Same way, brother Benam could not make cancers bow to his words. &gt;&gt; If he did not go through the rigorous process &gt;&gt; of getting the people to believe him. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you and I as you and I can testify and we know this promise that nothing will be able to stand before him was a promise to brother Brandham of the power and presence of the spirit of God in his life and ministry. It was a dynamics the power of the Holy Ghost working in his life and ministry. And we all the whole world saw that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. and gave him a life and a ministry that revealed and identified the shout in the coming of the Lord. And I want to say I want to say &gt;&gt; running through the message and the scriptures this promise that not even cancer will be able to stand before you is representative also of the promise of the dynamics to the brass mechanics to where nothing not even cancer will be able to stand before that bride. &gt;&gt; We have that promise also. We have met the same angel. The angel called the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; who has told us the same thing. Especially as ministers, get the people to believe you &gt;&gt; and nothing will be able to stand before you. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I You didn't notice the dynamics. The dynamics redemption comes by word and spirit. The word generally the mechanics the spirit the dynamics of the word. Have you noticed most of the dynamics has to do with the physical. Have you noticed that? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Not all of it but most of it has to do with the physical. &gt;&gt; The mechanics are do with the spiritual. The world. The world. the word. But when the spirit comes on the word, &gt;&gt; it quickens your mortal physical body. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's where you have the signs, the wonders, the miracles. That's where you have the healing the sick, raising the dead, blind eyes coming open, cancer has been healed. That's the dynamics. Usually has to do with the physical. &gt;&gt; In other words, God has everything under control. The spiritual, the physical, everything is under his control and he thinks about it all. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So I believe that brother Brham's interaction with the angel before he got introduced to the world May 7 1946 is an example to you and I a shine to you and I of our lives ought to be and our ministries individual lives whatever we do whatever we are called to do but especially if you're called to minister because in the coming of the Lord there's an appearing and a coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. First he appears then he comes on the message end evangelism. Um same thing today when you see his work. Now we have already seen and are witnessing the appearing of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now remember appearing and coming is two different words &gt;&gt; to appear and then to come. &gt;&gt; Now is the appearing. &gt;&gt; He's already appeared in these last days. Amen. &gt;&gt; Referring to his ministry &gt;&gt; right here with us in these last few years. &gt;&gt; Now, now, now this appearing, it's a sign &gt;&gt; of his coming, &gt;&gt; a sign how he would come. &gt;&gt; Are you looking for the coming of the Lord? &gt;&gt; That's your sign there. Look at how he appeared in the prophet. Then you know how he's going to appear in you also. Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus appeared in Malachi 4 as a son of his coming. &gt;&gt; Let me just close you. May be seated. Of how he would come. What does that mean? It means that the Christlike life and ministry that brother Benham lived was not his promise alone. It was only a sign to you and I of how it will be. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was only a sign to you and I &gt;&gt; of how we should carry on &gt;&gt; in our own individual lives &gt;&gt; and in our individual ministries as we wait for the coming of the Lord so we might be able to reveal and identify our own portion &gt;&gt; in the coming of the Lord. In the light of this we can view and understand brother Benham's interaction with the angel May 7 1946 because these instructions from the angel to brother Benham are pregnant loaded with deep meaning. Notice notice brought down to us today the instructions from the angel above the people. uh if you can get the people to believe you. It speaks to the ministers primarily but to all of us to husband to wife to everyone but the ministers primarily in the context in which I'm speaking here about their lives it speaks about if you you you can get the people to believe you whatever is hindering you from getting people to believe you get out of the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words this was speaking to brother's personal life &gt;&gt; was speaking to his reputation. If you have a reputation issue with any of the people you are sent to, they're not going to listen to you. &gt;&gt; So, get it out of the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Get it sorted out. Get it straightened out. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you can get the people to believe, he also speaks to the integrity which we carry themsel which we the the ministers carry themselves. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The integrity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They being true to themselves, not a politician, not none of that stuff. It also speaks to the sincerity with with which they would uphold the word of faith &gt;&gt; that has been committed to their care. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; All of which things influence and speak about their interactions with the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if the ministry can have no positive influence or impact on the people to whom they have been sent, I'm here to tell you simple truth is the people simply will not believe them &gt;&gt; and if the people don't believe you are not going to get cancers healed &gt;&gt; cancers will stay there eyes will stay there &gt;&gt; because if you can get the people to believe you nothing's going to stand before you but people don't believe you. They sit down in church but they have their doubts. &gt;&gt; They sit down in church, they have their misgivings and they just are not going to believe for the miraculous to take place because brother Benham said it's not me, it's your faith &gt;&gt; that makes it happen. &gt;&gt; I just speak the word and you trust that I'm speaking the words of God and you rise up in faith and it happens. Amen. That's what brother Bham said &gt;&gt; healing comes from God. Any healing at all &gt;&gt; if you go to DBA whoever &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; I know that's against many people's theology. But brother Benam said only God can heal. &gt;&gt; So he say how will the DB be able to heal the person? Said does Satan heal? People say yeah Satan heal. But said no Satan doesn't heal. He explained that because the people have so much faith in the personal that he is talking the word of God to them. &gt;&gt; That's why they get healed. &gt;&gt; So at the same time, the people are saying this is God healing me. &gt;&gt; They don't care if it's Dia, whoever. &gt;&gt; They don't care. &gt;&gt; Same way in the church. The people that get to believe &gt;&gt; you can bash them. You don't believe the word of God. You don't see what I show you this quote. Show you that quote. It doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; You are the agent &gt;&gt; that's bringing the word. And you are part of the equation. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; All right, let me just let me just try. My time is really gone, but let me just try to run here. Um, okay. So, no matter how gifted you and I are, it matters not. If you don't have a positive influence or impact on the people, the people will suddenly simply not believe what we're telling them and we're not going to have the signs and wonders and miracles. It's as simple as that. If you think you're against some is just a small quantity to what could it be &gt;&gt; if we can get the people &gt;&gt; to believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. So William Brown was warned by the angel that the only way his great gift will be received by the people. So they'll be blessed by his ministry and his gift is when he William Brandham will live and carry himself and his ministry in such Christlike manner that will cause the people to do nothing but just believe him. &gt;&gt; This is eating to brother Vam's personal life as he is going about with his ministry. So you can't have the ministry and then you just flip flop around like that. You can do it. You cannot do it. &gt;&gt; You are cutting away at your influence and your impact &gt;&gt; in the on the people &gt;&gt; and you cannot behave and live in certain ways. &gt;&gt; It's just going to eat away at your influence and the impact you have &gt;&gt; on the people. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So you understand why brother Bham live the life that he lived. All of us when we're talking about brother Bham, tears are coming down our cheeks. Brother Bham, what a life he lived. Oh my, oh great. Oh, brother Bham, what a life. &gt;&gt; Well, I got news for you. A holy consequent life to God &gt;&gt; was not brother Benham's promise alone. &gt;&gt; He was only a sign to us &gt;&gt; of how Jesus will come. &gt;&gt; Our lives ought to be like that too. So when they are talking about us, tears are coming down people's cheeks for the quality of life we have lived before them till not even cancer will be able to stand when we pray. It's not the shouting is just the authority and the s the devils recognize that authority many time is not shouting. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. May be seated. Amen. Can I take a bit more time please? I'm getting nervous. I'm looking at the charm. I'm getting a little nervous. So this instruction from from brother Bham uh this instruction from the angel to brother Brandham went into his personal life, how to behave himself, how to conduct himself as a minister, how to conduct himself as a husband, how to conduct himself as a father, how to conduct himself in the neighborhood or your ministry will not be effective. You have brother Kmeta yesterday speaking about that woman in the neighborhood &gt;&gt; and how she was trying to damage his reputation because she he had nothing to do with the people in neighborhood but the testimony was going to damage &gt;&gt; him in the neighborhood. That's what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; But what happens many times also you and I and I put myself in limits. I'm not talking to me. I'm talking to myself. We care so much about having a great reputation with people outside, but people inside, not so much. &gt;&gt; Not so much. We can whip them. We can beat them. We can tell them this and all that stuff. &gt;&gt; Did you see what happened? Excuse me. I'm sorry to say this. Yeah, forgive me. What happened recently with the minister and the soldier? I mean the NAV guy. &gt;&gt; Would you want me to shock you? Many of us in the church on the pulpit we do that the impunity &gt;&gt; with which we talk to the people &gt;&gt; the audacity the the the gumption &gt;&gt; to talk to the people like no because the people respect they're not going to come at you many of us do that &gt;&gt; I've caught myself doing that &gt;&gt; if you will catch you, you'll catch yourself doing that. If you if you if you're a leader in any way at all, &gt;&gt; if you are a pastor or a husband, you'll catch yourself doing that to your wife. Many times you'll catch yourself doing that to your son, your daughter. Many times you'll catch yourself doing that to the deacons and the people in church. many times the impunity. &gt;&gt; Shut up, sit down, get out, all that stuff, all that nonsense. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; After all, the seven thunder revelation is only an invitation &gt;&gt; to live the life of Jesus Christ. The angel invited brother B into that life. And I'm only sharing with you my understanding of it for him to have that kind of effect because brother Isaac has gathered us together to find this lost coin. So we will not it will not just be like brother say years ago a talking festation but it will be a manifestation a living experience of brotherly kindness of the honey sticking of the honey sticking of the honey sticking. Amen. Amen. Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this instruction went beyond went into private private life, his personal life, but went beyond that &gt;&gt; and then went into his interactions with the people and spoke about the atmosphere that would exist in his relationship with the people. You may be seated. My title is the home that love built. &gt;&gt; You know what that home is &gt;&gt; should be our church home. &gt;&gt; But many of our church homes are not like that. No, not in Lagos. Not anywhere. I don't know about your church. Maybe you're like that. Our church in Los is not like that. We are still trying to get there. The home &gt;&gt; that love built. Love will be our home. &gt;&gt; Love will. Love will. Love will be our home. Love doesn't scream down on people. Love doesn't tell people get out. Love is gentle. &gt;&gt; It's kind. It suffers long. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. does not v itself, does not behave itself unseemly like the minister did and like many of us I said do &gt;&gt; even to your son to your daughter. &gt;&gt; Father, mother love does not behave unseemly. &gt;&gt; You can get your point across without screaming down and shouting down people every time. &gt;&gt; That's love. That's brotherly kindness. Put yourself in your brother's place on the matter. How is he feeling when I chop him this way? Bring him to the pulpit and shame him before everybody. &gt;&gt; Shame him and tell him and put him down. When his son is there, his daughter is there in the assembly and they are hearing you shame their father like that. &gt;&gt; The honey sticks. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, it does. You may be seated. You may be seated. Glory. So what the angel told him create an atmosphere in his life. Atmosphere of the love of God in his heart in interaction with people. Gabriel saw it and gave him a life that measures up to the stature of a perfect man. A life that like brother Kameda said yesterday, brother Joseph Martin said of him, brother Panam, you would never know, you could never know his friends from his enemies. &gt;&gt; And like brother read in that outstanding opening message, the atmosphere that you create and live in &gt;&gt; is everything. is everything &gt;&gt; and the atmosphere you live in, you create for yourself determines to a very great extent the results that you will get. &gt;&gt; Brother B said to get anything at all if you want to if you want if you want a healing line you create the atmosphere for a healing line for faith for in line. You want you want to preach you create the atmosphere for that. &gt;&gt; And brother Billy Paul said brother Brown will always stay in the study in the tabernacle until the atmosphere was just right for the preaching of the so you create the atmosphere you want. So if the atmosphere is wrong in the church, who's responsible the people? No, &gt;&gt; the pastor. &gt;&gt; If the pastor picks a quar with everybody in church over every single thing, &gt;&gt; what kind of atmosphere are you going to get? &gt;&gt; You're going to get a we versus them atmosphere. That's war &gt;&gt; in the church. fighting a battle that Jesus fought and won long ago. &gt;&gt; Now the song says, "I'm going to study war no more. &gt;&gt; I'm going to study war no more. I will fight no more forever." &gt;&gt; Some of the nonsense we have had in the message in this country, I don't know about anywhere in this country because I'm part of it. &gt;&gt; The nonsense we have some of that going on. Some of our children who are in their 40s and brother Chibbo talked this morning about coming the message 1975 50 years on we still have that foolishness &gt;&gt; this church against this church bill get on the pulpit all they do on the pulpit is to spew this poison out &gt;&gt; and you wonder we don't see signs and wonders and miracles among us how we going to see it &gt;&gt; how is love going to drop down in that arms of air we'll be standing talking all of All of a sudden, just the prince of law will drop down and all that's wrong, all that's evil, all the cancers will be taken out. &gt;&gt; It's not going to happen when we still go on like that. Talk against this one, talk against that one. And the pastor, the minister himself creating war in the church where there's none. &gt;&gt; Somebody does wrong, call them. &gt;&gt; I'll read you brother Bham today. &gt;&gt; I'll read you his quote. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me skip all this. Brother, as you read this school, let me read a quote here from Love 1956. Now, do you realize being a son or a daughter of God that you're a man of creator? Do you know that you create the atmosphere that you live in? Do you realize that the atmosphere that you dwell in, you influence somebody else? &gt;&gt; In other words, the pastor of the church has the has the power as a man of great under God to create the atmosphere that he wants to live in in his church. &gt;&gt; No matter what the prophets, what the Bible said. So &gt;&gt; the parents in their home can create the atmosphere &gt;&gt; they want in their home. &gt;&gt; It's not the children. &gt;&gt; Amen. Therefore, I say that it's it's imperative, it's obligatory for the ministry in the local church to create the atmosphere that they want between them and their people, &gt;&gt; the people they've been sent to minister to, &gt;&gt; an atmosphere where it will be easy for the people to believe them. &gt;&gt; And that's an atmosphere of love. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where the people feel the love of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Coming from the ministry. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Coming from their leaders. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Bless your heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Means you should never rebuke sin. No. &gt;&gt; But where love will be there speaking the truth, love will be there rebuking, love will be there doing all that needs to be done. &gt;&gt; But you and I know we don't do that many times. No, we don't. &gt;&gt; And when we do everything from that atmosphere that we create in our churches, in our lives of love, the love of God, people will respond with belief in the words that we are speaking to them &gt;&gt; and they'll do it quickly because they'll feel love coming back coming to you. They'll get love back to you. And Jesus say if you love me the things that tell you do them when you love you find it easy to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me read you this quote here. Brother Bramson divine love 956 because you have to come out of the atmosphere that you are in into this other atmosphere. When you do that God lifts you right up from the world and you live in a heavenly atmosphere. See and then to the wall you are just contrary to what that is. See this is contrary to the world. See, now what you want to do is to be lifted up by Christ into an atmosphere to where you are happy and peaceful and then in there you create a situation. And now many times we in churches this may seem strange but if you just watch it now this is for the church is for the people. The people get what get one another's spirit instead of getting the Holy Spirit. You go into a group of people, you watch the way that a person acts and then find people that come into that congregation. The first thing you know, they act the same way. &gt;&gt; You take a good man and a bad man and he'll either he either he'll become a good man or hire a bad woman. &gt;&gt; And the atmosphere that you live in, you project your associates what you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when the pastor has an atmosphere around him, it creates that atmosphere and projects it to his associates around him where he is. When the father, the mother has an atmosphere in their home around them, they project it to their children and their home around them. Thus say the prophet. Then what type of people ought we to be if we're a Christian? What type of an atmosphere should we live in? In a consoling, soothing, healing atmosphere. We should live in with our hearts constantly in prayer with a deep love for every person we come in contact with. &gt;&gt; If I say this to the little church, listen to this. Listen to this. If I said to the little church that's prayed for me for the world missions, that's my success in praying for the sick, in getting into a deep love with everybody I come in contact with. &gt;&gt; That's my success in praying for the sick. &gt;&gt; If I can't get it right down into the feeling of the sickness with the person, &gt;&gt; it usually doesn't do any good. You've got to come right down &gt;&gt; and you've feeded yourself. &gt;&gt; And he read this. I told this story. I'll quickly read it. You know it already. But let me to make a point to you here. Some time ago an old Mexican man down here on the platform where he run to the platform. Much faith. He fell down, grabbed out his rosary. I told him not necessary. And through the inter interpreter, brother Espinosa. So he raised up. He put the arms around me. Begin going some way. He was blind. I looked at him. I looked at them all. wrinkle up feet. Probably never wore a pair of shoes in his life. I looked at my shoes, see if they will fit him. I'd give him my shoes. He was blind. And I looked, he was wider across his shoulder, big man, weigh 200 and something. I guess he couldn't have worn my coat. And he, as he was standing there and the gray hair, I thought of my daddy. I thought if daddy would have lived to be about this age, he would have been about the same age as this man around 65 or 70 years old. And I enter into a love of that man the way that I thought. Amen. Maybe he never had a decent meal in his life. Maybe he never sit down at a table in his life and all this and then walking along in darkness. Then something come into my heart. God be merciful. He's a man. He's a brother. Then that strikes. There's something anoint that the creation moves around and is projected to this person. The love atmosphere of the Bible towards that man began to project to that man. He didn't even know how to pray for him. &gt;&gt; His prayer to this person in a few moments I heard him hollering something over my shoulder and he was hollering. I can see I can see. He said the secret of my ministry just get into a deep love with everybody. And then he gave an example. of the blind man and just go into a feeling for it. Would you know some young person in your church so twisted up, so so evil, so arrogant, so messed up and all we are is to show him and let him know the pastor authority is speaking here or you get into a feeling this young man is so twisted up. How did he get in this shape here? Oh father, that could be my son. That could be me in his age. Oh father, if you can only reach your grace out to him. That's the kind of thing he's talking about here. You won't have you may not even have to talk to the young man. And the Holy Spirit strikes him there &gt;&gt; and he straightens up without you even saying one word. We make it so difficult. So difficult for ourselves. So difficult. What was it? The blind man. Divine love. Sympathy had been projected by the Holy Spirit into this man. &gt;&gt; Can sympathy be projected from the pulpit? Empathy, a feeling of love for the people in who are wound up, who have messed up? sympathy had prayed by the Holy Spirit to this man and but that at the end of the road where he couldn't nothing could be done and love had taken its place and love had met love then sovereign grace went to work &gt;&gt; and God through sovereign grace restored the sight to the man &gt;&gt; first you have to enter into that thought &gt;&gt; that's the way you have to do to a sinner &gt;&gt; are you are you hearing me That's the same way you have to do a sinner to somebody who's messed up in the church. &gt;&gt; Many people pray for sinners. That's all right. But that's not the way to win a sinner. &gt;&gt; It's your business to win the sinner. You don't win him by just praying for him. You win him by talking to him &gt;&gt; and introducing him to Christ. That's your business. That's your duty is to win sinners by talking to them and projecting to them the love of God through the word of God that wins the sinner. &gt;&gt; Someone say I won't go to church. I sure like that woman. I like that fellow seed because you are winning them. If you stayed home and just prayed for the sinner, never went to contact him. There's very little can be done. But we got to pray and then go. That's right. Go and do it. the projecting of this love. &gt;&gt; Oh friends, it's about the people, friends. It's about it's about projecting the love of God to the people. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not for the ministers is for the people. &gt;&gt; Now, if you notice Ephesians 4 where I talk about the fold ministry there, the work of the ministry is all about the people. For the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, for the perfecting of the saints, the work of the ministry has not to do with the ministers themselves. It's for the people. It's for the people. is for the people. Even from God's perspective, it's for the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the people are God's focus in redemption, not the ministers. &gt;&gt; The people like the angel of the Bham. It's not about the ministers. It's about the people. &gt;&gt; The five ministry or any ministry is there at all because of the people and not the other way around. &gt;&gt; Like I just read to you, the job description of the five ministry is all about the people. the work of the ministry which consists of the edifying of the body of Christ, the perfecting of the saints. Without the people, there's no need for any ministry, &gt;&gt; none whatsoever. &gt;&gt; If you are not here, what are we preaching to? So William Brandham was able to have this atmosphere of love relationship in his personal life and that deep love he projected to everyone like I just read to you &gt;&gt; to the sinner to everybody to his children who were wayward &gt;&gt; to Billy Paul in his wayward state &gt;&gt; even after he was gone that influence still lingered. Brother Joseph was just a 10 year old when his father passed &gt;&gt; and then he went into drugs. This same Joseph Brandham with long hair but that love was still projecting &gt;&gt; and look at where he is today. So William Brandham was able to have this atmosphere of love relationship in his personal life and all of his interactions with the people only because first first he had a right perspective on his own love relationship with the savior first &gt;&gt; and because of this he could create an atmosphere of love &gt;&gt; in his relationship with everyone that he met deep love. So William and Brham lived in the love relationship all around. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the people could feel and experience that love atmosphere. &gt;&gt; And because they could feel it, &gt;&gt; they believed him. &gt;&gt; And not even cancer &gt;&gt; could stand before him. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So going by this example, and I'm trying to find a place to wind down. I have to leave a lot of these. Going by this example, how the prophet went about to get the people to believe him in order for the dynamics to be on full and constant display in his ministry. The faithful ministry or any ministry at all should also live in an atmosphere of love at all times. Love the prophet did both in their own personal lives and in their every interaction with the people in the church, outside the church. &gt;&gt; Those who love them, those who don't love them. &gt;&gt; Amen. And furthermore, furthermore, beyond that, this atmosphere of law should translate into our churches &gt;&gt; coming from the ministry. &gt;&gt; Trans into our churches &gt;&gt; to where every one of our churches will become and truly feel like the home that love built. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, sir. And each one of our churches will become a home with an abundant atmosphere of love and a culture of fellowship, a culture of unity, a culture of growth, a place where the five-fold ministry or the ministry in that church has been able to get the people to truly believe them. Amen. and where the people gladly believe &gt;&gt; and as a result the spirit will be flowing freely in that group with signs, wonders and miracles till not even cancer &gt;&gt; will be able to stand in any of those local assemblies. Unfortunately, our churches are mostly not this way because many of our churches it most of us in the ministry and most of us believers do not have the right perspective on our own relationship with the Lord. &gt;&gt; We don't have a love relationship with the Lord even though we say we love him. &gt;&gt; Many of us ministers and I say again I place myself right in the mix. I'm not talking to anybody. I'm preaching to myself. Many of us know we are sons of God, but we do not think like sons. &gt;&gt; And neither do we operate like sons. &gt;&gt; Many of us have a love deficit in our relationship with God. &gt;&gt; And because we have that relationship with God, we have a love deficit in our relationship with one another. We do not have a love relationship with God. We have a fear relationship with God many times. Even though we talk love, but a life that will truly reflect and reveal the love of the father, we are mostly far from it. And as a result, we are not able to rightly reflect the person and love of the Lord Jesus Christ to the congregation because we have a love deficit ourselves in relationship with God. &gt;&gt; I'll explain to you what that means in a minute as I'm trying to find a place to wind down and close here. Because we have a love deficit in relationship with God, we pass this on to the church. And this love deficit becomes the default in the church. Becomes a default where we live in the church. Even though we talk a lot of love in the church because we the ministers do not have this right love relationship with the Lord and I'm making bold to say that. So we live in that atmosphere. We have a love deficit. So we project that love deficit to the people and the people see us representing God to them because that's what we do. And so they picture God the way we are to them. &gt;&gt; That person that's always angry with them, that's short fuse with them, that can't stand them, whatever they do something wrong. Instead of admonishing them, they every small thing they are cutting off their head &gt;&gt; because we represent God to them. That's how they view God. That kind of person, you are not going to be free with him. &gt;&gt; You're going to be very edgy with him. &gt;&gt; And that's how many of our churches are. No, I don't need to give me a witness back. I know it. &gt;&gt; I've been around too long. I know it. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. have this right love relationship with the Lord. So the people also end up not having the right love relationship with the Lord either. Sure we are believers. Sure we love the Lord and we know it and I know you love the Lord. Sure we are sons of God. The only problem is we mostly have not fully believed or embraced and received the love of our heavenly father. &gt;&gt; We love him, but we're not so sure how deep his love toward us is. We must almost always feel he's dissatisfied with us. Almost always. Because the pastor is almost always not happy with you, not happy with the church about something. So the people get in that complex and see God is just never happy with them. When the Holy Spirit saying here is my beloved son &gt;&gt; in whom I am well pleased, God's not angry with you. &gt;&gt; And so the people in the church live with a constant consciousness of they must have done something wrong. No, you haven't done anything wrong. If you've done something wrong, repent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's waiting for you to repent. &gt;&gt; Not to go further away from you. Repent. &gt;&gt; When you do something wrong, it doesn't get away from you. Your sin takes you away from him. &gt;&gt; And whether you reconnect back or not is up to you. &gt;&gt; When you repent, you'll reconnect back to him. &gt;&gt; If your father loves you, he wants a love atmosphere in the church, &gt;&gt; in your life, in your home. &gt;&gt; The devil is lying to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we operate with that love deficit. Many times we serve God in fear. As a result, we're not able to fully believe for, embrace, and enjoy the blessings of our father's love that's already in store for us the place of our redemption. We know Jesus died for our sins. He died for our healing. He died for our deliverance. We say that, but how many of us really experience it? That's the reason friends the way I understand it while the supernatural not even cancer has not been a has been largely missing in our assemblies because we don't have a real love atmosphere in the place. Good brother Bham said love will be nowhere else but in the bride. &gt;&gt; You'll be standing talking just the prince of love will drop down. We've been quoting it and quoting and quoting it. When is it going to be &gt;&gt; because faith workketh by love? &gt;&gt; And because we're not just experiencing that love as we should, we're not able to trust and believe him for all that he has promised us in his word. Oh hallelujah. That's why the supernatural has been largely missing. We get it one here, one here, one there. But God wants such a flow of it to where you say there's my spirit flowing freely. Hallelujah. But I believe all of that is about to change. I believe God brought you to this ministry for all of that to change. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In your individual life in our churches to where we get back into a love affair with God. Hallelujah. Love affair with one another. So in love with God, so in love with this world, so in love with your brother, so in love with your sister. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The prodigal son's home represents the type of church home that most of our churches are even to the very best of our assemblies. Home should be a place of intimacy &gt;&gt; between all the various groups in the home, husband to wife and vice versa, parents to the children, vice versa, the children in the home to one another. &gt;&gt; And so should it be also in the church, in the spiritual home where God is the father and head. So be it at church, at home or work, every child of God should have that intimacy with God as their father. &gt;&gt; Every child of God should have that intimacy with one another. &gt;&gt; Other children of God in the same home. &gt;&gt; What this intimacy means &gt;&gt; in the home &gt;&gt; is a closeness &gt;&gt; that's not based upon anything immoral. No, but based upon valuing and loving the other person because of who they are, not because of what they should they will do for you, whether they hurt you or don't hurt you. What constitute intimacy in the right and proper context in the church and elsewhere is loving one another, valuing each person because of who they are and not because of what they can do for you or what you can get or hope to get from them. loving and valuing God for who he is and not because of what he will do for you. &gt;&gt; Loving and valuing your children, your siblings, your Christian brothers and sisters, not because of what you can get from them, but because of who they are. &gt;&gt; Loving and valing your parents because of who they are, not because of what they will do for you &gt;&gt; or what you expect to get from them. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Whether it be a natural home or a spiritual home, a home should be a place of security. It should be a place of love. Should be a place of value. It should be a place of encouragement. All of this sums up into home as a non-threatening environment where every member feels safe and secure. Unfortunately, many of our homes and church homes are environments where the occupants feel threatened continuously. I talk with many young people in this country, not many as in hundred but appreciably a number. Many of them feel so threatened in their own homes under their own father and mother's roofs &gt;&gt; cuz the parents are so threatening commanding authority. That's the only way they interact with the children. Commanding authority, screaming, shouting. Is that how God does with you? &gt;&gt; Is that how God does with you? A home should be a place of securing a non-threatening environment. &gt;&gt; Consistently screaming, demeaning, faulting, correcting all the time or make up a very threatening environment. &gt;&gt; Our home should be a place of love, &gt;&gt; of forgiveness &gt;&gt; and acceptance. Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to close here. Amen. Oh my. It's too bad I didn't do justice to this at all. &gt;&gt; But the experience of salvation. &gt;&gt; When anyone gets saved is coming home to our father God. &gt;&gt; Salvation represents coming back home to a spiritual home where the father is God. Unfortunately, many come back up to God and they are saved, come out of the world, but they don't come into the loving embrace of a loving father. &gt;&gt; Because the atmosphere in the church, the atmosphere in the home doesn't present God as a loving father. &gt;&gt; Go check Brother's life the way he dealt with sinners. You say, "But we should rebuke sin, brother." You couldn't rebuke him more than brother Bam did. When you have that atmosphere of love like that, you can rebuke sin all you want. &gt;&gt; Then you'll get the results. &gt;&gt; So many come back to God, come back home to God and they are saved, even baptized in the Holy Spirit, but still fail to operate with all the benefits that God has for his family. because of a love deficit. They live almost like orphans. This God is their father. But they can't relate to him like a father because of the way we who represent God have projected God to them. &gt;&gt; And so they come to church, they're saved. They go from a prodigal son. They become saved now. They become a prodigal brother. Prodigal it simply means wasteful. &gt;&gt; It means generous in a in a in a in a wrong way. Just spend wasting your resources. &gt;&gt; When you get saved and you waste the resources of the love of the father, you are pretty girl. &gt;&gt; I am prodigy girl. the prodigal son's home. St. Luke 15, like we read as I'm I'm I'm trying to find a place to wind out here. The father typified what home should be like. &gt;&gt; The big brother typified what home should not be like. &gt;&gt; What home should be like? With the unconditional love of the father God. &gt;&gt; We talk unconditional love and people do sin in church. and we cast them out and we major on whatever instead of looking for the sinner to come back home. &gt;&gt; This father God here in this parable here gave us an example &gt;&gt; to always make room &gt;&gt; for the prodigal son &gt;&gt; to come back home. &gt;&gt; Leave the space to where the prodigal son &gt;&gt; would come back home. Praise the Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. The father represent God. The prodigal son unsaved in the church, backing in the church. the prodigal brother saved but with a love deficit &gt;&gt; because he cannot see God as a God of love like that. So that's how he deal with everybody else too. &gt;&gt; He just couldn't see God forgive this sin here, this sinner here. &gt;&gt; He just couldn't see it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because that's how he relates to God. &gt;&gt; He hasn't seen God throw his sins into the sea of forgetfulness. Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The polygraph brother is saved but still is still so far away from a true experience of the father's love. So he becomes self-righteous. &gt;&gt; He becomes unconsciously relying on his works instead of on grace &gt;&gt; on the father's goodness. The father's unconditional love, it begins to perform for love. The prodigy son, we know who he is. He's unsaved. Is wisful of the father's abundant resources because he has yet does not understand the father's love and has not come to a saving knowledge of the father's love. But the prodigal older brother, &gt;&gt; though he is saved yet, He's prodical as well &gt;&gt; because he's wasteful of the father's abundant resources as well. &gt;&gt; He has come out of the world but hasn't run into the father's love and embrace just yet. &gt;&gt; He's not experiencing the joy of in Christ. He's often insecure &gt;&gt; and lacks the peace that comes from resting in the father's love. He just cannot rest in the father's love. He must do something. It's not enough for him to rest in the father's love. &gt;&gt; The prodigal brother, &gt;&gt; he serves God out of fear instead of being rooted rooted deep in the father's love. &gt;&gt; He serves God out of duty &gt;&gt; instead of from a joyful and delightful heart. &gt;&gt; He views God through the lens of a deficient father or parent, earthly father parent or a deficient ministry in the church. and he's reading to God as if there was that earthly parent. Consequently, he operates with a love deficit like an orphan. When in actual fact, all that the father has belongs to him. &gt;&gt; With a love deficiency, it begins to perform to please God so he can win his love and approval. And when we project this in the church, people in the church starts to perform to please the pastor, to impress the leadership instead of pleasing God. &gt;&gt; Because that's what we are presented to them that God is like &gt;&gt; the prodigal brother, he does all of this seeking to impress God and win God's approval. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prodigal brother is intent on serving God and winning God's favor and approval. And because of this, he reads his Bible and prays every day. Even though he read a Bible and pray every day, but his motive is wrong. &gt;&gt; He gets involved with Christian missions, evangelism and all that. He gives and he's serving in church and serving in the neighborhood. &gt;&gt; All this so he'll be accepted by God. Wow. &gt;&gt; He feels unwanted because that's how he's made to feel in the church. &gt;&gt; He does something wrong. Instead of running quickly to the house like this young man run back to the house, they run further away because when they get to church with their wrongs, they're going to be shamed before everybody &gt;&gt; for the wrong they have done. And so the body god brother, he puts on a performance to impress, to win approval of the pastor and God. He feels unwanted, so he must win God's approval. He feels unwanted, so he must he must meet the yard stick of the standards they have in the church. He must change his values to be accepted. He never feels he has done enough, never feels appreciated. That love deficit makes him such that he's never satisfied. Not with himself, not with other people, not with his wife, not with his son, not with his daughter. He complains, complains, complains, find complains, complains, complains because that's what he's been given. The prodigal brother is only longing to hear &gt;&gt; the voice of approval. Longing to hear well done, &gt;&gt; well done. &gt;&gt; How many times are you told that to your wife, to your children, even with all their wrongs? How many times you told that to the people in church &gt;&gt; with all their wrongs? Well done, thou good and faithful servant. &gt;&gt; The emphasis is not on ability. It's on faithfulness. &gt;&gt; Faithfulness. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The prodigy god brothers longing to hear the words of approval. Longing to hear well done when all the while God has already approved of him. &gt;&gt; Because of him. No. Because of Jesus, we have already been made accepted in the beloved. Because Jesus died and rose for your approval and acceptance in the beloved. You don't have to do one thing to be accepted by God. Just receive and accept his love. Hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. That's why the prodigal older brother could not understand why all the Mary meant when his brother came back. &gt;&gt; He couldn't understand it. He never understood once you are a son, you're always a son. He couldn't understand the mis destination. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That God saved you and he sit on a rocking chair and he said leave however you want because he knows you will never want to do the wrong thing. &gt;&gt; And should you ever do any wrong thing, God knows quickly you are going to make it right. So you don't have to go with a chip on your shoulder with a wrong consciousness on you. You are free. You are free. You're no sinner. You are a son and a daughter of God. And that's why Jesus came. Oh, Jesus is here today to break that hold. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus came to break this bondage and oppression that keeps you from a love affair with your father God. Oh, hallelujah. He's calling out your name. Can you hear him calling your name? Can you hear me say, "This is my beloved son. This is my beloved daughter in whom I am well pleased." &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, God's not angry with you. You are beloved son and daughter. If you have sinned, here is grace. &gt;&gt; Grace is coming down &gt;&gt; to you from your father. Come home like the prodigal son. I will arise and go to my father. in my father's house is great love. Hallelujah. Oh, sin should never if you have sins and they are so messed up, it matters not. Sin should never keep you away from the loving embrace of your loving heavenly father. And our homes, our churches, our natural home should be a place of home where love built. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus is here this afternoon. He wants to break every spirit off of you today. He wants to kiss your heart Aresh. He wants to break the the the love deficit spirit off of you today even right now and replace that spirit of bondage with a spirit of spunship, the spirit of adoption whereby you cry, "Aba, Father." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you in sin is your father's tail, reach out. He will set you free today and put a power in you to break every grip of sin in your life. Oh hallelujah. He wants to baptize you with the baptism of love which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. the abstract that will go all the way back to uproot that system, that fear system in your life, that prodigal spirit in your relationship and service to God and replace it with a spirit of love, &gt;&gt; the spirit of adoption whereby you cry, "Aba, Father, &gt;&gt; you won't be leaving no more seeking approval." Hallelujah. Neither will you be afraid of rejection ever again because you have come into an atmosphere of love. There's love all around here. There's love in our home. Love in our churches. Love in our lives. Oh, and we are moving up. We're moving up to where not even cancer will be able to stand. We're moving to where all of a sudden love will drop down and not one wrong will be in the assembly. Oh, hallelujah. Like William Branam, your life and ministry will be a daily walk in the love of God. Hallelujah. Brother Panam said 957 but I believe it's coming to a time Paul said whether prophecies it shall fail whether they strong they shall seize I believe it's coming to a time till when the saints will get together like this and just a lost spirit will just sweep over the audience and just every person in there all that's wrong will be taken out such a presence of the Holy Spirit hallelujah and when our church homes get to become that home that love built under this atmosphere of love. The Holy Spirit will inspire the ministers in a greater measure to preach and teach. That's the ministry of Jesus Christ to preach and teach. Hallelujah. To preach and teach the kingdom of heaven and the power of the cross of Jesus Christ with all boldness. Calling out devils. Calling the sinner to repentance. Calling out diseases. Hallelujah. Calling out those who are bound by sin. &gt;&gt; Under this atmosphere of love, the mission will be hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, pianist organist and finish. Play something softly. Glory. Play the love of God. How sweet and how measurless and strong. Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; While they are playing softly. Amen. Brother Bam on Joy. He says, "So Lot went towards Sodom and then after Abraham was completely separated from all the parasites and the hangons, God appeared to him again." I like that God came to him and said, "Abraham, come and hear just a moment. I want to show you something." Genesis 15 is talking about he said, "Lift up your eyes. Look to the north just as far as you can see, to the south, the east, and the west. I've given it all to you. So walk through the land. You are the possessor of it all. is all yours. No wonder David cried, "Forget not all his benefits." Why? You know, after you come into the kingdom of God, there's a lot of benefit goes with it. When God calls you, knocks out your heart, separates you from the things of the world, and gives you a little child training to see if you're going to hold out or not, gives you a little scolding, checks you around, get a little chastisement. All of you, all of you get it. If you are really children of God, you get a little training. Then God baptizes you into the fellowship of the kingdom and it's all yours. Then Abraham, the trials are over now. Get out and walk around. It all belongs to you. What a beautiful picture of the overcomer. The overcomer is heir of all things. I don't see what's the matter with you as Christians that you don't walk around a little while. See what you own. If I fell heir to a house, I should wouldn't want to move into it till I got in, looked everything over. I want to see what's mine. I want to see what I own. And when I fell air to the kingdom of God through the righteousness of Jesus Christ, baptized into this great archet of God's eternal blessings, I'd like to walk around, see what's mine, look on the shelves, see what's the promise there. Here it is. Every promise in the book belongs to every believer. Don't you stand still for somebody to push off in a corner, give you a little call later and tell you to wait. Don't you listen to that stuff. God's promise is right now. Push you off in a millennium somewhere. The Bible said now we are the sons of God. What we will be, we are now present tense. If anything that looks a little high and a blessing that looks like why it'll get me a step ladder, I'll get me a step ladder and move up and look at it anyhow. I look I like to look around. It's all yours. And every promise in the Bible is yours. When a Christian gets saved, God gives him a checkbook with the bottom of it with Jesus name signed in blood. Every redemptive blessing belongs to the believer. fill it out and send it to headquarters. Watch what happens. He's obligated to take care of his word. I challenge any sick person. I challenge any sinner here tonight to sign your name or your wants above a check in Jesus' name and send it into heaven once. Don't doubt the cashier is right there because the papy was put there at Calvary through the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh my. Let's go forward. If you only preach to the church justification, let's take them a little further than what we got now. Go a little higher. If it get into that, God begins to fill it with the Holy Ghost. Then let's go to divine healing and shack that out. Well, the Holy Ghost just like a great big apartment above. The people that's become Christians don't know what they own. Could you imagine me buying a house without looking all over it first? Could you imagine me owing a place like somebody gave me a big arage, big place with everything just everywhere? It's all mine. Well, that's the way it is when you come to Christ. Everything belongs to you. All the redemptive blessings that Christ died for is yours. Every believer has possession of every redemptive blessing. Amen. Is given to the believer by one spirit. We are all baptized to this great big Jesus Christ. My up on this here justation by faith. Over here is translation through the blood. Up there is joy. Here's peace. There's longsuffering, goodness, gentleness. my everything. Some of them may be hanging a little high. I can't get to them, but they got a step ladder over in the corner. Let's get up. Let's look at it. Let's see what it looks like. If they can reach up to divine healing, take God step ladder. Reach out and find out where it's all belongs to you. That's what the church ought to be doing. The church ought to be moving up the road. And I say as I close here, let's move up the road, church. Every blessing belongs to us. Let's just come and let not just come out of the world. Let's run into Christ. Let's run into our father's blessings. Let's run into our father's love. Our father's love has provided every redemptive blessing for us. Hallelujah. And they all yours. God bless you. Let's go out of here. Out of this great convention. Come and rejoice with us. That lost one that you have found. Take it back home. Take it back to your f family. Take it back to your husband. Take it back to your wife. Take it back to your children. Take it back to your church. Take it back to the people. And let's make our judges. Let's make our homes the home the judge home that love build. God richly bless you. Amen. God rich and good. How measureless and strong. Ever glorious. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Oh, heat, heat. shall fall. The love of God is greater than ever. It goes beyond. It goes beyond the highest. reaches the reaches.

Encourage somebody this morning. We all need a helping hand. &gt;&gt; We all need Jesus hands. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Glory. &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. Thank you, Jesus. Wonderful. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. You feel good today. Why don't you give him praise if you love him? Praise him. Hallelujah. What a message today. Appreciate Reolu table on the message of home that love him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Let's first get ready to bring a ting offering. Know a lot of things he said came across like a leadership address. Came across almost like as a pastoral address. But really, each and every one of us &gt;&gt; could take what was said this morning &gt;&gt; and apply it in our daily lives &gt;&gt; and build the kind of home that we want to live in. &gt;&gt; We could determine what that atmosphere is. When we really truly do things the Bible said to do, &gt;&gt; love our neighbor as ourselves, all these other things. And then healing and deliverance comes as a result of the seeds we've sown, of the lives we've lived and the love that we project. &gt;&gt; It's a really powerful powerful thing today. So as we think on these thoughts, let's bow our heads as we ask God's blessing upon the ts offering. I'm so glad that Jesus set me free. We'll say that afterwards. Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for your grace and your mercy upon our lives. Lord, we thank you for your word that has come in this hour, rightly divided, Lord, to show us how to walk in Jesus name. We are grateful today with grateful hearts. We bring them to your house, Lord. Tithesi and offerings, we pray your blessing. Use it for the furtherance of your gospel. Use it for the furtherance of your kingdom. Bless your people as they give. May you provide for them and open doors for them, Father. Lord and uh pour out of the abundance of your own blessing, Lord, according to the offerings of our heart today. We pray you bless your people today. We pray you bless it as they pick it up in Jesus name. Pray and asking. Amen and amen. Amen. I'm so glad that Jesus set me free. Amen.

Oh, today this afternoon. Oh, he is the air that we breathe today. He's our reason for living. You can keep playing softly. Amen. &gt;&gt; We just have one prayer request here. Then we pray to close out. We feel the presence of God. We feel we have the confidence to bring this request before the Lord. As brother old said today, it is God that heals. But &gt;&gt; it's our faith in God &gt;&gt; and the healing comes from him. &gt;&gt; So we approach the throne of grace. &gt;&gt; This prayer request says, "Good morning, saints. Requesting prayer for Myon Sagram uh for medical condition at Mount Hope right now and also for soul salvation." This coming in from sister Naon Kadu. She has a prayer request here. If anyone else has a prayer request this morning, feel free to show by the raise of a hand. And as God sees that hand, he's able to meet your need according to his riches in glory this morning.
