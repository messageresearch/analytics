[40:51] seven unknown thunders back there
[40:53] to wake up again he will send it
[40:56] he promised it he promised it
[41:00] there's not a promise for justinsville
[41:02] there's not a promise from new york
[41:03] or london or europe or africa or south
[41:06] america
[41:06] there's a prophet there's a promise from
[41:08] the lord himself
[41:10] he descended with a shout he bring your
[41:12] promise
[41:13] your promise say my promise
[41:16] that's your promise to give you a
[41:18] revival a seven thunder revival
[41:22] oh glory to god hallelujah praise god
[41:25] brother branham he's prophesying he said
[41:27] i know the next thing to happen
[41:29] is the restoration of the gifts to the
[41:31] church
[41:32] and it's the hardest thing i had to do
[41:34] this pioneering work
[41:36] is to do this god cannot give back the
[41:39] gifts to the church
[41:41] as long as the church is divided we have
[41:44] got to get the church together
[41:46] before the gifts can come and if all the
[41:49] full gospel people would come in one hat
[41:52] one accord there would be a revival that
[41:54] would shake the whole world
[41:56] and every spiritual gift would be in the
[41:59] church within an
[42:00] hour's time after it took place
[42:04] signs and wonders that was done by the
[42:06] apostles would be a
[42:07] minor thing to what could what would
[42:11] do if we could get the church together
[42:14] it's got to happen it will happen
[42:17] [Applause]
[42:20] it may be after i have passed off the
[42:23] scene
[42:24] but i want to put my word in this that
[42:27] you might know
[42:29] it is after he come off the scene it's
[42:31] going to happen
[42:33] why are you saying that brother over
[42:34] because the bible said there's going to
[42:35] be a unity of the faith
[42:37] oh glory to god nobody can change that
[42:40] oh glory to
[42:41] god hallelujah there's going to be a
[42:42] unity of the faith amen
[42:44] he said all christian people bang
[42:46] yourself together with one heart
[42:48] one accord for god cannot do more send
[42:50] the gifts to the church
[42:52] while the church is separated that then
[42:54] he can send the holy ghost unless we in
[42:56] one accord
[42:57] for it comes by the holy ghost oh my
[43:00] hell let's continue
[43:01] you are written epistles right of all
[43:03] men this from the unveiling of god
[43:05] he said let's translate that in the
[43:06] world you are
[43:08] epistles that have been written so this
[43:11] is
[43:12] letter made flesh
[43:17] you are written epistles so instead of
[43:20] talking word
[43:21] you are what we talking
[43:27] that is the object of being word written
[43:30] or word made flesh so you don't have to
[43:32] talk your talk you walk the talk
[43:36] that is why jesus can say when you see
[43:38] me he said he said he said you think you
[43:40] have eternal life
[43:42] hallelujah but you wouldn't come to me
[43:43] to have life oh my hallelujah not the
[43:46] written word but the word made
[43:48] flesh in other words that's rid of all
[43:51] men
[43:52] manifested word of god so peter and john
[43:55] they went up they perceived they were
[43:56] ignorant and learned
[43:57] they had no education but they take
[43:59] notice they've been with jesus
[44:01] they were ignorant and unlearned but
[44:03] they were written epistles
[44:05] read that they have been with jesus
[44:07] jesus here we go was
[44:08] manifested himself through them christ
[44:12] veiled in their flesh manifested
[44:15] made a life like he was in moses we
[44:18] talked about brother peter
[44:22] denying peter running away peter
[44:26] weeping peter christ veiled in peter
[44:30] if christ could be veiled in peter you
[44:32] mean christ could be veiling you
[44:37] hallelujah watch this incredible hari
[44:39] paradox
[44:40] this jesus of nazareth could choose a
[44:43] bunch of ignorant fishermen for his
[44:44] church
[44:45] instead of well-trained priests and in
[44:47] the missions of that day oh that a god
[44:50] that had all wisdom and could walk on
[44:52] waters
[44:53] and could take water into wine that
[44:56] could take five biscuits and free five
[44:57] thousand
[44:58] and take seven baskets left over how
[45:00] could that seem one
[45:01] the god that sesame eternity yonder
[45:04] that's bright till the sun hides his
[45:06] face from him
[45:06] the very pool of wisdom and purity of
[45:09] understanding and knowledge
[45:10] supreme of supremes that he would come
[45:12] to a place
[45:13] where a great organization of churches
[45:15] had all gathered together train all
[45:17] their men and he go down and pick up a
[45:18] bunch of dirty
[45:19] stinking fishermen that couldn't even
[45:22] write their own name
[45:23] and choose that type of man to set the
[45:25] church in order
[45:26] for his bride
[45:30] this great omnipotent god choosing these
[45:33] kind of men
[45:34] to set the church in order for the bride
[45:37] he said strange thing isn't it it looks
[45:40] like he took somebody that was trained
[45:42] he said but instead he take a church man
[45:44] instead of taking church men
[45:45] he took fishermen to do it very hard but
[45:48] that's the way he does it
[45:50] a real paradox when god took a bunch of
[45:53] ignoramuses we call them today
[45:54] holy rulers poor of the world goods and
[45:57] pour out the holy ghost on them in the
[46:00] upper room
[46:01] oh glory to god the head wasn't full the
[46:03] heart was full
[46:04] he poured out he said somebody bought
[46:06] paul
[46:07] the capo all knowledge knowledge is
[46:09] revealed you could pour out the holy
[46:11] ghost
[46:12] he poured into them the holy ghost and
[46:14] god want to pour in you in
[46:15] your holy ghost oh glory to god
[46:18] hallelujah praise god
[46:20] give the lord a shout hallelujah it
[46:23] seemed to please god
[46:25] to make his own church a paradox
[46:28] incredible but true
[46:30] oh glory to god do you believe that the
[46:32] same thing he's doing right now
[46:33] making a paradox out of his church by
[46:35] passing all the
[46:36] highfalutin and all this stuff here that
[46:39] is so-called church
[46:40] and anybody that he can get his hand
[46:42] that will open their eyes and see what's
[46:43] true
[46:44] and tested with the word of god we are
[46:46] living in that time god chooses such
[46:48] and makes it such a paradox god choose
[46:52] to take and leave them
[46:53] and set them in the ignorance and the
[46:55] highly smart education
[46:56] god does that he does that with his own
[46:59] choosing
[47:00] oh so the bride will not be wondering
[47:02] what's happened the bride will be not
[47:04] leave it for us to watch what is
[47:05] happening
[47:05] the bible will be part of those that is
[47:07] causing things to happen
[47:08] oh my hallelujah are we going good we
[47:12] going good i want to get on to this
[47:13] the script that we read was read in a
[47:15] message called the message of grace
[47:17] is something we be familiar with he says
[47:19] the rule there has laid
[47:21] the foundation with his hands he also
[47:23] tried to bring forth the headstone
[47:25] i want you to notice he never said he
[47:26] shall bring forth the cornerstone
[47:28] he shall bring forth the headstone now
[47:30] and we see in the scripture
[47:32] that jesus is the chief cornerstone he
[47:34] also is a headstone
[47:36] now if you will think for a few minutes
[47:38] that the seventh church is messenger
[47:41] was to restore the fate of the children
[47:44] back to the fathers and then he
[47:46] interpret that what that means
[47:48] in other words here we go this is so
[47:51] good
[47:51] rebuild the church again under
[47:55] the power of the spirit so for 50 years
[47:59] we were under the power of the word but
[48:02] right now i believe there's a junction
[48:04] here
[48:05] after coming up this lockout this
[48:07] lockdown
[48:08] because noah come out his lockdown the
[48:11] israel when there was an egypt they had
[48:13] to lock down to when they come out they
[48:14] was getting out
[48:15] oh glory to god in the upper room they
[48:17] had a lockdown too
[48:19] they was locked down in the upper room
[48:20] because they were waiting on something
[48:22] and god bring them out to lock down
[48:23] and if we come out of lockdown god
[48:25] bringing us out for something
[48:27] now notice god sent the whole world
[48:29] under a lockdown
[48:30] every country every nation all them
[48:33] people selling them do our churches and
[48:35] they're playing their churches because
[48:36] they could stream now
[48:37] oh hallelujah man sitting down and
[48:39] seeing where that is see
[48:41] god level the play and feel but coming
[48:43] out of that now
[48:44] is a whole different thing altogether
[48:47] it's a new season
[48:48] breathing upon us it's not the old thing
[48:51] it's a rebuilding or not by might
[48:55] not by power but by my spirit
[48:59] goggle rebuild and god gonna restore
[49:04] oh glory to god forgive me i will
[49:07] restore
[49:09] all the years all the way left out
[49:12] what people rob you from when this take
[49:15] away your blessing and take away this
[49:17] and take it with that
[49:18] you are going to restore you're going to
[49:21] return to your inheritance
[49:23] you're going to return you're going to
[49:25] get restored
[49:26] and you'll rebuild god god bless you
[49:30] you're gonna forgive your past you're
[49:32] gonna bless your future
[49:34] or give the lord a shout how many
[49:37] believe that
[49:39] he's gonna forgive your past and he's
[49:41] gonna bless your future
[49:46] oh glory hallelujah
[49:50] hallelujah glory
[49:54] thank you lord rebuild
[49:58] the church
[50:02] you see man could preach word and we
[50:04] could preach word and preach revelation
[50:07] but we can't preach spirit
[50:10] power belongs to god
[50:14] we can say what we want to say but you
[50:16] see upstairs
[50:18] you see that power god had to release
[50:20] that
[50:21] god had to give that even the beast was
[50:25] given power
[50:27] and the image unto the beast was given
[50:29] power to speak
[50:32] and this image of god
[50:36] oh i hope this morning
[50:40] revelation 22 17 you see it differently
[50:45] oh glory to god the spirit
[50:49] will come to the bride the bride will
[50:53] have a voice
[50:56] i'm not talking about not pushing no
[50:57] tape and playing tape i'm not talking
[50:59] about that
[51:02] god help me today hallelujah hallelujah
[51:07] let me finish read this in other words
[51:11] so to restore the fate
[51:14] you see people say this is more than dc
[51:17] binary review mystery truths
[51:18] the massachusetts have to take it to
[51:20] this
[51:22] all the mysteries have to be able to
[51:25] take it to this here
[51:26] because this is removable this is to
[51:29] bring forth the headstone
[51:31] and the prophet said is this the mystery
[51:33] of the thunders that will bring back the
[51:35] power into the church
[51:37] all the mysteries and mysteries and
[51:38] mysteries have to bring back power into
[51:40] the church
[51:41] if the mysteries can't bring back power
[51:43] keep the mysteries
[51:47] no wonder paul said do i know all
[51:49] mysteries if they're helping
[51:50] if they're healing it's a deliverance if
[51:53] they're freeing
[51:54] it's another anointing or glory while
[51:56] you're doing that
[52:00] but there's a mystery to access the
[52:03] power
[52:04] and that mystery is the faith that is
[52:07] what was once delivered to the saints
[52:09] because faith is the key that unlocks
[52:12] every door
[52:13] not your feeling you might be feeling
[52:14] sick but you could be healed this
[52:15] morning
[52:17] is that your feelings is your fate
[52:19] anyhow
[52:21] we had to hit the home shots we had
[52:25] so he said he said in other words
[52:28] rebuild the church again
[52:30] under the power of the spirit not by
[52:32] power not by might
[52:34] but by my spirit see at the lord not by
[52:36] organization
[52:37] not by denomination but by the holy
[52:41] spirit
[52:42] god will bring forth the church in the
[52:44] last days
[52:46] by what the holy spirit
[52:50] from jesus keepers appointments he was
[52:52] talking about the stone
[52:54] and the headstone and the capstone and
[52:55] that's the way god has brought his
[52:57] church
[52:58] from justification sound vacation
[53:01] baptism of the holy spirit and now
[53:04] musicians the ministry of the spirit
[53:07] which is what quickens the word
[53:11] oh you mean there's a ministry of the
[53:14] spirit
[53:15] you mean that's why the people doesn't
[53:17] have it right just yet
[53:19] the ministry of the spirit is what
[53:21] quickens the word
[53:23] oh glory to god i will say it again
[53:27] ministry of the world see that why the
[53:29] devil fights worship
[53:31] the atmosphere they don't even
[53:33] understand outside in the world they're
[53:34] all the music playing is to jam the
[53:36] young people
[53:37] and keep them in a certain spirit
[53:38] atmosphere you understand i'm saying
[53:40] then
[53:40] i didn't teach people on instagram and
[53:42] clap the old songs and
[53:44] and there's rocking there dead of the
[53:45] dawning some of these songs
[53:47] ring all dry no juice any songs at all
[53:49] you can't get these spirits when you're
[53:50] singing i can't even get nothing with it
[53:52] you don't have no juice they bring it
[53:53] out so much i'm not juicing it
[53:55] oh glory to god the devil fighting the
[53:57] atmosphere because when you come and
[53:58] they atmosphere you in the spirit
[54:00] and the minister in the spirit and the
[54:02] word is already spirit
[54:03] so when the word come now it could
[54:05] quicken to you so then

[54:39] sun navigation baptism of the holy
[54:42] spirit
