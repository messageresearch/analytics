[21:43] with each one and through this time a
[21:45] people begin to search for you as I've
[21:48] never searched before mainly begins a
[21:50] hunger and thirst after righteousness me
[21:53] something in their soul stood that Lord
[21:57] a job cannot give them and money cannot
[21:59] give them and the comfort of what we are
[22:02] used to cannot give but maybe holes are
[22:04] your changing hands being conscious that
[22:07] you are the anchor Lord in the midst of
[22:10] the storm father may you be with each
[22:12] one in the precious name of Jesus Christ
[22:14] from the church says a man any man I
[22:18] greet you tonight in the precious name
[22:20] of Jesus Christ if you have your Bibles
[22:22] would you tell it me so just one portion
[22:24] of scripture reading from 2nd Peter 1
[22:28] and reading from this is one to 10
[22:31] second Peter 1 reading from verses 1 to
[22:34] 10 Simon Peter a servant and an apostle
[22:40] of Jesus Christ to them that have
[22:42] obtained like precious faith with us
[22:45] through the righteousness of God and I
[22:47] was Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace
[22:50] be multiplied unto you through the
[22:53] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord
[22:55] according as his divine power have given
[22:58] unto us His divine power half is past
[23:02] tense
[23:03] given unto us all things that pertain
[23:05] unto life and godliness through the
[23:09] knowledge of him that had called us to
[23:11] glory and virtue whereby are given unto
[23:14] us exceeding great and precious promises
[23:17] that by V Z may be partakers of the
[23:21] divine nature having escaped the
[23:24] corruption that is in the world through
[23:25] lust and besides this given all
[23:28] diligence add to your feet which
[23:31] and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[23:33] temperance and to temperance patience
[23:35] and to patience godliness and to
[23:37] godliness brotherly kindness and to
[23:40] brotherly kindness charity for if these
[23:42] things be in you and abound they make
[23:44] you that ye shall neither be barren nor
[23:47] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[23:50] Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these
[23:53] things is blind and cannot see afar off
[23:56] and hath forgotten that he was purged
[23:58] from his old sins wherefore the rather
[24:00] brethren give diligence to make your
[24:03] calling and election sure for if you do
[24:06] these things he shall never for me the
[24:09] Lord had a blessing to the reading of
[24:11] his word you may be seated tonight and
[24:15] the precious name of the Lord it's
[24:17] certainly a great privilege and honor to
[24:19] be in the house of the Lord tonight and
[24:22] it was tragic that we could not be here
[24:26] last Sunday because of the flood and you
[24:29] know the Prophet said one day you know
[24:32] there'll be a last service you know if
[24:35] you're asked us a week before
[24:36] if we miss service last Sunday it will
[24:39] not be on our calendars or expectations
[24:41] for most of us we would have expected to
[24:44] be in church and just like that
[24:46] overnight situations could change
[24:48] overnight what you expect could change
[24:51] and you know leading up to those days I
[24:55] remember Thursday the weather started a
[24:58] change and the waters level starting to
[25:00] rise and some companies were already
[25:02] sending people home early and then you
[25:05] know I remember being in a conversation
[25:06] because the evening saying you know if
[25:08] this if this read continues by tomorrow
[25:10] we're looking like we in some trouble by
[25:13] Friday true to form what would normally
[25:15] take ten minutes of driving was 45
[25:18] minutes but nobody expected to see the
[25:20] highway covered to see Trinity
[25:23] impossible II mean really impossible and
[25:25] then Karen E Brooke it's bankin and to
[25:27] see what happened and and I mean it is
[25:30] such a sad thing that there were people
[25:31] who did not even make it home and they
[25:34] then come the days afterwards and see
[25:36] what was left of their home you know and
[25:39] it's something else when you hear the
[25:41] stories it's one thing to work
[25:43] look for years to get something and to
[25:45] see overnight as it will you don't have
[25:48] much to show anymore because nature has
[25:50] has taken its course and then we realize
[25:53] that all of our efforts are subject to
[25:55] at times what nature does our nature you
[25:58] know I've seen many people from
[26:00] gangsters to you name it when the quakes
[26:03] and floods come and all of a sudden it's
[26:04] not about that anymore you know because
[26:06] it's a realization that's that you can
[26:08] stop the flood you know when the water
[26:11] comes you can just push it back when the
[26:13] earthquake comes it is it is doing what
[26:15] nature does the Bible says the whole
[26:17] creation is groaning and shifting and
[26:20] moving and crying out for the
[26:22] manifestation of the sons of God so it's
[26:25] a reminder that this world is do for
[26:28] change it's a reminder to us that this
[26:30] place we call home is it's not our home
[26:33] until fire strikes is lit and where the
[26:36] random speaks of fire I will take out
[26:38] the atmosphere and every devil every
[26:40] team on every power to give us a new
[26:42] earth to give us a new place that we can
[26:44] now walk on as the sons of God redeemed
[26:47] that is this is do for redemption our
[26:50] bodies do for redemption nature is do
[26:52] for redemption can the church say Amen
[26:54] so we are grateful tonight to be in the
[26:57] house of praise to being a house of
[26:59] worship where we can gather looking for
[27:02] the demon will leave this place we are
[27:03] not gathering in church just to have
[27:05] church but we are gathering to prepare
[27:07] to leave this place we are gathering to
[27:09] prepare to leave this world to go to
[27:11] meet our brothers and sisters who have
[27:14] gone on before who are cheering us on
[27:16] seeing you got to make it these do those
[27:18] who have gone before without us cannot
[27:21] be made perfect so brother Branham is
[27:23] waiting on you and I everyone who has
[27:25] gone before is waiting on you and I to
[27:27] come to perfection to bring on the
[27:30] resurrection so fear not little flock it
[27:33] is the father's pleasure to give you the
[27:35] kingdom so I salute your feet tonight to
[27:38] be here tonight
[27:39] doors that are connected on the internet
[27:41] I salute you as well may the same
[27:43] anointing that said tonight minister to
[27:45] you in your homes and may God richly
[27:48] bless you so I have a little thought
[27:50] tonight and it's around that - it's two
[27:54] natures I want to speak about two
[27:56] natures this morning this evening rather
[27:58] and I was this thought came to me a
[28:02] little while back and originally I was
[28:04] thinking about two men in one body I
[28:06] said that might just be too much
[28:08] tightly two men in one body so I spoke
[28:11] up the two nature's because I was
[28:13] thinking I'm by the ground spoke about
[28:14] it you see when you if you look at me
[28:16] now and you look at how I was here so
[28:18] cool somebody could see this is a
[28:19] different person but it's the same body
[28:21] but it's a different person so I said if
[28:24] there are two men is one body you still
[28:26] seeing dr. Michael Williams but the mic
[28:29] already seen now he's not acting like
[28:31] the one who was here two years ago 10
[28:33] years ago 15 years ago so it's like
[28:35] somebody else is the same body right now
[28:37] but there's somebody else living in that
[28:38] buddy
[28:40] hallelujah the person I used to know I
[28:43] don't see him no more
[28:45] the person was silently pestered and
[28:47] want you to go on dream to get their
[28:49] troubles away it's the same body but he
[28:51] doesn't need that alcohol hormone he
[28:53] doesn't need to party no more it's like
[28:55] another person that same buddy it's two
[28:59] men in one body but we want to speak
[29:00] about two nature's that's how the
[29:02] Prophet puts it the two nature's kind of
[29:04] cheats amen
[29:05] I'm brother branham said you've got to
[29:06] chew aside your senses god never gave
[29:10] you those senses to trust him with God
[29:13] give you his spirit to trust in your
[29:16] senses or two contacts ETS feel smell on
[29:19] here but you yourself is that spirit
[29:21] that lives in you and when that's been
[29:23] regenerated old man died so there comes
[29:27] a point where the old man in this same
[29:30] body has got to die and there's a new
[29:32] man in this body with a different
[29:34] appetite the old man has a certain kind
[29:37] of appetite but when the new man comes
[29:39] alive this new man wants to eat a
[29:41] different kind of food it's the old man
[29:44] used to enjoy a certain
[29:45] fooled by the new man he has a new
[29:47] appetite the old man you say enjoy going
[29:50] certain places but when that old man is
[29:52] dead and the new man comes alive it
[29:55] looks like the same person you might use
[29:58] the same tone of voice I like the old
[30:00] person but the words are bit different
[30:05] somebody say man and when that's been
[30:09] regenerated and the old man tired and
[30:12] the new man born again that is a part of
[30:15] kardam then you become a son of God and
[30:17] offspring of the Creator then you can't
[30:20] believe the impossible things so until
[30:23] that old man is dead and dying it's
[30:26] impossible for you to believe you
[30:28] possible things but when that old man is
[30:30] dead know all things are possible to
[30:32] them that believe and people cannot
[30:35] understand it because the thing you're
[30:37] talking to you but I'm not talking to
[30:39] you there's a change that takes place a
[30:41] different nature has taken hold of you
[30:44] the things that troubled you before you
[30:47] don't trouble you no more
[30:48] and people can't understand it why you
[30:51] worship but it's a change that has taken
[30:53] place and a change is taking place and
[30:59] when that change gets a hole in your
[31:02] soul because it is a process it's not an
[31:05] immediate overnight transformation but
[31:08] it's a war of two natures that's going
[31:10] on inside of you because when Ibrahim
[31:12] said you were born and sin and you're
[31:14] born with a certain nature but as you
[31:17] come to church and as you get the word
[31:19] up and as you feel the anointing but the
[31:22] Branham said it this means it is a spark
[31:24] inside of you now when you were born you
[31:26] didn't realize that you had that spark
[31:28] in there but when you come into contact
[31:30] with the Holy Spirit and you come in
[31:33] contact with one another
[31:34] there's an anointing that begins to
[31:36] speak to you and you realize there's
[31:38] something else in there when you were in
[31:41] the world there was always something
[31:42] else in there when you were doing what
[31:45] you were doing it was something else in
[31:47] there another nature and God sent His
[31:50] Prophet
[31:51] he send the scripture and he sent
[31:53] messengers and he sent features and he
[31:56] has services and somebody invited you
[31:58] out up because it was a nature in you a
[32:01] deep call into a deep but the pound said
[32:04] is like that mama eager and that mama
[32:08] ego call when that ego called something
[32:11] in your heart spoke to you that's why
[32:13] even when you fall now and you make
[32:16] mistakes now when you come to the house
[32:18] of God there's a party you don't know
[32:21] that you know that you know that no
[32:23] weapon formed against you no mistake no
[32:25] child no formal up second nothing past
[32:29] nothing present nothing to come nor
[32:32] demon of condemnation nor demon up town
[32:35] you can lose everything but you're not
[32:37] gonna lose your joy because in your soul
[32:40] is a serum that you did not put here you
[32:43] did not plant it here you're not
[32:45] responsible for it and you not even know
[32:47] want to keep it up because that Sheila
[32:49] says one and he has obligated to keep
[32:52] his word his word can avail his word
[32:55] penalize his word must come to pass to
[32:58] the seed in your soul has got to come to
[33:01] pass that nature that is a part of God
[33:04] could only produce itself the carnal
[33:07] nature could only produce itself but the
[33:09] seed of the world could only produce
[33:11] itself and when that word is watered by
[33:15] the Spirit of God in the atmosphere of
[33:17] God that she'll cut only upon that seed
[33:21] of a top you add to your faith virtue
[33:22] and you add to virtue knowledge of and
[33:25] you add to knowledge temperance and
[33:27] patience and colonist and brotherly
[33:29] kindness and charity itself by these
[33:33] precious promises we become partakers of
[33:37] His divine nature we become partakers of
[33:40] the fullness of his nature because all
[33:42] that God was up he poured into Christ
[33:45] and all that Christ was that is He pours
[33:47] into the church
[33:49] in the form of his holy spirit up to
[33:51] bring to pass that which was spoken
[33:54] throughout all the Scriptures come the
[33:57] church teaming two men one body two
[34:02] natures I'm everyday when you struggle
[34:04] in your up and down right up up well
[34:06] what's really going on is the two
[34:08] nature's at war when you get inside an
[34:10] argument when you get the best situation
[34:13] when you get frustrated there's a war
[34:15] going on up because you know you have
[34:17] your ups and downs you know you're not
[34:19] in the mountain all the time you know
[34:21] things aren't peachy all the time and
[34:23] when you have your valleys and you have
[34:25] your mountains it's a war that's going
[34:27] on and sometimes one nature wins over
[34:30] and sometimes the other nature wins over
[34:32] it's a temporary transition it's a
[34:35] business of permanence of nature but one
[34:40] of these days one of these days the
[34:44] other nature the new nature will take
[34:51] complete control and by the Pelham says
[34:54] that all man dies
[34:59] take the old man off of the resuscitator
[35:04] take the old man off of life support
[35:06] tonight take the old man off of life
[35:10] support tonight we want the old man
[35:13] today we want the old man to disappear
[35:16] we want to bury the old man we want to
[35:19] bury the lion we want to bury the
[35:22] backbiting we want to bury the jealousy
[35:25] we want to bury the envy you want to
[35:27] bury the gossip in we want to bury the
[35:30] backslide and we want to bury the demon
[35:32] of lust I listen if it's dead and buried
[35:35] they can never come back
[35:37] [Music]
[35:40] hallelujah hallelujah but a shaker to
[35:43] give me back some more volume hallelujah
[35:46] if it's dead it could never come back
[35:49] you could never raise it back up that
[35:51] cannot be resurrected but the seed of
[35:53] the would in you that seed could never
[35:55] die
[35:56] and he says because I live you are gonna
[35:58] live also come to church him before we
[36:07] had Abraham we had Abram same buddy
[36:13] his height didn't change the way his
[36:17] shoulders looked didn't change his
[36:19] facial features didn't change his walk
[36:22] didn't change
[36:23] they called him Abram all his life but
[36:26] when he met God by the Tarrance God gave
[36:29] him a change of nature a change of
[36:31] perspective he left his home he left his
[36:34] way of life he left his family and God
[36:37] confirmed his change by saying don't
[36:40] call yourself Abram anymore call
[36:42] yourself Abraham people who grew up with
[36:48] him seeing why you're moving different
[36:50] why you're talking different why you're
[36:53] acting different but it's the same you
[36:55] that's what the world sees it's a seam
[36:57] you it looks like to CMU but it's a
[37:01] different nature there's a different
[37:03] controller all of a sudden your attitude
[37:05] is different can the church say man we
[37:08] said it before Jacob all his life
[37:10] everybody call him Jacob but inside of
[37:14] Jacob was Israel he didn't even know
[37:17] that inside of him was Israel he lived
[37:20] his whole life thinking he was going to
[37:21] remain Jacob he lived his whole life
[37:24] thinking the way he was born was the way
[37:27] he was gonna die he lived his whole life
[37:29] thinking the name that he was called
[37:31] when he started was the name he was
[37:33] gonna be called when he finished but
[37:35] when he met the angel of the Lord and he
[37:38] was in the mean something came over him
[37:41] and the Bible said he wrestled all night
[37:44] long and a mortal man held an angel
[37:49] until the injured
[37:50] let me go please and this man called
[37:55] Jacob said I'm not gonna let you go
[37:56] until you bless me and the Bible said
[38:01] that angel had to give him something to
[38:03] go
[38:03] and the Bible said he enjoyed touch the
[38:05] hollow of his type it's not right and
[38:09] that man called cheek I've had a new
[38:11] walk still look like Jacob here and a
[38:14] new talk still looks like Jacob he but
[38:19] he now had a new name and we said it
[38:21] before you cannot charge that man with
[38:24] the offence of the other man if you have
[38:27] a warrant out for Jacob's arrest Jacob
[38:30] no longer exists because he's now Israel
[38:32] and when God gives you a change of
[38:34] nature the devil cannot hold you
[38:36] accountable for the sins of the old man
[38:40] [Applause]
[38:43] you may be seated
[38:45] I think in the Lord has something called
[38:47] double jeopardy if you convict a man or
[38:49] something you can come and charge
[38:52] somebody else for the same thing because
[38:56] somebody already could beat if anything
[38:59] I'm at the lawyer but if you charge
[39:02] Israel ready charge and Israel no longer
[39:06] dare to take if it's at Jacob rather
[39:08] will you charge and the charges on Jacob
[39:10] when is your coming a car charging did
[39:13] you charge Jacob my name is aja and when
[39:18] God calls you by name because you are
[39:22] promised a new name unto Him and over
[39:24] comment the devil come in looking for
[39:26] you all you and no I have something on
[39:28] him you say I don't know who you're
[39:29] talking about
[39:30] but that's the old me go look for him if
[39:32] you find him you could charge him but
[39:33] the person inside of this house is a
[39:35] different person the drunken you looking
[39:38] for if they can find him that's all
[39:40] right but still as far as I know he's
[39:41] dead but if you can find it that's right
[39:43] but it's a new man inside this house and
[39:47] brother Branham said when this new man
[39:49] comes this is the spirit man there's a
[39:51] new body also
[39:52] that's waited to receive this new spirit
[39:55] that's in this body because the soul is
[39:58] the nature of the spirit and there's a
[40:00] new body weight
[40:01] you that's why sickness should never
[40:03] depress you tiredness should never
[40:05] depress you because there's a new body
[40:07] waiting for you but there has to be a
[40:10] change of your nature there has to be a
[40:12] change of your Walker there has to be a
[40:14] change of your talk can the same for all
[40:22] of his life he was Simon the old man was
[40:28] the fisherman the old man was the casa
[40:30] the old man was all kind of stuff but I
[40:34] want you to understand something even
[40:35] when he got a revelation and Jesus had
[40:38] to walk Peter when his nature was only
[40:40] finally changed in the upper room but
[40:44] when his nature was changed in the upper
[40:46] room the fear he had in the old man
[40:48] disappeared before the change of his
[40:52] nature this same man if you saw him he
[40:54] was gonna look frightened he was afraid
[40:56] to testify but he found said they were
[40:58] scared but when his nature change where
[41:01] the handi he walked out right into the
[41:03] streets where the Branum said i said
[41:05] these men are not drunk as you suppose
[41:06] but this is that which was spoken by the
[41:10] Prophet Joel and the last is appalled by
[41:13] spirit upon all flesh think it not
[41:21] strange they looked at Jesus he is not
[41:24] this Joseph's son but we watch him grow
[41:27] up it's not this Joseph's son so what do
[41:32] you think the world is saying what do
[41:33] you think the devil is saying that's
[41:34] what he never knew about Jesus little
[41:36] that's why his if thou be because he
[41:39] tried to figure him out and through your
[41:41] daily world if they were trying to
[41:42] figure you out if don't be but the same
[41:45] way Jesus was on the mystery and he did
[41:47] not reveal who he was to him because he
[41:52] was the devil no explanation
[41:55] you'd have to explain why you worship
[41:57] the devil you don't have to explain why
[42:00] you're in church to the devil you don't
[42:02] have to explain why you believe here you
[42:03] have no explanation to the devil because
[42:07] you are confident in who you are you are
[42:09] confident in your purpose you are
[42:11] confident in the words seen in your soul
[42:13] so you walk boldly to the throne of
[42:15] grace and every time the devil shows
[42:18] something at you you shake it off and
[42:20] you walk forward
[42:21] because it's a nature in you that knows
[42:23] where it comes from that knows where
[42:25] it's going that knows these things can
[42:27] the church same look at Saul he
[42:34] persecuted the Christian this is a hard
[42:36] one because the Bible says when Saul
[42:41] became poor that the believers it wasn't
[42:46] easy women could imagine Berlin as a
[42:51] brother who was pleased to get a nice
[42:53] easy one who kills even but it had to
[43:01] take note that that is not the same man
[43:03] he might look the same he might smile
[43:05] the same he might walk the same with a
[43:07] different nature and when there's a
[43:09] different niche in there you have to
[43:11] look beyond the physical because as a
[43:13] change taking place but there Branham
[43:15] said every time you come to Childress a
[43:16] change taking place that is invisible to
[43:18] the naked eye and as you don't know what
[43:21] God is doing in someone's life so you
[43:23] can't judge anybody because you don't
[43:25] know what God is doing on the inside oh
[43:27] can the church say man I remember by the
[43:31] mic even by the mic he first came the
[43:32] church can I talk about you brother
[43:35] remember the mic he first came is just
[43:37] my Musa you can't even remember remember
[43:39] the mic he had as his dreadlocks and
[43:41] stuff and I remember preaching I was a
[43:43] young boy then see him but Mike he's
[43:47] coming to service and he's just coming
[43:49] and he's listening and he's watching and
[43:51] without anybody having to tell him
[43:53] anything one day he came and he didn't
[43:55] even recognize him anymore
[43:56] because he cut his here because
[43:58] something it was not somebody said this
[44:00] is the rule but the would begin to speak
[44:03] to a nature that he didn't know but it
[44:05] was pulling all at
[44:06] pulling all the time pulling and then he
[44:09] broke ours and when you broke up you
[44:10] cannot put a bullet back in my egg when
[44:13] in brick so it kind of anymore the
[44:17] fact that it broke out of the egg meant
[44:19] it got too big it got uncomfortable and
[44:23] that closed way of living and when you
[44:25] born in sin and iniquity it's a closed
[44:28] way of living it's a lot of pressure
[44:30] when you're living in sin it's a lotta
[44:32] pressure when you're doing who you are
[44:34] but when you begin to know who you are
[44:35] and know that there's joy unspeakable
[44:37] and full of glory hallelujah
[44:41] my brother here spoke to the young
[44:43] people a couple of weeks ago and he says
[44:45] somebody I'd say more Tonica ticket he
[44:49] said I want to know what time it got
[44:50] taken
[44:51] he said he all time tronic you see a cop
[44:53] Biden stomach in this store this time I
[44:56] have real joy this tonic have real peace
[44:58] and when you get this tonic it makes you
[45:01] feel young it makes you smile it makes
[45:04] you laugh it makes you happy whenever
[45:07] don't move me to take more of this tonic
[45:10] but you know you could get more and
[45:12] there's more and there's more it's an
[45:14] inexhaustible fountain this supply is
[45:17] everlasting and you do need to pay for
[45:19] it
[45:20] because it belongs to you can the church
[45:23] shame and so what are we talking about
[45:26] when I talk about dying to the old
[45:29] nature dying to the old man you see it
[45:33] would listen to the Prophet he said it
[45:35] would have been natural to me to drink
[45:37] my daddy drank it would have been
[45:41] natural for me to use tobacco my daddy
[45:44] did my generation behind me some said
[45:47] why didn't you never smoke or drink he
[45:49] said when I was a lad before I started
[45:51] in today the Holies heard him down and
[45:52] said don't you do it he said there is
[45:55] the conversion you see in the beginning
[45:56] and went way back before that the
[45:59] morning I was born but about I'm going
[46:00] back to how the nature in him that he
[46:03] didn't even know was there
[46:04] oh he said I was born into a family I
[46:07] could have been just like them but
[46:08] something got ahold of me something
[46:11] arrested me something locked me up can
[46:14] the church say
[46:15] man I want to talk about Moses a little
[46:18] bit but I'm animus speaking he said when
[46:21] he walked up reverently took off his
[46:23] shoes go out told him said I've seen the
[46:25] affliction of my people I've heard their
[46:27] groans and moans and I'm coming down to
[46:29] deliver them and I want you the one that
[46:32] made a failure 40 years ago I want you
[46:36] to go right back
[46:38] hallelujah Oh blessed be the name of the
[46:41] Lord
[46:41] grab back and backtrack yourself I'm
[46:44] selling you right on all Moses said I
[46:47] can't talk very good Lord said I'm kind
[46:49] of slowest Peter just can't do it he
[46:52] said who made the Mount of man and he
[46:54] began to really cool coal Moses don't
[46:56] and that's the way God does brother he
[46:58] shakes you down to have to build up
[47:00] again and that's the way the people that
[47:02] they you don't like to get broke up
[47:04] that's why I said take the old man off
[47:07] of the resuscitator take him off of life
[47:10] support on a week in my company cuz once
[47:14] the old man is accessible that's what
[47:15] Peter did Jesus died Peter said let me
[47:18] go back fishing went back straight back
[47:19] fine back his body that he had left
[47:22] another way any boat because the last
[47:25] time we saw a pizza and the boat and
[47:27] efficient is when he got him Donets
[47:30] broke and he jesus said come follow me
[47:32] he left it
[47:33] it was fishes there was body and he
[47:35] abandoned the ship soon Jesus then he
[47:38] went back and find whatever he had
[47:39] abandoned and many times with us the
[47:42] moment things go wrong we go back to the
[47:44] old nature you can understand back but
[47:47] when Peter maybe up Aroon the old man
[47:51] died there was nothing to go back to and
[47:55] I was sharing with someone the a few
[47:57] days ago about when he panniers entered
[48:00] into Mexico many ships had left from
[48:04] Europe to come into the Americas and
[48:07] everyone had filled you know the story
[48:10] and forgot his name now anybody remember
[48:15] Cortes when Cortez landed on the shore
[48:18] of Mexico without telling everybody he
[48:20] told him when the men go to sleep burn
[48:24] the ships this was his secret strategy
[48:27] see
[48:28] under ships and around if it's 2:00 in
[48:31] the morning the ship start building and
[48:33] everybody run out stream and he even
[48:35] Cortez alone come by they escaped many
[48:39] ships by baby ships moving but that
[48:43] morning after the dust settles Cortez
[48:45] truly man you see what fellas we can't
[48:47] go back we can't go back there's no
[48:51] turning back we have to go forward and
[48:53] be able to rebuild a ship but to rebuild
[48:56] his ship we need to take the land and
[48:57] those men closed off the back door of
[49:01] going back into their past and you see
[49:03] when you have a back-up plan in your
[49:05] mind you never give a hundred percent
[49:07] effort to go in forward that's why
[49:10] having a fallback is a problem for a lot
[49:12] of people because you fall back
[49:14] restricts your ability to put a hundred
[49:16] percent of your effort I'm going forward
[49:19] so when you have a fallback I see
[49:21] whether this is still my friend you know
[49:22] that person is trouble but you know when
[49:26] I can find my brother I'll call back
[49:28] this friend that's what truly people
[49:30] delete the numbers and block the numbers
[49:34] because if you go back there you're you
[49:36] you cannot get in trouble if you leave
[49:39] them alone but when you cut off that
[49:45] nature cutter I said listen I'm not
[49:47] going back to speed I have to go forward
[49:48] I'm not going back in your world you
[49:51] could take the whole world but give me
[49:53] Jesus I'm not going back there you have
[49:56] to make up your mind you're not going
[49:59] back there can the church say man that's
[50:03] the way the people eat eat all I think
[50:04] it broke up you got to be broke up
[50:06] before you can be remade the Prophet
[50:09] went down to the potter's house to get
[50:10] broke up to get in the wheel and spun
[50:13] out something different if you're a
[50:15] sinner get on the wheel God will break
[50:18] you up mold you different shape your
[50:20] life up different shape your home life
[50:22] different can the church name him and
[50:25] notice that I'm Musa said Lord I can go
[50:28] but God was determined that he was going
[50:31] and God is he tell me tonight that you
[50:33] are gonna make it and he said Moses you
[50:35] must go and he said show me your glory
[50:38] Lord and notice God told Moses was
[50:40] that in your hand he said it's a stick
[50:42] of a rug
[50:43] just an old dry stick of the desert
[50:45] where he had walked along with this in
[50:47] his hand that maybe all that he had was
[50:49] his stick and maybe you haven't got that
[50:51] much this is the profit speaking but
[50:53] whatever you got give it to God look
[50:55] what he did with that sick and that was
[50:57] the same kind of a pole at the serpent
[50:59] it was made out here was made in a
[51:00] wilderness representing Christ he true
[51:03] it down and return it to sneak Judgment
[51:05] already passed judgment the serpent from
[51:07] the Garden of Eden already judged picked
[51:10] it up by the tail and had become again a
[51:12] stick put his hand in his bosom to
[51:14] leprosy took it out put it back and
[51:16] again and it was clean when he took it
[51:18] out again then surely he had wanted to
[51:20] seek God's glory divine healing is
[51:23] included in the glory of God heal them
[51:26] another thing showing that the heart is
[51:28] deceitful full of leprosy and the hand
[51:30] that sways the power God's power rod has
[51:33] to be clean me divinely clean and he put
[51:36] his hand in his bosom
[51:37] it was healed with leprosy took it out
[51:39] and he could heal that stick of it again
[51:41] then he's seen his glory after he's seen
[51:43] his glory he didn't care how many
[51:45] critics or anything else he was on his
[51:47] way to Egypt and any man or any woman
[51:49] not standing all from a critical
[51:52] condition but will accept the
[51:54] unadulterated Word of God and believe it
[51:57] in your heart all the devils out of hell
[51:58] can't upset you then certainly not can
[52:01] the church say man Oh hallelujah
[52:07] Oh glory glory and glory I'm Arab and I
[52:10] went to see Moses with a changed man not
[52:13] with all of his education his money give
[52:15] him not with all the education the
[52:17] military geniuses that he has a pharaoh
[52:19] have trained him to be and Moses took a
[52:22] great choice Moses said and steam the
[52:25] reproach of Christ greater treasures
[52:27] than that of Egypt can the church say
[52:30] man what you need today is the come face
[52:33] to face with the fact and be born again
[52:35] with an old-time Holy Ghost experience
[52:38] like they had back in the Bible days
[52:40] again and accept Jesus Christ as they
[52:42] did then a vision of that will change
[52:45] your whole being my brother my sis
[52:48] make you a different person be born
[52:50] again see the vision of the Lord where
[52:52] God appears the signs of God a change
[52:54] man
[52:55] he got a new vision keep him out of
[52:57] Egypt you couldn't do it if you had to
[53:02] but if enemy said he was scared before
[53:04] the encounter he was scared of all the
[53:07] Egyptians because he was wanted for
[53:09] murder but now try to stop him he got
[53:12] close to God he'd seen an angel a vision
[53:15] had come before him he had a warmed up
[53:17] to the fire of God he got his hot warm
[53:19] when he was standing there he had seen
[53:22] some miracles and supernatural things
[53:24] the people was going to disbelieve him
[53:26] but God had been with him oh you might
[53:30] be a little coward grocery man or a
[53:32] doctor or a lawyer
[53:34] whatever you was set back in the corner
[53:36] joining some church or something I'm
[53:38] thinking you all right but you get into
[53:41] the presence of Almighty God someday
[53:44] where the power and fire of quarters are
[53:46] falling you'll be a different person
[53:48] you'll tell your doctor friends that
[53:51] Jesus Christ lives and reigns of you
[53:53] will tell every person that comes into
[53:54] your grocery you will tell your clients
[53:57] as a lawyer or whatever it is that Jesus
[54:00] Christ is raised from the dead and he's
[54:02] the same yesterday today and forever but
[54:05] you can't do it standing looking at it
[54:07] you have got to get into it give it
[54:09] yourself personally notice he's a new
[54:12] man how he goes know how the world will
[54:15] could decide you when you do this don't
[54:17] expect a flower bed of either God so the
[54:26] Moses who left Egypt who left scared
[54:28] that's not the Moses who went back he
[54:31] look the same way and I made this look a
[54:33] bit more tired but when you spoke to
[54:35] Pharaoh
[54:36] Hiro recognize this is a little
[54:38] different manner what he did in front of
[54:40] here or Cairo recognized something at
[54:42] changing his life and one of these days
[54:44] a change is gonna come over you a chain
[54:47] that your family will see a change your
[54:50] co-workers will see a change that your
[54:52] boss will see a change that your
[54:54] neighbor will see and when that change
[54:56] take place the devil can
[54:58] ever he could never twist you around
[55:00] anymore because it's a change on the
[55:02] inside instead of outside that I put on
[55:05] it's not a show is that you trying to be
[55:07] nice up but it's from the heart so you
[55:10] can't help but sweet good things you
[55:12] can't help but live like Christ because
[55:14] Christ is living inside of you Oh
[55:23] blessed be the name of the Lord
[55:28] everybody feeling fine and I was seeing
[55:31] is the proper to speak in here
[55:33] this isn't a message communion this is
[55:36] December the 12th 1965 this is a few
[55:40] days brother kangri before the prophet
[55:42] leaves December the 12th 1965 so brother
[55:46] Branham is reflecting he said I was
[55:47] seeing this tinging for myself so the
[55:49] problem is pondering like he was gonna
[55:51] say William Branham well 40 years ago
[55:53] the William Branham isn't the same one
[55:56] tonight if somebody back there would say
[55:59] William Branham he was a Wrangler rascal
[56:01] see because I was born of Charles and
[56:04] Ella Branham in their nature I was a
[56:06] sinner I come to the world a liar and
[56:09] all the habits of the world lead right
[56:11] in me but down in there too was another
[56:14] nature present prophet it was that he
[56:23] was born that he was born wholly no he
[56:25] said I was born a ransom I was born to a
[56:28] normal family I was born to Hakeem into
[56:30] the world a lie and all the habits but
[56:32] down India - it was another nature
[56:34] present and that's the nuclear weapon
[56:39] that the devil has to watch out for
[56:41] because inside of every one of you
[56:43] tonight there's another nature
[56:46] oh I'm friends you don't even know how
[56:50] powerful it is you don't even know that
[56:52] even how powerful it is friends see but
[56:57] down in there was another meteor present
[56:59] see predestinated wasn't there by God in
[57:02] his same body see two nature's in their
[57:06] place in the world he said well I only
[57:10] cater to one as it grew die good as a
[57:12] baby panda this is the first thing you
[57:16] know I become a liar become everything
[57:18] else as a sinner because I was raised up
[57:20] that way but down in there was a little
[57:22] speck of life all the time whenever I
[57:26] said you see room as a little boy
[57:28] sharing some little not good before he
[57:30] leaves I hope I'm not hauling you too
[57:32] long this is the prophet speaking
[57:33] sitting on the creek back in that city
[57:36] and look around at night time pop and
[57:38] mom they've gone on now today arrest and
[57:41] them days they were sinners there was no
[57:42] Christianity in our homes at all I want
[57:45] you to listen young people it's not a
[57:47] brother branham grew up in a Christian
[57:49] home with her with a pray altar but a
[57:52] band said there was no Christianity in
[57:54] our homes at all all my drinking and
[57:58] parties and carrying and on it made me
[58:00] sick so that nature it was a merry or
[58:04] the media was getting disturbed by it
[58:06] he said I take my lantern and my dog and
[58:10] go to the woods to stay all night
[58:12] so that nature in him was taking him
[58:14] away from the parties his family was
[58:16] having at the house can the church say
[58:19] Amen it made me sick he said in the
[58:23] wintertime had haunted the party was
[58:25] over so the Prophet this is where it
[58:27] starts took up hunting with a cannula to
[58:29] get away from the party in the house
[58:31] maybe daylight in the morning come home
[58:34] wouldn't be over idly on top of a shed
[58:37] and sleep waiting for daylight to bring
[58:40] us a little boy can the church shame him
[58:44] and then I think of how that time that
[58:46] being out there in the summer time get
[58:48] my sticks and put them down for the
[58:50] little windbreak where if it rained
[58:51] lately and have the pools taking
[58:53] underwater fishing my old dog
[58:56] laying there I said look here you know
[58:57] the last winter
[58:58] come true here one night I built a fire
[59:01] right here when I was waiting for my old
[59:03] dog here to tree and I had a fire there
[59:05] it froze five inches deep in the ground
[59:07] but little floor where did you come from
[59:11] see well where did you come out from who
[59:13] come out here and planted you and what
[59:15] hothouse did they bring you out of or
[59:17] what about it where you come from see
[59:19] the little flower at see why I was froze
[59:21] and everything and I built a fire on top
[59:23] here
[59:24] besides the freezing element there was a
[59:26] heat element so the property's beginning
[59:29] the type right this we seen it's frozen
[59:31] over there should be no life who put the
[59:34] tree there but he said beside the
[59:35] freezing element they had to be some
[59:37] heat element to keep this tree alive to
[59:40] keep this flow alive and he's tapping it
[59:42] in the midst of the nature of your life
[59:44] there's a heat element in the midst of
[59:47] the winter of your life there's a heat
[59:49] element that's burning and no matter how
[59:52] you cover it up that heat element is
[59:54] still burning your child might be in
[59:56] trouble right now
[59:57] but there's another nature that's there
[59:59] that's still burning don't give up on
[1:00:01] your children tonight what was it
[1:00:08] there was another William Branham see
[1:00:09] that's a prophet see a little spot of
[1:00:12] eternal life down there the genes of God
[1:00:16] the Word of God I was placed in there
[1:00:18] each one of you can think of similar
[1:00:20] things see it's working
[1:00:21] can't you say man I mean all at once I
[1:00:25] looked and I said I'm not the son of
[1:00:26] Charles and Ella Branham there's
[1:00:28] something calling like my little eager
[1:00:30] I'm not a chicken there's something I'll
[1:00:32] be honest somewhere or great Jehovah
[1:00:34] whoever you are
[1:00:36] open up I want to come home there's
[1:00:38] something in me calling then I was born
[1:00:40] again that little life was laying there
[1:00:42] the life of water was poured upon it
[1:00:45] then it began to grow know that all life
[1:00:47] was forgiven put in the sea of
[1:00:49] forgetfulness
[1:00:50] to never be remembering and no more
[1:00:52] ceased and justified as though we never
[1:00:55] had sinned in the presence of God can
[1:00:58] the church say man
