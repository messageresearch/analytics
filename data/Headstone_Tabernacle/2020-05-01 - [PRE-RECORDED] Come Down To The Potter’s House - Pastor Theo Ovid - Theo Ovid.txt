really good to be here time of Carnival and Attilan carrying on or whatnot you could come today to hear the word of God and I believe in my heart we have a word from the Lord for you something what worked upon my spirit and I had it for three weeks now I never approached it before and Wednesday before what we're gonna go into it today so we wanna stand for the reading of the word as you want to go into the scriptures want to go to Jeremiah chapter 18 was 406 Romans chapter 9 verse 11 to 23 2nd Timothy chapter 2 19 to 21 praise God we didn't from Jeremiah chapter 18 1 to 6 the word which came the Jeremiah from the Lord seen arise and go down to the potter's house and there I will cause thee to hear my words then I went down to the potter's house and behold he brought a work on the wheels and the vessel that he made of clay was mad in the hand of the Potter so he made it again another vessel a seemed good to the Potter to make it then the word of the Lord came to me saying o house of Israel cannot I do with you as this Potter said the Lord behold as the clay is in the Potters han-soo ie in my hand o house of Israel Romans chapter 9 on the read from verse 11 see it's thinking about Esau and Jacob for the children not being here for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that call it it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated what shall we see then is there unrighteousness with God god forbid for he said to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so then it is not of him that will let know of him that runneth but of God that showed mercy for the scripture said unto Pharaoh even for this same purpose have I raised the up that I might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth therefore had him mercy on whom he will have mercy on whom he will harden that he had met thou will see unto me why that he had find fault for who had resisted his will nay but o man who a dog that replies against God shall the team formed say to him that formed it why has thou made me thus had not the putter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel on the honour and another unto dishonour what if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much long-suffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of Lizzie which he had afore prepared unto glory our last scriptures from 2nd Timothy chapter 2 verse 19 to 21 nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his let everyone that name it the name of Christ depart from iniquity but in the house they are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of Earth some to honor some to dishonor if a man therefore purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honor sanctified and meat for the Masters use and prepared unto every good world let us pray Almighty God we thank you for your Holy Scriptures and I pray that you would inspire to our hearts I pray you take this lump of clay and speak through it Lord anoint me and anoint the people to hear your world may we see what you show Jeremiah Leah shores as you told him to arise and go down to the potter's house anoint us we pray in Jesus and we ask it he men may you be even be seated go praise the name of the Lord blessed be the rock of our salvation so give the Lord some praises [Applause] so this morning our title come down to the potter's house potato this morning the subject the purpose of God according to election that's a subject purpose of God a college election I have an inspiration a work on the wheels you know we're talking about there but we're getting it work on the wheels okay let's go so have a little backdrop here I want to share with you but a brand I'm speaking about the ephesians church age Ephesus the very name emphasis has a strange compound meaning it means aimed at unrelaxed the high aspiration of this age that had begun with the fullness of the Spirit and he call that the depth of God so the depth of God is the fullness of the Spirit remember these brothers Peter and all these other brothers they were ignorant and unlearned so then couldn't talk all kind of mystery talk and intellectual talk they were filled with God in so much that they reproduce God they were called arms and ears and mouth on the earth there were God eyes on the earth so when a NASA fire came lying in the church they were dead they got killed because God was veiled in that man called Peter isn't that right so the high aspirations age that begun with the fullness of the spirit the depth of God whereby they were aiming at the high calling of God begin to give away to a less watchful attitude and as soon as it began with a less watchful attitude your life begin to tip deteriorate your Christian walk because you tear it because you have to be guarded you have to be watchful because your wrath not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against spiritual wickedness so even though you walk in this ordinary world that seems normal and natural it have demons from hell and you're over true your destruction planning your captivity so you have to walk wise redeeming the time for the days are evil Oh hallelujah so when you come to church I come not just to be empowered to get wisdom to be inspired to be anointed that is why you come to church hallelujah hallelujah so the passion to know the word the cracker gets in the spirit the vermin is that the pre-scored that become the wax coal in people's lives and they just began to go to church not going to hear from God going to do their duty unless odd and fallen of Jesus Christ begin to manifest itself as an omen in the future ages the physical vehicle called Church would sink to the awfulness of the depth of satan who thought the church would move from the depth of God to the death of stated but still remain church today move from the depth of God fullness of the Spirit to the depth of Sita it had become relaxed and was drifting already the edge was backsliding it has left its first love the tiny seed planted on ephesians age will one day grow into a the spirit of error until all falsehood of the evolutionist branches so inoffensive to human reasoning that little plant appeared to that new evil the new church and she would be received by satan the Ephesians is have presented to her the opportunity for God's best because when God scatterwork he started for in Tepito best because his work reflects his workmanship is worth reflect who hears his work reflects his character his nature this being this very person God is perfect and is what gonna be perfect so he expected the chance to be glorious the expected the church to be powerful he expected it just to be anointed yet smoke ever judge out the foot on the neck of the enemies [Applause] hallelujah he didn't expect you to say a prayer he expects to be prayin he expected to be caught in that demo on average with your prayer and on your prayer your lieutenant and his face you're gettin in here they're giving it back to him [Applause] the Ephesian danger presented her the opportunity for the gods best and for while she prevailed then relaxed and in that unguarded moment Seaton planted the seed of complete ruination in other words that Church got pregnant with the wrong seed and the life of that seed biggest unfold and brought it right down to the depths of Sita the very religion of Ephesus types all perfectly the first church is and sets the tenor of the ages to come there's gonna just go bounce quickly I want to skip that don't buy the fish tight IRA the resume of the ages he said since the fifth age aha here we go listen brought a dissemination of the word who printed because the printed press was invented in leutis time I believe it was so before they couldn't spread the word God make them they invented printing press so you get the word in print and with the word and printing out the wizard to spread all that is God's purpose just as God said in the days of the voice one of the next science they invent the audio tape to get the prophets voice isn't that right God letting that stop them nothing stop him he's got the control things he's involving things he's gonna make sure you get it waiting board of five fold ministry right thing got out passes and teachers and prophet waiting what have all these things for you to be be your own God no because God have a purpose the church become a vehicle to reconnect you with God not reconnected the church church is church that's what the devil use God is the word [Music] [Applause] then come at the joint church they're coming for the word [Applause] so watch this age watch this it was the second stage of the restoration and as we have stated previously was the tassel age education abounded this was the age of the intellectual men who love God and serve Him missionaries abundant on the world spread over the world it was the age of brotherly love it was the age of the open door it was the age a long duration and after it the loudest an age will come which would be a short one the true vine flourish in this age as in no other when one think of the numbers at woman abroad this age but holy men to the forefront the true vine spread and the false vine receded the world was pumping doesn't print it on work isn't testimony Gauri's up a lot of holy men and they were running the gospel isn't that right hadn't the true vine on the run the false man on the run everywhere the true vine when God gave light and life and happiness the fourth fight was showed up for what it was darkness misery poverty illiteracy and debt and as the false vine in its day of power could not kill the to vine neither to the true vine no bring back the false find the Jesus Christ so this thing working to ease default Concord of the truth and the chuka convinced divorce isn't that right but the first vine here we go and changed itself waiting for the last part of the last age when it would win back all except that small flock that elect the fine of God so that false vine was with him he lasted he just hanging in his sideline waited and change everybody tied him up in deception only the elect will not be receive how's that does this is make us feel as we realize that every great move of God neglected to true off the Nicollet and doctrine for the all organized and died remember what a nickel eaten is it's the conquer the laity its to conquer the people it's the Detroit the Holy Ghost and impose man rulership over the Church of God that was the nickel eaten and that's what we have a Pope today because the spirit was removed and they say we want that man let us be the leader remember Israel they wanted a king and Samuel came to them why you want the king God is a king Oh hallelujah God told Samuel they have not rejected you they have rejected me they say they want a melody or a chives they want somebody to put as a leader no a king was coming David was coming but that was God's appointed time what are the purpose went to give him a king but they wanted a king and God give them soul Oh hallelujah injured in the Bassin God I want you to have no other gods before him he must be your Lord and your God there is no mediator between man and God there is no cipher between man and God the fifl ministries are bringing worth and let you back to God because you are sons and daughters of the Living God oh I let me hallelujah so now they all move in the denomination denominations to hold the spiritually dead in food less pastures literally they know but each group was tainted with the same error I when the revival fire burn low organization took over and the people became denominations there were only nominal Christians though it who claimed the various short seemed assurance as Roman Catholic Church that they were right and all others wrong every group claiming the right everybody was wrong the stage was truly set for the daughters to go back home in the last age back to room under the mother him as we come to the last age the laude sage this is our age we know it's the last age of Judah back in Palestine no matter how they got there the idea this is the harvest time but before there can be a harvest there has to be a lightening a maturing of both the vines the median age was springtime the Western eve of the summer of growth the Lao decent age is the harvest time of gathering the chairs dining and building and garden a wheat for the Lord how is that notice that in the harvest time there is a real acceleration in reitman and there is unsecret li a slowing of growth so in other words there come a point the car grow no more growth max out then the fruit begin to ripen an acceleration of ripeness and a deceleration of growth Oh hallelujah praise what that is what harvest time represent is not what we are seeing who oh praise the name of the Lord it harvest time then they must come upon the scene in this age doors who would bring wheat and tears to maturity the tears are already maturing very fast on the corrupt teachers that turn the people from the word but the wheat also must mature and to her God is done in the profit messenger with the vindicated missile ministry that he might be accepted by the elect they believe him as the first church who'd Paul she will mature in the word until becoming a word bride the mighty works will be found in her dad always attendant upon the pure Word of God and feet oh my the false church would come together with a will conquer churches and they reckon image unto the Beast the Beast deceiveth the whole earth by means of those miracles he had power to give life unto the image of the peace and the image of the beast should speak and cause as many as to worship the image of the Beast should be killed and causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand in their foreheads that no man by ourselves see if he that have the mark of the beast no remember it was Imperial Rome that fell by the sword but she was healed of a dead stroke when she joined the nominal Christian Church and room and incorporated Piggin ISM and Christianity and thereby become the Roman Empire which we'll enjoy until Jesus come and destroyer but Rome is not going in alone her daughters are right with her and she will take over absolute authority by the World Council of Churches here we go are you ready this may seem far-fetched the Sun but actually it is very plain for all to see because right now the churches are controlling politics and at the opportune time time will manifest itself exactly how great is the control this economical move will end up with Rome as the head even though people did not envision it that way aha you've been there not expecting that no they're not even looking for that but he said it's gonna be that that is where it is headed because both wood can't feel is none right that is because revelation 17:3 16 states that's the Mystery Babylon is seated on the piece she is controlling the last or default Empire the mark of the beast means they will have to take the doctrine of the church system which is trinitarianism and the mock and hand will means to do the will of the rule Church with this great power the church system with this great power are you listening the church systems will persecute the true right this image will try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching etc how ministers will be forbidden to give comfort and truth to the people who need it but before the Antichrist and person takes over this complete wolf system of churches the true ban will be taken away with from this world to be with the Lord God will catch away his bride for this great marriage supper of the Lamb oh praise the name of the Lord hallelujah thank you Jesus Oh glory to God give him some praises people from the tyrant ehh revision 223 codes and I will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he would sit at the reins and hats and I will give unto every one of you according to your works God looks on the heart that has never changed remember what three weeks ago I preached on the right kind of a son and I was talking about Gordon talk about mysteries and teachings and revelations if that be so Peter who carried on right what is Peters condition but guess what he had faith in Him virtue and him knowledge in him he had life in him he had the word in him all the mysteries was in him the hidden ones through all of that was locked up inside of him what was looking at what was asked at his behavior because your behavior is what put you on your path to adoption now how much enter your head but how much come out of your heart isn't that right so let's go go look on the heart you never change neither will it ever change here as though all the ages are two groups proclaiming the revelation from God and their relationship to God nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them which are here's the Lord Sutch at the reins the would search means to track follow up God track down our torts which is all reins he knows what is in our hearts he sees our works which are definite manifestation of what lie within us that is not fake news that is expression was on the inside what does that your works so things have to come for us to produce something that we can see what's inside of us isn't that right it is out of the hat that precedes righteousness or wickedness our motives our purposes are all known unto him as he watches every action and every action every word shall be brought in the judgment then the accountant of our lives given there was no fear of God before the false rain and dearly shall they pee let him who named his name live as become its sins we might fool the people but we will never fool the Lord could I continue the promise in these dark days and he quote the scripture erosion 2:24 but I see unto thee but under UIC and unto the rest of tyre as many as have not this doctrine which have not learned the depth of Satan as they speak I will put on you not on a burden but that wish you already hold fast till I come now before we go into the promise this is brother Branham let me show you again show again the church has spoken by the spirit in this book as two vines whose into wine and branches composing but I say unto you and under the resin tight area as many as have not destruction there it is he is speaking to two groups this is the backdrop of coming down to the but ourselves so no we enrich apart associate we on our way there we talking about the church right now Oh hallelujah he is speaking to two groups one has the doctrine and another has not there they are scattered abroad across the nations with each other doctrine opposing the other this is doctrine one is of God knowing his depths and the other of Satan knowing the depths of Satan that's incredible isn't it Tombo church now a little more unbelievers at of a church now depth of God depth of Satan I will put you I will put upon you none other burden the word for burden is wheat or pressure the pressure of the Dark Ages was either bend or be broken bow or die it was the Inquisition the power of the Empire back upsie tonic worship be organized or pay for your life with your life each age had expression for example a great burden of the last age asana a great burden of the last age is the pressure of riches soft living and nervous tensions dizzy probabilities right here this is it right here I found that this is it right here it will go nowhere else this is it right here for example our Great Britain's of the landscape is the pressure of riches which is you want to buy buy buy spend spend spend improve improve you can't wait to get money to spend and is oppression what about how much to buy where to buy be kind to buy who buying just like you who you want to buy like the pressure soft living I mean the pillow fluffy not much as we had a long time you takin be tougher fight my mattress afterwards the other ticket and beat that bun could stuff that back and lie down on that is no burden for church nobody in the comment time no wonder worship you can team afford to miss the song service because it's some service give you an opportunity to give worship to God if you come and sit down for just word how do you get in the spirit that's what the song service that's why we're bringing a minstrel the Prophet was angry he was upset he's a billion Minister make some music here now cheesy atmosphere created was hell I could move into the spirit and then you could get Topsy the Lord we're not singing because of the song we sing in because it brings worship and honor and adoration on the Claude because in heaven our seraphim's day and night Valen holy holy Lord God Almighty holy holy holy holy holy Lord God Almighty heaven filled with congenic billions bring in adoration and praise unto God he changed had these pressures for example a great burden of this issue the personal riches soft living and move was tensions in a complex in a complex age that we seemed unfitted to live in nervous tension I was that nervous tension because you read a very holy vows it's a different kind of nervous tension oh my watch this word it seems of a clear-cut Britain it was the defy room stand up for the word even unto death that is why the Christians and those it was very pure you have no compromise when the knock on your door Rome or debt Vega do in between you know well I was thinking about it they taking the Cartier off you ought to think about it before those Christians give their lives the real ones the genuine ones they meant undeceive God hallelujah praise God they have not known the depths of seaton it seems that this verse has been left out by the commentators for they were not able to figure out what doctrine or what experiences are meant by this phrase actually it is simple to know what is meant said parabrahma he recognized 90 commended command leaders talk about this depth acetal they do know where that is listen to the Prophet let us first know what the depth of God is and the opposite will be true for the depth of Satan in Ephesians 3:16 here we go that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ may dwell in your hearts by feet that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that you may be filled with the fullness of God that is the depth of God hallelujah could we get a lot of shout do you understand the depth of God now that prayer I want I want to read again that Christ will dwell in your hearts by faith and that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that he might be filled with all the fullness of God now according to these verses when a man experiences the depth of God in his life it is an actual personal experience of the Spirit of God dwelling in him his mind is illuminated by the wisdom and knowledge of God through the word but the depth of Satan will be in that he will attempt to destroy us he will always attempt to make a substitute of this reality also it's two things we point into now the depth of God is a pleasant experience with the spirit implement in your life that's a reality that is God on you there is no man in between that's fire upon your bein that is fire upon your life there was nobody in between join that now watch how will he do it to bring this depth decision he will take away the knowledge of the truth of God and destroy the world by putting forth his own he had God said he will then substitute here is bomb he will then substitute the police now Christ in our spirits this is the problem from from from the personal Christ in your spirit to man the under pulpit or some bishop or some message Pope or some message dictator he will do it as he caused Israel to do the same by a human being reading as king instead of God the born-again experience will be rejected in favor of church joining so the people have in their mind when they in church they are safe when they are Church they applied when they're in church everything is fine because it's in a particular church but Jesus already exposed that and so when they said come here forget that when it's a low here forget that boot come here come here he said behold the kingdom of God is within you [Applause] could we give our Sultan that one he never pointed kingdom to a place to a church to a man to a person he said the kingdom is within you Jeff for the kingdom has to be the work of the Spirit the born-again experience will reject it in favor of Church joinin the depth of season has been entered into that age and the fruit of that depth of seat on which a lies murder the horrible crimes came forth from it oh my thank you Jesus Oh glory to God but a Branham we continue for partners vanish suppose you need healing what does the word say he said what did you get in the spirit when reading it did we ask God for His Spirit to teach us the real root of it if we did we could call the elders confess our sins be anointed and prayed for it might not conveniently immediately but in his spirit in his spirit it is all over there is I love this there is no other Court of Appeal God will fulfill his word we need to get in the spirit and then things will be done so the devil job is to fight you with the spirit fight you from a Dundee anointing fight you make a trip and fall in sin or what not they handle confidence you're condemned though you're all messed up you can get in the spirit that's the devil job Oh hallelujah what a mana don't go to the axe verse get in the spirit and then go to the axe and watch what God will do I think that word reason again don't go to the axe first get in the spirit then go to the axe and get what would gobble do hallelujah have you ever noticed how the world gets into the spirit of things they go to their ballgames their sporting events their dances they get in the spirit of it they don't sit there like a Wallflower all dried up stick they get right into the feel of things and become part of it Oh hallelujah is only when you recognize and you become part of this word and be recognized you are priests unto God and recognize that you come to bring these sacrifices of your lips you'd also Amen you're not saying amen to what you like this is not chewing gum you chew what you want and you spit what you want one since the word being spoken you say Amen hallelujah if it cut in you you see Amen if it's tripping you up and you say Amen if it hurts in USA Amen that's nothing but the truth because it is the word some people say Amen when the news hit in somebody else you would hit in some system somebody because you know somebody some condition and then you

that one believes the kids of the world has sprung the people until it cannot produce spiritual growth and that's what's the matter whether what nation that's the matter with our churches they have no joy the joy of the Lord has departed written one in the scripture the read the word Hebrew would think about me the presence of God have departed I wonder president of gaudy pots he said to find fault for to this one that one of X for this one and she do me and and his whole flesh natural humanistic thing there was no joy of the Lord hallelujah so then because of that no we go into other places of pleasure instead of coming into the house of the Lord for pleasure it's gonna be a pleasure and delight and encouragement to know that nine o'clock it up to a preen in the church line the you're smoking up the place as incense good not before God miss Bertram incense gonna be for God and is that joy for you to connect with that and be part of that you want to know when is in X parameter in

where you get an empowered hallelujah this is where getting in the spirit this is my quad could speak to you Holland the house of the Lord is the joy of the Lord the joy of the Lord is the joy of his people he wants you to come to church and worship Him and be happy and satisfied given praise undone glory in wisdom and might and power he wants you to do that hallelujah all the pleasure out is substituting the devil is a vision Road eating's not to take the place of a real good spirit full experience so if you're never experienced come taste of the Lord you see he is good hallelujah glory

up a cigarette woman sick on immoral clothes and go out on the grass and when man is going there that the whistle at them they do everything to be popular oh praise the name of the Lord hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus oh praise God so that's church we finished with the church now come down to the potter's house would be a Bible as the German r18 we want to read the scripture again the word of the Lord which came to Jeremiah from the Lord seeing there my 18 verse on the word of the Lord which came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying arise go down to the potter's house and I will cause thee to hear my words then I went down to the poor house and behold he wrote awoke on the wheels and the swagger is before my work on the wheels and the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the Potter so he meet it again another vessel I seemed good to the Potter to make it and the word of the Lord came to me saying no house of Israel Canada I do with you as this Potter see at the Lord behold as the clay is in the Potters hand so I he in my hand o house of Israel so I want to just talk a bit about this Potter's House that God sent Jeremiah to see and it's so strange that God would send him there because God wanted to bring a picture a comparison analogy well that's right and I'm seeing something about the putter I'm seeing the clay I am seeing the wheel I am seeing the purpose I am seeing a mud vessel I am seeing the Potters choice whether to keep it or discard it this is what I'm seeing no before clay could be used you don't just dig up clay it has to go through a process that it can be usable let's call it sanctified cleansed purified pull it out to get it malleable that you could work it get it into a usable state isn't that right the vessel was mad the what the choice was to keep it or discard it he brought it back from a broken state and the vessel was remade so I had some notes at the clay after being pulverized mix with water brought into a usable state a lump is torched in the middle of this wheel and I wish I had a wheel to show it in reality it's a wheel and something's underfoot spinning this wheel spinning wrong like this and they take this lump of clay and hit it in the middle of the wheel and now this and okay a lump is tossed into the middle of the wheel the center of the wheel with fingers thumbs water and pressure that lump of clay is turned into a bowl if you go on the internet and YouTube you could see how it is done and it's kind of an eternity ball of a is a water pot I kind of hold whatever the Potter decides after completion the art work is done it is placed in the of mckellen heated to bring it to a usable state glazed then heated and brought it into steam for a Potter the reason the clay must be processed because when it is placed on the wheel and the wheel begins to spin a stone rock panel or stick could my it or break it so when the Potter start to put that longer and subtle knead it and put water in it and put his hands in it and skip spinning and expand it he Lords one beautiful thing though he knows where he is going when you were spinning the wheel it can be you know efficiently could sue you know he's Shona no no no no no once is that the spin his hands and tongues and pressure when you want to risen higher it squeezes in at the whole mud thing raise up higher the clay because you have a vision I want to make a pot so you know that guides his hands that's the putter the accurate weight spin and he can stop it now hallelujah praise God are you with me now what about him said this in witnesses before we can ever make any headway we have got to get broke up face you know like the putter the Prophet was going down to the potter's house to be broke up to be mean over again you know if there's no breaking up there is no making over again hallelujah when he confronted Moses this is prophet who make mountain song later he said no watch you have got to be broke up before you can be remade the Prophet went into the potter's house to get broke up to get on the wheel and spun out something different if you are sinner get on the wheel God will break you up more you different shape your life different shape your home different trees and even what the Jaycees the day isn't breaking up we need to go down to the potter's house our stiff home in theology some time doesn't work so good what we need is an old-fashioned breaking up repentance in our heart getting mellow to watch squad melot towards God picture dupatta god he's a putter and if they don't catch the energy we are the clay just in case you miss it you are not the putter we are the clean picture the putter God working with the end in mind of a finished product he's not working to kill time he is working with purpose of the type and the use of the vessel he has in mind he is not working blindly he sees in you what you don't see in yourself he sees what you could become and you have to begin to want to become how he sees you as opposed to how you see yourself [Applause] he is working on purpose not beauty I want to repeat that he is working on purpose not beauty so the things are wrong you may not be nice it not be smooth it might be easy it may be messy but it's not the beauty he's working around your life he's walking to your purpose because it's vessel that has crafted each ball each thing that is made by the Potter have a purpose behind it cardamon sort of things are wrong it may not be pretty or easy he's not Santa Claus working at the wheel with an end in mind a water pot a flower pot that's the butter hallelujah I like that he knows the end from the beginning when he picks up that lump of clay he know exactly what he's gonna make it and when I see how they work it they work at the completion they don't mix it after 1/2 Bowl when they start to spin it but a Stevenage spins completes everything is still and then they just wipe it all put the string and pull it off and you got a bowl to get a pot together fees it's complete he had it in his mind what he's gonna make how he's gonna make it the time to make it it's already finished the work he started in you hallelujah he's gonna come please it could be get our salt in their house [Applause] that's the butter that's a kind of clear a little bit the clay is the chosen of God it's God's choice since John 15:16 you have not chosen me but I've chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forward fruit and that your fruit should remain now whatsoever he shall act afire in my name he may give it you as ayah 29:16 surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potters clay for shall the work see of him that made it he made me not or shall the thing framed say of him the frame that he had no understanding Isaiah 45 9 warned him that strive with his maker let the pot Church try with the patches of the earth shall the clay say to him that fashioned it what make us down or thy work he had no hands I wanna really amplified isaiah 45 9 water him not strive with his maker a worthless piece of broken pottery among other pieces equally worthless and yet please human to strive it as a maker shall the clay is here to him who fashions that what do you think you are making the wheel clay butter let's talk a little bit about this wheel I call it the wheel of circumstance the wheel of struggle the wheel of people the wheel of sickness the wheel of the death of a loved one the Wheel of Life you don't choose the wheel and you don't even choose the spin you don't even choose the speed you don't choose how long would I be there because he is the putter and we are the clay first Peter once said that the trial watch who at watch blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again with a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and fit not away reserved in heaven for you so that's the promise it's reserved its inheritance is there who are kept by the power of God through faith and salvation ready to be revealed in the last time wherein you rejoice greatly don't know for a season if need be and heaviness to money full of temptations that the trial of your faith being more precious than gold a parachute don't be try red fire might be found under the praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ so you don't get to choose what God is going to use for that wheel you don't get to choose how fast the wheel is going to spin you don't get to choose your tests the potter's choice at the wheel according to the purpose he has for that vessel Ock 7 9 and the patriarchs move with envy sold Joseph into Egypt but God was with him aha you mean cord used juices old brother as a spinning wheel to put him into his purpose and his destiny [Music] what if Joseph got a bad attitude I just hate his brothers I hate him it you seen the Twitter also historia de functional because there was not anointed a blessing to come up and pan that he has to adjust that's why when they came for food he said God send me ahead to preserve life so doors if wasn't his thing you see what you're doing you Celia do me and I get it but that nonsense he wasn't that foolishness he said God sent me ahead to preserve life before he called he saw the higher purpose that he was on that wheel that was being spun to make him a vessel to be placed next to Pharaoh hallelujah the pasta was working at Joseph's not the brothers I'm not hearing you hallelujah says the putter working and you not your wife not your husband you the teacher and you not your mother the father you but the sister where are you working on you let him work on you [Applause] the God use Joseph's own brothers as the spinning wheel to bring Joseph into his purpose and destiny you don't choose a temperature of the fullness of the kiln or you don't choose how long you're going to be there ah my figure this morning the vessel that he made of clay was mad in the hand of the butter so he made it again another vessel he get his bombard his clothes as seemed good to the Potter to make the pot I didn't have to consult anybody when people write you off when they take a bounce back when they think your finish finish yeah say who reporter didn't say that the butter kept you when you were broken the putter held you when you were bruised the putter held you well nobody understood what you were going through when you are wrapped on the inside you almost give up you're almost given he could have discarded you but he still held you hope you've got praise if you don't find [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God praise God praise God Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hold dear any man question the PATA remaking a vessel until a new purpose until new destiny thanks turn it out and things went wrong things tiling out and didn't work out as you expected but the Potter didn't give up on you the Potter didn't describe you the possibility go the Potter gonna take you and remake you Oh glory no God come down to the potter's house [Applause] for Jesus hallelujah hallelujah or give the Lord a shock God love to remake broken vessels come on now come on now don't let no man on earth write you out Paula he is the putter [Applause] precision the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the Hanna dupatta so he made it again another vessel so he had to bring it back down to original state back to this lump because once is not hit it once it doesn't go in the oven it could be brought back to the smile malleable state once it doesn't heat it and bake it you could remake it move it it has something restraining a corner : : pictures on cracks pieces broken pieces but God decide not to throw your side Godley that's why you have no excuse in prison Scholten worship it God chose you [Applause] Amen Isaac hallelujah when witness are you finish when they say a copy we'll need it again God changed to poop us by making it let me read it again let me read it again let me read it let me read it hallelujah so he made it again I'm not a vessel I'm not a vessel he is cheaper to run fresh purpose the same material the same man same shoes same mines here man but channel differently well press differently glory to God the purpose of God a corridor election will span [Applause] Oh hallelujah dead duck all dinner God is not finished with us yet he is still working on me [Applause] hello give the Lord a shout [Applause] my my god you may be seated the thing about it you can't make the vessel without the wheel and the wheel does not just have a name called wheel the wheel is the spin the making is in the spinning if it does spin you can make it if a nice not spinning nothing is making its only when it's spinning it could shape you it only run your life upside down inside o things going this way that way you can understand it but this cord putting pressure really spinning and he is fixing his hand pressing his thumb putting pressure here and it raised it up making you colonel higher or give the Lord a show you have got to be on that wheel come down to the potter's house [Applause] the amplified of the same scripture you may be seated Jeremiah Dean forces and the vessel that he was making from clay was spoiled in the hand of the Potter so he made it over reworking it into another vessel as it seemed good to the porter to make it so who did challenge to Potter to say the Potter carry with you into another vessel unto a fresh purpose onto a fresh rules the other challenge of water that God can transform your life today today right now [Applause] my god my god hallelujah hallelujah God will remake you and the vessel that pleases him are you willing to submit to the Potter but abandoned from time-tested memorials long years ago before the heart smelters they used to take gold and how they would know it was right or not praise God he said they had smelters they take gold how you know the right or not with all this sludge he said they will beat it and beat it and turn it and beat it until it until the beater sees reflection in the gold and that's the way God does his church he gives you trial after trial test after test trial after trial test after test until the life of Christ is reflected in your life until you become peaceful sober make gentle humble ready submissive these are words you don't hear in this message you get arrogant proud you know it because LM not in care talk to them because our books

was blessed this morning just the what what put up on my heart glory to God so the clay doesn't get to tell God how to spin it the clear doesn't get to tell god what to make it when the children wasn't even born he said Jacob LOV so I hate that the purpose of God according to election chants and not him that will it that's why it's almost simple to write off people do that alright again what somebody did the only thing that cannot be forgiven is blaspheming the Holy Ghost that is actually written to the devil the works of the Spirit every other thing can be forgiven [Music] as long as having blaspheme the Holy Ghost there's blood there is mercy the Potter could take you up on the wheel repurpose you fix your right my it's so good to go down to the potter's house tell all everybody

on your wheel and if you get broken he could rework your he could remake you he could make you over again let me just in a minute let me just read this here from Larry's interchange he said now he said his own as me as I love I rebuke and chasten the cheese needs to reprove to reprove is to expose with a view to correction Jason does not mean the punish I think I need to say that soaking a little bit as many as I love I rebuke and chasten cheese doesn't mean to punish it means to discipline because the subjects amendment is mine it means he's disciplining you to bring you into conformity to his will and to his word that is what that Jason is all about isn't that right from the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if you endure chastening God dealeth with you as with sons if you end your the cheese now if I run out but you know you're on your own some people just run all these tests around akattak no more so there is a void doc hide and about yourself and the devil isolate you and then to kill because Hebrew decide you could take him out when the bird wounded and weak and he stayed with the flow of the rest of birds and they make away and in front of him under gravity breeze you gotta ease and flying with the rest of birds you have people that encourage you and support you but once it definitely gets you decided that's what he does the first thing you fall you feel is something happening wrong and keep yourself no prayer you're not coming to the church and I come to the ministry you all about yourself that was his day right there now you can do it you can handle it and all you're trying to do so get you by yourself - Neal you when you finish what you get like a zombie dead man walking no chase then for the present seemeth to be joyous but Grievous nevertheless it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which exercised thereby I'm almost done hearing is set for the love of God love of God he desired in love a family of his own a family of sons like himself I'm finishing here before him lies all one mankind as one lump of clay out of that similar he know will make vessels unto honor and unto this manner the chosen will be his own choosing then those chosen ones born of his spirit will be trained to be conformed to his image in their walk he reproves with all long-suffering and gentleness and mercy he chastens with nail scarred hands sometimes this Potter must take the vessel he is working on and thoroughly break it down in order to rebuild it exactly as it is acid but it is his love that is his love another way of his love there is not there cannot be or fear not flock this is just losing fast as does those tears will be bombed together as a three-fold cord is not easily broken they will have a tremendous tree fall strength of political physical spiritual satanical power they will seek to destroy the Bride of Christ she will suffer but she will endure fear not those things that are coming upon the earth for Hugh loved his own love unto the end and I close with these scriptures and a quotation at the end in the script I read king when brother Stephen spooks book
