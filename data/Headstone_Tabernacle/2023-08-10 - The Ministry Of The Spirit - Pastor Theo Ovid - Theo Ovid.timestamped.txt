[23:22] John 6. you want to read verse 63s in
[23:25] John 16. 12-13 and Zechariah Chapter 4
[23:29] 1-7.
[23:31] reading
[23:32] Saint John 6 6 3 Jesus speaks
[23:36] it is the spirit of quickness
[23:38] the flesh profited nothing
[23:41] the words that I speak unto you they are
[23:44] Spirit
[23:45] and their life
[23:47] and the next scripture is from Saint
[23:48] John 16 verse 12. Jesus speaks I have
[23:52] yet many things to say unto you but you
[23:55] cannot bear them no
[23:56] how be it when he the spirit of Truth is
[24:00] coming
[24:02] will guide you into all Truth for he
[24:04] shall not speak of himself but
[24:07] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[24:09] speak and he will show you things to
[24:11] come
[24:12] on our last scripture from Zechariah
[24:14] Chapter 4 and the angel that talk with
[24:16] me came again and with me there's a man
[24:19] that is weak note of his sleep
[24:20] I said unto me what says Thou I said
[24:23] I've looked and behold a kind of sick
[24:24] all of gold and a bowl upon the top of
[24:27] it in his seven lamps they're on and
[24:29] seven pipes to the seven lamps which are
[24:31] upon the top thereof and Tall of trees
[24:33] by it one upon the right side of the
[24:35] bowl on the other on the left side
[24:37] thereof so I answered and speak to the
[24:39] angel the talk with me saying what are
[24:42] these my Lord then the angel that talk
[24:45] with me answered and said unto me noise
[24:47] down not what these be I said no my Lord
[24:51] Denny answered and speaking to me saying
[24:53] this is the word of the Lord into zeruba
[24:57] saying not by might nor by power but by
[25:00] my spirit saith the Lord of hosts who
[25:03] are the whole great Mountain before
[25:04] zeruba Bell those shall become a plane
[25:07] and he shall bring forth The Headstone
[25:09] thereof with shoutings crying Grace
[25:11] grease unto it me God bless his word you
[25:14] may be seated
[25:15] praise God we are grateful to be here
[25:17] tonight
[25:18] and I hope it's not boring for you to
[25:22] hear it over and over it's a privilege
[25:24] to be here
[25:25] tonight it's a privilege to be in House
[25:28] of God Amen I he made a privilege
[25:31] hallelujah praise God we don't have that
[25:33] right we don't know one day we we maybe
[25:36] call Over Yonder we don't know so when
[25:38] we get the opportunity to come to the
[25:40] house of God we are blessed
[25:42] amen
[25:43] so tonight I have a title
[25:46] the ministry of the spirit
[25:49] and I have an inspiration the new
[25:52] ministry
[25:53] this year
[25:55] is about 58 years
[25:58] since the prophet left
[26:01] 58 years being under the ministry of the
[26:04] wood
[26:06] the word revealing
[26:07] the word unfolding
[26:09] the word showing the word unveiling
[26:12] given us word promises
[26:17] and this on the breach
[26:19] he says he that promised these things in
[26:22] this last day
[26:23] he that said these things he that is now
[26:26] in the time of the revelation of these
[26:31] things being made known
[26:33] come and die
[26:34] so he actually identified these 50 plus
[26:38] years as the time
[26:41] of the revelation of these things being
[26:43] made known
[26:44] so God allow a slot
[26:47] and this slot will be a calling out time
[26:50] of the Bride for all these years from 65
[26:54] to now some just come and went through
[26:57] and whatever but the bride is being
[26:59] called
[27:00] year by year day by day is that right
[27:03] nobody Brown
[27:04] from this Amanda turn the light he said
[27:07] the dirty rags of yesterday
[27:09] you say okay I'll skip that
[27:11] justification save its time
[27:18] till it become the baptism of the Holy
[27:21] Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[27:23] served its time until the Holy Spirit
[27:29] which is only one God Blends into the
[27:31] church
[27:32] so there's a prophecy for the Holy
[27:34] Spirit itself
[27:35] to blend into the church because
[27:38] justification made a way for
[27:39] sanification sanctification made a way
[27:42] for the Battle of The Ghost and the
[27:43] Bible goes made a way for the Holy Ghost
[27:45] to come down itself
[27:46] imperfection and back to the word so God
[27:49] was always progressing and making moves
[27:51] isn't that right that we could come to
[27:53] that Perfection but he used this word a
[27:56] very interesting word Blends into the
[27:58] church and the church into Christ and it
[28:01] makes Jesus Christ reflected on the
[28:03] earth through this blending oh praise
[28:06] the name of the Lord isn't that right
[28:07] and and all the colors fade red blend
[28:11] into orange orange blend into yellow and
[28:13] yellow Blended in a green and green
[28:15] bended into into blue and so on it's a
[28:18] blending and we have to blend into
[28:20] Christ isn't that right he says I am
[28:24] only responsible for the word praise God
[28:27] isn't that right and Jesus said it is
[28:29] the spirit equipment the flesh profited
[28:32] nothing the words that I speak unto you
[28:34] their spirit and their life so words are
[28:37] not just words words are also Spirit the
[28:40] word that came out that Jesus mode is
[28:42] not just words it is spirit and life
[28:44] isn't that right we know this one we're
[28:46] going to read here but Obama's quote in
[28:48] the scripture that we read Because Aruba
[28:50] Bell thou shall become a plane these are
[28:52] messages of Grace and he said we are all
[28:54] acquainted with the scripture the river
[28:56] was a great Prince among the people laid
[28:58] a foundation as we read on further we
[29:00] find that God said the rumorable had
[29:03] laid a foundation with his hands he
[29:04] shall also bring forth The Headstone I
[29:07] want you to notice he never said he
[29:09] shall pay for the Cornerstone he shall
[29:11] bring forth The Headstone and we know
[29:13] that the scripture says that Jesus is
[29:15] the Chief Cornerstone and he is also the
[29:18] headstone now if he will think for a few
[29:20] minutes that the seventh Church
[29:21] messenger was to restore the faith of
[29:24] the children back to the fathers that
[29:26] was the prophecy that was the word that
[29:29] was the commission to restore the faith
[29:31] and then he interpreted that in other
[29:33] words rebuild the church again under the
[29:37] power of the spirit so there's a
[29:39] prophecy hanging over us tonight of the
[29:42] church being rebuilt by the power of the
[29:44] spirit and the church is going to be
[29:46] repelled by the power of the spirit when
[29:48] the ministry of the spirit stepped
[29:50] forward and there's a prophecy that
[29:52] there's going to be the ministry of the
[29:54] spirit which is the ministry to follow
[29:57] the ministry of the word and that
[29:59] Ministry of the spirit will be the new
[30:01] Ministry o praise the name of the Lord
[30:03] not by power not by might but by my
[30:07] spirit saith the Lord not by
[30:09] organization not by denomination not by
[30:12] manner the hour
[30:13] but by all them revelators but by my
[30:16] spirit he said by the Holy Spirit God
[30:18] will bring for the church in the last
[30:21] day not by pressing play but by the
[30:24] spirit he's going to bring forth the
[30:26] church in the last day not by some
[30:28] Mighty Man from somewhere unless Mighty
[30:30] other man from somewhere no but by his
[30:32] Spirit oh praise God Amen and from Jesus
[30:36] keep all his appointments Tampa
[30:39] 18th of April 1964. he says that's the
[30:42] way God has brought his church from
[30:44] justification sanification baptism of
[30:47] the Holy Spirit and now
[30:50] the ministry of the spirit
[30:52] which is what quickens the word and the
[30:55] ministry in the church will have to be
[30:57] exactly like his
[30:59] so the prophecy is that that Ministry
[31:01] had to be won with Christ isn't that
[31:04] right at that day you shall be enough
[31:07] you know I'm in the father you may not

[34:25] that's that's all I am
[34:27] but God's gift
[34:30] is the spirit of God
[34:32] that came down
[34:35] in the form of an Angel
[34:37] he didn't have wings
[34:39] he looked like a man I heard him when he
[34:42] walked as he walked on the floor walk
[34:44] right over just as normal as any man
[34:46] talks like any man he comes time after
[34:48] time through the room and different
[34:51] places when I'm fasting and praying
[34:55] you know what he said yeah God's gift
[34:57] is the spirit of God
[35:00] that come down in the form of an Angel
[35:03] so the prophet preacher's message and he
[35:06] said you know what I'm waiting on
[35:08] Hallelujah I'm waiting on him and in the
[35:11] spirit of God come down in the form of
[35:13] an Angel then you hear into he is here
[35:16] Oh Glory to God what happened the spirit
[35:18] comes to confirm the word
[35:20] come in the form of the Angel and as I
[35:23] was with Malachi 4
[35:25] so I will be with Ephesians 4 the spirit
[35:28] again coming back in the form of an
[35:31] Angel Hallelujah that angel was a Peter
[35:36] that angel went to the early church and
[35:39] that angel gonna be with the bride oh
[35:41] give the Lord I shout in the house
[35:43] do you believe that
[35:45] amen are you ready
[35:47] let's go leave the messenger the end
[35:49] time messenger his job will be to get
[35:53] the scenes ready
[35:54] for the bridegroom
[35:56] that will be his message
[35:58] you want to learn ABC so you can study
[36:00] algebra later and ABC is already Christ
[36:03] isn't that right now here we go
[36:06] bring back the church to the word what
[36:09] is this messenger of Malachi for to do
[36:12] restore back the original fate
[36:16] and you know it's so great to have us
[36:19] Prophet that could flesh out the thing
[36:21] we need to know
[36:22] then he identify what this original fate
[36:25] is he called it the resurrection feet
[36:29] Hallelujah turn your eyes back to the
[36:31] faith of the fathers but not just any
[36:33] faith Resurrection feet now these
[36:36] disciples had Faith with Jesus
[36:39] but Resurrection faith is after Jesus
[36:41] raised from the dead
[36:43] he appeared to them to anoint the faith
[36:46] that they had
[36:47] so their faith was a resurrection feat
[36:50] oh let's put it this way an anointed
[36:52] Faith to receive the promise of dynamics
[36:55] of power of the Holy Ghost of the reign
[37:00] of the quickening that they were
[37:02] supposed to get in the upper room their
[37:04] faith had to be anointed so it cannot be
[37:06] just the same Faith they had before
[37:08] Jesus died it's a resurrection fade it's
[37:11] not right and he explain what that faith
[37:13] is
[37:14] Resurrection faith that they seen Jesus
[37:17] after he was raised from the dead seen
[37:20] him working among them
[37:22] so ricardia's point to William Branham
[37:24] and all what Christ did through him and
[37:27] by him we have to see him
[37:29] Among Us
[37:31] working Among Us and seeing him among us
[37:34] give us Resurrection faith we see Jesus
[37:38] we see his Spirit Hallelujah we see the
[37:41] operation of his Spirit by the ministry
[37:43] of the spirit you're going to see Jesus
[37:45] do you believe that there were men of
[37:48] few words they went forth and preached
[37:49] the word they preached long Paul
[37:52] preached all night one time a man fell
[37:54] out of the building killed himself he
[37:55] laid his body over him brought him back
[37:57] to life again and he kept on preaching
[38:00] oh my oh praise God let's go
[38:03] Jesus they used to be unfailing
[38:05] realities of the Living God
[38:07] the brought God to human lives
[38:10] God was made human
[38:12] when Jesus was born
[38:13] God became man
[38:15] that he might have fellowship at man
[38:18] Whitman and in man to achieve one
[38:21] purpose
[38:22] that is to bring to man what God is not
[38:25] what a church is but what God is Jesus
[38:29] came that he might present God to man
[38:32] and Mandan wanted
[38:34] the Holy Spirit comes today in like
[38:36] manner to present God to man but man
[38:39] wants to go to church
[38:42] that's what man want to do
[38:44] it drums out his thinking he cannot Farm
[38:47] it and we must learn that God is not
[38:51] known by intellectual conception
[38:54] God is known by the new birth
[38:56] by the Holy Ghost not by any other way
[39:01] Jesus the Bible said plainly quoted no
[39:05] man can call Jesus the Christ only by
[39:07] the Holy Ghost and if you never receive
[39:09] the Holy Ghost you don't know what he is
[39:11] in Christ for that's the only way he
[39:13] reveals himself you are not converted
[39:15] until you received the Holy Ghost the
[39:17] Bible said so and after Peter have been
[39:19] saved and Sanctified give power the
[39:22] castle unclean spirits and to preach the
[39:23] gospel Jesus plainly told him he was not
[39:27] converted
[39:28] until he received the Holy Ghost he said
[39:31] after you are converted then strengthen
[39:34] your brethren
[39:35] that was in the night of the Betrayal
[39:37] and he was not yet converted and no man
[39:40] is truly converted until he has been
[39:42] changed
[39:44] and died himself and the Holy Spirit has
[39:48] control of that person
[39:50] and they do not want to do it so it's
[39:52] not so much Holy Ghost they have how
[39:53] much Holy Ghost have you he said until
[39:55] the Holy Ghost have control of that
[39:57] person and they don't want to do it
[39:59] to be continue
[40:01] now the holy spirit will not misbehave
[40:03] itself in one person
[40:05] and behave yourself in another
[40:07] it will make each person come into its
[40:10] character
[40:11] because it's the spirit that leads you
[40:14] it brings and makes you subject to its
[40:17] nature you don't bring it subject to
[40:19] your nature it makes you subject to its
[40:22] nature
[40:23] and the Holy Spirit makes you live and
[40:25] love to do it
[40:27] how you love to give up the things of
[40:29] the world
[40:29] when the Holy Spirit comes in
[40:32] how it cleanses you and washes you and
[40:34] put a desire in you to follow him and a
[40:37] taste and The Hunger for More of it just
[40:39] pain yourself he brings realities
[40:42] oh give the Lord some praises
[40:45] so when God placed man here in the days
[40:47] of the Lord Jesus he gives man a true
[40:50] road map to his power
[40:52] road map
[40:54] to his power
[40:55] a road map is something that tells you
[40:58] where you're headed
[41:00] he said we live a few days I've crossed
[41:01] this country so much my wife and I were
[41:03] amazing for the last few days you could
[41:05] mention where you want to go I could
[41:06] tell you any rule that leads it within
[41:08] 15 minutes of the time you'll arrive
[41:10] from here to California I haven't missed
[41:12] it that time sometimes right in the dot
[41:15] calculating my time of what the driving
[41:17] time is and the average time I've been
[41:18] back and forth up and down back and
[41:20] forth till you just know it
[41:22] and that's the way God wants us to know
[41:24] his word
[41:26] we know it we travel it we have tested
[41:30] it we have tried it and you know it
[41:33] leads to now his roadmap is his Bible
[41:37] so we know when you have the Bible you
[41:38] have the road map
[41:39] the Bible is the roadmap that leads to
[41:42] the power of God could we say Amen
[41:45] see it leads you to the power
[41:48] and power produces the promise
[41:51] we need power I'm still reading Oh Glory
[41:54] to God Bible is a roadmap but I can't
[41:56] believe it's not right that leads to the
[41:59] power of God and faith is what leads us
[42:01] into the power and the power bring the
[42:03] produce the promise
[42:05] we need power isn't that right what does
[42:08] the route map point to is that right
[42:09] Jesus said you Hypocrites you can tell
[42:11] it's in Disguise but you cannot resume
[42:13] the time and so on if you have known my
[42:16] day did not the Bible said anything
[42:18] would happen did not Jeremiah Ezekiel or
[42:21] the Minor Prophets speak of it
[42:22] everything that wrote my point in right
[42:24] to one destination and when he come he
[42:27] had created their churches and things
[42:28] until they failed to see the reality of
[42:30] what he come for to bring God in man and
[42:34] to make God in man to unite them
[42:36] together again oh blessed be the name of
[42:40] the Lord are you with me tonight
[42:42] who praise God Hallelujah the church
[42:45] cannot run without the power of God
[42:50] the church cannot run without the power
[42:51] of God through the word and the Holy
[42:54] Ghost will only confirm the word of God
[42:56] for that what it's to do and here we go
[42:58] the anointing is to confirm the word
[43:02] Oh Glory to God do you hear tonight
[43:05] the anointing come down the anointing
[43:06] come not to confirm the word the
[43:08] anointing come down to confirm the word
[43:10] I'm reading the anointing is to confirm
[43:13] the word Oh Glory to God hallelujah
[43:17] praise God praise God hallelujah
[43:22] when you see God bring down the anointed
[43:25] you know he's confirming his word my
[43:27] spirit is right in the word hallelujah
[43:29] hallelujah once word come the anointing
[43:32] comes behind because it's his own word
[43:34] is that the word of a man it's the word
[43:37] of God oh the prophet comes Spirit
[43:39] spoken word isn't that right all right
[43:42] now there's some testimony 1963 20 to
[43:45] November brother Brown
[43:48] you see you must never leave that word
[43:51] you must stay exactly with that word the
[43:54] way it is written don't put no private
[43:56] into petition to it just just the way
[43:59] it's written that is God's word God and
[44:02] His word is the same
[44:03] and as I said last night there is a
[44:06] portion of word lit for every age
[44:09] are you ready
[44:10] and there's some anointed comes down
[44:13] that projects that portion of word for
[44:17] that age and you see where we are at
[44:20] today
[44:21] Oh Glory to God so the anointing has to
[44:24] come down to push out that word or
[44:26] protect the word that you could see it
[44:29] let's go
[44:30] huh
[44:32] praise God
[44:34] watch what kind of massage is just
[44:36] looking for today
[44:38] the church cried the loudest Halloween
[44:40] about a messiah Revival no time back to
[44:43] this and back to that what are they
[44:44] looking for what more do you want what
[44:46] does the church want we already got it
[44:49] God give it to us it's his promise for
[44:52] this hour we look in the Bible here we
[44:55] go we see it everywhere Through the
[44:57] Bible
[44:58] anointed ones come on and make that word
[45:01] live again
[45:03] right in the hour for that hour
[45:06] we have got the Messiah
[45:08] this is him the word in the beginning
[45:10] was the word the word was with God and
[45:12] the Word was God and the word remains
[45:14] God is Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[45:16] and forever we know what is supposed to
[45:18] take place on this day we are wanting a
[45:20] messiah and God give us the Messiah his
[45:24] promised word for his day
[45:26] it is just written this is the part I
[45:29] want to get to for somebody with faith
[45:31] to anoint it and make it live again
[45:35] in every age the words every age and
[45:37] promise was a messiah and this is
[45:40] probably kindness is a messiah
[45:45] because that is promise for this age
[45:47] bride will display her virtue for the
[45:50] age it's just recall to display all it's
[45:53] not Paul only at Faith you know that was
[45:55] their display for that day we have our
[45:57] display because broadly kindness have to
[46:00] be dear for the spirit to come on top of
[46:02] that or give the Lord that's where God
[46:04] put the holy spirit in that slot that's
[46:07] a mystery you know Peter only say faith
[46:09] virtue knowledge Temperance I'm not
[46:11] charity you know the Prophet come and
[46:12] put the Holy Ghost slot and say the
[46:14] bride is being called aloud this year
[46:15] and visit where
[46:17] fitted in the Holy Spirit slot
[46:20] after the seven age we are called out of
[46:22] faith in that Holy Spirit so the
[46:25] bright supposed to connect to the
[46:26] ministry of the spirit in the Holy
[46:28] Spirit
[46:30] Oh Glory to God
[46:32] so wait a minute based upon this you
[46:35] mean anybody somebody could anoint any
[46:37] promises make it live that's what he's
[46:40] saying here oh glory to God let's read
[46:42] it again we are wanting a messiah God
[46:45] give us the Messiah his promised word
[46:47] for this day is just waiting for
[46:50] somebody with what
[46:51] shout out faith
[46:53] Faith anoint it and make it live again
[46:56] it's a real Messiah oh give the Lord
[46:58] some Praises hallelujah hallelujah so it
[47:02] takes Faith to anoint it and you have to
[47:05] anoint it to yourself
[47:06] that that word believe in you okay the
[47:09] Lord some Praises are you getting me
[47:11] tonight you're not anointing for the
[47:13] general Church you know you're anointed
[47:15] to you that that word will live in you
[47:18] and that the word will become flesh in
[47:20] you and that the invisible will become
[47:22] visible by the ministry of the spirit
[47:25] making manifest what's in you
[47:29] okay the Lord some praises
[47:31] glory to God glory to God
[47:34] before God manifests every anything at
[47:36] all he speaks his word
[47:38] let there be let there be let there be
[47:40] that's how God operates
[47:41] he always speaks his word because the
[47:44] word is a seed and once the seed get
[47:46] watered it bring forth after his kind he
[47:49] do have to question and wonder about it
[47:51] you know because the seed of the
[47:52] potential the seed of the ability so
[47:54] when God took the prophet off the scene
[47:56] he knew there will be a bride because
[47:59] the prophet saw received for the bride
[48:00] will give the Lord a shout that's why he
[48:03] could say the seed will fall in the
[48:05] hands of the predestinated the books
[48:07] will fall in the hands of the
[48:09] predestinated amen
[48:10] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God from
[48:15] hearing recognizing acting on the word
[48:16] of God but Abraham have you ever seen
[48:19] this you seen our churches today even in
[48:22] groups where we have separate ourselves
[48:24] and make organization we have seen all
[48:25] cities you see a man
[48:28] pick up a city in Scripture
[48:30] and brother
[48:31] that man can take that scripture and
[48:34] make it live live you make it live just
[48:38] exactly what is Promised here in the
[48:40] Bible and the next one will see him do
[48:42] it and he will come around and try to do
[48:45] it and fail
[48:46] hope you're reading me now why the
[48:49] scripture is not inspired to him he's
[48:51] only trying to impersonate he's trying
[48:53] to act like something well maybe he's
[48:55] sent by a man the Bible predict as
[48:57] Johnson Moses so the prophet said men
[49:00] will come forward and make this word
[49:01] manifest the same scripture the same
[49:04] quotes the same books and tips they
[49:06] listened on reading through and I come
[49:07] alive and they don't understand how it
[49:09] come alive oh glory to God the anointing
[49:12] coming to anoint the faith coming to
[49:14] anoint the very promise Oh Glory to God
[49:16] and make it live that's why I know
[49:17] you're gonna have a Revival because we
[49:19] have people here with faith to anoint a
[49:21] Revival a Revival back again he said
[49:23] what we see should make a church that
[49:25] will make a Revival we have to anoint
[49:26] that Oh Glory the God hallelujah
[49:29] hallelujah the Revival doesn't come by
[49:31] the preacher it come by the people in
[49:33] their homes in their hearts in their
[49:34] lives we have to anoint that you have to
[49:36] say the Revival have to come by me I'm
[49:38] responsible for my personal Revival I am
[49:41] responsible for bringing Revival at the
[49:43] church I'm responsible or give the Lord
[49:45] some Praises hallelujah hallelujah
[49:47] hallelujah worried up God
[49:50] glory to God
[49:52] now watch here we go seed of this cup
[49:54] and see we live through looter age
[49:55] Wesley age all along to the ages the
[49:58] Pentacles of age and each age has given
[50:00] a promise of the word each age
[50:03] he said and the people of that age
[50:06] that have spoken books
[50:09] that civilian Church long longer you
[50:10] message long time if they say that here
[50:12] you know and the people of that age that
[50:16] manifest that promised word is the seed
[50:19] of that age have nothing to do with what
[50:22] group what Tabernacle what Fellowship
[50:24] they're going in who they pass is and
[50:26] how much Revelation you have and how
[50:27] much he connected internationally and
[50:29] how much people view him and it seems so
[50:30] powerful and what that has nothing to do
[50:32] with it the people of that manifest that

[1:00:29] powder when David met gulad like a
[1:00:31] slingshot with a rock he's only got a
[1:00:33] place to hit and that's the right
[1:00:34] between the eyes the rest of it was

[1:00:57] stone David had the sling but it take
[1:00:59] the spirit Power

[1:02:11] all with the baptism Holy Ghost with
[1:02:14] nowhere to meet the enemy on any guns he
[1:02:15] comes on this is not with the word of
[1:02:18] God each one backing one another up

[1:02:48] what is he saying he is saying he could
[1:02:51] be in front but not in
[1:02:53] he could be in back not in
[1:02:55] he came out his side not in but he's not
[1:02:58] talking about that this faithful
[1:03:00] ministry will have him in
[1:03:02] we'll give the Lord some Praises not up
[1:03:04] in front or up here above or back behind
[1:03:07] but in them
[1:03:08] that's the Army vindicating what the his
[1:03:12] resurrection by the proof of his words
[1:03:14] and then he quotes in John 14 12. he
[1:03:16] that believeth in me the work that I do
[1:03:18] shall do also what is it it is God in
[1:03:21] the church in these five predestinated
[1:03:23] offices backing up every word he said
[1:03:26] with the Holy Spirit himself in there
[1:03:29] which is the word made manifest proven
[1:03:32] his resurrection proving that he lives
[1:03:35] oh praise God praise God praise God
[1:03:38] hallelujah
[1:03:40] [Applause]
[1:03:46] let's go deeper
[1:03:48] but my name is
[1:03:51] Jesus is the word of God and he was
[1:03:53] busted open that life
[1:03:56] the life is inside the seed that is this
[1:04:00] life which is Spirit here we go life
[1:04:03] which is Spirit
[1:04:05] water flowing over you have to take it
[1:04:08] as you're bringing it the spirit over
[1:04:10] the seed of God will bring forth the
[1:04:13] life of the seed and if it brings forth
[1:04:15] something else there's some kind of seed
[1:04:17] other sea there
[1:04:18] if
[1:04:19] the spirit of God comes forth to water
[1:04:23] the seed if it is seed it's watering it
[1:04:26] will produce the life of the seed is
[1:04:28] that clear
[1:04:28] it will produce the life of the seed now
[1:04:31] Jesus is the word made manifest I like
[1:04:34] that not just the word
[1:04:37] but the word may manifest
[1:04:38] he and the word is one and the same that
[1:04:41] is why it was so made manifesting him so
[1:04:44] perfectly that's the reason God
[1:04:46] manifests himself so perfectly in Jesus
[1:04:48] because he was the seed word
[1:04:51] The Germ word itself
[1:04:55] every word waited here you know
[1:04:58] The Germ that's inside the seed that is
[1:05:02] the life in the seed
[1:05:04] and he was The Germ word of God the germ
[1:05:08] is the spirit
[1:05:10] The Germ is the water
[1:05:13] so you will understand when you talk
[1:05:15] about the faithful Ministry you'll have
[1:05:16] the gym in the body
[1:05:17] Peter had the gym
[1:05:19] so that's why Conyers had to send for
[1:05:21] him
[1:05:22] because the season changed Cornelius
[1:05:24] couldn't go in the upper room
[1:05:26] because the gym was now on the earth in
[1:05:28] flesh
[1:05:29] so God had to anoint Cornelius and for
[1:05:32] Peter
[1:05:33] because Peter had the gym
[1:05:35] and The Germ comes from the body
[1:05:37] to reproduce another son
[1:05:39] name
[1:05:42] by the spirit
[1:05:44] even the music of the spirit
[1:05:46] Peter himself didn't know that night
[1:05:49] that day that very hour everything was
[1:05:51] going to change
[1:05:53] he just walked and understood you have
[1:05:56] to give testimony and why he given
[1:05:58] testimony the Bible said while Peter
[1:06:01] speak these words
[1:06:02] the Holy Ghost
[1:06:04] fell upon them
[1:06:06] because it was from his mouth
[1:06:08] Germans Corner the Peter's mouth
[1:06:11] and he said that is the power in the
[1:06:13] last days the sons of God with the
[1:06:15] purifier veil with full germ Oh Glory to
[1:06:19] God that are faithful outside the body a
[1:06:21] faithful in the body oh give the Lord a
[1:06:23] shout in the house so Jesus was The Germ
[1:06:26] word of God
[1:06:28] the gym is the spirit
[1:06:30] the Germans the water
[1:06:32] and Jesus had to be broken open in order
[1:06:35] for that sea to let forth its life
[1:06:38] to water other sea that was coming
[1:06:41] do you see it
[1:06:42] I am sending forth spirit
[1:06:46] to water it and it will produce exactly
[1:06:49] it will produce Miracles it will produce
[1:06:52] the power of God and it will not deny
[1:06:55] anything because it's a kindred seed
[1:06:58] The Works that Jesus did if a man
[1:07:00] prophecy this is the word you know if a
[1:07:03] man has the seed of God in him
[1:07:06] one
[1:07:08] with the spirit of God watering that
[1:07:11] seed
[1:07:12] the same works that Jesus if the Same
[1:07:15] Spirit was within him is in you the same
[1:07:18] Works will be manifested
[1:07:22] that's how more word than one word if
[1:07:24] that seed is there and the watering
[1:07:26] Spirit that's what we're talking about
[1:07:27] tonight the ministry of the spirit is
[1:07:30] the watering Spirit that's supposed to
[1:07:32] anoint the faithful Ministry our glory
[1:07:34] to God to Quicken the word to the bride
[1:07:36] we'll give the Lord some Praises
[1:07:38] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
[1:07:41] Hallelujah in other words God promised
[1:07:43] the watering spirit
[1:07:45] oh hallelujah hallelujah the ministry of
[1:07:48] the spirit
[1:07:50] then the works will be manifested in him
[1:07:52] are the same for it is the same seed
[1:07:54] wood God's son was his example seed and
[1:07:58] what his life was when the spirit poured
[1:08:00] upon him after his baptism and the Holy
[1:08:03] Ghost come upon him the very life he
[1:08:05] produced well
[1:08:07] that same
[1:08:09] watering Spirit of the Holy Ghost will
[1:08:13] bring forth that same kind of a life
[1:08:15] doing the same thing he did if it is the
[1:08:18] same seed son of God's seed will bring

[1:10:33] care what they preaching what they're
[1:10:34] teaching is either a son of life or a
[1:10:36] son of death or give the Lord some

[1:11:16] done
[1:11:17] you're going good tonight
[1:11:19] what was he
[1:11:21] himself a man God has made flesh and all
[1:11:23] Among Us the world was made fresh into
[1:11:25] all Among Us God spoken word through a
[1:11:27] virgin birth what a body
[1:11:29] and in that body come water and the
[1:11:31] spirit Washed by the Water of the word
[1:11:33] and then went into him dwelling him and
[1:11:35] there come a life of God manifesting
[1:11:37] himself through Christ God was in Christ
[1:11:40] the anointed one Christ is Anointed one
[1:11:42] a man that was anointed and God dwelling
[1:11:44] in him what is it the germ with the
[1:11:47] flesh
[1:11:49] so this is see June with flesh on it
[1:11:51] he said the June of the flesh the
[1:11:53] anointed one flesh
[1:11:56] being anointed
[1:11:57] with the spirit God produce the word of
[1:12:01] God made manifest and we beheld him the
[1:12:04] only begotten the father full of grace
[1:12:06] then
[1:12:07] there where he was almost done he was
[1:12:10] God word made manifest
[1:12:12] and now he died in order to pay the debt
[1:12:16] of your hybriden what is it that you
[1:12:19] could die to yourself and this is what
[1:12:22] I'm saying sometimes you know watch what
[1:12:23] ministers preacher what would pass this
[1:12:25] preacher now what to see when they bring
[1:12:26] that dead battery message
[1:12:28] and when I don't see the Dead part I
[1:12:31] will problem with that
[1:12:32] because we have to die
[1:12:36] sometime I go to the ministers they
[1:12:37] don't blast the tree in that Spirit
[1:12:38] something something
[1:12:41] is not the Holy Spirit
[1:12:43] General Hospital to get rid of just like
[1:12:45] the French spirit and American Spirit is
[1:12:47] one Holy Spirit
[1:12:49] the Holy Spirit not the national spirit
[1:12:52] and you have to get rid of your children
[1:12:54] that Spirit in order to contact the Holy
[1:12:56] Spirit
[1:12:58] you have to die to that culture politics
[1:13:00] all the things is the human element
[1:13:02] that's a bus pass that when the spirit
[1:13:04] is one spirit is one Lord It's one
[1:13:07] baptism if this Spirit fallen in Africa
[1:13:10] in India in South America is one Spirit
[1:13:12] America Canada wherever it's for is one
[1:13:15] spirit
[1:13:20] um
[1:13:21] watch this
[1:13:25] what is it that you could die to
[1:13:28] yourself until no more yourself and be
[1:13:31] filled with his word to live in his word
[1:13:34] and then then the Holy Spirit was in him
[1:13:38] comes down to water that wood to make it
[1:13:40] grow
[1:13:41] then what is it God manifesting
[1:13:45] continuing the work of his full son his
[1:13:47] only begotten to see that died for a
[1:13:49] high breeding that he might reconcile us
[1:13:51] back to be Sons and Daughters of God
[1:13:53] that what Christ might flow the same
[1:13:56] life that through the church might flow
[1:13:59] the same life by the word continuing the
[1:14:01] work being manifested as was in Christ
[1:14:03] Christ was God's women manifest he died
[1:14:06] give his life that he might send the
[1:14:08] spirit take his body up and send the
[1:14:11] spirit back to water to pay the
[1:14:14] redeeming price if we will believe it
[1:14:16] that's right isn't that right praise God
[1:14:19] the Bible has got to be in you
[1:14:22] the wood is a seed as long as it is lean
[1:14:26] here it won't do nothing but when it
[1:14:29] comes in here you know if it's coming
[1:14:30] stay in here it don't do nothing but
[1:14:32] when you come in here in the heart then
[1:14:34] it begins to manifest by the Holy Spirit
[1:14:36] The Works of God
[1:14:38] then Vision comes power comes humility
[1:14:42] comes although it all is gone you become
[1:14:45] nothing Christ becomes a life you die he
[1:14:48] lives there it is because he died I live
[1:14:51] when I die he lives again and when I die
[1:14:54] he promised me life I died out to myself
[1:14:57] so in order I can have his life how do I
[1:15:00] do it by taking his word his seed put
[1:15:02] the seed in here by faith believe it it
[1:15:04] produces exactly what it says all right
[1:15:08] stretch now
[1:15:10] you can't you see the Bible is exactly
[1:15:12] the word of God you see me yesterday to
[1:15:15] them forever
[1:15:16] we become Tabernacles of that Holy
[1:15:18] Spirit which is Christ that's the real
[1:15:21] seed then if that real Holy Spirit
[1:15:25] gets into the real seed of the word
[1:15:28] won't take part of it because the devil
[1:15:30] uses that
[1:15:31] you've got to take all of it
[1:15:33] oh my I could see why that bride will be
[1:15:36] so small
[1:15:37] because people not believe in every word
[1:15:40] they're not receiving every word and and
[1:15:42] God went with a burden with sending
[1:15:45] seven angels of Eternity to gather all
[1:15:47] these scattered wood to tithe back into
[1:15:49] the word to bring down the Holy Ghost
[1:15:51] because the Holy Ghost and the word is
[1:15:52] the same that's why God hate Creeds and
[1:15:55] hate the nominations
[1:15:56] Antichrist Spirits because and subtract
[1:15:59] from the word of God so God need an
[1:16:02] actual conduit of the entire world so
[1:16:04] that's why all the Loose Ends Mysteries
[1:16:06] were sorted out by that Prophet Elijah
[1:16:08] all the books all the Mysteries inside
[1:16:10] the book was finished and then they
[1:16:12] could get the thunders in the back of
[1:16:13] the book so in other words one the word
[1:16:15] was finished completely on the inside of
[1:16:16] the book you know every Spirit on the
[1:16:18] backside
[1:16:19] oh Gloria got a manifest what was inside
[1:16:21] the book oh give the Lord some Praises
[1:16:23] it wasn't saying written without you
[1:16:25] know it just says sealed on the backside
[1:16:26] with Seven Seals Oh Glory to God and
[1:16:29] seal is the finished work oh Blessed Be
[1:16:31] of the Lord is not right so you can't
[1:16:33] take part of it because the devil uses
[1:16:35] that so the devil uses part of the
[1:16:37] message
[1:16:38] Hallelujah but the bride take all of it
[1:16:41] isn't that right hallelujah praise God
[1:16:43] praise God
[1:16:45] Hallelujah
[1:16:47] from wisdom versus Faith to Zechariah 4
[1:16:50] 6 is where I'm going to close that right
[1:16:52] here the Bible said not by might nor by
[1:16:54] not by power nor by might but by my
[1:16:57] spirit said the Lord not by wisdom
[1:16:59] not by knowledge not by denomination but
[1:17:03] with my spirit I will what energize my
[1:17:05] word
[1:17:11] the disciples had it shown into them
[1:17:14] this is the detail of it
[1:17:16] I don't think I ever read this one
[1:17:18] before
[1:17:18] the disciples had it sown into them
[1:17:21] then the Spirit come to energize the
[1:17:24] word
[1:17:25] not by power not by might not by wisdom
[1:17:28] not my understanding
[1:17:33] I understand the mystery you know I
[1:17:34] understand you're waiting I won't
[1:17:35] understand it not that
[1:17:37] that's in Mississippi
[1:17:38] people with natural virtues and whatnot
[1:17:40] hearing Mysteries sit down Church there
[1:17:42] is
[1:17:43] saying that they're going back and
[1:17:45] they're coming home I believe prophet
[1:17:46] and God you're sending a prophet and
[1:17:47] whatnot but that's not what we talk
[1:17:48] about here now this is fire
[1:17:51] this is power
[1:17:53] this is the Energizer Oh Glory to God
[1:17:56] what the disciples had it shown unto
[1:17:58] them then the Spirit come to energize
[1:18:00] the word not by power not by might not
[1:18:02] by wisdom not by understanding not by
[1:18:03] this not by that but by my spirit I will
[1:18:06] energize my word by my spirit said the
[1:18:09] Lord it is the water of the word of
[1:18:12] faith that energizes the word of God
[1:18:15] that makes it work
[1:18:17] what did he say about Rebecca Rebecca
[1:18:20] was asked what are they coming right and
[1:18:23] he said he coming as a beast and he said
[1:18:25] the same camel that Rebecca watered took
[1:18:28] her to Isaac and he says how do we water
[1:18:31] the word
[1:18:32] by praises and worship that is why the
[1:18:35] churches are they so dead that is why
[1:18:37] they don't want no praises the devil
[1:18:39] know better
[1:18:40] that's why the devil buying them with no
[1:18:41] praise demons that they wouldn't water
[1:18:43] the word so they have the word but no
[1:18:45] water on it but when they begin to
[1:18:47] praise God and thank God and bless God
[1:18:49] like in the upper room they were
[1:18:50] praising and pressing God continue that
[1:18:52] is in the Bible they were worshiping
[1:18:54] praising blessing God continually
[1:18:56] whether you have you lost a job lost
[1:18:58] your car lost your pay Lord say health
[1:19:00] it doesn't matter you're still praising
[1:19:02] God continually what you're doing you
[1:19:04] are saying God I believe you and I trust
[1:19:05] you and I reject my circumstance I
[1:19:08] reject my situation I'm not looking with
[1:19:11] senses
[1:19:12] like it on Sunday evening super sense at
[1:19:15] work
[1:19:16] it begins with faith we'll give the Lord
[1:19:18] some praises Oh Glory to God and the
[1:19:21] same praises and worshiping the same
[1:19:23] power Hallelujah will take it to Isaac
[1:19:25] Oh Glory look you worshiping him now
[1:19:27] they will worship in a revelation in the
[1:19:29] upper room they had no fire yet they had
[1:19:32] no power yet they had no deal Pentecost
[1:19:34] fully come yet but they were praising
[1:19:36] God continually before that they saw
[1:19:38] Jesus taken up and they said bad guy
[1:19:40] without crying they say bye-bye without
[1:19:42] frustration they say Baba without
[1:19:44] depression okay the Lord some Praises
[1:19:46] because they had a revelation they had a
[1:19:48] rocking your soul they knew what was
[1:19:50] promised he said behold I send the
[1:19:52] promise of my father upon you they knew
[1:19:54] the Holy Ghost was promised they knew
[1:19:56] what Joel said because Peter said this
[1:19:58] is that that the prophet Joel speak of
[1:20:00] Jesus opened the word to them he opened
[1:20:03] the understanding to them they knew
[1:20:04] exactly what they had to receive
[1:20:10] and after 58 years
[1:20:13] you can't tell me you don't know what
[1:20:14] you had to receive if after 58 years you
[1:20:16] don't know what they receive something
[1:20:17] is wrong
[1:20:18] hallelujah praise God oh my by my
[1:20:21] experience said the Lord is the water of
[1:20:23] the word of faith that energizes the
[1:20:25] word of God missions come on please
[1:20:27] on the final pitch
[1:20:29] all right
[1:20:32] of the Lord 1951 he said shall we ball
[1:20:35] heads in just a moment he saw Heavenly
[1:20:37] Father
[1:20:38] we are so conflict tonight for the
[1:20:40] opportunity to be alive
[1:20:41] I'll be here on Earth
[1:20:43] at the closing of this world history
[1:20:46] and see these great things develop him
[1:20:49] the words of God
[1:20:52] being materialized
[1:20:55] and brought to us
[1:20:57] by the ministry of thy spirit
[1:20:59] how we love dividers
[1:21:02] let me read that part again
[1:21:04] he said we see these greetings
[1:21:05] developing the words of God being
[1:21:07] materialized
[1:21:09] and brought to us
[1:21:10] by the ministry of thy spirit
[1:21:13] oh hallelujah praise God
[1:21:16] I want to read about the code already
[1:21:17] from the very beginning where I get this
[1:21:18] Mission from that's the way God has
[1:21:20] brought his church from justification
[1:21:22] signification baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:21:25] and no no no
[1:21:27] 273 no the ministry of the spirit which
[1:21:31] is what quickens the word
[1:21:33] dark Ministry in the church will have to
[1:21:35] be exactly like his o praise God
[1:21:38] Hallelujah I'm finishing
[1:21:41] he's talking about um the pyramid right
[1:21:43] he said it uh let's skip right now now
[1:21:46] they rejected the Chief Cornerstone the
[1:21:48] Bible was rejected but now we're getting
[1:21:51] closer and closer the spirit of God has
[1:21:54] coming from justification
[1:21:55] sanification Holy Ghost
[1:21:58] that church will have to be so close
[1:22:02] and the spirit of God so perfect working
[1:22:06] in that church that when The Headstone
[1:22:09] comes it will cap it together and the
[1:22:12] resurrection will come on a way to go to
[1:22:14] church
[1:22:15] no that's just here say see
[1:22:17] is it perfect I am trying to show you a
[1:22:20] point
[1:22:21] that the church has got to come to a
[1:22:25] place
[1:22:25] to have the spirit of Christ in it
[1:22:29] the spirit of Christ operating in our
[1:22:32] bodies

[1:22:36] specific and you're generally this
[1:22:38] person spite moving no no no no no yeah
[1:22:40] the spirit he said I'm trying to show
[1:22:43] you a point that the church has got to
[1:22:47] come to a place to have the spirit of
[1:22:50] Christ in it the spirit of Christ
