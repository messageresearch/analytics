[43:15] you a Christian the Holy Ghost is what
[43:17] makes you a Christian knowing all the

[47:22] is the perfection an inspiration cry out
[47:25] to God
[47:26] that's what I have an inspiration crying
[47:28] out to God from perfect feet so we in
[47:31] the word now let's go from perfect feet
[47:34] but a Branham was speaking and he was
[47:37] saying this is coming into that tooth
[47:40] pose I remember he was given the
[47:42] minister of Jesus Christ in triples and
[47:44] he's speaking on a poofy thing this is
[47:46] coming to the temple and believing it
[47:49] now I won't they actually are since a
[47:50] question you did pass through the prayer
[47:52] line can you actually believe and feel
[47:54] now that there is something happen in
[47:57] you since you had hands laid on you
[48:00] regions there it is this is what I've
[48:04] been waitin for
[48:05] no this is not no no this is just
[48:08] starting to bloom no just that I did
[48:12] this for a purpose I did this for a
[48:15] purpose I am working on something see I
[48:18] am taking this charge of feet and I'm
[48:21] going right back to begin and come in
[48:23] see the kind of raised faith and a
[48:26] bracket where you'll never notice it
[48:28] that way before not not a feet but a
[48:32] perfect feet build it up in here and
[48:36] watch a perfect God with a perfect heart
[48:39] keep a perfect promise by His perfect
[48:42] world what we are coming now to the
[48:46] perfection because the people has to
[48:49] come to this in order for the rapture
[48:53] come on now CNN so we don't want to talk
[48:57] rapture that generating everybody
[48:59] wrapped it erupted after no no no no no
[49:01] before you get there you have to come to
[49:03] hear the people after coming to dis now
[49:06] what we talking about perfection and
[49:08] perfection never a beginning never an
[49:11] end them so you're talking about
[49:13] something that's outside a train we've
[49:15] got much something for eternity that
[49:17] could come and influence your life you
[49:20] can't make this up you can implicit this
[49:23] you can't pretend this Oh glory to God
[49:27] hallelujah glory
[49:28] if brother Branham was pretending to the
[49:31] bull the bull was gonna kill him he
[49:34] couldn't pretend you have to talk the
[49:36] language yet to talk the language the
[49:39] bull understands he understood the
[49:41] language of love or that language of
[49:44] love nothing could conquer it
[49:45] it's the greatest force there is because
[49:49] charity never faileth see you're not
[49:52] gonna fail this Love's gonna fail but
[49:55] this power we talking about the tenon
[49:56] sail and the devil don't want you to see
[49:59] that that you have a right to access
[50:01] that but Peter give the ladder hope the
[50:04] claim to that this is a PSA flew to
[50:07] knowledge temperance patience godliness
[50:11] brotherly kindness come on don't stop
[50:13] there because you have to go higher look
[50:16] at the Lord a shout Oh glory to God you
[50:21] are sons and daughters have access to
[50:24] that which is perfect my quarter no feel
[50:27] like preaching or glory to God
[50:30] hallelujah prophecies gonna fail
[50:33] tongues gonna cease but when that which
[50:35] is perfect is come hallelujah Cepeda
[50:42] Miriam says we are commented that to the
[50:44] perfection now because the people has to
[50:47] come to this in order for the rapture
[50:49] that is what is holding it right now
[50:52] it's waiting for the church to comment
[50:56] to that perfect rapture faith looking
[50:59] for it it means a lot of Shaving don't
[51:01] for me
[51:05] now remember but her mom was alive right
[51:07] he himself looking for the rapture it
[51:13] means a lot of shipping no for me it
[51:15] means a lot for you but together we will
[51:18] make it by the grace of God or give the
[51:22] Lord some praises or glory to God you do
[51:30] with a broom you know you just
[51:33] leave with a bleed so in that context
[51:39] let me read this again it means I never
[51:41] even known for me let me receive enough
[51:43] for you you ever say a carpenter shaving
[51:46] wood trying to get the right angle Shh
[51:59] so when you see the blade coming about
[52:02] oh god you're not yet turn not yet next
[52:05] service I'll figure next week
[52:08] no you're ready yet you must want
[52:11] perfection you must want God to come and
[52:14] do the season let them start to team
[52:17] you don't want an organizational life
[52:20] you don't want a son the Christian life
[52:22] and money living like a devil you want a
[52:24] Christian life every day what about him
[52:34] says what he said no the reason
[52:36] Christians I think it's so real tonight
[52:38] that we should live the right kind of a
[52:40] life because you see many people won't
[52:41] take time to read the Bible but they
[52:43] will read you you are written epistles
[52:46] of God our real true born-again
[52:48] Christian is the word expressed again
[52:52] because you are written epistles of God
[52:55] rather of all men
[52:57] what type of person should we be if we
[53:00] know that our lies is an open living
[53:02] Bible to the unbeliever to express God
[53:06] in our own life so tonight we would
[53:10] hunger and thirst to see the Lord Jesus
[53:11] Christ
[53:12] we as Christians should reflect his life
[53:14] so much till it should be his entire
[53:18] representative we should be that every
[53:21] Christian should be a representative and
[53:25] reflect the life of Jesus Christ so you
[53:28] don't represent this church you don't
[53:32] represent me you represent a kingdom
[53:35] where your father is the king you
[53:38] represent a life of power influence Oh
[53:41] glory to God that's what I told him a
[53:44] new year I represent the kingdom of the
[53:46] Most High God God told me to say that I
[53:49] wasn't representing Trinidad I
[53:52] representing a kingdom
[53:53] so I don't care what people think I'm
[53:55] bringing word from the kingdom as long
[53:59] as the kingdom is behind me doesn't
[54:01] matter what man say because I'll batter
[54:04] from the kingdom the kingdom of a king
[54:07] the kingdom of an army the kingdom of a
[54:10] power the kingdom of protection or we
[54:14] get the Lord a show
[54:16] [Applause]
[54:23] doesn't represent a Minister Association
[54:25] group of men represent this group or the
[54:27] state no not represent the kingdom if
[54:33] what you are inside of you that people
[54:37] read not so much what you see but what
[54:40] you not what you say that's right
[54:44] not all this yappity yappity app because
[54:46] there are three Bibles zodiac Perman
[54:49] this written Bible now this pyramid
[54:52] Bible is what you see if reflecting
[54:54] colors fade virginal but this have to
[54:57] come into you so all the mysteries in
[54:59] the physical Bible is in that Bible so
[55:07] once that Bible is in you you have we
[55:17] only have a son because we need this on
[55:19] earth because we learn read write
[55:21] architect ABC but you think you need
[55:24] this book in heaven we need scriptures
[55:27] on him and you become the very
[55:28] skepticism yet the words of the book you
[55:31] are something on earth you need to read
[55:34] the voice of one crying in the
[55:35] wilderness but haven't seen John
[55:38] [Music]
[55:40] John is the manifested wood of the voice
[55:44] of one Tanner wilderness so when God
[55:47] looked down John talk go are talking
[55:48] about jumbo when I translated in terms
[55:51] of this tiny lamenting voice of one kind
[55:54] of aloneness scripture Oh hallelujah God
[56:01] see you but we're not translated
[56:03] he said he shall turn the hearts of the
[56:05] children back to the faith of the
[56:06] fathers who is he talking about whose
[56:09] heart is he talking about who are the
[56:12] tyrannies talking about you are you are
[56:19] actually in the scriptures but you have
[56:22] to come and awaken to that consciousness
[56:24] that you have a word that can still
[56:28] there look at all the Bible you are part
[56:31] of that Bible you are part of the world
[56:34] itself you are actually in the Bible you
[56:37] are the words of the book your name is
[56:39] in the book the preaching come to call
[56:42] your name
[56:43] [Applause]
[56:50] let me sees it so not what you see you
[56:54] can pin something on someone and say
[56:55] this is that and so forth but your life
[56:57] being different from what they seen your
[57:00] testimony of your life is louder than
[57:03] the testimony someone could see about
[57:05] you so people see about his reputation
[57:08] you know he saw he saw his reputation I
[57:10] know who you are
[57:11] we could think what do you wanna think
[57:13] about your reputation that's why you
[57:14] don't have a but about repetition I have
[57:16] a defend my reputation
[57:18] forget that Jesus even considers
[57:19] repetition of a repetition you want the
[57:22] life of Christ
[57:22] I don't be pristine a good name wouldn't
[57:27] have you cinnabar
[57:29] born in same we like all are we
[57:34] born in sin but you won't different no
[57:37] all have sinned and come short of the
[57:40] glory all all of us need the blood and
[57:43] the grace all of us need a messianic
[57:49] there's no need to be arrogant and proud
[57:51] and indifferent no there need to be
[57:54] subjection to this power as we get
[57:56] nearer we have to get more submissive to
[57:59] the will of God because we want to be
[58:00] guided by God all glory to God amen so
[58:05] keep that in mind we are brilliant we
[58:07] are bringing influences every day and
[58:09] the life that you live proves what's on
[58:11] the inside of you you cannot change it
[58:13] it reflects every person reflects
[58:17] outside what is inside and what we say
[58:22] in the reflection is the perfection if
[58:25] we read Christ is perfect isn't that
[58:28] right
[58:28] so he said you should be a walking by
[58:30] little you should be the walking wood of
[58:32] God you're with me mrs. read of all men
[58:35] or I translate that turn around this way
[58:37] you ibises
[58:39] that have been written read all a man
[58:42] manifested Word of God
[58:44] so Peter and John they were ignorant
[58:46] unlearn had no education but Hannah take
[58:48] notice that being with Jesus they were
[58:51] ignorant and unlearned but they were
[58:53] written epistles read that have been
[58:56] with Jesus here we go Jesus was
[58:59] manifesting himself through them
[59:01] cries failed in their flesh manifested
[59:06] made alive like he wasn't Moses so these
[59:10] men couldn't read the book of Revelation
[59:11] if they give them the book to read but
[59:13] they was revelation themselves or glory
[59:18] to God so then reading writing doesn't
[59:20] count when Christ is filled inside of
[59:22] you because he's the function of all
[59:24] knowledge and wisdom
[59:25] he's the function of these know this man
[59:27] I couldn't read them to Rascals come and
[59:29] touch land he said they lied to me they
[59:31] lied to the Holy Ghost there's a man who
[59:34] can't even read he can't even count what
[59:36] they're coming up and money or whatever
[59:37] it is but he know that the holy was
[59:39] revealed to him that they are lying or
[59:42] as the Holy Ghost a the languor because
[59:44] the Holy Ones can't lie cause that a man
[59:47] that would lie or get the Lord a show
[59:49] and that same Holy Ghost is coming back
[59:52] with discernment with signs and wonders
[59:55] and miracles
[59:56] what's all the protected Church give the
[1:00:02] Lord a show corner coming to judge
[1:00:06] people he come in to protect the church
[1:00:08] if it means judging people and cutting
[1:00:11] them off but to protect his people he's
[1:00:13] got to do it give me a scripture 1st
[1:00:21] Thessalonians 4 the Lord Himself
[1:00:23] descends from heaven with the show to
[1:00:26] get this bridle gonna let no man mess
[1:00:29] with this bride no way no way did the
[1:00:33] Lord our show didn't mess with your
[1:00:36] salvation he save you
[1:00:39] he told you he predestinated you and
[1:00:43] he's gonna fill you he's gonna see you
[1:00:46] he's going to baptize you with the Holy
[1:00:48] Ghost and fire
[1:00:49] [Applause]
[1:00:57] maybe see that when you give your heart
[1:01:00] to the Lord who what man was inside idea
[1:01:02] what past about five minutes you who was
[1:01:05] married Saturday you come and give after
[1:01:06] Jesus and you say Lord I surrender my
[1:01:08] heart to you that was you and God
[1:01:10] somebody testify but something brick
[1:01:12] brick your heart that wasn't man do that
[1:01:15] man kept it no hat man do have the tools
[1:01:18] to break no heart Jesus in romantic um
[1:01:20] except my father draw or glory to God no
[1:01:24] man could come you can't come unless the
[1:01:27] Spirit of God come down to call you or
[1:01:31] get the Lord I scream that's why you
[1:01:33] should be praising God this morning to
[1:01:36] feel a little conviction to feel the
[1:01:37] presence of life coming up on your
[1:01:39] spirit
[1:01:41] [Applause]
[1:01:52] let me see those you may be you might be
[1:01:55] giants biscuit this morning but you
[1:01:57] could never be man the conviction of
[1:02:00] salvation that God called you the devil
[1:02:03] cannot make you deny that you only can
[1:02:06] tell when last you feel the power of God
[1:02:08] but you could always tell when God did
[1:02:12] something on your heart to say I want to
[1:02:14] repent of my sins you know that was not
[1:02:18] man you know that was God even upon your
[1:02:22] life give him praise for that this
[1:02:24] morning may be seated
[1:02:39] the church fields is on TEDx s main time
[1:02:42] I didn't call him on the books I'm
[1:02:44] quoting from I'm just coaching yourself
[1:02:47] priest become any cotton I can't preach
[1:02:50] accomplish I say what it tipsy the
[1:02:53] church feels that they don't need a Holy
[1:02:55] Spirit did you say well tell you that
[1:02:57] and men can stand up and give you such
[1:03:00] an intellectual talk can almost make you
[1:03:02] believe it not up stop in a minute
[1:03:05] then Jesus in a to spirit will be so
[1:03:06] close this is very like the intellectual
[1:03:10] talks would be so smooth it would
[1:03:14] deceive the people it is gospel it is
[1:03:19] men who can handle that word in such a
[1:03:21] way that would make any intellectual
[1:03:23] person if they are trust in the
[1:03:25] intellectuals they would condemn the
[1:03:27] Holy Spirit and take the way of man we
[1:03:31] see that he said the spirit of mine in
[1:03:36] Egypt you can see the persecution rise
[1:03:39] siege was have taken away in order that
[1:03:42] precision could rise a pharaoh have to
[1:03:45] raise upon you know Joseph one tool if I
[1:03:47] wrong favor grateful because you see if
[1:03:49] Egypt when Joseph's gone next Pharisee
[1:03:52] who is
[1:03:56] watch so droll they've taken away the
[1:03:59] order of position to rise then we see
[1:04:02] God which is real in the wheels
[1:04:03] everything more see part if I reject
[1:04:05] Joseph's lie told to live in prison be a
[1:04:08] good out excommunicated from his bedroom
[1:04:12] God put Joseph's and chill and he a big
[1:04:18] vision big revelation and God put him to
[1:04:22] chill in prison until he could get
[1:04:26] stripped of this self of this prison
[1:04:29] let's make a change a lot of things here
[1:04:32] you have a lot of limitations in
[1:04:35] precision you don't have the freedom and
[1:04:37] so you know you less think different
[1:04:39] when you come out of that you know and
[1:04:40] Joseph thinking you know what is this I
[1:04:43] supposed to be this and I supposed to be
[1:04:45] that and I am bride and I am Joseph and
[1:04:48] my father gave me special coat special
[1:04:51] coat man in prison but then when God
[1:04:55] ready God began to move
[1:04:58] oh it's not right watch something now
[1:05:02] and then God move there over sudden now
[1:05:05] how we can see the wheel and the wheels

[1:29:53] only come down on the atmosphere of the
[1:29:56] Holy Ghost that is why we worship that's
[1:30:02] why we sing that will be priests oh my
[1:30:05] god oh my hallelujah
[1:30:09] Oh glory let me see
[1:30:20] so let's look at something again in the
[1:30:23] word voice of one crown the wilderness
[1:30:26] in God's mine that Scripture is a man
[1:30:29] his name's up the Baptist in the word a
[1:30:33] virgin shall conceive but in God's
[1:30:35] thinking that's Mary so we see Scripture
[1:30:38] go see a person in the world have
[1:30:41] mysteries but Christ is the mystery of
[1:30:48] God revealed so when that mystery is
[1:30:53] converted it has to be converted into a
[1:30:55] life
[1:31:00] some people make fun of evangelists
[1:31:03] because - evangelists get me senator
[1:31:05] come to the Lord and what Larry teacher
[1:31:07] positionally please deliver into what
[1:31:11] position the in and you profit do this
[1:31:13] on impossible and so on so they have a
[1:31:15] kind of I think like evangelist for the
[1:31:17] mind the teacher is the place the
[1:31:22] person's positionally forward so all
[1:31:28] this teaching preaching instructing have
[1:31:31] an endgame behind them and that purpose
[1:31:34] is ready to receive Christ for you to be
[1:31:38] formatted with image not to say well you
[1:31:40] are well educated or well knowledgeable
[1:31:43] it's the form Christ in you because the
[1:31:47] master teacher was Jesus right he opened
[1:31:49] it understand to the scriptures and he
[1:31:51] opened the word to them guys and when he
[1:31:53] finished with her me send them onto a
[1:31:55] purpose
[1:31:55] they'll knew their position they knew
[1:31:58] what that was to do they were placed in
[1:32:00] the upper room they created atmosphere
[1:32:03] and they waited until they cried out
[1:32:06] until they asked until they stayed until
[1:32:10] what was promised was fulfilled when it
[1:32:14] was fulfilled the commander said this is
[1:32:16] that this scripture here this here is
[1:32:20] that doctor was talking about it's
[1:32:24] manifested it's fulfilled it's confirmed
[1:32:28] it's vindicated but the same thing has
[1:32:31] to happen we have to say this is that
[1:32:35] that the Prophet William branham's
[1:32:38] because it's vindicated it's fulfilled
[1:32:42] it's confirmed
[1:32:44] [Applause]
[1:32:47] Oh give a lot of shout oh my the life
[1:33:04] that was in the stock just official
[1:33:06] Miller with a sonification something
[1:33:08] hear me away for the bathroom Holy Ghost
[1:33:09] and the baptismal egos atmosphere spirit
[1:33:12] birds made away for the Holy Ghost
[1:33:15] itself to come down in perfection and
[1:33:19] back to the word so God was waiting for
[1:33:22] the atmosphere to come that he himself
[1:33:24] come down in that right oh praise the
[1:33:27] Lord so he was the Living Word
[1:33:31] he was the word he was the Living Word
[1:33:34] and the Living Word comes into us then
[1:33:37] it does have the same effect on us
[1:33:39] because it is the same word it's the
[1:33:42] same thing that's among us he come to
[1:33:44] brand listen he come to breed back Adam
[1:33:47] Trese this is good are you ready
[1:33:49] you want some juice I was like a little
[1:33:52] like like this course menu let's get
[1:33:55] some ham slices you know he come to
[1:33:58] breed back to Aaron's race a living fit
[1:34:01] in the Living Word of the Living God and
[1:34:04] he proved right by his action that the
[1:34:07] weakest st. on earth can beat the devil
[1:34:10] upon the written word of God we don't
[1:34:17] have enough events on that I hands empty
[1:34:20] 5% we talk money we can say it like all
[1:34:23] your eggs strong inside of here or glory
[1:34:25] to God he said a weaker Saint could beat
[1:34:28] that devil on the Ricky word
[1:34:34] come on we want some demon busters demon
[1:34:37] jesters come on come on come on
[1:34:43] [Applause]
[1:34:46] watch watch he was God himself
[1:34:49] manifested in flesh had powers without a
[1:34:52] limit and he never used them what did he
[1:34:55] do he defeated Satan on the same thing
[1:34:58] that's it and if he's even he pulled
[1:35:00] wool over him at that time when he
[1:35:02] whitewashed the water I've got to Eve
[1:35:03] she believed it isn't that right and
[1:35:06] watch he stayed with the wood and so on
[1:35:08] like that so the devil he is written as
[1:35:10] written written is not right so you have
[1:35:12] got to get the living wood in you to
[1:35:14] have the Living God in you because the
[1:35:16] word here is God
[1:35:17] aha here we go when it has made flesh in
[1:35:22] you let's go deeper the word here is God
[1:35:30] when it's made flesh in you made spirit
[1:35:34] and life in you when it goes into your
[1:35:37] flesh and your feet and becomes life
[1:35:42] then you become a living example
[1:35:50] it has to come in your feet on your
[1:35:52] flesh your first feet is what mental
[1:35:55] feet is just here then drop down here
[1:35:57] the flesh yet afterwards it becomes part
[1:36:00] of you you just in this thing you can't
[1:36:02] help it or glory the God is part of you
[1:36:05] or glory that God in my you ie pistol of
[1:36:09] God read of all men you won't have it

[1:36:16] you are God's living word
[1:36:19] representatively earth continue to work
[1:36:22] the church ought to be that way so he
[1:36:24] was God's Word made manifest
[1:36:26] oh how I like to get into that God will
[1:36:28] be manifest in other words made known

[1:36:34] or made known God's Word made known in

[2:02:28] spend two hours more
[2:02:29] I have 12 of the 41 pages so we don't
[2:02:36] get far today but I want you to get
[2:02:39] sittin things he said no we are coming
[2:02:41] to this great hidden mystery I've been
[2:02:43] since the foundation of the world
[2:02:44] no been revealed as these to the sons of
[2:02:46] God you believe that the true sons are
[2:02:47] to be manifested waiting for the
[2:02:49] manifestation sons of God what is
[2:02:52] manifestation making known now a lot of
[2:02:55] preachers spring this as making known
[2:02:58] mysteries and which is also good but I
[2:03:01] want to bring it a different way today
[2:03:02] making known is easy making known the
[2:03:06] trumpets divides the plays one in his
[2:03:08] son the Hebrew 144,000 are different
[2:03:12] mysteries and so on but listen to this
[2:03:15] part from indictment barabara he was the
[2:03:17] Living Word of God because he was
[2:03:22] expressing God through himself he was so
[2:03:26] completely surrendered to the Word of
[2:03:28] God till he and the wood was the same
[2:03:30] that is exactly what the church ought to
[2:03:33] be today that the Word of God is the
[2:03:35] same know today that did if I'm
[2:03:38] forthwith the man was the world the
[2:03:40] phone for Twitter man was the word know
[2:03:42] they find fault with the word work and
[2:03:45] to the man or glory to God so this
[2:03:48] making known is also making the word
[2:03:52] manifested this maker known is not just
[2:03:55] develop information or revelation or
[2:03:57] explanation is making known means Christ
[2:04:00] becoming
[2:04:01] manifested do you want to see that then
[2:04:05] cry for that
[2:04:07] I want to see Jesus I want to see christ
[2:04:09] manifested I come for my healing I come
[2:04:12] for my deliverance God hallelujah oh my
[2:04:19] my my what we need a revelation of the
[2:04:22] Spirit oh I'll just keep that I'll just
[2:04:23] come quickly
[2:04:24] now the gospel doesn't consist of wood
[2:04:26] only but to the power and that manifests
[2:04:29] in the Holy Spirit cause that's the only
[2:04:31] way it could be done for these signs to
[2:04:33] follow them that we believe so it would
[2:04:35] have to be the Holy Spirit that would
[2:04:36] give life to produce these signs the
[2:04:40] gospel is good news to every creature
[2:04:41] how long will it last on to the end of
[2:04:43] the world isn't that right
[2:04:45] no the Bible no what is the gospel what
[2:04:52] is the gospel the gospel is the good
[2:04:54] news
[2:04:54] all right but the Bible is the letter
[2:04:59] are you ready let's go the letter
[2:05:02] killeth but the spirit giveth life so
[2:05:05] Paul said the gospel come not you only
[2:05:08] but you the power and manifestation of
[2:05:11] the Holy Spirit now notice the only way
[2:05:14] that the gospel could be preached then
[2:05:17] would be to manifest the power of the
[2:05:20] Holy Spirit so we have to come up to the
[2:05:27] gospel the word is like the seed of the
[2:05:30] gospel it's a big statement let's get it
[2:05:35] these signs of honor I believe then
[2:05:38] strictly speaking a man kind of qualify
[2:05:39] himself as a believer until all this has
[2:05:41] happened so no church can rightly call
[2:05:43] himself I believe in church until these
[2:05:45] signs follow them that's what Jesus said
[2:05:47] it's making the word manifest so the
[2:05:52] manifestation of the Holy Spirit
[2:05:54] operation and the children had a seat at
[2:05:56] the chair of the kingdom the
[2:05:58] manifestation of the Holy Spirit operate
[2:06:00] and to his children is those seeds of
[2:06:02] the kingdom the word is of course that
[2:06:05] we know but he's bringing it back
[2:06:07] the word was invisible listen close the
[2:06:09] world was invisible on t little made
[2:06:11] flesh then the would become visible we
[2:06:14] all want to see Jesus that means the
[2:06:16] would have to become flesh
[2:06:17] then when they will become flush we can
[2:06:19] see it we can handle it we can touch it
[2:06:22] Oh glory to God hallelujah I have often
[2:06:26] want to come into a church I've longed
[2:06:28] to see it I guess when I could walk to
[2:06:30] the back door front door whatever it was
[2:06:31] look across the audience and see a
[2:06:33] perfect Church all in order sin couldn't
[2:06:35] steal the spirit we'll call it out oh
[2:06:38] praise the name of the Lord oh my oh my
[2:06:43] he's talking about a man who could crack
[2:06:44] glass of water mental conception and a
[2:06:48] human spirit perverted a damned spirit
[2:06:50] because you were fashioned in the image
[2:06:52] of God what would you do if you let God
[2:06:55] that fashions you come into you and
[2:06:56] control you you can bring every promise
[2:07:00] of God to pass a man under the control
[2:07:03] of God isn't that right God's gift is
[2:07:07] his word God gifts and you a gift you
[2:07:09] take the gift with his word there's a
[2:07:11] conductor with the gift of God if God
[2:07:14] give you the gift of the Holy Ghost you
[2:07:15] believe it the Word of God is a
[2:07:17] conductor to use the power with it oh my
[2:07:20] hallelujah so the word goes out and the
[2:07:23] Holy Spirit follows the word wherever
[2:07:24] the word is preached your pastor preach
[2:07:26] it under shop across the building goes
[2:07:28] the Holy Ghost that's right is the
[2:07:30] conductor of the word the word is a
[2:07:32] conductor of the spirit to be born of
[2:07:35] the Spirit is to believe and behave
[2:07:37] yourself in the spirit or glory to
[2:07:40] understand and believe at your heart
[2:07:42] that Jesus is Christ and this is his
[2:07:45] word and no other words can be added or
[2:07:47] taken from it without your name being
[2:07:49] taken on the book of life is it that's a
[2:07:51] strong one to be born is to be boosted
[2:07:53] from above Oh glory to God not your
[2:07:56] natural but anybody could by car house
[2:07:58] land have why five children and died but
[2:08:01] this is to be pretty from above all
[2:08:04] glory to God it could be a specialist to
[2:08:05] do this and special to do that you
[2:08:07] cannot be a CEO you could be a doctor a
[2:08:09] lawyer whatever it is it doesn't matter
[2:08:10] but to be busy from above must be born
[2:08:14] again a higher order because of what
[2:08:17] inside of you focus and fire upon what
[2:08:19] inside of you and take you at a higher
[2:08:21] level you can work in whatever place but
[2:08:24] you're on a higher level

[2:08:41] fate a little more again I'm gonna push
[2:08:47] Oh glory to God hallelujah my mind the
[2:08:53] Spirit is not active in any denomination
[2:08:55] because it's not interested in making
[2:08:58] organization the spirit itself is
[2:09:00] contrary to organization the
[2:09:02] organization looking for world things
[2:09:04] and mind the world the spirit is trying
[2:09:07] to find on his hats where the spirit is
[2:09:10] anxious to manifest and prove every word
[2:09:13] of God is true are you sleeping this
[2:09:17] area why are wait what the spirit
[2:09:22] looking for honest has got a split is
[2:09:24] anxious to manifest how can the spirit

[2:09:52] his life he alone know him is the person
