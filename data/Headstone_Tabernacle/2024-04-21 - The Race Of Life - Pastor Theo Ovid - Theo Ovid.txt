amen let's sing that song One More Time make me more like DM we're going to switch May me more Oh [Music] Glory give me a heart Hallelujah [Music] God bless you so this morning we have three portion of scripture i' like to read from Hebrews 12:1 and 2 1 Corinthians chapter 9 ver 24- 27 2 Timothy 4 7 to8 I like to read out all the scriptures because I like if I'm in a service and I have to write down the scriptures I could write them all down that's why I read out like that it's not that I expect you to find it the way I'm reading it but I'm reading it out in case you want to pin it down just a little testimony last Sunday we we announced that brother Solomon a was connected connected to us live from Ghana and um I called him next day and he gave me a powerful testimony there's a principal who I guess he had been sending things who is a Catholic and he happened to come that service that day now he said that there was a lot of rain in Ghana and that's why they switch a service about 1:00 so connect to our service here you know after that Serv was played the whole testimony everything else that that man came up and said if he don't give his life to Jesus now he'll go to hell and he asked to get baptized in Jesus name what a thing and you you know sometime people do things and it's just what God wants and God wanted that man to hear the testimony of sister Monica and the family and the whole service and everything else and him hearing him saying I'm going up yonder there's a real place now there's a real place up so reading from uh Hebrews 12 verse1 and 2 wherefore seeing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witness says let us lay aside every weight and the sin which do so easily beset us let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the UT finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame came and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God 1 Corinthians chapter 9 verse 24 Paul speaks know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run in other words the way you run all right there's a way to run so run that he may obtain and every man that striveth for the Mastery Hallelujah is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible Crown but we an Incorruptible I therefore so run this is Paul speaking I therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight I not as one that be to the air but I keep under my body and bring it in this objection least that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a cast away and second Timothy uh verse 4 and this is Paul again he's coming to the end of the road and and and um he's seing these words I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day not only to me only but also all them that love is appearing may God bless his word let's pray one more time father God we thank you for your scriptures and may you come and interpret into our hearts bring life and and and and and power to your people in Jesus name I ask it amen you may be seated thank you again for coming out this morning and to hear and I pray that you be an active listener this morning that you would hear and receive and act upon the word of God so I have a title this morning the race of life that's the title I have the race of life and have an inspiration the race that is set before us are you ready amen you know this is not newspaper we're reading from this is not some fiction or some story book that you're reading from this is the Eternal Word of God God have no one else to express himself but by his word that's what make him God hallelujah that's why the Bible say the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God for God to express it he has to use men that's why he called prophets that they could speak God's word and God's word can fail certain things God cannot do and certain God God could do one thing he can't do his lie so once it come out of his mouth it it got to come to pass the day you eat thereof that day you shall surely die God meant that and God kept his word and had to run the man he put in the Garden Eden out of Eden the same God that place them in even run them out Hallelujah and put a guard around the tree and say don't let them touch that tree I love my son but he had to get out because I give him a word he disobey my word he have to get out from my presence he have to get out and don't touch that tree I love my sons I love my daughters but I give them the word and the word is God not your mother not your father the word is God not the pastor not the Elder the word is God not this church the word is God once you hear the word that's God speaking the word is God a lot of people have the god of their own imagination but the word is God you shall die in your s if you don't repent this morning because the word is God he demands your repentance he demands your confession he demands you getting it right this race of Life hallelujah hallelujah once you come on that mother's womb the race is on pow you're on your way oh give the Lord a shout you can't talk yet but the race is on it's a race of life and a race always have a beginning and a race always have a Finishing Line oh get Lord I shout in the house the race is not [Applause] forever sometime I going home and I tell my wife but many of those workers you see walking women men they walking and they don't even know retirement coming they feel working forever race always have a starting point on your marks get set and you're running you're not running forever whe there a long distance or whether there a Sprint there's a Finishing Line hallelujah praise God there's a Time season to everything under Heaven a time to be born a time to die a time to shout a time to dance a time to weep a time to gather Stones together a time to scatter a time of war and a time of Peace A Time To Hate and a time to love there's a time and season for everything under Heaven oh give the Lord a shout this race of life is a serious race and you are in it whether you're on PA you're still in it whether you stop running you're still in it it waiting for you oh give the Lord a shout in the house Oh Glory to God this is a race and you got to [Applause] [Music] [Applause] run for us who grain and have gray hair and ball head and balling we can't run backward you can't run backward into black hair and back and run backward to get the teeth that you lost you can't run backward you getting your teeth on the great back here and thing when you're going forward when you go going up yonder for us the rain means different things let's continue eastes 9:11 speaks and says I returned and I saw Under the Sun that the race is not to the Swift nor the battle to the strong neither yet bread to the wise nor yet riches to Men of understanding nor yet favor to Men of skill but time and chance happened to them all time and chance that's part of this race time and chance according to where you're born where your family is where you're located time and chance may not have the schools you might want may not have the jobs what you want may not have the opportunities time and chance so be grateful I should have a bigger show than that because where you are is time and chance God place you there to give you your time and your chance you could have been in a terrible condition you could be elsewhere but time and chance giv the opportunity and however it worked out you got to hear the gospel that's the key there that's the key right there is not your dress and your tie and your your your your um um um um um glasses and and and and hat and and house and land and car that's irrelevant that have to do with the flesh but we talking about have to do with the soul this flesh could die but that soul that soul that inner man is what you have to prepare for Oh Glory to God hallelujah hallelujah glory to [Applause] God hallelujah GL Paul said I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I've kept the feet but Bram he's talking about the angel was coming to him he said don't remember something is fixing to happen I don't know what it is but could it be this the reason I say this prepare yourselves am let us pray take our position in the army of his Believers and prepare ourselves for it may be later than we are thinking note he didn't say go to church sir let's go let's go granular now he didn't say go to church he said prepare yourself is that a scriptural order or not that's a scriptural order because the Bible said his wife had made herself shout out ready shout out ready not the pastor made them ready no his wife had made herself ready so every time you come to service there's a word that you could clothe yourself with there's a word that you could act upon there's a word that you can obey Hallelujah in your obedience to God you show you're a Christian not coming to church coming to church you're religious when you start to obey the word you become a Christian oh give the Lord a shout people like religion they like the covering they like to come to church because they have a spirit upon them to come to church but we not talking about coming to church we talking about you come in obedience to the word of God oh give the Lord I shout Amen brother Lon it may be the end time it may be time for the rainbows to sweep across the sky and I knock from Heaven saying time is no more if it is let's prepare ourselves friend to meet our God there's plenty of food lay in now let's make use of it let's make use of it now you really think that Russia Iran all these powerful Nations Iran is is Persia King of Persia Iraq Babylon they have mod names now but them are the same demons and spirits and Kings from back there you mean they have all these weapons and and wouldn't use it that not happening they will use it you mean all these wars around and you walking dainty in Trinidad like if that wouldn't affect us think again I was thinking about the scripture all that well on the Earth shall worship I said how could it come to all that means it has to have the technology to capture all all that dwell on the Earth shall worship the Beast except those who names written and for you to catch your name is written you have to have a revelation that your name is on that book and no Beast no devil and could Captivate you that devil was so good he offered Jesus all these Kingdoms in a Flash in his curved screen he show Jesus all he said all is M and I could give it to whomsoever I wanted you don't have to go to Calvary you don't have to pay the cry price you don't have to take a cross no just come and be under me and I will keep quiet behind you and you don't to pay no price and that's what some of you want you don't want to pay no price liar you have to pay a price there's a price for you to pay there's a cost oh give the Lord a shout in the house my God my God hallelujah praise God I feel we coming on to the water like Gideon who want to go back go back who want to go back to your old church go back who want to go and dance and party go back and dance and party who is on the Lord's Side come unto me Oh Glory to God praise God praise God Moses told them oh glory to God you want to dance and party and fet and smoke and wear your minis skirt you wear long dress in church you wear your minis skirt outside go back and we you me you don't have to come to church stay home oh give the Lord a shout but who is on the Lord's Side come under the word come into [Music] Christ my God I love this God I'm sering he's a god of the word he ain't forcing anybody to do nothing you want to smoke smoke on you want to drink drink on you want to lust lust on praise God but if any man in my voice and open the door I will stop with him oh glory to God hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus may be seated whatam speaks you know in the old time when they used to make gold before they had smelt it to burn it up out they used to beat the go out beat the sludge out the iron the copper the stuff and keep beating turn it over beating it the Indians will call it beating the goal you know how they could tell when the IR was out of it and all the dirt and stuff and drust was out of it when the one here we go that was beaten could see his own reflection like a mirror it was clean and clear enough till reflected to beeter that's the way God does he takes gold that he has found in the earth and he beats it by the Holy Spirit and turn it over and over beating it how much you getting lick some you getting beat he finished yet he had to turn you over more beat until he see his own reflection so stop complaining I want to kill that sickly complaining Spirit like if you want somebody to hold you and mle you and and a water not here there a brother came from some other church here and he Doty doy I say go back I said we're not helping you don't waste your time sitting down here don't waste your time in this church if it's we not being effective to you find a church find a group where they could be effective to you he went straight back I not trying to hold anybody hold you for I don't want to hold a goat hold on a cow holding the Sheep go me to to rling with goat and a big old horn and then flip it on the ground there a nothing in this goat flipping thing you play Mator because a big big bul flag and go just pull the flag that run straight out I'm not going to matter with no bull and no goat I didn't make you I inform you I didn't raise you up you come with your attitudes and your spirit I'm here to drive them off of you I'm here to blay the word upon you you don't try to change me God sent me to present this word to you okay the Lord I shout you met me here you didn't send for me God sent me Give the Lord a shout in the house like sister Monica chandel testimony she said he she was his first convert and she sat there and he preached to her and 62 empty chairs that that is fit and she said we saw everybody come through that door and the devil would tell Rascal TR to upset and overthrow the church just how the devil want wanted to raise up one ins to overthrow the church they find you're not deep enough they find not this they find people always find and find and find and you you find one find where God to that's why I'm not into politics I'm not into politics I'm into truth because the Bible said You shall know the truth and the truth you see the politics you have to bend to this one you have to twist this one because you don't want to offend this one I just say it's so and you say so I have no s to say it this is the word of God you like it you don't like it that is still your business I have nothing to do with what you think about it I have to do with what you hear as long as I'm not bringing my thoughts and ideas I have to give you the word because the word is the word is the word is oh give the Lord some Praises I am not God the word is God I am subject to this very word all of us are subject to this very word and we are running this race how you're running slow fast medium how you're running slack loose how you're running some of you in PA sitting on a rock how you running Hallelujah have a way to run you know some people take shortcuts you know but then they disqualify they had a race recently somewhere in China I believe and it has some Africans around some long distance and they catch the camera tell them go go go they holding back they slowing down let the Chinese man win they take the medal from him that's politics they pay them fell some real money you know long just slow slow and the man the man from Beijing or something so he he win Hallelujah Glory Glory fraudulent dishonest and you car on this Christian race dishonest is God you're serving you could outsmart your mother father brother outm the church out smart this one and your family and whatnot to get that then some people they run after money and they have no friends because if they get friends they they have to share they don't want to share they're mean and greedy too with it and they run at the end it I was tell man about somebody with a billionaire and at the funeral only have about six or seven or eight people that's sad that's some people forget it at the funeral thousands of people because they affected lives to change lives oh my Hallelujah the greatest thing you could do is to live for others to be mean and selfish and unwilling and not serving is a terrible thing all right here we go here where I going to get you now so that's the way God does he takes the gold that he has F on the earth and he beats it by the Holy Spirit turns it over and over and beaten it until he can see his reflection and that what he's supposed to do reflect the Son of God here we go there's the part now so many of us try to do the works of Christ before the reflection of Christ in us now there is the trouble we find those things happening you know I know it we see stumbles along the world we find here we go the scrap peap of Ministers of Christians piled along the road is because they didn't go into it right so if you don't go right you end up a scrap peep you know how the trucks pass around buying scrap metal old battery buying buying scrap metal it had a truck I saw the truck going I said but he should be a scrap metal one old truck looking to buy they should that truck should be put another truck don't want you to be like that a scrap PE she was a Christian Lord look at she now he was a Christian he's a church man but look where he what is a course a race course or a running track is a route where races or horse races or human races motor races take place these these courses are designed to provide a fair and challenging environment for competitors and a typically marks with a starting and finishing points as well as various checkpoints or obstacles depending upon the type of race to finish one's course finish the course is usually or generally to complete a journey a task a course in education training a specific project finishing one's course in life implies completing various stages and challenges and responsibilities that comes with it amen it consists it can it can be a point on reaching one's goal fulfilling your responsibility like how the Bible talk about shall this shall a man leave his mother and father and cleave unto his wife when parenting is fully accomplished you have mature individuals in the home that could make life's decision and take on and take on their own life's journey and so on when the children are smaller finishing the course means getting them a full education being dear for them when they need you because there's always somebody that will want to guide them and if you don't guide somebody else will guide that's how the devil does it so the what they want and the children need is Godly Parents and godly parents and so on in them isn't that right but these courses all these courses are individuals you have people who learn at their own pace some people learn faster on others and so like that so it's not a general course we running the course is not a we race in we in the race is individuals running in the race do you get that now so your race is customized for you your cost is set for you you can't run somebody else race you set you are running the race and the course God has precept for you glory to God based upon your abilities and your circumstance and so on so I have here a few type of ways people run race some people run fast some people run steady right some people run slow some people run focused some people the focus are they're disciplined and committed to stay on track am C to them off you to see it as students you see these slack students and the teachers here will know what I'm talking about you'll see the comedians in the class because they not learning anything the cracking jokes just to distract and something like that they affect the whole class when they out of it the whole class settled and so like that some people are focused some people are distracted easily distracted from their race course there are some people that are focused and they are discipline committed to stay on track we have we get that some people are competitive they only trying to outperform others and reach ahead of the pack some are directionless without a clear sense of direction or purpose feeling lost or uncertain about their goals even now uh my grandchildren 9 years old they have um car A Day In My Time had nothing like that and they're getting the children to be aware of career paths career opportunities and you seeing the children dressing like what they want to be I saw one of them 9-year-old dressing like a a Hostess equip it with he pull a long back so firemen doctors the people have long thing and everything else and everybody have the so what I'm saying then because what what they want they want the children at an early age to get a vision because Vision give you a sense of purpose we preach that that's only Bible you have no vision without the vision the people without the vision people they perish because there is no vision with no vision there's no target with no target there's no goal there's no purpose there's no drive like you're smoking ganja then you're weeding weed side you you're weeding away getting head because there is no drive or no purpose because once you find purpose you get to pick up everybody just trying to shake you off that purpose cuz once they get purpose and vision watch them Devils come watch Friends come watch family come to upset to distract to get you off the channel and the line that God put you on Oh Glory to God if I was listening to my family i' never be here this morning if I was listen to my family I never get baptized in Jesus name I heard from God oh glory to God you have to hear from God yourself your father can't make that for you your mother can't make that from you not even your husband or wife could do that for you you got to hear from God yourself when you hear from God that's the voice of God to you that's a rock that's a revelation that's a anchor in your soul Oh Glory to God you need that if you don't have it ask God for that this morning there's some people run this race responsible prioritizing accountability and ethical Behavior First Timothy 6 6- 12 says but godliness with contentment is great gain listen to these words for we brought nothing into this world that's the beginning of the race and it is certain we can carry nothing out I was telling about a Channel about smartw watch counting steps heart rate be read Bush he he never bought one he never had one he don't need that where he going now so what I was telling him about he doesn't need that he does need walk around his Savannah and touching to and exercise him because he want to live long he has gone to where there's no old age there no tiredness there hallelujah oh my my sometimes you feel to go sometimes look at because this world is terrible but we are here for a witness to prove that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah we brought nothing into this world verse 7 and it is certain we can carry nothing out having food and rment let us therefore be content but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snear and into many foolish and hurtful lust which Dr men in destruction and predition not money is the root of all evil For the Love of Money That's Right is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have heard from the Fate why because they have their own internal lust so their lust make them ear in the fate and they still come to church but they allow lust and sometime God has give you what you have in your heart why some people love false teachers because they're false on the inside and they like the Mysteries and the revelations these men bringing and men they know the man fals but they love what he is saying they love how it has come W I never see it so what did the Bible say say what did the word say all right but thou oh man of God this I want to get to now flee these things flee and follow after what follow after righteousness godliness Faith love patience meekness it means you're looking and you're following after it you're walking after it you not say it coming it coming no follow it run from that and follow this flee from that and follow this you have to flee and follow when you get rid of stuff you have to get other stuff to replace what you're getting rid of it's not good enough it's not good enough just to get rid of you have to get something in his place he said flee that and follow that flee that certain things have to run from certain friends you have to delete over your phone because they going to destroy you oh give the Lord a shout in the house certain people you need to cut off you need to cut them off all together have no fellowship with Darkness Hallelujah have no fellowship with

I'm trying to make you aware that is not going to be an easy route a preachers in Ivory Coast a preacher in London the brother random said the people that follow the pillar of fire will have a rough time and the bride will be a hunted persecuted groups and I know there people in this message will follow the books and say they sign up for that when the test come to see what Christian you are in

like it's like is this real people wasn't drinking then you know I believe personally things will happen over tonight I believe the Corona virus was a dry run on The Obedience of Nations to follow instructions I believe when the instructions is given Every Nation will comply because they will be following this new world order I believe that we don't know when the next pandemic coming when the next disease come we don't know what we do know is the prophet prophesy the church will be closed down so consider it's a privilege to be in this church at this time that's how I consider it whenever I come to church I say hallelujah thank you Lord It's a privilege because one day you'll want to go to church and there have be no church to go to we might be meeting in homes might meeting in houses Hallelujah so don't take for granted think but friend send me such a testimony appreciate me as pastor and different thing like that and I guess when you think about it what if God put a rug under me some wonder about that you know what people say about me Bo I wish I could come and listen box and hear them say serious what if God pulled the rug head to you going say boy he was something else boy and I'm telling you you can't even pass me here now much on the other side got see your behavior and I know your attitude and I know your spirit I want you think you don't um appreciate but you know he alive he kicking he still alive if he dead hypocrisy love people now see them right now you think we don't have stress and pressure and exalted some I feel well tired exhausted but I come and say Saint oh God if you only know saying that people started lean back already that that spirit will come upon you and you you will feel exhausted and start as sleep in church one time we can't do that we have to go beyond ourselves to minister to you because we are on a road and a path on this race of life and we have to finish the course I preach to 12 people preach to three people look brother George right there one time when I come to K there was three say you say why you didn't steal why you I say when you repent go forgive you the next day you repent because something in him knew that that wasn't the right thing to say God was just testing me to see if I preach a three four five I preach a one doesn't matter that's what I'm called to do to preach the gospel Hallelujah little did we know that was a seed to produce this miracle here and we have a miracle here right now there were people that walk in the building and they walk into a completed building but they wasn't there and part of how it was built but there are those who went through the process Oh Glory to God and here on Earth we have to be formed to the word image and we have to go through the process there is no shortcuts Oh Glory to God not he that starts it's he that finishes let me see if I can wrap up here that there's no shortcuts you are disqualified at the end of the race it's a race friends you're racing against time for some woman they're racing against the fertility clock biological clock racing against the mortgage window how much time to pay off our house if we get a mortgage you're racing against time to rebong from a fall sometimes sometime it's too late racing Against Time to Get It Right some run slow some running stops some start and they just quit hallelujah hallelujah the Bible Hebrews 2:9 says but we see Jesus that is Hebrews 2 verse 9 but we see Jesus who was made a little ler than the angels for the suffering of death purpose he couldn't die as an angel he was made lower to become man for the suffering of death crowned with Glory and Honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man for it what for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons into glory to make here we go the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering for both he that sanctifieth and they who are Sanctified are all one for which cause he's not ashamed to call them Brethren oh my so it says here he Amplified for it was an act worthy of God verse 10 and fitting to the divine nature that he for whose sake and by whom all things have have an existence in bringing many sons into Glory should make the pioneer of the Salvation perfect should bring to maturity The Human Experience necessary to be perfectly equipped for his office as high priest Hallelujah true suffering oh that's beautiful in other words Jesus experienced death experience suffering that he could be that perfect high priest that can be touched by the feeling of infirmities so he knows what you go through he knows your suffering he knows your pain and he can make proper intercession on your behalf oh give the Lord some Praises Bible said he learn obedience by the things that he suffered Oh Glory to God he suffered we want to have our own rights but he suffered he give up his rights he learned obedience hallah Hallelujah so he became perfect through suffering to finish this work that he could be that high priest isn't that right through that suffering he could come to that maturity and he said it in Luke 13 verse 32 he said go and tell that fox talking about the behold I cast out devils and I do cures today and tomorrow and the third day I shall be perfected amen and the Amplified Luke 133 says he said to them go and tell that fox Sly and crafty skulking and cowardly behold I drive out demons and perform healings today and tomorrow and on the third day I finish or complete my course so Jesus Knew by the identification of the three gifts to wise men brought of gold frankinson and myrrh God in service to die he knew his course finished at death paying the price not only to become high priest but to get the book to loose your name Hallelujah amen do you get it now so when he finished his course he say finished it was finished he get the book nowall Hallelujah he can reveal every mystery now and you are the Mysteries that was parted in the book Oh Glory to God he released your name that you cannot be deceived because the devil deceive all except whose name's written so there has to be a means that your name could be identified oh give the Lord a shout in the house [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord so he had was to go through this Human Experience so now we come to a great cloud of witnesses in Hebrews 12 oh praise God all the way all the saints was going on before making up that cloud who have ran their race in life and their race is over and they make out the cloud of witnesses of Barack and Gideon and Samson and Jeffy and William brandham and all the Saints have G on before making out this CL of witnesses and he saying come on come on come on come on come on you can make it amen God hallelujah praise God because Hebrews 13:14 for here we have no continuing City but we seek one to come glory to God hallelujah there's no paying mortgage there there's no bills over there oh there's no sickness there there's no wheelchair there there's no blind there there's no death and dumb there there's no there there's no depression there and frustration there and you can't take get there they don't have that over there oh glory to God what a time is going to be so we only passing here to have this Human Experience on this Earth we passing through to be a testimony here we have no continuing City but we seeking a city who make and bilder of God glory to God hallelujah glory to God oh yes Lord give him some [Applause] Praises I'll be honest with you today I have 21 pages and now reach 12 all right so we see how it goes I wouldn't worry out 2 Timothy 2 verse 5 very important scripture if a man also strive for masteries yet he is not crowned except he strive lawfully Amplified says if anyone enters competitive games he's not crowned unless he completes lawfully fairly according to the rules laid down so this analogy of race is clean and clear in the scriptures just like a natural race am if you don't run correctly you'll be disqualified so don't bother with all who hustling to be this and that and they claiming adoption claiming this and claiming all kind of thing let them claim B with that like a brother tell me you know he ahead of me I say brother I'm I'm I'm running as fast as I could I'm going to get there I'm going to get there I know you're ahead so if I Runner makes a shortcut cut to the field he be disqualified he get Applause because people think he really come true especially long distance race walk on the hills and two valleys and all kind of thing like that and he might take a shortcut and the see boy coming come Hallelujah next minute when they run the cameras Hallelujah you thought didn't have cameras see they City shortcut his diall somebody get shame on top the top the podium after get the goal you know I say give it back and you know who get the goal the next man you come in second you you you you are legit Hallelujah and all of a sudden when you thought you make it they say got to go on that platform there that goal is yours yes oh glory to God he that overcome [Laughter] it God go put that goal on you because you're running according to the rules so listen to this Hallelujah but AB BR Paul said that seeing we are Compass about such a great cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin will Bes set us Paul was speaking on Olympics and so forth that was in Greece and Rome and so forth and know that you had to play that game fear for if you did not you would be disqualified and tonight as Born Again Christians as Believers we are the end time we have got to play the game according to the rules we have got to run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto the auor and finisher of Faith Enoch by faith the great Heroes of Faith seeing we are com about with such great Witnesses here we are tonight right in the shadows of the coming of the Son of God and yet we find a church in an anemic condition we ought to be great strong Mighty wirers of the Fate that would shake a nation God gives it to us we would just receive it so that those things upon us that holds us back from running this what he's saying the things that hold you back from running watch let's lay aside all those little ways now he became us sinners that we might become his righteousness he in other words like this he become me that I might become him he was the son of God I was a sinner he take my place become a sinner that I might be a son of God God and when we see that it ought to attract the attention of every man and woman to lay aside every little skeptic talk lay aside every weight oh Blessed Be In The Name Of The Lord hallelujah praise God I'm I'm going to WRA up Jesus he talk about the woman who washes feet right and Jesus just sit there and watched her never move her foot till she got done and then you might not see one person healed that you prayed for just keep on praying for them I said if I pray for 500 a night all 500 dead in the morning tomorrow night I'll be preaching Divine Healing praying for the sick here the part I want to get to now he will let you come right down through the Feats and everything else till you come right down to the end of the road and finish your work like he did that woman she wanted to do him a service so he just held his feet out there let her wash them he have said don't do that she would have jumped and run but let her do the service hallelujah hallelujah are you ready and after she got to finish the service that she was doing to do then he looked up to that hypocrite standing there was trying to cast the Blackness on his name said Simon I've got something to say to you not to her but to you you stand back there in your heart that's the reason you brought me down here you have no fellowship with me didn't I know it you never brought me down here but you set me back there and make fun of me you never give me no water to wash my feet you never give me nothing to sooe me me sitting here burning and hurting you never give me no oil for my face you was ashamed to kiss me welcome or shake my hand you was ashamed before this company he was ashamed to do it this woman since she has come in she has did nothing but rubbed my feet and B them with the very tears of her eyes she wiped them with a tower of her own here I will show you whether a prophet or not now I'll speak to you and my you know what got Jes Jesus said her sins that are many are forgiven Simon had to hold onto his sins what a position to be in hallelujah hallelujah have the Bible have the books have the quotes have the tapes and God turned to a woman Hallelujah and say her sins that are many are forgiven this woman Oh Glory to God I want to be like that woman I want them to say this woman Oh Glory to God you give service to the Lord and God come and reward you and God come and bless you praise God unto him overcome I will give thee a Crown of Life not since not even a cup of cold water given to the name in the name of the Lord fails to receive a reward oh my thank you Lord Jesus I'm going to skip there the race of Life Hallelujah I'm going to finish you could run this race with a lack of Direction proverb says where there is no vision people perish you just running running with no vision you could run this race with the with a negative mindset you could run this race with unhealthy habits Philippians tells us whatsoever is lovely whatever is true whatsoever is pure think on these things we are exalted to have a positive mindset a mindset that God is pleased with hallu isn't that right oh glory to God you run this race not treating your body right and the Bible talk about you are the temple Jesus of the Holy Ghost you could one this and you don't want to change I know that on the job anytime a law come a new rule come people fighting and protesting and fighting they don't want Hallelujah change than hallelujah praise God you could run this race with an attitude of open to learning not an arrogant that you know everything you want to learn you want to know you want to understand isn't that right you could run this race with clear goals and vision according to habac write the vision and it PL you see the vision you catch it you know what you want for your life your father shaky your mother shaky but you not shaky because God gave you a vision Oh Glory to God your wife may not have a relation like Sarah but because you're like Abraham you know Isaac coming so you're running preparing that crib because Isaac coming because God spoke to you God revealed himself to you and once God revealed himself to you you're getting ready to run man Hallelujah you can run with determination and resilience persistence Hallelujah hear what the unjust judge said Oh Glory to God is that right praise God hallelujah so this race of Life shows how there are different approaches and how there are different outcomes based upon the decisions and actions that we take in this race of Life Hallelujah some people fail continually and they're not changing their choices they're not changing decisions they say if you dig a hole right and you ain't get P going and I keep digging the same hole you're foolish man you're un foolishness at least dig another hole dig another place you're digging you ain't going no way you're still digging you're still digging you're still digging stop digging that hole tell yourself there's a lost cause dig another place dig another hole plant another crop plant another field Oh Glory we got to do something it's all our choice all where we see a car house land lights and whatnot it was always here but man dig put the hand in the ground and discover this and discover that and melt that and shape that and we have what we have and if there's going to be a Revival everything that we have is in this word everything that we have need of is in this message let's put our hands let's get our hands dirty get your knees dirty get your mouth praising and praying to [Applause] God I'm speeding down here now my God just know you as 12 look we on 18 right now Oh Glory to God hallelujah what hinders us what disqualifies us from running this race the sin the sin he's not talking to people outside the church you know he's talking about Sin in the church sin on people's lives he talk about unbelievers to get saved sin in your race sin under the weight Oh Glory to God Jesus himself G the parable hallelujah hallelujah of the man choked with cares

your Bible in a consistent manner Hallelujah Bible Dusty and Rusty but Facebook WhatsApp tick Tok tock tick wherever and you're right inside of that and people s what kind of stupidness Hallelujah I I I can't look at half of them things praise God because just occupy yourself and you're getting this one it flick the next one flick the next one and catch yourself you just flicking all kind of gimmick people people doing things just for attention thaty devil trying to distract you from your race just getting your court up it is a nonsense kill it two clubs de it get rid of it so listen to this I'm closing 1 Corinthians 6 69 says know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived M please neither fornicators idolators nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind no thieves no coverers no drunkards no revilers no extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God so all these sins listed here Hallelujah eminate Abus of mankinds sexual immorality adultery tough greed drunkness slander stating all those who practice these things shall not inherit the kingdom of God Galatians 1 6 tonight I Marvel Paul said that you saw remove it from him that called you unto the grace of Christ unto another gospel which is not another but there is some that trouble you that would pervert the gospel of Christ this perversion of the word is still since in Bible times but though we Anchor Point or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than which have preached unto you let him be a cursed and as we said before so say I now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than you have received let him be a cursed all these things are hindrances from that race that God called it to Rus 1 John 2 15 and 17 love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man Lov the world the love of the father is not in him that is final you can love the world and love the father too let's read it again love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love the father not in him for all that is in in the world lust of the flesh lust of the eyes the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world so we are warned against love in the world oh praise the name of the Lord we are warned just about two or three more Disobedience 1st Samuel 15:22 and Samuel said hath the Lord as great Delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey it is better than sacrifice than to happen to the fat of rams what God want from us all of us is obedience a lot of people hearing you know but not obeying I'm going to close I'm 19 of 21 Luke 189 to4 he speak a parable two men went up in the temple to pray one Pharisee one Publican the Pharisees stood and prayed thus with himself God I thank Thee I am not as the other men are extortioners and unjust and adulterers and even as this Publican and I fast twice in the week I give my tights of all that I possess and the Publican standing a far off would not lift up as much as his eyes Under heaven but smoted his breath and saying God be merciful to me a sinner I tell you this man went down to his house Justified rather than the other for everyone that exalted himself shall be a beast and he that humble himself shall be exalted Pride on this last one I'm going to close with this play something softly from Hebrews 5 reading from verse 12 for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and I become as such need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that usth milk is unskillful in the world of righteousness for he's a bab but strong meat belongeth to them that are full age even those by reason who have used of their senses exercise to discern but good and evil so there is a real danger in staying spiritually immature you must want that Perfection that brings you into spiritual maturity let's all [Music] stand thank you Lord Jesus where he leads [Music] meon where he [Music] oh where he will follow thank thank you [Music] where beond [Applause] [Music] I'll go with
