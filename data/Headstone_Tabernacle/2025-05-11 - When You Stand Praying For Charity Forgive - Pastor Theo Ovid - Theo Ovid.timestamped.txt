[28:21] church Bible tabernacle in the USA. I
[28:24] was there preaching and um pastor
[28:26] Kenneth Luva is the is love is the the
[28:30] pastor of the church there. Amen. So
[28:32] it's a great privilege for us to be here
[28:33] this morning and I welcome each and
[28:36] every one of you. So today I want to
[28:39] share something with you. I I want to
[28:40] have a message like to play with to to
[28:42] you and um I want to read a scripture
[28:45] here. from Matthew
[28:49] 24:42-51. Um, it says here, "Watch
[28:52] therefore, for you know not what hour
[28:54] your Lord come." This is Jesus speaking.
[28:56] For know this that if the good man of
[28:58] the house had known in what watch the
[29:01] thief would come, he would have watched
[29:04] and would have not suffered his house to
[29:05] be broken up. Therefore, be also ready,
[29:09] for in such an hour as he think not, the
[29:11] son of man cometh. Who then is a
[29:13] faithful and wise servant whom the Lord
[29:16] had made ruler over his household to
[29:18] give them meat in due season? Blessed is
[29:20] that servant whom is Lord when he come
[29:22] and shall find so doing. Verily I say to
[29:24] you that he shall make him ruler over
[29:27] all his goods. But if that evil servant
[29:29] shall see in his heart, my lord delayeth
[29:32] his coming. Now they're not saying with
[29:34] the mouth. They're saying that with
[29:36] their heart. And what they say in their
[29:38] heart cause them to act and manifest a
[29:41] certain way. That evil servants in his
[29:43] heart, my lord the l is coming and he
[29:45] shall begin. This is the action. Now he
[29:47] shall begin to smite his fellow servants
[29:50] and to eat and drink with the drunkards.
[29:53] The lord of that servant shall come in a
[29:55] day when you look at not for him and in
[29:57] awe that he's not aware of and shall cut
[30:00] him aunder and appoint his him his
[30:02] portion with the hypocrites. there shall
[30:04] be weeping and nashing of teeth. So this
[30:08] is a very interesting scripture here
[30:10] because it means then that the prophecy
[30:12] is that there come a time when people
[30:14] will say the Lord delay is coming. Now
[30:16] if you say the Lord is coming then I
[30:18] could fight you and battle because
[30:20] coming is a far off. But if we
[30:22] understand 2 Thessalonians 4:16 the Lord
[30:25] has descended with a shout then the
[30:27] bride don't say the Lord delay is
[30:29] coming. The bride say the Lord has
[30:31] descended
[30:32] and giving us preparation for his
[30:35] coming. In other words, he's appearing
[30:37] now in order to show us a sign that he's
[30:40] coming. Isn't that right? So the bride
[30:43] of Christ will not say the Lord delay is
[30:46] coming. You can't go and smite your
[30:47] fellow servant, smite your sister, smite
[30:49] your brother, and you are the big smite
[30:50] man. It can't work that way. Amen. But
[30:53] what I want to say and this is
[30:54] interesting uh speaking about Mother's
[30:56] Day and Baram says that regardless of
[30:59] how uh wicked or how bad a woman is when
[31:03] she's about to have a baby a sweet
[31:06] spirit comes over that woman because
[31:09] there's a spirit life around her waiting
[31:12] to catch that baby. So a sweet spirit
[31:14] comes around that woman before she gives
[31:17] birth to that baby. Regardless of what
[31:19] kind of woman it is. regardless of what
[31:21] kind of woman it is, a sweet spirit come
[31:23] around her. So I'm asking, where is that
[31:26] sweet spirit before the word is born
[31:29] into manifestation? Because it's a
[31:30] prophecy that the word that's in you is
[31:33] to be born into manifestation. In other
[31:35] words, the word in you have to come to
[31:37] life. But before that happens, there got
[31:39] to be a sweet spirit that come among the
[31:42] people. Isn't that right? Now we read
[31:44] that on wet Friday and I'm not going to
[31:46] go back into that about the pope and and
[31:48] and so on like that from America. We
[31:50] know the prophecy but in that message he
[31:53] said that uh uh the church of God from
[31:56] the the the real bride from all the
[31:59] different groups at that time he said
[32:01] Baptist, Methodist, Pentecostal but we
[32:02] know what it is right now. All the
[32:04] different interpretations the elect of
[32:06] that group that going to make up the
[32:07] body of Christ they will be welded
[32:09] together or knit together or driven
[32:11] together by the love of God. So
[32:13] something have to drive the people.
[32:15] Praise God. by by the love of God. Isn't
[32:18] that right? Something going to move us.
[32:20] Something going to stir us our spirit.
[32:23] Now he also said, I'm not going to read
[32:24] another quote. He also said once the
[32:27] devil go on a rampage when Christ is
[32:30] being formed in Mary. So when Christ was
[32:33] being formed in Mary, here come the laws
[32:35] now come and bring taxation. So Mary had
[32:38] to leave where she was to journey to
[32:40] Nazareth because there is where the
[32:42] prophecy the child manager going to be
[32:44] born. So you say watch the devil move on
[32:46] a rampage when when Christ has been
[32:48] formed in you. Oh glory to God. So is it
[32:51] that this pope that take out America he
[32:53] is as big sign you know that not a
[32:54] slight thing. There's a big thing we are
[32:57] just around the corner now. So that he
[32:59] have a sign that that's a sign there but
[33:01] we have to have our sign. And I am
[33:03] saying the sign that come for the bride
[33:04] is the spirit of sweetness. the spirit
[33:07] of brotherly kindness because the
[33:09] prophet did say that we only have heard
[33:11] the message intellectually but we have
[33:13] to lay in his presence until it ripen
[33:17] until it gets sweet until it ba down. So
[33:20] all this revelation and mysteries have
[33:22] to come into our life. It's not the word
[33:25] becomes more word. It's the word to
[33:26] become flesh. And when the word become
[33:28] flesh it could live, it could act. It
[33:31] could do. Oh give the Lord some praises.
[33:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let me say this
[33:36] to you. All the virtues and the
[33:39] characteristics of charity is for this
[33:41] side of life. We don't need that on the
[33:44] other side. Charity suffered long and is
[33:47] kind. You don't need that on the other
[33:48] side. We need that here. Hallelujah.
[33:51] Thinketh not his own. Is not easily
[33:53] provoked. Beareth all things. Believeth
[33:55] all things. Hope all things. Endure at
[33:58] all things. That is for here
[34:01] because the other side is perfect.
[34:05] You don't need a fifold on the other
[34:07] side. You don't need a man of God in the
[34:10] hall or some bishop and some message
[34:11] pope on the other side. You don't need
[34:13] all of that in the other side. Other
[34:14] side is perfect. We need charity here.
[34:17] We need love here. We need a sweetness
[34:20] here. We lead take right
[34:27] here. You don't even need to plan on the
[34:30] other side. You plan here. You make
[34:32] goals here. You you set goals and
[34:35] achievement here. You press your way
[34:37] here. The kingdom is preached here and
[34:39] every man press into it. Give the Lord a
[34:42] shout in the house this
[34:44] morning. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[34:48] Hallelujah. Over here you feel pain,
[34:51] disappointment, grief, loneliness,
[34:54] tiredness, weariness, upset, mad at this
[34:57] one, angry at this one. But thank God
[34:59] you have a perfect standing through the
[35:01] blood. your your state is up and down.
[35:03] Your state is variable. But God, when
[35:05] God looked down over through his blood
[35:08] and he sees you, he see you and he drop
[35:10] your charges. He dismiss your case. No
[35:12] matter what the church members say, no
[35:14] matter what your neighbors say, no
[35:15] matter what your people say, it doesn't
[35:17] matter what they say. It matter what God
[35:19] say. And if God say he dropped your
[35:21] charges, he dropped your charges and he
[35:24] has dismissed your case.
[35:29] Give the Lord some praises.
[35:32] Glory. And we know from based upon
[35:35] Friday, if you haven't heard the Friday
[35:36] premitting exaltation, it's on YouTube.
[35:38] You can go and listen to it. Based upon
[35:40] Friday, the accuser accused us before
[35:41] God. So he in God's presence, look, he
[35:44] did. She did. And Jesus only in blood.
[35:47] Blood. Blood. That's all she bring.
[35:49] Blood. I pay for that. I pay for that.
[35:52] You can't bring that. I pay for that. I
[35:55] pay for that. Since past to come, I pay
[35:58] for that.
[36:04] So the coins, we know the woman who lost
[36:06] the coin in the Bible just quickly. But
[36:08] I'm talking about it didn't have a a
[36:09] wedding ring at that time, a coin around
[36:11] a head, a band, and then the band have
[36:14] coins to live clean to him and so on
[36:15] like that. Then he said you could find
[36:17] that in Galatians 5. What Galatians 5
[36:20] says, um, love, joy, peace. That's a
[36:24] life.
[36:28] They they not loving yourself and you
[36:29] have love but you loving yourself
[36:32] you oho I love me that nothing special
[36:36] you're going to sing you know because
[36:37] the Bible prophesied that men shall be
[36:39] lovers of themselves that is not kind of
[36:41] love we talking about you know if you
[36:42] have love you have to show it
[36:48] how you going to love and gossip about
[36:49] somebody and love them you're bad
[36:50] talking them and you love them what kind
[36:52] of love is that triny love that no Bible
[36:56] All right. So, so, so it was coming dark
[36:58] and the woman realized she lost a coin
[37:00] and if you catch it without a coin, you
[37:02] take it to the temple and then you
[37:04] you're dismissed. When the husband come
[37:05] and see without a coin, they know
[37:06] something went wrong. You're dismissed.
[37:08] You're divorced. That's the end of it.
[37:09] So, this woman know she didn't do
[37:11] anything wrong and off key, but she was
[37:13] sick sitting that coin. And the Bible
[37:14] says the neighbors can see the dust
[37:16] flying. That's when you serious. You see
[37:18] when you're in the flesh and you want to
[37:20] sweep casual, you don't want neighbors
[37:21] see your house so dirty. So, you're
[37:23] sweeping easy.
[37:25] Easy, easy. Sometime you sweep under the
[37:28] carpet and all easy. You're praying so
[37:31] sure.
[37:34] But when you're really desperate, you
[37:36] care what the neighbors see. Carpet
[37:39] going out, pictures going out, all kind
[37:42] of thing going out. You say, "But what's
[37:43] wrong with that woman? Boy, look at
[37:45] stuff coming out that house." Yes,
[37:47] because I'm looking for something. He
[37:49] that seek shall find. He that knock the
[37:51] door shall be open. He that askketh
[37:53] shall be given. You're too quiet. You're
[37:56] too ordinary. You have to fight here.
[37:59] You nothing to fight across there. You
[38:00] know, when I get over yonder, we'll be
[38:02] singing and shouting. When I get over
[38:04] yonder, over yonder, but here you have
[38:07] to fight for every inch of ground that
[38:09] you know is your own. And this pastor,
[38:13] this preacher, this son is going to
[38:15] fight. I intend to fight. I fighting for
[38:17] myself and I'll fight it for you, too.
[38:19] If I take on your face, I sign up here
[38:21] and stop preaching. Well, I don't bother
[38:23] with your face because I believe you're
[38:25] going to come through anyhow. I don't
[38:27] preach to your face. I'll get scared up
[38:29] here. Oh, give the Lord a shout. Look at
[38:30] me started this. Oh, glory to God.
[38:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[38:37] Sometime I come here, I see you low. I
[38:38] see you down. I see your battery run
[38:39] out. You forget to plug it in.
[38:43] Sometime you come with no charge at all.
[38:45] That's a tough one, you know, because
[38:46] when you have no charge, you can't
[38:48] praise God. You can't shout your mouth
[38:49] tight. You're heavy like lead. And we
[38:51] have to preach you out of that condition
[38:53] and give you a kind of instant charge
[38:56] charge from your theophony. You come
[38:58] here and feel good about yourself. You
[38:59] come here, you feel good about God. You
[39:01] feel good about the cross. You feel good
[39:03] about Jesus. You feel good about the
[39:07] blood. God didn't send brother Brandham
[39:10] to make us
[39:11] religious. Too much a
[39:14] churchy
[39:15] fire. Afterward, it's hard to resemble
[39:17] the church. It's not resembling the
[39:20] church. resembling Jesus, too
[39:22] churchified.
[39:24] Hallelujah. That's what happened to the
[39:25] the scribe and Pharisees and they were
[39:27] so churchified. They going to How come
[39:29] disciples not washing their hands
[39:30] before? Everything is a ceremony.
[39:32] Everything is a ceremony. It's a
[39:34] ceremony. You see that black smoke and
[39:35] blue smoke and going to smoke in the
[39:37] Vatican, right? White smoke and thing is
[39:39] a different kind of obia, but the same
[39:40] obia business. They don't know it as
[39:42] that, but we know it as that. It's a
[39:44] different kind of witchcraft. Is the
[39:45] same same thing we talking about. But
[39:47] there was war in heaven. Michael Fort
[39:49] and the Dragon Fort. We know where we
[39:52] come from. We know where we going and we
[39:55] know what's against us. Oh, the Lord I
[39:58] shout. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[40:02] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Listen to this.
[40:05] Spirits don't die. It have a time for
[40:07] spirits to be uh go to hell and
[40:09] different things. It jump from
[40:10] generation to generation. The same Roman
[40:13] spirit that went and persecuted after
[40:15] Jesus and the children, that same Roman
[40:17] spirit is loosed on the earth is still
[40:19] here. It had gone over. It's still here.
[40:22] And the same fate of the fathers is
[40:24] living still. The same fate of the
[40:27] fathers is living still. In spite of
[40:30] fire, dungeon and sword inside of the
[40:33] king homeless Christians over the years,
[40:35] we are still alive. We still
[40:36] representing the kingdom. We still
[40:38] representing his power. Oh, give the
[40:41] Lord a shout. It's a blessing and a
[40:43] privilege to be a Christian in this
[40:45] hour. You got to remain a Baptist. You
[40:48] could have been a good Methodist, but
[40:50] God delivered you. We have somebody to
[40:52] praise him for this
[40:54] [Music]
[41:05] morning. You be seated.
[41:08] I told you on Friday I was 19 years old
[41:10] where I hear pastors talking about
[41:11] millennium and going home and I watching
[41:13] them so
[41:16] 19 years old they read the same books I
[41:18] read ministers pastors talk about going
[41:21] home and glory and the millennium and I
[41:23] watch it but all these prophecies the
[41:25] pope have to come up America no trial no
[41:28] test what wrong with these men something
[41:30] is really wrong with them you know guys
[41:32] are back they want to escape the
[41:34] transformation of the process of life in
[41:36] order to escape to heaven. I work in
[41:39] school and teacher tell me she said over
[41:41] there all the Christian you want to go
[41:42] to heaven and glory. said, "No, not this
[41:43] one. Not this one. I want to hear as a
[41:47] witness. I don't want to die and go to
[41:49] heaven." Glory go glory right now. The
[41:52] men glory waiting on us.
[41:54] We have the work to do here now. They
[41:56] without us not made perfect. We have
[41:58] something to do. We are something to
[42:00] press. So don't sit here and watch me
[42:02] like if you don't have something to do.
[42:09] I put a put that statement for my
[42:11] children chat. We have a study have
[42:14] shown that those who go out and fishing
[42:16] catch more fish than those who
[42:21] don't. Though there's a big study those
[42:24] who go out fishing catch catch more fish
[42:27] than those who don't. So if we don't
[42:29] testify and witness and testify of the
[42:33] grace that come to our hearts and lives,
[42:35] we have nothing to show God. Afterwards,
[42:38] your bank account is nothing, car is
[42:40] nothing, house is nothing, car is
[42:41] nothing that not going to the kingdom,
[42:42] you know, we have plenty believers going
[42:44] on, you know, and I see them to the car,
[42:46] house, land or money with them. Not one
[42:49] of those things went with them. But when
[42:51] I say what will count is what we do for
[42:52] the kingdom. That's the only thing that
[42:55] will count. So you love your family and
[42:57] you're doing this and that and the
[42:58] other, but what will count is what will
[43:00] for the kingdom. All right, let me say
[43:01] wrap up here. I'm talking about the
[43:03] woman had a house cleaning time and so
[43:05] on like that. So watch. All right, let
[43:07] me skip this now. He said when the
[43:08] church when that time comes prophecy
[43:11] when the church finds his brotherly love
[43:12] when the church finds holy sea when the
[43:14] church finds his place in Christ and
[43:16] this message need anything else. I tell
[43:18] my brother I tell a brother I want to
[43:19] fellowship with you. He say I can't
[43:20] fellowship with you because we don't
[43:21] believe the same thing. That is madness
[43:24] that is a cult. That is that not no
[43:26] message. That is foolishness. You can't
[43:28] sit down and fellowship with me around a
[43:30] meal because you don't believe I believe
[43:32] what I believe. Says only believe in
[43:34] what you believe then. But Jesus bust
[43:35] that. He said the scribe and Pharisees
[43:37] they love their own. But you do better
[43:41] than that
[43:45] because they have their own doctrine. So
[43:47] they love one another. He said, "I want
[43:48] you as my disciples to love them that
[43:50] hate you."
[43:52] He said they have the reward with their
[43:54] internal love that they have. That's
[43:56] internal affairs. But the love that I
[43:58] want you to demonstrate is that all men
[44:00] will know that you are my disciples. All
[44:03] men might know that by what? How we
[44:05] live, how we act, what we do, how we
[44:09] serve one another, how we respect one
[44:11] another, how we honor one another, how
[44:13] we appreciate one another, how we
[44:16] encourage one another. Once upon a time,
[44:18] a
[44:19] man can't like you don't know me. I am
[44:22] your neighbor. You are my neighbor. Oh,
[44:24] give the Lord a shout in the house. I
[44:27] feel good
[44:28] tonight. All right, we going good.
[44:32] Almost done. All right. So, the prophet
[44:34] said that's a new heart, new spirit,
[44:37] then the Holy Spirit. Ezekiel 36, right?
[44:39] He says that somebody got a new heart.
[44:41] Sometime they they misinterpret the new
[44:43] spirit for the Holy Spirit. He said,
[44:45] "But the new spirit was given to work
[44:49] with the Holy Spirit because you can't
[44:52] go from new heart to Holy Spirit. You
[44:54] got to get a new spirit that could work
[44:56] along
[44:58] to operate with the Holy Ghost." Well, I
[45:01] am saying I'm putting it to you now that
[45:03] it will take brotherly love to work with
[45:06] the love of God.
[45:09] So, we have to be able to exercise the
[45:11] spirit of forgiveness. I I I believe in
[45:14] my heart there's no Christian person
[45:16] could ever walk through this Christian
[45:17] journey without saying I forgive you or
[45:19] forgive me. Something must be done
[45:21] something will be done to you and
[45:23] something you would have to have done
[45:25] that you could say forgive me. That have
[45:27] to come out your mouth because Jesus
[45:29] before he he he died he said father
[45:31] forgive them they know not what they do.
[45:33] Even Jesus himself had to express that
[45:34] forgiveness. Forgiveness have been an
[45:36] issue a long time. That is why they
[45:38] asked Jesus how much time big question
[45:40] shall I forgive my brother? And the man
[45:42] had a number. He says them dimes.
[45:45] They even put that in the ring by a
[45:46] punch. Jesus says seven. He said 70*
[45:49] seven. He was he kill it that you could
[45:52] hold against your brother because you
[45:53] have to forgive him 490 times. Not a
[45:56] month or a year, a day. And you could
[45:58] never outgrow that. So as he hurt you,
[46:00] you forgive. As he do that, you forgive.
[46:03] You're not doing that for you're showing
[46:05] that that God could see in your heart
[46:06] that spirit of forgiveness. And then
[46:08] when you could work with brotherly love
[46:09] to your brother, then the love of God
[46:12] could come upon you. So the nine
[46:15] ingredients of love which include
[46:17] patience, kindness, generosity,
[46:19] humility, courtesy, unselfish. This
[46:21] courtesy is to the world. You can't be a
[46:24] Christian and have no testimony outside.
[46:27] Everybody know he's the baddest man in
[46:28] town, the baddest woman around you like
[46:30] you're half crazy. That cannot be.
[46:33] Christianity have to be able to
[46:34] demonstrate itself publicly. There be no
[46:37] token displayed on the other side. Token
[46:39] on this side. Token displayed. The blood
[46:41] being applied. The spirit abide. Let
[46:43] that angel pass for other side. Other
[46:45] side. You're cool. You're at rest. Isn't
[46:48] that right? So no, no, no,
[46:51] no. Those tears won't be accepted. I'll
[46:53] be looking at the other side say no, no,
[46:54] no, no, no. I be looking now on you say,
[46:56] "No, no, no, no, no, no. Never show that
[46:58] love when I was alive. Now I dead. Look
[47:00] what you doing. want to pat
[47:02] my pat me cheek are dead I'm not there
[47:07] gone for glory so what I'm saying then
[47:10] what we have to do let's do it
[47:14] the worst thing to do is not to take
[47:16] action that's the worst thing it's a
[47:19] decision not to act I love action
[47:23] sometimes you do it and you get it right
[47:24] some of you get it wrong don't be
[47:26] embarrassed All right two more and I'm
[47:27] out of
[47:28] here but Brandham he said now when you
[47:31] stand praying is reading the scripture
[47:33] forgive if you are ought against any
[47:34] that your father which is in heaven may
[47:36] forgive you your trespasses but if you
[47:38] do not forgive neither will your father
[47:41] which is in heaven forgive your
[47:42] trespasses and this is the problem some
[47:44] people not only not forgiving you know
[47:46] they're not even forgiving themselves
[47:49] that's a big one is that because when
[47:52] you get the word applied to you and you
[47:54] know you did stuff all of us did stuff
[47:55] we bought this in you forget somebody
[47:58] forget
[47:59] [Music]
[48:00] Maybe some of you believe you're born of
[48:01] the Virgin Mary. But we all born in sin
[48:04] and shaping iniquity. We all have done
[48:07] stuff. So what I'm saying then God is
[48:10] saying these not the unbelievers. These
[48:12] not the sinners. These not for pan and
[48:13] marijuana smokers. This is the
[48:14] believers. When you stand praying,
[48:17] forgive. If you're coming to the altar
[48:19] and you recognize something against your
[48:21] brother, go back, get it right, and come
[48:25] back to the altar. Because if you come
[48:26] to the altar in that way, I'm not going
[48:28] to receive it. I'm not going to answer
[48:30] your prayer. So this connected with
[48:32] healing, deliverance, breakthrough, the
[48:33] transmission of your husband, your wife,
[48:35] your children, this connected to
[48:36] everything you could think about. This
[48:37] is it right here.
[48:40] Now, no 4 hour, 5 hour mystery preacher
[48:42] could escape this something by talking
[48:46] viol right now. This sermon right now,
[48:49] every every pulpit right now, we talk
[48:50] about the pope.
[48:52] I didn't come here for that this
[48:53] morning. He have his job to do and I
[48:55] have my job to do. We have our job to
[48:57] do. You understand what I'm saying? This
[48:59] is where the tire hits the road. There's
[49:02] a big mystery coming.
[49:05] Now, faith, Baron said, is based on
[49:07] forgiveness. Wait a minute. Real faith.
[49:11] Yes. Based on what? Shout it out. Faith
[49:15] is based on forgiveness. So when God
[49:18] sent a prophet to turn our hearts back
[49:19] to the faith of the fathers, it means he
[49:20] turning back to forgiveness.
[49:25] Now remember Mary was in the upper room
[49:27] not just be it done me according to thy
[49:28] word that's one part that be it done me
[49:31] according to thy word sister had to go
[49:33] in the upper room but said to overcome
[49:35] her pride of being Jesus mother
[49:40] so she might have see this Mary might
[49:41] have seen Mary
[49:44] Magdalene but in God eyes both Mary and
[49:46] Mary Magdalene is the same Mary no
[49:49] different in them sister know one is a
[49:50] higher one is a lower once is a sin
[49:52] wants us to sin a little bit. Go see
[49:56] that, you know, go see sinners blood.
[50:00] Go see transformation by his spirit. And
[50:02] once you understand that, you are free
[50:05] to love everyone, to treat everyone
[50:07] right. Do you understand what I'm
[50:10] saying? All right. So, faith is based on
[50:12] forgiveness. And then, as we said this
[50:15] morning, trying to get the church into a
[50:16] place where we could really see
[50:18] apostolic times moving among us is right
[50:20] at the door. We see it. We want to see
[50:22] more of it that it could flow out to
[50:25] others.
[50:27] And this is where you're going to get
[50:28] the message today. This is the last
[50:30] quote I have. You do real good. You
[50:32] can't say this dry. You know, if you
[50:34] don't have anointing here for this
[50:36] preacher half dead, you know. All right.
[50:38] So listen to he's praying. He said,
[50:40] "Heavenly Father, as we stand here, as
[50:43] many torches dying out in our hearts and
[50:45] the mystics of last year, we approaching
[50:47] the death of 1962 birth of 963. is the
[50:50] contest and leader. Talking about may
[50:52] there be a mighty Russian and so then he
[50:55] said this make us fit servants. Forgive
[50:57] our past. Bless our future. Guide us oh
[51:02] Lord with thy mighty hand Jehovah. Bless
[51:04] these ministers here. Bless all the
[51:06] lady, all the visitors. Be with us Lord.
[51:08] We are your servants that the power of
[51:10] your spirit might have the prayer
[51:12] ministers in our lives in our being.
[51:13] Help us God. Forgive us and help us. We
[51:16] pray. Raise up mighty men. Raise up
[51:19] mighty wires of the faith. Open this
[51:21] year Lord the hidden manner that rock
[51:24] beneath the rock that we might see the
[51:26] program of God. And then he pray this
[51:28] cap off the pyramid of our life.
[51:33] Lord put on the capstone Christ Jesus
[51:35] upon each and every one of us. May his
[51:37] great magnificent holy blessing be upon
[51:40] us all. May the fire of the Holy Ghost
[51:42] come upon us. May the power of
[51:43] resurrection be manifested. We are
[51:45] yours. We give ourselves holy to you.
[51:47] cap off the pyramid of our lives. Who
[51:49] knew what he was talking about? That
[51:51] there's a cap. He call it, Paul call it
[51:53] charity, the bond of perfectness. But
[51:56] I'm talking about all the virtues you
[51:57] could leak here in temperance, leak in
[51:58] patience. But when charity comes, it
[52:00] seals the whole thing in. Then you
[52:02] become a living moving monument. This is
[52:05] not fairy tale, fairy talk. When I 1975
[52:08] when I come to this message, I was
[52:09] absorbing every book I could find.
[52:10] Everything I got to find, I was ravaging
[52:13] us. Uh eating anything. And I saw the
[52:15] prophecies. It looked almost impossible,
[52:17] but after 50 plus years, it's not
[52:19] impossible. It is right in front of us.
[52:22] All the promises, the same God that
[52:24] prophesied they would take a pope out of
[52:26] America is the same God that promised
[52:28] dynamics to this bride, latter rain for
[52:30] this bride, power for this bride,
[52:32] adoption for the bride, men being placed
[52:34] on a pillar of fire veiled in the sons
[52:36] of God in the last days. God promised it
[52:38] that God can't lie. We have confidence
[52:40] and trust in him. So, brother Brandon,
[52:42] pray this prayer. about a black man. Cap
[52:44] off the pyramid of our lives. And this
[52:46] morning when you stand praying for
[52:48] charity, the cap forgives. Let's go
[52:51] straight in that table. This is the
[52:53] message I preached the Friday night in
[52:55] New Jersey there. Praise the Lord. We're
[52:56] going to go straight into it. And may
[52:58] God bless you and have a good time in
[52:59] the Lord. And when you leave here, be
[53:01] forgiving one another and giving each
[53:02] other roses. God bless you.
[53:11] He
[53:12] is my
[53:17] everything both great and
[53:25] small. He gave
[53:29] himself for
[53:31] me. He made everything new.
[53:40] He is my
[53:43] head. None other will
[53:46] do. None other will
[53:52] do.
[53:54] Wealth is my
[54:00] everything. He is my all.
[54:08] He is
[54:11] my
[54:15] everything both great and
[54:22] small. He gave
[54:26] himself for me.
[54:28] [Music]
[54:32] everything.
[54:35] [Music]
[54:36] You He is my
[54:42] everything. None other will do. None
[54:46] other
[54:47] way. He is my
[54:55] everything. God bless you. God bless
[54:58] you.
[55:07] Heat. Heat.
[55:12] [Music]
[55:14] [Applause]
[55:14] [Music]
[55:36] He
[55:37] is
[55:39] my
[55:43] [Music]
[55:44] everything that will
[55:50] Amen. Blessed be the name of the
[55:54] Lord. Uh you may be seated just for a
[55:59] minute. We welcome the
[56:04] minister. I just want to take this
[56:06] opportunity to greet everyone of
[56:10] you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[56:13] Christ. and the family. Nice to see
[56:17] you last Sunday. Nice to see
[56:20] you and your precious wife.
[56:25] Amen. God bless everyone of you, brother
[56:27] Adam. God bless you so much once again.
[56:31] Amen. You are all welcome in the house
[56:34] of God.
[56:37] And may God just richly bless you. I
[56:41] know you came to the house of God with
[56:43] an open cup or an empty
[56:49] cup praying Lord my cup.
[56:54] Amen. Amen. So this
[56:57] evening we are having a visiting
[57:01] minister brother from Headstone
[57:05] Tabernacle in Trinidad.
[57:11] ministering for us uh today and on
[57:15] Sunday
[57:17] and also the coming week we'll be having
[57:19] brother Jabz from Nigeria
[57:23] who will be ministering also for us and
[57:28] we have a number of other ministers that
[57:30] are coming our
[57:33] way and so uh we are thankful to God
[57:39] that uh we have sermons of God who can
[57:42] pass our
[57:44] way and just uh minister to us the word
[57:49] of God.
[57:52] It is always good to hear the word also
[57:54] from another servant of
[57:57] God because sometimes you may think it
[58:00] is just something local
[58:02] here but I believe this message has gone
[58:07] everywhere and God has his men and women
[58:14] everywhere serving him in the vineyard
[58:16] of God.
[58:19] So I want you to believe it that way. We
[58:21] are not the only
[58:23] ones. And once you hear somebody saying
[58:26] we are the only
[58:28] ones, this is a big
[58:30] problem. I believe the bride of the Lord
[58:33] Jesus Christ is a mystical
[58:37] body. Amen. We have the bride of the
[58:39] Lord Jesus part of it in United States.
[58:44] Amen. Part of it in every nation of
[58:47] Africa.
[58:50] I know many folks who are born here,
[58:52] they think Africa is a
[58:55] country. Africa is a
[58:58] continent. Many, many
[59:00] countries. I believe in every country.
[59:04] We have God's
[59:05] children. Amen. There is none of us who
[59:09] will have that opportunity
[59:12] uh to travel to every
[59:14] nation and to preach to every
[59:19] tongue. But God has men over there doing
[59:22] the
[59:23] same. The mystical body of Christ. So
[59:28] I'm not the only
[59:30] preacher. The minister who is coming is
[59:32] not the only one.
[59:34] We have so many servants of God who are
[59:38] working in the
[59:40] vineyard. But we are so thankful to God
[59:43] that we have a
[59:44] message. Amen. That is our plumb
[59:48] line.
[59:52] Amen. There is a plumbed line. Amen.
[59:55] There is a blueprint.
[59:58] So we are so
[59:59] thankful that God spoke to us in this
[1:00:03] evening
[1:00:05] time using Malachi 4 as he promised in
[1:00:09] the
[1:00:10] word. Amen. In the days of the voice of
[1:00:13] the seventh
[1:00:15] angel we are still in those days till
[1:00:19] Jesus
[1:00:20] comes. Amen. Amen. So with those few
[1:00:24] remarks, I would like us to have an
[1:00:27] amber time
[1:00:30] uh just to hear from
[1:00:32] God. Amen. Aren't you happy to be in the
[1:00:35] house of
[1:00:36] God? Why you also not blessed uh when
[1:00:39] brother Jonathan was
[1:00:42] here? Amen. We thank God. And uh we were
[1:00:46] not the only ones who were
[1:00:47] blessed but people all over the world
[1:00:50] that were able to tune
[1:00:54] in left messages they were
[1:00:57] also. Amen. So God is still
[1:01:01] blessing his children. So may God bless
[1:01:04] you and may God keep you. Uh we will
[1:01:08] stand up and just sing uh that little
[1:01:13] song and you can lead me. Get that mic.
[1:01:16] He's everything. Amen.
[1:01:19] The last song. He's everything. Amen. As
[1:01:22] we welcome the
[1:01:24] minister. Amen. He is my
[1:01:32] home. He is
[1:01:36] my
[1:01:40] everything both great and small.
[1:01:45] [Music]
[1:01:48] He gave
[1:01:51] himself for
[1:01:55] me. Everything
[1:02:05] [Music]
[1:02:11] new. Let's sing it again. He is my
[1:02:15] everything.
[1:02:17] He is
[1:02:20] [Music]
[1:02:37] my great and small. both
[1:02:41] great and
[1:02:45] small. He gave his life for me. He g his
[1:02:51] life for me. Made everything
[1:02:58] new. My Lord, my Lord, he is my
[1:03:02] everything. He is my everything.
[1:03:09] [Music]
[1:03:10] Now, how about
[1:03:14] you? Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:03:18] God bless you as a privilege to be here
[1:03:23] and meeting brother. I hope I pronounce
[1:03:25] it right.
[1:03:28] And um every place that I go
[1:03:31] to, I have an
[1:03:33] expectation that this may be the time,
[1:03:36] this may be the people, this may be the
[1:03:40] season. God promised to do
[1:03:42] it. I don't know where I don't know
[1:03:46] when, but I'm supposed to believe that
[1:03:49] it could happen tonight. Not because I
[1:03:52] am here, but because we are here. And
[1:03:55] where the twos and trees are gathered
[1:03:57] together, he's in our midst. So God
[1:04:00] bless you, my brother. May God bless
[1:04:02] your pastor and your wife and family
[1:04:03] church. We want to have like fellowship.
[1:04:06] Amen. Greetings once again from the
[1:04:09] Headstone
[1:04:11] Tabernacle. If you have your
[1:04:13] Bibles, I like you to Ephesians 4
[1:04:17] uh
[1:04:19] 29-32 and Mark
[1:04:21] 11 22- 26.
[1:04:25] So I'm going to read from Ephesians
[1:04:28] first.
[1:04:29] Ephesians 4
[1:04:32] verse 29.
[1:04:36] Let no corrupt communication proceed out
[1:04:38] of your mouth, but that which is good to
[1:04:40] the use of edifying, that it may
[1:04:44] minister grace unto the hearers.
[1:04:52] and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God,
[1:04:54] whereby ye are sealed unto the day of
[1:05:00] redemption. Let all bitterness and wrath
[1:05:03] and anger and clamor and evil speaking
[1:05:06] be put away from you with all
[1:05:12] malice. and be kind one to another,
[1:05:15] tenderhearted, forgiving one another,
[1:05:17] even as God for Christ's sake had
[1:05:19] forgiven you.
[1:05:25] And from Mark
[1:05:27] 11, we want to read verse
[1:05:31] 22. And this is uh Jesus when he cursed
[1:05:36] the fig tree,
[1:05:39] the tree was dried up.
[1:05:44] and and and and in verse 22.
[1:05:47] And Jesus answered said unto them, "Have
[1:05:50] faith in God."
[1:05:54] For verily I say unto you, that
[1:05:56] whosoever shall say unto this mountain,
[1:05:59] be thou removed, and be thou cast into
[1:06:01] the sea, and shall not doubt in his
[1:06:03] heart, he shall that but shall believe
[1:06:06] that those things which see shall come
[1:06:08] to pass, he shall have whatsoever he
[1:06:10] saith.
[1:06:19] Therefore, I say unto you, what things
[1:06:21] soever you desire when you pray, believe
[1:06:24] that you receive them, and you shall
[1:06:26] have them.
[1:06:32] And when you stand praying, forgive if
[1:06:35] you have ought against any, that your
[1:06:37] father also which is in heaven may
[1:06:39] forgive you your trespasses.
[1:06:50] Neither will your father which is in
[1:06:52] heaven forgive your trespasses.
[1:06:59] Let's bow his hold of prayer. Heavenly
[1:07:02] Father, we thank you Lord for this group
[1:07:05] this church for the pastor and the
[1:07:08] believers here. And I pray you take me
[1:07:11] out of the way
[1:07:13] tonight. Lord, I love the song that was
[1:07:15] sang tonight.
[1:07:18] I am so needy, Lord.
[1:07:20] so needy of you. Help us tonight,
[1:07:23] Father. Take me out of the way. Speak
[1:07:26] lift to air to your
[1:07:28] people. May the pillar of fire rest on
[1:07:31] my
[1:07:32] shoulder. Speak direct to your people
[1:07:35] tonight. May the anointing come down.
[1:07:38] Break every yoke. Break every fear. Heal
[1:07:41] the sick in our midst and confirm your
[1:07:44] word. Signs, wonders, and
[1:07:47] miracles. We ask in Jesus name.
[1:07:50] Amen. You may be seated. Oh, praise God.
[1:07:54] Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the
[1:07:56] Lord. What a fine atmosphere here
[1:07:58] tonight.
[1:08:00] Amen. Praise God. So I have a title.
[1:08:04] When you stand praying for charity,
[1:08:08] forgive. Now remember,
[1:08:11] charity never fail it.
[1:08:15] We need to get to there.
[1:08:17] That is the target.
[1:08:20] That is the goal. Other subject
[1:08:23] brotherly
[1:08:24] kindness as a sign of maturity or
[1:08:28] ripeness.
[1:08:34] Another
[1:08:36] inspiration, the bride's perfect
[1:08:38] standing by the blood.
[1:08:44] Okay, let's go. In the amplified
[1:08:47] the scripture we read from Ephesians, it
[1:08:51] said, "No, let no foul
[1:08:54] language or wordless
[1:08:58] talk ever come out your mouth, but your
[1:09:02] speech should be good and spiritual
[1:09:07] for the spiritual progress of
[1:09:10] others. Do not grieve the Holy Spirit.
[1:09:14] Let all bitterness,
[1:09:17] rage, passion. Now listen, Paul is not
[1:09:22] talking to
[1:09:24] unbelievers. He's talking to church
[1:09:26] folks. He's talking to church people
[1:09:29] that they have to put away these
[1:09:31] things. So he knew
[1:09:33] exactly that they had these things
[1:09:36] because it's one thing to come out of
[1:09:39] Egypt,
[1:09:41] but it's another thing for Egypt to come
[1:09:42] out of you.
[1:09:46] Israel came out of
[1:09:47] Egypt. That was not the
[1:09:50] issue. The issue was Egypt that was
[1:09:52] inside of
[1:09:54] them. Oh, praise God. So Jesus when he
[1:09:59] prayed the prayer our father
[1:10:01] prayer. He said lead us not into
[1:10:03] temptation
[1:10:05] for deliver us from
[1:10:07] evil. And then he said for if you
[1:10:10] forgive
[1:10:12] people if you don't for if you forgive
[1:10:14] if you for if you forgive people their
[1:10:16] trespasses
[1:10:19] and giving up
[1:10:22] resentment in other words you have to
[1:10:23] let it
[1:10:25] go. This word
[1:10:28] resentment is a feeling of angry
[1:10:33] displeasure at something regarded as
[1:10:38] wrong. It's a feeling of
[1:10:42] anger,
[1:10:43] frustration, and
[1:10:45] bitterness build up over
[1:10:49] time. And that's the
[1:10:51] enemy putting this one against that one.
[1:10:55] anger creep
[1:10:57] in. And brother Brandham said, "Don't
[1:11:00] ever let that spirit of bitterness get
[1:11:02] to you
[1:11:05] because it will grieve the Holy Spirit.
[1:11:08] It could even grieve the Holy Spirit
[1:11:09] from the
[1:11:10] church and you'll see where I get
[1:11:13] tonight." So
[1:11:15] forgiveness is to release
[1:11:18] people. It's like the
[1:11:22] creditor saying, "It's
[1:11:25] okay. I cancel your debt. You don't owe
[1:11:29] me
[1:11:30] anything. Even though you did me
[1:11:32] wrong, I forgive you. And I personally
[1:11:37] believe that God will not allow any
[1:11:40] Christian to walk this earth without
[1:11:43] saying, "Forgive me." Oh, I forgive you.
[1:11:48] Hallelujah.
[1:11:50] Hallelujah.
[1:11:51] So forgiveness
[1:11:54] can be expressed
[1:11:56] by stating that you will not remember.
[1:12:00] You will not take into account the
[1:12:01] personal offense.
[1:12:05] Forgiveness demonstrates compassion. And
[1:12:09] the book of
[1:12:10] Jude was what what what Jude said and of
[1:12:14] some have compassion
[1:12:16] making a difference.
[1:12:18] between brute
[1:12:20] beasts and people who are feeling the
[1:12:23] flesh. Their brothers and sisters will
[1:12:27] be under struggle but they love the Lord
[1:12:30] and of some have compassion. And
[1:12:34] there'll be those that are
[1:12:35] arrogant. They don't care. That's a
[1:12:38] different thing. But we are called to
[1:12:41] have compassion because Jesus, he lived
[1:12:45] that. He demonstrated that.
[1:12:48] He saw that. Oh, praise the name of the
[1:12:50] Lord. So this word
[1:12:53] forgiveness, true forgiveness, it come
[1:12:56] like something
[1:12:57] physical, to remove over
[1:12:59] someone, to lift up someone to pass over
[1:13:03] what they did to cover, to
[1:13:08] atone, to
[1:13:09] clean or to make
[1:13:12] whole. Note the woman called in a very
[1:13:15] acty
[1:13:18] She on Facebook. She on WhatsApp. She on
[1:13:21] whatever. Everybody know what she did.
[1:13:24] They come to Jesus. They said, "Moses
[1:13:27] say we have a quote for
[1:13:30] it. We have a quote. We have a
[1:13:32] quote. Moses say she should be stoned."
[1:13:36] Jesus said, "No problem." Hallelujah.
[1:13:39] Glory. Hallelujah. But before your
[1:13:42] stone, before you do what you want to
[1:13:45] do, which one of you without sin, cast a
[1:13:49] full stone. And Jesus did not want to
[1:13:53] embarrass them. Jesus turn his back to
[1:13:57] them. Hallelujah.
[1:14:00] He knew beyond the flesh.
[1:14:03] He knew beyond the spirit, he knew what
[1:14:07] was in them. And he give them the
[1:14:09] opportunity.
[1:14:11] to walk away with excuses one by one.
[1:14:16] The woman was there
[1:14:18] ashamed. The woman was
[1:14:21] there, eyes closed. And when Jesus
[1:14:25] called
[1:14:26] her, where are the thy
[1:14:28] accusers? Because if there's no
[1:14:31] accusers, there's no case. Oh, give the
[1:14:34] Lord a praise.
[1:14:36] Hallelujah.
[1:14:38] If if there are no accusers,
[1:14:43] there is no case then you are free.
[1:14:47] Oh, glory to God. Glory to God. Just li
[1:14:52] I am free. Oh, you are free. And who the
[1:14:55] son of man set free is free
[1:14:59] indeed. The Lord shout.
[1:15:04] This is Jesus. This is not a pastor or
[1:15:08] evangelist or an apostle. This is Jesus.
[1:15:11] Asked the woman, "Where are your
[1:15:14] accusers?" She said, "None, none. I
[1:15:16] ain't see nothing." He said, "Neither do
[1:15:18] I condemn.
[1:15:24] Go and sin no more. You are better than
[1:15:29] that. You are higher than that. God
[1:15:32] didn't grace us.
[1:15:35] Not just above the
[1:15:37] animals. God put us a little lower than
[1:15:41] the
[1:15:41] [Music]
[1:15:43] angels. Come back to me. Hallelujah. You
[1:15:46] are called to be a little lower than the
[1:15:49] angels.
[1:15:50] Glory to God. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:15:54] Amen. So this this is how God sees
[1:15:58] things.
[1:15:59] So
[1:16:00] tonight, I want you to push your feeling
[1:16:03] aside, your own thoughts about yourself
[1:16:06] aside. I want you to shift your past
[1:16:10] aside and listen to what God is
[1:16:13] saying by his word. Psalms
[1:16:18] 103 from verse 8.
[1:16:21] This is the psalm. The Lord is merciful
[1:16:24] and gracious, slow to anger and
[1:16:28] plenteous in
[1:16:30] mercy. This is just speaking. This is
[1:16:34] not
[1:16:36] evangelism. This is the Lord is
[1:16:39] merciful and gracious. You see, I I'll
[1:16:43] share something with you.
[1:16:46] Um we don't preach against ministers and
[1:16:48] pastors
[1:16:50] and my church the church back home we
[1:16:54] keep them away from a lot of confusion a
[1:16:55] lot of
[1:16:58] foolishness I don't know who God will
[1:17:06] use because when if we want to pick
[1:17:09] disciples
[1:17:11] you pick your
[1:17:14] cousin your Brother, that's how you
[1:17:17] would
[1:17:18] pick. But Jesus didn't pick like that.
[1:17:21] Jesus choose
[1:17:23] Peter and he choose Matthew, but Matthew
[1:17:26] was a tax
[1:17:28] collector. They didn't like him. Nobody
[1:17:31] likes the tax
[1:17:33] collector.
[1:17:35] Matthew, you can't tell
[1:17:38] Jesus who to
[1:17:40] choose who to use.
[1:17:43] You can't tell Jesus that.
[1:17:45] He called this one. He called that one.
[1:17:48] He called that one. This one don't like
[1:17:50] this one. This one can't stand that one.
[1:17:55] But they're in church. And Jesus said,
[1:17:58] "Turn around and preach your brother."
[1:18:01] And when you turn
[1:18:03] around, match you behind you. This one
[1:18:06] behind you. He wasn't looking for that.
[1:18:09] He wasn't expecting that. And you pulled
[1:18:12] back your hand. Jesus see you. He said
[1:18:16] turn around and greet your
[1:18:18] daughter. Turn around and greet that
[1:18:22] sister and greet that brother.
[1:18:25] Hallelujah. Because Jesus called him and
[1:18:30] Jesus called you. Give the Lord a
[1:18:34] praise. He said you have not chosen
[1:18:38] me but I have chosen you. Oh, give the
[1:18:42] Lord some shouts. And if God has chosen
[1:18:46] you, you have a right to
[1:18:49] shout, you have a right to praise God.
[1:18:53] Amen.
[1:18:54] Listen, the Lord is
[1:18:57] merciful and gracious, slow to
[1:19:01] anger, lend us in
[1:19:03] mercy. He will not always
[1:19:07] chide or keep his anger forever.
[1:19:11] He has not dealt with
[1:19:14] us after our
[1:19:16] sins, nor rewarded us according to our
[1:19:21] iniquities. For as the heaven is high
[1:19:23] above the
[1:19:24] earth, so great is his mercy, the west
[1:19:28] that fear him. as far as the east is
[1:19:32] from the
[1:19:34] west. So
[1:19:35] far he remove our transgression from
[1:19:39] us. Like as a father beatth his
[1:19:43] children, so the Lord beat them
[1:19:47] that for he knoweth our
[1:19:50] frame and he remember we are
[1:19:52] dust. Oh give the Lord some praises
[1:19:55] tonight. Oh glory to God. When we finish
[1:20:01] Tonight you will see is like a sin,
[1:20:06] the
[1:20:08] whole
[1:20:11] grudge, the whole
[1:20:13] resentment, the whole
[1:20:17] animosities because the person you have
[1:20:18] a
[1:20:20] against you are tied to
[1:20:23] them like like
[1:20:26] Spider-Man a string go
[1:20:30] You hate this one here. You have a
[1:20:31] string tied
[1:20:33] there. You can't forgive your
[1:20:35] father. You can't forgive your wife. You
[1:20:39] can't forgive your daughter or your
[1:20:41] son because he did this and he did that.
[1:20:44] And when you have 10 people, you have 10
[1:20:47] strings. And when you start to forgive,
[1:20:50] try to cut them. Cut the string. Cuz
[1:20:54] these things have your bone.
[1:20:57] things have you
[1:20:58] heavy you can't go far with
[1:21:01] that that's why Jesus said pray but
[1:21:05] before you pray when you stand praying
[1:21:08] you have to forgive you know what Jesus
[1:21:11] did he give the third pull
[1:21:14] first the third
[1:21:18] pull your third pull
[1:21:21] first if you shall see to the
[1:21:25] mountain then he give the Second
[1:21:27] pull. When you
[1:21:29] pray, then he get the first
[1:21:31] pull. When you pray, if you have
[1:21:36] forgive because if you don't forgive,
[1:21:39] you will not be forgiven.
[1:21:44] And if you're not forgiven, it means you
[1:21:46] are in condemnation.
[1:21:51] And the prophet said, you're hanging
[1:21:53] over hell.
[1:21:56] If you don't forgive, one tread.
[1:22:00] Hallelujah. You would fall into hell
[1:22:03] without forgiveness. I'm going to prove
[1:22:05] it to you that Jesus before he hit the
[1:22:10] resurrection at the cross, he said,
[1:22:13] "Father, forgive them for they know not
[1:22:16] what they do." Even Jesus had to express
[1:22:20] forgiveness to those
[1:22:24] rascals that was saying crucify him.
[1:22:27] Crucify him. Oh, give the Lord some
[1:22:30] praises.
[1:22:32] Hallelujah.
[1:22:34] Glory. Let's go,
[1:22:37] brother.
[1:22:38] And this is this is a key here for me,
[1:22:42] friends.
[1:22:43] There are so many things we could say
[1:22:45] tonight about the perfection
[1:22:49] and we are always trying to gouch the
[1:22:51] eyes of somebody
[1:22:53] else to make ourselves a little holier
[1:22:56] than they
[1:22:57] are. But if we look at the
[1:23:00] picture, it's only God's
[1:23:03] grace that we are what we
[1:23:06] are here. Sometime in Ohio,
[1:23:10] I learned a lesson the hard
[1:23:13] way and I'm going to summarize this and
[1:23:15] just jump a bit.
[1:23:17] Right. I went into a a restaurant to eat
[1:23:22] and I saw the slot machine
[1:23:25] going around the slot
[1:23:27] machine and then he saw the condition
[1:23:29] wrong in the in the
[1:23:31] restaurant and he thought, "Oh god, how
[1:23:35] can you stand it?
[1:23:38] I looked over to my right. I heard
[1:23:41] someone make out a big
[1:23:43] groanto and there set a
[1:23:46] woman about 60 years with vulgar
[1:23:51] clothes, little pair of
[1:23:53] sandals, purple fingernails
[1:23:58] painted stuck there. I said, God, why
[1:24:03] don't you destroy the whole thing?
[1:24:06] Why don't you just sink it beneath the
[1:24:08] earth?
[1:24:10] I said, "Is my little Sarah and Rebecca
[1:24:12] going to have to grow under such
[1:24:14] stuff?" Why do you send an earthquake
[1:24:16] and sink
[1:24:18] it? This is his
[1:24:20] thoughts. And as I was standing there
[1:24:23] condemning the
[1:24:24] woman, I stepped back behind the
[1:24:28] door. I felt the spirit of
[1:24:31] God come to me and I stepped behind the
[1:24:36] door and I see something swirling,
[1:24:40] a vision. It was the world turning
[1:24:43] around and
[1:24:45] around and I noticed around the world
[1:24:48] was a scarlet
[1:24:53] streak. I seen
[1:24:56] myself a little boy doing things that I
[1:25:00] ought not to
[1:25:01] do. And every time I did
[1:25:04] anything, I seen a great black
[1:25:07] shadow go towards
[1:25:10] heaven when God would have killed me at
[1:25:12] that
[1:25:13] minute. Then I see standing between me
[1:25:16] and
[1:25:17] God that perfect
[1:25:19] sacrifice. I see him standing there with
[1:25:23] the thorns on his
[1:25:24] head and every time my sins would start
[1:25:27] towards
[1:25:28] God, he would reach out and catch it
[1:25:33] like a bumper on the
[1:25:36] car. He was protecting me from
[1:25:41] death. And every time I do something
[1:25:43] wrong, God would have killed me. His
[1:25:47] holiness required it.
[1:25:49] But the blood of Jesus act like a
[1:25:53] bumper as I stood
[1:25:56] looking. I got a little closer to him
[1:25:59] and I noticed him. I could hear him say,
[1:26:03] "Father, forgive him. He doesn't know
[1:26:06] what he's
[1:26:07] doing." And I looked down and there laid
[1:26:11] a
[1:26:12] book. And there's a recording
[1:26:15] angel standing by his side. And every
[1:26:19] time I sinned, it was put on in the book
[1:26:23] and my name was on it. And I realized
[1:26:28] that someday that blood streak would be
[1:26:33] lifted and I have to stand in the
[1:26:36] presence of
[1:26:36] God with my sinful life. I've seen his
[1:26:41] mercy was holding off
[1:26:44] judgment. I went to him humbly.
[1:26:47] I went on my knees. I said, "Jesus, now
[1:26:51] son of God, I'm unworthy to come in your
[1:26:53] presence, will you please forgive me for
[1:26:56] what I have done?" He touched his
[1:26:59] side with his hand. He took the old book
[1:27:03] and wrote,
[1:27:04] "Pardoned and threw it behind him and my
[1:27:08] sins were gone."
[1:27:13] Then
[1:27:14] listen, he looked me stern in the face.
[1:27:21] He said, "Now, I have forgiven you, but
[1:27:25] you want to condemn
[1:27:28] her." Then the prophet said, "Then I
[1:27:31] seen what it
[1:27:33] mean." I come out of the vision. I walk
[1:27:36] over to her. I said, "How do you do?"
[1:27:40] She was drinking. I said, "Could I sit
[1:27:42] down?" She said, "I have company." I
[1:27:45] said, "I don't mean that that way,
[1:27:46] lady."
[1:27:48] I said,
[1:27:49] "Lady, a few minutes ago, standing
[1:27:52] behind the door." And I begin to tell
[1:27:55] her, and then the tears begin to run her
[1:27:59] cheeks. She said,
[1:28:01] "Lady, I you don't mean to do those
[1:28:04] things. Jesus died. The judgments of God
[1:28:07] is held off.
[1:28:10] She said no sir my father was a deacon
[1:28:13] in the church I was a
[1:28:16] Christian she tell me after his
[1:28:19] death is her husband I believe she had
[1:28:22] two young girls that went
[1:28:24] astray and the girls left
[1:28:27] her and she threw her life
[1:28:30] away she thought there was no more hope
[1:28:33] for her and I said God be
[1:28:37] merciful those who we
[1:28:41] forew he has called. She said, "Are you
[1:28:44] Reverend Brandham from down
[1:28:46] there?" I said, "I am." She said, "I'm
[1:28:49] ashamed of
[1:28:52] myself. Do you think there's a chance
[1:28:54] for me?" I said, "Jesus has his arms
[1:28:58] stretched
[1:28:59] out, waiting for you to come." I took
[1:29:03] her by the hand. I said, "Would you
[1:29:05] kneel here with me on the
[1:29:07] floor and
[1:29:09] there in the floor?" We broke up that
[1:29:12] place and had an oldfashioned meeting.
[1:29:16] And that woman is living a Christian
[1:29:18] life
[1:29:20] tonight. Now
[1:29:22] listen, I'm almost done with this here.
[1:29:25] He says, "God requires
[1:29:28] perfection. He requires your
[1:29:31] repentance. He requires your loyalty to
[1:29:34] God.
[1:29:35] And he is looking
[1:29:37] tonight. Here we go.
[1:29:39] Listen. No matter how much you have
[1:29:41] sinned,
[1:29:43] how little or how much, you are still a
[1:29:47] sinner.
[1:29:50] You know, people want to measure sin.
[1:29:51] You know, my sin smaller
[1:29:55] [Music]
[1:29:57] than it have a a measurement for sin.
[1:30:06] But you still
[1:30:07] sin. So watch. He said he requires your
[1:30:11] loyalty to
[1:30:12] him. No matter how much you have sin,
[1:30:15] how little or how
[1:30:16] much you are still a sinner and cannot
[1:30:20] get in no other way. But by Jesus
[1:30:23] Christ, God all sufficient
[1:30:27] sacrifice. It is not turning a new page.
[1:30:32] It's a confession of your
[1:30:35] wrong and God's grace to
[1:30:37] you that brings you to perfection.
[1:30:41] And I will say back what I said in front
[1:30:43] what brother Ram says. If we only look
[1:30:46] at the picture is only by God's grace.
[1:30:50] We are what we are. Oh, praise God. Only
[1:30:53] by God's grace. Hallelujah. I am
[1:30:57] standing here by the grace of God.
[1:30:59] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:31:04] The bride is going to have a
[1:31:05] revival. Dynamics is going to strike the
[1:31:08] church. The power of God going to come
[1:31:11] forth. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Nothing
[1:31:14] will stop it. No president, no
[1:31:18] government, no be system,
[1:31:22] no
[1:31:22] antichrist, nothing going to stop it.
[1:31:25] Hallelujah. God said, "My word shall not
[1:31:30] return to me
[1:31:31] void." And God sent a prophet to reveal
[1:31:35] the whole mystery of God for the rapture
[1:31:38] of the church. Hallelujah. Every
[1:31:41] mystery has been revealed. Not another
[1:31:45] man to come back. I don't have no next
[1:31:47] man. They don't have an man. Malachi 4
[1:31:52] plus doesn't have that. The Holy Ghost
[1:31:55] alone is the
[1:31:57] revealer of the revelation of Jesus
[1:32:00] Christ. The Holy Ghost
[1:32:03] alone, glory,
[1:32:05] hallelujah, fear God tonight.
[1:32:08] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost
[1:32:11] alone. May be
[1:32:13] seated. That is why the devil in the
[1:32:18] message. The devil in the message fights
[1:32:22] worship, fights the
[1:32:24] atmosphere, fight the anointing. Because
[1:32:27] if you're
[1:32:28] sick, dead in church, you're only
[1:32:32] getting
[1:32:33] information. But if you get in the
[1:32:35] spirit, you will get
[1:32:38] revelation. Give the Lord some
[1:32:41] praises. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:32:45] Now revelation and information is not
[1:32:48] the same thing. The word is water but
[1:32:53] revelation is wine. You lick your lips.
[1:32:56] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Tasting
[1:33:00] good tasting
[1:33:02] good. Wine brings a
[1:33:05] stimulation. Wine make you
[1:33:08] jump. Wine make you stand up. Fine. Make
[1:33:14] you raise your hand. Why do
[1:33:17] that with water? You could sit and
[1:33:20] watch. You could shake a little
[1:33:23] head. That is water. But when wine hit
[1:33:26] you, you have to do something. You have
[1:33:30] to do something. Oh, glory to God. But
[1:33:34] Jesus, he turned the water
[1:33:42] into
[1:33:44] glory.
[1:33:47] Glory.
[1:33:49] Glory.
[1:33:50] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:33:56] You may be seated.
[1:34:01] The disciples follow Jesus three and a
[1:34:05] half
[1:34:06] years. One day Jesus turned to them say
[1:34:09] who do men say I am and there are some
[1:34:12] people like to talk about
[1:34:15] other say you are
[1:34:18] this that I have a book of all what they
[1:34:21] say
[1:34:23] about you say okay amen now tell me
[1:34:28] you're following for so long
[1:34:31] who do you say I am that come individual
[1:34:35] individual come to a personal
[1:34:37] and they were
[1:34:39] stunned. They following a man and they
[1:34:42] don't know who that is. They're
[1:34:44] following a message and they don't know
[1:34:46] what the message is. They're following a
[1:34:49] revelation. They don't even know what
[1:34:50] the revelation is. They're following.
[1:34:53] And brother Peter all of a sudden he
[1:34:56] said the
[1:34:58] Christ the son of the living
[1:35:00] God Jesus
[1:35:03] responded flesh and
[1:35:06] blood you didn't get that by facts you
[1:35:09] didn't get it by
[1:35:11] WhatsApp text that to you didn't read it
[1:35:14] in a book your father my father the
[1:35:19] spirit the lord the anointing
[1:35:23] reveal that to you and upon this rock,
[1:35:27] this rock, this revelation, I will build
[1:35:31] my church and the gates of
[1:35:34] hell challenge it and the capital
[1:35:38] against a rock. Jesus said that. Oh,
[1:35:42] glory to God. Jesus said that question.
[1:35:46] Let me tease you a little bit.
[1:35:50] The other
[1:35:53] brethren heard Peter
[1:35:55] said, "Thou the Christ."
[1:35:58] So all the brothers saying, "Thou art
[1:35:59] the Christ." Thou art the Christ. Was
[1:36:02] that a revelation? No. No. They're
[1:36:05] saying what Peter say.
[1:36:10] That's not revelation. That is
[1:36:12] repetition.
[1:36:16] In other words, just as Peter got it,
[1:36:19] Each one of them had to get the same
[1:36:21] way. You have to hear from heaven. That
[1:36:24] is why you have to fight to get in the
[1:36:27] spirit. The pastor is not the
[1:36:30] revealer. The Holy Ghost is the
[1:36:33] revealer. Pastor brings the word, but
[1:36:36] the Holy Ghost reveals it.
[1:36:38] And once the word come out of his mouth,
[1:36:41] Holy Spirit drop down, reveal it to you,
[1:36:44] that's the rock the devil can take.
[1:36:47] Oh, glory to God. This is what the devil
[1:36:50] can't take
[1:36:51] out. So when Peter was about to slip,
[1:36:55] Jesus told him, "The devil want to sift
[1:36:58] you like
[1:37:00] wheat. But I pray for you." Watch. Watch
[1:37:03] what he prayed for. That your faith
[1:37:05] don't
[1:37:07] fail. Many of us want God to take us out
[1:37:10] of the
[1:37:11] problem. Stop praying that. Stop that.
[1:37:15] Say God, take me
[1:37:17] through out true stop asking
[1:37:22] God take you
[1:37:24] out. Ask God to take you
[1:37:28] through it all. I learn to trust in
[1:37:33] Jesus. I learn to trust in God. When you
[1:37:36] go through it, it means something.
[1:37:40] Hallelujah. It gives you something.
[1:37:43] You learn something because you have
[1:37:46] been through it.
[1:37:48] Give the Lord a
[1:37:49] shout.
[1:37:51] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:37:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The
[1:37:58] Bible said, I call you young
[1:38:02] men because you're feeling
[1:38:04] strong. Don't say that. It's I call you
[1:38:07] young men because you are strong. You
[1:38:11] have to believe that God is with you to
[1:38:14] give you strength. The Bible said let
[1:38:17] the weak
[1:38:18] say I am strong. The devil say let the
[1:38:21] weak say God so weak and
[1:38:25] say weak say come on how weak you are. I
[1:38:30] know it. Nobody understand what you're
[1:38:33] going through. I know your struggles.
[1:38:36] Tell the devil he's a liar. You are not
[1:38:40] weak. No, you are not weak. You are more
[1:38:43] than able to hate in your
[1:38:46] soul. Already put something in you. Who
[1:38:49] he call you, he already called. And who
[1:38:54] he call who he call be justified. Give
[1:38:58] the Lord a show.
[1:39:00] [Laughter]
[1:39:10] season. This thing will take you
[1:39:12] completely out of church. Some people,
[1:39:15] some people love church.
[1:39:18] They just want to be in
[1:39:20] church this year. This making you come
[1:39:24] right up to see what God
[1:39:26] says. Listen to this. Who he
[1:39:30] knew or who he knew
[1:39:33] before he called. So the woman at the
[1:39:37] well, woman at the
[1:39:40] well, he was waiting for her. He sent
[1:39:44] his disciples away.
[1:39:47] Her name was on the book. She did not
[1:39:50] know that he was the book.
[1:39:53] He knew her name.
[1:39:57] [Applause]
[1:39:58] So regardless of what anybody think
[1:40:00] about her,
[1:40:03] he had nothing to do with that.
[1:40:07] So when Jesus said go call your husband
[1:40:09] and she said I have none. He said but he
[1:40:12] had five and the one you have now is not
[1:40:15] yours. Jesus didn't say
[1:40:21] five. That was not Jesus
[1:40:23] reaction. He was not in the five and the
[1:40:26] 10 and the
[1:40:27] 20. He was in the seed in the
[1:40:31] soul. He went beyond the flesh.
[1:40:34] He went down on a spirit and he saw
[1:40:37] something inside of there. Do you know
[1:40:40] what's inside of you? Do you know what's
[1:40:42] inside of you tonight? Do you know God
[1:40:45] put something inside of you? The devil
[1:40:48] didn't put it. God put it. God made a
[1:40:52] way. Oh, glory to
[1:40:55] God. Help me, Jesus.
[1:40:59] Let me try to continue here. I'm just
[1:41:01] going off track.
[1:41:03] Brother,
[1:41:05] he
[1:41:10] says, "The other night I made a
[1:41:12] statement at the
[1:41:15] pullpit that I would rather see
[1:41:17] brotherly love existing among the
[1:41:20] church if we didn't have one case of
[1:41:24] healing. We must know what these things
[1:41:27] are
[1:41:29] for." That's where the church is today.
[1:41:33] They have lost their brotherly
[1:41:35] love. They have lost the feeling for one
[1:41:40] another. I preach in some church. I tell
[1:41:44] them there is no press
[1:41:47] coming
[1:41:49] yet because the devil is in the
[1:41:52] church and if your church there no need
[1:41:54] to press
[1:41:56] it. When the press come down triple
[1:42:00] then. Yeah.
[1:42:02] But if the devil inside the church,
[1:42:05] there's no need to send anything to
[1:42:06] close the church
[1:42:07] down. When we give him the
[1:42:10] boots, when we kick him out, when we
[1:42:13] boot him out, when we forgive one
[1:42:16] another, when we when we the honey
[1:42:19] sticks back to
[1:42:21] back, back to back, the devil can come
[1:42:25] between that. That is how we have to
[1:42:28] become. And when that honey
[1:42:32] That spirit of forgiveness,
[1:42:35] fight the church, then the devil will
[1:42:37] move
[1:42:39] outside, close us
[1:42:41] down, loving kindness is a sign of
[1:42:46] maturity, of
[1:42:48] rightness. Kindness is what break us out
[1:42:51] to number
[1:42:53] six. We could express God's kindness,
[1:42:58] the father's kindness.
[1:43:01] Oh, blessed be of the Lord. This is a
[1:43:04] powerful thing. You know, this
[1:43:06] forgiveness thing, the prodical son.
[1:43:10] I mean, that's a young man asked for his
[1:43:13] money. He's gone for our
[1:43:15] country, has all his money, we know the
[1:43:18] story. I don't
[1:43:19] have here's the part I want to get to.
[1:43:23] His father keep looking out for him.
[1:43:28] You know, father know the son does walk
[1:43:29] and daughter does
[1:43:31] walk. So way in the
[1:43:33] distance see coming. He's coming. He
[1:43:35] coming. Prepare the fatted
[1:43:38] car. That's my son coming
[1:43:40] back. His years he going
[1:43:43] away. He coming back. That son, he was
[1:43:47] making style with his
[1:43:49] money, flashy
[1:43:51] cars, pay for food, friends, but the
[1:43:55] money ran out.
[1:43:57] And then he was going to this house,
[1:44:03] a
[1:44:04] nice miso blush, a nice white house. And
[1:44:09] his friends think that is his house.
[1:44:13] But he was living in the pen behind the
[1:44:19] house. He's living there. He's not
[1:44:23] there. He's behind.
[1:44:26] with pigs. And one day, I love this
[1:44:30] part, he came to himself.
[1:44:34] And you see when you messed up, you see
[1:44:37] when your mind messed up at some point
[1:44:39] in time,
[1:44:41] maybe tonight, you could come to
[1:44:44] yourself. He came to himself. He said, I
[1:44:48] would
[1:44:49] arise. I will go to my father.
[1:44:53] I will say he's rehearsing.
[1:44:55] I will say, "Father, forgive me. Make me
[1:44:58] a servant, but once a son,
[1:45:02] always a son." Give the Lord some
[1:45:05] praises. Give the Lord some praises.
[1:45:08] He wanted to be a
[1:45:10] servant in his father's house, but he
[1:45:14] was a son. Note that big brother never
[1:45:19] miss a service.
[1:45:21] That big brother never spend a bad
[1:45:24] scent. He always was there. When he
[1:45:28] heard the rejoicing, you say what's
[1:45:31] going on there? They say, "Brother, come
[1:45:33] back." You see that rascal, that man,
[1:45:36] come back and what they doing? You say
[1:45:40] man that fatted
[1:45:41] calf that he was that he was feeding all
[1:45:45] the
[1:45:46] time kill it and they serving it. That
[1:45:50] son said I'm not coming
[1:45:52] inside all the time. He's precious
[1:45:54] brother
[1:45:56] this precious brother that but his
[1:46:00] brother came back and brother this
[1:46:02] brother this have a fight
[1:46:05] now. His
[1:46:08] father
[1:46:12] over
[1:46:15] beef
[1:46:17] upset. Your brother was lost. Come back
[1:46:21] home. That plate of food giving you such
[1:46:25] a
[1:46:26] fight. Son, all what I have is yours.
[1:46:32] Amen.
[1:46:36] We have and I want to challenge you
[1:46:39] tonight.
[1:46:40] Begin to truly believe what God said
[1:46:43] about you in the word.
[1:46:48] Tell yourself your feelings lying.
[1:46:49] You're thinking, your thoughts is is
[1:46:53] off what God is
[1:46:58] saying. We need love and
[1:47:00] respect for God and is for his people.
[1:47:05] No matter what denomination they belong
[1:47:08] to, we are
[1:47:10] brothers. We need a love for one
[1:47:12] another.
[1:47:15] Hallelujah. Hear a saying this now. The
[1:47:18] first thing that Pentecost produced
[1:47:21] was brotherly
[1:47:22] love. Very first
[1:47:24] thing. So
[1:47:26] Jesus when he went and washed their feet
[1:47:28] and so
[1:47:30] on, he say what I do, you don't
[1:47:32] understand.
[1:47:33] I'm your master
[1:47:36] and I'm washing your feet. He
[1:47:38] demonstrated this thing. He said, I want
[1:47:41] you to do that to each other.
[1:47:43] By this shall all men
[1:47:45] know that you are my
[1:47:47] disciples. I don't want a new
[1:47:50] Jesus. I want the same Jesus that I read
[1:47:54] in the Bible. I want that same
[1:47:56] Jesus to meet, to deal with, to speak.
[1:48:01] The message have a different kind of
[1:48:05] Jesus. I hear brothers say
[1:48:08] this one is
[1:48:11] shock. This one is
[1:48:13] finished says who? There's a man mouth
[1:48:18] talking. They don't have a
[1:48:20] heaven and they don't have a hell. No
[1:48:23] man could keep you out the
[1:48:26] kingdom. The kingdom is preached and
[1:48:30] every man press their way into it.
[1:48:34] And when
[1:48:35] God when God baptize you into the
[1:48:38] kingdom, nobody could take you out.
[1:48:42] Oh, give the Lord some praises.
[1:48:45] Glory to God.
[1:48:46] [Laughter]
[1:49:01] It don't make a difference how smart we
[1:49:04] are. How much we think we
[1:49:07] know, how much we want to be different
[1:49:09] from somebody
[1:49:11] else. Listen to these words. As long as
[1:49:15] brotherly feeling isn't among
[1:49:20] us, we are fighting a losing battle.
[1:49:26] We can't win.
[1:49:28] There is no way for us to
[1:49:30] win. Why? You know why? Because the
[1:49:34] prophet said faith
[1:49:38] is based on forgiveness. Amen.
[1:49:41] Faith is based on forgiveness.
[1:49:44] [Music]
[1:49:50] I want you to think about that.
[1:49:52] If William Brown was sent to turn our
[1:49:55] hearts
[1:49:57] back to the feet of the fathers
[1:50:01] and feet is based upon forgiveness.
[1:50:04] Where is the forgiveness?
[1:50:08] I see
[1:50:09] bitterness. I see divisions. I see
[1:50:13] attitudes. I see men swinging seeds in
[1:50:15] the congregation against the next
[1:50:18] congregation. Absolute
[1:50:20] foolishness. I see men doing like if the
[1:50:22] people is their
[1:50:26] own. They're not seeing themselves as
[1:50:28] stewards of the grace of
[1:50:32] God. Opportunity to minister to the body
[1:50:34] of Jesus Christ.
[1:50:36] [Music]
[1:50:38] But God said, "I will restore. I'm not
[1:50:41] asking a pastor. I'm not asking a bishop
[1:50:45] or a message
[1:50:47] pope will restore
[1:50:50] all that was lost. I'm bringing it
[1:50:54] back." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But
[1:50:58] prophesied in the message the second
[1:51:00] coming of the Lord. He said when the
[1:51:03] church finds this brotherly love he knew
[1:51:07] it will be like this but one day you're
[1:51:10] going to find it and when you find it
[1:51:14] going to explode because God will be
[1:51:17] pleased God love when we love one
[1:51:20] another. God love when we forgive one
[1:51:24] another. This issue of forgiveness is
[1:51:27] not a new thing. Jesus had to deal with
[1:51:29] it.
[1:51:33] Hallelujah.
[1:51:35] Jesus, listen this in in in Matthew 18.
[1:51:40] Then came Peter to him. I said, "Lord,
[1:51:42] how often shall I my brother sin against
[1:51:46] me and I forgive him till seven
[1:51:51] times?" Peter even had a number,
[1:51:55] a good number,
[1:51:57] number seven. But Jesus had a bigger
[1:52:00] number than that. Jesus said unto him, I
[1:52:02] say not unto thee seven
[1:52:04] times. 70*
[1:52:08] 7. That's a that's a
[1:52:10] day that not weekly or not yearly
[1:52:13] investment. That is a
[1:52:15] day. How long shall I forgive my
[1:52:19] brother? I have a number seven
[1:52:21] times. Jesus said no. Jesus gave him a
[1:52:24] better number.
[1:52:26] He says 70 *
[1:52:28] 7 490 times.
[1:52:44] Then Jesus give our next parable and we
[1:52:46] go into that. I just want to tell you
[1:52:48] that Jesus had us to address that
[1:52:52] this thing about
[1:52:53] forgiveness. Now watch this. If a man
[1:52:57] don't believe the same as I
[1:52:59] do, I will go right into his
[1:53:02] congregation and preach with him. Just
[1:53:05] preach what he believes
[1:53:07] because I love
[1:53:10] him. In other words, here comes a bring
[1:53:14] disturbance. Some people don't even
[1:53:16] respect the sovereignity of the local
[1:53:17] church.
[1:53:19] And the reason it was
[1:53:21] taught is to get rid of bishops. And as
[1:53:24] bishops and message
[1:53:28] popes, once you have bishop and as
[1:53:31] bishop, you have to cater for them.
[1:53:36] But without as bishop and and bishops,
[1:53:39] the Holy Ghost could
[1:53:41] move. You know, if the man could preach
[1:53:43] what God put upon his
[1:53:47] heart, the three wise
[1:53:50] men, there wasn't foolish men.
[1:53:54] There was wise men. Each one had
[1:53:58] revelation. One say what you bringing.
[1:54:02] What do you have for the No. No. One
[1:54:05] bought frankincense,
[1:54:08] one gold,
[1:54:11] one. No. Oh, you bringing frankincense.
[1:54:14] I want frankincense, too.
[1:54:18] What? What you bringing? You bringing
[1:54:20] water? I bring I go bring water, too.
[1:54:22] Yes.
[1:54:23] That is no revelation at all. Revelation
[1:54:26] means that you are confident that this
[1:54:29] is what God want you to
[1:54:32] present. Hallelujah. When the wise men
[1:54:36] came, one bought gold, one bought
[1:54:39] frankincense and one bought
[1:54:42] my put the message together. When you
[1:54:45] put the message together, you get God in
[1:54:48] service to die.
[1:54:50] Glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:54:54] And one of these
[1:54:55] days put it together.
[1:54:58] Sons of God coming back to make havoc
[1:55:03] in the devil's
[1:55:05] kingdom. Praise the Lord.
[1:55:08] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Sons of God.
[1:55:12] Because Satan went in God's Eden
[1:55:18] and caused confusion. God
[1:55:22] waited for Satan to have his Eden
[1:55:29] and we are here. Now the devil is not
[1:55:33] afraid of what you are
[1:55:36] now. You don't intimidate him. What the
[1:55:39] devil is afraid of what you can
[1:55:42] become. Hallelujah. The devil is afraid
[1:55:47] of what you can
[1:55:48] become. Because if you begin to
[1:55:51] see
[1:55:53] tonight under the blood, you have a
[1:55:57] perfect standing.
[1:56:01] I know you ain't get that.
[1:56:04] I I know you didn't get that. People, we
[1:56:07] have to get
[1:56:09] this. Listen, we're going to preach it.
[1:56:13] Under the blood, when God looks down, he
[1:56:17] sees no sin.
[1:56:21] Four people say amen. Amen.
[1:56:23] [Applause]
[1:56:27] Let me push a little bit. Who he phon
[1:56:29] you, he call.
[1:56:33] Who he call, he justified.
[1:56:36] Who he justified. He make a big jump,
[1:56:38] you already glorified.
[1:56:43] Notice there's nothing more
[1:56:45] sanctification there.
[1:56:47] That's the working out
[1:56:49] part. That's the labor
[1:56:51] part. That's the price we pay
[1:56:54] part. What he's showing you by the word.
[1:56:58] The reason that you are
[1:56:59] called is because you were in his
[1:57:02] mind and the back part of his
[1:57:05] mind. You were in his mind before Satan
[1:57:08] was
[1:57:09] created. Because Satan came in the
[1:57:12] beginning,
[1:57:13] but you were before the beginning.
[1:57:16] precipio.
[1:57:20] [Laughter]
[1:57:24] [Music]
[1:57:32] Amen. You be
[1:57:36] seated. The first man God made
[1:57:40] was a spirit manitual. You are not
[1:57:43] seeing me.
[1:57:44] You seen a brownkinned man is the house
[1:57:47] I live
[1:57:49] in. I could have white
[1:57:52] skin, Chinese skin. It's not this is not
[1:57:55] me is what behind there. So when God put
[1:57:59] Adam, original
[1:58:02] man, his spirit in the beginning,
[1:58:05] Genesis one man had a commission to have
[1:58:09] dominion,
[1:58:10] to conquer,
[1:58:12] to rule, to reign. Now because the earth
[1:58:16] belongs to
[1:58:18] us, Genesis 2, he form
[1:58:22] man out of the dust of the earth and
[1:58:25] take that spirit man and put him in a
[1:58:28] dust man. Note in Genesis one, God
[1:58:32] talking about
[1:58:33] eating cuz the spirit man eaten
[1:58:36] nothing. But when he put him in flesh,
[1:58:39] he said of all the trees, you had to eat
[1:58:41] now because you're on the earth now. God
[1:58:44] know you will be here now. You have to
[1:58:46] work now. You have to fight now. God
[1:58:49] knows all of that. Hallelujah. And when
[1:58:53] Adam fell, everything fall down because
[1:58:57] Adam was to speak for us.
[1:59:01] Adam had the book and he was to call
[1:59:04] your name. But when he fell, this book
[1:59:07] went back in the hands of the original
[1:59:10] owner. So when Jesus come the first
[1:59:14] message must be born again of the word
[1:59:18] and of the spirit. So God had to make a
[1:59:22] way to correct what happened with Adam
[1:59:27] because it's not our fault.
[1:59:30] It's not your fault. It's already Adam
[1:59:33] fault. If Adam didn't fall, he was going
[1:59:36] to be sons of God.
[1:59:39] Oh, glory to God. No sin, no gray hair,
[1:59:45] no debt. But because he fell, God had to
[1:59:48] make a way. And he made a way by
[1:59:52] justification. And that justification is
[1:59:55] more than forgiveness. It's as if you
[1:59:57] never did it.
[1:59:59] [Laughter]
[2:00:11] Hallelujah.
[2:00:15] Praise the Lord. All right. Devil is a
[2:00:18] liar.
[2:00:20] You want to cut out of my voice.
[2:00:22] Praise the Lord. So listen to this. So,
[2:00:26] so when God had to make a way,
[2:00:29] justification as if you never did it,
[2:00:32] you take it and put in the sea,
[2:00:35] not of your forgiven, not of your
[2:00:38] forgetfulness of his
[2:00:42] forgetfulness. So, the devil said
[2:00:45] they're guilty,
[2:00:47] you say of what?
[2:00:50] Because Jesus
[2:00:52] Jesus dropped the charges.
[2:00:55] Jesus dismiss your case.
[2:00:58] But you see if it has strike you
[2:01:00] yet would act
[2:01:07] like I had to finish off here.
[2:01:10] No, I ain't come here to run
[2:01:12] out. I know somebody say one hour. I
[2:01:15] don't know
[2:01:16] what normally I preach about all night.
[2:01:19] I we had to go past that now. But
[2:01:22] Brandham says now,
[2:01:24] okay, he said,
[2:01:26] um, I have never left a meeting yet with
[2:01:28] a bad
[2:01:32] taste. He said, I would rather have a
[2:01:35] church that knows nothing about any
[2:01:37] spiritual
[2:01:38] gift and just be so in love with each
[2:01:41] other and with Christ. I'd rather have
[2:01:45] that than every spiritual gift operating
[2:01:48] in the
[2:01:48] [Music]
[2:01:49] church. Where there's gifts, they would
[2:01:53] fail.
[2:01:55] Where there is gifts, there would bring
[2:01:58] confusion.
[2:01:59] Where there is gifts, they can be
[2:02:01] questioned. But where there is love, it
[2:02:05] is perfect.
[2:02:11] Now I'm going to share with you what
[2:02:15] brother Brandham says.
[2:02:17] So the bride is always part of the
[2:02:19] bridegroom.
[2:02:21] So the bride will not be a denomination.
[2:02:24] It will have to be the word
[2:02:26] manifested to be the bride. Note his
[2:02:29] words, not word believed
[2:02:32] because many believed and and even the
[2:02:34] devil believed too and trembled and he's
[2:02:36] not in the bride. The bride has to be
[2:02:40] the word manifested.
[2:02:42] So bam says that's the reason you have
[2:02:44] to be born again.
[2:02:46] You were separate. He said now no right
[2:02:50] no
[2:02:51] divorcement. Okay. He said all right let
[2:02:53] me skip that down. Now your name has
[2:02:56] been transferred
[2:02:58] from the old book to the new book. God
[2:03:02] put in the sea of forgetfulness.
[2:03:04] You stand perfectly before
[2:03:07] God. You heard that your state is
[2:03:10] variable. What? Your state.
[2:03:14] You feel up. You feel down. You feel
[2:03:16] suppressed.
[2:03:18] That is not your
[2:03:19] standard. That is your
[2:03:21] state. When God look
[2:03:23] down, you are his son. You are his
[2:03:27] daughter.
[2:03:28] That's it. That's your standing. But you
[2:03:32] have the blues. You're feeling down.
[2:03:33] You're
[2:03:35] feeling state. Now, charity,
[2:03:40] the spirit will bring that perfect
[2:03:42] state.
[2:03:44] Right now, you have a perfect standing.
[2:03:47] that bigger than supreme confidence that
[2:03:50] whatever we ask it shall be granted
[2:03:54] that's the standing that we have but
[2:03:58] says you stand perfectly before
[2:04:00] God your name is not now in the new
[2:04:04] book not the book of life but the lamb's
[2:04:07] book of life but the lamb
[2:04:10] redeemed hallelujah then he said this he
[2:04:14] said now watch justified
[2:04:17] Look up the word. The word don't mean
[2:04:20] forgiven. It doesn't mean
[2:04:22] forgiven. For instance, the word I got
[2:04:25] drunk and done some evil
[2:04:27] things. And you found out I didn't do
[2:04:29] them. And you come and say, "But I
[2:04:31] forgive you. Forgive me. I didn't do it
[2:04:34] in the first place. Now, if I did do it,
[2:04:37] I'm
[2:04:38] guilty. You forgive me." But yet, I'm
[2:04:42] not justified.
[2:04:44] But the word
[2:04:45] justify. Let me see if you're believing
[2:04:47] this now tonight. I want to see how much
[2:04:49] amen you going see on
[2:04:51] this. Anybody
[2:04:54] sleeping? You got toothpick to put any
[2:04:59] high. Let's go. Watch the word
[2:05:04] justify is though you never done
[2:05:08] it. It is not even regarded at all.
[2:05:14] It's in God's book of the sea of God.
[2:05:16] I'm reading
[2:05:19] it. Your old book on marriage is divorce
[2:05:21] is
[2:05:23] dead. You never done it in the first
[2:05:26] place.
[2:05:28] Watch. You were predestinated for him to
[2:05:30] be in his
[2:05:32] bride. You were deceived into it by by
[2:05:35] marriage of your adulterous parents
[2:05:37] evil.
[2:05:41] I hear
[2:05:44] about it's no fault of your own.
[2:05:49] You were deceived into it.
[2:05:52] He says again, it ate your fault.
[2:05:56] This is from invisible union of the
[2:05:57] bride. You never did it because that
[2:06:02] germ that was in you was to be in you
[2:06:06] before the foundation of the world. You
[2:06:09] were for ordained
[2:06:11] to be a son of God. Isn't that right?
[2:06:15] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[2:06:18] The bridegroom took your shame
[2:06:22] and put it in the sea of forgetfulness
[2:06:25] and then he made this big
[2:06:27] announcement. You are
[2:06:29] standing completely
[2:06:32] justified as though you never did it at
[2:06:35] the beginning. Then he said, "This is my
[2:06:38] message to the church."
[2:06:43] Amen.
[2:06:48] And the Bible said Jesus was raised from
[2:06:52] the dead.
[2:06:54] He was raised up for our justification.
[2:06:58] God had to make a way that we could be
[2:07:01] cleaned up, our sins canled, everything
[2:07:05] disregarded.
[2:07:07] How else could we go back to
[2:07:09] Eden? Oh, we are going back to Eden. As
[2:07:13] if we never fell. Give the Lord some
[2:07:16] praises. You are going back to Eden.
[2:07:20] Hallelujah.
[2:07:22] Hallelujah. Listen church. He said this.
[2:07:26] You are the pure,
[2:07:29] virtuous, sinless pride of the son of
[2:07:32] the living God.
[2:07:36] He didn't ask if you're feeling it. He
[2:07:39] never say feel as though
[2:07:40] this feeling
[2:07:42] pure feeling
[2:07:44] virtuous feeling nothing that's
[2:07:48] okay and God can't
[2:07:51] lie. God can't
[2:07:53] lie. Oh, praising the Lord.
[2:07:57] Glory. Hallelujah. I have to finish. I
[2:08:00] have to finish. If the devil
[2:08:04] can keep us
[2:08:05] separated. He got us shooting at one
[2:08:08] another. He got a open target. He wants
[2:08:10] to
[2:08:12] shoot. What's the use of
[2:08:15] shooting when we are shooting one
[2:08:17] another? So he can sit back and
[2:08:22] relax. But said, "Let me give it to you.
[2:08:26] I found grace in your sight through
[2:08:29] God. You take my word on this, brethren.
[2:08:32] If you want to be a
[2:08:34] blessing and get a blessing, when a man
[2:08:38] has done you
[2:08:39] wrong, he has done you wrong and you
[2:08:42] know he's done you wrong,
[2:08:45] don't mention
[2:08:47] that. Take it to him to pray it before
[2:08:50] God.
[2:08:54] But you know what happened to the
[2:08:56] message? He wrong me. He wrong me.
[2:09:03] No finger going.
[2:09:05] So how could the bride that is
[2:09:15] justified? That's why Jesus saying if
[2:09:18] you don't release your brother I
[2:09:19] wouldn't release you.
[2:09:22] If you can't forgive your brother I
[2:09:23] can't forgive you.
[2:09:26] Therefore, you would not be able to come
[2:09:28] to the faith once you deliver to the
[2:09:31] saints and to go into the rapture you
[2:09:34] need rapturing faith. So the prophet
[2:09:37] come to take us to the fathers original
[2:09:40] faith and then that faith had to be
[2:09:43] amplified and that faith had to change
[2:09:45] his
[2:09:46] body. Is that right? The rapture is not
[2:09:50] outside
[2:09:52] in. The rapture is inside
[2:09:56] out. On the inside,
[2:09:59] hallelujah.
[2:10:00] Has to start on the inside.
[2:10:04] Praise the name of the Lord. Amen.
[2:10:06] Hallelujah. Amen. Watch this. Now, don't
[2:10:10] take it in a selfish way. I'm supposed
[2:10:11] to do
[2:10:12] this. Stand by your brother.
[2:10:16] Pray for your brother.
[2:10:17] Praise God.
[2:10:20] I hear so much of
[2:10:21] things about me. At a time I was
[2:10:24] traveling with a brother, pick him up
[2:10:27] and he didn't know who I was.
[2:10:30] Ask me where I was
[2:10:32] fellowshipping. I
[2:10:35] said, you say,
[2:10:37] "Who's brother?"
[2:10:39] And he doesn't know I'm I'm I'm driving
[2:10:41] with
[2:10:42] him talking, fellowshipping.
[2:10:45] And when you're about to leave, he said,
[2:10:48] "By the way, what's your name?" What
[2:10:49] number? I said,
[2:10:52] "I'm said, did I say anything wrong?" I
[2:10:55] said, "I only said I did that." I said,
[2:10:57] "Because I know if I said I'm
[2:10:59] there no
[2:11:01] fellowship because you see here things,
[2:11:04] not discern things." But I'm saying five
[2:11:08] minutes. You could tell if a man is a
[2:11:11] Christian. How much talk the man could
[2:11:13] talk in five minutes?
[2:11:15] It's not by the talk, it's by the
[2:11:17] spirit. So he said we should keep the
[2:11:20] unity of the
[2:11:21] spirit until the unity of the faith
[2:11:24] comes and the unity of the spirit has
[2:11:27] nothing to do with
[2:11:29] doctrine. It has to do with the spirit
[2:11:32] in a man. Oh glory to God. Now we could
[2:11:36] understand why the prophet said I prefer
[2:11:39] deal with a man that right in
[2:11:41] spirit and wrong in
[2:11:43] doctrine than a man who went wrong in
[2:11:46] spirit doctrine but didn't God isn't a
[2:11:50] prophet for us to be wrong in
[2:11:52] doctrine a prophet that we could be
[2:11:54] right in spirit and right in
[2:11:55] doctrine when a man's spirit is
[2:11:58] right could help him could bless him I
[2:12:03] like to take this word
[2:12:05] He said many true
[2:12:07] ministers will misunderstand that
[2:12:09] prophet.
[2:12:11] So I can't say this one not true and
[2:12:12] that one
[2:12:14] true. I said many will misunderstand.
[2:12:18] I believe I have not misunderstood that
[2:12:20] prophet. I believe redemption is in two
[2:12:23] parts coming out of and going
[2:12:26] into a bunch of people come out and they
[2:12:30] have to go into now.
[2:12:33] God will raise up some spiritual
[2:12:37] Joshua, some sons of God to take them
[2:12:40] into the promised land. No message pope,
[2:12:46] no no bishop get them into the land of
[2:12:49] sons of God that God have raised up. And
[2:12:53] I always believe just like the pastor
[2:12:55] said this morning there are men
[2:12:58] everywhere. And God don't have to ask
[2:13:00] anybody
[2:13:02] permission to bless to anoint to revive
[2:13:07] to inspire. God has to ask anybody
[2:13:10] permission permission to bless you
[2:13:12] tonight.
[2:13:14] Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[2:13:16] Hallelujah.
[2:13:18] Hallelujah.
[2:13:21] Hallelujah.
[2:13:23] I'm going to skip.
[2:13:25] So, okay. I read a scripture, okay,
[2:13:27] about um faith based upon forgiveness.
[2:13:28] Almost done. I want to
[2:13:31] close 17 pages or 12. We do very good
[2:13:34] tonight.
[2:13:36] You've been a great audience.
[2:13:38] Brother, he said, "Now the seventh one
[2:13:42] is brotherly love." Six, brotherly love.
[2:13:46] That's a good one. And when we get to
[2:13:49] that, put yourself in your brother's
[2:13:52] place on the
[2:13:54] matter. Before you're
[2:13:56] criticizing, put on his shoes because
[2:13:59] you don't have a nail sticking him in
[2:14:00] his
[2:14:02] shoes. You don't know what he's going
[2:14:04] through acting the way he's act.
[2:14:08] for a if a brother is all out of
[2:14:12] tune. Don't be impatient with
[2:14:15] him. Be
[2:14:17] kind. Go
[2:14:19] anyhow. Somebody said long ago. How can
[2:14:22] you believe these things the way you
[2:14:24] do and still go to the assemblies of God
[2:14:27] and
[2:14:28] watch? He said brotherly kindness,
[2:14:31] hoping someday,
[2:14:34] patience with
[2:14:35] him, temperance,
[2:14:38] enduring with him,
[2:14:41] knowledge to understand what he
[2:14:43] believes and it's in his
[2:14:46] heart, virtue in
[2:14:48] yourself to let it go with
[2:14:51] kindness, meekness to him, having faith
[2:14:54] that someday God will bring him
[2:14:57] in. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:15:00] I'm going to close. We're going Job 42.
[2:15:06] We know what Job went through, right?
[2:15:08] God pick out Job because the devil keep
[2:15:10] passing him
[2:15:14] by. Satan, where are you? Going all over
[2:15:17] the world deceiving
[2:15:19] people. Come,
[2:15:21] come. That is my man.
[2:15:27] That man is clueless on the
[2:15:29] earth. That man Joe have no idea what's
[2:15:32] coming. If you don't have a revelation,
[2:15:34] you are
[2:15:36] finished. That man had revelation.
[2:15:39] That man make
[2:15:41] offering. But eventually his children
[2:15:44] sinned. So when the devil stripped
[2:15:49] Job and Job came through,
[2:15:53] Job answered and said, I know that thou
[2:15:56] can't do everything.
[2:16:01] Okay. And no, I I'll go from five. I
[2:16:04] have heard of thee by the hair of the
[2:16:05] ear,
[2:16:08] and know my eyes seeth thee.
[2:16:11] Wherefore I abhore
[2:16:15] myself and repent in dust and
[2:16:18] ashes. And when he was absorb himself,
[2:16:24] he wasn't talking about bad
[2:16:27] self, he was talking about good message
[2:16:29] self.
[2:16:32] I hate
[2:16:34] self. People don't talk that no
[2:16:37] more. They don't like this dead thing,
[2:16:39] this process thing.
[2:16:42] But Jesus didn't only get gold and
[2:16:46] frankincense my which was part of the
[2:16:49] package.
[2:16:51] And God have to release m that we could
[2:16:53] die out
[2:16:59] ourselves. But here's the part I want to
[2:17:02] get. And it was
[2:17:04] so that the Lord had spoken these words
[2:17:06] to
[2:17:07] Job. The Lord spoke to Elephaz and
[2:17:13] Temonite and Teite. My wrath is kingdom
[2:17:16] against thee,
[2:17:18] for you have not spoken to me the things
[2:17:20] that is right.
[2:17:24] I want to skip down quickly.
[2:17:27] So Elaz and Teite
[2:17:30] did according as the Lord commanded
[2:17:32] them.
[2:17:34] The Lord also accepted Job.
[2:17:38] You ready? You ready? And the Lord
[2:17:43] turned the captivity of Job
[2:17:47] when he prayed for his friend.
[2:17:51] Also the Lord give Job twice as much as
[2:17:55] he had before.
[2:17:58] So could you imagine the people that
[2:18:00] hate you, the people that criticize you,
[2:18:03] the people that say this about you? God
[2:18:05] wants to see if you
[2:18:07] We pray for them. The Bible said, "When
[2:18:10] Job did that, God release him." Give the
[2:18:14] Lord some praises tonight.
[2:18:21] Let me go
[2:18:22] quickly. A mother, she can be so mean
[2:18:26] and
[2:18:28] cruel. Just before the baby is born,
[2:18:31] there's a certain kindness that sets
[2:18:34] in. Anyone notice that?
[2:18:37] take on a certain
[2:18:39] sweetness because life is coming
[2:18:41] forth. Question. Is it possible that
[2:18:45] this brotherly
[2:18:47] kindness sweetness that have to come
[2:18:50] among the bride? Could it be a sign that
[2:18:54] life is coming
[2:18:55] next? Oh, praise God. Because the bride
[2:18:57] is pregnant. You know,
[2:19:00] pregnant with God. I have to close up
[2:19:03] with this. He's talking about sister
[2:19:05] shepherd dream in blasemous
[2:19:06] names. Uh sister shepherd dream
[2:19:11] about a man and pouring this in a large
[2:19:15] clothing and pouring this water into a
[2:19:21] box and all the water leaked
[2:19:25] out. Brother interpreted that that as a
[2:19:30] message cleans out the church.
[2:19:34] It boils out the
[2:19:35] trash, he said. But then he take a
[2:19:37] bucket of
[2:19:39] honey. And he poured it in that rock
[2:19:43] box. He said it will hold
[2:19:45] this. He said the honey. It looked like
[2:19:49] it wouldn't
[2:19:50] stick. But it did stick. He said the
[2:19:53] honey does
[2:19:55] stick. Oh, blessed be. I'm finished
[2:19:57] tonight. Oh, praise God. So friends,
[2:20:02] this what I share with you tonight is no
[2:20:05] super mystery.
[2:20:09] [Music]
[2:20:11] Sunday we will get into it.
[2:20:14] Do I know all mystery?
[2:20:17] Do I have all knowledge?
[2:20:20] And don't I don't have this thing called
[2:20:22] love.
[2:20:25] I'm
[2:20:26] nothing. Amen. So this is when the tire
[2:20:29] hits the road.
[2:20:33] This is when it gets real.
[2:20:36] The Bible didn't say the word becomes
[2:20:38] word. The Bible say the word become
[2:20:40] flesh.
[2:20:42] And if the word become
[2:20:43] flesh, that word could take out some
[2:20:45] money and give it to you to go and get a
[2:20:50] sandwich. Sit and love your
[2:20:52] brother. We stand and worship God
[2:20:54] tonight.
[2:20:56] Father we praise you. Father we bless
[2:20:58] you. Father we pray the

[2:46:59] to God. Glory to God. Glory to God. Yes,
[2:47:02] Lord. Amen.
[2:47:05] Amen. Praise God. Amen. Just before we
[2:47:07] close off in a word of prayer. Amen. We
[2:47:10] have three notes of praise and one
[2:47:12] prayer
[2:47:14] request. Amen.
[2:47:16] So we
[2:47:17] have always one note of praise from
[2:47:21] sister Donna K Clark.
[2:47:25] Amen.
[2:47:27] So sister don I would like to thank God
[2:47:30] for his promised word of healing and for
[2:47:33] the saints who stood and continue to
[2:47:35] stand in faith on my
[2:47:37] behalf. I have learned to have joy
[2:47:40] during my trials. So even though
[2:47:44] wheezing, I was full of joy as I was
[2:47:47] hospitalized. For I knew that God had a
[2:47:49] purpose for each trial and and that I
[2:47:52] had someone to meet during my hospital
[2:47:56] stay to display Christ nature to others.
[2:48:00] But God is cutting out all the unwanted
[2:48:04] trash from our life with each trial. Can
[2:48:06] we say amen?
[2:48:08] This is a testimony. Amen. During my
[2:48:11] hospital stay, I had to learn to look
[2:48:14] past the outward appearance of the other
[2:48:16] patients on my ward and tell them about
[2:48:19] Jesus, the
[2:48:20] healer. Also to enter in on behalf of
[2:48:23] the nursing staff who may be grumpy or
[2:48:26] indifferent and ask God for me not to
[2:48:29] hinder them and make their shift
[2:48:32] lighter. Amen. Cuz she's a nurse. Amen.
[2:48:35] As my wheezing
[2:48:37] resolved, the long-term use of the
[2:48:40] steroid
[2:48:42] caused caution syndrome to
[2:48:46] develop. Though I may be going through
[2:48:48] the process of this syndrome syndrome, I
[2:48:52] am glad to be able to fellowship in
[2:48:53] person with the saints this morning.
[2:48:56] Amen. Good to see sister here this
[2:48:59] morning. Amen. Thank God she's out.
[2:49:03] Amen. I am glad to be able to fellowship
[2:49:05] in person with the saints this morning
[2:49:06] and knowing that God's word cannot
[2:49:08] return void. And though your situation
[2:49:11] may seem long, say it is well for it is
[2:49:14] well with my soul. God bless you, Sister
[2:49:16] Donna K. Amen. Thank God that she's out
[2:49:19] and may God continue to heal precious
[2:49:22] sister.
[2:49:23] Amen. Amen. Also we have a prayer
[2:49:26] request here from brother
[2:49:28] Gideon on behalf of please pray for
[2:49:32] Kenneth Harford who is suffering with
[2:49:35] stage 4 kidney disease. Amen. So we want
[2:49:38] to pray for for Mr. Kenneth Harford at
[2:49:42] this time. Amen. Praise the Lord. Do you
[2:49:44] have a special need on your heart a
[2:49:46] request? You can raise your hands. Amen.
[2:49:49] As you want to take it to the Lord and
[2:49:51] also close off the service.
[2:49:53] [Music]
[2:49:56] Amen. Remember when you stand praying
[2:49:59] for charity, forgive. Amen. Praise the
[2:50:02] Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. So, God
[2:50:05] sees those hands this morning. Let's
[2:50:06] just bow our heads and close our
[2:50:09] eyes. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:50:12] Just thank him in your own way this
[2:50:14] morning. Let's just thank him a little
[2:50:15] bit. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Father.
[2:50:18] Lord, we thank you for the finished
[2:50:19] work. We thank you Lord God for all that

[2:50:22] Lord. We praise you. We bless you Lord.

[2:50:34] you father. Hallelujah. Heavenly father.
[2:50:37] Lord we are so grateful Lord for your

[2:50:42] word in due season. Oh how good it is
[2:50:45] father. Lord it's life to us Lord. Lord,
[2:50:49] it is water to a thirsty soul. Father,
[2:50:53] Lord, may the word find a resting place
[2:50:56] in our hearts. Lord, may we ponder upon
[2:50:59] what we have heard. May it not just
[2:51:01] remain a nice sermon, Father, but may we
[2:51:04] practice it. May we live it out, Lord.
[2:51:07] Forgiving one another, dropping ours,
[2:51:09] getting rid of every grudge, Father, for
[2:51:12] Lord, if we have even as much as one
[2:51:15] grudge in our heart, we are in danger of
[2:51:17] hell's
[2:51:19] fire. Lord, touch your people. Give them
[2:51:21] strength this morning. Raise up the
[2:51:23] downtrodden. Lord, inspire and anoint
[2:51:26] your people for service. Father, for

[2:51:31] Father, and we want to be anointed and
[2:51:33] in position and in place, Lord, to to to

[2:51:39] the battle is the coming of the
[2:51:41] Lord. Lord Jesus, we want to bring,
[2:51:43] Lord, the prayer request before you for
[2:51:46] Kenneth Harford who is suffering with
[2:51:48] stage 4 kidney disease. Lord, may your
[2:51:52] Holy Spirit, Lord, go wherever Kenneth
[2:51:54] is at this time and touch him from the
[2:51:57] crown of his head to the sole of his
[2:51:59] feet. Father, Lord, you made every organ
[2:52:02] in the body, Father. Lord, you raised
[2:52:04] Lazarus from the dead. And if you raised
[2:52:07] that man who was dead four days old,
[2:52:09] four days in in in the grave, Lord, you
[2:52:12] could surely, Lord, heal a kidney,
[2:52:14] Father. Oh God, may you restore and heal
[2:52:18] Kenneth Hford at this time. Father, we
[2:52:21] we pray that healing virtue will be
[2:52:23] ministered unto him even now. Touch his
[2:52:26] soul as well. And Lord, may we hear the
[2:52:28] testimony of the great miracle that you
[2:52:31] would have done, Father, for you are
[2:52:32] indeed a great physician, Father. Lord,
[2:52:36] Lord, remember Lord your saints that

[2:52:40] situations, different conditions. Lord,
[2:52:43] meet every need right now. Father,
