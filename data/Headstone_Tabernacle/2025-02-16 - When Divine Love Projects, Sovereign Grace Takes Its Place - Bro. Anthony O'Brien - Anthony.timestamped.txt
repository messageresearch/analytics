[50:58] morning
[51:00] amen praise the name of the
[51:03] Lord so my title is when Divine love

[51:11] place when Divine love
[51:14] projects Sovereign Grace takes its place
[51:18] amen and amen so are you happy to be in
[51:21] his presence this morning amen am just
[51:24] give me one second here uh I just want
[51:26] to make a quick
[51:28] adjustment amen so we've been blessed so
[51:31] far by the messages I know I have
[51:34] been even up to last Sunday uh with the
[51:38] message that we heard the tape amen do
[51:40] you appreciate that to brotherly
[51:42] kindness at
[51:44] charity what a message from the Lord and
[51:48] so we know that uh God is speaking by
[51:51] his
[51:51] word amen and uh I had a little
[51:54] inspiration here on the of
[51:57] God and I was thinking about it some
[52:00] weeks now and so when I heard what was
[52:05] spoken um it just blew my mind because
[52:08] it was right down the same channel but
[52:11] uh brotherly kindness as a key the
[52:14] Wednesday before that was also really
[52:18] outstanding and I feel like amen for
[52:20] those of you who are here and for those
[52:22] of you who heard the tape we were
[52:25] mightily blessed by that and we know
[52:28] that this is the requirement for our
[52:31] age it's brotherly kindness and so we
[52:35] are going to be duly
[52:36] tested uh on brotherly kindness so that
[52:40] we could prove it to prove brotherly
[52:43] kindness because that's what the age
[52:46] requires that's it and um so the
[52:49] objective of today's message that I have
[52:50] I wanted to start with an objective so
[52:52] we we we understand where we're going
[52:54] right this is why we're here now and
[52:57] this is why why I'm doing all of this um
[53:00] so the objective is to we want to just
[53:02] kind of show a link now and I'm seeing
[53:04] it as a link between brotherly kindness
[53:07] forgiveness and this love of God this
[53:10] supreme love of
[53:12] godall uh and I truly believe that there
[53:16] is an
[53:17] anointing there's a there's a
[53:20] spirit that's connected to this as
[53:23] well we're not talking about brotherly
[53:25] kindness
[53:27] being as a text or as a nice practice or
[53:32] as a moral scruple or something that we
[53:36] a code of conduct that we should live by
[53:39] or words on a wall in a company that
[53:41] that that's not what we're talking about
[53:43] we this is an actual
[53:46] Spirit um that is supposed to come upon
[53:49] us it's not a mental conception but Bram
[53:53] said uh he said the problem we have in
[53:56] bam Tabernacle is there's there's two
[53:58] kinds of knowledge there's two kinds of
[54:00] temperance two kinds of patience one is
[54:04] natural and the other one is spiritual
[54:07] so we're not talking about natural
[54:08] Temperance or natural patience we're not
[54:12] even talking about natural brotherly
[54:14] kindness because it's it's nice to
[54:17] forgive it's nice to be nice but that's
[54:20] not what we're talking about this
[54:22] morning what we're talking about is an
[54:24] actual spirit
[54:26] of God that comes upon us it's a sweet
[54:31] anointing that comes upon the mother
[54:34] when she's getting ready to bring forth
[54:36] a
[54:37] baby amen amen hallelujah and you
[54:40] spiritual mothers in here getting ready
[54:42] to bring forth Christ a sweet anointing
[54:46] has to come upon us this morning
[54:48] Hallelujah in order to bring forth the
[54:50] the perfect one oh Hallelujah Hall it's
[54:53] it's a real thing
[54:56] it's a
[54:57] force that the devil is flattened by He
[55:01] Is squashed by this Force his his
[55:04] weapons become powerless his his words
[55:07] become
[55:08] disarmed when we put this into
[55:12] gear and we want to turn that key this
[55:16] morning Hallelujah Hal because we feel
[55:19] like it's a key that has to be turned in
[55:22] order to flip us over from the natural
[55:25] into the Supernatural and it will take
[55:28] perfect love to get us over there how do
[55:31] we get into perfect love brotherly
[55:34] kindness Spirit of forgiveness has to
[55:38] come upon
[55:40] you and raise you
[55:43] up above your
[55:46] natural now the spirit of God is here
[55:48] this
[55:49] morning don't get too distracted cuz
[55:51] he's here he's moving now he can sweep
[55:54] down the aisle and baptize you with the
[55:55] Holy Ghost
[55:57] you just stay on fire for God because I
[56:00] am not in control this morning Jesus is
[56:03] at the wheel I'm I'm actually in the
[56:05] back seat I'm I'm having a cool kids
[56:07] praise God Amen Hal he is in charge this
[56:11] morning
[56:13] Hallelujah glory be to God the Lov
[56:16] him so that's my that's the objective
[56:18] that's what God give me right I'm just
[56:21] trusting that he'll help us this morning
[56:23] to bring it out in a way that will will
[56:25] be helpful here and we just surrender to
[56:28] his word now amen oh praise God so we
[56:32] pray that it's that sweet anointing that
[56:33] will sweep over us even while we're
[56:36] speaking this morning we in expectation
[56:39] that what we're talking about could
[56:41] actually become a reality Among
[56:44] Us that fervent charity could be felt
[56:47] among
[56:48] us so much that the devil would have no
[56:52] place in here Among Us oh draw a bigger
[56:57] Circle and we're going to love Out the
[56:59] Devil and we're going to love in our
[57:03] brother so we're going to start with
[57:05] love this morning the prophet said start
[57:07] with love because love will bring
[57:10] Fellowship Hallelujah and fellowship
[57:13] will bring the gifts it'll bring a
[57:15] Revival it'll bring a come see what I
[57:18] found oh H the coin I was lost come and
[57:22] rejoice with me oh all whosoever will
[57:27] can come
[57:29] into the love of God hallu
[57:33] Amen praise God you believe it this
[57:36] morning so when we speak about love we
[57:39] usually Identify two things the prophet
[57:42] spoke of it many times and we just want
[57:45] to lay it as a a backdrop to this
[57:47] today and of course we know F your
[57:50] love which is the Greek word that means
[57:53] friendly love or affection
[57:57] often used to describe a love between
[58:00] close
[58:01] friends isn't that right that's that's
[58:04] that's an Earthly kind of love that
[58:06] that's the kind of love that we are
[58:08] accustomed
[58:09] to that is what is familiar to us um I'm
[58:13] pretty sure if we had our own choice
[58:15] this morning uh there was no Usher here
[58:18] we would sit in the seat that we
[58:21] like we I know you're laughing but it's
[58:24] true me I I would do too that that's
[58:28] just human nature we we I would sit next
[58:30] to somebody uh uh that I am familiar
[58:32] with that that I am comfortable with
[58:35] because as a human being we we like
[58:38] safety brother over was talking about it
[58:41] in the in the bible study on Friday we
[58:44] we we like the comfort zone we like to
[58:47] sit next to people we we know and we
[58:50] like we we are comfortable with people
[58:53] that make us feel safe right that's just
[58:56] that's just how we are very few of us
[58:59] would would feel free or open or brave
[59:02] enough to step out of that comfort zone
[59:05] uh maybe sit in the front seat somewhere
[59:07] you know uh people like to shuffle in
[59:09] the back where where they feel they
[59:10] could just be a little a few rows behind
[59:13] somebody else that's just how it is and
[59:16] that's just a familiarity that's that's
[59:19] how humans are and when we love we we we
[59:22] we base our love on that sense of
[59:25] familiarity
[59:27] uh we if someone does good to us we will
[59:30] do good back for them if someone don't
[59:33] like our head we don't like their head
[59:36] neither uh you know if if you don't
[59:38] scratch my back then I'm not going to
[59:41] scratch yours um don't even ask me to do
[59:44] it because uh you know I just we we just
[59:47] don't have that we just don't
[59:49] click but then there's agape
[59:53] love and agape love is that Greek word
[59:56] that that refers to that pure
[1:00:00] unconditional and sacrificial
[1:00:03] love that love is above that filal love
[1:00:06] that we just talked about it's high
[1:00:09] above it it there's not a love above
[1:00:11] that comp there's no comparison that
[1:00:14] that love endures
[1:00:16] everything it goes past how you feel it
[1:00:20] goes past your condition it's it's
[1:00:23] unconditional isn't that right there's
[1:00:25] no condition there's no set form of
[1:00:28] conditions that need to be met in order
[1:00:30] for agape love to be expressed to
[1:00:33] you God just
[1:00:35] loves God is
[1:00:38] love Yeah and love is of God and anyone
[1:00:42] that loveth is born of God and knoweth
[1:00:45] God he that loveth not knoweth not God
[1:00:50] for God is love oh and it is This Love
[1:00:56] that cast out all fear It Is This Love
[1:00:59] that rescued us when we were broken it
[1:01:02] was this love that look past who we were
[1:01:06] look past our sinful condition look past
[1:01:09] what we were this love reached down into
[1:01:13] the depths of the darkness and pull your
[1:01:16] soul out of hell and if you want to ask
[1:01:20] me why God love you go ask Grace I don't
[1:01:24] have an answer
[1:01:26] God just loves oh he loves and he knows
[1:01:31] who will love him back oh hallelujah
[1:01:36] hallelujah hallelujah but it doesn't
[1:01:39] stop God from
[1:01:42] loving he just loves
[1:01:45] Hallelujah and his love this morning
[1:01:48] Hallelujah is an Unstoppable
[1:01:50] Force his love this morning is why we're
[1:01:54] sitting in this Tabernacle
[1:01:56] his love this morning it is only by his
[1:01:59] love I could call you brother I could
[1:02:02] call you sister it is only by his love
[1:02:06] by his love it allows me to go past
[1:02:09] filal love to go past familiar love and
[1:02:14] love a love that is unknown and go
[1:02:17] beyond into the supernatural going to
[1:02:20] the things that I don't know about F
[1:02:23] your love can't take you there but a
[1:02:26] gape love God's Own love can take you
[1:02:30] into a place that you may not be
[1:02:32] familiar with oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:02:35] hallah that's where God is oh beyond the
[1:02:39] stars Beyond this natural Beyond this
[1:02:42] Earthly realm is a
[1:02:46] love that surrounds all
[1:02:50] things he's beyond all things it is
[1:02:52] above all
[1:02:54] things isn't that
[1:02:56] right God's love is elective
[1:03:00] love he chose you before the foundation
[1:03:03] of the world he said you have not chosen
[1:03:06] me but I have chosen you and ordained
[1:03:10] you that you should bring forth fruit
[1:03:12] Hallelujah and that your fruit should
[1:03:15] remain isn't that right he he he chose
[1:03:19] you before the foundation of the world
[1:03:21] it pleased God uh to choose you don't
[1:03:25] don't ask me how because because when I
[1:03:28] look at myself I don't see nothing worth
[1:03:31] loving uh everybody can find Fault In
[1:03:34] Their Own selves some some people find
[1:03:37] they could be taller some people find
[1:03:39] they're too tall some people find
[1:03:40] they're too dark some people find
[1:03:42] they're too light some some people find
[1:03:44] they're too they they're too skinny some
[1:03:46] people want to lose some weight uh and
[1:03:49] and however you are this morning it
[1:03:51] doesn't matter what condition you find
[1:03:53] yourself in God loves
[1:03:57] you God loves you just the way you
[1:04:02] are and he doesn't desire that you stay
[1:04:05] the way you are but one thing we can't
[1:04:08] deny this morning is that he loves you
[1:04:11] and his love is going to rescue you and
[1:04:14] bring you into a condition that is
[1:04:17] favorable that is that is just that is
[1:04:20] righteous but it's not you doing it it's
[1:04:23] his
[1:04:23] love it's his love of reaching down in
[1:04:27] the midst of all your fear and pushing
[1:04:30] it aside love is going to take first
[1:04:33] place in your life in your heart oh Hal
[1:04:36] it is the work that he is doing right
[1:04:39] now it's all because of
[1:04:41] Love isn't that right Adam and Eve when
[1:04:45] they fell in the Garden of
[1:04:47] Eden there was a fear there that dropped
[1:04:49] upon them they they realized that they
[1:04:52] were naked they realized for the first
[1:04:55] time that you know they saw themselves
[1:04:58] and they they hid themselves and they
[1:05:00] were ashamed of themselves and and their
[1:05:03] own condition and father God came down
[1:05:06] into the midst of the garden and began
[1:05:09] to shout Adam Adam where are you uh
[1:05:14] because you're not in the position that
[1:05:16] I left you when I when I when I when I
[1:05:19] left you
[1:05:20] last uh you're out of place I I can't
[1:05:24] find you in your place that I have left
[1:05:27] you the place that I have put you Bible
[1:05:29] said he planted a garden and called it
[1:05:32] Eden and and then he placed man in that
[1:05:35] garden positionally and everything else
[1:05:38] to to do the work that he had raised him
[1:05:41] up to do uh but here it was God come
[1:05:44] back uh in the garden and one day found
[1:05:47] a a situation that was a lot different
[1:05:51] than when he had had left it last and
[1:05:54] here was man uh fumbling at his words
[1:05:57] saying that I was afraid and we were
[1:06:00] afraid and we we we hid ourselves
[1:06:03] Hallelujah and the Bible says that God
[1:06:05] told them the day you eat that day you
[1:06:08] shall surely die Hallelujah but we know
[1:06:11] that God in that moment when he saw that
[1:06:14] they needed help when he saw that they
[1:06:17] needed a
[1:06:19] savior they were supposed to surely die
[1:06:22] but something happened God God killed an
[1:06:25] animal
[1:06:25] [Applause]
[1:06:28] the wrath of God that was supposed to
[1:06:30] come down upon them came down upon an
[1:06:33] animal
[1:06:35] instead and that animal was a substitute
[1:06:38] for them the Bible said he took the skin
[1:06:41] of that animal and he clothed them in it
[1:06:45] they were drenched in the animal's blood
[1:06:47] and in the sacrifice that that was just
[1:06:50] made as a perfect type for a sacrifice
[1:06:53] that was going to be made for us
[1:06:56] years
[1:06:57] later cousins of time later isn't that
[1:07:00] right but here was God performing his
[1:07:02] first act on Earth of a sacrifice being
[1:07:06] made for man to take his place uh to
[1:07:10] save him because he needed saving and in
[1:07:14] that moment God acted Hallelujah in that
[1:07:17] moment God did something and that's what
[1:07:20] love love does sometimes love does crazy
[1:07:23] things oh Hallelujah but it's loveen in
[1:07:27] action oh Hallelujah isn't that right
[1:07:30] glory to God God's love is
[1:07:33] corrective isn't that right amen because
[1:07:37] he loved he gave isn't that right you
[1:07:40] can give without
[1:07:42] loving but you could hardly love without
[1:07:46] giving I'll say that one more time cuz
[1:07:48] that just went over you you can give
[1:07:51] without
[1:07:52] loving but over always says you could
[1:07:54] give stuff you don't want you know I got
[1:07:56] a old shirt I I'll give it to you I'll
[1:07:59] give it a I have old shoes I'll give it
[1:08:00] to you um but you can't hardly love
[1:08:03] without giving if if you if you really
[1:08:06] love somebody or if you really love
[1:08:09] something you're going to give whatever
[1:08:12] you have even if you don't have material
[1:08:15] things to give you will still give of
[1:08:18] your time you will still give of your
[1:08:20] effort you will still pour into it your
[1:08:23] your inspiration your
[1:08:26] creativity your passion and even if you
[1:08:29] can't do nothing you'll just stick
[1:08:31] around just to let people know I'm here
[1:08:35] I'm in support of this and if I was able
[1:08:39] I would do
[1:08:40] something because I've got love for
[1:08:44] what's going on here I've got love for
[1:08:46] the people here isn't that rightall love
[1:08:52] gives God's love is corrective
[1:08:54] Hallelujah isn't that right Hallelujah
[1:08:57] he he corrects us when we need to be
[1:09:01] corrected because every son that come to
[1:09:03] God must be tested must be tried because
[1:09:09] he wants the best for you he'll
[1:09:11] straighten you
[1:09:12] out he straightens out everybody he he
[1:09:15] doesn't have any
[1:09:18] favorites he doesn't have somebody who
[1:09:20] he like to give food to and not like to

[1:15:25] forgive cuz if you do not
[1:15:28] forgive neither will my Father in Heaven
[1:15:30] forgive
[1:15:32] you but if you could
[1:15:34] forgive if you could release it from
[1:15:36] your
[1:15:37] heart that God could come in there and
[1:15:41] begin to do something and take you on
[1:15:43] another
[1:15:44] level because you're starting to leave
[1:15:46] the familiarity thing you beginning to
[1:15:49] leave the fio realm and you begin to
[1:15:52] step into a realm of the unknown when
[1:15:55] you begin to forgive you're actually
[1:15:56] going into something
[1:16:00] else because the world is it doesn't
[1:16:03] noce the the the human nature the spirit
[1:16:07] it just is designed to to steal to to be
[1:16:12] destructive to to to to stay on their
[1:16:14] own they you know there's a different
[1:16:18] kind of love called eras love which is
[1:16:20] erotic love selflove people are are
[1:16:23] loving themselves Hallelujah and the
[1:16:25] Bible actually says in the last day men
[1:16:27] shall be lovers of themselves that's a
[1:16:30] spirit that is upon the Earth
[1:16:32] today but that is not the spirit that we
[1:16:35] have we have not received the spirit of
[1:16:38] bondage again to fear but we have
[1:16:41] received the spirit of
[1:16:43] adoption whereby we cry ABA father and
[1:16:47] that spirit is going to Bear witness
[1:16:49] with your
[1:16:51] spirit when God sees you forgiven amen
[1:16:54] when God sees you loving when God sees
[1:16:57] you repenting when God sees you treating
[1:17:01] each other right that spirit will bear
[1:17:03] witness with your spirit and let you
[1:17:07] know from above that you are the sons of
[1:17:10] God God's going to send fire on that
[1:17:14] when you can forgive when you can repent
[1:17:17] when you can make it right when you can
[1:17:20] release your ought your Grudge whatever
[1:17:23] it is this morning and God will confirm
[1:17:27] it and make it
[1:17:29] alive then we'll see The Headstone
[1:17:32] coming forth with shoutings crying what
[1:17:37] Grace Grace Grace unto The Headstone UNM
[1:17:41] merited favor we didn't deserve it but
[1:17:45] he did it for us oh Hallelujah we draw a
[1:17:48] bigger Circle this morning and we love
[1:17:51] Out the Devil and we love each other
[1:17:55] we pledge to love the
[1:17:59] Brethren amen he cared for usall because
[1:18:04] he he loves us now the clearest
[1:18:07] distinction between these two forms of
[1:18:08] Love filo and Agape is that fio love is
[1:18:12] a human love isn't that right and and
[1:18:16] it's based on a
[1:18:18] condition but agape love which is Godly
[1:18:22] love is reflective of a higher state
[1:18:26] that is without condition isn't that
[1:18:29] right Hallelujah there's no set form of
[1:18:32] circumstances there's no prerequisite
[1:18:35] needed to access this Godly love it is
[1:18:39] without condition isn't that right God
[1:18:43] is love and God is Sovereign and his
[1:18:46] love is Sovereign and he could love
[1:18:49] whoever he choose to love and God just
[1:18:52] choose to love everybody
[1:18:55] he could do that because he's gone do
[1:18:58] you believe it this
[1:18:59] morning CH John 3:16 for God so loved
[1:19:04] the world that he gave his only begotten
[1:19:07] son that whosoever believeth in him
[1:19:10] should not perish but have everlasting
[1:19:14] lifeall this passage of scripture is one
[1:19:16] of the most
[1:19:18] profound and complete passages of
[1:19:20] scripture in the in the Bible Prophet
[1:19:23] talked about it he said this one passage
[1:19:26] of scripture has led many to
[1:19:28] Christ because in this one passage of
[1:19:31] scripture contains a whole
[1:19:34] message the whole message of the Bible
[1:19:36] the whole message of why God sent his
[1:19:38] son in the first place and what the
[1:19:40] whole point of it is it's it's all
[1:19:43] contained in this one passage of
[1:19:45] scripture if we don't get nothing else
[1:19:48] this morning if if we don't remember
[1:19:50] what song was sung and what scripture
[1:19:51] was read if we just remember this one
[1:19:54] Passage morning we could take home meat
[1:19:56] just from just from this one passage
[1:19:58] this morning because here in this
[1:20:01] passage Christ in the scene is in the
[1:20:03] night time I don't know if it's around a
[1:20:05] campfire or if he was just talking with
[1:20:08] Nicodemus but Nicodemus is a man a
[1:20:11] Pharisee come to Jesus by night and he
[1:20:14] couldn't uh stand to be seen in the day
[1:20:17] uh because of his
[1:20:19] Association and and his affiliation with
[1:20:22] with with the pharan council so he
[1:20:25] choose to come by night to to inquire of
[1:20:28] Jesus because he heard enough to to make
[1:20:30] him to make him uh
[1:20:33] thirsty he heard enough salt to make him
[1:20:37] thirsty he wanted a little more of what
[1:20:39] he had heard and what he had heard and
[1:20:42] and seen I hear say he he listened to
[1:20:45] the tapes and he he listened to the
[1:20:47] hookup but he he needed to come and see
[1:20:50] something and he didn't feel too
[1:20:52] comfortable in the day so he came in the
[1:20:54] night time seeking Jesus seeking his
[1:20:57] counsel he he had some
[1:21:00] questions and as we know he asked how
[1:21:02] should I man be born again and Jesus
[1:21:05] tells him you know it's not of your
[1:21:06] mother's womb but but born of the spirit
[1:21:08] of God and he's expounding and he's
[1:21:11] giving Nicodemus so much word he's given
[1:21:15] him so much H to go with it's it's it's
[1:21:19] really it's really wonderful it's almost
[1:21:21] like he he he he went for a basket and
[1:21:23] and he got a whole truck
[1:21:25] CL he went with a little shopping cat
[1:21:28] and he end up leaving with with with
[1:21:30] with a one ton truck amen of stuff in
[1:21:33] his pickup pray but that's how Jesus
[1:21:36] does he he gives because he loves that's
[1:21:40] just how he is if you BNS God had enough
[1:21:43] love come out it'll fall on you it'll
[1:21:47] fall on your brother it'll fall on your

[1:31:10] Elisha God's Great
[1:31:12] understudy and the bride is going to
[1:31:14] come right in there and take up that
[1:31:16] same spirit and do the same works that
[1:31:19] was done when the prophet was here
[1:31:22] Prophet says what we've work in US small
[1:31:24] measure it's going to be here in his
[1:31:26] fullness when that time comes do you
[1:31:29] believe it amen oh I was on this
[1:31:32] scripture wow I better hurry because
[1:31:34] time is going but I'm having fun this
[1:31:37] morning amen praise God we enjoying the
[1:31:39] word amen but there's a few things I
[1:31:42] want to get to let's just hurry along
[1:31:43] now amen so the he loved the whole world
[1:31:46] right not just one person but the whole
[1:31:49] world he
[1:31:50] gave so God so Lov the world that he
[1:31:53] gave it's an action word he gave love
[1:31:57] gives you can't give without loving
[1:31:59] isn't that right but you can hardly love
[1:32:01] without giving and if you really love
[1:32:03] then you're going to give isn't that
[1:32:06] right if you if you're going to give of
[1:32:08] your time and so forth like that you
[1:32:10] give what you can love makes you do
[1:32:14] something amen about it it's not just
[1:32:17] you talk about love or or an idea of
[1:32:20] love some some people are in love with
[1:32:22] the idea of love but that's not what
[1:32:24] we're talking about we we're not talking
[1:32:26] about speaking lovely the truth but
[1:32:28] speaking the truth in love amen isn't
[1:32:32] that right that's the condition we going
[1:32:34] to come in isn't that right Hallelujah
[1:32:37] so not only did God give but he gave his
[1:32:39] only begotten son God gave his only his
[1:32:42] only begotten son uh God in flesh to die
[1:32:47] for the sins of man and that whosoever
[1:32:51] whosoever anybody in here this morning
[1:32:54] anybody around the world wherever you
[1:32:56] are can come and take of the Water of
[1:32:59] Life freely the fountain is open to all
[1:33:02] isn't that right but would like to say
[1:33:04] God is not an English
[1:33:06] God he's not a Spanish God or or French
[1:33:10] God he he he he has the whole world in
[1:33:13] his hands and and anyone who can want to
[1:33:16] come and surrender themselves can be
[1:33:19] used of him one of my favorite quotes on
[1:33:22] the prophet is that God uses
[1:33:24] uh uh pennies sometimes when he was
[1:33:26] talking about lot being a silver dollar
[1:33:29] and uh uh uh I'm sorry uh Abraham being
[1:33:32] a silver dollar and he said lot was a
[1:33:34] penny but he did say slip in there he
[1:33:36] said God use his Penny sometimes he can
[1:33:39] use pennies in a penny way yes sir he
[1:33:41] could use silver dollar in a silver
[1:33:43] dollar way whatever you have he'll
[1:33:46] use don't don't don't think that what
[1:33:49] you have is too small God could use
[1:33:51] whatever you have even it's a penny
[1:33:54] Jesus said if you have faith like a
[1:33:55] mustard seed you could do something with
[1:33:58] that Faith this
[1:33:59] morning don't think it too
[1:34:02] small don't think it too
[1:34:04] strange God could still use what you
[1:34:07] have he asked Moses what's that you have
[1:34:10] in your hand and he said it was a rod
[1:34:12] and God said throw down that rod and
[1:34:14] that rod turned into a snake and he
[1:34:17] began to work wonders with a old dead
[1:34:19] rod that's been around about 40 years
[1:34:21] Moses didn't even know that rod could do
[1:34:24] that but in God's hand Anything Can
[1:34:27] Happen God could use a rod to lead two
[1:34:31] and a half million people out of the
[1:34:34] hands of the overlord pharaoh who think
[1:34:37] he's so big and bad oh Hal but when God
[1:34:40] takes a hold of somebody God could use
[1:34:42] them to upset nature to turn the whole
[1:34:46] world upside down to break the back of
[1:34:49] the enemy off of God's people off of
[1:34:52] your life whatever you have this morning
[1:34:56] God wants to use if you're willing to
[1:34:58] give yourself over to God oh hallelujah
[1:35:02] hallelujah isn't that right and all that
[1:35:05] feel they so big and bad they haven't
[1:35:07] met God
[1:35:10] yet I heard a saying one time he said
[1:35:13] everybody is a bad man until the
[1:35:15] Cockroach start to
[1:35:18] fly and then we see who's
[1:35:20] bad a lot of stuff was happening in
[1:35:22] Egypt but God had a man ready seasoned
[1:35:26] out 40 years in the desert Hallelujah
[1:35:29] seasoned out all of his thinking all of
[1:35:31] his intellect all his education all what
[1:35:33] he know he was just reduced to love he
[1:35:37] was just reduced to humility he was just
[1:35:40] reduced he is a man with phds with his
[1:35:43] master's uh in science and and and
[1:35:46] astrological study of the day of Egypt
[1:35:49] but yet yet he had to Humble himself he
[1:35:52] said I can't talk and God said don't
[1:35:54] worry I'll get Aon to talk for you but
[1:35:57] you're going down there because my
[1:35:59] people need to be delivered oh
[1:36:02] Hallelujah and God's people need to be
[1:36:04] delivered today think it not strange
[1:36:08] that you are in the hands of almighty
[1:36:10] God God's going to bring you out and
[1:36:12] raise you up for such a time as
[1:36:15] this
[1:36:17] amen so whosoever will come and Believe
[1:36:20] on him will have everlasting life they
[1:36:24] shall not perish that's a promise in the
[1:36:26] word but you'll have everlasting lifeall
[1:36:30] amen and amen hallelujah so we're
[1:36:33] talking about the love of God right
[1:36:34] Hallelujah 1 Corinthians 13 says do I
[1:36:37] speak with the tongue of men and angels
[1:36:38] and have not charity I become as a
[1:36:41] sounding brass or a tinkling symbol it's
[1:36:45] insignificant it's it's just a a voice
[1:36:48] in the wind it's here in one moment and
[1:36:52] and by the even tide it's gone
[1:36:54] it perishes with it isn't that right
[1:36:56] like David said amen he said and though
[1:36:58] I I have the gift of Prophecy and
[1:37:01] understand all Mysteries and all
[1:37:04] knowledge and know a other stuff isn't
[1:37:06] that right and do I have all Faith so
[1:37:08] that I could move mountains and have not
[1:37:11] charity this this love of God I am
[1:37:15] nothing and though I bestow all my goods
[1:37:17] to feed the poor and though I give my
[1:37:20] body to be burned and have not charity
[1:37:23] it profited me nothing charity suffered
[1:37:28] long and is kind charity Envy it not
[1:37:33] charity vaunt it not itself it doesn't
[1:37:36] parade its
[1:37:37] beef it is not puffed up amen it doesn't
[1:37:40] get swell-headed Hallelujah it doesn't
[1:37:42] think itself higher than others isn't
[1:37:45] that right but it it doesn't show up to
[1:37:47] get things it shows up to give
[1:37:50] Hallelujah isn't that right oh doesn't
[1:37:52] behave itself seemingly doesn't get all
[1:37:55] crazy he that believe it shall not make
[1:37:58] haste it seeketh not her own it is not
[1:38:02] easily provoked it think it no evil it
[1:38:06] rejoices not in iniquity but it rejoices
[1:38:10] in the truth it loves truth because it
[1:38:14] knows that truth will set the thing free
[1:38:17] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh
[1:38:21] it rejoices in God's truth oh Hallelujah
[1:38:24] not
[1:38:25] misinformation not
[1:38:27] misinterpretation but the truth amen you
[1:38:31] shall have the truth and the truth is
[1:38:33] going to set you free isn't that right
[1:38:35] it beareth all things believeth all
[1:38:38] things hopeth all things and it endureth
[1:38:42] all things that's that's that's all
[1:38:45] things that's not some
[1:38:47] things this love of God beareth all
[1:38:50] things endureth all things believe it
[1:38:54] unto all things charity never faileth
[1:38:59] but whether there be prophecies they
[1:39:00] shall fail whether there be tongues they
[1:39:03] shall cease whether there be knowledge
[1:39:05] it shall vanish away so we're not in
[1:39:07] this thing for the tongues all right
[1:39:09] we're not in this thing for the
[1:39:10] prophecies yes we know that when the
[1:39:12] Revival comes there'll be great
[1:39:14] outpouring upon the bride and these
[1:39:17] signs are going to follow them that
[1:39:18] believe but s we would see Jesus that's
[1:39:22] what we're about it's not about great
[1:39:25] signs and wonders and miracles but it's
[1:39:27] who can take that word who could live
[1:39:30] that word who could because you have to
[1:39:33] have it in order to give it what are you
[1:39:36] going to give if you don't have you got
[1:39:38] to have something that this world knows
[1:39:41] nothing about that will defeat the enemy
[1:39:44] anytime anywhere any place under any
[1:39:49] condition oh and that love has got to
[1:39:52] project itself
[1:39:54] and manifest something isn't that right
[1:39:56] oh we know in part and prophesy in part
[1:39:59] hallu but that when that which is
[1:40:00] perfect is come and that which is in
[1:40:02] part will be done away 1 Peter 4:8 says
[1:40:06] and above all things have fervent
[1:40:09] charity amongst yourselves for charity
[1:40:12] shall cover the multitude of
[1:40:15] sins oh we believe it this morning amen
[1:40:20] from the Seal of the Antichrist I'll
[1:40:21] read this quickly no matter how much you
[1:40:23] join churches uh no matter said no
[1:40:25] matter you might join churches shake
[1:40:28] hands with pastors put your name on the
[1:40:30] books and all those things are good Paul
[1:40:33] said why though I speak with the tongue
[1:40:35] of men and angels though I have wisdom
[1:40:37] and understand all the knowledge of God
[1:40:40] though I give my body to be burned as a
[1:40:43] sacrifice though I do all these things I
[1:40:46] am still nothing that's right but he
[1:40:49] said where there is tongues they shall
[1:40:50] cease where there's knowledge it shall
[1:40:52] vanish where there's prophecies it'll
[1:40:55] fail but when love has come the prophet
[1:40:58] said it'll endure forever he said and
[1:41:01] now what the church the Pentecostal
[1:41:03] church needs tonight along with all the
[1:41:06] other churches is a good oldfashioned
[1:41:09] baptizing of the Holy Ghost and love
[1:41:13] that will make you straighten up and get
[1:41:16] together and come together like brothers
[1:41:19] and sisters in the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:41:22] break down these walls of partition amen
[1:41:26] where there is love God is love and love
[1:41:31] suffers long love is not provoked it's
[1:41:33] not puffed up he said when you get
[1:41:35] puffed up love is
[1:41:37] gone and where there's all this malice
[1:41:40] and strife and wars and envy and so
[1:41:42] forth against each other brother God
[1:41:44] just moves out that's all and it's a
[1:41:47] fact he said you can see it amen and now
[1:41:49] you've got the right Road brother you've
[1:41:51] got the right path but what you need is
[1:41:53] to come back together again for an
[1:41:56] oldfashioned auua Street meeting yes sir
[1:41:59] where the men and women will come
[1:42:01] together in all denominations and break
[1:42:03] down their barriers and recognize one
[1:42:06] another as brothers and sisters in the
[1:42:09] Lord Jesus Christ amen amen and amen so
[1:42:13] fill your love is that realm we live in
[1:42:15] every day isn't that right so I believe
[1:42:18] that there's something that has to
[1:42:20] happen to break in on us amen in order
[1:42:23] to break us out into this love of God
[1:42:27] that we talking
[1:42:28] about something has to raise us up amen
[1:42:32] above fil Your Love raise us up above
[1:42:35] our ordinary way of seeing things that's
[1:42:39] right and of seeing each other am in
[1:42:41] this three-dimensional space something
[1:42:44] has to be above that right a dimension
[1:42:47] above that above our
[1:42:50] perspective and I believe this morning I
[1:42:53] happy love is that Dimension above us oh
[1:42:57] and to get up in there God's going to
[1:42:59] release a spirit among the bride in the
[1:43:03] last days to give her the ability to
[1:43:07] step into that realm to step into that
[1:43:10] place the prophet said we hardly have
[1:43:12] faith for Divine Healing we need a faith
[1:43:15] more than we've ever known to enter into
[1:43:18] that place and Faith work it by love oh
[1:43:22] what faith work it by forgiveness oh
[1:43:25] hallelujah hallelujah oh and only the
[1:43:29] bride could enter into there oh may God
[1:43:33] Inspire us to raise us up to get into
[1:43:37] that place as we see the day approaching
[1:43:41] am amen and amen oh my a higher Force
[1:43:46] this love a higher purpose this love
[1:43:49] it's in a higher realm we've got to be
[1:43:52] able to love the way God loves we got to
[1:43:55] able to see each other the way God sees
[1:43:57] each other and not the way we see
[1:43:59] ourselves and not the way we see other
[1:44:01] people because we filter everything by
[1:44:04] our own experience we tend to filter
[1:44:06] everything by our own idea our own
[1:44:09] opinion our own thinking man's filter oh
[1:44:12] Hallelujah but we got to have God's
[1:44:14] filter oh Hallelujah we got to be able
[1:44:16] to see it the way God sees it oh
[1:44:19] Hallelujah be able to love the way God
[1:44:21] loves oh Hallelujah not in a filar way
[1:44:25] but a love that goes past what we are
[1:44:28] past who we are isn't that right amen
[1:44:32] God put a seed in our soul because he
[1:44:35] loves us we love him because he first
[1:44:39] love us Psalms 91:14 says uh because he
[1:44:43] had set his love upon me therefore will
[1:44:46] I deliver him and I will set him on high
[1:44:50] talking about you this morning because
[1:44:52] he had known my name and he shall call
[1:44:55] upon me and I will answer him ask what
[1:45:00] you will and it shall be done unto you
[1:45:03] when you begin to get into this love you
[1:45:07] can ask what you will the prophet asked
[1:45:10] what he will and it happened we're going
[1:45:12] to get it oh hallelujah praise God and I
[1:45:15] will answer him and I will be with him
[1:45:18] in trouble I will deliver him and honor
[1:45:22] him
[1:45:23] isn't that right so we believe this
[1:45:25] morning it takes the spirit of God to
[1:45:28] produce this true brotherly kindness
[1:45:31] Spirit of forgiveness a literal spirit
[1:45:34] that comes upon you and makes you choose
[1:45:37] to love instead to love instead of hate
[1:45:41] amen and to forgive instead of of
[1:45:44] holding an art or a grudge isn't that
[1:45:47] right oh
[1:45:49] my I believe God will do it isn't that
[1:45:51] right
[1:45:54] it they're going to come a point in time
[1:45:57] when all human element will go out all
[1:46:01] of we what we are will be boiled trashed
[1:46:03] out oh that crystal clear water is going
[1:46:06] to boil the trash out of the Rock Box
[1:46:10] the confession is there but what we need
[1:46:12] is a boiling out of the trash praise God
[1:46:15] all the stuff that got left behind all
[1:46:18] the lint and all the feathers and all
[1:46:21] this dross and animosity and strife and
[1:46:25] things that happened years ago that just
[1:46:27] piled up and isn't that right we're
[1:46:31] going to have a house cleaning
[1:46:33] time amen amen long time you're looking
[1:46:36] at the dirt in the corner time to pick
[1:46:38] up your broom this morning long time
[1:46:40] you're looking at that stuff laying
[1:46:42] around there it's been piling up a long
[1:46:45] time but it's time to get that broom we
[1:46:48] got to find what we have lost oh s is
[1:46:51] this the time
[1:46:53] for the bride to have a mighty Revival
[1:46:56] for the bride to finally find brotherly
[1:46:58] kindness holy decency place in Christ oh
[1:47:02] hallelujah
[1:47:04] hallelujah oh glory glory
[1:47:08] glory
[1:47:09] amen oh my statue of a perfect man the

[1:47:20] that's a good one right here the six
[1:47:24] then seven all right he said add in
[1:47:27] brotherly kindness all right he said
[1:47:29] when we get to that brotherly kindness
[1:47:33] put yourself in his place on the matter
[1:47:37] amen talking about that brother isn't
[1:47:39] that right put yourself in his place on
[1:47:42] the matter that's what the prophet
[1:47:44] defines it as here and he says now say
[1:47:47] now you say my brother sinned against me
[1:47:49] said Peter shall I forgive him he said
[1:47:52] seven times a day day he said 70 * 7 see
[1:47:57] uh because the Jews they they operating
[1:47:58] with laws like do this three times do
[1:48:01] this do this five times and and and if
[1:48:04] it's five times we cut off point we we
[1:48:06] we take an action after five so so Peter
[1:48:09] wants to know how when we're going to
[1:48:10] take action what number we need a number
[1:48:13] we we operate him by the laws of Moses I
[1:48:16] for an I so I ready to dig out for time
[1:48:19] you say if you say it's after seven by
[1:48:21] the eth we dig in
[1:48:23] and Jesus said no 70 * 7 isn't that
[1:48:27] right hallelujah hallelujah it's
[1:48:30] impossible to reach that number but he's
[1:48:32] trying to make a point Hallelujah that
[1:48:34] it's without limit a it's more than you
[1:48:37] could
[1:48:38] number take whatever it have and
[1:48:40] multiply it seven by 70 times that is
[1:48:43] how much God wants you to love that's
[1:48:45] how much God wants you to forgive that's
[1:48:47] how much God want you to obey his word
[1:48:50] there's no number whatever number you
[1:48:52] have in your
[1:48:53] multiplied by 70 praise God amen amen
[1:48:56] hallelujah hallelujah Oh
[1:48:59] Glory oh
[1:49:02] hallelujah

[1:49:11] Tune don't be impatient with him see see
[1:49:15] just be kind to him go anyhow amen amen
[1:49:19] sometimes they're just not
[1:49:21] seeing sometimes that's not seeing it
[1:49:23] the way you seeing it you all always see
[1:49:26] eye to eye but the honey does
[1:49:29] stick the honey will
[1:49:32] stick uh uh when the when when that uh
[1:49:34] that dream sister shepher dream when the
[1:49:36] water pour in it couldn't hold in a rock
[1:49:39] Box it poured right out but the honey
[1:49:42] had to go in first and then the water
[1:49:45] could hold so the honey actually has a
[1:49:49] function that dream actually shows that
[1:49:51] the honey performs a function on the
[1:49:54] church in the last days and binds the
[1:49:56] whole thing together H isn't that right
[1:50:00] so that it could hold something isn't
[1:50:01] that right amen okay brotherly kindness
[1:50:04] now you see so if a Brother's all at a
[1:50:05] tune now don't be impatient with him see

[1:50:36] that it is in his heart that's what it
[1:50:39] is virtue in yourself to let it go out
[1:50:42] with kindness virtue is going to
[1:50:44] sangwich it in there and it's going to
[1:50:46] go out with kindness with virtue with
[1:50:48] meekness to him having faith that
[1:50:51] someday
[1:50:53] God will bring him in amen that's the
[1:50:57] mindset that's the attitude isn't that
[1:50:59] right brotherly kindness the seven Thing
[1:51:02] 1 2 3 4 5 6 then seven the prophet Taps
[1:51:05] on the choke board seven times see seven
[1:51:07] thing then now you're coming into it see
[1:51:10] and then the next thing he said add
[1:51:12] charity which is love he said that's the
[1:51:15] capping Stone isn't that right amen amen
[1:51:19] and on this message here uh when love is
[1:51:22] projected
[1:51:23] Prophet said now to show how love is
[1:51:26] projected this is you now you might
[1:51:28] laugh at this but he said it's just true
[1:51:30] as I'm standing here hallelujah one time
[1:51:33] I was out in a field when I was in a
[1:51:34] game warden and there had been a bull
[1:51:36] that had been killed by a colored man
[1:51:38] and so forth in the brook you know the
[1:51:39] story great gesy Bull and he'd been sold
[1:51:42] away to another man and he just turned
[1:51:45] him loose into the pasture and I knew
[1:51:47] that bull was there but I never thought
[1:51:49] I was over on the creek you know turning
[1:51:51] some loose fish and so on I thought a
[1:51:53] man I thought of a man that called for
[1:51:54] me to go pray for him so going up across
[1:51:57] the hill to pray for the man being about
[1:52:00] right about 3 or 400 yards from the
[1:52:01] fence in a little clump of bushes this
[1:52:03] Gacy bull was bedded down there and I
[1:52:06] got close to him and and he raised up
[1:52:09] and he was a killer I looked back to the
[1:52:11] fence it was too far for me to run he
[1:52:15] was so close to me there was no tree for
[1:52:18] me to get into it so clearly the god
[1:52:21] allowed the prophet it to leave leave
[1:52:22] the prophet's mind um about this
[1:52:25] particular Bull and he said I thought
[1:52:27] and he thought the prophet said well I
[1:52:30] thought this is the end I can't go no
[1:52:32] further for if I try to run he'll catch
[1:52:35] me so what can I do he said and now
[1:52:38] that's when we come to these
[1:52:40] crisis that when Sovereign Grace steps
[1:52:44] in then something happen in my life the
[1:52:48] prophet said I wish it would if it ever
[1:52:50] comes again that it will never leave and
[1:52:54] I only wish that there was some way I
[1:52:56] had the power this morning to project
[1:53:00] this to this group of men and women here
[1:53:03] and that it never leave you oh he's
[1:53:06] talking about something now something
[1:53:08] that came upon him in that moment of
[1:53:10] Crisis a Spirit come upon him that he
[1:53:14] said he wish he could have it all the
[1:53:15] time he wished that it would never leave
[1:53:19] isn't that right something happened
[1:53:21] there he said oh you've often wondered I
[1:53:23] guess how these things happen it's
[1:53:26] something instead of despising that man
[1:53:30] is not right oh okay sorry let me go
[1:53:31] back here he was talking about uh that
[1:53:33] that Maniac guy in Oregon right he said
[1:53:36] like when that Maniac in Oregon he ran
[1:53:37] up to the platform to kill me he said
[1:53:40] many of you read that book something
[1:53:41] happened there so he's linking it now he
[1:53:44] said now you you you you've often
[1:53:45] wondered I guess how these things happen
[1:53:48] he said but it's it's something instead
[1:53:50] of despising that man though he was
[1:53:54] there to take my life a Divine love set
[1:53:57] in for him a Divine love something come
[1:54:02] upon the prophet a Spirit come in isn't
[1:54:04] that right and he called me a hypocrite
[1:54:08] he called me a snake in the grass and
[1:54:10] thousands of people sitting there and he
[1:54:13] spit in my face Drew back his fist and
[1:54:16] said I'll break every bone in your body
[1:54:19] people probably sitting here was there
[1:54:22] he said but instead of despising the man
[1:54:26] something grace came in in a moment when
[1:54:29] I needed it Grace sets in and projected
[1:54:34] a Divine love into my heart that I could
[1:54:39] project to him oh hallelujah
[1:54:44] hallelujah oh he was just standing there
[1:54:48] when something came true oh Divine love
[1:54:51] projected into him and it came out of
[1:54:54] the prophet and unto that man oh brother
[1:54:58] do you see it now we are just a conduit
[1:55:02] for the spirit of God to be used of us
[1:55:06] mightily oh that this Divine love could
[1:55:09] project itself into US oh do you see it
[1:55:14] how cleared out we have to be in order
[1:55:17] for that Divine love to
[1:55:19] project you can't have something
[1:55:21] blocking the lens it can be a smutty
[1:55:24] lens all messed up with ideas and
[1:55:27] opinions and and experiences and stuff
[1:55:29] and stuff and stuff you got to clear
[1:55:31] that out so that when that love that
[1:55:33] perfect white light goes through the
[1:55:35] lens of your heart there's no mix up
[1:55:38] there there's no there's no muddiness
[1:55:40] there but there's just a clean clear
[1:55:43] picture a clean Clear Channel oh
[1:55:47] Hallelujah that God's Divine love that
[1:55:49] God's perfect white light can flow
[1:55:52] through you and display every one of his
[1:55:55] virtues out will come Faith out will
[1:55:58] come virtue out will come knowledge out
[1:56:01] will come
[1:56:02] Temperance when it strikes that pyramid
[1:56:05] seven perfect colors will flash like
[1:56:09] lightning oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:56:12] that's the season we're coming into now
[1:56:15] that's why we've got to clear everything
[1:56:17] out get everything out of the way cuz a
[1:56:20] Revival is coming and we want when that
[1:56:23] light comes it could project when that
[1:56:26] Divine love drops in it could project
[1:56:29] itself through US amen and to go out
[1:56:33] flow out like the prophet said flow out
[1:56:35] to others to help others along the way
[1:56:40] that's the whole
[1:56:42] purpose is not right the son of man
[1:56:44] didn't come to be ministered to they
[1:56:47] came to minister to help somebody and
[1:56:50] that's what the bride has got after have
[1:56:52] that same spirit amen praise God to
[1:56:55] reach back and help someone else isn't
[1:56:57] that right amen isn't that right okay
[1:57:01] where where am I at now he said now it
[1:57:04] it it Grace set in and projected a
[1:57:05] Divine love into my heart I love how he
[1:57:08] describes it so we get an idea now of
[1:57:11] how God is going to use us we are just
[1:57:13] in between we we we are just in between
[1:57:16] the process of God reaching the people
[1:57:20] God wants to use someone to get out that
[1:57:23] way isn't that right Hallelujah pray
[1:57:25] we're not in control God is in control
[1:57:27] and the more we surrender we just become
[1:57:29] a m members of the machine of his body
[1:57:34] but he is the Dynamics we are just the
[1:57:37] mechanics but he comes to work the
[1:57:39] mechanics his Dynamic power and sets
[1:57:43] this great machine into motion and then
[1:57:46] out comes love out comes forgiveness out
[1:57:49] comes healing out comes Deliverance
[1:57:53] amen that's what that's how it's
[1:57:55] supposed to work amen but we have to
[1:57:57] become members of this machine we have
[1:58:00] to be surrendered and honed enough to
[1:58:03] fit in our place every gear every wheel
[1:58:06] every Sprocket in its place so that it
[1:58:09] could function and serve the purpose
[1:58:11] that was meant to serve isn't that right
[1:58:16] is not right he said now Divine love
[1:58:17] projected say see he said there stands a
[1:58:20] man thinking about the man he's thinking
[1:58:22] about the maniac man while he's coming
[1:58:24] at him these are the thoughts that are
[1:58:26] going through the prophet's mind he said
[1:58:28] there stands a man a man like I am like
[1:58:32] I am he said he likes to eat and drink
[1:58:35] and his family but the devil has him
[1:58:39] bound and so the prophet said the love
[1:58:41] of God constrained me and the man
[1:58:44] humbled himself and fell across my feet
[1:58:49] the prophet said Grace steps in When
[1:58:51] Love was
[1:58:53] projected he said in the case of this
[1:58:55] bull that was trying to kill me he got
[1:58:57] up and his feet looked at me and he
[1:58:58] snorted about three or four times and
[1:59:01] throw his horns into the ground I looked
[1:59:03] around there was nothing as an officer
[1:59:06] I'm supposed to pack a gun and I
[1:59:07] wondered why I didn't have it I would
[1:59:10] have killed the bull and went and paid
[1:59:13] for it the prophet said but I had no gun
[1:59:16] and God seeing to it that I had no gun
[1:59:20] he wanted to show his divine grace in a
[1:59:24] crisis hour and something struck me way
[1:59:29] better than a gun or any weapon of this
[1:59:32] world it was the divine grace that took
[1:59:36] my heart and thinking of that animal
[1:59:39] look at again Watch he wanted to live
[1:59:41] the same way I wanted to
[1:59:43] live so we see a pattern here now every
[1:59:46] time the prophet begin to put himself in
[1:59:48] the place of the thing something begins
[1:59:51] to happen
[1:59:53] something going to take place it shift
[1:59:56] from the natural every time he put
[1:59:58] himself in his brother's place on the
[2:00:00] matter or put himself in the place of
[2:00:01] the thing or the animal or whatever it
[2:00:03] was something begin to shift in the
[2:00:05] Supernatural God begin to work on
[2:00:09] that what we need is a shift this
[2:00:11] morning a shift in our thinking a shift
[2:00:14] in our mindset that Divine love praise
[2:00:17] God could could could project itself and
[2:00:20] Grace could step in Grace not just for
[2:00:23] you but for your brother for your Fallen
[2:00:25] sister for for someone who may be
[2:00:29] struggling they say that hurt people
[2:00:31] hurt people it's because they are hurt
[2:00:34] is why they go around hurting others
[2:00:37] they themselves have hurts that have not
[2:00:39] been healed they themselves have wounds
[2:00:42] that have not been addressed sometimes
[2:00:44] someone might turn roughly to you but
[2:00:47] you don't know what's happening behind
[2:00:49] the curtain you don't know what's
[2:00:51] happening behind the scenes and if you
[2:00:53] would spend a day with them you might
[2:00:56] get a better picture of what they have
[2:00:58] to face and why in that moment praise
[2:01:02] God they might have done something that
[2:01:03] offended you we've got to think on a
[2:01:06] higher level praise God hallelujah isn't
[2:01:08] that right sometimes people just can't
[2:01:10] see amen they they they might claim to
[2:01:13] have eyes but they they're really not
[2:01:14] seeing where they going they they're not
[2:01:17] seeing that there's a better way they're
[2:01:18] not seeing that there's a more excellent
[2:01:21] way there's not seeing that there's a a
[2:01:23] better approach or that there's a better
[2:01:25] example to follow they're only going
[2:01:28] with what they think they know they only
[2:01:30] going where what they hope will work oh
[2:01:32] Hallelujah and we've got to intercede
[2:01:35] for them and pray for that brother pray
[2:01:39] for that sister that somehow by the
[2:01:42] grace of God God would open their eyes
[2:01:45] to
[2:01:48] see Elijah couldn't open gazi's eyes he
[2:01:52] G has he was frightened he he came and
[2:01:54] said I see the hosts around us and and I
[2:01:57] don't know what's going on and I'm
[2:01:58] frightened Elijah couldn't do it on his
[2:02:00] own he so he said Lord open this boy's
[2:02:04] eyes so that he could see what's really
[2:02:07] going on and and and and when God opened
[2:02:10] his eyes all of a sudden he saw
[2:02:12] something that that that he didn't see
[2:02:14] before he he saw Chariots of Fire he he
[2:02:17] saw Angelic hosts surrounding them there
[2:02:21] there was a big Army outside of the army
[2:02:24] that they saw there was a natural Army
[2:02:26] there but there's a supernatural Army
[2:02:29] this morning that's got your back oh
[2:02:32] hallelujah
[2:02:38] hallelujah amen
[2:02:41] amen there's more for us than there's
[2:02:44] against
[2:02:45] us but sometimes we just don't see these
[2:02:48] things we we walking around in the
[2:02:50] natural walking around in this filo love
[2:02:53] anointing with what we are familiar with
[2:02:56] uh and sometimes we fail to see and if
[2:02:58] God don't open our eyes uh we won't see
[2:03:01] the bigger picture but sometimes love
[2:03:04] has to do that love has to open us up to
[2:03:07] understand the bigger picture of what's
[2:03:09] going on God told job he said where was
[2:03:12] thou when I laid the foundations of the
[2:03:15] Earth when the morning Stars sang
[2:03:17] together when the sons of God shouted
[2:03:20] for Joy where were you you Hallelujah I
[2:03:23] am the god that is in charge of the seas
[2:03:26] in charge of the Sands in charge of the
[2:03:28] waters I set my decree that the water
[2:03:31] could go no further that the firmament
[2:03:34] of the heaven will be separated from the
[2:03:36] sea god is in charge of all these things
[2:03:39] and he's in charge of you this morning
[2:03:42] if God is running all these
[2:03:44] systems parallel and nothing is in each
[2:03:48] other's way or chaotic then there surely
[2:03:52] an intelligence behind all that and if
[2:03:54] the intelligence that is behind all that
[2:03:56] is going on surely you in your little
[2:04:00] situation God knows what's going on with
[2:04:02] you this morning he knows that you're
[2:04:05] going to come into your time come into
[2:04:08] your season and he's only testing you to
[2:04:11] see if you go all the way to see if you
[2:04:14] will take one more step forgetting all
[2:04:18] the things that are passed and press on
[2:04:21] to the the mark for the prize for the
[2:04:24] high calling in Christ Jesus amen amen
[2:04:28] and amen oh my see he he and said Grace
[2:04:31] stepped in When Love Was projected it
[2:04:33] was divine love that that took my heart
[2:04:35] see he said and instead of hating him
[2:04:39] hating the bull that was planning to
[2:04:41] take my life he said I loved him he said
[2:04:44] that sounds juvenile but it's the truth
[2:04:48] and as he rushed towards me I said
[2:04:49] creature of God I I am the servant of
[2:04:52] God I am on a legitimate call to a man
[2:04:55] who's dying and all Creator sent me and
[2:04:57] I'm sorry to disturb you out of your
[2:04:59] rest but in the name of he who created
[2:05:02] us both go over and lay down under the
[2:05:06] tree and when he got so close to me
[2:05:09] within 10 ft I was no more scared of
[2:05:13] that animal then that I would be of my
[2:05:16] brethren here this morning oh my love
[2:05:20] made it familiar
[2:05:23] oh love Bridge a
[2:05:25] gap Divine love Bridge a gap between him
[2:05:29] and this animal wow what an example he
[2:05:33] said and now uh come Divine love perfect
[2:05:36] love he said cast out all fear and he
[2:05:39] stopped and he he just looked so
[2:05:41] depleted he looked both ways he turned
[2:05:43] around walked over and laid down under
[2:05:47] that tree and I walked in three feet of
[2:05:49] him passed by through the field safely
[2:05:52] Prophet said when love is projected
[2:05:55] Divine Sovereign Grace of God takes a
[2:05:58] hold he said one day he was mowing his
[2:06:00] yard he's mowing in the front and he cut
[2:06:01] a few rounds and so forth he's talking
[2:06:03] about those bees he said I pulled off my
[2:06:04] shirt try to take a few more rounds
[2:06:06] while nobody was at the house way down
[2:06:08] in the corner of the fence I forgot that
[2:06:09] there was a hornet nest down there and I
[2:06:12] ran this electric mow into the fence and
[2:06:14] it shook those Hornets me with no shirt
[2:06:17] on and and you know what Hornets are and
[2:06:20] they were all over me just in a second
[2:06:23] very angry one of them can kill you
[2:06:26] sting in the head in the top of the head
[2:06:28] and so forth isn't that right and so in
[2:06:30] that crisis in that moment he said when
[2:06:33] I was standing helpless then Sovereign
[2:06:37] Grace took a hold and something happened
[2:06:41] oh May Sovereign Grace take a hold here
[2:06:43] this morning we need that to sweep in
[2:06:47] make all the wrongs right cover a
[2:06:49] multitude of sins sweep away the Refuge
[2:06:52] of Lies We need that to sweep in love
[2:06:55] for your brother love for your Fallen

[2:07:01] and sees the truth that we are all God's
[2:07:04] children we might be a little messed up

[2:07:09] twisted up in some ways all of us need
[2:07:13] Jesus we all need the Lord people need

[2:07:34] supply all our needs according to his
[2:07:36] riches and Glory he's able to straighten
[2:07:39] us out to help us give us the right
[2:07:42] Spirit give us the right
[2:07:47] attitude oh Hallelujah so that Divine
[2:07:50] love could
[2:07:52] could have its perfect
[2:07:53] work amen I'm in among Our Lives isn't
[2:07:56] that right Grace took a hold and
[2:07:59] something happen he said and as kiddish
[2:08:01] as it may seem I love those little
[2:08:05] creatures and and they I thought they
[2:08:08] were in their nest God in his wisdom he
[2:08:11] put them there for some purpose and they
[2:08:13] were in their nest and I Disturbed them
[2:08:17] oh my see bring out humility
[2:08:21] right here's the mindset and they come
[2:08:23] they never come disturbing me he said I
[2:08:25] disturb them and I said little creatures
[2:08:28] of God I am the servant of God and I'm
[2:08:31] trying to pray for his sick children
[2:08:33] I've got to mow my grass and I Disturbed
[2:08:36] you and I'm sorry I did this and I love
[2:08:40] you and if you mean it'll work you can't
[2:08:43] fool a bee Prophet said if you can fool
[2:08:45] or be how much more a man you got to
[2:08:48] have what you are talking about you have
[2:08:51] have to know in other words it can't be
[2:08:53] a fake love it can't be a put on love
[2:08:57] it's got to be real what you say and
[2:08:59] what's in your heart must be in
[2:09:01] alignment and then something happens he
[2:09:04] said I said little creatures of God go
[2:09:06] back into your nest and watch and I I'll
[2:09:08] not disturb you anymore covered with
[2:09:10] hornets and as I have to meet God at the
[2:09:12] day of judgment and you people he said
[2:09:14] those Hornets swarmed two or three times
[2:09:16] and took one and one took a beline and
[2:09:19] every one of them went right back in the
[2:09:22] nest in the name of Jesus Christ by the
[2:09:25] grace of conquering love amen amen
[2:09:29] hallelujah we believe it hallelujah
[2:09:33] amen my amen so I read those situations
[2:09:36] to just show us a picture all right that
[2:09:39] the prophet actively when this Divine
[2:09:41] love come down that's right something
[2:09:44] happened it shifted the mindset amen
[2:09:47] shifted the attitude shifted the way he
[2:09:49] saw it you would normally see it like
[2:09:52] that but when it come to the crisis hour
[2:09:55] when it come to the the the the Press oh

[2:11:32] it's the law of grace and grace is unmar
[2:11:36] favor undeserved we didn't deserve it
[2:11:40] but Grace stepped in we just supposed to
[2:11:43] die we were supposed to die to death oh
[2:11:46] that Christ died on the cross we were
[2:11:48] supposed to hang on that cross but ver
[2:11:51] he said no I'll not let you go I'll not
[2:11:55] let you die oh I'll take your place and
[2:11:59] God provided a sacrifice God provided a
[2:12:04] substitute for our sins oh I ought to be
[2:12:07] the happiest man in the world that God
[2:12:11] reached down his hand for me I was lost
[2:12:15] and
[2:12:17] undone oh without God and his son when
[2:12:23] he reached down his hand for me he
[2:12:26] reached down his hand for you therefore
[2:12:28] I ought to love you the way that Christ
[2:12:31] love you because he loved me and he
[2:12:34] loved you oh hallelujah hallelujah oh if
[2:12:38] we walk in the light we have Fellowship

[2:12:43] Hallelujah glory to God

[2:12:50] cleanses us from all sin oh
[2:12:54] my Prophet said we've got to have
[2:12:55] something common to Fellowship about and
[2:12:58] the blood of God the blood of Jesus
[2:13:00] makes a common ground upon which we can
[2:13:03] say there is my brother Hallelujah there
[2:13:05] is my sister we can shake
[2:13:07] hands on that Common Ground the blood
[2:13:10] brings us all down to one level rich or
[2:13:13] poor bonded or free don't care how much
[2:13:16] money you have in your pocket you'd be
[2:13:18] lost without Jesus I'd be lost without
[2:13:22] Jesus and if God could forgive me oh in
[2:13:25] my rotness in my selfishness in my in my
[2:13:28] undeserved state then how much more
[2:13:31] could I love you how much more I ought
[2:13:33] to love you if he loved me that much oh
[2:13:36] Hallelujah and if he forgave me that
[2:13:38] much oh hallelujah how ought I we to
[2:13:40] love one
[2:13:41] another because love is of God Amen and
[2:13:46] amen so when Divine love projects
[2:13:49] Sovereign Grace takes his place oh I
[2:13:50] think we Struck it now amen wonderful
[2:13:53] let's just kind of see if you could wind
[2:13:55] down here now oh it's been wonderful
[2:13:57] isn't that right my so there is
[2:13:59] therefore now no
[2:14:00] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[2:14:03] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[2:14:05] after the spirit for the law of the
[2:14:07] spirit of life in Christ Jesus makes us
[2:14:11] free from the law of sin and death for
[2:14:14] what the law couldn't do it was that it
[2:14:16] was weak through the flesh God send in
[2:14:18] his own son and the likeness of sinful
[2:14:21] flesh for sin condemned sin in the flesh
[2:14:25] so that the righteousness of the law
[2:14:28] might be fulfilled in us who walk not
[2:14:30] after the flesh but after the spirit
[2:14:33] isn't that right so on Blasphemous names
[2:14:35] wanted to touch on that dream real quick
[2:14:37] he said but what this man who was
[2:14:38] pouring the water the messenger to the
[2:14:40] church Prophet is interpreting the dream
[2:14:42] he said the messenger to the church was
[2:14:44] the man pouring the water pouring the
[2:14:46] message into the church but what was the
[2:14:48] water doing it was boiling out all the
[2:14:51] trash that was in it Hallelujah he said
[2:14:53] that's what the Holy Spirit does boils
[2:14:56] it up now now the honey represented
[2:14:59] Brotherly Love brotherly kindness which
[2:15:02] is this age he said I've got just got
[2:15:05] through telling see of Brotherly
[2:15:06] kindness the age that we live in now now
[2:15:09] you might say now I look I sure don't
[2:15:11] like brother Neville or I sure don't
[2:15:13] like brother Jones or I don't like
[2:15:15] brother so and so and something like
[2:15:16] that he said but just let something
[2:15:18] happen to him brother your heart is
[2:15:22] broke it just nearly killed you see we
[2:15:25] can obtain brotherly kindness and a
[2:15:28] feeling one for another see but to
[2:15:31] maintain in a group of people he said so
[2:15:33] so now why do you care for that brother
[2:15:35] because you broke bread with him he had
[2:15:37] the altar as you will tonight you you
[2:15:38] fellowship with him you shook his hands
[2:15:41] you worshiped with him he's your brother
[2:15:43] and he might do something in the flesh
[2:15:46] that you would disagree with because you
[2:15:49] just kind of say well you know which you
[2:15:51] ought not to do and maybe you might shun
[2:15:53] him a little but in the bottom of your
[2:15:56] heart if something happened to that
[2:15:59] brother it would just nearly kill you or
[2:16:02] that sister he said he said I'm an old
[2:16:04] man I was once young now I'm old Prophet
[2:16:06] said and I've seen it down through the
[2:16:08] age I've seen it do that people hear
[2:16:11] hear people say I won't have no more to
[2:16:13] do with him and then something happened
[2:16:15] to that man it nearly kills him he
[2:16:18] thinks oh God I let my precious brother
[2:16:22] go oh it's it's real amen without making
[2:16:26] friends with him you see see it's
[2:16:28] brotherly love it look like it won't
[2:16:31] stick but it does stick the honey it
[2:16:37] sticks it sticks oh hallelujah it's
[2:16:40] going to stick oh hallelujah hallelujah
[2:16:44] it's got to stick that's what it does
[2:16:47] amen that's what the honey will do this
[2:16:49] brotherly kindness is getting ready to
[2:16:51] pour out upon us it's going to stick now
[2:16:53] in so much that she came from here down
[2:16:56] the hill to the bottom of the hill now
[2:16:57] this glorious water was gushing over the
[2:17:01] hills in five streams and he said now
[2:17:03] five is a number of Grace JS us f a i t
[2:17:07] h g r a c e c five is the number of
[2:17:10] Grace five streams are was pouring up
[2:17:12] out here at the trough uh uh down
[2:17:14] through here he said that each one of
[2:17:16] these ages had that rock
[2:17:18] confession the Saints are sleeping he
[2:17:21] said they're waiting waiting waiting see
[2:17:24] Hallelujah sorry excuse me waiting see
[2:17:27] until this age he said but soon the Holy
[2:17:30] Ghost being poured out from Christ will
[2:17:34] come and will seal up the church and
[2:17:38] then the church will be raptured it'll
[2:17:41] be a complete unit of God a bride for
[2:17:45] Christ that's what we're coming into Now
[2:17:47] isn't that right who will be the head of
[2:17:49] all things he said You Follow Me Now
[2:17:52] congregation says amen said now she was
[2:17:54] wondering now in Her Dream she was
[2:17:56] wondering with this little stream would
[2:17:58] this stream ever get to the bottom see
[2:18:01] it was drying up now being that she
[2:18:04] herself she said now here's what I want
[2:18:05] to get to you now she herself was
[2:18:06] wondering about herself did she have the
[2:18:08] Holy Ghost and he said now I Shan in
[2:18:10] saying this a few minutes ago he said
[2:18:12] thinking the church would be spiritual
[2:18:13] enough and so on he said but watch he
[2:18:14] said now he said but you could speak
[2:18:16] with tongues you could shout you could
[2:18:18] dance you could cast out devils and do
[2:18:20] anything you want to do and still not
[2:18:22] have the Holy Ghost didn't them
[2:18:25] disciples come back rejoicing and
[2:18:26] shouting because the devils are subject
[2:18:28] to them did not Jesus say in that day
[2:18:31] when he come that many will come to me
[2:18:32] and say Lord have I not cast out devils
[2:18:35] in your name done Mighty works and I'll
[2:18:37] say depart from me you workers of
[2:18:39] iniquity I didn't know you those things
[2:18:42] are not indication of the Holy Spirit by
[2:18:44] he said by their fruit you shall know
[2:18:46] them he said but now you say brother
[2:18:48] brandom do we should we speak inong
[2:18:51] absolutely that is gifts of God but
[2:18:54] those gifts of God without these virtues
[2:18:57] in them makes a stumbling block to the
[2:19:01] unbeliever it is not accepted by godall
[2:19:05] this has to be
[2:19:07] first and when you have faith and virtue
[2:19:10] and knowledge and Temperance patience
[2:19:13] godliness and brotherly love then the
[2:19:15] Holy Ghost comes down and seals you as a
[2:19:18] unit the musician can get get to come up
[2:19:21] now amen and same as he seals the church
[2:19:24] ages as a unit the way he makes his
[2:19:28] bride is the way he makes his
[2:19:31] individual they're made out of the same
[2:19:35] material like Eve was made out of Adam's
[2:19:38] side isn't that right here is the things
[2:19:40] that you have to have
[2:19:43] first you can't impersonate them you
[2:19:46] can't imitate them they've got to be
[2:19:50] God's
[2:19:51] oh that's why we say it can be a human
[2:19:54] Temperance or a human patience it's got
[2:19:57] to be God sent and God born imitation he
[2:20:02] said only causes confusion sir he said
[2:20:05] it's like I said you could imagine
[2:20:06] seeing a buzzard setting here with a
[2:20:07] dove feather stuck in his wings and say
[2:20:09] see I'm a dove he said but he's not a
[2:20:12] dove he's a buzzard vulture see could
[2:20:14] you imagine some black bird with a
[2:20:15] peacock feather saying I'm a peacock he
[2:20:17] said that's just something he stuck in
[2:20:19] see but it has to come from the inside
[2:20:23] out and it produces this produces
[2:20:27] Christianity God by the power of the
[2:20:30] Holy Spirit and he said and here now now
[2:20:32] get this lesson here's what's wrong he
[2:20:34] said when I turn on this here's what's
[2:20:36] wrong with brandom Tabernacle yeah he
[2:20:37] says it here he said you see there's two
[2:20:39] different kinds of Faith there's two
[2:20:41] different kinds of virtue and I had it
[2:20:43] the other day two different kinds of
[2:20:44] knowledge two different kind of
[2:20:45] temperance one thinks it's prohibition
[2:20:48] that they got staining from from alcohol
[2:20:50] and stuff like that he said but that's
[2:20:52] not the kind of temperance that God's
[2:20:53] talking about it's that ungodly
[2:20:57] uncontrollable temper you got and things
[2:20:59] of that side fast back fast and so forth
[2:21:01] like that patience and so forth he said
[2:21:03] there's a mockery of it a pretending to
[2:21:05] be a nature given Faith a nature given
[2:21:08] virtue there's a nature given Temperance
[2:21:10] all these things are nature given and
[2:21:12] the biggest part of our faith is mental
[2:21:14] feate by hearing the word it bring us
[2:21:16] into a mental recognition of God see all
[2:21:19] of this is is human
[2:21:21] you see isn't that right and but he said
[2:21:24] but if this coming from above he said oh
[2:21:28] brother if it ever strikes this he said
[2:21:32] then there's a Godly spiritual fate then
[2:21:36] what does that Faith do that Faith
[2:21:38] recognizes only the word oh it won't
[2:21:42] recognize anything else but the word of
[2:21:45] God whatever God says that when it
[2:21:48] strikes that it will only recognize the
[2:21:51] word what did he say she will have thus
[2:21:53] sayeth the Lord or she'll keep still
[2:21:56] when these virtues are in her oh she'll
[2:21:59] produce Christ oh Hallelujah she'll walk
[2:22:02] with god oh hallelujah hallelujah she'll
[2:22:05] move when he moves she'll act when
[2:22:07] she'll act Spirit of his Spirit oh flesh
[2:22:11] of his flesh isn't that right the word
[2:22:13] made flesh oh I'm getting ready to wind
[2:22:14] out now amen oh you've been wonderful
[2:22:16] praise God Amen so let me finish this up
[2:22:19] here nowah he said it it gets a Godly
[2:22:21] Faith that's what the faith do it only
[2:22:23] recognize the word no matter what
[2:22:25] anything else says it only recognizes
[2:22:27] the word because in the beginning was
[2:22:29] the word and the Word was with God Amen
[2:22:31] and the Word was God and the word is
[2:22:34] still God Amen and the Word was made
[2:22:37] flesh and dwelt Among Us and when the
[2:22:39] word itself is pouring into our faith
[2:22:42] our mental Faith becomes a spiritual
[2:22:44] Revelation and upon this Foundation I'll
[2:22:47] build my church see not upon a mental
[2:22:50] conception of church joining a mental
[2:22:52] conception of that but upon the
[2:22:54] Revelation when them streams of Grace
[2:22:57] has poured into that mental faith that
[2:23:00] you've got then upon this a spiritual
[2:23:03] Revelation he said I'll build my church
[2:23:06] and the gates of hell can't Prevail
[2:23:09] against it see that shows that they
[2:23:11] would be against it but it'll never
[2:23:13] Prevail oh what a glorious thing now we
[2:23:17] see that fith coming in isn't that right
[2:23:20] oh Hallelujah glory to God the prophet
[2:23:23] said I'm perfect Faith you could please
[2:23:24] some softly faith is based on
[2:23:25] forgiveness then and as we said here
[2:23:28] this morning we're trying to get the
[2:23:30] church into a place where we could
[2:23:32] really see Apostolic times moving Among
[2:23:34] Us that's what we all hunger for and
[2:23:37] it's just laying right at the door we
[2:23:40] see it but we want to see more of it we
[2:23:43] want it to flow such a flow that it'll
[2:23:46] help us that it will flow out to others
[2:23:50] isn't that right oh hallelujah
[2:23:53] hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Amen
[2:23:57] do you love him oh H one more quote here
[2:24:00] and we'll just close out with this on
[2:24:02] Elijah the prophet said now everybody
[2:24:03] wants to be loved I tell you the truth I
[2:24:05] do I want God to love me I want the
[2:24:08] people to love me that's exactly the
[2:24:10] truth he said and if God loves me then
[2:24:12] the people will love me and if I love
[2:24:14] his people then he will love me for
[2:24:16] doing it God would rather I love you
[2:24:19] than love him did you know that I'd
[2:24:22] rather you love my boy back there no
[2:24:24] matter what you say about me I want you
[2:24:27] to love my
[2:24:28] children any father would think that and
[2:24:31] so father God thinks the same thing he
[2:24:35] said in so much as you have done to the
[2:24:36] least of these my little ones you have
[2:24:38] did it unto me and so if you want to
[2:24:41] love God just start loving all of his
[2:24:43] children you could begin to stand and
[2:24:46] God will reward you if you just love his
[2:24:49] children that show that the love of God
[2:24:51] is in you Jesus said that's the way that
[2:24:53] all the people ought to know that you're
[2:24:55] the children of God and pass from Death
[2:24:57] onto life when you have loved one for
[2:25:00] another then you'll know it not because
[2:25:02] you have a big church that's all right
[2:25:05] but just because you you have lot of
[2:25:06] fine ministers come by that's good too
[2:25:09] but it's because you have love one for
[2:25:12] another may God richly bless you this
