[50:37] [Music]
[50:47] god bless you good morning if you have a
[50:52] Bibles and lecture invite attention to
[50:55] Genesis 1 and sin Luke chapter 4 Genesis
[51:10] 1
[51:11] I'll read verse 26 through verse 28
[51:15] I'm sure the scripture we all know very
[51:18] well certainly many of us can really you
[51:21] know without eyes closed but let's go
[51:26] and God said let us make man in our
[51:32] image after our likeness and let them
[51:36] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[51:38] and over the fowl of the air and over
[51:42] the cattle and over all the earth and
[51:44] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[51:46] upon the earth so God created man in his
[51:49] own image and the image of God created
[51:51] he him male and female created he them
[51:54] and God blessed them and God said unto
[51:58] them be fruitful and multiply and
[52:00] replenish the earth and subdue it and
[52:04] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[52:06] and over the fowl of the air and over
[52:08] every living thing that moveth upon the
[52:11] earth amen syn look when it's you
[52:24] you know really pretty
[52:26] lengthen portion from there you know the
[52:30] Bible said that I got some Conda
[52:33] scriptures which I'll show you in a
[52:34] minute but the Bible said that Jesus
[52:37] Christ as a son lent obedience by the
[52:43] things that he suffered so Harry is one
[52:50] of those scriptures as a matter fact a
[52:52] major one where Jesus Christ is reigning
[52:55] obedience now when you see that when you
[52:59] read that it doesn't mean he was
[53:01] disobedient and then he he had to suffer
[53:05] to lend to know like that if you do know
[53:07] you you know that somebody means that's
[53:10] what it means it means that the things
[53:13] that is suffered the challenge is the
[53:16] things that came across his path his
[53:19] suffering his pains the circumstances he
[53:24] learned that obey the word under those
[53:27] circumstances really pays off every
[53:31] circumstance every challenge everything
[53:33] that happened let him understand was an
[53:35] experience was an opportunity for him to
[53:38] learn the way you obey the word those
[53:42] circumstances have got to obey the word
[53:44] also that's what it means
[53:47] amen so your challenges your
[53:49] circumstances is not a kill you but an
[53:52] opportunity to learn obedience to land
[53:56] that this world works
[53:58] this word every circumstance in my life
[54:02] will abate if I obey the word and let
[54:06] the word have his way the circumstances
[54:09] have no choice but to obey the word
[54:11] here's the master of every circumstance
[54:14] he speaks and every circumstance stands
[54:18] at attention the master is here
[54:22] watch how Jesus Christ as a son and is I
[54:25] example citizen how he learned obedience
[54:31] by every circumstance every pain every
[54:34] suffering every temptation every
[54:37] challenge so look for verse one array
[54:42] through 22 is the lengthen one but I'll
[54:44] try to run through it and Jesus been
[54:48] full of the Holy Ghost returned from
[54:51] Jordan and was led by the spirit into
[54:54] the wilderness being forty days tempted
[54:57] of the devil those are the things he's
[55:00] suffered your temptations your
[55:04] sufferings amen I mean those days he did
[55:09] even nothing and when they were ended he
[55:11] afterward hungered and the devil said
[55:14] unto Him when he appeared most
[55:16] vulnerable if thou be the Son of God
[55:19] command these stones that will be made
[55:23] bread and jesus answered him saying it
[55:26] is written learning obedience to the
[55:30] word obeyed the word himself and took
[55:33] the word to apply to the situation to
[55:35] the temptation to the suffering knowing
[55:38] that every temptation every sin every
[55:41] situation will obey the Word of God and
[55:44] you are learning their obedience is
[55:47] better than sacrifice amen and Jesus
[55:54] said it is written the man shall not
[55:57] live by bread alone but by every word of
[56:00] God the devil is not done yet your
[56:04] traditions are not done yet
[56:06] your challenges your sufferings are not
[56:07] your pins are not done yet and the devil
[56:11] take him up an high mountain should on
[56:14] to him all the kingdoms of the world in
[56:16] a moment of time you know like you know
[56:18] flash in your mind your thoughts your
[56:20] thinking paths and your thinking process
[56:22] just shows you everything in a moment of
[56:25] camp what you could be how you can you
[56:28] know just just take a chance and
[56:30] compromise on that what a little bit or
[56:32] do something that nobody sees it
[56:34] you know just do something it doesn't
[56:36] matter a Kurd understands and the
[56:38] movement of time just shows him and in
[56:40] his mind in his thoughts because you're
[56:43] he presents you as a third God does and
[56:45] the devil also presents you as a thought
[56:48] amen and showed him all the kingdoms of
[56:54] the world in a moment of time and the
[56:57] devil said unto him all this power will
[57:00] I give thee and the glory of them for
[57:05] that is deliver and to me and to
[57:06] whomsoever I will I give it you think
[57:10] that they ever don't know scripture I
[57:12] will give them to you
[57:14] not just that and the glory of them now
[57:19] you know man had fallen from the glory
[57:21] of God so the devil was sniffing that
[57:25] this man here is come to restore man
[57:27] back to the glory of God so you wanted
[57:30] him to a king that pouria book because
[57:32] that Steve that that glory of God is not
[57:36] gonna be funny for him when man comes
[57:38] right back to that glorious Adam having
[57:41] the gun of Eden the devil knows he's in
[57:43] big trouble then you think the devil is
[57:45] in trouble now wait until adopted sons
[57:48] begin to rise up and the devil knows
[57:51] they called sleeves this man had a lot
[57:54] to do with it
[57:55] so exchanged one glory for another glory
[57:59] my glory is way down the road don't know
[58:01] that I'll give you this glory right now
[58:03] the glory of the majesty to own all of
[58:06] these things here everybody in the world
[58:08] worships you great temptation pain
[58:18] suffering do I do I not do I do I not
[58:24] but submit to the obedience to the world
[58:27] submission to the world under the
[58:29] control of the world father not my will
[58:36] but thine be done
[58:38] no I won't take what the devil's telling
[58:40] me I will take what your word says
[58:44] I'd be obedient to their word and he
[58:51] found strength and virtue
[58:53] once he submitted to the control of the
[58:55] world like that now what the gracious
[58:57] words that came out of his mouth and
[59:01] jesus answered and 17 get thee behind me
[59:04] Satan for it is written thou shalt
[59:09] worship the Lord thy God and him only
[59:12] shalt thou serve finding strength in the
[59:15] word for every one of your situations a
[59:18] man been in obedience to that will let
[59:21] the world step out of the way they
[59:22] really give both the prompts that they
[59:24] still learn how to get yourself out of
[59:25] the way and let the word way
[59:29] the what fight
[59:32] feed a champion of love amen
[59:38] verse nine not done yet more suffering
[59:44] and he brought him to Jerusalem and set
[59:47] him on a pinnacle of the temple and said
[59:50] unto him if thou be the Son of God cast
[59:54] doubt cast thyself down from thence from
[59:57] there just cast yourself down for and
[1:00:07] for it is written verse 10 he shall give
[1:00:11] his angels charge over thee to keep thee
[1:00:13] so is a war of courts now of course the
[1:00:18] devil lands fast here lent the thing
[1:00:21] that would you know you'll learn what
[1:00:23] you're opening doors people who do those
[1:00:25] things I'll get to in a minute people
[1:00:27] who do those things know like that you
[1:00:29] have to learn what the competition is
[1:00:31] doing and I can if he wins I mean and
[1:00:35] he's walking don't be don't don't be
[1:00:37] proud copy it as bona fide you can make
[1:00:39] it better and that's what the devil did
[1:00:42] here real powerful tactics so this thing
[1:00:44] is working against him this man is
[1:00:47] bringing in the world the world the
[1:00:48] world so let me also bring you the world
[1:00:51] so he went into the world not that he
[1:00:54] respects the one he has no respect
[1:00:56] whatsoever for the world but just the
[1:00:58] water got too used to manipulate too
[1:01:01] cheap to deceive that's what he was
[1:01:03] about
[1:01:05] but he modern marriage match this was
[1:01:08] not any man this was a man that had been
[1:01:12] trained to let obedience by the things
[1:01:15] that he suffers to know that every
[1:01:18] temptation every trial every pain every
[1:01:21] every circumstance that seem so calm
[1:01:24] against you is an opportunity by God to
[1:01:27] learn obedience to learn that the work
[1:01:30] does work that what God says he will do
[1:01:33] and when you learn this time around next
[1:01:36] time it becomes easier to believe
[1:01:38] that's what it is here these what works
[1:01:41] this word works amen so that there will
[1:01:47] begin a quote to war of course that's
[1:01:51] why we don't get into any oh of course
[1:01:52] in anybody but the Panem said it would
[1:01:56] believe it
[1:01:57] that's arrows eighty if we are still
[1:02:00] searching keep on searching move on man
[1:02:02] go on Simon we have found a man our
[1:02:05] resting place in the revealed Word of
[1:02:08] God sent from that from God through that
[1:02:11] great larger prophet malachi for for it
[1:02:15] is written he shall give his angels
[1:02:17] charge over thee to keep thee very smart
[1:02:20] you know all those things you remove
[1:02:22] something from me there is no other ways
[1:02:27] then you check this way I'm trying to
[1:02:30] jump from the pinnacle here father is
[1:02:33] this your way is this your will I want
[1:02:37] to be obedient to every word and go see
[1:02:40] my son not my way not my will but Jesus
[1:02:48] was the word himself and that's why you
[1:02:51] are getting to to keep thee removed in
[1:02:56] other ways and in their hands they shall
[1:03:00] bear thee up lest at any time thou dash
[1:03:03] thy foot against a stone and Jesus
[1:03:06] answering said unto Him it is said thou
[1:03:10] shalt not tempt the LORD thy God and
[1:03:15] when the devil arraigned there is all
[1:03:17] the temptation he departed from him for
[1:03:20] a season but he learned some more things
[1:03:23] to know that this what works befits the
[1:03:25] devil any time under any condition even
[1:03:29] when you are weak and vulnerable like
[1:03:31] Jesus was it would always defeat the
[1:03:34] devil amen verse 14 and Jesus returning
[1:03:38] the power of the spirit into Galilee and
[1:03:42] then one of the fame of him through all
[1:03:45] the region round about and he taught in
[1:03:48] their synagogues being glorified of all
[1:03:52] and it came to Nazareth where he had
[1:03:53] been brought up and as his custom was he
[1:03:56] went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day
[1:03:58] and stood up for to read and there was
[1:04:01] delivered unto him the book of the
[1:04:02] Prophet Isaiah's and when he had opened
[1:04:03] the book he found the place where it was
[1:04:06] written the Spirit of the Lord is upon
[1:04:09] me because he anointed me to preach the
[1:04:11] are to preach the gospel to the poor he
[1:04:14] has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[1:04:16] preach deliverance to the captives and
[1:04:19] recovery of sight to the blind to set at
[1:04:21] liberty them that are bruised to preach
[1:04:25] the acceptable year of the Lord
[1:04:27] and he left out on the day of vengeance
[1:04:30] of our God which in all those news Bible
[1:04:32] readers message students Obama because
[1:04:34] there was no is rightly dividing the
[1:04:36] world I'm making the word present tense
[1:04:38] because the day event declaring the day
[1:04:41] of vengeance was left to these end time
[1:04:43] bright and he closed the book and he
[1:04:46] gave it again to the minister and sat
[1:04:48] down and the eyes of all of them the one
[1:04:50] the synagogue were thrusting on him
[1:04:52] that's why I believe when you come a
[1:04:54] church leave all this side talk thrust
[1:04:57] in your eyes and him not the missile
[1:04:59] appropriate but the word that's been
[1:05:01] spoken because Jesus Christ is the
[1:05:04] mystery of God every word every mystery
[1:05:07] revealed amen
[1:05:10] and he began to say unto them this day
[1:05:12] is this scripture fulfilled in your ears
[1:05:16] and all bear him witnessing now one that
[1:05:19] I have the gracious words which
[1:05:20] proceeded out of his mouth amen

[1:10:25] I'm just trying to talk to you
[1:10:27] and on this is a bit of control this
[1:10:30] morning now control that say what that
[1:10:36] are fun very intriguing for a long time
[1:10:39] especially as it comes and applies to
[1:10:42] you know Christianity I said this was in
[1:10:45] the message because we are all here we
[1:10:48] all about control now you may not
[1:10:50] understand I believe that but I let you
[1:10:51] see that in a few minutes we heard all
[1:10:53] about control that's why you were here
[1:10:55] that's one here that's why we get a
[1:10:57] church that's why we do the things that
[1:11:00] we do if we really mean to be in the
[1:11:02] rapture because you know what and and
[1:11:05] not just those were the message most any
[1:11:07] human being you see
[1:11:09] in Our Lives struggling for control it's
[1:11:12] even the business war you seen the spots
[1:11:14] war you see all over every facet of
[1:11:17] human existence you see men they're
[1:11:19] swimming in him that once control a man
[1:11:23] can you say Amen
[1:11:25] now I'm just talking to you okay just
[1:11:28] talking all right
[1:11:29] the preachers of gonna hit you I'm just
[1:11:31] talking and I think you're right I think
[1:11:34] you're a good class you have listened so
[1:11:36] but don't let it become so academically
[1:11:37] like scratch your head when it becomes
[1:11:43] like that then I know it's time to to
[1:11:45] sit down but control you love control I
[1:11:51] love control me I don't of control I lie
[1:12:00] you know where this is coming from God
[1:12:02] said let us make man in our image after
[1:12:04] our likeness and let them have dominion
[1:12:09] control control
[1:12:12] it's in bill is in equating man this
[1:12:16] control you won't have dominion you want
[1:12:17] to protect your space are you can
[1:12:21] somebody relate can you relate that's
[1:12:25] that's words you can wriggle out of that
[1:12:27] even when you feel that the nicest
[1:12:28] person you let everybody have their way
[1:12:29] give her their space not true if a man
[1:12:34] made in God's image Christian unbeliever
[1:12:36] human control now when God made man he
[1:12:46] mainly mean its own image but like I
[1:12:49] said many times many times we want to
[1:12:50] make God in our image we want a God who
[1:12:53] will be in our image who would be like
[1:12:54] horse is only in our church our group
[1:12:56] that's God
[1:12:57] that's it got in your own image but God
[1:13:01] making man in His image you try to cope
[1:13:03] with him and clip with his word he
[1:13:06] doesn't have to look like your group
[1:13:07] every believer doesn't have to look like
[1:13:09] your group or your church but when it
[1:13:12] must be
[1:13:12] our group our church our pastor our
[1:13:15] deacons you gotta got in your own image
[1:13:18] that's not how I did it
[1:13:20] that made man in his own image he's not
[1:13:24] missed what we likes do you maybe see
[1:13:27] that just talking to your a man so this
[1:13:35] man image is premium the pitiful cannot
[1:13:37] even and give him three things brother
[1:13:39] branham said we do not know these things
[1:13:41] the prophet a great prophet right
[1:13:44] straight from the man of God William
[1:13:46] Bramley taught us these things now many
[1:13:50] times even this is this Commission area
[1:13:53] don't you ever formally think that this
[1:13:57] message is failing or that's a law there
[1:13:59] is nothing like that but if you ever let
[1:14:03] the devil get you to feel nothing is
[1:14:05] going on nothing is moving you are
[1:14:07] defeated you might as well go going home
[1:14:08] somewhere this measure is stronger now
[1:14:11] than it's ever been because studies get
[1:14:14] it ready maybe see that God Amen you are
[1:14:22] stronger today than you were yesterday
[1:14:24] I'm not talking about what you feel I'm
[1:14:27] telling you it no soul the devil is not
[1:14:30] scared of you today than it was
[1:14:31] yesterday
[1:14:34] amen
[1:14:42] so you'll be seated
[1:14:47] so God made man in his own image after
[1:14:50] his likeness but we wanted God in our
[1:14:52] image after our likeness what we like
[1:14:56] and then we'll find the court on the
[1:14:59] scripture to make God Satan to me by the
[1:15:03] pen I'm sage
[1:15:04] that's a God in your own image so when
[1:15:10] God made these men brother branham
[1:15:12] Taurus you bring from the scriptures and
[1:15:15] let us see it that God give this man
[1:15:18] three things because when he fair is
[1:15:21] that Adam lost three things number one
[1:15:24] he lost his fellowship with God number
[1:15:26] two he lost it alive and number three in
[1:15:29] his eternal life he lost an inheritance
[1:15:32] a man in his eternal life now let me
[1:15:35] explain something to you here fellowship
[1:15:37] with God is a right as a son of God
[1:15:39] eternal life is this a right understand
[1:15:42] of God you don't have to do anything
[1:15:43] extra to earn eternal life a listen of
[1:15:46] God neither do anything extra to and
[1:15:49] fellowship with your father even in the
[1:15:51] natural and natural your son what is a
[1:15:53] good boy or a bad boy he's your son he
[1:15:57] has access to you all the time
[1:15:59] amen it has your life flowing through
[1:16:01] him well I'd assume that boy too late
[1:16:06] your life is flowing through him same
[1:16:10] way with God can somebody say Amen
[1:16:13] the devil is not much glory because
[1:16:17] greater more powerful is he that is a
[1:16:20] youth and the devil in the wall lying to
[1:16:22] you try to stop y'all but he cannot do
[1:16:24] it you cannot do it the other pure
[1:16:27] virtual sinless para Jesus Christ
[1:16:32] and amen amen you maybe see that trying
[1:16:42] to keep it up on my time here because
[1:16:44] some of us I'll triple a key I need some
[1:16:46] training because break a judge in less
[1:16:51] than one hour put me on that prove it
[1:16:53] what he doesn't one hour I'm doing four
[1:16:55] hours I mean unless we have much what
[1:16:58] now he really
[1:16:59] yes back he used to be remember the chip
[1:17:03] was preaching he was a leader in that
[1:17:07] department
[1:17:08] I'm but she was pitching you know the
[1:17:11] time by this sweat even though our old
[1:17:13] church you know you know heat so and one
[1:17:17] much avoid speeding when he sweat over
[1:17:19] here no he's gone two hours when it's
[1:17:22] gone to the Lexia you know he's like
[1:17:24] four hours and I said I'm only just
[1:17:26] getting started so we get a preamble I
[1:17:34] get leg us some time to Train us how to
[1:17:36] get your point through in one hour I'm
[1:17:39] sure they put Legos would love that very
[1:17:40] much
[1:17:41] oh yeah no don't tell me you won't love
[1:17:45] that I can see you how you look at your
[1:17:48] watch
[1:17:48] alright and you're making like lyonia I
[1:17:52] see all that come on Legos you're an
[1:17:56] Abba together for too long I know that
[1:17:57] but I okay you got to come with me but
[1:18:00] the Chivo brother talks and Fergie
[1:18:03] brother Moses when it comes here it's
[1:18:05] from Legos we have got to put in there
[1:18:09] what there or something you know what
[1:18:11] everybody was in family is doing 50
[1:18:13] minutes but don't be scared I won't keep
[1:18:17] you for hours and that's what the cheapo
[1:18:19] stuff you know so I was behind him in
[1:18:23] that department and but the talks would
[1:18:25] do it in both talks but I'll do it in
[1:18:27] one hour half hours but they serve that
[1:18:29] cheap when I working all the time so
[1:18:31] they upgraded
[1:18:33] they upgraded two meters up you know so
[1:18:37] wouldn't lead them to long so but talk
[1:18:41] to the spiritual so anyway got mid
[1:18:53] Manny's image again these three things
[1:18:56] and when man fell he lost these three
[1:19:00] things so we know from there he had
[1:19:02] these three things before he fell
[1:19:04] fellowship eternal life and inheritance
[1:19:08] in his talent now then here John we say
[1:19:11] but what it was was the authority the
[1:19:13] power the control over the earth that
[1:19:16] was the inheritance your son is your son
[1:19:18] but you know where you are right in your
[1:19:20] wheel to give your children the
[1:19:22] inheritance it depends on certain things
[1:19:24] and brother bidam Taurus in God's
[1:19:26] economy that son has got to be the right
[1:19:29] kind of as soon because this inheritance
[1:19:30] is powerful these returns placing on the
[1:19:33] same level as God himself so you have
[1:19:36] got to be the right kind of a strong
[1:19:38] firstly before he will give you this
[1:19:40] inheritance in life now
[1:19:42] Adam did not how to prove to be the
[1:19:44] right kind of a son because God made
[1:19:46] Adam not a channel but a male in his own
[1:19:49] image made him mature perfect men
[1:19:54] include image as though he had go
[1:19:57] through the process to be the right kind
[1:19:59] of a son I gave this inheritance in life
[1:20:02] but when Adam sinned unfair they lost
[1:20:06] all three and God immediately because
[1:20:10] Adam is shown is a son you can do
[1:20:12] anything about that goddess in the
[1:20:14] forces children he will never divorce
[1:20:16] you no matter how beaten up how black
[1:20:20] and blue you up in Vietnam he will never
[1:20:21] divorce you if you can just find your
[1:20:24] way back to the cross you will find your
[1:20:27] way back home but devil can keep you and
[1:20:30] put a wet believer your father you know
[1:20:33] always was a son you always will be a
[1:20:35] son
[1:20:36] hallelujah glory you may be seated
[1:20:47] but the the thoughts in the the
[1:20:50] inheritance in life got in Norridge
[1:20:53] topic immediately you restore the frost
[1:20:54] to those wise who writes as a soon it
[1:20:58] not to be the right kind of soul not to
[1:20:59] be any type of Sun it's in a life flush
[1:21:03] with his father but the inheritance is
[1:21:10] the only given to the right care of
[1:21:12] children with God felt Adam here built
[1:21:15] Adam up to that smoker when Adam fell
[1:21:16] said no this is no longer the right kind
[1:21:20] of song I cannot him that will that
[1:21:22] inheritance to have my two main to
[1:21:25] himself alone I cannot give him that but
[1:21:27] I restore back his inheritance I mean
[1:21:30] iris took back his fellowship is eternal
[1:21:32] life you'll never be lost
[1:21:33] you'll always be my son and so from that
[1:21:37] time the church has been how to come
[1:21:40] back to that inheritance that's supreme
[1:21:43] control on the face of the earth that's
[1:21:45] why you and I have this craving for
[1:21:47] control on the instead of us we want to
[1:21:50] come back to rulership we want to come
[1:21:51] back to sonship
[1:21:52] we want to come back to social Authority
[1:21:54] to speak and our water back just like
[1:21:58] that
[1:22:01] [Applause]
[1:22:08] amen glory so follow my story so that's
[1:22:19] where the craving to come from God send
[1:22:22] man out I'm gonna say I'm not going to
[1:22:25] restore this control they didn't how it
[1:22:28] turns back to you until I see you and
[1:22:31] see you under the control of the one who
[1:22:35] proved to be the right kind of a song
[1:22:37] amen and when I see that I will call you
[1:22:42] a shy give you three more words here is
[1:22:45] my son much Spearing freely and that's
[1:22:49] always Tamia like for the OVC last night
[1:22:52] Amen cause original plan for a mantis 10
[1:22:57] like the original mannequin of Eden
[1:23:00] possession on Timothy 20 spoken what
[1:23:04] authority power to control the earth
[1:23:07] total all the elements amen
[1:23:10] am i against the amen amen
[1:23:20] so when Adam fail brought us back to
[1:23:24] this spot here and that's why I said you
[1:23:26] mean all of us something on instead of
[1:23:28] us look longing for control you see it
[1:23:30] everywhere you see in your home life you
[1:23:32] see it at school you should be doing
[1:23:34] husband and wife you see within the
[1:23:36] children it's in the business world the
[1:23:42] husband wants a control his wife do I
[1:23:44] want to control the children the joy to
[1:23:46] control their parents what must happen
[1:23:49] to a husband this general control that
[1:23:52] church this must want to control the
[1:23:54] whole church control it's man of us it's
[1:23:57] part of who we are
[1:23:59] amen but we we have got control figured
[1:24:03] at wrong big-time big-time because God
[1:24:07] is a God of control
[1:24:11] gaara's didn't listen to just hang
[1:24:14] everywhere a God of control but the
[1:24:15] devil has put a battle rap on that what
[1:24:18] control it means like you any prison
[1:24:20] means they control everything you do it
[1:24:23] means you can do anything you are just
[1:24:24] heading there and you just have to like
[1:24:25] stay in a straitjacket no that's what we
[1:24:27] think but that's all have got TDT how
[1:24:35] did Adam get here to have these three
[1:24:38] things it's an alive fellowship and
[1:24:41] inheritance how did you get there you
[1:24:45] have to go all the way back to this grid
[1:24:47] three four mystery which is Christ in
[1:24:49] you the ultimate abilities Christ in you
[1:24:51] to put Christ in you and give you hope
[1:24:54] for that glory that Adam had in the can
[1:24:57] of Eden
[1:24:58] Lorie boy are you following me
[1:25:02] alright the preachers of preach so um
[1:25:07] and I hope I'm not too fast as by
[1:25:09] etching will you come with me he said no
[1:25:16] and I am preaching and I'm generally the
[1:25:19] brothers dealt with here
[1:25:24] of his league in this place here here so
[1:25:29] they have to rearrange the hall to
[1:25:30] accommodate my pitching staff you will
[1:25:35] think I will lend so when I went there I
[1:25:40] was very conscious now like that you've
[1:25:42] got to be measured and speak really slow
[1:25:46] so and I thought I did my best my best
[1:25:51] one fresh pitch in my fridge that's the
[1:25:53] brother the chance the height I do
[1:25:55] was it okay beside he said you killed me
[1:26:03] I fell on his neck I said I'm so sorry
[1:26:09] brother you know so but let's see now I
[1:26:12] understand I understand well you know I
[1:26:18] didn't get to help this year it's God's
[1:26:20] great 3/4 mystery which was God having
[1:26:24] the preeminence ease the continues over
[1:26:27] Christ by the word and correct all past
[1:26:33] haven't control by his word over the
[1:26:36] brown call it preeminence ease but it's
[1:26:39] control controlling the bread lab rat
[1:26:43] learns to obey the word all the time and
[1:26:46] here's a secret when you learn to be
[1:26:49] something to the world every second miss
[1:26:51] around you will lend the same thing to
[1:26:53] the circumstance around you cannot stand
[1:26:56] against the watch the what will create a
[1:26:59] hole in the wall if there must be hole
[1:27:02] in that wall Oh hallelujah
[1:27:06] [Music]
[1:27:17] no three for me she's not just catch
[1:27:20] phrase because I hear these days L name
[1:27:22] logos bright that's fine but don't take
[1:27:25] the water out of context
[1:27:32] Malakai him and reveal what the
[1:27:34] three four machines nobody needs to shed
[1:27:36] more light on it
[1:27:37] nobody's to explain anyway hello him
[1:27:42] logos bright what it means is that
[1:27:44] Elohim God having premises and control
[1:27:48] over Christ the bright the word and
[1:27:51] Christ having privileges over you the
[1:27:53] bright and number three is not the
[1:27:56] bright is Christ and the bright - in
[1:27:59] fact readin which is crashing you the
[1:28:02] hope of glory amen amen
[1:28:10] so here's the secret here so they can
[1:28:13] live even in the game of Eden here was
[1:28:16] Adam block out of the theophany in the
[1:28:19] beginning made his spirit man on the
[1:28:23] face of the earth
[1:28:23] and here was Adam spirit man Adam and
[1:28:27] later Genesis 2:7 this female was put in
[1:28:30] the body of flesh and man became a
[1:28:32] living soul
[1:28:32] and this man Adam went open down the gun
[1:28:36] Avedon in the image of God with absolute
[1:28:39] control over the earth God was the god
[1:28:43] of the universe but his son Adam was the
[1:28:47] god of the earth in absolute control
[1:28:50] over the earth but how that worked how
[1:28:52] that works which you know but also
[1:28:54] repeated to you how that was that God
[1:28:57] had control over Adam and so Adam could
[1:29:02] control the earth one had to come first
[1:29:05] God her to have preeminence is over Adam
[1:29:08] first
[1:29:14] and control over the earth automatically
[1:29:17] followed that's what we don't follow
[1:29:20] signs don't look for signs signs follow
[1:29:24] the believer the believer has come to
[1:29:26] preeminence ease has come to control by
[1:29:29] the word amen amen amen amen
[1:29:41] so Adam there he was in total complete
[1:29:50] subjection to God on his world the world
[1:29:53] in his soul
[1:29:58] Sharon split of Elohim in his soul
[1:30:01] Genesis 1:26 to 28 with a command
[1:30:06] Commission to subdue to rule to control
[1:30:09] the earth and so Adam was under the
[1:30:13] control of God and because of that you
[1:30:15] could control the but the very moment
[1:30:19] the very moment that Adam went away from
[1:30:23] the control of God the very minute like
[1:30:27] brother Delia things are said like that
[1:30:29] nothing happened when Eve you know these
[1:30:33] would be nothing happening and you watch
[1:30:34] brother banner be always about when Adam
[1:30:36] fell when Adam still win Adam failed
[1:30:41] once Adam soul or his birthright and God
[1:30:48] lost control over Adam immediately Adam
[1:30:53] lost control of the earth it was instant
[1:30:56] to tell you it out of that days you will
[1:30:59] die and he's gently odd I knew something
[1:31:02] change something change on the spur Adam
[1:31:05] knew that you know we all love control I
[1:31:12] mean you get adopted
[1:31:13] and you won't love it you'll be happy
[1:31:15] that's all they ever knew
[1:31:17] have you ever thought about Adam before
[1:31:18] Eve came on the scene the only man on
[1:31:22] the face of this earth no fellowship no
[1:31:25] way to grow no matter who is father and
[1:31:27] mother and you know laying things
[1:31:30] no no nothing he was just alone and then
[1:31:34] go MIDI for him
[1:31:36] and they had fellowship with God and it
[1:31:38] was in absolute control over the earth
[1:31:39] touch all over the earth but once he did
[1:31:42] this sin and listen to the devil in the
[1:31:48] form of this happen through his wife
[1:31:50] Gold lost control over Adam and rather
[1:31:53] the symptom instantly that I'm lost
[1:31:56] control over the earth you cannot eat a
[1:32:00] cake and have it Eve God be God 7 so
[1:32:08] like we all do something wrong so he he
[1:32:12] tried it again he snitched on me one
[1:32:14] Orleans but you will know you know you
[1:32:16] will know when something but you know so
[1:32:20] he tried to like this to remove this way
[1:32:23] I moved away nothing happened
[1:32:25] try to access that control like before I
[1:32:28] want to walk on the water and if I were
[1:32:31] himself sinking he run back you know
[1:32:35] that contain was gone away from him I
[1:32:38] noticed that he was naked which wasn't
[1:32:42] an issue before he looked at his wife
[1:32:43] she's naked he knew these not proper so
[1:32:46] he went right away to try and get that
[1:32:47] control back let's do something let's do
[1:32:50] something no that's how we are we never
[1:32:51] admit until we up into the world do we
[1:32:54] up into the wall and we have to are
[1:32:56] forced to admit but instead of falling
[1:32:58] man don't do that so you went and the
[1:33:09] fig leaves uncovered himself on his swim
[1:33:11] so you see here also Easter I begin my
[1:33:13] free with means something went wrong he
[1:33:15] you know like like something you stretch
[1:33:18] in front of the power is gone just kick
[1:33:21] off the cheetah
[1:33:22] should I call me actually I just many
[1:33:24] which I just look who's talking it
[1:33:25] doesn't its way it's a lion come here
[1:33:27] the general straddle the of a tiger just
[1:33:30] coming like that graceful like that I'm
[1:33:33] started getting afraid he said no
[1:33:34] something's going on here I gotta hide
[1:33:35] these animals will cheer me up
[1:33:37] I gotta hide from all these animals
[1:33:40] because they with the earth they had the
[1:33:42] latter rule he got afraid he said I was
[1:33:45] afraid so I hid myself fear came in he
[1:33:49] was afraid with lots of control his war
[1:33:52] just turned upside down that's why you
[1:33:55] are now on control control put stays in
[1:33:58] place control gets you in order control
[1:34:00] set things the way you think you want
[1:34:02] them to go like Adam when we feel out of
[1:34:19] control we just don't feel right because
[1:34:24] God made us to control to be the
[1:34:27] controller on the earth so when we feel
[1:34:31] out of control that's another subject
[1:34:33] while we feel out of control
[1:34:35] I just want to you know stay here on you
[1:34:37] know Genesis and Adam you know I'm
[1:34:40] selling out to the devil through his
[1:34:41] wife's reasoning the Adam wasn't
[1:34:43] deceived when you feel out of control
[1:34:47] when you feel not in control things just
[1:34:50] don't feel right unlike Adam we kept
[1:34:58] control wrong Adam to fix this pyramid
[1:35:04] we also control look at what he did look
[1:35:08] at what he did
[1:35:09] it made figleaves wrong action God came
[1:35:14] down Adam Wainwright now he said I had
[1:35:19] the vault work in the garden and I was
[1:35:21] afraid of all these animals running
[1:35:24] around here and me I don't strong and I
[1:35:26] hit myself wrong action but Adam who -
[1:35:30] you - you were naked have you eaten the
[1:35:34] food that I did simple answer yes
[1:35:41] simple answer yes Adam said yes but an
[1:35:49] explanation not a laughing matter
[1:35:57] my mother and said you know it's because
[1:36:05] of the woman that you yourself gave me I
[1:36:07] was in fine you know I still maintain I
[1:36:09] didn't fall without her well you give it
[1:36:10] to me you give it to me wrong action
[1:36:16] simple answer yes but what he was doing
[1:36:20] he was he did wrong he was caught
[1:36:23] red-handed but the blame is not mine
[1:36:25] alone out of control playing the blame
[1:36:31] game it's my wife
[1:36:34] it's my husband it's my brother is my
[1:36:37] sister is the pastor is Julian oh come
[1:36:43] on now come on now
[1:36:47] [Applause]
[1:36:50] Bhavana me Nigeria okay I mean I did
[1:36:54] this is on top for me so I know that's
[1:37:02] why I went but always come around wasn't
[1:37:04] that trouble is coming because he can
[1:37:06] see things that you know of course
[1:37:08] whatever but you know I don't mean to be
[1:37:10] controversial I apologize about that up
[1:37:12] front but I don't like living in denial
[1:37:14] I don't like delicious even myself I'd
[1:37:16] like to call it spirit spade and if I'm
[1:37:18] wrong and wrong I can get over your head
[1:37:20] and because your pastor is talking you
[1:37:22] can keep quite both boys not gonna keep
[1:37:24] quiet
[1:37:24] they don't respect no possible response
[1:37:26] children and bumps are going to be tabla
[1:37:29] sincere anyway so Adam put a blend in
[1:37:32] you know what it was like everybody is
[1:37:34] wrong because of what you are done you
[1:37:36] can never talk to what you did
[1:37:38] anyway you own up everybody must take a
[1:37:40] blame for it because you felt out of
[1:37:42] control the blame game the victim
[1:37:46] mentality everybody's against me if not
[1:37:49] for my wife
[1:37:49] if not for my husband if not for the
[1:37:51] church even though for the country if
[1:37:52] not for the press
[1:37:53] that has been everybody for second sense
[1:38:00] because he feels was totally out of
[1:38:02] control and we got control wrong totally
[1:38:05] figured out wrong lost control we want
[1:38:08] to get it back and Dan wants us to get
[1:38:11] it back so how do we get control back
[1:38:14] O'Reilly what's the right way to get
[1:38:16] back this control how do we can control
[1:38:18] right we go back to God to go back to
[1:38:27] God he's the devil country he said in
[1:38:30] the Bible let everything be done
[1:38:32] decently and in order
[1:38:36] God dwell all by himself thoughts in his
[1:38:40] mind and became the logos well he wasn't
[1:38:44] of the logos quit at Angel's the word
[1:38:52] quit at angels angels worshipped him and
[1:39:00] when angels watched them then those are
[1:39:02] rewarded heavens son there's no panic in
[1:39:06] heaven the word he's in control is that
[1:39:09] gutter control things go wrong it was
[1:39:11] all well thought out it's all English
[1:39:14] program things can never go wrong
[1:39:17] nothing can go wrong but what God would
[1:39:20] allow it and the word control that they
[1:39:29] will control it war in heaven through
[1:39:34] Lucifer out and he's 1/4 of angels and
[1:39:38] human our wine heaven became human
[1:39:42] battles and got him on the earth and
[1:39:44] created the heavens and the earth the
[1:39:47] god of order and control I wish I had
[1:39:49] the picture to show you the the great
[1:39:52] universe that he created but let me give
[1:39:58] you statistic
[1:40:01] the skies the heavens boughs it declared
[1:40:04] some men declare the glory of God and
[1:40:05] the firmament shows his handiwork and in
[1:40:09] the stands that you see at night they
[1:40:11] are billions and billions and billions
[1:40:13] of them many of them are bigger than our
[1:40:17] earth and those tears are on planets and
[1:40:24] it grew a planet's from a galaxy
[1:40:27] I mean galaxy has its own and the planet
[1:40:30] it run that strong now our own galaxy
[1:40:36] our own galaxy
[1:40:37] and most of these galaxies are spinning
[1:40:40] around me now we don't feel it because
[1:40:42] of God's great wisdom but this earth
[1:40:47] this earth is an and the galaxy the way
[1:40:50] in is spinning around at the breakneck
[1:40:53] speed of four hundred and ninety
[1:40:57] thousand miles an hour
[1:41:02] these are galaxies this this Galax that
[1:41:05] were in it spin around spin around spin
[1:41:07] run for an eight thousand miles an hour
[1:41:09] we don't feel it and even have that
[1:41:14] great breakneck speed to for our God to
[1:41:18] make one single rotation you don't have
[1:41:23] many years on it it wouldn't at least
[1:41:26] two hundred million years for our galaxy
[1:41:33] to make one single nation around the Sun
[1:41:40] and God keeps all that they're
[1:41:44] absolutely controlled in order of them I
[1:41:48] go and run like that are the wrong
[1:41:52] things in space by his word here's what
[1:41:57] keeps him on the check his word is the
[1:42:00] controller that controls all of this
[1:42:03] news and keeps them in their space
[1:42:05] Laury Laury the ecology and you know
[1:42:10] what you know what that but over a
[1:42:14] billion all the galaxies not planets
[1:42:19] over a billion other galaxies out there
[1:42:22] like our galaxy uncle where are these
[1:42:29] happens on the earth and the hanging
[1:42:32] space there
[1:42:33] at this speed Ranelagh I don't right
[1:42:35] he's a God of order I have is not run
[1:42:37] under control and it control them by his
[1:42:42] world are you following me
[1:42:43] control him by his world and this Great
[1:42:49] God come right down to you and I and
[1:42:51] could it Adam in the Garden of Eden this
[1:42:54] great God what is man that thou art
[1:42:57] mindful of him or the Son of man that
[1:42:59] you will visit him acquainted man in the
[1:43:02] Caribbean and put amen the same way he
[1:43:06] wants to control this man and brother
[1:43:08] Panem Toros and you know when he came
[1:43:10] down gen 1:26 that was God coming down
[1:43:12] this control tower in Adam at the
[1:43:17] control tower was bad the word the seven
[1:43:20] spirits of God in Adam soul
[1:43:30] and in the physical do you see this
[1:43:35] control of God right down to everything
[1:43:38] that God knows is a God upon saw in
[1:43:41] Adams body your body is so controlled so
[1:43:46] controlled you have a control center in
[1:43:49] your head control the whole human body
[1:43:52] every cell has a control center
[1:43:55] everything is so controlled he's a glad
[1:43:58] of control and that control bring some
[1:44:00] order so God so God when he gave Adam to
[1:44:11] control the earth he was sitting right
[1:44:14] on Adam strewn in Adams heart with his
[1:44:18] control tower
[1:44:19] it chose man's had to be his control he
[1:44:22] was seated there in the form of his
[1:44:25] seven spirits and Adam was subject to
[1:44:28] this control and then the earth was
[1:44:30] tomato Adams control Amen glory to God a
[1:44:35] man can you share hallelujah
[1:44:39] are you following our story it's a
[1:44:43] beautiful story of redemption now like I
[1:44:49] said the devil gives a rap went about
[1:44:50] control I wish I'd want to control me
[1:44:52] it's very young people you want to
[1:44:53] control me I'll lose my freedom they'd
[1:44:55] let me watch them what I do know here
[1:44:57] was God controlling Adam in the Garden
[1:44:58] of Eden God was absolutely in control
[1:45:01] watch in this control like by the daily
[1:45:04] preach and choices watch in this control
[1:45:06] in this control why did God tell Adam of
[1:45:11] all the truth you go eat but this one
[1:45:13] don't eat but it's your choice I give
[1:45:16] you a choice not inside God's control
[1:45:18] got left room for a choice that for Adam
[1:45:21] to be or not to be for Adam to obey or
[1:45:25] not obey that's why so we get control
[1:45:27] one number one we control you get a do
[1:45:30] it yet parents control that children you
[1:45:33] know do the same do this here all God
[1:45:39] didn't do that
[1:45:41] the controller is not your word those
[1:45:44] priests of us when don't respect your
[1:45:46] word the respected mascots word is the
[1:45:50] same don't control your children but God
[1:45:53] controlling his son Adam he told him
[1:45:57] this is what I'm going to do but if you
[1:46:00] choose the other way no their
[1:46:02] consequences with your choice so God's
[1:46:06] control leaves a room for a choice I
[1:46:16] know why you know why nobody grows on
[1:46:23] the very controlling atmosphere nobody
[1:46:26] goes why you Anna Church
[1:46:30] everything is control sit down stand up
[1:46:33] you can't even think for yourself when
[1:46:36] you're at home sit down turn up okay you
[1:46:38] do this here
[1:46:39] the church the pastor deacons do this
[1:46:41] here and the pastor's get away to take
[1:46:43] it away from them and do everything by
[1:46:44] himself and they the deacon you know you
[1:46:46] will never grow the same way in a home
[1:46:49] somewhere at home when you don't give
[1:46:53] the people a chance to be I'm not to be
[1:46:54] too to grow to make the mistakes to
[1:46:57] learn
[1:46:58] that's what choices are there the
[1:47:01] process of choices lets you go through
[1:47:03] thinking it through if I go this way
[1:47:08] if I go this way these are the
[1:47:09] consequences if I go that way these are
[1:47:12] the consequences just talking to you and
[1:47:15] I hope you are listening if I go this
[1:47:18] way these are the consequences if I
[1:47:19] cross out the consequences no I will go
[1:47:22] this way and not that way
[1:47:23] and in that process is a maturing
[1:47:27] process through the thinking process
[1:47:29] that's why God gave us choices to think
[1:47:33] through your choices and in control he
[1:47:36] lets us have room to be or not to be it
[1:47:39] doesn't crowd out our space so it's a
[1:47:42] lie when the devil says husain is all
[1:47:47] about controlling you control the
[1:47:48] people's minds no in cost system of
[1:47:50] control you have a choice
[1:47:54] to obey or not to obey in the damaged
[1:47:59] stem of control he gives you no choice
[1:48:01] even why you don't want to do wrong he
[1:48:03] forces you to do wrong you know like the
[1:48:08] prodigal son is the I don't like any
[1:48:11] Sonia too much controlling this woman
[1:48:12] here I'll go to my father say father I'm
[1:48:16] tired of this control here I'm gone an
[1:48:21] Italian said no you're not going proving
[1:48:25] that he was wrong in the first instance
[1:48:27] father let him go and the control he was
[1:48:31] getting the way from run away from from
[1:48:32] his father didn't meet away went didn't
[1:48:41] meet the control he went on was so all
[1:48:44] his substance it was free freedom to do
[1:48:47] what he wanted to know this control
[1:48:49] gives you freedom not to live like a
[1:48:52] freedom to do the right thing freedom to
[1:48:57] shun the wrong and do the right thing
[1:48:58] that's God's control and you'll give you
[1:49:01] a chew on that simple opportunity to
[1:49:03] have the choice to do the right thing or
[1:49:05] do the wrong thing when they get to that
[1:49:09] age of accountability if the choice is
[1:49:12] the choice Oh glory to God amen amen
[1:49:19] so Adam when he sinned and he lost
[1:49:28] control
[1:49:29] you were gonna pet the control right
[1:49:31] back I need two wrong things and that's
[1:49:33] like I said that's what we all do we
[1:49:35] want control and we do the wrong things
[1:49:37] it becomes my way or the highway makes a
[1:49:41] domineering dominant you know nobody
[1:49:44] must be our way and no other way that's
[1:49:50] not God's we have control and you'll
[1:49:52] never come to adoption like that no you
[1:49:54] will never Oh glory I'm not making sense
[1:50:01] I'm almost done I'm almost done so God
[1:50:09] will learn for me how this control comes
[1:50:12] about can I have the first my first
[1:50:16] picture there all right hello him have
[1:50:28] thoughts on his mind and that makes
[1:50:31] sense right
[1:50:32] and then Elohim pour these thoughts into
[1:50:35] a body called the logos a body like this
[1:50:38] body but with the better scene it's
[1:50:40] supernatural body and all that and these
[1:50:42] thoughts narrowing became what seats in
[1:50:45] the loggers
[1:50:46] Adam was it funny narrow him you wait
[1:50:48] for the narrow him I was a sudden arrow
[1:50:50] him so what God in Genesis 1:26 was he
[1:50:55] took Adam seed in the logos viruses got
[1:50:59] created man in his own image of that
[1:51:01] seed he created a perfect man and that
[1:51:07] became the spirit man in Genesis 1:26
[1:51:12] 228 and you were still there as a throat
[1:51:16] a seed what in the Lourdes and what Adam
[1:51:20] was to do was so standing in the time of
[1:51:22] season call you out and here you would
[1:51:25] have come God take your seat from the
[1:51:27] loggers and this is your seed and your
[1:51:30] serum your seat on your seed and God
[1:51:33] took it out and created the purpose of
[1:51:37] creation that's the only the quitter
[1:51:38] that can do that that can take a seed
[1:51:40] and walk in and form it into the image
[1:51:44] of God seven perfect spirits that's what
[1:51:48] it did in Genesis 1:20 2018 Genesis 1:26
[1:51:52] was not a feel funny it was a you're
[1:51:54] funny seed that was created and
[1:51:58] fashioned into the image of God and then
[1:52:03] Genesis 2:7 it took that spirit man put
[1:52:07] a flasher on him
[1:52:08] but this you're funny this seed was Adam
[1:52:12] soul and put a flashing on him I'm just
[1:52:17] used to seven says go from man just one
[1:52:20] twenty six was the creation that's the
[1:52:22] equation this happens on the inside and
[1:52:24] then from man on the face of the earth
[1:52:26] no man can do the Christian on the
[1:52:28] inside only God
[1:52:30] but man can do the forming on the
[1:52:32] outside like public charge was talking
[1:52:34] about the Nigerian doctor they can work
[1:52:36] on the flesh they can work on the body
[1:52:38] they can American shadow to a prosthetic
[1:52:40] limb and you have things they can
[1:52:42] cottonseed up but no man can cut open
[1:52:44] heal the soul only God can do the walk
[1:52:46] of creation on the inside next picture
[1:52:58] this was Adam before the fall in his
[1:53:02] soul was seven perfect spirits that was
[1:53:08] a spirit man and that's when I was a
[1:53:13] control tower the control tower was not
[1:53:15] Adam it was the world got controlling by
[1:53:19] his word and I was under the control of
[1:53:22] the ward in his soul and man just became
[1:53:27] a living soul when he put flesh on him
[1:53:30] the so the what image lived out through
[1:53:33] the flesh man became a living soul well
[1:53:38] watch it when Adam fell what happened I
[1:53:44] don't you need to understand this you
[1:53:45] know what the battle has been for you
[1:53:47] and I the devil knew with the word madam
[1:53:54] soul he has no chance so what he did he
[1:53:59] came and began to attack his spirit it
[1:54:06] ever can never get your soul began to
[1:54:09] attack his spirit where you have the
[1:54:11] affection memory reasoning imagination
[1:54:14] conscience began to attack it has God
[1:54:18] said to reason of the world
[1:54:22] got said if God said no that's not what
[1:54:25] it is here this was the controller the
[1:54:30] world in the soul and he speaks the
[1:54:33] spirit listens it speaks the body
[1:54:35] listens and man became a living soul the
[1:54:38] soul lived through this flesh this
[1:54:40] spirit could not stand in the way but
[1:54:47] the devil came and succeeded in getting
[1:54:50] me here and government to reason the
[1:54:54] word has God said no God hasn't said and
[1:54:58] all that and then when man fell he fell
[1:55:04] short of the glory of God this was the
[1:55:07] glory of God inside and this glory of
[1:55:10] goemon's fell this really became
[1:55:11] shortened it came from being a stature
[1:55:15] or the fullness became a little seed in
[1:55:19] his soul the control tower was with the
[1:55:23] usually a little seed and the devil got
[1:55:25] in here introduced another control tower
[1:55:28] to began to reason the word so after the
[1:55:33] fall the control tower the what image
[1:55:36] became a little seed and thus a man have
[1:55:39] seen and fallen short of the glory of
[1:55:43] God the glory of God you're funny in
[1:55:45] seed form in your soul seven perfect
[1:55:48] spirits the nature of God in your soul
[1:55:51] the fall became reduced because man fare
[1:55:56] reduce to this little protein amen
[1:56:00] so the control tower did not did no
[1:56:02] longer have the power that he had to
[1:56:05] control the spirit and the flesh because
[1:56:08] the devil got in here with his own
[1:56:10] control
[1:56:12] Lucifer's control tower the human mind
[1:56:14] which is your brain to reason things out
[1:56:18] can you say Amen
[1:56:21] amen so brother sister that's been our
[1:56:31] story can give me the third one I'm
[1:56:36] almost done really all right
[1:56:38] that's been our story this your human
[1:56:41] mind the brain the physical brain is the
[1:56:44] body but that is the spirit that makes
[1:56:46] you work and that's with your human mind
[1:56:48] so the human mind works with the brain
[1:56:50] and like I explained before right here
[1:56:52] is your emotions right there the front
[1:56:55] of the brain is where you have the
[1:56:56] reasoning and when you live in your
[1:56:59] human mind at the level of your human
[1:57:01] mind
[1:57:01] what you are doing is that your reason
[1:57:03] and your emotions at work all the time
[1:57:05] all the time
[1:57:07] the control tower is to shut up your
[1:57:11] soul is no longer controlling like that
[1:57:13] when you are living in the humanistic
[1:57:14] realm your soul which is the control
[1:57:18] tower for God instead of shut up and
[1:57:22] this is the devil's control tower your
[1:57:25] reasoning and your emotions your
[1:57:27] intellect you select your mind you read
[1:57:30] the Bible and then your intellect your
[1:57:33] mind know this can happen the doctors
[1:57:34] say that can never happen and all of
[1:57:37] that I know what you you can check this
[1:57:42] out not me saying that because all your
[1:57:44] sensations come through here emotions
[1:57:47] are given an upper hand all the time
[1:57:50] when you stay at this level here your
[1:57:53] emotions will always win against your
[1:57:55] reasoning that's why when you know you
[1:57:58] know something is wrong to do while your
[1:58:02] emotions get you so under control so
[1:58:04] angry you know I should be angry like
[1:58:05] that your emotions we know the time
[1:58:07] between your emotions and your wrist
[1:58:09] your intellect your emotions you are
[1:58:12] wired the originals will get the upper
[1:58:14] hand all the time
[1:58:14] so when the fall happened the devil
[1:58:18] religious to live at this level what
[1:58:22] emotions versus your reasoning have God
[1:58:27] said yes and no gods say we shouldn't do
[1:58:29] it but no you will become whatever and
[1:58:32] he put his hand in here
[1:58:33] the emotions felt good and the motions
[1:58:36] versus your reasoning the motions are
[1:58:38] given an opera hand all the time
[1:58:41] whatever controls your emotions controls
[1:58:44] you so for a man that's his teeth and
[1:58:58] God said I will not give you back that
[1:59:03] inheritance in life until I can get men
[1:59:06] back to the spot to where the control
[1:59:08] tower will be set back in his heart in
[1:59:11] that had compartment and that controls
[1:59:14] how we control the intellect will
[1:59:16] control the emotions control the body
[1:59:18] like it did in Adam before the fall
[1:59:20] that's been the Gospel story to get mom
[1:59:24] back to that spot to where God can take
[1:59:27] charge again and control your reasoning
[1:59:30] control your emotions control your flesh
[1:59:33] body that's been the Gospel story and
[1:59:35] that's why I sent you a prophet a man
[1:59:39] you may be seated
[1:59:40] glory now can it send it back to the
[1:59:56] picture before this one right so here we
[2:00:02] are these where we are headed for but
[2:00:05] this is where we are when we come in to
[2:00:08] this world a little seed in our seed of
[2:00:12] God is a little seed but it's not the
[2:00:14] control tower normal the control is
[2:00:18] taking place here from your reason and
[2:00:19] emotions than your flesh and your your
[2:00:22] insulation and all the time your
[2:00:24] emotions always win because that's why
[2:00:27] man has become like one of us to know
[2:00:29] good and evil and he said to him that
[2:00:33] knows what is good and does it not to
[2:00:35] image sin that's how we seen you know
[2:00:38] good and you don't do it because your
[2:00:41] emotions control you they catch your
[2:00:44] your feelings Frost and they guide what
[2:00:46] you do
[2:00:47] we act and then think little so that's
[2:00:54] been the wall but when you become a
[2:00:57] Christian when become a believer this
[2:01:02] sit in the soul is walking up and that
[2:01:08] is Johnny to go back here we are going
[2:01:12] back where we fell from they will not
[2:01:20] leave you comfortless is that I will
[2:01:22] come again he will come and save you
[2:01:25] said to the weary one your God has
[2:01:27] Charlie come he will come and save you
[2:01:30] or let's drive it home now and go out of
[2:01:32] here glory you may be see the glory so
[2:01:44] when you become a Christian this Syriac
[2:01:46] went out Gus control tower begins to
[2:01:52] come back into the human soul because
[2:01:54] God controls by his world not by the
[2:01:57] parents words not by the pastor's words
[2:01:59] by his words they control the universe
[2:02:03] all of those galaxies are there by his
[2:02:05] words he doesn't cry over them like a
[2:02:08] helicopter it is the Sun staining his
[2:02:11] flesh is this wondering then don't know
[2:02:13] his word because what has not power in
[2:02:16] itself
[2:02:17] amen to make this pass on the moon and
[2:02:20] the Sun and the galaxies to hang in
[2:02:22] their spaces this one has the power why
[2:02:26] one does not have the power to keep your
[2:02:28] children our control to keep the reason
[2:02:31] your children under control Laura glory
[2:02:40] you may be seated just talking to you so
[2:02:51] goods in the process of taking control
[2:02:55] but over Adam when Adam is totally again
[2:03:01] under the control of God the earth will
[2:03:04] automatically commander Adams control
[2:03:07] will be back here will be back here
[2:03:11] seven perfect spirits the image of God
[2:03:15] the what image in Adams soul
[2:03:18] undaunted into his flesh again and man
[2:03:23] will go up and down the earth again like
[2:03:24] Adam just see the Lord or keep still and
[2:03:29] that's what the devil fights that word
[2:03:32] so bad he pollutes the water he dilutes
[2:03:41] the word interpreter word but thank God
[2:03:45] down through the ages we have examples
[2:03:49] examples of heroes in the Bible who
[2:03:53] correct dreams of the water God
[2:03:56] clear for the day and age even in the
[2:03:58] Old Testament and this was selling their
[2:04:01] soul and had them under total control
[2:04:03] and when this word is in the soul and
[2:04:07] after that control the flesh is subject
[2:04:11] circumstance and run is subject this one
[2:04:14] in the soul masters every circumstance

[2:12:20] weak a little weak
[2:12:23] when I see the signs and wonders TB
[2:12:25] Joshua and all of that and and you know
[2:12:27] penny cautious and all of that so people
[2:12:29] are roaring up the signs even in the
[2:12:31] message I find many churches where
[2:12:33] people are impersonating for the Bonhams
[2:12:35] gift
[2:12:35] people are twins doing assignments and
[2:12:38] those errands have a huge bite
[2:12:40] arrow but I don't know between about

[2:12:51] design and I'll tell you like that
[2:12:52] somebody's after you in the village and

[2:12:57] religion is selling really good tell me
[2:13:00] that you are poor because somebody has
[2:13:02] tied your destiny in the village and so

[2:14:05] feelings shut up emotions kept quiet
[2:14:08] they are behind the world and the flesh
[2:14:12] was only a measure to carry out what the
[2:14:14] soul wanted done
[2:14:19] but there are people today who want
[2:14:22] control over all nature and they have no
[2:14:23] control over self life the way God gets

[2:53:17] happy September happy new month and with
[2:53:20] this new month but all that has been led
[2:53:24] to turn up the heat as it were so from
[2:53:29] this week there'll be no more felicity
[2:53:32] night services we want to have services
[2:53:34] coming Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. and we
[2:53:36] want to really encourage you to make an
[2:53:39] effort for some of you if you could come
[2:53:41] straight from work that works if you
[2:53:43] want to carpool that works but make an
[2:53:46] effort Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. it will be
[2:53:48] a live reaching service and this coming
[2:53:50] Friday at 7:30 p.m. as well we want to
[2:53:53] come back into the house of God and I
[2:53:55] really want to encourage especially the
[2:53:57] young people to make an extra effort to
[2:54:01] be in these services you have more
[2:54:04] opportunities to be in the house of God
[2:54:07] and this by God's grace is also
[2:54:09] Scripture as the day approaches that we
[2:54:12] are to gather together more frequently
[2:54:13] so we want to really put some more
[2:54:16] commitment and effort to this and going
[2:54:19] forward our order of services will be
[2:54:21] Sunday mornings at 10:00 a.m. Wednesday
[2:54:23] nights at 7:30 p.m. and Friday nights at
[2:54:26] 7:30 p.m. and invite somebody out
[2:54:29] testify to somebody but the random said
[2:54:32] if you don't testify you'll find
[2:54:34] yourself back stood in one name you know
[2:54:37] it should be part of your everyday walk
[2:54:39] to talk about Jesus talk about his
[2:54:42] goodness and but around us and we are
[2:54:44] all preachers it doesn't require coming
[2:54:46] into the pulpit but your life is a
[2:54:48] testimony as we heard that powerful
[2:54:51] testimony from a young man that British
[2:54:52] Stephen impacted and it's a life if
[2:54:55] we're this even was just seeing words
[2:54:56] and the love was not being expressed
[2:54:58] that a young man will pick it up because
[2:55:00] they are looking for reality but the
[2:55:02] love that was this was displayed or
[2:55:04] express to what time was so compelling
[2:55:06] that it it warranted a response and
[2:55:08] that's how we we ought to be you know
[2:55:10] I'm on the expectation friends because
[2:55:12] we are leaving this place and I can't
[2:55:15] wait to go I can't wait to get out of
[2:55:17] this sinful world but we also have a job
[2:55:20] to do before we leave here because the
[2:55:23] body of Christ has been hurt and
[2:55:25] affected we have lost young people we
[2:55:28] have lost different ones but we are not
[2:55:30] leaving them behind before we leave here
[2:55:33] we will see a restoration of the young
[2:55:35] people we will see a seventh underpriced
[2:55:38] revival before we leave here we're not
[2:55:40] leaving here sick nobody's leaving here
[2:55:43] the press we've got to let the devil
[2:55:46] know as we bought a rap to express we
[2:55:49] made it and but the brandon said when
[2:55:52] you get over there you look around and
[2:55:54] see people are you'll wonder how they
[2:55:56] made it what is the grace of God
[2:55:59] it's the unfeeling amazing grace of God
[2:56:02] and the Prophet said the head store will
[2:56:04] come with shoutings crying grace grace
[2:56:07] grace unto it so I encourage you pray
[2:56:10] more than you've ever prayed before I
[2:56:12] encourage you worship more than you ever
[2:56:14] worship before with Apollo and check her
[2:56:17] one time said do something different if
[2:56:19] you if you used to raising one hand
[2:56:20] raise two hands if I used to pray in
[2:56:23] half-an-hour
[2:56:23] pray for 45 minutes but whatever you do
[2:56:26] do something more because whatever more
[2:56:30] you do it's a more results you're gonna
[2:56:32] get in your school do more you get more
[2:56:34] results in your Christian walk two more
[2:56:37] you get more results in your marriage
[2:56:39] two more you'll get more results in your
[2:56:41] prayer life two more
[2:56:42] you'll get more results in your reading
[2:56:44] read more you get more involved in your
[2:56:46] worship worship more you get more
[2:56:48] results is that what you're looking for
[2:56:51] more results in every area of your life
[2:56:54] as but Allah said in yours caught in
[2:56:55] Scripture in all things pertaining to
[2:56:58] life and godliness come to church shame
[2:57:01] and so I look forward to seeing you here
[2:57:04] this Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. and Friday
[2:57:07] at 7:30 p.m. and we asking the choir
[2:57:10] members just stay back for a very short
[2:57:12] meeting after service and maintenance
[2:57:14] group 4 please meet with brother Marlon
[2:57:17] Alexander after the second service and
[2:57:19] last and certainly not least we have
[2:57:22] delayed this for some time
[2:57:23] but we do want to take care of this so
[2:57:26] next Sunday after service we will have
[2:57:28] our post convention meeting which we
[2:57:31] should have had a while ago so it is
[2:57:33] asking all those who are involved in
[2:57:35] operations on planning for the
[2:57:37] convention to please repair your reports
[2:57:39] your comments your suggestions so as we
[2:57:41] prepare to boot wrap up this year and
[2:57:44] what quad will have for us next year
[2:57:45] will be more prepared by the grace of
[2:57:48] God so me the Lord richly bless you
[2:57:51] archers deacons brother Anthony just
[2:58:01] want to get a word to the parents and
[2:58:03] try to encourage your parents to get a
[2:58:05] burden considering your children I know
[2:58:07] enough school and college and different
[2:58:09] things like that
[2:58:10] but that sometimes could be a real
[2:58:13] excuse you need to put God first have a
[2:58:17] burden to put God first and see things
[2:58:19] we hold so smoothly and one time I had a
[2:58:22] family and he was always busy doing
[2:58:25] stuff doing stuff doing the stuff and
[2:58:27] make an excuse about study and school
[2:58:29] and whatnot when his results came it
[2:58:31] wasn't that hard and we all and the guy
[2:58:33] who got it once he was in sports he was
[2:58:37] an all a man of things so he was a big
[2:58:39] question how come you don't have all
[2:58:41] this activity and this guy have all this
[2:58:43] activity and still to perform it's
[2:58:45] interesting it's just what you put your
[2:58:47] heart to what you put your mind to and
[2:58:49] if you change your attitude in your
[2:58:51] thinking like I recognize some in the
[2:58:54] press services I don't see young much
[2:58:56] young people at all and I wonder why
[2:58:58] somebody young people I don't know if
[2:59:00] they could even pretty think about it
[2:59:02] now we want them to be able to pray we
[2:59:04] want them to if they don't know that
[2:59:06] they will learn to pray that we could
[2:59:08] get them to learn to pray and get
[2:59:11] involved in cinah would a prayer and we
[2:59:13] want to see that so I want you to know
[2:59:15] that things are changing we're gonna
[2:59:17] keep our finger on the reset button I
[2:59:19] think everything is reset and get it
[2:59:21] just right so when your miss service
[2:59:24] don't be a phenom be a surprise if they
[2:59:26] get a phone call to ask why
[2:59:30] squirty but we're gonna keep that button
[2:59:34] down until everything is reset so things
[2:59:37] are gonna change
[2:59:39] and you have to change what change
[2:59:41] middle or bless you see you this evening
