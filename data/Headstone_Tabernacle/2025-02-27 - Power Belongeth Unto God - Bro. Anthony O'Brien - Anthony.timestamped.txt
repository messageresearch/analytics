[42:05] belongeth unto God Amen and reading from
[42:10] Colossians 1

[42:18] created that are in heaven that are in
[42:21] Earth visible and invisible whether they
[42:24] be Thrones or dominions or
[42:27] principalities or Powers all things were
[42:31] created by Him and for him and he is

[44:01] uh for this in Jesus Christ's precious
[44:03] name amen and amen you may have your
[44:05] seats thank you praise
[44:15] God praise God BR sha still not getting
[44:18] a signal on the monitors uh I think they
[44:20] may not be on at all at this point um
[44:23] but
[44:24] anyway praise God well God bless you and
[44:27] uh it's good to be here one more time
[44:31] amen are you happy to in his presence
[44:34] tonight
[44:36] hallelujah praise God oh okay yeah
[44:38] that's that's good amen okay
[44:41] good
[44:45] amen all right just get settled in
[44:49] here amen so we have a title tonight the
[44:53] title uh for this little inspiration
[44:55] tonight is power belongeth unto
[44:59] God power belongeth unto God I love that
[45:03] scripture there Psalm 62 which we just
[45:06] read says God ha spoken once and twice
[45:10] have I heard this that power belongeth
[45:13] unto God amen amen praise God so may he
[45:17] speak it to us tonight again the second
[45:20] time amen amen so that we really get it
[45:23] because we don't get it until we get it
[45:25] amen but uh
[45:27] so the Genesis of our little thought
[45:29] here tonight is that God is all
[45:33] powerful all power belongs unto God he's
[45:37] all powerful all power belongs to him
[45:41] tonight uh we don't have any power
[45:43] within ourselves anything that is given
[45:45] to us it comes from the Lord comes from
[45:49] God any power that is given is given by
[45:52] God hallelujah isn't that right he is
[45:55] omnipotent
[45:57] which means that he is all powerful he
[46:00] is the all powerful God he is the
[46:03] everpresent god he is there when you
[46:06] need him and he can get you out of any
[46:10] trouble or any circumstance that you're
[46:12] in that you might find yourself tonight
[46:15] God has the power tonight to do
[46:18] something about your situation
[46:20] Hallelujah when you run out of power
[46:22] he's just getting started because he is
[46:25] all powerful
[46:27] isn't that right he has the power to do
[46:29] whatever he wants to do whatever he
[46:32] desires to do that he will do because he
[46:36] is all
[46:38] powerful isn't that right as the
[46:40] scripture says he is before all things
[46:44] uh before there was anything else there
[46:45] was God so that anything that exists was
[46:49] created by this all powerful God he he
[46:52] literally made it he spoke it he created
[46:55] it into existence
[46:57] um and just by that alone he is all
[47:00] powerful isn't that right everything we
[47:03] see around us was created by God
[47:06] himself amen so so uh before he was
[47:11] before all things by him all things
[47:14] consist and in other words there's
[47:16] nothing that exists that God doesn't
[47:18] know about and more than that he just
[47:21] doesn't know about it it's just that he
[47:23] just doesn't know about it but he has
[47:25] power over it tonight
[47:27] amen and amen do you believe that
[47:29] tonight he knows about everything and he
[47:31] doesn't just know about it but he has
[47:34] the power to do something about it he
[47:36] knows about every situation he knows
[47:40] every time a fly bats his eye he he
[47:43] knows how much number of the hairs are
[47:45] on your head tonight he knows what every
[47:48] situation is every how much billions of
[47:51] millions of people on the Earth right
[47:53] now just think about it he knows about
[47:55] every single one tonight and more than
[47:59] that he can do something about it he has
[48:02] power over every single one he can raise
[48:05] up kingdoms he could bring down kingdoms
[48:09] the same God that released Joseph into
[48:12] Egypt to bless Egypt and to make Egypt
[48:15] Prosper for 14 years prophecy of Famine
[48:20] of of for seven years of plenty and
[48:23] seven years of famine the same God that
[48:25] released Joseph into Egypt was the same
[48:27] God that reliefed Moses into that same
[48:30] Egypt to judge ebit and bring it down
[48:33] and to say Let My People Go isn't that
[48:35] right the same God that raised them up
[48:37] is the same God that could bring them
[48:39] down because he is all powerful oh
[48:43] Hallelujah whatever he wants to do he
[48:44] could do it tonight amen amen hallelujah
[48:48] isn't that right hallelujah hallelujah
[48:51] all power belongs to
[48:54] God there's no power on Earth that we
[48:56] know of uh that is higher than the power
[48:59] of God tonight isn't that right amen uh
[49:04] and the Bible says that God is light
[49:07] isn't that right and in him there is no
[49:10] Darkness at all isn't that right as 1
[49:13] John 5 said and then then this then is
[49:16] the message which ye have heard of him
[49:19] and declare unto you that God is light
[49:23] and in him is no Darkness at all
[49:27] and if we say that we have fellowship
[49:29] with him and walk in darkness we lie and
[49:33] we do not the truth because there's
[49:36] light and there's Darkness there is a
[49:39] differentiation between the two light
[49:42] cannot exist where darkness is oh God
[49:46] draw a line in the beginning when he
[49:48] spoke let there be light he separated
[49:51] light from Darkness therefore light and
[49:54] darkness cannot coexist in the same
[49:57] space Oh when light comes in darkness
[50:01] knows where to go Darkness has to push
[50:04] back oh hallelujah hallelujah Hal when
[50:07] God comes into a situation Darkness has
[50:11] to know where to go oh Darkness cannot
[50:14] sit around and cross his legs and act
[50:17] like nothing is going on no the
[50:19] situation is different God is now in the
[50:21] building when God is in the building oh
[50:25] now the impossible can be made possible
[50:28] now something can happen that never
[50:31] happened before go isn't that right Mary
[50:35] told Jesus said if my brother was here
[50:39] if if you were here my brother would not
[50:41] have died but even so you are able to do
[50:45] something tonight oh she knew that if
[50:48] Jesus was in the building her brother
[50:51] would not have died because wherever
[50:53] Jesus goes the sick cannot stay sick
[50:57] wherever Jesus goes the dead cannot stay
[51:00] dead wherever Jesus goes the blind
[51:03] cannot stay blind oh Hallelujah if you
[51:06] would have been here my brother would
[51:09] not have died if he is here tonight
[51:12] something's got to happen you can't be
[51:15] in the presence of Jesus and you remain
[51:18] the same way or wherever Jesus goes
[51:21] change is happening wherever Jesus goes
[51:25] he interrupts the atmosphere he
[51:28] interrupts the radio waves he jams the
[51:31] signals of the enemy he jams the signals
[51:34] of Lucifer the devil is pound oh
[51:38] wherever light goes the darkness is
[51:40] pound oh but the light that has come in
[51:44] and there is a light on the earth
[51:46] tonight that light is here to rescue you
[51:49] from Darkness to pluck your soul out of
[51:53] loud deia that light has sh
[51:57] oh upon planted seed tonight to bring
[52:01] forth a harvest in the last day oh do
[52:04] you believe it tonight glory to God
[52:08] hallelujah
[52:09] hallelujah oh in God is
[52:13] light there is no darkness in
[52:16] him that scripture continues and says if
[52:19] we say that we have fellowship with him
[52:22] and walk in darkness we lie and do not
[52:24] the truth if we walk in the light as he
[52:28] is in the light then we have Fellowship
[52:31] one with another we can't hardly say we
[52:34] in the light and not be able to shake
[52:37] hands with one another that's not light
[52:40] that's Darkness you got to be able to
[52:42] shake your brother's hand you've got to
[52:45] be able to say I forgive you you've got
[52:47] to be able to make it right you've got
[52:49] to be able to meet on common ground and
[52:52] the blood of Jesus Christ puts us all on
[52:55] Common Ground tonight
[52:57] because the same blood for me is the
[52:59] same blood for you tonight and if God
[53:02] died for me if Jesus died for me oh then
[53:05] what about you here tonight oh he died
[53:08] for you too oh that means I ought to
[53:10] love you with the same love that he love
[53:12] me with an unconditional love a love
[53:16] that goes past your circumstance past
[53:18] what you was past what you did saw
[53:22] beyond your faults and saw your needs oh
[53:26] and loved you Hallelujah Des spite of
[53:28] everything else he loved you without a
[53:32] reason to love you he just loves you and
[53:35] how the bride tonight ought to love with
[53:37] that same kind of love because when the
[53:40] spirit of God comes upon her she's going
[53:42] to be just like Jesus she's going to be
[53:45] able to love just like Jesus she's going
[53:48] to be able to forgive just like Jesus
[53:50] she's going to be able to walk in that
[53:52] newness of life just like Jesus amen Hal
[53:56] Hallelujah isn't that right oh flesh of
[53:59] his flesh bone of his bone Spirit of his
[54:03] spirit in the likeness of God uh is what
[54:07] we are predestined to come into that
[54:10] kind of a condition isn't that right
[54:14] amen amen hallelujah glory to God oh my
[54:18] that's wonderful all right so we say if
[54:20] we walk in the light as we in the light
[54:22] we have Fellowship one with another and
[54:24] the blood of Jesus Christ his son
[54:26] cleanses us from all sin and if we say
[54:29] we have no sin we deceive ourselves and
[54:32] the truth is not in us oh Hallelujah we
[54:35] couldn't save ourselves oh we were born
[54:37] in sin shap in iniquity come in the
[54:39] world speaking Lies We have to
[54:41] acknowledge each and every one of us
[54:44] that Christ's blood atonement was for us
[54:47] to save us out of sin amen amen to not
[54:51] confess This Is A Lie isn't that right
[54:54] oh my so if we say you have not sined we
[54:56] make a M isn't that right okay so God is
[54:59] a Creator isn't that right because he is
[55:02] he has the power to create but brandham
[55:06] said he also has the power to heal it
[55:09] just makes sense because he he's the one
[55:11] who manufactured the human body in the
[55:13] first place uh he knows everything
[55:16] that's wrong with it and if he created
[55:18] it the first time then he can fix what's
[55:21] wrong with the body he knows everything
[55:24] that's he's the Creator isn't is that
[55:26] right he's the author of The Thing of
[55:29] this big machine called the human body
[55:32] that to this day science are still
[55:34] baffled by how the human body has the
[55:36] ability to heal itself and to and to and
[55:39] to and to and to do things that that
[55:41] seem like science still trying to figure
[55:43] that out uh but that the Genesis of that
[55:46] the origin of Life comes from God it's a
[55:50] mystery that they can't crack Hallelujah
[55:52] but it's not for them to figure out it's
[55:54] for them to believe oh oh Hallelujah if
[55:57] now can believe all things are possible
[55:59] tonight the same God that spoke man from
[56:02] the dust of the earth and breathe breath
[56:04] into man and made man a living soul is
[56:07] the same God that can heal that man
[56:09] tonight of every disease of every
[56:12] sickness of every situation it's the
[56:15] same God that can minister to you oh
[56:18] hallelujah hallelujah man end up in a
[56:20] fallen condition but he hasn't fallen so
[56:23] far that God cannot save him has never
[56:26] fallen that far that God cannot reach
[56:29] him because God is all powerful tonight
[56:33] he is omnipotent there's nowhere he
[56:35] doesn't know about there's nothing he
[56:37] doesn't know about there's no one he
[56:40] cannot see oh H he can see all he knows
[56:44] all and he has power over everything
[56:47] tonight
[56:49] oh he has power in your circumstance
[56:53] power over your situation whatever you
[56:55] have need of tonight he has power to
[56:58] heal your sickness power to deliver you
[57:02] power to break the chains power to
[57:04] deliver power to restore power to cure
[57:09] from mental illness from emotional or
[57:11] whatever it is God has the ability
[57:14] tonight he is all powerful oh hallelujah
[57:18] hallelujah the word of God would have
[57:21] you to know that oh Hallelujah
[57:25] [Music]
[57:28] amen hallelujah the devil would have us
[57:30] to not believe that tonight but we
[57:33] believe the word tonight he is a Creator
[57:37] and he has the power to create isn't
[57:38] that right therefore he has the power to
[57:40] heal amen it just comes with the
[57:43] portfolio amen isn't that right it's a
[57:45] subdivision of the portfolio of creation
[57:48] isn't that right amen amen I like to
[57:50] think of it like a like a phone there
[57:53] are certain aspects of a smartphone that
[57:55] we know nothing about
[57:57] we just use it on the surface level some
[57:59] of us use it to make phone calls some of
[58:02] us have become familiar with WhatsApp uh
[58:05] some of us are more familiar with social
[58:07] media platforms and maybe they use your
[58:09] phone for a camera some people use it
[58:11] for a calculator some people use it for
[58:14] a notepad there are many uses of a phone
[58:17] but there are certain hidden features
[58:19] inside of a phone that you will not know
[58:21] about those stuff is what they call
[58:24] manufacturer Developers stuff that that
[58:27] that's deep knowledge of the of of the
[58:29] smartphone there's some stuff that the
[58:31] manufacturer put in the phone that you
[58:34] may scarcely know about uh but if ever
[58:37] the need arises for them to maybe
[58:40] restore your phone or to bring it back
[58:42] to factory settings there's a place that
[58:45] you could do that you you may not know
[58:47] about that off hand you might have to
[58:49] research that or look it up but
[58:51] somewhere along making that phone the
[58:54] developer the manufacturer put certain
[58:57] Safeguard settings in that phone so that
[59:00] if anything could go wrong he could
[59:03] reset that phone back to its
[59:05] manufacturer condition or he can go in
[59:07] and find things that you wouldn't
[59:09] normally find there are codes that you
[59:11] could punch in to your regular phone uh
[59:14] function and have access to other parts
[59:16] of your phone you could test the
[59:18] vibrator you could test your screen
[59:20] brightness you can test the RGB settings
[59:22] there are many things that are hidden in
[59:24] a phone where God knows about us tonight
[59:27] because he is our manufacturer and God
[59:30] has a way to get to us tonight when the
[59:34] world bathes you over with doubt bathes
[59:37] you over with fear f up your device with
[59:41] all kinds of stuff and you feel all
[59:43] Heavenly Laden when you come to the
[59:46] manufacturer the manufacturer is a way
[59:49] of getting down into the settings and
[59:51] tuning you in such a way oh that you
[59:54] could he could offload stuff off of you
[59:57] that you didn't think was possible he is
[59:59] doing stuff that normal people cannot do
[1:00:02] because he's the one that made it in the
[1:00:04] beginning and if he created us and not
[1:00:07] we ourselves that we are his people and
[1:00:11] we are the Sheep of his pasture oh then
[1:00:14] tonight enter into his gates with
[1:00:16] Thanksgiving and enter his courts with
[1:00:19] praise tonight and be
[1:00:21] thankful and bless his name because he
[1:00:25] is able to do EX lead inly
[1:00:27] abundantly above all we could ask or
[1:00:29] think hallu he knows every single part
[1:00:32] of you tonight and he knows exactly how
[1:00:35] to fix it he's all
[1:00:38] knowing and he's all powerful isn't now
[1:00:41] God glorious tonight amen amen amen and
[1:00:46] I like to think of faith faith is like a
[1:00:49] hack to your operating system CU Anytime
[1:00:54] God want to get to you he don't come
[1:00:56] through your five senses he come through

[1:01:07] operating way of getting to you oh that
[1:01:10] them that the other people don't know
[1:01:12] about because he's the manufacturer he's
[1:01:14] the developer and Faith have a way of
[1:01:17] bypassing your human senses bypassing
[1:01:19] your thoughts bypassing your intellect
[1:01:22] bypassing how you feel bypassing what
[1:01:24] you think faith have a way of hacking
[1:01:26] your routes and getting straight to the
[1:01:28] device and powering you up oh all of a
[1:01:32] sudden you on fire and you don't know
[1:01:34] how you're unexp expectation and you
[1:01:36] don't know how that's fate doing
[1:01:39] something for you that's the
[1:01:41] manufacturer that's the developer
[1:01:43] working his stuff oh Hallelujah and in
[1:01:47] every age he found a way to get to the
[1:01:50] predestinated oh he bypass your learned
[1:01:53] he bypass your thoughts he bypass your
[1:01:55] flesh he bypass all your fear oh and he
[1:01:59] hacked that whole thing and went
[1:02:01] straight down into your heart and
[1:02:03] dropped the word of God in there and
[1:02:05] tell the devil do what you want to them
[1:02:07] but they're going to come through anyhow
[1:02:10] come through Waters come through flood
[1:02:13] come through Peril come through
[1:02:16] storm but faith in your soul make you
[1:02:20] stand
[1:02:21] up in a most unearthly
[1:02:24] Way You Are
[1:02:26] standing somehow amidst it all you are
[1:02:31] standing Faith makes you do that that's
[1:02:34] the developers
[1:02:35] options that's the manufacturer's uh
[1:02:38] special
[1:02:39] technique of how to find his people
[1:02:42] throughout all the ages he's been able
[1:02:45] to do that amen because he is the
[1:02:48] Creator and he knows about what he has
[1:02:52] created everything serves a purpose
[1:02:56] everything is for a time isn't that
[1:02:58] right oh my so but Braham said he also
[1:03:02] has the power to heal he said many times

[1:08:53] said do Prophet said said I'll meet you
[1:08:55] in the morning amen isn't that right oh
[1:08:59] my so there's a power of God and there's
[1:09:02] also the power of darkness which is a
[1:09:04] power in itself but it only exists when
[1:09:08] there's no light isn't that right
[1:09:10] because light and darkness can't live in
[1:09:13] the same space when light comes in
[1:09:15] darkness has to push back therefore the
[1:09:19] devil is and Satan is of the darkness
[1:09:21] isn't that right darkness is the absent
[1:09:24] of light when there is no light there
[1:09:27] then Darkness takes
[1:09:28] over we don't really measure Darkness
[1:09:31] there's no one walking around the
[1:09:32] instrument saying it's it's 10% dark or
[1:09:34] 20% dark uh we measure how much light
[1:09:37] there is in a room but scarcely do we
[1:09:40] ever think of measuring the darkness the
[1:09:42] darkness is only there because there is
[1:09:44] no light Hallelujah and Satan is only
[1:09:47] running around uh running around parad
[1:09:49] himself on this world because the sons
[1:09:52] of God are out of their position that is
[1:09:54] why the dark has pervaded and and taken
[1:09:57] over the world taken over the religious
[1:09:59] realm taken over the political realm
[1:10:01] taken over this realm and that realm and
[1:10:02] education and Science and politics and
[1:10:05] he's just running a mock because there
[1:10:07] he's running around unchecked because
[1:10:10] the sons of God are yet to take up their
[1:10:12] rightful place in the position that God
[1:10:15] had for them to be in since the
[1:10:17] beginning of time oh how about we
[1:10:19] believe tonight that there is another
[1:10:22] people in the land who under their Miss
[1:10:25] Messenger will be the final voice to the
[1:10:28] final age and they are going to take up
[1:10:31] their position in the word of God as
[1:10:34] Sons and Daughters of the Living God and
[1:10:37] they are going to challenge the enemy
[1:10:39] challenge every Power challenge every
[1:10:42] Spirit challenge every ruler of Darkness
[1:10:45] challenge every spiritual wickedness
[1:10:47] challenge every sickness every disease
[1:10:51] every doubt every fear they're going to
[1:10:54] march on top of sickness they're going
[1:10:56] to march on top of fear John said we
[1:11:00] shall rain on the earth when he saw the
[1:11:03] Lamb of God step out and took the
[1:11:08] book he began to shout and jump
[1:11:13] why cuz positional power placing was
[1:11:17] coming back into position and the world
[1:11:20] was going to come back into position
[1:11:22] don't you know all creation is groaning
[1:11:25] and
[1:11:26] travailing and burdening and burning and
[1:11:29] crying and screaming waiting for the
[1:11:31] sons of God to come back into position
[1:11:35] oh nature is having a prayer meeting
[1:11:38] going back and forth Lord send your sons
[1:11:41] Lord wake up your daughters tonight Lord
[1:11:44] get them on fire if you're not on fire
[1:11:47] nature is groaning and travailing
[1:11:50] somebody got a groan somebody got a pray
[1:11:54] Jesus told the pH SE one time if these
[1:11:57] people don't worship me even the rocks
[1:12:00] are going to cry out oh are that Messiah
[1:12:03] is on the earth now there's got to be a
[1:12:06] people on the land tonight who recognize
[1:12:09] the Messiah is here and that seed in
[1:12:12] their soul is speaking
[1:12:14] back so as we would see Jesus we shall
[1:12:18] see the
[1:12:20] King when he comes isn't that right oh
[1:12:24] my
[1:12:25] my my
[1:12:28] my
[1:12:30] glory when God comes in his presence
[1:12:33] comes in then what happens the enemy
[1:12:36] comes P becomes powerless cuz light is
[1:12:38] in the room and it blinds the darkness
[1:12:42] there are some animals who cannot
[1:12:44] operate in such light they get blinded
[1:12:47] by it cockroaches looking for a dark
[1:12:50] space as soon as light come in they they
[1:12:52] run and hide because they can't they
[1:12:55] can't deal with that bats cannot deal
[1:12:58] with that there certain animals that
[1:12:59] just cannot exist they can't they can't
[1:13:02] function praise God when the light comes
[1:13:04] in oh Hallelujah and there are demons
[1:13:07] that cannot function when the light
[1:13:09] comes in there are spirits that begin to
[1:13:11] get agitated when light comes in the
[1:13:14] room and when you walk in the room and
[1:13:17] God's light is following you then there
[1:13:19] are spirits that become agitated because
[1:13:22] a Son of God just walked in the room oh
[1:13:25] they begin to get weary they begin to
[1:13:26] get ansy throw us in the pigs throw us
[1:13:29] in the pigs how do you come to torment
[1:13:31] us before time oh H they know hallu

[1:15:42] getting ready to move we believe it with
[1:15:45] all our hearts isn't that right oh my
[1:15:48] let me hurry along here now so we got
[1:15:50] that right where light is Darkness fleas
[1:15:53] amen isn't that right in the beginning
[1:15:55] the word was without form and void
[1:15:56] Darkness upon the Earth God spoke and
[1:15:58] said let there be light and he addressed
[1:16:00] the darkness by speaking the light he
[1:16:03] said let there be
[1:16:05] light he didn't try to argue with the
[1:16:07] darkness pull the darkness fight to the
[1:16:09] darkness no he had no communion with the
[1:16:11] darkness because in him is no Darkness
[1:16:14] so his way of dealing with darkness is
[1:16:17] speaking light oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:16:21] hallelujah glory to God amen hallelujah
[1:16:23] amen amen
[1:16:25] and so today we can address the darkness
[1:16:27] tonight by speaking light oh by speaking
[1:16:31] Life by speaking the word of God don't
[1:16:34] get caught up in the negative don't get
[1:16:36] caught up in what the devil say and what
[1:16:38] the doctors say speak light say I am the
[1:16:41] Lord that Health thee out of all that
[1:16:43] diseases oh Hallelujah I am your
[1:16:45] deliverer I am your healer I believe on
[1:16:49] you Lord you are able to defeat the
[1:16:52] darkness you are able to heal the sick I
[1:16:54] know oh even now Lord you could do
[1:16:57] something oh
[1:16:59] hallelujah oh glory to God amen amen
[1:17:02] hallelujah hallelujah speak the light
[1:17:06] and watch your Darkness
[1:17:07] flee amen take that to work with you
[1:17:10] tomorrow amen speak light into your
[1:17:14] situation Speak Life into the darkness
[1:17:17] and watch it change isn't that right
[1:17:21] praise God I heard a preacher say one
[1:17:22] time he said God turns the
[1:17:25] when you begin to pray then the tide of
[1:17:28] The Battle Turns then the tides turn
[1:17:31] when you begin to pray when you begin to
[1:17:33] call on God when you begin to release
[1:17:35] from your mouth your faith and desire
[1:17:38] for what you want then God begin to move
[1:17:41] on that Fai because faith is a currency
[1:17:44] for God to move in your situation and
[1:17:47] when you begin to release that unto God
[1:17:49] then the tide of the battle begins to
[1:17:51] turn oh Hal because you begin to
[1:17:53] recognize the power of of prayer and
[1:17:56] what you can do about it oh Hallelujah
[1:17:58] hallelu because he is all
[1:18:01] powerful we are not trying to do it in
[1:18:03] ourselves we know that there's a God
[1:18:05] that can do it that can do more than we
[1:18:08] could ever do when we pray and when we
[1:18:11] call upon him isn't that right amen
[1:18:14] praise God so the power of light is more
[1:18:15] powerful isn't that right than the power
[1:18:18] of Darkness Satan's power isn't really a
[1:18:20] power at all it's a perversion of the
[1:18:22] original but Bram said that isn't that
[1:18:24] right a li is a truth Mist told isn't
[1:18:26] that right so the whole thing see see so
[1:18:29] he just perverts what is already there
[1:18:31] but he cannot create amen isn't that
[1:18:33] right so his his appearance of power is
[1:18:36] just what he's able to twist and warp
[1:18:38] praise God Amen isn't that right so he
[1:18:40] told Eve you shall not surely die he
[1:18:42] twist the word and then it became a dark
[1:18:45] power praise God because it was a
[1:18:47] misrepresented word that swed a a seed
[1:18:50] of misrepresentation and threw the whole
[1:18:52] thing down that's his power his power is
[1:18:54] just taking what is already there and
[1:18:56] warping it and bending it into his evil
[1:18:58] purpose into his evil intent but if it
[1:19:00] ever comes back on track if if it ever
[1:19:03] gets restored back into position then
[1:19:05] the devil is powerless oh Hallelujah
[1:19:08] that's why our job tonight is to get
[1:19:10] back into position is to get back into
[1:19:13] alignment with the word of God if we
[1:19:15] could ever get back oh Hallelujah to
[1:19:18] where we were where were you when the
[1:19:20] sons of God shout it for Joy when the
[1:19:22] morning Stars sign together if if you
[1:19:24] could ever get into alignment with the
[1:19:27] word of God for your day the devil will
[1:19:29] be powerless before you oh
[1:19:33] hallelujah amen amen amen glory to God
[1:19:38] Amen so that's where we want to be
[1:19:40] tonight by the grace of godall Amen okay
[1:19:43] it's the gospel truth isn't that all
[1:19:44] right all right so he said uh but said
[1:19:46] let me tell you don't refuse the light
[1:19:48] of uh light of Gospel of Jesus Christ it
[1:19:51] brings a warm raise of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:53] upon you makes a new creature in Christ
[1:19:56] Jesus don't try to walk in the glare of
[1:19:58] some other age now that glare might have
[1:20:00] been all right in another age but it
[1:20:02] might be all right for them see now the
[1:20:04] Jews thought that they were worshiping
[1:20:05] the True Light they thought that they
[1:20:07] were worshiping the same God that they
[1:20:09] were turning down the very one that they
[1:20:12] thought they were worshiping they were
[1:20:14] crucifying they were making fun of the
[1:20:16] very God and making him a laughing stock
[1:20:19] of the people at the very God that they
[1:20:22] thought that they were worshiping isn't
[1:20:23] that something oh they thought they
[1:20:25] worshiping the god of their fathers and
[1:20:27] here he was in the form of Christ being
[1:20:29] uh tormented crucified rejected oh wow
[1:20:34] what a condition he said may I say this
[1:20:35] with reverence and respect but to bring
[1:20:37] light he said because as our brother
[1:20:39] said a while ago we're living later than
[1:20:41] you think we are he said in one of these
[1:20:44] days something is going to happen it's
[1:20:46] going to be too late the people will
[1:20:49] take the mark of the beast not knowing
[1:20:52] what they are doing thinking that they
[1:20:54] worship sh shipping God or doing them a
[1:20:56] service isn't that right oh my not even
[1:20:58] knowing what they're doing blind leading
[1:20:59] the blind and they'll all fall in the
[1:21:01] ditch see Jesus said we're living later
[1:21:04] than we think he said many honest people
[1:21:07] follow that not even knowing what
[1:21:09] they're doing he said see uh but the
[1:21:11] hour is at hand now when the light is
[1:21:14] shining this Gospel Light he said and in
[1:21:17] its power of the resurrection of Jesus
[1:21:20] Christ he said and it's manifesting
[1:21:23] himself that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:21:25] yesterday today and forever he lotted
[1:21:29] that for this day and the things that he
[1:21:32] promise for this day must happen in this
[1:21:35] day he said and if the church don't
[1:21:37] accept it then God is able of these
[1:21:40] stones to raise children unto Abraham he
[1:21:45] will get his message over one way or
[1:21:47] another that there'll be a people
[1:21:49] elected to find that message amen oh I'm
[1:21:52] so glad we found it tonight praise God
[1:21:55] hallelujah hallelujah he will get his
[1:21:58] message over because he's always done it
[1:22:01] he'll always do it isn't that right
[1:22:03] Prophet said here and hear him he said
[1:22:05] if Satan can heal God told God told
[1:22:07] something wrong he said Jesus said Satan
[1:22:09] cannot heal uh uh to be a Healer he'd
[1:22:11] have to be a Creator if he's a Creator
[1:22:14] then he's God see so that that whole
[1:22:16] theology won't work see Satan can't
[1:22:19] create he he perverts what God has
[1:22:21] created he is not a Creator he's a
[1:22:24] pervert
[1:22:25] he said righteous he said what is sin
[1:22:27] righteous is perverted correctly now let
[1:22:29] us be Reverend for a moment he said if
[1:22:31] you will only believe isn't that right
[1:22:33] oh my so something I want to get to here
[1:22:34] before we close out so when God created
[1:22:37] the Earth there was actually a vacancy
[1:22:39] position he created the moon he created
[1:22:42] the Stars he created the Sun the animals
[1:22:44] the planets everything working perfectly
[1:22:46] and just before he went off on his rest
[1:22:48] on the seventh day there was one more
[1:22:50] project God needed to take care of
[1:22:52] because he had created a whole domain
[1:22:54] now he had created a whole Earthly realm
[1:22:58] and even though he was God over all he
[1:23:01] needed somebody to manage and run this
[1:23:03] thing called Earth isn't that right he
[1:23:05] needed somebody to run this domain uh uh
[1:23:08] on Earth on Earthly matters praise God
[1:23:11] so what did he do he created man isn't
[1:23:13] that right isn't that right he said uh
[1:23:17] so so he created a being called man to
[1:23:20] rule over this Earthly realm yes amen it
[1:23:23] was a vacancy it was a it was a it was a
[1:23:26] job position that needed to be
[1:23:28] fulfilled uh uh uh and there was no
[1:23:30] nobody really worthy to take the
[1:23:32] application because monkeys couldn't do
[1:23:34] it the the elephants and the horses and
[1:23:36] they all that that stuff going on so God
[1:23:38] had to make somebody that he could uh
[1:23:41] put in charge of this of this earth and
[1:23:43] the world and look at the the criteria
[1:23:47] now here he said that this being was
[1:23:48] called man uh God made man in the
[1:23:50] beginning gave him the job description
[1:23:52] right so Genesis 1:26 he said and God
[1:23:55] said let us make man how in our own
[1:23:58] image and after our own likeness oh so
[1:24:01] that is the prerequisite if you are to
[1:24:04] rule over this Earth You have to be in
[1:24:06] His image and you have to be in his
[1:24:09] likeness God is not going to let anybody
[1:24:12] Hallelujah Rule and Reign Over this
[1:24:14] Earth unless he fits the criteria for
[1:24:18] the job description he's got to pass the
[1:24:20] test oh he's got to be in God's image
[1:24:23] and he's to be in God's likeness oh
[1:24:27] hallelujah
[1:24:28] hallelujah so God is all powerful but he
[1:24:32] has the ability to give power but he
[1:24:34] only giv power if you meet this criteria
[1:24:37] here tonight and that's where the seven
[1:24:39] tunders come in because those seven
[1:24:42] tunders is a Life of Christ to put back
[1:24:44] in us what Adam had to fit the criteria
[1:24:48] oh hallelujah hallelujah they they see
[1:24:50] it now so the vacancy the position has
[1:24:54] to be filled now because this man who
[1:24:57] was created an image and likeness of God
[1:24:59] and then look at the job description he
[1:25:00] said and let that man have dominion this
[1:25:03] is the job description now this is the
[1:25:05] the domain that he is going in charge of
[1:25:08] so he matches the description he has a
[1:25:11] likeness and image and now this is what
[1:25:13] he will do he has dominion over the fish
[1:25:16] of the sea and over the foul of the air
[1:25:19] and over the cattle and over all of the
[1:25:22] earth and over every creeping thing that
[1:25:26] creepeth upon the Earth this man
[1:25:29] Hallelujah has dominion over all of it
[1:25:33] aen amen amen amen amen
[1:25:37] glory amen glory so God is very Thor
[1:25:40] Amen in his description the job comes
[1:25:43] with perks and everything else it's all
[1:25:45] in the in the sign amen is that right
[1:25:48] but this man fell from that position as
[1:25:50] we know uh when the devil come and
[1:25:52] introduce sin and so forth like Now
[1:25:54] isn't that right and then Eve fell and
[1:25:56] then she gave the fruit to Adam and he
[1:25:58] fell then we end up with a vacancy now a
[1:26:01] vacancy position that needs to be filled
[1:26:05] praise God but we need to find somebody
[1:26:07] worthy to take up the position oh Hal
[1:26:09] isn't that right praise God and since
[1:26:12] Adam many prophets many likenesses have
[1:26:15] come David and Joseph and Jacob oh many
[1:26:19] great men had walked the Earth but none
[1:26:22] like Hallelujah back there when they had
[1:26:24] an image and likeness of God they they
[1:26:26] come very close they seem very glorious
[1:26:29] but they all had shortcomings they all
[1:26:32] had failings they all had struggles they
[1:26:34] all come very close but they couldn't
[1:26:37] quite meet the job description oh until
[1:26:40] there come one oh that was born sinless
[1:26:44] oh Hallelujah who was virgin born oh
[1:26:48] Hallelujah isn't that right oh and the
[1:26:50] angel appeared to Mary and see you are
[1:26:52] blessed and highly favored for you will
[1:26:54] bring forth a son a child and his name
[1:26:57] will be called Jesus oh and when Jesus
[1:27:00] was born here was the first one since
[1:27:04] thousands of years of time he was the
[1:27:07] first man to walk the earth that it was
[1:27:09] possible that he could meet this job
[1:27:12] description it was possible that he
[1:27:15] could fill this
[1:27:16] vacancy oh but he had to be tested he
[1:27:19] had to be tried he had to be proven he
[1:27:22] went through 18 years of silent
[1:27:24] oh he went through three and a half
[1:27:26] years harder trials oh Hallelujah try
[1:27:29] this way try that way isn't that right
[1:27:31] the phes pointed fingers the Sadducees
[1:27:34] pointed fingers oh but they couldn't
[1:27:36] find fault with him oh even P appeared
[1:27:39] before pilot just before his his his res
[1:27:42] uh his death his crucifixion isn't that
[1:27:44] right and pilate asked are you the king
[1:27:46] of the Jews Hallelujah who are you are
[1:27:49] you the king as they say and Jesus had
[1:27:52] to put him in his place and say my
[1:27:53] father put you where you are and he put
[1:27:56] me where I am so don't you worry about
[1:27:58] it oh Hallelujah Hal my father has power
[1:28:01] over everything Jesus knew that he was
[1:28:05] ruler over all yet he humbled himself or
[1:28:09] to fulfill all righteousness he humbled
[1:28:12] himself to the cross and was slaughtered
[1:28:15] and was killed and was
[1:28:18] crucified so that his blood could be
[1:28:21] released oh Hal hallelujah
[1:28:25] hallelujah why so that more Sons like
[1:28:29] Jesus could come forth because unless a
[1:28:32] corn of wheat fall into the ground and
[1:28:34] die it would abide alone but when it die
[1:28:38] it bringeth forth much fruits and that
[1:28:41] perfect seed that sinless seed went down
[1:28:45] into the ground oh on crucifixion day oh
[1:28:49] he died didn't he die but when on Easter
[1:28:52] morning he Rose from the grave oh and he
[1:28:57] was Victorious and he had all power oh
[1:29:01] over the grave over death over hell over
[1:29:06] sickness over disease he rose up a
[1:29:09] mighty conqueror
[1:29:12] oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
[1:29:15] Hallelujah Hallelujah do you believe it
[1:29:18] tonight amen amen amen oh I'm almost
[1:29:23] finished praise God
[1:29:24] when God made Spirit man in the
[1:29:26] beginning he gave that man dominion over
[1:29:28] the fall of the air over the birds of
[1:29:30] the sea give him an authority the spirit
[1:29:33] in the beginning was perfect no sin no
[1:29:36] unbelief it was a triumphant Spirit an
[1:29:39] overcoming Spirit a spirit that had a
[1:29:41] seven part nature Faith to charity and
[1:29:45] God told them to be fruitful and
[1:29:47] multiply and replenish the Earth that
[1:29:51] was Spirit man and after that he made
[1:29:54] flesh man and man fell and flesh man and
[1:29:56] subject to sin and so forth isn't that
[1:29:57] right but God promised to restore that
[1:30:00] image that he had isn't that right so
[1:30:03] every Prophet that came Abraham Isaac
[1:30:05] Jacob were only shadows and types of
[1:30:07] that perfect one that was to come to
[1:30:09] manifest Perfection but finally here he
[1:30:12] come the Conqueror Jesus Christ the same
[1:30:16] yesterday today and forever that spirit
[1:30:18] that dwelt in Christ brother brand said
[1:30:21] that God emptied himself into Christ all
[1:30:23] that God was his power his presence he
[1:30:27] said when you see me you see the father
[1:30:30] that was God failed oh when he was here
[1:30:34] on Earth he had Dominion do you believe
[1:30:36] that he exercised his power Christ come
[1:30:40] into Dominion by obedience it was lost
[1:30:42] by Adam through Disobedience but Christ
[1:30:45] come into Dominion by obedience to the
[1:30:47] things that he suffered isn't that right
[1:30:49] Christ demonstrated dominion over the
[1:30:51] animal kingdom over the bees over the
[1:30:54] birds over the fish over Human family
[1:30:58] ham sham japet and so forth isn't that
[1:31:00] right over the elements of nature he
[1:31:02] could stop the wind isn't that right the
[1:31:04] Seas roaring he demonstrated your
[1:31:08] Dominion he actually was an example seed
[1:31:10] son and he was on the earth
[1:31:12] demonstrating your Dominion the Dominion
[1:31:15] that you were supposed to have had you
[1:31:17] come in the image and likeness of God
[1:31:19] since the beginning isn't that right but
[1:31:21] you know we come into sin and so forth
[1:31:23] like that so Christ redeemed it all by
[1:31:26] displaying it all and showing it all
[1:31:28] what it was Hallelujah and then in his
[1:31:31] death it was to bring forth the life
[1:31:33] that was to create more Sons to
[1:31:35] demonstrate it all to do the Greater
[1:31:37] Works to heal the sick to raise the dead
[1:31:40] to cast out Devils no wonder brother
[1:31:42] Brandon is on Earth Hallelujah pray he
[1:31:45] spoke little fishy I give you your life
[1:31:47] no wonder when he was here he
[1:31:49] demonstrated those things because it
[1:31:51] wasn't a son it wasn't uh uh brother
[1:31:54] brandham doing it but it was the son of
[1:31:55] man veiled in brother Branham speaking
[1:31:58] the word showing himself again just like
[1:32:02] he did when he was here on Earth having
[1:32:04] dominion over all things isn't that
[1:32:06] right oh my my sees Roy and whatnot he
[1:32:09] had dominion over the spirit realm
[1:32:11] that's related to man over Angels over
[1:32:13] demon Spirits he had Dominion to cast
[1:32:15] out Devils isn't that right he had
[1:32:17] dominion over the human mind itself St
[1:32:21] Luke 4 it is written it is written over
[1:32:24] life what lust of the eyes lust of the
[1:32:26] flesh pride of life isn't that right he
[1:32:28] exercised dominion over everything he
[1:32:31] said the adopted son must have power
[1:32:32] over himself before he can have power
[1:32:34] over others and other things amen isn't
[1:32:37] that right brother Bram said so they
[1:32:38] tried to kill him Jesus said destroy
[1:32:40] this body and in three days I'll raise
[1:32:42] it up myself he said that was God veiled
[1:32:45] I said and when he died that Spirit went
[1:32:47] down into hell took the keys of death
[1:32:50] and hell and then he loosed the
[1:32:52] prisoners and on Easter morning he
[1:32:54] raised from the dead just as sure as he
[1:32:57] would all the devil couldn't stop him
[1:32:59] and if that same Spirit ever dwelt in
[1:33:02] another human being it would do the
[1:33:04] exact same thing oh just like he
[1:33:08] conquered on Easter morning there'll be
[1:33:10] an Easter for the bride and she'll
[1:33:12] conquer just like he conquered she'll
[1:33:15] heal the sick she will raise the dead

[1:33:47] sickness over every tumor praise over
