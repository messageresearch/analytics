[42:44] he asked a question said how do I guess
[42:46] I'm defying prophets I confess your sins
[42:48] in the presence of the blood of Jesus
[42:50] and the life that come from that blood
[42:54] comes back to the worshiper and
[42:57] sanctifies him from the desires of the
[43:00] things of the world for by that
[43:03] all-sufficient sacrifice he has
[43:06] sanctified us once appeared we are all
[43:08] baptized into one body and now there is
[43:11] no condemnation to them which are in
[43:12] Christ Jesus to them that walk not after
[43:15] the flesh but the Spirit if you're
[43:18] trying to walk by the spirit and still
[43:19] lusting for the flesh the sacrifice
[43:21] hasn't been sufficiently applied to you
[43:23] but the worshiper wants pooch has no
[43:26] more desire of sin he and that was
[43:29] Calvary
[43:30] it wasn't a place to sell flowers it was
[43:32] a little place to do this or that it was
[43:35] a place where God and man were
[43:37] reconciled it was a place where peace
[43:40] and perfect safety was brought to
[43:43] mankind
[43:43] can you go with me tonight my son a
[43:46] friend to Calvary and by faith apply

[55:01] I'll just see it as the Lord gave it to
[55:03] me this past week and I was reflecting
[55:06] on Easter and this week and thinking
[55:08] about the blood and the cross and
[55:09] Calvary and all these things and a
[55:12] question came to my heart said why it
[55:14] had to be blood or why it needed to be
[55:17] blood you know I was just thinking about
[55:19] that you know a lot of times you talk
[55:21] about the blood of Jesus Christ and the
[55:23] sacrifice that he made for us and we
[55:25] appreciate God we thank God for His
[55:28] goodness and for his mercy and sending
[55:30] his only son to die but when then see
[55:33] when you think deeply into it
[55:35] it had to be blood it couldn't be
[55:37] flowers it couldn't be nice things Cain
[55:41] brought nice things but it wasn't that
[55:44] it had to be blood Cain brought the best
[55:47] of the fruits of the garden Cain set it
[55:50] up just right but the revelation
[55:52] required a blood sacrifice a life had to
[55:56] be given in order to take your place
[55:58] tonight you are sitting in this beauty
[56:01] because somebody time to give you a spot
[56:05] to give you a place in God's kingdom
[56:09] it took a death it took a pain
[56:13] it took a sorrow it took a sacrifice for
[56:17] you to be here tonight Oh for you to
[56:19] lift your hands for you the same

[1:25:08] moments they love him man we love into
[1:25:15] 90 man no if I talk for a few moments I
[1:25:17] wanted to speak on why it needed to be
[1:25:19] blood amen
[1:25:21] why it had to be blood why it had to be
[1:25:24] a blood price is nothing but we know
[1:25:27] that in order for something to live
[1:25:29] something has to die it's now something
[1:25:33] has to take its place something had to
[1:25:36] give its life that's the law in the
[1:25:39] spirit realm isn't it well it's not even
[1:25:45] in even if you're practicing witchcraft
[1:25:47] they need some kind of blood sacrifice
[1:25:51] whether it's a human life animal life
[1:25:53] something whatever they want to get
[1:25:56] where there is money power or wealth or
[1:26:01] fame or fortune they have to do that
[1:26:04] they have to set up the altar with a
[1:26:07] candles and blood and fire on stone and
[1:26:11] call upon their God to deliver them to
[1:26:15] give them what they want that's how it
[1:26:17] works in the spirit realm but the
[1:26:19] difference with the Christian is that
[1:26:21] that blood sacrifice was already made
[1:26:24] for us it's already paid for
[1:26:28] you don't have to work yourself up it's
[1:26:31] already paid for he died that you might
[1:26:35] have life tonight that you can have it
[1:26:38] more abundantly
[1:26:39] oh no wonder we give God all the praise
[1:26:46] and glory it's nothing that you could
[1:26:48] have done but it's about what he already
[1:26:50] done before there was a moon before I
[1:26:54] was a star
[1:26:56] and lamb came thought in his mind and
[1:26:59] took the book and loose the seals so
[1:27:03] when Jesus came he knew what he had to
[1:27:05] do because the spirit was leading him
[1:27:08] where he needed to go all the time he
[1:27:11] say
[1:27:11] my always not yet come and he keep
[1:27:14] preaching and prophesy and he little
[1:27:16] sick I'm prophesying but it come on when
[1:27:19] he had to set his face so what'd you
[1:27:21] tell him we could no longer avoid it we
[1:27:24] could no more circumvent it but he had
[1:27:27] to come to his hour he had to come to
[1:27:29] his moment he had to come to his Garden
[1:27:32] of Gethsemane I'm there the Lion of
[1:27:35] Judah reveals when he said not my will
[1:27:39] but I will be done God's Will was
[1:27:43] creature God's purpose was creature than
[1:27:45] his own and the son of port was willing
[1:27:49] to lay his life down for us here tonight
[1:28:01] took a blood price is now it took a
[1:28:06] sacrifice to pay for it you know I
[1:28:10] thought about that ransom you know
[1:28:14] sometimes sometimes you might go
[1:28:15] window-shopping
[1:28:16] it me me and my wife I go
[1:28:18] window-shopping praise God and we look
[1:28:19] around see nice things you know if
[1:28:26] anybody have done that well Quran you
[1:28:28] know you see something nice so it looks
[1:28:30] good
[1:28:30] see that in the window that's wonderful
[1:28:32] a man I'd like to have that you picture
[1:28:34] it in your living room you picked it in
[1:28:35] your bedroom that'll look nice on the
[1:28:37] dresser isn't that right but it might
[1:28:40] grieve you because maybe you don't have
[1:28:41] the money to buy it right now well maybe
[1:28:43] you don't have the means by which to
[1:28:44] purchase it right now so it may grieve
[1:28:47] you because you walk away from it
[1:28:48] because you can't attain to it right now
[1:28:50] maybe the price is too high but what a
[1:28:54] difference it is when when you walk into
[1:28:56] our store you come in to get something
[1:28:59] that you have already bought
[1:29:02] that's such a picture over now you're
[1:29:04] walking into a store to get something
[1:29:06] that you've already bought it belongs to
[1:29:08] you it might have nice things in the
[1:29:11] store that's wonderful but that's not
[1:29:14] what you come for
[1:29:15] you come for was yours you come for what
[1:29:18] you pay for you come forward to abort Oh
[1:29:27] see all-knowing God who knew that man
[1:29:32] was lost
[1:29:33] who knew that man was fallen who knew
[1:29:36] that man was in a condition and he
[1:29:39] needed forgiveness he needed somebody to
[1:29:41] step in but it had to be a kinsman it
[1:29:44] had to be one of us but nobody was
[1:29:48] worried John said no man in heaven I was
[1:29:51] ready to take the book and to loose the
[1:29:54] seals thereof and God knew that but he
[1:29:57] swore by himself that he would restore
[1:30:00] man Hawkins himself because he alone to
[1:30:03] do it so love protected itself and when
[1:30:08] it protected itself
[1:30:10] Sovereign Grace took over and that
