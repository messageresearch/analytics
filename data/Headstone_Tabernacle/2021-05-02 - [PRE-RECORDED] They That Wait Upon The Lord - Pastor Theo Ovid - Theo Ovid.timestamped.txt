[7:55] today
[7:57] he and forever your attitude he can help
[8:00] you
[8:01] he could bring you out he could give you
[8:03] ambition he could inspire you
[8:06] yes he could act to you he could give
[8:08] you a faith like you never know before
[8:10] he could help you to believe for the
[8:12] impossible some of you so
[8:14] short and faith but he can help you to
[8:17] believe the things that you can't see
[8:19] hallelujah it can materialize that's the
[8:22] god we
[8:23] serve we serve an omnipotent god
[8:26] in case you didn't know we tell an
[8:29] all-powerful god just in case
[8:31] you didn't know we serve a healing god a
[8:34] restoring god
[8:36] a reviving god a comforting god
[8:39] one who stayed closer than a brother
[8:41] that's the god that we serve
[8:43] we serve almighty god this morning all
[8:46] giving praise people
[8:49] oh hallelujah you may be seasoned
[8:53] you know some people feel god is a paper
[8:55] god he's just a word
[8:57] god just read an intellectual mind god
[9:00] but this is the god that opened the red
[9:02] sea yes there's a god
[9:04] that say they're going to rain and after
[9:06] 120 years it rained
[9:08] because when does god speak his word
[9:10] must come to pass
[9:11] this god we sell his word can't return
[9:14] forward
[9:15] this god we serve if he said he will
[9:17] deliver you
[9:18] nobody could hold that pack if this god
[9:20] said he's going to restore you
[9:22] nobody could stop that he doesn't do a
[9:25] halfway job
[9:26] he doesn't know how to finish job what
[9:28] he swear by himself
[9:30] he swear because he could do it he's
[9:32] speaking because he can perform it
[9:35] he's speaking because he gets confirmed
[9:37] that's the god we serve
[9:40] oh can somebody say amen
[9:42] [Music]
[9:44] maybe you see that they asked jesus some
[9:47] questions and jesus
[9:49] was trying to bring our ancestors to the
[9:50] end of the world he said you shall hear
[9:52] wars and rumors of wars he said not here
[9:55] he said earthquakes not here
[9:57] nations against nations not yet he said
[10:00] this gospel
[10:01] must be preached and then the end shall
[10:03] come so don't watch outside watch inside
[10:06] for the gospel to be preached then you
[10:09] know what's coming
[10:10] don't bother about wars and rumors and
[10:11] wars don't worry about financial crisis
[10:14] and this happening
[10:15] watch the church to see if the church is
[10:17] getting stronger
[10:18] watch what's happening in service
[10:20] deceived will be empowered

[10:50] man doubting
[10:51] that god could do miracles and here

[10:54] she got pregnant and baby hasn't moved
[10:57] us yet
[10:58] and here it is mary because she a virgin
[11:00] shall conceive of the prophecy and here

[11:20] her position was isaiah 9 6 a virgin
[11:22] shall conceive and that was the only one
[11:24] could fit into that position one virgin
[11:27] one name

[12:04] season by introducing the angel

[15:49] it only seeing chickens and struggling
[15:52] to
[15:52] walk like them struggling to pick up

[16:00] it hatched the eagle it was all over the
[16:02] eagle it just happened to be in the
[16:04] wrong environment
[16:06] you see you see you see if you tell a
[16:08] fish
[16:09] that he has to climb a tree the fish
[16:11] will feel stupid all his life

[16:55] to do what to overcome
[16:58] to shout to praise god to worship
[17:03] when you don't even feel like
[17:04] worshipping the abilities inside of you
[17:07] to create the atmosphere when everybody

[18:35] we're not wearing no tattoo
[18:36] we have a seal it's a seal of god it's a
[18:39] mark
[18:40] and we want to probably wear that mark
[18:42] it's the mark of the holy ghost
[18:44] it's a marker saying that god i've
[18:46] sealed you that god i've called you
[18:48] that you are different you are separated
[18:50] from the world
[18:52] and the things of the world proudly

[19:26] selfishly by their family they are shut
[19:27] down there that god can't use them
[19:30] because their world is limited the field
[19:33] and view is limited
[19:34] but god wants to expand your view yes
[19:37] when you could challenge yourself
[19:39] to really step out to live for others

[19:45] higher than you
[19:46] somebody got lift off the dung hip lift

[25:56] through it all hallelujah
[26:11] trust in god
[26:25] [Music]
[26:29] amen we want to go to the world
[26:33] we're learning to depend upon this with
[26:35] isaiah 40. reading verse 28 to 31
[26:39] isaiah 59 1 verse 19
[26:42] and matthew chapter 13 verse 24 to 30
[26:46] reading isaiah 40.
[26:52] in verse 28 has thou not known
[26:55] has thou not heard that the everlasting
[26:58] god the lord the creator of the ends of
[27:00] the earth
[27:00] fainted not neither is wary
[27:04] there is no searching of his
[27:05] understanding
[27:07] he give it power to the faint and to
[27:10] them that have no might he increases
[27:12] strength
[27:14] even the youth shall faint and be very
[27:16] and the young men shall
[27:17] utterly fall but they that wait upon the
[27:21] lord
[27:22] shall renew their strength they shall
[27:24] mount to put wings as
[27:26] eagles they shall run and not be wary
[27:29] they shall walk and not faint
[27:32] isaiah 59 verse 19
[27:41] so shall they fear the name of the lord
[27:42] from the west and his glory from the
[27:44] rising of the sun
[27:46] when the enemy shall come in like a
[27:48] flood the spirit of the lord
[27:50] shall lift up a standard against him
[27:53] in matthew chapter 13 we want to read
[27:55] from verse 24.
[28:04] another problem what he thought of them
[28:06] seeing
[28:11] matthew 13 who is 24.
[28:16] matthew is right after the last book of
[28:18] the old testament
[28:25] another parable put he fought unto them
[28:27] saying the kingdom of heaven is
[28:29] lightened unto a man
[28:30] which sowed good seed in his field and
[28:33] while
[28:34] men slept his enemy came and sowed tears
[28:38] among the wheat
[28:39] and went his way when the blade was
[28:42] sprung up
[28:43] and brought forth fruit then appeared to
[28:46] tears also
[28:48] so the servant of the householder came
[28:49] and said unto him sir
[28:51] this thou not so good seed and i feel
[28:54] from whence then hearted tears
[28:56] he said unto them an enemy had done this
[28:59] the servants said
[29:00] unto him without them that we go and
[29:02] guard them up
[29:03] he said nay lease while you guard up the
[29:05] tears you root up
[29:06] also the wheat with them let
[29:09] boat grow together until the harvest
[29:13] and in the time of harvest i will gather
[29:17] i will say to the reapers gather
[29:19] together first of tears
[29:20] buy them in bundles to burn them but
[29:23] gather the wheat into my pan let's pray
[29:25] fatherly thank you
[29:26] for your word interpret it your hearts
[29:28] bless it bless those who would be
[29:30] hearing it
[29:30] and jesus may ask it amen and amen you
[29:33] may be seated praise god
[29:36] blessed be the name of the lord
[29:38] hallelujah it's great to be here
[29:41] looking forward for a wonderful time in
[29:42] the word
[29:44] in the lord we already know that god
[29:46] this bible is god in print
[29:48] so what to hear is the word of the lord
[29:50] well there's always jesus
[29:51] in red speak in this parable hallelujah
[29:54] a man saw his field and the enemy
[29:56] came and saw it and just walked away
[29:58] disappeared
[30:00] and he hadn't seen anything he's so on
[30:01] the silence too hallelujah just
[30:04] disappeared
[30:05] and when they begin to grow the man came
[30:07] and said but hey you saw good seeds here
[30:09] how come these tears doing here you say
[30:11] yeah enemy did it
[30:13] should i cut them no no no i don't want
[30:15] one miss
[30:16] i don't want to reap i don't want to
[30:18] pull out the wrong wheat
[30:20] isn't that right so i have a title they
[30:22] that wait upon the lord
[30:24] that's what i have this morning a title
[30:26] deeds wait upon the lord
[30:28] i have a subject waiting on god
[30:31] and waiting for god
[30:34] this is the process of character
[30:36] development and i have an inspiration
[30:39] cutting you down to the world only see
[30:42] we got to be
[30:43] cut we got to be cheap a lot of people
[30:46] don't like the cutting they like to
[30:47] shave and they like
[30:48] the chicken and chips gospel you know
[30:50] take it back and go
[30:52] and so on but it have where you have to
[30:55] be cut down to the word only
[30:57] because this bride is going to be the
[30:58] word how many believe that
[31:01] sober branham and taitara age you were
[31:04] sharing this i know that works
[31:05] love service faith thy patience thy
[31:07] works and the last to be more than the
[31:09] first
[31:10] i know that works the son of god said
[31:12] believe me for the work's sake
[31:14] he put an emphasis on his own works
[31:16] while on earth the works that he did
[31:18] were ordained of god
[31:19] to inspire faith in him it was a great
[31:20] part of his ministry and the holy spirit
[31:23] in the apostle paul
[31:24] said we are his workmanship created in
[31:27] christ jesus and the good works
[31:28] which god had ordained that we should
[31:30] walk in them these
[31:32] works were to inspire faith in him as
[31:35] they show
[31:35] forth the relationship to him that paul
[31:37] described as created in him
[31:39] now works will never take the place of
[31:42] faith in god for our salvation
[31:44] but works will show forth our fate
[31:46] already placed in him
[31:48] good works won't save you but even if a
[31:51] man
[31:52] is not saved he ought to do good works
[31:55] and do the best he can what is horrible
[31:58] in the sight of god for men
[32:00] to do evil works and then say that they
[32:01] are doing the will of god
[32:03] that is what the bishops and popes and
[32:06] hierarchy of rome were doing
[32:08] they were killing maiman doing all
[32:11] manner of evil in the name of the lord
[32:13] they lived out lives exactly
[32:16] opposite to what the world teaches in
[32:18] that evil day those true believers
[32:20] shone like a light in a dark place as
[32:23] they continually did good
[32:25] for they returned cursed with blessing
[32:27] that the truth to honor god
[32:28] even though that many died for it in
[32:31] this verse
[32:32] here we go he commanded his children
[32:34] because they were living changed lives
[32:40] i'm not hearing you i want to say amen
[32:42] write with me with the word now they
[32:43] will live in
[32:45] change lives see it change lives
[32:49] say they can change lives that is what
[32:51] they will live and change lives
[32:53] okay watch their works
[32:57] testify to a new spirit within them
[33:00] men sought their good works not
[33:03] hear their good talks but they saw their
[33:06] good works
[33:07] and glorify god are you with me
[33:11] no no we want to be that kind of people
[33:14] hallelujah
[33:15] all right if you are christian you are
[33:18] going to do
[33:19] what is right your words will show
[33:23] what your heart is right and it won't be
[33:26] something you put on
[33:27] for you will do his will when no one but
[33:30] god sees you
[33:31] [Applause]
[33:33] that's why you hear me say you are what
[33:34] you are when you're by yourself
[33:37] because you could pretend to this you
[33:39] could act this way you could show this
[33:41] way but when you by yourself that's you
[33:44] in all your glory hallelujah
[33:48] are you with me i know your love and
[33:50] service faith and patience
[33:52] you will note that the love is placed
[33:54] between works and service
[33:55] and that is the right place for it
[33:57] because without love our works are not
[33:59] accepted before god
[34:03] you're working because you're doing work
[34:06] like i asked myself a question if a
[34:07] husband is saving love and a wife
[34:09] or a wife is serving the husband and
[34:11] she's not saving love
[34:12] how does she feel she feel like a
[34:19] let slave say that again if the wife is
[34:22] serving the husband and he's not serving
[34:23] her love
[34:24] she feel like a slave she finished
[34:25] working in the kitchen working in your
[34:26] home there's no love coming there
[34:32] and if a husband's still in love and the
[34:34] wife has seven respects he feels like a
[34:36] nut
[34:37] [Music]
[34:41] are you with me oh praising of the lord
[34:44] so without love i
[34:45] am nothing whatever i do it would profit
[34:47] me nothing unless it's done in love
[34:49] now you can see right here that these
[34:50] believers weren't in that nicolet and
[34:52] class
[34:53] that it works as a means of salvation to
[34:55] be admired by men
[34:56] but they did their works out of love of
[34:58] god that were shed abroad in their
[35:00] hearts by the holy ghost
[35:02] isn't that right now i want to give a
[35:04] warning right here
[35:05] it is considered the last days that
[35:07] because of abundant iniquity the bible
[35:09] said the love of many with wax
[35:12] coal so a church on fire is a rare thing
[35:16] yes i'm saying people on fire that's a
[35:18] great thing when you see
[35:19] believers on fire that's contrary to
[35:22] what the scripture was saying you are
[35:23] breaking
[35:24] the barrier the song by area because the
[35:26] bible prophesied
[35:27] the love of many will wax cold they will
[35:29] still go to church but they cold
[35:32] still shake hands but they cold god
[35:35] bless you but they
[35:36] call call the love of men because of
[35:38] iniquity
[35:39] oh hallelujah are you ready
[35:43] because in the low reaction or last
[35:45] church age
[35:46] self-love uh-huh
[35:49] and love for material things will make
[35:52] take the place of the true love of god
[35:55] yeah that's self-love make it
[35:56] differently selfies
[35:59] you like yourself i ain't mean to hate
[36:00] it too hard but that is that's a new
[36:02] word selfies
[36:03] selfie goodbye talk about self love love
[36:05] materiality will take the place of the
[36:07] true love of god
[36:08] we need here we go to guard against the
[36:11] power of
[36:12] sin in these last days you can't just
[36:15] walk unguarded you have to understand
[36:18] it's a war fear
[36:20] oh glory to god you shout you jump you
[36:22] feel inspired inside of here
[36:24] and the devil just balling god because
[36:26] you shouted you've got to be kidding
[36:28] me that there is plotting to take away
[36:30] your shout out
[36:32] why are you shouting here the devil is
[36:35] plotting to take away your joy
[36:37] to wipe the smile from off your face to
[36:40] give you a throng
[36:42] but we gonna keep on smiling
[36:50] like the people don't want to say amen
[36:51] on that one you've been thinking about
[36:53] that devil don't think about that devil
[36:56] think about your joy that's not the
[36:59] devil joy
[37:00] that is your joy that is your peace
[37:04] that is your strength
[37:08] [Applause]
[37:15] we need to god against the power of sin
[37:16] in the last days so many are getting so
[37:18] hard
[37:18] so many are getting so hard because they
[37:20] haven't realized the effect of this
[37:22] yes last day spirit
[37:25] right in the south of my experience
[37:27] anointed now and free to come out
[37:29] why they wasn't in the closet really
[37:30] young they couldn't know it wrong
[37:32] no no but they're coming out now why
[37:34] it's a last day spirit
[37:35] why because jesus said as the one days
[37:37] of the son of man
[37:38] socially one day the son of a so
[37:40] she would have been the last days
[37:42] so we are coming right back to our
[37:43] spirit by coming back upon people
[37:46] that was there back then
[37:50] so the last spirit is coming back
[37:53] but there was abraham the elected
[37:56] that was elohim dynamics build
[38:00] i will return unto d according to the
[38:03] time of life
[38:05] and there was a change of body steroid
[38:08] was
[38:09] changed and in this last day there's
[38:11] gonna be a change of body
[38:13] there's gonna be a rapture i'm not
[38:16] hearing you
[38:18] i'm not hearing you so they are getting
[38:21] in their spirit
[38:23] and we have to get in our spirit in the
[38:26] spirit of the coming of the lord
[38:28] oh give the lord some praises people
[38:30] [Applause]
[38:42] russia was a bunch of barbarians but now
[38:44] there's so much advance
[38:46] because they recognize their position
[38:48] and look how anointed the prisoner in
[38:50] russia is

[38:58] understand that the judgment is about to
[39:00] be released

[39:03] the wars
[39:04] stop every disaster stop this and stop
[39:07] that
[39:07] until the angel from the east
[39:12] having the seal of the living god to put
[39:15] a mark
[39:16] upon those that sigh and cry that means
[39:19] somebody will be hungering
[39:22] thirsting groaning travailing

[58:36] david cut collide head off and when
[58:39] israel saw the head rolling down
[58:41] they said you really did they say he

[59:18] hallelujah hallelujah
[59:22] oh glory glory glory hallelujah
[59:26] you may be seated oh man
[59:30] brother brianna i know your service
[59:32] jesus said
[59:33] he that is greatest of all is seven to
[59:35] all a wise man commented on that saying
[59:38] here's what he said only history will
[59:41] prove the truth
[59:42] of that victim that man was right
[59:45] all the truly great men of history have
[59:48] been servants
[59:50] they who demanded to be served they who
[59:53] oppressed who oppressed
[59:54] they who always sought to be at the head
[59:57] have gone down in shame
[1:00:02] even the very rich are condemned by god
[1:00:05] when they have not used their
[1:00:06] wealth right look in the history
[1:00:09] and you would find that truly great with
[1:00:12] those who serve others
[1:00:14] history can never acclaim those for whom
[1:00:17] much was done
[1:00:18] but it will forever praise those who did
[1:00:20] much for others
[1:00:22] and that's why brahman said perfect
[1:00:24] eternal life is when you could live for
[1:00:26] others
[1:00:28] now let us apply that to ourselves even
[1:00:30] the son of man came not to be ministered
[1:00:32] unto
[1:00:32] but to minister so we had to follow that
[1:00:35] example
[1:00:35] see him as he bows himself over the feet
[1:00:37] of the apostles and washes the attire to
[1:00:40] defeat
[1:00:40] he said you know know what i'm doing you
[1:00:43] don't know
[1:00:43] know what i'm doing but you shall know
[1:00:45] hereafter but what you see me doing
[1:00:48] you ought to also do he became a servant
[1:00:52] in order that god could elevate him to
[1:00:53] the highest heights and one day in the
[1:00:56] judgment of the saints
[1:00:57] we are going to hear him say well done
[1:00:58] good and faithful servant and the darwin
[1:01:00] is the joy of the lord
[1:01:01] it is hard to be always a servant but
[1:01:04] those who spend
[1:01:05] and are spent for others will one day be
[1:01:08] seated with him in his throne
[1:01:09] it will be witted all then let us labor
[1:01:12] for the master
[1:01:13] from the dawn to said in son let us talk
[1:01:15] of all this wondrous love and care
[1:01:17] and when all our life is over and our
[1:01:19] work on it is done
[1:01:20] and the rule is called up yonder i'll be
[1:01:22] there i know your faith
[1:01:25] now he does not say here as he did to
[1:01:27] the church in programmers you hold my
[1:01:28] feet
[1:01:29] he's not talking about his fate now he
[1:01:31] is commanding him for dear
[1:01:32] faithfulness and as he does you also
[1:01:36] mention
[1:01:36] patience now faithfulness and patience
[1:01:39] go together
[1:01:40] in fact patience is the outcome of
[1:01:43] faithfulness
[1:01:44] for in james one three the trend of your
[1:01:46] faith look at patience
[1:01:48] there is absolutely no other way
[1:01:51] to gain patience it has to come
[1:01:54] by the trial of your fate romans
[1:01:58] 5 3 tribulation work at patience
[1:02:01] how highly god regards this outworking
[1:02:04] of our patients
[1:02:05] is seen in james 1 4 but let patients
[1:02:08] have a perfect
[1:02:09] that you may be perfect an entire lack
[1:02:12] in nothing
[1:02:14] amen i read that
[1:02:18] from memory
[1:02:21] when i took on my glasses consistency
[1:02:29] god's will for us here we go god's will
[1:02:32] for us
[1:02:33] is perfection how many believe that
[1:02:39] and that perfection is patience
[1:02:43] waiting on god and waiting for god
[1:02:48] this is the process of corrupted
[1:02:51] development
[1:02:53] that is where i get that from waiting on
[1:02:56] god
[1:02:57] and waiting for god this is the process
[1:03:01] of character development so he gave noah
[1:03:04] 120 years
[1:03:06] he gave abraham 25 years he gave israel
[1:03:09] 400 years
[1:03:10] he gave the inside of a room 10 days you
[1:03:12] have a way of giving time on things
[1:03:14] to test fate and develop character there
[1:03:17] is no other way for it to be done
[1:03:19] that's why trials must come because
[1:03:22] character is not a gift
[1:03:24] character is a victory the tests have to
[1:03:26] be given
[1:03:27] for you to overcome could i hear a shout
[1:03:29] on that
[1:03:30] because this is what the bride is for
[1:03:34] to be flesh of his flesh bone of his
[1:03:37] bone word of his word
[1:03:38] characterized by him other than that
[1:03:41] you are the same all you pawn on your
[1:03:43] dress upon you tight same old you
[1:03:46] same you put some paint on you know
[1:03:48] change your hair style and so on cmu
[1:03:50] but when character come it's the same
[1:03:52] outside
[1:03:53] you're about to change your tie but you
[1:03:54] on the inside change that's what the
[1:03:56] problem was
[1:03:57] peter didn't know his emotions would
[1:04:00] overtake him
[1:04:03] lord i died for you
[1:04:07] that sounds very annoying inspiring
[1:04:09] every disciple else
[1:04:11] everybody else impressed with that whoa
[1:04:13] here peter boy
[1:04:14] courageous man jesus said you'll name me
[1:04:17] three times
[1:04:20] no that's not really a good
[1:04:21] encouragement yeah man for such a bold
[1:04:23] step in the faith
[1:04:28] 19 crucifixion somebody said
[1:04:31] you're one of them i saw you in service

[1:04:45] i look at this i pledge
[1:04:46] [Music]
[1:04:48] do you think i'm looking like that well
[1:04:50] they still want to
[1:04:51] identify him he's had a curse
[1:04:59] peter webb bitterly oh peter was broken
[1:05:01] peter
[1:05:02] that that but you see jesus told him
[1:05:04] other things too he said after you were
[1:05:06] converted strengthen the brethren
[1:05:09] the devil want to sit for like wheat but
[1:05:11] i pray for you already
[1:05:13] you're covered man you're a covered man
[1:05:15] you are covered

[1:05:22] you should shorten that you already
[1:05:24] covered man

[1:05:37] exhortation until the night prime
[1:05:39] meeting tell them keep that money
[1:05:40] back again about god's dna
[1:05:43] got gene inside of you god put that dna
[1:05:46] to come back
[1:05:47] that didn't have a return ticket on it
[1:05:49] they ever don't know that
[1:05:51] god only loses here for season and time
[1:05:54] but have a return ticket on it

[1:05:57] had given me will come

[1:12:32] not one year character development 38
[1:12:35] years the amount of persistence
[1:12:37] the man of belly the man of perseverance
[1:12:40] nobody can see that he just come in
[1:12:42] they're seeing the same clothes and the
[1:12:44] same shoes or whatever it is but he have
[1:12:46] something in him
[1:12:47] that god recognizes and when jesus come
[1:12:50] jesus passed this one jesus passed that
[1:12:53] one
[1:12:54] because it didn't have the character
[1:12:55] like what that man had
[1:12:57] he didn't have a big problem he had like
[1:12:59] a prostrate problem
[1:13:00] but jesus bypassed higher conditions to
[1:13:03] go to that one
[1:13:04] man and say will you be made whole will
[1:13:07] you be made
[1:13:08] whole and the man said i have no man to
[1:13:11] put me here

[1:14:31] wrong decision never recover
[1:14:33] but thank god for his grace and mercy
[1:14:36] give us an opportunity to repent
[1:14:38] give us opportunity to make things right
[1:14:40] and we know according to romans 8 20 all
[1:14:41] things work together for good

[1:15:26] purpose for samson
[1:15:27] samson had the dna in him he had god's
[1:15:30] gene in him
[1:15:31] oh hallelujah he was predestinated he
[1:15:33] was elected
[1:15:34] he wasn't permanently back sitting some
[1:15:36] people have you like if you're
[1:15:37] backsliding you're permanently so
[1:15:39] you're sick you're permanently so forget
[1:15:41] that this whole world is temporary
[1:15:43] so sickness is temporary accident is
[1:15:45] temporary
[1:15:46] bad feeling temporary bad marriage
[1:15:49] temporary too
[1:15:50] bad relationship temporary some rocking
[1:15:53] children temporary too
[1:15:55] let the fire fall on them children you
[1:15:57] will see them get cured
[1:15:58] [Applause]
[1:16:03] all those bad behaved once let
[1:16:06] god presence coming upon him all the
[1:16:09] foolish ever smoke out
[1:16:11] god take the dynamite and just blow it
[1:16:15] out
[1:16:16] hallelujah we have a dynamite our god is
[1:16:18] a consuming fire
[1:16:20] he has used lights you know not
[1:16:22] flashlight and torchlight in a real
[1:16:24] light
[1:16:24] firelight fire has burned pulling the
[1:16:27] snakes out of your heart
[1:16:29] pulling the snakes out of your spirit
[1:16:31] burn the stakes out of your soul
[1:16:35] [Applause]
[1:16:40] what are you saying right over just no
[1:16:41] demons crying out
[1:16:45] [Music]
[1:16:45] [Applause]
[1:16:47] i know you don't know what i'm talking
[1:16:48] about when jesus started walking the
[1:16:50] earth
[1:16:51] waiting happened they see myself cry out
[1:16:54] when paul said the walk demons crying
[1:16:56] out one time that demon
[1:16:58] one one point wanna do like what they're
[1:16:59] doing this demon said paul i know yeah
[1:17:01] peter i know but who are you i don't
[1:17:04] know you
[1:17:05] i recognize your authority in those sons
[1:17:07] there is demons talking now
[1:17:09] i understand the power and the authority
[1:17:11] because they are ambassadors of the
[1:17:12] throne
[1:17:13] and ambassadors and representatives of
[1:17:15] the kingdom
[1:17:17] like hierarchy that means kingdom people
[1:17:20] god sent an ambassador
[1:17:21] isn't that right when the government and
[1:17:23] trainers an ambassador to london
[1:17:24] ambassador to
[1:17:25] america or wherever they represent the
[1:17:27] country they represent the government
[1:17:29] they represent the authority
[1:17:31] of when god sent his men out the
[1:17:34] ambassador of the throne
[1:17:36] as my father sent me so send are you
[1:17:40] as my father
[1:17:42] [Applause]
[1:17:48] glory to god so therefore satan is about
[1:17:52] to
[1:17:52] experience something that he never
[1:17:54] experienced before
[1:17:56] the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:17:59] when we go in coming back to take back
[1:18:01] what we have
[1:18:02] listen take it back you know adam lost
[1:18:05] yet
[1:18:06] it slipped out the adam hand the book
[1:18:08] the authority
[1:18:09] eternal life inheritance simple adam han
[1:18:12] and parabanam came to bring it back
[1:18:15] mighty angel came down
[1:18:17] with the book with the bread of life
[1:18:20] but the shout is not right to bring
[1:18:23] forth the pride
[1:18:25] here we are feeling on the unsealing
[1:18:27] body word
[1:18:29] of the solomon here we are feeling on
[1:18:31] the bread of life
[1:18:33] [Applause]
[1:18:36] glory to god hallelujah seven thunders
[1:18:40] are their voices
[1:18:41] what fought to gather the right together
[1:18:43] to give the right feet they shouldn't
[1:18:44] help repair
[1:18:45] the bride not the church the church
[1:18:48] could play a church
[1:18:49] but you're coming here with the bride
[1:18:52] needs
[1:18:55] praise god you have to understand how
[1:18:58] the people feel in times past
[1:19:00] our god looking forward for this brand
[1:19:02] that'll make him proud
[1:19:04] and says a woman reflects the man his
[1:19:07] ambition
[1:19:08] his ideal and so on the woman a man
[1:19:10] choose
[1:19:11] isn't that right so the bride that
[1:19:13] christ chooses is to reflect him
[1:19:17] [Music]
[1:19:17] [Applause]
[1:19:20] if the bride used our own thing that's
[1:19:22] problems
[1:19:23] she is on her own all right
[1:19:26] so god's nature is to warn our man
[1:19:28] before judging them isn't that right
[1:19:30] you always give warning we have a
[1:19:32] responsibility we are responsible
[1:19:34] and god has put us here on the earth
[1:19:35] okay
[1:19:37] watch for a reason another reason that
[1:19:39] he's put us here for
[1:19:41] we are responsible to him for that
[1:19:43] reason
[1:19:44] you should go to him and find out what
[1:19:46] he wants you to do
[1:19:48] and if you if you went to work for a man
[1:19:49] give you a job on a ranch or something
[1:19:51] you went down to the band sit down there
[1:19:53] well you must go and ask him what he
[1:19:55] wants you to do
[1:19:56] and then if you're working for a man
[1:19:58] find out what your duty is
[1:20:00] lord what would you have me to do why am
[1:20:02] i here
[1:20:03] if it should be a housewife this washer
[1:20:04] whatever gods want you to do then you do
[1:20:07] the very best you know how to do it
[1:20:09] excuse me
[1:20:10] no matter how little it is you must do
[1:20:13] it
[1:20:14] now listen to this he does not always
[1:20:16] strike when he wants
[1:20:18] i want you to watch this quotation god
[1:20:21] gives a warning
[1:20:22] but he doesn't always strike the same
[1:20:24] time he wants did you notice that
[1:20:26] and then he doesn't strike he sends a
[1:20:28] warning he said now watch
[1:20:30] but that profit if he's vindicated it's
[1:20:32] got to come to pass
[1:20:34] there's only one thing can stop it is a
[1:20:36] quick repentance like abraham got all
[1:20:38] abraham your siege as a genuine in a
[1:20:40] strange land
[1:20:41] and because of iniquity of the amorites
[1:20:43] there we go is not yet full
[1:20:44] so god knew that cup was going to be
[1:20:47] full
[1:20:48] he was speaking with this prophet he
[1:20:50] said you see that cup of the ammo is
[1:20:51] down there
[1:20:52] the iniquity is not yet filled up so god
[1:20:55] will just judge because things say now
[1:20:57] no there's a cup of wickedness
[1:21:00] a cup of evil that god looking to get
[1:21:03] filled up
[1:21:04] and they're filling it up before ye are
[1:21:06] yehen yield
[1:21:07] and when that fall then god will strike
[1:21:10] the iniquity is not yet full
[1:21:12] so god himself have a diamond
[1:21:15] [Applause]
[1:21:18] hallelujah a lot of people get away but
[1:21:21] whatever timing
[1:21:23] when he does his thing isn't that right
[1:21:26] so what's something now talking about
[1:21:28] david trying to do god's service
[1:21:30] outside his being his will and david now
[1:21:32] got a revelation
[1:21:34] he claimed to bring back the
[1:21:37] house of god the ark isn't that right
[1:21:39] but but abandoned said he revealed his
[1:21:41] word only in its season
[1:21:43] martin luther read the same bible we did
[1:21:45] where's he read the bible we did
[1:21:46] penetrate the same bible
[1:21:48] jesus read the same bible but watch but
[1:21:50] they fail
[1:21:51] to see the hour so only when the time
[1:21:54] comes
[1:21:55] the opening of the word for the season
[1:21:57] and time
[1:21:58] god breaks what needs to break amen
[1:22:00] isn't that right
[1:22:02] so watch god reveals his word in the
[1:22:04] season and to whom he choose to reveal
[1:22:06] it to
[1:22:07] god chooses who he reveals it to he
[1:22:09] reveals them as he will
[1:22:11] as his chosen people his chosen people
[1:22:13] so who it is
[1:22:14] will dare correct him and said now lord
[1:22:16] you made a mistake by putting this man
[1:22:18] in the ministry
[1:22:20] who is there to correct god and say god
[1:22:22] to make a mistake by presenting you over
[1:22:23] in the ministry
[1:22:25] i'll put my name in saturday this man
[1:22:29] doesn't believe like we believe who is
[1:22:31] going to tell god he is wrong in it
[1:22:33] it would be take somebody a little more
[1:22:36] delinquent than i am
[1:22:38] to tell him that he knows what he's
[1:22:42] doing
[1:22:42] he knows who to choose who not to choose
[1:22:46] what to do when to do it no matter how
[1:22:48] much we think that a certain person
[1:22:50] is qualified to do a certain job god
[1:22:52] knows who is qualified
[1:22:54] for the time and the season and so forth
[1:22:57] isn't that right so david got a
[1:23:00] revelation
[1:23:00] look like a man get a revelation a great
[1:23:02] man like god chosen king
[1:23:04] greatest king fresh revelation freshly
[1:23:07] anointed
[1:23:08] and he said but it was wrong that's a
[1:23:11] great thing
[1:23:11] i'll deal with our subject trying to do
[1:23:13] god and service without it being
[1:23:15] god called you to do it so david got a
[1:23:17] revelation
[1:23:18] but he was not a prophet natan was the
[1:23:21] prophet isn't that right but the king
[1:23:22] got the revelation
[1:23:24] and david never consulted nathan the
[1:23:25] prophet he consulted his theologians
[1:23:27] the army his boys his co-workers his
[1:23:30] friends his family
[1:23:31] consulted them is not right so instead
[1:23:34] of asking
[1:23:35] the source that he should have asked he
[1:23:37] consulted his captains
[1:23:38] because he had become a king and he
[1:23:40] followed that line at thinking
[1:23:42] his chief captains and great man now his
[1:23:44] intention was good
[1:23:46] his motive was good his objective was
[1:23:49] good to bring a revival to the city
[1:23:51] but he never consulted the way god told
[1:23:53] him to do it so there's a way that god
[1:23:55] has things to do
[1:23:57] so we can't go fanatical and cranky
[1:23:59] about getting this done
[1:24:00] we have to wait upon the lord
[1:24:03] to catch the way it has to be done
[1:24:07] because god tell joshua we have not been
[1:24:09] here before
[1:24:10] isn't that right and therefore we have
[1:24:12] to walk referently isn't that right
[1:24:14] so barbara said the bride hasn't revived
[1:24:16] us yet there's no revival
[1:24:17] no manifestation of god to stir the
[1:24:19] bride we are looking for it
[1:24:21] it will take those seven thunders to
[1:24:22] wake her up again he promised it
[1:24:24] if the church will forget the creeds
[1:24:26] forget the document and plead the
[1:24:27] promise
[1:24:28] it will become effective to them so now
[1:24:30] going back
[1:24:31] no matter how sincere what good motives
[1:24:33] what good objectives how people want
[1:24:35] those things and see the need for it
[1:24:37] there is a will of god to be carried out
[1:24:40] and no matter how much is needed
[1:24:42] how much everybody agrees is needed how
[1:24:44] much that is the truth
[1:24:45] there is one thing to find out is it the
[1:24:47] will of god
[1:24:48] and listen he consulted his military
[1:24:50] forces and not even considered
[1:24:52] their god-sent messenger of the hour
[1:24:55] so therefore but obama was talking about
[1:24:57] a man he's talking about um
[1:25:00] an intellectual man apparently coming
[1:25:02] from africa and he told them that this
[1:25:03] economical move was a thing of god
[1:25:05] and all that is coming back even the
[1:25:07] catholic church is going to come back to
[1:25:08] his original condition
[1:25:09] or speaking with tongues and a man i
[1:25:12] didn't know
[1:25:12] sometimes you plant the siege you don't
[1:25:14] know what's going to happen but the
[1:25:15] president the full gospel businessman
[1:25:17] as soon as the speaker said no he said i
[1:25:19] am prone not to say things against our
[1:25:20] speaker
[1:25:21] but that ain't the way but the branham
[1:25:22] said it would happen he said it would
[1:25:24] lead to the mark of the beast
[1:25:26] he said but ibrahim don't know what he's
[1:25:27] talking about he said well we believe he
[1:25:30] does
[1:25:31] and chicago said how many here would
[1:25:33] like for me to come up and give my
[1:25:35] version of it
[1:25:35] they begin screaming and shouting see
[1:25:38] you're planting seeds
[1:25:39] you don't know what's going to happen
[1:25:41] just keep laying out the seed
[1:25:42] when an hour come like thomas he was our
[1:25:46] last one to see the lord
[1:25:47] he said he was a little late but when
[1:25:50] they see the things here we go
[1:25:52] that's predicted saying thus here the
[1:25:56] lord happens
[1:25:57] then they say give us of your oil
[1:26:00] so right now everybody's feeling fine
[1:26:03] because things are beginning to break
[1:26:04] yet
[1:26:05] but when things begin to happen then
[1:26:07] they realize they are
[1:26:11] the oil down
[1:26:15] the oil going down they shorten oil
[1:26:18] and they come and say give us of your
[1:26:20] oil no
[1:26:22] here it's not from question and answers
[1:26:23] and a wise virgin who had oil in the
[1:26:25] lambs rapture and faith believe in all
[1:26:26] the signs and wonders
[1:26:28] watch and watch and these five cut out
[1:26:30] the remnant was taken away
[1:26:32] and the rest of them still virgins will
[1:26:33] not be lost but will go to the
[1:26:35] tribulation period
[1:26:36] and jesus said give us they say give us
[1:26:38] your oil we want the holy ghost now
[1:26:42] we recognize we are not the holy ghost
[1:26:43] and we don't even have the holy ghost
[1:26:46] watch now anyone knows that the holy
[1:26:49] ghost james fight for all knows
[1:26:50] it represent the holy ghost the oil and
[1:26:53] that's the reason we are anointed with
[1:26:54] oil
[1:26:55] represent the holy ghost the oldest
[1:26:56] spirit now here this part they want to
[1:26:58] i don't want to get to now these had the
[1:27:00] holy ghost and were sanctified
[1:27:02] these are signified plus the holy ghost
[1:27:05] go buy from those who sell to you and
[1:27:07] they listen to this part now hear the
[1:27:09] path
[1:27:10] and they went to try to pray through
[1:27:13] to receive the holy ghost but the
[1:27:16] gentile dispensation had been finished
[1:27:20] and the persecution arose what does that
[1:27:22] mean
[1:27:23] if you want the holy ghost you begin to
[1:27:24] pray now you're looking to pray for the
[1:27:27] holy ghost no
[1:27:28] don't fill me pour out the holy ghost
[1:27:30] upon my life
[1:27:31] isn't that right so no you without the
[1:27:34] baptismal spirit you know that is the
[1:27:35] oil
[1:27:36] if you didn't have the oil they did not
[1:27:37] go in oh hallelujah
[1:27:40] so when they say give us some of your
[1:27:41] oil the sleeping virgin they realize
[1:27:43] they had all that time to get the oil
[1:27:46] but they didn't do it
[1:27:48] so when the brine was about to come they
[1:27:50] said give us
[1:27:51] of your oil oh blessed be the name of
[1:27:54] the lord
[1:27:55] and brahman said there are five must in
[1:27:57] doing god's service correctly
[1:27:59] david was doing got a service he was
[1:28:02] doing everything he knowed
[1:28:03] he was doing what's right but there's
[1:28:04] five must and i want you to remember
[1:28:06] this no matter how sincere man maybe
[1:28:09] there are five months isn't that right
[1:28:12] praise god it must be his time to do it
[1:28:16] isn't that right it must be his time and
[1:28:18] season
[1:28:19] number two it must be according to the
[1:28:21] word that was spoken
[1:28:24] it can't just be anything god must
[1:28:26] prophesy and say this is supposed to be
[1:28:28] that's why jesus told them if you had
[1:28:30] known moses he was going to know me
[1:28:32] because moses spoke about me isn't that
[1:28:34] right it must be according to the word
[1:28:36] that is spoken
[1:28:37] and this third one it must be according
[1:28:39] to the person he choose to do it by
[1:28:42] isn't that right it must like the person
[1:28:44] you choose to give it by
[1:28:45] isn't that right and it must come to his
[1:28:47] prophets and the prophet must be
[1:28:48] vindicated
[1:28:51] so therefore we have a vindicated
[1:28:52] prophet that spoke syndicated word
[1:28:56] therefore it has got to come to pass so
[1:28:58] if we stay with this vindicated spirit
[1:29:00] spoken word
[1:29:01] how could we fail
[1:29:02] [Applause]
[1:29:05] oh hallelujah we're not here to bring
[1:29:08] you some dream
[1:29:09] we're not here to bring you some men's
[1:29:10] idea or our own idea we're here to bring
[1:29:13] your thoughts
[1:29:13] at the lord oh glory to god isn't that
[1:29:16] right
[1:29:17] listen to brother branham he said now
[1:29:19] watch he said when jesus fell
[1:29:23] they choose mathias to take his place
[1:29:26] and the holy spirit waited
[1:29:28] until all this was in order before it
[1:29:32] comes
[1:29:34] are you here with me they had to choose
[1:29:36] one to take the bishopric of judas
[1:29:38] that fell by transgression to fulfill
[1:29:41] scripture
[1:29:42] so matthias had was to be in position
[1:29:44] even before the holy ghost fell
[1:29:47] oh glory to god here we go are you ready
[1:29:50] and i believe that all these things has
[1:29:53] a time of lingering
[1:29:58] which is the time of waiting we are
[1:30:00] talking about
[1:30:01] did i wait upon the lord god always you
[1:30:04] have a time of lingering time of waiting
[1:30:07] it's waiting for the time for the
[1:30:09] scripture to be fulfilled
[1:30:11] till everything gets right everything in
[1:30:13] order
[1:30:14] wait him amen
[1:30:17] [Music]
[1:30:19] oh so don't get over excited did it wait
[1:30:22] upon the lord
[1:30:23] feeding on the word of god while you're
[1:30:25] waiting praying while you're waiting
[1:30:28] preaching while you're waiting pressing
[1:30:30] while you're waiting
[1:30:31] while you're awake and testifying while
[1:30:33] you're waiting you're worshiping
[1:30:34] while you're waiting you're shouting but
[1:30:36] you're waiting upon the lord
[1:30:38] while you're waiting you're doing all
[1:30:39] that you can do because you're waiting
[1:30:41] on the lord
[1:30:42] [Applause]
[1:30:45] [Music]
[1:30:46] many times we get impatient like a child
[1:30:50] with great anticipation jump way ahead
[1:30:53] and that hinders the work until the
[1:30:55] world get caught up
[1:30:56] we must move reverently have a purpose
[1:30:59] in our heart
[1:31:00] in the god if he desires to do something
[1:31:02] such but wait
[1:31:04] till he makes the opening and he talk
[1:31:06] about david
[1:31:07] wait till you hear the wrestling
[1:31:08] mulberry tree you must wait to see the
[1:31:10] hand of god
[1:31:11] going before you oh praise god adam
[1:31:14] bride could not wait
[1:31:15] got told adam and eve multiplying
[1:31:17] replenish the earth it was an uncommon
[1:31:19] promise
[1:31:19] she was not his wife yet because she had
[1:31:22] not lived with her
[1:31:23] the bride of christ is not his wife yet
[1:31:25] the wedding supper
[1:31:26] is to take place woman engaged a fine
[1:31:29] young clean man they come together
[1:31:30] and what chief he found she's pregnant
[1:31:32] by somebody else
[1:31:34] then her own citizens betrothed that's
[1:31:35] what christ found
[1:31:37] couldn't wait and that's what the matter
[1:31:39] with the people today
[1:31:40] they can't wait for the real holy spirit
[1:31:44] here we go
[1:31:45] to take the church in position
[1:31:48] they can't wait for the real come on now
[1:31:52] i will i promise you the holy ghost
[1:31:53] isn't that right so the real holy ghost
[1:31:56] is promised
[1:31:56] and we're waiting for the real holy
[1:31:58] ghost that produces real power
[1:32:01] real forgiveness real brotherly kindness
[1:32:04] not temporary kindness
[1:32:08] the honey disappear
[1:32:25] gave them for this power judas was there
[1:32:26] everybody at power and they come back to
[1:32:28] you said lord in the devil subject to us
[1:32:30] yet you don't rejoice because of that
[1:32:32] i know you're feeling powerful don't
[1:32:34] have no character
[1:32:37] they're just empowered because of a word
[1:32:40] jesus put anointing upon them
[1:32:42] he said we tried to create a name in
[1:32:43] heaven rejoice because of that don't we
[1:32:45] shall become devil power because
[1:32:49] that's him power upon them when peter
[1:32:50] time computer run you know yes i'm
[1:32:52] saying then
[1:32:55] peter even caught up man
[1:33:01] physical sword you feeling fighters
[1:33:06] jesus
[1:33:08] jesus had to pick up the money and put
[1:33:10] it back on
[1:33:13] you can imagine that romans saw your
[1:33:15] losses head by the sword and jesus pick
[1:33:16] it up
[1:33:17] and just like stick it back yeah man
[1:33:22] is the man that made the air you just
[1:33:23] stick it back
[1:33:25] who use this sword fight by the sword
[1:33:27] die by the saw just peter don't don't
[1:33:29] even put that saw thing don't bring that
[1:33:30] short thing inside here
[1:33:31] your natural thing can work inside it
[1:33:33] take more than that
[1:33:35] because your emotions say i'll die for
[1:33:36] you
[1:33:38] but i just woke up that just woke up the
[1:33:40] intellect they're not connecting with
[1:33:41] the door that's just the intellectual
[1:33:43] thing at work there isn't that right
[1:33:45] but when peter got the holy ghost peter
[1:33:47] was ready
[1:33:48] he was ready to die for christ because
[1:33:50] paul was resident
[1:33:52] it wasn't temporary power it was
[1:33:55] permanent power
[1:33:56] it was so much a power you could say
[1:33:58] silver and gold i don't have
[1:34:00] what god gave me i could give and i
[1:34:03] release to you
[1:34:05] what i have rise up and walk
[1:34:09] oh
[1:34:13] oh glory are you with me
[1:34:16] so god wants to give you something
[1:34:18] authorize you with something
[1:34:20] isn't that right so they can't wait
[1:34:23] until the real holy spirit
[1:34:24] take the church in position they got to
[1:34:26] manufacture something isn't that right
[1:34:29] praise the name of the lord instead of
[1:34:31] waiting for the real word of god
[1:34:33] to be manifest to the bride that's the
[1:34:35] kind that makes the
[1:34:36] world of a true bride bringing forth
[1:34:39] children
[1:34:40] instead of adam coming to her for a
[1:34:43] bride
[1:34:43] when the time appointed would be just
[1:34:45] like christ would come to the group
[1:34:47] christ would have come to his church he
[1:34:50] promised to do it
[1:34:51] god promised to multiply but he had was
[1:34:53] to wait
[1:34:54] until god's time but they want something
[1:34:57] big they want something
[1:34:58] amen educated and so intellectual he
[1:35:01] said now
[1:35:02] the seed that she was holding would have
[1:35:04] finally become a mother
[1:35:05] by the will of god through the spoken
[1:35:06] word spoken with eve isn't that right
[1:35:09] but she couldn't wait isn't that right
[1:35:11] now as soon as she accepted the wisdom
[1:35:13] with the word
[1:35:17] you see and wisdom was contrary to the
[1:35:20] word
[1:35:22] if wisdom is with the word and proves to
[1:35:24] be with the word and the word produces
[1:35:25] itself by the same thing then it is the
[1:35:27] word
[1:35:28] but if wisdom is against the word and
[1:35:30] not with the word
[1:35:31] but trying to find something to add to
[1:35:32] it or take from it it's of the devil
[1:35:35] and the holy ghost sees of the bible
[1:35:36] here we go cannot
[1:35:38] grow in the atmosphere of wisdom
[1:35:42] so that is why the intellectual gospel
[1:35:44] can't cut it in this hour
[1:35:48] the only way it can go is to separate
[1:35:50] itself from all reasons
[1:35:52] and believe the word isn't that right so
[1:35:55] he gave his army his word
[1:35:56] we are not 45 behind the nomination we
[1:35:58] don't 45 behind groups
[1:35:59] we are fortified by the word of god
[1:36:03] so god gave this time of lingering since
[1:36:06] brother branham left
[1:36:07] a time of lingering waiting for the
[1:36:09] amorites to be cops to be full
[1:36:11] waiting for seeds to come in how i thank
[1:36:13] god for this season i have loved ones
[1:36:15] out there
[1:36:15] i show you of loved ones out there but
[1:36:17] their seasons about to come
[1:36:19] because the spirit is about to be
[1:36:20] released it's a time of judgment but the
[1:36:23] bible
[1:36:23] in revelation 22 17 said the spirit and
[1:36:25] the bride say come
[1:36:27] how could the bride have a voice without
[1:36:29] the spirit the spirit have to come upon
[1:36:31] the brine
[1:36:32] to give the bride a voice that the bride
[1:36:34] of the authorities to come whosoever
[1:36:36] will
[1:36:37] the bride will become the fountain of
[1:36:40] living water
[1:36:41] oh hallelujah she herself among zion
[1:36:45] she will be the fountain of living water
[1:36:48] whosoever will come
[1:36:49] and drink of the water of life freely
[1:36:51] because jesus said
[1:36:53] he that believeth on me as the scripture
[1:36:55] had said
[1:36:56] out of his belly shall flow rivers of
[1:36:59] living water
[1:37:00] therefore deprived will be like that
[1:37:02] attention well
[1:37:03] bringing up function of spirit because
[1:37:05] the seven perfect spirits
[1:37:06] that came out to elohim will be resident
[1:37:09] in the bride
[1:37:10] even the pillar of fire and there is my
[1:37:13] spirit
[1:37:13] flowing freely oh hallelujah it's gonna
[1:37:17] flow brother it's gonna floor
[1:37:21] oh my god
[1:37:24] my god my god my god
[1:37:28] my god there's gonna be a fight for
[1:37:31] ministry
[1:37:32] with the full seizure in the body
[1:37:36] releasing the spirit why
[1:37:39] peter spit these words oh
[1:37:43] hallelujah glory to god amen
[1:37:47] so god put us under waiting
[1:37:51] when he said wait page three or four
[1:37:54] until them seven thunders utter the
[1:37:56] voices of that group
[1:37:57] we have to wait and we're gonna slice
[1:38:00] and cut
[1:38:01] but we're going to wait and take wait
[1:38:03] upon the lord
[1:38:04] showing you their strength there's going
[1:38:05] to be a people are going to wait upon
[1:38:07] god
[1:38:07] and they're going to hear from god and
[1:38:09] the devil will move them
[1:38:10] they're going to be anointed with power
[1:38:12] they'll be anointed with the spoken word
[1:38:14] they'll be anointed and they want to
[1:38:16] speak the word they're going to flash
[1:38:17] just like that
[1:38:19] oh glory to god hallelujah oh
[1:38:23] hallelujah just a few more hallelujah
[1:38:26] but abandoned preacher message called
[1:38:28] the masterpiece we know it
[1:38:30] talk about michelangelo talk about the
[1:38:32] vision yet of moses
[1:38:33] isn't that right he had the vision isn't
[1:38:36] that right nobody else had the vision
[1:38:38] and the challenge was to stick with
[1:38:40] division
[1:38:41] for all those years because they're
[1:38:43] bringing that sculpture
[1:38:44] it's not overnighting number one
[1:38:46] wheating is a vision that's in his heart
[1:38:49] and he is hammering away he is chopping
[1:38:51] out
[1:38:52] what is not moses is the vision of moses
[1:38:54] anybody see them chopping they don't
[1:38:56] know what he's busting out
[1:38:57] he's hitting the rack here he's hitting
[1:38:59] his rock here and you who don't
[1:39:00] understand
[1:39:01] what he's hearing out you will find it's
[1:39:03] just a big bunch of noise adjecti
[1:39:05] a man they don't know what he's seeing
[1:39:07] but he is hitting here
[1:39:08] he is hitting here in his mind he is
[1:39:11] here not moses
[1:39:12] and he is sticking out he has taken out
[1:39:14] what is not moses
[1:39:16] what is not acceptable to look like
[1:39:18] moses he is taking it out
[1:39:20] he is chopping it out he is hewn it out
[1:39:22] and god is about to chop
[1:39:24] and hew and cut and take out all what is
[1:39:27] done by him
[1:39:27] because we are going to be just like him
[1:39:30] could somebody say amen
[1:39:32] could somebody say amen are you with me
[1:39:35] oh hallelujah glory can we give another
[1:39:41] [Applause]
[1:39:44] any genuine sculptor is inspired any
[1:39:47] genuine poet no
[1:39:48] what was that genuine not people who
[1:39:51] said poet and they can write
[1:39:53] any genuine singer some people cannot
[1:39:57] sing
[1:39:58] read poems any genuine singer musicians
[1:40:01] whatever it might be
[1:40:02] all real has to come by inspiration
[1:40:06] and michelangelo must have had the
[1:40:08] inspiration of what moses looked like he
[1:40:09] caught in his mind
[1:40:11] and so forth and watch and i think of
[1:40:13] many hard years of labor
[1:40:15] how he had to hold that same vision all
[1:40:16] the time he couldn't change the
[1:40:18] prophetic vision
[1:40:19] he couldn't come a new vision every
[1:40:20] monday morning never knew moses

[1:50:31] white two days before
[1:50:33] you have to bloody it up
[1:50:38] and if you're proud and arrogant and
