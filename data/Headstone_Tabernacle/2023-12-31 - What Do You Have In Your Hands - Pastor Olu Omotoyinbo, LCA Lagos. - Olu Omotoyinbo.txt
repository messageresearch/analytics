you learn us breath to give you alone all the praise all the honor and all the glory for we ask you with Thanksgiving in the lovely name of our reisen resurrected Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you God bless you may be seated um we have got a few announcements here so let's turn and um take care of them first I'm I'm going to be reading from Joshua 5: 1- 12 Ecclesiastes 9: 10 and 11 Ephesians 42 28 and 1 Peter 1 and verse 7 um Joshua 5 and verse 1 through verse 12 read and this wise and it came to pass when all this was this was when Israel had come into the promised land and um the um um the Mana this is the junction the story line around when the Mana ceased and it came to pass when all the Kings of the amorites which were on the side of Jordan Westward and all the kings of the Canaanites which were by the Sea how that the Lord had dried up the Waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel until you were passed over that their heart melted neither was their spirit in them anymore because of the children of Israel now Spirit seen the B they were afraid but notice whether to be able to do you need the spirit you need Spirit whatever your spirit is got to be alive to do anything your spirit is not there you are you're done and especially for us as if God's spirit is not there we're done and that's why Jesus said without me you can do nothing it's not the word alone but the spirit coming upon the world that's what makes the word come alive that's what make the word come come alive yeah all right so there's uh um the spirit um um what was I neither was there speaking them anymore because of the children of Israel um verse two at that time the Lord said unto Joshua make the sh knives and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time they circumcised them when they came out of Egypt but all these young folks who were born in the wilderness had not been circumcised and that's why going into the promised land they will be circumcised that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost without that you you are not going to really Thrive as a Christian you'll survive you're hanging there but you are not going to thrive and God wants us to thrive and have Abundant Living and that's what the baptism of the Holy Ghost represents and the baptism of the Holy Ghost is available for you to get right now as you are standing on your feet amen but of course if you don't recognize your need for the Holy Spirit baptism you're not going to be really hungry but Jesus said they that hunger and thirst that the ones that going to be filled amen all right verse four and verse three and Joshua made him sh knives and circumcised the children of Israel at the heel of the First Kings and this is the cause why Joshua did circumcised all the people that came out of Egypt that were males even all the men of War died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of Egypt now all the people that came out were circumcised but all the people that were born in the world Wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt them they had not circumcised in other words they had not had their own experience with the Lord there had been children born in the home where God was talk about but the Jews were very good at making their religion a part and parcel of their lives and affects everything that they do the natural lives the school life the business life the career everything the Jews were Masters ated and that's why they they're little a little different even if they are these ungodly Jews whatever you want to call them but because they have that culture in them in the nation among the tribe wherever they on the face of the world the Jews have mastered the art of making their religion a part of their lives not a Sunday Sunday thing like many Christians do and then they get during the week they live like unbelievers and then come to church the boys live like the girls in school and the all the filthiness and even on the job adults mothers fathers mothers do all the fighting during the week and all that stuff not Jews they learn to make their religion a parent pass of their Liv so their children grew up saying the religion being their life it was their lifestyle amen verse six for for the children of Israel walked 40 years in the wilderness did all the people people that were Men of War which came out of Egypt was consumed because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord unto whom the Lord swear that he will not show them the land which the Lord swear un to their fathers that he will give us a land that flow with milk and honey and the children whom he raised up in their state them Joshua circumcised for they were uncircumcised because they are not circumcised them by the way and it came to pass when they had done circumcised when they had done circumcised in all the people that they abod in their places in the camp till they were whole they were healed and the Lord said unto Joshua this day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off of you that's what the holy spirit is going to do when he comes in he there to roll away the re all your weaknesses all your C do and even for your do you have any reproach today any reproach at all let the holy spirit let Holy Spirit over over it and watch him roll watch him begin from this hour to roll away your reproach that's his job that's his tough that's his specialty to roll away the reproach amen hallelujah and the Lord said unto Joshua this day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off of you wherefore the name of the place is called gilgal onto this day and gilgal in the Bible was Israel's based Camp they did everything from that spot where the Holy Spirit met them the generation in the promised land amen the son of man amen the new land and the children of Israel verse 10 encamped in gilgal and kept the Passover on the 14th day of the month at Eve in the plains of Jericho and they did eat of the old corn of the land on the tomorrow after they pass over the go in the land at the Passover circumcised them at the Passover once they at the Passover the man is ceased neither have the children of Israel neither have the children of Israel manner anymore but they he eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year amen may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his holy words amen you may be seated let's continue reading um ecclesias 6 9 vers 10 to 11 because I'm I'm I'm talking about work today work and the the kingdom of God's perspective about work now when I'm talking about the kingdom of God because I know generally thank you brothers and and sister um um what's what's the name again Carol Carol uh Ruth Carol Sim yeah all right um speak I know I'm talking about the kingdom of God kingom of God and then because it's very popular I mean and I'm not trying to put anybody down and I don't do it because you can only live as high as your Revelation our Pentecostal brothers are very good to about Kingdom values Kingdom these kingdom kingdom principles and Kingdom these and all that so and when you really dig down to it judging about the message is not Kingdom anything it's just natural Canal selfs satisfying thing they tell you Kingdom wealth for example and many times the preachers see the people sitting down as an ATM machine and they're talking kingdom kingdom values and they are they are you know being filled up but the people are getting more imped and they see one or two or three or four who B didn't of their own you know they have raised up but they preach all this Kingdom to I'm not talking about that I'm not talking about I'm not trying to talk like I'm doing anything better than that I am not talking about so you oh yeah so just go and get a pentec picture talking when was talking Kingdom so they're talking Kingdom this because it's very popular language among Pentecostal Kingdom this and Kingdom this and Kingdom that but I'm not going to say because Pentecostal do is going to scare me away from it no no that's what I'm trying to let you know I am not talking the same might be talking the same but I'm coming from a totally different angle because because I'm not talking about manipulating people I'm talking about the Holy Spirit God himself amen making himself available for his children to use for the benefit of each of their lives amen so I thought I should put that caveat out so you won't you know just go searching for like what they say Kingdom this and Kingdom that and all that stuff but you understand what we're talking about I'm not talking about principles of the of is life is about principles I'm not talking about PR I'm not talk if you're talking principles about other then we'll be talking the same like you know motivational speakers are talking I'm not talking just principles I'm talking about the the spirit of God is a central theme in what I'm talking about the spirit of God not principles you can you can follow the principles all you want and and only 2 3% will be able to get anything done because the rest of us don't have enough willpower to use those principles but I'm talking about the kingdom where 97 98 99% of us can use these principles and that's only enabled by the kingdom of I mean by the spirit of God because it's not you but the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this amen amen Ecclesiastes chapter 9 and verse um verse 10 whatsoever thy hand find to do do it do it with thy might whatever your hand find do whatever your hand find do whatever do with thy might Kingdom for there is no work nor devis nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave wither thou goest don't be scared anybody into the grave but that's what he's saying that at the end of it that's where all life ends up in so where there is work is here there's no work on the other side work is here amen and I'll show you I hope I'll get to it um show you um why walk is an integral part of of you know Humanity so you don't understand from the scripture base if you ask many people today why do you work they don't have they don't have they don't have a clue they just everybody does it they they expected to work but why do you work because if you don't know why you're doing what you're doing you're not going to be the best at it if you apply yourself at all you're not going to do with Excellence I mean many people don't even have a spr get to what Excellence you just want to get by if you don't know why you do work at all you go to your job you'll give your job you'll give your boss 10% you steal his 90 90% And you expect to get paid for it if you don't understand the purpose of work why you work and many people don't and that's what we're talking about and it's such an integral part of the Kingdom integral part of God's covenant with mankind be from before the fall so it's not a human thing is a God thing is a spiritual work is a spiritual thing amen whatsoever thy hand fin to do do with thy might other do it all diligence diligence consistency persistency you know with Focus for there is no work nor divice knowledge nor wisdom in the grave with thou goest I returned and saw Under the Sun that the race is not to the Swift nor the battle to the strong so even while you do the work listen here neither yet bread to the wise nor yet riches to Men of understanding nor yet favor to Men of skill I I'll get back to this not today today so I don't want to I have a tendency to talk and talk and talk I don't I don't want to be be disciplined to uh um get to what I'm saying but here's the point he's making here even with all your work but time and chance happen to them all time and chance is opportunity happens to everybody happens to everybody Ephesians 4:28 let him th thus St still no more so it's not like so because I have God's spirit now automatically I'm not going to steal anymore no the holy spirit is an enablement a power to help you but doesn't take over your will no you hand over your will to him so if you were if you were a thief before this scripture here lets us that living a Christian Life a life a Christlike life is is a deliberate thing you decide yourself is a matter of choice it's an intentional deliberate thing you do in your right mind I will arise I will go to my father I will say to him father I have seen a Del a conscious deliberate effort on your part so let him that store now you have go Spirit steal no more deliberate I am not going to steal because the Temptations that going to come to you to steal Hallelujah the tempation that's going to come to you to do all the things you used to do before that's why you see things that different now something happened to me when I gave my life to things that love before have passed away things that love for more have come to stay and that's why it's so vital that we maintain a constant constant constant everyday relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ let let him that sto steal no more but rather let him labor work working with his hands the thing which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth we'll get to this later the PA your work PA your work includes giving many people say now I don't have enough and they never give that's why you remain the way you are I'm not telling you give me anything I don't need a thing from you nobody needs a thing from anybody but it's part and parcel of the kingdom of God the principles of the Kingdom you've got to give not given because if i s his seed I get back no not that it's just part of the Kingdom principles so in other words you are walking you are conscious of the fact you are walking so you can have to give to him that needs so him that needs doesn't go like that oh so thank God told them now I need the Bible has the word for you to him he that will not work let him not eat do you have some time [Applause] Legos I don't mean today today we have Sunday School uh Sunday school um kids I don't mean I don't mean as Sunday school I mean I don't mean today I'm sorry but I get a feeling sometimes like the many of us get to church and we just get so excited and I never sit back to take it in and and reg goate what we hear and apply to our hearts and lives I get the fear many times let him walk with his hands I told you last week the purpose in in the um promised land was he wanted to bless the work of their hands is such an integral part of of God's contract with mankind the work of your hands what is that in your hand what is that in your hand is not a catchphrase it's an integral part of the Gospel of and I'll show you from the Bible beginning from Genesis from from Adam in Eden I'll show you what the what the fall did to work I'll show you I I I'll try to show you I mean forgive me for saying like I'm going to show you something the holy spirit is one that can show us anything but I'm just trying to I'll show you from the scriptures you know and it let for the Holy Spirit to to take the words and B them into bread to feed you all right 1 Peter verse one chter 1 verse 7 that the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold that perisheth in other words when we are being tried We are Becoming like gold when we are being right we becoming valuable when we're being tested and proven in the wilderness we becoming like gold more precious than goal more valuable than go so when you understand when you talk about value in work value in the marketplace that's what he's talking about that's how it comes in the kingdom of God it doesn't come by going to school even though going to school is a major part of how you get this value but it comes from the school of life where you go through your trials and testings when you go to school you go through tests right that's a school regular school in God's school also you go through tests and trials so it's a different kind of test that test is testing your school test is testing your head this test from God is testing your heart your character so it's the same thing same thing and when they think you have enough you know enough they move from primary one to primary two becomes you become too valuable for PR one you go to PR two so test to test and prove what stuff you are made of what value you have whether you're becoming like gold or you're like silver um Rubble or some other precious tone so the trial of your faith much more being much more precious than that of gold that perisheth though it be tra with fire might be found onto praise and honor and Glory at the appearance of Jesus Christ and I I have a con scripture that I'll just read quickly speaking along the same thing job 23 and verse 10 but he knoweth the way that I take when he have tried me I myself shall come forth as gold I am gold when you are tried when you go through the Wilderness you are coming as gold not not you will be you will be like gold I shall come forth as gold gold is value go is value valuable hallah valuable Rich material that's what that's what God is trying to get you through that's what I told last week don't waste the Crisis crisis where you can become gold can become golden golden character gold you are wasting with mumbling grumbling not today but I'll show you but if you have a time go read numbers 1112 1314 and see how Israel provoke God to where God said I had enough and said 40 years you're going to spend in this Wilderness here a Jo that taking them just 11 days 40 years because of the mumbling because the unbelief he knowth the way that I take when he tried me I shall come forth as gold May the Lord has his Blessing the reading of his holy words amen so today I'm um trying to shing a bit longer than I I thought it would originally but I felt the Lord spoke my like that it's very major that they get and understand this if they get and understand this here I promise you totally absolutely transform your life to levels you will never imagine and these are not new things but I think maybe now you can hear you can listen you can take it all in and I pray and hope like I I'm able to make it a bit clear for you to see and I'll try not to hold you too long so I will um not make it weome for you so um so still speaking on the same subject like I said in the church meeting on politics the government uh the economy and you and today particularly I want to like begin to talk a little bit about work the place of work in the context of the kingdom of God because my in my insistence is that when we live anywhere we live on the face of the Earth here we should not live within those economies we should live in the economy of God because if you live in the economies where you at man's economy is always in a recession I don't think I read it but last week I showed you where when Israel rejected God's economy and God's government type of government was too religious and then Israel um chose to have a king like other nations in other words want to be like want to have the government like other nations have and Samuel felt bad that they are rejecting God said no s don't feel bad it's not you they are rejected it's me they are rejected but let just tell them what they want give it to them but let me show them what they're going to get and then God told Abra I mean um Simon to tell Israel the kind of King they're going to get not just Saul in other words the because like other nations the kind of system of government they're going to get and what that system of government is going to give them and I tell you read 1st Samuel chapter 8 and you will see the discussion there between God and Samuel and the Israelites and then you'll see how God said these systems are going to do what they're going to do to people and you you can fit any system there you can Feit the monarchy there you can Feit the Empire system there you can fix you can Feit federalism there you can Feit socialism there you can Feit uh um communism there you can Feit a vaed democracy there you can even fit in our Nigerian homegrown democracy you can fit it in there is the same thing he tells you what will happen to your sons and your daughters it's just a system that and slaves now there are some slaves who are the top of the pile who are the top of the pile so they look like they're not slaves but the system were all enslaved by the system and that's why the people who are like you know against Taxation and all that stuff they fight bad because they feel the government you know just wants to own you and like task Masters that you have to pay tax to all the time you think that doesn't matter Jesus they came to his disciples and that why doesn't your master pay taxes let me not get into that and Peter like was shaking and told them that yeah and that this this like my master pay taxes you so that they won so f i right Marian is that what it is f FRS will come after Jesus and there'll be a scandal like it will make Headline News man who claims to be the Mah is is is what do you call it he's not paying taxes he owes taxes of 30 years pet said no my my master pays taxes so Jesus called him and said Peter let me ask you and dis other disciples a question to whom do the children of this world Peter taxes do kings pay taxes or is it the slaves subjects that pay taxes and they said no Kings don't pay taxes Prince Charles or is it King King Charles doesn't pay any taxes doesn't pay any taxes and Jesus trying to tell them there I am a king I'm the king of the world I owe no man no taxes but but Jesus that's where that that was his agreeable nature even though Peter says something that he not agree with he's not going to spoil anything he says but so that won't offend them because you have already told them this go into the fish Bank in the bottom of the ocean throw in your fishing rod the first fish that comes out you'll get the tax there for them bring it out and go pay them so we don't offend them but really I owe them no taxes so I'm saying and all these things are together in in the kingdom kingdom principles are waiting there [Applause] Hallelujah anyway so we were speaking last week about I'll try to talk I'll try to talk so you'll be sure to hear me um about Israel's Wilderness Journey that the Wilderness was their training school I like to say the training school of Life the school of life like I'm saying school school is all about testing you and other they have different methods of testing this is but still about testing so they'll be able to determine whether you have the value or the the content within you to move to the next class the next grade the next so that can be know whether determine whether you are worthy of the certificate the badge of honor that you have a bachelor or a Masters or a doctorate or whatever we are the value in you to say you have the degree that the college or the university gives out so the Wilderness was Israel's training school and what was he doing he was to prepare them for the task of entering the promised land and when they enter the land to subdue the promised land and when they subdue the land to possess the promised land so it's not just to enter the land I enter the land and then see Giants there and they miss the point that's when they saw giants they fell no this guy want to kill us here if they took their training the promised land will be a small matter they had to work but will be a small matter but because they didn't take their training they wasted the crisis but that training was to prepare them for the task of entering the promised land having entered them to subdue the land and then to possess the promised land the Wilderness therefore was a very painful experience but was a necessary experi experience for them it was a necessary part of their preparation for the promised land being in that spot where they don't have where they want to wumble and cry was painful was a painful experience but like we read last week God planned it God God designed it God had a purpose in it the Wilderness was a painful experience but necessary part of their preparation for the promised land this preparation was targeted at their hearts at their hearts about the Inner Man the inner person the person they are on the inside to form character in them to form character value gold on the inside of them that's how when he has tried me I will comfort as gold your trials are to a point the purpose God wants to make you gold yes character gold Jesus said buy of me gold tried in the fire that's what he's talking about that's why we're looking for the spirit of God Jesus himself went in the wilderness the spirit drove him into the Wilderness for what for character formation that was God who was God himself alone but to show us how it how it is because the Bible says we know like a I used to do a song when I was growing up when Jesus walked in Galilee he gave all men a chance to see what God in intends for them to be and how they ought to live so he did many things to show us how it should be so he went into the Wilderness just like and God's spirit drove him into the just like God's spirit drove Israel Into the Wilderness and the Bible say what happened in the wilderness what happened Satan came at him to give him the test lot of the eyes lust of the flesh PR of life to test him on the World to test him in the flesh in his spirit in his eyes just test him everywhere like Israel was tested with Hunger isra was tested with Hunger Jesus was tested with Hunger test everything like isia was tested but he did not go their route it took his 10 believe even what God Said and was built up character on the inside of him he did not waste his crisis character on the inside of him and the Bible said St Luke 4:4 Jesus came out of the Wilderness in the power of the spirit because he did not waste the crisis that his tests and trials represented can you say amen amen amen all right so um okay okay um all right so so the night Journey was about really about the hearts go wanted to build character goal value on the inside of them so he was second that their hearts not at anything else but their hearts so the Wilderness and the ties and the testings and all that I did to prove you I humbled you and all that stuff was not about the destination was not about the wealth they were going to get in the promised land no no that's why many of them did not get to that wealth that's why they not get to that abundance in the Promised Land because they miss the purpose if you miss the purpose you miss purpose you are finished you're done so Wilderness was not primarily about the destination it was more about the condition of their hearts it was more about their preparation and the people of value that God wanted them to become so that they'll be ready to take the promised land so the Wilderness was never primarily about the destination you understand that amen not for Israel not for you not for me it's not about the destination what God is interested in in your Wilderness may say I want to be this I want to be that you have you can't jump over the Wilderness the Wilderness is a path and parcel of the journey the Wilderness is a necess painful but a necessary part of the journey and I told you how you know you're in the wilderness I'll tell you how you know you're inness you in that SP where you just you just have enough you can make all the money all the resources just find that it just goes away that's the sign you in the wilderness you're not learning all the lesson go want you learn where did where did the money go to you in the wilderness is the money is spoiling the manner just couldn't go extra because God s you that his fault because they hadn't taken their [Music] lessons it's not about how much money you make no it's not about that God help us God help anyway so the witness was not about the destination it was more about their hearts about the value that God wanted to put in their soul so they come out of winess with power that's the power to create the wealth the power to get wealth the power to create wealth have you ever heard the phrase when you talk wealth people just need money no wealth is the re deeper richer than that have you ever had the phrase wealth of experience have you ever had the phrase wealth of knowledge have you had the phrase wealth of wisdom have you ever had the phrase wealth of understanding that's what creates the wealth that you are talking about the Lord but wealth is richer deeper than the very narrow thing that you you put on [Music] it so the Wilderness therefore is your preparation is the mean to the end that you seek whatever you want to be whatever you are going for the Wilderness is the route you are going to take to get there Israel couldn't jump from slavery and strength the promised land no they had to Traverse the rocky terrain of the Wilderness amen the Wilderness was a route it was the means by which they will be able to achieve the promised land and it's the means by which you and I will be able to achieve the desired end goal what whatever you desire without this Wilderness preparation your attainment your achievement of long-term sustainable success in any area of life is very remote if not outrightly impossible I don't want to say out impossible is very very remote and that's why many of you remain the way you are every small thing happens you Mumble Grumble complain because you the devil is telling you what's going on get but bam came to take us back to the world back to the Bible what did the prophet tell us about this here what the Bible tell us and we keep failing and failing and failing in this school of life that's why we never get promoted to the next level you fail in your school natural school they're not going to promote going to next class I said the the Wilderness the test is not nobody sees a t thank God a test is coming no nobody sees that something wrong with your head you do that but you have a knowledge and understand that why the tests are there we don't enjoy them but is a necessary painful but necessary part of our preparation for the higher Heights God wants us to go to you couldn't how can you compare the promised land to the Wilderness or slaver in Egypt by no stretch of anybody's imagination should we be able to compare them so the promised land is something what dying for something what giving up everything to get there a land that flows to make and Hy and of abundance amen so without the Wilderness you and I are going nowhere the success we are looking for is very remote and I would say almost outrightly impossible because the Wilderness is where God works on you works in your inner man to ship you into the person that can um handle the destination that can handle the success that can handle the weight of the blessing that the kingdom of God represents he said of the increase of his government of his kingdom there shall be no end and the government shall be upon his shoulder your should when you your should it represents you represents strength to carry something that's heavy the weight of the responsibility the weight of success watch in the Bible I'm not talking at you look in the Bible very few people could handle success not even even Solomon not even The Heroes of Faith that we talk about Hallelujah that's why Paul said so that for the abundance of Revelations he will not be overtaken with pride God had to put a a thorn in his flesh to keep him humble huah for his b to keep him humble and teach him to pray every single day because we are not built to be able to handle the blessing and that's why God was warning Israel before the blessing would come run through the Bible people serve God when their pockets are empty once their pockets are are getting filled up you see them become something else in the Bible I told you repeated Israel when they they CED to God God please God delivers them once the judge dies they go back again to their filthiness their their ungodliness because God delivers them the judge comes and the land the land prospers again and prospered in their pockets they lose their heads and go after strength Gods that's why I say many of you don't even have money to finance sin and what you show right away even when your pockets are empty shows what you will do when you have some money that's why God keeps away from you because he will not give you what will destroy you that's why he wants to get your heart first or he will not give you the bless you are looking for that's why many of you are talk on the same spot going around in circles all all action but no movement so we can sum up the Wilderness this way the purpose of the wilderness was and still always is God shaping the character of his people so they'll come forth like gold Comfort like people of Great Value and they'll take that value into the promised land how does that come about by the trials the testings the experiences that he gives them along the way in the wilderness these experiences and trials and tests teach them knowledge knowledge you know the church is not going to kill you knowledge you know God keeps his word knowledge you know God will answer your prayers knowledge to know knowledge these experiences the trials that's what God was wan to teach Israel in is a school school of life God's School come from Heaven seven angels come from Heaven pick me up into the Pyramid of themselves and begin to teach me about God's School God's school begin to teach them knowledge what do you get in school knowledge and the Bible says my people perish for lack of knowledge you don't perish because you have no money in your pocket you don't perish because you are nasty you perish because of lack of knowledge you fail in your classroom because of lack of knowledge my people perish for lack of knowledge and where there's no vision people are destroyed same thing so God's taken them you me through the Wilderness to teach them knowledge and from knowledge they get understanding because knowledge is nothing on its own knowledge when you examine it when you apply it you you get some understanding and then wisdom comes on the application of the understanding that you have gained from the knowledge so in the wilderness God was teaching them wisdom understanding and knowledge wisdom understanding and knowledge and that's why God never got even go will get angry at them but he will give them they Moses is in Egypt is that why you made us to come and die here God say Moses give them the food to let them see like God he'll take care of you God he'll make a way way where there seems to be no way he will take care of you amen when you do sin God will forgive you when you repent that's what the Wilderness represented he was there patiently showing them that he's a kind loving considerate sensitive heavenly father who will take care of his own who is devoted to his children when they are good when they are bad when they are nasty when they are evil is there with them to show that nobody can take good care of you like God will he'll take care of you how many have testimony he will take care of you amen God will make a way where there seems to be no way he walks in ways we cannot see he will make a way for you he will be your guide my guide amen he will do it he will do it are you learning that in your Wilderness are you learning that he makes a way are you learning that he keeps his word are you learning that nothing is going to you are not going to die in the wilderness we are headed for the promised land you are headed for the promised land do you believe that believest thou [Applause] this are you learning your lessons from the school of life from God's school from above are you learning your lessons this knowledge is deeper than the knowledge get from math and physics and chemistry and biology and quantum physics or whatever is knowledge God's knowledge being passed down to you by life's experiences knowledge understanding and wisdom turning into people of value that's ready to take on the promised land oh glory amen May me seated all right so um so the Wilderness we get a clear picture what it's all about now and your Wilderness is your trials your tests your difficulties I know you in the wilderness you just have enough just have enough slavery you never have enough werness just have enough maybe get to work you just know how to manage yourself and your just have enough that's Wilderness that's not God's God's God's end goal is land of abundance even when you make so much more extra it just goes away you know why because the person to manage that is not there yet she just goes away but God's showing you that you are in the wilderness still you haven't gone out of wilderness you in the wilderness maybe they give you a December right they give you a 13th month by the middle of January wonder where the man went went to it's gone hallu because you're in the wilderness all right so um I don't know how to mind this in here P you want to help me this thing is um is showing me up too much I'm trying to I'm trying to join your leaks but it show me that you need to go to school all right so anyway um okay I think I think I finished there all right so the Wilderness we're some the Wilderness so the Wilderness is about learning the Knowledge Learning the understanding Jus said come and learn of me that's how it is that's how it is Jus went in the wilderness and learned understanding wisdom knowledge and it came out full of goal character value power that could become a savior come my redeemer the the wisdom and the understanding the knowledge is what makes you come out of the Wilderness as gold when he has tried me I shall come forth as gold it doesn't just that you come you are learning something the trial is a test test proven testing you testing you like they test you in school testing you and when you understand what it is understand what it is oh I see you are adding value to yourself you're becoming more precious that's why those trials that's why any son any child that comes to God must for be tried if it doesn't try you he's short changing you there's no way you are going to become as Gold without the trials and the testings amen your TR testings different from mine all have them different ways but it's a necessary part of our our journey so it's the learning of the knowledge the learning of the understanding the learning of the wisdom that makes us come for as gold out of the fiery trials coming forth as gold out of the trials means you as valuable as gold as valuable as gold with a character and value of gold amen it is this value this character that Israel was to get in the wilderness under the fiery trials and testings and they were to take into the Promise Land to serve and Conquer and possess the inheritance in the land of promise they were to get to the edge of the promised land people of value people of character people who are like gold the world looked at them and see like M ders wonders in the desert but God looks at them and sees like golden character amen gold amen and this is not religious talk this is real world talk real life talk talk amen so is this character this goal this value that they had become they have become gold themselves they have become value themselves and is this value this character this goal that's the power that they took into the promised land to create the wealth because Moes told them for it's he that giveth the power to create wealth and that get banded all around and feel like that oh yeah C so people are just there praying fasting 40 days so that you know that deal will walk through and that deal will walk through and all that stuff that's why people get into so many strange stuff that's why number of children here play this what you call Lottery Niger bed Niger bed Niger that's why you get trouble because you think that's how you make money that's you are not going to become rich not talk about wealthy playing bed Niger you are not going to look win 1 billion Nara today every day for the next one week on B Niger it will be in the wilderness you just find that it spoils you find that they they collected Mana extra Mana God s you that is spoil because the people who are the character to money the extra Mana was not there you win all this B money you looking for shortcuts the money will spoil is not anybody's going to steal it you yourself will steal it from [Music] yourself you yourself you will steal the money from yourself because you are sold to the Wall's ideas do do Shady stupid thing because you think that's how it goes but that's not Kingdom that's not the kingdom of God the Bible said the kingdom of God is within [Applause] you so all of you two by four lottery push people here I hope you you you make up your mind today you make up your mind today and learn real Kingdom ways to make to to to create wealth not for yourself you create value for other people and you'll have more work I'm not saying you're going to make a billionaire but you have enough to take care of yourself your family and enough to give out you might not be a millionaire because you gave some five Talent some two some one but you have enough can you say Amen you don't have to believe that but I'm telling you from the pages of God's word [Applause] amen all right okay so um okay all right so so the value um the goal that you become that's the value you bring into the promised land the power to create the wealth was it the wealth of knowledge the wealth of understanding the weth of wisdom the power of understanding the power of knowledge the power of wisdom that's the power that's going to create wealth the power of a golden character what the word Call's power God cause foolishness what the work call foolishness God cause power character integrity Grace no wonder the Bible say when he has tried me I shall comfort as gold like we read the trial of your faith been much more precious than gold Jesus came out of the Wilderness in the power of the holy spirit so Israel got into the promised land and we read Joshua chapter 5 now when they entered Jericho in the promised land what was it God began to unveil some more about how the kingdom walks on Earth Here below remember there were in Egypt slaves in the Kingdom of God not under the kingdom of pharaoh they live there but they not live God s you that not live by the kingdom of pharaoh for their daily up because they were slaves they depend on somebody to give them food they task Masters and they never had enough slaves never have enough but when he came down to it when the Kingdom of Egypt was being judged and Egypt was the was the was the chief of the whole world at that time like the US is today when the Judgment came to Egypt they were in Goan in Egypt but not in Egypt in Egypt but protected from the plagues of Egypt and that's why I'm saying you you don't the plagues don't have to touch you no buhari's plague orus plague don't have to touch you we're not unrealistic about those things but it don't have to touch you and that's what I'm trying to show you I'm not talking religious talk I'm talking real world talk if you can receive it and do the work that's needed amen anyway so God in the world have been taken care of them and in the in the uh uh um Promised Land he was going to continue taking care of them but in a different sort of way and I want you to listen really good we again to work work in the wilderness he fed them daily with angel food Mana from heaven now the promised land the Mana EAS and now going forward he was going to feed them on the old corn of the land are you with me because the scriptures let us understand that the promised land was ready for planting and harvesting in other words the land was ready land was fertile ready to be harvested ready to be planted that's that's important to note we'll get to you later the prise are LED for planting and harvesting so that they will plant and the next year they will eat of the O of the land it totally changed Mana ceas immediately what does that mean it means that from from it means henceforth they were going to God was going to take care of them in a different sort of way by the old kind of the land by the planting and harvesting they were going to do in the land not no more miracle P Lo food from Heaven angel cake it means that going forward it was going to bless the work of the hands you read that in deom 28 was because is all about work he's going to bless the work of their hands which was his ultimate goal all along it couldn't bless the work of their hands in Egypt because they were slaves in the wilderness they were just passing through they were in school they didn't have work it was schooling them tutoring them so that they get knowledge wisdom understanding it's after school that you get [Applause] work so he couldn't bless the work of the hands in Egypt because they were slaves in the wilderness they were in school and then after school once they got into the promised land the work of their hands work of their hands oh brother amen so going forward that's the new program say God but where's the supernatural provision no that stopped that stopped how we going to eat the work of your hands no work of your hands no food give me give me some oil I ain't got n for enough for myself new order here but listen this runs really deep by God blessing the work of their hands because they go into this land here make honey and what they saw was Giants why is they make honey I'm sure they've imagined that that when they get there they'll just be walking it just be like you know when your street is water logged they just be waterlock milk and honey so their problem was going to be how they are going to like how they're going to refine how do you call like is it refin how to refine okay refiner right refine the milk and oil so that it be suitable for human consumption so they were going to like just be like ah in my own Street the milk is like up to waste level in my street is even like you know covering us up and they got there they saw like these rocks and mountains and you know in Nigerian lingo Nigerian lingo like this is one chance this is one chance they didn't say but like that they were very disappointed go read numbers 10 11 12 13 14 and see the power of disappointment in the things of God discouragement it's don't go there don't go there don't go there so where's the milk and where's the honey the work of your hands here is the Revelation by the work of their hands is that they're going to access the the milk and the honey and it's going to be not just access going to be a flow of it it's going to be an abundance of it of milk and honey amen amen all brother is somebody hearing me glory to God Amen oh Hallelujah so by God blessing he promise he said he is he promised to bless the work of their hands it's not like that show me the kind of work whatever of course it can't be like dubious work show me the work the work of hands some have this work some have that work the work of your hands it doesn't matter the [Music] work I could say something but I better leave there alone I better leave there alone no customers they won't take it leave so how do we access the milk and the honey he told them before they got to the land read Deuteronomy 8 again he told them like that your rocks I have hidden Stones inside there I mean your rocks have hidden iron inside there I've hidden brass inside there I've heing stuff inside different places when when you understand when you understand wisdom wisdom to know how to go into those rocks and things you'll bring out the iron you'll do stuff with the iron Hallelujah you you'll give people you from the iron and the things that have hidden in the land in the sea in the rocks and the mountains when you do stuff with them you are going to give value to people and though people are going to Glory that's how you are creating wealth creating value for people and that's how wealth comes back to [Applause] you you'll find the Mir the horny is too too much too much Prosperity too much abundance will say those years back too much Prosperity amen may be see that it doesn't come by bet Niger no I go into other but let me leave that alone all the all the machine slot slot machines of Las Vegas and all the gambling and all the stuff I don't see the scripture for it I'll show you but not not today let's let's let's try and get a walk here let's let's get a walk here so by God blessing the work of their hands that was how they were going to access the honey the milk and the Honey in the promised land the land flowing will milk and honey flowing not dripping flowing and it flow what does that mean an abundant amen let's bring it all down to you and I today notice that the the the ultimate goal was always abundance but notice they not have abundance in Egypt now they have abundance in the wilderness is somebody WR in their Bible did somebody read that in their Bible can I hear you do they have abundance in the wilderness they have abundance in Egypt in Egypt they had less than enough but just to keep soul and body together like those years at night they say w to God morning will come and the morning they say what to God night will come it was uncomfortable existence my brother bham I mean Master Storyteller that he was let us see this things so very well uh down through the years so an abundance amen they didn't see it in Egypt they didn't see it in the wilderness and neither will you or me see abundance in the wilderness or in Egypt we're not going to why the provision in the wilderness was only God's Supernatural provision to meet their everyday daily needs while they travel the Wilderness my Lord knows the road to the Wilderness all I have to do is follow my Lord knows the way through the Wilderness all I have to do is to follow listen to me real good don't sit down there tired and listen to me really good of course you don't have to I mean forgive me you don't have to you don't have to but I can tell you that if you if you listen your life will be totally T listen listen taken to levels you will never imagine what's possible right from from the page of the Bible from the gospel of Malachi first message amen amen the Wilderness was not the land of abundance when is only the land for God's Supernatural provision to me their everyday needs while they travel through that school they not have to work for the fruit or the provision of it as good and as kind as that sounded loving caring heav h l father providing for their need supernaturally water from the rock Mana from Heaven providing for their health care Snak beat them just look just look up and then everything is gone supernaturally the supernatural God they were going from Miracle to Miracle to Miracle to Miracle there was only a temporary plan that wasn't God's ultimate goal GL so as good and as kind and as loable as that was I'm sure the one you get the promised land and like just wake up now we are home now so we can really get this this this manner from heaven with some quills too and we can do them into different store we can make them into like what you call now you make them into different things different things for breakfast for lunch for dinner have some for the friends for the family we can even sell some can do stuff that so the man just come and then we just be in wealth milk and honey God doesn't reason the way you reason God's interested in the man on the inside the man on the inside if you are God's child if you are God's child if you are God's child you are God's seed you will never come into wealth if God doesn't have your heart I promise you that you will never even when you have plenty you will just find that it will spoil some need out of the blues will just come from somewhere to take it all away from you because God doesn't have your heart yet that's why it says seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness it's all your benefit not because God needs you or me it's for your benefit can you say Amen no you're not hearing me really well no you're not here Jo are they are are they following me you think they are all right all right all right so the supernatural provision was only a temporary plan it wasn't a long-term plan Supernatural pration miracle miracle was not God's long-term plan for them it was only a temporary shortterm plan providing for them Supernatural in the wilderness in a place where they couldn't provide for themselves even if they wanted to was only God's way of showing that he was and still is a faithful caring father who takes care of his own and God wants you to understand that that he cares for his own amen and nobody can do that better than him he cares for you he carth for you through sunshine or sorrow Shadow he cares for his own he cares for you amen but too many people they don't say it like but they feel like that this God has failed them they F God has failed them I'm not talking any personal to anybody I'm not talking to any because I mean I'm not talking to any anybody I'm talking from the scriptures you know how I talk I'm talking from the scriptures just like Israel that's the Prototype the antitype of the Prototype that's the antitype of the type Israel fa God had failed them so God providing for them Supernatural in the wilderness was only God's way of showing them of building up their trust and faith that no one can take better care of them than God will that God Alone will take care of them and he will take care of you he will take care of you I don't care what he will take care of you because notice what they couldn't do for themselves God stepped in and even right now even when you are in the promised land that which you cannot do for yourself God steps in he will step in for you he will do for you what you cannot do for yourself because it's a faithful God he's a caring God Amen he's the god of the universe and so it matters not what the doctor says it matters not what he will take care of you in a in a split seconds time the cancer will vanish every disease will melt away in a split seconds time by the blast of his nostrils the Red Sea open up and they walk through on dry ground blast of his nostrils his god of the heavens and the universe and the Earth is only body's foot to that's the god that we serve that's the god that we serve he holds Heaven he holds Heaven time and seasons in his hand that's the god that we serve oh and he carth for you through Sunshine through Shadow he cares for you and I oh give him praise people give him praise Hallelujah glorify his name glorify his name glory glory to God he deserves all of our praise [Applause] amen the supernatural provision was to show them that through the tough and the difficult terrain of the Wilderness may be seated in the good times and in bad times and even when they eventually arrived in promised land that God so that they always know that God would always take better care of them than they could take care of themselves and was to let them to understand to to focus their minds on God so they can always look to him as their one true Source amen and to seek ye first the kingdom of God and its righteousness righteous living righteousness so notice his ultimate long-term plan was to bless them with abundance Jesus said I come that they might have life and have it more abundantly that's all God is abundant that's who God is amen amen of the increase of his kingdom there should be no end abundance just keeps on going on and on and on and on and on so God's ultimate plan long-term plan in his kingdom to his children was to bless them with abundance which is more than enough and that and that will only come through the work of their hands the abundance was hidden in the promised land amen and when they got in promised land that Bon will only come through the work of their hands his plan was not to keep providing for their needs by Supernatural means if he had done that they'll only become entitled spoiled immature kids spoiled Rich Kids spoiled Rich Kids the Rich Kids of Abuja Spa kids Rich Kids of Lagos Rich Kids of New York Rich Spa kids if he just kept providing for them supernaturally like that they will never learn anything they'll never be built up themselves on the inside to become people of value themselves even though they have all the thing thrown on their laps but those kids are in the wilderness because what they have it just spoils they just wasted just pails just doesn't last just just pause just pause and that's why you see you know generational well many times doesn't pass them down because those kids were not in the promised land they live there but they were not they not get built up to have the shoulders that will carry the weight of the kingdom in the promised land other Christians unbelievers it matters not and then once they they just they just go right back in the wilderness and all the resources just frer away what is it God doing that it's a principle of God it just pause warms just eat it up nobody still and just warms eat it up amen are you with me hope we are catching your lessons amen so God was not going to spoil his children no if he did throwing things at them like that they would never grow they only become entitled immature little babies just as is the same way God's plan for his church is not for you and I to live from Miracle to Miracle live from Supernatural provision Supernatural prion that's good but that's not his plan no he wants you and I to walk by faith to live by faith and not by sight what are you saying preacher I'm saying that God doesn't want you and I to live such that unless you see a miracle you will not believe I haven't I haven't even halfway here but uh let me let me just see here let me narrate to you brother Bam's experiences came with the ministry unlike any other since the time of the Apostles I mean since time of the Apostles and when was banking on the scene nothing like the FF bws were the Giants they they became like his his his protes his students because they saw the grace of God upon his life I'm and because the angel if you can get the people to believe you nothing will stand before you had the tenden to tell people when they go anywhere tell them like that bring me the hardest cases every every line I had was a miracle line not a healing line a miracle line you've got to see Miracle after Miracle after Miracle after not my watch brother's words himself so there was a day they brought him a girl who had no no eyeballs at all and he had prayed for many like that the eyeballs just came up come up like that I mean some like that so he he got this child he prayed prayed prayed nothing happened he prayed and prayed and prayed nothing happened 30 minutes praying and prayed again 45 minutes one eyeball popped into the eye second one he prayed and prayed not anyway at the end of the day the guy the the baby received eyeballs miracle miracle instant on the spot when he left the place the angel spoke to him and said you cannot keep going on like that come on brother because when you keep going on like that you will weaken the people's Faith their faith will become like until and see a miracle they will not believe me my Covenant with them is blessed he that believeth Hallelujah without sin I don't want them to live from Miracle to miracle and miracle I want them to just come sometimes come through the prayer line come to the healing line lay hands on them and let them go away believing that they'll be healed but the way you are managing them you'll get them to where unless they see a miracle they will not believe and God said I don't want my children to live like that a miracle Supernatural provision and brother Bram said the angel I'm so sorry Lord and then he still went on like that because bam doesn't want to hurt other people then in his meetings they call the brother's name will tell people like that those of you with testimonies of Miracles come and give a testimony and they'll come and give a testimony and then everybody is sitting in the in the front row because they're looking for a miracle themselves and the B was going on like that what the angel had told him not to do CU people they see Miracles but they don't have faith they are see because they see they are seeing the Miracles because they see if you see a miracle happen on the spot why won't you believe for yourself so one day 1947 this was early on his Min not not for years early on his ministry 1947 the M called the angel of God 2 of November 1947 a man was praying for a deaf mute for a deaf person and he prayed and said can you hear me the person didn't see anything can you hear me the person didn't see anything so a few people down the line said like that he stopped and said no brother bam open transparency then started giving this story that the Lord has been speaking to me that I should not do these things like that he said not have always a miracle line make it a healing line because he said in that sense that this Serv is his healing line not a miracle line so that the but he said some some Pastor brother will come and say and the people will come and all the miracle everybody's coming looking coming for looking for a miracle miracle miracle miracle miracle and so he prayed and somebody did not get healed somebody not get healed so bam prayed and said Lord I promise you from today no matter what anybody says I'll do what you tell me I'm not I'm not going to do it this way anymore Hallelujah I'm not going to do this anymore I'm going to let the people believe and they'll be healed I won't let their faith be upon until they see a miracle before they believe that's what God was trying to kill Israel off in the promised land and that's how where many of us still are only way we get our provision is Supernatural Supernatural let me not run ahead of myself I'll let you go shortly amen ready go shortly so what I'm saying here is that just like God did not want Israel to live from Miracle to Miracle because it will never grow they will never grow they will just become entitled you know Paul to Rich Kids amen same way he doesn't want his church to live so that unless they see a miracle they will not believe and so God made sure that when he go in the promised land he changed the order and that's why you can pray all you want to you can fast all you want to you can read all the motivational books all you want to believe with so much Faith as to move mountains all you want to without the work of your own hands you'll never come into abundance never ever you may have your basic needs met but you'll never come into abundance you just have enough you just have enough and that place of enough is Will is not a very good place to be amen but read through from Ephesians even them that still let him have it let him have for himself so that can also have enough to even give out to who needs not like a father Christmas to who needs that's abundance without the work of your own hands you'll forever grapple with and live in the land of not enough and the land of Never Enough Just Enough amen so in the promised land which was the fertile land of bible promises which is the fruit of milk and honey in due season God was going to bless the work of the hands and number two he was going to further unveil an additional element of how he miraculously provides in his kingdom by his laws of nature and the role that each one of them was to individually play this each one of us has a role to play I said this over and over and you know that already but let me just say it again all through the Bible three fundamental ways God God God God acts and provides number one he provides by Supernatural ways his signs wonders and miracles that's what Israel found out in the wilderness number two he provides by his laws of nature sewing and repping planting and harvesting which is what we are going to Boos to do in the promised land and number three by his Providence which is favor things you just cannot explain God just gets there and does it those are three ways that God works and operates through amen All Through the Bible now the the the promised land it was now he had showed them all through the Wilderness years his power to provide for them supernaturally by Supernatural water from the rock Mana from heaven and all that now I was going to show them the second part of how he provides in his kingdom by the laws of the Kingdom by the laws of his laws of nature amen that he himself put there planting and harvesting sowing and reaping amen the Bible said the promised land was ready and was FL with milk and honey it was ready means the land was fertile it was ready to receive seed and let it bring forth amen so Malachi 4 let's understand like when they go in the promised land they didn't see thean honey but the the milk and horny laid hidden in the land in the hills in the mountains under the Earth in the waters all over the land and the only way they will get at the milk and honey was by their own planting and harvesting their sewing and raping by the work of their hands amen so citizens of the kingdom of God Believers ask again what do you have in your hand whether it's small insignificant only Five Loaves only one barrel of meal meal one Cruise of oil what do you have in your hand whether it's a crooked Shepherd a Shepherds crooked staff whether it's one Talent five Talent 10 talents what do you have in your hand what do you have in your hand wants to bless the work of your hands because it's the Zeal the awesome the Zeal is the awesome power the energy the energ IC power of the Lord of hosts his passionate power is what's going to perform it not the work of your hands he wants to bless it that's his Blessing but you must have the work of your hands and then He blesses that amen it didn't say the work of your hands he want them so that you will not say the work of my hands has gotten me this no he wants to bless the work of their hands oh Hallelujah are you following our kingdom story here oh brother hey amen I'll I'll I'll I'll let you go shortly amen amen so what they needed to get the food in the promised land what they need to get at the milk and the Honey was not prayer you can pray all you want to fast all you want to it was not about waiting for a miracle no to get at the abundance they need that to have the work of their hands definitely a life of prayer and the Devotion to God is part and parel of it but that's not the order here what they needed to do simply was to get to work to plant and sow the land so they'll be able to access the food which was the milk and honey that was hidden all over the land Israel found out in the promised land that the land flow milk and honey was only a figure of speech what you call a metaphor amen it wasn't that they'll be walking and swiming in milk and honey once they got into the promised land no he was not the milk was only a metaphor for nourishment for richness for goodness for royalty in ancient climbs only royalty drank milk and they say goat milk that's when that's what the Queens used to like Rob themselves and and make their skin silky it was Royal food milk so the milk in the promised land represented royalty he told them I want to be you to be a royal priesthood unto me amen it only been Ser only with what is fit for royalty amen the mil was only a metaphor Israel found out for nourishment for richness for goodness for royalty and the honey as you say hi honey you know hi honey the honey was a metaphor for sweetness for beauty for attractiveness for sophistication for affection for excellence that's what the horny represented and the flow was a metaphor for abundance and overflow of God's goodness and richness into their lives an overflow of all the good things that the milk and the Honey represented as you have been talking about an overflow of it of God's richness of God's beauty of God's Excellence flowing in their lives oh Hallelujah glory to God and it was all over the land the land flowing will make an honey the land when God talks land is land Earth under the Earth in the water sea and the air that's the land amen when you talk about the Earth he talking about everything there in the earth is the Lord and the fullness thereof the Earth the ground under the ground above the ground in the skies in the water in the air that's the land amen oh glory amen so God give me 10 more minut I'll be done okay God in wanting to bless the work of the hands God was introducing them to further and additional laws in his kingdom how the kingdom works by the laws of nature all through the Wilderness he has shown them time again that his kingom works by Supernatural and all that like we said over and over but now he wanted to let them know that the kingdom also works by the laws of nature and in there you're going to have abundance for yourself and that's where he led Israel understand the value of work work work work let me just take this I'll closed okay at 10 15 minutes I I close don't sleep stay aler no some I'm sleeping already so about don't sleep no some young men are not remaining right now work work so they feel like that so work what's that mean Adam had work in the Garden of Eden before the fall and Adam had walked in Eden after the fall after it was driven out of Eden he had walk Adam had to work even a perfect say he had to work before the fall the work that he did was to provide solution till the ground dress the garden name the animals because the Bible said there was no man found to teal the ground it was so to speak quote and unquote a problem that God was looking for somebody to hire to serve it and he couldn't find one person to hire so God the Creator went to work and created the hire he needed which was Adam so Adam was here to work and his work was to provide a solution for God look at the clientele that Adam had god wow Adam's work before the fall was to provide Solutions because Genesis 27 God made man and bring to him and Man became a living soul and God put the man he had made in the Garden of Eden and God told him of all the trees in the G you may eat but hise of may not eat and God told him that to put him in the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it and then God brought all the man in man to him to name them but for Adam there was not found a help meate for him before Eve work and like you know we said over and over Adam he want to get I mean marriage Eve but no marriage because talking with a young man oh let me leave that alone okay let me leave each in ears 18 years let me just say it let me just say it CU I heard some some that in Legos Church they never marry and all that stuff they never let them marry and all that I I don't have a problem with that I don't have a problem with that but you know and forgive me forgive me church just like when I went to Europe the other other time and the brother is trying to tell me I mean tell me like that what you do say in your church it's about call your great to scr me on how to take care of the sheep of God under my care and don't you ever don't you ever try that again don't you ever do that again I'm not a public person and I don't none of us should be I mean I don't mean public in public I don't mean like show off type type of person whatever but what I do is for for say if you're not part of this church not not of your business none of your business but say the young man that other people do their things the way they feel and I don't get into it but why judge me I said but in Legos you're not going to marry if you don't have a a s of income and don't have your own house I don't mean a mansion you can be under a tree but it's not going to be in your daddy and your mommy's house other cultures I know like I was in India India when they get married they that their culture I'm not talking about that I'm talking but that's not the culture here and I don't mean you must get a mansion if I was getting married today I will not leave my daddy's house I will go from my daddy's house in the morning to Mar marry and I'll go to my house in the night why would I want to miss my mommy's meal for why so I am not saying you must have a I'm saying like that for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother let's do that first and Cliff to his wife because she has to leave in many cultures is a taboo for you you to marry and go and live in your with your father and father-in-law in their home and I said but other place I see them once the boys are ready to marry they get to marri and many of those boys have funded their marriages and they have no job no work and they marry and I don't complain about that I don't I don't criticize what they do that's the man's Revelation why what I do if you if you're you got to you got to have a decent job I'm not saying you must have all the money in the world you must let me see what you must if it's 100 n you earing a month you got to be able to manage it so that you'll be able to take care of that girl cuz once you marry 9 months time a baby comes and like I said repeatedly worldwide the number one cause of marital stress number one is immorality worldwide and unfortunately Christians are caught up in that too unfortunately messy people are CAU up unfortunately people inside here are caugh up with that too let's get real let's not fool ourselves number two number two CA of marriage marital stresses is financial troubles financial troubles so I'm not going to set up my children for that I'm not saying you must have all the money in the world no you must have the responsibility and that's what God did if your daddy is good enough Rich enough to get to your house he had better do it if he if he and that's why I believe parents can help the children to set up to set off in life your daddy can rent the house for you he can you had better do it but like I said I let Daddy Daddy the rent starts the day I leave your house on my married date on my on my on my on my the day I get married so I can stretch the money I can stretch the rent and number two because God gave adam a beautiful Garden of Eden and nextly he gave him a job once he gave me a job gave him a house marriage could come he wasn't see with God up in heaven no God was visiting him in his house that he get his son you can say I'm spiritualizing you can see I'm sping that's my [Applause] Revelation if it takes you time to get the house together what has he got why why why blame me for it right all [Music] right I said before and I'm not and and I'm not I'm I'm forgive me I said 10 minutes right 10 minutes I think my 10 minutes is up okay all right I know it as you like this kind of talk I know you like this St I know but you know thank God I forgot what I want to say Spirit of the Living God Spirit of the Living God itching HS itching airs God said took it out of my mind I forgotten what I want to say I forgotten itching air seriously I forgotten Peter what did I want to say Isaac what I want to say you you took it out of my mind seriously seriously I forgotten I forgotten seriously seriously H you remember that okay what did I say 5 minutes ago on the message itself uh our organist Jonathan what I say 5 minutes ago on me they can't remember but they remember marital stress Lord have mercy that's loss for money loss for women loss of popularity this a DE to the believer and we all say I said it's not true it's not true so marital stress no no we don't care about those things no we care that's why that's the only thing you remembered you remember anything else but seriously I forget what I was trying to say I forgot what I was trying to say myal stress say that again huh no I finish that I finish that you are about 2 minutes behind I finish that um that's my prompter there brma what you say what what did I say what was it say that again B what you say [Music] all right and then and then and then give him a job and all that okay okay I think I finished it actually all right okay I think it's just God the spirit overriding so that so that so that the Hing ears will not you know so you can you can listen God has something to say listen listen pay close attention so let let me try and close up here let me try and close up here so God anyway um he he found um the man he didn't find the man but he created the man for the position amen and so Adam you know had a job and Adam's work Adam's work work work work work I talk about meaningful work all the time he can work but is a work meaningful is work value value driven Bible Bible I showare from the Bible that's why I'm taking my time on this here I mean I'm not not today through the series and I'm not in a rush to finish it but I'll try and finish before the year runs out so Adam uh uh um had to work before the fall the work that he did was to provide Solutions which forgot and that's look at his the quality of his clientele God was the one that hired him to do work for him and in providing Solutions um in providing solutions for God God wanted somebody to te the ground to dress the garden to name the animals um in providing Solutions Adam validated his own position as a Creator as a little Creator under God his father who was the creator of the universe so before the fall Adam's work was this here was about all about providing solutions for God for his clientele and was his work was wrapped around wisdom and creativity you know these days everybody talk about you know startup startups and like everybody wants to a startup and they don't even know what it takes to Startup I don't want to work spiritual the very idea of a startup you have Innovation the stock market calls Innovation God calls it wisdom and creativity the stock market just at wisdom and creativity and a market plan and they call it Innovation the innovators that's what it is just wisdom and creativity that's what Adam had or how could he have how was he could he have named the animals who taught him how to take care of the garden and keep it in good shape good order wisdom who told him to to coin the names for the animals wisdom he was creative a Creator like God himself and in naming the animals he placed them in their orders like the the the I forgot all those things but the zoo whatever the different orders and all that the mammals and the whatever their orders in giving them the names the wisdom the creativity to do that he showed he was a Creator himself amen that's the quality of work that Adam did in the Garden of Eden his work definitely required effort effort see it was work work requires effort but it was productive work it solved the problem that God had to teal the ground to name the animals to do the things that was lacking in the garden it was fruitful work be fruitful you know many times when we he in the Bible Genesis 12628 be fruitful we think about the fruit of the womb no when I I I I won't get to it I'm too still too far from it I don't want to keep you too long I know I'm boring to many of you right now but again Genesis Deuteronomy 28 I was going to show you work there and I'll get to you maybe next time work work and you see what say about the fruitfulness the fruitfulness of thy body the fruitfulness of thy land the fruitness of thy cattle the fruitfulness of the different things the fruitfulness it's not just but he said your your body also will be fruitful and that in that context I talk about you know maybe you a sister you don't have a baby I don't say you're baring you're buring I don't talk like that but God said your body will be fruitful will be fruitful you will have your baby you will have your baby and don't let anybody put a tag on barness on you because you are not Barren amen you will have your baby you will carry your baby amen and we'll come here and sing see what the Lord has done what we waited for has come to pass see what the Lord has done you'll carry your Samuel like fine carried a Samuel you'll carry your Samson you'll carry your Joseph Don't Cry Little Sister your baby's on the way because he will bre the fruit of thy body can I hear you say amen [Applause] amen amen let's close out here so Kingdom work Kingdom work work work Kingdom work as Adam demonstrated must be fruitful in other words must be productive might be fruitful work we'll get into it in some detail and to be productive and fruitful it must be tailored to solving problems like Adam s for God the bigger the problem the more complex the better to be fruitful and productive solving increasingly bigger and more complex problems it must be done with wisdom and [Music] creativity in other words the more creativity and wisdom you bring to bear and apply to your work the more productive your work will be power power to be creative and when you're creative it creates wealth you create value you create the gold for people power to create wealth so Kingdom walk let me recap is solution providing is productive is creative and is waved around wisdom amen wisdom have builded her house has he out a seven peers amen amen glory amen so Adam's work Adam's walk was the pathway by which he demonstrated his dominion over everything on the earth fruitful multiply sub replenish subdue dominate The Avenue through which he did that was the work that he did his work was tied to his purpose for for being let us make mine our image and let them have dominion over the land and the Sea and all that stuff but his work was going to bring out that Dominion was going to bring out that fruitfulness was going to bring out that uh uh uh multiplication are you following me all right it's so simple in other words by the work that Adam did before the fall that was how he was able to demonstrate the potential that the talent that God plac in him to dominate the potential was there the talent was there but work is what brought it out work is what brought it out and I always tell you that Talent is nothing you can have genius level Talent without work it means nothing that's why they tell you that genius is 99% sweat you are gifted a baby is gifted you can have a genius baby who is gifted to be the greatest soccer star in the world to make all the money for all their Village in Nigeria but can you put that baby on the soccer field even though he's gifted supernaturally from God no work is what's going to bring out that gift going to bring out that potential that's where your talent's [Applause] coming I'm not sure you're following me going to help us Genesis 1:26 let us make man in our own image and let them have dominion over everything on the face of the earth I always show you that's potential that's talent and God put that in every single man yours may be one Talent mine may be two another might be five but every man because the Bible say to every one of us he giveth the talent every man every man that's potential and God now goes to verse 28 to explain how that potential comes out fruitful replenish I mean multiply replenish subd dominate so you have potential Adam has been told you going to dominate but how did he do it good put him in Eden and walk is what pulled it out of him your talent is not the same as your skills no no it's not because you have talent that you are chrisan Christian Christiano Ronaldo no it's not because you have talent that you are Le mercy no your talent plus some work is what results in your skills when you when you hone your talent do work you are practicing laboring practicing work practice labor they say practice makes perfect no practice makes permanent you are practicing laboring practicing laboring it bring out that tent holding that Talent it turns into a skill even when you have a skill you don't stop there you still keep holding the skill work out on your skills work out on your skills work out on your skills work out on your skills I'm talking I'm telling you about work work on your skills and then your skills give you achievement that's how it comes that's how you get the honey that's how it comes very quiet in here is is every is everybody bed people is everybody B where are the bed n people let raise your hands up no they won't they won't raise their hands up or should I call you out bet Niger so they so this thing is hard it's hard work that's Kingdom work kingdom

David took everything back is it the 400 men is it the 318 men no the spirit of the Lord the spirit of the Lord Kingdom battle Kingdom principles and that's what we are talking about here that's why we want to partner with God first and we can he can he can deploy his resources he can deploy his army which is the spirit of the Lord to battle for us hallelujah hallelujah in the in the in the time
