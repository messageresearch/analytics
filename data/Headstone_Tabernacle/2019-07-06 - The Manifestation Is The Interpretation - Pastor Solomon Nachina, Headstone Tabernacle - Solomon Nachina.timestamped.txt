[1:03:27] realm went up and saw and where we
[1:03:30] supposed to be for such a time as this
[1:03:33] what kind of condition we supposed to be
[1:03:35] him as the time begins to unfold and we
[1:03:39] see the Bible talk about the beginning
[1:03:41] of Sorrows it's important that we see
[1:03:46] this but we want to tank she say

[1:04:08] from Ghana I'm gonna stick you this
[1:04:11] morning and you know many times people
[1:04:17] think being a leader you have to have a
[1:04:20] title a post a position but it's not
[1:04:22] really so I want to show you that you
[1:04:25] are called to lead you here this morning
[1:04:28] you you the people leading is the
[1:04:31] behavior its attitude oh praise the name
[1:04:35] of the Lord the bird man says a minister
[1:04:38] now a minister cannot being a revival
[1:04:40] there is no preacher can being a revival
[1:04:44] he doesn't pack it with him the only
[1:04:47] thing he can do is to be loyal to God
[1:04:49] and with his word and the revival has to
[1:04:52] come by the people in your home in your
[1:04:58] life revival isn't adding new members to
[1:05:01] the church is reviving what we have
[1:05:03] already got so when the church get in a
[1:05:06] rut we need a revival it doesn't have
[1:05:09] new but it changes and under what is
[1:05:13] already dear or glory to God and then he
[1:05:16] said isn't it strange that God would
[1:05:18] want the people to have patented it when
[1:05:21] Jesus looked out into the harvest he
[1:05:23] said the harvest is ripe the laborers
[1:05:26] are few you pray the lord of the harvest
[1:05:29] that was him you pray to me that I will
[1:05:33] send laborers into my harvest it is some
[1:05:36] part you have to do God is waiting for
[1:05:40] his church to call on him so you say you
[1:05:43] written on God and go reason anew it's
[1:05:46] just to call on him he always did it God

[1:06:31] revival he ain Phoenix that people will
[1:06:34] be flying from Europe to see what taken

[1:16:10] I'm just here as a messenger of the Lord

[1:16:17] meet the one who sent the message but I
[1:16:20] trust this morning we are gonna enjoy
[1:16:22] ourselves
[1:16:22] so as we stand to our feet this morning
[1:16:25] shall we go straight to the word much
[1:16:30] each of the 13 read verse 30 39 42 41
[1:16:42] you know Jesus talking about the parable
[1:16:45] of the sower like into the kingdom of
[1:16:48] God rest a t-cell let both grow together
[1:16:51] until the harvest and in the time of
[1:16:54] harvest I will say to the Reapers gather
[1:16:57] ye together first the tares and bind
[1:17:00] them in bundles and bend them but gather
[1:17:03] the wheat into my barn
[1:17:05] verse 39 the enemy that sowed them is
[1:17:13] the devil but the one that stood the
[1:17:15] test now is the devil the harvest is the
[1:17:18] end of the world and the Reapers are the
[1:17:21] Angels amen
[1:17:23] verse 40 and I was there for the tests
[1:17:25] are carried and been in the fire so
[1:17:28] shall it be in the end of this well the
[1:17:31] Son of man shall send forth his angels
[1:17:33] and they shall gather out of his kingdom
[1:17:35] all things that offend and them that
[1:17:39] which do iniquity Ecclesiastes chapter 3
[1:17:43] verse 1 and to that to everything there
[1:17:48] is a season and a time to every purpose
[1:17:50] under the heaven a time to be born and a
[1:17:54] time to die a time to plant and a time
[1:17:57] to pluck up that which is planted made a
[1:18:01] lord are a blessing to the ring of his
[1:18:03] word you may please be seated a man I
[1:18:07] trust us you see give him praise we are
[1:18:11] here to worship Him he's the only one
[1:18:14] that deserves our praise and worship so
[1:18:16] this morning for a title the
[1:18:18] manifestation is the interpretation
[1:18:21] hallelujah what is in the ground let it
[1:18:25] come to the manifestation then it will
[1:18:27] give itself the interpretation my
[1:18:30] subject is at the appointed time and
[1:18:32] obviously the inspiration the harvest
[1:18:35] time hallelujah so the Prophet said this
[1:18:39] morning and I want to read from
[1:18:40] blasphemous names
[1:18:41] he said now coming from the Holy Spirit
[1:18:44] what is coming then he will give you
[1:18:47] supernatural faith amen
[1:18:51] spiritual faith that here at the bottom
[1:18:55] then that's spiritual faith recognizes
[1:18:58] only the word no matter what anybody
[1:19:01] says it don't do no good hallelujah the
[1:19:07] manifestation will only recognize the
[1:19:10] word which would be the interpretation
[1:19:13] it's not going to be theory is what the
[1:19:16] way it's said but at where has an
[1:19:18] appointed time to be manifested it has
[1:19:21] an appointed time to be vindicated and
[1:19:24] you cannot let that word come at the
[1:19:26] time that it is not appointed is that
[1:19:29] Abraham I will visit you according to
[1:19:31] the time of life and Sarah your wife
[1:19:34] will have a son now there had to be a
[1:19:37] time of life no matter how you know
[1:19:40] Abraham was in a hurry to have that
[1:19:42] sound they had to come that appointed
[1:19:44] time that appointed season for Sarah to
[1:19:48] get in that condition to receive that
[1:19:51] child hallelujah Abraham was a man of
[1:19:54] faith but the appointed time had to come
[1:19:57] and it was according to God's own time
[1:20:00] Abraham couldn't push it for it to go
[1:20:03] here to contain 25 years on the promise
[1:20:06] it shall be
[1:20:07] it shall be I'm gonna have a son why God
[1:20:11] said so hallelujah hallelujah
[1:20:14] they opposition had to come the critics
[1:20:17] had to come but God hath spoken it and
[1:20:19] Abraham received a spiritual faith he
[1:20:23] wasn't looking at the circumstance of
[1:20:25] Sarah and this bride receives a promise
[1:20:27] hallelujah
[1:20:29] that is coming for a bride that bride is
[1:20:32] going to come for nothing will stop her
[1:20:35] hallelujah she is called
[1:20:37] she is predestinated she sought aim to
[1:20:40] comfort hallelujah
[1:20:43] but that bride cannot comfort until the
[1:20:46] appointed time but thank God this is the
[1:20:49] appointed time because we have gone
[1:20:51] through the denominational period
[1:20:53] hallelujah you may be seated
[1:20:55] but the problem said Amen there were
[1:20:58] three groups that were planted and when
[1:21:02] you plant you are looking for the
[1:21:03] harvest
[1:21:04] there are interested in the crop how
[1:21:06] beautiful the green crop is your focus
[1:21:10] is at the end what you are going to read
[1:21:13] from that crop hallelujah
[1:21:15] so three groups were planted when
[1:21:18] Abraham said Oral Roberts King he meant
[1:21:22] I with me this morning on a robe SK tear
[1:21:27] laws won't came the Prophet came and
[1:21:30] they all planted and the Prophet that
[1:21:34] you wonder why you don't hear about Bill
[1:21:36] agree how many more you wonder why I
[1:21:38] don't hear about Oral Roberts anymore is
[1:21:40] that an evil mind is the deadest of them
[1:21:42] all but it was gone into the ground it
[1:21:46] not being planted for a manifestation
[1:21:48] for a manifestation today you see the
[1:21:51] denominations are growing Indian numbers
[1:21:53] and numbers and numbers why it is a
[1:21:56] harvest time because a denominational

[1:22:02] numbers they were interested in the
[1:22:04] numbers they have the numbers but
[1:22:06] brothers coming for the price and that

[1:22:43] coming into the Machine like they used
[1:22:45] to know the seeds have been planted and
[1:22:47] the Prophet that bride will be in a
[1:22:49] minority because she'll be the Wed only

[1:22:59] the word she knows no man-made creep
[1:23:02] hallelujah Oh blessed be the name of a

[1:23:24] what are we do we'll make it ourselves
[1:23:26] ready for that bridegroom Oh glory be to
[1:23:29] the Living God so the prophet left the
[1:23:32] word in there
[1:23:33] hallelujah and he said he left the
[1:23:36] promise that the seven thunders will
[1:23:39] gather the bride and by roving read this
[1:23:42] morning about how people were planning
[1:23:45] to see it manifesting but there has to
[1:23:47] be a Kathryn first hallelujah that is
[1:23:51] our seat because after the prophets
[1:23:53] finished with the Pentecostals he still
[1:23:55] had two pretty kinds of believers amen
[1:24:00] three kinds of believers that was coming
[1:24:03] three kinds of believers I left
[1:24:05] Pentecost bolita prophet but three kinds
[1:24:09] of believers but in death as believer
[1:24:11] let's make believe up the unbeliever
[1:24:14] but the promise is to the believer that
[1:24:18] promise of the resurrection of Jesus
[1:24:20] Christ is to the believer Alleluia and
[1:24:23] the Prophet loved the promise the wait
[1:24:25] till them seven thunders so there's a
[1:24:29] waiting for an appointed time for these
[1:24:31] seven thunders to author their voices to
[1:24:34] that group there's a special Group the
[1:24:37] pride group the pride group the elected
[1:24:41] group the chosen group the odain group
[1:24:44] the predestinated group that group that
[1:24:47] knows no man's free wait till them seven
[1:24:50] thunders and what is that unless Christ
[1:24:52] Himself the cup stole the headstone and
[1:24:56] he's coming for the harvest the harvest
[1:24:59] of the bride that I've waited long
[1:25:00] enough or to get that hot July son ha
[1:25:05] July son you might have wanted it in

[1:25:10] you murabba wonder it in April but it
[1:25:12] wasn't time Oh glory to God that relies
[1:25:16] on her to count and when he came it was
[1:25:18] time for the harvest is that come on
[1:25:21] call up the Reapers let him put the
[1:25:23] sickle in
[1:25:24] before the enemy can do more damage and
[1:25:26] we are promised that is dynamics to our
[1:25:30] mechanics so all that we receive was
[1:25:33] mechanics hallelujah the Busan teams
[1:25:36] were mechanics but brother in the
[1:25:38] mechanical church members they were
[1:25:40] unbelievers they were big believers
[1:25:42] brother but the heavens had to come to
[1:25:46] separate a shock to separate a big
[1:25:48] believer to separate the unbeliever and
[1:25:51] to leave that bride alone because the
[1:25:53] Prophet said that bride has the material
[1:25:56] on the edge or to overcome that bride
[1:26:00] has a material on the earth to make it
[1:26:03] to perfection that bride has the
[1:26:04] material right now Oh glory be to the
[1:26:08] Living God to bring for the
[1:26:10] manifestation of the Holy Spirit that is
[1:26:13] why we are shouting we are not shouting
[1:26:16] because we are funny we are shouting
[1:26:18] because we know we have a revelation
[1:26:20] that our word is unfolded that our word
[1:26:23] is unveiled that God is unveiled in the
[1:26:27] word Oh here imprison small
[1:26:34] [Music]
[1:26:38] hallelujah hallelujah but a problem
[1:26:43] restore the Son of man reveal the son of
[1:26:48] man hallelujah and the Pharisees came
[1:26:51] tempting Jesus is a wench on this the
[1:26:54] kingdom of God come Jesus - let me
[1:26:58] comment on with observation you know
[1:27:01] when they churches 1,000 people then the
[1:27:03] kingdom is coming hallelujah I said they
[1:27:07] would tell you though here this is the
[1:27:08] man of the hour I said no don't listen
[1:27:10] to that hallelujah this is in a secret
[1:27:14] place
[1:27:17] thank you for I'm protecting the
[1:27:20] password hallelujah I'm had a man I like
[1:27:28] a man that and protects himself you have
[1:27:30] nothing to hide
[1:27:31] I want you lock key down man there's
[1:27:34] some secret thing going on there
[1:27:36] hallelujah he said in the secret place I
[1:27:40] don't go there because the kingdom of
[1:27:43] God is within you
[1:27:45] that son of mine has been revealed it's
[1:27:50] within you now Andrew Brown revealed the
[1:27:52] son of man as promises only to the bride
[1:27:56] the Prophet had to come be seated and
[1:28:00] tie up the loose ends of the entire
[1:28:04] Bible because the word will judge the
[1:28:08] world so judgment warning has to come
[1:28:11] before judgment so the Pentecostal need
[1:28:14] to know the restore the full restored
[1:28:16] word to reject it and they can be jacked
[1:28:19] by that word the unbeliever has to see
[1:28:22] and know that the wear has been fully
[1:28:24] restored to reject it and then be jacked
[1:28:26] by that way
[1:28:28] so God sent the Prophet to tie up every
[1:28:30] loose end
[1:28:31] so metal this house do excuse Catholic
[1:28:35] has no excuse the Pope has these books
[1:28:38] he has to excuse
[1:28:39] hallelujah but that was in their promise
[1:28:42] the promise was for the bride
[1:28:44] so after tying up the loose ends
[1:28:47] he then released the Son of Man as
[1:28:49] promises hallelujah
[1:28:53] and Peter said by these promises you
[1:28:56] become partakers of the divine nature of
[1:28:59] God and find a child divine me that you
[1:29:03] have nothing to do with it Mary had
[1:29:05] nothing to do with it be done to me
[1:29:08] according to your word I have nothing to
[1:29:11] do with it no man has nothing to do with
[1:29:13] the divine nature of God the problem
[1:29:18] revealing us promises and on the horizon

[1:29:31] the appointed time to watch you suffer -

[1:29:40] obligated to meet you on the basis of
[1:29:44] them promises hallelujah hallelujah on

[1:44:41] but bronzed at the church the real
[1:44:43] believer is looking for the

[1:45:12] you may be seated
[1:45:15] Amen a spoken word is the original C
[1:45:17] vertebra hamza remember the Bible said
[1:45:20] in Genesis Amen that every seed of the
[1:45:24] east kind a to bring forth after its
[1:45:27] kind that's right every seat will have
[1:45:29] to bring remember the F is full of seeds
[1:45:33] the rain makes it bring forth after each
[1:45:36] time hallelujah
[1:45:40] back home when the grains and the
[1:45:43] harvest and you know everything is dry
[1:45:45] and they set fire wait to rain comes
[1:45:48] next
[1:45:50] even though fire has gone through but
[1:45:53] some seeds
[1:45:55] waiting for the rain once the rain drops
[1:45:59] you see them shooting up hallelujah so
[1:46:04] the ring where the problems that the
[1:46:06] former rain has come
[1:46:08] is that a Pentecost Pentecost felt our
[1:46:11] they had the formal remembrance that
[1:46:12] they never had the former ring but the
[1:46:15] former rain couldn't come without the
[1:46:17] messenger so until palabra Homme stepped
[1:46:22] on the scene no formal ring for us at
[1:46:25] the formal rain is a teaching rain but
[1:46:31] after the teacher read has another ring
[1:46:33] to come Oh glory to God so we are not
[1:46:37] just paying with the former rain I mean
[1:46:39] the message former rain tribulation
[1:46:42] specialist formal rain no we are not
[1:46:45] staying there is that let us move to
[1:46:47] perfection he said on to your mechanics
[1:46:50] odd dynamics and he is the dynamics the
[1:46:57] latter ring must stamp and the prophet
[1:47:00] that we are going to have to we're gonna
[1:47:03] have poof the former and the latter rain
[1:47:05] together Oh glory we are gonna have the
[1:47:10] revelation path and the manifestation
[1:47:13] paths the two will be together because
[1:47:16] dynamics with other mechanics no good
[1:47:19] mechanics with other dynamics no good
[1:47:24] hallelujah so the provident believe each
[1:47:27] other by the fundamentalism of the word
[1:47:31] the word the word new spirit hallelujah
[1:47:34] and the Pentecostal spirit know where
[1:47:37] the prophecy like a man having money and
[1:47:40] can sign the check and somebody can send
[1:47:43] a check no money the Raza bring the two
[1:47:46] together while you bring the two
[1:47:48] together than something can take place
[1:47:50] Oh glory to God we'll need the dynamics
[1:47:53] will meet the dynamics we have the
[1:47:56] mechanics we have the mechanics we can
[1:47:58] explain the mechanics of it but where is
[1:48:01] the power
[1:48:02] but our gospel is not in word only
[1:48:05] but is in power oh and demonstration of
[1:48:09] the holy spirit is in power power to
[1:48:13] overcome power to stand and believe

[1:54:44] born by the will of man or by shaking of
[1:54:48] hand or some form of baptism but born of

[1:55:32] two seeds the seed of discrepancy and
[1:55:35] the seed of God they put forth their
[1:55:37] genuine heads amen
[1:55:40] that wound up in Judas Iscariot and in
[1:55:43] Jesus Christ for he was the son of God
[1:55:46] Christ now he was the beginning of the
[1:55:48] creation of God he was nothing less than
[1:55:50] God and Judas Iscariot's was born the
[1:55:53] son of perdition came from hell
[1:55:56] return back to hell the truth harvest
[1:56:03] time our scripture let both grow
[1:56:06] together at the harvest time at the
[1:56:10] showdown the manifestation will be the
[1:56:13] interpretation that harvest time man but
[1:56:18] Abraham said amen Judas in his
[1:56:22] discrepancy was the seed of
[1:56:24] devil come to the well for deceit my
[1:56:30] preaching to somebody is born hallelujah
[1:56:34] Judas had a peppers Judas had a
[1:56:37] commission Jesus had a commission to you
[1:56:42] both seats so in the heart of men
[1:56:48] hallelujah also don't worry about what
[1:56:52] is going on in the message the elect
[1:56:55] will come to the hedge - nothing will
[1:57:02] stop the elect
[1:57:04] no matter how downtrodden how rejected
[1:57:08] how cut away they will come to the edge
[1:57:12] - called the up predestinated - it
[1:57:19] hallelujah
[1:57:20] Judas in his discrepancy was the seed of
[1:57:23] the table come to the world for this
[1:57:24] seat just like he was at the beginning
[1:57:26] Cain his former father
[1:57:28] Judas only play Church Judas knew how to
[1:57:34] clap and sing and dance and do all this
[1:57:36] which was though experienced with the
[1:57:39] Holy Ghost
[1:57:43] rather he wasn't really sincere he
[1:57:46] didn't actually have faith he have if he
[1:57:50] had Hyrum never betrayed Jesus but see
[1:57:53] he sowed the seed of discrepancy he
[1:57:56] thought he could make friends with the
[1:57:58] world
[1:58:04] when there's no believer I can wear some
[1:58:06] pants fit in he thought he could make
[1:58:17] friends with the world maman and have
[1:58:19] fellowship with Jesus but it was too
[1:58:22] late for him to do anything about it
[1:58:24] when the death hour came when he did
[1:58:27] this evil thing he crossed a separation
[1:58:30] line between going forward and retaining
[1:58:33] back glory this is real there was a
[1:58:48] rupture your fate is on the tapes all
[1:58:51] that you need to make heaven is here all
[1:58:54] that you need together Holy Ghost is
[1:58:56] here when the dead hour came when he did
[1:59:05] this evil thing he crossed the
[1:59:07] separation line between going forward
[1:59:09] and returning back he had to go on in
[1:59:12] the way that he went as a deceiver he
[1:59:15] sowed the seed of discrepancy he tried
[1:59:18] to find favor with those great big
[1:59:20] organizations of the day with the
[1:59:22] Pharisees and Sadducees and thought he
[1:59:24] would make himself some piece of money
[1:59:26] he will popular among the people if he
[1:59:29] doesn't if he doesn't consume any people
[1:59:32] to get in that discrepancy trying to
[1:59:34] find a fever with man
[1:59:35] let's find favor with God
[1:59:41] this morning let me find fever with God
[1:59:46] not with man but that was what Judas
[1:59:50] done when this discrepancy headed up in
[1:59:53] him and we know that Jesus was the word
[1:59:57] since John one said in the beginning was
[1:59:59] the word and the word was with god and
[2:00:01] the word was god and the word was made
[2:00:03] flesh and dwelt among us then the way it
[2:00:06] is a seed then the seed become flesh and
[2:00:09] dwelt among us
[2:00:10] if G if Judas was the seed of the enemy
[2:00:14] and discrepancy it also became flesh and
[2:00:17] dwelt among us in the person of Judas
[2:00:20] Iscariot the prophet s spirits don't die
[2:00:26] so they asked Jesus when will the
[2:00:32] kingdom come
[2:00:34] Jesus told them as it was in the days of
[2:00:38] Noah so shall it be in the day when the
[2:00:41] Son of Man is revealed remember before
[2:00:46] then they will tell you here don't go
[2:00:48] for cementing to follow I mean then the
[2:00:56] word is a seed then they will become
[2:00:57] flesh and blood among as Christ now if
[2:00:59] Judas was the seed of the enemy or I
[2:01:02] mean the seed of the enemy and the
[2:01:03] discrepancy
[2:01:04] it also became flesh and dwelt among us
[2:01:07] in the person of Jesus Judas Iscariot
[2:01:10] he never had no real fate Judas had no
[2:01:16] faith he had a make-believe fake man
[2:01:23] brother he had he thought he had faith
[2:01:26] there is no such a thing as having freed

[2:04:28] following and the problems that fire is
[2:04:30] the confirmation of the light coming
[2:04:33] from the way not deadness fire but while
[2:04:37] you are shouting this fire
[2:04:41] is light coming from the world is a
[2:04:46] confirmation that lights is coming
[2:04:51] revelation is coming for a manifestation
[2:04:54] is that fire the confirmation of the
[2:04:57] light coming from the world he meant the

[2:05:12] on that oil God said so God said so that
[2:05:17] is what you are saying when the word is
[2:05:19] coming for God said so
