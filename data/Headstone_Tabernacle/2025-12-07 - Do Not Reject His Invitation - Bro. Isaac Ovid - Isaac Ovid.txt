[music] We give you honor. We give you thanksgiving. From the rising of the sun to the going down of the same, your name is worthy to be praised. If we had 2,000 [music] tongs, it would not be enough to praise you. Hallelujah. If we write it, it will not be enough to praise you. If we tell people about it, it will be not enough to praise you, Lord. It will never be enough to praise you, Lord, [music] for your goodness and your mercy. [music] Shall we pray? Our gracious heavenly father, we thank you this morning, Lord, that we can be in your presence one more time. Lord, we don't deserve any blessing. Lord, there's no works, there's no effort, [music] there's nothing we could ever do to be qualified, Lord, for your grace and your mercy. We could look at our lives. We could look at our failures. We could look at our mistakes. And when we weigh them against the good that we could ever do, Lord, the good will always be outweighed [music] by the carnal nature. But Lord, you put provision to take care of [music] that through your blood. That when you look to us, you look through the blood and the blood speaks on our behalf. So Lord, our sins don't speak. Our mistakes don't speak. Our failures don't speak. What we did yesterday doesn't speak. But the blood speaks better for us. It translates. It covers. It takes care of the issues and gives a good report for us when we bring our issues under the blood. Lord, as we stand on this sacred ground this morning, Lord, not because this building is holy, but because a holy God is in this place, because you inhabit the praises of your people. And [music] Lord, you promise to be there where they are two or three gathered in your name, you promise to step into the midst of that. And we dwell in the midst of that. And you said when the praises would go up, the glory of God would come down. It's not our effort. It's not our works, but it's by your design, Father. And if there's one thing you are subject to [music] is your own law, Father. And your law made provision for us that if we come to this blood, we could come into your presence through the blood. [music] And we can make requests. We can make petitions. We could ask what we will and it shall be done this morning, Father. Lord, for this portion of the bride of Jesus Christ that's gathered, Lord, in this physical location and even online, Father, we [music] submit to your leadership. We submit to your authority. We submit to your word as presented through the scripture and opened by your prophet messenger even a star in the right hand of God. Father Lord, may you take me out of the way. May my thoughts be nothing. May my words be nothing and may only what you once said be said. May only what you want done be done this morning. [music] May you bless the reading of the word and bless the hearing of it and the opening of our understanding. May you bless those that are here, those that are connected online. We are so grateful for your presence this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ. Before we read the scripture, let's just sing that song. Elohim Lord, [music] we [singing] long to ship [music] you. Tell [music and singing] me how [music and singing] we want to worship you. [music] One more time. [singing] Hallelujah. Hello. Hallelujah. [music and singing] Hallelujah. I worship you. [music] Hello. [singing] [music] Oh, [singing] we long [music] Lord. We come to you. [music] It [singing] works. No matter what the circumstance, [music] no matter what the situation, no matter [singing] what the city [music] you [music] will lift up all over the building, lift your voices. Lift them up. Hallelujah. Oh, [singing] [music] hello. Hello. Oh, how we love to worship you. How we love to praise you. [music] Oh. [singing] [music] Hello. [music] [singing] How we long to worship you. [music] How we long to worship you. [music] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. You love him this morning. [music] Amen. While you're standing, if you have your Bibles, we'll just read one portion of scripture now. Later on, we'll touch another. But let's read from St. Luke 14. I'd like to welcome one and all in the presence of the Lord this morning. St. Luke 14 and reading from verse 16, a familiar scripture. And we'll touch this context and then later on we'll go into Matthew 22. But St. Luke 14:E 16. Then said he unto him. A certain man made a great supper, and bade many, and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, "Come, for all things are now ready." And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground and I must need go and see it. I pray thee, have me excused. And another said, I have bought five yolk of oxen and I go to prove them. I pray thee, have me excused. And another said, I have married a wife and therefore I cannot come. So that servant came and showed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, "Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor and the maimed and the halt and the blind." And the servant said, "Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room." And the Lord said unto the servant, "Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in that my house may be filled. For I say unto you that none of these men which were bidden shall taste of my supper." May the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his holy word. You may be seated in the presence of the Lord this morning. And for a title for our time in the presence of the Lord this morning, do not reject his invitation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do not reject his invitation. &gt;&gt; Before I go further, I have two notes of praise just to uh bring the church into a certain context from Sister Donna K. Clark. My mom would like to thank God for his continued grace and mercy over her life. For the past few weeks, she had been experience experiencing sincere gastrointestinal issues and was unable to eat and has lost significant weight. But I continue to praise his holy name. He has blessed me to see another year and she's now 84 years old and I could say by God's grace I'm feeling much better. Uh today thanks and blessings also to all the saints with their prayers. Thanks from Sister Donna K. Clark on behalf of her mother. So we thank God for that. And from Sister Phoebe Granville, I want to thank God. I want to give God the highest note of praise for his healing touch. I had been dealing with a medical issue. It was not improving despite medication. In October, I was referred to a specialist who recommended surgery. The elders prayed for me after service and about two weeks afterwards, I observed that the symptoms had stopped. &gt;&gt; The surgery which was scheduled for last week was cancelled. All thanks and praise to my Lord and Savior G. Hallelujah. [applause] Glory. Jehovah Rafa. May his name be exalted forever and ever. This is a tremendous testimony. We are looking for more cancellation of surgeries. We are looking for doctors to be confused. Do you know that we are called to confuse the doctors &gt;&gt; because when the great physician does work on you, you don't need a doctor. &gt;&gt; And we know the great physician is always here. He is looking to answer the prayers of the saints. But the one thing he looks for is that act of faith. And once faith is presented, then God can respond. Can the church say amen? Everybody feeling fine? &gt;&gt; Well, it's wonderful to be in the house of the Lord on Sunday morning. There's no better place to be. The psalmist David said, "I was glad when they said unto me, let us go into the house of the Lord." Hallelujah. So, it doesn't matter your trials, your testings, your failures, your mistakes, what went wrong, what you think, what you feel, because God is not looking at your emotion. He's done looking at your yesterday. He's done looking at how you even think or feel. He only looks at his word because he is only obligated to honor his word. That's the only thing he respects is his word. The Bible said HE IS NO RESPECTOR OF PERSON. So he doesn't even respect me. HE DOESN'T RESPECT THE PASTOR, BUT HE RESPECTS THE WORD. AND HE RESPECTS THE WORD IN you and I. AND WHEN HE SEES THAT WORD, HE GIVES HONOR TO THE WORD BECAUSE the word IS HIS HIMSELF. ANYBODY IN THE HOUSE THIS MORNING? Oh hallelujah. [cheering] And that's why the word seed in you is your identification. Your word seed in you is more important than your passport. IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE ID CARD. THAT'S WHY WE COULD SAY WITH BOLDNESS YOU ARE NOT THE BELIEVER BUT the seed in you which is the word in seed form is the believer. AND THE ENVIRONMENT HAS TO BE RIGHT FOR THAT SEED to come to life. And once you put that seed in the right environment, it must only PRODUCE OR CAN ONLY PRODUCE OR WILL ONLY PRODUCE WHAT'S BUILT into the seed. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; That's why God could say to THE DISCIPLES AFTER HE GAVE THEM POWER, DON'T REJOICE BECAUSE YOU HAVE POWER. We could pray for you this morning and SEE THE POWER WORK. AND THAT'S WONDERFUL. BUT THERE'S A GREATER REJOICING THAT'S ABOVE THE POWER. THAT REJOICING IS BECAUSE YOUR NAME IS WRITTEN. AND BECAUSE YOUR NAME IS WRITTEN, THAT IS YOUR IDENTIFICATION. BECAUSE YOUR NAME IS WRITTEN, YOU COULD LOOK AROUND YOUR SITUATION and say, "THOUGH THE SKIN WORMS DESTROY MY BODY, YET IN MY FLESH, I WILL SEE GOD. BECAUSE MY NAME IS WRITTEN, THERE'S A THEOPHONY FOR ME. BECAUSE MY NAME IS WRITTEN, I'M PREDESTINATED FOR A BODY CHANGE. I CAN LAY THIS FLESH DOWN AND I'LL PICK UP ANOTHER BODY BECAUSE THIS IS NOT WHO I AM. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; THIS HOUSE IS A HOUSE FOR MY IDENTIFICATION. THIS 16 ELEMENT IS A HOUSE WITH A SEED IN MY SOUL. And if your son has a seed in her in his soul, HE HAS GOT TO COME FORTH. IF YOUR DAUGHTER HAS A SEED IN HER SOUL, SHE HAS GOT TO COME FORTH. DON'T LET THE MINISKIRT OR THE CIGARETTE OR THE MARIJUANA OR THE BOYFRIEND OR THE GIRLFRIEND DISTRACT YOU FROM THE SEED THAT GOD PUT THERE. THAT SEED IS GOING TO COME TO LIFE. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to be too long with you today. I know I have to apologize. You know the pastor tell me don't say that. &gt;&gt; He said don't say you're going to be we come to church to have church. &gt;&gt; You want to say we we not going to be too long with you. You say don't don't say that. So I apologize. &gt;&gt; But we are here to have a time in the Lord. &gt;&gt; We're here to celebrate around his word. And man taught us we ought to be the happiest people &gt;&gt; on the face of the earth. &gt;&gt; Happiest people on the face of the earth. IT MEANS OUR HAPPINESS IS NOT TIED TO THE MONEY IN YOUR BANK. THE HAPPINESS IS NOT TIED TO YOUR JOB. THE HAPPINESS IS NOT TIED TO YOUR HOUSE. THE HAPPINESS IS NOT TIED TO YOUR CAR. IT'S HAPPINESS IN GOD. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HEAVEN AND EARTH WILL PASS AWAY. BUT THAT WORD CANNOT PASS AWAY. YOUR JOY MUST BE IN THE WORD. YOUR WORSHIP MUST BE IN THE WORD. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO WE COME TO THE HOUSE of God [cheering] &gt;&gt; to see in the mirror of the word what we need to do to adjust because we are being dressed in the word. WE ARE BEING DRESSED BY THE WORD. WE ARE BEING PREPARED BY THE WORD BECAUSE ONCE THE WORD HAS BEEN FULLY RESTORED THEN THE FULLNESS OF THE SPIRIT can move because the WORD IS THE CONDUCTOR OF THE SPIRIT. THAT'S WHY WE ARE NOT A PENTECOSTAL CHURCH. AND WE THANK GOD FOR THE MINISTRY OF THAT ELIJAH PROPHET WHO WOULD TIE UP EVERY LOOSE END. Reveal the MYSTERY OF THE SEVEN THUNDERS. SHOW US HOW TO go [cheering] &gt;&gt; so we CAN STAND WITH CONFIDENCE. HALLELUJAH. I'M GOING TO THE RAPTURE. THIS IS NOT just words. THIS IS NOT JUST DECLARATION. IT'S A STATEMENT OF FACT. [cheering] &gt;&gt; OH, you don't hear me this morning. This is not positive affirmation, friends. This is not us SAYING SOMETHING TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT OURSELVES. WE ARE GOING to the rapture. IT'S A STATEMENT OF FACT THAT'S MORE REAL THAN THIS BUILDING WE ARE IN. BECAUSE THE WORDS THAT GOD SPOKE CREATED THINGS INTO EXISTENCE AND THE WORDS WE SPEAK, THE SPOKEN WORD IS THE ORIGINAL SEED. CAN THE church say amen? [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; So today is a special day. We would have spoken to the church some time ago and told them we want to put the young people to some work. There's some talented young people among us and we are learning more about the young people learning who has different gifts and talents because we have had those who have carried the burden for a long time. You know there was a time that I considered myself very young. I'm still young but I consider myself very young. And I'm realizing I'm about to hit 45. And that's at on the one hand, brother Jason, that has its its scariness to it. I say, "But wait a minute. I remember when I was looking at people who was 45 and saying they're old." Now, that's not older. If you notice, we have been lifting the age of the youth the youth thing. The youth age moving with some of us. Somebody say just now it'll be 12 to 65 because some of us refuse to accept the fact that we're getting older. But the reality is when you look at the deacons and the deacons wives and the elders and the officers, the reality, God is a God of progress. &gt;&gt; God is a God of succession. &gt;&gt; God is a God of seeing people step up to the plate against all odds. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what the world presents. God is still God. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And he is still the God that says, "I am the Lord and I change not." We may be dealing with technological advances and dealing with AI and all kind of different things now. But God is still God. And God will still have a witness who will stand in 2025 and beyond and proclaim the glories of the living God and testify that this message is right. And if this message IS WRONG, THEN I DON'T WANT TO BE RIGHT BECAUSE I'M THAT PERSUADED THAT GOD SENT A PROPHET TO BRING US OUT OF LEADSIA AND PUT US INTO an age. [applause and cheering] Can the church say amen? And to let us know the HIDDEN MYSTERIES OF SCRIPTURE THAT WE COULD STAND ON THESE THINGS WITH CONFIDENCE AND SAY WE are going to be changed and transformed. Can the church say amen? [cheering] &gt;&gt; So after service, we're going to have some fellowship and a wonderful time and uh it will be set after service as well. This coming Wednesday there will be no physical service. We'll stream and this coming Friday there will be no service because this coming weekend, Brother Andrew Glover will be here in Trinidad for the very first time. He has a tremendous ministry and he will be speaking on Saturday at 3 p.m. to the church with a message that's dedicated to the young people. And this coming Sunday at 10:00 a.m. and at 4 p.m. we do expect believers from other churches to join us. Uh but by the grace of God, we want to be able to get the word and be further strengthened in this season. We are the end of the year. I can't believe that this year is finished. &gt;&gt; I don't even know where 2025 went. But the George, I remember when I was in secondary school, we were talking about Y2K coming. And when I was in secondary school, I said, "Yap, you have to come before Y2K." And I see Y2K came and Y2K went. And 2020 when I taugh 2020 would see the rapture. I recognized I was facing exams. Because at some point you would think, well, when the rapture come, it save you from an exam. No. Maybe the rapture come to finish. You don't have to go and work. You don't have to get no mortgage. You don't have to get bills because the rapture taking you out of this existence. And you don't have to deal with all the stress you see the older ones deal with. But God through his grace and mercy had a sifting process to really see who would believe after all these years &gt;&gt; and what we would do with the word that we have received for all these years because it's very easy when you hear something and it's fresh and you're inspired and you're excited to run with it. BUT OVER TIME THE CARES of life &gt;&gt; STARTS TO HAVE AN EFFECT ON US AND SOMETIMES THE RELEVANCE OF THINGS BEGIN TO change and that's tied to our topic today. &gt;&gt; Do not reject his invitation. Amen. &gt;&gt; And as we are in this season of the end of the year and Christmas and hospitality, I want you to imagine for a moment you prepare, you clean your house, but you're supposed to have it clean all the time. Are we are we together? &gt;&gt; And Christmas is just a special cleaning. &gt;&gt; I hope we don't have people who just waiting for the end of the year. I'm having a I haven't started to preach yet. I just having a conversation. wait till the end of the year to go into hyperdrive. You know, I always remember brother John Phillip, precious brother Johnny Phillip said, "I'm not painting this Christmas. I'm not painting this Christmas." Not painting. It was Christmas Eve. Brother Mike, he went and buy the painting and that whole night he painted him. never forgot it because the spirit of the season got a hold of him and what he said he wasn't going to do he end up doing because they get caught up with him. But I want you to imagine for a minute you clean your house and you put your maybe a vegan ham and you know you have all kind of things now. You put your food in the oven and you prepare your meal and you set things up and you invite brother George to your house and you invite brother over to your house and you invite brother Jason and you invite sister Batista and sister Julia to your HOUSE AND YOU INVITE ALL THESE PEOPLE, brother Micah to your house. You you cook the food in them. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU TOOK TIME AND WENT TO THE GROCERY and you bought the items. You had the checklist. You didn't you you you didn't take chances because you wanted to make sure you get all the ingredients. &gt;&gt; You prepared things. You invested in the things. You put the food. You have everything ready. And then you say, "Listen, come." And you realize the invitation was for 2 p.m. and 2 p.m. reach and nobody reach. 2:15 p.m. reach and nobody reach. 2:30 p.m. reach and nobody reach. 2:45 p.m. reach and nobody reach. 3 p.m. REACH AND NOBODY HAD THE courtesy &gt;&gt; to tell you initially I can't make it or no &gt;&gt; are we together &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HAD YOU BEEN ADVISED BEFORE YOU COULD HAVE CANCELED the whole thing &gt;&gt; BUT NOBODY SAID BECAUSE IF YOU KNEW BEFORE you wouldn't bother to put the effort in place &gt;&gt; are we together &gt;&gt; but in the last minute YOU REALIZE IS NOBODY WHO I invited coming. &gt;&gt; You're looking at the table, you're looking at the food, you're looking at the preparation, you're looking at the place and say, "But what I really I I really waste my time." &gt;&gt; And this is one of the parables that Jesus gave, &gt;&gt; one of them. And this one is the simpler. We'll get to the more complex later in the service. &gt;&gt; But we read the scripture. A certain man made a great supper and bade many and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden. SO HE STILL HAD TO GO AND TELL THEM I I INVITED YOU. You coming? This is like we WhatsApp and you know in truth they tell somebody you're on your way. They say yeah. Meanwhile they're now leaving home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where you reach close they know the trinite spirit. &gt;&gt; Meanwhile they coming from grand toss racing down the highway. So he sent them to bid and they all I want the word all with one consent is as if they were in an accord or an agreement began to make excuse. &gt;&gt; The first said I have bought a piece of ground. So in other words I've made an investment &gt;&gt; and I must needs go and see it. I pray thee have me excused. Now I want to point out something here that many of us miss in life because I preached a message similar to this years ago. what nine years ago called no more excuses &gt;&gt; and in it I was saying there are many of us who feel that giving an excuse is getting you out of the situation &gt;&gt; because when you read this scripture you'll realize God actually doesn't care about the excuse &gt;&gt; he wants to hear NO EXCUSE &gt;&gt; HE CALLING YOU TO LIVE A HOLY LIFE THERE IS NO EXCUSE &gt;&gt; YOU calling you to be better THAN YOU WERE YESTERDAY THERE'S NO EXCUSE SAYING HUSBAND LOVE YOUR WIFE well the reason I had do it that way. Like we always say many times we respond to situation and we say well it's because he tell me that that's why I tell him that &gt;&gt; that is an excuse &gt;&gt; because he say this is why I hit him &gt;&gt; and hit somebody don't have to be physical hit or it could be with your words &gt;&gt; it could be with your action it could be and YOU ARE SAYING BECAUSE SOMEBODY did this is because the reason why and that is an excuse &gt;&gt; are we together &gt;&gt; and the other said I've bought five yoke of cup of oxen and I go to prove them you decide to go and try to see these ox really good and meanwhile food cook for you I pray have me excuse and they said I'VE MARRIED A WIFE AND THEREFORE I CANNOT come now what this is showing us this goes all the way back to Genesis we're going to preach in a little while to when God said to Adam why you did this &gt;&gt; what was Adam's response. Adam didn't say, you know, I made a decision based on what was presented in me, but I decided he didn't say that or no. He said the woman &gt;&gt; that you give me. &gt;&gt; So, he blamed both the woman and God himself. &gt;&gt; In other words, if you DIDN'T IF I DIDN'T have this woman, I wouldn't be in this position. And if you didn't give her to me, I wouldn't be because I WAS GOOD ALL BY MYSELF. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And this speaks to responsibility and accountability. BUT AS WE COME TO THE END OF THIS YEAR 2025, and prepare for 2026, we need to reach a point of NO MORE EXCUSES. &gt;&gt; WHY YOU HAVE AN EXCUSE ABOUT YOUR PRAYER LIFE? &gt;&gt; At one point in preparing this message, I thought about asking the t the title being what is your excuse? We are trying to figure out what you could possibly say to God to explain to God why you treat your wife wrong, &gt;&gt; why you treat your husband wrong, why you're not managing your home a certain way, why you not active in church, why you not living a testimony on what is your issue? What would you say to God? Because this is not about a man here, you know, this is a parable because God is showing how he feels about the matter. &gt;&gt; Are we together? This is not AN INVITATION TO A HOUSE. WE USE IT AS AN EXAMPLE. BUT HOW DOES GOD FEEL ABOUT IT WHEN HE GAVE YOU SOMETHING AND HE INVITED YOU TO HIS GLORY? HE INVITED YOU TO HEALING. HE INVITED YOU TO VICTORY. HE INVITED YOU TO THE PROMISED LAND. HE INVITED YOU TO THE HOLY GHOST. HE INVITED YOU TO RESTORATION. THE BANQUET HE HAS LAID OUT FOR YOU IS A SEVEN COURSE MENU. FAITH, VIRTUE, KNOWLEDGE, TEMPERANCE, PATIENCE, GODLINESS, BROTHERLY KINDNESS. THE PREPARATION OF THE FOOD IS THROUGH PRIESTS AND PROPHETS WHO HAVE CAREFULLY PUT THINGS TOGETHER, RIGHTLY DIVIDING THE WORD OF TRUTH. EVERYTHING HAS BEEN LAID OUT FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO COME AND FEAST AT THE MASTER'S TABLE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; In this analogy, in this parable, FRIENDS, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO come and cook. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO COME AND PREPARE THE FOOD. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SHOW up and eat. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HEAR ME THIS MORNING. JUST COME AND EAT. HALLELUJAH. YOU KNOW HOW GOOD YOU FEEL WHEN SOMEBODY INVITE YOU AND PREPARES YOU AND SAY DON'T WORRY DO I NEED TO BRING anything no I just want you to come. IT'S ONE OF THE BEST feelings they ever get. Say come now. WHAT DID HE BRING? DON'T BRING NOTHING. YOU COMING ALONE IS WHAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. AND THAT'S WHAT GOD IS SAYING. [screaming] COME. COME AND GO WITH ME TO MY FATHER'S HOUSE. THIS IS BETTER THAN THE WORLD. IT'S BETTER THAN THE TROUBLE YOU'RE GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW. HALLELUJAH. [applause and cheering] But these people made excuses WHICH I WANT TO QUALIFY seem legitimate &gt;&gt; because everybody WHO MAKES AN EXCUSE, they believe they're justified in the excuse. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, if you know my boss, if you know this, if you know that, if you see what what he come and tell me, whatever it IS, IT IT'S JUSTIFIED. IT MAKES SENSE TO YOU. I was saying about over recently, if you are in the picture frame, you can't see yourself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are in the frame. IT TAKES SOMEBODY OUTSIDE OF THE FRAME TO POINT out to you, you are in a wrong place, brother. &gt;&gt; You're in a wrong place, sister. You have the WRONG PRIORITIES. BECAUSE THIS HERE IS A CASE OF PRIORITY. THE GOOD LORD INVITE YOU TO A SUPPER, INVITE YOU TO HIS TABLE, PREPARED A MEAL FOR YOU, AND YOUR BUSINESS MORE IMPORTANT THAN GOD'S INVITATION. You don't hear me THIS MORNING. YOUR INVESTMENT MORE IMPORTANT THAN GOD'S INVITATION. HALLELUJAH. WHAT YOU DOING IN YOUR DAILY LIFE MORE IMPORTANT THAN GOD'S INVITATION WHEN THAT WILL FAIL AND FALL APART? [cheering] &gt;&gt; YOU CANNOT PUT YOUR FAMILY ABOVE GOD. YOU CANNOT PUT YOUR JOB ABOVE GOD. YOU CANNOT PUT YOUR THINKING ABOVE GOD. HE SAID, "MY THOUGHTS ARE HIGHER THAN YOUR THOUGHTS. MY WAYS ARE HIGHER THAN YOUR WAYS." THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU ARE DOING THIS WEEK. YOU DON'T HEAR ME THIS MORNING. THERE'S NO BETTER PLACE TO BE THAN IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. THERE'S NO BETTER INVITATION TO GET THAN TO COME TO THE HOUSE OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. SOMEBODY GIVE GOD A SHOUT of praise. Hallelujah. Oh, glory. Hallelujah. We take SO MUCH FOR GRANTED. THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND. And I want you TO UNDERSTAND, GOD ISN'T PLAYING GAMES BECAUSE THE END OF THIS SCRIPTURE SAID, "ALL THOSE THAT WERE BIDDEN WILL NOT EAT OF THE SUPPER. IF YOU REJECT HIS INVITATION, HE cuts you off. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU REJECT THE HOLY GHOST, HE CUTS YOU OFF. YOU REJECT THE WORD, HE CUTS YOU OFF. YOU REJECT HIS GOSPEL, CUTS YOU OFF. YOU REJECT THE PROPHET, CUTS YOU OFF. [applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; GLORY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'm not marking nobody's papers this morning. The word is marking your papers. The word is marking your life. The word is marking your testimony. Hallelujah. He said, "Make your calling and election sure. THAT'S NOT THE PASTOR. THAT'S NOT THE ELDER. THAT'S NOT THE DEACON. THAT'S NOT THE TRUSTEE. THAT'S YOU. MAKE YOUR CALLING AND ELECTION SURE. YOU HAVE WORK TO DO. YOU ARE INVITED TO PRESS. YOU ARE INVITED TO POSSESS. YOU ARE INVITED TO CLAIM. YOU ARE INVITED TO TESTIFY. YOU ARE INVITED TO MAKE A CHURCH AND OMEGA REVIVAL. YOU ARE INVITED TO PRAY. YOU ARE INVITED TO DRESS RIGHT. YOU ARE INVITED TO LIVE RIGHT. YOU ARE INVITED TO HAVE A TESTIMONY. [cheering] NO MORE EXCUSES. LET TODAY BE THE LAST EXCUSE. LET TODAY BE THE FINAL EXCUSE. NO MORE EXCUSES. OH, HALLELUJAH. Turn to your neighbor and say, "No more excuses. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Turn to your other neighbor and tell them no more excuses. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THIS MIGHT NOT EXIST IN ANY OTHER CHURCH. We No CHURCH COULD MARK OUR PAPERS. WE WANT NO EXCUSES in this church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We want to GET IT RIGHT. GET IT RIGHT ALL THE TIME. GET IT RIGHT ALL THE TIME. I WANT MY PRAYER LIFE TO BE RIGHT. I WANT MY WALK TO BE RIGHT. I WANT MY TESTIMONY TO BE RIGHT. I DON'T WANT NO EXCUSES. I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO TELL GOD, "WELL, IT'S BECAUSE OF THIS AND BECAUSE OF THAT, NO MORE EXCUSES." LET IT END TODAY. LET IT BE FINISHED TODAY. WE ARE STANDING UP AS SOLDIERS IN THE ARMY OF THE LORD. LET US ENDURE HARDNESS [cheering] AS GOOD SOLDIERS IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD. IF YOU MAY BE SEATED. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Brother Gideon preached a message a few weeks ago. The mission must be accomplished. &gt;&gt; If we are going TO RESCUE SOMEBODY, WE CAN'T COME AND SAY, "WELL, I did bounce MY FOOT. THAT WHY I COULDN'T FINISH THE MISSION." &gt;&gt; WHAT KIND OF soldier are you? &gt;&gt; We send you to COMPLETE THE MISSION. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T WANT NO EXCUSES. GOD HAS NEVER MADE AN EXCUSE YET. &gt;&gt; WHEN HE WENT FOR NOAH, [screaming] HE GOT NOAH. WHEN HE WENT FOR ABRAHAM, HE GOT ABRAHAM. WHEN HE WENT FOR LOT, [cheering] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HEAR ME. THE BIBLE SAID THE ANGELS GRABBED LOT [screaming] AND PULL LOT. LOT DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO GO. BUT THE ANGEL WAS ON A MISSION AND HE COULDN'T BRING BACK AN EXCUSE TO GOD. [applause and cheering] NO ANGEL HAS EVER COME BACK WITH AN EXCUSE. [cheering] &gt;&gt; You don't hear me this morning. EVEN THE FISH THAT HAD TO TAKE JONAH COULD COME BACK WITH NO EXCUSE. THAT FISH WAS DESIGNED TO GET JONAH. HE COULDN'T SAY, "I DIDN'T SEE HIM. I DIDN'T FIND HIM. HE FALL TO THE LEFT. HE FALL TO THE RIGHT. I COULDN'T CATCH HIM." THE FISH HAD TO DELIVER. AND WE HAVE TO DELIVER. WE HAVE TO MAKE A CHURCH THAT WILL MAKE A REVIVAL. WE HAVE TO DELIVER. SEVEN THUNDERS WILL GATHER THE BRIDE. WE HAVE TO DELIVER. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [cheering] &gt;&gt; The mission must be accomplished. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. Nobody's leaving here sick. &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; The prophet SAID, "HOW COULD WE HAVE FAITH FOR A rapture and we don't have faith for DIVINE HEALING?" &gt;&gt; SISTER PHOE'S TESTIMONY IS JUST A TASTE. &gt;&gt; It's just a taste of what's TO COME BECAUSE YOUR BODY HAS TO BE HEALED BEFORE IT CAN BE TRANSFORMED. YOU DON'T HEAR ME THIS MORNING. THESE GRAY HAIRS, WHETHER GRAY HAIR GOING TO GO BACK BLACK, I DON'T CARE WHAT THE DOCTOR SAYS. OH, YOU DON'T HEAR ME THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Brother Michael, THE HEART SURGERY YOU WENT THROUGH, THAT IS TEMPORARY. WATCH THE GREAT CREATOR PUT HIS HAND AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS IN ORDER. He is able to do it. WE COME AGAINST CANCER THIS MORNING BECAUSE THE MISSION WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED. HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, FEMALE CONDITION, DIABETES, LOW BLOOD PRESSURE, WE BIND IT THIS MORNING IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. BACK PAIN, SCIATIC, ARTHRITIS, I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS. HOUSE OF HELL, HOUSE OF HELL, GIVE WAY TO THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [cheering] &gt;&gt; FATHERS, &gt;&gt; you are priests. Yes. &gt;&gt; of your homes. &gt;&gt; There can be no excuse. &gt;&gt; We have preached it before. When the high priest &gt;&gt; had to walk into the holies of holies, &gt;&gt; they would tie a rope around him. &gt;&gt; If I was a high priest, brother Popwell, &gt;&gt; I'm making sure I check the people first. &gt;&gt; You living right. &gt;&gt; You living right. &gt;&gt; You living right. Because now you going to die, you know. Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; If the high PRIEST GOES INSIDE THE HOLIES of holies &gt;&gt; and the people have a wrong standing, the high priest dies. &gt;&gt; This is why judgment begins in a sanctuary. &gt;&gt; At the ancient men are THOSE WHO HAVE SAT UNDER THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR &gt;&gt; AND KNOW BETTER BUT HAVE NOT DONE BETTER BECAUSE THEY HAVE MADE EXCUSES. Are we together this morning? &gt;&gt; We have become very casual. &gt;&gt; All of us. I'm not speaking to you. I'm speaking to all of us. people say after co people get so used to the stream and different things and all kind of different things &gt;&gt; but it's still excuses &gt;&gt; conversations you have on your job why what is your excuse because whatever you do comes from your heart you know &gt;&gt; well he talked to me and what he tell me no brother in church never told me. &gt;&gt; I'd already feel the appreciation. &gt;&gt; Are we here? &gt;&gt; What she said to me, I didn't even know how to respond. I was speechless. We'll find scripture. Speechless. Did I have speechless in scripture, too? For every person ever caught doing something wrong, I have yet to hear somebody who say right away easily is it was me. You know, the bandit has an excuse. Everybody has an excuse. And an excuse is only required when you finished the mission or you're doing something wrong. Think about it. Because if you deliver the product, if I say bake a cake for me and you bake it and bring it in a time, there's no room for you to even have an excuse to it did the job. &gt;&gt; But if the cake air come out good, you never see those cakes that sink in the middle. &gt;&gt; But over made one. There are few I don't want to call it childhood trauma but it was that and the melon scarred me for life for years. We didn't have meon in the house after about cook it. It took years for that to be bought again to even be cooked. It wasn't even considered to be purchased to be cooked. Such was the damage done with that pot of melon. And the excuse might be I don't have the experience or nobody show me or nobody teach me or I didn't think and BUT IT'S STILL ALL EXCUSES &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT COMES DOWN TO YOU BEING HUNGRY FOR WHATEVER YOU want in life. &gt;&gt; Where you spend your time, what you discuss, WHO YOU SPEND TIME WITH TELLS ME WHO YOU ARE. BUT THE MAN SAID, "SHOW ME YOUR COMPANY. I'LL SHOW YOU WHO YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T NEED TO DESCRIBE ME. I DON'T NEED TO SEE YOUR JOB DESCRIPTION OR your your CV or your profile. Let me see who you walking with. &gt;&gt; BUT THE BIBLE SAYS, "SHOW ME WHAT PAGES WRITTEN UP ON YOUR BIBLE. SHOW ME IF THERE'S ANY HIGHLIGHTER MARKS. SHOW ME THE MAGAZINES IN YOUR HOME. SHOW ME YOUR HISTORY ON YOUR TV OR YOUR NETFLIX OR WHAT YOU WATCH ON FACEBOOK OR TIK TOK. I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. NOTHING YOU COULD TELL ME COULD COUNTERACT THE EVIDENCE. &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; AND IF I HOLD YOU TO YOUR EVIDENCE, YOU'LL SAY, "WELL, WHAT? I was just killing time." &gt;&gt; That's the excuse. &gt;&gt; I was just killing time and a scroll and a stroll and a stroll and I stumbled upon it. Oh, really? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see how easy it is &gt;&gt; to make excuses. And in these excuses, this is again, is that the pastor marking your paper? Is God looking at your attitude? &gt;&gt; What is your excuse for holding on? &gt;&gt; What is your excuse for not forgiving? &gt;&gt; Because the fact that you haven't forgiven means something is holding you back. And whatever that is is your excuse. &gt;&gt; And let me and I I think the last time I preached, we talked about the spirit of gossip. Anybody remember that &gt;&gt; and say you gossiping to somebody and none of this happening here helping the person who you gossiping about is a real spirit or &gt;&gt; the same thing with forgiveness. You not forgiving you holding an alt and a grudge. And the reality is God not testing the person God testing you. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you leave this service today with the right picture that you are the one on trial, &gt;&gt; you are the one being tested. Not your wife, not the pastor, not the deacon, not your brother, not your sister, NOT YOUR CO-ORKER, YOU ARE THE ONE ON TRIAL. IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN GOD looking at you, he not considering any other factor but you. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Can we see that picture? SO WHEN GOD LOOKING AT YOUR CASE, HE NOT SEEING YOUR MOTHER, YOUR FATHER, your brother, your boss, your neighbor, the money, the bank account. He has SEEING YOU BECAUSE ALL OF THESE INPUTS ARE IRRELEVANT. All God is interested in is the output. &gt;&gt; GIVEN ALL OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES AROUND YOU, WHAT WORDS ARE COMING OUT OF YOUR MOUTH. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE EVERY ONE OF US HAVE SITUATION AROUND US WE CANNOT CONTROL. BUT WHAT YOU COULD CONTROL IS THE WORDS YOU SPEAK. &gt;&gt; WHAT YOU COULD CONTROL IS THE THINGS YOU COULD DO. &gt;&gt; Are we here this morning? We said a few services ago, &gt;&gt; you could never love your children more than God could love them. Amen. Some of us we love stupid &gt;&gt; brother love does make people do some nonsense you know &gt;&gt; in the thought that is right you know but God's example of love is corrective &gt;&gt; he say as many as I love I rebuke and chasen is two things rebuke and chasen &gt;&gt; so HE'S SHOWING LOVE HAS ATTRIBUTES WITH IT THAT IS TRUE LOVE BECAUSE love will not let you walk and fall into a ditch love will pull you and throw YOU IN THE CAR SO YOUR CAR GO OUT AND FALL IN A DITCH BECAUSE YOU DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THE FOOLISHNESS YOU OWN. LOVE WOULDN'T SAY WELL LET HIM FIGURE IT OUT AND FIND HIS WAY. NO, LOVE WILL BREAK YOUR FOOT. THAT'S WHY THE PLAN OF SAID IF LOVE DON'T GET YOU DESPERATE CONDITIONS WILL. AND GOD HAS HAD TO BREAK FIGURATIVELY many feet [applause] [cheering] TO BRING US BACK TO THE HOUSE OF GOD AND SAY LORD I LOVE YOU. LORD I THANK YOU. LORD I APPRECIATE YOU. LORD I NEED YOU. BECAUSE WE GO ON OUR OWN STRENGTH AND WE MISS WHAT GOD IS DOING. BUT I THANK GOD THAT WE HAVE a revelation that love is corrective. That God wants the best for us even when we cannot see it for ourselves. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Are we together? I can look back at growing up &gt;&gt; and many times at the time when I was being disciplined we we honestly share my testimony a little bit we don't be grateful for correction when we getting it at the point of time you know &gt;&gt; at the point of time because it goes against whatever we thought was right &gt;&gt; so say that is the wrong thing to do &gt;&gt; are you seen it so you know &gt;&gt; and for the young people this is a special service for Young people, you cannot see what your parents seeing. &gt;&gt; You cannot see what the PASTOR SEEING &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE BIBLE places him in a watchtower. &gt;&gt; Meaning he has a higher vantage point. He has more access to even what's around you than you because he could simply see higher than you. &gt;&gt; So if you say, "Hey, be careful." This is why I said in the last service, don't enter this thing called marriage unadvisedly. We read it. &gt;&gt; Don't enter unadvisedly. &gt;&gt; Who gave you advice? Amen. &gt;&gt; Who are you seeking for advice and counsel? The Bible say out of the wisdom of counselors decisions are made. &gt;&gt; Who are your adviserss and are they godly adviserss? &gt;&gt; Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel &gt;&gt; of the ungodly. &gt;&gt; Many of us have ungodly counsel. &gt;&gt; We preach it. &gt;&gt; Somebody in your job say give give your husband the silent treatment. That is godly counsel. &gt;&gt; And where do you find godly counsel? &gt;&gt; Many time we don't spend time nailing these things down. But there's a reason because there are people who think they're going to the rapture and they have no rapture to go because they're out of order. &gt;&gt; With a brand taught and it's in the word, everybody should have a home church. &gt;&gt; So anybody who have a revelation and not in a home church, they have no revelation. Yes. &gt;&gt; They have no revelation &gt;&gt; because you have to have a home church &gt;&gt; and there's a watchtower for the home church that is the pastor of the church &gt;&gt; who is supposed to BE THERE TO PROTECT YOU NOT JUST FROM ONCOMING DANGER BUT FROM yourself &gt;&gt; because you cannot see yourself &gt;&gt; and that's why it's easy to see others. This why they say take out the mode from your eye first &gt;&gt; before you talk about other people because many of us we see it. Look at that one. Look at that one. Look at that one. This why I say don't talk about anybody children &gt;&gt; because you don't want to come into your home. &gt;&gt; THESE ARE PRINCIPLES THAT LIFT US UP TO A HIGHER LEVEL. WE TRYING TO SET THE CHURCH IN ORDER BECAUSE there are more problems to come. &gt;&gt; We haven't dealt WITH GOLIATH YET. ALL THIS BEAR AND LION trial you going through is just warming up for your Goliath to know &gt;&gt; and your Goliath is YOU AND GOLIATH THE PASTOR NOT IN THAT EQUATION. WE ARE HERE to mentor you until you reach your own Goliath because you HAVE TO DEAL WITH YOUR OWN PERSONAL DEMONS BECAUSE THE BRANDHAM SAID THE PHILISTINES ARE PERSONAL DEMONS. &gt;&gt; THE ONES YOU'RE feeding &gt;&gt; are we together? Anybody in the house this morning? [cheering] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying anything strange. Everything we say in brother George is in the prophet's message and in the Bible. &gt;&gt; I'm just here to remind you of what you already know. Maybe you haven't heard IT IN SOME TIME, BUT IT'S TO REMIND YOU THAT YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY. &gt;&gt; I cannot sit as a minister and watch you do foolish and not say something about it. &gt;&gt; It's not personal. &gt;&gt; I must be about my father's business. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO STEP UP. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE TO DO BETTER. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T KEEP COMING LATER, CHURCH. THAT IS ALL OF US. I'M NOT SPEAKING TO YOU. IT'S ALL OF US. WE CANNOT BE COMING LATE TO CHURCH. &gt;&gt; We have to MAKE A BETTER EFFORT. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE TO TREAT THE THINGS OF GOD AS SACRED. &gt;&gt; You're supposed to read A BIBLE AND PRAY EVERY DAY. PEOPLE HAVE ALL KIND OF MYSTERY AND THEY CAN READ THEIR BIBLE AND PRAY EVERY DAY. &gt;&gt; But I say this simple. Why don't speak about the woman and the son and the mystery and the first war and the second war and the third war are dealing with some of the ABC stuff? Because some of you at ABC level, we'll get to the third war and the second war and the first war and the first vial and the seventh vial and the seventh trumpet and the feast OF THE TRUMPETS. WE CAN GET TO THOSE THINGS. BUT THE SIMPLE THINGS, YOU HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THIS GOSPEL COME TO BRING US INTO A CONDITION THAT GOD COULD SAY THERE IS MY SPIRIT FLOWING FREELY. YOU HAVE TO FORGIVE. YOU HAVE TO DROP YOUR ALT. YOU HAVE TO BE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. YOU HAVE TO HAVE WANT TO BE HOLY. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; GOD SAID, "WALK BEFORE ME AND BE THEREFORE PERFECT." [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Anybody in the house this morning? &gt;&gt; Do not reject this invitation. &gt;&gt; An invitation to present your body is a living sacrifice. &gt;&gt; God don't want no dead sacrifice. Your body is a living sacrifice. &gt;&gt; As a living sacrifice, it means your daily life is a sacrifice. I want you to think about it. I want you to compare living sacrifice versus the way sacrifices were done. They had to find a lamb without blemish. &gt;&gt; You couldn't come and say this is one without blemish. The lamb had to be inspected. [applause] &gt;&gt; So in other words, an audit had to take place. You say this lamb is without blemish. Let me check to see if it is without blemish. And the priest would check &gt;&gt; and make sure. And once he's convinced this is without blemish, he could kill this &gt;&gt; and you had to put your hand because as the life of this lamb left, THIS LAMB WAS DYING IN YOUR PLACE. AND HE HAD TO feel it so he could understand THE IMPACT OF WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE. This was not just someone to witness, it was something to experience. Are we together? So when you feel the life leave the body and you recognize wait a minute that should have been me &gt;&gt; my sins because many of us I was saying to my daughter at home 6 years old the fear of God &gt;&gt; is the beginning of wisdom &gt;&gt; if you don't fear God you could never operate a certain kind of way if you don't have the fear OF GOD THAT'S THE PROBLEM &gt;&gt; PEOPLE DON'T FEAR GOD. [applause] &gt;&gt; I heard something recently &gt;&gt; to go to the president's house. Do you know your car go with I know is spaghetti straps all your know what your cargo with your with your hand exposed &gt;&gt; your car enter a courtroom. Correct me if I'm right. We have people who are officers of the law. You can't walk into a courtroom in a miniskuit &gt;&gt; or what else &gt;&gt; or your shirt out your pants. You can't enter the courtroom. It's called contempt of court. They could throw you in jail for that. &gt;&gt; They are fine for that. &gt;&gt; So people who does misbehave, it is interesting how they behave when they have to go to court because they fear the consequence of the law because the law would say you had TO FIX THAT. GO AND change and come back. Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; BUT PEOPLE WANT TO BE UPSET IN THE HOUSE OF GOD WHEN WE WANT TO SAY, "LISTEN, this is God's." &gt;&gt; WHICH JUDGE ON EARTH COULD COMPARE TO THE JUDGE OF THE WORLD. [applause] &gt;&gt; SO DON'T GO DON'T GET VEXED WITH ME. WE ARE OFFICERS OF THE COURT. &gt;&gt; WELL, you don't hear me this morning. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU REACH A NATURAL COURT, THERE'S AN OFFICER OF THE COURT WHO IS CHECKING YOUR ENTRANCE. YOU GO THROUGH A SCANNER TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE NO WEAPONS. THEY'LL LOOK at you and say, "Okay, you're fit to go in." &gt;&gt; That's what the deacons are. They are officers in the court. &gt;&gt; So when they speak to you, don't get offended because if you go to a natural court, where you going to do a vex with you, &gt;&gt; you understand how people's thinking. &gt;&gt; But I'm praying by the grace of God, once a egg, once a chicken break out the egg, you can't pay it back. &gt;&gt; So once your mind get expanded to recognize the holiness of God &gt;&gt; because when Isaiah came into the presence of God, he recognized, wait a minute, I'm a unclean man. I'm a man of unclean. WAS A PROPHET BECAUSE THE CLOSER HE CAME TO GOD he recognized in presence things he didn't see about himself he start to notice and that's why when he comes to the house of God things we didn't see about ourselves WE THINK WE ARE RIGHT BUT then we start to notice wait a minute &gt;&gt; it's a what is a grudge &gt;&gt; it's a issue it's a it's a dark spot in my life HE SAY TAKE THE CALLS CLEANSE MY LIPS I I'm a man of unclean LIPS THERE ARE THINGS I'M SAYING I SHOULDN'T SAY I DIDN'T NOTICE BEFORE BUT I CAME TO THE HOUSE OF GOD AND IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD I REALIZED THINGS ABOUT MYSELF THAT NEED TO CHANGE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT JUST YOU. THAT'S ALL OF US. [screaming] IF A PROPHET, THE SAME PROPHET THAT WOULD SAY A VIRGIN WOULD conceive &gt;&gt; would say, "I'm a man of unclean lips. &gt;&gt; Take the clothes, &gt;&gt; cleanse my lips, &gt;&gt; here I am. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm not a prophet. &gt;&gt; But if a prophet in the presence of God could realize &gt;&gt; I shouldn't be talking." You know, &gt;&gt; we read the scripture. The same tongue &gt;&gt; that could bless and pray is the same tongue that could curse. &gt;&gt; The same tongue is a small member but it is a powerful one. The Bible say a small rudder off a ship move a whole ship &gt;&gt; and our words destroy our homes, &gt;&gt; DESTROY FAMILIES, CUT OFF THE BLESSING OF God &gt;&gt; because we don't understand that by the words we speak, LIFE AND DEATH IS in the power of your tongue. &gt;&gt; Don't you know the Bible say every word, EVERY IDLE WORD SPOKEN, the Bible said you have to give account for it. &gt;&gt; What will the excuse be? &gt;&gt; Well, I didn't really mean it. For the God who knows the thoughts and intents of the heart. &gt;&gt; For the God who say he who lookketh at a woman &gt;&gt; to lust hath already committed adultery in his heart. &gt;&gt; That the desire and INTENT OF THE HEART, &gt;&gt; HE RATES THAT AS THE ACT ITSELF, NOT THE ACT. &gt;&gt; THE GRAVITY AND SERIOUSNESS OF WHO GOD IS. THAT'S WHY THE FEAR OF THE LORD IS THE BEGINNING, not the ending, the beginning of wisdom. BECAUSE WHEN YOU FEAR GOD, YOU FEAR his instruments, his institutes, his laws, his people, even the pew, the person next to you, cuz you don't know who they are. &gt;&gt; Be very careful what you say. But said, if you have nothing good to say, &gt;&gt; don't say nothing. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to help you today, you know. If you have nothing, in other words, but I want to say say something nice. &gt;&gt; But the need to say it many times, accentuate &gt;&gt; the positive, &gt;&gt; eliminate the negative, and don't mess with me in between. &gt;&gt; How are you accentuating the positive? &gt;&gt; This is a weing to the end of the year, not the end of the service. I know I was going to say end of the service. We're not there yet. &gt;&gt; By the end of the year, you have to purpose in your heart to leave some things in 2025. &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible say forgetting the things that are past. &gt;&gt; Some of us dragging it reach dragging you know because it don't no heavy no light burden. You're dragging all kind of issues with you. &gt;&gt; And God say just cast all your cares upon me. &gt;&gt; Just throw it. Just throw it. &gt;&gt; Just just throw it. HE SAID FOR MY YOKE IS EASY, MY BURDEN IS LIGHT. YOU CARRY ALL KIND OF ISSUE, YOUR WIFE, YOUR CHILDREN, how it used to be, YOUR THIS AND ALL KIND OF STUFF UPON YOU AND YOU THEY'RE HEAVY. &gt;&gt; He said, "Come all ye who are heavy laden &gt;&gt; and I will GIVE YOU REST." IS THERE ANYBODY looking for rest? [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; I don't know why I'm saying all this this morning. Many people complain of tiredness, but it's not physical tiredness. Oh, come on now. &gt;&gt; It's not your tiredness because of just a lack of sleep, but your heart heavy, &gt;&gt; your spirit heavy, &gt;&gt; your mind heavy, heavy with guilt and shame and all kind of issues that you should have dropped a long time ago. This is a service to drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it. [applause] &gt;&gt; There are some issues it may not even be worth addressing. Just drop it. Forgive us our trespasses &gt;&gt; as we forgive those &gt;&gt; who trespass against us. &gt;&gt; In this journey and in this age we live in where the virtue of the age is brotherly kindness. If there's any test we all have to deal with is situation that challenge this virtue of forgiveness. &gt;&gt; And it's one thing whether George to preach about it. It's a whole another thing to deal with it, you know, &gt;&gt; because then you realize situation come and you're not ready. &gt;&gt; You realize you thought you was ready. &gt;&gt; And this is why I say only under crisis and situations you already know what stuff you're made of. Because when everything is good, you you you good enough. &gt;&gt; But if things go bad, &gt;&gt; then you really realize who you really are. &gt;&gt; Put somebody in a situation where they under pressure. We preach about Peter. Peter thought he was good. He say me deny Christ &gt;&gt; and I serve as a deacon, elder, usher, a minister. But when they say Jesus did, they just take him to kill him. Just so you know. Weren't you in the service? &gt;&gt; Is kill you. Say no. You you say take to kill him? &gt;&gt; Me in the service. &gt;&gt; Which service? &gt;&gt; And Peter start to deny once, deny twice. And when he recognized because at that point, what gripped him? Fear. &gt;&gt; Fear take him. &gt;&gt; At that point, he forget all the miracles. &gt;&gt; At the at that time, he forget he walking water and all. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. All he see now is is take they take Jesus. You know &gt;&gt; if they if they could take him. What about me? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Do you know there's a squeeze coming? &gt;&gt; I wonder how many really appreciate brother Clarence. Do you understand that the prophet talk about the world council of churches coming together &gt;&gt; and that the bride will be a hunted All you just had to do push-ups and running and and sprinting and &gt;&gt; hunted persecuted group for your testimony. You know, &gt;&gt; do you believe God sent a prophet? What will you say? &gt;&gt; Well, I mean, I was there. I I used to go. I mean how much I believe is like there were other people like brother Terry. This is why in the criminal world you people start to just snitch on others. No the believers go checks don't come to my house. &gt;&gt; You're looking for the ones who really really believe. &gt;&gt; No I want to bring a level of reality to you &gt;&gt; because this is the kind of pressure because in your schools some say well let me go and lime now. And some of us not strong enough to say I do not lime. What do you mean lime? You mean like lime juice? &gt;&gt; I do not go to parties. I do not GO TO THESE THINGS. WHY? Because I believe SOMETHING DIFFERENT. YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO EXPLAIN certain things to some people. &gt;&gt; But some OF US HAVE NO BACKBONE. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Let me go to a party. You there like an improper fraction. You cannot fit in." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Everybody know you're not there. YOU YOU NOT THERE. YOU CANNOT FIT IN. WHAT YOU DOING THERE? &gt;&gt; I said before you a big eagle. I see a chicken around you. You must stand out. The camera on you. &gt;&gt; You don't even dance in church. You're trying to dance in the people thing. I'm not trying to be funny. I want to call out something to know there are people in this world who stand up for what they believe. What do you believe? &gt;&gt; What are YOU STANDING FOR? WHY IS IT A PROBLEM FOR YOU TO COVER YOUR KNEES AND TO come to church and to live right and to say, "I don't drink. I don't smoke. I don't GO TO PARTIES." THAT IS NOT MY THAT'S NOT WHO I AM. &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE IN FORGIVENESS AND HOLINESS AND PURITY and the message of the hour AND LIVING A SANCTIFIED LIFE. &gt;&gt; I'M WAITING TO GET MARRIED TO HAVE SEXUAL INTERCOURSE. THAT IS THE REALITY OF YOUR STATEMENT. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT playing games. [applause and cheering] There are things we didn't know when we were in primary school. Now the six, seven, eight year olds being taught two mothers, two fathers, this all kind of stuff. &gt;&gt; The devil not taking prisoners. You know, &gt;&gt; he taught to rob, steal and destroy. THAT'S WHY THE DEVIL KNOWS THAT TIME IS short &gt;&gt; and he IS TAKING THIS SHORT TIME TO PUT AS MUCH PRESSURE AS HE CAN. WHAT ABOUT THE BRIDE of Jesus Christ? We have an invitation [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; to make a church that will make a revival. &gt;&gt; Let me shake you parents. The things you think your children don't know, trust me, &gt;&gt; they know that and 10 times more. &gt;&gt; Don't be fooled. Amen. the two three hours on Sunday in church and maybe God help you if you don't make it out on Wednesday night and you don't properly bring your house in order and say listen we we in church on the stream at least &gt;&gt; shame on you parents if you're not even enforcing that in your home what you expect to happen if you're not doing it &gt;&gt; who's supposed to do it I'm not in your home I have no information about your home I'm just dealing with the issues &gt;&gt; because the point I'm presenting to you is for hours per by hours every single Today they are being confronted by information from teachers from school friends from all kind. I remember coming home from school and I'm not young and my mom and dad say whatever sir tell you day take it back or know because as a young child my own daughter arguing with me about a word you said miss put it on the board. So I say well miss put it wrong you say but miss is right. I say miss is not right. In her world she is seeing miss as right. It was a mistake on the board. and we going through a debate and I'm watching this six-year-old is convinced that Mrs. Right. And I could imagine how children could have a context of what they're hearing if you don't present to them what you should and take the responsibility to teach them the things of God because the word said tell this to your children and your children children so that THEY WILL KNOW WHAT GOD TOOK US FROM. PUT THE 12 STONES THERE AS A MEMORIAL AND TELL THIS TO YOUR CHILDREN AND TO YOUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN. BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T TELL THEM ABOUT THE PROPHET, WHO WILL? IF YOU DON'T TELL THEM ABOUT BEING HOLY, WHO WILL? THEY WILL NOT DO IT IN THE SCHOOL. THEY WILL NOT DO IT AMONG THE FAMILY. WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO TELL THEM ABOUT THE GOSPEL. &gt;&gt; WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IS IT? [applause and cheering] I don't know how I end up there. &gt;&gt; The pastor say keep on going. &gt;&gt; Whose responsibility is it? &gt;&gt; Is that the the PTA meeting and the parents say where the teacher is not doing enough? What you doing at home with your child? What environment you create for them to succeed? It's not rocket science. You know whatever effort you put the Bible say to all labor there is reward. You know your child not doing no work at home. What do you expect to happen? Blame the teacher. &gt;&gt; Soon is play play and not in nobody home. But if you DON'T CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT FOR THEM TO LEARN. &gt;&gt; NO. But you you on the phone for 3 hours &gt;&gt; and YouTube is now the babysitter and not in nobody home &gt;&gt; and then the child presents. I wonder where they get that from. Well, you wasn't teaching them. &gt;&gt; We dealing with responsibility. &gt;&gt; We're dealing with excuses because it's very easy to blame. Well, the Sunday school not doing enough and the teachers not doing enough and the pastor preaching hard enough. How hard they want me to preach. But the Bible say you can preach it, they blew in the face. Unless people want to respond to the word, they will do nothing about it. &gt;&gt; We could preach forgiveness over and over. Unless you want to do something about you, you will hold THE OUGHT TO YOURSELF. I CANNOT TAKE THE ART OUT OF YOUR HEART. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Forgive me if this is too simple THIS MORNING, BUT WE'RE DEALING WITH YOUR HOME. BECAUSE BEFORE THERE WAS CHURCH, THERE WAS FAMILY. &gt;&gt; BEFORE THERE WAS CHURCH, THERE WAS HOME. [screaming] &gt;&gt; AND ADAM AND EVE HAD issues &gt;&gt; that led to all that we're dealing with today. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? So from that scripture you read &gt;&gt; I have all kind of notes you know but I just sharing with you this morning back to St. Luke 14 verse 21. So that servant came and showed his lord these things. In other words these are all the excuses. Then the master of the house being angry &gt;&gt; said to his servant, "Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bringing hither the poor and the mamed and the halt and the blind." And the servant said, "Lord, it is done as thou has commanded, and yet there is room." In other words, the servant had no excuse. He did what he was commanded. And the Lord said unto the servant, "Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in." In other words, force them to come in that my house may be filled. &gt;&gt; For I say unto you, and this is God's statement, that none of these men &gt;&gt; which were bidden shall taste of my supper. &gt;&gt; Church, if you reject this thing, &gt;&gt; that's on you. You know, God is saying the invitation is up to you to respond. If you want to keep making excuses, that's on you. Let's jump to Matthew chapter 22. verse one and this is Jesus giving another par parable along a similar vein but touching some different things in this first one there were excuses in both we talking about do not reject his invitation and both their invitations Matthew 22:1 and Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables and said the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king so he's being very clear here This is the kingdom of heaven. He's addressing is like unto a certain king which made a marriage for his son. I want us to see the parallels here. Right? &gt;&gt; And send forth his servants to call them that were bidden which meant like in the scripture we read in Luke, invitations were sent out. Send forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding. And listen to it, they would not come. So this parable that we are seeing here is God speaking in both scenarios of him inviting and people either giving excuses or simply saying I'm not coming. &gt;&gt; How much time we invite people to church and they say I'm not coming. Where's the excuse? I feeling good. I hear this. I hear this and all kind of stuff. This is God addressing that here. Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Again in verse four, he sent forth other servants. SO THIS IS GOD in his grace and mercy sending more to the same people. I want us to catch this TO SHOW THAT GOD IS NOT EVEN TRYING TO GIVE UP ON PEOPLE. He sends servants in verse three and people say I'm NOT COMING. SO GOD say you know what let me send a DIFFERENT GROUP. MAYBE MAYBE JUST MAYBE THEY CAN'T receive brother Isaac. &gt;&gt; Let me send brother Anthony. Let me send brother Steven. Let me SEND SOMEBODY ELSE BECAUSE at the end of the day whatever means needs to happen let me get them. &gt;&gt; Are we getting this? Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why such a grace go brother Joy we could have ministers come and minister to in the church because maybe I'm the PROBLEM &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD SENT SERVANTS TO GET THEM AND SAY I'M NOT COMING. So verse four AGAIN HE SENT FORTH OTHER servants &gt;&gt; saying tell them which are bidden behold I have prepared my dinner &gt;&gt; my oxen and my fatlings are killed &gt;&gt; and all things are ready. &gt;&gt; Come unto the marriage. You know what it is to have a wedding and nobody showing up? The fact that the Lord Jesus himself would take two parables to bring similar teaching shows us how important this thing is to him. &gt;&gt; Behold, the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife had made herself ready. Speaking about a wedding supper and a feast to come. God is interested in in in his people being there. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Verse five. But they made light of it. They made light of it. Oh, is the next service? Is a special service. Well, I already think I need to go to this is a special meeting. You know what special meetings we had? &gt;&gt; Make light of it. Make light of something is when something is important but you devalue it. By the grace of God, I'm hoping, praying, trusting that these words would find good ground. &gt;&gt; Not just to those here, but those online, those who would come this weekend, because we have made too light of the things of God. &gt;&gt; Don't we have enough sick people in our midst to not make light of this thing? &gt;&gt; Don't we have enough real situations to not make light of it? &gt;&gt; Here's the invitation from the Lord. And people make light. They casual. Well, you will see me when you see me. But they made light of it and went their ways, one to his farm and other to his merchandise. Again, showing what is priority. &gt;&gt; And the remnant. So look how bad this is. Some say I am coming. I going to my farm. I going and do my business. I going to work. I doing whatever it is. And the remnant, those that didn't have things to do, the remnant took his servants and intreated them spitefully and slew them. &gt;&gt; Brother George, they come to invite them and they kill them &gt;&gt; for bringing the invitation. &gt;&gt; Imagine I come to your house to invite you to a wedding &gt;&gt; and your response is to kill me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you understand this? &gt;&gt; So somebody come and invite you to the house of God. Somebody saying come get out your condition. I know you're struggling but still come. Praise God. And the response here was to kill them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when the king heard thereof he was wroth. In a similar fashion in the first chapter we read he was also angry. You wrote me angry. And he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burnt up their cities. Then said he to his servants, "The wedding is ready." But they which were bidden were not worthy. How were they not worthy? Because they didn't put priority to the invitation. &gt;&gt; Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as he shall find bid to the marriage. You see the parallel with the first one we read. So those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good. And the wedding was furnished with guests. And when they came, king came in to see the guests. And here's the type of the Holy Ghost being spoken of here. He saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment. &gt;&gt; And he saith unto him, friend, [clears throat] how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? and he was speechless. Then said the king to the servants, "Bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast him into outer darkness. There shall be weeping and nashing of teeth. &gt;&gt; For many are called, but few are chosen." Amen. &gt;&gt; So I hope this connects with our hearts this morning that God is very serious not just about his invitation but there are consequences to the rejection of the invitation. It's one thing to be invited and is a one thing to give excuse and give excuse to the point that you kill the man who giving you the invitation. But in both scenarios God said in the first one not one of these men will eat in my supper and in the second one he killed them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. because they rejected the invitation. &gt;&gt; Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; I'm getting ready to wind down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But the Brandham said here in the message, is your life worthy of the gospel? &gt;&gt; But the B said man has always tried to make excuses not to receive God's word of his invitation. Man is constantly making excuses. Now, we see when God gives a man an invitation to do something or to receive the invitation that he's given him and he returns it down, there's nothing left after mercy is spurned but judgment. If you step over the boundaries of mercy, then there's only one thing left and that is judgment. And we have preached this many time when we preach on do not cross the line. Remember the Brandham said there'll come a time when young people will be praying at the altar asking for mercy, but they've already crossed the line. No more mercy for them. And as a young believer that that troubled me because I could not understand at the time how there could be a point where people praying at the altar and no more mercy for them. &gt;&gt; And this is why the Bible said seek the Lord while he may be found. Call upon him while he is there. And but Abraham said there's no excuse. If you're not baptized, get baptized. If you do not have the Holy Ghost, get the Holy Ghost because there's no excuse. You have to take action and you have to respond quickly because the invitation is open. And there's coming a time when aviation will be closed. And once these seats are filled, it's it's over. And if you didn't come in the right way and get a wedding and garment, WHICH IS THE HOLY GHOST, YOU CAN'T COME BACK IN. BECAUSE IF YOU FIND YOU IN THERE WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST, HE WILL SAY, "HOW DID YOU COME IN HERE, FRIEND?" &gt;&gt; But goes on, when God sent Noah servant and made a way of escape for all the people who wanted to be saved, but the people only laughed and scorned at Noah. But God made the way. But they had an excuse. It wasn't according to their modern thinking. It wasn't the way they wanted it. So they made excuse in the days of Noah. Brother goes on. They made excuses in the days of Moses. They made excuses in the days of Elijah. They made excuses IN THE DAYS OF CHRIST. AND THEY make excuses today. &gt;&gt; It's no different. &gt;&gt; We are very good at making excuses. I've done too much mistakes. God don't want to hear that. There's mercy for you. &gt;&gt; There's mercy for you. God not even getting the excuse of your failures. God not accepting that excuse either. The mercy is open. &gt;&gt; The opportunity is open. If you are backslided today, there's mercy for you today. &gt;&gt; God could not take in any excuse. &gt;&gt; We make excuses. I've never done this before. I don't have the right tools. This person stumbled me. So, somebody stumbled you. So, that's your your excuse. This person did it. This person did that. I didn't have the time. How is that an excuse? I don't have the time. I have work commitments. I don't talk to that person. That is your excuse. I'm not qualified. I don't have the experience. I don't have the education. My family doesn't support me. I'm the ONLY ONE HERE. FOR EVERY PERSON WHO HAS THAT TO SAY, GOD IS SAYING, "I'm not here any say." &gt;&gt; When God is ready for Moses, Moses say, "I can't talk. I don't have the experience. I don't have what it takes." &gt;&gt; God say, "You have anything else? You have any more excuses?" Because you still going &gt;&gt; AFTER ALL EXCUSES. YOU ARE STILL THE ONE. GOD IS NOT LOOKING TO REPLACE ANYBODY. SO, FORGET THE EXCUSES AND GET INTO ACTION. Get desperate. IT MIGHT SOUND LEGITIMATE, BUT THE EXCUSES DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE DELIVERED. &gt;&gt; YOUR EXCUSE IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE HOLY GHOST. YOUR EXCUSE IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE FACT THAT YOUR NAME IS WRITTEN ON THE BOOK. YOUR EXCUSE IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ADOPTED. YOU'RE GOING TO BE PERFECTED. YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE HONED AND SHAPED INTO THE STATUE OF A PERFECT MAN. YOUR SINS, YOUR FAILURES, YOUR PAST. THAT IS NO EXCUSE. &gt;&gt; TODAY IS the beginning of the rest OF YOUR LIFE. TODAY YOU COULD TURN AROUND, SHIFT YOUR PERSPECTIVE, AND SAY, "AS FOR ME, AND MY HOUSE, WE WILL serve the Lord." &gt;&gt; Today is THE DAY OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF YOUR LIFE. CAN THE CHURCH SAY, "AMEN." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Don't make any more excuses. Let today be the final day. Let today be the day that you change and you transform and you put everything behind you and say, "Lord, as for me and my house, I'm ready to give it all up. &gt;&gt; But we will serve you with everything." &gt;&gt; Young people, if you have never made a decision to serve God with your all, don't you leave their service today with another excuse. But Brandham said, "IF YOU'RE NOT BAPTIZED, DON'T make another excuse. Come to the water and to be baptized. IF YOU HAVE NEVER SOLD OUT OF GOD BEFORE, don't have another excuse. If you have an ought, drop it today. No excuses. If you have to MAKE SOMETHING RIGHT, DROP it today. No excuses. You need to be prayed for at the altar, forget everything else. We'll pray for you. No excuses. But we are leaving here with a clean slate. We are leaving here that God himself have to look down and say, "I saw you took a response." The musician, get ready. &gt;&gt; I'm about to close out. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But man said the rich man had an excuse. &gt;&gt; He was too weighed down with too many friends. Some of us our friends are our excuse. Some of us family is our excuse. this person said this, this person did that, this person. But when you look at it at the end of the day, you have no reason to not be further in your spiritual walk. &gt;&gt; We say we don't have time, but when you look, you're really spending your time doing things you shouldn't be doing. &gt;&gt; So, we are here to kill the excuses this morning &gt;&gt; so you could accept the invitation &gt;&gt; to come to the altar to make things right and to leave knowing that you have cast your cares on the altar. Come ye who are heavy laden and I will give you rest. &gt;&gt; The Bible said I stand at the door and knock. &gt;&gt; God not pushing down your door. &gt;&gt; He not forcing his way into your home in their life. He said I stand at the door and knock and if any man open up I will come in. &gt;&gt; And that's how I feel this morning as we prepare to wrap up this service. Don't have any excuse friends. Forget who's next to you. Forget your past. Forget your failures. Forget your mistakes. Forget everything. And just throw it aside and say, "Lord, it's just you and me this morning." You can begin to play something softly. When God went to Gideon in the Bible, Gideon presented all the reasons He said, "My tribe is the smallest tribe. My family is the smallest family, and I'm the smallest one in my family. It can't be me you're talking to." He had his list of excuses. You might be here this morning and say, "But I haven't been in church for a long time." Or, "You don't even know the struggles that I've been going through, and you don't even know the problems that I have." I invite you this morning to throw those things out. [music] God isn't looking at you from your yesterday, your last month, your last year, your last 5 years, every head bowed, every eye closed. God isn't interested in your yesterday. God has only one interest. what he says about you. What the word says about you, husband, wife, mother, father, child, daughter, whatever this morning, I invite you to drop it. Drop the issue. Drop the issue. this morning. Forgive your husband. Forgive your wife. Forgive your children. Forgive your parents. Forgive your coworker. Forgive the neighbor. No excuse. You hinder your own prayer when you don't drop it. Forgive the person who wronged you. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Forgive yourself. Many times we reach a point where we could forgive others and we don't even forgive our own selves. You have to forgive yourself too [music] so that God could begin to move. Every head bowed, every eye closed. I'm not going to force anything. [music] But we will give the opportunity this morning. If you want us to pray for you and you really mean business with God, this is not if [music] you're just feeling to get prayed for, but you really want your life to be transformed and you know you've been holding on to stuff, dealing with stuff, whatever [music] it is, and you want us to pray for you, then we'll do that. Maybe there's one person, maybe there's two people, I don't know, but we'll open [music] the altar briefly at this time. We'll pray for you if you want to. There's one. Is there anyone else? Whatever your need is this morning, he is here. [music] We're not making excuses anymore. We're not making excuses. We want to live a holy life. We want to live a pure life. We want to live a true life. Heavenly Father, Lord, we have sons and daughters coming up to the altar. Lord, we pray for your daughter. Lord, you know her need. You know her cry. Whatever it is, Father, you know it more than I ever could. Father, Lord, may you touch your daughter even now, Lord.

Looking for a change, looking for a transformation, looking for a rustle in the malberry tree. Father, Lord, we are Lord dealing with different ones. Father, Lord, you know the need.
