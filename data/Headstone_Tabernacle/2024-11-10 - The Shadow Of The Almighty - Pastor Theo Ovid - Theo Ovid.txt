so we are grateful to God to be here this morning blessing and for me it's always a privilege to be in the house of God I never say that enough to know that we wouldn't always have this so we are grateful and thankful to be the land of the living that we could give God praise that's why we are here in the land of the living to give God praise the land of the living you give out thanks this is the place that you could give God and be grateful to God and be thankful to God you know in the prayer meeting on on Saturday on on Friday talking about the child just accept it be like a little child wise and Kingdom of God now a child is transparent child is humble child is Forgiven a child let things go child hold any ODS or grudges they have that freedom and liberty and even though we are adults we have to be like children that that's what he come to do turn the heart of the children back to the FI of the P so praise God so we are grateful to God we're looking to see what the Lord will do this morning and you know and Prejudice and false judgment that come in adults children do have that you put black children white children red children yellow children they'll play together as children children do what children do isn't that right but then when the adults they have all kind of issues in their mind and heart and that affect them but this is what God don't want that is why Jesus the parable of the wedding and get the Garment at the door everybody look the same Rich poor whatever it is you dress in the same garment that you could have Fellowship my s in Africa was there and in a wedding everybody had the same cloth and I said well I could even storm that wedding because I don't have the cloth I didn't get the revelation of the cloth to buy it was an astonishing thing to see it in real to hear it you know it's an Eastern custom so what they do they send out the material and everybody come invited to the wedding get the material of the cloth to dress everybody look the same way any smart man smart woman trying to slip in there they get exposed you don't have the key to what is being unfold and so it is that God want us to be dressed with humility dressed with grace to know is the grace of God to all Li many people you know wish they had this wish this but they don't praise the Lord amen blessed be the name of the Lord so where do we go this morning let me just before I I just want to read from understand do not uh we read part of this last week Luke 21 I read from verse 25 and there shall be signs in the sun and the moon and the stars upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring men Hearts failing them for fear for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and just as I was coming to service I saw piece of the news or terrible snowstorm a worst snowstorm hitting some part of America in decades they didn't have anything like that it's just things are just piling up one after each other and because it's not all in one it doesn't look that way but actually is God's judgment begin to distract the Earth men has feeling for fear for looking for those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then they shall see the son of man coming in a cloud with great power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass then look up lift up your heads for a Redemption draw it n so Saints we supposed to be in a condition that we could be looking up to God because you and I can't change anything that going to be happening on the world's fear we could change things around us as we create an atmosphere to receive and hear from God all these years God was just helping us along to get in the at said I could really hear from God because we have to come to a place where we have to lay in God's presence and stay in God presence and this is what this service is about this morning praise the name of the Lord

in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty that's my title this morning the shadow of the Almighty I will serve the Lord he's my refuge my Fortress my God in him will I trust surely he shall deliver thee from the SN of the fower and from the noisome pestilence he shall cover thee thisen with his feathers and under his wings shall thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler Psalms 24:3 and 4 who shall Ascend into the hill of the Lord this is the first time I learned by heart got to speak it out from one straight down who shall Ascend into the hill of the Lord and who shall stand in his holy place he that had Clean Hands and a pure heart who had not lifted up his soul unto vanity nor sworn deceitfully St John 15:7 if he abide in me I mind words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you let us pray father we thank you for your word and I pray that you would come down in a special way and speak to us we need to hear from you we not here for a lecture we not here for information we here to hear from heaven and to receive Revelation and inspiration to our lives we not here to just see each other or see what we wearing on this clothing but we're here to hear from Heaven speak to us Lord forgive us our past bless our future bless us even now circumcise our heart to hear the word circumcise my lips to speak your word granted God in Jesus name I ask it amen you may be seated oh praise God so the devil is kicking up a fuss all over the world he has to because the bride is coming forth and as you step forward more things going to happen it's not because of the devil it's because of you oh praise the name of the Lord Revelation 23 just as we get warm up here I Know Thy Works thy labor thy patience how that cannot be doubt that which are evil that was tried them which say the apostles that are not how beautiful the Savior praises and commment oh let me finish reading triy them which say the apostles are not and has found them liars and has born talking about the Believers and has patience and for my name's sake has labored and here this part and has not fainted I like that part there are too many people easy to faint don't faint because of what you're facing deal with it confront it you can't defeat Goliath if confront golad you have to confront your sickness your whatever issues in your mind whatever trial whatever testing confront it don't go and duck and hide and cover and cry and long tears that helping Faith helps not your tears do you get what I'm saying praise the name of the Lord how beautiful and the Savior praises and commends his children he takes into account their fine spiritual attitudes and behavior he knows that there is weakness among them as but as yet he does not cry out against it isn't is not just like our Lord he knows how to encourage Us in the right matters and discourage Us in the wrong matters we should all learn a good lesson right here in running the church and our families and better still we could all learn a good lesson in that God deals with each one of us exactly this way don't ever be discouraged saint of God did you hear that you in discouraging sat here this morning I give a word here for you don't ever be discouraged saint of God for God is not ungracious to to forget your labors of Love whatever we do even giving a cup of cold water to someone has a reward and blessing from the Lord I Know Thy Works labor and patience as he walks in the midst of his church he's aware of the suffering his people and he cares and it was in the days of captivity in Egypt when he he the cries he who never changes still hears the cries of the oppressed as he walks among them the very word labor signifies a a weariness through oppression God's people do not only work for him in labor of love but they suffer for him with joy there's a paradox suffering him with joy people don't want that suffer with him with joy but you suffer with him with joy and you know always preach how do we show our love to God by conducting ourselves with joy amidst the trials he in his wisdom sent our way that when they come in big man and big woman big Christian then when they can face a trial and up on the phone on on on new phone you're complaining you're complaining you're complaining you're complaining and complaining only weakens your faith you're telling Tom Dick Harry everybody else instead of saying Thank You Lord hallelujah you're going to work things out I trust you and like a child you promise a child a sweetie a a chocolate or what that they believe you and you better bring that chocolate when you come you know because you hear a whole lot of crying about it so that is the same Simplicity in which God want you to release your faith and trust him because if ever there was a time you had to trust God is coming down to this time here now if you feel you burn out that drama about to start so get Bly if there ever a time you need to trust God is the time that's coming out you see the Bank Lower how much us could buy everybody think from us next just don't go be food don't say Amen now is a belly we talking about now some people serious about that very very serious do you what I'm saying it's it's it's a nice time coming on you know a trying time coming on you know and you have to have a triumphant Faith listen a triumphant fith to deal with what is coming on so don't back down now hallelujah praise God so listen to this now he says now the the uh they are patient in being the Yoke this first AE suffered Grace persecution you had to work hard to preach the gospel shed forth truth the the high calling in life was to serve God and when their hopes in life were blighted they were patient and committed all to him there's not you fighting and wrestling with God you see you you commit things to him and you expect you want this to work out but it doesn't work out so praise God God knows best so you commit everything to the hands of God you you you want this you want that and what not that's why we talk about seeking first the kingdom put your heart on the spiritual things and natural things would follow you and you could take that seek first the kingdom and tie that in with Psalms 1 blessed a man who walked not under the counil of The Godly stands in the way of Sinners nor sit in the seat of the scornful but his Delight in what in the law of the Lord and in his law that he meditate when Sundays only Wednesday night when service about to start it didn't say that day and night how he shall be he shall be like what a tree planted where by rivers of water whatever he do going to prosper his leaves shall not wither so you have an assurance that if you take this and meditate in day and night no devil could come and trap you and then trap you whatever he do going to prosper your hands whatever you touch Oh Glory to God whatever your hand touch hallelujah praise God give the Lord a shout God is not a man that would lie if God say that he means that whatever he do going to prosper and you know where he plant in You by rivers of Living Water not God when I get water when we going un fall no he planted in the right place you a looking for rain to fall you planted in the right spot Oh Glory to God to draw and get strength to draw and get energy oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah this is exciting for me you know because since 17 years old I pumping and I still pumping and I'm just as strong as when I first started out so you rascal inside here 17 18 19 20 or whatever you can't tell me you're going to fight I fight in a long time I 66 years old in that in this fight right now and I'm still fighting Hallelujah I'm fighting right down praise God if I fight Down To My Grave I fight Down To My Grave by fighting right down I ain't let the devil get it easy oh give the Lord I shout if the devil had to fight with me and battle with me I'm not going to let him get easy Oh Glory to God hallelujah if I get strike with sickness I'm not giving up I get strike with this I'm not giving up I'm going to fight praise God give the Lord a shout you have to fight back don't be that devil like a pummeling and beating you up Jus say my joy This Joy I give you no man take from you if God give you Joy that's God's joy no husband no wife no children mother father brother taking away that Joy No husband could give you a joy that God could give you no wife can give you a joy that God can give you no money no job praise God the job will fade the money will fade but God is fading anywhere he remain the same yesterday today and forever huj listen to these words when their hopes and life were blighted they were patient and committed all to him who had promised a lasting recompense in heaven for what they have given up on the earth like this brother Michael mcmo simple guy committed he had patience that were going to shake job so and know was going to shake head I had nowhere close to half the patience he had he had almost too much when Serv supposed to Fast 5 he waiting to pick up people all six and bring them to service the bush up there when I come to the church I tell them I am not Michael MCM if you don't come to church I Ain picking you up find yourself in service some left about six remain we keep poing but the point about it he was a soul winner and he that win souls his wise I was up there in New York by uh by uh Church up there just and um Brothers was coming telling me how his brother M that bring them to the Lord this one bring them to the Lord that want bring to the Lord if you see them talking about how much BEC to the Lord I said but look at that his bank account in heaven he have plenty you have a load of reward up there you know he that winth soul is wise always testifying always witnessing man some experience or something else at that time going to pen Harris I know why I say that now and um you driving a bus to go to the meetings and so on AB will ask me to come behind your wheel and stay here because you running in the by the train station to wait on somebody he invite the service and I am there by the wheel frightened as a on a street that I don't know and I am there by the wheel policeman come up and say move there move so and I I am furious got time going 5 minutes 10 minutes 15 minutes and making a block me know where the block is left right wherever go and I'm in the stats afterwards here come Mark smiling that's that's how years smiling normal normal normal he said the man wasn't there income boy but Souls that was his thing patience that was his thing one onone that was his thing oh my my my my he was one of a kind my God bless this history and testimony and through him he had asked me to come and work with the Believers there because he was going back and forth to New York and come in Trinidad that's how end up going up there and then the rest is history maybe I may say more on Saturday a vision broke and things begin to unfold and God showed the we down here and this is where we at now by Vision but he started the work and um through him I even work with his company his father's company M Mayon Sons I did um qu of technician I to go and measure variations and job and different things measure walls and whatnot and construction and stuff like that and through him we get to be buddies and get to go KYW and so like that and you know you just see how you you need connections you need people there are some people live such selfish lives and you don't understand how you hindering your own self and the thing about it when you live for others and that's what how he lived it does benefit you so much your selfish Circle me my I and myself and us that Circle you're in right now it hindering you it is hindering you when you stretch and you go out of your way and I see different why could I I want to call Nam here do that have done that and they see God come back and bless them and when and I in our experience we have never helped others and didn't see help come back ourselves not that you're doing to help that to get back help you know but in helping others it just come automatically it just come back to you and God has double it triple it let just do something for you and we do things because we choose to we want to not because we're looking for anything in return and that's is how what I teach and I will teach you and I will share with you that's what I teach my children be intentional about your actions don't react do act show love show courtesy show respect sh humility not because I'm somebody uper te you're going to show them respect somebody low down you show no no no no you show respect to all the garbage man je over witness who keeping harassing at the gate and putting tracks inside your box your sure respects all their to all right so butam I'm going to close this yes he said the children of this world is controlled by the devil and they hate the children of God who are controlled by the spirit so no matter how just and upright a Christian is before public how gracious he is to his fellow man doing not but good let him confess Christ as his Savior and acknowledge the gifts of the holy spirit in tongues and prophecy and healing Miracles it will be condemned the spirit of this world hates the spirit of God because it can't overcome the spirit of the Lord it tries to destroy the vessel in whom the spirit of Truth dwells here we go it's just background we start preacher it persecution and trials are natural normal part of the Christian Life that sound like 30% say Amen natural normal that is supposed to be part of your journey persecution and trials hallelujah praise God praise God Amen talk about trust this man right here St on a bus bust up I have no money to go inside the bus because he going to service this man standing right there Michael Black when he bus stops say come I pay for you explain that this is not no joke you know this not we not cracking jokes this morning you know this is real testimony you know stand up by the bus stop with no money but going to church that what God seeing he want to go to church and somebody come in come in quickly I pay for you but people come to service they know they coming but they don't know how they're going back serious fa so listen to this persecution trials are natural normal part of the Christian Life there's only one thing you can do about them commit them all to God judge not and leave the outworking and final judgment to him praise be to Jesus I'm going to just skip all of that all right let's go we going to start now in the last days but no Jesus said you you say that against me it be forgiven you because they were Jews but otherwise in the last days when the Holy Ghost comes upon the Gentiles one word against it will never be forgiven in this world nor the world to come watch your mouth had a sister she no longer comes here she's about her lid from her mouth she she needed a a a metal cover for that mouth loose lips you see and one of the things that I was concerned about I find the Trinidad attitude and spirit is disrespectful and I was always concerned about the Judgment time that is about to come and things people say and how it will hit them back hard that why you say let your word go out with kindness sometime you have to eat it back I see people mash up the whole fames with their mouth with the tongue the things they say that's right this church here I protected you from so much things by not talking about this group and this church and this Minister all the tapes is there you it's open you know I'm not a whispering person I'm not whisper nobody ears sh no what you hear is what you hear we speak to you what we need to know I don't need to tell you about no banal and all you're fighting by you stand by your pastor I ever preached that before stand by your pastor no stand by the word if your pastor dead you have dead too makes no sense stand by the word I don't have nobody fighting for me not even my son or Sons we don't have that because each person have to walk by Revelation each person have to live by Revelation you have to stand on an individual not Family Blood ticket and water and the whole family whole family wrong you wrong too whole family going off you off with them too that your family your blood that your blood like Devils druming up inside there on your daughter on your son all them what blood you talking about blood how no blood in that is the

husband coming your children coming the spirit upon the bride will call them oh give the Lord I shout God is Sovereign his grace is Sovereign his power is sovereign [Applause] the word is in the church in the person that's why brother Kang man claim to be adopted have no manifestation he's a liar he's false a false claim some church figure they on top or the first and the infront and what not foolishness they do have no infront it have a farmer went forth to S some fell on the Tes some fall among we sides some fell among rocks some fell on good WR was one farmer it's one son of man it's one seed from the message and God sprinkle that all over the world and then in his appointed time the rain coming to fall on those seeds to manifest the seed so Baptist produced Baptist Methodist produced Methodist Pentecostal prod Pentecostal but the word will produce Sons God's born Sons filled Sons anointed Sons God have to something to differentiate us from the Pentecostal church is not the church building it's not open Bible and praying is the power and authority back in the church in the person they will want to know how you could preach and the power manifested and you don't even have to say in Jesus name because she will be Jesus name manifested she is wife of the lamb praise God praise God praise God praise God what did God tell the prophet with sayti right whatever she asks for Glory to God he this woman sving up she Titan coins poor lady coins coins and then B want to give her give her back the money and God said no because God know what going on down the road coins she SP and when he talk about this C she said that's nothing but the truth brother and she said that she said the right thing Holy Spirit drop down whatever you say going to happen to that woman she had a

you think I want to get to Tre Quant but on my way ready or not are going on the word is in the church and the person and that's why he says when it comes you wouldn't have to say anything about it it will speak speak for itself you have to prove nothing to your husband to your wife to your children it would speak for itself because listen he would let it be made known among men so in other words God will be able to identify you as his child remember the story about AB brandham with a plane he came to get something to eat and the Lord tell him keep walking he's following the lead in the spirit walk down through this colored area going down down down down and see a colored woman waiting outside waiting out there good morning person and he want to know how she know she's a person she said he

myself they go free they set on normal believers he said yes then Peter said why have you lighted the Holy Ghost is your money is your house you sell it that's your property we have no Li on it you

yes well you're going up with your husband both all going in the same place that's is the point of time she say no they not all we had rest of money home all so he dead and she alive she could get exb do you understand what I'm saying but she going along with him you know they I make it right all right let's go you are fine audience this morning I have 17 pages on page six you're going good all right now you talk about SE T smell the flesh the outer Court the inner courts we have the next altar I have conscience imagination memory passion affection five senses of the flesh which is the human the flesh the body then five senses of the spirit the inner court and so like that right we got three gates he said now that is where your per Holiness and Methodist stayed on the altar out there now watch lutherans go back and forth in the flesh here come P Holiness but that light ran out he's talking about pressing into the most holy Place let's go now remember there was a veil that hand between the holy and the holiest of holies in the holiest of holies is where Christ come to sit down on your heart's Throne Christ is enthroned he comes through justification sanctification by one spirit and here we all baptized into one body which is the body of Christ by what Holy Spirit who comes in Methodist Baptist pres Pentecost whosoever will that Veil you know what that Veil is listen that Veil veils your heart from it are you ready I'm still reading the veil is called self-will and that's why I say you have to be intentional about what you want to do and how you want to live it's not a matter of just doing it you have to be intentional here it is to break from your the second Court into the place that place where you're getting the shadow of the Almighty that hiding place to break into that hiding place is your own self-will you have to will to do God's will so that's why people love to put it on the pastor or the preacher or the priest because when they put it on that man they have nothing to do it's the priest he sprinkle he put He dust ashmen and so on he do all of that and you blame the priest but God saying is your will you have to want to be adopted not hope you have to want to be a better man that's what God told he said he said Samuel don't forget about Saul I found a better man you have to want to be a better woman a better mother a better father a better wife you will you don't want to be a baby maker there someone just put on baby just put on child put on child put on child them is baby mother they are not mothers you want to know you're raising your child unto God to do that you have to go beyond you if you're not ready for motherhood don't get married when you get married have a child you have to raise that child unto God some people raise the child and say of age you know I I not responsible no more they 18 never was Mother Mother they just happen to have a child and child get bigger and say you know I mean not my responsibility no more and for this call shall a man leave his mother and father and cling to that who is that some rougher who ra that who raised that we have to raise up Sons to be men courageous Men original men now they want to e feminize men want to make men Gish but God said let us make man in our image like us God is the original designated of that woman getting more pushy and forward s inside of here that manly spirit and that argumentative and that rudess and thing God make that you know as a perversion of the original you know Hallelujah the veil is called self-will do you get the picture now the senses out there the senses on the body the senses to the soul the veil between that and the holy place the holiest of holies is self-will so Paul said I bring my body into subjection least after I have preached I become a c so Paul arrested his desires I wonder if everybody hearing this this morning I find the amen getting lighter and lighter and lighter you know are coming home to you I coming to your house all right okay so watch notice when the high priest once a year entered into the first Veil the second Veil out of the lavers where they washed the sacrifice the sacrifice was killed I'm going to skip and then to the hems of His Garment he had pomegranate then a bell and he walked so perfect until the Bells say holy holy unto the Lord what we need today is not whether we are assemblies or Church of God or Oneness our walk ought to be plain to the public holy holy unto the Lord you're not acting because you come to headone Tabernacle you're acting because you love God and you believe the word and your walk is Holy Holy unto the Lord that's what your walk another thing he must be anointed before he goes in the anointing oil was made of the Rose of Sharon the crushing of the Rose brought forth the perfume and put it on the oil that run along aon's beard plumped Hem of His skirt covered up with the anointing oil walking right living right moving right dressed right and there he went taken before him the blood and he went behind the curtain into the third room there was a veil that dropped behind him and the outside world could not see him no more are you ready the very man or boy or woman or girl that is ever anointed of God and Walks Behind that veil of God the Holy Ghost puts him in a secret place the veil drops behind him and the world and all of its things are cut off from behind him so once that Veil Dro behind you the world is cut off shout out cut off Shout again cut off the world is cut off because that Veil drop behind you give the Lord some Praises do you see how it's supposed to be so if the world sticking onto you and it's sticky sticky sticky you're not be the veil yet because once they get behind the veil the world is he the BMB now he the BM Oh God help us this morning that's the reason Brethren that we are holding up the adoption of God wo but the punch is a big one listen listen listen as our difference of life and fussing and quarreling among one another is the reason the veil can't drop behind us and we can go into that presence of God adoption is being held up by Behavior it's an individual Affair between every Minister how a minister ought to get alone to himself even before he preaches before he prays before he does anything he should get alone with God in that quiet Hiway place with God praise God sure they eat Mana out there but they didn't know about this have you my dear brother don't despite my ignorance I want to ask you something Have you ever come to a place in life where Christ meant more than you than all arguing you could do about your church has Christ meant more more to you than all the world I don't mean from an emotion or mental workup I mean from the depths of your heart that something settling there something taking place and you don't know how it come but you're hid away listen your whole motive is to serve Jesus Christ have you entered that place my dear brother have you come into that place where you don't care what anyone says not to go out and act smart but till you love of God so anchored in you that you can't see nothing else your whole motive is to do the will of God to love for everybody flowing free from everywhere you want to live in that place you want a place to live that hidden place that's the place where we got to come into that's the place that God Reveals His secret things that's the place where God does the placing and the calling oh my Lord my Lord my Lord that's the place where God do the placing in the calling not some Minister some convention saying you are this and you are that you are that and when they fall out you are no longer that you are longer that this one 5old 5old 5old 5old when they fall out no longer fold they just knock them out they controlling the F but there's a place where God does the placing and the calling did you ever walk out in the morning in a real fresh cool feeling God has refresh his Earth fragrance did you ever come in the Rose Garden the honeysuckle don't smell much along the heat of the day but early in the morning when all the air has been purified the ARA of the honeysuckle let a man be out fussing fighting stewing and you will never never get much of an aroma from that of the Gospel let him get alone one time in the Stillness of God and he said every man that come to the pulpit ought to dwell alone with God first then comes the fruits healing fruits every man that stays in the presence of God into this great secret place hid away with heal the fruits of righteousness peace love and joy get that in your life you will never get it until you are Hide Away With God into that land of adoption oh so there's a place in that places where that's the third pull I will meet you in there oh give the Lord some Praises I will meet you in there that secret place of the most high Hallelujah When you pray pray to your father in seat in secret and he reward you openly amen acts 5:14 to 15 says and the Believers were added were more added to the Lord mlu both men and women in so much that they brought forth the sick into the streets and they laid them on beds and couches that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them praise God and they were healed Oh Glory to God isn't that something here and B saids look here he taking Peter James John hope faith and charity don't you see those gifted people then hope faith charity Hope was in James he was the one who set the church in order Faith was in Peter and charity was in John hope faith and charity it was God's representative on the earth and the people laid in Peter's Shadow and were healed oh friends don't think I'm yelling at you friends you might think I'm excited but I'm not I'm trying to get my point to you close enough to you you to see what I'm talking about oh praise God so then Along come the Pentecost with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and narrow it down by receiving the Holy Ghost that's right now that begins to shake down the gifts the resurrection and the spirit of God has come in the fullness of signs and wonders into the church and shook Pentecost what did is it here we go we are so close to the coming of the Lord Jesus until the very spirit that was in him is working in the church doing the very same thing he did when he was here on Earth it never been anywhere back from the time of the Apostles till this time why it Narrows Narrows what is it then he says this here just like your hand coming into a shadow negative negative what is it it's a reflection so you say a shadow you put your hand well I can't show it here but there's a shadow and the shadow is a reflection of the hand it's negative the shadow is a negative so watch this now it's a reflection what is Luther a reflection of Christ what is Wesley a reflection of Christ now we are at the end time they know the church was to receive power that would work in the church the same works of Christ because the shadow becomes deeper and deeper and deeper so as your hand get closer to the shadow it getting closer to be one do you get it now the shadow is coming it's coming to a reality negative negative negative and cut neck with the hand is positive all right they know the church was to receive power that would work in the church because as the shadow becomes deeper and deeper reflects more you take a shade further away from the shade the least reflection you get of the shade after a while the shades get closer and closer to the tree and the shade is the same thing now the spirit of God that work under justification under Luther Wesley performing the Holy Ghost under Works under Pentecost the church and Christ become one and soon they connect together the last link she will go to the sky shouting up will come Wesley Luther all the rest of them back in those days we are the end time here we go they don't want to get to that is what the Holy Ghost does the Holy Ghost by justification a light shadow of it the Holy Ghost by sanctification a little deeper shadow of it the Holy Ghost by baptism a deeper Shadow now the Holy Ghost by the restoration of his very person in here oh glory to God the this is beautiful he called Luther a shadow Wesley a shadow Pentecost a shadow but he called this here what the restoration of the person in here performing signs and wonders like you dig got Give the Lord some Praises could you take some more this ministry will end soon talking about his ministry and the expected son will appear himself yes amen the church has come through justification through Luther sanctification through the WAN enter the Bap where he goes through the Pentecostal and now winding up to The Headstone Ministry oh give the Lord some Praises so the prophecy is to come up to the headstone Ministry the stone that the billers refus oh give the Lord a shout hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah through the Pentecostal and now winding up to The Headstone Ministry typing all the time right here into that perfect negative Shadow becoming positive then Jesus Will Come and catch this church someday those who believe it separate yourself from unbelief oh praise God so listen to this friends hallelujah hallelujah the world is heading for a funeral service and the bride is heading for a wedding supper three and a half years of Darkness three and a half years of Hell on the earth three and a half years shadowed by the tribulation and the bride is being shadowed with the coming of the Lord under a condition of abiding in Christ he that have my word he that believeth on me and so on he that abides in me and my word in him asks what you will isn't that right listen to L notice made flesh when the word becomes flesh it becomes manifested think on that we have the word we have God in print but when this word becomes flesh it become manifested take the word put in the right position and the right kind of ground the seed will bring forth after its kind and the word brought forth in the right in a heart it will manifest itself and he went on to say this and the Word was invisible listen close the word was invisible until it was made flesh and then the word become invisible so ministers don't have to go and put up a a big card of how they are Apostle or how they are Prophet or how they are teacher how they are this they don't have to parade the beef once the word become flesh the invisible becomes visible and it will speak for itself no explanation necessary oh glory to God for 400 years no signs no wonders no Miracles no nothing John said Behold the Lamb of God here come Jesus Jesus get baptized when the church normal normal until the day the Lord led him when they say we want somebody to read scripture for today and he found the place where it's written the spirit is upon me and they thought he was just reading text and he was reading a reality he was reading himself he was reading the scriptures be manifested the spirit was upon him they couldn't see it they couldn't smell it they couldn't touch it he said that this day this scripture is fulfilled and they rejected him oh glory to God he overcome the devil already the devil was out of the picture Hallelujah Satan was rubbing his wounds from the Thunders that Jesus hit on him oh glory to God and now the church was about to get the Living Word manifested Oh Glory to God here come Jesus he read scripture and when he said this script fulfill fulfill all of them get frustrated and fed up with that and then he walk out there begin to heal the sick raise the dead C Devils Oh Glory to God the multitudes start to follow him the Scribe and Pharisees in trouble regular church folks in trouble because the Messiah is on earth now identified manifested the ministry of Jesus Christ Oh Glory to God and the ministry of Jesus Christ will once more be identified once more be manifested on the earth and the Hypocrites in this message will be in trouble the ones who not called behind the Pulpit will be in trouble because Jesus Christ will be manifested once more amongst the bride oh give the Lord a shout tell me one more ride okay let me hit the stret now you're doing great the words was invisible now listen close the word was invisible until it was made flesh and then the word become visible then brother Bram drilled Down Deeper through his sacrificial death at Calvary and his resurrection positionally places Church in that realm that the same invisible God could come into individual and make the word visible that's a promise you could hold on to what is he saying there this invisible God could come into you and make his word visible through you what did he said pick up a pen and write by and through the bride will be fulfill all that was promised Oh Glory to God we don't have to fight up and fight up and fight up by and through the bride will fill all that was promised oh my Hallelujah he said the same invisible God could come into the individual and make the word visible oh I wish my church could get that that's p bram said that and I wish you could see that too so but I'm talk about Sin couldn't stay in the church like anas a the spirit will quickly call it out no matter what it is how little it will be done see woman men sitting here under the power of the Holy Spirit the spirit of God moving perfectly moving this someone done something wrong in the congregation they would come quickly and confess it before the spirit got a hold of it to confess it before they come and tell it because they know right then it's going to be called so then that operation is the holy spirit operation calling things out that's not a man that's discernment dropping down when Peter came to the man at the gate called Beautiful he said perceive you are Faith to be healed so Peter could actually feel the power of faith in that man rise up and walk in the name of Jesus Christ hold the man up and pull him up and the man begin to walk not just walk he's had to jump and leap everybody know the man was that was a shocker and when them demons saw that b said they went out to hell and tell Satan listen it wasn't just the noise in the upper room you know we thought they was just having a good time but now the cripper walk in D went s say we have to stop that so they anoint the Pharisees and say put licks on them lock them up and put licks and when we start to Manifest this word here they want to put licks on us oh give the Lord a shout that when they want to close us down not for books and tapes no but for manifesting Jesus Christ and they put licks on them and they thought licks was going to make them quit they thought licks was going to make them faint they thought licks was going to make them give up but them guys went into the room and said Lord God oh why do the hidden rage strengthen thy servants send down your power and they were refilled with the Holy Ghost oh Give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah nothing going to stop this bride no counselor churches no ministers Association nothing going to stop this bride let me see a finish here my God hallelujah
