church is rising in power oh blessed be the name of a living God and we thank God for his presence we thank you for his holy spirit you may so tonight as we have our Bible we're going to read from one portion of scripture The Book of Luke chapter 8. and we'll see what the Lord will do for us tonight praise God amen [Music] praise God [Music] The Book of Luke chapter 8 then we will read from the 49th verse praise God [Music] now this was just after the woman with the blood issue touched Jesus and Jesus said who touched me praise the Lord and then verse 49 while he yet speak they commit one of the ruler of the synagogue's house saying to him thy daughter is dead trouble not the master for when Jesus had it he answered him saying fear not believe only and she shall be made whole and when he came into the house he suffered no man to go in Saint Peter and James and John and the father and the mother of the maiden and all went very important now praise God and the wield him but he said with not she is not there but sleeping and they loved him to score knowing that she was dead and he put them all out and took her by the hand and called saying may arise and his Spirit came again and she arose strict way and he commanded to give her meat and her parents were astonished but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done may the Lord had a blessing to the real of his word praise God Amen what a glorious time tonight please be the neighbor in the name of Lord I'm entitled to mine while they are laughing praise God and my subject is taken from Jesus's advice to the father fear not only believe and my inspiration is take the deity of Jesus Christ praise God oh you love him tonight is seated as to keep your fire as you keep your praise praise God while they were laughing praise God so he can imagine this group of people Jesus was out there performing preaching the gospel amen and here was a woman that had gone through all that she could go through and have no remedy to her problem but she said if I could just Touch the Hem of His Garment praise God so here was the multitude but here was one person with the focus why is it with the vision one person with a determination praise God and that was faith in a Believer praise God he wasn't even faith that was preached to her but she caught a revelation if I could just touch praise God immediately she taught Jesus that you went out of hell then Jesus said I feel something killer of me who touched me praise God now Peter could not even understand the question because there were multitudes around Jesus Christ they were shoving and moving and praise God but this was power standing there this was virtue standing there this was deity standing there praise God detected by himself nothing they shocked him but they felt nothing praise God they were with him they sat at his feet they felt nothing but here was a woman with faith he was a woman only believer praise God if I could get to him if I could just touch him I don't need him to lay hands on me I don't need him to pray for me if I could just touch the head of His Garment what a faith oh what a fate that's the faith we need tonight if I could just get a hold of the promise if I could just get a hold of his presence praise God hallelujah praise God oh glory be to the name of the Living God and so when Jesus found out praise God that he was this woman with blood issued that attacked her praise God because he said I felt bad to get out of me in other words she pulled power out of Jesus Christ she pulled Praise You Out of Hell by her faith oh blessed be the name of a living God when you come in prison that's what you do when you feel the presence when you know he's here because he promised to be here you walk in here come on you are here to patch the Hem of His coming so pray for nobody you are here alone with faith to touch the head of his comments praise God oh blessed be the name of the Living God Amen praise God Amen Hallelujah so immediately that happened then something happened Hallelujah this man that was there was listening to Jesus he was in church praise God but something was taking place in his home as he was hearing and seeing the witness of faith that was displayed the enemy was working in his home Dev stuck his home town struck his hole and beliefs track his whole sadness from this hole he wants to be discovering for an adventure he was going to believe on Jesus Christ to be saved by the devil the enemy the devorah attacked his home to kill his faith to kill him praise God but the seven said your daughter is dead don't even worry the master in other words don't even bother telling Jesus about it because there's nothing he can do she's completely dead no glory to God glory to God but before God ever does anything he does not do anything for any man's Glory he does it for his glory he was going to be glorified please stop to the servants that don't even tell the master don't bother him because there's no hope praise God and as usual the announcement has been made people started to cry as we will do today praise God you don't allow the death of a person once a person dies in the whole Brother The Wailing and the crying will confirm that somebody is dead so the neighbors began to run there because somebody was there they're crying and the Willing better he made an announcement that somebody in the house was dead Hallelujah so by the time the seven will leave the house there was absolute confirmation that the maid was dead Hallelujah before he run to tell this master your daughter is there praise God I don't tell the master from home let's see what we can do but Jesus had it oh Jesus had it praise God nothing can be hidden before him a new praise God that God was going to be glorified Hallelujah faith has been expressed faith has been displayed that you don't even need a master to pray you don't even need a master to lay hands you don't even need a mother to speak just patching the help of His Garment that he was standing right there oh blessed be the name of a living foreign Jesus told the father fear not believe only Hallelujah and she shall be made whole praise be the name of our living God she is not sick she is dead praise God and when they go to the house he suffered no man to go in praise God God he wasn't time for unbelief it wasn't time for doubt it was time for absolute faith God thank you presence was standing life was standing and they gave the Gate of death could not stand before that day the praise God hallelujah so he kept all the unbelievers out and took only the pure Believers those that knew who he was praise God hallelujah and then the mother and the Father the Bible said and they all wept praise God to cry and demonstrate before Jesus Christ that he was finished [Applause] everybody that was around there was whipping wailing on the floor rolling and holding their tummies praise God hallelujah and bewild her but he said we not now Jesus only believe he's a witness she is not dead Hallelujah now when Jesus made this pronouncement you could not understand the language the importance of the capitals and preaching the importance and talking but this was dating God himself The Giver of Life the maker of Life all the people the Alpha and the Omega was speaking praise God now this is where we are now praise God now God has displayed who he was he told him fear not believe only believe what believe that I am here believe that all is well praise God oh thy daughter is not dead Hallelujah believe that it looks impossible to the human mind but God Specializes you maybe see that in the impossible the beliefs of your human limitations oh did you hear me now God Specializes on the limit of your human limitation when your heart cannot take you God goes beyond that oh glory to God when your reasoning cannot take you God goes beyond that when your desires cannot take you God goes beyond that where your expectations will not take you God takes you beyond that [Applause] so Jesus said with not she is not dead but sleeping and they loved him man now God that were wailing crying oh they tend to laughing see the hypocrisy but they were not crying I service praise God and as soon as Jesus touched their human Spirit don't we She's Not Dead by sleeping they loved him to school amen praise God I loved him to ridiculate praise God knowing that she was dead now that was what their senses could tell them but God David standing they look beyond the realm of the senses he saw that she wasn't dead man she was just sleepy because God was going to be going to be confined he was going to be magnified he was going to be a little bit praise God so what did he do he put them all out and took him by the hand Jesus didn't say now when I'm going to show you now oh in the name no forget that Hallelujah he took it by the hand and God said make arise hey all right praise God and His Spirit came again and she arose straight away immediately as if Jesus was talking to her men arise and she immediately stood up praise God give us some food let them eat so they know that she is not a ghost so they know that I'm not hypnotized them to do some magic this is the one that was once dead she is alive why deity was on the sea dating was on display Teddy has spoken God himself The Giver of Life no but the important thing was that Jesus had to suffer reproach you may be seated praise God and I want us to take that line tonight amen praise God now you can never break through without reproach so when you see things are not going well for you that's true that God is with you Victory the next minute you are down God is there come on now don't give up fear not only believe because the devil is trying to derail you say that he's trying to get you up but remember remember that you're a child of God you are a god the Son of God that's why the devil is trying to shake your faith [Applause] you're gonna I know my redeemer leave it whereas that the Living Faith of the Living God in his church there is something in our heart that speaks that there is a land beyond the river is it your heart tonight that is why you are holding on praise God that's why you believe him that's why you know that this God can never fail every promise he has left in the world must come to pass it must be fulfilled brother don't put my finger on that land neither can any man but there is something within us that tells us that the grave is not in school Hallelujah so death is not our end death is not your end you didn't come to this world just to live eat and die and that anything is the land beyond the river there is a Rapture there's a heaven there's a place that we have to go praise God Amen but before we get to this place whether we must have a reproach we must discard that we must be laughed at we must be ridiculed we must suffer persecution but don't let that stop you praise God your master your maker God himself will take him power filled in hell he had to better approach he has to suffer the reproach he had to suffer the score but beyond that he didn't change who he was he was God Almighty he was Alpha and no maker he was a Giver of Life he was on power he wasn't important he was only said praise God he was the I am that I am he allowed to not stop him he has this belief could not stop him they are mockery could not stop him he was sent for our purpose and he stood just for that praise God so nothing the enemy will bring against you will change who you are you are a son of God you are a daughter of God you are called to Perfection you are called to adoption you have come to the pleasing of the sons of God you are called to break the manifestation of the sons of God and nature is groaning creation is growing for you to come to Perfection for you to come to your place for you to come to your inheritance brother and I am not backing up no matter the storms no matter the discouragement they will murder the disappointment on the way I am not giving up freedom is here that place me in this hour please be in the season bless me in this age I shall be fair I shall be sail I shall be healed I shall be delivered I shall make it adoption is mine Perfection is mine the Holy Ghost is mine please Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah who will repeat to the Living God I want you to pick up Faith tonight Lord that was what Jesus told a man hear not who cared as Palms don't care the obstacles don't tell the disappointment don't care your own mistakes whether you are put here for our purpose and it is a Divine Purpose oh do you hear me now God put us here for a Divine Purpose glory to God Hallelujah the world will laugh at you do my brother you are in the Divine Purpose of God glory be to the living Hallelujah amen you baby there is something within us that tells us that the grave is not his goal and that's Thou Art does not return is not amen that's Thou Art to dust with tennis was not spoken of the Soul did you hear that yeah and dust down will return amen but the prophet said that was for the body it wasn't for your soul it wasn't for your seed it wasn't for your geophany it wasn't for that seat that God placed in you before you were born before your mother and father even conceived to bring you for God had already brought you Hallelujah and attribute you are just expressed today oh so when that girl comes on this body of fear not the grave is not your goal you are going to go beyond the great beyond the humanistic into the supernatural presence of God what the deity of God himself forever and ever you know tonight Hallelujah that was not for the soul praise God rather there is something within us huh a fire that is burning a light that has been lit by God and no Breeze can blow it out what trees can blow it up those thoughts of Life can blow it up in your soul Glory Glory I feel good tonight Hallelujah there is no cold spells listen now Hallelujah a light that has been linked by God and no Priestess can blow him out there's no cold spells in the church those that will shout can they blow your fire out oh the fire has been lifting your soul don't call stealth in the church those indifference among the people no execution of the well can blow out the flame that God has laid for it is not purpose that his body parts of Freedom will burn until the coming of the Lord and no powers can blow it out they will only make it Bend brighter as they blow come on now they are unbelief could not stop God their laughter could not stop Jesus as they loved him to score brother power was there Jesus was absolute Jesus knew that life was coming back he knew that nothing could stand before him death could not stand before hell the unbelief of the people could not stand for him I am the resurrection and the light and the resurrection was right there speaking to the man your daughter is not dead she's sleeping oh what a blessed people we are nothing can blow it out not the persecutions of the world not the scoffing of the world not the laughter of the weather not of World Council of churches not theological interpretations of the denominations can blow out this fire it is a light of God it is the third light of God that has been little shine in this age oh the pride for his name's sake Hallelujah glory be to the Living God Amen the prophet goes I know my redeemer live apron 20 he said it's been proven to the ages that persecutions strengthens the church praise God to try out strengthens the believer executions presence the believer the more they love the more Jesus grew in power the more he walked confident the more he told the devil you watch me praise God I am the resurrection and the light that persecutions strengthens the church and Daniel not knowing how he was going to do it and not knowing whether God was good God God what God was going to do but knowing that he was able to do it and knowing that something down there in him told him so praise God are you ready so God had a purpose and he had everything working to that purpose God was for your life so don't say over for me I made a mistake no there's no mistake the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of the Lord God wants to prove you God wants to vindicate you God wants you to realize that Glory and Honor belongs to him and all things worked together not some things so there is no mistake in your life there's no mistake in your marriage there's no mistake taking your job there's no mistake in your family circumstance all things working together praise God Hallelujah he had everything working to that purpose and he has everything working today in your life to that purpose what happened the Divine Purpose for your life oh blessed be the name of a living God so the brothers and today the how in how indifferent we seek to be to be how straight things goes and how the church gets in this condition and that condition is all in Divine Purpose of God [Applause] praise God it is only what Divine Purpose of God to mourn us and to make us in his own way who knows how to Fashion the material more than the Creator praise God so everything is for the people praise God God knew that it was coming and farming in the land you may receive it [Applause] Joseph was a young boy but God knew that was coming at a time there will be farming in Allah praise God God had to make a way of Escape for his children praise be the name of the Living God so God sent for a Divine Purpose for the children of Israel for Jacob and his descendants praise God it didn't come in a usual way a dream come the way they wanted it Hallelujah to God in the beginning had to give Joseph a gift a gift of vision a gift of Dreams a gift of interpretation of Dreams praise God and it was all working towards his Divine Purpose for his children praise be the name of a living God oh Hallelujah and God made Joseph a dreamer and Joseph was loved of the father praise God in order to bring persecution on Joseph Hallelujah did you hear what I said Hallelujah now Jacob had to love him so much praise God that he would bring what he trained against him praise God so here was Joseph gifted with the spirit of Dreams hallelujah oh and Joseph was not a quiet guy Joseph was the guy that liked to testify he said come on now daddy God showed me a dream as I saw a dream of praise God the Son and the moon oh Hallelujah and he starts bowing down and this Moon and the Sun and the other stars bowing down to this one star they caught the Revelation they've got the interpretation and Joseph knew Jacob knew that one day this sun was coming all to be a spiritual boy to be a son that God was going to deal with foreign [Applause] and the Brethren got more angry why that is how God proves how he strengthens the church praise God hallelujah and so what did he do he hated Joseph they could have killed him my God like you told the devil that is true go after him but don't you touch his soul don't you touch his life praise God because God knew that victory was going to come out to glorify hell praise God so here was Joseph sold out to these ishmaelites Hallelujah and the first thing they did was that they dumped him in the well he could have died in that well the next day they came he was still alive praise God but that was not because it was for Joseph it was God's Divine Purpose in the life of Jacob I mean of Joseph to bring life [Applause] now when you read the Bible Joseph never complained Joseph stayed Focus Joseph was surrendered to the will and the purpose of God oh God will bring me through well I know I will not die at least they have kept me in a well but Avengers somebody will see me and bring me out and here they came and brought him out some said let's kill him and they said though let's not take innocent God praise God and God was touching the heart of them and they said you know what let's tell him off to Egypt far away that no one will remember him Hallelujah are you following me tonight just follow your story now you've got to have the spiritual understanding that whatever takes place in your life is waking up for his glory he's waking up for his good he's working out for his purpose in your life praise God now when they go down to Egypt Joseph said Thank God I'm alive praise God he was Soul into slavery amnesty along the line praise God let me stay here in Egypt and be obedient as a slave praise God for adventure in time will come that will be amnesty in Egypt and Pharaoh Will Set Me Free so Joseph was happy praise God but that was God's purpose all of divine intervention Hallelujah Joseph was going to come into Authority and power praise God so they realized that Joseph was a proper boy a potifier had to take him in praise God and he was giving you know some duties to be in charge of the slaves oh I believe so Joseph was a bit happy but he was still in Divine Purpose praise God hallelujah now here was God working his way out to Joseph to the human mind because I would have been bitter but Joseph stayed focused spiritual as many other led by the spirit they are the sons of God we have to learn to talk less and give him glory most [Applause] about our situations and give you glory I surrender to you Lord have your way father Lord be glorified in this situation be glorified in this trial let your name be glorified for all things working together for my good praise God in order for Joseph to have said I have arrived if I can fall in love with this man's wife who is not always at home I would have made it I'll be free but the world constrained Joseph amen hallelujah Joseph knew that you couldn't do that he has hit the law of God in his heart [Applause] what would you do if you were in Joseph's shoes would you start the persecution reduce the time the trial would you stand the hatred and the division and the separation and you know to attempted to kill and to to destroy his whole history praise God what would you do praise God that there was something in Joseph a seed of perfection [Music] please stop so here was the best one she couldn't get her way she had to lie on that young man praise God Joseph's case was getting worse and worse and yet he was praying and praying and when they brought yourself out he never defended himself he said amen God's Divine Purpose is not that's why he said my ways are not your ways my words are passed finding out you can't find out the ways of God you cannot find out the purpose of God for your life all you got to do is the leg of the spirit let us be left of the spirit Joseph had to go into prison Hallelujah and in prison you know the Butler and the baker had a dream and not trouble them praise God but Joseph God inspired it into Joseph you can see your continuous trouble what is the problem they told yourself the dream and Joseph smiled praise God God was sowing the foundation laying the foundation for Joseph to come to power because something Pharaoh was going to have a dream that no man could understand that no man could interpret except God hallelujah praise God so Joseph interpreted a dream and it came to pass Hallelujah and when this man was released years later praise God Pharaoh had a dream so if it was you I have been sold to slavery but you were sold for a purpose because there was coming a dream and it was not just the interpretation of the dream but it was all waking to the farming in the land but not just the farming but the preservation of life oh Joseph was going to come into power so in Joseph's case the persecution he received was the score and the laughter and the reproach but all that report was working in Divine Purpose of God for his life amen my brother is all in the Divine Purpose of God to mold us because we are coming to that Perfection now David is going to live in you for David to live in you you must all be strict of who you are what you take how you think it should be you must be straight completely that you can walk in the blessedness of his peace and his Divine Purpose oh you're loving tonight please stop so pero had a dream and you know the story Joseph was now put in second place Hallelujah given a ring of authority abducted in that place that whatever Joseph said it was fire praise God oh from prison to power From Slavery to the king of Egypt to the king of the world praise be the name of a living God and God cannot fail whatever God has declared in your life will murder storms no matter the circumstances no matter where you pass it must come to pass foreign hit the well there was no choice than for them to get down to Egypt when do you come down to Egypt they had to bow to Joseph can God fail can that drink fail could that word fail it was in Divine Purpose they came there and they bowed and Joseph recognized them but they couldn't recognize Joseph because they never thought he would rise to that place they never dreamed in their life oh they thought they were persecuting here they thought they were approaching hell but they were sending him into Power into his position into his place and that is what God has for you you are living in Divine Purpose to cry about the persecutions don't cry about the rejections don't cry about the reproach it is God working out his Divine Purpose you are committed to power as touching is yours Perfection is yours the Holy Ghost is yours the blessing of the sons of God is yours today giving thanks is a good time giving thanks in the bad time is all working in Divine Purpose praise God Hallelujah and that is why the believer you've got to look through God's binoculars praise God for that Divine Purpose hallelujah oh the powerful Divine Purpose is hidden in the wisdom of God not the wisdom of man but the wisdom of God but how he got to power was not present it was beyond the human mind but it was God working his way out oh don't you love this young girl Oh Glory to God so he wonders but Abraham said amen hallelujah he said and it is it is the only grounds of Fellowship that God has ever laid down for himself and his church is the Oneness of himself in his people hallelujah the only grounds of Fellowship that's why we are coming to The Showdown [Applause] that's right but there's coming forth amen that is spread of his word Spirit of the spirit life of his life praise God and it is the Oneness of God remember our inspiration the deity of Jesus Christ so the prophet that it is the only trance of Fellowship that God has laid down for himself in his church is the Oneness of himself in his people and that is the only grounds of Fellowship praise God so you can never have Fellowship outside be connected with God by experience with the baptism of the Holy Spirit it's not a rituals we do in church ah it's not the building and it's not what we can do but it is your connection with him and the holy Holy by a union hallelujah praise God it's not enough to just believe the message you must be born again of the spirit and when you are walking in the spirit life Joseph was appointed you will not complain in God's Divine Purpose but he played out the path of Christ they mocked Christ imagine that this girl's Resurrection they loved him to store but he never moved he walked in Divine Purpose praise God and the only way you can have those grounds is by a union to be United with him forever just like when you Unite with your husband the woman to unite with the husband it is a vowel until death now then when you Unite with God is the same thing that the church United with Christ is until death we part so what shall separate me from the love of God ah shout persecution shall not your future oh Hallelujah if you can understand the love of God [Applause] the devil will be history in your life praise God oh is the same thing that the church is united with Christ is unto them with part and then if you never sin or do anything wrong you will eternally United with God and only death can take you away from God not physical death now but the sin of death sin is death and that takes you away from God so to be United with him in the spirit of his power is eternal life you see how you get eternal life to be United with him in the spirit of his word power amen but Rosie and I want to get to that innovate United eternally with the Eternal God perfectly in harmony with him so you've got to come to be with God that woman with a bloody issue she had to connect with the spirit looking at the circumstances eternally United with eternal God perfectly in harmony with him perfectly United in church that's all oh God and his church is one United together are you walking through them knowing that it is God Divine Purpose in the danger of Jesus Christ and now a little while and to let me know more yet you will see for I will be with you even in you to the end of the world that's right you know and in the days oh how his big picture always resolve up and made the same thing come to pass that we are seeing now he came down like he was like he came down to Peter to Moses like he came down to sorrow on his way to Damascus like he came down on the upper room he returned back in our day in that pretty pillow of fire praise God hallelujah amen the great drama is set and we are ready now to see great things happen the believer is ready now to see what great things happen you have been showed up you have been loved and mocked and scored when you pass the tests oh come on now you are coming to your position as Place sounds the drama is set and we are getting ready we are ready now to see great things happen the church has been brought through the crackle that's right Pentecost rocked it down under a few a few years ago but there while the people told storms made fun and loved that but she grown out to maturity now come on now you grow up to maturity now once I was a child I thought like a child oh brother but now I become a man I put a witch on these things so when we see that you are put away childish things then you can take the hard corn on the land then God connects with your Cedar praise be the name of the Living God you are a lot that you are made fun of you have made you have you have been true sooner but she's grown to immaturity now that's exactly right that Allah is here hallelujah that's right that is what I am interested in I'm interested in seek to come to maturity come to power come to a place that God can be glorified in your life we can't go back to church bylaws and this no we are here for the maturity that God can trust you with this divine nature mistake is here that's right that's what I am interested in to see God's Church coming together now not divided coming together now oh we'll be beat out here beat out there but the hour is coming when God is throwing a blanket around all of us to drop us in while the enemy is at the gate Hallelujah he's standing now for his people God is standing for his people who Daniel 12 and 30 shall Michael rise of the great praise and stand for the people praise God he is standing for his people that they'll say the great things of the last days when these things come to pass by great Express will the people they do the men of faith will do in that day it wouldn't be you now it wasn't Joseph it was the nature of Christ even yourselves stood there on that throne he saw The Bravery it wasn't time to pay back am I hearing Amy so those of you that think that we are going to get power to show somebody you get that power praise Joseph said I am Joseph your brother come on to me now I am Joseph your broker God God did that to preserve life [Applause] Joseph never was angry so the proposal when the bread finds his brother alone when the bright price is Holy decency when the pride finds his place in Christ we are not going to say yes God has been what I've proven so you will reach out to your brother come and rejoice come let's Rejoice not debate but but come let us bring Choice God has thrown a blanket over all of us we are praying I am Joseph your brother oh blessed be the name of a living God and we are coming to that now nothing is going to stop the pride that price shall be won that pride is under our promise praise be the name of the Lord the prophet continues in paragraph 73 of the deity of Jesus Christ and the hour has come now that when the Great drama picture of God set forth for the letter reign we are promised latter and former Reign the former Reign has come but we are waiting for the lottery Dynamics to our mechanics and the prophet the hour has come this is exclusive those that are going to pick up that wedding coming those that have done their ABC because this is ABC [Music] so these are those that are in Divine Purpose so don't give up now don't let nothing distract you from Divine Purpose praise God said in the last days it shall come to pass that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and daughters shall prophesy upon my handmaids and make servants would I pour out my spirit and I will show signs in the heaven above and signs in the egg below and pillars of fire and big papers of sport it shall come to pass before the great and terrible day of the Lord shall come now whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved Hallelujah
