Faithfulness when our faithfulness is not enough great is thy faithfulness father we are humble in your presence Lord we are so needy this morning Lord may you speak to us from your word this morning and take me out of the way may you walk out of History Lord and be a reality a present tense reality for the young people in our midst for the parents in our midst for the backsliders in our midst for those who are struggling in our midst for those who are barely hanging on in our midst Lord your promise to be your present help in time of trouble me you lift us up where we belong Lord as the Eagles Lord father Lord we want to fly this morning and dash into the presence of almighty God lord may you minister to us Lord for the few moments we are here in your presence granted now we ask in the precious theme of Jesus Christ and the church says and the church says can we give the Lord a hand of praise [Applause] amen certainly greet one and all in the precious name of Jesus Christ thank you so much brother Anthony musicians I give it a special the atmosphere thank you church for creating that atmosphere those that are here those that are on the internet God bless you we love you we appreciate you so without further pause let us approach a scripture this morning certainly a great privilege to speak to the purchased of the blood of Jesus Christ we want to read from two portions of scripture this morning from Deuteronomy 32 and from second Peter verse 1. we're going to read from Deuteronomy 52 verse 7. remember the days of old consider the years of many generations asks thy father and he will show thee thy elders and they will tell thee and reading second Peter 1 reading from verse 1. Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that had called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to which you knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness unto the unto brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lack of these things as blind and cannot see a far off and have forgotten I want you to watch that hat forgotten that he was purged from his old sins so it is possible to forget that you were purged from your old sins it's possible to forget where the Lord brought you from wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if he do these things ye shall never fall so there is a place of standing in which you could never fall verse 11 for so an engine shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though he know them and be established in the present truth so Paul is saying here uh Peter rather is saying here that I will not be negligent I in other words I will make it my responsibility to put you always in remembrance of these things in other words I don't want you to forever forget it though you know them and be established in the present truth he said yeah I think it meets or I think it is fit as long as I am in this Tabernacle or this physical body to stir you up by putting you in remembrance because you're going to forget some things but I want to make sure that I remind you can the church say Amen knowing that shortly I must put off this my Tabernacle in other words shortly I must give up this flesh even as our Lord Jesus Christ had showed me moreover I will endeavor that ye may be able after my disease to have these things always in remembrance for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning in the presence of the Lord it's certainly a great privilege to be in the house of the Lord this morning Hallelujah are you happy to be in the house of the Lord happy to be in Fellowship on a Sunday morning in the presence of the Lord and under expectation for God to do something special for us I really want to appreciate the worship this service this the anointing the present this morning God bless you once again whether Anthony the musicians and I really want to salute right over it for the prayer meeting on Friday night you appreciate the service on Friday night I'll talk a bit more about that and then uh last Wednesday but Anthony my my my and there he wrestled you appreciate God's servants amen and last Sunday within every service God has been unfolding himself to us in a special way you know and uh after brother Anthony preached last Wednesday you know but always said I'm going to follow by the Anthony and he's pulled a tomb of frame of reference and he spoke about anchor points on Friday night and I was sitting there my mind was completely blown completely blown because I knew what the Lord was showing me and the road I was trying to go and I called him the next day I say that anchor points where you got that from no I know where I get it from but it just stirred me because I was into something about the place where something happened in your life that you could anchor so if you have a full back position and the devil back you up on a wall he can hold on to something and not move anymore but I was trying to find the right phrase to use to describe that spot and when he said anger point I say that's it the Anchor Point so for a title this morning the anchor points of your feet so I'm following straight after but over it's message the anchor points of your fate and my subject knowing what to forget and what to remember and as an inspiration spiritual amnesia it's important for us to know what to forget and we have to know what to remember there are some things God wants us to forget but there are also some things that God wants us to remember can the church say Amen when you come out of what you were in before God wants you to forget them always and those all things you say don't go back when you go to water baptism he said he could take the whole world but give me Jesus no turning back no turning back you're supposed to forget certain things but when you begin to walk along this journey you have to remember certain things and we read the scripture there from Peter saying I'm gonna make it my responsibility as long as I'm alive to remind you although you already know these things but I want to always put you in remembrance because you need to remember certain things it's critical for you to make it that you don't forget certain things can the Church Say Amen an anchor point an anchor point is a place that holds you Hallelujah and the last time I preached I spoke about finding faith in the midst of your storm Hallelujah this morning the Anchor Point of your feet and I'm going after that Faith because the whole Ministry of that Elijah Prophet was to turn our hearts back to the fate of the fathers can the church say amen and Jesus himself said when the son of man coming shall he find so you gotta find Faith you gotta be anchored in your faith your faith must be unshakable it must be unmovable nothing could distract you Hallelujah can the church say Amen Faith goes beyond your five physical senses so see taste start smell goes beyond that and even the senses of the spirit imagination reasoning those five Avenues into that sixth sense that Center the soul is either doubt or faith but we are here this morning by faith you came to church this morning by faith you are looking for your healing by faith your family is going to be delivered by faith you are going to be healed by faith you're going to receive the Holy Ghost by faith we're gonna have to have faith to go to the Rapture that kind of people call Rapture and Faith we're gonna have faith to move the power that keep it called perfect Faith but when the son of man cometh he shall find faith on the Earth can the church see amen oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Give the Lord a shout out praise this morning tomorrow is a public holiday so Tim lock off your seat belts take a make sure you take up your phone Hallelujah forget everything else and let's ride the anointing Hallelujah because we're gonna find the Anchor Point of your feet when the devil think you're gonna backslide you're gonna drop an anchor when the storm of light comes you drop an anchor and the anchor is going to hold and despite the storm Hallelujah when there's problems on your job your anchors got to hold in spite of the storm when the doctor report come negative your anchor has got to hold despite the storm can the church see amen thank you oh blessed be the name of the Lord so I did a little research before I get into my texts I started to understand and we we may know it but why does a ship even need an anchor Hallelujah because if the winds come and the current come and in the middle of the storm where you can't move the ship you gotta drop an anchor at a hole and steady the ship but I found out the best ships don't have one anchor because one anchor may not be enough so at the minimum you have two anchors and the more important the cargo you even have three anchors you have an anchor just in case one of the two anchors that anchor the front and the back if something goes wrong nobody can bail you out so you walk with that extra anchor in case something goes wrong with the main anchors because you want to be so anchored that's not a good move you now when the storm coming Don't Drift somewhere and your ship don't wreck somewhere so you got to know where to drop the anchor know what your Anchor Point is can the Church Say Amen foreign [Applause] but an anchor point is also a point where that is a foundation for you you're not gonna back down from there it gives you fit so your faith could be based on these anchor points can the church say amen and that's why I said this morning you got to know what to forget and what to remember there's some things that when you remember them it gives you faith it gives you encouragement so when I think of Jesus walking on the water that's an anchor point for me Hallelujah it shows me all things are possible Hallelujah when that woman had the oil and the meal and she was about to do her last meal and Elijah said pick me a cake first and she just opened it up and her food didn't run out that's an anchor point for my soul up that he is still able to take the impossible he could take the little I have when he took the 55 lows and the two fishes up and he fed all those people I can have little this morning but that's an anchor point my feet is resting on that anchor pointer you can distract me from my Anchor Point somebody say Amen and I don't want to forget it I can't afford to forget it you know the thing about the memory sometimes we forget important things and sometimes we remember the wrong things the devil's job is to bring back to your memory things to hold you down and to weigh you down and I so thank God we're going to get to it God remembers stuff but God also loves to forget stuff because you have a sea of forgetfulness specially designed to make sure he forgets certain things or you don't hear me this morning you got to know what to forget you got to know what to remember Paul said forget the things that are possible I want to forget my mistakes I wanna oh come on somebody help me this morning you may be seated so I started to discover by the Clarence some patterns in Scripture that blew my mind completely we know it's there but when you're looking at it it starts to jump out at you how God set up anchor points to have a spot to have a conversation with somebody so and and one of the things I was sharing Beethoven that one of the things as Believers we don't celebrate what God is doing enough in our lives let me say it one more time we don't celebrate the victories that God has done for us because every Victory you have is an anchor point the fact that he woke you up this morning is an anchor point the fact that oh you don't hear me this morning you know how many people told me they should have died could have died would have died every service you should be writing a note of Praise because every time the Lord does something for you it's an anchor point it could be big it could be small it could be for your son you may be seated last Sunday with a black man give me a testimony about his vehicle and I and I left saying you know what we supposed to be celebrating these things more because it's God doing something for us God inspiring people in our lives people on the streets people being pushed to do things they don't even know why they're doing it but it's because of you they're doing it they don't even understand why they open a door why they do this why they do that you that's why you have a reason to shout oh Hallelujah you have a reason to worship [Music] every one of you have an anchor point the fact that you made it the service this morning is an anchor Point Hallelujah glory to God oh somebody give the Lord a shout of praise Hallelujah [Applause] but it's so easy to forget and under the pressure and the stress under the depression distress I remember one time I was traveling and I got to the U.S and I got into the immigration I got to the customer something had any bag and you know sometimes they randomly pull you over and say well what's in this and I look at the back and say I don't even know that bug because under the pressures like wait a minute but I actually forget about today you know because under pressure under stress you just forget certain things and Under Pressure some people just go to the bank and forget the PIN you go to the community forget your password all kind of things people going to exam and get exam Friday and they know they work you know you know much people tell me they know they work and I know they know they work but under depression they stress status it just comes to their mind it's not that it's not in their mind but under the pressure they forget so God through scripture I realize always reminding the people [Applause] Say Amen so when God is saying I am the god of Abraham I'm the god of Isaac I'm the god of Jacob he not seen it because he's just calling names you know each of those Patriarchs were anchor points [Applause] Generations strongly line he says in I'm the god of Abraham I'm the god of Isaac I'm the god of Jacob most of the people who heard this never met Jacob or never met Isaac or never met Abraham but they knew the testimony in the life of Abraham they knew the testimony in the life of Isaac they know their testimony in the life of Jacob and God was using it as an anchor point to remind them that when Abraham couldn't have a son do you remember the story of how I walk up to Abraham and I turn his life around and said leave your country leave your family and come and follow me [Applause] to this day we are called children of Abraham so great was that Anchor Point that to this day we are still sons and Tall you don't hear me this morning [Applause] you may be seated anchor points that God put there so we can look back you remember when the god opened up the waters he said put 12 Stones so that when your children I mean children's children and your children children pass by here they will remember open up the water it's morning to have anchor points so when your child in trouble he could look at the stone and say I wasn't here but I heard the story of if God could open up the water he can do it for me he did it before he could do it again he's the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah somebody give the Lord a shout of praise hallelujah hallelujah shout like you had breakfast sound like you didn't have breakfast but get in the spirit of the Lord because we have enough anchor points to keep on pressing the battle I can't backslide I can't turn back I can't give up that come too far to turn back now I've seen too much I've seen too much thank you foreign [Applause] I hope this is helping somebody this morning [Applause] I want to go through some scriptures then we're going to touch some quotes Abraham was an anchor point but that was an individual God called out a man call Abraham and when he was finished dealing with Abraham the man and his house he dealt with his son Isaac and after that he dealt with Jacob and I started by the Anthony preached on last Wednesday but that was all individuals and that's why they are named as the Patriarchs the foundations of faith but after Jacob wrestled he became Israel and God switched from dealing with individuals to dealing with the group so we find out that when the children of Israel end up in bondage in Egypt that in Exodus 3 7 is the first time you could find the Bible reference my people because Exodus 3 7 and the Lord said I have surely seen the affection of my people which are in Egypt but I have heard their Cry by reason of their taskmasters for I know their sorrows so it was the first time God had the opportunity to interact with the people and the group in that kind of way beyond the Patriarchs themselves so throughout scripture apart from Abraham and Isaac and Jacob being individual anchor points that whole Egypt became a narrative that existed this day we could look and talk about how the Lord took us out of Egypt in Exodus 33 and Moses said unto the people remember this day in which he came out from Egypt out of the house of bondage in other words I don't want to ever forget this for by strength of hand the Lord brought you out from this place can the church say Amen in numbers 15 we're going to take a little walk through the scripture because these are anchor points not just for the children of vegetables for us also numbers 15 37 and the Lord speak unto Moses saying Speak unto the chairman of Israel and listen bid that they make them fringes that's tassels in the borders of their garments so when you wonder why the Jews wore tassels this is why speak unto the children of Israel and beat them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations and that they put upon The Fringe of the borders a ribbon of blue and it shall be unto you for our friends listen that he may look upon it and remember all the Commandments of the Lord and do them and that he seek not after your own heart and your own eyes after which she used to go a whoring that he may remember and do all my Commandments and be holy unto the Lord I am the Lord your God who has brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God I am the Lord your God so God wasn't even the instruction to word only he said dress in such a way that when you look at your clothes in the mirror you will remember that I brought you out of Egypt I want you to dress in such oh you don't hear me this morning I want you to dress that when you look in the mirror you will remember my Commandments are you dressing in the world when you look in the mirror you could oh you don't hear me this morning this is what a young people for the young Brothers for their young sisters [Applause] to keep you in the way in other words God gave them actual way to remind themselves because in the peace of life you get so busy sometimes he said put it on your clothes so when you're about to do something and you look at it you you pack yourself and say listen this tussle is not here for decoration no it's not it seems just put it here though the tailor put it here because it's in style this is to remind me that that I could have been dead but I'm alive this is to remind me that there's a Commandment that I have to follow I don't hear you this morning [Applause] [Music] Deuteronomy 5 15. and remember that there was a servant so over and over and over this Egypt experience is there anybody God took you out of the world took you out of Egypt is there anybody in the house anybody know that to be here gonna have to take you out of redemptions and Tupac coming out of and going into and on the process of going into God wants to remind you of where you come from you may not be where you're supposed to be but you're certain that way you used to be you might be a Broken Eagle but you're not in a barnyard no more you're not a chicken he took you from somewhere he brought you out from somewhere so I'm here like Peter this morning to put you in remembrance of these things even though you already know it to remind you that he will pull you out of the world pull you out of Baptist pull you out of Pentecostal pull you out of the messenger to put you in a bride he is able to finish that work he started Give the Lord a shout out praise [Applause] everybody should be shouting he took me out of the world he took me out of sin he took me out of Egypt now God take Egypt out of me he took me out of my pass up he took me out of my family tree I don't know nothing about that no more I know I'm a child of the king I come from God going back to God somebody gave God a shout of praise somebody Give Him worship somebody left him higher I'm still in Deuteronomy 5 15. listen is Listen People us forget some people some people grew up poor and they grow up struggling and they get a little blessing and they get a little blessing and they forget they were poor you know they forget where they come from you know they forget how hard it used to be you know and all of a suddenly things that you see what they do now all of a sudden they're too stush they get too proud they grew up in adding hot water into the buckets of cutting but now they shower and the shower not working so they cabbage [Applause] they're waiting on the shower to work because they forget they used to use a bucket or you don't hear me this morning but I want to remind you that you came from somewhere and if God rich and mercy didn't pull you from where you are you don't have a chance you have no excuse to be dead this morning you have no excuse to be lazy this morning you have no excuse [Applause] you in the Pentecostal Church in the Baptist Church and in order to scripture and the eyes get open to this message and they get comfortable because you're in the message do you remember when you knew nothing you remember when they thought it was okay to just live like the world and come to church anybody with me [Applause] so God finds himself in Deuteronomy 5 15 and remember that dog was a servant in the land of Egypt and that the Lord thy God brought

morning [Applause] [Music] just a few more scriptures Deuteronomy 8. verse 2. and thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God LED you these 40 years in the wilderness listen why you remember talk about it the people who bear in bucket and then they get shower and they don't want to he said to humblebee in other words the people came out of Egypt but the sense of Pride you know so he sent them to the Wilderness for 40 years to Humble them and to prove thee so all these years since the prophet left it was the humble people who got conceited with some books and tips and to prove me to know what was in thine heart not what you're saying with your mouth but what in your heart whether thou would keep his Commandments or no you see all God is interested in his Commandments you know that's why he said follow obedience to the entire world entitles you to the token could he take someone because we would not we wouldn't finish I'm on page 12 of 62. somebody say oh my I will come out of Deuteronomy and just show you because the problem throughout history and through scripture is when things get bad people remember the Lord and when things get normalized they forget you Lord why God have to put in your back way to come back to church you leave church walking or you come back on a wheelchair pray for me judges 6 6. and Israel was greatly impoverished because of the media9 this is how Gideon was activated and the children of Israel cried to the Lord no they was Bachelor no no and it's because God sent them in a nicer deal with them but the children were greatly impoverished because of the millions of cried out and it came to pass when the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord because of the midianites that the Lord sent the prophet you see why I can't get around God setting a prophet the law sent a prophet under the children of Israel with seven to them thus said the Lord God of Israel I brought you up from Egypt that's how we start the message back to the Anchor Point of Egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage and I deliver you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Allah to oppress you and drave them out before you and gave you their land and I said unto you I am the Lord your God fear not the gods of the amorites in whose land he dwell but ye have not obeyed my voice that way the angel came to pre-double that's what the angel came to sit that's what he Prophet came to say and that's how Kieran was activated and and when you go further and read about Gideon Gideon say where all the Miracles the father's talking about taking us out of Egypt that's that's Gideon away he keep going back to the Anchor Point where the Miracles I hear about Egypt but where's my miracle but to show you but upon your cycle over and over by judges eight verse 33 and it came to pass as soon as Gideon was dead that the children adventure turned again and went a whoring with Balaam and made Bal buried their God and the tuna fish are remembered not the Lord their God so is God a god of convenience to you because that's what it was the remnant when things get bad call upon God I want to take a normal well well we could go back over and over can you take some more [Music] it saw many scriptures I want to try to cut it short here but Nehemiah though even though all adult even though as Lord alone thou has made Heaven the heaven of Heavens with all their hosts the Earth and all things that are there in the seas and all that they're in and they are preserving them all and the hosts of Heaven worship with thee that why the Lord and he goes on and on and on and on until the city Affliction of our fathers in Egypt are they showing you how true scripture they keep going back to the Anchor Point Psalm 78 how often they provoke him in the wilderness and grieve him in the desert yeah they turned back and tempted God and limited the Holy One of Israel and remembered not his hand so I want you to see truly problems because I want to know how you end up in about how you end up in a party did you remember the Lord when he was walking in oh you end up in that dress how you end up wearing that or you end up in that position because it could not be remembering you Lord when he picked the outfit when they take the money out to your purse with the car to make you purchase the way you remember any Lord when your

the Lord when they chose to not come to church to do something that that was that was different will you remember any Lord [Music] and God keep taking them back to their Anchor Point Church what is your Anchor Point what what is holding you what what is reminding you to keep pressing the battle Isaiah 46 I shouldn't choose scripture remember this and show yourselves men you want to be a man show me a man bring it again to mind in other words remember oh you transgressors remember the former things of all what I've done for you for I am God and there is none else I am God and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from the ancient times the things that are not yet done seeing my counsel shall stand and I will do all my pleasure throughout scripture God crying to get the attention of his people in every generation and the same cry is on today the same way Peter cried out he said I know you know these things but I want to put you in remembrance [Applause] all right I'm almost finished this section Jeremiah 18 15 the last one because my people had forgotten me you know what does it do something for somebody and they just forget you ungrateful I know I can imagine feels when they do something for your child and you held them and then you feel like they even use it good they did his waste and they do what they want to do they it doesn't feel a certain kind of way when are you sacrificing and put your effort to do certain things all the parents I know except the reprobates always do their best they may not do all they need to know but they do their best with what they know that's why the Bible say honor your father and your mother that the days may be long because they're doing their best and then children want to walk around and it's really experts you know the other day my daughter is three years old and then she close it on man you you paying bills you paying bills like so I said to her you're not listening to me she said you're not listening to me and I can imagine we as natural parents go through this because they're trying to discover themselves but yet still we do all we could do because we want to see them smile we want to see them happy we want to give any best chance to survive and to succeed and to make it because this is our evil horrible world we want to give them every Advantage we could because if you're not prepared for life life will eat you up [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and listen friends the Lord's be alive when she gets older I don't want the money back from the food I put in her mouth but

have burned incense to vanity and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient parts to walk in Parts in a way and not cast up in other words they're making their own track having a form of godliness but deny any power that's what it is anybody feeling fine this morning could you take some more that is the introduction [Applause] I'm on page 20 so we we're making progress so we talk a lot about what to remember and how much God wants to be remembered and I found myself more and more as I get older I recognize I am but Clarence laughing I am becoming Allah I'm not trying to clean my ownership but but I'm becoming more understanding of the importance of memories and how important to remember the right thing because as they get older and you're unable to do certain things and operated in ways what you are left with is memories memories of what he could share that's why it is so important that you sit with the elders and you have respect for those who have walked a certain road before they can share certain things they may not be able to run around and do what you could do but they have memories that are precious memories Hallelujah so I think and Paul in Philippians 3 13 says Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but there's one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things with her before I press towards the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus friends there's so much information this information age that it's tough to remember everything but in all of your doing remember the Lord we are challenged no more than ever to have more all levels more a levels more degrees more qualifications more this more than that but in all of your remembering remember the things and you have to choose to forget certain things like Paul I've said it to the young people many times and young people here and those connected to the internet you have to forget certain friends yeah forget you have to forget certain phone numbers you have to forget certain people they're not going where you're going [Applause] [Music] and remember the Lord in broken systems but Abraham said all the learning he had as Paul he had to forget all he knowed in order to find Christ in a message once more but Abraham said if there could only be the objective of the Pentecostal move tonight I'm willing to forget about whether I'm this way or one is Tunis trainings I'm going to forget about all these worldly things I wanted to forget the worldly things are you truly willing young people to

remembered when he picked up the gate that was an anchor point human when you ripped the lion mouth open that was an anchor point he remember when we're just a jaw born he destroyed the enemy that's why he could say once more Lord can you reconnect this morning to when you felt the presence of God in a way that you could look back and say I know that I know that I know it was the Lord [Applause]

man Invasion he done it he did it why he met God and listen when the troubles got hard and everything going wrong he remembered he had met God in that burning bush so that burning bush experience was not just an experience for that day it was an anchor point so that when the troubles came he can look back to the Anchor Point he could look back to his burning bush experience he had met God in that burning bush that burn in his heart listen to The Prophet no matter how bad the Egyptians got and how much they would let the children go how many times they call in the desert but Abraham said even when he was in a desert that burning bush experience was an anchor point for his soul everybody he said we were to God and wanted to Stone him and we won the flesh parts of Egypt that didn't bother him a bit he pressed on towards the promised land for he had met God in a burning bush oh God give me a burning bush experience so that could be a new anchor pointer if you've never had a burning bush

identifies you exactly where you're standing God's word Vindicated proved that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is just the same as it ever was on the day of Pentecost or any other time and Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and your attitude towards that identifies whether you have spiritual Amnesia or not and by the parliament preaching on spiritual and needs to talk about

kind of I was with him when he knew the reproach he had to stand by his brothers what he was I am what I am he was for We Are All One in Christ Jesus I was with Joseph in his grave I was with him when he went to the right hand of pharaoh you had to be identified with him [Applause] Hallelujah come on church we under home stretch we on the last stretch oh Hallelujah and this is what by the Anthony priest last Wednesday I was with Jacob that night when he wrestled all night with the angel so I could handle our all night for a meeting because I've identified that's an anchor point it's not strange for me because I know what it is I've wrestled myself I know what he went through with time so I wrestle with Jacob the same time healed for Amy's brother are you identified is that your Anchor Point could you hold on to that time do you know what it feels like is it the basis of your testimony Give the Lord a shout out praise I'm not done I'm close but ride with me oh hallelujah we're on the home stretch now the finish line is in view I was with Moses when he went down into Egypt I was with Moses at the burning bush in other words Moses burning bush experience is not just his Anchor Point it's my Anchor Point if you're a Christian you are identified with them Bible characters don't forget it if I was with Moses when all the people turned against him no wonder the prophet said he could turn your wife against you he could turn the church against you I'm identified it's an anchor point for me I could handle anything you know because all these anchor points are my anchor points and I can have faith to keep on pressing Faith to keep on fighting Faith to Keep On Believing I was with Moses when he crossed the Red Sea when he raised his hand and walked forward and the Red Sea opened I was identified in Christ right then I was with Moses at that hour oh Hallelujah but Abraham said whatever Christians has been whatever Believers has been every believer now is identified with that same person whatever it is you must be identified don't forget that when you do when you forget it you've got spiritual Amnesia you have forgotten who you are now identified with him I was with Elijah in the days of ihaba when they had to make a choice who they would serve God or belam we was with him on Mount Carmel that's my Anchor Point when he had to make this choice and today we have to make another choice will we serve God or will we go back to the world we'll remember the Lord or will we forget the world for we are identified data in the body of the same God that he was identified in oh hallelujah hallelujah I was with David when he was with Richard by his Brethren I was with David you were too if you are a Christian you have to be identified with his rejection I was with the Hebrew children in the fiery furnace so I could handle fire I could handle it I could handle it you could handle it too it's an anchor point [Music] come on Church come on elders come on deacons come on parents come on young people the fire couldn't burn them because of the presence of the fourth Manor I was with Daniela in the Lion's Den I was identified in there when the angel of the Lord identified him and there I was more surely with him at Calvary I must be identified with him at Calvary I must be there to a place that we're not us was I'm identified with him at Calvary I died with him at Calvary every Christian must die with him at Calvary if you don't die with him on Calvary you can't be none of his I was there when he died I died with him and then I was with him when he raised from the dead I come up on Easter morning with him in the resurrection whatever he did I was right there with him every believer every believer do we have Believers in the house this morning do we are believers in the church this morning I you identified do you know your anchor points [Music] I was with him on a day of Pentecost I was with the disciples that they identified with them in the baptism of the Holy Ghost [Music] I wonder if the church hasn't got amnesia so much now that they don't some of them don't even believe there's such a thing as the Holy Ghost see why the church has got a very bad case of amnesia they have forgotten that was Jesus Christ back there they have forgotten what Jesus Christ was they have forgotten they thought he was just a lawmaker or a prophet or a good man they forgot that he was God they forgot that he's the same yesterday today and forever I'm whining down and the church has got a bad case of spiritual Amnesia they have forgotten all these things they don't understand it no more foreign on the day of Pentecost I heard what he said I believe what he said I obeyed what he said now I'm identified in the same thing don't get spiritual Amnesia don't forget the always ask the elders about it it's the same Holy Ghost the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real today as it was in the day of Pentecost don't get spiritual Amnesia don't get comfortable don't just come to church to come to church we want a real experience it's real maybe you forgot what it felt like up but today May today be a new anchor point for you may today be a reminder of how good God is and how his promise is real foreign [Applause] because you will identify yourself with something else and that's what's happening all around the world happening in the message people have spiritual Amnesia and now Associated doctrines and teaching that so far removed from reality because they don't know who they are we was with the church when it was commissioned by Jesus Christ going into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature are you testifying to anybody you know everybody's a preacher you may not preach on the pulpits but you peace with your life your life is a sermon if you're a Christian you have to be doing this you know [Music] but everybody preached last Sunday a candle cubby hid but put it on top of the hill if you don't believe it then you have spiritual amnesia and you've forgotten the Lord you must be identified with Saint John 14 12 he that believeth with me the words that I do shall you also don't forget it if you do you've got spiritual amnesia you have forgotten what your testimony means you can't tell where you belong all you remains are Methodist I'm Baptist that's what I know about it I'm pentecostalam they said I'd watch out that may mean that the disease sign is showing on you that you've got some spiritual amnesia is all I can talk about is a group you belong to you have symptoms oh special amnesia because we're talking about the promises of God [Music] if you don't believe the sick could be healed you've got spiritual amnesia if you don't believe the party I'm reading a prophet if I don't he say you say I don't believe in a baptism of the Holy Ghost spiritual amnesia I don't believe that God promised to do these things in the last days then you have listened to a Creed or some Doctrine instead of the Bible you have a spiritual Amnesia you don't know where you belong Hallelujah that's the matter with the church today and that's the matter we kind of revivals doesn't matter with the people today this is 1964. they've been so drug over cause of everything and every ISM they can hatch up till they don't know what is right and wrong she can't remember the promise that's why you got to keep pleading the promise that's why Peter was saying I want to bring it back to your remembrance even though you know it that you're gonna be established in the present truth he said that what's the matter with Israel when Jesus come to the scene he said listen to this they could not remember Virgin supposed to conceive they could not remember that Moses said the Lord will raise up a prophet like unto me they had spiritual amnesia oh Hallelujah musicians can be gonna play something [Music] there's no scripture that says remember Moses remember David remember Joshua Samson died and I've preaches before many times but the Bible says remember that's why Jesus said that that's the one character the main character that just remember Lord's wife remember David he can actually remember Abraham you say you remember Lord's wife we don't have no name for her but we are commanded to remember her wife when I preached it before I said he could forget how to do algebra you could forget how to do literature you forget how to do history but whatever you do remember Lot's wife because she had an opportunity to forget her past and to remember what the Lord had done to take them out but she could not separate the promise of God from her past and she found herself looking back to where she come from I want to warn you and challenge you today Church young people parents don't look back let today be a day where you forget the world forget the past forget your whole life and you remember the Lord in a way you have never done before make him the center of your life I find myself guilty of not remembering him enough it's a consciousness of putting God first in every decision we take so much in ourselves that we want to decide for ourselves what we want to do but it's a real Consciousness to remember the Lord we learn to depend on our support system our family our jobs our salaries or the church whatever it is and the Lord is nowhere as he sends a point you know are you suffering from spiritual amnesia are you guilty because I know I'm I'm guilty he wants our all he wants a hundred percent imagine God find himself through scripture pleading with the people don't forget me remember what I did for you well last have you said Lord already thank you for what you did 10 years ago we live life not even looking back and saying oh God I even thank you enough in the story of Esther you remember when the king couldn't sleep he said read for me the Chronicles maybe that'll put me to sleep this was the records of all the memories and he's read and they're reading and they say wait a minute read that again for me I forget about that when Mordecai warned me of what he's been I didn't remember it what did we do for him because no good thing should go unrewarded [Music] everything you do for the Lord comes with a reward a blessing because God doesn't forget [Applause] but we forget so much we let our stresses in our lives get to us and then we live sometimes grumpy how could you be a sad Christian [Music] can't you find a reason to smile I don't care if it was 30 years ago Lord I Thank you for just taking me out of that situation [Applause] I look in this room today and I know how much testimonies I ceases are Mondays there and I know where she was on the hospital bed I watched sister run the day and I know when she wasn't here in the church to see God operate [Applause] and you want to tell me you can't find an anchor point to keep pressing you knew what it was like when your life was worse you can't tell me that you can praise
