[29:49] just want to thank God for his goodness
[29:52] and his mercy and his kindness and his
[29:55] faithfulness toward us
[29:57] amen
[30:03] I just have a couple a couple of things
[30:06] I'd like to share but before I do so
[30:09] let's just buy heads in a wood of Prayer
[30:14] and I want to read a prayer from
[30:17] the message of Church of the Living God
[30:19] and brother Brown opened this way and I
[30:22] just felt led to to pray this prayer
[30:24] this evening I think it's it's timely
[30:26] and applicable and just want to start
[30:28] off in this way amen if you'll just bar
[30:31] heads it says oh Heavenly Father
[30:35] we thank thee tonight that we can sing
[30:38] that from the depths of our heart Lord I
[30:40] believe
[30:41] and as a father with an epileptic son
[30:45] years ago said help thou my unbelief we
[30:48] hear this question asked one day when he
[30:50] returns will he find faith he never
[30:53] questioned whether he'd find
[30:54] righteousness or whether he he'd find
[30:57] Christians but would he find faith when
[30:59] he returned knowing that would be one
[31:01] thing people would let go on
[31:04] hearing also the Holy Spirit speaking in
[31:06] the last days and I believe he is now
[31:08] that how these times would come men
[31:11] would have a form of godliness but would
[31:13] deny the power lack of faith and we
[31:16] thank thee Lord tonight because in our
[31:18] hearts we feel that we have just a
[31:21] little faith and help us Lord that Faith
[31:24] may be increased tonight until it'll be
[31:26] so high so lost and complete surrender
[31:29] in Christ until Great and Mighty Works
[31:31] will be shown tonight we believe that
[31:34] tonight
[31:35] forgive us
[31:36] of all our shortcomings now and help us
[31:39] may the Holy Spirit just now the great
[31:41] officer of God here in the earth
[31:43] searching out for a bride for the Lord
[31:45] Jesus and may He tonight visit every
[31:48] heart in a special way for we ask it in
[31:50] the name of the beloved Son of God Jesus
[31:53] Christ amen you may have your seats
[31:57] amen my what almighty God we serve
[32:01] you know I I I love that song I just
[32:05] love what that stands for what a mighty
[32:07] God we serve in the good times and the
[32:09] bad times when we don't understand no
[32:11] matter how we feel no matter how things
[32:13] look it may look dark I might look
[32:15] gloomy but what a mighty God we serve
[32:18] tonight amen
[32:19] you know I have a simple thought and and
[32:22] just for for a title I'd say faith to
[32:26] unlock the promises of God
[32:28] you know Faith to unlock the promises of
[32:31] God and at this time I just want to want
[32:34] to thank the pastor for the opportunity
[32:36] for for being able to share tonight and
[32:39] and for the Liberty to speak this way
[32:41] and how many of you appreciate Sunday
[32:43] service brother Olu what a masterpiece I
[32:47] mean back-to-back week after week it was
[32:49] tremendous and and I just felt led to
[32:52] bring this thought on faith because you
[32:55] know it's it's so interesting that
[32:58] we know we're trying to say when the son
[33:00] of man comes shall he find faith on the
[33:02] earth and it it sounds like such a
[33:04] simplistic thing we have faith and and
[33:07] how difficult could this be
[33:09] you know and
[33:11] if we if we just stand for a minute and
[33:13] and just review the scriptures there we
[33:16] could read from the book of Hebrews
[33:18] chapter 11 just two verses
[33:24] and it says from Hebrews 11 verse 1
[33:28] it says no faith is a substance of
[33:31] things hoped for the evidence of Things
[33:34] Not Seen and if we were to move down to
[33:37] verse 6 it says but without faith it is
[33:39] impossible to please him for he that
[33:42] cometh to God must believe that he is
[33:44] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[33:47] diligently seek Him amen just bar heads
[33:50] once more o Heavenly Father we've read
[33:52] your word Lord we pray that you would
[33:53] breed life and say it Lord I pray that
[33:55] you would take me out of the way and
[33:56] you'll speak through me Lord speak live
[33:58] to heir to your people Lord Lord if
[34:00] there's anyone here Lord if there's
[34:02] anyone connected if there's anyone that
[34:04] will watch this step Lord I pray that
[34:06] you will raise them up that you'll build
[34:08] up their Faith Lord that you'll give
[34:09] them strength and power and
[34:11] understanding and an authority Lord Lord
[34:13] that they could unlock your promises
[34:15] that you've left for your people Lord
[34:16] Lord I pray that the words that would
[34:19] share tonight will find good ground in
[34:21] the hearts of a people and that lives
[34:23] will be changed and transformed by your
[34:25] Holy Spirit and by your power in Jesus
[34:27] name we pray amen you may have a seat
[34:29] once more you know and just just for
[34:32] context there we read what faith is
[34:33] because it seems like such a simple
[34:35] thing why would it be so difficult to
[34:38] find
[34:39] When Faith to some extent is even
[34:41] unconscious it's something that we
[34:43] practice all the time without even
[34:44] thinking about it yet you say when the
[34:47] son of man come shall he find faith on
[34:50] the Earth
[34:50] right it sounds almost paradoxical that
[34:54] something so simple would be so hard to
[34:56] find or fruit should be such a struggle
[34:58] to find and in the prayer and that's why
[35:01] I read it in the prayer brother Brandon
[35:03] actually said
[35:04] that's one thing that people would let
[35:06] go of
[35:08] and as a as I thought about it I
[35:10] realized you know
[35:12] it might seem so simple it may seem so
[35:15] little and almost insignificant you know
[35:18] it took Faith to come here tonight I
[35:20] mean we could say God predestinated that
[35:22] you'll be here and you had to be here to
[35:23] hear what you've heard but it took Faith
[35:25] to leave home and tell your loved ones
[35:27] you know what I'll be back later I'm
[35:29] coming back you know it took me to start
[35:32] that car out to get in that transport or
[35:34] that ride and it was unconscious we
[35:37] didn't have even have to think about it
[35:39] because of our experience because we
[35:42] automatically believe that it's gonna
[35:45] come to pass we believe we'll reach back
[35:46] home
[35:47] what if we don't
[35:49] I'm not here to frighten you now but I'm
[35:52] just showing how we use this everyday
[35:55] thing this nugget that is so special
[35:58] sometimes without a level of
[36:00] Consciousness so we have first of all
[36:03] what what we could deem unto unconscious
[36:05] Faith as a matter of fact
[36:08] in in a message Melchizedek the great
[36:11] Prince and King
[36:14] and here paragraph 48 brother brand
[36:16] himself said it this way he say just
[36:18] like you are come from your homes today
[36:19] they probably want to return to your
[36:21] homes
[36:22] told your wife or your loved ones I'll
[36:23] be back sometime right afternoon how do
[36:27] you know you are the same question as
[36:28] how do you know that he is faithful to
[36:32] to bring you here and Carry You Back
[36:34] Carry you to work and carry back home
[36:35] carrier to school or that doctor's
[36:37] appointment and back home how do you
[36:39] know no no that he said you don't try to
[36:42] wander have I got faith enough to go
[36:45] home you don't have I got enough to
[36:47] drive my car you're just unconsciously
[36:50] turn your key on drive one away and go
[36:53] home see it's the unconscious faith that
[36:57] does it
[36:58] that's the way it is in Christ we just
[37:00] unconsciously just say that's his word
[37:04] that just settles it there is no more to
[37:07] it and gone that's how they get well
[37:09] that's how people are healed that's how
[37:11] they're delivered that's how they're set
[37:13] free they just believe they just grab a
[37:15] hold of that Faith they don't think too
[37:17] much about it they don't try to figure
[37:19] it out as a matter of fact I may not get
[37:21] it but you said you know if you could
[37:22] figure it out you don't use Faith
[37:24] anymore you don't need Faith anymore
[37:26] because it becomes it becomes part of
[37:29] your logical thought it becomes part of
[37:33] of your construct your mental construct
[37:35] if you knew exactly how it worked you
[37:37] didn't have to trust God
[37:39] you didn't need faith faith is that
[37:41] thing that you can't hardly explain that
[37:44] you can't really understand but you
[37:46] believe in your heart that it's gonna
[37:48] happen
[37:50] and what reinforces that is because if
[37:52] he promises
[37:53] that thing to take place
[37:55] you could set your heart on it you could
[37:58] Bank on it and know it's gonna come to
[38:00] pass because he promises and keeps all
[38:04] his promises unlike you and I we can
[38:07] fail and fall and we could promise
[38:08] something today and we forget about it
[38:10] he doesn't forget
[38:11] your friends may tell you listen I'm
[38:13] gonna meet you at four o'clock and and
[38:15] using Trinity time quarter past four
[38:17] they're not there yet but not God he's
[38:19] always on time he's always faithful to
[38:21] deliver and once you catch a whole of
[38:23] the promise and you connected with faith
[38:25] I want to say faith is the key that
[38:27] unlocks that that cause it to be
[38:30] manifested
[38:31] oftentimes they ask but but listen
[38:35] how come this one got healed
[38:38] how come this one got delivered how come
[38:40] this one is restored we can't understand
[38:42] we've been in church for five years for
[38:44] 10 years for 20 years and it doesn't
[38:46] seem to happen to us and and the answer
[38:48] is always simple
[38:50] your faith the belief they took logic
[38:53] out of it they took knowledge out of it
[38:56] they talk history and experience out of
[38:58] it and they're tied into something that
[39:01] could cause something to happen that
[39:03] could cause the end result that could
[39:05] cause a manifestation to take place
[39:07] without thinking too much about how it
[39:09] shall be
[39:13] that's the kind of mighty God we serve
[39:15] that's why I love him it's hard to
[39:17] explain I can't even figure it out but I
[39:19] know it's true I know it works once you
[39:22] could grab a hold of that
[39:24] you know you would see the results come
[39:26] to pass but what I find was even more
[39:29] interesting is that
[39:32] Jesus spoke about different levels of
[39:34] Faith you know
[39:36] brother Branham he went in a little
[39:38] deeper to identify that
[39:41] I spoke of one type before that was
[39:43] unconscious Faith yeah the faith that
[39:45] you're not really thinking about it you
[39:47] think you know what I'm going downstairs
[39:48] and I'm going to come back up I go in
[39:50] for some water and coming back up you
[39:52] don't you don't think about that one too
[39:54] much that's unconscious right almost in
[39:56] your subconscious you just do it but
[39:58] there are different types so I call that
[40:01] one beginner Faith No it's not less than
[40:03] but it's beginner Faith it's faith that
[40:06] you don't have to work but can you
[40:08] imagine like like you want to to build
[40:10] body or you want to lift weeds also and
[40:12] you go to the gym the first day and they
[40:14] tell you well hear what you want just to
[40:15] start on the treadmill walk in a little
[40:18] bit it's something almost everybody
[40:19] could do everybody could do it
[40:22] you didn't have to practice you didn't
[40:24] have to train you didn't have experience
[40:25] you didn't have to see somebody else
[40:27] walk on it but you could do it it was
[40:29] almost subconscious because walking was
[40:31] something you were accustomed to amen so
[40:33] in this case
[40:34] they say this subconscious feat could
[40:37] happen without really see an example of
[40:40] it
[40:41] you don't need to see somebody go to
[40:42] church and go back home to know that you
[40:44] could do it too you don't need to see
[40:45] somebody drive a car and bring it back
[40:46] to know that you could do it too but but
[40:48] there are different levels of Faith so
[40:50] this one we want to move to is is is the
[40:53] kind of faith I call I call Fair true
[40:56] personal experience you know when you go
[40:58] through something and you go through
[41:00] something else and you'll go through
[41:02] something else and you know that you
[41:04] know that you know that God delivered
[41:06] your back then so you're gonna deliver
[41:08] your no and he's the same yesterday
[41:10] today and forever and if he was faithful
[41:12] to bring you out of this trial well
[41:15] listen this one here is chicken feed
[41:16] because because from personal experience
[41:19] I could tell it reminds me of David when
[41:22] he said listen who is this uncircumcised
[41:24] Philistine come to challenge the army of
[41:26] the Living God and he said listen listen
[41:28] from my personal experience let me tell
[41:30] you a story listen a bear came to
[41:33] interfere with my flocks and he
[41:35] delivered it a lion came to interfere
[41:38] with with my flocks and he delivered me
[41:40] so this uncircumcised Philistine in
[41:42] front of me true personal experience his
[41:46] faith this wasn't unconscious anymore
[41:48] this was a level of faith that was let's
[41:51] call it charged by personal experience
[41:53] it was at a higher level that he could
[41:56] look he never did this mind you mind you
[41:59] you have a seat he never did this fit
[42:02] before you know he never saw Philistines
[42:04] this large this was an anomaly this was
[42:08] strange this was different but you know
[42:10] what the principles of God remain the
[42:12] same if he could do it back then he
[42:15] could do it that day if he could do it
[42:17] for them he could do it for us if he
[42:20] could do it with him he could do it with
[42:21] me and that's the principle so through
[42:24] experience when he saw listen the beer
[42:26] the lion and I could testify about it
[42:28] personalize my story this is my story
[42:31] this is my song Nobody have to tell me
[42:33] nobody have to preach to me nobody have
[42:35] to show me in a book or tell me look
[42:38] look what happened here no but from
[42:40] personal experience he could grab a
[42:42] whole lot and no listen you're finished
[42:43] and chop your head off it's a finished
[42:46] work there's nothing that could stop him
[42:48] because his experience proved that his
[42:51] faith could be raised to defeat the
[42:53] enemy to deliver him out of that trial
[42:56] amen so I just want to read a couple of
[42:58] quotes here because I always say the
[43:00] prophet says it's better than I that
[43:02] than I can right
[43:04] so so he said now Simeon he believed
[43:08] because the Holy Ghost had promised him
[43:11] he was looking for it he was expecting
[43:14] it you got something behind that you
[43:16] believe that God had promised it then
[43:18] you got a writer expect it amen is that
[43:21] right when God promises it no I might
[43:24] break my promise cause I'm a man and
[43:26] your friend might break his promise or
[43:28] her promise but God won't break his own
[43:30] amen
[43:32] [Music]
[43:36] he can't because he's God can you
[43:38] imagine how pure unadulterated his
[43:41] promises are how infinite why if I'd go
[43:45] down to a spring and listen to the
[43:46] example if my grandfather drank out of
[43:50] that spring and it was clear
[43:52] and tested the water
[43:54] and it was a hundred percent pure and my
[43:58] father drink out of it and it was a
[44:00] hundred percent pure and all done
[44:02] through life I drank out of it and it
[44:04] was a hundred percent pure why I'd have
[44:07] enough Faith to go back and believe if I
[44:09] take a drink of the water it would be
[44:12] all right amen wouldn't you think they
[44:14] see him
[44:15] through the generations down through
[44:17] several Generations has been proven 100
[44:19] pure why because this stream that's
[44:22] gushing it up where it's coming from its
[44:25] foundations down there it's bad it's
[44:27] throwing up pure water now
[44:30] if it'll test 100 pure now listen to
[44:34] this how much more will the promise of
[44:36] God
[44:37] test 100 right because the basis of it
[44:41] God's word comes from God which is
[44:44] infinite and pure and holy and he can't
[44:46] lie but he's God there you are now when
[44:49] God promises anything that's right amen
[44:52] that's from expectations
[44:54] and and
[44:57] just know when I give the example of
[44:58] David we talk about personal experience
[45:01] and and the next way to say personal
[45:03] experiences is to call yourself a
[45:04] witness yeah and and and sometimes when
[45:08] we discuss crime you say we're looking
[45:10] for eyewitnesses we don't want
[45:12] somebody's story or somebody's version
[45:13] of what they think the hood you want
[45:16] their personal experience because they
[45:17] were there so David's Brothers could
[45:21] have said listen
[45:22] I go and challenge goliathanol because
[45:24] my brother does manage sheep and a beer
[45:27] came by my brother
[45:28] and he delivered you know God delivered
[45:31] him out and he hands and he they could
[45:33] have done that but there's nothing that
[45:35] beats its personal experience so he said
[45:39] he said you know
[45:41] in in the message with Witnesses
[45:46] he said I'm a witness of the power of
[45:48] God
[45:49] and this is David now a beer went up to
[45:52] grab a kid and I killed him he said and
[45:54] a lion run up and grabbed another I
[45:56] caught him by the whiskers and slayed
[45:58] him he said and the core that helped me
[46:00] to kill the bearded lion won't he much
[46:03] more give this uncircumcised Philistine
[46:06] into my hands Hallelujah in the days
[46:08] when they say the days of Miracles has
[46:10] passed when they say old-time religion
[46:12] won't take anymore that was something
[46:14] for Grandpa and Grandma and they say you
[46:16] know this this old-fashioned thing kind
[46:18] of like Moana you know you're preaching
[46:20] the same seven times over and over
[46:21] you're preaching the same it will reign
[46:23] over and over you're preaching the same
[46:25] promise of a Revival over and over it
[46:28] sounds like an old-fashioned thing but
[46:29] you say listen it sounds like something
[46:31] for Grandma and Grandpa brother I'm glad
[46:33] tonight that there is some witnesses of
[46:35] the old-fashioned Holy Ghost sky blue
[46:38] sin killing religion that kills out the
[46:41] very nature and the adamic powers of the
[46:43] devil and your heart can be clean
[46:46] hallelujah oh a witness so oh my you
[46:50] know some say that people are too noisy
[46:54] why they got something to be noisy about
[46:56] now you tell me if the God I serve is
[47:00] the same yesterday today and forever and
[47:03] brought his people out yesterday you
[47:06] don't think I ought to be jumping and
[47:08] shouting and rejoicing because it's the
[47:10] same yesterday today and forever so I
[47:13] have something to be be happy about to
[47:16] be shouting about to be praising and
[47:18] worshiping about and Thanksgiving and
[47:20] blessing his name because he's the same
[47:22] now listen I'll prove to you that the
[47:24] Bible religion has always been noisy yes
[47:28] and you know this one
[47:30] God told job where was you when job
[47:34] thought he was a great man you know you
[47:36] know where was you when I laid the
[47:38] foundation of the world someone the
[47:40] other day said brother Billy are you
[47:42] still preaching some of that new kind of
[47:45] religion you got he said no sir I'm
[47:48] preaching the oldest religion there ever
[47:50] was the only one that really is and got
[47:53] salvation in it some of that that new
[47:56] kind you said we didn't have that here a
[47:58] few years ago he said let me tell you
[47:59] brother it's older than the world is you
[48:01] know before the world was framed it was
[48:04] there that's right where was you when I
[48:07] lay the foundation out of the world when
[48:09] the morning Stars sang together and the
[48:11] sons of God shouted for joy
[48:14] [Applause]
[48:15] amen
[48:17] millions of years before the foundation
[48:19] of the worldly man that's right that
[48:21] that that is what a witness does a
[48:24] witness was there so when God asked Joe
[48:26] where were you
[48:28] he was there
[48:30] so he is a real witness of what's taking
[48:32] place
[48:33] you know so so I highlighted at that
[48:35] level of faith is different it's not
[48:37] it's not the unconscious one that's the
[48:39] one true personal experience and I give
[48:42] you the illustration with the gym
[48:44] because when you start in the gym it may
[48:45] seem very simple
[48:47] you go and and by the way I'm not a gym
[48:50] guy at all but you go and you walk and
[48:53] you walk you walk but see you three
[48:56] years from now you're not walking
[48:57] anymore you're living you're doing curls
[49:00] or bench press or whatever the terms are
[49:02] you're doing the big things you're
[49:03] lifting up things that other folks will
[49:06] watch and see well who
[49:08] how is she doing that boy but you see
[49:10] it's training it's practice
[49:14] test it's personal experience now
[49:16] if I sit on the sidelines and say you
[49:18] know what punch
[49:21] you can live 100 pounds and you say yeah
[49:23] that don't make me laugh 100 pounds
[49:25] if I don't go in the gym if I don't
[49:28] practice I will never be able to do so
[49:31] which is why later on and hope to get to
[49:33] it he will say faith without works is
[49:35] dead
[49:36] so you can believe you have to do it I
[49:38] could watch it and say if you could do
[49:39] it I can that's words you know right
[49:42] unless action goes along with that or
[49:44] behind it
[49:45] [Applause]
[49:46] so
[49:47] so sometimes
[49:50] I say there are different levels of
[49:52] Faith different types of Faith this one
[49:54] I want to call faith based on the
[49:56] experience of others
[49:58] and it may seem contradictory to what I
[50:00] say before but it's different types
[50:02] understand me it's not better than or
[50:05] worse than but it's different types the
[50:07] same way you say you would bless
[50:08] different people according to their
[50:09] measure so so different persons they
[50:12] have a different gift it doesn't make it
[50:13] better or worse but it's different so we
[50:15] appreciate them all so in this case
[50:17] there is faith that could be could be
[50:20] built through the experience of others
[50:22] so we're not discounting that right so
[50:24] listen
[50:27] in a message faith without works is dead
[50:31] hear what he said
[50:33] talking about Divine Healing he said and
[50:37] Divine Healing is
[50:40] it isn't saying a few mystery words over
[50:42] somebody and hypnotizing it's the truth
[50:44] revealed through Jesus Christ his Divine
[50:46] Healing that's what it is that's right
[50:49] gifts of the Spirit are brought down to
[50:51] edify or other words
[50:53] it's a flag of flying over the top of
[50:56] the building it's the appearance of the
[50:58] outsider attract people in out of the
[51:01] rain see what I mean now gifts come from
[51:03] God they are from God they'll testify of
[51:06] God and God will testify of them is that
[51:08] true if you are sick pray until you
[51:11] believe in all your heart did you ever
[51:13] just pray for something just know what
[51:15] node you are going to get it that's
[51:18] Faith you know let me give you a
[51:20] personal testimony right here and
[51:21] brother Anthony is a witness as well you
[51:23] know this evening I came home
[51:27] and for some strange reason I I do get
[51:31] headaches at all I told my wife I said
[51:33] listen I have the worst headache ever I
[51:35] said I don't know what it is I have a
[51:36] headache I have a headache no it's so
[51:38] bad
[51:40] my lack of headaches that I do take
[51:42] pills for headaches I do have tablets
[51:44] for headaches right so I do get them at
[51:46] all but this evening whole evening for
[51:48] two three hours straight after
[51:52] so I told her son I'm going up to church
[51:54] early
[51:55] I said because I have a headache now
[51:57] mind you are just trying to be contrary
[52:00] and opposite to what what is expected I
[52:02] haven't I had it so I dress early and I
[52:05] said I'm coming up early
[52:06] because I have a headache I reach up to
[52:08] church and I still have a headache and I
[52:10] say you know what as I'm coming up I got
[52:13] some let's refer to it as negative news
[52:15] some something that should throw more
[52:17] for a little bit I say you know what God
[52:19] is good
[52:20] I have a headache I see this but you
[52:23] know what bless God anyhow
[52:25] we're going to do this
[52:27] came up
[52:28] Anthony came and you heard me play and
[52:30] and brother Anthony said you know how
[52:32] things different things look I say about
[52:34] it to me I said listen if you know I
[52:37] have to lose headache right now I have a
[52:39] real terrible headache he asked me so
[52:40] you take tablets if I say no I say
[52:42] listen here's what's going on I said no
[52:44] matter what I say I feel you know
[52:47] there's no way things could just stuck I
[52:50] see I'm just watching them stuck when I
[52:51] see the negativity stuck when I see the
[52:53] bad and I was really upset and I know
[52:54] this is not normal I am in church every
[52:56] Wednesday and no headache I'm in church
[52:58] on Sundays no headache I say something
[53:00] had I had a break or something had to be
[53:02] special something had to be different
[53:03] you know I came up here and played and
[53:06] while playing I decided to sing you know
[53:09] my head they're gone gone clean before I
[53:12] reach up here I had it gone at one point
[53:14] I forgot I had a headache I forgot I
[53:16] came up with a headache
[53:18] part of that part of that is belief that
[53:21] listen Nothing Gonna Stop Me tonight you
[53:23] know nothing is going to stop this word
[53:25] from coming forward
[53:26] [Music]
[53:27] [Applause]
[53:29] knock me down but I get them back up
[53:32] you're knocking me to the side but I'm
[53:34] bouncing back no matter how bad I feel
[53:36] how upset I get what go wrong I said
[53:39] listen not tonight or No not tonight
[53:41] Nothing is Stopping me tonight from
[53:43] doing what I set out to do whatever God
[53:47] has predestinated for tonight must be
[53:50] accomplished it's not by my might not by
[53:54] power but by his Spirit nothing is going
[53:56] to stop his word nothing is going to
[53:59] stop your faith from growing and billing
[54:01] and being able to reach out and and hold
[54:04] on to the promises of God Amen
[54:07] oh my Lord
[54:11] you may have your seats
[54:15] you know I just want to to run down a
[54:17] little bit more
[54:19] you know as he spoke about praying you
[54:22] know see you're just pre-prey until
[54:25] until you know that you know it's going
[54:27] to happen you say that's Faith why are
[54:29] you praying for deliverance imagine that
[54:31] you're praying to be healed you know
[54:33] you're not feeling well you know you're
[54:34] not sick you know your condition at home
[54:36] I don't know but you know it and you're
[54:38] praying you know why you pray you pray
[54:40] because you believe God
[54:42] God is going to intervene he's going to
[54:44] bypass your neighbor to come into your
[54:47] home to come into your heart to come
[54:49] into your house into your scenario into
[54:52] your situation you may think you know
[54:54] what I might be lonely I might be small
[54:57] I might be simple but you see the God I
[54:59] serve is so mighty he's so big he could
[55:02] watch out and see and listen he's
[55:04] attracted to Faith but a brand new
[55:07] moments or often times on the healing
[55:09] line you know he would he would stand on
[55:11] the outside and you say you know what
[55:14] you don't need to be on the platform
[55:16] and while speaking here he will say you
[55:18] know what stand up you're just healed
[55:21] right what what caused that
[55:24] kind of fate
[55:26] that could pull the Holy Spirit to you
[55:28] is the same yesterday Faith to Dear
[55:32] Faith forever fate that's what we want
[55:34] to build that's that's what you want to
[55:36] exercise you want to exercise your faith
[55:39] you want to exercise this gift that God
[55:42] has given you this sense that you have
[55:45] to reach out and and we read it earlier
[55:48] in Hebrews 11 verse 1 the substance of
[55:51] things hoped for
[55:53] evidence of things that are not seen so
[55:55] so imagine no one never saw rain before
[55:59] rain never fell but he believed the word
[56:03] of God that's what he stood on you know
[56:05] he stood on the word of God it was not
[56:07] secondhand experience it was God told me
[56:10] Abraham was the same we call him the
[56:12] father of faith God Almighty he said
[56:15] listen I will return to you according to
[56:17] the time of life and we heard it last
[56:19] Sunday how much years he waited and
[56:21] years upon years upon years and and he
[56:23] didn't see Generations yet and and and
[56:25] as it progressed you will understand
[56:28] that listen the Fate was not feeling you
[56:31] know
[56:31] this fate wasn't you know what yeah what
[56:34] happened good today today is Wednesday
[56:36] middle of the week week on what's done
[56:38] no it wasn't afternoon it was a belief
[56:41] deep down in your heart that nothing
[56:42] could shaken nothing could move so when
[56:45] you stand on that when those old Saints
[56:48] stood and praying and those apostles
[56:51] were in prison they prayed and they
[56:53] prayed and they prayed they prayed only
[56:55] more without cease and you know why
[56:57] because they knew because they served
[56:59] was able to deliver the god they served
[57:01] was able to to break the bands of of
[57:04] death and hell and Grave so what what is
[57:08] a physical prison
[57:09] that was nothing to the power of God so
[57:12] their Fair true experience could be so
[57:15] mature so writing so strengthened that
[57:17] they could just execute and activate it
[57:19] almost instantaneously at will
[57:26] [Applause]
[57:32] you know
[57:36] I just want to shift a little bit
[57:37] because I know time is running
[57:42] Glory
[57:43] we talk about we talk about
[57:47] faith and you know it's such a powerful
[57:49] thing to think that
[57:51] he come in looking for this thing he's
[57:54] not coming to ask if you're tired much
[57:56] in your clothes or what was your fashion
[57:58] sense and and how how dramatic things
[58:01] were in 2023 or if you came to church
[58:04] the Wednesday after Carnival what he
[58:06] wants to know is listen
[58:08] do you do you stand on my word do you
[58:11] believe me do you have such a level of
[58:15] belief that it goes beyond everybody
[58:18] else in my family choosing to stay home
[58:20] tonight or or this this this thing seems
[58:24] like too much for me to endure he want
[58:26] to see the effort he want to see how
[58:28] much you really interested in getting
[58:30] this thing think about it Abraham had
[58:32] options you know after a year or two he
[58:34] gonna walk away and say but you see this
[58:36] thing I tried this good thing yes I try
[58:38] to sing I I wait one year I will two
[58:41] years
[58:42] but
[58:44] keep in mind we're talking about
[58:46] building faith to be able to unlock the
[58:50] promises of God we haven't even fully
[58:52] explored the promises of God but when
[58:54] you think that that God through Malachi
[58:57] 4 left promises open in this spoken word
[59:02] for his end time bride that we have to
[59:05] by faith reach out and grab and claim to
[59:07] be our own we need to have this strength
[59:10] we need to have the fortitude we need to
[59:12] have the ability to reach out and claim
[59:14] that and make it ours and make it ours
[59:18] today not tomorrow not not you know that
[59:22] was back then he preached about that
[59:23] that was back then you see if that was
[59:26] the approach we wouldn't be able to read
[59:28] the scriptures we read today because
[59:31] when you think about the prophet Isaiah
[59:34] prophesied on and for about 400 years
[59:37] nothing happened
[59:38] think about that
[59:39] what kind of feet
[59:42] these wise men had
[59:43] to know that you know what
[59:46] almighty God
[59:48] promise that this predestinated time
[59:51] send us sign so Messiah could be born in
[59:54] a particular place that they are willing
[59:56] to leave their land from the East and
[59:59] travels such a far distance just to know
[1:00:02] that that is the manifestation of God's
[1:00:05] word they had a awesome level of faith
[1:00:08] and and this is not just a harp on the
[1:00:10] fact that different people all over the
[1:00:12] place had Faith because ultimately we
[1:00:15] are challenged as individuals that build
[1:00:18] our faith to ensure that we as
[1:00:20] individuals could claim our promises
[1:00:22] because
[1:00:24] I mean I I I I I know sometimes they
[1:00:27] call it spoiler alert
[1:00:29] when when you know you're kind of making
[1:00:31] the obvious real to everybody before you
[1:00:34] can see it so I just want to give you a
[1:00:37] spoiler alert
[1:00:39] God not come in foreign
[1:00:54] or if you're skirt about a foot below
[1:00:57] your knee you are the ones are looking
[1:00:58] for that wasn't his requirement you know
[1:01:00] just like in Moses days when you say
[1:01:02] listen put me to
[1:01:06] where Solomon commitment but I find
[1:01:08] Faith would I find people who you know
[1:01:11] just have a former godliness they just
[1:01:14] like to come to church because it looks
[1:01:16] good and it makes them feel good because
[1:01:18] they perhaps retired and have nowhere
[1:01:20] else to go so if they come to the
[1:01:22] Tabernacle they will at least look like
[1:01:24] the ending the in the group they in the
[1:01:27] crew know these people had such a a a
[1:01:31] confidence in God's word that they could
[1:01:34] rest their faith on his word and walk
[1:01:37] away knowing
[1:01:38] if it take two days
[1:01:41] ten days two months 20 years 25 years it
[1:01:45] doesn't matter because I have such a
[1:01:47] faith that he could deliver me out of
[1:01:50] the the the the belly of the whale out
[1:01:52] of the fiery furnace from the Lion's Den
[1:01:55] I've seen examples of the past that I
[1:01:58] could stand upon right so outside of
[1:02:01] your unconscious feet which you have on
[1:02:04] the inside God shows that listen there
[1:02:08] are things you could do to build your
[1:02:09] feet you know
[1:02:12] so so when you read God's word what do
[1:02:15] you think you're doing practice in
[1:02:17] English
[1:02:19] you could do that too but it's
[1:02:21] your linear Faith because faith comes by
[1:02:25] hearing and hearing Heidi
[1:02:28] right so when you come to church what do
[1:02:30] you think you're doing
[1:02:33] signing up your your at a social
[1:02:35] Gathering you know there are some some
[1:02:37] folks that go to the bank not because
[1:02:39] they have money in the bank but because
[1:02:41] their friends just go for pension and
[1:02:42] things so they lime around the bank no
[1:02:44] this is not what God has called you have
[1:02:46] to do you know God has really called you
[1:02:49] to train you we heard even on Sunday you
[1:02:51] say you don't go medical school to come
[1:02:52] out as a student you know you'll go
[1:02:54] medical school to become a doctor you
[1:02:56] don't go law school to say whatever I
[1:02:58] went alone school for 10 years listen
[1:03:01] boy I extend my project my project I
[1:03:03] drag it out you know no that's not the
[1:03:05] purpose of going you go to law school
[1:03:08] so when we come
[1:03:11] become word of God day in day out Sunday
[1:03:14] Wednesday Friday Tuesday we hear
[1:03:17] exhortation testimonies messages we
[1:03:20] listen to our team we preach life
[1:03:21] however come that is meant to really
[1:03:24] build your faith build your confidence
[1:03:27] in the word of God nothing man nothing
[1:03:30] me not in the pastor no you have to have
[1:03:33] confidence in the past say yes but the
[1:03:35] word of God is what you stand upon so
[1:03:37] your faith is built on that is hinge or
[1:03:40] not is resting on that amen
[1:03:48] now in a message keeps it to the door
[1:03:51] he says I know Jesus as he daughter all
[1:03:53] things
[1:03:54] and faith is a key that unlocks our door
[1:03:57] you know I call his faith faith through
[1:03:59] knowledge and understanding
[1:04:01] because you know it have the Fate where
[1:04:03] yeah yeah I believe I believe yeah I
[1:04:06] believe
[1:04:07] but God sometimes calls you to a little
[1:04:10] more than that
[1:04:11] she said no Jesus is a daughter all
[1:04:13] things and faith is the key that unlocks
[1:04:15] our door now if Jesus is the door to all
[1:04:18] these promises of God which is where are
[1:04:19] we going now
[1:04:21] fit in his finish worked on locks every
[1:04:24] door to every treasure there is inside
[1:04:26] the kingdom of God see it let me read
[1:04:29] that once more
[1:04:30] now Jesus is a door to all these things
[1:04:34] and faith is the key that unlocks the
[1:04:37] door
[1:04:38] now if Jesus is a daughter all these
[1:04:41] promises of God faith in his Finnish
[1:04:44] work
[1:04:45] unlocks every door to every treasure
[1:04:48] there is inside kingdom of God see it
[1:04:51] Kia's faith is the key that unlocks
[1:04:55] every promise he makes
[1:04:57] the key of Faith does that
[1:05:00] in his Finnish work it's these keys that
[1:05:02] we're speaking on
[1:05:04] now in Hebrews 11 chapter
[1:05:06] I got a great string of them wrote down
[1:05:08] there as you know that's a that's a
[1:05:10] chapter where we describe the Heroes of
[1:05:12] Faith
[1:05:13] and he says it was the key to the door
[1:05:16] that stopped the mouth of lions it was a
[1:05:18] key thing that unlocked the prison
[1:05:19] houses it was a faith the key of faith
[1:05:21] that quenched the violence of fire
[1:05:23] escape the edge of the sword brought the
[1:05:26] dead back to life again it was the fear
[1:05:28] the key of faith and the Living God that
[1:05:30] hand that man that woman who can take
[1:05:32] the key of Faith they can unlock every
[1:05:35] promise God make but you haven't got
[1:05:37] that key you're just frogging you'll
[1:05:40] never unlock it you'll beat against it
[1:05:43] if you haven't got that key you're
[1:05:45] wasting time because you're just
[1:05:47] knocking against the door you're just
[1:05:49] banging against the door
[1:05:51] any correct made key has levers on the
[1:05:54] inside of the lock
[1:05:56] and it takes a certain form a certain
[1:05:58] shape of them keys to turn those levers
[1:06:01] and just one little lever out of the way
[1:06:04] will mess the whole thing up
[1:06:06] therefore I believe in the Full Gospel
[1:06:09] every word of God that turns the power
[1:06:12] of God loose that turns his Blessing to
[1:06:15] the people it's the key to the door that
[1:06:17] unlocks it oh those great Heroes those
[1:06:19] prophets and great men of the Bible they
[1:06:22] had that key that's the reason they
[1:06:24] could stop them out of lions quench
[1:06:25] violence of fire escape the edge of the
[1:06:27] sword bring the dead back to life again
[1:06:29] and do all kind of Miracles is because
[1:06:32] they held that key and they know that
[1:06:34] work because it was a scripture born key
[1:06:37] so that's what I was getting at before
[1:06:39] it was a scripture born key this is not
[1:06:42] your own thoughts and ideas this is not
[1:06:44] the mindset of man and you feel to tell
[1:06:47] a story and you feel this and you feel
[1:06:49] this is not about feelings this is about
[1:06:51] the word of God this is about God's
[1:06:54] living written word that you could read
[1:06:56] and develop and you could see that
[1:06:59] strength in your face and continue to
[1:07:00] build your faith
[1:07:05] I'm almost done
[1:07:07] I'm not going to keep you long at all
[1:07:10] you know there's a there's a message
[1:07:12] where Brian preached called the second
[1:07:14] miracle
[1:07:16] and this is exactly where I started
[1:07:19] he said you know some people has great
[1:07:22] big feet like this
[1:07:25] anything can happen
[1:07:27] the next has faith that deep
[1:07:30] takes a little longer
[1:07:32] the next recipe that deep takes quite a
[1:07:34] little while
[1:07:35] some has fit like a mustard seed but if
[1:07:38] it's a Mustard Seed Faith genuine Faith
[1:07:41] hold on to it
[1:07:43] just keep believing it it'll become
[1:07:46] marble faith
[1:07:47] then it'll become grapefruit Faith then
[1:07:50] it'll become Mountain fate
[1:07:52] it'll bring you right out if you just
[1:07:55] stay with it
[1:07:57] hold on to it it'll bring you right
[1:08:00] straight to the light if you'll stay
[1:08:02] with it you know what I call this I call
[1:08:04] this Faith through patience it's easy to
[1:08:07] get distracted it's easy to get this
[1:08:09] tubed it's easy to be thrown off
[1:08:12] but sometimes you have to keep your eye
[1:08:14] on the target keep your eye on the prize
[1:08:16] when God say it will rain it took 120
[1:08:20] years it was easy for somebody after
[1:08:23] five years to say Noah yeah we're going
[1:08:25] on
[1:08:25] we believe you know
[1:08:28] yeah let's preach real good
[1:08:30] they're preaching the same thing for
[1:08:32] five years but instead of a boot we have
[1:08:34] a different idea what if we build a big
[1:08:37] house
[1:08:39] that could rule everybody
[1:08:41] that wasn't the commission that God had
[1:08:43] given
[1:08:45] his feet was resting on the word of God
[1:08:48] and the promise of God to him
[1:08:50] so he had to stay focused on listen God
[1:08:53] said so
[1:08:54] God Said So no matter what the external
[1:08:57] voices say no matter what the detractors
[1:08:59] say no matter what the neighbor said it
[1:09:02] might be a good friend or your family
[1:09:04] your relative you know but he had to
[1:09:06] stay focused he had to have patience he
[1:09:08] had to run this race knowing that the
[1:09:10] race wasn't for the swiftest that this
[1:09:12] fate base race was one that was hinged
[1:09:15] to patience and he had to hold on
[1:09:17] knowing that God who was faithful to to
[1:09:22] make this promise was more than able to
[1:09:25] deliver and bring it to pass you know so
[1:09:28] no matter the example you use you will
[1:09:31] see sometimes and he identified here he
[1:09:34] says some people feel big
[1:09:36] some people like you would often hear
[1:09:39] they come you want to be healed and
[1:09:41] you're healed instantaneously and
[1:09:44] Barbara also talks about time of span
[1:09:46] Miracles huh sometimes you have to wait
[1:09:48] a little bit
[1:09:50] sometimes you have to be tested a little
[1:09:52] bit
[1:09:52] sometimes you have to be I call it
[1:09:54] tortured a little bit some people either
[1:09:56] talk about you to say listen you still
[1:09:58] believe that you know a hundred years
[1:10:00] past I know I still believe a good Henry
[1:10:02] no no generation after generation you're
[1:10:04] going on to three generations and he's
[1:10:07] still preaching the same thing you know
[1:10:08] but you know what
[1:10:10] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:10:12] forever his promises are still the same
[1:10:14] and they never fail it's up to us
[1:10:17] I would Loosely say as a church but
[1:10:20] directly as individuals to build our
[1:10:23] faith to be able to grab a hole and
[1:10:26] catch a hole of all he promises he sets
[1:10:29] out and lay out for us
[1:10:31] you know it's not even my nose but I
[1:10:33] remember reading it earlier I believe
[1:10:36] it's in fear to the substance
[1:10:38] and brother Branham said you know
[1:10:40] there's a scripture that Jesus said hear
[1:10:43] what Greater Works and these shall ye do
[1:10:46] because I go unto my father right sure
[1:10:49] we know it you're students of the Bible
[1:10:50] huh
[1:10:52] and he went on to explain that this
[1:10:54] greater
[1:10:55] is not better than Christ you know
[1:10:58] you say because we as individuals as
[1:11:02] humans as mere mortals we can do and or
[1:11:06] do Christ
[1:11:08] we can all do his works
[1:11:10] right so it's not a matter of competing
[1:11:13] with God it's not a matter of competing
[1:11:16] with Christ but you know what he said he
[1:11:18] said when you look at Christ's life
[1:11:19] Christ had a very very specific time
[1:11:21] period to do all his miracles very very
[1:11:23] specific right from here to here if you
[1:11:26] say from 18 to 30 it was it was a period
[1:11:29] of silence and you walk with them for
[1:11:30] three and a half years so he had this
[1:11:32] period to do all the Miracles that we
[1:11:34] could speak of now
[1:11:36] he said but you know when the scripture
[1:11:38] said greater than thee shall ye do he
[1:11:41] say if you look at the original
[1:11:42] translation for greater it wasn't better
[1:11:44] it wasn't it it was more advanced
[1:11:48] but he said it referred to more more in
[1:11:51] quantity so I tell you that to inspire
[1:11:54] to uplift to build to motivate because
[1:11:57] when you think about it we look at Jesus
[1:11:59] in awe and say he healed sick and he
[1:12:02] raised it dead and lucky cause he blind
[1:12:04] to see and look he he did this and he
[1:12:06] did that and that Creator but imagine in
[1:12:09] your life now he gave you a promise that
[1:12:12] you could do more than that
[1:12:14] so we're not talking about raise one
[1:12:17] person
[1:12:20] more
[1:12:21] yeah we are talking about heal one sick
[1:12:23] person
[1:12:24] more not deliver one child that going
[1:12:27] astray more right he listened at Italian
[1:12:32] beginning my God is so mighty what a
[1:12:36] mighty God we serve that he gave us a
[1:12:38] promise that listen in this time in this
[1:12:42] season in this hour in this age you're
[1:12:44] gonna see more and more and more but to
[1:12:48] catch a hole like that you can't use it
[1:12:50] the itty-bitty fit you need to be able
[1:12:52] to build your feet on different levels
[1:12:54] to ensure that you could grab a hold of
[1:12:58] everything that is for you I don't know
[1:13:00] about you but like Caleb said give me my
[1:13:03] Mountain it seems selfish but he had to
[1:13:07] look after his interests at that point
[1:13:08] in in other words you are saying I'm not
[1:13:11] leaving this alone I want all
[1:13:14] and that's the attitude I want you to
[1:13:16] leave here with tonight that listen if
[1:13:19] healing is yours you need to claim
[1:13:21] healing tonight you want all you don't
[1:13:25] want to leave some of your children in
[1:13:27] the world and some of them in church you
[1:13:29] want all like when Moses was leaving
[1:13:31] Egypt and and faith and if you return to
[1:13:35] them and say listen take your cattle
[1:13:36] Take A Flock you see them fig tree or
[1:13:39] plants move it up too take everything
[1:13:41] take defense take a pose take the pillar
[1:13:45] take the foundation move it everything
[1:13:48] he said not one listen Moses said not
[1:13:52] one hope should be left behind we don't
[1:13:55] want to leave somebody limping no we're
[1:13:57] taking everything all is yours all

[1:15:49] you're still pressing forward you want
[1:15:51] to do that over and over why because he
[1:15:53] promised more more greater than these
[1:15:57] shall you do so your faith must be
[1:15:59] lifted to such a level that when the son
[1:16:01] of man cometh he gonna find faith in you
[1:16:03] he's gonna find your fit matured and
[1:16:07] active not dormant and a lion dog and a
[1:16:10] poor sister come out to service no no no
[1:16:13] no no no no no no no no you know listen
[1:16:15] like Simeon Simeon was to say no no
[1:16:17] Simeon had a promise Simeon believed
[1:16:20] that listen I will not see death till I
[1:16:24] see the Lord's Christ so he is not
[1:16:26] staying home hoping that you know what I
[1:16:28] will hear about it perhaps when they
[1:16:30] make the announcements they will
[1:16:32] dedicate a baby and the next service I
[1:16:34] will come no he not waiting or not he's
[1:16:37] standing by the temple day in day out
[1:16:40] night in night out having faith that God
[1:16:44] who promised this is able to manifest it
[1:16:47] in his time in his life amen so he not
[1:16:50] come in for a group
[1:16:51] listen
[1:16:53] listen
[1:16:55] I wrote this one down and I want to read
[1:16:57] it
[1:16:58] listen he not doing an audit of how much
[1:17:01] books and tips you have home right
[1:17:04] he not checking how many how many on the
[1:17:07] lines or highlighters you're right
[1:17:09] through the Bible right that's not what
[1:17:12] you're checking
[1:17:13] he's not concerned about if if you're
[1:17:15] two hours early or three hours early
[1:17:18] because you could have a form of
[1:17:21] godliness
[1:17:22] think about it but denying the very
[1:17:25] power denying the faith because you
[1:17:29] think you could figure it out so you
[1:17:30] want to sit down and judge you want to
[1:17:32] sit down and Mark your own papers you
[1:17:34] want to sit down and do it like as much
[1:17:36] like as an exact science and you say
[1:17:38] listen if that's what what you're doing
[1:17:39] you don't need me you gotta work it out

[1:18:02] I I could assure you I never check it
[1:18:04] but Elon Musk compared to my God
[1:18:06] hero Ali kind of resources my God half
[1:18:09] my God could provide anything I need
[1:18:12] anything you need you're not selfish

[1:35:09] don't mind wait
[1:35:13] don't mind
[1:35:15] [Music]
