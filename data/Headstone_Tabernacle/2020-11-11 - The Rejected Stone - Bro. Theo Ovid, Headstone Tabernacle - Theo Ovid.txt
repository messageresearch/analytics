fall in the other night bring deliverance father break bands of wickedness and the evil and set every captive free in the name of jesus we ask it amen god bless you thanks for coming we are glad to be here tonight we want to go into the word tonight uh we have two portions of scripture like to read isaiah chapter 28. we want to read from verse 5 to 22. we also want to read from acts chapter 4 i want to read 1-21 reading from isaiah chapter 28 verse 5 in that day shall the lord of hosts be for a crown of glory and for a diadem of beauty unto the residue of his people and for a spirit of judgment to him that sitted in judgment and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate but they have also have heard through wine and through strong drinker out of the way the priest and the prophet have heard too strong drink they are swallowed up of wine they are out of the way through strong drink they er envision they stumble in judgment for all tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there is no place clean whom shall he teach knowledge and whom shall he make to understand doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast for precept must be upon precept piece upon precept line up online line up online here a little dear little for his tamarind lips another tongue will he speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest rarity may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear but the word of the lord was unto them precept upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here little dear little that they might go and fall backward and be broken and sneered and taken wherefore hear the word of the lord these countful men that rule this people which in jew is in jerusalem because you have said we have made a covenant with debt and with hell are we at agreement when the overflowing squad shall pass through it shall not come unto us for we have made lies our refuge and under falsehood have we hid ourselves therefore thus saith the lord god behold zion for foundation a stone a tried stone a precious corner stone a sure foundation he that believeth shall not make haste judgment also will i lay to the line unrighteousness to the plummet and the heel shall sweep away the refuge of lies and the water shall overflow the hidden place and your covenant with death shall be dishonored and your agreement with hell shall not stand when the overflowing scourge shall pass through then he shall be trotted on by it from the time that is going forth it shall take you for morning by morning shall it pass over by day and by night and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report for the bed is shorter than a man can stretch himself on it and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it for the lord shall rise up as in mong perism he shall be wrought as in the valley of gibeon that he may do his work his strange work and bring to pass his act his stranger now therefore be not mockers least your hands be made strong for i have heard from the lord god of hosts a consumption even determined upon the whole earth in acts chapter 4 and this is after the layman walked through the power of god flowing through peter and this is uh chapter four verse one another they spake unto the people the priest the captain of the temple the sadducees came upon them being grieved that they taught the people and preached through jesus the resurrection from the dead and to lay hands on them and put them in whole for the next day for it was now evening time how be it many of them which heard a word believed and the number of men was about five thousand and it came to pass on the moral that the rulers and elders and scribes and annas the high priest and kaiphus and john and alexander and as many as of the kindred of the high priest were gathered together jerusalem when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power or by what name have you done this then peter filled with the holy ghost said unto them he rulers of the people and elders of israel if we this day be examined of the good deed done to this impotent man by what means he is made whole be it known unto you all and to all the people of israel that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom he crucified whom god raised from the dead even by him that this man stand here before you whole this is the stone which was set at note of you builders which has become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name among heaven given among men whereby we must be saved now when they saw the boldness of peter and john and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marveled and they took knowledge of them that they have been with jesus and behold in the man which was healed standing with them they could see nothing against it but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council they conferred among themselves saying what shall we do to these men for that indeed is a notable miracle had been done by them is manifest to all of them that dwell in jerusalem and we cannot deny it but that it spread to unfold among the people let us straightly threaten them that they speak henceforth to no man in this name they call them and commanded them not to speak at all or teach in the name of jesus but peter and john answered and said unto them whether it be right in the sight of god to hack unto you more than under god judgey for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard so when they had further threatened them they let them go finding nothing how they might punish them because of the people for all men glorify god for that which was done that's about his father we thank you for your word tonight interpreted to us lord take me out of the way and speak liberty to your people in jesus name i ask it amen you may be seated o praise the name of the lord uh that scripture we read the first scripture from isaiah that verse 22 now therefore be muckers at least your hands be made strong for i have heard the lord god of hosts a consumption even determined upon the whole earth and the amplifier that reads now therefore do not be scuffers least the bands which bind you be made strong for a decree of destruction have i heard from the lord of hosts upon the whole land and upon the whole earth a decree of destruction tonight our title the rejected stone have inspiration the spirit of christ operating in our bodies that's a title the spirit of christ operating in our bodies now we know the prophet prophesied a woman would be in power president or vice president before the annihilation or or destruction this was prophesied by vision since 1933 ms also said maybe the catholic church he also said this woman would be cruel in heart now we know with the election as it goes as far as we know um with kamala harris and joel biden we know that uh november 11th praise god when the war was stopped by the four angels of revelation seven standing at the four corners of the earth it was holding back the destruction holding back things until deceiving angel could come from the east to seal the 144 000 jews and before the ceiling angel reached them he has to reach the gentiles to close off the gentiles dispensations so your ceiling is guaranteed the cap coming to you is guaranteed praise the lord amen it's very interesting that uh this calling madame harris or vice president-elect has broken the ceiling for women in high office being the first one so the congdon the destruction is on a decree of destruction it's interesting what she said her mother told her her mother told her she said that she will be the first in many things but don't be the last and she yourself said i may be the first woman to be in this position but i am not going to be the last so that is very interesting you know when god promised this deliverer to come in genesis it took three stages actually higa sarah and then mary and then the christ so we are seeing the beginning of a new season a new time breaking upon us isn't that right now 1914 the world went to war they have never been on peace since constantly swinging this is the prophet swinging they are doing the very same thing yet and what was they doing holding he said oh god have mercy hole holding that great thing that i saw in the vision the whole thing becomes the destruction holding the atomic holding the wars that they don't destroy themselves until the thing come to destroy it until israel returns back and gets itself together and then the message will go to israel and she'll be sealed with the seal of the holy ghost which is what are we talking about for the uh what do you call it the long pentecostal feast oh hallelujah the long time of pentecost oh glory to god that covers seven churches oh glory to god do you believe that hallelujah and then the messiah will go to israel and she'll be sealed with the seed of the holy ghost see after the gentiles is called out the people for his namesake will be called out which in this age right here their call and israel receives a three-year and six-month message hallelujah all right so let's go tonight praise god he said now we come here this morning to gather hopes new hopes of what we are here for and what is the purpose and i think this is a wonderful time to think on the hopes that god has given us now we want to draw this first into our mind that there is not one thing that can destroy us until the purpose of he who created us has been fulfilled so you'd rather be worried and fearful and destruction and no no no no you're the capital you have to study the purpose that you are here for remember the jewel there is no we are made for purpose this church was built here for a purpose this foundation was not dug and the cornerstone laid and the blocks laid in the building and the roof on the interior was not put yet just to be seen it could be done it was put here by a purpose your home that you live in is not just accidentally put there and somebody just wasting some time your home was made for a purpose to serve a purpose you didn't drive here tonight with your automobile that automobile not made to see if it could be made the materials was not wasted by man it was put you for a purpose to serve a purpose the clothing you wear was not just to see somebody could fashion something it was our purpose the food you eat was not grown on earth just to see it grow it was made to silver purpose and god did not have to make just a tree just to be a tree he made a tree for a purpose and god did not make you and i just to see if he could do it he made us for a purpose therefore there is a purpose of us all being here you are not here just to be another human being you are here because god made you for some purpose you are not here just to eat food that god growed you are not here just to live in a house that man made or to wear the clothing that someone fashioned you are here for a specific purpose and no matter how little you are or how big you are how important you are how unimportant you are you are here to serve that purpose oh glory to god just as my fingers here for purpose the nail on my fingers for our purpose my eye every part of our bodies is a silver purpose it was not put here just to see it could be look what it put here but it was put here to service purpose it was god's divine plan to do so and if we are here put on god's purpose there is nothing can destroy us until god's purpose be fulfilled nothing can harm us until that purpose that god has put us here for has been made manifest no matter how much trouble we have how much heartaches and sorrows we go through all these things have a reason and there's a reason for it we'll give the lord some praises oh glory to god your life is no mistake your life is no accident your life is for our purpose oh god the hell you have been through is for our purpose the disappointments the heartaches the sorrows it's for our purpose but we know in romans 8 28 that all things will work together for good to them that love god to them what he called according to his purpose in the time of solomon he said they floated the cedars far from chopper hall them and the ox cat they cut all these stones around the world and when they come together it was such perfect missionary in 40 years building of the temple there wasn't a buzz of a saw of a song of a hammer every stone went one was cut this way one was cut that way one was cut back this way but every one of them went together no man could come and cut the bride oh and say i had to look like this one i have to preach like this one i have to teach like this one i have to follow this one that's nonsense when god will cut him he do the cutting and then he going to arrange and fit the stones together or give the lord some praises isn't that right that's to build the temple of god so watch every stone when one was cut this way that way they started laying the thing putting the building up and getting along fine and they found a funny looking stone and they didn't want that thing they said that that don't belong here they kicked it out show it in a weed pile come to find out they built on and on and on i come to find out the very stone they had rejected was the chief cornerstone and jesus said so and today the methodists the baptists the lutherans the pentecostal everywhere wrong if you want to watch our friends the real cornerstone you are rejecting it and the cornerstone in the building of this spiritual house is the holy spirit you're afraid of it you're afraid of fanaticism i know we have a lot of scarecrows and mockery why if there wasn't that it wouldn't be the real one but there's a genuine article of the holy spirit in baptism we'll give the lord some praises tonight and that's the way it's going to be in the coming of the lord jesus pure heart pure in heart shall see god and the reason we builders are not getting anywhere the same way they did back here the chief cornerstone was rejected and that's the matter today with the methodist and the baptist and the pentecostal all the chief cornerstone which is jesus christ is rejected we have all our theology and things we speak of this what our church believes what our watchers don't believe we teach it in pump it in everything like that but the baptism of the holy ghost and the power of god to let freedom in amongst the people is rejected i want to read that part again he said what we we we could teach our teletheology what our church don't believe what what we believe we teach it pump it in everything like that but the baptism of the holy ghost and the power of god to let the freedom in among the people you know why the ministers don't want the spirit because it takes power from them that is why they don't want the spirit because when the spirit comes they lose power because the spirit does take over they can't do their own thing and play politics behind the pulpit and preach this and slam this one and blast just wanna do this and do this because they're doing it that's not the spirit doing it hallelujah peter told that ana zafara you didn't lie to me you liked the holy ghost wasn't peter doing something and trying something he was the spirit was there the fire was there the power is there oh glory to god hallelujah so this is what it does but the baptism of the holy ghost and the power of god to let what freedom in amongst the people so what the ministers do to bind the people to themselves by fear oh glory to god that's the binding power that is you know yeah the preacher with the power the power of fear not the power of the holy ghost the power of fear so the people are born but a jubilee time coming for all who want to go free in the jubilee oh glory to god so watch and that's the very cornerstone that build the church that will go home to meet jesus the cornerstone was kicked out in a bunch of ways they built their church they built their church come to find out the place where they left undone the cornerstone fit right into it and today where all the power signs and wonders is being left undone you find out the holy ghost fits right in there for he is the one who brings the power of god into the church who is the one he is the one that's why a minister can bring a revival it takes the holy ghost to bring a revival oh glory to god the stone that has been rejected as the chief cornerstone you builders of these denominations remember that the rejected stone is the chief cornerstone and brother say he is here tonight he's so wonderful and glorious i know that he is present i wish you could feel like i do i may look silly but you may think that i don't know where i am but i do it's the spirit of the living god i just can't preach no more there's something to joy because of glory just set on me i never had it to happen like that there is something i know there is coming a time and he's in the spirit now so but i'm riding the anointing he's oh god i can't preach no more oh god the joy bell is ringing he said i see it in the near future oh glory to god so he's breaking into vision now the spirit of the living god fallen fresh on his church there's going to be something take place i hear a song of the mulberry rushes something just spoke to my heart and said fearnet preacher there will be one these days there will be one of these days they will believe it may take persecutions and things to drive us together but god will drive his church together just as certain as i am standing in this pulpit on the one that is christ and christ will be the head no denomination will be the head christ will be the head of every believer okay the lord i shout not no pastor this and bishop this and message pope that away with them number six christ will be the head of every believer and every believer can say amen oh glory to god hallelujah oh glory to god when the prophet rocket in the spirit soul he said i feel it i see it i know something in the future a fresh holy spirit a fresh anointing gonna come upon the church it will take persecution but as sure as i'm standing here the church will be driven together and we are going to be one one lord one faith one baptism another ephesians or give the lord some praises tonight oh my hallelujah i'm enjoying away tonight he said no notice a new heart a new spirit then i'll put my spirit within you i know you will keep all my statutes and my judgments when that mainspring begins to take when the stone that's rejected oh here we go here we go when the love of god is brought back amongst the people of god oh glory my god i could run i could run right now on that one when the what not legalism not the law we are there for years when the love of god is brought back amongst the people of god then you're going to see the church of the of god all fellowshipping with one another without any friction at all i i hear yesterday without any friction at all oh god should i already never feel it well it shall be prophesized shall fail tongues shall cease oh god charity buried all things believe in all things open all things enjoyed all things oh glory to god you mean that love gonna come back that's right he said one day we'll be standing talking and love will enter into the building and all the evil will be taken out there'll be such a great unity oh god the sick will be healed without hands being laid on them oh give the lord a shout tonight my lord you mean that comment that has to come not this foolishness we have now all glory to god man they laboring laboring carrying on and carrying on and they're looking they're not looking for that stone oh glory to god the stone is missing oh hallelujah hallelujah but the stone the bill is refused oh man that stone is coming it's a rejected stone oh glory to god not irregular stone you know it's a rejected stone oh my hallelujah you remember when the servants of the bible say the lord delay is coming that's why they can fight one that was the revolution that they have but the true church all over the world has shipped down to a place that there's come a ministry among it just exactly like the ministry of jesus christ see this is what is coming along too the true church has to have this ministry in it smith now watch what they got here what they got what they got they got their thing in condition now what's the next thing the rejected stone of the pyramid cut out of the mountain without hands god centered do you see the rejected one the rejected stone is the head of this is the head is the capstone and the very one that they rejected through the gentle age is christ and christ was not cut and put there as a vicar or son of god or some great dignitary in the church he is the holy spirit and the cap of the pyramid will be christ coming do you see it so on top of brotherly kindness is what holy spirit and then afterwards is christ's corporal body they kept coming but the holy spirit is christ coming to you to see the pyramid of your life yeah he is this is him to be daniel christ is that stone he wasn't born of man he was born of god he's coming for a church that has been reborn again by the spirit of god because the strength of that headstone runs through the church like a magnet and was shaping up all these things and all these scrap playing there and they you talk about the place where and they swept out and a big stone come and picked it up and all that big magnet stone that pick up all of it because it was magnificent more than a company some place where they have all this crap metal and the big magnet come and pick up all the metals and so on like that he said because it was magnetized and we have got to be magnetized to that headstone not magnetized to the pasta not magnetized pancakes to the preacher magnetized the headstone which is the holy spirit which is christ hallelujah so to watch the headstone is the holy spirit and every one of us that got the magnetism of the holy spirit when the stone that daniel saw caught the hands of man strikes the image the church would fleet it back into glory she'd be taken up the rapture of the saints so how could somebody go with all the magnetism of the holy ghost the head high with knowledge and mysteries and revelation and information and whatnot and they do have the magnetism of the holy ghost oh my lovely culture you have to have the evidence of that let me say it again not just claiming that you know you have to have the evidence of that you know peter didn't just claim it you know he said silvan go i don't have but i have something and what i have i can give and he release it and the man walked and that shook up whole the testimony of a resurrected christ in their midst was bringing people to the lord and we have very read five thousand came to serve the lord this chief priest and the pharisees that were forming the council to bring press upon them not because they have a book and they're talking about jesus but because the man walked and the miracle could not be denied oh give the lord a shout no pressure coming because we have books and tapes no pressure coming because we're teaching this and teaching have endless teachings all over the world the press will come when christ the rejected stone is being made manifest he said this is the stone that was set at north at you builders this is the stone that the billy refused he is quoting praise god psalms 1 18 the stone that the bill reveals has become the head stone of the corner they knew those guys was ignorant and alone but the spirit would bring back king to their memory he will lead them to all truths and guide them they were ignorant learned but the spirit knows the word and the words that's coming up oh glory to god so we're in the homeland the jews are in the homeland we're at the end of the age ready for the rapture the rapture comes the church goes up we are caught up to meet him in the air oh praise the lord and the stone was cut out of the mountains ready to come at any time when it comes what does it do it does away with the gentile age so the coming of the stone comes off this entire dispensation and debt mourning my morning with terrorism just to hear the report because god will do his mysterious work oh glory to god a special work a work among the bride of jesus christ they're gonna rock them and gonna shake them no wonder why the prophet said i'm only building you're coming i have a short quick message not gonna shake the whole nation oh glory to god that message on its way it will be a message of dynamics and mechanics oh give the lord some praises tonight when that stone come what does it do it does away with the gentile age it's all over and god completely quits dealing with them let him that filthy be filthy still let him that holy behold he's still what does he do he takes his church the holy ghost filled nutmeg is filled not tape filled not mystery filled holy ghost fill oh glory to god give the lord a shout he takes his church who is the church holy ghost phil not your father is a pastor your father is the elder your father is a deacon he takes the church the holy ghost filled not getting church long time he takes the church the holy ghost filled go give the lord some praises tonight i'm still reading what's the filthy that's the sleeping version on them that comes up in judgment over there oh hold it hold it you mean the foolish virgin is filthy yes he said he's that that does he filthy oh hallelujah we'll get out and so on like that i'll skip that now if you have been in egypt you will know the great pyramid in egypt you all speak about so much he said now watch uh the stones were put up there together the cap there would have to have a perfect stone or he said they'd have a symbol of prophecy then they had someone rejected just like the chief cornerstone the bible was rejected now we're getting closer and closer and the spirit of god here we go has come from justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost that church will have to be so close and the spirit of god so perfect working in that church wow when the headstone comes it will cap together and the resurrection will come and away will go to church now you say that's just here say but i'm trying to show you a point that the church has to come to a place to have the spirit of christ in it the spirit of christ operating in our bodies just like it operated in the body of our lord i'm not hearing you tonight oh give the lord a shout or you on the internet yet give the lord a shout this is this is target tonight we are missing tonight at all this is dead on target oh this is not nice you know no no no no no no no no i'm trying to show you a point that the church has got to come to a place to have the spirit of christ in other words after they add up all these songs after he had mysteries and revelations and inspiration it's equal sign you have to be the spirit of christ operate the total you dance here your dad your flip here i call that verbal gymnastics you flip it here you flip it here you twist it here you stretch it over three hours here you still have more to say here at the end of it it has to equal the spirit of christ operating in the church the spirit of operating our bodies just like that's the operating word no no claim christ openly understands you're talking 50 years gone he's still opening leave it open all that opening understanding opening your mind opening you're the word all that opening is on top purpose just like we read everything is our purpose that understanding is to know wide in the upper room because if they don't understand by revelation why afterwards some people led they'll leave their problem until they won't get coke and get drink and they go missing their pentecost and when somebody breathe and move everybody follow them too like peter we go fishing i go fishing all them go following peter too so the word doing that for them they can't move they nail in the upper room this they're stuck there they have to carry until they don't even know when he's coming they don't know when the revival will break him it could break tonight you just have to wait until we don't know we've been walking into something supernatural tonight that will change the course of any everything oh glory to god you don't know oh hallelujah they have to wait until because he told them tarry and the jerusalem until no glory there god will nobody talk you out there until you want it now you want it now you gotta wait until because the vision is always for an appointed time we'll give the lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah i think i want to read this thing again this thing was so sweet tonight i'm trying to show you a point that the church has got to come to a place to have the spirit of christ in it the spirit of christ operating in our bodies so he's not talking about the anointing or church operating in our bodies in other words the word made flesh the invisible become invisible it's operated in you you know you are powerhouse you know you're anointed you know you are charged you know you are monetized because the spirit is operating in you oh glory to god let's go the tree is perfection the ministry comes to its of perfection when it reproduce christ again in natural among human beings that's how you know the ministry come to perfection any mind exhausting and you're trying that thing and manipulating and sharing any word no no the ministry maturity maturity of the ministry is reproduction of the original grain christ reproduce here's why that is guaranteed it's like a sign of this is guarantee because the wave sheath which is malachi 4 is the first one that comes to maturity that's the first one that god accept as a sign of the rest that will come so god took william branham and harvest him in front of us with all these signs all the wonders all the miracles all the turtle manifestation and that is something to god i think the son of man was waved prophesied let others go in and come we coming oh glory to god all that's going to come it's a sign it's an anchor it's assurance it's a surety that order is going to come because one has been clipped oh glory to god do you get it now you can't clip a corn and the whole field is gone and when again you're getting rice or you can send some kind of plum or apple something like that the reason you cut the corn is because this is the first corn that come to maturity you're cutting from the corn field you cut it to say you know what the rest coming they might be small and growing in power and stature because remember when when when when ramsay's going in power who is it going in power too you know when ramsay's getting in position hallelujah moses are getting position you know oh glory to god and the world comes to churches can be ahead of us you know come on now come on now they can't be ahead of us i'm not scripted for that and have no scripture for that we have to be ahead of them god always ahead of them god was the head of goliath because david went through being lying look at the lord i shall go like i didn't know what hit him glory to god goliath didn't even know what hit him but david wasn't in the fightful the army fall he wasn't qualified inside there hallelujah actually trying to ridicule and embarrass him because he's not in the in the in directing but he saw sword in the armor and what not dvd you know i mean it being lying yes i deal with them the god that delivered me from the being i'll take all god oh hallelujah oh my i love it i love it i love it i'm enjoying it god wait for satan's eden to unveil this bride there's going to be unveiling of the bride of jesus christ oh he will take the veil off of that bride nobody knew the writer is oh people claiming and making all kind of claims and so on but god going to do his mysterious work hallelujah okay now watch so this so then he said you know um no that was the cornerstone not what it was rejected and the cornerstone of hell the building is the keystone now you know what the keystone is right that you want that like this and an arch the one that locks it that's the keystone how many knows what a keystone is when the arch is built then the keys don't hold it together the cornerstone is what holds up the building is that right and the cornerstone in the pyramid was a capstone was a keystone held the rest of it together now the keystone was rejected so the keystone is the same as the cornerstone the same as the capstone hallelujah rejected isn't that right now what did that represent when enoch built it here it was taking place it was like a gospel church now it was way down white like the pyramid i'll skip down a little bit john wesley priest sanification the church become a minority and then the pentecostal restoration of the gifts what is it way down in here way down from the looks of the head down there is closer to the head up here is a little closer and that's got to be absolutely to fit with the rest it's got to be honed so you see on the bottom is wide as you go nearer nearer as you go higher you're going to the head right he said to fit it has got to be honed so you bring in a different terminology to show you this thing going deeper it's going further it going sharper hallelujah in order to fit is not church member business as in the bible that's nice that nobody's simple the simple they're foolish as foolish and they're not going into the wisdom they're in the middle in a way they're kind of foolish just want to say simple this is the word called honed and horn is what you do with metallurgy metallic is it's fine uh to find measurement honed measurement so listen what he said you know so watch so then now it's got to be honed so then you say in that pyramid you can take a razor blade and you can't run it between them rocks where the water was it fits so together god prophecy is taking the elect out to the pentecostal church that hybrid pulling it out and finish up the word and it's got to be so close until the word itself will blend with this word he use another word now he gone from horned to blend oh hallelujah i love it i love it this is not skim milk he takes honed and then come aboard blend blend with the wood here come the headstone crying grace grace the headstone there you are you see it's way wide down here that's the button pyramid and they're getting closer closer closer and looter justification and he comes with his identification here comes the pentecostal gifts but god is taken from deer and holding out a bunch holding out a bunch to make our ministry just exactly like that were there because it's got to fit with the word and there the right is taken up so you have to get a bond somewhere oh hallelujah praise god hallelujah a bunch isn't that right are we finding out that the message of life is the thought the fourth message brought back life so it's kankarwarm lucas palmer woman caterpillar and we know four messengers of debt and four messages of life he said justification he brought back the pulp some vacation brought back the back doctrine of holiness what brought back the leaf and the crystals what is many cultures clap their hands rejoicing and pentecostal so we have to have all we can't say that justification we can be justified like luther is no we need just vision plus you have to live a holy life with our whole life and sacrifice you're not accepted so the same addiction is also the pentecostal baptism that is also plus the word okay so what was the thought the thought was the word itself the word made flesh fruits of the proof of the resurrection sign that christ has finally after justification being planted sanification being planted baptism of the holy ghost organization died of christ has again centered himself like the cap of the pyramid first line justification sanctification personally goes then comes the cap what is it he's explaining all of that right here that holy ghost bunch being honed out outside of a holy ghost bunch what god wrapped her in you have to be part of the holy ghost bunch in order to be honed god can't hold a non-holy ghost bunch let me say that again god and cutting or honing a non-holy ghost bunch you have to become part of that holy ghost bunch in order to be honed and the horning is to fit you to take it to rapture oh glory to god this is sweet tonight i know about you but this is food for my soul tonight hallelujah watch watch that holy ghost bunch being honed so that he can fit with the same kind of a ministry he had when he went away when he comes back it will catch the whole thing in the rapture where the justified sanctified the background only goes that pyramid will live again the house of god will live again oh give the lord a shout i will restore saith the lord hallelujah all glory on christ was manifested to destroy the work of the devil isn't that right hallelujah he was born to be that to destroy the works of the devil his body is to do the same because the body and head is together oh glory to god you see what we coming for to destroy the works of the devil it had no devil castle in the old testament no scripture the closer it was david playing the harp and the spirit leaving soul temporarily but devils had to cast out when they come to the new testament and when jesus said he said my name the first thing jesus said you've got castle devils you're gonna let them devils know what kingdom you are from oh glory to god let them know what power source is behind you oh glory to god because lucifer was kicked on the earth and the first authority and power god gave his disciples was over devils oh glory to god and there's an invasion of devils or in the churches and homes and family lives we've got to back them up and we will back them up oh give the lord a shout because jesus raised up to destroy the work of the devil and his wife will do the same also oh give the lord a shout amen hallelujah but abandon we try to build it up on education we try and sponge scholarship upon the nomination and everybody want them to follow them follow them like give this one right this one it's messiahs this one is a mini on a man this one is major prophet minor prophet this one claiming all kind of thing messenger half messenger quarter messenger oh i'm looking for some kind of attention followers but we try education denomination all these things will not work as long as we have not accepted this odd stone this peculiar stone but as the building begin to materialize they realize that the hole that was left the odd stone fitted to the dot that is where the spiritual bill is today and that is why the bride building of christ is not ready for the bridegroom it's because that the builders have rejected the chief cornerstone that was laid on the day of pentecost which is the baptism of the holy ghost i know my words the rejected builders reject that what did god say i lay in zion for a foundational stone i tried to a special precious cornerstone a short foundation he that believes on me shall not be ashamed shall i make his oh glory to god is not right who am i he said it's been odd people act funny they don't want they don't come into the order of our psychology or educational or learning or creeds they don't fit in there and they kicked it out because it was too or too peculiar to disagree with them the plans as we as men had ideas of what the church ought to be that's the way god has brought his church from justification signification baptism of the holy spirit and now the ministry of the spirit which is what quickens the word oh hallelujah your being is a progression yes because it's not pentecost 1906 pentecost so you say justification sun vacation but holy ghost and now the ministry of the spirit which is what quickens the world so once we step into that ministry you will be quickened by the spirit oh glory to god the word will be quickened to you it will come alive in you that's why brother branham said he could preach till he all is here full of his head until the word is inspired to you you're in the same shape oh hallelujah so the cap never did come because it was a cornerstone it was a headstone in the church it was a cornerstone in the full church it was the headstone it never did come it was rejected and watch and i believe when it's coming that the church will shape into a place from justification so in other words he's not talking about this message thing you have a church and you're chasing granny i have a church here in a tabernacle here he's not talking about that they choose buildings and stuff he's talking he's talking about the shaping now he's talking about getting down to the condition the church had to be in are you with me he said watch and it's coming what the church is such a minority and a ministry will be among those people until it'll be exactly the same ministry that jesus did that will bring jesus and catch the whole thing away and all those honest true looters presbyterian baptist methodist that's born of the spirit of god will be caught away with jesus when he comes i believe that hallelujah question was the pentecost situation noisy church back at the beginning when the holy ghost fulfilled was the pentecostal church a noisy church back at the beginning when the holy ghost first fell the virgin mary like she was drunk staggering on the power of god and all of them like that and the people they say they're full of new wine that's the way the church was ordained and that's the way every church is ordained every time god has a church it will be the same kind of church shout out same kind same kind i don't care what the bishops say what the word said that i know uncertain song listen to this there is no place in the bible where they ever received the holy ghost without having emotions speaking with tongues and shoutings and praises of god and prophecies and manifestation they never did just wake walk up shake hand with the preacher and walk away let me read it again because the message world yeah there is no place in the bible no place give me bible there's no place to be back where they ever received the holy ghost without having emotions speaking with tongues and shoutings and praises of god and prophecies and manifestation they never did just walk up shake hands with the preacher and walk away hallelujah praise god so it's to bring him back exactly like he was at the beginning his same ministry the same jesus the same power the same holy ghost the same one that come under pentecost is the same holy ghost that is manifested today from glory unto glory to glory and is back to its original seed with the baptism of the holy ghost with the same signs of same wonders same baptism same kind of people acting the same way with the same power and the same sensation it's some glory to glory oh maya next change from glory into the body of his own glorious body where we will see him like it is we are invited to share his glory now we are baptized into his body by one spirit oh my i went that same spirit that was on jesus comes into his church to manifest the written word for today it will be a super sign oh that's a prophecy right now that's a prophecy right now when the same spirit that was on jesus comes into his church to do what to manifest the written word for today it will be super saiyan it will be god in man manifesting his written word oh praise the name of the lord thank you lord jesus my god hallelujah the church of that day they found fault with the man who was the word is that right they found fault with the man who was the word no defined fault with the word working through the man oh glory to god so before the consequent tighten up before i have a press the brine ah will be rejected by the church remember this the romans didn't come and take up jesus lock him up i want to think about that now jesus our lord the cap the messiah he came to his own his church were rejected yeah the church world brought him and said this man blaspheme the church will sell them out they brought him to the council because they couldn't handle him displaying god they couldn't handle the manifestation nothing so much he teaching you know he was teaching something otherwise teaching plus manifestation like trouble she's done was blasting them busting them and they were still shook up at john they say are you the one or should we look for another job just to me i ain't nobody know i'm not even worried to open on losing man's shoes you won't coming after me forget it i baptized it in water but he baptized with fire john was rocking jerusalem because they knew his preaching was different his anointing was different they couldn't understand how he could be so fearless preaching that unadulterated word be paid the way of the lord make whisper street no signs no wonders and johnny rocking the place and shaken up so much that some of them come and get baptized and as they get back they say don't you be better and you act as laid to the root john wasn't easy you know they're getting baptized and hitting them hard he said better bring forth fruit me to repentance don't just come with your long hair hallelujah pray is gonna look to get a bishop on my side here i don't have that bring forth fruit meat to repentance john busted him left and right coming he said he won't come after me there's fire there's fire he's fire i reunited water you know he said about this fire fire fire what must i prophesy what must i say if i went in israel and take the book what must i prophesy i say fire fire fire power hallelujah oh glory of dynamics what must i prophesy more water water is worth you know oh let's continue fire is spirit you know what must i profit i water oh glory to god water is seven seals you know oh glory god but there are seven thunders what we see should make a church that will make a revival that we will find from everywhere and say the seven thunders that not even written is being manifested oh fire fire fire give the lord a shout not talked not spoken manifested oh my hallelujah praise god hallelujah he was the living word of god because he was expressing god through himself aha not talking word living word why because you were expressing god to himself he was so completely surrendered to god the word till he and the word was the same and that's exactly what the church ought to be today what that the word of god is the same he said just as jesus was the church supposed to be god's want to work god hates a powerless religion it's got to be power certainly it's power to save a man from sin it is power that can do signs and wonders and miracles that jesus promised you know his power to take you out of the world you couldn't just walk all the way so you see no big light and glory and rainbow but there's a power snatch it's a pull oh glory the god of power pull you in no man can come except my father draw him it's a joy in power he was in your baptist church a methodist church but a power hit you without more than that it's a more where that come from oh give the lord i showed that power it had more where that come from that power doesn't make you do signs on one of the miracles too hallelujah see god wants to work in this church god wants to work in this church so god's strategy is to take empty vessels and shape the world with them oh give the lord a shout that's his gods i'm still reading these are my torsos god's strategy is to take empty human vessels and shake the world with them but they was all standing there with their vessels turned up and god took himself and filled them up and they shook the world he poured himself into them and that's the need of today that's what we need today's empty vessels so god can fill them up god has to get empty vessels we can fill them up elijah didn't say get some vessels and borrow a lot of oil or we receive we get a good sale price in it you just say get empty vessels that's all you need and that's what it was on pentecost they had empty vessels so god could fill them up on god and brother this day demands that this day you have got to have that we have that or perish i'm going to close now we've got to have that will perish you shall become a please tonight i'm going to close too but abram he said brother the lives come off a hell that sight streams of demon power is pouring from everywhere it conquered the nations it conquered politics still is so rotten to the core it conquered churches until they know nothing but denomination are you a christian i'm a messianist are you a christian i'm a pentecostal that don't mean no more i said the other day than being a pig or a hug or a horse that has nothing to do with it you are christian when you are born again and filled with the holy ghost not until that and he didn't stop there he had the next qualification saturday and you are yielded completely to the spirit if you are not yielded to the spirit then you are not born again you don't have the holy ghost so he he's saying not only must you have the holy ghost the holy ghost must have you when you could yield to the spirit isn't that right you see you might speak in tongue shiver jump up and down paul said i can move mountains with fate i can heal the sick i cannot have knowledge of the bible i can go to seminary and learn all this stuff and everything else i'm nothing yet but maya talk about laid off a kettle demons going around powers of devil under the name of christianity teaching for doctrines the commandments of men geological seminary doctrines leaving the bible alone to say the days of mercury is past we don't need the holy ghost they say that now you know not in so many words any message having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof like we don't suppose our power we're not supposed to actual power we're supposed to stay there and preach mysteries and preach long services the longer the better the longer the service is more spiritual it appears to be the days of america has passed we don't need the holy ghost who can tame that devil god we can't do it by denomination we can't do it by eclasical forces but there was a voice one time that did it he said you will do it when you empty up and become weak pulled of yourself and let the holy ghost come in and flutter every part of you and saturate every litter of your body that's the only way to do it we don't need an organization empty vessels is what he needs that's right a call out church a little minority that will receive god's power and blessing and his message he said get empty friends get weak deny your own ability and you out in radio that will hear these tapes whenever they come empty yourselves out pour yourselves out upon god's altar as a sacrifice let the angel come with a call of fire and fill that vessel with the power of almighty god lord just as an example of many others i pray that your blessings rest upon the ordinance there's one thing left father i can see you rise up somewhere with some empty vessels and make this world a shame of itself or send jesus right quick that the end is here lord there's only two things left to be done and we must eat right away for we know it at the end either we will see something rise up right away or we'll see the coming of the lord all prophecy is fulfilled the last thing before the church was resurrected and then he closed with this prayer he said come lord jesus catch away your church and if it be your will lord just before the church is raptured may there rise power oh god fill these vessels raise them up lord shake this world once more we know it will be past time there will be no repentance then it'll be too far for them then but show your power lord fill those vessels and shake this world like it never been shook before oh my first peter 2 3 10 says if so be of taste of the lord is gracious to whom commanders unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen god and precious he also has lively stones that built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ wherefore also is contained in the scripture behold eileen zion achieved cornerstone elect precious he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them we should be disobedient the stone will should be the builders disallowed the same is made ahead of the corner a stone of stumbling a rock of
