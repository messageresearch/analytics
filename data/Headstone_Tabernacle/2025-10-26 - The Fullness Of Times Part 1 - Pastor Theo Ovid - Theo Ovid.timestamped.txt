[48:24] [music]
[48:25] &gt;&gt; to our fathers who were true
[48:28] &gt;&gt; and it's promised to you the believers
[48:31] &gt;&gt; and you can have it too.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Let us bow our heads for a word of
[48:36] prayer.
[48:38] Father, we thank you for your presence.
[48:40] We thank you for your word. We thank you
[48:43] for [music] this season and time that
[48:45] you'll bring us into this holy time of
[48:47] God. Father, we pray that you would
[48:48] visit the people this morning. Speak to
[48:51] their hearts, transform [music]
[48:53] their minds and their lives. Father, we
[48:56] know the lid of hell has been uncovered
[48:58] and [music] streams of demon powers
[49:01] loosed upon the earth. And people walk
[49:05] light and carefree without thinking of
[49:09] the heavy demonic activity loosed
[49:12] against their lives, their homes, their
[49:16] families.
[49:17] Lord, we're not living in normal times.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music]
[49:20] &gt;&gt; We're living in challenging and
[49:22] difficult times. And as hell have
[49:25] enlarged its mouth and streams of demon
[49:28] powers have been loosed on the earth.
[49:31] You send seven angels from eternity and
[49:34] loose heaven, father in the form of a
[49:37] word message that receive in our hearts.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; And now we have angelic beings moving
[49:44] among us.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Now we have the angel of the Lord fixing
[49:48] things around
[49:50] &gt;&gt; for the coming of the Lord. We are
[49:52] enlightened, Lord, and we're delighted
[49:55] to know that you have kept your promise
[49:58] &gt;&gt; and you would keep your promise
[50:00] &gt;&gt; and you would never fail the royal seeds
[50:02] of Abraham
[50:04] &gt;&gt; because you told your servant Abraham
[50:06] that thy seed shall possess the gates of
[50:09] the enemy. And father, the gates of
[50:12] sickness, the gates of disease, the
[50:14] gates of of struggles and and prison and
[50:17] whatever it is, we have a promise in
[50:20] that word to possess the gates of the
[50:22] enemy. Father, you even promise in your
[50:25] word to raise a standard against the
[50:27] enemy.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; You can't back down from that. Not when
[50:30] the floods is all around us, Lord.
[50:32] You've got to raise a standard according
[50:34] to your promised word. You even said
[50:36] your word can't return void. And you
[50:38] send your prophet to speak spoken word
[50:41] to circle the whole earth to be
[50:43] activated in a season and time. And we
[50:46] feel that you're about to activate that
[50:48] word that produces the manifestation of
[50:51] the sons of God. We feel that you're
[50:53] here to activate the word that Jesus is
[50:56] among us to confirm with signs and
[50:58] wonders and miracles. Come among us,
[51:00] Lord. Set every captive free. Restore
[51:03] the backsliding heart. heal the sick in
[51:05] our midst and break a revival fire among
[51:08] your people. Father, be glorified in our
[51:10] midst in Jesus name we ask it. Amen and
[51:13] amen. Before you have your seats, just
[51:15] turn around and greet somebody in Jesus
[51:17] name. Praise God. And tell them welcome.
[51:20] Tell them it's good to be here. Oh,
[51:22] praise the name of the Lord. [music]
[51:25] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[54:45] your Bibles, I like you to turn to
[54:47] Daniel chapter 12. Want to read 1:4.
[54:51] Want to look at 1 Corinthians chapter
[54:52] 10. Want to read 1-1. Ephesians chapter
[54:56] 1. I want to word read from verse 3 to
[54:59] 10.
[55:01] Thank you musicians.
[55:04] Greetings in Jesus name to you all.
[55:06] Welcome. Greeting to all those connected
[55:09] to us on the internet. Welcome you to
[55:11] our Sunday morning worship fellowship
[55:16] unto God.
[55:21] Daniel chapter 12
[55:23] reading verse 1 to4
[55:27] and at that time shall Michael stand up
[55:30] the great prince which standeth for the
[55:33] children of thy people and that there
[55:36] shall be a time of trouble such as never
[55:39] was since there was a nation even to
[55:41] that same time and at that time thy
[55:46] people shall be delivered everyone one
[55:49] that shall be found written in the book.
[55:52] Many of them that sleep in the dust of
[55:54] the earth shall awake, some to
[55:57] everlasting life, and some to shame and
[56:02] everlasting contempt. But they that be
[56:05] wise shall shine as the brightness of
[56:08] the firmament, and they that turn many
[56:10] to righteousness as the stars forever
[56:13] and ever. But thou, oh Daniel, shut up
[56:16] the words and seal the book, even to the
[56:20] time of the end. Many shall run to and
[56:23] fro. Knowledge shall be increased.
[56:26] Reading from 1 Corinthians chapter 10,
[56:29] want to read from verse one.
[56:33] Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye
[56:35] should be ignorant.
[56:37] How that all our fathers were under the
[56:40] cloud and all passed through the sea.
[56:44] Were all baptized unto Moses in the
[56:46] cloud and in the sea. Did all eat the
[56:48] same spiritual meat. Did they all drink
[56:50] the same spiritual drink? For they drank
[56:52] of that spiritual rock that follow them.
[56:55] That rock was Christ. But with many of
[56:58] them, God was not well pleased. For they
[57:03] were overthrown in the wilderness.
[57:06] Now these things were our examples
[57:11] to the intent
[57:13] we should not lust after evil things as
[57:17] they also lusted. Neither be idolattors
[57:21] as were some of them. As it is written,
[57:24] the people sat down to eat and drink and
[57:28] rose up to play. Neither let us commit
[57:31] fornication as some of them committed
[57:33] and fell in one day three and 20,000.
[57:37] Neither let us tempt Christ. Some of
[57:39] them also tempted and were destroyed of
[57:42] the serpents. Neither murmur ye as some
[57:45] of them also murmured and were destroyed
[57:47] of the destroyer.
[57:49] Now all these things happen unto them
[57:55] for examples
[57:58] and they are written for our admonition
[58:02] upon whom the ends of the world are
[58:05] come. Final scripture Ephesians chapter
[58:08] 3 1 we want to read from verse three.
[58:14] Blessed be the God and father of our
[58:16] Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us
[58:18] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[58:20] places in Christ according as he hath
[58:23] chosen us in him before the foundation
[58:26] of the world that we should be holy
[58:29] without blame before him in love having
[58:31] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[58:33] children by Jesus Christ himself
[58:36] according to the good pleasure of his
[58:38] will to the praise of the glory of his
[58:40] grace wherein he had made us accepted in
[58:42] the beloved in whom we have redemption
[58:44] through his blood, the forgiveness of
[58:45] sins, according to the riches of his
[58:48] grace, wherein he had abounded towards
[58:49] us in all wisdom and prudence, having
[58:53] made known unto us the mystery of his
[58:55] will, according to his good pleasure,
[58:58] which he had purposed in himself, that
[59:01] in the dispensation of the fullness of
[59:04] times, he might gather together in one
[59:08] all things in Christ, both which are in
[59:12] heaven and which are on earth, earth
[59:14] even in him. May God bless his word. You
[59:17] may be seated.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; You love him this morning.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; It's always good to to come into the
[59:30] house of God. It's always good to come
[59:33] and hear the word of God. Amen.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. So,
[59:37] this is our convention week. There'll be
[59:39] no service on Thursday. Looking forward
[59:41] for a great time beginning Friday 10:00
[59:44] and Friday evening and for the 3 days 10
[59:47] and 4. Looking for a great time in the
[59:50] Lord. A great transformation time.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; We are promised great things and we
[59:54] ought to be under great expectation.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Must be under great expectation.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; We have a title this morning. The title
[1:00:02] is the fullness of times.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; That's the title. The fullness of times.
[1:00:06] I have an inspiration waiting for the
[1:00:10] manifestation
[1:00:12] of the sons of God.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; That's the inspiration. Waiting for the
[1:00:15] manifestation of the sons of God. And
[1:00:17] this scripture, this inspiration is from
[1:00:20] Romans 8:19. It says, "For the earnest
[1:00:23] expectation of the creature waited for
[1:00:26] the manifestation of the man of the sons
[1:00:28] of God."
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And in the amplified it says for
[1:00:31] the even the whole creation all nature
[1:00:34] waits expectantly and longs earnestly
[1:00:38] for God's sons to be made known.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; It's waiting for the revealing or the
[1:00:45] disclosing of their sunship.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; That's not talkship.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; That is sunship.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; So the creation itself is waiting for
[1:00:53] the revealing or the unfolding of their
[1:00:57] sunship.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, this is tremendous.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Just imagine the whole creation is
[1:01:01] groaning for the manifestation of the
[1:01:03] sons of God. When God will pull the veil
[1:01:06] off of his sons. Now, these are sons of
[1:01:08] God.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Not humans, not just natural people.
[1:01:12] Sons of God.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; And sons of God express God.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Bible said he came unto his own, his own
[1:01:18] receive him not. But as many as receive
[1:01:21] him, to them he give power to become the
[1:01:25] sons of God. Amen. Not Baptist,
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; not Methodist, not Pentecostal, not
[1:01:30] Jehovah Witness, not Catholic. Power to
[1:01:33] become not a church member.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Power to become
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; the sons of God.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Sons of God talk a certain way. They act
[1:01:41] a certain way. They dress a certain way.
[1:01:43] They live a certain way. Sons of God.
[1:01:45] THEY ARE DIFFERENT.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; THEY ARE SONS OF GOD.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; THEY ARE NOT SONS of men natural. THEY
[1:01:51] ARE SONS OF GOD.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; They have God's gene inside of them.
[1:01:55] THEY HAVE GOD'S GERM INSIDE of them.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They are the sons of God
[1:02:00] that God pick out from the earth.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Right in the face of the
[1:02:04] devil.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; God chose you RIGHT IN SATAN FACE. He
[1:02:07] pick you up right in your condition. He
[1:02:10] chose you BECAUSE WHO HE FOUND YOU. HE
[1:02:12] CALLED WHO HE CALLED SONS OF GOD.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; HE called them for a purpose. He called
[1:02:17] you onto something. HE JUST DOESN'T JUST
[1:02:19] CALL YOU. He call YOU ONTO A PURPOSE.
[1:02:21] DON'T EVER LET THE DEVIL TAKE that out
[1:02:22] of your mind. YOU'RE NOT CALLED TO
[1:02:24] EXIST. YOU'RE NOT CALLED TO BEARING AND
[1:02:26] YOU'RE BEARING AND YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.
[1:02:28] THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE CALLED FOR.
[1:02:29] YOU'RE CALLED FOR A PURPOSE. THAT
[1:02:31] PURPOSE MUST BE ACCOMPLISHED.
[1:02:36] [cheering]
[1:02:37] [applause]
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Your life is no
[1:02:40] mishap.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; YOUR LIFE IS NO MISTAKE. WHAT YOU HAVE
[1:02:46] BEEN THROUGH IS NOT BY CHANCE. BECAUSE
[1:02:48] WE KNOW IF THE DEVIL DON'T KNOW, WE KNOW
[1:02:51] SOMETHING THAT THE DEVIL DON'T KNOW. IF
[1:02:53] THE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW, WE KNOW
[1:02:54] SOMETHING. IF YOUR FAMILY KNOW, WE KNOW
[1:02:56] SOMETHING. WE KNOW ROMANS 8:28 THAT ALL
[1:02:59] THINGS WORK TOGETHER FOR GOOD TO THEM.
[1:03:01] WE KNOW THAT.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; IF NOBODY [screaming] ELSE KNOWS THAT,
[1:03:06] WE KNOW that [cheering]
[1:03:10] this happened, THAT HAPPENED. SO WHAT?
[1:03:12] WHERE'S THE BIG DEAL? WHERE'S THE BIG
[1:03:14] THING? GOD IS IN CHARGE. HE BROUGHT YOU
[1:03:17] ALL THE MARCLLAY. HE SET YOUR FEET ON A
[1:03:20] ROCK TO STAY. HE KEPT YOU ALL THESE
[1:03:22] YEARS. YOU COULD HAVE BEEN DEAD A LONG
[1:03:24] TIME AGO. YOU COULD BE A UP. YOU
[1:03:26] COULD BE BACKSTABBING. YOU COULD BE IN
[1:03:28] HELL A LONG TIME AGO. BUT THE BLOOD OF
[1:03:31] JESUS. But the blood of Jesus this
[1:03:34] morning. [cheering]
[1:03:40] [applause]
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Are you going to love God and go in the
[1:03:52] bar?
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Your love for God will take you higher
[1:03:55] than the bar, higher than the cigarette,
[1:03:57] higher than parties and dance. Higher
[1:03:59] and fat, higher than fooling with women,
[1:04:01] higher than flirting. The love of God
[1:04:03] will take you above all of that is the
[1:04:05] love of God you're talking about. You
[1:04:07] you you can't pay for that.
[1:04:12] [cheering]
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; What you're going to pay for the love of
[1:04:14] God, what you're going to pay for the
[1:04:16] blood of Jesus, God by his grace
[1:04:18] released his son. He came in the
[1:04:20] fullness of time.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; BORN OF A WOMAN, BORN UNDER THE LAW TO
[1:04:24] REDEEM them who WERE UNDER THE LAW. HE
[1:04:26] CAME JUST LIKE YOU TO FEEL FOR YOU TO
[1:04:29] UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH TO

[1:05:43] WE COME FROM THE EIGHTH DAY.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; WE COME FROM ETERNITY. WE COME FROM
[1:05:49] ORIGINAL gene court that was in
[1:05:52] [laughter] THE BACK PART OF GOD'S MIND.
[1:05:54] WHICH DEVIL COULD TAKE THAT OUT? WHICH
[1:05:56] DEVIL COULD ERASE THAT OUT? WHICH JOB?
[1:05:58] WHICH LOSING JOB? LOSING YOUR ROOF,
[1:06:01] LOSING YOUR CAR, WHATEVER. IT DOESN'T
[1:06:03] MATTER. WHAT CAN SEPARATE ME FROM THE
[1:06:06] LOVE OF GOD THAT'S IN CHRIST JESUS?
[1:06:13] [applause]
[1:06:20] One of the songwriter have a song. It
[1:06:22] wasn't easy, but it was worth it.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; And you wasn't easy.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; It wasn't easy for Christ, but it was
[1:06:30] really worth it.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:06:35] Amen.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; For even the whole creation waits
[1:06:38] expectantly and longs earnestly for
[1:06:42] God's sons to be made known.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; God's sons to be made known. The
[1:06:49] creation has grown for that.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; And God's sons couldn't be made known
[1:06:53] until we come down to the fullness of
[1:06:56] time.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's when the time promised
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; for God's sons to be manifested.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; So you have seven church ages. But
[1:07:09] coming down now to the fullness of time,
[1:07:11] God promised to release a message that
[1:07:14] would bring the sons of God into
[1:07:16] position
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; that he could adopt them and place them
[1:07:19] on the earth to give the whole devil one
[1:07:21] last death blow.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Smoke in the devil face before we leave
[1:07:25] here.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Going to lose this battle. You know,
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; this battle already won. Are we going
[1:07:29] through the motion? God is not going to
[1:07:31] lose this battle. You know, it's almost
[1:07:34] 6,000 years he waiting for this
[1:07:35] showdown. It's going to be a showdown. A
[1:07:38] back to Eden showdown. We had one in
[1:07:41] Eden and this is Satan Eden. That was
[1:07:43] God's Eden and man fell in God's Eden
[1:07:45] and God bringing back a bride in Satan's
[1:07:47] Eden. This is the big showdown big time.
[1:07:50] This is the heavyweight championship.
[1:07:53] This is good versus evil. Light versus
[1:07:56] darkness. SONS OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. THE
[1:07:59] BRIDE of Christ versus praise God for
[1:08:01] whatever the devil have to offer. Oh,
[1:08:03] hallelujah. And and and and Daniel said,
[1:08:06] "The people that know their God shall be
[1:08:08] strong."
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; And do great exploit.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; We couldn't know God in all the ages in
[1:08:13] that kind of a way because the mystery
[1:08:15] wasn't fully revealed. He was only
[1:08:17] UNFOLDING PART OF HIMSELF. BUT IN THIS
[1:08:20] LAST DAY, THE FULL THING IS COMING TO
[1:08:22] VIEW.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; THE FULL THING IS UNFOLDED. NOW WE KNOW
[1:08:26] WHO HE IS. NOW WE KNOW HIS NATURE. NOW
[1:08:28] WE KNOW HIS BEING. What he once
[1:08:30] accomplished. Oh, give the Lord praise
[1:08:32] his people.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; You don't NEED SOMEBODY SPOON FEEDING
[1:08:36] YOU ALL ALONG. YOU DON'T NEED THAT.
[1:08:38] PRAISE GOD. YOU GOT TO BE STRONG. THIS
[1:08:41] IS HARVEST TIME. PRAISE GOD. FEAST OF
[1:08:43] TABERNACLES, FEAST OF IN GATHERING. THIS

[1:08:55] HARVEST OF THE SEEDS THAT YOUR SOUL THAT
[1:08:57] YOUR FAMILY WILL BE DELIVERED THAT YOUR
[1:08:59] LOVED ONES GOING TO COME FREE. WELL,

[1:09:03] TO BACK DOWN. THIS IS THE HOUR TO BE
[1:09:05] STRONG.
[1:09:08] THIS IS THE HOUR TO GIVE GOD YOUR
[1:09:10] [screaming] HIGHEST PRAISE. [cheering]
[1:09:15] [applause]
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; This is that hour. This is that hour.
[1:09:19] Give God your highest praise. Especially
[1:09:22] amidst your trying circumstance, you got
[1:09:24] to demonstrate your faith is in him.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; My God. Your Red Sea in front of you,
[1:09:28] but your faith is in him because he's
[1:09:30] able to open up the Red Sea. Mountains
[1:09:32] on both sides, but your faith is in him.
[1:09:34] Don't want to budge and move and release
[1:09:36] the people, but your faith is in him.
[1:09:38] So, you're going to stay there till
[1:09:39] something happened. You will stay there
[1:09:41] until he say call for flies. You're
[1:09:43] going to stay there until he say call
[1:09:44] for frogs. You're going to stay there
[1:09:45] UNTIL HE CALLS FOR EVERYTHING YOU HAD TO
[1:09:47] CALL FOR. UNTIL they break the grips of
[1:09:49] fear. Pharaoh hands off God's people.
[1:09:52] And I'm telling you, I'm going to break
[1:09:53] the break the binding of Satan's hand
[1:09:56] upon your children, upon your loved
[1:09:58] ones, upon your family. That devil had
[1:10:00] to let them go. I don't care how b they
[1:10:02] are this morning. Praise God. They have
[1:10:04] to be loosed.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; So, PRAISE GOD. NOBODY TEARS AND CRYING.
[1:10:09] FORGET YOUR KITTENS. FORGET CRYING ABOUT
[1:10:12] IT. WE'RE going to speak and it going to
[1:10:14] happen just as God spoke it because God
[1:10:16] word can't return void. Whatever God
[1:10:18] said it must COME TO PASS.
[1:10:21] WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?
[1:10:26] [applause]
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; DON'T BE CAUGHT LIKE THOSE PHARISEES AND
[1:10:30] SCRIBES READING SCRIPTURE AND WHEN JESUS
[1:10:33] COME they couldn't handle it. Amen.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; YEARS IN THE BIBLE, YEARS IN A MESSAGE,
[1:10:41] AND WHEN THE SEASON CHANGED, WHEN THE
[1:10:43] SEASON TURNED AND IT WAS MANIFESTATION
[1:10:45] TIME, THEY COULDN'T DEAL WITH IT.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; THEY WANTED TO SIT DOWN THERE QUOTE
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY ALL KNEW MESSIAH IS
[1:10:54] PROMISED. THEY ALL KNEW SEVEN THUNDER
[1:10:56] REVIVAL IS PROMISED. THEY ALL KNOW ABOUT
[1:10:58] BRIDE REVIVAL. THEY ALL KNOW WHAT THE
[1:11:00] PROPHET SAID THAT THERE WILL BE A
[1:11:02] MANIFESTATION OF THE SEVEN THUNDERS THAT
[1:11:04] PEOPLE WILL FLY FROM EVERYWHERE SAYING
[1:11:06] THE SEVEN THUNDERS WILL BE MANIFESTED.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; NOT TALKED, not taught but manifested.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. YOU GOT TO BECAUSE
[1:11:17] HEY, LISTEN. ECCLESIASTES 3 said there's
[1:11:19] a TIME AND SEASON FOR EVERYTHING UNDER
[1:11:21] HEAVEN. YOU COULD CRY, YOU COULD BALL,
[1:11:23] BUT WHEN YOU OVERCOME, YOU COME. NO
[1:11:25] DEVIL COULD STOP YOU FROM GOING FREE.

[1:11:30] DEMON POWER, NO SIN, NO SIN COULD STOP
[1:11:34] YOU FROM GOING FREE FROM WHEN YOU
[1:11:36] OVERCOME. [applause and cheering]
[1:11:54] If the devil bind you, it's one thing,
[1:11:56] BUT DON'T BANG YOURSELF.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; DON'T BIND YOURSELF.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; WHO THE SON OF MAN SET FREE IS FREE
[1:12:04] INDEED.
[1:12:06] DON'T BIND YOURSELF. [screaming]
[1:12:11] [applause]

[1:12:22] be free, but you're still boundar
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; like Lazarus, he was free. He was raised
[1:12:26] from the dead, but they said, "Loose him
[1:12:27] and let him go."

[1:12:31] them dead THINGS ALL AROUND HIM. AS I
[1:12:33] SAID, PREACHER READY. HE COME OUT
[1:12:34] JUMPING. SO,
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; he couldn't walk. They done wrap him UP
[1:12:37] ALREADY. SO, HE HAD TO COME OUT, JUMP
[1:12:39] IN. SO, HE ALIVE. [screaming]
[1:12:40] HALLELUJAH. BUT HE TIED UP. HE ALIVE,
[1:12:42] BUT HE WRAPPED UP. SOME OF YOU, YOU HEAR
[1:12:44] HIM. I'M PREACHING TO you this morning.

[1:12:49] caught OFF FOR YOU. ALL THEM BIT. YOU'RE
[1:12:51] NOT A CHICKEN BROTHER. [cheering]
[1:12:56] Don't get no CHICKEN BOYFRIEND, CHICKEN
[1:12:57] GIRLFRIEND. YOU'RE NOT A CHICKEN
[1:12:59] BROTHER. YOU ARE [screaming] EAGLE.
[1:13:01] [cheering]
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; EAGLE WAS MADE TO SOAR. EAGLE WAS MADE
[1:13:05] TO FLY.
[1:13:07] [cheering]
[1:13:09] [applause]
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; GLORY.
[1:13:23] HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; America is struggling with with a man in
[1:13:30] power and a position where they the
[1:13:32] question his character to hold office.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; How did he get there?
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; God will not have that.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; God will not have a bunch of jokers.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why the throne have
[1:13:47] gods.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; FIRE ALL AROUND THE THRONE. SARAH AROUND
[1:13:53] THE THRONE. THAT'S WHY HE SAID NO
[1:13:55] SCALING COULD JUST GO AND SIT ON THAT
[1:13:57] THRONE OR TAKE FROM THAT THRONE. YOU
[1:13:59] HAVE TO BE PRESENTED. FIRE HAVE TO COME
[1:14:02] OFFERING BY FIRE. FIRE HAVE TO TAKE A
[1:14:04] MAN INSIDE OF JAIL. FIRE HAVE TO TAKE A
[1:14:07] WOMAN INSIDE OF JAIL. [cheering]
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; TALK IS TALK. BUT APPROACHING THAT
[1:14:13] THRONE, THAT'S DIFFERENT. AMEN.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; The cleansers, the burners, the seraphs
[1:14:20] are there to cleanse the worshipper.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come to bring offering to
[1:14:24] God.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; You want to offer something to God. He
[1:14:27] said before you could even offer it. Go
[1:14:28] to your brother and make it right.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Don't come and play offering. Offering
[1:14:32] and doing what?
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; And you have against your say brother,
[1:14:34] what you doing with that ought?
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; It's faith, virtue, knowledge,
[1:14:37] temperance, patience, godliness, and the
[1:14:38] top brotherly kindness.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; That's the spirit of forgiveness. That's
[1:14:42] the fullness.
[1:14:44] the seven steps.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; That's as far as you can go because the
[1:14:47] spirit is God himself to come down upon
[1:14:49] you.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The spirit of God descending
[1:14:52] like a dove.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; You can't operate that. God does.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; But you could get up on the seventh
[1:14:57] step.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; And that seventh step is forgiveness.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; That seventh step is when you could drop
[1:15:02] yours and the whole grudge and EXCUSES
[1:15:04] AND BLAME SOMEBODY AND SOMEBODY AND
[1:15:07] SOMEBODY YOU'RE STILL AMEN down
[1:15:10] somewhere inside of there. You have to
[1:15:12] get OUT OF THAT.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; GET in the real spirit of forgiveness.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Look at Jesus. He said, "Father, forgive
[1:15:17] them. They know not what they do.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; And they want to crucify him. Crucify
[1:15:20] him." But he was hard on that.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; He had cursed them. He had swear against
[1:15:24] them. He stood there and said, "Forgive
[1:15:25] them."
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; They don't even know what they're doing.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; They don't know what they're killing.
[1:15:29] They don't know what they unfolding
[1:15:30] inside of there. Satan don't even know
[1:15:32] if Satan only understood. He was going
[1:15:34] to leave Jesus alone. But when he died,
[1:15:37] he shed his blood. He released a spirit.
[1:15:39] NOW WE ARE HERE. AND SATAN CAN HOLD US
[1:15:42] BACK. NOTHING, NOTHING, nothing but to
[1:15:44] stop the sons of God from coming forth
[1:15:46] in this hour. This is what the whole
[1:15:48] creation is groaning for. Not to have a
[1:15:50] nice church and NICE CHURCH MEMBERS AND
[1:15:52] SO ON AND SUIT AND TIE. THAT'S NOT WHAT
[1:15:54] THE CREATION GROANING FOR. OH,
[1:15:56] HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:15:57] WE'RE GOING TO RIP THE VEIL OFF OF WHO
[1:15:59] HE IS. YOU'RE GOING TO see who he is.
[1:16:01] AND AS YOU'LL BEHOLD HIM, YOU'RE GOING
[1:16:03] TO become
[1:16:05] [applause]
[1:16:07] seated.
[1:16:09] One second. And the robe
[1:16:12] God seeing for seeing Elijah's day were
[1:16:16] numbered. He had so long he could stay
[1:16:19] here on earth so long as everybody has.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; God put boundaries you can't pass.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; So don't worry. God know where to find
[1:16:29] everybody.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; That's a good one.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:39] go there knock on door. You know where
[1:16:40] he wants to live.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; No, when a man overcome his overcome.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; So he was going to have a success of
[1:16:51] Elijah. But when he did, God called this
[1:16:54] man. Listen, he wasn't in no se seminary
[1:16:58] when he called him.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was plowing a field with a yolk
[1:17:02] of ox doing the service, taking care of
[1:17:05] his mother and father. God called him to
[1:17:09] be the successor of Elisha or Elijah.
[1:17:12] Perhaps many up at the school thought
[1:17:14] they were short to do, going to be his
[1:17:17] successor. They were going to wear his
[1:17:19] robe as soon as he was finished. But God
[1:17:22] does the calling.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; God does the choosing.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:29] God does the electing
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; and God does the setting in order.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; God has set in the church some apostles,
[1:17:44] some prophets, some teachers, some
[1:17:45] evangelists and pastors. God does that
[1:17:48] himself.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; We cannot make one hair black or white.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Neither can we add one thing to our
[1:17:55] stature by taking thought.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. God in his infinite grace and by
[1:18:01] his election and fornowledge
[1:18:04] sets these things in order.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; And every wheel works just right.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; I like that. I would be a discouraged
[1:18:15] man this morning if I didn't believe in
[1:18:17] the election and calling of God.
[1:18:21] IF I THOUGHT THAT THIS world was left to
[1:18:24] the outcome of it by the power of man
[1:18:27] and by the wisdom of man and by the
[1:18:29] United Nations who never even mentioned
[1:18:31] God's name, I'll be a discouraged
[1:18:32] person. But I'm not looking to that for
[1:18:35] the outcome. I look to the pages of this
[1:18:37] old book here
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; where God wrote it out and everything
[1:18:41] will come just exactly the way he said
[1:18:44] it.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; So you're not looking for man for your
[1:18:47] outcome. You're not looking for uncle
[1:18:49] and auntie and tanty and this bishop and
[1:18:51] THIS MINISTER ASSOCIATION. YOU'RE NOT
[1:18:53] LOOKING FOR THAT FOR YOUR OUTCOME.
[1:18:54] YOU'RE LOOKING TO THE word
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; for your outcome.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Because once that word IS SPOKEN OVER
[1:18:59] YOU, nothing going to stop it.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus had to find that woman of the
[1:19:03] well. He had to find Batimus. HE HAD TO
[1:19:05] FIND PETER AND JOHN AND JAMES AND ALL OF
[1:19:08] THEM. HE HAD TO FIND THEM BECAUSE THEIR
[1:19:09] names was in that book.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; And every name on the book shall be,
[1:19:12] must be, have to be delivered.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord a shout. Praise God.
[1:19:18] God not asking about your hair, your
[1:19:20] complexion, your height, your color,
[1:19:22] your race, where your country COME FROM,
[1:19:24] OR THE LANGUAGE YOU SPEAK. ALL YOU'RE
[1:19:26] LOOKING FOR IS THE NAMES ON THE BOOK.
[1:19:28] THAT TIME, MICHAEL SHALL STAND UP AND
[1:19:30] EVERY NAME FOUND WRITTEN IN THAT BOOK.
[1:19:35] That's why the mighty angel came out
[1:19:36] with the book open in Revelation 10 TO
[1:19:39] CALL YOUR NAME. THE SEVEN THUNDERS IS
[1:19:42] WHAT CALLED YOUR NAME. THAT WAS CHRIST,
[1:19:44] YOUR HUSBAND.
[1:19:46] THAT WAS CHRIST YOUR HUSBAND. THAT'S
[1:19:48] YOUR HUSBAND.
[1:19:50] [cheering]
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; REVELATION 10:1 IS YOUR HUSBAND.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; REVELATION 10:7 IS YOUR MESSENGER.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT IN THE HOUSE.
[1:19:59] YOUR HUSBAND DROPPED DOWN IN REVELATION
[1:20:01] 10 TO CALL YOU WITH A SHOUT. IT WAS THE
[1:20:04] COVENANT ANGEL BECAUSE HE SWORE BY
[1:20:06] HIMSELF. WHAT DID HE SWEAR? THAT TIME
[1:20:09] SHALL BE NO LONGER. EVEN TIME ITSELF
[1:20:12] RUNS OUT. SO WE COME INTO THE fullness
[1:20:14] of time. WHEN TIME ITSELF RUNS OUT, THAT
[1:20:17] MEAN WE BREAKING INTO ETERNITY, breaking
[1:20:19] into the eighth day, BREAKING INTO A
[1:20:21] HOLY CONVOCATION. OH, GIVE THE LORD SOME
[1:20:23] PRAISES, PEOPLE. TIME ITSELF IS ABOUT TO
[1:20:26] RUN OUT.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; SO, what are YOU DOING WITH YOUR LIFE?
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; TIME is about to run out.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Remember, it's only what you do for the
[1:20:35] kingdom is what counts.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Not your selfish living. Living for your
[1:20:38] own self, your own pleasure. That ain't
[1:20:40] counting for nothing. That's your
[1:20:41] stinking rotten selfish being. We're not
[1:20:44] TALKING ABOUT THAT. PERFECT ETERNAL LIFE
[1:20:47] IS LIVING FOR OTHERS.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; NOT YOU SITTING ON YOUR rotten flesh
[1:20:50] living FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND
[1:20:52] THAT'S ALL. NO, YOU GOT TO GO HARDER
[1:20:54] THAN THAT. OH, GLORY to God. JESUS DIED
[1:20:56] FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD, KNOWING THAT
[1:20:59] SOMEONE'S GOING TO GET IT, that you're
[1:21:01] going to work it out, THAT YOU'RE GOING
[1:21:03] TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HIS CALLING IS.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; I feel excited this morning. Don't
[1:21:10] wonder why Peter said, "Make your
[1:21:11] calling and election sure." Make a call
[1:21:14] sure. Make it sure God call me. God
[1:21:16] elected me. What the devil want to land
[1:21:18] on me? What the devil doing resting on
[1:21:20] me? What the devil doing binding on me.
[1:21:22] I have a calling of God. This what
[1:21:24] Samson understood. THAT'S WHY YOU could
[1:21:26] pray ONE SMALL ORDER. THIS WHAT DANIEL
[1:21:28] UNDERSTOOD. THAT'S WHY YOU COULD GO IN
[1:21:30] THE LION'S DEN. THIS WHAT THE HEBREW
[1:21:31] BOYS UNDERSTOOD. THEY HAD A CALLING OF
[1:21:33] GOD. AND IF THE AND SEED SHALL POSSESS
[1:21:36] THE KIDS OF THE ENEMY, THEY UNDERSTOOD
[1:21:38] THAT. SO THEY FACED THE LION AND LION.
[1:21:41] TO FACE THE FIERY FURNACE. Come on now.
[1:21:43] WHAT ARE YOU FACING? COME ON, MAN UP
[1:21:46] THIS MORNING. HALLELU UP THIS MORNING.
[1:21:49] WHAT ARE YOU CONFRONTING THIS MORNING?
[1:21:51] WHAT IS THAT GOLIATH [screaming] IN YOUR

[1:24:44] sodomite and and filthy ways. God regret
[1:24:47] he made man and everything else with the
[1:24:49] filthy living and everything else. But
[1:24:50] the Bible said Noah found grace
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; in the eyes of the Lord. Not because he
[1:24:55] was taller, not because he was handsome,
[1:24:57] not because he was special, not because
[1:24:59] he had a degree, but he was elected. He
[1:25:02] was chosen of God. And if you understand

[1:26:39] body had to be changed. Sarah with all
[1:26:41] her unbelief. Sarah who didn't have a
[1:26:43] revelation. Sarah who God didn't spoke
[1:26:45] to because God told Abraham through that

[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; to be manifested. Sons have a built-in
[1:27:52] thing to come forth. It's a built-in
[1:27:54] thing. AND IN THAT THIS LAST DAY,

[1:28:13] When you understand that you keep your
[1:28:14] face clean as a daughter of God, you
[1:28:16] don't need no makeup to look nice. You
[1:28:19] don't need no makeup for some man to be
[1:28:20] attracted to you, be attracted to your
[1:28:22] character AND THEN GET THE right husband
[1:28:24] in your life. Praise God. You don't have

[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; my early years, they wanted to pick
[1:29:09] white for me. I said, "Don't do that.
[1:29:11] I'm a son of God.

[1:31:01] BE DELAYED BUT NOT DENIED.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. IT COULD BE DELAYED BUT NOT
[1:31:06] DENIED.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE WHO YOU ARE.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; YOU BELONG TO GOD,
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; NOT SOME MAN. YOU BELONG TO GOD.
[1:31:18] [cheering]
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Your real mother and father is God. Ah,
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; your natural mother and father is bodies
[1:31:28] that God used to come through.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; That he going to get the gospel to you.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; If it was quite up somewhere, some some
[1:31:34] some rich person place and think the
[1:31:36] gospel can't come to you because you're
[1:31:37] driving in the bends or whatever it is
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; and you go bend up in your bends, you
[1:31:42] know, your mind and everything else
[1:31:43] there and you just they can't get to
[1:31:44] you. But God put you through here
[1:31:46] through tear, what kind of struggle and
[1:31:48] poverty and what kind of struggle and
[1:31:50] the Bible say the poor have the gospel
[1:31:52] preached unto them. So you don't know
[1:31:53] why you're struggling. God struggling
[1:31:54] but but you but you are heir of the
[1:31:56] earth. You are heir of all things things
[1:31:58] seen and unseen. You just don't know who
[1:32:01] you are yet. But when you begin to
[1:32:03] understand that you are possessor of all
[1:32:05] things and your father own a cattle on a
[1:32:07] toy hills and all the earth is mines and
[1:32:10] the fullness thereof. The earth and all
[1:32:12] therein and God could make a way for you
[1:32:15] and God could multiply you and bless you
[1:32:17] and add to you. Praise God. The devil
[1:32:19] want to subtract from you. God could add
[1:32:21] and multiply to you. In blessing I will
[1:32:23] BLESS THEE. IN MULTIPLY I MULTIPLY THEE.
[1:32:26] OH COME on say amen somebody. Make me
[1:32:28] feel religious now. My God. Let your
[1:32:30] faith reach out. Praise God. Stop
[1:32:32] studying your bills. Study the blessings
[1:32:34] that GOD COMING UPON YOUR LIFE TO PAY
[1:32:36] YOUR BILLS. YOU WORRY ABOUT YOUR BILLS.
[1:32:38] WHAT ABOUT THE BLESSINGS THAT GOD WANT
[1:32:40] TO RIP the heaven open and pour it upon
[1:32:42] your life?
[1:32:45] [applause]
[1:32:47] [cheering]
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:32:54] [cheering]
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; You want TO HEAR SOMEBODY SHOUT HIM?
[1:33:00] [applause and cheering]
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; I don't know how I'm preaching this
[1:33:08] tonight.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Are you reaching over yet?
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; So, you're not looking for man for the
[1:33:16] outcome. are looking on the page of this
[1:33:18] old book where God wrote it out.
[1:33:19] Everything will come exactly the way he
[1:33:20] said it. And that's all. So the only
[1:33:22] thing we need to do is to line up with
[1:33:24] them, but not line up with them, but
[1:33:26] line up with Calvary.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Line up with God.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Line up with his word. Stay with his
[1:33:31] word.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; No matter how much it looks like it's
[1:33:33] going to be that way, it's going to be
[1:33:34] the way God intends it to be.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; It can't be nothing else. For him being
[1:33:39] infinite, know the end from the
[1:33:41] beginning. And he makes everything come
[1:33:43] to his praises.
[1:33:45] Everything come to give God praise
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; and honor. My if that wouldn't take make
[1:33:51] the courage in a Christian, nothing can
[1:33:53] go wrong.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; That's 10% saying amen. I heard you.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; I heard your silence
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; on that one day. I heard it. I heard the
[1:34:04] silence. I didn't hear amen. You not
[1:34:06] hear the silence.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Nothing can go wrong. After all, it's
[1:34:11] not our Bible. It's his. It's not our
[1:34:14] wisdom. It is his. And the only one
[1:34:16] thing we have to do is to put our faith
[1:34:18] and trust there and sit still and see
[1:34:21] the glory of God and see how it moves
[1:34:24] around to its place and every wheel move
[1:34:26] in it. It may be scattered from side to
[1:34:28] side. It will move right into its place.
[1:34:31] When God speaks the word, he knew the
[1:34:34] end from the beginning. He knew who who
[1:34:36] he was going to choose. He knew Elisha
[1:34:39] would take Elijah place before the world
[1:34:41] was ever formed. Everything had to work
[1:34:43] exactly right. And we are worried about
[1:34:46] our loved ones and so forth. Will they
[1:34:48] ever come in? Their names, if they were
[1:34:51] written in the lamb's book of life
[1:34:53] before the foundation of the world, they
[1:34:54] will work right in there. That's the
[1:34:56] only thing you could do.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; So that should free you from bing about
[1:35:03] your loved ones and understand if their
[1:35:05] name is there, Michael coming to deliver
[1:35:06] them.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises people.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; The serpent grab Paul.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; I thought snakes not supposed to bite
[1:35:26] preachers.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Serpent grab Paul. Now watch. Paul
[1:35:34] didn't fear because Jesus said they take
[1:35:37] up serpents. It shall not harm them. So
[1:35:39] he walked over here and shake him off in
[1:35:41] the fire.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Turns out walk get some sticks and put
[1:35:44] back in the fire.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; He turned around, warm his back, turn
[1:35:48] around, warm his hands. The native said,
[1:35:50] "Why don't he die?"
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Why don't that man die? Because that
[1:35:56] particular snake when it bit you is some
[1:35:57] seconds and you're gone.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; So they watching him and they see him
[1:36:00] man dead proof.
[1:36:03] Hallelujah.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; But Paul, here we go, WAS SO FULL of the
[1:36:07] Holy Ghost.
[1:36:15] [applause]
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; HE WAS FULL OF IT.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; FULL OF IT.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO BE FULL OF IT.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; IT'S SO FULL THAT SICKNESS.
[1:36:26] [applause]
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; YOU WALK INTO HOSPITAL PERSON CANCER AND
[1:36:34] WHEN YOU START TO WALK IN THERE THE
[1:36:36] CANCERS HAVE TO TREMBLE

[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WAITING FOR IT? IT WILL COME.
[1:37:18] [applause and cheering]
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; But said he was so full of the Holy
[1:37:23] Ghost
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; that the poison couldn't poison him.
[1:37:29] They put JOHN ON THE AISLE OF PATMOS IN
[1:37:32] a pot OF OIL AND HOT IT AND HE TRIED TO
[1:37:34] BOIL it out of HIM AND THEY STILL
[1:37:36] COULDN'T BOIL IT. WHEN THE FIRE WENT OUT

[1:37:50] Ghost. YOU CAN'T OUT THE HOLY GHOST. YOU
[1:37:52] CAN'T POISON THE HOLY GHOST. FORGET THE
[1:37:55] LORD. AND THIS IS YOUR PROMISE.

[1:38:34] CHURCH STRIKE HOME

[1:38:52] LISTEN,
[1:38:54] [applause]
[1:39:00] [applause]
[1:39:02] [cheering]
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; you may be seated.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Paul had no car, you know.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; Paul had no Maxi or no taxi.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; No motorbike.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Paul didn't a cold water.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Paul had no Pepsi or Coke
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Sprite.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; He had no fast food. Kentucky.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; But he was full of
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; ghost.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Jesus full of the Holy Ghost.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Take take five loaves.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Two fishes.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Full of the Holy Ghost.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Bless it.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Tell the disciples, share it.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; And something happened.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; That was miraculous.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; You can't explain that.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; That's a paradox.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Incredible, but true. It feed 5,000
[1:39:51] people and had bread remaining.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; You you you didn't hear what your man
[1:39:55] say.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; Jesus full OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; WINE RUN OUT IN THE WEDDING.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; They come and ask him
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; and tell him why out
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; as if he he sell wine.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; And Jesus tell them go and draw water.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Draw water.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Not not go and get grapes.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; No. Go draw water.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; He don't need the grapes.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; HE BYPASSED THE PROCESS
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; AND TURN THE WATER into wine.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; That's what we talking about.
[1:40:20] My God. My God. If this don't lift your
[1:40:24] faith, I don't know what is.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; If this don't raise up your faith, I
[1:40:27] don't know what is.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Full of THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; FULL OF THE Holy Ghost.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Full of the Holy Ghost. Like a like a
[1:40:36] stuck inside here. You're going to be
[1:40:37] full of the Holy Ghost. Full. You can't
[1:40:40] overcome this. You're going to be full
[1:40:41] of the Holy Ghost. My God. You're going
[1:40:42] to beat THAT DEVIL AROUND AND FULL OF
[1:40:44] THE HOLY GHOST. PAUL, I KNOW. PETER, I
[1:40:47] KNOW YOU. I KNOW THE BRIDE. I KNOW
[1:40:50] BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE FULL OF THE
[1:40:52] HOLY GHOST. [cheering]
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; GLORY.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Now, this word was scattered through
[1:41:03] seven ages.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; And God had to send a message,
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; seven angels
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; to gather the scattered word
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; to tie it back into the word
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; to bring the entire Holy Ghost. And the
[1:41:13] prophet said the entire Holy Ghost has
[1:41:14] visited the church. Amen.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; That is what make Luke 17:30
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; the son of man
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; in a son of man.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; So Jesus Christ was veiling a prophet
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; which is the Holy Ghost itself
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; and he spoke out prophetic words, spirit
[1:41:27] spoken words to go and anoint a bride.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; So when you in Trinidad, YOU COULD BE
[1:41:32] WHEREVER THE WORD HAD TO FIND YOU.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; That's why you're in church today.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; Something inside of you is what the word
[1:41:38] connect with. Oh, give the Lord a shout
[1:41:41] in the house
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; because it's spirit given word.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That means if that word
[1:41:47] going out, it means it going out to
[1:41:49] catch you
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; to pull you in,
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; to wheel you in.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; Because the word has you have to become
[1:41:54] the sons of God.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; That's what power was given for. That
[1:41:58] was the word was given for not to become
[1:42:00] a church member,
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; but for you to be a reproduction of God.
[1:42:04] Amen.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; So church supposed to be an avenue in
[1:42:07] which you get connect back to your God.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; It come like your cell phone activated.
[1:42:13] Church supposed to be a place where you
[1:42:14] get the activation then
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; where you could CALL HIM FOR YOURSELF.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; NOT THROUGH some priest,
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; not through some bishop, BUT YOU HAVE
[1:42:22] YOUR OWN LINE
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; BACK TO YOUR FATHER.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; COME ON, SAY AMEN SOMEBODY.
[1:42:27] [applause]
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; But this part is incredible.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; After the doors of the Gentiles is
[1:42:39] closed,
[1:42:41] God will anoint
[1:42:43] a church. Then
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; what does that mean? The doors of the
[1:42:48] Gentiles is closed.
[1:42:51] The Bible call the Jews the olive tree,
[1:42:55] olive branch. And God cut them off
[1:42:57] [snorts] to put this wild olive branch
[1:42:59] in
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; called the Gentiles.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; And the Bible talk about the times of
[1:43:03] the Gentiles.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Until the fullness of the Gentiles come
[1:43:06] in.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; So therefore, the Gentiles have a
[1:43:08] specific time.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; Not a specific time, but call it the
[1:43:10] fullness of the Gentiles.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Until the time of the Gentiles come in.
[1:43:14] So it means that when that time come in,
[1:43:16] not one more name person going to be
[1:43:18] saved.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:20] That's right.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; So don't wait for the door to shut
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; because Noah had 120 years where people
[1:43:27] had an opportunity to receive it
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; to receive the message. And then when
[1:43:31] God started to tell Noah, listen, time
[1:43:32] up. Your fullness of time has come.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; So start to get the animals in two by
[1:43:37] two. People see that and thought well
[1:43:39] you having a farm inside of there and
[1:43:41] whatnot. Making fun of Noah.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; But afterwards God shut the door. Amen.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Seven days a sat
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; preaching to doomed people.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; The ark sat preaching to people who
[1:43:53] could not be saved.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Would that repeat again? Yes.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; In church. Yes.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; People have to come to church and hear
[1:44:02] it and can't be saved.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Because they already reject it.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; You mean those people that act was
[1:44:07] preaching to know for no? Yes. For seven
[1:44:09] days
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; until the rain start to fall.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. THEN PEOPLE SAY, "NOAH, NOAH, I I
[1:44:14] SEE IT NOW."
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; But the only problem is Noah didn't shut
[1:44:18] the door.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; God did.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; And what God door, God shut,
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; no man
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; could open.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; And what God door man God opened, no man
[1:44:30] could shut.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; So when God shut the door, the door is
[1:44:32] shut.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. So while you have a
[1:44:35] chance to make things right, while you
[1:44:38] have a chance to be reconciled to God,
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; please do. Amen.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; I couldn't wait for my family to serve
[1:44:48] the Lord. You know,
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; that was a personal choice.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; That's I choose that.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; I choose this is the harder way. This is
[1:44:54] our way. Easy to smoke and drink and run
[1:44:56] around. But it this is the harder way.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; This is Christian soldier.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; This is not natural soldier. This is
[1:45:03] Christian soldier
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; where your your life is bare before all.
[1:45:09] A Christian life is a public life, you
[1:45:10] know.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, it was a private life. No, it's a
[1:45:17] public life.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; It's a public life. It's a public
[1:45:19] testimony. Not you living private.
[1:45:22] You're a Christian. I want everybody to
[1:45:24] know him.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; You're not a Christian.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; You might be impersonating. A Christian
[1:45:29] is a public servant.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; That's why God say take the blood and
[1:45:32] put it in your door post.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Don't put it behind the door. Well, I
[1:45:35] ain't like how it looking. The color not
[1:45:36] blending. No, it don't have that. You
[1:45:38] know, detach will take you out.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Put it on your doorpost
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; because you want to see it.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Your neighbors could see it. Anybody
[1:45:44] walk and see blood, blood, no blood, no
[1:45:46] blood, no blood, blood, blood, blood.
[1:45:48] Everybody could see it.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; That's how God want your testimony
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; on your job, your brokers to see it.
[1:45:54] [applause]
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; After the doors of the Gentiles closed,
[1:46:04] God will anoint the church.
[1:46:06] He who is filthy be filthy still.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; He's righteous, righteous still.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; He is holy. Let him be holy still. God
[1:46:13] will anoint the church with the power of
[1:46:15] God and things will be taking place.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; Not only then, that's prophecy. He's
[1:46:21] doing it now. That was William Brham
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; recognizing his message. But Abraham
[1:46:26] says now the church has not recognized a
[1:46:27] day like Israel back in her home
[1:46:29] Palestine. She's going to be forced into
[1:46:31] work out the churches. Why? She didn't
[1:46:33] recognize her hour. He said, "Let him
[1:46:35] that filthy be filthy still. Let him
[1:46:37] that holy be holy still." Now, above a
[1:46:40] woman, she can't be. Because God said,
[1:46:43] "Woman, don't cut your hair."
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "Above your woman, she can't
[1:46:46] be." Now, that sounds very flat. That's
[1:46:49] the scripture. The Bible says she
[1:46:51] dishonor her head. Her head is a
[1:46:53] husband. His head is Christ. So, she
[1:46:56] dishonors Christ. How can she be
[1:46:58] dishonorable and not be filthy? Let that
[1:47:00] got bo here, let her keep it. So in
[1:47:04] other words, when that time come, it
[1:47:07] sets your condition.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; It's like a snapshot that snaps you and
[1:47:12] that's your picture.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; You can't change it.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; That's what that means.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; So the time for change is now.
[1:47:22] [applause]
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; You must want change.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; You must desire transformation.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; You must hate yourself. Amen.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; You must want God's will.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; You have to ask God. You want a
[1:47:37] revelation of his will for your life.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; You can't JUST GO TO A DRIFT, YOU KNOW,
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; like a driftwood. Let the stream of life
[1:47:45] just take you. The current carrier
[1:47:47] wherever it hit, wherever it bounce,
[1:47:49] just a stream of life and you go in with
[1:47:51] life. Everybody's doing that. But that
[1:47:54] same driftwood could be carved out into
[1:47:56] a boat and put a power of an engine to
[1:47:59] power it, to guide it, to direct it.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; This is what you want,
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; you don't want to be drifting
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; because if you drift, you'll head
[1:48:07] towards the falls.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; I want to say if you drift, you will
[1:48:11] head towards the falls.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Don't drift. Let your wife be guided.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; Let your life be directed by the spirit
[1:48:19] of God.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:48:23] She that wear shorts,
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; keep on wearing them.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Let he that denies the word keep on
[1:48:28] denying it. You cannot change. Fixed
[1:48:30] condition, you will not be able to
[1:48:33] change.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. But let him that holy be
[1:48:36] holy still.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Let him that righteous be righteous
[1:48:39] still.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; Like Israel back in the homeland,
[1:48:42] national force put Israel in the home,
[1:48:44] national force put Israel in the
[1:48:46] homeland. National force will put the
[1:48:48] work of the churches. But the power of
[1:48:50] God will put the people in the bride.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; That's why I love that song, oh Lord,
[1:48:54] send the power just now.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Baptize everyone.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; Many people ask, "Will the bride, will
[1:49:00] this, will this?" What the bride is the
[1:49:03] elected of God.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Period.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; So nobody could own the bride and said,
[1:49:08] "Oh, what church have the bride?"
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; That's not the word.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; The bride is the
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; elected of God.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Elected of God.
[1:49:18] The church goes through. That's the one
[1:49:20] who says whosoever will let him come.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; But the bride is elected of God.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; So you don't want to be part of
[1:49:28] whosoever will. Why come? Because
[1:49:30] whosoever will come. I hear that. No. Be
[1:49:32] the elected.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Be the bride. That's what you must
[1:49:34] desire to be. Isn't that right?
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; Watch. There are five. Oh, let's skip
[1:49:38] that. Praise God. But each night we want
[1:49:41] every person that's not a Christian hope
[1:49:43] something will be said or done that
[1:49:45] you'll become a Christian. And if you're
[1:49:47] not and if you have already believed in
[1:49:49] the Lord Jesus and accepted him and been
[1:49:50] baptized and you haven't received the
[1:49:52] Holy Ghost as yet, don't let this get
[1:49:54] by. Let this be your night. Remember,
[1:49:57] here we go. Remember, there will be just
[1:50:01] so many names on that book.
[1:50:04] And when the last name is added, that's
[1:50:06] all of it. Yours might complete it.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; Let's go a little further. Are you with
[1:50:13] me?
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. When the lamb come and took the
[1:50:16] book out of the right hand of him that
[1:50:17] sat upon the throne, that was the book
[1:50:20] of redemption.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Those names was put in there before the
[1:50:24] foundation of the world. And when that
[1:50:26] last name was called the book, the plan,
[1:50:30] everything else was revealed. Then the
[1:50:32] seven seals was opened by the lamb. The
[1:50:34] mystery of the whole Bible was hidden
[1:50:36] there. And the last name that goes on
[1:50:38] the book, then he changes a little bit.
[1:50:41] or the last name that's redeemed that
[1:50:45] was put on that book.
