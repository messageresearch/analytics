[43:42] Hallelujah Hitler tried to make a super
[43:44] race Pharaoh tried to make a super race

[44:02] churches that same pharoh Spirit come
[44:04] upon pastors ministers message Pope I am
[44:08] more than yours therefore you under me
[44:10] and I am above and who I'm I'm not the
[44:12] you the tail I'm the head
[44:15] hallu God hate that
[44:18] foolishness and yet there's a prophecy
[44:21] that is going to be a super race a super
[44:24] church when has been near the headstone
[44:30] so you know the headstone to get to The
[44:33] Headstone it hones down it is shaped to
[44:37] The Headstone and just before the
[44:38] headstone is what Holy Spirit slot and
[44:42] on top under that Holy Spirit is
[44:44] brotherly kindness Spirit of forgiveness
[44:47] abos is a Shepherd dream had a rock Box
[44:50] on top there and a big jar honey it
[44:52] couldn't hold the Holy Ghost the Holy
[44:53] Ghost was boiling through the church and
[44:54] he said no church could hold the Holy
[44:56] Ghost it has boil out the
[44:58] trash but no church could hold the Holy
[45:01] Ghost so no church could say I have it
[45:03] the other one don't have it that's lies
[45:04] that's foolishness you can't say that
[45:07] because the Holy Ghost is poured on
[45:10] individuals so individuals in the church
[45:12] could hold the Holy Ghost not the church
[45:14] as a group so anytime a pastor a
[45:17] minister say they that church have it
[45:19] what that it is he's a liar run for your
[45:23] life oh give the Lord a shout in the

[45:54] vaccine and all this medication they
[45:56] have you say as much as they save as
[45:58] much as they
[45:59] killed we know that every time you hear
[46:02] the break up a du the side
[46:06] effect they go to it very fast the side
[46:09] effect is called blindness go kidy
[46:14] problem because man hand on
[46:17] it as long as man hand is the knowledge
[46:20] of
[46:21] Good and
[46:24] Evil so always part of good am car good
[46:27] take from one point to next

[46:32] car
[46:35] man what does it what makes a man do
[46:40] that right want this power thing and
[46:42] what does that is because there's
[46:44] something behind it and he tries here we
[46:46] go to take his own way instead of taking
[46:49] God's way and that's the reason they try
[46:51] to build super denomination super

[1:05:44] wasn't wrapped the classical people
[1:05:45] wrong it it wasn't it was wrapped as a
[1:05:47] gift a gift from God sent from God a god
[1:05:51] they didn't know nothing about they
[1:05:53] claim they did but they claim they were
[1:05:55] looking for him them but he did not come
[1:05:56] the way that they thought he was looking
[1:05:59] coming according to their Creeds they
[1:06:01] could not receive God's Gift he was
[1:06:04] wrapped different he was wrapped like a
[1:06:06] baby he was born in a manger he came
[1:06:10] from poor people he come from a bunch of
[1:06:13] Fanatics how could they receive
[1:06:15] something like that no wonder there was
[1:06:16] no room for him then he dropped down
[1:06:18] here and said this there's no room for
[1:06:20] him yet in the churches they Ed him they
[1:06:23] don't believe in it they will say a away
[1:06:25] with such a is
[1:06:27] fanaticism people say that in ch
[1:06:30] Fanatics that Catholic all over again

[1:15:27] don't want the Holy Ghost today is
[1:15:30] because they know what's wrapped in it
[1:15:32] they don't want the experience of the
[1:15:34] Holy Ghost they want to hear word they
[1:15:37] want to hear Mysteries they want to hear
[1:15:39] I never see it so the Bible talk about
[1:15:42] people in the last days having itching
[1:15:43] ears he have teachers because they want
[1:15:46] something new the ti of the old promises
[1:15:48] dropping on them
[1:15:58] they watch a person receive the Holy
[1:15:59] Ghost they stand out there and see that
[1:16:01] woman as low as she could be till even
[1:16:03] dogs would how look at her see that
[1:16:05] woman come up from the altar a new
[1:16:07] person see that woman clean up her life
[1:16:10] get out and act like a lady see one that
[1:16:12] runs Bridge patties smoke four or five
[1:16:14] cigarettes a day hang around these
[1:16:15] saloons a regular Barfly as they know
[1:16:18] accept this gift of God that's wrapped
[1:16:21] in the package called Jesus Christ it
[1:16:24] will spoil every bit of your world fun
[1:16:26] because you won't stand for it it does
[1:16:29] something to them it changes people and
[1:16:32] this is the bum tonight I didn't even
[1:16:34] know the prophet said it he said people
[1:16:35] don't want to be
[1:16:38] changed oh they want to go to church
[1:16:40] that's right they want to shake hands
[1:16:43] they want to me people like this is a
[1:16:44] literal Facebook then you meet other
[1:16:45] faces and
[1:16:48] thing but to say change no they like the
[1:16:52] self
[1:16:56] Hallelujah anyone who can explain
[1:16:59] anything you don't have to accept it by
[1:17:00] Fai anymore hallelujah it's things that
[1:17:02] we cannot explain that we have to accept
[1:17:05] by faith we cannot explain God no man
[1:17:07] can explain God he's Sovereign he is
[1:17:11] great he's Mighty watch and then watch
[1:17:14] he is Great and Mighty we just accept it
[1:17:16] because we know he's there then by our
[1:17:18] faith here we go in accepting it he
[1:17:20] brings the response back to us the
[1:17:23] baptism of the Holy Spirit amen so
[1:17:26] Abraham had Faith one when after he got
[1:17:28] the holy ghost or before he got the Holy
[1:17:29] Ghost before so Abraham Faith expressed
[1:17:32] to God he really believed and then God
[1:17:35] give him the Seal of circumcision
[1:17:36] evidence that the man had Faith so your
[1:17:39] praising God tonight is evidence of
[1:17:43] Faith because you're in trouble you have
[1:17:45] trouble you know don't know what going
[1:17:46] to open for you but because you believe
[1:17:48] God your faith through praise expressed
[1:17:52] to God that you are expecting him to
[1:17:53] work something for you on your behalf
[1:17:56] and God recognized that Faith as
[1:18:04] righteousness the love of God this one
[1:18:07] touched me brother George the love of
[1:18:09] God how God unfold himself and come as a
[1:18:13] Christmas package and Laing a straw when
[1:18:16] Jesus died love reaching out his own
[1:18:18] children crying for his blood he said
[1:18:20] father forgive them they don't even know
[1:18:22] what they're doing that is love now hear
[1:18:25] this one the church don't want that they
[1:18:29] want Creed we need love the church is
[1:18:33] dying by Creeds or let's say this way
[1:18:35] dying by message
[1:18:38] Doctrine it can only live by love
[1:18:42] because love is eternal life and love
[1:18:45] overcome all things love is the most
[1:18:47] powerful force their is they didn't want
[1:18:50] him because they know what was in the
[1:18:52] gift the church one creeds but he said
[1:18:55] we need love charity shall cover
[1:18:59] what a little
[1:19:01] bit a so where to
[1:19:06] charity charity never feel
[1:19:09] it some of them had it revealed to them
[1:19:12] what the gift was some of them looked
[1:19:15] into it the first ones that look into
[1:19:17] the Christmas package was Angels the
[1:19:20] Angels knew it was revealed to them and
[1:19:24] maybe one of the little Shepherds laying
[1:19:27] on the hill that night crying there was
[1:19:29] no room for him and the same time a
[1:19:32] Shepherd come on the hill the Angels
[1:19:33] came down and begin to sing The First
[1:19:34] Noel today in the city of David is born
[1:19:37] Christ the Savior it was revealed the
[1:19:40] Angels revealed to Shepherds and he said
[1:19:43] that's the only way anybody in the world
[1:19:45] will ever know what's in that package it
[1:19:49] has to be revealed to
[1:19:52] you so brother George by lack of
[1:19:55] Revelation is why we have so much
[1:19:59] division not because of Revelation but
[1:20:02] lack of because the intellectuals have
[1:20:04] interpretation and knowledge information
[1:20:07] but not Revelation because revelation
[1:20:09] will bring Christ back on the scene oh
[1:20:12] hallelujah hallelujah revelation will
[1:20:15] bring Christ back in position as the
[1:20:17] center of the Bible center of the book
[1:20:20] Center of Your Life Center of everything
[1:20:24] you will be able to see Jesus
[1:20:26] Christ all right that's the only way
[1:20:29] anybody in the world will ever know
[1:20:30] what's in the package it has to be
[1:20:32] revealed to you you turn it down say
[1:20:34] it's fism but when you get the
[1:20:36] Revelation you will seek for it God will
[1:20:39] you will open up God will come to you
[1:20:40] and supp with you and you with him you
[1:20:43] will never know it until it's revealed
[1:20:45] to you and when it's revealed to you
[1:20:47] then you'll go hunting for it when you
[1:20:50] see that it's life and the only way of
[1:20:53] life when you see that your church is
[1:20:55] dry and dead when you see your handshake
[1:20:58] with a pastor or your sprinkle or short
[1:21:00] sake has nothing to do with it you'll go
[1:21:02] to
[1:21:03] investigating when you're laying on the
[1:21:05] bed dying doctor say there's nothing
[1:21:07] left for you you'll be dead in a few
[1:21:09] minutes you'll want to look into that
[1:21:11] package then course it will be turned
