[28:32] Daniel chapter 12 we have us one two
[28:36] four and at that time shall Michael
[28:40] stand up the Great Prince which standeth
[28:43] for the children of thy people and there
[28:47] shall be a time of trouble such as never
[28:50] was since there was a nation even to
[28:53] that same time and at that time thy
[28:57] people shall be delivered every one that
[29:00] shall be found written in the book many
[29:04] of them that sleep in the dust of the

[29:32] end many shall run to and fro knowledge
[29:36] shall be increased we learn from 1st
[29:39] Corinthians chapter 10 when I read from
[29:42] verse 1 moreover brethren I would not
[29:46] that ye should be ignorant how that all
[29:49] our fathers were under the cloud and all
[29:53] passed through the sea
[29:55] were all baptized unto Moses in the
[29:57] cloud and in the sea did all eat the
[29:59] same spiritual meat that they all drink
[30:02] the same spiritual drink for the drunk
[30:04] of that spiritual rock that followed him
[30:06] that rock was Christ but with many of
[30:10] them God was not well pleased for they
[30:15] were overthrown in the wilderness now
[30:18] these things were our examples to the
[30:23] intent we should not lust after evil
[30:27] things as they also lusted neither be
[30:31] idolaters as were some of them as it is
[30:35] written the people sat down to eat and
[30:37] drink and rose up to play neither let us
[30:42] commit fornication as some of them
[30:44] committed and fell in one day three and
[30:46] twenty thousand neither let us tempt
[30:49] Christ some of them also tempted and
[30:52] were destroyed of the Serpent's neither
[30:55] murmur ye as some of them also murmured
[30:57] and were destroyed of the destroyer now
[31:01] all these things happen unto them for
[31:07] example and they are written for our
[31:12] admonition upon whom the ends of the
[31:16] world become final scripture Ephesians
[31:19] chapter three one we want to read from
[31:22] verse 3 blessed be the God and father of
[31:27] our Lord Jesus Christ
[31:28] what blessed us with all spiritual
[31:30] blessings in heavenly places in Christ
[31:32] according as he had chosen us in him
[31:36] before the foundation of the world I
[31:39] wish it be wholly without blame before
[31:41] him in love having predestinated us unto
[31:44] the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[31:47] to himself according to the good
[31:48] pleasure of his will to the praise of
[31:51] the glory of His grace where any
[31:52] admittance accepted in the beloved in
[31:55] whom we have redemption through his
[31:56] blood the forgiveness of sins according
[31:57] to the riches of His grace wherein he
[32:00] had a bonded towards us in all wisdom
[32:02] and prudence having made known unto us
[32:05] the mystery of his will
[32:07] according to his good pleasure which he
[32:10] had purposed in himself that in the
[32:13] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[32:17] might gather together in one all things
[32:20] in Christ both which are in heaven and
[32:24] which are on earth even in him may God
[32:28] bless his word you may be seated

[33:07] what's the under great expectation our
[33:11] title this morning the title is the
[33:13] fullness of times I said I had the
[33:16] fullness of times arrival inspiration
[33:20] waitin for the manifestation of the sons
[33:24] of God that's the inspiration waitin for
[33:27] the manifestation of the sons of God on
[33:29] this Scripture this inspiration is on
[33:31] Romans 8:19 it says for the illness
[33:34] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[33:38] the manifestation of the money of the
[33:40] sons of God
[33:40] annalee amplified it says for the even
[33:43] the whole creation all nature waits
[33:46] expectantly and longs endlessly for
[33:50] god's sons to be made known it's waiting
[33:55] for the revealing or the disclosing of
[33:58] the essential that's not function that
[34:01] is sonship so the creation itself is
[34:04] waiting for the revealing or the
[34:07] unfolding of the essentia or this is
[34:10] tremendous just imagine the whole
[34:12] creation is groaning for the
[34:14] manifestation of the sons of God when
[34:16] God will pull the veil off of his sons
[34:18] now these are sons of God not humans at

[34:26] of God express God Myron said he came on
[34:29] his own his own received him not but as

[48:40] kill him they don't know what they
[48:42] unfolding inside idea say time to even
[48:44] know if they don't only understood he
[48:46] was going to leave Jesus alone but when
[48:48] he died shadows release the spirit no we
[48:51] are here and see that yeah hold us back
[48:54] nothing nothing nothing
[48:55] put a stop the sons of God from coming

[49:46] has a good one you know way to live no
[49:55] and I'm an hour cometh how come so he's
[50:02] gonna have a success of Elijah when he
[50:04] did God call this man this he wasn't a
[50:08] Nocera seminary when he called him he
[50:12] was plowing a field but the yoke of oxen
[50:14] the service taking care of his mother
[50:17] and father God called him to be the
[50:21] successor of Elijah or Elijah perhaps
[50:24] many up at the school thought they were
[50:26] sure to do going to be his successor
[50:29] they were going to wear his robe as soon
[50:31] as he was finished but God does the
[50:34] callin God does the chosen God does the
[50:41] electing and God does the settin in
[50:45] order

[51:02] hair black or white neither can be added
[51:06] wanting to our structure by taking
[51:08] thought God in His infinite grace and by
[51:12] his election and foreknowledge sets
[51:16] these things in order and every real
[51:21] work just right I like that
[51:25] I would be a discouragement this morning
[51:27] is
[51:28] I didn't believe in the election and
[51:30] calling of God if I thought that this
[51:34] world was left to the outcome of it by
[51:37] the power of man and by the wisdom of
[51:40] man and by United Nations who never
[51:42] mentioned God's name I'd be discouraged
[51:44] person but I'm not looking to that for
[51:46] the outcome I looked at the pages of
[51:49] this old book here where God wrote it
[51:51] out and everything will come just
[51:54] exactly the way he said it so you're not

[1:14:14] scattered to seven inches and Gordon
[1:14:16] sent a message seven angels the Canada
[1:14:19] scattered word too tied back into the
[1:14:21] world to bring the entire Holy Ghost and
[1:14:24] the promise of the entire Holy Ghost has
[1:14:26] finished in the church that is what make
[1:14:28] looks something today the son of man in
[1:14:31] a sauna man
[1:14:32] so Jesus Christ was dealing a prophet
[1:14:34] which is the Holy Ghost itself and he
[1:14:37] spoke word prophetic words spirit spoken
[1:14:39] words to go and anoint a bride so when
[1:14:42] you ensure that you could be wherever
[1:14:44] the would ever find you that's why
[1:14:46] you're in church today something inside
[1:14:49] of you it's what the would connect might
[1:14:51] give the Lord a shout in the house
[1:14:53] because it's spirit given word
[1:14:56] hallelujah that means if that word gone
[1:14:59] out it means it or not to catch you to
[1:15:02] put you in - will you in because the
[1:15:05] word has you have to become the sons of
[1:15:07] God
[1:15:07] that's what power is given for that was
[1:15:09] the word was given for not to become a
[1:15:11] church member but for you to be a
[1:15:13] reproduction of God
[1:15:16] so church supposed to be an Avenue in
[1:15:18] which you get connect back to your God
[1:15:21] they come back and cellphone act
[1:15:23] activated she supposedly pleasewe again
[1:15:26] the activation then when you could call
[1:15:28] him for yourself not to some priests not
[1:15:32] to some bishop but you have your own
[1:15:34] line back to your father I want say me
[1:15:37] somebody
[1:15:38] [Applause]
[1:15:44] but this part is incredible after the
[1:15:48] doors of the Gentiles is closed
[1:15:52] God will anoint a church what does that
[1:15:58] mean the doors of the Gentiles is closed
[1:16:02] by the call the Jews the olive tree
[1:16:06] olive branch and God cut them off to put
[1:16:09] this wild olive branch in called the
[1:16:12] Gentiles and the bad let's talk about
[1:16:14] the times of the Gentiles until the
[1:16:16] fullness of the Gentiles come in
[1:16:18] so therefore the Gentiles have a
[1:16:19] specific train not a specific time but
[1:16:22] call it the fullness of the Gentiles
[1:16:23] until the time the Gentiles coming in so
[1:16:26] it means that when that time come in not
[1:16:28] one more name person would be saved so
[1:16:33] don't wait for the door to shut because
[1:16:37] Noah 120 years where people had
[1:16:39] opportunity to receive it to see the
[1:16:41] message and then when go outside at
[1:16:43] Eleanor listen time up your fullness of
[1:16:45] time has come
[1:16:46] so started getting hemas in two by two
[1:16:49] people see that untoward without work we
[1:16:51] have enough found inside earlier that
[1:16:53] they can funnel or but afterwards God
[1:16:55] shut the door
[1:16:56] seven days into acts at preaching to
[1:17:00] doomed people the acts at recent the
[1:17:04] people who could not be saved
[1:17:07] oh yeah would not repeat again yes in
[1:17:10] church yes people have accomplished a
[1:17:13] turn here and can be saved because they
[1:17:16] were already rejected you mean those
[1:17:18] people that act was preaching to no fun
[1:17:20] for now yes for seven days until the
[1:17:22] rains are the fall then people say no no
[1:17:25] I said no but the only problem is no I
[1:17:29] didn't shut the door
[1:17:30] got it and what God door what shut no
[1:17:36] man could over
[1:17:38] what God don't man Oh God open romantic
[1:17:41] shut
[1:17:42] so when watch the door the door shut Oh
[1:17:45] hallelujah so while you have a chance to
[1:17:48] make things right while you have a
[1:17:49] chance to be reconciled to God please do

[1:18:00] the Lord you know I wanna push no choice
[1:18:02] that's I choose that I choose this is
[1:18:05] the hard way this is our way either

[1:18:09] this is the hard way this is Christian
[1:18:11] Julia
[1:18:13] they're not natural soldier this is
[1:18:15] Christian soldiers where your real life
[1:18:19] is beer before all a Christian life is a
[1:18:21] public life you know or it was a private
[1:18:28] life no it's a public life it's a public
[1:18:30] life is a public testimony and only we
[1:18:32] live in private who your Christian a way
[1:18:35] a way to know him you know a Christian
[1:18:38] might be impersonating a Christian is a
[1:18:41] public servant that's why God say take
[1:18:43] the blood of a 10-8 doorpost no put it
[1:18:45] behind the door well I am like how I'd

[1:19:10] [Applause]
[1:19:13] after the doors of the genders closed go
[1:19:16] along to it then he was filthy filthy
[1:19:19] still he was right just right just still
[1:19:21] he is holy let him be holy still
[1:19:24] God will anoint the church with the
[1:19:26] power of God and things will be taking
[1:19:30] place not only then that's prophecy you
[1:19:33] do not know as a greater than Brennan
[1:19:35] recognizing the day in his message but
[1:19:37] her mom says now the church has not
[1:19:38] recognized a day I guess you're back
[1:19:40] then a whole Palestine she's gonna be
[1:19:42] forced and to work on the churches why
[1:19:44] she didn't recognize him bahawa
[1:19:46] he said let him that 30b but he still
[1:19:48] let him not holy be holy still
[1:19:50] Noah Bobby a woman she can't be because
[1:19:54] God's a woman look at your hear he's a
[1:19:57] bug a woman she can't be no that sounds
[1:19:59] very flat that's the scripture the Bible
[1:20:02] says she dissed under her head her head
[1:20:05] is a husband his head is Christ
[1:20:07] so she dis Una's Christ how can she be
[1:20:09] dishonorable and not be filthy let's see
[1:20:12] the gut Bob here let her keep it so now
[1:20:16] is when that time comes it sets your
[1:20:19] condition it's like a snapshot that
[1:20:23] snaps you and that's your picture you
[1:20:25] can't change it that's what that means
[1:20:29] so this time that changes now
[1:20:37] you must want change you must desire
[1:20:40] transformation you must hit yourself you
[1:20:45] must warn God's will
[1:20:46] you have to ask Lord you want our
[1:20:48] revelation of his will for your life you
[1:20:51] can't just go you know you're adrift you
[1:20:53] know like I just would let the stream of
[1:20:56] life just stick here the current carrier
[1:20:58] wherever it hit whatever it bumps
[1:21:01] that's the stream of life and you go in
[1:21:02] with life everybody's doing that but
[1:21:05] that same driftwood could be carved out
[1:21:08] into a boat and put the power of an
[1:21:10] engine to power it to guide it to direct
[1:21:13] it this is what you want you're going to

[1:41:42] the days of Noah you know these are
[1:41:43] Christ and so on notice spirit the
[1:41:47] dynamics of the promised word to drive
[1:41:49] to get into the church and drag them to
[1:41:52] cover yonder and then to the rapture so
[1:41:55] he prophesied that the Spirit will come
[1:41:57] to drive us to Calvary where we have a
[1:41:59] crucifixion with Christ isn't that right
[1:42:02] praise God now you say wait a minute
[1:42:04] know what the prophets rebuked those
[1:42:06] woman and MD is the quantum woman he
[1:42:08] turns no wait a minute you write in the
[1:42:09] scriptures known a woman that lives in
[1:42:11] worldly pleasure can't be the pleasures
[1:42:14] of God so the woman that lives in
[1:42:15] worldly pleasure is dead while she's
[1:42:17] living and that's what the prophet said
[1:42:19] sin poor the woman that lives in this
[1:42:21] worldly condition is dead while she's
[1:42:23] living and if she rejects mercy she can
[1:42:26] cross a separation line where there is
[1:42:28] no place for no more and then where is
[1:42:31] she act with a painted eyes a pot here
[1:42:33] she crossed the line with nowhere to
[1:42:35] come back he has got to be listen
[1:42:37] there's got to be a ministry preached to
[1:42:40] her but remember it's all over it is
[1:42:44] done it's just a horn
[1:42:46] there will be a ministry that will show
[1:42:49] great signs of wonders joy I said so
[1:42:50] there will be no time for redemption
[1:42:52] it's all over the lamb done took his
[1:42:54] book his redeemed is over as Jesus first
[1:42:57] preached I was rejected and then went
[1:42:59] and haunted dolls that were the air
[1:43:00] preached to them that were in prison
[1:43:02] could not repent no time for salvation
[1:43:04] that same ministry will have to repeat
[1:43:07] again what if that could be the triple
[1:43:10] treat sinner lost whatever is there I
[1:43:13] hope it's not what if it is think of it
[1:43:15] a minute now what if it is god forbid I
[1:43:17] got children but it looks pretty close
[1:43:20] Oh hallelujah
[1:43:23] Norman estreet all ministry done the
[1:43:26] same nor preached exactly when zinyak
[1:43:29] and when he went into the ark there were
[1:43:31] seven days nothing happened and the
[1:43:33] testimony preached to the tomb not by
[1:43:36] speaking in tongues not by dancing in
[1:43:38] the spirit not by joining in church not
[1:43:40] at the foot of the Spirit
[1:43:42] watch but it's the word listen dare it
[1:43:46] is if the only unlooked he was Messiah
[1:43:48] he was the Living Word made manifest
[1:43:51] you said the church you go right on just
[1:43:53] the same but remember all this time

[2:21:54] of life not a Sunday like everyday like
[2:21:57] to personally as a Christian God is
[2:22:00] calling his children aside by
[2:22:03] manifestation they don't have to say one
[2:22:06] word about it no people just the money
[2:22:08] necessary so kind so Christ like God
[2:22:17] Colin is chilling aside my manifestation
[2:22:19] they don't have to say one word about it
[2:22:21] you see something happen positionally
[2:22:23] place sons of God God getting into him
[2:22:26] to order exactly with the same thing and
[2:22:28] he just has as much authority his word
[2:22:30] is just as good as an archangel even
[2:22:33] better the son was abducted put on a
[2:22:36] high place set out the changes ropes
[2:22:38] changes colors the father a ceremony
[2:22:40] this is my son of henceforth his
[2:22:42] governor his ruler he's over all my
[2:22:45] heritage all I have belongs to him oh
[2:22:47] praise Allah that's the reason the
[2:22:49] coming of the seals at the finishing of
[2:22:52] the seventh seal the mystery of God
[2:22:54] should be finished to know who God is
[2:22:56] what he is how he lives his nature his
[2:23:00] being you are supposed to be all the way
[2:23:02] up there by that time to bring us into
[2:23:06] the full stature of the sons of God of
[2:23:08] God
[2:23:09] yeah you come right back to the mystery
[2:23:11] of the seventh seal and a little 7 scene
[2:23:13] of seven thunders and he said we
[2:23:15] supposed to be all the way up there like
[2:23:17] that time or them thought you suppose me
[2:23:19] in their bag that time what time the
[2:23:21] fullness of time when the full of signs
[2:23:23] of tongue is time to see the
[2:23:25] manifestation of the sons of God we are
[2:23:28] waiting on it Oh glory to God hallelujah
[2:23:31] praise be to Jesus hallelujah seven see
[2:23:35] brother branham know for the endtime
[2:23:37] message this seal he revealed all the
[2:23:42] six seals but he don't say nothing about
[2:23:44] the seventh so the seventh seal is for
[2:23:47] the anti message
[2:23:50] first for season history also 450 salt
[2:23:54] on the altar for seal be system and so
[2:23:57] on six year old quick 7c silence it
[2:24:02] dosent nothing for the seventh seal but
[2:24:04] the end time seal when it starts will be
[2:24:07] a total secret only when it sucks but at
[2:24:10] the finishing we just read that you
[2:24:13] suppose to be weight of the road no all
[2:24:15] faith and virtue and knowledge and
[2:24:16] temperance at the finishing what it is
[2:24:18] for the top of the pyramid when the
[2:24:20] pyramid comes to its stuff we are at the
[2:24:23] end time the opening of the seventh seal
[2:24:25] Oh glory to God so when he made man a
[2:24:28] god he give him a domain as a zoo domain
[2:24:30] goes from sea to sea from shore to shore
[2:24:32] he had control of it and Jesus came
[2:24:34] being the one without sin he proved it
[2:24:37] when the winds blew he said peace be
[2:24:38] still so it was more than talk he proved
[2:24:41] it by manifestation isn't that right
[2:24:43] then he said if you should see this
[2:24:45] mountain be moved do-don't you shall
[2:24:46] have what you says so go back to Genesis
[2:24:48] know the world and nature is groaning
[2:24:50] moving for what for the manifestation of
[2:24:53] the sons of God
[2:24:54] when true sons born sons fill son speak
[2:24:56] and their word is backed I believe on
[2:24:58] though I started getting bored of it now
[2:24:59] see this mountain and brother desire and
[2:25:02] so I give it to you in the name of Jesus
[2:25:04] Christ oh praise God from future Who am
[2:25:08] I almost done now in Ephesians 1:10 he
[2:25:10] said you're putting on is called the
[2:25:12] fullness of time it's called not the
[2:25:14] seven days called the fullness of time
[2:25:16] when the fullness of time has come when
[2:25:18] time has been fulfilled when there is no
[2:25:20] more time then you go into eternity
[2:25:23] after the seven churches is over
[2:25:25] Luther's ages over Methodist is over
[2:25:27] Pentecostal ages over no you go into
[2:25:30] what eternity no more servants no more
[2:25:32] trees no more other then eternity oh my
[2:25:34] that is where the fullest time is that
[2:25:36] give me a church or we said that oh

[2:25:42] name of the Lord praise God so this
[2:25:44] common early stone I'm gonna close up

[2:26:29] message born to all the world and the
[2:26:32] only way that God can preach the gospel
[2:26:36] today is true like a lump of clay so God
[2:26:42] Khepri Chicago to mechanical tip he has
[2:26:44] a preacher two lumps of clay thus men
[2:26:46] and that's the reason you see people
