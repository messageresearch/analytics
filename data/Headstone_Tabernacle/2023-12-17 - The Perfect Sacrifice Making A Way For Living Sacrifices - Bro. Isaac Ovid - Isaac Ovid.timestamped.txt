[1:09:41] the house of the Lord this morning
[1:09:43] certainly want to welcome one and all
[1:09:45] and if you have your Bibles would you
[1:09:47] turn with me to two portions of
[1:09:50] scripture I certainly appreciate the
[1:09:52] songs uh the songs service this morning
[1:09:54] with
[1:09:55] Anthony what an
[1:09:57] anointing what a
[1:10:01] presence so I want to read two portions
[1:10:03] of scripture reading first Peter
[1:10:06] 2 and want to read from Romans 12 and
[1:10:10] brother ID actually read from this first
[1:10:13] Peter scripture I believe last week so
[1:10:15] we are
[1:10:18] connecting to the Turning of the corner
[1:10:22] that the spirit has led us to along this
[1:10:24] journey amen So reading 1 Peter chapter
[1:10:28] 2 I'm reading from verse one wherefore
[1:10:31] laying aside all
[1:10:33] malice and all Gile and hypocrisies and
[1:10:37] envies and all evil
[1:10:40] speakings as newborn babes desire the
[1:10:43] sincere milk of the word that ye may
[1:10:45] grow thereby if so be ye have tasted
[1:10:49] that the Lord is
[1:10:50] gracious to whom coming as unto a living
[1:10:53] living Stone disallowed indeed of men
[1:10:57] but chosen of God and precious ye also
[1:11:00] as Lively stones have built up a
[1:11:04] spiritual house and holy priesthood to
[1:11:07] offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable
[1:11:10] to God by Jesus Christ so ye also as
[1:11:13] Lively stones have built up a spiritual
[1:11:15] house and holy priesthood to offer up
[1:11:18] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[1:11:21] by Jesus Christ wherefore also it is
[1:11:24] contained in the scripture behold I lay
[1:11:26] in Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect
[1:11:29] precious and he that believeth on him
[1:11:30] shall not be confounded unto you
[1:11:33] therefore which believe he is precious
[1:11:36] but unto them which be disobedient the
[1:11:38] stone which the builders disallow that
[1:11:40] same the same is made a head of the
[1:11:43] corner and a stone of stumbling and a
[1:11:45] rock of offense even to them which
[1:11:48] stumble at the word being disobedient
[1:11:50] where unto also they were appointed but
[1:11:53] ye we are a chosen
[1:11:55] generation a royal priesthood and holy
[1:11:58] nation A peculiar people that he should
[1:12:01] show forth the Praises of him who had
[1:12:04] called you out of Darkness into His
[1:12:05] Marvelous Light which in time pass were
[1:12:08] not a people but and now the people of
[1:12:11] God which had not obtained Mercy but now
[1:12:14] have obtained mercy and reading Romans
[1:12:18] 12 reading from verse
[1:12:21] one I be te ye therefore Brethren by the
[1:12:25] mercies of God that he present your
[1:12:28] bodies a Living Sacrifice holy
[1:12:31] acceptable unto God which is your
[1:12:34] reasonable service and be not conformed
[1:12:37] to this world but be transformed by the
[1:12:39] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[1:12:43] what is that good and acceptable and
[1:12:46] perfect will of God may the Lord add a
[1:12:48] blessing to the reading of his word you
[1:12:50] may be seated this morning in the
[1:12:52] presence of the Lord It's it's certainly
[1:12:53] a great privilege to be here one more
[1:12:56] time in the house of God can the church
[1:12:58] say Amen can we give the Lord a hand of
[1:13:00] Praise this
[1:13:01] morning amen amen amen and what a time
[1:13:05] we are living in as we come to the end
[1:13:06] of this year and people are in the
[1:13:09] spirit of all kind of things there's a
[1:13:11] spirit of War there's a spirit of of
[1:13:14] argument there's a spirit of of of
[1:13:16] depression and frustration there's a
[1:13:17] spirit of of spiritual wickedness
[1:13:20] there's a spirit of Christmas there's a
[1:13:22] spirit of closing out the year there's a
[1:13:23] spirit of party there's a spirit of
[1:13:25] relaxation there's all kind of spirits
[1:13:27] going on but we are in the spirit of the
[1:13:29] coming of the lord we are under
[1:13:30] expectation for something to take place
[1:13:33] to change this Mortal into immortality
[1:13:35] something to change our walk change our
[1:13:38] talk change our hope change our
[1:13:40] expectation to give us a new joy to give
[1:13:42] us a new peace and we are pressing on
[1:13:44] with all that we know we are here for
[1:13:46] the battle we are here to put our
[1:13:48] shoulders to the wheel to make a church
[1:13:50] that would make a Revival we are here
[1:13:52] toing bring down charity we are here to
[1:13:55] call for fire we are here to do all that
[1:13:57] we can do for the kingdom of God we are
[1:14:00] here to put our Mark upon this Earth
[1:14:02] whether God takes us in the Rapture or
[1:14:04] he calls us home before the rapture we
[1:14:06] want the world to know that we were here
[1:14:09] we want the devil to know that we passed
[1:14:11] through we want the world to know that
[1:14:13] we came from God and we went back to God
[1:14:16] and we come from God and we going back
[1:14:17] to God and no devil no demon no
[1:14:20] depression no frustration no sickness
[1:14:23] nothing past nothing present nothing
[1:14:25] nobody could say nothing anybody could
[1:14:27] do could separate us from the love of
[1:14:29] God is that how you feel this morning so
[1:14:32] I'm excited that we are coming to a
[1:14:34] deeper realization of who we are and
[1:14:36] more importantly who's we are because we
[1:14:38] don't belong to ourselves we belong to
[1:14:41] God he paid the price he purchased the
[1:14:44] price he paid the price uh Hallelujah so
[1:14:46] the devil can't buy you because you're
[1:14:48] already paid for the devil can't hold
[1:14:50] you because you are being held in the
[1:14:52] hands of the Lord not by your strength
[1:14:54] but by his grace and by his Mercy we
[1:14:57] fall every day but the Bible said I Die
[1:14:59] daily every day we get back up uh every
[1:15:02] day we come and we're pressing every day
[1:15:04] we are worshiping every day we are
[1:15:06] praising God through the mistakes
[1:15:09] through the child we lift their head up
[1:15:11] because there's a eagle to Eagle call
[1:15:13] saying come on baby eagle Hallelujah
[1:15:16] come on fly higher lift up your head
[1:15:19] where you belong so we come to give God
[1:15:22] praise and worship we come to create the
[1:15:23] right atmosphere because we know we
[1:15:25] can't get anything unless we're in the
[1:15:27] right atmosphere this is not a Kingdom
[1:15:29] Hall it's not a lecture hall it's not a
[1:15:32] intellectual Revelation kind of thing no
[1:15:34] it's the spirit of God trying to connect
[1:15:36] with the word we have all the word from
[1:15:38] all these years the prophet of Malachi 4
[1:15:41] reveal every mystery tied up every loose
[1:15:43] end there's no new mystery there's no
[1:15:46] loose end that we need to fix he already
[1:15:48] did it because if he didn't do it he
[1:15:50] didn't fulfill his Great Commission but
[1:15:52] he tied up every m

[1:17:38] in my heart that God is calling us to be
[1:17:40] living
[1:17:43] sacrifices can the church say Amen you
[1:17:45] know in the Old Testaments brother Clark
[1:17:48] every single sacrifice had to be a dead
[1:17:51] sacrifice you killed kill the
[1:17:54] lamb Hallelujah you kill everything so
[1:17:57] it was offered up to God as a dead
[1:18:00] sacrifice but God was never happy with
[1:18:02] dead sacrifices it was a temporary
[1:18:05] solution God has always wanted a Living
[1:18:07] Sacrifice Hallelujah a sacrifice at
[1:18:10] moving a sacrifice at giving him praise
[1:18:14] Hallelujah that's why I say oh my we
[1:18:16] bring a sacrifice of praise Hallelujah a
[1:18:19] dead sacrifice can't bring a sacrifice
[1:18:21] of praise but a living sacrif ice can
[1:18:24] bring praises and it cost you something
[1:18:26] you don't feel like worshiping but your
[1:18:29] sacrifice and your worship you don't

[1:18:38] morning let me kind of lay a little
[1:18:40] Foundation we read the scripture Paul is
[1:18:43] speaking in Romans 12 he said I beseech

[1:18:50] not tell the word beseech means to
[1:18:52] almost beg
[1:18:54] forcefully beg and Paul is not speaking
[1:18:57] to anybody he's speaking to Brethren he
[1:18:59] say I beseech you therefore for Brethren
[1:19:02] so he wasn't talking to the world he
[1:19:04] wasn't talking to the man on the street
[1:19:06] he wasn't talking to the person who
[1:19:08] randomly come to church no he is talking
[1:19:10] to Believers he is saying my brothers

[1:19:15] headstone Tabernacle with everything I
[1:19:18] know he said I beseech you therefore
[1:19:21] therefore means based on what was said
[1:19:23] before so through the whole of Romans
[1:19:26] there's now therefore no condemnation
[1:19:29] all of that that he said
[1:19:31] before what shall separate us from the
[1:19:34] love of God all that I said before Oh

[1:19:39] the letter of Romans Paul preached many
[1:19:41] things he said now therefore having said

[1:19:49] your strength it will not be your
[1:19:51] ability but by the mercies of God I

[1:24:18] response when somebody says the wrong
[1:24:20] thing to you Hallelujah
[1:24:24] acceptable unto God you know God could
[1:24:27] reject
[1:24:29] it you know God could reject your
[1:24:31] offering
[1:24:33] right which is your reasonable service
[1:24:36] so I want to take a journey through
[1:24:38] scripture this
[1:24:40] morning and talk about this thing called
[1:24:43] sacrifice perfect
[1:24:45] sacrifice living sacrifice sacrifice in
[1:24:48] general and this sacrifice is a big word
[1:24:51] it is impossible possible to achieve
[1:24:53] anything in life without
[1:24:56] sacrifice and we make sacrifices whether
[1:24:59] we think about it or not whatever you do
[1:25:02] there's something means sacrifice to do
[1:25:06] it when you buy something you are
[1:25:08] sacrificing not buying something else
[1:25:11] when you go somewhere you're sacrificing
[1:25:13] the where else you could have gone so in
[1:25:16] the message show us the father brother
[1:25:19] brandom said I know you're sitting here
[1:25:20] and it's your vacation time let me call
[1:25:22] it Christmas
[1:25:23] time and you're sacrificing your time of
[1:25:26] being out somewhere else to come in
[1:25:30] church so just coming to church is a
[1:25:32] sacrifice you know just praising God is
[1:25:35] is a
[1:25:37] sacrifice anybody with me this morning
[1:25:40] when you sing is a sacrifice When you
[1:25:42] pray is a sacrifice you're sacrificing
[1:25:43] doing something
[1:25:45] else to do something that you consider
[1:25:48] maybe more
[1:25:50] valuable but sacrifice is part of life
[1:25:52] life for us to eat something needs to be
[1:25:54] sacrificed because we can't eat living
[1:25:57] things so the chicken is sacrificed it's
[1:26:00] killed it's dead so we could eat so
[1:26:03] sacrifice and death and life are inria
[1:26:06] con connected you can't separate the too
[1:26:09] and sacrifice that it was part of God
[1:26:12] because the lamb was slain before the
[1:26:14] foundation of the world so sacrifice was
[1:26:17] part of God's plan even before the world
[1:26:19] was created God already was sacrificing
[1:26:22] so if God was prepared to make a
[1:26:24] sacrifice what about you and I are you
[1:26:28] prepared to make sacrifices to get what
[1:26:30] you want are you pre because a sacrifice
[1:26:33] means a loss it means to give up
[1:26:34] something for you to excel in school you
[1:26:37] have to sacrifice playing on the field
[1:26:39] you have to sacrifice going where you
[1:26:41] want to go you have to sacrifice doing
[1:26:42] all kind of other thing because you want
[1:26:44] to go after
[1:26:45] something you can't go in the Olympics
[1:26:47] race and not sacrifice and spend time
[1:26:49] with the discipline Paul speaks of
[1:26:52] striving for the Mastery he is temperate
[1:26:55] in all things in other words he's
[1:26:56] disciplined because he's sacrificing
[1:26:59] unhealthy food because you want to be
[1:27:02] healthy everybody with me this
[1:27:06] morning people make sacrifices for their
[1:27:09] family people make sacrifices for their
[1:27:12] careers people make sacrifices for their
[1:27:14] health I'm not eating that I'm not
[1:27:15] eating that because I want to make a
[1:27:17] sacrifice because I want to be
[1:27:19] healthy people make sacrifices for their
[1:27:21] education
[1:27:22] many of the older ones the grandparents
[1:27:24] or the parents may say I never went to
[1:27:26] University but I sacrifice so that my
[1:27:28] child could do what I couldn't
[1:27:32] do you know many parents sacrifice what
[1:27:34] they ate to make sure the children are
[1:27:36] some me to eat to go to
[1:27:39] school and the same children that are
[1:27:41] sacrificed for come back ungrateful and
[1:27:43] say I want that and you you how painful
[1:27:46] it becomes when you bear the cost of
[1:27:51] sacrifice
[1:27:53] people make sacrifices for the Hobbies
[1:27:56] people tell I can't come why because
[1:27:57] they want to do something that they
[1:27:59] consider more important people make
[1:28:01] sacrifices with their financial
[1:28:03] goals I'm not going to spend on that or
[1:28:05] spend n that or spend on that because I
[1:28:07] want to achieve this are trying to save
[1:28:08] for a house or and not buying all that
[1:28:10] KFC or buying all that thing or whatever
[1:28:12] it is they're making a sacrifice and
[1:28:13] they make a choice to make a
[1:28:17] sacrifice people make sacrifices for
[1:28:19] their personal grow growth they go to
[1:28:21] work workshops and seminars and all
[1:28:23] these
[1:28:25] things and people want to come to the
[1:28:27] house of God without making a
[1:28:31] sacrifice sacrifices could be good and
[1:28:33] sacrifices could be
[1:28:35] bad because some people go after so much
[1:28:38] things they end up sacrificing their
[1:28:41] families sacrificing their
[1:28:51] marriages
[1:28:55] sacrifice people who are addicted to
[1:28:57] drugs they end up sacrificing all kind
[1:28:59] of good things to go after drugs
[1:29:01] sacrifice and they don't count the cost
[1:29:04] of
[1:29:05] it but a real sacrifice is not a
[1:29:08] sacrifice if it doesn't involve giving
[1:29:10] up something of
[1:29:12] value a true sacrifice a true sacrifice
[1:29:15] cost so God so loved the world that he
[1:29:18] gave his only begotten son it was a cost
[1:29:22] it was a price to pay it is not a
[1:29:25] sacrifice if there's no personal
[1:29:28] inconvenience when you have to hold it
[1:29:30] to the hor of the Altar and cry and pray
[1:29:32] and sigh is that a a comfortable thing
[1:29:34] but you you want something from God so
[1:29:37] you're willing to do what it takes Lord
[1:29:38] whatever it takes I'm willing to
[1:29:40] sacrifice it can the church say Amen I'm
[1:29:43] willing to lose friends I'm willing to
[1:29:44] sacrifice friends because I want
[1:29:46] something more I want to sacrifice what
[1:29:48] happened on a job I want to sacrifice
[1:29:50] the promotion because I want something
[1:29:51] more can the church say
[1:29:54] amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:29:57] and throughout scripture you see over
[1:30:00] and over the whole Bible is a book of
[1:30:02] sacrifice because the whole mystery of
[1:30:05] what brings us here is Christ himself
[1:30:06] had to die which was a perfect sacrifice
[1:30:09] so we could have access so from Genesis
[1:30:11] to Revelation you'll find sacrifice all
[1:30:13] through the
[1:30:14] scripture can the church say Amen oh it
[1:30:17] was a sacrifice for Abraham to leave his
[1:30:20] family and his home to obey that called

[1:30:30] old stories of what people had to go
[1:30:32] through for this message this message is
[1:30:33] dripping in blood this whole gospel is
[1:30:35] dripping in blood they were burned at

[1:31:28] the church amen there's no Victory

[1:31:46] sacrifice for Mary it was a sacrifice
[1:31:48] for Peter Peter give up his whole career

[1:32:06] live I don't know I'm making a sacrifice
[1:32:08] but something about that call stirred
[1:32:11] something in my soul and I've got to

[1:32:32] if she was caught it was a risky thing a
[1:32:35] sacrifice could be a costly thing but
[1:32:38] something in her heart bear record that
[1:32:40] these were men of God and she made the

[1:32:44] house it was a sacrifice for John the
[1:32:46] Baptist to preach the way he preached he
[1:32:49] preached like nobody ever preached it

[1:32:54] to endure the persecution they could
[1:32:56] have given up at any day and say I
[1:32:58] didn't sign up for this but no they made
[1:33:00] a sacrifice because they were Believers
[1:33:03] that God was more than aable to take
[1:33:05] them through it was a sacrifice for Noah
[1:33:08] what he was doing was never done before
[1:33:10] he looked crazy he looked like it made

[1:38:44] morning
[1:38:47] sacrifice it was a sacrifice for
[1:38:49] Cornelius the Bible said he gave arms he
[1:38:53] gave generously and he prayed regularly
[1:38:56] and there's a memorial in
[1:39:00] heaven for his
[1:39:03] sacrifice Abraham's blessing was tied to
[1:39:06] his willingness to sacrifice and his
[1:39:09] sacrifices when God saw Abraham was
[1:39:12] willing to kill his only
[1:39:18] son God said because of this thing here
[1:39:20] right now
[1:39:22] I'm going to unlock blessings for
[1:39:26] you can the church say Amen you you with
[1:39:28] me this
[1:39:37] morning
[1:39:39] Hallelujah David sacrifice offering
[1:39:43] peace offerings and burnt offerings what
[1:39:45] about that woman who washed Jesus
[1:39:48] feet with that Alabaster jaar expensive
[1:39:52] perfume and when people first they say
[1:39:54] what a waste you know how expensive that
[1:39:56] thing
[1:40:00] is and that that that song I wish I
[1:40:02] could sing it you don't know the cost of
[1:40:04] my
[1:40:05] praise you don't know the cost of My
[1:40:09] Worship that woman wasn't counting the
[1:40:12] cost of it because she was watching
[1:40:13] deity In the
[1:40:19] Flesh it was a sacrifice for Israel it
[1:40:21] was a sacrifice for Daniel to abstain
[1:40:23] from the King's
[1:40:30] food this thing goes deeper
[1:40:35] friends we didn't know the difference
[1:40:38] between Cain and
[1:40:43] Abel until it came to the
[1:40:47] sacrifice they would have been growing
[1:40:49] up in the house
[1:40:52] but George normal
[1:40:54] normal but when the time came Genesis
[1:40:57] 4:3 and in the process of
[1:40:59] time it came to pass that Cain brought
[1:41:02] of the fruit of the ground an offering
[1:41:03] unto the
[1:41:04] Lord so it's not that he didn't bring an
[1:41:08] offering he brought an offering of the
[1:41:11] fruit of the ground and Abel also
[1:41:13] brought of the first flings of his flock
[1:41:15] and of the fat thereof and the Lord had
[1:41:17] respect unto Abel and to his offerings
[1:41:21] you see people come to God and want to
[1:41:23] give God what they want and they give
[1:41:25] God what is
[1:41:29] left but Lord I give you this I give
[1:41:31] sometime I come to church I give a
[1:41:33] little offering I give some tithes I do
[1:41:35] this and and and God is saying well I
[1:41:36] see that offering or no
[1:41:39] but that meet the
[1:41:44] requirement you need to do better than
[1:41:47] that and the thing of it in scripture
[1:41:49] God told Kade if you lift the standard
[1:41:52] of your sacrifice and do what Abel
[1:41:58] did I will treat you and bless you amen
[1:42:03] hallelujah and this is God this is not a
[1:42:06] preacher talking to
[1:42:07] K this is not an evangelist or this is
[1:42:10] God himself saying listen I have a
[1:42:12] blessing for you you know but the
[1:42:13] quality of your sacrifice has to be
[1:42:17] different it didn't meet the standard
[1:42:21] and I want to get this a tracing this
[1:42:23] all the way to living sacrifices because
[1:42:24] some of us think we are living
[1:42:26] sacrifices or we hoping to be living
[1:42:27] sacrifices but God is saying is a he
[1:42:29] said it has to be acceptable offering
[1:42:32] spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable
[1:42:35] unto God and the acceptable nature of
[1:42:39] the offering or the sacrifice is not by
[1:42:41] our
[1:42:43] standard amen God has to accept it he
[1:42:46] has to say this is good I like this
[1:42:49] worship he has to say I like your
[1:42:51] worship I like your praise I like your
[1:42:54] dedication you could please the brother
[1:42:56] next to you and a sister next to you and
[1:42:58] they could say well I think brother so
[1:42:59] and so going to make it or no I think
[1:43:01] sister so and so had to make it the way
[1:43:03] she living and God is saying what is
[1:43:10] that verse five but unto Cain and to his
[1:43:13] offering he had not
[1:43:19] respect think about it friends think
[1:43:21] about it Church all that God has done
[1:43:24] for us and God is expecting us to give
[1:43:26] us our whole lives you realize that
[1:43:28] nothing you own is your
[1:43:31] own can I say that again can I help us
[1:43:33] to understand this thing your house is
[1:43:36] not your house know well well but but my
[1:43:38] name and indeed is not your
[1:43:41] house it's his house your car is not
[1:43:45] your car I don't care if your name on it
[1:43:47] in full your middle name and all
[1:43:51] it's not your car it's his car he
[1:43:54] provided a car for you he provided a
[1:43:57] house for you but you're renting you're
[1:43:59] borrowing it doesn't matter it's not
[1:44:00] yours it's
[1:44:02] [Music]
[1:44:06] his
[1:44:08] Hallelujah and that's where we get mixed
[1:44:10] up as believer because in a simple thing
[1:44:12] because Paul's message about Living
[1:44:14] Sacrifice is a real
[1:44:16] thing we want to give God what's left we
[1:44:18] want to take care of all of our business
[1:44:21] and then whatever left over we say well
[1:44:22] God well you could hold that to
[1:44:25] know and God is saying but you your
[1:44:27] hands that you have to work if I didn't
[1:44:29] give you your hands your all your thing
[1:44:31] you think you doing you can do you know
[1:44:33] if God give you the mind to wake up in
[1:44:35] the morning and go and do your job you
[1:44:36] know you have no job if you're losing
[1:44:37] your mind in the morning you have no no
[1:44:39] job
[1:44:40] in is he who give it in mind to work is
[1:44:43] he who put you up is he who wake up in
[1:44:44] the morning if God a wake up in morning
[1:44:46] and you do as if it's yours your praise
[1:44:48] don't belong to you belongs to God your
[1:44:49] life don't belong to you you belongs to
[1:44:51] God all that you are belongs to God you
[1:44:53] are
[1:44:54] God that's why brother over say this is
[1:44:56] not his church this is God's house this
[1:44:59] clothes I have on belongs to him my
[1:45:01] phone belongs to
[1:45:05] him and when you live that way your life
[1:45:08] begin to be different because if it's
[1:45:09] his car where you carrying his
[1:45:13] car
[1:45:18] uhuh if it's his house what you bringing
[1:45:20] it his house because your house not your
[1:45:22] own it belongs to God if you belong to
[1:45:25] him why you taking your body why you
[1:45:26] doing your body that oh come on somebody
[1:45:29] preach back to me this sacrifice you
[1:45:31] talking about now is not you trying to
[1:45:34] sacrifice to God God sacrifice to pay
[1:45:35] for you you don't belong to
[1:45:39] yourself you're not your own he already
[1:45:42] paid for you he has a receipt that say I
[1:45:44] buy you you know because you should have
[1:45:47] been dead but I paid for you so you
[1:45:49] could have life and have it more
[1:45:51] abundantly your sin required debt but I
[1:45:56] took your place and I paid the price and
[1:45:59] I died for you so the life you live is
[1:46:01] not your own
[1:46:03] life the life you live is not your
[1:46:07] [Applause]
[1:46:07] [Music]
[1:46:12] life and if that could be a revelation
[1:46:14] for you you will never have a problem to
[1:46:16] give God praise because praise has
[1:46:18] nothing to do with your failes and your
[1:46:20] sin it has to do because of you are paid
[1:46:22] for with a price you belong to
[1:46:26] him and there's nothing we could ever do
[1:46:29] to repay him there's nothing we could
[1:46:31] ever do we should have been
[1:46:35] [Applause]
[1:46:37] dead but the perfect sacrifice came to
[1:46:40] make way for living
[1:46:49] sacrifices
[1:46:52] if you are confused with coming to
[1:46:54] church you miss the whole picture you
[1:46:56] could never have a revelation of God and
[1:46:59] decide well I don't need to go to
[1:47:02] church
[1:47:04] Hallelujah because you don't belong to
[1:47:06] yourself you belong to
[1:47:10] God you can never have a problem paying
[1:47:13] TI
[1:47:15] never because your salary is not yours
[1:47:18] it belongs to God and God say you know
[1:47:21] what you keep
[1:47:25] 90%
[1:47:26] hallelujah
[1:47:31] hallelujah this the only deal you could
[1:47:33] ever have where God says my no no but I
[1:47:36] given your 90% of it
[1:47:39] hallelujah oh you don't hear me this
[1:47:42] morning your car is not yours your house
[1:47:44] is not yours your land is not yours your
[1:47:46] money is not yours your mouth is not
[1:47:48] yours your hand is not yours your
[1:47:50] children are not yours you are a trustee
[1:47:53] for your children your children belong
[1:47:55] to
[1:47:56] [Applause]
[1:47:59] [Music]
[1:48:01] [Applause]
[1:48:08] God does your
[1:48:10] sacrifice do you live a sacrificial life
[1:48:13] Lord I'm dedicating my life to you I'm
[1:48:16] surrendering my life to
[1:48:19] you
[1:48:20] but say get p and blue in the face you
[1:48:23] much people come to church and you see
[1:48:24] them on the street and he like but how
[1:48:25] you dress
[1:48:27] so if Sister Bern we don't have the
[1:48:30] strength to come back in the Pulpit we
[1:48:33] quitting because we trying to get you to
[1:48:35] understand that your life is not your
[1:48:37] own and the best thing you can do is
[1:48:39] serve god with your all with your
[1:48:41] everything with your life with your
[1:48:43] substance with your language with what
[1:48:45] you do with how you move with how you
[1:48:47] live so he can get the praise and the
[1:48:49] honor and the glory
[1:48:51] [Music]
[1:48:55] God isn't asking you to go and kill a
[1:48:57] lamb every day and do a burnt offering
[1:48:59] every day and have the evening sacrifice
[1:49:01] every day that died when Jesus
[1:49:04] died but he said praise me continually
[1:49:07] worship me continually give me honor
[1:49:10] continually and know you're going to
[1:49:11] make mistakes but raise him
[1:49:15] anyhow in your morning prayer in your
[1:49:18] evening prayer in your morning devotion
[1:49:20] in your even devotion Living
[1:49:29] Sacrifice I don't know if this helping
[1:49:31] somebody this
[1:49:33] morning and I want you to reframe it
[1:49:35] because God looked at Cain and he said
[1:49:37] to his offering he had no respect he had
[1:49:40] not respect and you know what the Bible
[1:49:42] says and Cain was very
[1:49:44] rot that's angry and his countenance
[1:49:49] fell and I always say this imagine God
[1:49:52] talking to him like Jesus and a Rich
[1:49:53] Young Ruler you know what it is to talk
[1:49:55] to
[1:49:56] Jesus and ask Jesus a question and Jesus
[1:49:58] answer you back and then you leave
[1:50:06] sorrowful by faith in Hebrews the Bible
[1:50:09] said Abel offered unto God a more
[1:50:11] excellent sacrifice let it be said of
[1:50:13] you and I brother sister that we offer
[1:50:15] to God a more excellent
[1:50:17] sacrifice not just I raise my hand
[1:50:20] because everybody raising hand no it's a
[1:50:21] it's a heart you're lifting your hand
[1:50:23] because you know that you were supposed
[1:50:25] to be
[1:50:26] dead thaty doctors I see sister Nicholas
[1:50:30] here S have a testimony of being on the
[1:50:32] doctor's
[1:50:35] bed you go through and talk to people of
[1:50:37] what they went through and say well I
[1:50:39] was ready to go but Mercy held
[1:50:42] me I'm here standing today because of
[1:50:46] Mercy you know much time really the
[1:50:48] doctors don't know what to do the
[1:50:50] doctors give up and people standing in
[1:50:51] the house of God because God wasn't
[1:50:53] finished with them
[1:50:55] yet we have no time for excuses no time
[1:50:58] to be sad no time to be depressed well I
[1:51:00] know what going on no worship God praise
[1:51:04] God thank God because his Mercy is
[1:51:08] [Music]
[1:51:09] [Applause]
[1:51:13] Everlasting by faith Abel offered unto
[1:51:17] God a more excellent sacrifice I wanted
[1:51:20] to be thinking Lord I want to do more
[1:51:21] for you I want to be named as offering a
[1:51:24] more excellent sacrifice the song leader
[1:51:27] don't have to say sing the song to say
[1:51:29] let's get in the atmosphere no you are
[1:51:31] coming in the atmosphere because you
[1:51:33] want your praise your offering your your
[1:51:36] sacrifice to be called a more excellent
[1:51:39] sacrifice you're not bringing it to the
[1:51:42] pastor you're not bringing it to the
[1:51:43] minister you're not bringing it to the
[1:51:44] church you're bringing it to
[1:51:46] God Lord let me be counted among Abel
[1:51:49] who brought a more excellent
[1:51:53] [Music]
[1:51:57] [Applause]
[1:51:59] sacrifice and all through the Old
[1:52:01] Testament all of the sacrifices were
[1:52:04] just speaking of the perfect sacrifice
[1:52:06] to come because the lamb we know was
[1:52:08] already sling before the foundation of
[1:52:09] the world so they were unfolding and
[1:52:11] they didn't even know what they were
[1:52:12] unfolding so Abel killed a
[1:52:15] lamb and God was pleased you see this
[1:52:18] man have a revelation it hasn't happened
[1:52:21] yet but he his attributes his DNA he he
[1:52:24] he tapping into his father here boy
[1:52:26] because he doing something that is about
[1:52:28] to be
[1:52:29] unfolded
[1:52:32] woo and through scripture After the
[1:52:35] flood Noah offer burnt offerings of
[1:52:38] clean
[1:52:40] animals Abraham there right to kill his
[1:52:43] his son his only son as a type of God
[1:52:45] trying to kill his only begotten son at
[1:52:47] that time he say hold your hand and God
[1:52:49] off offered a substitute as a type of
[1:52:52] the substitute that would be offered
[1:52:53] until that time came for that only son
[1:52:55] to be killed can the church say Amen the
[1:52:58] Passover Co and kill and lamb put it on
[1:53:01] the L on the doorpost when I see the
[1:53:02] blood I'll pass over you as a type as a
[1:53:06] sign as a shadow as a preparation of
[1:53:09] what to come that when you apply the
[1:53:10] token and I see that token on display
[1:53:12] I'll pass over you because judgment is
[1:53:15] about to flash through the
[1:53:16] [Applause]
[1:53:18] land each man living my Revelation not
[1:53:21] even knowing how his story fit into the
[1:53:23] great picture the great plan of God can
[1:53:26] the church say amen hallelujah
[1:53:29] hallelujah hallelujah and we know about
[1:53:31] a day of atonement when the high priest
[1:53:34] would offer sin offering for himself and
[1:53:36] the people hallelujah what a moment it
[1:53:39] was brother a poell when he had the
[1:53:41] bells that were ringing so the people
[1:53:43] know he still alive and I don't know at
[1:53:45] what point but the Geor they learn to
[1:53:46] tie him with a
[1:53:48] rope Hallelujah so that if they don't
[1:53:50] hear the bells they know to pull the man
[1:53:51] out they know that the man was dead on
[1:53:53] the inside and the offering was not
[1:53:56] accepted and every year they had to do
[1:53:58] this over and over and over praying Lord
[1:54:01] will you forgive
[1:54:03] us we are broken people we are needy
[1:54:05] people we need something and they went
[1:54:07] through that
[1:54:08] process day of atonement daily offering
[1:54:11] birth offering consecration of the
[1:54:16] Alters
[1:54:18] hallu
[1:54:20] even Elijah when he was there when not
[1:54:22] Mount Carmel
[1:54:23] Showdown Hallelujah before he went to
[1:54:26] pull out the great big bazooka brother
[1:54:28] Clarence Hallelujah after he tease them
[1:54:30] and say well maybe you're God on
[1:54:32] vacation maybe you're God on in in down
[1:54:34] down the island somewhere and they
[1:54:35] Elijah offered to God he repaired The
[1:54:38] Altar and he offered a sacrifice he said
[1:54:41] why limp ye between two opinions why you
[1:54:44] want to be in the world and you want to
[1:54:46] be a believer don't you know who you are
[1:54:48] choose you this day who you will serve
[1:54:50] and Elijah offered a sacrifice unto the
[1:54:53] Lord hallelujah let the God and answer
[1:54:56] by fire let that God be God and the fire
[1:54:59] of God dropped down and consumed the
[1:55:04] sacrifice may the Lord consume our

[2:00:18] plague
[2:00:24] Hallelujah Daniel engag in prayer and
[2:00:26] fasting as a form of spiritual sacrifice
[2:00:30] so when you're fasting that's a
[2:00:31] sacrifice in the old days but George
[2:00:35] sister June in the old days people used

[2:01:54] alarm and thing because they going to

[2:02:52] I and the close early pack the
[2:02:55] bag because it it is important to
[2:03:00] them and when it comes to the things of
[2:03:02] God it's like a crank it's like a in the
[2:03:05] old days you're turning the ice cream
[2:03:06] and turning turning
[2:03:11] turning wake up wake up wake up wake up
[2:03:14] in the morning wake up time to go wake
[2:03:16] up yeah up yet wake up
[2:03:22] you have to recalibrate that's why the
[2:03:24] Bible says be transformed by the
[2:03:25] renewing of your mind your thinking has
[2:03:27] to change about these things of God can
[2:03:30] the church say Amen is this helping
[2:03:31] anybody this morning could you take some
[2:03:34] [Applause]
[2:03:36] more Daniel fasting and
[2:03:42] praying I believe it was brother yadel
[2:03:45] spoke about the Widow's might when he
[2:03:47] preached the last time here
[2:03:49] and and it's really interesting because
[2:03:51] Jesus I want you to appreciate Jesus
[2:03:53] went to the temple many times but there
[2:03:54] only a few stories captured about Jesus
[2:03:57] in the temple read it in the
[2:03:59] Bible and of all the places brother
[2:04:03] George that Jesus decided to stand up to
[2:04:05] watch and monitor was the offering
[2:04:08] basket and he was watching what people
[2:04:12] put in
[2:04:13] in that is how we could understand this
[2:04:16] Widow who come and say but this woman
[2:04:18] amen
[2:04:19] Amen on that day he didn't choose to
[2:04:21] stand by the altar to see who was
[2:04:23] praying you he was searching Hearts he
[2:04:26] say that widow woman put more than all
[2:04:29] them who
[2:04:30] have because she put something that cost
[2:04:37] her anybody with me this
[2:04:41] morning so over the Old Testament we
[2:04:44] know that all through the Old Testament
[2:04:47] was small small pieces of what would be
[2:04:50] gathered up in that perfect sacrifice
[2:04:53] they had burnt offerings they had sin
[2:04:56] offerings trespass offerings peace
[2:04:58] offerings grain offerings drink
[2:05:00] offerings first fruit offerings these
[2:05:02] were all different offerings
[2:05:06] Hallelujah and he couldn't just
[2:05:08] sacrifice any in anywhere we talk about
[2:05:10] acceptable sacrifice we see it in the
[2:05:12] New Testament and we see God rejecting
[2:05:14] Cain's
[2:05:16] sacrifice so when you had to bring a
[2:05:18] sacrif with the Cur for your your sins
[2:05:21] amen
[2:05:23] amen the lamb that was presented was
[2:05:26] presented and it had to be inspected for
[2:05:28] a few
[2:05:30] things it had to be without blemish
[2:05:33] that's right without any physical
[2:05:36] defects so in other words you couldn't
[2:05:38] just say well let me just grab a lamb
[2:05:40] and carry it for the high
[2:05:41] priest you had to
[2:05:44] check and make sure you was getting the
[2:05:47] right kind of lamb
[2:05:50] as a type of the perfect
[2:05:52] lamb that had to be killed in your place
[2:05:56] anybody with me so that's why the B will
[2:05:58] always say Don't just come to church now
[2:06:01] pray up the service before you come to
[2:06:03] the service and when it come into the
[2:06:04] service Pray
[2:06:06] Again in other words don't just grab a
[2:06:08] lamb I I going to church and know no no
[2:06:11] no you're checking to make sure your
[2:06:12] lamb in
[2:06:13] order you checking your life in order
[2:06:15] first you're checking your attitude in
[2:06:17] order you're checking your you're doing
[2:06:19] a self
[2:06:20] inspection before the word gets to in oh
[2:06:23] God somebody help you before the word
[2:06:24] gets to inspect
[2:06:27] you because after you inspected your
[2:06:30] lamb the priest had to inspect the lamb
[2:06:32] because the priest will be just as
[2:06:34] guilty if he offered a lamb that was not
[2:06:36] properly inspected and wasn't qualified
[2:06:39] to be offered up to represent
[2:06:42] you so it's double
[2:06:46] inspection anybody with me this morning
[2:06:51] and we know Jesus perfectly typed out
[2:06:53] that when he came he was sinless Without
[2:06:56] Blame Lamb of God perfect pure innocent
[2:07:00] the lamb had to be a
[2:07:08] male in some instances the lamb in
[2:07:11] Exodus 13:2 it said the lamb needed to
[2:07:13] be the
[2:07:14] firstborn so it wasn't like just grab
[2:07:16] something and let we go to church we
[2:07:18] this this kind of half attitude thing it
[2:07:21] needs to be important to you so you
[2:07:23] realize the gravity of the
[2:07:26] situation the lamb had to be offered
[2:07:28] willingly as a
[2:07:33] sacrifice that why the Bible say when
[2:07:35] you give don't give
[2:07:36] grudgingly I
[2:07:38] give I already given only because it's
[2:07:42] pressure but I already want to give
[2:07:45] it the lamb have to be offered willingly
[2:07:48] Hallelujah
[2:07:49] and the blood had to be used for the
[2:07:53] atonement the lamb serving as a
[2:07:55] substitute to take the place of The
[2:07:58] Sinner and the lamb to be accepted by
[2:08:01] God and that man who was being
[2:08:04] represented by the lamb had to lay his
[2:08:07] hand on the lamb to feel the life leave
[2:08:11] the lamb so he could feel the impact of
[2:08:14] what was supposed to be his life leaving
[2:08:19] can the church say amen and in so doing
[2:08:21] he would experience some level of
[2:08:23] Contrition some level of remorse some
[2:08:26] level of repentance and recogn but wait
[2:08:28] a minute this thing that now dead was
[2:08:30] supposed to be me boy Lord have mercy
[2:08:33] Lord I Thank you for your forgiveness
[2:08:35] don't want to ever take it for
[2:08:39] granted and yet still that man had to go
[2:08:42] and sin again and had to go and repent
[2:08:43] again and atone again because brother
[2:08:45] Bram taught us that that life on that
[2:08:47] lamb couldn't be trans transferred to
[2:08:49] that sinner but when Jesus died it made
[2:08:52] it possible for their life to be
[2:08:53] transferred to us in the form of the
[2:08:55] Holy Ghost so we could go and sin no
[2:08:58] more that a work of transformation could
[2:09:00] begin in our heart as a birth that will
[2:09:02] take us all the way from Faith to
[2:09:03] charity to the fullness of the Holy
[2:09:06] Ghost The Life of Christ itself seven
[2:09:08] Living Voices one perfect Holy Spirit
[2:09:13] can the church say Amen thank you Lord
[2:09:17] thank you Lord
[2:09:19] but I want to could could it take some
[2:09:24] more I know I'm say I may not be too
[2:09:26] long with I think I may have misspoke a
[2:09:27] little
[2:09:29] bit
[2:09:31] Hallelujah cuz the think the think
[2:09:33] eating
[2:09:36] nice huj maybe you're not enjoying it as
[2:09:38] much as me but I enjoying this thing
[2:09:40] because I was supposed to be dead Lord
[2:09:42] broke up all over the place but God's
[2:09:44] mercy kept me amen s storel God Mercy
[2:09:48] kept you you God Mercy called you you
[2:09:50] could be young you could be 10 years old
[2:09:52] or 90 years old in the house this
[2:09:53] morning God's mercy kept you and we have
[2:09:56] a reason to thank
[2:09:58] [Music]
[2:09:59] God so we talk a lot about sacrifices
[2:10:02] brother Andrew and the sacrific and the
[2:10:03] perfect sacrifice but the reality is
[2:10:05] Sister pier in the Old Testament you
[2:10:07] couldn't just offer a sacrifice it took
[2:10:08] a priest you had to go to the priest to
[2:10:11] offer the sacrifice on your behalf you
[2:10:12] couldn't just sacrif you priest had a
[2:10:14] role to
[2:10:16] Play Hallelujah but in the New Testament
[2:10:19] we hear that you
[2:10:21] you you are
[2:10:25] priest not just priest you're a royal
[2:10:27] priesthood Hallelujah and God had
[2:10:30] dropped that to Moses nobody understood
[2:10:32] what he's talking about when he said
[2:10:33] you'll be a kingdom of priests and that
[2:10:35] just laid dant for hundreds of years a
[2:10:37] kingdom of priest because the tribe of
[2:10:39] Judah the scepter was placed there in
[2:10:42] the tribe of Judah leadership and
[2:10:44] rulership and Authority was in the tribe
[2:10:45] of Judah the kings came out to the tribe
[2:10:48] of of Judah and the priest came out of
[2:10:50] the tribe of
[2:10:52] levite but when Jesus came the lion who
[2:10:56] was the lamb who was the king who was
[2:10:59] the priest who was the perfect lamb he
[2:11:01] United the lines of kingship and
[2:11:04] priesthood and made it possible for a
[2:11:06] new order called the king priests or the
[2:11:09] royal
[2:11:11] priesthood a group of people brother
[2:11:13] Andrew who would be both Kings and
[2:11:15] Priests Royal Authority and priesthood
[2:11:19] anointing that you could offer spiritual
[2:11:25] sacrifices not just offer sacrifices but
[2:11:28] yourself being a sacrifice also
[2:11:32] [Applause]
[2:11:34] woo you understand how the requirement
[2:11:37] change because those priests in those
[2:11:39] days couldn't be living sacrifices they
[2:11:41] couldn't offer themselves they could
[2:11:43] offer the lamb they could offer the
[2:11:44] turtle dove they could off offer up the
[2:11:45] ram they could offer up these things but
[2:11:47] you are different class of priests you a
[2:11:50] royal priesthood you could offer things
[2:11:52] but you could also offer yourself he
[2:11:54] said present your bodies also and that
[2:11:56] was say after you offer your praise and
[2:11:58] your offering and your tith and you're
[2:12:00] singing and your song he said come and
[2:12:02] offer yourself offer your body as a
[2:12:05] Living
[2:12:08] Sacrifice oh can the church say Amen
[2:12:11] only a king priest could do that only
[2:12:14] royal priesthood could do that only a
[2:12:16] holy people could do that
[2:12:19] that give the Lord a shout of Praise
[2:12:22] [Applause]
[2:12:22] [Music]
[2:12:25] somebody thank you Lord so to understand
[2:12:28] what God blended into this royal
[2:12:31] priesthood Hallelujah to be a priest you
[2:12:34] couldn't come from the tribe of Simeon
[2:12:36] or the tribe of God or the tribe of
[2:12:38] Ruben or the tribe of napali or the you
[2:12:41] couldn't come from the air you have to
[2:12:43] come from the TR Lite descendants of
[2:12:45] Aaron who was the first high priest
[2:12:49] Hallelujah but the georia couldn't walk
[2:12:51] into the priesthood you couldn't apply
[2:12:53] for the priesthood you couldn't submit
[2:12:55] your resume for the priesthood if the
[2:12:57] blood of Aaron wasn't in your oh come on
[2:13:00] now in your genealogy it was never ever
[2:13:03] going to be
[2:13:04] [Applause]
[2:13:08] qualified that's why the Bible can say
[2:13:10] which in times past will not a people
[2:13:12] but are now people because that royal
[2:13:15] king priest made it possible for a
[2:13:18] spiritual blood transfusion to make you
[2:13:21] eligible to join the
[2:13:23] [Applause]
[2:13:28] priesthood anybody with
[2:13:31] [Music]
[2:13:32] me you have a privilege the other tribes
[2:13:35] don't have you know the tribe of Reuben
[2:13:37] don't have this the tribe of oh come on
[2:13:40] now the tribe of Judah don't have this
[2:13:42] but
[2:13:43] you are royal
[2:13:45] [Applause]
[2:13:46] priesthood now spiritual descendants of
[2:13:50] Aaron than you Lord God by specific
[2:13:53] declaration in Exodus and numers said
[2:13:55] the levitical priesthood will come on
[2:13:58] Aon Hallelujah but what else is about
[2:14:01] these priests because it says you are a
[2:14:03] royal
[2:14:04] priesthood so can I talk about you
[2:14:08] Hallelujah can I talk about the
[2:14:10] priesthood that you belong to brother
[2:14:12] Andrew can I talk about the priesthood
[2:14:14] you belong to brother Ashby can I talk
[2:14:17] about the pries said you belong to
[2:14:18] brother Ian
[2:14:25] paulu a priest had to be
[2:14:33] consecrated Exodus 29 the priest
[2:14:35] underwent a rigorous process of
[2:14:38] consecration to wash away the dirt the
[2:14:41] grime the the elements anoint with holy
[2:14:44] oil and wearing sacred garments so
[2:14:51] we thank God for Grace you know because
[2:14:52] some of us we miss this memo
[2:14:56] somewhere and the garments that we
[2:14:58] wearing is
[2:15:01] not it shouldn't mean any Priest
[2:15:12] cover I hope this thing sinking a little
[2:15:14] bit you know because as a priest is
[2:15:16] supposed to be consecrated
[2:15:19] by the way you wash yourself you wash
[2:15:21] away things of the world you you go to
[2:15:23] school but you wash yourself
[2:15:29] after consecrate yourself separate
[2:15:32] yourself from the world the way you're
[2:15:33] dress so I want you the way you dress
[2:15:35] was
[2:15:37] important as a priest you would have
[2:15:39] been identified when you walk among the
[2:15:42] people through the different tribes they
[2:15:43] can identify what there goes a
[2:15:45] priest because the priest as he
[2:15:47] approached the tent as he approached
[2:15:49] they could see you they to wonder I
[2:15:51] wonder where the priest
[2:15:53] is anybody see the
[2:15:56] priest the priest was easy to identify
[2:15:59] because the priest dressed a certain
[2:16:01] way he didn't dress like the other
[2:16:04] tribes when the priest came you know it
[2:16:06] was the priest
[2:16:08] coming and that's why young people used
[2:16:10] supped to be different from the world
[2:16:11] why you so because you're going to a
[2:16:13] graduation you going dress like
[2:16:15] that I coming for
[2:16:21] well it's for school so so so you so
[2:16:23] you're no longer a
[2:16:25] priest so because it's a school thing
[2:16:27] and a work event you're no longer so you
[2:16:31] you hang up your pries thing for what a
[2:16:33] day or evening or three
[2:16:36] hours you can't just give up the pring
[2:16:38] you're born into the tribe of
[2:16:41] your it too late to
[2:16:43] change the ironic spiritual Blood
[2:16:46] Brother Steven that run running through
[2:16:47] your vein you're too late you're not in
[2:16:49] Ruben you're not in Judah you're in the
[2:16:51] tribe of
[2:16:53] levite I hope they
[2:16:57] sink so I hope this puts an end in 2023
[2:17:00] to for non Priestly
[2:17:04] garments because you're a royal
[2:17:07] priesthood and this applies to
[2:17:09] everything including your WhatsApp
[2:17:13] profile and your Facebook profil and
[2:17:16] your Instagram profile
[2:17:18] Hallelujah with I can't tell it between
[2:17:21] you and the person next to you and the
[2:17:22] person in your school because you
[2:17:23] looking just like them I can't tell you
[2:17:25] a
[2:17:26] priest
[2:17:28] hallu and your school friends can't tell
[2:17:30] you even going to a church far less to
[2:17:32] be a priest
[2:17:34] Hallelujah because you trying to fit in
[2:17:36] like them so much because you don't have
[2:17:37] a revelation of who you are and you
[2:17:40] don't have a deeper understanding of the
[2:17:42] priesthood that you belong to because
[2:17:44] only as a priest you could offer
[2:17:46] sacrifice
[2:17:49] and outside of being a priest you could
[2:17:50] never offer the sacrifice so when you do
[2:17:52] that and you break the Priestly Covenant
[2:17:54] God can receive the
[2:17:57] sacrifice so you come to church we bring
[2:18:00] a sacrifice of praise and that's why you
[2:18:03] will say the offering come up like a
[2:18:06] stench not a sweet fragrance but that
[2:18:09] praise come up as a it it make God
[2:18:12] upset because it's a
[2:18:15] traditionall Jesus told that it's a
[2:18:17] tradition well I come to the church cuz
[2:18:18] every Sunday is church but God can't
[2:18:20] receive it because you have broken the
[2:18:22] Priestly Covenant of the royal
[2:18:24] priesthood that you belong to is this
[2:18:26] helping anybody this
[2:18:27] morning this may to be the kind of jump
[2:18:29] and Shout for Joy service but I trust
[2:18:31] that in some way something being said
[2:18:34] that helps
[2:18:38] you a priest was required to be holy
[2:18:41] Hallelujah maintain a high degree of
[2:18:44] Holiness and Purity they avoided Conta
[2:18:47] attack with certain unclean things and
[2:18:52] practices what practices are you
[2:18:55] avoiding because you are a
[2:18:57] priest do are there even things you
[2:19:01] avoid and this is not just for young
[2:19:02] people this is for everybody are you
[2:19:05] avoiding gossiping CU that's a thing to
[2:19:07] avoid it and backbiting and Malice and
[2:19:10] hate and you're supposed to avoid oughts
[2:19:11] and grudges and these things you
[2:19:14] know I people like to dig in the thing
[2:19:16] but they want to get incid a thing to do
[2:19:18] thing with
[2:19:19] it I see you look at him so you Vex with
[2:19:23] him you you know the question that comes
[2:19:25] after that why Vex with
[2:19:29] him and before you know it is a whole
[2:19:31] kind of is a spirit operating
[2:19:34] there but a priest wants to maintain a
[2:19:37] level of Holiness a level of Purity you
[2:19:40] want to avoid issues avoid things that
[2:19:42] pull you down take you out of the spirit
[2:19:43] you want to practice the presence of God
[2:19:45] you want to stay in the spirit you don't
[2:19:47] want anything that throws you out of
[2:19:48] that realm you want to live in there but
[2:19:50] the B said I wish I could have this all
[2:19:52] the
[2:19:53] time that's what the prophet said I wish
[2:19:55] I could have it all the time I don't
[2:19:57] want to come out of his presence the S
[2:19:59] is David say cast me not away from thy
[2:20:01] presence oh God I want to be in your
[2:20:02] presence all the
[2:20:06] time this is like a teaching service

[2:20:10] this helping you Amen brother Stephen
[2:20:12] Paul wonderful a priest that have a
[2:20:15] upright character
[2:20:18] moral Integrity uprightness they were
[2:20:21] held to a higher standard of
[2:20:26] conduct what Judah could get away with
[2:20:28] what Reuben can get away with what God
[2:20:30] can get away with what Naval can get
[2:20:32] away with as a priest you can get away
[2:20:34] with
[2:20:36] that because you held a higher standard
[2:20:39] you are called to
[2:20:40] intercede for yourself for your family
[2:20:43] for your house and you have to walk a
[2:20:45] certain way live a certain way act a
[2:20:47] certain
[2:20:49] way priests were expected to have a deep
[2:20:52] knowledge of the law of the
[2:20:55] word so they could rightly divide the
[2:20:59] word and even though Joshua wasn't a
[2:21:01] priest he told Joshua go to Joshua
[2:21:03] meditate on the word day and night and
[2:21:06] Joshua was not a
[2:21:07] priest how much more we as a royal
[2:21:10] priesthood should spend time studying
[2:21:12] the word so like Jesus we can say it is
[2:21:16] written it is written is also
[2:21:19] written you have to be able to speak the
[2:21:22] word to your
[2:21:28] situations and Priests were
[2:21:31] dedicated this morning I already feeling
[2:21:33] this thing

[2:22:21] house as a young person you are priest
[2:22:24] also we are royal priesthood can the
[2:22:26] church say Amen could you take some
[2:22:30] more but the Clarence they keep coming
[2:22:32] all hold but Clarence
[2:22:33] accountable I will stop and clar
[2:22:39] stop priest were intercessors you have
[2:22:41] to have a prayer life you are priest and
[2:22:44] you can't remember when you really
[2:22:46] pray
[2:22:48] you don't have a routine of prayer you
[2:22:50] don't have a discipline of prayer you
[2:22:51] don't have a time when you decide well
[2:22:53] in the morning in the middle of the day
[2:22:55] in the evening the night time before I
[2:22:57] go to sleep I want to speak to the
[2:23:00] Lord that's what is expected of a
[2:23:05] priest priests were on a rotating
[2:23:08] schedule to ensure that the temple was
[2:23:10] maintained today they they had to be
[2:23:12] available to report for
[2:23:15] Duty priest had to be
[2:23:21] faithful and throughout all the Old
[2:23:23] Testament as we are saying all this was
[2:23:26] imperfect operations because none of
[2:23:28] these priests with the Terran could have
[2:23:29] been perfect they all had their
[2:23:32] imperfections their sacrifices although
[2:23:34] it helped cover the sin it couldn't
[2:23:36] remove the sin it was a imperfect
[2:23:38] sacrifice performed by imperfect priests
[2:23:41] under an imperfect system but God is a
[2:23:44] perfect God so when he walked the Earth
[2:23:46] he said be therefore perfect as your
[2:23:48] father in Heaven is perfect so God has
[2:23:50] got a Perfection so all of the
[2:23:51] imperfection that existed in the Old
[2:23:52] Testament was temporary leading to a
[2:23:55] season of perfection when the perfect
[2:23:56] lamb would walk the earth to do the
[2:23:58] perfect sacrifice for people who would
[2:24:00] be brought to Perfection by A Perfect
[2:24:02] atonment anybody with me this morning so
[2:24:05] we can have a perfect praise a perfect
[2:24:07] worship Hallelujah somebody give the
[2:24:09] Lord a
[2:24:11] praise
[2:24:13] hallah and although they had the word
[2:24:16] brother Terence
[2:24:17] throughout the years when Jesus came the
[2:24:19] perfect Lamb of God they didn't
[2:24:21] recognize
[2:24:22] him throughout scripture when Isaiah was
[2:24:25] here Isaiah described it young people
[2:24:27] take note in Isaiah
[2:24:29] 537 the Bible says here he was oppressed
[2:24:32] and he was afflicted yet he opened not
[2:24:34] his
[2:24:35] mouth he was brought as a lamb to the
[2:24:38] slaughter and as a sheep before her
[2:24:40] sharers is dumb so he open up his mouth
[2:24:43] he was taken from prison and from
[2:24:44] judgment and who shall declare his
[2:24:46] generation eration for he was cut off
[2:24:49] out of the land of the living for the
[2:24:51] transgression of my people was he
[2:24:53] stricken all as the new brother cents
[2:24:55] and while the mystery of Christ is
[2:24:57] unfolding
[2:24:58] nobody within the spiritual High class
[2:25:01] of the day say my with but this is the
[2:25:03] Fulfillment of this
[2:25:06] thing Isaiah 53:10 yet it pleased the
[2:25:09] Lord to bruise him he had put him to
[2:25:12] grief when thou shalt make his soul an
[2:25:15] offering for sin he shall see his seed
[2:25:18] he shall prolong his days and the
[2:25:20] pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in
[2:25:22] his
[2:25:24] hand all of this Isaiah said brother
[2:25:27] Shan that those in that day could have
[2:25:29] looked and seen even after Jesus death
[2:25:32] the same but this thing lining up with
[2:25:33] scripture so it goes to show people
[2:25:35] could have books and tapes and messages
[2:25:37] and fail to see what's unfolding before
[2:25:39] them before their very
[2:25:44] eyes Isaiah 53:12 therefore will I
[2:25:47] divide him a portion with the great and
[2:25:49] he shall divide a spoil with the strong
[2:25:52] because he had poured out his soul unto
[2:25:53] death and he was numbered with the
[2:25:56] transgressors and he bear the sin of
[2:25:58] many and many intercession for the
[2:26:00] transgressors all that is in Isaiah
[2:26:02] anybody who was a spiritual student
[2:26:04] could say but wait a minute if I go back
[2:26:06] to that thing but everything I see in
[2:26:07] here looking like this thing and yet
[2:26:09] still they rejected the perfect
[2:26:15] lamb through the book of Psalms all the
[2:26:19] way back to the time of David brother
[2:26:21] Anthony Psalms 22:16 and 18 for dogs
[2:26:24] have compassed me the Assembly of the
[2:26:27] wicked have enclosed me they pierce my
[2:26:31] hands and my
[2:26:32] feet so nobody say but all remember
[2:26:34] David talk about piercing hands and
[2:26:36] feet I may tell all my bones they look
[2:26:39] and stay upon me they part my garments
[2:26:42] among them Hallelujah and cast lots upon
[2:26:46] my vest
[2:26:52] can the church say
[2:26:56] amen and from the moment John the
[2:26:59] Baptist saw him what did John say Behold
[2:27:03] the Lamb of God which taketh away the
[2:27:06] sin of the world in the message he
[2:27:08] identified Masterpiece of God brother
[2:27:10] brandham said here he was wounded for
[2:27:13] our transgressions he was bruised for
[2:27:15] our iniquity he was a lamb the Lamb of
[2:27:18] God the perfect sacrifice there never
[2:27:21] been nobody lived like him never has
[2:27:23] been nobody since live like him he was
[2:27:26] the perfect Masterpiece matched God's
[2:27:28] word exactly God in the beginning give
[2:27:31] his word a portion of this part for that
[2:27:33] time for that part for that part there's
[2:27:36] where men are so deceived and confused
[2:27:38] today they're trying to build on
[2:27:40] something that happened 40 50 years ago
[2:27:43] that was give for that age what good
[2:27:45] would it had done Moses come with
[2:27:47] Enoch's message what good would it have
[2:27:49] done Moses to come with Noah's message
[2:27:51] what good would it come Jesus with Moses
[2:27:54] message see and what good would have
[2:27:56] done Wesley to come with Luther's
[2:27:57] message what good would it have done the
[2:27:59] Pentecost to come with Wesley message
[2:28:01] see what I mean it's all looted here in
[2:28:03] the Bible and we've got to know the age
[2:28:06] and the hour and what's for us and there
[2:28:08] is where we are failing today we are
[2:28:10] reading everything else but the
[2:28:12] Bible this is the day that we should be
[2:28:15] living this is the day that God has
[2:28:17] placed us here let's look in the word
[2:28:20] that's how they fail to see Jesus those
[2:28:22] Pharisees and Sadducees herodians the
[2:28:24] different organizations of the day had
[2:28:26] it fixed and so perfectly fixed there
[2:28:28] was no way of Escape they taught in
[2:28:30] other words they had it all figured out
[2:28:32] but when he come he was different from
[2:28:34] all of them through it he was little
[2:28:36] humble fellow born in a manger which
[2:28:39] supposed to be an illegitimate child and
[2:28:41] all these things but yet he come exactly
[2:28:43] the way the scripture said he would come
[2:28:45] and there was a accustomed to what Moses
[2:28:48] said and Moses spoke of him and he said
[2:28:50] well if you would have known Moses you
[2:28:52] would have known me so in other words he
[2:28:54] didn't really know Moses in other words
[2:28:57] you ready to know this Prophet
[2:28:59] message because if you know this Prophet
[2:29:01] message you would know what should be
[2:29:03] said and done in this time and this
[2:29:05] season can the church say Amen you have
[2:29:08] Moses books but you don't know what to
[2:29:09] do with it you reading Moses course but
[2:29:11] you don't know how to live it and if you
[2:29:14] know Moses you would have known me can
[2:29:15] the Church Say Amen
[2:29:18] Moses spake of me and still they could
[2:29:20] see it just so twisted up in their
[2:29:22] Traditions until they couldn't see it
[2:29:25] but you see he didn't come to reflect
[2:29:26] them organization of that day he didn't
[2:29:28] come to reflect sectarian religion he
[2:29:31] came to reflect the father and the
[2:29:33] father was the word but the said now I
[2:29:35] feel religious he come to reflect the
[2:29:37] father's word God said he would be there
[2:29:39] and there he was the perfect Masterpiece
[2:29:42] of God's Great handiwork Oh my he was
[2:29:45] the perfect reflection of him he
[2:29:47] reflected everything that God had spoke
[2:29:49] of he reflected what Adam said about him
[2:29:52] he reflected about all the prophets said
[2:29:55] all the Patriarchs said everything he
[2:29:57] said he was a fulfillment of the word
[2:29:59] all types was fulfilled in him yeah he
[2:30:02] became Jehovah of the Old Testament he
[2:30:05] was the Old Testament Jehovah the word
[2:30:07] then which was the pillar of fire was
[2:30:09] made manifest and dwelt Among Us Jehovah
[2:30:12] of the Old Testament became Jesus of the
[2:30:15] New Testament uh he was a perfect
[2:30:17] reflection of God oh if the church today
[2:30:20] could just reflect that first church
[2:30:22] when the Holy Ghost fell on the day of
[2:30:24] Pentecost if the Christian today would
[2:30:26] reflect can the church say
[2:30:30] Amen in the church ages the Ephesian
[2:30:32] Church age brother Clarence how we doing
[2:30:36] good all right God's intention for his
[2:30:39] creation man is to express his words
[2:30:41] Hallelujah so God's intention for you
[2:30:44] and I is to express his words so when
[2:30:46] you walk it's supposed to be an
[2:30:48] expression of his word when you go to
[2:30:50] work it's an expression of your his word
[2:30:52] when you come to church you are
[2:30:53] expressing his word and in Genesis Adam
[2:30:55] was given the word to live
[2:30:57] by a life lived by the word would be the
[2:31:01] word expressed can the church say Amen
[2:31:04] that is true is it not I'm reading the
[2:31:06] prophet's word but did Adam live by that
[2:31:08] word no because he was to live by every
[2:31:11] word and he failed to take heed to every
[2:31:14] word then there arose Moses what a great
[2:31:17] and mighty man he was yet he also failed
[2:31:20] to live by every word and that Prophet
[2:31:23] the type of the great prophet to come
[2:31:25] failed in Anger to obey the word and
[2:31:28] there was also David the great king of
[2:31:30] Israel a man after God's Own Heart he
[2:31:33] failed by adultery when he was tempted
[2:31:35] but eventually in the fullness of time
[2:31:38] there came one the head even Jesus who
[2:31:41] also must be tempted to see if he would
[2:31:45] live by every word that proceeded out of
[2:31:47] the mouth of God then was Satan foiled
[2:31:51] then was Satan finished for here was one
[2:31:54] who lived by it is written and the
[2:31:56] Masterpiece of God overcame by
[2:31:59] reflecting God's word then was that
[2:32:02] manifested perfect one given to the
[2:32:04] Cross as the perfect Lamb of God for the
[2:32:08] perfect sacrifice can the church
[2:32:11] sayen and on the tree he received the
[2:32:14] wounds unto death that we by him and
[2:32:18] because of him might eat of the tree of
[2:32:20] life oh can the church say Amen because
[2:32:24] he died we could eat from the Tree of
[2:32:26] Life aren't you happy this morning to
[2:32:29] know that because of him because he was
[2:32:31] wounded because he died we could eat of
[2:32:36] the tree of
[2:32:37] life and then that life freely given
[2:32:42] would enable us to overcome that life of
[2:32:45] the popwell not my life not my works not
[2:32:48] my ability but that life his life freely
[2:32:53] given would allow you and I to overcome
[2:32:56] the lust of the eyes the lust of the
[2:32:58] flesh the pride of life his life his
[2:33:02] holy life the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[2:33:06] [Music]
[2:33:11] itself listen to the words of this
[2:33:14] Vindicated Prophet would any able us to
[2:33:16] overcome and express the word of God so
[2:33:21] Hallelujah so you are already an
[2:33:23] expression of the word but through the
[2:33:25] life of God you will continue to express
[2:33:27] the very word oh every promise every
[2:33:31] word that was spoken all that was in the
[2:33:33] Old Testament Jehovah of the old became
[2:33:36] Jesus of the new and all of the
[2:33:38] prophecies that came then was to be
[2:33:40] wrapped up in an elect lady called The
[2:33:42] Bride of Jesus
[2:33:43] Christ and through his life we become a
[2:33:46] very expression of the
[2:33:49] word the prophet goes on and now to
[2:33:52] these sons of God who by him overcome
[2:33:56] and are given the privilege of the
[2:33:57] paradise of God and the constant
[2:34:00] Fellowship of Jesus
[2:34:02] Christ what a promise to be in constant
[2:34:05] fellowship with the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:34:08] there will never be any more separation
[2:34:10] from him whether he goes his bride will
[2:34:13] go what is his he shares with his
[2:34:16] beloved on a joint air relationship the
[2:34:19] secret things will be revealed the dark
[2:34:22] things will be made plain we shall know
[2:34:24] as we are known and we shall be like him
[2:34:28] this is the heritage of the Overcomer
[2:34:30] who has overcome by the blood of the
[2:34:32] lamb and the word of testimony to Jesus
[2:34:36] Christ he is talking about living
[2:34:38] sacrifices
[2:34:40] now how we long for that day I'm almost
[2:34:43] finished when the Crooked roads will all
[2:34:46] all be
[2:34:47] straightened woo
[2:34:49] Hallelujah when the Crooked RADS will
[2:34:51] all be
[2:34:55] straightened and we will be with him
[2:34:57] time Without End May that day hasten it
[2:34:59] to parents and may we hasten to obey his
[2:35:03] wordu and thereby prove hallelujah our
[2:35:06] worthiness to share his glory you
[2:35:08] appreciate the Lord this morning just a
[2:35:11] few minutes more the musician could
[2:35:12] begin to get
[2:35:15] ready
[2:35:16] so that perfect
[2:35:18] lamb was
[2:35:20] selected presented at the
[2:35:23] altar that lamb took our
[2:35:25] place that blood was made available to
[2:35:28] us so that we could have access to his
[2:35:32] divine presence access to his holy ghost
[2:35:35] access to a new life what was not
[2:35:38] transferable from those Lambs in the Old
[2:35:40] Testament that were killed and it
[2:35:41] couldn't be transferred the blood that
[2:35:43] was shed in the Old Testament with a pup
[2:35:45] well could only cover sins but this
[2:35:47] Blood by this man Christ Jesus wasn't
[2:35:50] coming to just cover sins it was coming
[2:35:52] to eradicate sin to destroy sin
[2:35:54] completely oh Hallelujah we didn't need
[2:35:57] to go from covering to covering and wait
[2:35:59] for another day of atonement and another
[2:36:01] evening sacrifice and another burnt
[2:36:03] offering but by one sacrifice he had
[2:36:06] perfected
[2:36:08] forever Glory
[2:36:10] [Applause]
[2:36:11] Hallelujah no longer covering your sin
[2:36:15] but washing your sin away destroying
[2:36:18] your sin but you drop you you you drop
[2:36:22] it into bleach it destroys it completely
[2:36:24] that's how this Blood operates you get
[2:36:27] dipped in the blood covered by his blood
[2:36:30] he sees you through the blood and he
[2:36:32] sees you as a Victorious son daughter of
[2:36:34] God can the church Give the Lord a hand
[2:36:36] of
[2:36:37] [Music]
[2:36:38] [Applause]
[2:36:42] Praise And every type of offering that
[2:36:46] was offered in the Old Testament Jesus
[2:36:49] fulfilled every kind of offering sin
[2:36:52] offering he became the offering for sin
[2:36:55] burnt offering he became the burnt
[2:36:57] offering the Passover Lamb brother
[2:36:59] Clarence which is started there in Egypt
[2:37:02] he was the Passover Lamb the atonement
[2:37:05] offering on the day of atonement he was
[2:37:07] the atonement offering the consecration
[2:37:09] offering uh he was the consecration
[2:37:11] offering uh the Thanksgiving offering
[2:37:14] Jesus was the Thanksgiving offering the
[2:37:16] meal offering the very bread of life
[2:37:19] offer thems oh come on now somebody help
[2:37:22] me preach the fellowship offering uh he
[2:37:25] was The Fellowship offering because by
[2:37:27] him we could be reconciled with perfect
[2:37:30] fellowship with
[2:37:31] [Applause]
[2:37:39] God hallelujah hallelujah in so much
[2:37:42] that by the time Jesus has left the
[2:37:44] scene
[2:37:47] you hear Paul speaking Purge out
[2:37:50] therefore the old 11av in First
[2:37:52] Corinthians that you may be a new lump
[2:37:55] as he and Le for even Christ Our
[2:37:56] Passover is sacrificed for us in other
[2:38:00] words Paul has to keep reminding them of
[2:38:01] who they are and and the old sacrifice
[2:38:04] not going to work no more and it's not
[2:38:06] necessary no more because this sacrifice
[2:38:08] already take place in Ephesians 2:52 and
[2:38:11] walk in love as Christ also had loved us
[2:38:14] and had given himself for us an offering
[2:38:16] and a sacrifice to God for a sweet
[2:38:18] smelling Savor so when your life is
[2:38:21] rotten and messed up that blood that was
[2:38:24] sacrificed for you and I offers a Savor
[2:38:27] that covers your
[2:38:29] filth that covers your wretchedness so
[2:38:32] it doesn't come up to God that way can
[2:38:34] the church say
[2:38:42] Amen Hebrews 10 10 by the which will we
[2:38:46] are Sanctified through the offering of
[2:38:48] the body of Jesus Christ once for all
[2:38:50] 10:12 but this man this man after he had
[2:38:53] offered one sacrifice for sins forever
[2:38:56] sat down on the right hand of God for by
[2:38:59] one offering he had perfected forever
[2:39:01] them that are Sanctified brother Brandon
[2:39:04] in the message the church and its
[2:39:06] condition a few years ago he said I'm
[2:39:08] going now in a few days to celebrate the
[2:39:10] falling of the Holy Ghost In America 50
[2:39:12] years ago this year at the old Aza
[2:39:14] Street meeting Pentecostal meeting in
[2:39:16] Los Angeles where they had their first
[2:39:18] falling of the Holy Spirit when the
[2:39:20] people got together listen to this when
[2:39:22] Christ come down among those people they
[2:39:25] were just as gentle just as peaceful and
[2:39:28] to just think this was the Pentecostal
[2:39:30] birth this was just the open door age
[2:39:32] with Kang this was just a
[2:39:33] foraste of the real holy ghost that was
[2:39:36] to come that was to follow the perfect
[2:39:38] word the fullness of the word restored
[2:39:41] as a conductor for the whole Holy Spirit
[2:39:43] to move through they had just a taste of
[2:39:45] it
[2:39:46] amen just some gifts their lives would
[2:39:49] not transformed with a pop well because
[2:39:51] the fullness of the word wasn't revealed
[2:39:52] to bring a full transformation but God
[2:39:54] was showing that this Spirit thing is
[2:39:56] still real and the promise of the Holy
[2:39:57] Ghost that fell in the day of Pentecost
[2:39:59] was just as real today as it was then
[2:40:02] and through an Open Door age those in
[2:40:04] that day fell the power and listen to

[2:43:57] it sometime ago when they had the last
[2:43:59] big thing in for the Queen of England or
[2:44:01] whatever and you watch how all the
[2:44:03] prince of Denmark and the princess of
[2:44:05] this place and the prince of this place
[2:44:07] not one person dress IM
[2:44:10] modestly all the royalty dressed with
[2:44:13] class and dignity you can't embarrass
[2:44:15] them their pocket so deep deep deep they
[2:44:18] could go past the ground they could buy
[2:44:19] what they want they could buy the best
[2:44:21] style and fashion but they choose to
[2:44:23] dress like a queen they choose it's
[2:44:25] their choice they're not being forced to
[2:44:27] do it they willingly dress a certain way
[2:44:30] because they understand that they are
[2:44:31] royalty but if you understand this

[2:44:49] king of England cuss out
[2:44:52] somebody Hallelujah it almost sounds
[2:44:55] impossible to hear because the concept
[2:44:57] the way it's portrayed they they are
[2:45:00] above
[2:45:02] that you never see was he it's Prince
[2:45:05] William is next in line after Charles
[2:45:07] right William you see you ever see

[2:45:31] palace in England to come and and dance
[2:45:34] on the street of Trinidad it sounds
[2:45:36] farfetched because she understands that
[2:45:38] she's next in line for the
[2:45:41] throne and because of this there are
[2:45:43] people around her who say when you you
[2:45:45] eat put the fork this way and and the
[2:45:47] knife this way because because of who
[2:45:49] you are you represent a
[2:45:52] kingdom and that's a natural Kingdom and
[2:45:54] this morning you represent a kingdom
[2:45:56] that cannot be moved that cannot be
[2:46:01] shaken and you want to be embarrassed to

[2:46:38] home
[2:46:39] friends all the imperfect sacrifices
[2:46:42] were brought together in that perfect
[2:46:44] sacrif rice and on Calvary that was the
[2:46:47] final atonement and the veil was Ren
[2:46:50] from top to bottom that separated the
[2:46:52] people the people from accessing what is
[2:46:55] behind the veil because God knew that
[2:46:58] there was a people coming who would not
[2:47:00] need no high priest on the earth that
[2:47:02] Christ will become the high priest of
[2:47:05] our

[2:49:27] will not want it disallowed indeed of
[2:49:30] men men will not allow it one day we
[2:49:32] will not be allowed to
[2:49:34] preach Hallelujah in schools today they
[2:49:37] have the same sex thing all in these
[2:49:39] school
[2:49:40] books to normalize Sodom and Gomorrah
[2:49:45] yes and if you tell them you want to
[2:49:47] pray or teach your Bible or teach
[2:49:48] something else they don't want it but
[2:49:51] bam said years ago America rejected
[2:49:54] God hallelujah but ye in verse 5 also as
[2:49:59] Lively
[2:50:00] Stones so here we have God animating
[2:50:03] what is not normally animated cuz a
[2:50:06] sacrifice is normally dead but he said
[2:50:07] Living Sacrifice and he said Lively
[2:50:10] Stone a stone ready to be alive and a
[2:50:13] sacrifice should be alive but you call
[2:50:15] Living Sacrifice and Lively
[2:50:17] Stone I built up a spiritual house and
[2:50:21] holy priesthood Hallelujah to do what to
[2:50:24] offer up spiritual
[2:50:26] sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus
[2:50:30] Christ young people you are called to
[2:50:32] offer spiritual sacrifice don't take
[2:50:35] your voice and use it to sing worldly
[2:50:37] songs sing songs unto the Lord don't
[2:50:40] take your voice to say the words is
[2:50:42] saying out there say the things that
[2:50:44] will be pleasing to God and make sure
[2:50:46] you are offering your spiritual
[2:50:48] sacrifice I'm done I'm just closing
[2:50:51] outall Hallelujah wherefore also it is
[2:50:53] contained in the scripture behold I lay
[2:50:55] in Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect
[2:50:58] precious and he that believeth on him
[2:51:01] shall not be confounded friends your
[2:51:03] belief on this gospel you will not be
[2:51:05] confused you will not be confounded you
[2:51:07] will not be you you you wouldn't be
[2:51:09] uncertain of where you
[2:51:11] stand unto you therefore which believe
[2:51:14] he is precious is he precious to you
[2:51:16] this
[2:51:17] morning oh Lord you are so precious to
[2:51:20] me unto you that believe he is precious
[2:51:23] but unto them which be
[2:51:26] disobedient the stone which the builders
[2:51:30] disallowed the same is made head of the
[2:51:32] corner in other words every knee will
[2:51:34] bow every tongue will confess that Jesus
[2:51:38] is
[2:51:40] Lord friends the world could reject him
[2:51:43] because they are for ordained to reject
[2:51:45] him but you rejecting him is a whole
[2:51:47] different story friends he goes into
[2:51:50] verse 8 and a stone of stumbling and a
[2:51:52] rock of offense in other words plenty
[2:51:54] people come to church and they say well
[2:51:56] boy Isaac just just just say things to
[2:51:58] get upset I really have to stop that and
[2:52:01] is a stumbling it's an offense you feel
[2:52:04] offended yes it's an offense you
[2:52:07] shouldn't have no minis skirt in your
[2:52:08] closet burn
[2:52:09] it if that offend you this is the
[2:52:12] scripture that gives me the covering but
[2:52:14] the parents and a stone of stumbling and
[2:52:16] a rock of
[2:52:17] offense the worldly music that doesn't
[2:52:19] belong to you burn it God will make you
[2:52:21] break your
[2:52:23] phone so you can't listen to it
[2:52:29] thank you find that kind of rough but
[2:52:32] say he could break your foot and put in
[2:52:34] a wheelchair he say love Spirit
[2:52:36] conditions will don't wait till the
[2:52:38] conditions have to force you to come
[2:52:40] back to the house of
[2:52:41] [Music]
[2:52:43] God
[2:52:46] if love don't get you to turn your heart
[2:52:48] around God will send
[2:52:50] conditions that's why so many people
[2:52:52] find God in the hospital and they find
[2:52:54] God on their dead bed and they find God
[2:52:56] in these places because it takes the
[2:52:58] corrective love of God to drive them
[2:53:01] back to say My Father who art in heaven
[2:53:04] Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom
[2:53:08] come
[2:53:10] hallu thank you Lord thank you friends
[2:53:13] don't wait till back against a
[2:53:15] wall and the doctors say they don't know
[2:53:18] what to do for you to acknowledge that
[2:53:19] he is your Redeemer he is your savior
[2:53:22] and he paid the price that you could
[2:53:24] have life and have it more abundantly
[2:53:26] and have an opportunity to walk without
[2:53:28] sin and have Divine access to the
[2:53:30] Rapture the Resurrection the new city
[2:53:32] the wedding
[2:53:36] supper and a stone of stumbling and a
[2:53:39] rock of offense even to them which
[2:53:41] stumble at the word that people this
[2:53:43] morning oh gosh just just preach my
[2:53:45] happy friends the word is to bring you
[2:53:47] with joy but it is corrective for you to
[2:53:49] line up and see when you look in the
[2:53:50] mirror you see Jesus looking back at
[2:53:53] you I want to be made whole I want to be
[2:53:57] a Living Sacrifice I Want My Sacrifice
[2:53:59] to be accepted I don't want God to say I
[2:54:01] don't want that sacrifice I don't want
[2:54:03] God to say I have no respect for brother
[2:54:05] Isaac
[2:54:07] sacrifice I want to make sure I bring a
[2:54:09] sacrifice that is accepted acceptable
[2:54:11] unto the Lord after all these years for
[2:54:13] God to say depart from me you workers of
[2:54:15] iniquity I never knew
[2:54:18] you that's what the Bible says you know
[2:54:20] many will come in there say Lord Lord
[2:54:22] I've done all of this for you and God
[2:54:24] say depart from me in other words I
[2:54:26] don't accept your
[2:54:28] [Music]
[2:54:29] offering it doesn't qualify because you
[2:54:32] mix it with your own thing so much it
[2:54:34] didn't make the sweet enough of a
[2:54:36] fragrance for
[2:54:38] me
[2:54:43] hallu and Stone of stumbling and a
[2:54:45] rocket offense even to them which
[2:54:46] stumble at the word being disobedient
[2:54:48] where unto also they were appointed in
[2:54:50] other words just like dayon and Kora
[2:54:52] they are those who are appointed unto
[2:54:55] Disobedience they will never see this
[2:54:57] gospel they will never receive this
[2:54:58] message you can bring it the church all
[2:55:00] the time but they are predestinated to
[2:55:03] destruction and that's why you should be
[2:55:05] so happy that you are predestinated unto
[2:55:10] adoption you are predestinated to the
[2:55:13] Holy Ghost you are predestinated to make
[2:55:20] it and then Paul says but ye are Peter
[2:55:26] rather says but ye are chosen
[2:55:28] generation Hallelujah chosen above every
[2:55:31] other people chosen above other families
