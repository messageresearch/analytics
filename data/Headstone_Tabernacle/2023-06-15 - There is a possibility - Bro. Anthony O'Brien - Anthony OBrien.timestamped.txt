[35:23] were there
[35:24] they were upon the roof about 3 000 men
[35:28] and women that beheld while Samson made

[35:41] me I pray thee only this once
[35:45] oh God
[35:47] that I may be once Avenged of the
[35:49] Philistines for my two eyes
[35:52] and Samson took hold of the middle
[35:54] pillars upon which the house stood
[35:57] and on which it was born up
[36:00] of the one with his right hand and of
[36:03] the other with his left
[36:05] and Samson said let me die with the
[36:08] Philistines
[36:09] and he bowed himself with all his might
[36:12] and the house fell upon the Lords and
[36:16] upon all the people that were therein so
[36:19] the dead which he slew at his death were
[36:22] more than they which he slew in his life

[39:46] the fall we would not have been in this
[39:49] kind of uh
[39:51] testing ground or in this kind of you
[39:54] know adverse condition
[39:57] um that the world is in
[39:58] but God has set it up
[40:00] that we have to make a choice
[40:03] you know and that's just the way it is
[40:07] God has presented his word to us
[40:09] his truth to us and the devil has
[40:12] presented his lie and so it's up to us
[40:15] to make a choice
[40:17] whether we're going to choose God's
[40:19] truth or we're going to choose the
[40:21] devil's lie Adam when he fell by sin he
[40:25] had to first let go of the word in order
[40:27] to receive the devil's lie and that's
[40:30] that's the way it is and in order for
[40:32] you to overcome you have to let go of
[40:35] the devil's lie and grab a hold of God's
[40:38] truth pray but you're either holding on
[40:40] to one or the other
[40:42] isn't that right and you have to make a
[40:45] choice every day to choose to follow
[40:48] Jesus to choose to fight for the truth
[40:51] to choose to contend for the Fate that
[40:55] was once delivered to the Saints
[40:58] every day we make that choice
[41:02] and every day we are faced with
[41:05] adversity
[41:07] we are faced with trials we are faced
[41:10] with Temptations we are faced with
[41:13] thorns and thistles he isn't that right
[41:16] The Garden of Edo is a beautiful place
[41:19] but then there come a point where God
[41:20] said that because man had sinned and was
[41:23] driven out of the Garden of Eden thorns
[41:26] and thistles shall the ground grow unto
[41:28] thee pain and torment and sorrow and and
[41:32] heartache can burden was introduced to
[41:36] the world that didn't know this
[41:38] heartache and didn't know about all this
[41:40] burden and and pain but but God has it
[41:44] set up that way because it is in this
[41:47] condition of adversity that we find that
[41:51] we find opportunity in this condition
[41:54] called adversity in a condition of
[41:58] Misfortune and I always find it so
[42:01] almost paradoxical that it is in these
[42:04] types of conditions that God finds his
[42:07] opportunities to speak to us in our
[42:10] lives if things were a Bed of Roses you
[42:13] wouldn't understand the fullness of
[42:15] God's love and grace and mercy because
[42:19] you would have it easy you wouldn't have
[42:22] anything to fight for you wouldn't have
[42:24] anything to struggle for you wouldn't
[42:26] have anything to battle for and to grind
[42:30] for and to hope for how could you miss
[42:33] something that isn't gone so then
[42:35] therefore man had to Fall by sin all
[42:39] they got to come into a condition where
[42:41] they begin to miss something and every
[42:44] man that's walking around the earth
[42:46] tonight that doesn't have the Holy Ghost
[42:48] that doesn't have Jesus in his life that
[42:52] doesn't have the reality of God in his
[42:54] life is missing something tonight and he
[42:58] will spend his entire life looking for
[43:01] it searching for the thing that
[43:03] satisfies the longing Soul the thing
[43:06] that satisfies the longing Hearts he
[43:10] looks for it in education he looks for
[43:13] it in science he looks for it in
[43:15] technology he looks for it in
[43:18] Civilization he looks for it in Creature
[43:21] Comforts but he can find no place to
[43:24] rest his head because the only place
[43:27] that you can find rests tonight is in
[43:31] Jesus Christ or while he is the only
[43:34] thing he is the only one who can give
[43:38] you rest in your soul rest in your
[43:41] spirits he said come unto me all who are
[43:45] heavily Laden and I'll give you rest
[43:48] tonight oh hallelujah hallelujah people
[43:52] leave it do you understand that there
[43:55] are lots of people tonight walking
[43:57] around the world without resting their
[44:00] Spirits they're Restless oh Holland they
[44:03] look into things to fulfill their
[44:05] satisfaction they're looking for things
[44:08] to satisfy the longing in their soul and
[44:12] the devil can find a million things for
[44:14] you to occupy your time which and for
[44:17] you to occupy your spirit with and for
[44:20] you to occupy your soul which but I
[44:23] thank God when his hand reached down and
[44:27] showed me something else showed me a
[44:30] vision that was bigger than me it was
[44:33] bigger than you it's a world that is far
[44:36] greater far more real than the one you
[44:40] are sitting in right now in this world
[44:42] has no pain in this world has no sorrow
[44:45] and this world has no torments oh
[44:49] Hallelujah and that's the world that we
[44:50] come from and that's the world we are
[44:53] going back to tonight oh somebody say
[44:57] Amen
[44:59] oh Hallelujah
[45:01] Hallelujah
[45:03] so since the fall of Adam this world has
[45:06] been set up
[45:07] in a way that is meant to truly test the
[45:12] strength of one's character
[45:14] because there's every kind of spirit
[45:18] every kind of adversity every kind of
[45:22] Twisted logic every type of hybrid
[45:27] religion that is designed to influence
[45:31] your mind is designed to invade your
[45:35] emotions it is designed to interfere
[45:39] with your spirits so that to begin to
[45:42] think things and try to use your
[45:44] conscience to navigate this world around
[45:47] you some people try to use reasoning
[45:49] Powers some people try to use their
[45:52] affection some people try to use their
[45:54] emotion but these are misleading because
[45:58] they are come from the world oh and we
[46:01] are not of the world we are in the world
[46:04] tonight but we are not of this world
[46:06] because there's something inside of your
[46:09] soul that God put inside of your heart
[46:12] from since before the foundation of the
[46:15] world and it is because of this
[46:17] something it is because of this sea that
[46:19] is inside of you that is the only reason
[46:24] that you can have faith tonight
[46:26] in the word of God
[46:29] because God put it there excuse me
[46:32] and that is what gets a victory
[46:34] every time now character is not a gift
[46:38] it's a victory isn't that right
[46:40] it's a victory that is one
[46:43] true trial and Circumstance
[46:47] true painful experiences
[46:50] I don't want you to cringe tonight
[46:52] because
[46:54] this is the word
[46:58] you know it
[46:59] human beings we don't like discomfort
[47:03] we don't like discomfort
[47:05] and that's reasonably so because
[47:08] we come from a world that didn't have
[47:11] all this discomfort
[47:12] we long for
[47:14] for Comfort we do
[47:16] we want to be comforted
[47:19] we we will born into a condition that
[47:22] was comfortable this when we talk about
[47:24] Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden and
[47:26] so on
[47:27] with a comfortable setup
[47:30] everything was fine
[47:32] every need was provided for
[47:35] everything man ever wanted was already
[47:38] there
[47:39] God said the seed is in itself in the
[47:42] earth to produce every herb and every
[47:45] tree to feed any animal to feed every
[47:48] person to feed everyone that would ever
[47:50] come upon the Earth God had the
[47:53] potential in the earth already
[47:56] for every herb to to bring healing to to
[48:00] to isn't that right isn't that right
[48:01] animals know what grass to eat in order
[48:04] to get healed from certain ailments and
[48:07] diseases God God have everything set up
[48:10] praise God from long long time
[48:13] is this we're hitting wisdom that's
[48:16] built into everything that you see
[48:18] around you nature takes care of itself
[48:21] isn't that right I heard someone say one
[48:24] time he said notice how nature is never
[48:26] in a hurry
[48:27] but it accomplishes everything in time
[48:30] the trees bring forth in their season
[48:33] and then their buds and the flowers
[48:35] bloom in their time and in their season
[48:37] and when the time for the flowers to
[48:39] disappear it changes to another season
[48:42] and God is in charge of all these
[48:45] seasons and these times and these
[48:47] dispensation in our lives he's the one
[48:50] who put it so from the beginning and he
[48:53] knows what season you are going through
[48:55] sometimes you go through a dry spell
[48:58] sometimes you feel like you pray and
[49:01] nobody's hearing you sometimes you feel
[49:03] like your prayer and your prayers
[49:05] hitting a wall but that is only God
[49:08] testing you to see if you will continue
[49:11] with this Christianity thing or if
[49:14] you're going to fall up or if you're
[49:15] gonna give up or if you're gonna throw
[49:17] in a towel or if you're gonna say though
[49:20] he slay me yet will I trust him even
[49:23] though I can't see him with my eyes
[49:25] something in my heart tells me he's real
[49:29] and I don't care what nobody tells me I
[49:33] don't care what the reasoning of man I
[49:35] don't care what wisdom of this world
[49:37] they can never persuade me a difference
[49:40] from what I already know in my heart to
[49:44] be the truth this gospel must be
[49:47] preached and then the end shall come
[49:49] don't tell me about any other gospel I
[49:52] want to know about the gospel that Jesus
[49:54] preached I want to know about the gospel
[49:57] that brother Branham was sent to restore
[50:00] resource back to this page that was once
[50:03] delivered to the Saints oh hallelujah
[50:07] hallelujah he sent a prophet to bring
[50:10] you back the signs and wonders bring you
[50:13] back to Miracles bring you back to
[50:15] Healing bring you back to Deliverance
[50:17] bring you back to the baptism of the
[50:20] Holy Ghost and Fire bring you back to
[50:23] the absolutes bring you back to the
[50:25] typos oh what's supposed to be
[50:27] controlling and leading the church today
[50:30] is not the wisdom of man but it is the
[50:34] power of the Holy Ghost it's supposed to
[50:37] lead the church and that's what we're
[50:39] being driven back to
[50:41] oh somebody say Amen
[50:44] oh Hallelujah the prophet lamented he
[50:48] said of the Holy Ghost
[50:50] and if a man being changed and being
[50:52] born again
[50:54] scarcely anything is being said
[50:57] about it
[50:58] and that's almost a condition we come
[51:00] into today
[51:02] where the groups and the different ones
[51:05] are falling away from what's supposed to
[51:07] be the truth
[51:08] not upholding it
[51:10] isn't that right almost a great falling
[51:13] away as it were from the original gospel
[51:17] but it seems just about that hour
[51:19] when it seems most adverse when the
[51:22] condition seems most dread there is a
[51:25] possibility
[51:26] there is a possibility tonight that God
[51:30] could do Miracles he never stopped doing
[51:32] Miracles he's a miracle working God God
[51:36] waits for adverse times adverse
[51:39] conditions when it seems like man give
[51:41] up on God when it seemed like they want
[51:44] nothing about God when it seemed like
[51:46] nobody wants to do the right thing
[51:49] that's the opportunity that God loves to
[51:52] have because when the night is darkest
[51:55] that's when the morning stars shine the
[51:59] brightest and those morning stars are
[52:02] predestinated to reflect the oncoming
[52:05] Sun oh and that sun is Jesus Christ the
[52:09] same yesterday the same today the same
[52:12] forever and God is going to have a
[52:15] church tonight that's going to reflect
[52:16] the glory of this oncoming sun with
[52:20] signs with wonders with Miracles with
[52:24] Revival with prayer meetings when people
[52:27] calling out on God when people are being
[52:30] filled with the Holy Ghost we will be
[52:34] uncircumcised cut off the Flesh in the
[52:37] heart and the Holy Ghost is getting
[52:40] ready to drop in
[52:42] right in on you
[52:44] right in this adverse condition
[52:47] oh Hallelujah
[52:53] still trying to build here amen
[52:55] my
[52:58] so God had to have a situation that
[52:59] presented itself
[53:01] almost as adverse
[53:03] or Miss Unfortunate or almost seem like
[53:05] you know
[53:07] completely opposite to the truth
[53:10] and it's right in that situation
[53:13] it's actually a time for God it is a
[53:16] time of opportunity
[53:19] that's amazing
[53:21] you know they say you never miss the
[53:23] well water you never miss the water
[53:26] until the well-run dry
[53:30] sometimes God let the situation go on
[53:33] until it come almost hopeless
[53:36] until it come almost crazy
[53:39] isn't that right
[53:41] and then he does something different
[53:44] then he does something new his nerd
[53:48] Hallelujah and he does something watch
[53:51] that you cannot do for yourself
[53:54] you bring it to a point where
[53:56] it's almost unredeemable
[53:58] you know or irreparable can it be
[54:00] repaired seemingly
[54:03] and then he comes in remarkably
[54:05] miraculously
[54:07] he repaints the thing that was broken he
[54:10] he Bridges the Gap that was reached he
[54:14] he makes a way where there seemed to be
[54:17] no way 400 years without a prophet but
[54:20] all of a sudden here come a Virgin Mary
[54:24] walking down the road and this was the
[54:27] Fulfillment of Isaiah's word that said a
[54:30] virgin shall conceive and bring forth a
[54:33] son his name would be Emmanuel and
[54:35] Prince of Peace and so forth but yes
[54:37] they just lay without an open vision for
[54:40] years just in Traditions of men in the
[54:43] sect of the Pharisees and the Sadducees
[54:46] and men with tall hats and acting out
[54:49] their religion praise God but inside
[54:51] them was like ten men's bones But Here
[54:54] Comes somebody on the earth light struck
[54:57] the urge all of a sudden for years it
[55:00] was dead in the message yes it was dead
[55:03] in Israel but then all of a sudden God
[55:06] began to something different God saw an
[55:09] opportunity to bring his lights in a
[55:13] fallen world and I so thank God tonight
[55:15] that in my adverse condition in my
[55:19] Brokenness in the shadows of My reality
[55:22] God brought his lights into my heart
[55:26] that's the only reason that I made it
[55:29] here tonight is because God saw an
[55:32] opportunity in my adversity that he
[55:36] brought his love to me he revealed his
[55:39] word to me he showed me that I am his
[55:43] own oh what have got devil tonight can
[55:46] stop you can separate us from the love
[55:50] of God that is in Christ Jesus there is
[55:53] no sickness there's no disease there's
[55:56] no power and hurts that can separate you
[55:59] the night from the love of God God saw
[56:02] an opportunity to save someone that was
[56:05] lost
[56:08] oh Hallelujah that was me tonight
[56:12] I was you
[56:16] that was me
[56:18] that was you
[56:20] isn't that right
[56:22] one time a preacher
[56:24] had a bird cage he brought it to the
[56:26] Social Service
[56:27] and he rested it down
[56:29] on the pulpit
[56:31] and he said
[56:32] I just got this bird cage from a young
[56:34] man
[56:35] a real Wicked young man
[56:37] caught a bunch of birds
[56:41] he said he told a young man what are you
[56:42] gonna do with those birds
[56:44] young man said I'm gonna take a long
[56:45] meal
[56:46] and I poke them stick them until they
[56:49] die
[56:49] and they ended in a cage
[56:52] and the preacher said how much for the
[56:53] birds
[56:54] and the young man said they're not for
[56:56] sale this is my thing to play with he
[56:58] said how much you want
[57:00] for the birds
[57:02] young man said give me a hundred dollars
[57:04] and I'll give any words
[57:07] give it to him he gladly took the money
[57:10] and ran away and left the creature with
[57:12] the cage preacher took the cage out to a
[57:14] field somewhere
[57:15] he let the birds go
[57:17] and they went free and he said I was a
[57:20] bird in that cage once because the devil
[57:23] had me and he didn't want to let me go
[57:26] but Jesus came by one day and he said
[57:30] how much for the bird you let them go
[57:34] and the Bible says like a bird out of
[57:36] the snare of the Fowler we are escaped
[57:39] oh Hallelujah out of the hand of the
[57:41] wicked one you are escaped oh hallelujah
[57:45] hallelujah he overcame so that you could
[57:48] overcome tonight oh Hallelujah I was one
[57:51] of them Birds I was caught in sin in a
[57:55] valley of church but tonight I am
[57:58] delivered because he came and paid a
[58:01] price that I could never pair he came
[58:04] and gave the devil his answer oh
[58:07] Hallelujah and when hope running and he
[58:09] didn't know that he let go The Greatest
[58:11] Prize that this world has ever seen
[58:14] Jesus died for you to come to Perfection
[58:18] to bring on this Resurrection oh
[58:21] Hallelujah he knew what it costs but he
[58:24] was willing to pay that price
[58:26] and to let you free
[58:28] so that you could be all that you were
[58:30] meant to be
[58:31] in God amen amen that's who we are
[58:34] tonight oh Hallelujah we in the devil's
[58:37] clutches but Jesus set us free we were
[58:40] in the prison house but God came and
[58:42] broke our chains we were all messed up
[58:45] in our minds we thought we was going all
[58:48] right we thought we were okay but we
[58:51] didn't know how messed up how naked how
[58:53] poor how blind and how miserable we was
[58:56] but then God came like the prophet said
[58:59] then Jesus came then Jesus came walking
[59:03] by and when Jesus comes something always
[59:07] takes place when Jesus passes by the
[59:10] Sick cannot stay sick when Jesus comes
[59:13] around the spirit cannot stay dead the
[59:16] cannot say because it's
[59:19] Jesus that we're talking about in him
[59:22] his life and his life is the light of
[59:24] man and we walk in that light tonight
[59:27] Jesus the light of the world he's here
[59:30] to fill you tonight he's there to feel
[59:32] you tonight he's here to live with you
[59:34] tonight he's here to open the prison bus
[59:37] and to set you free if you would only
[59:40] open up your Gates tonight lift up your
[59:43] hands worship him give him praise give
[59:47] him honor give him glory lift up your
[59:50] Gates tonight say open up he Gates and
[59:54] let the king of glory come into your
[59:56] heart and life oh pull him closer to you
[1:00:00] say Lord I need you in my heart I need
[1:00:04] you in my life I need you in my walk I
[1:00:09] need you
[1:00:10] because I have facing adversity
[1:00:15] and I can't do it
[1:00:17] on my own
[1:00:23] her present sufferings
[1:00:25] is an opportunity
[1:00:26] for God to do something in all lives
[1:00:30] that brings him the glory
[1:00:33] it's not right it's in the beginning
[1:00:34] when God created a will and everything
[1:00:36] in it that initial setting was perfect
[1:00:39] ly as God wanted it
[1:00:41] and it was peaceful like that for a
[1:00:43] season
[1:00:44] there's pizza for like like that for a
[1:00:46] Time
[1:00:47] but then sin come into the picture
[1:00:49] God allowed that
[1:00:51] to bring this this confusion
[1:00:55] so that he could unconfuse it praise God
[1:00:57] Amen with himself with his word with his
[1:01:01] presence and show the difference between
[1:01:03] right and wrong amen isn't that right
[1:01:06] because in that condition it was no
[1:01:08] wrong until sin came in the picture
[1:01:10] then there was a need for righteousness
[1:01:12] then there was a need for Holiness then
[1:01:16] there was a need for a sacrifice because
[1:01:19] man had sinned and his life was required
[1:01:22] but another life took his place another
[1:01:25] life became a substitute for him praise
[1:01:28] God and that's how we are here tonight
[1:01:29] we're not here by some flops we're not
[1:01:32] here by some chance we're not here by
[1:01:34] some mistake or by some accident we are
[1:01:36] here because God loved us and God paid a
[1:01:39] price for us to be here tonight he made
[1:01:43] a way for us he broke the dark hands of
[1:01:46] the enemy and brought you out of the
[1:01:48] Maori clay and put your foot on a rock
[1:01:51] oh hello you ought to come into the
[1:01:53] house of God every day and give God
[1:01:55] prays as long as you are Breton your
[1:01:58] lungs that's not my breaths that is the
[1:02:01] breath he gave in my lunch for me to
[1:02:04] praise my God and I will praise him
[1:02:07] while I have my being I will shout for
[1:02:10] the praises
[1:02:12] of his glory
[1:02:15] tell the world
[1:02:18] how much he means to me
[1:02:20] amen
[1:02:22] do you believe it's in it
[1:02:24] Hallelujah
[1:02:25] so the animal kingdom went here wire
[1:02:28] all creation went into confusion
[1:02:31] because a man that God had set in the
[1:02:33] garden
[1:02:34] has fallen out of position isn't that
[1:02:36] right
[1:02:36] and it seemed like an unfortunate event
[1:02:40] to the natural eye
[1:02:42] isn't that right
[1:02:43] but it seemed like a sad day
[1:02:46] but when God looked down
[1:02:48] he saw an opportunity
[1:02:50] for him now to himself to be a redeemer
[1:02:53] because he wasn't a redeemer before that
[1:02:55] time but now he had an opportunity to be
[1:02:58] a redeemer he had an opportunity to be a
[1:03:01] Healer he had an opportunity to be a
[1:03:04] leader to be a father to be a guide to
[1:03:08] be El Shaddai the breasted one to nurse
[1:03:12] his children back to health
[1:03:14] to nurse them back to strength because
[1:03:17] they had fallen from off the line and he
[1:03:20] alone had what was needed to redeem them
[1:03:23] back to himself he alone had the answer
[1:03:26] he was caught in his finest moment
[1:03:30] his opportunity to show himself
[1:03:33] to be strong
[1:03:34] to be a loving father
[1:03:37] you wouldn't know what love was and
[1:03:39] unless you experienced hate
[1:03:42] wouldn't know what Joy was
[1:03:44] unless you had experienced pain
[1:03:47] there are some songs that the Angels
[1:03:48] cannot sing
[1:03:50] because they don't know what it is to
[1:03:53] come through the buck and the Maya of
[1:03:55] this world they don't know what it is to
[1:03:58] be hated of man to be despised and to be
[1:04:02] cast aside to be misused and to be
[1:04:05] mistreated to be abused even though
[1:04:09] you're right even though you have the
[1:04:11] rights you still take wrong instead for
[1:04:14] the sake of peace they don't know what
[1:04:16] it's like to go to the Tempest of life
[1:04:18] to be pulled this way and that's or they
[1:04:22] don't know what it's like but you know
[1:04:24] what it is you know
[1:04:28] Grace
[1:04:31] that saved the Wretch like Me I wasn't
[1:04:34] always good I once was lost but I know
[1:04:38] someone that was greater than me here oh
[1:04:41] Hallelujah
[1:04:43] by my griefs
[1:04:46] and he broke my chains and set me free
[1:04:48] he's not right oh Hallelujah
[1:04:51] you saw an opportunity
[1:04:54] to do something he hadn't done before
[1:04:56] isn't that right
[1:04:58] praise God so God is the god of
[1:04:59] possibilities
[1:05:01] he makes a way where there seems to be
[1:05:04] no way
[1:05:06] that's what he is tonight isn't that
[1:05:07] right he is away making God
[1:05:11] it's not right so he presents himself as
[1:05:13] the answer
[1:05:14] to the question as the resolve Amen to
[1:05:18] this conflict amen that is happening
[1:05:21] around you isn't that right he presents
[1:05:23] himself as the answer
[1:05:25] Jesus is the answer for the world today
[1:05:28] do you believe it
[1:05:29] there's a possibility so when doubt sees
[1:05:31] impossibility
[1:05:32] Faith sees
[1:05:34] opportunity
[1:05:35] oh hallelujah hallelujah praise God Amen
[1:05:40] Hallelujah isn't that right
[1:05:43] I think about the woman in the issue of
[1:05:44] blood how that she had spent all her
[1:05:47] money at the doctors she had spent all
[1:05:50] that she had trying to find a solution
[1:05:53] to her blood issue problem but nothing
[1:05:56] she did in her natural self could get
[1:05:59] her an answer she needed she still had a
[1:06:02] blood issue she spent all her money and
[1:06:05] she still had a blood issue she tried to
[1:06:07] find advice she tried to find answers
[1:06:10] she went on the internet but she still
[1:06:13] had a blood issue she still had an
[1:06:15] unresolved issue oh Hallelujah you may
[1:06:19] search tonight you may run here and
[1:06:21] there but there's still unresolved
[1:06:23] issues tonight and I pray that you
[1:06:27] finally answer in Jesus to match because
[1:06:30] that woman heard of Jesus was passing by
[1:06:33] and that woman in adversity in her
[1:06:38] situation she thought she had an
[1:06:40] opportunity faith in a soul saw an
[1:06:44] opportunity in the midst of a Darkest
[1:06:46] Hour in the midst of a trial in the
[1:06:49] midst of a circumstance and tonight that
[1:06:52] is what you have to do in the midst of
[1:06:54] your adversity in the midst of whatever
[1:06:56] you are facing in your family on your
[1:07:00] job in your home in your life oh God is
[1:07:05] presenting an opportunity to nudge for
[1:07:07] you to meet Jesus for you to meet the
[1:07:10] Savior for you to meet the answer for
[1:07:13] you to get into contact with the Holy
[1:07:16] Ghost with the baptism of fire for you
[1:07:19] to get in contact with the supernatural
[1:07:21] the thing that changes a man
[1:07:24] truly from the inside
[1:07:27] oh hallelujah it's an opportunity
[1:07:30] amen for God to do something
[1:07:33] this woman saw an opportunity she said
[1:07:35] if I could just Touch the Hem of His
[1:07:37] Garment
[1:07:38] I know that something will happen I know
[1:07:41] that I will be made whole
[1:07:43] and guess what when she came down there
[1:07:47] it wasn't
[1:07:48] three people in the land
[1:07:50] and she was number four no no no no

[1:08:02] some come to touch him for Fortune some
[1:08:05] come to touch him just to be seen some
[1:08:08] came to touch just to be heard but this
[1:08:10] woman had an unresolved blood issue that
[1:08:14] she needed solving and the only one that
[1:08:17] could solve it was a man in that press
[1:08:19] oh and she pressed away she pressed her
[1:08:22] way she pressed past this one she
[1:08:24] pressed past that one she crawled
[1:08:26] through the legs she got down she got
[1:08:30] dirty but she had to meet Jesus she made
[1:08:33] me crying a little she maybe got
[1:08:35] frustrated but she knew what she was
[1:08:37] after she needed a healing and tonight

[1:10:00] praise God that if we press we could
[1:10:03] touch him we could be healed as soon as
[1:10:06] he touched
[1:10:07] that was different
[1:10:09] something Supernatural happened
[1:10:12] when she touched Jesus because everybody
[1:10:14] was touching him
[1:10:16] when she touched him
[1:10:18] he was going along the way all of a
[1:10:21] sudden something stopped him in his
[1:10:23] tracks and he turned around and say who

[1:10:30] touching the Lord everybody are wrong

[1:11:15] in adversity
[1:11:17] that's where the opportunity is
[1:11:19] the woman with the alabaster box
[1:11:21] when she saw Jesus being entertained at
[1:11:24] that party
[1:11:26] she was in a mess
[1:11:27] she herself wasn't didn't have a
[1:11:30] wonderful life going on but as the
[1:11:32] prophet dramatized he said that woman
[1:11:35] saw Jesus being entertained at the party
[1:11:37] and saw that he had a need she saw that
[1:11:41] he was in a messy situation and a lot
[1:11:44] bled for him because she saw him being
[1:11:46] entertained there but he had dirty feet
[1:11:49] and there was no one to wash his feet he
[1:11:52] came into the party and nobody tended to
[1:11:55] him nobody sought after him nobody
[1:11:58] helped him nobody catered to his need
[1:12:02] Jesus always comes where he's invited
[1:12:05] but you've got to entertain him you've
[1:12:07] got to welcome him into your heart into
[1:12:10] your life and here Jesus was in the
[1:12:13] corner put away who had an uncatered for
[1:12:17] and that woman's heart bled out for him
[1:12:19] Prophet dramatized she went home and got
[1:12:22] the most surprised possession she had it
[1:12:25] wasn't a car tire it wasn't a plate or a
[1:12:28] dish Hallelujah wasn't something she
[1:12:30] didn't want it was something that was of
[1:12:32] Great Value it was something of great
[1:12:34] sacrifice to her personally she took the
[1:12:37] most expensive thing she had and brought
[1:12:40] it to Jesus and she broke open that box
[1:12:43] oh Hallelujah she was keeping that for a
[1:12:47] special occasion and here it was her
[1:12:50] opportunity in the midst of this adverse
[1:12:53] condition in the midst of this horrible
[1:12:55] stage she saw herself doing an act of
[1:12:59] service
[1:13:00] foreign
[1:13:07] something for Jesus
[1:13:09] what are you gonna do
[1:13:11] what are you going to do for Jesus

[1:13:17] somewhere over their lives
[1:13:19] in some people's houses
[1:13:21] he is on capable
[1:13:24] in some people's homes and lives and
[1:13:26] hearts he's just sitting there waiting
[1:13:29] to be spoken to
[1:13:31] we didn't have a conversation
[1:13:33] a relationship with you
[1:13:35] and he's uncatered for

[1:14:00] the wise man sitting at a party said he
[1:14:02] looking at Jesus and
[1:14:04] they felt pretty smug
[1:14:06] because in that moment they felt like
[1:14:08] they knew more than the master
[1:14:10] and they said they they said they told
[1:14:12] themselves he don't even know
[1:14:14] who that woman is
[1:14:16] if you know who that woman is he
[1:14:18] wouldn't let her wash his feet but
[1:14:21] praise God he broke his silence
[1:14:23] after all was said undone
[1:14:26] he come to
[1:14:27] boss it on them

[1:15:28] so now he said when when she heard him
[1:15:30] all right he was talking about a Lazarus
[1:15:33] the devil Lazarus
[1:15:34] he said no when she heard him she was
[1:15:36] all right when she when he said I am the
[1:15:38] resurrection and the life I am he said
[1:15:40] oh what an assurance of the promise
[1:15:43] would for he was that I am that was in
[1:15:46] the wilderness with Moses back there in
[1:15:48] the burning bush he said even when all
[1:15:51] hopes was gone yet she was satisfied
[1:15:54] that if she could only get him to ask
[1:15:56] that it would take place he said now how
[1:15:59] we need a fate like that today
[1:16:01] he said no she had to believe for The
[1:16:04] Impossibles to the modern mind to the
[1:16:07] modern way of thinking she had to
[1:16:08] believe something that was almost
[1:16:10] heretical that was almost impossible to
[1:16:12] happen it was Lazarus dead for days but
[1:16:15] she had to believe that even now Lord
[1:16:18] hallelujah hallelujah that he could
[1:16:20] still be changed isn't that right that
[1:16:22] there was still hope for him oh
[1:16:24] Hallelujah
[1:16:28] The Impossible the prophet said is made
[1:16:30] reality when God is taken at his word
[1:16:34] he said now notice how beautiful even
[1:16:36] now Lord even now he said no matter what
[1:16:39] the situation is even now whatever you
[1:16:44] ask God God will do it in the attack
[1:16:47] hour or in that Darkest Hour when they
[1:16:50] feel like there's no light at all oh

[1:21:22] miserable
[1:21:23] why don't you curse God and die
[1:21:26] and he said now look he didn't call our
[1:21:28] foolish woman Prophet said he said thou
[1:21:29] speak is like a foolish woman in other
[1:21:32] words you speak foolish hell it is not
[1:21:34] right the Lord give and the Lord take it
[1:21:37] away even in that adverse condition job
[1:21:40] still found an opportunity to give God
[1:21:43] praise
[1:21:45] the surface all right here or even in
[1:21:48] that time of adversity even in that time
[1:21:51] of darkness in a time when you're
[1:21:53] supposed to be crying and sighing and in
[1:21:56] a pity party job still found a reason
[1:22:00] to give God praise oh to never turn his
[1:22:03] back on God oh hallelujah oh we ought to
[1:22:06] be faithful tonight amen he didn't call
[1:22:08] a fool he said thou speak is like a
[1:22:10] foolish woman
[1:22:11] said the Lord Give the Lord take it away
[1:22:12] bless the name of the Lord he knew he
[1:22:15] was going to die and he said oh Lord
[1:22:16] praise God for what he said 14th chapter
[1:22:18] of Joe the prophet said he said there
[1:22:20] was hope in a tree if it blows down he
[1:22:22] knowed he had been uh influenced people
[1:22:25] he said okay his life had been useful
[1:22:27] God never gave us our lives just to hang
[1:22:30] around see he give us he giveth us to be
[1:22:32] useful for him give all lives to be
[1:22:35] useful to him to God so we are to be
[1:22:38] used of him
[1:22:39] it's not the prophet said eternal life
[1:22:42] is living for others isn't that right
[1:22:45] and the adopted son cannot have power
[1:22:47] over other things unless he has power
[1:22:49] over himself we are called to a life of
[1:22:54] service of servitude even Jesus told his
[1:22:58] disciples when he was washing their feet
[1:23:00] he said let the greatest is among you
[1:23:02] let him be your servant we are here to
[1:23:06] serve the final way to help somebody
[1:23:08] else to reach somebody else this gift is
[1:23:12] for others oh Halloween God give you
[1:23:14] Faith put your knowledge and Temperance
[1:23:16] what is it for it's for your Fallen
[1:23:18] brother it's for your Fallen sister to
[1:23:20] have Temperance with them knowing what's
[1:23:22] in their hearts calling them a
[1:23:25] difference knowledge to know the
[1:23:26] difference patience with them calling us
[1:23:29] with them brotherly kindness with them
[1:23:31] oh hello to forgive them as Christ
[1:23:35] forgive us then we could extend
[1:23:37] ourselves and express God's kindness to
[1:23:40] others by showing forgiveness oh hello
[1:23:43] because if you don't do not forgive then
[1:23:46] neither will your father in Heaven
[1:23:47] forgive you
[1:23:48] oh Hallelujah isn't that right isn't
[1:23:51] that right hallelujah hallelujah so if
[1:23:54] you do not forgive you put yourself in
[1:23:56] the seat of the judgment
[1:23:58] you are in the seat of the scornful
[1:24:01] when you do not forgive because you're
[1:24:03] saying I I deserve the right to judge
[1:24:06] them isn't that right
[1:24:08] and the Bible said he that judging
[1:24:10] himself shall not be judged but when
[1:24:12] we're judged with Jason of the Lord and
[1:24:14] to show his death till he come so it's
[1:24:16] not in our position to judge we give up
[1:24:18] all right we say Lord you judge this
[1:24:20] matter you judge this issue I release
[1:24:24] them I forgive them of this wrong it's
[1:24:27] not my right I am not going to take any
[1:24:30] right in this matter you forgive I
[1:24:33] forgive them and you take charge of it
[1:24:35] now you pray for that person in a real
[1:24:38] way and that is God living out that is
[1:24:42] Christ Living out of you the individual
[1:24:44] is that right when the people were in
[1:24:46] the wrong Moses threw himself in the way
[1:24:49] he said kill me instead
[1:24:52] that's the attitude of a Christian
[1:24:54] anybody who sits in a seat of
[1:24:56] persecution that's not the spirit of
[1:24:58] Christianity please it's not right in
[1:25:01] the seat of accusation because the devil
[1:25:03] is the accuser of the brethren
[1:25:06] so when they begin to accuse accuse what
[1:25:09] be careful now
[1:25:10] you're doing the double job
[1:25:12] you're called to forgive you're called
[1:25:15] to repent you're called to make it right
[1:25:17] you're called to let them go despite
[1:25:19] what they have done to you and pray for
[1:25:22] that person
[1:25:24] the Bible said when you stand praying
[1:25:26] forgive if you are bought against any
[1:25:28] that your father in Heaven may also
[1:25:31] forgive you in other words when you were
[1:25:33] ready to go to the angel to take the
[1:25:34] book you have to be on speaking terms
[1:25:37] with that angel
[1:25:39] and brotherly kindness
[1:25:41] puts you on speaking terms
[1:25:43] with that angel in other words if you
[1:25:45] lock God's neck he locks yours and you
[1:25:47] can ask what you will
[1:25:49] you can't forgive
[1:25:51] I didn't mean to go there tonight but
[1:25:53] praise God
[1:25:55] oh a word to the wise huh well this is
[1:25:58] our age requirement right so
[1:25:59] we have to come to forgiveness the blood
[1:26:02] has to be displayed Upon Our chests
[1:26:04] praise God we have to show the blood for
[1:26:06] our age probably kindness speaking the
[1:26:09] truth and love
[1:26:10] that's what this Ephesians Ministry is
[1:26:13] supposed to have this crest of Love upon
[1:26:15] them to speak the word in love to the to
[1:26:18] the individual praise God Amen not speak
[1:26:20] lovely the truth but the truth in love
[1:26:22] wrapped in love is the truth of God
[1:26:25] presented amen wrapped in birthday
[1:26:27] kindness wrapped in forgiveness wrapped
[1:26:29] in the honey praise God Amen to bring
[1:26:31] amen the backslider in to bring the
[1:26:34] Crooked one in and to straighten out all
[1:26:36] the Crooked pants
[1:26:37] and make them straight it's not right oh
[1:26:40] my I'm I'm spraying on here amen okay
[1:26:42] just have a couple minutes and I'll
[1:26:43] finish I'll close this out praise God
[1:26:45] Amen but do you love him
[1:26:47] amen I hope this helps you tonight oh
[1:26:51] Hallelujah
[1:26:52] it's not right
[1:26:54] all right so let me skip down here now
[1:26:55] he said uh Prophet said now
[1:27:01] is that the hour of God Deliverance he
[1:27:02] said why brother if we come into the
[1:27:04] presence of God like Moses did why it
[1:27:06] was a revolutionary to him why it would
[1:27:08] revolutionize why in the light of that
[1:27:10] angel of God standing there on a
[1:27:12] mountain that day everything that he
[1:27:14] once had or thought would never happen
[1:27:16] come to be a reality he said and I think
[1:27:19] if men and women today would ever step
[1:27:21] into the light of the Holy Spirit under
[1:27:24] the unction of God's spirit and the
[1:27:25] light of God word everything that God
[1:27:27] had promised will eliminate to you and
[1:27:30] it will be real again
[1:27:32] he said that's the reason why Moses
[1:27:34] failed in the first place here's what he
[1:27:35] here's what's the matter here's a hitter
[1:27:37] statement Prophet said here's the reason
[1:27:39] Moses failed it was the lack of having
[1:27:42] what the burning bush had he said that's
[1:27:45] right he said that's what our failure is
[1:27:47] today is the lack of having what the
[1:27:49] Holy Spirit has Amen in other words he
[1:27:52] met that bonding Bush but what was
[1:27:54] supposed to happen was that burning was
[1:27:56] supposed to come inside of him
[1:27:58] the Holy Spirit but that's the promise
[1:28:01] that we have received tonight the
[1:28:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost to abide in
[1:28:05] the heart of the believer oh and to make
[1:28:08] you a real Christian tonight oh do you
[1:28:11] believe it tonight amen he said that
[1:28:13] sort of failure today is lacking what
[1:28:15] the Holy Spirit has and the Holy Spirit
[1:28:17] has all good things for us and we
[1:28:21] receive the Holy Spirit and then all
[1:28:24] things are possible not only possible
[1:28:26] but promised to us amen
[1:28:30] Jesus said ask the father anything in my
[1:28:32] name I'll do it if he abide in me and my
[1:28:34] words abide in you ask what you will and
[1:28:37] it will be given to you see when we step
[1:28:39] into the light of God's word with the
[1:28:42] unction of the Holy Spirit to shine the
[1:28:44] light on it brother The Impossible
[1:28:45] becomes possible then oh let's strike
[1:28:48] our text and go home amen so we read
[1:28:50] about Samson isn't that right Brazil
[1:28:52] could get ready to come Samson saw a
[1:28:54] possibility
[1:28:55] even in his pollen condition
[1:28:58] Samson who was once the champion of his
[1:29:00] people Israel he was revered he was
[1:29:04] respected he was a hero but now he has
[1:29:07] been put to shame as a consequence of
[1:29:10] his own actions isn't that all right
[1:29:12] here he was crying and at the Mill and
[1:29:15] his eyes were tugged out once a glorious
[1:29:17] Son of God now he's in a pit of Oblivion
[1:29:20] he's in a pit of Shame doing the devil's
[1:29:24] work crying at the Mill every day but
[1:29:27] the Bible said a shock of his hair began
[1:29:31] to grow out even in that condition even
[1:29:34] in that situation of adversity here
[1:29:37] there was still hope there was still
[1:29:39] opportunity there was still a chance for
[1:29:42] him to come back or into the arms of God
[1:29:45] and tonight I don't matter what
[1:29:47] adversity doesn't matter what shame
[1:29:50] doesn't matter what jail cell the devil
[1:29:52] puts you in tonight you've got to see
[1:29:55] the opportunity that God has presenting
[1:29:57] to you tonight he is presenting to you
[1:30:00] he is preaching to you tonight oh
[1:30:03] Hallelujah an abundant entrance is being
[1:30:06] ministered to you oh Hallelujah hallelu
[1:30:09] into the Everlasting Love of Jesus
[1:30:10] Christ oh isn't that right his eyes were
[1:30:13] dug out he was made a slave to the enemy
[1:30:16] and on once more the prophet said there
[1:30:18] he stood and he began to remember the
[1:30:21] things of his errors where he had left
[1:30:23] the straight a narrow road where he had
[1:30:26] got away from God's promise and he cried
[1:30:30] out Lord Revenge my eyes why did he do
[1:30:35] this he knew there was a possibility now
[1:30:39] is he I want you to listen the prophet
[1:30:41] said Samson must have thought of where
[1:30:44] he had left the patch where he saw it
[1:30:46] was too late now he saw where he had
[1:30:48] left the patch and he thought there must
[1:30:51] be a possibility that God would answer
[1:30:55] he knew if he could repent he knew if he
[1:30:58] could get caught to see that he was
[1:31:01] sorry for his error that there was a
[1:31:03] possibility that God would achieve his
[1:31:07] promise that God will do it the prophet
[1:31:10] said God will do it he said he is going
[1:31:14] to do it oh somebody say Amen tonight if
[1:31:17] you believe that same God is here
[1:31:20] tonight to Grant you a possibility that
[1:31:23] you can be healed there's a possibility
[1:31:25] here that you could be sealed there's a
[1:31:28] possibility that you could be saved
[1:31:30] there's a possibility that your blind
[1:31:33] eyes could open there's a possibility
[1:31:35] for Revival there's a possibility for
[1:31:37] the to walk the blind to speak
[1:31:40] the death to hear there is a possibility
[1:31:43] tonight don't tell me that God brought
[1:31:46] us out here to die God did not bring us
[1:31:49] out here the perish with no illness get
[1:31:52] up and get your land tonight there is a
[1:31:57] possibility tonight for you to be healed
[1:31:59] for you to be delivered for you to be
[1:32:02] changed for you to be transformed for
[1:32:04] you to receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:32:07] Ghost there is a possibility tonight
[1:32:14] hallelujah oh
[1:32:15] Set Me Free there is a possibility
[1:32:19] tonight oh Hallelujah the prophet said
[1:32:23] God will do it he's going to do it he's
[1:32:26] that same now God is going to have that
[1:32:30] church he said don't you worry she's
[1:32:33] going to be there the holy spirit will
[1:32:37] move so in that church until the church
[1:32:39] and Christ will be that same Spirit
[1:32:42] Luther stood on the feet of
[1:32:44] justification he said Wesley stood in a
[1:32:47] heartbeat of love signification but it's
[1:32:50] raised up to the head now see it's more
[1:32:53] than that she's denominated and so forth
[1:32:55] like that and they died never come back
[1:32:57] to normal they will never come back but
[1:32:59] still the prophet said there is a seed
[1:33:01] of life that's there that's coming on he
[1:33:05] said but notice he could play something
[1:33:06] Softly
[1:33:07] but notice Samson thought there that
[1:33:10] there must be a possibility
[1:33:12] he caught the idea
[1:33:17] that the church don't catch that
[1:33:19] they don't realize that there is a
[1:33:22] possibility of a Revival they don't
[1:33:25] realize the possibility they haven't
[1:33:28] caught the vision yet they just sit
[1:33:32] or deceived Church by the world Prophet
[1:33:33] said and here's my only hope I have this
[1:33:35] morning
[1:33:36] to wind up my message is this that while
[1:33:39] Samson was bound
[1:33:41] a new shock of here growed out the
[1:33:45] prophet said God send us another church
[1:33:47] just before the end time that the power
[1:33:50] of the Holy Ghost can come into her in
[1:33:54] the demonstrations of the spirit and
[1:33:57] Saint Mark 16 can't follow that church
[1:34:01] Acts 2 4 Acts 2 38 all of it will be
[1:34:05] following right along with the church he
[1:34:08] said signs and wonders accompany the
[1:34:11] apostles you can stand I'm getting ready
[1:34:12] to close great signs of his resurrection
[1:34:15] accompany them he said while we're in
[1:34:17] prison surely surely God's growing a
[1:34:21] crop somewhere for that last great kill
[1:34:25] may it be you my Christian friend here
