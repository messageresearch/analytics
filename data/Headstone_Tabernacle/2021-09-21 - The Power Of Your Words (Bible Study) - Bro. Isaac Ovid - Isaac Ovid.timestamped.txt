[14:52] for word of prayer
[14:54] our gracious heavenly father we
[14:56] come tonight lord
[14:59] gathered in this virtual setting
[15:02] not having a clear understanding that
[15:05] where there are two lord of three
[15:07] gathered in your name lord there you are
[15:09] in the midst of them so father we come
[15:11] tonight the lord as a body of believers
[15:14] lord with faith in our hearts lord to
[15:17] believe that anything is possible lord
[15:20] and all things are possible
[15:23] lord may you touch the hearts
[15:25] minds the lives of every son and every
[15:28] daughter that's here
[15:30] lord i don't believe that
[15:32] anyone is here by accident tonight i
[15:34] don't believe anyone is here by chance
[15:36] tonight but
[15:37] lord it is predetermined that we are
[15:39] here
[15:40] lord and we are in this room tonight
[15:42] because we understand that we have to
[15:44] keep looking into the word so we can
[15:47] line up with this word father so help us
[15:49] tonight lord as we go into your
[15:51] scriptures during this bible study this
[15:53] time when we can have a conversation
[15:55] around your word lord may you speak to
[15:58] us lord in the way that only you can we
[16:01] commit the service into your hands in
[16:03] the precious name of jesus christ and
[16:04] the church says
[16:05] amen and amen
[16:08] and amen well certainly a great
[16:10] privilege to be back here tonight
[16:13] in our
[16:14] time of conversation around the world
[16:16] our bible study and certainly appreciate
[16:19] one and all
[16:20] for taking the time and making the
[16:23] effort uh to be here
[16:25] and it is a sacrifice
[16:28] but beyond the sacrifice it is a
[16:30] responsibility it is an understanding
[16:34] it is a commitment and it's not a
[16:36] commitment to
[16:37] impress anybody it's not a commitment to
[16:39] please anybody it is a responsibility
[16:42] and a commitment to the destiny of your
[16:46] soul of your household of your life
[16:49] you know and i think many times
[16:51] we underestimate how much
[16:54] our activities have a role to play in
[16:56] our destiny
[16:57] how much our thoughts our words our
[17:01] actions have an impact on us and the
[17:04] things
[17:05] around us you know and
[17:07] in fact by the grace of god this study
[17:09] tonight
[17:10] is you know many times you go through
[17:12] different experiences and then you find
[17:14] the answers to it in the word you know
[17:16] and it kind of shocks you it shakes you
[17:19] it sort of reminds you of how important
[17:22] some of these things are
[17:24] and as believers and ideas see as
[17:27] message believers
[17:29] it is really important for us to
[17:31] understand that the whole purpose of the
[17:33] message was to open the bible that is in
[17:37] and of itself is a deep understanding
[17:40] because the bible is a closed book
[17:42] without the ministry of that great
[17:44] elijah prophet but when you have access
[17:47] to the open book you could go in there
[17:50] and
[17:51] relook at things that you may have
[17:52] assumed or we look at things you may
[17:54] have read and catch a deeper
[17:56] understanding to prepare us for the
[17:58] rapture to prepare us for the
[18:00] resurrection to prepare for walking in
[18:03] perfection as god would say to abraham
[18:06] walk before me and be perfect
[18:09] you know so i want to challenge and
[18:10] encourage us tonight as we go into this
[18:13] simple study i don't know how long i
[18:15] will be i am here tonight at my post of
[18:18] duty as it were i was sharing with
[18:20] brother ovid um this evening uh my body
[18:23] is on a little pressure
[18:25] but i have a responsibility tonight i
[18:28] wish every single time i come i'm at 100
[18:31] strength but we don't control these
[18:33] things in life and there are times we
[18:35] report for duty it doesn't matter how we
[18:37] feel it doesn't matter what else is
[18:39] going on but we have a responsibility
[18:41] ahead of us and that's part of of the
[18:43] way god sets things up that time you
[18:45] know so
[18:47] i have a thought tonight and like i
[18:49] would have said before sometimes i you
[18:51] know give a back story and a background
[18:53] before getting into the theme or to the
[18:55] topic but tonight i want to you know get
[18:57] straight to what i want to speak on
[18:59] tonight and it is a topic that i think
[19:02] will help us in so many ways
[19:04] so for a title tonight
[19:07] the power of your words
[19:10] the power
[19:11] of your words we're going to go through
[19:14] a bible study on the power of your words
[19:17] and we're going to read from different
[19:19] places so i trust that you have your
[19:21] bible in a bible study i trust you may
[19:23] have some kind of notepad or some kind
[19:26] of way to kind of remember because
[19:28] unlike other teachings where i would
[19:30] have spent a lot of time in perhaps one
[19:32] specific chapter i do have different
[19:35] places we're going to spend time in and
[19:37] we do have three main areas we will look
[19:39] at but i do think that each of these
[19:41] scriptures are really important for us
[19:44] to take a look at and to see to what
[19:46] extent
[19:48] our successes our failures
[19:50] our victories and our challenges
[19:53] uh of
[19:54] our own doing and more than that
[19:57] really as a result of what we see what
[20:00] we speak
[20:01] to understand how important words are
[20:03] you know and if we take it back to the
[20:05] very beginning
[20:07] the world was created by the spoken word
[20:10] and that it of itself is powerful
[20:13] because we understand that this old
[20:14] prophetic ministry is to bring us back
[20:16] to the spoken word which is the original
[20:18] seed and the same way god would create
[20:21] and say let there be light and let there
[20:24] be you know and and we know what genesis
[20:26] has in it it's the same way down to the
[20:28] end sons have to come into manifestation
[20:31] and be able to speak and the brother
[20:34] adam teaches us that what they speak
[20:36] what they say is going to happen the way
[20:39] they speak it so i want to start firstly
[20:41] just to kind of lay a background
[20:44] before i get into kind of digging into
[20:46] this topic a bit
[20:47] about words and the impact of words and
[20:50] you know before i even get to the
[20:52] scripture words are powerful and
[20:54] words and if you think about it and um
[20:56] today i i
[20:58] was able to drop my daughter
[21:00] by by by her grandparents for a short
[21:03] while today you know so passed over it
[21:05] was babysitting
[21:07] um sort of babysitting today
[21:09] you know when i got back my dad was
[21:11] telling me about how much woods
[21:14] isabel was speaking you know what you
[21:16] were saying and you know
[21:18] um you know as and my dad calls it the
[21:20] birth of language you know as a child
[21:23] begins to connect the dots and
[21:25] words become phrases and
[21:28] sentences and then entire conversations
[21:30] you know and when you really think about
[21:33] it you know words are powerful and they
[21:35] are means of communication in fact out
[21:37] of every creature that god created
[21:40] out of all of the living creations as it
[21:43] were you know no matter how intelligent
[21:46] or how unique different animals are
[21:48] only one you know being as it will was
[21:52] given that ability to speak which is an
[21:54] attribute that until that man was
[21:58] created you know only god was the one
[22:01] who could speak you know and that
[22:02] ability to actually
[22:04] form words as a means of communication
[22:07] but beyond the fact that it is a means
[22:10] of communication we all know that words
[22:12] are powerful words can inspire us
[22:15] words can encourage us
[22:17] words can motivate us
[22:19] words can push us to go beyond what we
[22:22] believe was even possible but words can
[22:24] also discourage us
[22:26] words can depress us someone can say
[22:29] something to you and those words can
[22:31] just take your victory away
[22:34] brother branham would reference someone
[22:36] spoke a blue streak so he was so
[22:38] cautious
[22:40] of who he allowed
[22:42] in his atmosphere if i could use that
[22:44] phrase because he was so conscious of
[22:47] the power of what words can be
[22:50] and the same way god can use words to
[22:53] create and god could could use words to
[22:55] heal and so many ways we see true
[22:58] examples the real question becomes as
[23:00] sons and daughters of god how are we
[23:03] using words
[23:04] because the words we speak and impact
[23:06] our relationships it can impact our
[23:09] families it can impact our businesses it
[23:12] can impact our success or failure
[23:15] how you speak about your business how
[23:17] you speak about your boss how you speak
[23:20] about your country how you speak about
[23:22] you have to realize that for us
[23:24] under the covenant that we are under our
[23:27] words are really powerful
[23:30] so i want to kind of lay a thing there
[23:32] and then i'm going to get a bit deeper
[23:33] as we progress so i trust you come
[23:35] tonight to kind of look at yourself and
[23:37] i find that in studying some of these
[23:38] things it is it becomes very
[23:40] introspective to weigh now carefully and
[23:43] it it makes even more valuable this time
[23:46] that we have together so i'm going to
[23:48] start
[23:49] in hebrews 11.
[23:51] you know we're going to touch a few
[23:53] places but hebrew 11 which is the that
[23:56] is a chapter of faith you know but
[23:58] there's there's one verse in there i
[24:00] want to start with tonight at the
[24:01] foundation hebrews 11 verse 3
[24:04] through faith
[24:06] so
[24:06] this gives a context because this is the
[24:08] fifth chapter and before and and we will
[24:12] recall that hebrews 11 goes into by
[24:14] faith abraham by faith and it goes
[24:16] through all the heroes of it but before
[24:18] paul
[24:19] and and and i always leave this as a
[24:21] context paul is speaking here to hebrews
[24:25] all right this is not a letter to the
[24:26] romans this is not a letter to the
[24:28] corinthians this is this is a letter to
[24:31] people who were steeped in a deep
[24:33] understanding as it were of of where
[24:36] they came from their heritage and their
[24:38] their tribal origin and on and all of of
[24:41] of these things right so he's speaking
[24:43] and he's laying the foundation by faith
[24:45] abel you know later by fake enough by
[24:47] faith abraham but before he even gets
[24:49] into
[24:50] all of these heroes of faith that they
[24:52] can actually identify with
[24:55] he speaks of through faith
[24:58] so the first reference of theaters
[25:01] that's what he uses is through fate we
[25:03] understand
[25:05] that the worlds
[25:06] plural were framed by the word of god
[25:10] so that the things which are seen
[25:13] were not made of things which do appear
[25:16] and that itself is really powerful
[25:18] because it speaks right there
[25:21] of two powerful things one is defeat
[25:23] that without faith you can't even have
[25:25] this conversation
[25:27] that's everything because it's true
[25:28] faith we can have an understanding so
[25:30] through faith we understand so our
[25:33] understanding of this thing is based on
[25:36] our faith so if you have no fear tonight
[25:38] you can't even go into an understanding
[25:40] of the things that we're going to
[25:41] discuss
[25:42] all right the foundation of this mystery
[25:45] this revelation this understanding this
[25:47] journey is based on faith so through
[25:49] faith we understand that the words were
[25:52] framed by the word of god and i want you
[25:54] to think of this for a second the word
[25:56] framing
[25:57] framing so words framed by the word of
[26:00] god
[26:01] for anybody who has seen construction in
[26:03] action and you're framing something to
[26:06] do something you're you're creating
[26:08] something i want you to see it more than
[26:11] just god speaking and it's being created
[26:14] because paul gives us a deeper context
[26:17] to the power of god's words he said
[26:19] god's words actually frame the world so
[26:22] to even go deeper i want to relatively
[26:25] amplified
[26:27] and in the amplified it says by faith
[26:29] that is with an inherent trust and
[26:32] enduring confidence in the power wisdom
[26:35] and goodness of god that is the so if
[26:38] you want to want to know what fear paul
[26:39] talking about that day is he fatim by
[26:41] faith that is the inherent trust do we
[26:44] have inherent trust tonight and enduring
[26:46] confidence this is just confidence that
[26:49] don't stop being confident
[26:51] enduring confidence in the power wisdom
[26:54] and goodness of god we understand that
[26:57] the worlds
[26:59] and in the amplified it said universe
[27:01] ages
[27:02] were framed and created
[27:04] and in the amplified it clarifies formed
[27:07] put in order and equipped for their
[27:11] intended purpose by the word of god
[27:15] i wanted to catch this so the word of
[27:17] god when god said let there be it was
[27:19] not just a word just create that word
[27:22] that was released from the mouth of god
[27:24] was able to form was able to put in
[27:27] order and able to equip for its intended
[27:31] purpose everything that god spoke
[27:34] so i want us to understand because i'm
[27:37] not just speaking about the power of
[27:38] words to understand well god speaks it
[27:41] needs to be contextual to our lives
[27:43] because we could speak peace we could
[27:46] speak god jesus spoke to the storm peace
[27:48] be still
[27:52] words
[27:53] affected the environment
[27:56] words affected somebody who was sick and
[27:58] was down healed words lazarus comfort
[28:02] affected someone from one dimension
[28:05] coming into another dimension how are we
[28:07] using our words tonight so i just want
[28:10] to lay this foundation here true fate
[28:13] and i believe if we are here tonight we
[28:15] have faith or our faith is growing our
[28:17] faith is increasing because our faith
[28:18] comes by hearing and by hearing the word
[28:21] of god and here we are focused on seeing
[28:23] what god wants us to see from scripture
[28:26] tonight so that our faith can be rooted
[28:28] in a foundation that we can now go
[28:30] deeper into what we want to get into
[28:32] tonight but i just want to read this
[28:34] part one more time because i think it's
[28:36] really powerful by faith that is with an
[28:39] inherent trust an inherent trust
[28:43] means nobody can really shift that trust
[28:45] in it built in
[28:47] you don't know why you trust god so much
[28:48] it's like inherent trust you may not
[28:50] understand everything but it's inherent
[28:52] it's somehow you can't you can't put
[28:54] words to it but you truly believe this
[28:56] thing is real it's not a powerful a
[28:58] powerful concept paul is speaking about
[29:00] an inherent trust that god is going to
[29:02] heal you and inherent trust that he's
[29:04] going to make a way where there seems to
[29:06] be no way and heroin trusts that he
[29:08] could take impossible situations and
[29:10] make it possible i'm i'm teaching
[29:12] tonight but i feel like i'm preaching an
[29:14] inherent trust and enduring confidence a
[29:18] confidence that don't take vacation
[29:21] a confidence that don't take sick days a
[29:24] coincidence that no matter what a
[29:26] doctor's report says you still have an
[29:28] enduring confidence in the power
[29:31] wisdom and goodness of god we understand
[29:34] that the world's universe ages were
[29:38] framed and created formed
[29:41] put in order and equipped for the
[29:44] intended purpose by the word of god so
[29:47] that what is seen was not made out of
[29:49] things which are visible
[29:52] now
[29:52] we're talking about power
[29:54] of your words so we want to make a
[29:57] couple references to see through the old
[29:59] and new testament about this subject
[30:02] about what comes out of our mouth all
[30:04] right so go with me if you can to
[30:07] proverbs 12
[30:08] and verse 6.
[30:13] proverbs 12
[30:15] and verse 6.
[30:21] for those who haven't read their bible
[30:22] in a while so these are like a workout
[30:24] it's like a
[30:26] like an exercise
[30:28] moving through scripture we're gonna
[30:30] make a few laps old testament new
[30:32] testament we're gonna make a you know
[30:34] doing like
[30:35] thing we're going back and forth and
[30:37] comfortable
[30:38] comfortable right so proverbs 12 6 says
[30:41] the words
[30:43] of the wicked
[30:45] are to lie and wait for blood
[30:49] but the mouth of the upright shall
[30:51] deliver them
[30:54] and until you begin to look closely you
[30:57] realize that throughout scripture
[30:58] there's this referencing continually of
[31:01] words and the character behind the words
[31:04] now in the amplified that same verse we
[31:07] just read says the malevolent or bad
[31:10] words of the wicked lie and wait for
[31:13] innocent blood to slander
[31:17] that's the amplified
[31:18] but the mouth of the upright will rescue
[31:21] and protect them
[31:22] so we're seeing right here that words
[31:25] could kill
[31:27] words could rescue
[31:30] words could protect
[31:33] anybody with me tonight
[31:35] let's move a little further still in the
[31:37] book of proverbs to chapter 18 and verse
[31:41] 21.
[31:42] we should all know this particular verse
[31:45] of scripture proverbs 18
[31:47] 21
[31:49] death and life
[31:51] are in the power of the tongue
[31:55] and they that love it
[31:57] shall eat the fruit thereof
[32:00] i want to read it one more time death
[32:02] and life
[32:03] are in the power of the tongue so we
[32:05] just said in the previous verse we read
[32:07] we talk about words can kill words can
[32:09] rescue words can deliver words can
[32:12] protect and now we are seeing that death
[32:15] and life are in the power of the tongue
[32:19] and then i love it shall eat the fruit
[32:21] thereof now that second part of this
[32:23] verse few people spend time to really
[32:25] think about it and understand what is
[32:27] being said here
[32:28] so in the amplified it says death and
[32:30] life are in the power of the tongue
[32:33] and those who love it
[32:35] and indulge it
[32:37] will eat its fruit and bear the
[32:40] consequences of their words
[32:43] so in other words this shall eat the
[32:45] fruit thereof is not positive fruit it
[32:48] is any kind of fruit
[32:50] negative or positive in other words
[32:53] words are also a seed
[32:55] so the life and death of words are a
[32:57] seed that when it comes to fruition will
[33:00] have a fruit
[33:02] in other words are you prepared for the
[33:04] fruit of your words
[33:06] because you could speak positive into
[33:09] your children you could speak positive
[33:11] into your wife into your husband into a
[33:13] situation
[33:16] or you could speak negative
[33:18] and when you speak
[33:20] and there is a fruit out of your results
[33:23] in other words the fruit don't even have
[33:24] to be the same day the same week the
[33:26] same month the same year
[33:28] but you say something to somebody
[33:32] and you reap a harvest at some point
[33:35] and the harvest can be positive i have
[33:38] had people say to me brother isaac
[33:40] something you said five years ago stay
[33:42] with me and help me make certain
[33:44] decisions
[33:45] that is the fruit of a positive
[33:47] statement
[33:49] and you hear people say well my father
[33:52] tell me so and so and i never among to
[33:54] nobody and it took me 20 years to get an
[33:56] open system
[33:58] because the fruit of that statement
[34:00] created a situation
[34:02] so i want us to understand that a lot of
[34:06] the things that we go through in life
[34:08] is as a result of our words
[34:11] if we can get that to resonate and if i
[34:13] could encourage you even the lesson we
[34:16] want to get tonight is we need to stop
[34:19] speaking negative
[34:23] we have to kill it tonight the negative
[34:26] talk the talk of failure the talk of it
[34:29] not possible it cannot happen i cannot
[34:32] make it in the natural world
[34:36] business leaders motivational speakers
[34:39] talk about the the the need of speaking
[34:42] positive
[34:45] i was sharing it but over somebody i
[34:46] heard about not a spiritual person not a
[34:49] religious person and he said his
[34:51] grandmother encouraged him to speak
[34:53] positive every night no matter how bad a
[34:55] day was he had a good day out
[34:57] and no matter how it was and he said
[34:59] that helped frame him
[35:01] for life and set into so much
[35:03] achievements
[35:04] so i was pondering when the bible say
[35:07] let the weak say i am strong it is a
[35:09] contrast there it is a mind-blowing
[35:12] contrast
[35:15] because i could have come in here and
[35:16] said church i am exhausted a white other
[35:19] tired i can't even make
[35:23] and if i spend time digging the hole
[35:26] in a kind of concrete deposition and i
[35:29] cast the floor and by time i don't care
[35:32] moving them
[35:34] but if i come tonight saying listen i've
[35:36] got to make it i've got to do this we
[35:38] got to overcome and you speak whatever
[35:40] the situation in your house my business
[35:42] has to survive my home has to make it my
[35:44] son must be delivered
[35:46] that is that is powerful let the weak
[35:49] the bible not seeing you're not
[35:51] weakening this is mind-blowing
[35:53] it acknowledging the fact that you're in
[35:55] weakness but you are declaring the
[35:57] complete opposite of your present
[36:00] reality
[36:01] isn't that a powerful thing
[36:04] so so this is not saying let me weak say
[36:07] i will be stronger
[36:09] so this is not you seeing i will be
[36:11] strong this is let the weak say i am
[36:13] strong
[36:14] so you are declaring now
[36:17] what god's thoughts about you already
[36:20] are oh i hope this whole year tonight
[36:23] you are declaring in the present what
[36:26] god's perspective the picture that god
[36:29] has when he looks at his picture and he
[36:31] looks at you is two different pictures
[36:34] until you align with his picture i want
[36:37] us to appreciate that god is not trying
[36:39] to get his picture to line up with ours
[36:42] what god wants us for our pity to line
[36:44] up with his
[36:46] so true joel in chapter three he said
[36:49] let the weak say it say i am strong
[36:54] ignore your feelings ignore what's going
[36:56] on
[36:58] and the power of your world just like
[37:00] you say if you shall see it in this
[37:02] mountain
[37:03] it's it's spoken word so let's go on
[37:06] now let's get a little deeper into this
[37:08] thing and this is when by the grace of
[37:11] god as i was looking through the
[37:12] scripture i said i said boy we have some
[37:14] work to do we have some work to do here
[37:17] these are written in red
[37:19] we're going to matthew 12.
[37:22] so this is jesus talking now
[37:25] so this is not
[37:27] not that we are
[37:29] placing different values or different
[37:31] scriptures but we have to acknowledge
[37:33] that when it written in red we need to
[37:35] pay a particular attention because this
[37:38] is jesus himself who take time to pen
[37:41] these things or articulate these things
[37:43] so we could have a context of what jesus
[37:46] himself said
[37:48] now this is a a scripture i know some
[37:51] are aware of it and others really have
[37:52] been spending quality time to look at
[37:54] this carefully yeah
[37:56] matthew 12
[37:58] 31
[38:00] jesus is speaking here wherefore i say
[38:02] unto you
[38:04] all manner of sin
[38:06] and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men
[38:11] but
[38:14] so the fact that there's a but
[38:17] speaks that
[38:18] there is
[38:19] actions or activities or things outside
[38:22] of all manner of sin that god have a
[38:24] real issue with
[38:26] so let's take this slowly now because we
[38:28] need to drive on this road it will get
[38:30] all bumpy there'll be a little
[38:31] turbulence on this flight but we need to
[38:33] get to the other side are we going to
[38:35] make it true all right
[38:37] wherefore i say unto you all manner of
[38:39] sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto
[38:42] men but
[38:43] blasphemy against the holy ghost shall
[38:47] not be forgiven unto men
[38:53] jesus goes on he says and whosoever
[38:57] speaketh a word against the son of man
[39:00] it shall be forgiven him but
[39:03] whosoever now notice
[39:06] this is again jesus is going after what
[39:08] he's saying
[39:11] i want us to understand the power of
[39:12] words here all right so this is not
[39:15] about belief
[39:16] this is not about even actions this
[39:19] whole conversation
[39:20] jesus is addressing is about speaking
[39:24] all right so verse 32 whosoever speaketh
[39:27] a word not a sentence not a paragraph
[39:31] not write an article not out of a
[39:33] conversation whosoever speaking a word
[39:36] against the son of man it shall be
[39:38] forgiven him but whosoever speaking
[39:40] against the holy ghost
[39:43] it shall not be forgiven him
[39:46] neither in this world
[39:48] neither in the world to come
[39:51] i want this to resonate with you to
[39:53] understand
[39:55] the liberty you know they will talk
[39:57] about freedom of speech
[39:59] where does freedom of speech fit in when
[40:02] you bring scripture like this are you
[40:04] free to say what you want against the
[40:06] holy ghost
[40:08] are you really free is there such a
[40:09] thing as freedom of speech when you come
[40:11] into this spiritual realm
[40:14] are you free to speak against the
[40:16] message are you free to speak against
[40:19] the holy ghost are you free to speak
[40:20] against god's word are you free to speak
[40:22] against a brother or sister to how much
[40:25] freedom
[40:27] do we really have to say what we want to
[40:29] say or or think we should see
[40:32] all right so i want this to to help us
[40:35] to grow to understand that our words
[40:38] and we'll see how jesus builds on it all
[40:40] right
[40:43] it shall not be forgiven him neither in
[40:46] this world neither in the world to come
[40:48] verse 33
[40:50] either make the tree good
[40:53] and his fruit good
[40:55] or else make the tree corrupt and his
[40:57] fruit corrupt for the tree is known by
[41:00] his fruit
[41:01] jesus now begins to rip into them now in
[41:04] verse 34 o generation of vipers
[41:09] listen to jesus how can he be an evil
[41:13] speak good things
[41:16] for out of the abundance of the heart
[41:19] the mouth speak it
[41:22] so i could tell what's in you by your
[41:24] word by a conversation what would you
[41:26] like to talk about what entertains you i
[41:29] want us to look at this we going
[41:30] somewhere
[41:34] 35 a good man
[41:36] out of the good treasure of the heart
[41:39] bringing forth good things
[41:41] and that evil man
[41:43] out of the evil treasure bringing forth
[41:46] evil things verse 36
[41:48] i want to nail it down here now but i
[41:50] say unto you
[41:53] this one shook even me and i am a kind
[41:55] of fellow who i don't already play
[41:57] around and i i i don't have time with
[41:59] stupidness but this year shook me the
[42:02] bible said but i say unto you that every
[42:05] idle word
[42:08] that men shall speak
[42:10] they shall give account thereof in the
[42:12] day of judgment
[42:14] you ever think about that
[42:18] every idol would
[42:21] what do you spend time talking about
[42:24] what are the subject of your
[42:26] conversations
[42:28] what do you focus on when you're talking
[42:30] or or
[42:32] doesn't scripture and this is not this
[42:34] is not paul speaking this is not abraham
[42:36] speak again this is not moses speaking
[42:38] this is jesus speaking saying but i say
[42:40] unto you that every idle word
[42:44] that men shall speak they shall give
[42:46] account thereof in the day of judgment
[42:48] verse 37
[42:50] for by thy words
[42:52] thou shalt be justified
[42:54] and by thy words thou shalt be condemned
[42:58] now doesn't this suddenly change
[43:02] this whole conversation about the power
[43:04] of our words
[43:06] i want to read those last two verses in
[43:08] the amplified
[43:10] but i tell you on the day of judgment
[43:13] people will have to give an accounting
[43:17] for every careless or useless word they
[43:21] speak
[43:24] for by your words and listen in the
[43:26] amplified it says reflecting your
[43:28] spiritual condition
[43:32] so your word is like a thermometer to
[43:34] god
[43:36] my my mind
[43:38] for by your words reflecting your
[43:41] spiritual condition
[43:43] you will be justified and acquitted of
[43:46] the guilt of sin and by your words
[43:48] rejecting me you will be condemned and
[43:51] sentenced
[43:54] now let's go
[43:55] deeper into the new testament ephesians
[43:58] we're going to go to ephesians 4
[44:01] verse 29.
[44:03] i hope this is helping somebody tonight
[44:05] because too many of us take the liberty
[44:08] to say what we want about what we want
[44:11] in any kind of way we want and we're
[44:13] actually seeing through scripture that
[44:16] we don't have that license
[44:18] you could get a license to drive a car
[44:21] to drive a truck but you have a license
[44:23] to say what you want how you want and
[44:25] people have they believe that well it's
[44:27] my view and i'm entitled to my opinion
[44:29] really
[44:31] really
[44:36] understand if you consider yourself
[44:39] entitled to your opinion understand that
[44:42] he who liked that tongue because we read
[44:44] the scripture who will love the tongue
[44:46] be prepared to deal with the
[44:47] consequences or the fruit of what you
[44:50] see with your tongue
[44:53] this is challenging us all tonight to
[44:56] rethink how we speak what we say how we
[44:59] address things
[45:01] because we want to be in alignment with
[45:03] what god wants and how he wants us to
[45:05] speak and the subject of our
[45:07] conversations
[45:09] ephesians 4 29
[45:12] let
[45:13] no
[45:14] corrupt communication
[45:17] proceed out of your mouth now this is
[45:20] paul addressing the ephesians church
[45:24] this is not current
[45:28] this is not the other churches this is
[45:30] ephesus and we talk about we want
[45:32] another ephesians
[45:34] look at paul's instruction to this
[45:36] ephesus church
[45:38] let
[45:39] no corrupt communication
[45:41] proceed out of your mouth
[45:44] but i know he's telling him what to talk
[45:47] about
[45:48] but that which is good to the use of
[45:51] edifying
[45:53] that it may minister grace unto the
[45:56] hearers
[45:58] i want to read it in the amplified
[46:00] because i wanted to be clear to resonate
[46:03] with us
[46:05] do not let unwholesome
[46:08] foul
[46:09] profane
[46:11] worthless
[46:12] vulgar words
[46:14] ever come out of your mouth
[46:17] hey let's say it is sometimes uh what's
[46:19] not he gave me watched i was good at but
[46:22] kena he gave me so vexa
[46:25] you even understand how i was good
[46:28] enough until
[46:30] and die when i tell him
[46:32] this scripture saying
[46:34] do not let unwholesome foul profane
[46:38] worthless vulgar words ever come out of
[46:42] your mouth but only such speech
[46:46] as is good for building up others
[46:49] according to the need and the occasion
[46:52] so that it will be a blessing to those
[46:55] who hear you speak
[46:57] so tell me something friends
[46:59] how come
[47:01] people can tell me the indie message
[47:06] and they can't say something good
[47:08] something nice something kind
[47:12] because this is bible teaching
[47:17] anybody with me am i speaking to anybody
[47:19] this year is like abc thing we dealing
[47:22] with you know
[47:23] we are going into any deep mystery we
[47:25] are going here into the tent we are
[47:26] reaching paul we dealing here with
[47:30] bible teaching that paul said to the
[47:32] church in ephesus
[47:34] left no corrupt communication
[47:36] proceed out of your mouth
[47:38] but that which is good to the use of
[47:40] edifying in other words when you're
[47:42] talking encourage somebody you know
[47:44] lift somebody up build somebody up say
[47:47] something nice say something kind say
[47:50] something loyal say something peaceful
[47:52] say something to have somebody know hey
[47:54] you can make it so good to see you
[47:56] things might be rough but you're going
[47:57] to get over that mountain you might be
[47:59] in a valley but keep your head up your
[48:01] redemption draw at night
[48:03] spend time quality time using your words
[48:06] to encourage yourself not negative
[48:08] self-talk positive self-talk i hope this
[48:10] happens by tonight
[48:14] luke 4 22. i'm not going to be too much
[48:16] longer with you
[48:18] luke 4 22 in speaking now so that so so
[48:22] so we went to what jesus said
[48:24] in the book of matthew we went to paul's
[48:27] admonition to the ephesus church or his
[48:30] exhortations in
[48:31] the ephesians church and now we're into
[48:33] luke this is testifying of jesus now so
[48:37] this is the people's view of jesus and i
[48:39] want us to note something about this
[48:41] luke 4 22
[48:45] luke 4
[48:46] 22. and all bear him witness
[48:51] and wandered at the gracious woods
[48:54] which proceeded out of his mouth
[48:57] and they said is not this joseph's son
[49:01] so many times we have a reference this
[49:03] statement is not this joseph's son
[49:06] but he is not this joseph's son
[49:09] actually was not in reference to any
[49:12] miracle
[49:14] it was not in references signs and
[49:17] wonders
[49:18] it was in reference to
[49:20] the way jesus spoke
[49:24] and that's powerful
[49:26] so can people identify that you are
[49:28] christian by the way you speak or when
[49:30] you're in work and in the lunchroom you
[49:33] all are printing
[49:35] you're in the middle you know all the
[49:37] baccanal all the gossip all the latest
[49:39] news and people come to you because you
[49:41] are you are the in person you you are
[49:43] the inside track
[49:47] or can people identify you by the way
[49:50] you speak and carry yourself you see
[49:52] that that that young man that young lady
[49:54] that that that that man over there
[49:57] they're different boy they don't they
[49:58] know they're not involved in talking
[49:59] japanese or something don't even go to
[50:01] them with that
[50:04] is that your testimony
[50:06] do people know and and and do people
[50:09] know what they can come and tell you
[50:11] because if you cut off certain things
[50:15] people wouldn't come to you with your
[50:16] finishing them
[50:18] i remember in school
[50:20] students used to say nah i don't want
[50:22] them over that boy
[50:24] not on that kind of thing
[50:27] men making joking squinting no no one
[50:30] tell him that he's nothing nothing
[50:31] nothing
[50:35] or is it that when he any worker in your
[50:37] studio family you they you want to know
[50:39] you want to know as a joke you want to
[50:41] know what you want to know what they're
[50:42] talking about because i wonder yeah one
[50:44] of you left out
[50:49] or worse yet worse yet you are the one
[50:51] carrying the joke
[50:53] you are the one spreading you anyone any
[50:56] again
[50:57] is this christian behavior is this what
[50:59] jesus from all the scripture you read
[51:01] thus far
[51:03] will the real christians stand up or is
[51:05] it that we have some homework to do in
[51:08] what we talk about and the conversations
[51:10] we have and the subject and the way
[51:12] because now we know and and and again
[51:15] the way we speak on the job
[51:17] most of us and i say it you see the
[51:20] church behavior god bless you how are
[51:23] you doing
[51:24] you know but always say i'm too blessed
[51:26] to be stressed
[51:28] you know and you have all these
[51:29] wonderful things and and you could
[51:30] handle that part real good you have a
[51:32] bachelor's degree in that aspect
[51:36] but let something happen in neighborhood
[51:38] and you caught any village in the
[51:39] company and you see a wall next side of
[51:42] you and your language airline enough
[51:44] with the to bless you it's just god
[51:46] bless you
[51:47] and if there's no there's no correlation
[51:50] between the the you that that when
[51:52] nobody from churches are wrong your
[51:55] conversation and god is saying you have
[51:57] to answer i hope that resonates you know
[51:59] for every idol word
[52:00] so
[52:01] everyone mean is account
[52:04] there's a count of idle words
[52:08] it's not a scary thought
[52:10] i want us to recep tonight in them
[52:12] every idol would
[52:15] how many idol words do we have to repent
[52:17] for
[52:19] how many positive words do we have to
[52:21] now break up to hopefully kind of draw
[52:23] them idle words idle conversations
[52:27] anybody with me tonight
[52:28] i don't know i say well because there's
[52:30] a bible study
[52:33] talk about our bible character and we
[52:35] dig up in that thing but here we know
[52:37] we're going into this thing boy
[52:41] idol words words
[52:44] that have an impact on our destiny
[52:48] i want to touch briefly before we close
[52:50] out tonight
[52:51] not too long
[52:53] three examples as it were three passages
[52:56] of scripture
[52:58] to kind of tie this teaching together
[53:02] uh with and i want to kind of focus on
[53:05] on on saying the right thing
[53:08] you know we know
[53:09] the example that brother branham would
[53:11] have given it's a sahati where he was
[53:13] sharing the testimony of the squirrels
[53:16] and as he was sharing it she said he
[53:18] said that's nothing but the truth
[53:20] but iran would have said she said the
[53:22] right thing
[53:23] and god was so pleased
[53:26] he told the prophet teller whatever she
[53:28] asked for
[53:29] she could get it
[53:31] she had a sick family member
[53:33] she was a poor
[53:35] woman but a brandon would have
[53:36] referenced the fact that she had a
[53:38] little bit of money and when she would
[53:39] have paid her tithes
[53:41] the officers say oh gosh why are we why
[53:43] are we allowing her to do that and she
[53:44] have no money at all but ibrahim said he
[53:47] wanted to give her back to her but god
[53:48] stopped him and said don't give it back
[53:49] to her she'll get blessed
[53:51] by the banana
[53:52] and say eventually he saw how it all
[53:54] connected to the kind of person she was
[53:57] and when the opportunity presented
[53:59] itself on brother branham say whatever
[54:01] you ask for you will get you want money
[54:03] you can get it you want your your your
[54:05] family member to be healed you can get
[54:06] it
[54:08] and she said i wanted salvation of my
[54:10] two boys
[54:12] and she got it
[54:14] amber branham said it was triggered by
[54:17] the fact that she said
[54:18] the right thing
[54:21] she used the power of her words to bring
[54:24] salvation to her
[54:26] house
[54:28] do you realize tonight that your words
[54:30] can bring salvation and healing to your
[54:32] family
[54:35] that if you find a way to put the right
[54:37] words together
[54:39] your family's situation could change
[54:42] tonight is not a message about rebuking
[54:44] you or trying to make you feel bad it's
[54:46] about rethinking
[54:48] how can i say things differently to have
[54:50] a different effect be it in your
[54:52] marriage be it with your children be it
[54:54] with your co-workers be it with your
[54:56] neighbor is there a key to saying the
[54:59] right thing
[55:00] that something would unlock
[55:03] in people around you
[55:05] wouldn't that be a wonderful thing if
[55:07] you could find the key to unlock
[55:09] situations because if words can frame
[55:11] the world
[55:13] and if words can bring healing and words
[55:16] can bring peace and words can bring a
[55:18] level of comfort and you could you could
[55:20] release somebody by your words when you
[55:22] say i forgive you you you bring a
[55:24] release to somebody
[55:27] isn't that powerful to understand the
[55:29] power of words
[55:32] so let's go we're going to go to second
[55:34] kings 20.
[55:37] just six weeks is there not going to be
[55:39] too long but i just want you to see
[55:41] something here
[55:43] second kings 20.
[55:47] and we're going to read from verse one
[55:50] in those days and i'm not gonna spend
[55:52] too much time on this we'll do a
[55:53] separate teaching on hezekiah
[55:56] but there are a couple things with
[55:57] hezekiah we want to bring out but
[55:59] this is a different perspective we want
[56:01] to look at this here second kings 20
[56:03] verse 1 in those days
[56:06] was hezekiah sick unto death
[56:10] and the prophet isaiah
[56:13] major prophet
[56:14] the son of amos
[56:16] came to him
[56:17] and said unto him thus saith the lord
[56:21] set thine house in order for thou shalt
[56:24] die
[56:25] and not live
[56:28] what are
[56:29] what else does say the lord
[56:31] what a statement
[56:33] you don't see the major prophet come to
[56:35] your house hezekiah is king
[56:38] he is sick
[56:40] unto death
[56:42] and the prophet isaiah
[56:44] son of amos came to him and sent him
[56:46] thus said the lord
[56:48] as if when you're sick your mind already
[56:51] be raised
[56:52] hear the prophet come to confirm your
[56:54] deepest fear as it will
[56:56] thus say the lord set that in house and
[56:58] all in other words write your will put
[57:00] things in place
[57:02] you know if you do have money for casket
[57:03] order that all that stuff for those
[57:05] shall die and not live
[57:10] verse two then he turned his face to the
[57:12] wall so this is hezekiah's response
[57:16] and i love it here this is his response
[57:18] to what he heard
[57:19] then he turned his face to the wall and
[57:21] prayed unto the lord saying
[57:24] and and this year is mind-blowing in the
[57:26] context here because what we have is
[57:30] the prayer
[57:32] so i want us to go to this and to see
[57:34] where this goes so hezekiah pray say i
[57:36] beseech thee oh lord remember now how i
[57:40] have walked before thee in truth
[57:42] and with a perfect heart
[57:45] and have done that which is good in thy
[57:47] sight
[57:49] and hezekiah wept so
[57:51] and it came to pass
[57:54] a four isaiah so a four is before isaiah
[57:57] was gone out into the middle court now
[58:00] the word of the lord came to him saying
[58:03] turn again so i want us to picture this
[58:06] a man is sick in his room
[58:08] the prophet of god comes and says say
[58:10] the lord
[58:11] write your will because you're gonna die
[58:16] isaiah is walking out of the house
[58:18] before he is going on the middle court
[58:20] so he'll leave the palace yet he's still
[58:23] walking out
[58:26] god tap him and say turn back around go
[58:28] back inside why
[58:30] because hezekiah prayed a prayer
[58:33] with a combination of words that unlock
[58:37] god's response
[58:39] what was thus said the lord
[58:42] god come now and say hold up hold up
[58:44] pull up verse 5 turn again
[58:46] and tell hezekiah the captain of my
[58:49] people thus saith the lord the god of
[58:52] david thy father i have heard thy prayer
[58:56] isn't prayer
[58:57] putting the right words and having a
[58:59] conversation with god you see the power
[59:02] of words
[59:04] i have seen thy tears behold i will heal
[59:07] thee on the third day thou shalt go up
[59:10] unto the house of the lord
[59:12] and i will add unto thy days 15 years
[59:16] and i will deliver thee so not only did
[59:19] the prayer in other words the words that
[59:22] hezekiah spoke
[59:23] not only brought healing to his body
[59:27] but because of his prayer look at what
[59:30] god did and i will add unto thy days 15
[59:33] years and i will deliver thee and the
[59:37] city out of the hand of the king of
[59:39] syria and i will defend this city for my
[59:43] own sake and for my servant davidson
[59:51] have you figured out
[59:54] the right combination of words the right
[59:58] approach to god your right approach to
[1:00:00] any situation if you understand words
[1:00:02] are key
[1:00:07] doesn't it now refrain you to say lord
[1:00:10] help me
[1:00:11] to say things the right way anybody with
[1:00:14] me tonight is this helping anybody
[1:00:18] let's go on now this is a little deeper
[1:00:20] and it's a bit
[1:00:23] a bit harder to see because it we preach
[1:00:26] it but i want us to catch it now let's
[1:00:27] go to the book of matthew 15.
[1:00:30] this is the second the last reading for
[1:00:31] tonight so
[1:00:33] we are working within
[1:00:35] a little time here
[1:00:37] matthew 15
[1:00:39] and reading from verse 22.
[1:00:42] matthew 15 and verse 22
[1:00:44] and behold a woman of canaan
[1:00:47] came out
[1:00:49] of the same coast and cried unto him
[1:00:51] saying
[1:00:52] have mercy on me o lord thou son of
[1:00:55] david
[1:00:57] my daughter is grievously vexed with the
[1:01:00] devil
[1:01:07] verse
[1:01:08] 23
[1:01:10] look at jesus's first response
[1:01:14] but he answered her not a word
[1:01:19] i want us to be in this woman's shoes
[1:01:22] for a minute
[1:01:27] she has come
[1:01:29] from the course
[1:01:32] obviously on a mission to fight find
[1:01:34] jesus
[1:01:36] she is begging for mercy
[1:01:39] she acknowledges that he's the son of
[1:01:41] david
[1:01:42] she makes her petition known
[1:01:45] and jesus's first response
[1:01:48] is to not answer her
[1:01:51] i cannot explain why god did that
[1:01:57] but i'm not looking at it from god's
[1:01:59] side because we can't judge him
[1:02:02] we can't assess him
[1:02:04] but we can look at this woman
[1:02:06] because
[1:02:08] sometimes when we approach god it may
[1:02:10] feel like
[1:02:12] here responding
[1:02:15] and if he ever went through a thing and
[1:02:16] said like god are responding here we see
[1:02:18] playing in scripture god a response
[1:02:22] but he answered her not a word
[1:02:26] and his disciples came and besought him
[1:02:30] saying send her away for she cried after
[1:02:33] us
[1:02:34] so i wanted to watch the progression of
[1:02:37] this woman
[1:02:38] so she came and
[1:02:40] cried unto jesus jesus in response so
[1:02:43] she said well guess what
[1:02:45] if jesus is ignoring me i try to i don't
[1:02:48] bother everybody around jesus
[1:02:50] ain't so much because and check this out
[1:02:52] the fact that the disciples
[1:02:54] have to ask jesus to send her away
[1:02:58] one would have to believe that they
[1:03:00] would have tried to tell her oh gosh
[1:03:02] going on
[1:03:04] that attempt obviously failed
[1:03:06] for them to have to come back and say
[1:03:08] jesus is like we telling her to go but
[1:03:10] she no go it's like she'll recognize
[1:03:11] she's not really programmed right now
[1:03:13] that you're not paying any attention and
[1:03:14] she is coming after us
[1:03:19] she would have had to done that in such
[1:03:21] a way
[1:03:23] that it brought a level of frustration
[1:03:25] as it were
[1:03:26] to his disciples that they felt they
[1:03:29] have to come back to jesus with the same
[1:03:30] situation
[1:03:32] so they come back to jesus saying send
[1:03:34] her away for she cried after us
[1:03:38] i want us to understand now
[1:03:41] the buildup of situations in life and in
[1:03:44] this teaching you have a woman who has a
[1:03:46] need a desire a goal a problem or
[1:03:49] situation it is already clear that she
[1:03:51] is relentless
[1:03:53] about getting what she wants
[1:03:56] she has made it a business to find jesus
[1:03:58] she has she knows what she is after she
[1:04:01] knows he could solve the problem
[1:04:03] his first as it were perception or her
[1:04:06] belief that you're ignoring her that
[1:04:08] didn't lead to her
[1:04:11] the disciples telling them you can't
[1:04:14] bother jesus your car bother us go away
[1:04:17] that didn't stop her
[1:04:18] it became so much that they could handle
[1:04:20] it they're going back to the board and
[1:04:22] say boss we have a customer in his store
[1:04:25] we tell her that you're kanye chicassia
[1:04:27] but she said shiago in nowhere can you
[1:04:29] please tell us to leave this store i
[1:04:30] wanted to see this scenario
[1:04:34] the boss i want you to picture it
[1:04:36] imagine you're going to a store you're
[1:04:37] going to talk to the boss the owner in
[1:04:39] store you also look at the aim there you
[1:04:41] go on to all the people the all the
[1:04:42] customer attendants and you're burning
[1:04:44] them until they tell you we cannot serve
[1:04:46] you
[1:04:47] and it becomes so but it's um they're
[1:04:49] going to say boss tell her to leave your
[1:04:51] store please because she not leaving us
[1:04:56] so when they come back to jesus now and
[1:04:58] say listen send our way jesus responds
[1:05:01] for the first time he's had to speak
[1:05:04] but he answered and said i am not sent
[1:05:07] but unto the lost sheep of the house of
[1:05:09] israel in other words
[1:05:12] this woman is here asking for something
[1:05:14] but
[1:05:15] i wasn't sent for her
[1:05:19] she is operating outside of the
[1:05:21] jurisdiction
[1:05:22] that i'm on the portfolio that i'm
[1:05:24] responsible for
[1:05:27] so i want you to see first attempt from
[1:05:30] her jesus ignored her second attempt she
[1:05:33] went to the disciples take on the help
[1:05:35] but they tried to push away
[1:05:37] she know
[1:05:38] verse 25
[1:05:40] but came she and worshipped him
[1:05:45] saying lord help me
[1:05:48] so even after that she asked up him
[1:05:52] but he answered and said it is not meat
[1:05:54] to take the children's bread
[1:05:56] and to cast it to dogs
[1:06:00] now we have preached this many times
[1:06:02] and by the ubid
[1:06:04] would always say
[1:06:06] if it had facebook and twitter and them
[1:06:09] kind of things his tweet is viral is
[1:06:13] what jesus said
[1:06:14] jesus said she's a dog dad
[1:06:25] you become a hashtag it's not a trend
[1:06:33] but she said verse 27.
[1:06:35] now remember talk about the power of
[1:06:37] words
[1:06:39] now i want to bring a contrast between
[1:06:41] hezekiah
[1:06:43] and a contract between this woman
[1:06:45] because this woman wasn't fighting for
[1:06:47] herself oh lord help me tonight
[1:06:50] her need was not her own
[1:06:53] hezekiah's words unlock deliverance for
[1:06:56] him
[1:06:58] this woman the need was not her need
[1:07:04] one of the greatest drivers of human
[1:07:06] behavior is self-preservation
[1:07:10] when you are desperate for something for
[1:07:12] you you will go at length
[1:07:15] to get it because your life
[1:07:18] this woman
[1:07:20] her love for her daughter
[1:07:22] i wanted to catch us tonight was so
[1:07:24] great
[1:07:27] i want you to catch us now so hezekiah's
[1:07:29] words unlock deliverance for him this
[1:07:32] woman was trying to get the key to
[1:07:34] unlock deliverance for her house
[1:07:41] so i want you to know tonight
[1:07:44] that
[1:07:45] you may not even realize that the key to
[1:07:48] helping your home
[1:07:50] may very well lie in your choice of
[1:07:52] words
[1:07:55] tonight going forward
[1:07:58] how you speak to your backseating son
[1:08:00] your daughter
[1:08:02] how you speak and deal with conflict in
[1:08:04] the womb
[1:08:06] i don't have time to go there but a soft
[1:08:08] answer turns away rat
[1:08:11] how you respond to situations could
[1:08:14] unlock doors or close them shut
[1:08:16] permanently
[1:08:19] relationships have broken for years
[1:08:22] because of words
[1:08:24] until people can't even remember what
[1:08:27] the words were but it's still not
[1:08:28] talking
[1:08:31] but what broke the relationship was
[1:08:33] something somebody said that was so
[1:08:36] painful it was worse than a physical
[1:08:39] infliction of pain
[1:08:43] because words can get on the inside
[1:08:45] inside and hurt you more than you can
[1:08:46] even communicate
[1:08:49] the level of pain you feel
[1:08:52] but this woman had a choice
[1:08:55] the love for her daughter
[1:08:57] led her to see beyond the statement
[1:09:00] jesus made
[1:09:04] so in there
[1:09:07] i wanted to catch something is your love
[1:09:09] for your family for your situation for
[1:09:11] your deliverance your desire
[1:09:13] big enough to see beyond the
[1:09:16] tests that god puts in your way and
[1:09:18] situations because she had every right
[1:09:22] after all of the resistance she got to
[1:09:24] say that the last straw
[1:09:27] are going back home
[1:09:31] how do we respond because most of us can
[1:09:33] deal with it
[1:09:34] we read this but most of us cannot deal
[1:09:36] with this
[1:09:39] most of us cannot deal with this
[1:09:41] situation right here we might think we
[1:09:43] could
[1:09:45] because many of us get so upset with
[1:09:47] things people tell us
[1:09:51] not only is what jesus saying to her or
[1:09:55] to from an ultimate somewhat disturbing
[1:09:57] you know but it is who is also saying it
[1:10:03] this is jesus speaking now
[1:10:06] friends
[1:10:08] i am here tonight not to please nobody
[1:10:11] it is very important to me that god is
[1:10:13] pleased
[1:10:16] the only
[1:10:19] only
[1:10:20] check mark i want on my performance on
[1:10:23] my responsibility on coming tonight
[1:10:29] if god says
[1:10:30] this is not what i wanted
[1:10:32] that has an effect
[1:10:35] i don't need man's approval
[1:10:38] god's approval is what matters
[1:10:40] here it is this woman is standing in
[1:10:42] front of jesus
[1:10:44] not her uncle
[1:10:47] not a family member
[1:10:49] not somebody you could take talk from
[1:10:51] when they'd rub off your back
[1:10:53] this is jesus
[1:10:55] who is dealing with her and he says
[1:10:58] it is not fit to take the children's
[1:11:00] bread and casted a dog effectively
[1:11:02] calling her a dog that's a
[1:11:04] perceptually painful situation
[1:11:09] but power of words
[1:11:11] look what she unlocks she said truth
[1:11:13] lord
[1:11:14] truth
[1:11:17] yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which
[1:11:20] fall from their master's table
[1:11:23] then jesus answered and said to her oh
[1:11:25] woman
[1:11:26] that old woman is like just saying oh
[1:11:28] woman you're bullies they're born with
[1:11:30] something when i want oh woman
[1:11:34] oh woman great is thy fate
[1:11:37] be it unto thee even as dog wilt
[1:11:41] and her daughter was made a wall from
[1:11:43] that very hour
[1:11:47] so what unlocked the healing of her
[1:11:49] daughter
[1:11:51] it wasn't prayer
[1:11:56] she
[1:11:57] simply said the right thing
[1:12:03] how different would your life be
[1:12:07] if you really really really work at
[1:12:10] seeing the right thing
[1:12:13] could you reach a level of maturity to
[1:12:16] say the right thing to your neighbor
[1:12:19] the right thing to your brother
[1:12:21] you write thing to your co-worker
[1:12:23] do you write thing to the usher the
[1:12:25] deacon to a believer to the garbage man
[1:12:27] but a branch i respect the garbage man
[1:12:30] it don't matter who it is
[1:12:33] can we as believers practice
[1:12:36] to say the right thing
[1:12:38] let me close over this last
[1:12:41] scripture reading i trust this has
[1:12:42] helped us tonight in some way
[1:12:45] james chapter 3
[1:12:48] and i'm closing out with the scripture
[1:12:49] that led to this whole teaching tonight
[1:12:52] this is really where i've been trying to
[1:12:53] go all night long james after three
[1:12:57] because it really blew my mind when i
[1:12:59] saw how james looked at this
[1:13:03] james 3 and we'll see how far we get
[1:13:04] into this my brethren
[1:13:07] be not
[1:13:09] many masters
[1:13:12] knowing that we shall receive
[1:13:14] the greater condemnation
[1:13:17] and that statement basically means my
[1:13:19] brethren
[1:13:20] don't everybody try to be preachers or
[1:13:23] teachers
[1:13:25] because
[1:13:27] there's great judgment
[1:13:32] if we teach the wrong thing
[1:13:34] that's what james in there
[1:13:36] the judgment that's upon the head of
[1:13:38] preachers
[1:13:40] leaders leadership
[1:13:42] is greater because we have a
[1:13:43] responsibility to fact check
[1:13:46] and make sure it's an alignment what god
[1:13:48] wants so james is reminding my brethren
[1:13:52] don't try to be
[1:13:54] teachers
[1:13:55] knowing
[1:13:57] that we shall receive the greater
[1:13:59] condemnation
[1:14:02] for in many things we offend all
[1:14:07] if any man offend not in word
[1:14:10] the same
[1:14:11] [Music]
[1:14:13] is a perfect man
[1:14:16] and able also to bridle
[1:14:19] the whole body
[1:14:22] i want to read these first two verses in
[1:14:24] the amplified
[1:14:27] not many of you should become teachers
[1:14:30] serving in an official teaching capacity
[1:14:33] my brothers and sisters
[1:14:34] for you know that we who are teachers
[1:14:37] will be judged
[1:14:38] by a higher standard
[1:14:40] because we have assumed
[1:14:42] greater accountability and more
[1:14:45] condemnation if we teach incorrectly
[1:14:49] sobering scripture that one verse
[1:14:52] verse two
[1:14:54] for we all stumble and sin in many ways
[1:14:57] if anyone does not stumble in what he
[1:15:00] says
[1:15:00] never seeing the wrong thing he is a
[1:15:02] perfect man
[1:15:04] fully developed in character without
[1:15:06] serious flaws
[1:15:08] able to bridle his whole body
[1:15:11] and reign in his entire nature taming
[1:15:15] his human faults and weaknesses
[1:15:18] this is worthy friends of reading and
[1:15:20] studying in your own time to let us
[1:15:22] really soak in i don't think i have time
[1:15:24] to do full justice to this because i
[1:15:26] really want to get a certain part that
[1:15:28] james builds into verse 3.
[1:15:31] so james is beginning to build a case
[1:15:34] here
[1:15:35] against what really impacts your life
[1:15:38] your future your destiny your purpose
[1:15:41] your calling on the results
[1:15:43] he said behold we put bits in the
[1:15:46] horse's mouth and if you ever see a
[1:15:48] horse race
[1:15:50] you will see that they will put
[1:15:51] something in the horse's mouth along the
[1:15:53] blinders it's a controlling horse right
[1:15:55] this is not a modern thing this is a
[1:15:58] very old tradition he said behold we put
[1:16:01] bits in the horse's mouth that they may
[1:16:03] obey us
[1:16:05] and return about their whole body
[1:16:09] so james is starting to and you will see
[1:16:11] through scripture jesus used parables
[1:16:14] stories metaphors so james is trying for
[1:16:17] people to see
[1:16:19] a picture of what he's trying to
[1:16:20] describe
[1:16:21] all right
[1:16:23] he says that behold we put bits in the
[1:16:25] horse's mouth that they may obey us and
[1:16:26] return about the whole body so you see
[1:16:28] in this this small bit
[1:16:31] that is placing a horse's mouth the
[1:16:34] control of that bit is actually
[1:16:36] controlling the entire horse everybody
[1:16:38] with me
[1:16:39] verse 4
[1:16:40] behold also the ships
[1:16:44] which though
[1:16:45] they be so great and are driven of
[1:16:49] fierce wins
[1:16:51] yet they are turned about with a very
[1:16:54] small helm
[1:16:57] whether so ever the governor listed
[1:17:00] all right so that helm is what we call a
[1:17:03] rudder in a ship it's almost the
[1:17:06] smallest moving machinery part of the
[1:17:08] ship
[1:17:09] so let's read that in the mp5 and look
[1:17:11] at the ships even though they are so
[1:17:13] large
[1:17:14] and are driven by strong winds
[1:17:16] they are still directed by a very small
[1:17:19] rider wherever the impulse of the
[1:17:22] helmsman or the captain determines
[1:17:27] verse five now let's get to this now
[1:17:30] even so the tongue
[1:17:32] is a little member
[1:17:35] and boasted great things
[1:17:39] behold how great a matter a little
[1:17:43] fire timberland
[1:17:47] verse six
[1:17:52] and the tongue is a fire
[1:17:54] a world of iniquity
[1:17:57] so is the tongue among our members that
[1:18:01] it defiled the whole body
[1:18:05] and set it on fire the course of nature
[1:18:09] and it is set on fire of hell
[1:18:13] so i want to nail down
[1:18:16] james takes them through a journey in
[1:18:18] this message saying listen you see how a
[1:18:20] small bit on a horse can move the whole
[1:18:22] house the whole house
[1:18:24] how this small rather than a ship no
[1:18:26] matter how big the ship is the ship can
[1:18:28] take wind fierce winds but that small
[1:18:31] radar could turn the entire ship it
[1:18:33] could be a big ship a ship of iron a
[1:18:36] ship
[1:18:36] [Music]
[1:18:37] a black ship a blue ship it a dramatic
[1:18:39] color bishop it don't matter who on this
[1:18:41] ship
[1:18:42] wants who in control are the rudder and
[1:18:44] control leadership
[1:18:46] it can be a ship of poor people a ship
[1:18:48] or rich people the same rudder
[1:18:51] control the ship no matter what kind of
[1:18:53] ship it is the same way
[1:18:56] who you are as a person
[1:18:59] the rudder of your life
[1:19:01] the bit of your life
[1:19:03] is your tongue
[1:19:07] that's real serious
[1:19:16] let's go on
[1:19:19] verse seven for every kind of beast and
[1:19:22] of birds and of serpents and of things
[1:19:24] in the sea is steamed and hath been
[1:19:26] tamed of mankind
[1:19:31] so in the amplified i want to read this
[1:19:33] by the ambulance i just said nailed this
[1:19:34] down
[1:19:37] we read it uh
[1:19:38] from who is five in the amplified in the
[1:19:40] same sense the tongue is a small part of
[1:19:42] the body and yet it boasts a great thing
[1:19:45] see by comparison
[1:19:47] how great a forest is set on fire by a
[1:19:49] small spark
[1:19:51] so james is saying a small spark that
[1:19:53] could burn in a whole forest is like
[1:19:55] tongue the impact of the tongue on your
[1:19:57] body and on your life
[1:19:59] and the tongue is in in a sense of fire
[1:20:02] the very world of on injustice and
[1:20:05] unrighteousness this the tongue is set
[1:20:08] among our members as that which
[1:20:10] contaminates the entire body and sets on
[1:20:14] fire the course of our life the cycle of
[1:20:18] man's existence and is itself set on
[1:20:22] fire by hell
[1:20:23] and now he goes on into verse seven
[1:20:26] for every kind of beast and of birds and
[1:20:29] of serpents and of things in the sea is
[1:20:31] steamed and have been teamed up mankind
[1:20:34] so you're saying man has been able to
[1:20:36] tame everything we have been able to
[1:20:37] build skyscrapers put animals and cages
[1:20:40] we've been able to do what we want with
[1:20:42] the planet but it was it but the tongue
[1:20:45] can no man team
[1:20:48] man could team lion mankind could do all
[1:20:50] can go underwater build submarines do
[1:20:53] all kinds of different things but the
[1:20:55] tonka no man team it is an unruly evil
[1:20:59] full of deadly poison
[1:21:03] you see how we build now into into ready
[1:21:05] nailing this thing now
[1:21:07] how powerful your tongues are
[1:21:11] we almost done
[1:21:14] they're wet in other words with this
[1:21:16] same tongue
[1:21:19] we bless
[1:21:21] god even the father
[1:21:24] and dare with
[1:21:25] curse we men
[1:21:27] which are made after the simult of god
[1:21:32] in the amplified it says with it we
[1:21:34] bless our lord and father and with it
[1:21:36] because men who are made in the likeness
[1:21:38] of god with this same tongue
[1:21:42] with this same tongue depending on the
[1:21:44] day we meet you you're telling me god
[1:21:46] bless you see him tongue and he never
[1:21:47] been any bad day said i will talk to you
[1:21:49] you know
[1:21:50] same time
[1:21:54] james goes on he nailing his dung
[1:21:56] he said out of the same mouth
[1:21:58] proceeded blessing and cursing
[1:22:01] and then he challenged and said my
[1:22:03] bridging these things ought not so to be
[1:22:09] so church
[1:22:11] these things
[1:22:13] are not so to be
[1:22:19] in the amplified this verse 10 says out
[1:22:21] of the same amount come both blessing
[1:22:23] and kissing these things my brothers
[1:22:26] should not be this way for we have a
[1:22:29] moral obligation to speak in a manner
[1:22:33] that reflects our fear of god and
[1:22:36] profound respect for his precepts
[1:22:40] hallelujah
[1:22:46] almost done verse 11
[1:22:48] that a fountain sent fought at the same
[1:22:50] place sweet water and bitter
[1:22:53] he said when when he got the fountain
[1:22:55] again sweet and bitter water you say
[1:22:57] that that that that don't make sense
[1:23:00] can the fig tree my bedroom be olive
[1:23:03] berries
[1:23:05] could a mango tree bear orange
[1:23:08] either a vine figs
[1:23:09] so can no fountain brought you salt
[1:23:12] water and fresh water
[1:23:17] anybody with
[1:23:18] me verse 13
[1:23:21] who is a wise man and endured with
[1:23:23] knowledge among you
[1:23:25] let him show out of a good conversation
[1:23:28] his works with meekness
[1:23:31] of wisdom
[1:23:32] and i'll end there
[1:23:34] tonight
[1:23:35] may the lord have a blessing to the
[1:23:37] reading of his word
[1:23:38] i trust that tonight
[1:23:40] we can take another look
[1:23:43] at how we speak what we see the words we
[1:23:46] use our choice of words if you don't
[1:23:48] have nothing good to say don't say
[1:23:49] anything
[1:23:50] but the bible says see something kind
[1:23:51] something nice something loyal
[1:23:54] we need to be very careful
[1:23:57] with this
[1:23:58] weapon of a tongue
[1:24:00] because if we use it in the wrong way
[1:24:02] not only do we bring destruction to our
[1:24:04] homes we bring destruction to our souls
[1:24:07] but
[1:24:08] if we use it the right way
[1:24:10] and find the key to unlock situations in
[1:24:12] our lives and to open the doors then we
[1:24:14] could truly be blessed and rewarded for
[1:24:17] seeing the right thing can we bow our
[1:24:19] heads up with a friend
[1:24:21] our heavenly father lord a little
[1:24:24] teaching tonight lord on this subject of
[1:24:27] the power of
[1:24:29] our words
[1:24:30] power of our words
[1:24:32] lord to see how you were able to speak
[1:24:35] let there be let there be let there be
[1:24:39] lord even when you walked in the earth
[1:24:41] and say lazarus come forth it took the
[1:24:44] spoken word
[1:24:46] to create
[1:24:47] it took the spoken word to resurrect
[1:24:51] it took the spoken word to bring life
[1:24:56] lord you spoke so many times here on
[1:24:58] earth
[1:25:00] to bring healing
[1:25:02] to cast out devils
[1:25:05] lord and through this great message of
[1:25:06] the hour
[1:25:08] lord we are back to the spoken word
[1:25:10] again

[1:25:14] lord when they said it's not this
[1:25:15] joseph's son they were marveling at the
[1:25:18] gracious words the way you spoke
[1:25:21] was different from how other people
[1:25:23] spoke
[1:25:24] and we too must be different
[1:25:27] as believers as sons and daughters of
[1:25:29] the living god we have to speak like the
[1:25:32] royalty that we are walking into

[1:25:38] of the living god
[1:25:39] knowing that we can speak life
[1:25:42] lord even when you were here you
[1:25:44] demonstrated
[1:25:46] the power of your words when you were
[1:25:48] hungry
[1:25:49] and you went to the fig tree
[1:25:52] and you look for food and there was no
[1:25:54] food there
[1:25:56] lord and you cursed that tree and said
[1:25:58] no man eat from thee
[1:26:00] right there demonstrating that with the
[1:26:02] word
[1:26:03] lord you could heal
[1:26:05] and you could shut down
[1:26:07] that tree dried up right there
