[18:12] with your peace.
[18:15] Thank you, Jesus. Are you happy to be in
[18:17] the house of the Lord tonight?
[18:19] Amen.
[18:21] Is this privilege have we saints? God
[18:25] bless you. Bless you. Let's turn to our
[18:27] Bibles in the Psalms.
[18:31] Amen.
[18:33] All right.
[18:36] Psalms 23.
[18:38] Let's turn to that one.
[18:41] And we know it.
[18:44] Psalms 23
[18:47] says, "The Lord is my shepherd.
[18:50] I shall not want.
[18:52] He maketh me to lie down in green
[18:54] pastures.
[18:56] He leadth me beside the still waters.
[19:00] He restoreth my soul.
[19:03] He leadth me in the paths of
[19:05] righteousness for his name's sake.
[19:08] Yay, though I walk through the valley of
[19:11] the shadow of death, I will fear no
[19:14] evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and
[19:18] thy staff, they comfort me. Thou
[19:21] preparest a table before me in the
[19:24] presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest
[19:27] my head with oil. My cup runth over.
[19:32] Surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[19:36] me all the days of my life and I will
[19:38] dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[19:41] May God add blessing to the reading of
[19:43] his word. Let us bow our heads and pray
[19:47] tonight.
[19:49] Heavenly Father, we thank you to be in
[19:52] your hands, Lord Jesus. You are our
[19:55] shepherd tonight, Lord. You are our
[19:58] leader, Lord. You are our guide. You are
[20:01] the one who has brought us this far,
[20:02] Lord. And you have been faithful, oh

[20:07] be faithful to the end, Lord. We put our
[20:10] lives in thee this evening, Lord. We put
[20:13] our trust in you tonight, dear God, that
[20:15] you will continue to guide us and lead
[20:17] us in goodness and truth, Lord. Father,
[20:20] may your Holy Spirit come down here in a
[20:22] mighty way tonight, Lord, as we assemble
[20:24] ourselves together as we present
[20:27] ourselves before your presence, Lord
[20:29] Jesus. Cover us under your precious
[20:31] blood. Forgive us our trespasses, Lord,
[20:34] and bless us and deliver us, Father.

[20:44] to supply our every need according to
[20:47] your riches in glory.
[20:49] May you pour out in a special way here
[20:50] tonight. Lord, bless your servant as he
[20:53] would prepare himself to be led of the
[20:55] Holy Spirit. May you use his words,
[20:57] Lord, Father, our ministry, dear, God,
[21:00] tonight. Minister to our souls, Lord,
[21:03] uh as the word of God is preached,
[21:04] Father. May your spirit come and anoint
[21:06] us, raise us up, Lord, for such a time
[21:10] as this. We commit this service into
[21:12] your hands tonight. We pray that your
[21:14] Holy Spirit would have its perfect way
[21:16] in Jesus Christ's precious name. Amen.
[21:19] And amen. Praise God. Why don't you just

[35:08] Oh, God only knows.
[35:13] And glad you see
[35:17] through eyes of love.
[35:21] I was a hopeless pain.
[35:30] If not for grace. I just sing it one

[35:34] over this place. Where would I be?
[35:38] Oh, God only knows.
[35:43] I'm glad you see

[36:19] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord tonight.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; You're glad to be here.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. While you're standing, if you
[36:26] could open your Bibles
[36:30] to a short portion of scripture,
[36:36] reading from the book of Acts, chapter
[36:38] 2, verse 38.
[36:45] Thank you, musicians.
[36:49] And it says, "Then Peter said unto them,
[36:52] repent and be baptized every one of you
[36:54] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[36:55] remission of sins, and ye shall receive
[36:58] the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the
[37:00] promise is unto you and to your
[37:02] children, and to all that are far off,
[37:05] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[37:07] call."
[37:09] you just bow our heads as we open on a
[37:11] word of prayer. Oh heavenly father, we
[37:14] thank you so much for this opportunity
[37:16] to gather together this evening, Lord.
[37:18] Lord, we pray that you will have your
[37:21] perfect will over this service, every
[37:23] word that is spoken, Lord. Lord, every
[37:26] thought that is shared, Lord, I pray
[37:27] that you would speak lip to air to your
[37:29] people tonight. I pray that you'll
[37:31] anoint my words, Lord. An anoint this
[37:34] message tonight, Lord. take me out of
[37:36] the way and Lord meet the needs of your
[37:38] people wherever they are Lord. Those
[37:40] connected on the internet, I pray that
[37:42] you give them a special touch that your
[37:44] presence would pour among your people,
[37:46] Lord. That lives be changed and
[37:48] transformed that the sick will be
[37:49] healed, Lord, and the the the the bound
[37:51] will be set free, Lord. Lord, that
[37:53] shackles will be broken tonight, Lord.
[37:56] Lord, I pray that you have your perfect
[37:57] will in and through our lives. Bless the
[38:00] reading of your word, Lord. Lord, I pray
[38:02] that you would open it to our hearts,
[38:03] Lord. Lord, I pray that you would Lord,
[38:05] just anoint our minds, our bodies, our
[38:08] souls, Lord, so we could receive from
[38:10] you tonight. In Jesus name we pray.
[38:12] Amen.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; You may have your seats.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a time we've had in his
[38:18] presence.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Coming out of the convention and and the
[38:22] services we've had, who was blessed by
[38:24] the service on Sunday?
[38:27] &gt;&gt; What a message.
[38:31] Amen. Amen. And this evening just for a
[38:34] title uh your response to the call for
[38:38] an inspiration will you be ready?
[38:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; So we're going to chat a little bit
[38:43] tonight about your response to the call.
[38:46] As we
[38:47] read that scripture there
[38:51] and in verse 39 of Acts chapter 2, it
[38:55] says, "For the promise is unto you and
[38:58] to your children."
[38:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. and to all that are far off, even
[39:02] as many as the Lord our God shall call.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; So, one thing is clear there that God is
[39:10] calling you.
[39:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; But he isn't now calling you
[39:14] &gt;&gt; because he chose you before the
[39:15] foundation of the world.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; It says, "Moreover, whom he did
[39:19] predestinate, then he also called."
[39:22] &gt;&gt; And whom he called, them he also
[39:24] justified. And whom he justified, them
[39:27] he also glorified. So, he's calling
[39:29] tonight.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; He's called you before the foundation of
[39:32] the world, but he's sending you a
[39:34] reminder tonight
[39:35] &gt;&gt; about his purpose for your life.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; He calls when he's ready to call.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:43] &gt;&gt; He doesn't always call the way you
[39:45] expect him to. He doesn't call because
[39:47] you think it's convenient for him to do
[39:49] so. But he doesn't have to wait until
[39:52] you're ready.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; He calls because he wants to.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he could call whoever he want,
[39:58] &gt;&gt; how he want, when he want, where he
[40:01] want.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; You don't dictate the ability of him to
[40:05] call you.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. If that was the case, Lazarus
[40:08] would not have died.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Because they reach out to him and he
[40:11] said, you know what? I will still carry
[40:13] a little bit.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; Your call is not going to pull him.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; Your faith can,
[40:21] &gt;&gt; but he will come when he's ready. When
[40:24] he's ready to show up and respond, he
[40:26] will come and call upon you.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you hear me tonight,
[40:32] &gt;&gt; but the main line to Jesus is always
[40:34] active.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; You could call him anytime, but it's up
[40:38] to him to respond.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; You could reach out any time, but it's
[40:42] up to him to respond to you.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; You could cry out to him anytime,
[40:46] &gt;&gt; but it's his prerogative to respond. The
[40:49] children of Israel were in bondage for
[40:50] 400 years.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; All right.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; They cried.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; Yes. They pleaded. Yes.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; They sacrificed. They fasted. They
[40:57] prayed.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; He heard them, you know,
[41:01] &gt;&gt; but he chose when he wanted to respond
[41:03] to that call.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; And tonight, he's calling you. And it's
[41:07] important that you respond to his call
[41:09] &gt;&gt; because it's on his terms.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; It's not because of us,
[41:13] &gt;&gt; but we are obligated to respond to him.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:19] From time to time, your call might drop
[41:22] because your faith might waver a little
[41:24] bit.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Your relationship might be a little
[41:26] shaky
[41:28] &gt;&gt; and it seems as if he not hearing you.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; The problem is not him.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; The problem is you.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; The problem is your connection.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; His line is always working.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; He don't need to top it up.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; Trust me. He's moving here, moving
[41:44] there, moving just about everywhere.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; Your faith could pull him tonight.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; Your faith could ensure that you are
[41:52] healed tonight,
[41:53] &gt;&gt; that you are set free tonight, that you
[41:55] are delivered tonight.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; His line is always active.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:03] So sometimes it feels like you're not
[42:05] getting through. But the secret is
[42:09] he is never too busy. You know,
[42:12] &gt;&gt; but he is going to answer when he's
[42:14] ready.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; It's not on us. It's on him.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; Once you mix that word, once you mix
[42:22] those promises with not faith, he will
[42:25] answer.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; He will respond.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; In a message, why Christ speak? Brother
[42:31] Brandham said, like I've taught many
[42:32] times
[42:33] &gt;&gt; of the little woman at the well, and we
[42:34] know the story.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; She was a woman of what we call
[42:37] illreute.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; She had five men and the man she was
[42:42] living with wasn't hers. We call her a
[42:44] prostitute. You don't want to be
[42:46] associated with her. You don't want to
[42:48] be seen in public with her.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; You don't want to talk to her. You don't
[42:51] want to go to the well at the same time
[42:53] as she is going because that is what she
[42:56] expressed. That's what the public knew.
[42:59] That's what the world knew. That's what
[43:00] the world saw.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; But the interesting thing about her is
[43:05] that when the light first struck her
[43:09] when this call went out to her quickly
[43:11] she recognized it cuz there was
[43:14] something there to respond to it. When
[43:17] the deep call it to a deep, there must
[43:19] be a deep somewhere to respond.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; So it doesn't matter what people think
[43:23] about you tonight. It doesn't matter
[43:26] where you were last week. When he's
[43:28] calling you, it's up to you to respond.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; Your response is important to him.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Your response causes things to happen.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what your siblings
[43:38] think and your family think and and and
[43:40] your neighbor and your coworker and your
[43:42] boss.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; The way you respond dictates the way he
[43:46] operates with you.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If he could use you,
[43:49] &gt;&gt; if he could fill you, if he could
[43:51] deliver you tonight, if he could heal
[43:52] you today
[43:54] &gt;&gt; based on your response to his call.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; He likes to come and call you when you
[44:01] least expect it.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; I told you it's not on your terms, it's
[44:04] on his terms.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; He likes to interrupt normal living.
[44:09] You know, you go to work and you go back
[44:10] home and you go to church and you go
[44:11] back home and you check your friends and
[44:13] you go back home and you check your
[44:14] family and go back home and it seems
[44:16] normal and routine, part of your
[44:18] culture, part of who you are. He likes
[44:20] to interrupt that.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; So at times he just observes. Oh, okay.
[44:24] I understand. I understand your
[44:25] movements. I want to interrupt that.
[44:28] Like Moses with the burning bush, normal
[44:30] living, but he interrupted it.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Paul normal living
[44:35] &gt;&gt; persecute the Christians is his mission.
[44:37] interrupted.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; And there are many cases throughout
[44:40] scripture where people have been living
[44:44] their lives in a level of normaly
[44:48] and he chooses to interrupt it
[44:51] &gt;&gt; for his cause.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; In the book of Luke, he said they eat,
[44:55] they drank, they married wives, they
[44:56] were given in marriage until the day
[44:58] that Noah entered into the ark, the
[45:01] flood came. So he built the ark and when
[45:03] God called him and say, "Come inside
[45:05] now.
[45:07] That That was it.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; That was it.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; It didn't matter what you thought about
[45:12] him. If you're finally preaching the
[45:14] same thing for 120 years, it really
[45:16] didn't matter at that point.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; It seemed like everything was going
[45:20] routine.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; It was the thing that we are accustomed
[45:24] to. You come to church on Wednesday
[45:25] night and you go back home. Even tonight
[45:27] may seem like a average standard
[45:29] Wednesday night,
[45:30] &gt;&gt; but it's not
[45:32] &gt;&gt; because he likes to come and show up
[45:34] when it seems normal.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; He likes to come calling and knocking
[45:38] when it seems like he's least likely to
[45:41] do that. As a matter of fact, it goes on
[45:43] in verse 28 and says, "Likewise also as
[45:45] it was in the day of Lot. They eat, they
[45:48] drank, they bought, they sold, they
[45:50] planted, they build it. But the day that
[45:52] Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire
[45:54] and brimstone from heaven and destroyed
[45:56] them all.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Essentially, the day that Lot was called
[45:59] out
[46:01] &gt;&gt; and he responded to that call,
[46:03] destruction
[46:05] &gt;&gt; covered the city.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; So, it was important to be able to
[46:10] respond to that call.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; Now, when God called Lot out, as we
[46:14] know,
[46:15] &gt;&gt; his wife was not ready for the call.
[46:17] That's right.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; This is isn't about about Samson, but it
[46:21] wasn't once more, Lord. She just wanted
[46:24] one more party.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Just one more fet.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Just one more good time. Just one more
[46:31] lime.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Just one more encounter with these
[46:35] friends that she knows she shouldn't be
[46:36] lying with.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Ju just one more.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; And it cost her everything. Amen.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; That one more
[46:43] &gt;&gt; that one more
[46:45] &gt;&gt; decision to go out.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; That one more was what it took to divide
[46:50] her from
[46:52] what God had appointed for Lot at that
[46:54] point.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; You know there are people when you drop
[47:01] by them unexpectedly,
[47:04] it's a scary thing for them. shakes them
[47:06] to the very core because they will do
[47:08] everything in their power to delay you.
[47:11] They will tell you, "Hold on, wait right
[47:14] outside. I'm coming." And that is
[47:16] because they want to back up. They want
[47:18] to sort out. They want to clean up. They
[47:21] want to tidy up. They want to put things
[47:23] in the position in which it's supposed
[47:25] to be because they want to make sure
[47:27] that when you walk through that door.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; The impression they give you is that
[47:31] everything is all right,
[47:32] &gt;&gt; that everything is in place, that
[47:34] everything is perfect.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you, and it's no
[47:38] surprise that God doesn't operate that
[47:41] way.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; He wants you to be ready whenever he
[47:46] comes.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; You must always be ready.
[47:51] He will stand at the door and knock. But
[47:53] you know what? He not standing there
[47:55] forever. You know
[47:55] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; He's a gentleman.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; He knock and you waiting and then he
[48:00] gone.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; If you don't respond fast enough, he
[48:03] gone.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; You would have missed it.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; That's just the way he is.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; He say his thoughts are higher than our
[48:12] thoughts.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; His way is higher than our ways. So, you
[48:15] may not have the opportunity to to get
[48:17] it right because you procrastinated.
[48:20] Guess what? Next week, I will have it in
[48:23] order. Don't come yet. Come in two weeks
[48:26] time because I'll sort it out.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; He want you ready tonight.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; He want you ready now cuz he could come
[48:34] anytime.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; In a message, Christ knocking at the
[48:37] door. Here, here's what it says in
[48:38] paragraph 27. And when Jesus comes, he
[48:41] wants to be welcome.
[48:44] But we've got little secret doors,
[48:45] little bitty doors in our heart and we
[48:47] don't want Jesus in. Over to the right
[48:49] hand side of the human heart after Jesus
[48:52] gets in, there's a little door called
[48:53] pride. Oh, I will receiving a savior.
[48:56] But don't you try to tell me the way I
[48:58] should dress
[48:59] &gt;&gt; the way I have to do. Oh, if I let if I
[49:02] have to let my hair grow out, if I have
[49:03] to stop smoking cigarettes or quit going
[49:05] down to the pool room, I don't want
[49:06] nothing to do with it. Don't worry, he
[49:08] won't stay long.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; He's not welcome there. Amen. Amen.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; He's not interested in staying long
[49:14] there.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; There's another another not a little
[49:16] hard door in there called your own
[49:17] private life.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; You don't want nobody dillydallying with
[49:20] that. I live my life. I do this that or
[49:23] the other, but nobody's business what I
[49:25] do. Haven't you heard that old proverb?
[49:27] But I tell you, you are not your own.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; You are bought with a price and you
[49:32] belong to God.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; You have no right to your own property.
[49:35] God should know everything. And he does
[49:37] know everything that you do. and he
[49:39] should have the right to that door. And
[49:41] there's another door in there. It's a
[49:42] door called faith. Oh, that is quite a
[49:45] door. Now look, I've accepted Jesus as
[49:48] my savior, but I don't believe that the
[49:50] days of miracles are today. I just can't
[49:52] believe it. He wants to get in that
[49:54] door. If he could ever open that door
[49:56] and stand there as Lord, brother, you'll
[49:58] believe every word God wrote in his
[50:00] book. But how you going to do it when
[50:03] you got some kind of a church laws
[50:05] tacked up on the door? Stay away, Jesus.
[50:07] Don't you try to tell me of that old
[50:09] stuff that you're the same yesterday,
[50:11] today, and forever. You could stand
[50:13] there. I don't want to go to hell. I
[50:15] want to be popular in church, but you
[50:18] can't control me because I know better.
[50:20] I'm a scientist.
[50:23] So it is with people today in which they
[50:26] try to compartmentalize Christianity.
[50:28] Amen.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; They try to separate the Sunday church
[50:32] life from the rest of their natural
[50:34] life.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; As if God judges you on a Sunday.
[50:40] This is a everyday
[50:42] yesterday, today, and forever. God
[50:45] &gt;&gt; that not changing
[50:47] across the board. He want to monitor you
[50:49] across the board. He knows across the
[50:52] board. He sees and he wants you to be
[50:55] ready. So when he calls, you could
[50:57] respond appropriately. You could respond
[51:00] accordingly. You could respond the way
[51:01] he expect you to respond.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; Just to shift gears a little bit, I want
[51:06] to say age is no excuse.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; This is not a message for adults.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; This is not speaking to to to seniors or
[51:14] children or anybody in particular
[51:16] because there's a little guy called
[51:18] Samuel. He was a child in Samuel chapter
[51:21] 3.
[51:23] The Lord called him once.
[51:26] He said, "Here am I." He thought Eli
[51:27] call him. We know the story. Call him a
[51:30] second time. He said, "Eli, assures you
[51:33] this time, cuz I hear your call, man."
[51:36] Eli said, "No, go and lie down again."
[51:39] When he heard it the third time, he say,
[51:41] "This is how I want you to respond."
[51:46] And with that he say
[51:49] he perceived that God was speaking to
[51:51] him. Eli perceived that God was speaking
[51:54] to Samuel.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; He said unto Samuel in verse 9, "Go lie
[52:00] down, and it shall be." If he call thee,
[52:02] that thou shalt say, "Speak, Lord, for
[52:04] thy servant heareth."
[52:06] &gt;&gt; So Samuel went and lay down in his
[52:08] place. And the Lord came and stood and
[52:10] called at other times. Samuel, Samuel.
[52:13] Then Samuel answered, "Speak for thy
[52:16] servant hear it."
[52:19] &gt;&gt; No wonder the Bible said, "Train up a
[52:21] child
[52:22] &gt;&gt; in the way that he must go.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; When he grows up, he wouldn't depart
[52:25] from it."
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Because they need to know the voice,
[52:28] too.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; They need to know what the prophet voice
[52:31] sound like.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; They need to know what the voice of God
[52:34] sound like because they have parents who
[52:36] knows what it sounds like. They know
[52:38] parents who know the promises, who knows
[52:40] the word
[52:42] &gt;&gt; and could teach them
[52:44] &gt;&gt; godly and Christian ways.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we have our part to play. We
[52:48] have a responsibility so they could
[52:50] respond accordingly.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; You know in a message Kingsman Redeemer
[52:58] speaking about Ruth
[53:00] paragraph 83 it says when I accepted
[53:03] Christ I was turned out of my own home.
[53:06] When I accepted Christ, my boyfriend,
[53:08] girlfriend, everybody throwed me down.
[53:10] Went down to a bunch of old people that
[53:12] had the Holy Spirit and believed in God
[53:14] serving him. The girls that were down
[53:16] there in that church were different than
[53:18] the girls I'd been going with. They look
[53:20] different.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; They acted different.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; They were strange
[53:25] &gt;&gt; and I was scared of them.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; They were different people. You see,
[53:30] that's what Ruth had to do. When God
[53:32] calls, you have a choice to make.
[53:35] God don't force you.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; He allow you to decide what you want.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; So he will call you and it's up to you
[53:42] to say yes Lord. Here I am.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; I'm available to be used by you
[53:47] &gt;&gt; or Lord I'm not ready. I don't want
[53:48] this. I going the next direction.
[53:52] In Ruth's case
[53:55] she had to come from her own to another
[53:57] people.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; She was converted. She made a decision.
[54:01] And you make a decision. You got to take
[54:03] your choice. You want to go back to the
[54:05] things of the world or you want to go on
[54:07] with God. Do you want to act like the
[54:09] world and the rest of them? Then kiss
[54:11] God goodbye and go back. But if you want
[54:14] to take your way with the Lord's
[54:16] despised few, hold on to God's
[54:17] unchanging hand. Regardless of what the
[54:20] world the rest of the world says, you
[54:22] hold right there. God said so. It's
[54:25] true.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; I believe it. though I can't make it
[54:31] manifest in my life. God said so. So I
[54:33] believe it. I hold right there. That's
[54:36] the way she did to Naomi. She said,
[54:39] "I'll not leave you. I'll go where you
[54:41] go. Your people will be my people. What
[54:43] they eat, I will eat. Where you die, I
[54:45] die. Where you buried, I'll be buried."
[54:47] So she identified with that call.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; That call of separation from the past,
[54:54] from traditions, from culture, from
[54:57] comfort, from what she knew. She
[54:59] realized, listen, this is the way I have
[55:01] to go. If I have to see change in my
[55:03] life, if I have to see the blessings of
[55:05] the Lord, if I have to press forward and
[55:08] the Lord do more to me if I fail
[55:10] anywhere, that's a real cleancut
[55:12] decision. God wants cleancut decisions
[55:14] out of his church. Not a decision, well,
[55:17] Lord, if you just bless me, God not in
[55:19] the negotiation business, you know, he
[55:21] really isn't. Lord, if you bless me
[55:25] and do this for me, I'll do so and so.
[55:29] If you if you give me a job, if you give
[55:31] him a promotion, then perhaps I'll start
[55:33] to come every Sunday.
[55:35] He don't have time with that. You know,
[55:38] &gt;&gt; he operates the way he wants,
[55:40] &gt;&gt; the way he chooses, the way he allows.
[55:45] You see how Ruth operated? She say,
[55:47] "I'll go anyhow. If I die, all right,
[55:50] live or die, whatever it is." If they
[55:52] laugh at me, make fun of me, don't
[55:53] doesn't make any difference. I'll go
[55:55] anyhow. That kind of cleancut decision
[55:57] like like Rebecca and we heard it on
[55:59] Sunday. When Eleazar was challenged to
[56:03] get a bride for Isaac,
[56:06] he got desperate.
[56:08] He went and prayed and he said, "Lord,
[56:10] here what the damsel at water camel and
[56:12] give me water. That one is the one." All
[56:15] right.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; So he had this burden on his heart to
[56:18] ensure that he found the right type of
[56:21] bride for his master.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; He went out and he stood there and he
[56:26] waited
[56:28] perhaps patiently looking as people came
[56:31] and went. And it may have seemed like
[56:33] the normal thing to do. Don't talk to
[56:35] strangers. Don't operate a particular
[56:38] way. But not Rebecca.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Rebecca had a special call. Amen.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; She had a special assignment.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; She was predestinated to be part of the
[56:48] bloodline of Jesus.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; So when she came and she saw him,
[56:52] &gt;&gt; she offered,
[56:54] &gt;&gt; she didn't have to be prompted.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; That was part of her DNA.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; She was accustomed helping
[57:00] &gt;&gt; going the extra mile.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; So she offered him
[57:04] &gt;&gt; the camel and went on.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; But something struck me when I looked at
[57:10] it. Eleazar when he was convinced that
[57:14] this was the one, he said, "You know
[57:16] what? Don't delay. Let's make haste and
[57:19] go back. Let's wrap this thing up and
[57:22] move."
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Let's make this thing a reality quick.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; In the scripture in Genesis 24, they
[57:30] said, "Behold, Rebecca is before thee.
[57:33] Take her and go. Let her be thy master
[57:35] son wife, as the Lord has spoken. And it
[57:38] came to pass that when Abraham's servant
[57:39] heard their words, he worshiped the
[57:41] Lord, bowing himself to the earth. And
[57:44] guess what? The servant brought forth
[57:47] jewels of silver like a dory
[57:50] jewels of gold and rain. Give them to
[57:54] Rebecca. He gave also to her brother. So
[57:58] not only Rebecca was getting blessed,
[58:00] her brother got and to her mother
[58:03] precious things.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; So everybody get handled. Rebecca
[58:07] herself, her brother, and her mother.
[58:11] As if that wasn't good enough, they did
[58:14] eat and drink. So, they're having a good
[58:16] old line, a good old party. He and the
[58:19] men that were with him. So, it wasn't a
[58:22] one-man show. They had this thing, luck,
[58:25] gifts, precious gold, silver, precious
[58:29] things to family. We were determined. We
[58:32] prayed before this was it. But you see
[58:35] all that I mentioned there,
[58:38] if that happened to you and I, you say
[58:40] hallelujah.
[58:42] This is God working it out. Favor, man.
[58:46] But you know what he had to face after
[58:48] that? Resistance.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; The same way bright skies and as a sign
[58:55] of God's approval. It doesn't negate the
[58:58] fact that resistance will come.
[59:00] Resistance might come. It may come. So
[59:03] you have to prepare for it.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; You have to be prepared to handle it, to
[59:07] see obstacles and hurdles and overcome
[59:09] them.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; So after all that we mentioned there
[59:14] her brother and mother said let the
[59:15] damsel abide with us a few days at least
[59:19] 10 and after that she shall go. So after
[59:22] the gifts, after the meals, after the
[59:25] food, after the precious things, she
[59:28] still decide, you know what? Let her
[59:30] stay back with us a little bit more, a
[59:32] little week and a half,
[59:33] &gt;&gt; a week and a half extra. This is our
[59:36] daughter going out.
[59:39] And at that time, Eleazar said, "Listen,
[59:42] hinder me not seeing the Lord has
[59:45] prospered my way.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; He has come and he showed me. I prayed
[59:49] and he told me listen the one that water
[59:52] the camel and myself that's the one
[59:55] assure are convinced are ready to move
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; and they still said we will call the
[1:00:02] damsel and inquire at her mouth in
[1:00:05] essence let's allow her to decide
[1:00:09] whether or not she want to go now or she
[1:00:11] want to go lateral
[1:00:13] and they called Rebecca and said unto
[1:00:15] her will thou go with this man and she
[1:00:18] said I will go.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; And they sent away Rebecca, their
[1:00:24] sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's
[1:00:26] servant and his men. Now, what she
[1:00:28] essentially did is say, "Listen, I know
[1:00:30] I have history here. I have family here.
[1:00:33] I have traditions. I have culture. But I
[1:00:36] want to be identified with somebody I
[1:00:38] don't know. with a little group that
[1:00:40] that preaching thunders with a little
[1:00:43] group that that say they have a open
[1:00:45] book and that say they have a revelation
[1:00:47] and they had a prophet I would prefer to
[1:00:49] be identified with that and by faith are
[1:00:51] willing to move
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; that is what she's telling them you know
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; she is saying listen at this point I
[1:00:58] prefer to do that
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; and they blessed Rebecca and said unto
[1:01:01] her thou art our sister
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; be thou the mother of thousands of
[1:01:05] millions and let thy seed possess the
[1:01:07] gates of those which hate them.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; And Rebecca arose and her damsels and
[1:01:12] they rode upon the camels. The same
[1:01:14] camels followed the man and servant. The
[1:01:17] servant took Rebecca and went his way.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Now at the end of the day,
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; God got the glory.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; At the end of the day, Isaac got his
[1:01:28] bride.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Eleazar was successful on his mission,
[1:01:31] but it had resistance.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Today and tomorrow, your life will have
[1:01:36] resistance. And resistance shows up in
[1:01:39] different forms in various forms.
[1:01:41] Sometimes resistance is your own family.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Sometime resistance is your friends,
[1:01:46] your colleagues, your co-workers. They
[1:01:49] some sometimes it's innocent and all.
[1:01:50] Listen, we know you're a Christian.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; We know you don't really drink, but we
[1:01:55] want to have a little get together by
[1:01:57] the bar.
[1:01:59] We want to have a little outing in a
[1:02:01] place. Listen, it wouldn't be that bad.
[1:02:03] You know,
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; you could just try. You don't have to do
[1:02:06] too much.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; You don't have to dance too much. The
[1:02:09] music may not be gospel, but you could
[1:02:12] still come because we doing it together,
[1:02:14] right? That's resistance.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Trying to hinder you from being able to
[1:02:19] respond to your call.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; When God ready to call, imagine he
[1:02:23] calling for you, but you in the bar, the
[1:02:25] music so loud, you can't hear the phone
[1:02:26] when he ringing
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; because you're in the wrong place.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; That's resistance.
[1:02:32] Now the prophet one time he spoke about
[1:02:34] Johnny Crow
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; and we know the story. Nothing new.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Johnny Crow was out to eat the farmer's
[1:02:42] corn. That was his objective to feed
[1:02:44] himself. The farmer said, "Listen, I
[1:02:47] working too hard to allow you to eat my
[1:02:49] corn. I'm going to catch you hold your
[1:02:51] tire up and keep you here. You could eat
[1:02:54] a little corn if you want because you're
[1:02:56] tied. So I could limit and restrict how
[1:02:58] much you have access to."
[1:03:01] Johnny Crow stayed there patiently. He
[1:03:05] had no way out.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; But you know what? The other crows, the
[1:03:09] other birds, his other friends
[1:03:12] wanted to encourage him and tell him,
[1:03:14] "Johnny,
[1:03:16] it go and get cold. Winter coming. We
[1:03:19] need to fly south. We need to go."
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; That was his call there.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; That was his call at that point. His
[1:03:28] call was, "Let's head out. Let's fly to
[1:03:32] freedom."
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; There was a old man that saw Johnny
[1:03:36] Crow.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; And he felt sorry for him. He said,
[1:03:39] "Look, look at look, look at this. Look
[1:03:41] at this crow." So he went and he clipped
[1:03:43] the rope.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; The bird said, "Johnny crow, let's go.
[1:03:49] Let's leave. Winds are coming."
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; And you know what he said? He say he had
[1:03:55] so much doubt. He said, "I can't make
[1:03:57] it. I don't think I could make it. I
[1:04:00] don't think I could make it. I just stay
[1:04:02] right here." As a matter of fact, in his
[1:04:05] mind, he didn't realize freedom was on
[1:04:08] the door.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; He didn't realize he had the ability to
[1:04:11] go free at that moment
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; because he was in this scenario so long.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; He didn't believe he could be set free.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; And tonight, it might feel that you're
[1:04:22] holding on for so long.
[1:04:25] You've heard message after message.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; You're addicted for so long. You're tied
[1:04:30] up for so long. You're bound for so
[1:04:32] long. You're confused for so long.
[1:04:35] You're broken for so long. You might be
[1:04:38] shackled for so long. But I'm here
[1:04:40] tonight to tell you that you could go
[1:04:42] free.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; He is calling you out tonight. He is
[1:04:46] calling out to you tonight. But you have
[1:04:49] to respond because he set you free. And
[1:04:53] who the son of man set free
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; is free indeed.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Brother brother brother brother brother
[1:04:59] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:04:59] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:04:59] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:04:59] brother brother brotherham in a message
[1:05:00] awakening Jesus.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; He say you have to respond quickly.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; He said the other night the holy spirit
[1:05:07] struck over in some church. I know. And
[1:05:09] it called three or four people. He
[1:05:12] always say it called them.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit called
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; them. And when it did they didn't
[1:05:18] respond just quickly.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; And then he was grieved. He went right
[1:05:23] away. See, and left me right there. You
[1:05:26] have to You have to answer him back.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Just remember, he ain't
[1:05:32] obligated to you.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; You are obligated to him.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; When he call, you have to respond.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; You have to be in a position to answer.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; You have to be in a position to respond
[1:05:44] to his call.
[1:05:47] Can you imagine
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; if David
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; was a Trinidadian be in trouble today?
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Because Jesse had eight sons. David was
[1:05:57] the youngest. Think about it. Ju just
[1:05:59] picture it for a second. He had eight
[1:06:01] sons
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; and David was the youngest. David was
[1:06:05] out seeing about the sheep
[1:06:09] and Samuel was assigned to anoint a son
[1:06:12] of Jesse that God will show him to be
[1:06:16] king of Israel.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; My God.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Jesse in his elderly wisdom
[1:06:23] took his seven sons
[1:06:26] make sure they were well prepared. Their
[1:06:28] resume was printed. They had a digital
[1:06:31] copy as well. They were well-dressed,
[1:06:34] cologne, they took a shower, took a
[1:06:37] bath. I mean, they shaved. They went by
[1:06:39] the barber before and they stood before.
[1:06:42] They stood knowing that Samuel was
[1:06:44] coming to anoint one of them today.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; You could imagine how Jesse felt.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Proud father.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Proud father.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; It didn't even matter which one of the
[1:06:53] sons.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; I was going to be father of the king.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; And one by one, they came. One at a
[1:07:03] time, one by one, seven of them.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; At the end in Samuel 16, it says,
[1:07:10] "Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to
[1:07:12] pass before Samuel.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; And Samuel said unto Jesse, the Lord has
[1:07:16] not chosen these."
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; He didn't choose any of these, you know.
[1:07:21] So,
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; the Lord don't make mistakes.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; So, if he sent me to anoint one,
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; he have to vindicate this. He he have to
[1:07:31] show which one it is.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; And up to now seven of them pass
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; and I hear nothing.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; I see nothing.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; I feel nothing.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; I have the oil still here.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Everything is ready.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; But the sacrifice incorrect.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Wrong man.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Samuel said unto Jesse, "Are all thy
[1:07:55] children?" And he said, "There remainth
[1:07:57] yet the youngest." Now the reason I say
[1:08:00] if David was Triny nowadays you call the
[1:08:03] child hey your father calling you
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; they stop and ask you what he want
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; what you calling me for
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; one of my brothers can't handle whoever
[1:08:15] he calling for
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; not David you see I told you God will
[1:08:19] call who he want where he want when he
[1:08:22] want how he want he called David before
[1:08:25] he born you know David was called to the
[1:08:28] king before David took one step. You
[1:08:30] know
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; the same way he said listen in the womb
[1:08:32] I Jacob I love and Esau I hate
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; it didn't matter what David did you know
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; David was seen about the sheep
[1:08:40] predestinated to be king of Israel you
[1:08:42] know
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; so his response to that call
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; when he got that call that call was to
[1:08:49] come quickly
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; your father call in so he respond yes
[1:08:53] sir sir yes sir I am here what can I do
[1:08:56] for thee
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; they say you are still smelling like
[1:08:58] sheep you know
[1:09:00] He did not time to go to the barber.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; His suit wasn't laundered.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; He came just as he was.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; But you know what?
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; The oil came to meet him.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Based on his response, you know what it
[1:09:15] says
[1:09:16] it says in in and I skip down to verse
[1:09:18] 13. They say, "Then Samuel took the horn
[1:09:20] of oil and anointed him in the midst of
[1:09:22] his brethren.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; And the spirit of the Lord came upon
[1:09:25] David from that day forward." So you
[1:09:28] realize when God called,
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; the spirit came on him from that day
[1:09:34] forward.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; So it's so important how you respond to
[1:09:38] that call.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; What if he wasn't ready to respond?
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; What if he had the wrong attitude?
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; He come and say
[1:09:48] all of them, all of them in the army, I
[1:09:50] I hear just mining sheep. You calling me
[1:09:52] still.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; I I tired, you know, I working whole day
[1:09:56] mining sheep. No, but that wasn't his
[1:09:58] approach.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; He was trained.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; He knew how to respond.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; He was walking into the presence of the
[1:10:05] priests that could come and say, "Hey,
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; I anoint you to be king
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; over all of Israel."
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Knowing that he wasn't walking into the
[1:10:15] palace immediately, you know.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; So, can you imagine how he walked out?
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Chest held high, head held high, puffed
[1:10:22] up. He was the proudest guy on the
[1:10:24] block. Now,
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; not David.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Not David at all.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; The way he responded to that call
[1:10:37] resulted in the spirit coming over him
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; upon him from that day forth.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; At the same time,
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; you know what happened to Saul?
[1:10:52] left him immediately. You know,
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; evil spirit on him immediately. You
[1:10:57] know,
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; same day, you know,
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; your response could shake nations. You
[1:11:02] know,
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; your response could shape communities,
[1:11:06] you know,
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; so you think your your your workplace is
[1:11:09] something, you start to listen to the
[1:11:11] call of God. You start to pay attention
[1:11:13] to that still small voice and see what
[1:11:15] will happen.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; You will see mountains move. You know,
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; people that you thought stood in your
[1:11:20] way, you see them retire, you know, you
[1:11:22] see them resign and they they don't even
[1:11:24] know why.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Ready or not,
[1:11:31] here he comes.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; The story is told of the foolish
[1:11:36] virgins.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:39] And in the book of Matthew, there's an
[1:11:42] account Matthew 25.
[1:11:47] He says, "Then shall the kingdom of
[1:11:48] heaven be lightened unto 10 virgins,
[1:11:50] which took their lamps and went forth to
[1:11:53] meet the bridegroom. Five of them were
[1:11:56] wise, five of them were foolish. They
[1:11:58] that were foolish took their lamps and
[1:12:00] took no oil with them. But the wise took
[1:12:02] oil in their vessels with their lamps.
[1:12:04] While the bridegrooms harried, they all
[1:12:06] slumbered and slept." So you see up till
[1:12:09] this point they all on the same page
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; except for one thing.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; The wise one
[1:12:19] they took oil in their vessels with
[1:12:21] their lamps.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; They all waiting. They all ting. They
[1:12:26] all sleeping. They say slumbered and
[1:12:28] slept.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; But in verse six they said and at
[1:12:32] midnight
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; there was a cry made. So a call went out
[1:12:37] at midnight.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Behold the bridegroom cometh. Go ye out
[1:12:42] to meet him. That was the call at
[1:12:44] midnight.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Now mind you, that's what they were
[1:12:46] waiting for. You know,
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; because in verse one, it said they went
[1:12:51] forth to meet the bridegroom. So that's
[1:12:53] their objective. That's their motive. We
[1:12:56] must meet the bridegroom. So we meet
[1:12:57] you. Fellowship is convention. Hey, God
[1:13:00] bless you. We all here together. We all
[1:13:03] out to meet the bridegroom. Amen. Yes.
[1:13:05] we going to do that.
[1:13:07] But at this point when the call went
[1:13:09] out,
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; they all weren't ready.
[1:13:14] Only the wise ones
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; would have prepared enough to be ready.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; They say, "Then all in verse 7, then all
[1:13:23] those virgins arose and trimmed their
[1:13:25] lamps, and the foolish said unto the
[1:13:27] wise, give us of your oil, for our lamps
[1:13:29] are gone out." But the wise answered,
[1:13:32] saying, "Not so, least there be not
[1:13:34] enough for us and you." But go ye rather
[1:13:38] to them that sell and buy for
[1:13:39] yourselves.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Because it's an individual affair. If I
[1:13:42] give you mine, we all in the same boat.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; We all stay out and we all not see the
[1:13:46] bridegroom.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; But that is the purpose for which we
[1:13:49] came.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; That is the intention. That's why we are
[1:13:54] here.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; To be to make ourselves ready is the
[1:13:58] bridegroom we preparing towards.
[1:13:59] Hallelujah.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; So the bride had made herself ready.
[1:14:02] That's what we waiting for.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; We can't wait. And when we reach the the
[1:14:06] finish line, then then you realize
[1:14:08] somebody want help. Well, what we did,
[1:14:11] we sigh and cry. You know, we worship
[1:14:13] and praise. We sing. We water the
[1:14:16] promises. We add faith and mix it
[1:14:18] together. We do all that. So at the
[1:14:21] finish line now, you want me to come
[1:14:22] back and start with you?
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; we can't.
[1:14:30] So what was interesting is in verse 10
[1:14:32] it says and while they went to buy the
[1:14:35] bridegroom came
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; and they that were ready only they that
[1:14:39] were ready
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; went in with him to the marriage and the
[1:14:43] door was shut.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Afterward came also the other virgins
[1:14:48] saying Lord Lord open to us.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; But he answered and said verily I say
[1:14:52] unto you I know you not.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Because he only recognized the ready you
[1:14:57] know. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; He don't recognize the procrastinators
[1:15:00] and the late this is a kind of exam that
[1:15:03] it happening today.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; You it have no supplemental and after
[1:15:07] the fact I want to do a makeup. It don't
[1:15:09] have that.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; He who was filthy is filthy still.
[1:15:14] Righteous is righteous still. Holy holy
[1:15:16] still.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; It have no I just want to do over
[1:15:20] because really if you had gan next week
[1:15:23] that that wouldn't work. Not for this
[1:15:25] test.
[1:15:28] He went on and he says, "I know you not.
[1:15:32] Watch therefore for you neither you know
[1:15:34] neither the day nor the hour wherein the
[1:15:37] son of man cometh." So that's the
[1:15:39] warning there. We don't know. I don't
[1:15:42] know. You don't know. So we need to be
[1:15:45] ready regardless.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; It means we must be vigilant.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; We must be sharp. We must be ready at
[1:15:53] all times. We can't take chances. We
[1:15:56] can't procrastinate. We need to seek the
[1:15:58] Lord while he may be found and call upon
[1:16:01] him while he is near.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; If we do that, you'll be ready.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; What you want to have is the extra oil.
[1:16:10] Amen.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham spoke about Moses and
[1:16:19] he said, you know, it took 40 years for
[1:16:22] God to really shake Moses up a little
[1:16:24] bit.
[1:16:27] Moses knew from birth
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; that he was special.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; He was different.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; He had a special call in his life to
[1:16:36] deliver the pe people of Israel. He
[1:16:39] might have been in the wrong garb. He
[1:16:41] might have been in the wrong place. But
[1:16:43] he knew he was special.
[1:16:45] After he commit murder, of course, he
[1:16:47] ran
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; to the outside.
[1:16:51] As far as he concerned, mission
[1:16:54] um I forget the word they use, but it's
[1:16:56] like mission abandoned,
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; right? Aborted,
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:02] But with all this Egyptian philosophy,
[1:17:06] all the Egyptian technology, all the
[1:17:09] doctrines he would have gone through,
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; it took 40 years for God to drive that
[1:17:13] out. But what I think is important is
[1:17:16] that he had reached a point of normaly,
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; normal living. wife, family seeing about
[1:17:23] flocks and taking it easy, you know,
[1:17:25] minding the children. That that was
[1:17:27] Moses, brother Moses, father Moses, you
[1:17:30] know, just at ease in Zion until God
[1:17:34] interrupted that with the burning bush.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; It interrupted his normal way of life.
[1:17:41] It interrupted what he knew as
[1:17:43] traditional
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; in a message the angel of the covenant
[1:17:51] in paragraph 33 it says think of it now
[1:17:55] he said the time of the promise drew
[1:17:56] nigh and God called Moses by a pillar of
[1:17:58] fire in the burning bush then God
[1:18:01] commissioned him see the call
[1:18:05] now behold I've sent the angel before
[1:18:07] you to keep thee in the way and to bring
[1:18:09] thee into the place which has been
[1:18:10] prepared head which he's given to them.
[1:18:13] Beware of it. Provoke him not, for he
[1:18:15] will not pardon your transgression, for
[1:18:17] my name is in him. But if thou will
[1:18:19] indeed obey his voice and do all that I
[1:18:21] speak, then I'll be an adversary to thy
[1:18:24] adversaries. Notice he said, I'm going
[1:18:26] to send him now and I give you already.
[1:18:30] There it is. Get it? I have give you
[1:18:32] Palestine. It's yours now. It's all
[1:18:35] fencing with Hivites, Jebusites,
[1:18:37] Perisites, Amorites. It's all fencing
[1:18:40] but I given it to you
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; so it's yours
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; but it have resistance in it.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; It have challenges. It have obstacles.
[1:18:48] It have ups and downs.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; He say now let's break that down just
[1:18:52] for a minute. The land belong to him.
[1:18:55] Now God didn't say I'm going to go in
[1:18:57] there and empty the land for you and and
[1:19:00] give you this land that I take care of
[1:19:03] and it's well manicured and landscaped.
[1:19:05] No.
[1:19:06] He said, "I give it to you. Now you go
[1:19:09] fight it out with them.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; There you are. God's giving you healing
[1:19:15] tonight, lady.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; You, every one of you,
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; he give it to you. You know, he give you
[1:19:20] the healing.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; It's your possession.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; It's all bound down with Amorites and
[1:19:25] Canaanites and everything else
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; of unbelief. But go in, take it over.
[1:19:30] It's yours. It belongs to you. That's
[1:19:32] right. I must fight if I should reign.
[1:19:36] Increase my courage, Lord. This is not a
[1:19:38] picnic ground. This is a battlefield.
[1:19:41] See, not a place where we lay back and
[1:19:43] say, "Now, Lord, you just come force it
[1:19:45] right in me and then I'll do it." No,
[1:19:47] no, no, no, no. You don't do that. It
[1:19:49] wouldn't work that way. God has never
[1:19:52] done it that way. So, you could be
[1:19:54] healed tonight.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; You could be delivered tonight. Your
[1:19:58] wayward children could be set free and
[1:20:00] come home tonight.
[1:20:02] That is a promise to you.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; But you have to fight for it.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; You have to increase your faith.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; You have to believe
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; that he is a man of his word.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; And no word will return void
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; and he could accomplish whatever it goes
[1:20:18] after.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; And you have to put that into practice.
[1:20:21] Put it into motion and cut it out. So
[1:20:24] healing is mine tonight. Deliverance is
[1:20:26] mine tonight. Restoration is mine
[1:20:29] tonight.
[1:20:37] It's important when we speaking about a
[1:20:39] call
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; that we know who to respond to.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; We don't respond to every call.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; If some stranger were to come by my
[1:20:47] house and say, "Come." I I would be
[1:20:50] embarrassed and shocked if my children
[1:20:52] responded
[1:20:54] because they're not trained that way.
[1:20:58] Hallelujah.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; So they need to be trained to hear a
[1:21:02] certain sound.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; They need to know who they should
[1:21:06] respond to and who they should ignore.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; So it's important to be trained to
[1:21:14] understand that. I I know the prophet
[1:21:16] spoke about the trumpet sound. When a
[1:21:18] trumpet is sounded, it could be a number
[1:21:20] of things.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; It could be a call to war.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; It could be a feast. It could be a
[1:21:26] celebration of a person or something.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; It could mean different things. But when
[1:21:30] you are trained, you know what that song
[1:21:32] mean.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; You know if you hear that
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; how to respond to it
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; because you are trained.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; And it's not the first time you read
[1:21:42] that scripture. It's not the first time
[1:21:45] you hear that quote.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; It's not the first time you hear that
[1:21:48] message
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; because you're trained.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you know how to respond
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; and what to respond to.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Because it's a certain song.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; The word also said if it's an uncertain
[1:22:01] song, who will prepare for the battle?
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Who could be prepared?
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; The battle is not against flesh and
[1:22:08] blood.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; But you have to be ready.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; When you hear that certain sound, you
[1:22:13] could respond appropriately.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; So we have to be trained, right?
[1:22:17] Hallelujah.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "Listen, the acceptable year,
[1:22:21] as we know, is the year of Jubilee.
[1:22:23] That's when all the slaves and prisoners
[1:22:24] and so on that that were taken into
[1:22:28] captivity would be allowed to go free.
[1:22:30] No matter how long they were in bondage,
[1:22:33] how long they were supposed to stay
[1:22:34] there, when that year had come, the year
[1:22:37] of Jubilee, when the trumpet sounded,
[1:22:39] every man could go free.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; If he wanted to go free, you're free.
[1:22:44] There was no more slave
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; in a message Jubilee year paragraph 85
[1:22:49] he said then when the year of Jubilee or
[1:22:50] the blast comes the people are receiving
[1:22:53] the Holy Spirit. You deliberately listen
[1:22:56] now if you deliberately willfully turn
[1:22:58] it down. God has no more or not under
[1:23:03] any more obligation to ever speak to you
[1:23:05] no more. Amen.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Then you'll be marked off all the old
[1:23:10] types of the Old Testament, only types
[1:23:12] and shadows of the new.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; And to reject Christ and to turn him
[1:23:16] down that he'd knocked at your door,
[1:23:18] you're in the danger line of being bored
[1:23:20] to the air. Faith cometh by hearing,
[1:23:23] hearing the word of God. And God will
[1:23:25] put a blind over your ears that you'll
[1:23:28] never be able to understand no more. and
[1:23:31] you'll do no more than criticize the
[1:23:32] gospel as long as you live and die and
[1:23:35] be lost forever. What a time while it's
[1:23:38] jubilee time, while the doors are open.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; So the call could come in different
[1:23:46] ways,
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; sometimes a audible voice, sometimes
[1:23:48] it's a trumpet, sometimes it's something
[1:23:50] happen,
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; but the Holy Spirit responds with fire.
[1:23:54] You know,
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; sometime he call you with fire
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; and you have to respond a particular
[1:23:58] way. He gave a story one time
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; of a little boy with a turtle.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; And he said he saw it there and it
[1:24:06] curled up in the shell
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; and he took a stick and he started to
[1:24:10] hit it. He beat it a little bit and the
[1:24:12] turtle just remained in the shell.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; He decided to take the turtle and
[1:24:16] baptized in water. He put it in water
[1:24:19] and it stayed curled in the shell.
[1:24:21] Prophet said he decided to put some fire
[1:24:24] under it. He light some paper and put it
[1:24:27] under. You know that turtle that we know
[1:24:29] to be a slow animal start to sprint,
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; start to move
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; because it was too much fire.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost fire
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; sometimes will be so so listen so
[1:24:41] powerful in your life that you can't
[1:24:43] stay still.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; You can't sit down anymore. You have to
[1:24:47] do something. You have to lift your
[1:24:48] hands up. You have to stand up. You have
[1:24:51] to move. He said, "That's what we need
[1:24:53] tonight is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:55] and fire and not so much church creed
[1:24:58] back in the thing, back like the
[1:24:59] forefathers had it. We need another
[1:25:01] Pentecost that will line you up with the
[1:25:03] Holy Ghost. They'll send people to their
[1:25:05] knees, send people to their Bible to
[1:25:08] search the scriptures and look for them.
[1:25:10] It doesn't give an uncertain sound. It
[1:25:12] gives just exactly what the Bible said
[1:25:15] it would do. What Jesus said it'll it'll
[1:25:18] do. Ye abide in me and my words in you,
[1:25:20] then ask what you will." Why? You're in
[1:25:22] Christ by faith and the word is in you.
[1:25:25] That is the Holy Ghost in you and it is
[1:25:27] the word. Then this printed word makes
[1:25:30] itself manifest, bring it to life.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:36] [Music]
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Just about to wind down and I want to
[1:25:42] touch the mother eagle
[1:25:46] in a message as the eagle stirred up her
[1:25:48] nest. Paragraph 76.
[1:25:52] Now then when her little ones are born,
[1:25:55] the mother eagle, there comes there
[1:25:57] comes a time that the mother eagle is
[1:25:59] determined that her little eiglets are
[1:26:01] not going to be chickens.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; That's the way that God is.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; He determined that his sons and
[1:26:08] daughters will not be like everybody
[1:26:11] else.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; That you will be a chosen people.
[1:26:16] That'll be a royal priesthood,
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; a holy nation,
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; that you'll be set apart and different.
[1:26:22] Amen. Oh, I love that. I hope this sinks
[1:26:25] in. The mother eagle is determined that
[1:26:28] her babies will not act like the rest of
[1:26:29] them chickens, them birds that
[1:26:31] earthbound. She's got to give them an
[1:26:34] experience. That's the way Christ is to
[1:26:36] his church. There's something more than
[1:26:39] just joining church, belonging to a
[1:26:40] denomination. There's something more
[1:26:42] than just being a good citizen.
[1:26:44] Certainly Christ is here like the mother
[1:26:46] mother eagle to see that you get it. And
[1:26:49] the mother eagle is equipped to take
[1:26:50] care of her little ones to see that
[1:26:52] their experience is right.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; So there comes a time when there's a
[1:26:56] stirring in the nest. Oh God, send us a
[1:26:58] stirring in the nest. The eagle is
[1:27:00] supposed to be a bird that renews his
[1:27:02] youth. Every so often, no matter how old
[1:27:04] he is, he turns back to a young bird
[1:27:06] again. Not in years, but in physical
[1:27:09] makeup.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; He renews his youth. The Bible said he
[1:27:13] did.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Thou will renew his youth like the
[1:27:16] eagle.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; He renews his youth.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; She says she runs and she seems if
[1:27:23] something is wrong. She looks over her
[1:27:25] baby. She examines them. Oh, I've laid
[1:27:27] with binoculars and watch them. And she
[1:27:29] goes in all at once. Sets on the nests.
[1:27:32] She scream. What's she doing? She's
[1:27:35] teaching those little fellows her own
[1:27:37] call.
[1:27:39] My sheep know my voice. Those little
[1:27:41] fellows have never been out of that
[1:27:43] nest. They just live right there all the
[1:27:46] time. So it's the responsibility of the
[1:27:48] mother eagle to ensure that the eaglets
[1:27:51] knows the eagle call
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; so it could respond to the call
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; the musicians could get ready. in and in
[1:28:01] in in the same in the same message.
[1:28:07] At one point there was a farmer
[1:28:11] with some chickens.
[1:28:14] And
[1:28:16] when he was going to put them to to to
[1:28:20] to to lay in the barn, he took the eggs,
[1:28:24] all the chicken eggs,
[1:28:27] and he put a eagle egg with it to make
[1:28:29] up numbers.
[1:28:32] You know, one day in the barn,
[1:28:35] you say that chicken was sorry, that
[1:28:38] that eagle was different to all the
[1:28:40] chickens.
[1:28:42] It walked with the chickens.
[1:28:45] It probably thought it was a chicken,
[1:28:48] but something was different about it.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; It sometimes had little fights and
[1:28:56] challenges with the way things were. The
[1:28:58] fact that you just have to scratch the
[1:29:00] dirt, scratch around looking for scraps.
[1:29:04] Didn't feel natural.
[1:29:06] Just the way the old chickens went
[1:29:08] around and thought they were having a
[1:29:10] wonderful time. But you know one day
[1:29:12] while they were in the barnyard there
[1:29:14] came a scream across the sky. The old
[1:29:17] mother happened to sweep by and she
[1:29:19] looked down. She saw this little fellow
[1:29:22] tugging along looking. Oh brother, his
[1:29:25] eye is on the sparrow. This one thing we
[1:29:28] know, God knows his own.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; The old mother eagle happened to come
[1:29:34] over this barnard and she looked down.
[1:29:36] She saw her young. The farmer stole him.
[1:29:39] That's right. an egg out of her nest,
[1:29:42] but that was hers. She screamed to him,
[1:29:45] "Honey, son, you're not a chicken.
[1:29:48] You're an eagle.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; You are mine."
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; You see how the call came?
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; I've come for you.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; I remember the night when God made that
[1:29:57] scream to me.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; You're not of this world.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; You're not of them chickens.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; You're not a chicken to begin with.
[1:30:04] You're an eagle.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; You're mine. I've come for you. Now
[1:30:08] honey, up and listen to my word. Just
[1:30:11] make a little jump and flop your little
[1:30:13] wings. She's circling the barnard. Oh, I
[1:30:17] pray that this very hour he's circling
[1:30:19] the barnyard.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Your mind, you belong to me.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; You could play Jesus is here right now.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; There's something about that voice that
[1:30:27] he understood. He may have lived with
[1:30:30] chickens for a long time. He may have
[1:30:32] acted like a chicken and ate chick food
[1:30:36] whether crack corn or what what whatever
[1:30:38] it was. But when he heard that eagle
[1:30:40] call, something resonated in him
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; that he knew that sound.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Goodbye chicken yard. He made a great
[1:30:51] big flop with his little wings and he
[1:30:53] landed right on top of the barnard post.
[1:30:56] He seen he had done something. He wasn't
[1:30:59] the air yet, but he did something. I'd
[1:31:02] say then he joined a denomination. Got
[1:31:04] right in the middle of a Pentecostal
[1:31:05] organization. His mother screamed again,
[1:31:08] "Honey, you've got to come higher than
[1:31:11] that."
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; I think we do, too. We've got to come
[1:31:15] higher than that. We got to come higher
[1:31:17] than under an organization or
[1:31:19] denomination or confession. She said,
[1:31:22] "Just simply make another jump and flop
[1:31:25] with all that's in you. I'll catch you
[1:31:27] on my wings and I'll bear you up to a
[1:31:31] place where you ought to be. God bless
[1:31:34] you.
[1:31:36] [Music]

[1:44:14] Almighty God, Lord, we are a privileged
[1:44:17] people, Lord. Truly a world that has
[1:44:20] gone blind, Lord. Deaf to your voice,
[1:44:23] Lord, it's been crowded out by so many
[1:44:25] other voices. Voices of the world
[1:44:28] calling, voices of influence pulling and
[1:44:31] tugging in so many directions, Lord. So
[1:44:34] many young people, Father, feeling
[1:44:36] flailing, Lord, Father, at life. Lord,
[1:44:39] we thank you tonight, Lord, that amidst
[1:44:41] it all, you have called us, Lord,
[1:44:43] Father, you have called your people
[1:44:44] tonight onto glory and virtue, Lord.
[1:44:48] Tonight, you're asking, who is going to
[1:44:49] respond to that call? When the Son of
[1:44:51] Man cometh, shall he find faith on the
[1:44:53] earth. There must be a people. There
[1:44:56] will be a people tonight, Lord, who will
[1:44:59] respond to that call tonight. We believe
[1:45:01] by faith that we are that people
[1:45:03] tonight, Lord Jesus, that you've called
[1:45:04] out of every nation and kindred and
[1:45:07] tongue, oh God, to respond to the call
[1:45:09] of God in this hour, Lord. A call to
[1:45:11] perfection, a call to adoption, Lord, a
[1:45:15] call to a personal walk with God. Oh,
[1:45:18] Father, we thank you for your your our
[1:45:21] brother tonight, Lord. Father, your
[1:45:22] servant, there God, brother Gideon,
[1:45:24] Lord, who came and brought this message
[1:45:27] tonight, Father. Lord, so simple but yet
[1:45:29] so profound, so powerful, Lord. And to
[1:45:33] know, Lord, Father, that is you who are
[1:45:35] calling us, Lord. Lord, is such a great
[1:45:38] privilege, Lord. Lord,
[1:45:41] where could we go, Lord, Father, only
[1:45:44] you have the words of eternal life for
[1:45:45] us, Lord, we thank you for, Lord, the
[1:45:48] burden you put upon our brother's heart,
[1:45:50] Lord, Father, to share this word with us
[1:45:51] tonight. We pray that your presence
[1:45:53] would sweep over him now, Father, and
[1:45:55] anoint him, and inspire him, oh God,
[1:45:57] Father, and lift him up and raise him
[1:45:59] up, oh God, Father, for such a time of
[1:46:01] this, Lord. The fields are white to
[1:46:03] harvest, Lord, but the laborers are few,
[1:46:05] Lord. May you raise up laborers in your
[1:46:07] harvest, Lord, in the vineyard, to do
[1:46:09] the work, oh good, Father, until you
[1:46:11] come, oh God. Lord, we need so much more
[1:46:14] of you tonight. Lord, is a generation
[1:46:16] lost, Lord Father, looking for a savior,
[1:46:18] looking for a deliverer, looking for a
[1:46:20] voice out of all the confusion. Lord,
[1:46:22] may you speak to our hearts, Lord
[1:46:23] Father. May you shake us, oh God,
[1:46:25] Father. Lord, when you call, there's got
[1:46:27] to be a response, Lord Father. Lord, we
[1:46:30] obligated to respond quickly, Lord, or
[1:46:32] we'll miss that blessing or we don't
[1:46:34] want to miss it tonight. Lord, we want
[1:46:36] to know that it's you, Lord. Recognize
[1:46:37] it and then get concerned and convinced,
[1:46:40] Lord, Father, about the things that we
[1:46:42] have seen and heard. Oh God, move upon
[1:46:44] our hearts tonight in a mighty way. Move
[1:46:46] upon those, Lord, that may not been even
[1:46:49] been in the building tonight, Lord.
[1:46:50] Those that were maybe hooked up on the
[1:46:52] internet listening or or wherever they
[1:46:54] were tonight or even those who might
[1:46:56] hear this recorded service afterwards,
[1:46:58] Lord, and play it back in their homes or
[1:47:00] in their workplaces. We pray that the
[1:47:02] presence of God that was here with us
[1:47:04] tonight would flood them also in their
[1:47:06] atmosphere wherever they are, Lord. And
[1:47:08] may you speak to them, Father. May you
[1:47:11] anoint us and inspire us, oh God. Lord,
[1:47:13] for we have so much great need of thee
[1:47:15] in this a dark hour, Lord. It's a Oh
[1:47:17] Lord, it's an amazing grace to hear your
[1:47:20] voice. Speak to us tonight. We thank you
[1:47:22] for your voice. We thank you for your
[1:47:24] call and we're here to respond with arms
[1:47:26] wide open, Lord, openly and willingly,
[1:47:28] dear, God. Father, may you come and pour
[1:47:30] your baptism of the Holy Ghost upon us,
[1:47:32] Lord. Seal us away into the kingdom of
[1:47:34] God, Lord. Deliver us, Lord. Take us out
[1:47:37] of of evil, oh God. Take us out of
[1:47:38] clamoring, backbiting, Lord. Everything
[1:47:40] else, Lord God, that that is of the
[1:47:42] world, Lord. We want to leave it all
[1:47:43] behind tonight, Lord Jesus. Every
[1:47:45] persuasion, every other thing, Lord, may
[1:47:48] it be Christ only, Father. May you stand
[1:47:50] in the midst of everything, Lord. May
[1:47:52] all that we do and say revolve around
[1:47:54] you tonight. As we leave this place, may
[1:47:57] you go with each one. Bless each one,
