[31:50] with a lord voice singing cause them
[31:52] that have charge
[31:54] over the city to draw near even every
[31:56] man with his destroying weapon
[31:58] in his hand and behold six men came from
[32:01] the way of the higher gate
[32:02] which lied towards the north and every
[32:04] man a slaughter weapon in his hand and
[32:06] one man among them
[32:08] was clewed with linen with the writer's
[32:10] ink on by his side and they went in
[32:13] and stood beside the brazen altar the
[32:16] glory
[32:17] of the god of israel was going on from
[32:19] the cherub whereupon he was to the
[32:21] threshold
[32:22] of the house and he called to the man
[32:24] clothed with linen which had the
[32:26] righteous income by his side and the
[32:28] lord
[32:28] said unto him go through the midst of
[32:31] the city through the midst of jerusalem
[32:33] and
[32:33] set a mark upon the foreheads of the men
[32:36] that sigh
[32:37] and that cry for all the abominations
[32:40] that be then
[32:41] done in the midst thereof unto the
[32:43] others he said in my hearing go after

[33:04] men
[33:05] which were before the house and verse 11
[33:07] reads
[33:08] and behold the man included with linen
[33:11] which had the ink on by his side
[33:12] reported the matter
[33:14] saying i have done as thou has commanded
[33:17] me

[33:54] that had my commandments and keeped them
[33:57] he it is that love at me and he that
[33:59] loved me
[34:00] shall be loved of my father and i would
[34:02] love him
[34:04] i will manifest myself to him in
[34:06] revelation chapter 7
[34:08] in verse 1 and after these things i saw
[34:10] four angels standing
[34:12] on the four corners of the earth hole in
[34:14] the four winds of the earth
[34:16] that the wind should not blow on the
[34:17] earth no on the sea nor any tree
[34:20] and i saw another angel ascending from
[34:22] the east having the seal of the living
[34:24] god
[34:25] and he cried with a loud voice to the
[34:27] four angels to whom
[34:28] it was given to her the earth and the
[34:30] sea saying
[34:32] not the earth neither the sea nor the
[34:35] trees till we have sealed
[34:37] the servants of our god in their
[34:38] foreheads and i heard a number of them
[34:41] which were sealed
[34:42] and they were sealed 144 000
[34:45] of all the tribes of the chin of israel
[34:47] father god we pray that you would bless
[34:49] this word
[34:49] interpret our hearts in jesus name i ask
[34:52] it amen you may be seated
[34:55] wow uh
[35:04] this morning the ceiling angel
[35:07] was a title this morning the ceiling
[35:11] injured and uh
[35:15] if you note that the scripture
[35:19] that we read in ezekiel 9 where god
[35:21] started to begin
[35:23] he said begin at my sanctuary
[35:27] begin at my sanctuary is not something
[35:31] and the think that the scripture
[35:35] speak about uh
[35:38] the the the the lord voicing caused them
[35:41] to have charged over the city to join
[35:42] here
[35:43] every man with his destroying weapon in
[35:45] his hand
[35:46] but before they hit the city it hit the
[35:49] sanctuary hit the church
[35:51] it's not something i wonder if people
[35:55] have considered that first peter 4
[35:58] 17 18 says for the time has come
[36:02] that judgment must begin at the house of
[36:04] god
[36:05] and if it be first begin with at us what
[36:09] shall the end
[36:09] be of them that will be not the
[36:12] gospel of god and if the righteous
[36:16] scarcely be saved where
[36:19] shall the ungodly and the sinner appear
[36:22] so this is something worth noting that
[36:25] there was
[36:26] is co will come a time the judgment and
[36:29] the bible
[36:30] use this term must begin
[36:33] at the house of god that is before the
[36:36] city
[36:36] before instructions before other places
[36:40] you see so i know uh people may be
[36:43] concerned about the mark of the beast
[36:45] and the council of churches and the
[36:46] churches
[36:47] closing down but that is not the
[36:49] emphasis this morning
[36:51] we want to look at this ceiling angel
[36:54] this
[36:55] ceiling angel because destruction is on
[36:57] its way and
[36:58] and it's troubling to see people have a
[37:02] casual attitude about god a casual
[37:05] attitude about a message
[37:07] a casual attitude about god's
[37:11] wrath very casual you know it comes like
[37:14] you see preachers and
[37:15] and people speak in the word without
[37:17] fear of god
[37:18] they see what they want to see how they
[37:21] want to
[37:22] see it as if they don't understand
[37:25] that we are all in the palm of his hands
[37:28] and
[37:28] if he move his hands then we all
[37:32] would fall and god already spoke that
[37:35] that terrible is coming
[37:37] and he talked about behold i send you
[37:39] elijah the prophet before and great
[37:42] and terrible day of the lord and we find
[37:44] out that elias has already come
[37:46] and god sent elijah the prophet in this
[37:49] last day for us to escape
[37:51] to become the escape ones
[37:54] isn't that right and ezekiel the
[37:56] slaughter and angel was
[37:59] not not mercy angels the bible called
[38:01] them
[38:02] the slaughtering angels and if you have
[38:05] not listened to that
[38:06] bible study the story of jehu you should
[38:08] listen to it
[38:09] because it describes when the anointing
[38:13] of judgment
[38:14] is upon a man or upon a city upon a
[38:16] world
[38:18] nothing stops it it's it's cruel it's
[38:21] it's destructive it's nothing stopping
[38:24] it
[38:25] and this scripture we read it says slay
[38:27] utterly male female
[38:29] young old little children
[38:33] have no pity but come not near
[38:37] those with that mark hallelujah
[38:41] so when that time breaks when the
[38:43] announcement
[38:45] when it is announced then the question
[38:48] is not who is your pastor
[38:49] the question is not where you go to
[38:51] church the question is not how long in a
[38:54] message
[38:55] the question is not how much knowledge
[38:56] you have the question is not how much
[38:59] mysteries that you have
[39:00] or how much revelation of mysteries that
[39:02] you have the question becomes
[39:03] do you have the mark not a mac
[39:07] but d mark the mark that god expect
[39:10] and god require the seal of god
[39:15] hallelujah praise the name of the lord
[39:18] they have to have
[39:19] a seal in time because that angel from
[39:23] the east we read
[39:24] read about that angel of power and
[39:26] authority to tell the other
[39:28] four angels that are already in position
[39:31] they ain't coming you know they're
[39:32] already in position
[39:34] they've taken instructions from the
[39:36] angel from the east
[39:38] say hurt not the sea hurt not the earth
[39:41] don't hurt anything
[39:42] until hallelujah the jews be sealed
[39:46] this seated angel this angel from the
[39:49] east
[39:50] have a commission to make sure that 144
[39:54] 000
[39:55] elected jews are sealed but before they
[39:58] are sealed
[39:58] there's elected bride to be sealed it's
[40:02] one seal
[40:03] it's the seal of god oh hallelujah is
[40:06] one holy ghost baptism
[40:07] even as there's one lord even as there's
[40:09] one fate
[40:11] oh hallelujah praise god so the sealed
[40:14] angel has the power
[40:15] and authority to speak and instruct the
[40:18] angels of destruction
[40:20] that is already on the earth hallelujah
[40:23] that is already
[40:24] on the earth in position oh
[40:27] hallelujah when you talk about
[40:31] that destruction isaiah 13 6-11 talk
[40:35] about holy
[40:36] for the day of the lord is at hand it
[40:37] shall come as a destruction
[40:39] from the almighty therefore shall all
[40:43] hands be faint
[40:45] and every man's heart shall melt and
[40:47] they shall be afraid
[40:49] pangs and souls shall take a hold of
[40:51] them they shall be as pain
[40:53] as a woman in travail they shall be
[40:54] amazed one at another their faces shall
[40:57] be as flames
[40:58] behold the day of the lord cometh cruel
[41:01] both with rat
[41:02] and fierce anger to lead the land
[41:04] desolate he shall destroy
[41:07] the sinners thereof out of it for the
[41:09] stars of the heaven and his
[41:10] constellations thereof
[41:11] shall not give their light the sun shall
[41:13] be darkened it is going forth on the
[41:15] moon shall not cause the light to shine
[41:18] and i will punish the world for the evil
[41:21] and the
[41:21] wicked for the iniquity and i will cause
[41:24] the arrogancy of the proud to cease
[41:26] and will lay low the haughtiness of the
[41:28] terrible
[41:30] o glory to god this angel of god
[41:34] hallelujah and here the prophet says
[41:38] to see whether this message that we got
[41:41] is connected with it or not the very
[41:44] hour
[41:44] that israel was signed to be a nation

[42:06] told me what would take place
[42:07] then commissioned me 11 years later at

[49:39] hear these promises it's a certain song
[49:42] oh glory to god i will return unto thee
[49:45] according to the time of life
[49:47] john didn't make no mistake he said i
[49:49] saw an angel
[49:50] arise from the east having the sea of
[49:52] the living god
[49:53] not no fightful not no pastor not no
[49:56] bishop
[49:57] it was an angel it was the silly angel
[50:00] that angel is here
[50:01] to seal you into the kingdom of god oh

[50:05] i trust you feel the anointing where you
[50:07] are that's how we are feeling is inside
[50:09] of here
[50:09] oh glory to god hallelujah so sarah
[50:13] she was keeping her mind on the promise
[50:16] oh god help me jesus
[50:21] back in the old testament there was a
[50:23] year called the jubilee
[50:24] it was the year that all the captives
[50:26] could be set free every man that had
[50:28] been in captivity could go free
[50:30] it must have been a great meaning to
[50:32] this day or what is stood for in time
[50:34] oh hallelujah many hundred years has
[50:37] passed
[50:37] god has sent the jubilee in them days is
[50:39] the same god who sends jubilee today
[50:41] all the people that have been captured
[50:43] so are you in captivity this morning
[50:45] you could go free some pastor kept you
[50:48] some church creed
[50:49] are you born praise god bond because you
[50:51] made a long dress
[50:52] you figure you're in the kingdom of god
[50:53] because you have a long dress and you
[50:55] have a book and you believe a prophet
[50:56] that is a lie you know
[50:57] hallelujah you better get the holy ghost
[51:00] he said mary the reason
[51:01] mary had was to go in the upper room to
[51:03] get the holy ghost
[51:04] is because mary was born a mortal and
[51:06] she had to be born again to go up into
[51:08] heaven
[51:09] so mary didn't have a blind or her other
[51:11] excuse
[51:12] because i said be it done unto me
[51:14] according to thy word and that makes you
[51:16] eliminate or excuse her from the upper
[51:18] room she had to go and style with them
[51:19] like the rest of them
[51:20] she had to die out like the rest of them
[51:22] she had to fall unlike the rest of them
[51:24] she had to scream like the rest of them
[51:26] try to get pack out like the rest of
[51:27] them
[51:28] and so would you oh give the lord some
[51:30] praises hallelujah
[51:32] chica came to be mother of god and
[51:33] mother jesus she still had to hit
[51:35] the upper room or give the lord some
[51:37] praises if god is spear mary god is
[51:39] sparing you
[51:40] sitting alone with your longest and your
[51:42] church hallelujah
[51:43] glory to god amen thank you lord
[51:48] all the ones that were captivity didn't
[51:50] have to pay any price
[51:52] they could absolutely go free they could
[51:54] drop their whole if they were who in
[51:56] whatever they were instrument they were
[51:58] working with and they could go and be
[51:59] free
[52:00] that was by choice if they did not want
[52:04] to go free
[52:05] then they would call to the temple and
[52:07] their master would
[52:08] bore their air and they would have to
[52:11] save this master forever
[52:13] then this person that did not want to go
[52:15] free
[52:16] had to be sealed aha if you don't want
[52:20] to get go free you're going to get
[52:21] sealed here
[52:22] you'll be sealed out
[52:26] a beautiful type of the day of the seal
[52:28] of god
[52:29] or the marking of the beast which has
[52:31] been so much disputed what it was
[52:33] now faith on my hearing
[52:37] hearing the word of god right then when
[52:39] we hear
[52:40] that we are free here we go and refuse
[52:43] to act upon our freedom then
[52:47] we will be sealed to my opinion
[52:50] to be sealed away from god is to receive
[52:53] the mark of the peace
[52:57] so you see how you bring it now they go
[52:59] close we don't
[53:00] care buy and sell isn't that right
[53:04] people don't understand the ceiling
[53:05] going on now
[53:07] you're being marked to be filled with
[53:10] the holy ghost or mark to be judged
[53:12] oh glory to god remember cain went off
[53:14] the presence of god and was marked
[53:17] that was the first mark come from but
[53:20] before you as matthew went
[53:21] out of presence
[53:24] the bride will be coming into presence
[53:27] oh glory to god
[53:29] now that when the hearer of the heard
[53:32] the jubilee song
[53:33] if you if he didn't want to be free then
[53:36] he had to be sealed
[53:37] and it is today that when men and women
[53:40] he had this
[53:40] marvelous gospel of the lord jesus
[53:43] christ
[53:44] and of the baptism of the holy ghost you
[53:46] are the same place where you have to
[53:47] make a choice
[53:48] you can never hear and be the same you
[53:51] accept it
[53:51] and receive christ if you refuse it you
[53:54] are sealed away from christ
[53:56] oh glory it's your attitude towards the
[53:58] hearing
[53:59] of the word of god hallelujah praise god
[54:02] in acts 19 when they drop above the holy
[54:04] ghost then
[54:05] people say we even know we have that
[54:09] they say don't make joke it have that
[54:12] paul said but how was he baptized he's
[54:14] under john baptism he said that
[54:15] again but it's over again it has
[54:17] something called holy spirit
[54:19] we have in here but no holy ghost is
[54:21] that people you message ain't here but
[54:23] no holy ghost because they have been
[54:24] taught once you receive the messenger of
[54:26] the holy ghost
[54:27] which is a lie but a man was addressing
[54:29] that to the pentecostal who claimed to
[54:31] have an experience of the holy ghost he
[54:33] said if you have the holy ghost you will
[54:34] receive this word
[54:36] so people come in the message read when
[54:38] you believe the word you have the holy
[54:39] ghost and they believe
[54:41] the old self is holy ghost some some
[54:44] even believe they are the holy ghost
[54:46] demons lying to them productions of
[54:48] devils some even believe they are the
[54:50] holy ghost oh my god
[54:53] hallelujah when the seal and angel

[59:14] man still chopping man ministers
[59:16] chopping means the true championship
[59:19] and that is why he devil loves that
[59:21] because he know faith based upon
[59:22] forgiveness
[59:23] as long as they in that foolishness and
[59:25] they keep fighting and they're chopping
[59:26] up
[59:27] boldly lordly is coming there is no

[1:05:59] couldn't quit smoking that still isn't
[1:06:01] it
[1:06:02] until god received the sacrifice
[1:06:05] on his brass altar his altar of judgment
[1:06:08] all of us have to hit that altar in
[1:06:10] other words blessings and blessings is

[1:07:07] is his judgment
[1:07:08] death the wages of sin is dead

[1:07:13] judged because she is sealed into christ
[1:07:16] and christ took over judgment at calvary
[1:07:18] so god cannot come back and judge the
[1:07:20] bride
[1:07:21] she is free from judgment because she
[1:07:23] has brought from death unto life
[1:07:25] but god's penalty is death
[1:07:29] that's the currency of god that was he
[1:07:32] had to come down and pay the price to
[1:07:33] himself
[1:07:34] no man was found worthy he had to come
[1:07:35] on he had to come in the flesh
[1:07:37] to pay the penalty it was a cost that he
[1:07:40] couldn't avoid
[1:07:41] he couldn't say i could bypass it he
[1:07:43] can't bypass it
[1:07:44] he can't bypass his own law he can't
[1:07:47] bypass his word have it be a kinsman had
[1:07:49] to be somebody willing and rich
[1:07:51] and he came now and shake off his robe
[1:07:53] of glory take up a robe of flesh
[1:07:54] to pay the price a penalty to bring back
[1:07:56] sons to bring them back

[1:20:57] lusting for women you say well it's
[1:20:59] human nature
[1:21:00] not like that no it's a spirit
[1:21:03] the bible said it was a spirit that's
[1:21:06] right and the thing
[1:21:07] to do then the blood of jesus christ
[1:21:11] cleanses you from lust and passion
[1:21:14] called
[1:21:14] sanctification now the word
[1:21:17] sanctification means to be clean
[1:21:19] and set aside for service now that
[1:21:23] lust spirit leaves you under
[1:21:27] sanctification little
[1:21:30] lady nice goes to church she sings in

[1:21:48] oh my that is signification
[1:21:51] you are not sealed by certification
[1:21:56] you are sealed by the baptism of the
[1:21:58] holy spirit
[1:22:00] a ceiling is the completion of the work
[1:22:03] and that's the reason it couldn't be
[1:22:05] seen on the luther wesley either one
[1:22:08] so it's the holy spirit all along and
[1:22:10] that's the portion of the holy spirit
[1:22:13] this is a greater portion of the holy
[1:22:14] spirit then when you receive the baptism
[1:22:17] of the holy ghost
[1:22:18] that's the completion of the holy spirit
[1:22:20] taking its abode in you

[1:22:42] people believed it and accepted it
[1:22:44] and the light it was they were sealed
[1:22:46] away

[1:22:51] lutherans were sealed away by
[1:22:52] justification
[1:22:53] they experienced justification give the
[1:22:55] lord a shout
[1:22:56] hallelujah the wesleyan was sealed away
[1:22:59] by sanctification
[1:23:01] it was an experience oh my hallelujah
[1:23:05] he said they were so sanctified
[1:23:06] hallelujah that the holy ghost used to
[1:23:08] come upon them
[1:23:09] and they had buckets of water because
[1:23:11] when they get packed out on the floor
[1:23:12] they used to throw water to revive them
[1:23:14] because they couldn't get it because it

[1:23:52] short of that brother
[1:23:53] without the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:23:54] you are lost but if the spirit of god is
[1:23:56] in there
[1:23:57] the spirit can back up a little bit
[1:23:59] that's the only you don't have to worry
[1:24:00] about getting to heaven
[1:24:02] lost if there's nothing in there
[1:24:04] supernatural
[1:24:06] the doors can't unlock you could walk in
[1:24:08] there and bump your head against it

[1:33:38] ought to become
[1:33:39] we just received the word what's the
[1:33:40] secret the word
[1:33:42] is in the brain hallelujah then come
[1:33:44] what the spirit
[1:33:45] to activate the word that's in the bride
[1:33:48] why because the word is a seed who sows
[1:33:50] the seed son of man so sonam had to come
[1:33:52] back again
[1:33:53] to sow seed what seed the original seed
[1:33:55] is a bible seed
[1:33:56] because the word was lost to the ages so
[1:33:58] you have to gather all the word
[1:33:59] to bring it into a seed what the seed
[1:34:02] must produce the son of god again
[1:34:04] oh glory to god because after son of man
[1:34:06] is son of god after son of god god be
[1:34:08] son of david oh give the lord a shout
[1:34:10] did you get what i'm saying

[1:34:33] happened the enemy
[1:34:34] hallelujah the enemy come and saw an
[1:34:36] exceed
[1:34:38] so this is logical this is accepted this
[1:34:40] is the word
[1:34:41] we are worried about that who preaching
[1:34:42] false which are kind of crazy stuff that
[1:34:44] is he sees of the devil
[1:34:46] i have nothing to do with that they on
[1:34:47] their own hallelujah i am interested
[1:34:50] in the son of man seed sown for the
[1:34:52] bride a question was asked when the
[1:34:54] solomon cometh
[1:34:55] shall we find faith on the earth oh
[1:34:57] glory to god not talk faith

[1:35:09] massachusetts and tabernacle and this
[1:35:10] tabernacle and the spring no no shall we
[1:35:12] find faith unearthed
[1:35:14] and that fig would be expressed because
[1:35:15] he was sent a prophet to turn our hearts
[1:35:17] back to the fate of the fathers
[1:35:19] oh glory to god and peter didn't have no
[1:35:20] education to pop new set of mysteries
[1:35:22] and all kind of thing but they have to
[1:35:23] take note you have been by jesus
[1:35:25] oh glory to god and this bride
[1:35:26] hallelujah they had to take note
[1:35:29] that she had been with jesus oh glory to
[1:35:31] god because the works of jesus will be
[1:35:33] manifested
[1:35:34] through her he said by and through the
[1:35:36] bride will be fulfilled all
[1:35:37] so don't worry the bribe will fulfill
[1:35:39] all whether she educated or not
[1:35:41] whether she informed or not whether you
[1:35:43] know mysteries or not because christ
[1:35:44] in her is the mystery of all what are

[1:36:21] going both ways seal into god
[1:36:22] and seal away from god the seal away
[1:36:25] from god is the mark of the beast
[1:36:27] but every man getting a seal oh

[1:38:51] and destroy he said i
[1:38:52] seen them where these come from all
[1:38:55] kindred and the prophet said
[1:38:56] they were clothed with white robes and
[1:38:58] palms in the hand that's the bride

[1:39:02] here oh give the lord a shout
[1:39:04] oh glory to god you mean is a seal for
[1:39:07] the gentile right

[1:39:14] and the angels wrong about the throne
[1:39:16] elders four beasts fell on the throne on
[1:39:18] their faces and worshiped god

[1:39:44] you might
[1:39:45] shout you might sing you might speak
[1:39:48] with tongues and dance
[1:39:49] that has nothing at all to do with it
[1:39:52] until
[1:39:53] these things are scripturally proven
[1:39:56] and sealed into you the holy spirit
[1:39:59] seals you as an individual then you are
[1:40:03] sons and daughters
[1:40:04] i love that so there's no church ceilin
[1:40:07] there's no group sealing that why he
[1:40:09] said no church could hold the holy ghost

[1:40:12] nobody could say i have it you don't
[1:40:14] have it that's foolishness you don't
[1:40:16] have no scripture for that
[1:40:17] hallelujah they could have their
[1:40:18] teachings and doctrines and revelation
[1:40:20] that is their own
[1:40:21] but you see the holy ghost no man are
[1:40:22] controlling that oh give the lord a
[1:40:24] shout i love that

[1:40:33] you have
[1:40:34] something else oh you're on your own
[1:40:35] with that like foolishness oh that's why
[1:40:37] he's telling them those when they say
[1:40:38] the kingdom here
[1:40:39] he said whatever with them the kingdom
[1:40:41] is within you of them fool you
[1:40:43] that they come in for the kingdom yeah
[1:40:44] they come from the kingdom no no the
[1:40:45] kingdom is within you they can't know

[1:40:57] rider
[1:40:57] our glory the god is a sealed angel and
[1:41:00] the stealing angel is the holy spirit
[1:41:02] and the holy spirit is the white horse
[1:41:04] rider isn't that right
[1:41:05] thank you lord jesus hallelujah so but i
[1:41:08] ran on oneness
[1:41:09] he says the bible said in the last days
[1:41:11] there's going to be churches
[1:41:12] another power babel they'll have a form
[1:41:14] of godliness
[1:41:15] to deny god's word and power the power
[1:41:17] of his word what is the word
[1:41:19] what is the kingdom of god we've got to
[1:41:21] belong to the kingdom
[1:41:23] before we can be subjects of the king
[1:41:26] i love that did you hear that the king
[1:41:29] not in charge of nobody not belonging to
[1:41:31] the kingdom
[1:41:32] the king and that is where they get the
[1:41:35] kingdom from is the domain of the king
[1:41:37] because the king is the boss the king is
[1:41:40] in charge so when you belong to the
[1:41:42] kingdom the king protects you
[1:41:43] the king had to feed you how the king
[1:41:45] had to help you
[1:41:47] hallelujah the king covering you because
[1:41:49] that is his domain
[1:41:50] so you cannot be subject to the king if
[1:41:52] they're not in the kingdom
[1:41:53] oh glory to god hallelujah thank you
[1:41:56] lord
[1:41:57] he said what is the kingdom we belong to
[1:41:59] our kingdom before we can never be
[1:42:00] subject of the king
[1:42:01] how many knows that he said amen well
[1:42:03] how do you get into the kingdom
[1:42:06] how here we go the kingdom of god
[1:42:09] is the word of god made back in power
[1:42:16] so we appreciate mysteries let the
[1:42:18] machine turn into power
[1:42:20] let me see where that message really is
[1:42:22] you're preaching word let it work into
[1:42:24] the pope that's the kingdom
[1:42:26] oh hallelujah here we are the end time
[1:42:29] coming from the east west north south
[1:42:31] what are we doing
[1:42:33] getting ready for that rapture getting
[1:42:35] ready holding ourselves steady for a few
[1:42:37] minutes
[1:42:38] till every fiber is filled with the holy
[1:42:40] ghost oh you mean after all this
[1:42:42] teaching and preaching for 50-plus years
[1:42:45] we had to hold steady for a few minutes
[1:42:47] to be filled every fiber
[1:42:49] yes how you expect this mortal to put on
[1:42:51] immortality this transformation had to
[1:42:53] come from inside out
[1:42:54] hallelujah can't put a two-volt battery
[1:42:56] and you have a big engine a big engine
[1:42:58] is
[1:42:59] you understand that thomas engine you
[1:43:01] cannot tumble an engine with a
[1:43:03] torch like battery you have to get the
[1:43:05] power on the inside the tomilac engine
[1:43:07] so to move on to the rapture you have to
[1:43:09] get rapture in power
[1:43:11] otherwise known as rapture and faith not
[1:43:13] norman said no rapture in faith
[1:43:15] that you could believe that you'll be
[1:43:17] changed in a moment in a twinkle of an
[1:43:19] eye
[1:43:20] hallelujah he's calling people together
[1:43:22] in true oneness with himself
[1:43:24] by his holy spirit isn't that right
[1:43:26] hallelujah
[1:43:27] by one spirit we are all individually
[1:43:29] baptized into one body
[1:43:31] collectively the body of jesus christ
[1:43:33] and is jesus
[1:43:34] living with his spirit in your flesh is
[1:43:37] serving the church
[1:43:38] and doing the same things signs and then
[1:43:41] sign
[1:43:42] that you love him you're ready for the
[1:43:43] rapture and the word of god is a sword
[1:43:45] here we go
[1:43:46] and it takes a hand to hold the sword it
[1:43:48] takes
[1:43:49] that hand of fate and that hand of faith
[1:43:52] it depends upon how strong it is
[1:43:54] this hand of feet might just be strong
[1:43:55] enough to cut out a little hole
[1:43:57] and say by fate i'm saved that's a great
[1:43:59] cut but then
[1:44:01] if a stronger hand the whole that sword
[1:44:03] of a strong hand it will cut plumb
[1:44:05] through everything that the devil can
[1:44:06] put out there
[1:44:06] and make every promise shine through in
[1:44:08] the power of his resurrection
[1:44:10] strong on our faith you could cut the
[1:44:12] way you want you could god out lord that
[1:44:13] gave me a blessing they cut the blessing
[1:44:15] out
[1:44:16] and you could cut out to be filled with
[1:44:18] the holy ghost
[1:44:19] and he being the groom and the bride has
[1:44:21] to come forth because it's part of him
[1:44:23] and it can only be the manifestation of
[1:44:25] the fulfilling of
[1:44:27] all the revelations and others that
[1:44:29] spoke of the bride let me read it again
[1:44:30] this thing woody of reading again
[1:44:32] he being the groom the bride has to come
[1:44:35] forward cause
[1:44:36] it's part of him and it can only be
[1:44:40] the manifestation of the fulfillment
[1:44:44] of all the revelations that spoke of the
[1:44:47] bride
[1:44:48] it can only manifest if it does
[1:44:51] something different from the groom it
[1:44:52] isn't the bride
[1:44:53] because he is flesh of his flesh bone of
[1:44:55] his bone life of his life
[1:44:56] power is power oh glory to god so the
[1:44:59] bride will be
[1:45:00] the manifestation of the promised word
[1:45:03] hear that
[1:45:05] not talkation it has to come into our
[1:45:07] manifestation
[1:45:09] hallelujah oh my
[1:45:13] dynamics to the mechanics the world will
[1:45:15] not be able to withstand it
[1:45:17] i'll reason up again in the last days
[1:45:19] that's the easter message the dynamics
[1:45:21] and mechanics together mechanics without
[1:45:23] dynamics no good
[1:45:24] neither is dynamics without mechanics
[1:45:27] you can scream
[1:45:28] shout jump up and down all you want it
[1:45:30] won't do no good
[1:45:31] it will only work as they come together
[1:45:33] so will one set still
[1:45:35] and the other one will go up the only
[1:45:37] thing of it has got to be
[1:45:38] you have you might look alike here we go
[1:45:41] both claim to be churches
[1:45:43] both claim to be bright but one has
[1:45:45] mechanics and dynamics
[1:45:47] it brings to pass of what he said is the
[1:45:49] truth it just won't move no matter how
[1:45:51] good the mechanics is
[1:45:52] until the dynamics are so the mysteries
[1:45:55] and revelations
[1:45:56] and doctrines and teachings can be laid
[1:45:58] well out in well in order
[1:46:00] until dynamics come oh praise god it
[1:46:03] can't move
[1:46:04] and then he says you know in the church
[1:46:05] of the living god this morning
[1:46:07] lays the power oh hallelujah to heal all
[1:46:09] sickness
[1:46:10] in the church of the living god lays

[1:46:16] living god this morning

[1:46:41] finished
[1:46:43] yeah one day
[1:46:48] it'd be one last summon one day
[1:46:52] it will be breaking into dynamics to the
[1:46:54] mechanics
[1:46:56] oh my maybe today's that day this is
[1:46:58] brother branham
