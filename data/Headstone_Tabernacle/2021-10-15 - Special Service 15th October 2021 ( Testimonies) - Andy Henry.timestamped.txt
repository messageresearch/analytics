[12:26] pertaining to this man this fall man but
[12:28] we live under expectation of a promise

[12:33] immortality and this corruption will put
[12:35] on incorruption that we shall be changed
[12:38] this is our hope lord we have been young

[13:19] we want to do something for you we want
[13:21] to strike out we want to make a
[13:23] difference and lord may this be a
[13:26] turning point in some life a witness to
[13:28] some life granted father in jesus might
[13:31] ask it amen and amen at this time i want
[13:34] to turn it over to brother gideon who
[13:36] would uh let us know of the proceedings
[13:38] god bless you brother gideon
[13:42] good evening everyone
[13:44] you know truly it is a blessing and a
[13:46] privilege to be guarded here and you
[13:47] know for the last week
[13:49] we have been hearing about this special
[13:52] service that we want to have tonight
[13:54] and this was a level of excitement
[13:57] that i
[13:59] i'm really really in anticipation to see
[14:01] what the lord will do
[14:03] we have put some things in place we've
[14:05] actually had some presenters engaged
[14:08] that we really believe will be a
[14:09] blessing and an inspiration to us
[14:12] tonight and i want to invite you to
[14:14] really tune in and listen
[14:17] and see how god will work and how you
[14:19] will be impacted
[14:21] before we do that however there's a
[14:23] little um
[14:25] quote a little excerpt of the prophet's
[14:27] message that we like to just listen to
[14:29] briefly and then we'll get into the
[14:32] proceedings right so i invite you to
[14:34] listen with us
[14:38] exactly right
[14:40] then
[14:41] these children of israel these shadrach
[14:44] and initiative and ego gods witnesses
[14:48] god's never been without a witness
[14:51] he's always
[14:52] now here i want you to get this real
[14:55] post
[14:56] god has never at any time been without a
[14:59] witness on earth amen he's always had at
[15:02] least one man he could put his hands on
[15:04] and say that's my witness
[15:07] it's come down to one man one time job
[15:09] was his only witness
[15:11] abraham in the
[15:12] in the land but god had a witness
[15:15] somebody's going to witness for god
[15:18] somewhere
[15:19] now after a while we want to find out
[15:21] what a witness really is at this day
[15:23] all right
[15:24] notice these men as they went down there
[15:28] they refused to eat the king's meat
[15:31] drink his wine
[15:33] and they refused to bow to his image
[15:35] they were a genuine true witness of god
[15:41] then
[15:42] there are sometimes a penalty goes with
[15:44] the witness
[15:45] sometimes when you witness for god you
[15:47] have to suffer a little bit
[15:49] remember when the mother told you that
[15:52] you couldn't stay around home as long as
[15:53] you read the bible and carry it on or
[15:55] some of the neighbors said of the
[15:57] children said at school you was a
[15:58] fanatic or something because you was a
[16:00] true witness
[16:02] remember on the job how old a man
[16:04] laughed at you because you was a real
[16:07] how on the streets you were made fun of
[16:09] when you give a testimony but that's a
[16:11] genuine sign
[16:13] of a real true witness
[16:16] god wants witnesses
[16:19] not some people say our testifying
[16:21] church that's good
[16:22] but brother let your light shine in the
[16:24] dark places
[16:27] out in the high edges and the highways
[16:30] in the bar rooms out down the street
[16:32] everywhere you're at let your light
[16:34] shine as a witness
[16:37] amen notice
[16:39] then
[16:40] the fiery trial come on and every man
[16:43] that will witness for god will have to
[16:45] go through fiery trials
[16:47] isn't it strange how god leads his
[16:49] people
[16:50] very strange just as soon as jesus was
[16:52] baptized he went into the wilderness to
[16:55] be tempted of the devil just as soon as
[16:57] israel come out under the blood
[17:00] circumcised
[17:02] the holy spirit leading them in a form
[17:04] of a light
[17:06] right straight up to the red sea and
[17:09] there
[17:10] hard
[17:14] mountains on one side desert on the
[17:16] other pharaoh's army coming and
[17:18] the red sea cutting them off
[17:20] his name god led him right after that
[17:22] place want to get glory
[17:25] then
[17:26] moses prayed and god told him to step
[17:28] right on down towards your red sea
[17:30] holding his stick out in front of him
[17:32] and as he walked the red sea move from
[17:34] one side to the other
[17:36] right across the red sea
[17:38] why god's path led through
[17:41] as soon as it come out right into the
[17:44] wilderness of sin
[17:46] strange
[17:48] god's path led right through that great
[17:50] temptation there when they murmured
[17:52] against god
[17:54] they went from their own from one murmur
[17:56] to another from one trial to another as
[17:58] the old song says some to the waters sun
[18:01] through the floods some through deep
[18:03] trials but all through the blood
[18:07] that's god's way of leading
[18:09] leading his testimonies his witnesses
[18:13] now when it comes time to test of the
[18:16] fire
[18:17] shadow rightly shackly beneagle said our
[18:19] god is able to deliver us from the fire
[18:22] furnace but nevertheless
[18:25] if he doesn't we're not bowing down
[18:27] we're going to die
[18:29] [Music]
[18:30] i like that
[18:31] i like that old courage
[18:34] like old buddy robinson
[18:36] he said lord give me the backbone like a
[18:39] solo
[18:40] that's the kind of witness to thee
[18:42] courage
[18:44] god likes us to be courageous
[18:48] he told joshua before he crossed or said
[18:50] be thou very courageous
[18:54] for the lord thy god is with thee where
[18:56] so ever without god you say what if god
[18:58] would tell me like it did joshua i'd
[19:01] have some courage to he's told every
[19:03] believer the same thing amen i'll be
[19:06] with you always even to the end of the
[19:08] world i'll never leave the norfolk
[19:10] station
[19:12] courageous let's go take the promised
[19:14] land god gave us a promise
[19:17] let's be a real witness
[19:19] so
[19:25] amen
[19:26] so we appreciate that clip we appreciate
[19:29] those quotes
[19:32] at this time that you know that just put
[19:34] things in context for us
[19:36] so we would be inviting a couple
[19:38] witnesses to share with us their
[19:40] personal testimony of sorts you know
[19:43] things that they would have
[19:45] gone through the way that god would have
[19:47] inspired them things that
[19:49] that they would have been able to
[19:51] overcome
[19:52] and
[19:53] however they presented i want you to
[19:55] listen and see how you could learn
[19:58] how you could absorb it and how it could
[20:01] impact your life
[20:03] god could use anybody tonight right so
[20:07] with that said i'd like to invite
[20:09] uh a brother a deacon in the house of
[20:12] the lord none other than brother andy
[20:14] henry to start things off do you
[20:16] appreciate brother andy let's put our
[20:19] hands together for him
[20:25] right so good night everyone y'all hear
[20:27] me fine right
[20:29] all right good
[20:31] so
[20:32] i am
[20:34] i'm deeply honored tonight that
[20:37] i was asked
[20:39] to share a little bit
[20:41] and
[20:43] i'm gonna do my best
[20:44] a little nervous another custom to this
[20:46] forum but
[20:48] nonetheless got the praise right so
[20:51] i tonight i want to speak about
[20:55] um something that happened
[20:58] you know in the life of
[21:01] my wife and i
[21:02] about approximately two years about
[21:06] and um
[21:07] i believe that most people would have
[21:09] known about it as
[21:11] when our son alexey got sick in church
[21:14] and we had to rush him to hospital and
[21:16] all that
[21:18] and is is is so fit in the
[21:22] the um the excerpt that they played
[21:25] that
[21:26] scripture branham uh mentioned as well
[21:29] to his
[21:31] one is actually the same scripture that
[21:33] i
[21:34] have here that i wanted to start off
[21:36] with
[21:38] it's it is it um joshua chapter one and
[21:40] verse nine it says have not i commanded
[21:42] thee be strong and offer good courage be
[21:46] not afraid
[21:47] neither be thou dismayed for the lord
[21:49] thy god is with thee
[21:51] whether so ever dog is
[21:53] there's another um portion of scripture
[21:56] i want to share with you guys as well
[21:58] too is
[21:59] psalms 139 from verse
[22:02] 7 to 10
[22:05] and it says where shall i go from thy
[22:07] spirit
[22:08] or whether shall i flee from thy
[22:10] presence if i ascend up into heaven thou
[22:12] art there
[22:13] if i make my bed in hell thou are there
[22:16] if i take the wings of the morning and
[22:18] dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea
[22:21] even there shall i hand lead me and thy
[22:23] right hand shall hold me
[22:25] and
[22:28] i just want to start this all
[22:30] saying that
[22:33] situations will happen in our lives that
[22:36] we wouldn't understand
[22:37] we wouldn't know
[22:39] why
[22:40] or what's going on
[22:42] but once we
[22:45] trust
[22:47] that god is in control
[22:49] we needn't worry about anything
[22:52] so is so
[22:55] before the convention this was in 2019
[23:00] um i think was a couple of weeks before
[23:03] i was praying and asking the water i
[23:05] said lord
[23:07] i want to draw closer to you i want to
[23:09] move that deeper level with you
[23:12] and you know sometimes we see things
[23:16] and we don't really think about it or we
[23:18] don't really have any idea of
[23:20] how it gonna materialize in that sense
[23:25] but
[23:26] sometimes when we ask
[23:29] god for something he grants it onto us
[23:31] according to his will
[23:33] and it's also important to ask in god's
[23:36] will
[23:37] right so the convention weekend came
[23:40] about and we were having a good time in
[23:42] god's presence
[23:43] and all this on on sunday afternoon
[23:46] after the first service
[23:49] the morning service um
[23:52] alex fell in love we had to rush him to
[23:54] hospital and
[23:56] with all the commotion and the chaos and
[23:58] and all these things was
[24:01] it was very overwhelming and
[24:04] at that time we didn't really
[24:07] we didn't understand
[24:09] what was happening
[24:11] like
[24:12] why this this this was happening
[24:15] but
[24:16] god knew god knew what he was doing
[24:19] with us and in our lives so we just
[24:21] we just we just had we just have to to
[24:24] trust him trust the process that he's
[24:26] taking us through
[24:28] you know and
[24:30] sometime before all this had happened
[24:33] i sat down and i was thinking to myself
[24:35] i was like
[24:37] what what is really going on
[24:40] in my life
[24:41] you know like why isn't why nothing not
[24:44] happening because everything you know
[24:46] now i seem like a crazy question right
[24:49] because everything was going smooth
[24:52] you know
[24:54] you're not getting it nobody harassing
[24:56] you yeah you know and
[24:58] as christians
[25:00] we we must be mindful of these things
[25:03] when we when things going too smooth
[25:07] because
[25:10] let's let's use a literal example right
[25:13] and i won't be too long with you guys
[25:14] just a few minutes
[25:16] people don't throw stones at that tree
[25:18] with no fruit you ever see somebody
[25:20] throw in big stone
[25:21] mango tree i don't have no mangoes on it
[25:24] it don't make sense it's like
[25:27] some kind of crazy puss know something
[25:28] right
[25:29] and
[25:31] god doesn't give you more than you could
[25:33] bear
[25:34] if he allows
[25:36] whatever situation to come your way he
[25:39] is more than able to see your truth and
[25:43] we were so fortunate at
[25:46] that sunday
[25:48] that these things happen in church
[25:51] because
[25:54] god god has put the right people
[25:58] around you at the right time
[26:02] you know so
[26:05] is it
[26:06] there's either either to help you a long
[26:08] way or the tessier to see but either way
[26:12] god knows
[26:14] what he wants to bring out of us
[26:18] through every situation and every
[26:21] trial every test that he sends our way
[26:25] because
[26:26] god says it says in romans 8 20 that for
[26:30] we know that all things work together
[26:31] for good to them that love god
[26:33] to them that are the call according to
[26:35] his purpose
[26:37] so
[26:38] sometimes
[26:40] we might feel that
[26:43] i i i'm not really that important
[26:47] i'm not really
[26:48] you know what can i do
[26:51] to help
[26:53] god's people or to help the kingdom of
[26:55] god
[26:57] it's
[26:58] sometimes it would amaze you
[27:01] the kind of things that
[27:04] god will use little not
[27:06] not so much little but
[27:08] so-called insignificant people
[27:11] to do
[27:13] in the time in the right time basically
[27:16] so for example um
[27:19] that's sunday
[27:21] and and just for the record i'm not
[27:23] seeing anybody in signatures just join
[27:26] our reference right
[27:27] that sunday um
[27:31] i think a number of pastors were there
[27:34] and
[27:35] that
[27:36] um with alex he was unresponsive
[27:40] for a certain amount of time
[27:42] no pulse no
[27:43] wasn't getting no no blood oxygen levels
[27:46] all these stuff that they tried he
[27:48] wasn't getting anything
[27:49] and
[27:51] brother ullu and all him all the
[27:53] ministers and they were there and they
[27:55] everyone gathered outside
[27:58] by the gate
[28:00] and
[28:01] the parade for alex
[28:03] all the time he was unresponsive and on
[28:05] the way
[28:07] to on the way to the hospital
[28:10] sister donna was with us and she
[28:13] being a nurse she would do what she was
[28:15] trained to do in that sense
[28:18] and my wife was telling me that there's
[28:20] she was
[28:21] she was doing something called cardiac
[28:23] massage which is
[28:25] sort of like cpr for children in that
[28:27] sense
[28:28] and
[28:31] she was doing it
[28:34] she's just she kept doing it but after
[28:36] like i said after i think was two
[28:38] minutes or so
[28:40] with no responses then when you're
[28:44] yeah you stop basically but she kept
[28:47] going she kept going she kept going she
[28:49] kept going until
[28:51] i think was about halfway
[28:54] into the journey to the hospital
[28:58] alex he actually started to cry
[29:01] which he wasn't doing before he was just
[29:03] lifeless and all that
[29:04] so i mean
[29:05] [Music]
[29:07] even though
[29:09] it was
[29:10] i myself i was totally out of it i was
[29:13] just trying to see yes or i could get to
[29:15] the hospital as fast as possible but
[29:18] all in all god knew what he was doing in
[29:20] our lives
[29:21] because of that's very sad incident
[29:27] we have drawn closer to god
[29:30] the same thing i was asking god for
[29:33] lord i want to draw closer to you i want
[29:34] to move to a deeper level with you
[29:36] spiritually
[29:38] this situation he used this situation
[29:41] to bring that request to pass
[29:45] you know so
[29:46] i just want to say
[29:48] that
[29:49] despite whatever we may be going through
[29:52] we may not know or see
[29:55] or understand
[29:56] why
[29:57] things are happening now
[30:00] but later on the road we could look back
[30:02] and say
[30:03] this is why this happened because god
[30:05] wanted this
[30:07] in this place god wanted me to become
[30:10] better god wanted me what wanted this to
[30:12] happen he he knows
[30:15] everything that happens that is
[30:16] happening he
[30:18] knows the end from the beginning
[30:21] you know and i just want to do just want
[30:23] to say one more thing before i close off
[30:25] here is um like
[30:27] sometimes
[30:29] this this holy spirit leads us to do
[30:32] certain things
[30:34] and
[30:35] sometimes we listen sometimes we don't
[30:37] listen i just want to use one example
[30:39] that
[30:40] after this whole incident
[30:44] um
[30:45] we we had a i think was about
[30:47] either a week or two weeks after we had
[30:50] pre-meeting in church
[30:52] that was before the whole covert thing
[30:55] and
[30:57] i
[30:58] my wife and i we went
[31:00] we took alex we took the boys and we
[31:02] went down
[31:03] and
[31:05] i knelt by the by the bench and i was
[31:07] praying and i said lord
[31:09] i need your strength i need you to help
[31:11] me i need
[31:13] some sort of i need something real
[31:16] something genuine that i could
[31:18] use to push on through to move on
[31:22] and
[31:23] while i was on my knees there praying
[31:29] brother terry
[31:31] he came
[31:32] i'm right there you know he can't see so
[31:35] good he came and he found me where i was
[31:38] i don't know how he did that
[31:40] he laid hands on me and he prayed
[31:42] prayed for me for alex whole family
[31:46] and
[31:48] when i asked i asked him afterwards
[31:51] i said bro terry how
[31:54] how how you knew that i needed prayer
[31:58] he said i heard you
[32:00] in the spirit
[32:02] i heard you're growing in the spirit
[32:05] and i know that they needed
[32:07] some assistance
[32:09] so i just using that as an example
[32:12] that
[32:14] sometimes
[32:16] you know
[32:18] god might speak to us and
[32:21] we may not act upon it
[32:23] but
[32:24] if when we listen to the holy spirit and
[32:26] we obey sometimes that could be
[32:30] you could be the answer to someone's
[32:32] prayers that they're asking for
[32:34] the blessing that they they so desire
[32:36] need and seeking god could be using you
[32:41] to fulfill that request
[32:44] in their lives
[32:45] yeah brothers and sisters so that is my
[32:47] contribution tonight
[32:49] is not much but i hope it was a blessing
[32:51] to you guys
[32:53] god bless you all
[32:54] take care amen
[32:59] awesome or some tremendous brother andy
[33:02] i mean i
[33:04] i am astounded i am excited
[33:08] i don't know what to say if we were to
[33:10] close off right here i have been
[33:12] tremendously blessed already and you
[33:14] know life is so interesting
[33:17] i have known andy for a very very long
[33:19] time and i'm sure a lot of us in this
[33:21] room could say the same you know and you
[33:23] see andy we know his wife and his
[33:24] children and stuff and i remember that
[33:27] incident so clearly
[33:29] when
[33:31] in my mind i would say i know something
[33:33] happened to alex and he had to be rushed
[33:35] to the hospital i i didn't know all the
[33:38] details
[33:39] but hearing him express this present
[33:42] tense first hand as a true witness there
[33:46] i feel a sense of empathy i feel as if i
[33:49] was there i feel as if i know andy and
[33:52] sister victoria so much more and could
[33:55] relate to them so much better having
[33:57] heard what he expressed tonight and i'm
[34:00] sure a lot of us would be very very
[34:02] appreciative and and all of what you
[34:04] shared i think was fantastic i think it
[34:06] was really really holistic and things
[34:08] that we could take and apply
[34:10] i see where life and debt is really the
[34:12] power of the town because we've been
[34:14] saying since last week that today is a
[34:16] special service special service special
[34:18] service not knowing quite how things
[34:21] will truly unfold and here just by this
[34:24] start i think my god god has beaten all
[34:27] our expectations already so i just want
[34:29] to say that we really appreciate you
[34:31] andy that was tremendous at this point i
[34:35] want to invite
[34:37] um and it's
[34:39] my song coincidental but i would like to
[34:41] invite at this time none other than that
[34:44] news that he spoke about
[34:46] sister donald
[34:47] that was so instrumental there to be
[34:50] able to share with us a little bit of
[34:52] her personal experience in her own way
[34:54] what she chooses to to share with us
[34:56] tonight and i'm sure i know it would be
[34:58] a blessing in advance and without much
[35:00] to do i want to invite her to to to
[35:03] share share with us tonight god bless
[35:05] you
[35:09] good night everyone
[35:15] right because on my sins i was asked to
[35:18] share my testimony with you and
[35:20] encourage you in the lord
[35:22] brother gideon told me um i'm not happy
[35:25] brother so i had to write everything
[35:27] down and brother gideon told me it's
[35:29] okay to come off script but i'll try my
[35:31] best to stay on script tonight
[35:35] since i am in no wise perfect or good
[35:39] i see myself as the chief of sinners
[35:43] who i know me
[35:44] but god's mercy has spoken over me and
[35:48] because of that i stand before you today
[35:51] to boast of god's grace and mercy of
[35:54] which i am a living testimony
[35:58] i was introduced to the message by my
[36:00] husband
[36:01] when i met him
[36:03] coming from my seventh-day adventist
[36:05] background
[36:06] it all sounded
[36:08] like you know a different or like a cult
[36:12] because of what was indoctrinated into
[36:14] me we had plenty arguments on the word
[36:18] but he never gave up on me
[36:20] he continued leading and guiding me
[36:24] and god continued to use him that way
[36:27] and eventually
[36:29] i believed that before the foundation of
[36:31] the earth god knew me
[36:34] i enjoyed building services with him
[36:37] because we were together as a family
[36:40] one day he showed me where the church
[36:43] her son tabernacle was located
[36:45] and he told me the name of the pastor
[36:48] for he used to visit them when they were
[36:50] in arima
[36:52] one night that shiren and i were laid to
[36:54] go to the citizenship bonus and i
[36:56] decided
[36:58] to drive to grandy to see if headstone
[37:00] tabernacle if they were church there
[37:03] after service where there was ships and
[37:05] after service sister over approached me
[37:09] and with her greeting i felt very
[37:11] comfortable
[37:13] and one time i began barging her with a
[37:16] lot of questions
[37:17] and she was
[37:19] kind and gentle
[37:21] and she answered them all
[37:24] i continued with the 10 headstone
[37:26] tabernacle on and off the years
[37:30] one thing i took from my meeting that
[37:32] night
[37:33] is that i always wanted to make people
[37:35] feel as welcome as i felt that night
[37:38] helped hence my reason for god bless and
[37:42] a smile
[37:45] after many years i was baptized in the
[37:47] name of jesus christ and even though i
[37:50] didn't get the support of my natural
[37:52] family
[37:54] and cried a lot that day
[37:56] my new family here the tabernacle
[37:59] filled the gap and continually do
[38:02] and today
[38:03] is a special and today there's a special
[38:06] bond between my two families the church
[38:08] family and my natural family
[38:11] my husband tries his best to teach me
[38:14] the word at home
[38:16] for which i'm grateful
[38:18] and each time i enter the gate the
[38:20] church doors and hear the word of god i
[38:23] become more hungry for food
[38:27] as an adventist i knew about god
[38:31] no
[38:31] i know who god is
[38:33] i know who i am he is real to me
[38:37] and i have developed a relationship with
[38:39] him
[38:41] after i heard brother ovid preach word
[38:44] made flesh
[38:46] i knew
[38:47] that that is what i wanted to become
[38:50] when i heard rapturing faith is needed
[38:53] to leave here
[38:54] i began trying to live by faith
[38:57] and believe the more i exercise faith
[39:00] the closer i would be to leave here
[39:03] you see
[39:04] in the early years
[39:06] i hadn't i taught i had enough faith and
[39:09] was excited and ready to go and meet my
[39:12] tea opening
[39:13] i would often tell my family i am
[39:15] leaving just now i know i gonna meet my
[39:17] teopony
[39:19] little did i know that the journey was
[39:21] only beginning
[39:23] i have been quite a fanatic by some
[39:26] and maybe i do this plate at times
[39:29] but i am not taking any chances
[39:32] if god said it
[39:34] i believe it
[39:36] through the years i have had mountain
[39:38] top
[39:39] valley experience
[39:41] and plenty of dead man won
[39:43] but god has always kept his will
[39:46] concerning me
[39:47] and never left me
[39:50] when met with criticism
[39:52] i remember that i am justified
[39:55] and i shall conform in god's image
[39:58] so even though i may not look like much
[40:00] love
[40:00] i shall become just like him
[40:04] there are many testimonies i can share
[40:08] of god keeping his word concerning me
[40:11] but i know that time won't permit me to
[40:14] share all
[40:15] but i can share
[40:17] some of what i learned
[40:20] after my many many trials and testing
[40:23] even though the journey now starts
[40:26] i will stop here and come on script
[40:29] and talk a little about like um what
[40:33] brother andy shared
[40:34] from a nursing point of view
[40:37] with brother alex and how it changed my
[40:39] life also
[40:41] um
[40:42] that day
[40:43] after um alex became unresponsive you
[40:46] know you're trying everything you can
[40:48] and i recognize
[40:49] you know nothing
[40:51] you know and i couldn't believe you're
[40:53] safe i don't know
[40:55] that ca that could happen
[40:57] alice and go gesso
[40:59] you know and i you know i just grabbed
[41:00] him when i recognized he was responding
[41:02] and i started to run outside
[41:05] and um by the gate
[41:07] we you know the fastest pain
[41:09] and you know in my naturalness and self
[41:11] i tell myself why they keeping me back
[41:13] for
[41:14] they holding me back i need to get in
[41:16] the hospital and they're holding me back
[41:18] and thank god that they held me back
[41:20] because what they did they prayed for
[41:23] alex and because they prayed for alex is
[41:25] why alex is here today
[41:28] nothing else and because of that it
[41:30] changed my whole perspective so since
[41:33] the doctors can say what but god's word
[41:36] is true he believed then and have faith
[41:40] now go back to my spirit brother gideon
[41:43] i am never ashamed to ask the believers
[41:46] to agree with me in prayer because he
[41:48] said two or three it shall be done i
[41:51] love to embarrass the devil
[41:53] so anytime i become fearful and i wonder
[41:56] how it goes look
[41:58] i wonder this i wonder that i embarrass
[42:00] the devil i try it out to the group
[42:02] please pray for me the devil is not to
[42:04] have nothing on me
[42:06] god is faithful
[42:08] do i feel him and do i feel him his word
[42:12] does not go back void
[42:14] i do face the consequences of my
[42:16] decision
[42:17] but it's because he loves me
[42:20] be respectful
[42:22] be respectful to his servant
[42:24] if we believe that god is using brother
[42:27] over from the pulpit
[42:29] lord would use them in every situation
[42:31] of our lives
[42:33] yes there were times i didn't listen to
[42:35] god's giving advice from buddha over
[42:38] and i faced the consequences of it
[42:40] i had to repent and i had to apologize
[42:44] god is a jealous god
[42:46] and he will test you with what you love
[42:48] more than him
[42:51] when you hear me shout glory hallelujah
[42:55] i am just trying my best
[42:57] to catch
[42:58] or receive all the promises passing by i
[43:02] always tell the children you know when
[43:04] brother or whoever preaching i say mine
[43:06] so every time i say mine instead of
[43:08] saying mine are looking like a mad
[43:09] person in church i will say glory
[43:12] hallelujah that is mine
[43:14] right i am always trying to respond
[43:17] quickly
[43:18] if god asks you to separate yourself
[43:21] like abraham allah
[43:23] just do it
[43:24] because he will mash up the scene the
[43:27] whole scene
[43:28] but it's for your good
[43:31] i know that i can have faith and still
[43:33] be nothing
[43:35] but i
[43:36] but i have faith in who god say i am
[43:39] and who i would become
[43:40] so i would continue to be obedient to
[43:42] the whole world
[43:44] i am still being molded
[43:47] when things are going bad praise god
[43:50] anyhow
[43:51] it means some funny in your ear but
[43:54] eventually a peace will come in your
[43:56] soul
[43:57] sometimes hardship and trouble comes
[44:00] like waves one after the other tumbling
[44:03] you all over the place they crack at
[44:05] your breath
[44:06] please know that god is in control
[44:10] i used to try to fix my family by
[44:13] pounding them with the wood
[44:15] and worrying
[44:17] always currently never the word the word
[44:19] city would say
[44:20] and i began to get weaker because i was
[44:23] trying to fix them and not fix myself
[44:26] so i decided
[44:28] when i become wood made flesh i shall be
[44:31] able to manifest revelation 22 17.
[44:35] until then
[44:36] i can only dispatch the angels after
[44:39] them
[44:40] i love praising god anywhere anytime
[44:45] and now i'll come on script again
[44:48] a few weeks ago um a while ago i
[44:51] actually church to pray for one of my
[44:53] dear colleagues who had the bleeding her
[44:56] brain
[44:57] so one friday night during prayer
[44:59] meeting i got a call that they said that
[45:02] the doctors called her relatives
[45:04] to say their goodbyes
[45:07] so you know during prayer meeting i
[45:08] can't remember not what number of it
[45:10] said continue you know and he spoke
[45:12] directly into that situation
[45:14] and i told myself if god because he was
[45:16] brought up he didn't even know what was
[45:18] happening because i couldn't call
[45:19] anybody and he spoke directly into the
[45:22] situation
[45:23] i began praying praying we got and
[45:26] everyone was agreeing and pray began
[45:28] praying for her
[45:30] the morning and it's very hard it's not
[45:32] easy to pray no you know why because i
[45:34] don't know telling yourself
[45:37] that is it that is it so every time you
[45:39] talk calm i don't keep saying she does
[45:40] research research trying to draw all the
[45:42] noise
[45:44] of what i know
[45:46] in the morning i got a call and her
[45:48] husband said to come over the top

[46:14] that boy would turn it down wrong for
[46:15] her because he did it before how can i
[46:17] not go down to the hospital and expect

[47:53] who you know she doesn't know where the
[47:55] where god is getting worse just have to
[47:57] pray and then break out and praise our
[47:58] worship rather see the doctors and the
[48:01] father move and give us room
[48:03] you know and you know when i open my
[48:05] iphone praying i see latoya hand up in
[48:08] the air giving god glory
[48:11] that made me shock even more because
[48:14] here you're saying that there's a person
[48:17] on her dead bedding night and goddess
[48:19] come on tonight
[48:21] no man i cannot sleep that wart with my
[48:23] more clothes i had a shot one time i
[48:26] left the whole world
[48:28] but i wanted to reach back and he got
[48:29] the turkey that was going to do i
[48:31] started a shop straight to the wall
[48:33] glory i didn't care they thought i was
[48:35] mad because they told the prophet was my
[48:37] suicidal business you understand so i
[48:40] walked through the whole down the
[48:42] elevator shouting glory hallelujah
[48:44] walked through the hospital or the car
[48:47] park short into the top of my lungs
[48:49] glory hallelujah he i had to calm down
[48:52] before i entered the car since god is
[48:55] real when we agree and it is not one
[48:58] person prayer all of us were praying
[49:00] together a collective prayer we were
[49:03] praying on a green and heartbeat and god
[49:06] answers pray and if and she's still in
[49:09] hospital but god will continue to do
[49:12] what he started
[49:15] okay
[49:16] since the road
[49:18] back to script brother gideon since the
[49:20] road is hard
[49:22] but
[49:24] but um sorry the road is hard but god
[49:27] does not want it any other way we are
[49:29] being perfected
[49:31] apologize quickly because you may never
[49:33] get a second chance
[49:35] ask what each year to teach you to love
[49:38] for love does not come naturally
[49:41] examine yourself often to ensure that
[49:43] you are not hindering yourself
[49:46] an example that i have on script
[49:48] the other day um i had to apologize to
[49:51] someone i love
[49:53] and tell them that i had hatred in my
[49:55] heart for that it's a service that
[49:58] brother
[49:59] uh premier tonight
[50:01] brother can't brother i supposed to talk
[50:03] about examining yourself
[50:05] and i had to examine myself and um i
[50:08] recognized i had hatred i never knew i
[50:10] had that before and i had to apologize
[50:12] to the person
[50:14] to let them know that i had hatred in my
[50:15] heart towards them and to ask for
[50:18] forgiveness
[50:20] and now that relationship is much better
[50:22] by jesus in jesus name
[50:26] sadly when you stop
[50:27] praying and reading your bible daily
[50:30] things start to fall apart even your
[50:32] family life
[50:34] so keep praying up
[50:36] stay with the wound and stay blessed
[50:38] thank you very much
[50:43] thank you very much sister donna kay i
[50:46] think
[50:47] that that was nothing short of
[50:49] tremendous i mean i
[50:52] i'm sure you could see the excitement on
[50:54] my face i have been blessed
[50:56] above and beyond my expectations i keep
[50:59] saying but i don't know if you all see a
[51:01] consistent theme
[51:03] you know
[51:04] we've heard it many many times if you
[51:06] could only get started
[51:08] god will do the rest and you saw in
[51:11] brother and this scenario he was there
[51:14] praying specific prayers
[51:16] he had something to do
[51:18] and he saw those prayers answered in
[51:20] different ways but he did something
[51:23] specifically you know i just want to
[51:25] give two examples of that in a message
[51:28] and in the bible as well the prophet
[51:30] also gives uh an example in which and
[51:34] i'm sure you know you know this story he
[51:36] was at the airport
[51:37] and
[51:38] something told him
[51:40] to start walking
[51:42] and he started to walk
[51:44] and voiceover keep walking and he walked
[51:47] and he walked and walked and he walked
[51:50] until he came up to a house a simple
[51:52] humble room with a colored woman in the
[51:55] porch
[51:56] and right there you know she turned to
[51:58] him and she acknowledged him and said
[52:00] good morning person
[52:03] and he turned back to her and said how
[52:04] did you know i was a pastor
[52:07] and she would have responded and said
[52:09] you know what
[52:11] i was praying
[52:12] i was doing something
[52:14] i was doing my part and waiting for god
[52:17] to show up
[52:18] and we see it over and over again so i
[52:21] feel so excited i feel inspired by it
[52:24] i'm also reminded of this story with the
[52:27] man
[52:28] that stood outside the pool
[52:30] and um
[52:32] he needed assistance to be placed inside
[52:35] the pool in order to be healed
[52:37] and you know the people at the time came
[52:40] and said you know jesus is on the next
[52:41] street that's why you know there's no
[52:43] action here the commotion is on the next
[52:45] street and if you read in scripture it
[52:47] says
[52:48] when he heard that
[52:50] he cried all the more
[52:53] he didn't stop doing what he was doing
[52:55] because it seemed like it was a
[52:56] challenging scenario
[52:58] he took that as a motivation and drive
[53:01] and impetus to do even greater than he
[53:04] was doing before and then he could have
[53:06] seen the power of god blessing him i
[53:08] just want to say we appreciate you very
[53:10] much sister donaghy your words i think
[53:12] we're really really inspiring to us we
[53:15] know that it's heartfelt and sincere and
[53:18] god bless you richly
[53:20] at this time
[53:22] i want to invite
[53:24] a veteran
[53:27] uh a veteran in the field a man who has
[53:30] seen a lot
[53:32] a man who has done turned on quite a bit
[53:35] and a man who i believe we could learn
[53:36] all that from without much to do he
[53:39] needs no introduction he's none other
[53:41] than brother clarence clarke
[54:04] god bless you
[54:08] i hope that you hearing um
[54:12] gideon introduce me or something i i try
[54:15] to figure out who is that what's he
[54:17] talking about
[54:18] you know
[54:20] because i i don't see myself that way
[54:23] it's just a
[54:25] little brother
[54:26] um
[54:28] a little glass that god
[54:30] take up
[54:32] and decide to clean and
[54:34] pour something in him so he could use
[54:36] either
[54:37] you know so uh
[54:39] that that to me
[54:41] well um
[54:43] uh
[54:44] well i could see
[54:46] i think i would just
[54:48] uh start off with a little bit of advice
[54:52] because we don't have much time
[54:55] i want to say that um
[54:59] i came to the message
[55:02] in the 70s
[55:04] 1971 to be exact
[55:07] i
[55:08] [Music]
[55:09] grew up
[55:10] as a little catholic boy
[55:12] you know
[55:14] and um
[55:16] they know anything about message i know
[55:18] about god
[55:24] at the time that god decided to work on
[55:26] me as a
[55:27] teenager coming up young young man
[55:31] there was a
[55:34] two
[55:35] pentecostal people
[55:37] which i was i used to refer to the
[55:39] second mother and father
[55:42] with mr smith
[55:44] they used to be always encouragement
[55:47] to come to church with them
[55:49] but i grabbed as a catholic
[55:52] well you know and
[55:55] they started to kind of coach better be
[55:58] a collider thing like that
[56:01] so i didn't know about this
[56:03] pentecostality
[56:05] so i happened to
[56:07] uh
[56:09] yeah one of their sons was a very is a
[56:11] very good friend of mine
[56:13] and
[56:15] has uh decided to take up the invitation
[56:18] one day that all right assessment i will
[56:21] come to the
[56:22] pedicle church
[56:24] i did that
[56:26] but before
[56:28] going to the church
[56:30] but friend
[56:31] this is
[56:32] a robot
[56:34] which i pray that would save him and
[56:36] pray that your prayer
[56:38] that i say robert listen because i
[56:42] always heard that when you go to these
[56:44] pentecostal
[56:46] church
[56:47] somehow something that's happened
[56:50] you just end up going by the altar
[56:52] there's there's
[56:53] come to the altar something is up
[56:56] so i say i told her about ceremony
[57:00] if you see me going up by that altar
[57:02] hold me back
[57:03] all right because i'm not saying that
[57:05] you know so
[57:07] i said okay
[57:08] so it happened that we ran this sunday
[57:11] and i made sure saddam read to the back
[57:14] of the church
[57:15] they wanted to put me i said no i said
[57:17] on the last bench back in the church
[57:20] uh
[57:22] so this was mighty
[57:24] that is a
[57:25] pastor alexander the giant remover
[57:29] and so happened that
[57:32] i didn't work for the author
[57:34] but it had me thinking
[57:37] and a few days after
[57:42] we started to think
[57:45] i end up going
[57:48] by my nephew this is
[57:50] uh brother lincoln
[57:53] he
[57:55] was working lungs and service
[57:57] and i used to go down there and just
[58:00] lying sometimes
[58:02] you know
[58:04] done work or something
[58:06] and
[58:07] i meet some graduating down there and
[58:08] they were talking about scriptures that
[58:10] thing i didn't know anything about you
[58:12] know bible
[58:14] but in talking to them i was a better
[58:17] thing
[58:19] and they were talking about this profit
[58:21] of this message
[58:23] but i just sit down listening because i
[58:26] had no input
[58:27] as a result of that
[58:30] somehow
[58:31] i started doing a little more
[58:33] and listening to them and
[58:38] where the best decision listens
[58:40] come to mind they come and listen to
[58:42] this this brother that you know in in
[58:45] our
[58:46] school i just hear this manners all
[58:48] right so
[58:50] at first a couple of times i had to say
[58:53] i wasn't going and then one day
[58:55] i say all right i'll go
[58:58] and i remember well it was a friday
[59:02] i
[59:03] well
[59:04] i changed my clothes i remember changing
[59:07] clothes
[59:08] and singing my life and
[59:11] i going to church
[59:13] but i left home
[59:15] walk down mover
[59:30] all right rex
[59:32] and i have to be passing by am i walking
[59:35] down and when i look on the billboard i
[59:38] saw
[59:39] a movie
[59:42] the movie named she
[59:44] now i wanted to see that movie for a
[59:47] long time
[59:48] so when i saw the movie i said what the
[59:52] show tonight i said okay
[59:55] i'm going
[59:56] theater
[59:58] because men go in church again
[1:00:01] now
[1:00:03] um
[1:00:04] back there you know when you're
[1:00:05] uncomfortable so
[1:00:08] the first thing you're early
[1:00:11] so my first attempt is
[1:00:14] at a storm detail because we have a
[1:00:18] at that time
[1:00:19] you know
[1:00:20] at that time said lamar had treated
[1:00:23] picture house and balcony so i decided
[1:00:26] well
[1:00:27] i know exactly how to
[1:00:29] escape and stop me
[1:00:32] now since
[1:00:33] i always
[1:00:35] tell this
[1:00:37] and
[1:00:38] this is the part may seem strange
[1:00:41] it is also strange to me
[1:00:44] in that i knew
[1:00:48] i
[1:00:48] went
[1:00:50] up
[1:00:52] to go into the cinema
[1:00:56] i could see myself now going going in
[1:00:59] trying to judge a fella named jacko
[1:01:02] to go into the city mata high you know
[1:01:05] to make sure i stopped
[1:01:10] the only thing and i can see it now the
[1:01:13] only thing that i remember
[1:01:16] is going there
[1:01:19] the next thing
[1:01:22] i was conscious of
[1:01:26] i was walking down in school
[1:01:29] i mean like i said i don't know what
[1:01:31] happened
[1:01:32] that is a blank i don't know
[1:01:36] if i was translated i don't know if my
[1:01:39] mind went i don't know i
[1:01:41] get no memory
[1:01:44] of what happened there i know i was
[1:01:46] going and the next thing i remember
[1:01:49] i find
[1:01:50] myself walking
[1:01:53] going on
[1:01:55] a school looking for this building
[1:01:58] i don't know what happened it is a
[1:02:00] mystery to me even up to now all these
[1:02:03] years
[1:02:04] but that is all i could tell i don't
[1:02:06] know what happened
[1:02:08] now when i reached long
[1:02:10] uh at school
[1:02:12] i did saw this little
[1:02:16] place
[1:02:18] it looked like with that conversion shop
[1:02:21] and i saw this guy
[1:02:22] preaching
[1:02:24] i decided well look
[1:02:26] i saw a lady outside and she
[1:02:30] was peeping and she said become
[1:02:33] so sorry
[1:02:34] i it's okay
[1:02:36] so she said well let me take it before i
[1:02:38] say no let me say don't take it back
[1:02:40] so i just sit down
[1:02:43] and after that
[1:02:46] i listened
[1:02:50] what i heard
[1:02:51] again
[1:02:53] had me thinking and something happened
[1:02:55] on the end it's still me
[1:02:57] and they say well come back to silver
[1:03:00] sunday
[1:03:02] i did
[1:03:03] i was in december
[1:03:06] and that sunday after that service
[1:03:08] i got about that in the name of jesus
[1:03:10] christ
[1:03:11] and from then
[1:03:13] that was it now
[1:03:14] after i got baptized
[1:03:18] i don't know you felt good i i mean
[1:03:21] you're lucky on clock night i i like i
[1:03:23] said at that time you're on fire
[1:03:27] you know now
[1:03:28] i've feel
[1:03:30] i honestly believe that
[1:03:32] after
[1:03:34] getting baptized starting to read the
[1:03:36] messages and things like that
[1:03:39] i
[1:03:40] believe that i really was
[1:03:43] among
[1:03:45] angels
[1:03:46] and
[1:03:47] there was no way i was thinking that
[1:03:50] you know people could do wrong
[1:03:53] i
[1:03:54] maybe myself was naive at the time
[1:03:57] but when i listened to the word of god
[1:04:00] this is the barbara message and i
[1:04:02] started taking and god said to do things
[1:04:04] to me i really thought that
[1:04:07] among angels people don't lie
[1:04:10] and i was going on that road
[1:04:13] but
[1:04:16] it take her
[1:04:17] while
[1:04:18] then i started to understand the message
[1:04:22] then i started to understand there are
[1:04:24] two kinds of believers
[1:04:26] i
[1:04:27] didn't understand that
[1:04:30] at all
[1:04:32] and as a result of that things start
[1:04:35] happening you start you start going
[1:04:36] through certain things
[1:04:39] and in going through certain things you
[1:04:42] i realize that
[1:04:45] people
[1:04:47] uh start
[1:04:49] your certain behaviors and you start
[1:04:51] hearing things
[1:04:53] in my melting i said what is happening
[1:04:55] here
[1:04:56] but somewhere inside there
[1:04:59] i recognize
[1:05:01] the lord keep
[1:05:06] showing me look at my word
[1:05:10] don't look at anything else
[1:05:12] look and see what i tell you
[1:05:16] now
[1:05:17] i said just to show you this is how god
[1:05:20] helped me come true all the time i mean
[1:05:23] you said uh there was a lot of things i
[1:05:26] meant to bring i can't really talk
[1:05:28] but
[1:05:29] that was my first understanding
[1:05:32] what happened here
[1:05:34] and then he saved him just look at my
[1:05:37] wound
[1:05:38] and i started looking at one word
[1:05:41] now you start seeing all kind of funny
[1:05:43] thing going on
[1:05:45] you're hearing all kind of thing
[1:05:47] but then you see miracles you see this
[1:05:50] so in it
[1:05:52] you start to recognize i started
[1:05:56] what how i could put it it's like god
[1:05:58] starts showing me
[1:06:00] in reality
[1:06:02] the message in other words i will reach
[1:06:05] about three kind of believers i will
[1:06:07] read about certainty and then you will
[1:06:10] see it you will see these things
[1:06:11] happening
[1:06:12] and you realize which i mean this is
[1:06:15] that
[1:06:16] but then as
[1:06:18] there are people that who was around me
[1:06:20] at the time
[1:06:22] they see the same thing they fell off
[1:06:24] the garlic cup
[1:06:27] and but god keeps telling me keep
[1:06:29] watching my will forget what's going on
[1:06:32] at the end of it
[1:06:35] a lot of things keep
[1:06:37] happening i'm going to
[1:06:39] but
[1:06:40] in it all
[1:06:42] coming through years
[1:06:44] of getting that kind of uh now i can see
[1:06:47] that kind of training
[1:06:49] to see a lot of things happening
[1:06:52] take some of the people take something
[1:06:54] to say and sing something like this
[1:06:57] but
[1:06:58] you yourself you you can see the effects
[1:07:01] of it you can feel the effects of it
[1:07:04] but
[1:07:05] for you to stay there
[1:07:08] you have to keep looking at the world
[1:07:11] you have to keep looking and
[1:07:14] after a while you start to realize
[1:07:19] it's a training
[1:07:22] and it comes like many times
[1:07:24] talk about the thing
[1:07:26] it's like
[1:07:29] do not look at the tools
[1:07:32] that god used to train you with
[1:07:35] look at the trainer
[1:07:37] and and
[1:07:39] look
[1:07:40] to hear
[1:07:41] what he is telling you and obey what he
[1:07:44] sees
[1:07:46] because you can look at the tools
[1:07:48] because i keep you lifting higher
[1:07:50] and you put more weight now you will see
[1:07:52] this i am real heavy
[1:07:54] but if you keep looking at the tradition
[1:07:57] the trainer will be telling you what to
[1:07:59] do
[1:08:00] how to do it
[1:08:01] you do not look at the tools because
[1:08:04] you can go back to the tool
[1:08:06] you don't look at the
[1:08:08] the things that is happening and the
[1:08:10] people you might see
[1:08:11] you've been used a certain way to get
[1:08:14] you in a certain way the idea behind
[1:08:17] just stay
[1:08:19] focused looking at the world stay
[1:08:21] focused looking at the trainer listen to
[1:08:24] what you see
[1:08:25] it is the oh and
[1:08:27] i took that principle and that is what
[1:08:30] kept me all these years
[1:08:32] that is one of the things that kept me
[1:08:34] motivated that kept me all these years
[1:08:37] so i have recognized that as you grow
[1:08:42] the test get more
[1:08:45] the trials get more
[1:08:48] i
[1:08:49] understand also i started looking at
[1:08:52] tests and trials and change it to
[1:08:55] training
[1:08:58] because at the end of it god is training
[1:09:00] you for something
[1:09:02] he's not training you just to be no no
[1:09:05] he pick you up here
[1:09:08] justify him wash it out
[1:09:10] pour something because he want to use
[1:09:13] you and i realized that listen to do
[1:09:16] that you have to stay focused
[1:09:19] so in in here is where i'm saying
[1:09:23] because of
[1:09:24] these things that i have learned
[1:09:27] i am i am just sharing this with maybe
[1:09:30] it might help some brother some sister
[1:09:32] some young people in that you're going
[1:09:35] to be coming through with all kinds
[1:09:37] you're going to see organic
[1:09:39] people might be doing all kinds of
[1:09:40] things
[1:09:41] if you keep looking at the tool
[1:09:44] that
[1:09:45] that is being used because you but you
[1:09:49] always say the test is always for you
[1:09:51] the training is for you
[1:09:54] whatever however however much weight has
[1:09:57] come upon you
[1:09:59] that is for you
[1:10:00] do not look at the two
[1:10:03] look remember the words that the trainer
[1:10:05] keep focus on between yeah i focus on
[1:10:08] the treatment and this is what has
[1:10:11] brought me to this point this is what
[1:10:12] has kept me and it's still keeping me
[1:10:15] yeah there are other things that i
[1:10:16] learned as i grow but i just want to say
[1:10:18] this man
[1:10:19] so that it will encourage somebody
[1:10:22] that
[1:10:23] who might be going through certain
[1:10:25] things who might can't understand what
[1:10:27] is happening with them
[1:10:40] [Music]
[1:10:41] don't do that
[1:10:43] look
[1:10:44] at the trainer
[1:10:47] look
[1:10:48] and see what he is telling you and obey
[1:10:52] it is the only way you're going to get
[1:10:53] up
[1:10:54] if you're chill from there
[1:11:08] this is what it takes
[1:11:11] for us to get optimistic look at the
[1:11:14] world continue look at it keep your idea
[1:11:18] and follow the instructions
[1:11:20] it might take long
[1:11:22] it might take it it might take whatever
[1:11:25] but as
[1:11:27] as as the little excerpt was said
[1:11:31] god promised he will never leave he will
[1:11:34] be always there so once he is always
[1:11:36] there
[1:11:37] no for a fact
[1:11:39] that listen
[1:11:41] that's it
[1:11:42] if he will accomplish he will finish it
[1:11:45] and this all you have to do is suggest
[1:11:47] submit yourself and keep looking at the
[1:11:50] trader so i i don't want to take up much
[1:11:52] time again all i am saying at the end of
[1:11:55] it
[1:11:56] look
[1:11:57] keep looking at the trainer
[1:12:00] keep looking and listening to what he
[1:12:02] said it is the only way to get out so
[1:12:06] or whoever going through the little
[1:12:08] problem forget what you see
[1:12:10] you know forget who's doing this
[1:12:13] stay keep your eyes on the trainer keep
[1:12:16] your eyes
[1:12:17] on what he's saying
[1:12:19] do not look at the two
[1:12:21] god bless you
[1:12:25] god bless you brother parents
[1:12:28] we really really appreciate the words
[1:12:30] that you've shared really appreciate the
[1:12:33] personalized story starting from from i
[1:12:36] don't want to see the beginning but
[1:12:38] starting from a point that we could
[1:12:40] relate and understand
[1:12:42] right and
[1:12:44] even as you reference the excerpt
[1:12:47] you know i just want to come back to the
[1:12:48] points
[1:12:49] one of the things he highlighted and it
[1:12:51] was shown in the exclusives as well
[1:12:53] where all the things we go through good
[1:12:56] bad and different all the ups and downs
[1:12:58] the challenges the trials the things we
[1:13:00] made not understand what he actually
[1:13:02] says is that it's all
[1:13:04] meant for the glory of god
[1:13:07] even the stories we hear the witnessing
[1:13:09] we hear the testimonies we hear as we
[1:13:12] share it is not because we're trying to
[1:13:15] turn ourselves into celebrities it's not
[1:13:17] like we're trying to find out who has
[1:13:18] the best story it reminds me of the
[1:13:21] three wise men
[1:13:22] they came inspired of god they came
[1:13:25] bearing gifts they didn't necessarily
[1:13:27] compare notes and say you know what gold
[1:13:30] seems more more important so it seems
[1:13:32] more precious than frankincense or move
[1:13:35] but at the end of the day they brought
[1:13:37] their gifts came bearing gifts for the
[1:13:39] glory of god and tonight i think it was
[1:13:42] so tremendous i want to personally thank
[1:13:44] brother andy henry sister donald k clark
[1:13:47] brother parents clark i mean they really
[1:13:51] shared they really gave they really
[1:13:53] expressed in their own personal way the
[1:13:55] way that god has impacted their lives
[1:13:57] and i think it is not just deserving of
[1:14:00] a round of applause but i think it's
[1:14:01] really impactful and i think and i hope
[1:14:04] that somebody listening whether
[1:14:06] listening now or may listen afterwards
[1:14:08] would be helped with would be able to
[1:14:10] relate and would be impacted positively
[1:14:13] at this time we want to wind things down
[1:14:16] i know if you feel like i feel we could
[1:14:17] go for another two hours
[1:14:19] i i know you probably feel like we could
[1:14:21] call four five six persons again
[1:14:24] but i think we have to take it in bite
[1:14:26] size chunks we have to internalize that
[1:14:29] which was said and we have to
[1:14:31] to use with use wisdom as well at this
[1:14:34] time i want to invite brother stephen
[1:14:37] oliveira

[1:14:40] clothes and we will close our program
