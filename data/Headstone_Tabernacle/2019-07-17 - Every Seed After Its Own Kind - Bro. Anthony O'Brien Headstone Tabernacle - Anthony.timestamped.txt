[17:01] Buca Matthew in chapter 2 tee want to
[17:06] read from verse 24 they and just down to
[17:09] 30 men so Matthew to Tina was 24 which
[17:15] says another parable put he forth unto
[17:17] them saying the kingdom of heaven is
[17:20] likened unto a man which sowed good seed
[17:22] in his field but while men slept his
[17:26] enemy came and sowed tares among the
[17:29] wheat and went his way and when he and
[17:34] when the blade was sprung up and brought
[17:35] forth fruit then appeared the tares also
[17:38] so the servants and the house holder
[17:41] came and said unto Him sooth is not
[17:43] those are so good seed and I feel from
[17:46] Wednesday and hadatha taters he sent
[17:48] unto them an enemy had done this and a
[17:51] servant said unto Him wilt thou then
[17:53] that we go and gather them up but he's
[17:56] an e-blast while he got him up gather up
[17:58] the tares ye root up also the wheat with
[18:01] them let both grow together until the
[18:05] harvest and in a time of the harvest I
[18:08] will say to the Reapers gather ye
[18:10] together first the tares and bind them
[18:13] it bundles to burn them but gather the
[18:16] wheat into my

[18:31] read a few verses they were also from
[18:33] verse 16 and it says he shall know them
[18:38] by their fruits
[18:39] do men gather grapes or phones of grapes
[18:44] of thorns or figs of thistles even so
[18:48] every good tree bringeth forth good
[18:49] fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth
[18:52] evil fruit a good tree cannot bring
[18:55] forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt
[18:57] tree bring forth good fruit every tree
[19:01] that bringeth not forth good fruit is
[19:03] hewn down and cast into the final
[19:06] wherefore by their fruits ye shall know
[19:09] them a man they got a blessing - lets

[27:59] attention to a nine the mighty hand of

[32:23] flesh no flesh and blood didn't reveal
[32:26] it it's now right we know the story
[32:28] Jesus took his disciples out and say who
[32:30] do men say I am some say this they
[32:32] didn't know see it were caught walk with
[32:35] Him two about three and a half years

[32:52] stories of others they were believin on
[32:54] the testimonies of others brother song
[32:57] who said this brother so-and-so said

[37:51] book I've seen Matthew it's not right
[37:53] hallelujah I now watch an enemy had done
[37:57] this thing remember the power bill here
[37:58] he talked about but Jesus said that you
[38:02] know the husband man went forth so
[38:03] scenes and then here come the enemy
[38:06] night so tears it's not right in those
[38:08] in the field isn't all right and we see
[38:11] down in Genesis where God establishes
[38:14] man in the beginning isn't that right
[38:15] Adam and Eve were then called with his
[38:17] family a man holiday and they had a
[38:19] prophecy now they were supposed to
[38:21] MultiPlan replenish he's now right and
[38:24] they were there just waiting on their
[38:26] word it's not right to come to show them
[38:29] how these things would be all right
[38:33] wasn't supposed to come my intellect
[38:34] like what did the serpent did he used
[38:38] reasoning and he deceived Eve a man is
[38:42] now right please go over the prophet
[38:44] said if that didn't happen we're a
[38:45] comfort by the spoken word it's now all
[38:48] right praise God we wouldn't have known
[38:49] sin and I've always fallen condition and
[38:52] things demonize now right remember God
[38:54] had it to be that way so that we could
[38:57] understand the grace of God it's now
[38:59] right hallelujah
[39:01] knows going through Genesis just
[39:03] recently and down in Genesis there when
[39:05] you look at the beginning it comes up
[39:07] and he says go on pre to the heavens God
[39:09] created the earth God created the lights
[39:11] isn't that right but when it start to
[39:12] come into talking about man
[39:15] and the generations of man and the
[39:17] generations are gone had spoken into the
[39:19] existence it turns from gone into the
[39:21] Lord God isn't arrived his title
[39:23] suddenly changed all the time he was God
[39:25] the creature but now he became the Lord
[39:28] God meaning he had subjects meaning he
[39:31] had sons he had a family
[39:32] hallelujah his title now change from
[39:35] just being God alone to be in the Lord
[39:37] caught caught with his family that's
[39:39] what he wanted all the time he wanted to
[39:42] beat you over holily is now right and
[39:44] now we see
[39:45] when a serpent come in and sin come into
[39:47] the picture God could now become so many
[39:49] more things
[39:50] he moved for me in the Lord God to being
[39:53] God the Savior to being God the Redeemer
[39:55] to being caught a restorer to being
[39:57] caught the Potter to being called a
[40:00] Baptizer to be in court the lights the
[40:03] pillar of fire the holy one the wheel in
[40:07] the middle of louie the rock we need to
[40:09] rock hallelujah he could be all these
[40:12] things to you oh because you have known
[40:16] in front beginning Oh hallelujah because
[40:19] we bypass our theophany and drop down
[40:21] into the time here to be tested and to
[40:24] be proven even isn't that right the
[40:27] Prophet said why would God do that
[40:28] hallelujah praise God he wanted to prove
[40:30] a bride a man and she was not like Eve
[40:33] and she would not be deceived and she
[40:36] would not take the devil's lie so in
[40:38] order to do that what he did you

[50:45] hallelujah in order for these signs to
[50:47] follow them hallelujah have to wait for
[50:50] the power to come down because they
[50:52] couldn't do it in themselves they know
[50:54] they couldn't heal the sick they know
[50:56] they couldn't raise the dead cast out
[50:57] devils or do any of these things that
[50:58] Jesus said they would go into all the
[51:00] world and do isn't that right you told

[51:13] about it hallelujah is not isn't there
[51:17] to go pass intellectual thing no no no
[51:19] no they had to prove hallelujah because
[51:22] what ministry they were trying to attain
[51:24] to was the same ministry that Christ had
[51:27] when he was on earth it's not right and
[51:30] when Christ was on the earth he came
[51:31] healing the sick reason at that castle
[51:33] Devils and he said these same thing
[51:35] you gonna do also so they knew they
[51:37] couldn't do it in themselves when they
[51:39] open he open their understanding to
[51:41] understand them I want the magnitude of
[51:43] what was to take place brother they will
[51:45] fix on that upper room they couldn't
[51:47] leave there until they got what they
[51:50] came for and so it is tonight we've got
[51:53] to stay that altar until we kept what we
[51:57] come for until the seat of God in you is
[52:00] activated by fire oh because you

[52:05] supposed to do thank God for opening on
[52:17] this all understanding to what to
[52:19] Malachi form and his ministry and what
