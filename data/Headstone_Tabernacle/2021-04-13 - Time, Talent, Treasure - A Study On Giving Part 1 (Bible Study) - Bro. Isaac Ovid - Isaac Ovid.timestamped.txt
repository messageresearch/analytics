[11:09] to see
[11:10] more of your word lord to think that
[11:13] your thoughts are higher than our
[11:14] thoughts lord and yet you have found a
[11:18] way to
[11:19] express your thoughts to us through your
[11:21] word
[11:22] lord your word gives us insight into how
[11:25] you
[11:26] think how you feel what you want to
[11:28] accomplish and achieve
[11:30] the purpose that you have lord both for
[11:33] your kingdom lord and for your plans
[11:36] lord and the unfolding of these plans
[11:38] lord and even
[11:39] more than that as it's relevant to us
[11:41] lord your
[11:42] words and your thoughts lord indicate
[11:44] how we should live and
[11:46] what you want for us and want to
[11:48] accomplish through us so
[11:50] lord may you touch us tonight and lord

[11:54] pages of the bible may you change and
[11:56] transform lives
[11:57] lord we turn the corner in the
[11:59] supernatural realm and we are so
[12:01] grateful we are so blessed we are so
[12:03] privileged
[12:04] lord to see what we see and to hear what
[12:06] we hear lord may you bless everyone
[12:08] tonight under the sound of my voice
[12:10] lord anyone who may come back to this

[12:28] we need to improve what we need to
[12:30] change
[12:30] lord we want to be able to give an
[12:31] account lord for this great message
[12:34] that you are brought to us through this
[12:36] prophet lord this malachi
[12:38] 4 prophet this saint luke 17 30 prophet
[12:40] this revelation
[12:41] 10 prophet lord that you lord send a
[12:44] message to us to catch a bride that we
[12:46] could see
[12:47] lord in the written word things that
[12:49] others cannot see
[12:50] lord because we have the eyesight lord
[12:52] true that fought light lord true
[12:55] lord that prophetic eye to see lord what
[12:57] you want us to see so may you
[12:59] speak to us tonight and lord open our
[13:02] understanding that we
[13:03] could be stronger in our faith lord and
[13:06] rest confident that
[13:07] lord you are more than able to do what
[13:09] you said you would do we commit the
[13:11] study tonight into your hands in the
[13:13] precious name of jesus christ amen
[13:15] and amen and amen it's certainly a great
[13:17] privilege to be here thank you so much
[13:19] uh
[13:20] for your support for your commitment
[13:23] for your dedication and we are trusting
[13:26] god to do something tremendous
[13:28] uh for us tonight and um really
[13:31] i don't know um how you feel but i was
[13:34] truly truly truly blessed
[13:36] uh uh on sunday service it was truly a
[13:39] wonderful
[13:40] uh masterpiece not just of a message but
[13:43] to see
[13:44] you know how god is unfolding so much uh
[13:47] in the wood to us
[13:48] and the importance of of that daily life
[13:52] that that priestly responsibility that
[13:54] we have
[13:55] and that golden altar and you have to go
[13:58] past the
[13:59] brazen altar and and all that god has
[14:02] laid out in his plans for us that
[14:04] that we could live a certain way and and
[14:06] there's so much that was said
[14:08] you know in in the message on sunday and
[14:11] i want to encourage you
[14:13] if you have not um seen sunday's message
[14:16] you need to see it
[14:17] and if you haven't seen it and you just
[14:19] see it you didn't see that at least
[14:21] twice
[14:21] and if you were there you saw it before
[14:23] you need to get it again because there
[14:24] are a lot of lessons in there
[14:26] i spoke about all of it i said we could
[14:28] spend a whole month um
[14:30] going through that message and and
[14:32] coming out of that message because
[14:33] there's
[14:34] there's a lot in there you know and you
[14:36] know coming down towards
[14:38] um the end of the message on sunday but
[14:41] ovid was speaking about
[14:43] god's anger was kindled kindled
[14:47] at the attitude of the people and the
[14:50] murmuring
[14:51] of the people and god was so angry
[14:55] that he just acted out judgment
[14:59] without hesitation you know what we
[15:01] would see a scripture unfolded
[15:03] over i think 14 000 people were killed
[15:06] and what stopped that judgment
[15:08] was when moses instructed aaron to go
[15:12] and get the incense you know and stand
[15:14] between
[15:15] the living and the dead stand between
[15:18] judgment
[15:19] and the people you know and i was
[15:20] sharing with you having a fellowship and
[15:22] i was saying you know
[15:24] not any and anybody could have gone and
[15:26] take the incense
[15:27] you had to be qualified to go get it you
[15:29] know and and when you really think about
[15:31] it
[15:32] you know you couldn't be a priest if
[15:34] your life was not in order
[15:35] you know so to be able to go to bring
[15:38] incense and to stand
[15:40] you know for anybody and and in our case
[15:42] now that we are kings and priests
[15:44] it means that our lives must be in such
[15:46] a way that
[15:47] we could be counted worthy to be able to
[15:50] go
[15:50] you know into that place and be able to
[15:53] to to take the incense and
[15:55] you know and stand for our family and
[15:56] stand for our loved ones you know and
[15:58] it is such a reminder to us you know but
[16:01] robert said that the christian walk
[16:03] is a life of maintenance you know god
[16:06] starts the fire he starts to work in us
[16:08] there's nothing that we could do to
[16:10] start the work we didn't call ourselves
[16:12] we we didn't we didn't we
[16:14] we we didn't find a message a message
[16:16] found us
[16:17] you know god has done his part he said
[16:19] all that the father has given me must
[16:21] come
[16:22] you know but there's a great work of
[16:24] maintenance you know
[16:25] of of the morning sacrifice and even
[16:27] sacrifice and there's so much
[16:29] so much in there so um by the grace of
[16:32] god
[16:33] um i i didn't know the extent of what
[16:36] we would have preached on sunday um but
[16:39] i
[16:39] shared with him you know a certain
[16:41] direction that i wanted to go with bible
[16:43] study and i realized that
[16:45] you know by the grace of god we are we
[16:47] are overlapping in so many ways
[16:49] so i want to connect um to what borobi
[16:52] preached
[16:52] um on sunday and i'll have to divide
[16:56] this bible study into
[16:58] into two parts i believe by the grace of
[17:00] god and i said to him
[17:02] before this study i say i've have so
[17:04] many pieces
[17:05] of the ways that this can go so i'm
[17:08] trusting god to
[17:09] to help me take it through to be a
[17:11] blessing and an encouragement to us
[17:13] you know and um you know
[17:16] we really want to thank god for the
[17:18] convention as well the ivory coast
[17:20] convention and the inspiration of the
[17:21] convention and
[17:23] and um what a blessing it was a
[17:24] tremendous blessing so
[17:26] god is is good he's good to us to be
[17:29] able to give us the opportunity
[17:31] to feast you know at jesus table you
[17:34] know and get encouragement
[17:36] and to get insight and to be inspired in
[17:39] the middle of this pandemic and
[17:41] you know i saw the evening report with
[17:44] how many cases
[17:45] um and it looks as if we on an upward
[17:47] trend
[17:48] you know and i i i caught a little piece
[17:51] of the global news this evening
[17:53] and you know on a global level you know
[17:56] they're saying that
[17:57] you know the pandemic is at a critical
[17:59] turning point
[18:00] you know where worldwide cases are
[18:02] rising you know
[18:04] in some countries more than others and
[18:06] it's just a
[18:07] a tough situation and it's a situation
[18:10] and you see
[18:11] the frustration you see the anger you
[18:13] see the despair you see
[18:15] you know different countries taking
[18:17] different actions with
[18:18] with the different types of vaccines you
[18:20] know um
[18:21] you know the u.s saying not this vaccine
[18:24] and this other one
[18:25] and not this age are not this and only
[18:27] this age should take it and this aid
[18:29] shouldn't take it and
[18:30] and and it really requires a deeper
[18:33] anchor than the news
[18:34] to be able to stand now it takes a
[18:37] deeper anchor
[18:38] than somebody's recommendation and
[18:40] somebody's advice
[18:42] because man can't even agree with man
[18:45] and in one minute he
[18:46] will have the organization saying
[18:47] something would in the next minute the
[18:49] u.s saying something canada is saying
[18:51] something you know the canada approved
[18:53] the astrazeneca virus the u.s has not
[18:55] approved
[18:56] it different countries and and you see a
[18:58] situation where who do you go
[19:00] to who is right who has the right answer
[19:03] who will you trust
[19:04] where will your fate rest will it rest
[19:07] on the system
[19:08] on the government or the on the doctor
[19:10] on the health ministry
[19:11] will it with it rest where because you
[19:13] don't know the agenda you don't know
[19:16] the purpose you don't know what's behind
[19:18] it there are things that are not
[19:19] available to us with natural eyesight
[19:22] but we thank god that because of
[19:23] spiritual hindsight
[19:25] and spiritual eyesight and spiritual
[19:27] insight
[19:28] we can rest our faith and our trust in
[19:31] god
[19:31] who has kept us thus far and who is a
[19:34] god of preservation he's a god of
[19:36] healing
[19:36] he's a god of deliverance he's a god of
[19:38] restoration and god wants us to put
[19:41] our trust in him you know and if you put
[19:44] your trust in him
[19:46] that is a true walk of faith you know a
[19:48] true walk of faith is when
[19:50] you cannot see him and somebody said to
[19:52] me recently
[19:53] he said if you close your eyes can you
[19:55] see
[19:56] i see well obviously if you close the
[19:58] eyes you can't see see well that's what
[20:00] the faith walk is
[20:01] you know you close your eyes and you
[20:03] begin to walk
[20:04] and that is very difficult it's very
[20:07] difficult
[20:08] to just close your eyes and and
[20:11] and walk and we read it in scripture to
[20:14] walk
[20:14] by faith and not by sight but if i tell
[20:17] you now close your eyes and walk around
[20:19] your house
[20:20] you know it it it takes you will do it
[20:23] with a little bit of caution
[20:25] because you're not familiar to walking
[20:28] or with walking without looking
[20:30] you depend on sight to make a lot of
[20:32] decisions you depend on
[20:34] sight to know when to cross the road you
[20:36] depend on sight
[20:37] to know if if your number is called you
[20:39] depend on sight for all these things and
[20:41] god is
[20:42] is looking for us to walk by feet and
[20:45] faith is a walk of trust
[20:47] in him to take us where we need to be to
[20:49] help transform our thinking to
[20:51] transform our attitude to transform our
[20:54] approach
[20:54] you know so i want to encourage you
[20:56] tonight with this
[20:58] with this teaching it is somewhat uh how
[21:01] do i say
[21:02] it it is it is a teaching that i have
[21:04] not seen done
[21:05] much um a lot of people
[21:08] you know don't spend time studying it
[21:12] but i saw it coming out of easter
[21:14] and some of my own you know looking at
[21:16] the scripture and then when i saw what
[21:17] beloved approached it
[21:19] um so i want to take a a study tonight
[21:23] uh if i wanted to give it a title it's
[21:26] the title is time
[21:28] talent and treasure a study of giving
[21:32] part one time
[21:35] talent and treasure a study of giving
[21:40] part one and you know sometimes you only
[21:45] see things when you really look for it
[21:47] which means
[21:48] it may not be obvious but it's only when
[21:50] you begin to look for certain things you
[21:51] begin to see things
[21:53] in scripture and in your words so i want
[21:55] to i want to start off
[21:57] by connecting as well to easter
[22:00] and understanding for us
[22:04] that calvary
[22:08] was a sacrifice it is
[22:11] it is it was also a gift it was also
[22:15] god-giving because and i recall as a
[22:18] sunday school student one of the very
[22:19] first scriptures
[22:21] that i learned was sin john
[22:24] you know it john 3 16 for god so loved
[22:27] the world that he gave
[22:29] his only begotten son that whosoever
[22:31] believe it
[22:32] in him should not perish but have
[22:34] everlasting life
[22:36] and in there we see god giving you know
[22:39] and we know through scripture
[22:41] uh paul would reference jesus saying it
[22:43] is better to
[22:45] give than to receive and we live in a
[22:48] very selfish world
[22:50] you know we live in a very selfish world
[22:53] you know and i was having a conversation
[22:55] recently with someone
[22:56] and they were describing a situation
[22:58] they had with somebody else
[23:00] and i s and i said to him that's our
[23:02] next level of selfishness boy
[23:03] i say savages you would you say boy i
[23:05] don't have the word for that boy that is
[23:07] beyond
[23:08] selfishness you know and it kind of
[23:11] stood with me it stirred me a bit about
[23:14] selfishness and what selfishness is what
[23:17] selfishness does
[23:18] what selfishness causes and sometimes to
[23:21] look at something you need to look at
[23:23] the opposite of it
[23:24] so if the opposite of being selfish is
[23:27] being
[23:28] a giver you know there are there are
[23:31] things that we could give
[23:32] you know so you could give your time and
[23:35] this is where i took the title time
[23:37] you could give your talent and you could
[23:39] give your treasure
[23:42] and in looking through scripture i want
[23:44] to understand how god
[23:46] sees things because my mind was blown
[23:50] when i looked at paul dealing with a
[23:52] specific situation and
[23:54] by the grace of god we'll get to it
[23:55] tonight and
[23:57] it blew my mind how
[24:00] somebody could miss it because you could
[24:03] have certain things lined up a certain
[24:05] way
[24:05] and because of a failure in another
[24:08] aspect of your life
[24:09] god looks at it in a different kind of a
[24:11] way you know
[24:12] so i want to challenge us all because no
[24:16] matter what your position is tonight
[24:18] there are three things that you have
[24:20] that you could give
[24:22] right now you are giving time your
[24:25] presence here
[24:26] is time you are giving of your time
[24:30] to the lord because you are sacrificing
[24:34] other things you could have done with
[24:35] your time
[24:36] there are people who are not here
[24:38] because they have made a choice with how
[24:39] to use their time
[24:41] i can't judge the use of anybody's time
[24:44] because i don't know
[24:45] what else you have going on but the
[24:46] reality is you have a choice with what
[24:49] you do with your time
[24:51] you could choose to give your time to
[24:53] god you could choose to give your time
[24:55] in church you could choose to give your
[24:57] time to support your family
[24:59] you could choose to give time to support
[25:01] your friendships
[25:03] time is a resource time we are living
[25:07] in time as a break from eternity so time
[25:11] is a currency
[25:12] that has a beginning and it has an
[25:14] ending
[25:16] time is like a bank account
[25:20] you are born with an allotment of time
[25:23] but robert speaks of it and he
[25:24] referenced in scripture there are
[25:25] certain barriers
[25:26] that you can't cross boundaries you
[25:28] cannot pass
[25:30] and that's time we say it
[25:33] when we speak at times that when you
[25:34] look at a grave or tombstone
[25:39] you see the year of birth you see the
[25:41] year when someone passes on and you see
[25:43] a dash that separated two numbers
[25:46] and that dash represents all the time
[25:50] that they had on the street that one
[25:53] dash represents the time and how it was
[25:56] spent
[25:58] that dash represents everything that was
[26:01] done
[26:01] within time
[26:05] that time is a cap it's a limit it's a
[26:07] context
[26:08] it's a framework you waste the time
[26:12] it's captured there nobody remembers
[26:15] you use the time effectively use your
[26:17] time wisely
[26:19] it's different it's a legacy it's a
[26:21] testimony
[26:22] it's a story time
[26:25] time your time is connected to your
[26:29] talent
[26:30] because if you have a talent or skill
[26:34] and any gift or talent or skill and
[26:36] we'll get to the scriptures
[26:37] but i feel like to just kind of have a
[26:38] conversation sometime we just want to
[26:40] that's the liberty we could take in
[26:42] these studies i hope you don't mind we
[26:43] can just have a conversation
[26:46] your talent the gift that you
[26:49] didn't give yourself because it's a gift
[26:53] it's a talent it's something that you do
[26:56] that nobody else could do
[26:58] is the way you do something that nobody
[27:00] else could do
[27:01] so you might be a trades person you
[27:04] might be a craftsperson you might be a
[27:06] chef you might be a whatever it is it
[27:08] doesn't matter what it is
[27:11] it doesn't matter if a hundred people
[27:12] have that skill
[27:14] it is not just the skill it is you and
[27:16] the skill
[27:17] makes it different because that is you
[27:20] and the gift that god deposited in you
[27:23] but just as you have a choice with time
[27:27] you have a choice with your talent
[27:32] stories go on and on and on and on and
[27:35] on about musicians
[27:37] in the secular world who many of them
[27:40] speak of i started as a musician in
[27:43] church
[27:46] i can't tell you how many stories i've
[27:48] heard
[27:49] of what we call worldly singers worldly
[27:51] musicians
[27:53] who say well i started playing in church
[27:57] that that's that's where it started that
[27:58] was the beginning of the story
[28:01] but somewhere along the line the story
[28:04] changed on a
[28:05] ph 2 then a chapter was written and a
[28:08] story
[28:09] is crafted and the connection to church
[28:12] or the root or the umbilical cord of
[28:14] what was the beginning
[28:15] is no longer the trajectory they have
[28:18] given up
[28:18] that first love that first connection
[28:20] that was experienced and
[28:22] followed a different pathway in other
[28:25] words they have taken that talent
[28:27] and use it for something else use it for
[28:30] a different
[28:31] impact use it for a different influence
[28:34] use it for a different cause use it for
[28:36] a different purpose
[28:38] the talent is there but the use is a
[28:41] choice
[28:42] i'll say it again the talent is there
[28:45] but the use is a choice
[28:48] one of the hardest things for me is the
[28:50] misappropriation of scripture
[28:54] misuse of scripture misapplication of
[28:57] scripture misrepresentation of scripture
[29:01] as a young bible student as a young
[29:04] student
[29:04] i've heard a lot of people use the
[29:06] scripture gifts and callings are without
[29:10] repentance
[29:12] and i've heard a lot of people use that
[29:16] to mean that people have gifts but they
[29:18] need to repent
[29:22] that is not what that scripture means
[29:25] the scripture
[29:26] gifts and callings are without
[29:28] repentance
[29:29] means that when god gives a gift he god
[29:32] doesn't repent of giving the gift
[29:37] so the gift and the calling is without
[29:40] god's repentance in other words
[29:41] the bible said god repented he made man
[29:44] anybody with me
[29:46] but gifts and callings are without
[29:48] repentance means god doesn't take
[29:50] back the gift or the talent or the skill
[29:53] that he deposits
[29:54] in you
[29:57] it is the same way somebody could have
[29:59] the gift of a musician and they could be
[30:01] a musician in church
[30:02] and there's still a musician in the
[30:03] world the gift is there it is just
[30:06] a different employer
[30:11] different paycheck they move from a
[30:13] reward in heaven to the wages of sin
[30:15] being debt
[30:18] they transferred a different company was
[30:21] the prophet to see a different influence
[30:23] because there are only two influences
[30:26] but the reality is this
[30:28] all of us in this room tonight have time
[30:35] you can't tell me you don't have time we
[30:37] have time
[30:41] and it's how we choose to use the time
[30:44] we have talents different gifts
[30:48] different talents different skills
[30:52] and god is so wonderful he doesn't
[30:54] compare one gift to the other
[30:58] through many scriptures he makes a
[31:01] distinction
[31:02] between the arm and the feet and he
[31:03] knows and he mouth and he gives
[31:05] references and examples to these
[31:06] different things
[31:07] because they all have their purpose they
[31:09] all have their place
[31:10] they're all they all have a part in this
[31:12] whole thing so it's not for me to look
[31:15] at you and you to look at me or look at
[31:16] somebody else
[31:17] it is god gives gifts and talents god
[31:20] gives
[31:21] time and just some people use their time
[31:24] better than others
[31:25] some people use their gifts and talents
[31:27] better than others anybody with me
[31:29] tonight we are trying to go into a study
[31:33] of giving and i would see
[31:34] by the grace of god because i just
[31:36] feeling you know
[31:38] someone whether you really rob where is
[31:39] the wrestling mulberry tree yeah
[31:41] yeah your movie when you russell you
[31:43] know just to kind of have a conversation
[31:45] before we get into the scriptures and
[31:46] see
[31:47] which ones we're going to get into
[31:48] tonight time
[31:50] time time talent
[31:53] skill gift god gives you
[31:56] what you need to have to achieve what
[31:59] you need to achieve
[32:01] but ibraham would reference the
[32:05] challenge of the award
[32:07] challenges of the hour challenges of
[32:10] today
[32:13] what a husband needs now to be a good
[32:15] husband is different from what a husband
[32:17] needed
[32:17] 20 30 years ago to be a good husband
[32:21] the skills that are required to be a
[32:24] successful
[32:25] entrepreneur or accountant or
[32:28] or chef or whatever it is because
[32:30] knowledge has increased
[32:32] they have different things you need to
[32:33] do you can't operate on the principle
[32:35] that existed
[32:36] if new principles exist now that require
[32:39] new things
[32:40] anybody with me time talent and last
[32:44] treasure
[32:46] what do we treasure what do we do with
[32:49] our treasure
[32:50] what is your treasure
[32:54] is it is it yours what do you do with it
[32:57] how do you use your resources
[32:59] i believe in the last bible study we
[33:01] read scripture where jesus said listen
[33:03] if you can't even manage the
[33:05] natural treasure how you can manage your
[33:08] spiritual treasure
[33:10] so if you can manage your financial
[33:12] resources if you don't
[33:14] understand where it comes from
[33:17] understand why you have it understand
[33:19] how i want you to operate with it
[33:21] understand the principles that you're
[33:23] operating with
[33:26] you will miss the mark of your purpose
[33:28] on the it
[33:30] time talent treasure a study on giving
[33:34] part one i want to jump into some
[33:38] scriptures i want to try to see
[33:39] if i could go through this part a little
[33:42] quickly because i really want to get
[33:43] to the new testament but over it blew me
[33:46] away
[33:47] uh in that message on sunday and
[33:52] you know he read a scripture at the
[33:55] beginning of his message in exodus 25.
[33:59] and i want to just touch it a little bit
[34:03] and um before i get a little deeper into
[34:06] this thought tonight i hope you bear
[34:07] with me
[34:08] and i hope you're you bring your bibles
[34:11] and
[34:11] and you'll love this word and this word
[34:15] as you see the clarity of how god
[34:17] unfolds things
[34:18] you know that you begin to get a deeper
[34:20] appreciation of what it means to us
[34:22] and i don't know how it was for you but
[34:25] sunday's message really brought back to
[34:27] me how
[34:28] detailed god is i don't know if anybody
[34:31] else caught that
[34:33] that when god was describing the the
[34:35] candlesticks and
[34:37] describing these steves and describing
[34:39] how
[34:41] how much goal and the way it was and how
[34:44] it was one piece and
[34:45] you couldn't come and say well lord
[34:47] already you know it done it done
[34:49] that is not what i asked for i was very
[34:51] specific
[34:52] with what i wanted it you know there are
[34:54] people who you give things to do for you
[34:57] eh brother mikey imagine here you get
[35:00] something to walk with you
[35:01] and i tell them i want you to put on
[35:02] your work a certain way i wouldn't do
[35:04] the work i said no way
[35:05] i i've given it instructions i want this
[35:08] color tile
[35:09] and then this color tile cut this way
[35:11] and i want you to grout it this way
[35:13] and i might do a half piece work you say
[35:15] well that is not what i ask you to do
[35:18] the way god described what he wanted was
[35:21] so
[35:22] detailed it makes me wonder how detailed
[35:25] he is with describing
[35:27] us when god thinks about us and the
[35:29] details he put into us
[35:31] and the qualities he wants in us if he
[35:34] would spend so much time
[35:36] on the natural tabernacle how much
[35:39] more would he spend on the living
[35:41] tabernacles anybody with me
[35:42] tonight shaping and honing and and
[35:45] perfecting this
[35:46] this living tabernacle that he could
[35:49] dwell in anybody with me
[35:51] so just to to to know connect about
[35:54] uber's message and then
[35:55] to go a little bit there you know but we
[35:58] read in exodus 25
[35:59] and it said and the lord speak unto
[36:01] moses i want to rewind a little bit
[36:04] to give a bit of context so
[36:07] in exodus 24
[36:10] down to the tlm the end of exodus 24
[36:13] from verse this is verse 15 and
[36:17] moses i'm going to go to this path a
[36:18] little faster because i want to get in
[36:20] the new testament right
[36:21] exodus 24 and verse 15 and moses went up
[36:24] into the mount and a cloud
[36:26] covered the mount and the glory of the
[36:29] lord aboard
[36:30] upon mount sinai and the cloud covered
[36:33] it six days and the seventh day he
[36:34] called unto moses out of the midst of
[36:36] the cloud
[36:37] and the sight of the glory of the lord
[36:40] was like devouring
[36:41] fire on the top of the mount in the eyes
[36:44] of the children of israel
[36:46] and moses went into the midst of the
[36:48] cloud and got him
[36:50] into the mount and moses was in the
[36:52] mount 40 days
[36:54] and 40 nights so i want to give a
[36:57] context
[36:58] to where moses was when god is now
[37:01] speaking to him
[37:02] starting in in exodus 25
[37:05] and we would have read this on sunday
[37:07] and i'm going to kind of just browse
[37:09] through some of these quickly to just
[37:10] kind of paint a picture
[37:12] and the lord speak unto moses saying
[37:13] speak unto the children of israel
[37:15] that they bring me an offering of every
[37:18] man that giveth it
[37:19] willingly with his heart you shall take
[37:22] my offering
[37:23] i want to underline the word willingly
[37:25] because
[37:26] giving whether it is time whether it is
[37:29] talent
[37:29] or it is treasure god don't want you to
[37:32] give it
[37:32] because you're feeling pressed to give
[37:34] it god don't want you to give it because
[37:36] you're feeling convicted to give it
[37:38] god want you to give it because you
[37:39] understand the connection between what
[37:41] you're given
[37:42] unto the lord and a willingness to hit
[37:44] anybody with me
[37:46] so god had to lay down the condition
[37:49] upon which he operates and he starts to
[37:51] build a framework
[37:52] of why he wants it right he said speak
[37:55] unto the children of israel that they
[37:56] may bring me an offering of every man
[37:58] that given it
[37:59] willingly with his heart he shall take
[38:01] my offering
[38:02] and this is the offering which we shall
[38:04] take of them
[38:05] gold and silver and brass and blue
[38:09] and purple and scarlet and fine linen
[38:12] and goats here and ram skins dyed red
[38:15] and badger skins and and wood oil
[38:18] for the light
[38:19] spices and this is where you see the
[38:21] detail of god
[38:22] yes in bring whatever you want bring it
[38:25] how you want it
[38:26] he is being very specific and for sweet
[38:29] incense
[38:29] onix stones and stones will be set in
[38:32] the ephod
[38:33] and in the breastplate and let them make
[38:35] me a sanctuary that i may dwell among
[38:37] them
[38:38] all right and he goes on and on so the
[38:40] wall of exodus 25
[38:42] is focused on what god wants to see
[38:46] but ambrose would have stopped i think
[38:48] around
[38:49] if i'm right uh around verse 22
[38:53] of of exodus 25 round 22. so i i went on
[38:57] and reading
[38:58] and it goes on if you read beyond it and
[39:00] you can do it in your own private study
[39:02] down to verse 29 and downside make the
[39:04] dishes thereof
[39:06] and spoons thereof and covers thereof
[39:09] and bowls thereof to cover with a of
[39:12] pure gold outside make them
[39:14] so so on and on you see god given
[39:17] instructions
[39:18] he said this is what i want i want you
[39:20] to notice the detail he's giving him
[39:22] and then took quickly chapter 26
[39:25] moreover though shall make that
[39:27] tabernacle with 10 curtains
[39:29] of fine twine linen and blue and purple
[39:32] so
[39:33] exodus 25 it starts the whole of exodus
[39:36] 26
[39:37] is more detailed this is like a written
[39:40] blueprint it's like a blueprinted words
[39:43] all right so when you read this the
[39:45] entire of
[39:46] exodus 26 it's explaining
[39:49] the details of the description of this
[39:52] thing but god doesn't stop there no
[39:54] goes on to exodus 27 speaks now about
[39:57] the altar
[39:58] and it goes all even more and and and
[40:01] and not and the breadth of the court and
[40:03] the
[40:03] and i say but wait a minute look at the
[40:06] time
[40:07] and the effort and the care and the
[40:10] level of detail that god wants
[40:12] and how he requires this i want you to
[40:15] catch this now
[40:16] he in order for this to be accomplished
[40:19] he needs three things
[40:21] you need time he needs talent
[40:25] and he needs treasure because that is
[40:27] what he needs to be able to put this in
[40:28] place all right
[40:30] by the time we reach verse 28 he
[40:34] god is no longer describing and i want
[40:36] you to picture this moses is in mount
[40:38] sinai
[40:39] caught up being given instructions on
[40:41] what god wants
[40:44] by the time he reads verse 28 god says
[40:47] and take unto thee aaron thy brother and
[40:49] his sons
[40:50] and he goes on to describe the garments
[40:53] the detail of the garment so he's not
[40:55] even taking him for granted
[40:57] what aaron and the priest supposed to
[40:59] win all right
[41:00] so by the time he reached exodus 20th
[41:02] and was four and these are the garments
[41:04] which they shall make a breastplate and
[41:06] an ephod and a robe
[41:08] an embroidered coat a mitchell and a
[41:10] girdle and thou shall make holy garments
[41:12] for aaron thy brother
[41:14] and his sons that he may minister in
[41:16] unto me in the priest's office and they
[41:18] shall take gold
[41:19] and blue and purple so god keeps
[41:21] building and i want you to see now
[41:23] it is something he's trying to manifest
[41:26] it's something he's trying to display
[41:28] so why
[41:31] this is the kind of stuff why is it god
[41:33] didn't just create and put it there
[41:39] and you begin to understand by the time
[41:41] we reach the new testament
[41:43] that god put us here to achieve certain
[41:45] things
[41:46] not for our glory but for his glory
[41:50] for his honor all right so we're in
[41:53] verse 28
[41:55] uh chapter 28 by by timothy chapter 29
[42:00] it's a whole chapter now on the customs
[42:03] of the unleavened bread
[42:05] the ram and all these sacrifices still
[42:07] supposed to be done
[42:08] by the time you go to exodus 30 he spent
[42:11] an entire chapter speaking about the
[42:13] altar of incense
[42:14] the lava to wash so that they don't die
[42:16] and we went through that on sunday
[42:18] service
[42:18] i want you to see how many chapters god
[42:21] dedicated to this issue of the
[42:23] tabernacle the natural tabernacle
[42:26] the physical tabernacle don't you know
[42:29] you are the tabernacle of the temple of
[42:30] the holy ghost
[42:33] so god is unfolding a plan here okay so
[42:36] let's go on
[42:39] by the time we reach
[42:42] exodus 31 to see
[42:45] how god operates let us take a look at
[42:47] this
[42:48] exodus 31 verse 1 and the lord spake
[42:52] under moses saying see
[42:53] i have called by name bisalir the son of
[42:57] yuri
[42:58] the son of her of the tribe of judah
[43:01] and i have filled him with the spirit of
[43:03] god in wisdom
[43:05] and in understanding and in knowledge
[43:07] and in all manner of workmanship
[43:11] to devise cunning works to work in gold
[43:14] and in silver and in brass and in
[43:17] cutting of stones
[43:18] to suck them and then carving of timber
[43:20] to work in all manner of workmanship
[43:24] and i behold i have given with him
[43:26] aholia
[43:27] the son of so much of the tribe of dan
[43:30] and in the hearts of all that are wise
[43:32] hearted
[43:32] i have put wisdom that they may make all
[43:35] that i have commanded thee
[43:37] so god gave moses a road map the
[43:40] blueprint
[43:41] you tell him take up the treasure the
[43:43] offering
[43:44] for the plan the roadmap it's gonna take
[43:47] time to do it so you need time to do it
[43:49] you need treasure now god describe any
[43:51] talents in them
[43:54] god say i give you a man and i've given
[43:56] you his name who have given you wisdom
[44:01] listen that they make all that i've
[44:03] commanded you verse 7
[44:04] the tabernacle so god now is describing
[44:07] to moses
[44:08] the skilled men and what they will be
[44:11] able to accomplish
[44:12] in verse seven the tabernacle of the
[44:14] congregation
[44:15] and the act of the testimony and the
[44:17] mercy seat
[44:18] that is there thereupon and all the
[44:20] furniture of the tabernacle
[44:22] and the table and his furniture and the
[44:24] pure candlestick with all its furniture
[44:26] and the order of incense and the altar
[44:28] of bird offering with all his funny team
[44:30] and the liver and his foot and the clots
[44:32] of service
[44:33] and the holy garments for aaron the
[44:35] priest and the garments of his sons
[44:37] to minister in the priest's office and
[44:39] the anointing oil
[44:40] and the sweet incense for the holy place
[44:43] according to all that have commanded
[44:45] thee
[44:45] shall they do so god
[44:48] not leaving anything to chance he's
[44:51] telling moses
[44:52] you will pick up the offering this is
[44:54] the plan
[44:55] you're going to have to take time to do
[44:57] it i'm giving you the talent to do it in
[44:59] other words
[44:59] moses is getting instructions on all
[45:03] the resources to be able to achieve
[45:06] god's purpose
[45:08] time talent treasure
[45:12] friends time talent and treasure
[45:15] is the same thing you need for a natural
[45:16] business
[45:19] anything you're trying to achieve you
[45:20] want to build a house you need to get
[45:22] it'll take some time to build your house
[45:25] you're going to have to get somebody
[45:26] scaled to build your house
[45:27] you're going to have to get the
[45:28] resources to build the house anything in
[45:30] life
[45:31] these principles are there so
[45:34] that's 31. interestingly
[45:41] verse 32 so just to seek context
[45:46] imagine this we just went from 25 to 31
[45:52] and for those who see ten commandments
[45:53] ten commandments as you know left out a
[45:55] lot
[45:58] ten commandments portrays moses going up
[46:00] getting the
[46:01] the the two tablets are coming back
[46:03] don't be mounting
[46:05] you now see in the whole picture when
[46:08] moses went up
[46:10] all of this took place before he came
[46:14] down the mountain because verse chapter
[46:17] 32 says and
[46:18] when the people saw that moses delayed
[46:20] to come down
[46:21] out of the mount remember we read in 24
[46:23] he was there 40 days
[46:25] and 40 nights getting the instructions
[46:28] in chapter 25
[46:30] 26 27 28 29
[46:33] 30 31 over the span of 40 days and 40
[46:37] nights
[46:37] moses now wrapping up and while this is
[46:41] going on at some point in time
[46:43] when the people saw that moses delayed
[46:45] to come down
[46:46] out of the mount the people gathered
[46:48] themselves together on the arrow and
[46:50] said unto him
[46:51] up make us gods which shall go before us
[46:55] for as for this moses the man that
[46:58] brought us
[46:59] up out of the land of egypt we what not
[47:01] what has become of him
[47:04] again human behavior moses is gone as
[47:07] far as he concerned
[47:08] we don't know we're gonna be moses let's
[47:09] do something else and everyone said unto
[47:12] them break all the golden earrings which
[47:14] are the
[47:14] on in the ears of your wives of your
[47:16] sons and their daughters and bring them
[47:17] unto me
[47:18] and the people break off the golden
[47:21] earrings which were in the ears and
[47:22] brought them
[47:23] under aaron and he received them at
[47:26] their hand and fashioned it
[47:27] with a graving tool and he made and this
[47:30] is the golem calf
[47:31] i want to highlight something here
[47:32] quickly but over mentioned on sunday as
[47:34] well
[47:35] the children of israel came out of
[47:40] hundreds of years of bondage they had
[47:43] nothing
[47:44] so what they are giving up to make this
[47:47] golden calf is what they took from egypt
[47:50] there's a strong contrast with this
[47:53] passage of scripture here and what we'll
[47:55] get to briefly in exodus 35
[47:59] about the willingness because here it
[48:01] doesn't mention
[48:02] willingness as a condition of people
[48:05] giving
[48:07] it doesn't say iran asks them all those
[48:09] who willing to bring something
[48:12] it doesn't say any people who were
[48:13] willing brought it
[48:16] it it just goes into saying these people
[48:18] just brought gold
[48:19] because this was in their heart to do it
[48:22] anybody with me
[48:24] so it is down to verse 7 the lord said
[48:27] unto moses go get thee down
[48:29] for thy people which god brought us out
[48:31] of the land of egypt have corrupted
[48:33] themselves
[48:34] so i want to now create this picture
[48:37] here you have moses spent
[48:38] 40 days 40 nights not 40 minutes
[48:43] not four minutes 40 days 40 nights in
[48:46] the presence of god
[48:48] god is describing the tabernacle the
[48:51] sacrifice
[48:52] how it's supposed to be and and moses
[48:55] has to now leave that august presence
[48:58] to deal with revelry and chaos and
[49:02] confusion
[49:03] and the people who he believes should be
[49:05] waiting on him to bring the word of the
[49:06] lord
[49:07] but the whole camp back season
[49:12] i don't want to spend too much time
[49:13] there because that's not where i really
[49:15] want to go
[49:16] but it is not until exodus 35
[49:20] that we come back to
[49:23] the closing of the story that begins in
[49:26] 25 with the offering
[49:28] and i want to highlight something here
[49:30] now exodus 35 and moses gathered all the
[49:34] congregation of the children of israel
[49:35] together and said unto them
[49:37] these are the words which the lord have
[49:38] commanded that you should do them
[49:40] and he goes on verse five
[49:43] take e um take thee from among you and
[49:46] offering it to the lord
[49:47] listen again whoever is of a willing
[49:50] heart
[49:53] and that bothered me not in a negative
[49:56] sense
[49:58] but i'm thinking these children of
[50:01] israel
[50:02] didn't earn what they had
[50:06] and the fact that moses have to be
[50:08] seeing willingness
[50:10] speaks to the fact that there would have
[50:12] been people there who were not willing
[50:16] the only time eater mentioned
[50:17] willingness is if there are people who
[50:19] are not
[50:20] willing you know let him bring it an
[50:22] offering of the lord gold and silver and
[50:24] it goes into all of it right
[50:26] so i want to drop down and we're going
[50:27] to bring it close to this section of it
[50:30] verse 20 exodus 35 verse 20
[50:34] and all the congregation of the children
[50:36] of israel departed from the presence of
[50:38] moses
[50:40] verse 21 and there came everyone
[50:44] whose heart stirred him up now
[50:48] i want to pause there the fact that the
[50:51] bible says and they came
[50:52] everyone whose heart stirred him up
[50:56] means that there were people whose
[50:58] hearts were not stood
[51:01] there's no need for it to see
[51:04] whose heart stood him up if everybody
[51:06] hat was stood
[51:08] and they came everyone whose heart stood
[51:11] him
[51:12] up and everyone whom his spirit made
[51:15] willing
[51:16] so it would have those who were not
[51:18] stood it would have those who not
[51:20] willing
[51:21] and they brought the lord's offering to
[51:23] the work of the tabernacle of the
[51:24] congregation
[51:25] and for all his service and for the holy
[51:27] garments
[51:29] and they came listen both men and women
[51:33] as many as were willing-hearted
[51:36] i'm seeing a recurring thing here so you
[51:40] could have time
[51:41] and not be willing you could have talent
[51:45] and not be willing you could have
[51:47] treasure
[51:48] and not be willing
[51:51] moses came from the presence of god and
[51:54] explained to the people
[51:55] check this what it was for what he
[51:58] needed done
[51:59] what god was trying to achieve and you
[52:01] had people who were not willing
[52:05] think about it
[52:12] just dropping quickly to verse 25 and
[52:15] all the women that were wise-hearted did
[52:17] spin with their hands
[52:19] that's talent spinning with your hands
[52:23] is not treasure
[52:25] treasures who bring in gold and these
[52:27] things but all the women ever whites did
[52:29] spin with their hands that is time and
[52:31] that is talent
[52:32] and broad that which they spun both of
[52:35] blue
[52:36] and of purple and of scarlet and of fine
[52:38] linen
[52:39] and all this in verse 26 and all the
[52:42] women
[52:43] whose hearts stirred them up in wisdom
[52:45] sponge go
[52:46] tear so in other words
[52:50] there's a skill to spin and there's a
[52:52] willingness to give the time to spin
[52:54] i want to i want to i want to make your
[52:56] point clear
[52:58] so it means that because only those who
[53:00] had certain
[53:02] in wisdom spun goats here so it'd have
[53:05] some sister somewhere
[53:07] who could spin but because of heart and
[53:09] still
[53:12] anybody with me any house tonight i
[53:15] don't know if this happened
[53:16] i know we never already preached this
[53:18] this way and spend time in this thing
[53:21] but i want you to really consider how
[53:23] you're using your time
[53:24] using your talent are you
[53:28] able to spin goats here whatever that is
[53:31] in your context you know situation but
[53:34] because your heart is still you better
[53:35] find a student tonight
[53:38] because what they were working towards
[53:40] was the kingdom you know
[53:42] it was the tabernacle of the lord it was
[53:45] the whole thing where the holy of holies
[53:47] was
[53:48] and there were people who were not
[53:49] willing who said i have fear nothing
[53:52] tonight you know
[53:53] martial still man
[53:56] i feel less stirring you wasted
[54:00] so i could say it this way we will know
[54:02] if you stood
[54:04] because it will show in how we use your
[54:06] time
[54:08] how we use your talent and how you use
[54:10] it your choice because this is what the
[54:11] script is unfolding here
[54:16] the three great resources that we have
[54:21] your time to pray
[54:24] sunday service brought a sacredness to
[54:27] the role of priests and prayer
[54:29] how much time do you give to prayer
[54:41] verse 29 he's still in exodus 35 verse
[54:43] 29
[54:44] and he true enough israel brought a
[54:46] willing offering unto the lord
[54:48] every man and woman whose heart made
[54:51] them willing
[54:53] to bring for all manner of work which
[54:56] the lord had commanded
[54:57] to be made by the hand of moses
[55:07] can the church say amen so i don't want
[55:10] to jump from
[55:11] the old testament it's another section i
[55:13] want to get to in the old testament but
[55:14] by the grace of god
[55:15] maybe the next teaching but i want to
[55:17] jump to the new testament to kind of
[55:20] begin to bridge this because you have to
[55:23] look at the whole book
[55:24] to kind of see now how things begin to
[55:26] unfold and how it matters to us in this
[55:28] day as well
[55:30] we're talking about time we talk about
[55:32] talent
[55:33] we're talking about treasure and we have
[55:35] established
[55:37] that god and any way moses operated
[55:40] didn't just want the extra time
[55:43] or the extra talent or the extra
[55:46] treasure anybody with me
[55:48] it wasn't the the time that because you
[55:50] have extra time it's why you're
[55:51] here tonight you already didn't have
[55:52] anything to do you know you were just
[55:54] sitting
[55:55] there and you remember bible this wasn't
[55:57] planned
[55:58] you you you want someone talking about
[56:00] time talent and treasure
[56:02] willingness of heart means it's now
[56:04] important to you it's a
[56:05] priority to you you're willing
[56:09] it's important to you so you make the
[56:11] time
[56:12] you make a choice to use your talents
[56:15] your gifts
[56:16] these skills that god give you you don't
[56:18] want to use your talent and skill only
[56:20] for the world
[56:22] what can you do for the lord how can you
[56:25] help somebody
[56:26] how can you have a brother a sister
[56:28] somebody
[56:33] anybody with me
[56:36] there's a few scriptures before i bring
[56:38] to the next section
[56:40] talking about time ephesians 5
[56:44] and verse 15 see that you walk
[56:47] circumspectly not as fools but as wise
[56:51] redeeming the time because the days are
[56:54] evil
[56:56] i want to read that you know i love
[56:57] going to the amplified to really
[56:59] amplified of that
[57:01] therefore see that you walk carefully
[57:05] living life with honor purpose and
[57:08] courage
[57:09] shunning those who tolerate and enable
[57:12] evil
[57:13] not as the unwise but as wise sensible
[57:17] intelligent discerning people making
[57:21] the very most of your time on earth
[57:25] recognizing and taking advantage of
[57:29] each opportunity and using it with
[57:32] wisdom and diligence
[57:34] because the days are filled with evil
[57:37] you hear the quality of that scripture
[57:39] the amplified version of that scripture
[57:43] so we're talking about this time
[57:44] resource
[57:47] and it's so touching because you know
[57:50] our dear friend and brother mundus
[57:53] is in a better place and i was talking
[57:56] to
[57:57] to gideon after the service
[58:01] and gideon said you know what struck him
[58:03] boy
[58:04] when you listen to what was said you
[58:07] could see the testimony and
[58:08] alive and he didn't say you know what i
[58:11] was thinking about
[58:13] what will people say about me boy
[58:19] in other words what people say about you
[58:22] is
[58:23] purely a function of how you use your
[58:25] time talent and treasure you know
[58:33] he was a party man he was a he was a
[58:36] fetter he was a dis he was at that nice
[58:38] time
[58:39] or he was in church
[58:43] in a prayer meeting encouraging somebody
[58:46] seeing what's going on with the
[58:48] brotherhood of fellowship
[58:50] dice time reading his bible
[58:53] in bible study having a positive
[58:56] conversation that time
[59:01] he was gossiping is time all of his time
[59:04] you know
[59:05] because actions live in time i want you
[59:08] to look at your time
[59:13] most people don't do a time audit of
[59:14] their lives
[59:18] it is amazing that very successful
[59:21] people
[59:22] people who run multiple companies you
[59:25] know they do have more time in a day
[59:26] than you do right
[59:27] than i do right people running five six
[59:31] seven 20 companies
[59:33] in the same 24 hours i said that
[59:35] somewhere before
[59:37] somebody's struggling to run their
[59:38] little shop and somebody else
[59:40] at the same time running 29 different
[59:42] businesses
[59:43] 5 000 employees is the same time
[59:48] but they have a deeper understanding of
[59:50] how to use time
[59:54] the bible talks about redeeming the time
[59:56] how we use our time
[59:58] how we spend our time
[1:00:02] our approach to time who do we spend
[1:00:04] time with
[1:00:07] but i'm saying you want to get the holy
[1:00:08] ghost spend time with people who have
[1:00:10] the holy ghost
[1:00:13] you want to learn new things spend time
[1:00:16] with people who can help share
[1:00:17] positive new things
[1:00:20] at the beginning of this pandemic we
[1:00:23] raise the point that
[1:00:24] people doing this pandemic during this
[1:00:26] lock don't do doing being at home
[1:00:28] they would spend their time watching
[1:00:29] youtube watching netflix watching movies
[1:00:32] watching i have other people who pick up
[1:00:34] courses and
[1:00:35] training and they grow and they start a
[1:00:37] business and
[1:00:38] it's the same time
[1:00:42] is this challenging anybody tonight
[1:00:47] the strength of your friendships of your
[1:00:49] relationships
[1:00:50] of your marriage of your connection of
[1:00:53] your fellowship with believers
[1:00:54] all of that is a function of your time
[1:00:58] i don't have any friends in church how
[1:00:59] much time do you spend calling people
[1:01:00] talking to people
[1:01:03] saying hello hi how was your day how was
[1:01:05] your week how are you coping how are you
[1:01:06] managing
[1:01:09] is there anything is there any way i
[1:01:10] could help is there any way i could
[1:01:12] bless you
[1:01:13] you you want me to pray for something
[1:01:15] for you
[1:01:17] that is time are you available for the
[1:01:20] lord
[1:01:23] it's a sacrifice
[1:01:27] anybody with me
[1:01:33] that was ephesians 5 15-16 first
[1:01:36] corinthians 10
[1:01:37] 23
[1:01:40] and this is also tied to time
[1:01:45] and paul is speaking to the corinthians
[1:01:47] all things are lawful for me
[1:01:49] but all things are not expedient all
[1:01:52] things are lawful for me
[1:01:53] but all things edify not and in the
[1:01:56] amplified itself all things are lawful
[1:01:58] that is
[1:01:59] morally legitimate permissible but not
[1:02:01] all things are beneficial
[1:02:03] or or advantageous
[1:02:06] all things are lawful but not all things
[1:02:08] are constructive to character
[1:02:10] and edifying to spiritual life
[1:02:15] so you have to know what are the
[1:02:17] activities
[1:02:18] the actions that would qualify as
[1:02:22] constructive to character and edifying
[1:02:25] the spiritual life
[1:02:28] i look forward to bible studies maybe
[1:02:31] more than
[1:02:31] some than some of you not as
[1:02:35] a teacher you know not as the person
[1:02:37] delivering bible study
[1:02:39] but i'm a student of the bible and i
[1:02:42] want to know
[1:02:43] if god give me a road map on how to
[1:02:46] smile
[1:02:47] in a dark moment and how to deal with
[1:02:49] adversity
[1:02:50] and how to make better choices how to
[1:02:52] make better decisions
[1:02:54] how to overcome conflict how to resolve
[1:02:56] challenges
[1:02:57] how to be a better planner i think i
[1:02:59] shared it with you before
[1:03:02] in my business i i personally don't like
[1:03:05] to take notes i'm not a no taker
[1:03:07] fans are real somebody frustrated and
[1:03:10] think they take notes
[1:03:11] you know and but you need notes you need
[1:03:12] to take notes
[1:03:14] so normally i would have somebody help
[1:03:16] take notes in a meeting
[1:03:17] until i see it in scripture how god tell
[1:03:20] moses write it down
[1:03:21] well when i was like a rebuke to me
[1:03:25] that was like your bone muslims right if
[1:03:28] god tell moses who leaving me two
[1:03:30] minutes take notes
[1:03:32] who am i i know i know moses if god tell
[1:03:35] poses i better
[1:03:36] i have to fix my stories i need to get
[1:03:38] better i need to improve
[1:03:40] i have to learn to take notes and that
[1:03:43] that inspires me it challenges me
[1:03:46] because i don't have i'm not leaving two
[1:03:48] million people
[1:03:50] moses had to take notes and he had two
[1:03:51] million people and he could have
[1:03:53] delegated it but god said no more says
[1:03:55] you do it
[1:03:57] i say lord help me
[1:04:01] but the word is there to inspire us
[1:04:04] to maybe do what we never thought we
[1:04:06] could do but when we see god dealing
[1:04:08] with people
[1:04:08] in different ways it will apply to us in
[1:04:10] different ways but coming to bible study
[1:04:13] isn't this qualifying as
[1:04:16] constructive to character and edifying
[1:04:19] the spiritual life
[1:04:21] haven't we spent a lot of time going
[1:04:23] through how god is interested in every
[1:04:25] area every facet of our life
[1:04:27] not just the revelation of the word and
[1:04:29] the mysteries
[1:04:30] but the daily life i'm still trying to
[1:04:33] get to maria taught tonight i reached it
[1:04:35] yet
[1:04:36] right so let's continue a little bit
[1:04:39] here right
[1:04:42] so we talk a little bit about time let's
[1:04:44] talk a little bit about talent
[1:04:45] and we find a touch on talent to a
[1:04:49] little bit of it in romans 12
[1:04:51] but straight to eight just very quickly
[1:04:54] for i say through the grace given unto
[1:04:56] me paul speak to the real monster every
[1:04:58] man that is among you
[1:04:59] not to think of himself more highly than
[1:05:02] he ought to think
[1:05:03] but to think soberly according as god
[1:05:06] had dealt with every man the measure of
[1:05:08] faith
[1:05:09] for as we have many members in one body
[1:05:13] and all members have not the same office
[1:05:16] so we being many are one body in christ
[1:05:20] and everyone remembers one of another
[1:05:23] i said this in the opening statement we
[1:05:25] all have different skills we all have
[1:05:26] different talents
[1:05:27] we all part of the same body we are all
[1:05:29] part of the economy of god we're all
[1:05:31] part of the machine
[1:05:32] of god we are part of the body of christ
[1:05:34] anybody with me
[1:05:35] right having then gifts differing
[1:05:39] according to the grace that is given to
[1:05:41] us
[1:05:42] so you can't learn the gift or acquire
[1:05:46] the gift
[1:05:47] this is gifts we talk about the grace of
[1:05:50] god being given
[1:05:51] anybody with me right heaven then gives
[1:05:55] differing according to the grace that is
[1:05:56] given to us
[1:05:57] whether prophecy let us prophesy
[1:05:59] according to the proportion of faith
[1:06:00] or ministry that is waiting on
[1:06:02] ministering or he that teach it on
[1:06:04] teaching
[1:06:05] or he didn't exhort it on exhortation he
[1:06:07] that give it
[1:06:10] so even giving is a gift
[1:06:13] oh no that's that's a that's a teaching
[1:06:16] on our teaching
[1:06:19] so he is describing a gift of giving
[1:06:23] let me say that one more time he is
[1:06:25] describing gifts
[1:06:27] and in the gifts that he is describing
[1:06:30] he is describing there's
[1:06:31] actually a gift of giving
[1:06:34] so that even if your gift is not
[1:06:36] ministering or exhortation or teaching
[1:06:38] you still have a gift to give of your
[1:06:41] time to give of your talent
[1:06:43] to give of your treasure anybody with me
[1:06:47] he that give it let him do it with
[1:06:49] simplicity he that ruleth
[1:06:52] so there's a gift that is given to rule
[1:06:56] that everybody is a ruler that
[1:06:57] everybody's a manager if it's a leader
[1:06:59] it could be situational but god is
[1:07:02] speaking about gifts he gives to rule
[1:07:03] with diligence
[1:07:04] he that showed mercy with cheerfulness
[1:07:07] all right so i want to just now dive a
[1:07:11] little bit now into my text tonight a
[1:07:12] little bit and i find it very
[1:07:14] interesting situation because a lot of
[1:07:16] people
[1:07:18] may not spend time really looking at
[1:07:19] this uh so i want to go to
[1:07:21] second corinthians
[1:07:26] second corinthians 8.
[1:07:31] and it's a really interesting powerful
[1:07:34] context
[1:07:36] of paul using some great wisdom to
[1:07:39] express something here and um
[1:07:42] i find it's interesting study because it
[1:07:44] it is also i think contextual too
[1:07:47] now and the situation and the pandemic
[1:07:50] and life in general so let's take a look
[1:07:54] at it and i'll be reading from the king
[1:07:55] james and with some port from the
[1:07:57] on the amplified version
[1:08:00] all right so second corinthians 8 and
[1:08:04] verse 1. so paul is speaking
[1:08:07] and if you don't read this slowly and
[1:08:09] carefully
[1:08:10] you will miss how critical what paul is
[1:08:13] addressing here
[1:08:15] so paul is saying in second corinthians
[1:08:17] eight and verse one moreover brethren
[1:08:21] we do you to wit of the grace of god be
[1:08:25] stored
[1:08:26] on the churches of macedonia
[1:08:30] so i actually went and looked
[1:08:33] at the meaning of the word wit in the
[1:08:35] context of the sentence
[1:08:38] and i checked within the amplified to
[1:08:40] understand that we know when god
[1:08:42] picked paul as the first messenger he
[1:08:44] took a man who was a student of gamaliel
[1:08:46] he was a
[1:08:47] he was a writer he was an academic he
[1:08:49] was a theologian
[1:08:50] he's very careful in his choice of words
[1:08:53] the word
[1:08:54] wit w-i-t is typically tied
[1:08:57] when they see somebody there's a quick
[1:08:58] wit it is tied to mean
[1:09:00] a certain level of intellectual
[1:09:02] understanding but the use of the width
[1:09:04] in this context
[1:09:06] really is tied to the association of
[1:09:09] ideas in a manner natural
[1:09:13] but unusual and striking so as to
[1:09:16] produce surprise
[1:09:17] joined with pleasure all right so this
[1:09:20] width
[1:09:21] is is in other words it's presenting an
[1:09:24] idea in a new and unexpected manner
[1:09:27] all right so in the amplifier let me
[1:09:29] read the same one versus one in the
[1:09:32] amplifier
[1:09:33] it says because paul is leaning a
[1:09:35] foundation for what he's about to teach
[1:09:37] and i trust that it helps us to relook
[1:09:40] at our situation
[1:09:41] and see how paul is presenting it he is
[1:09:44] speaking to the corinthians about the
[1:09:46] macedonians
[1:09:48] all right so he says again in the king
[1:09:50] james moreover brethren
[1:09:52] we do you to wit of the grace of god be
[1:09:54] stored on the churches of macedonia
[1:09:56] all right so in the amplified it says
[1:09:59] now brothers and sisters
[1:10:01] we want to tell you about the grace of
[1:10:04] god
[1:10:04] which has been evident in the churches
[1:10:07] of macedonia
[1:10:08] awakening in them a longing to
[1:10:10] contribute
[1:10:12] all right now verse two
[1:10:16] there's a there there is a theologian
[1:10:18] who has described this as a formula
[1:10:20] this is this is the wit this is the
[1:10:23] unnatural truth that is presented in
[1:10:25] another way
[1:10:26] listen to verse two how that in a great
[1:10:29] trial of affliction
[1:10:32] the abundance of their joy and their
[1:10:35] deep poverty abounded unto the riches
[1:10:39] of their liberality that's the king
[1:10:41] james
[1:10:43] let me read it one more time so this is
[1:10:45] this is what paul
[1:10:47] so again i i don't know why
[1:10:50] this is really exciting to me because it
[1:10:52] really is
[1:10:54] paul is saying so much he says i want to
[1:10:56] tell all the believers in corinth about
[1:10:58] us what's happening in macedonia
[1:11:01] and and just to give a bit of background
[1:11:03] this scripture is dealing with a
[1:11:05] situation in jerusalem
[1:11:07] so you have to kind of i can't get it
[1:11:08] all but basically these
[1:11:10] believers in jerusalem are in trouble
[1:11:13] and paul is on a mission to help the
[1:11:16] brethren
[1:11:17] in jerusalem who going through deep
[1:11:19] hardship
[1:11:21] prior to this conversation with the
[1:11:22] corinthians the corinthians would have
[1:11:25] said we will help
[1:11:29] the macedonians would have said we will
[1:11:31] help
[1:11:33] everybody saying we will help however
[1:11:37] when paul and they now say well brethren
[1:11:40] and macedonia all they said only will
[1:11:42] help
[1:11:44] this is what paul observed how in a
[1:11:46] great trial of affliction
[1:11:48] and historians will say because of the
[1:11:51] gospel
[1:11:52] the macedonians were oppressed they lost
[1:11:54] a lot
[1:11:56] their businesses were under pressure
[1:11:59] they were being persecuted so they
[1:12:01] couldn't operate as they would
[1:12:02] so how in a great trial of affliction
[1:12:05] that's what they're referring to
[1:12:06] the abundance of their joy so in their
[1:12:09] affliction they have joy
[1:12:13] you see what paul is saying in the great
[1:12:15] trial of affliction
[1:12:16] they are bonded to their joy and now we
[1:12:19] contrast again
[1:12:20] and their deep poverty abounded
[1:12:23] onto riches of their liberality no you
[1:12:26] have to go and check the dictionary
[1:12:27] again
[1:12:28] that word liberality is not
[1:12:32] let me get the exact definition for you
[1:12:35] it speaks to
[1:12:37] it speaks to the quality of giving so
[1:12:40] it's not just giving
[1:12:42] so paul is speaking to the corinthians
[1:12:43] about the master doing and saying listen
[1:12:46] they're in a big trial but they enjoy
[1:12:50] they have lost a lot so they have deep
[1:12:51] poverty but the quality of their giving
[1:12:54] is different
[1:12:55] now i'm building into something yeah
[1:13:00] let me read it in the amplified for
[1:13:02] during a
[1:13:03] ordeal of severe distress their abundant
[1:13:06] joy
[1:13:07] and their deep poverty together
[1:13:09] overflowed in the wealth of their lavish
[1:13:11] generosity
[1:13:13] history king james for to their power
[1:13:16] idea record
[1:13:17] ye and beyond their power they were
[1:13:20] willing of themselves
[1:13:22] so paul is speaking to the corinthians
[1:13:24] about the mastodon and sing
[1:13:25] and then he amplified it says for i
[1:13:28] testify
[1:13:29] that according to the ability and beyond
[1:13:32] their ability they give voluntarily
[1:13:39] verse 3 praying
[1:13:42] us which much in treaty that we will
[1:13:45] receive the gift
[1:13:46] and take upon us the fellowship of the
[1:13:48] ministering to the sins
[1:13:51] now this praying here is not praying to
[1:13:53] god
[1:13:55] this praying when you really think every
[1:13:57] fight said begging
[1:13:58] us insistently for the privilege
[1:14:02] of participating in the service for the
[1:14:05] support of the saints in jerusalem
[1:14:08] that's the amplified so in other words
[1:14:11] when the brethren meet the macedonians
[1:14:15] and recognize the situation with the
[1:14:17] macedonians they became reluctant
[1:14:21] to even receive the gifts that the
[1:14:23] macedonians wanted to give them
[1:14:26] in so much that the macedonians began to
[1:14:29] beg and insist to still be part of the
[1:14:33] privilege
[1:14:35] of giving to the brethren in jerusalem
[1:14:40] now i'm building something and i want to
[1:14:41] connect something and i want you to
[1:14:42] understand where i'm going very
[1:14:43] carefully
[1:14:46] verse five and this they did
[1:14:49] not as we hoped
[1:14:54] but first gave their own selves to the
[1:14:56] lord
[1:14:57] and unto us by the will of god
[1:15:01] so paul is saying in the amplified
[1:15:04] not only did they give materially
[1:15:07] as we had hoped sorry not as we hope
[1:15:10] meaning
[1:15:11] paul expected them to just give a
[1:15:14] financial contribution
[1:15:16] to the believers in jerusalem but he's
[1:15:18] saying
[1:15:19] not only did they do that but first they
[1:15:22] give themselves to the lord and to
[1:15:24] us as his representatives by the will of
[1:15:27] god
[1:15:28] disregarding their personal interests
[1:15:31] and giving as much as they possibly
[1:15:33] could so they not only gave the treasure
[1:15:37] for the believers in jerusalem but they
[1:15:39] gave up their time
[1:15:40] they gave up their fellowship they made
[1:15:42] themselves available to them
[1:15:44] they made paul and his brethren feel
[1:15:46] welcome
[1:15:49] anybody with me
[1:15:52] so but understand this paul is related
[1:15:55] now
[1:15:55] to the corinthians the testimony of the
[1:15:58] macedonians
[1:15:59] but i want you to see where this is
[1:16:00] going to end up for paul's teaching huh
[1:16:04] and this they did not as we had hoped
[1:16:07] but first gave their own selves to the
[1:16:09] lord
[1:16:10] so we're talking about i raise it do you
[1:16:12] give your time to the lord
[1:16:13] do you give your prayer to the lord do
[1:16:15] you give your effort your talent to the
[1:16:17] lord
[1:16:18] she said it's not just stranger well i
[1:16:19] just put that offer in but i'm not
[1:16:21] available
[1:16:21] i'm i'm not available i'm not any
[1:16:23] service i'm not coming to help i don't
[1:16:24] want to clean the church i don't want to
[1:16:26] do anything else
[1:16:32] in so much this is now verse six
[1:16:36] that we desired titus that as he had
[1:16:39] begun
[1:16:41] so he would also finish in you the same
[1:16:43] grace also
[1:16:45] so paul is saying now titus was paul's
[1:16:48] associate he was his right hand
[1:16:50] in this context the last time titus
[1:16:53] clashed with the corinthians
[1:16:54] was in rebuking them on behalf of paul
[1:16:58] but now he's saying titus coming to
[1:17:01] finish this thing because titus is the
[1:17:03] one
[1:17:03] who is arranging this thing very
[1:17:05] bridging in jerusalem
[1:17:08] now this verse 7
[1:17:12] is the challenge to us all
[1:17:16] this is what blew my mind completely
[1:17:20] so paul now is no so he's so at the end
[1:17:24] of verse five
[1:17:25] he is he stops speaking of the
[1:17:27] macedonians so
[1:17:29] from from verse one to verse five it's
[1:17:32] all about macedonians anybody with me
[1:17:35] from verse one to verse five it's about
[1:17:37] macedonians
[1:17:38] verse six he lets them know that titus
[1:17:41] remember this is a letter
[1:17:42] this is paul's letter to the corinthians
[1:17:45] so he's writing to the corinthians
[1:17:47] in verse 1 to verse 5 about what
[1:17:49] happened with the macedonians
[1:17:51] who despite their troubles their
[1:17:53] afflictions their pressures their their
[1:17:55] issues
[1:17:56] they have not reneged on their
[1:17:58] commitment their
[1:18:00] their their commitment to time talent
[1:18:02] and treasure to
[1:18:03] the sake of the kingdom he said titus is
[1:18:05] coming
[1:18:06] who are no only no titus in verse six
[1:18:09] all right now verse seven is where
[1:18:12] i look at my life your life our lives as
[1:18:15] believers
[1:18:17] and he says here therefore as ye abound
[1:18:21] in everything in faith
[1:18:24] and utterance and knowledge
[1:18:28] and in all diligence and in your love to
[1:18:31] us
[1:18:32] see that he abound in this grace also
[1:18:36] no you see this scripture right here
[1:18:38] this scripture is
[1:18:40] i have not heard anybody present this
[1:18:42] personally
[1:18:44] in in the context of what paul intends
[1:18:46] is here
[1:18:47] to to to see it in this way
[1:18:50] paul from verse one to verse five and
[1:18:53] verse six
[1:18:54] is speaking about the macedonians giving
[1:18:57] and now he now
[1:18:58] switches to the corinthians and says and
[1:19:01] i'll read it in the amplified
[1:19:03] but just as you excel in everything and
[1:19:06] lead the way in faith in speech
[1:19:08] in knowledge in genuine concern and in
[1:19:11] your love for us
[1:19:13] see that you excel in this gracious work
[1:19:15] of giving also
[1:19:17] so paul is saying your faith
[1:19:21] your testimony your knowledge your
[1:19:24] diligence
[1:19:25] your love if you have all that covered
[1:19:28] you still need to also be a giver
[1:19:33] this is not giving in response to
[1:19:35] judgment or if you don't give
[1:19:37] it a listen to now verse 8
[1:19:42] i speak not by commandment
[1:19:45] i love it you say i'm not telling you to
[1:19:48] do this you know
[1:19:48] it's not a commandment but by occasion
[1:19:52] of the forwardness of others and
[1:19:56] to prove the sincerity of your love
[1:19:59] so paul is this is a master stroke of a
[1:20:02] letter because he's challenging his
[1:20:05] believers and a theologian wrote
[1:20:07] that paul was addressing because the
[1:20:10] believers in current
[1:20:12] wasn't feeling divish
[1:20:17] the willingness to give or the promise
[1:20:19] to give
[1:20:20] or he said he was dealing with that's
[1:20:22] why he would have had to adjust the
[1:20:23] issue
[1:20:26] so paul is saying here i speak not by
[1:20:29] commandment i
[1:20:30] want to come and tell you all you have
[1:20:31] to do it you know why because way back
[1:20:34] in
[1:20:34] in exodus we read god wanted to do it
[1:20:36] willingly
[1:20:38] so paul now who understands the
[1:20:40] principle say i speak not by commandment
[1:20:42] because i don't want you to do it
[1:20:43] because i'm telling you to do it but
[1:20:45] i have a reason to do it which is by
[1:20:47] occasion of the forwardness of others
[1:20:49] which means
[1:20:50] the macedonians are set a good example
[1:20:52] for us and to you
[1:20:54] you need to prove the sincerity of your
[1:20:58] love
[1:21:00] let me read it in the amplified i'm not
[1:21:02] going to be too much longer
[1:21:03] i am not saying this as a command to
[1:21:06] dictate to you
[1:21:07] but to prove by pointing out the
[1:21:10] enthusiasm of others
[1:21:12] the sincerity of your love as well so
[1:21:15] paul is saying
[1:21:16] holy show your loved one
[1:21:19] don't make it a commandment look what
[1:21:22] other virgin are doing
[1:21:23] what are you doing with your time with
[1:21:25] your talent
[1:21:26] with your treasure to support the
[1:21:28] believers to support the brethren this
[1:21:30] is a body kingdom
[1:21:34] and then now paul goes on because now we
[1:21:36] give him now supported now now he's
[1:21:38] going into the deeper things
[1:21:40] verse nine for we know the grace of our
[1:21:43] lord jesus christ
[1:21:44] that doki was rich yet for your sakes he
[1:21:48] became poor
[1:21:49] that he through his poverty might be
[1:21:51] rich
[1:21:52] and herein i give my advice so this is
[1:21:56] the first time paul is now
[1:21:57] speaking now if you want my advice on
[1:22:00] the matter
[1:22:01] if you want my position on the matter
[1:22:04] for this is expedient for you who have
[1:22:07] begun before
[1:22:08] not only to do but also to be forward a
[1:22:11] year ago
[1:22:12] now let me read this in the in the
[1:22:14] amplified so you'll see
[1:22:15] what this is here from verse 9. for you
[1:22:18] are recognizing more clearly this is
[1:22:22] verse 9 are going in the amplified
[1:22:23] for you are recognizing more clearly
[1:22:27] the grace of our lord jesus christ his
[1:22:30] astonishing kindness
[1:22:32] his generosity his gracious favor
[1:22:35] that though he was rich yet for your
[1:22:37] sake he became poor
[1:22:39] so that by his poverty you might become
[1:22:41] rich
[1:22:42] abundantly blessed i give you my opinion
[1:22:46] in this matter that's advice in the king
[1:22:48] james
[1:22:49] this is to your advantage
[1:22:52] who were to the first to begin a year
[1:22:54] ago
[1:22:55] not only to take action to help the
[1:22:58] believers in jerusalem
[1:22:59] but also first a desire to do it so paul
[1:23:02] is saying to them
[1:23:03] you in corinth were the first of the
[1:23:06] groups
[1:23:07] to say i want to help i'm not only
[1:23:10] acting like you don't want to help
[1:23:12] but i want you to understand how paul is
[1:23:14] dealing with his situation and
[1:23:16] presenting to them
[1:23:17] that listen all you have mysteries
[1:23:19] although you have knowledge all you have
[1:23:21] to have do you think if you don't do
[1:23:22] this part of the
[1:23:23] other thing too you're missing the whole
[1:23:25] story you know
[1:23:28] i'm almost done
[1:23:31] verse 11. now therefore perform the
[1:23:35] doing of it
[1:23:36] in other words get it done
[1:23:40] that as there was a readiness to will so
[1:23:43] there may be a performance
[1:23:44] also of that which he have in the
[1:23:46] amplified so paul now saying
[1:23:49] so now finish this so that your
[1:23:51] eagerness
[1:23:53] in desiring it may be equaled
[1:23:56] by your completion of it according to
[1:23:58] your ability
[1:24:01] so i'm wondering why is it paul now have
[1:24:03] to appeal
[1:24:06] this is paul the apostle paul the first
[1:24:09] messenger
[1:24:10] first appealing to people
[1:24:13] listen all your promise you say you will
[1:24:15] help you see you will support you see
[1:24:16] you will give you time you see he will
[1:24:18] give you a talent you'll see it give you
[1:24:19] trouble oh gosh keep your word now
[1:24:22] you have knowledge you have wisdom you
[1:24:24] have a but would you be so selfish
[1:24:30] all this in scripture you know context
[1:24:33] all right
[1:24:33] i'm almost done let's go
[1:24:38] i want to go to the next chapter in
[1:24:40] second corinthians second corinthians
[1:24:41] nine
[1:24:42] and just three verses from verse six
[1:24:47] and just to see and even
[1:24:50] i don't have the time to get into all of
[1:24:52] it
[1:24:57] now the pentecostals misappropriate
[1:24:59] these scriptures
[1:25:02] but what i have found in the message
[1:25:07] people have so want to distance
[1:25:09] themselves from the pentecostals
[1:25:11] mockery that they miss the fact that
[1:25:13] this is still a truth
[1:25:15] not because somebody abused the truth
[1:25:17] changes the fact that it is the truth
[1:25:20] whatever you spend your time on you will
[1:25:21] get the results of it
[1:25:23] whatever you spend your talent on you'll
[1:25:24] get the results of it whatever you spend
[1:25:26] your treasure on your sp you're getting
[1:25:27] results
[1:25:28] of it so paul is saying in
[1:25:32] second corinthians uh verse uh
[1:25:35] second recording nine verse six but this
[1:25:38] i say
[1:25:38] he would sow it sparingly shall reap
[1:25:42] also sparingly and he which sow it
[1:25:44] bountifully
[1:25:45] shall reap also bountifully it's a law
[1:25:48] it's a principle
[1:25:50] every man according as he purpose it in
[1:25:53] his heart
[1:25:54] so let him give not grudgingly or of
[1:25:57] necessity for god love with a cheerful
[1:26:00] giver
[1:26:01] now this so i want people just talk
[1:26:03] about god love our cheerful giver
[1:26:05] but this is actually still addressing
[1:26:08] the issue
[1:26:08] from the previous chapter you know
[1:26:13] so i don't want it out of context goal
[1:26:14] of our chair forgive us god was
[1:26:16] dealing now this chapter just very
[1:26:18] quickly
[1:26:20] starts in in verse one for us touching
[1:26:23] the minister into the scenes
[1:26:24] it is superfluous for me to write to you
[1:26:27] in the amplified just so you understand
[1:26:30] he's not talking about preaching to
[1:26:31] these sins you know
[1:26:33] in the army i said no it is unnecessary
[1:26:35] for me to write to you
[1:26:37] about the offering that is to be made to
[1:26:39] the scenes in jerusalem
[1:26:41] for i know your eagerness i'm reading
[1:26:43] the amplified because it'll be a little
[1:26:44] easier to catch
[1:26:46] for i know your eagerness to promote
[1:26:48] this cause
[1:26:49] and i have proudly boasted to the people
[1:26:51] of macedonia about it
[1:26:53] telling them that akaya has been
[1:26:55] prepared since last year
[1:26:57] for this contribution and your
[1:26:59] enthusiasm
[1:27:00] has inspired the majority of them to
[1:27:03] respond
[1:27:04] still i am sending the brothers to you
[1:27:07] so that our pride in you may not be
[1:27:10] empty
[1:27:11] boast in this case so that you may be
[1:27:13] prepared just as i told them you would
[1:27:15] be
[1:27:15] otherwise if any macedonians come with
[1:27:18] me
[1:27:18] and find you unprepared we say nothing
[1:27:22] of ourselves
[1:27:22] will be humiliated before being so
[1:27:24] confident
[1:27:25] this is why i thought it necessary to
[1:27:28] urge
[1:27:29] these brothers to go to you before i
[1:27:31] come
[1:27:32] and make arrangements in advance for
[1:27:34] this generous
[1:27:36] previously promised gift of yours so
[1:27:38] that it will be ready
[1:27:40] not as something extorted or wrong out
[1:27:42] of you
[1:27:43] but as a voluntary and generous gift
[1:27:46] that is the context leading up to this
[1:27:50] and now verse 6. now remember this he
[1:27:52] who so
[1:27:53] sparingly will also reap sparingly and
[1:27:56] he who sows generously
[1:27:57] this is believers he talking to you know
[1:28:05] so i want in this teaching tonight
[1:28:08] we will look at these three things these
[1:28:10] three levers
[1:28:11] that we have time talent
[1:28:15] treasure because it's a choice
[1:28:18] the fact that paul was pleading to them
[1:28:21] was connected to the fact that he knew
[1:28:24] they had a choice
[1:28:25] of how to give their time how to give
[1:28:28] their talent how to give their treasure
[1:28:30] he said the believers in macedonia have
[1:28:31] issues and they made the commitment
[1:28:33] not only make their commitment but they
[1:28:35] welcome us they were hospitable to us
[1:28:37] they they
[1:28:38] they they they they more than we
[1:28:41] expected from them
[1:28:44] anybody with me let me jump to the last
[1:28:48] section of this
[1:28:50] jesus speaking matthew 6
[1:28:54] verse 1 and between
[1:28:58] [Music]
[1:28:59] this matthew 6 chapter
[1:29:03] is where you find the lord's prayer
[1:29:06] and a deep part of praying
[1:29:10] has to do with sacrifice
[1:29:14] giving something you bring in a lamb you
[1:29:16] bring in something that's how the
[1:29:18] sacrifice was done
[1:29:21] we bring a sacrifice even praises and
[1:29:23] sacrifice you know
[1:29:25] when you begin to see that then you
[1:29:27] begin to worship and praise differently
[1:29:30] because you realize that god can't bless
[1:29:33] you without something
[1:29:34] you can't come empty-handed to the lord
[1:29:37] let me see it again you can't come with
[1:29:40] your hand
[1:29:41] open to receive from the law without
[1:29:42] bringing something
[1:29:47] anybody with me so the salmon is a
[1:29:50] sacrifice of praise that it serves as a
[1:29:53] sacrifice and what makes it a sacrifice
[1:29:55] is when you don't even feel like you
[1:29:57] have something to praise god for but
[1:29:58] you're still praying
[1:30:01] so there's a cost to that praise
[1:30:05] you lost something but you still praise
[1:30:06] god that's a sacrifice
[1:30:08] you praise him for the loss it's count
[1:30:11] you into it
[1:30:12] it's against expectation it's not what
[1:30:15] people expect you to do
[1:30:18] you're supposed to be sad but you're
[1:30:20] praising god anyhow you're supposed to
[1:30:22] be depressed but you're worshiping god
[1:30:23] anyhow
[1:30:24] it's a sacrifice
[1:30:27] i want to draw your attention we can go
[1:30:29] very quickly as we close out
[1:30:30] matthew 6.
[1:30:39] and in this matthew 6 by the time you
[1:30:41] reach
[1:30:42] uh
[1:30:46] verse 9 we enter the lord's prayer right
[1:30:49] i want to identify so matthew 6 so this
[1:30:52] is how jesus
[1:30:53] actually so this is the sermon that
[1:30:55] leads to the lord's prayer
[1:30:57] and you wonder why of all the things
[1:31:01] that god can speak about when he's on it
[1:31:04] before the lord's pray he starts off
[1:31:07] matthew 6 with
[1:31:08] take heed that you do not your arms
[1:31:10] before men
[1:31:11] this is your giving that's what arms is
[1:31:14] your financial giving before men to be
[1:31:16] seen of them
[1:31:17] otherwise you may have no reward of your
[1:31:19] father which in heaven
[1:31:20] therefore when thou does thine arms
[1:31:24] not if it's not if you're doing it
[1:31:28] he said when you do it do not sign a
[1:31:30] trumpet before the
[1:31:31] as the hypocrites do in these synagogues
[1:31:33] and in the streets that they may have
[1:31:34] glory
[1:31:35] verse three but when don't do this don't
[1:31:37] let your left know the right thing to do
[1:31:38] it
[1:31:39] that your arm may be in secret and my
[1:31:42] father would see it in secret
[1:31:43] will reward the openly and now he is
[1:31:46] building something he switches down from
[1:31:48] arms to wendell prius
[1:31:52] now you trying to understand the mind of
[1:31:54] god
[1:31:55] he is bringing he is walking towards the
[1:31:57] lord's prayer
[1:31:59] and his tying sacrifice and your
[1:32:02] operation
[1:32:03] and your tying your talent on your
[1:32:05] treasure all of it connected
[1:32:08] of what you give he said okay noah dealt
[1:32:10] with the arms issue
[1:32:11] by verse nine when thou prays thou shalt
[1:32:14] not be as he approaches the same thing
[1:32:15] like the arms
[1:32:17] and by time he come down to verse six
[1:32:20] everybody want to go into the secret
[1:32:21] closet but verse six
[1:32:24] is the same thing of being giving in
[1:32:27] secret in verse four
[1:32:28] that then arms may be in secret in verse
[1:32:31] four is the same thing when the prayers
[1:32:32] in verse six
[1:32:33] enter in thy closet that went out shut
[1:32:35] this door pray to the father with in
[1:32:36] secret
[1:32:38] god parallel the same thing and then by
[1:32:40] verse nine
[1:32:41] he's like and after this manner
[1:32:43] therefore pray he
[1:32:44] our father which art in heaven
[1:32:50] prayer is giving time prayer is itself a
[1:32:53] sacrifice
[1:32:55] giving your time your talent your
[1:32:59] treasure
[1:33:00] i trust tonight you will look
[1:33:03] at your position on things i
[1:33:06] trust tonight if your position was like
[1:33:08] the corinthians
[1:33:09] with knowledge and revelation and
[1:33:11] understanding
[1:33:12] so paul would say with all your
[1:33:14] knowledge understanding and a given you
[1:33:15] are leaders
[1:33:16] he said you are first in these things be
[1:33:18] first also in your giving
[1:33:22] most of us don't give enough to the
[1:33:24] kingdom of god i'm just i'm just talking
[1:33:26] financially i'm talking about your time
[1:33:30] your talent and your treasure
[1:33:33] all three and they're just talking about
[1:33:36] attendance in church
[1:33:38] but when last year find out can i help
[1:33:39] somebody
[1:33:42] is there somebody in need because
[1:33:44] helping somebody in need
[1:33:46] could be giving them some time
[1:33:49] helping them in some way give them some
[1:33:50] talent they need something that you can
[1:33:53] help them facilitate
[1:33:56] you giving them some treasure many
[1:33:59] people go into struggles in this
[1:34:02] pandemic
[1:34:05] time talent treasure
[1:34:08] a study on giving can we bore our heads
[1:34:12] heavenly father we thank you tonight
[1:34:15] lord
[1:34:16] for helping us to see through
[1:34:19] scripture lord who
[1:34:23] you could do anything that you want to
[1:34:25] do you are sovereign
[1:34:26] there's nothing limiting what you can do
[1:34:28] what you can achieve what you can put in
[1:34:30] place
[1:34:32] lord father when
[1:34:34] [Music]
[1:34:35] the disciples needed to pay taxes
[1:34:39] you made it possible that you could find
[1:34:42] gold in a fish
[1:34:45] when jonah needed to go to nineveh you
[1:34:47] provided a fish for him
[1:34:50] lord there are so many examples through
[1:34:52] scripture of
[1:34:54] how you did what would be considered the
[1:34:56] impossible
[1:34:58] but when you wanted to interact
[1:35:02] with man and man to interact with
[1:35:06] it's fellow man and you wanted to have a
[1:35:08] tabernacle to dwell in
[1:35:10] lord you wanted to use talent
[1:35:14] time and treasure to take your
[1:35:17] blueprints
[1:35:19] that you had in your mind that you
[1:35:21] expressed to moses and say moses
[1:35:23] this is what i wanted done it's so
[1:35:26] shocking to see that
[1:35:28] after moses brought the people out
[1:35:32] and he spent time in your presence and
[1:35:34] got insight into your thinking
[1:35:37] the details of the blueprint but even
[1:35:39] when he presented it
[1:35:41] the bible has to show us there were
[1:35:42] people who were not willing
[1:35:44] there were people who were at the time
[1:35:45] who didn't come people who had the
[1:35:47] talent who didn't come
[1:35:49] people who were the treasure and they
[1:35:50] didn't come they were just not willing
[1:35:53] lord and to see the examples in a new
[1:35:56] testament with paul
[1:35:58] finding himself as an apostle a
[1:36:00] messenger a star
[1:36:02] having to plead over two chapters we
[1:36:05] read
[1:36:05] with the believers in corinth who
[1:36:09] understanding the responsibility the
[1:36:12] ministry the challenges they knew
[1:36:14] the situation in jerusalem they knew the
[1:36:16] situation the challenges
[1:36:18] even after hearing the trials of the
[1:36:21] macedonians and
[1:36:22] and what they did paul said had to plead
[1:36:26] and press them and say listen i know
[1:36:28] what you have but you can do better you
[1:36:30] can do more you can give more
[1:36:32] to the cause of this gospel what we have
[1:36:36] lord is not our own
[1:36:38] it's for your glory it's for your honor
[1:36:40] it's for your purpose
[1:36:42] help us to be givers lord to see how
[1:36:45] much you have given to us when
[1:36:47] we have nothing had nothing and you give
[1:36:49] your love to find us make us more like
[1:36:52] you
[1:36:54] help us to be true christians in every
[1:36:56] area of our lives
[1:36:58] not just to have a testimony of of how
[1:37:00] we live and how we move and
[1:37:02] and what we know and what we understand
[1:37:04] but to be our brother's keeper
[1:37:06] to be our sister's keeper to be more
[1:37:08] empathetic to be more
[1:37:09] sensitive to seek your will on these
[1:37:12] things
