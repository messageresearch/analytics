comfort every single minute every single day no matter what somebody did to you comfort one another with these words amen amen you may SE it I got a tile this morning the call to the resurrection amen amen and I have two Contex scriptures here Revelation 1017 and then also uh St John 11 amen let me read St John 11 reel 1017 we know that right the mighty angel coming down from heaven P the clouds rainbow upon his head face as as a s p of H H pill of fire you know who that is right you know who that angel is right that's none other and the only angel the only man the only being rather who can swear by heaven and it's all right to swear by Heaven because God said don't you swear by heaven for it's my Throne don't you swear by the Earth for it's my but this this Angel could dare to swear by heaven and it is all right who could defy God's word but God himself hallelujah hallelujah glory to God you know who this Angel is right is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ himself your lord your savior your Redeemer your reason resurrected Lord and Master and this is morning it's ister again it's is again there's a resurrection in your soul and you are here in a call to the resurrection make no mistake about that you are going in the resurrection hallelujah hallelujah there no devils not enough problems not enough habits not enough problems at home school at work you are predestinated to go in the resurrection there is going to be a resurrection I know in this Modern Age in the 21st century I know it sounds like a fairy tale I know it sounds like a fable but God's word can never fail there is going to be a resurrection and you want to fasten your eyes you want to fasten your focus that's why you are here you come here for this one purpose to receive this call to the resurrection that's your purpose of coming here if you miss that purpose your living has been in vain Hallelujah there is going to be a resurrection and brother cont told you last night potentially Mal said we are in the Rapture already is a fair to some brother I believe it and I know you do too amen so there is a call to the resurrection you may be seated glory to God amen amen amen am God has always called man there no man searching for God there no man calling out for God it's God that's his nature that's his being that's the essence of his he's a Rec reconciliatory profile God doesn't cast anyone out God never cast anyone out you get casted out because you will not go God's way and Jesus said the son is come not to condemn anyone he said the son is come through him believing in him the world might be saved so I didn't come for condemnation I come to give life but he said hearing is the condemnation if you going to be condemned here is how the condemnation comes it because light has come into the world and Men turn down light and chose Darkness instead so they condemn themselves but it's not God's job to condemn anybody so God he always calls he's a reconciliatory spirit reconciled that's why it is spoken blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God God Spirit reconciled God spirit in cast I am I am so and who are you get away from me God Spirit doesn't do that and that's why at this end of time here in the seventh age out of Leia we have been called out for the spirit of God in is a spirit of Brotherly kindness and that spirit is supposed to so possess us brother kindness you can bear with a man when even when he's in the wrong you don't catch him out you are patient with him you got virtue within yourself to know that what he believes even though false doctr it's in his heart and you have virtue within yourself so let it go out with kindness that's the spirit of God and that's why there is a call to the resurrection God has always called in the Garden of Eden when Adam and Eve fell God knew what they did they disobeyed his instructions they brought all This calamity upon mankind destroy God's plan destroy God's program still went after them it didn't go say Adam you an evil son you an evil man at what you did broke God words said where thou God has always gone out to call God has always called out he's always reached out in reconciliation glory to God Amen Hallelujah Oh Glory oh GL amen amen you be seated you can be anyway so God his nature his love nature to go after man creation amen he caus us to repentance cause out of sin caus us to enjoy the goodness of the Lord cause us to worship cause us to seek the face of the Lord if it sees any niby in our lives he reaches out to us Amen to to to to to to uh take inventory so we can take care of what is run our hallelujah hallelujah so the first call in the Bible record was and Eve in the G of Eden Adam Adam where thou and so has it remained up until this time here God is always calling every one of God's promises invitation from God for us to enjoy calls us every promise I am the Lord that heal there a call from God to come enjoy the healing power the healing virtues of the love of God every call from God to man is a call that we come to enjoy the goodness of the Lord so the call to the resurrection is a call from God amen amen amen amen I be s a minute let me read this kind of scripture here uh John 11 John 11 this was the raising up of Lazarus from the grave right uh let's pick it up from verse 38 let me let me read also first before I ver let me read also the early part of the place that when Jesus was told about Lazarus and then he invited he invited his disciples to come to a res Resurrection to come and partake in the resurrection of Lazarus and we as disciples today being invited by the same Jesus Christ to come and partake of the Resurrection amen amen um all right let me read a portion here somebody I get uh um uh John 11 verse one now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of bethan the of Mary and her sister mattha it was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother Lazarus was sick therefore his sister said unto him unto Jesus saying Lord behold he whom thou lovest is seek when Jesus heard that he said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God that the Son of God might be glorified thereby about Jesus about Jesus and he was God example six son and brother his life after he was baptized at the River Jordan by John the Baptist is the example life that you and I should take for our examples he was God example sit and is our example I will take examples from any other person as long as that example represents Christ we don't follow any man we should not follow any man or we should take examples but that example must exemplify Christ that example is not to lift up any Manor church over and above another one that example must exemplify Christ because he is God example SE son Hallelujah every example points to him amen amen hallelujah hallelujah amen now when Jesus heard that verse four he said this sign is not to death okay I think I read already verse five now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus elar when he had heard therefore that he was sick he two days still in the same place where he was you will think Lazarus is sick was dying and Jesus was almost he even appeared like he did not care but he has the lesson here from his example Jesus run through the Bible Jesus never panicked never panicked no matter what happened or what not happened never panicked don't you panic all things work together for good what we are supposed to do is to commit our wayto the Lord and leave us as close to God as we possibly can and God he'll make everything work out all right but too many times we panic and when you panic you don't give God a chance to work because it's just nature they will not come into your Panic the Bible says Be Still mes Moses go to to the Red Sea Mo was all panicking because the people put pressure on him they pressurized him look at the ahead of us and they were panicking and the Panic was transferred to mes and moed complain to God as though God had let them wrong and God scream back at Moses stand still because when you panic you will not give God a chance to work on your behalf because his nature to not panic his Spirit cannot work in the midst of panic is not a panic stricken God he steals everything that's why he can go to work the Bible said still and know that I am God whatever the problem whatever the challenges and know that I am God Amen Jesus here this is Jesus here walking into a call to the resurrection no Panic All Things are under control God is in charge then verse seven he said then after after that say he to his disciples let us go into Judea again his disciples say unto him Master the Jews of late s to Stone thee and goest thou again Jesus answered are there not 12 hours in the day if any man walk in the day he tumbleth not because he seeth the light of this world but if a man walk in the night is Tumbl because there is no light in him this things sayth he and after that he saith unto them our friend Lazarus sleepeth but I go that I may awake him out of sleep and he telling you and I today friends sleep Arena sleep Mar sleep columus sleep Luther sleep the Pentecost sleep and I go in you to awake them again he's inviting you to partake in this Resurrection to bring on this Resurrection not as an onlooker but as a partaker actually CA the resurrection to amen verse 12 then said his disciples Lord if he sleep it shall do well how be Jesus spake of his death but the thought that he has spoken of taking of rest in sleep that's always a problem when you're talking and people stay in the natural Realms they they they weigh everything every every every everything that in the Bible in the natural realm brother Johny told you like we've been speaking about they run everything through their emotions they have a headache and they're sure their body is feeling bad themselves I am going to die what does the word of God say about it somebody say something to them quickly they condemn that person because that person came against them what does the word of God say about it their son does something wrong and somebody corrects that son they get angry at that person because it's their son another person another child does the same thing their son has done they condemn it because he not their son now just running their Liv through their emotions and these disciples instead of sitting in the spiritual Realm they felt if is sleeping he does well but Jesus had to tell them he's not talking about taking us rest in sleep come up either be spiritual let the word of God dwell in you richly in all wisdom then no man will be able to deceive you glory to God Amen then Jesus said unto them plainly Lazarus is dead and I'm glad for your sakes that I was not there to the intent that you might believe nevertheless let us go unto him amen verse 38 Jesus therefore growing again himself coming to the Grave it was a cave and a stone lay upon it Jes Jesus said take you away the stone Martha the sister of him that was dead sayith unto him Lord by this time he stinketh he has been dead 4 days Jesus said unto her said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou should see the glory of God then they took away the Stone from the place where the dead was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father I thank thee that thou has heard me and I knew that thou hearest me always but because of the people which stand by I said it that they may believe that thou Hast sent me and when he thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grap clothes and his face was bound about with a napkin Jesus said unto them lose him and let him go amen the Lord bless the of his words the call to the resurrection you may be seated and in the Bible Jesus is the center piece of the whole Bible coming is the centerpiece of the whole Bible it's coming at the beginning it's coming at the end and revelation 22 Jesus gave the final promise in the Bible he said behold I come quickly and there was a reply from a prde that's standing watching even so come Lord Jesus that last promise prayer have to do with the coming of the Lord Jesus said I come quickly the bride says come quickly Lord Jesus the coming of the Lord that's The Thirst that's the desire that's the control tower of every believer every single day that's the focus on your mind the coming of the Lord hallelujah every single day every single minute you are looking out for him you are watching out for him like the Bible said do everything that you do in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ when you go to school you are looking out for the Lord you will not do what the Lord will not do you will not keep a company that the Lord will not be comfortable with you will not hang out with friends that the Lord not hang out with you will not say words that the Lord will not say you are always looking at for the Lord looking out for the Lord even so come Lord Jesus that's not speaking about the Rapture alone that's speaking about your everyday living your everyday existence you are looking out for the Lord that's your ending sight you wake up every day the coming of the Lord is on your mind you are looking for the Lord every single minute you are looking to do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ wherever you want to go to will the Lord be comfortable to find you there that's how you think every day and that's how you wait for the coming of the Lord that's what the coming of the Lord is all about it's not leave any and then at the end of the day you are going in the Rapture no they that look for him they that look for him the Bible said it shall appear to them every day without sin unto salvation so if you are sick every day you are looking for him if your son is sick your boy is weed you are looking for the Lord you are expecting the Lord to come you expecting the Lord to come to deliver your son to heal your son heal your wife heal your daughter whatever needs to be done you are looking for the Lord this is the coming of the Lord and the Bible said to them that look for him shall he appear the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly shall suddenly shall suddenly appear in his Temple hallelujah hallelujah that's what it is to walk with the Lord that's how you wait for the coming of the Lord amen so the Last Promise in the Bible and the last prayer centered on the coming of the Lord the consumation of all scripture the whole Bible the book of redemption is sit around this point here the coming of the Lord when Adam and Eve sin Genesis 3 immediately God spoke about the coming of the Lord all down through the Bible the coming of the Lord that's the end Insight let me tell you a Bible princi May seated may be seated the coming of the Lord is the ending sight that's where God is going to that's his destination that's the purpose of the whole Bible God started his program with the end in sight you know what that means that means you have a destination you have a place you are going to that's how you start at all you start from the end you start from the end and walk your way backwards Glory seated I want to be sure you really get this when you go when you left your house this morning you were at home but in your mind you felt I am going to church getting to church was your end in sight we are not in church yet you're not in church yet but because that's where you want to go to you make all your plans all your arrangements to get you to that end to get you to church you may seated when your when your neighbor comes this morning to say I've come to visit you oh I've been W to visit you for years now I've come to visit you this morning let us talk together for about two hours because of your ending sight it affects all your plans you tell your neighbor I am sorry I don't have time this morning I am going to church you are not in church yet but that end Insight affects all your programs all your plans affects the way you live the way you view things affects your world view because you have a destination that you are going to that's how God lives and that's how God wants us to live we didn't just come here we have an end in sight we didn't just believe we have an end in sight our end in sight is the coming of the Lord and insight is the call to the resurrection that's what you are here for you're not here to be a doctor that's a vehicle on your road to your end inside you are not here just to be a housewife because if you're here just to be a housewife you'll fight your husband every time when your husband is not to when he disappoints you or when you just disagree with him you fight him every day but because you have an end sight the thought comes to you this way I am doing with my husband or with my wife is he going to come to the end sight hallelujah hallelujah isn't this like my neighbor coming to distract me from my en so the coming of the Lord that's our ending sight when we go to school when we go to work at at the in the home in our relationships they end inside why we chase the whatever we need to chase in the world for school for our jobs for our careers whatever you want to be you have your hand in sight that's why a Christian believer will not get a career that would hinder him from running the race of life you can do whatever career you want you can aspire to be whatever you want to be but you will not choose a career or any aspiration that will hinder you from your ending sight that's how God lives and that's how he wants us to live and so does God have an end Insight concerning you way back before the fish of the world he chose you and loved you before you had a chance to do right or wrong because he knew you will believe it he didn't look at your struggles he didn't look at your weaknesses he looked in your heart there is one who will believe it so God wrote your name in Blood and no man no devil no mistake no habit can take your name out because it's Written in Blood your name is written in red there's no erasor there's no bleach that can wipe off your name because where God wants to get you to where God wants to get you to God's end insight about you God's end Insight concerning you it shall not fail it will not fail it cannot fail Hallelujah God has determined that you are going to the resurrection God has determined that you are going to cause the resurrection of the sins because they without us could not be made perfect you will call the resurrection you will bring on the resurrection that's thus say the Bible That's thus say of the Lord that's Malachi from the pages of the Bible it shall not fail Glory Glory the end in sight amen when you become a Christian you didn't become a Christian to see whether this is going to work or not what's your purpose becoming a Christian but when you have your hand in sight I am here to stay I am not going back I mean to make it all the way to the resurrection you are ready for the journey then when you are going on a journey and you know you have to be on that Journey when you get to the motor and you find you forgot your passport you don't say well that's the end of the journey then the journey doesn't mean anything to you but the journey is important to you you say I forgot my passport quickly get your passport so you can continue on your journey the challenge the hindrance of for getting your passport doesn't make you give up on pressing on with the journey so when you become a Christian whatever the challenge you have an attitude Lord this is the challenge we have now Lord how do we go around this challenge how do we overcome this Challenge and he will help you because your ending sight is to being that called to the res hallelujah hallelujah amen amen now there have been seven seven Junctions of time in man's history on the face of the Earth Noah Abraham Moses Elijah Jesus Luther and then the great Junction the Great the great Junction of time in the seventh age here is first Thessalonians 4:16 the coming of the Lord is a great Junction and at a junction you decide which direction to go either to go forward to go right ways left ways or go backwards but we are pressing forward to the coming of the Lord Glory now remember the prophet William Bram that in the coming of the Lord if you read through the whole Bible there are three comings of the Lord when God said the the the the the seat of the woman shall bruise thy head Z he was talking about his first coming as well as the second coming as as his third coming and in the Bible you will see there are three different comments Mal taught us these things he taught us this things first time he come first time he come the first coming he come to Israel as a little baby in the manger hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah second time it comes he comes in a secret Rapture and the third time he comes it comes in the for the Millennium and the kingdom age in Revelation 19 that's the coming of the Lord in the Bible is not what coming there three comings but you and I our concern this morning is with that secret second coming first Thessalonians 4:16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first and brother bam he called that the secret second coming if you notice if you stud your message anytime brother bam talk about this secret Second Coming he always identified it as first thians 4:16 the coming of the Lord oh Hallelujah he comes Amen to take his bride here for the resurrection and the Rapture and that's what you have been called to you have been called not just to go in the resurrection you have been called to partake of this Resurrection to bring on this Resurrection you will cause this Resurrection to happen but a secret affair it's not in the open it's not an all commer Affair I want I run some some some message people who compare this with Pentecost it's like there's nothing was the differ between and P no there's a lot of difference now I do not subscribe to that school of in the message who cancels that everybody else on they not in your group they don't see eye to ey with you you cancel them out I don't belong to that group I don't believe that's the spirit of God that the spirit Spirit of God goes out to goes out of the lost if you think the person is lost see how you can go after them and restore them again so I don't believe in that and I also don't believe in that group that says Pentecost are devils I don't believe that I don't believe that because William Bram never taught us that when said those people is said I'm against the system of denominations that's what I'm against because that system keeps those people bound they in a prison they've got to take permission from their denominational heads before they can do anything the system hold them bound but you will never you will never in Pentecost find them talking let's talk about going in the Rapture we're going in the Rapture but you'll never find them teaching you how to prepare for the rapture they talk in generalities but they'll never teach you future you childin you on how to get your things ready so that you might be in the resurrection so can be in the Rapture in the sky because they do not know but William Bram is the only man that I know you might know somebody else is the only man that I know who T us and said at the end of the Pentecostal age after Pentecost is done and over at the end of the Pentecostal age we are supposed to receive we are supposed to receive another messenger another messenger World hallelujah hallelujah and this messenger is going to speak out the seven thundering voices which is going to prepare the bride for great translation Faith the seven Thunder voices is going to show how how to get out of here run through the streets find me a man who spoke like that you will never find one so William Bram he's the only man who did not talk in generality about the rapture specific terms how you are going to go in that Rapture search Willam Bam's message through and through will find out the only thing said will prepare you to go in the Rapture of the Skies the only thing that will get you ready for this call to the resurrection is the seven Thunders on the back of the Bible now you may not agree with me what the seven Thunders are but you've got to admit that William Bram said the seven Thunders is the only thing that will give you rapturing faith that will give you translation faith that will get you out of hair to go in the Rapture in the skies that's why we are different from Pentecost we are talking about a preparation a preparation to go in the Rapture in the skies even when we go to school when we go to work when we have our challenges it's on our minds our preparation to go the Rapture of the Sky by doing that we are vindicating that prophet of Malachi we are vindicating his message we are vindicating God sent a prophet to get me to get you to prepare people because the the the End of Time messenger his message his job will be to get the bride ready to go be the bridegroom and that's what we are here doing that's the message not just to preach you happy to get you prepared there's a focus there's a goal there's an ending sight the coming of the Lord amen amen glory to God Amen oh glory amen now William bam Tau us amen that the seven seal on souls in prison page 50 it said the seven the seventh seal one 3 4 5 6 the seventh one not all seven but the seventh one it said the seventh seal brought him back down to the Earth and like brother told you last night potentially said we are been in this second coming because the seventh seal in the book of redemption he says silence brought him down to the Earth and when the seven seal in the book of redemption was open down come the Lord on the earth so you and I will recognize this things and so we know we have been in the coming of the Lord since the seventh seal brought him down to the Earth say malach for open up the seven sheld come Lord on the earth that's why you go every day you know the Lord is around somewhere he's in your house is's on the job is everywhere when the child is sick when the husband is not well when there's no food on the table the Lord is around somewhere call him on the sin don't fight and force Don't Panic call Jesus on the sin because we are in the coming of the Lord better than Pentecostals and Baptist Methodist we recognize the Lord is among us we recognize we are in the coming of the Lord so we've been this coming of the Lord for some time now somebody in some Far distant future but we see the lord always around us and aen that knows that the Lord is always around him nothing can face that man that man is stabilized because you know the Lord is around you it controls your behavior it controls your thinking controls your words control your relationships because you know the Lord is around you know the angels of the Lord are Camp around those that fear Him and you don't want to do anything or think anything or say anything the Lord will not be pleased with because we recognize the coming of the Lord is going on glory to God amen glory to God Amen so the Lord has sleep in in secret may be seated he sing in secret like a in the night under the seventh seal because the seventh seal brought him down to the earth now time is going so I don't have too much time to read all this but what is this seventh seal what is this vehicle that brought him down to the Earth that the rest of the world knows nothing about that even many in the message say it's not open yet but that's the vehicle that he hides in sleep and come down on the earth oh glory to God amen amen am Oh Glory may see let's Co a little bit here let me read a few quotes here I didn't just quote it but let me just read a few quotes here what is the seven SE that to the because Revelation 81 says when he had opened the seven SE was silence so let's see whatam said about this won't take this because knows God by himself and God speaks to them and nobody can tell them sadly many people in the message are like that too it is called it is called childishness that's why they Pentecostal babies because they in this age that is called call the age of infinite wisdom they know it all they have it all figured out God loves them God speaks to them so they won't take from anybody isn't that how children are let let me leave that alone glory to God Amen so he said here on the seal on the seven sale page 555 229 now we to the eth verse or the first verse of the eth chapter of Revelation Revelation 81 we must remember that this seventh seal is the end of time of all things that's right the things written in the seven seal book SE up of the Plan of Redemption from before the fish of the world every bit ends it is the end it is the end of the struggling worldend it's the end of struggling nature is the end of everything in there is the end of the trumpets it's the end of the vs it's the end of the Earth it even ends the time time runs out on the seven seal amen Revelation 10th chapter the first to the seventh verse time runs out so it telling you right away 1017 that's the seventh seal by the way is telling you that the angel said town will be no more in the days of this great thing to happen everything runs out in this CH they at the end of this seven seal now notice the seventh seal is the end of the church age it's the end of the seven SE it's the end of the trumpets it's the end of the V and even ends the aing of the Millennium that's on this seven sale it's just like firing a rocket into the air and that rocket explodes hair and it goes up then it explodes again it puts out five stars one of those Stars explodes and five STS from it and one of them STS explodes it on out that's what the seven still is it just ends the time for the world it's end the time for this end the time for that it ends the time for this it ends time everything just ended up on that seventh SE now how is he going to do it that's what we don't know we don't know how isn't it we don't know it's even the time for all these things and the usering of the Millennium notice the breaking of this seal was so great that heaven was hushed by it in silence for the space of a half hour now is it great what is it it was hushed Heaven there wasn't a thing moved for half an hour on page 557 said no angels singing no Praises no Al service nothing there was silence harsh deadly silence in heaven half hour all the all the host of Heaven Was silent for this half hour when this seven mystery in the book of redemption was broke open think of it for the seven seal is broke the lamb breaks it you know what they were Ed by it they didn't know there it was now none of us know what this seven seal is but I'm going to tell you my revelation of it and now I am not PR to be a fanatic if I am I'm ignorant of it I'm not giving away to such larious things imaginary things I've said some things that are kind of strange to some people but when God comes around behind has Vindicated and says it's the truth and that's God's word it seems strange that way now as as I stand on this platform I have the revelation of that seven s revealed that seven seal is in a threefold manner that I will speak to you by God's help of onefold of it let's go over there first here the Revelation to begin with I want to tell you what it is one fall of it what happens is that those seven Thunders that he have thunder out I was forting to write that's what the mystery is laying behind those seven consecutive Thunders rolling out and people say the seventh seal was not open or here the prophet is saying the seventh Thunders is a secret behind the seven seal the silence there now why let's prove it let's prove it why it is a secret that no one knows about John was forbidden to write about it to even write a symbol about it this is why there was no activity in heaven it might give away the secret but it's so great it must be included because it's got to happen but when the seven Thunders now notice when the seven angels come forth to sound their trumpets there was one Thunder when Israel was gathered there was a trumpet when time shall be no more the last trumpet one Thunder but here is seven straight Thunders right in the Row 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven that perfect number seven thunders in a row altered not just one 2 3 4 5 six seven straights the heavens couldn't write about that Heavens can't know about it nothing else because there's nothing to go on it's a relaxing time it was so great till it kept secret from the angel now you know why if Satan should get a hold of it he might do great damage there's one thing he don't know he can interpret anything he wants to and imp personate any kind of a GI he wants but he can't know this it's not even written in the word it's a total secret the Angels everything shut up if they made one move it might give coming away so they just shut up we Happ everything St seven God's perfect number oh Hallelujah seven Thunders all straight together like they are spelling out something and Noti at that time John started to write John started to write and he said don't write it Jesus never spoke of it John Couldn't Write it Angel knew nothing about it oh Hallelujah so what is this seven seal from this quot here and so many other places I got to run brother let us know the seven seal that brought him down to earth is the End of Time seal is a Time ending seal everything ends on that seventh seal Hallelujah glory to God Amen because the seven seal brings Christ down to the Earth so if you're preaching your church the seventh seal it will end everything it will end the foolishness it will end the devil's programs whatever it is the seven SE is the End of Time glory to God but I got to run glory is that the seven seal is in the threefold manner threefold manner and on the rure 965 speaking about the seven the Rapture 965 he let us know what this Mana is the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout of the Archangel Trump of God hallelujah it let us know also that Revelation 10 is underneath the seven seal hallelujah hallelujah and in Revelation 10 there are two angels there a trumpet angel and a man message Angel is all connected under the seven seal and in Revelation 10 there's John the bride there is all connected under the seven seal in the coming of the Lord are you with me glory to God Amen and he also said the seven seal is like an exploding Rock rocket you throw one rocket in the skies it explodes to five and each one of the five explains another five what is this this represents fire power this represents a promise of power bu underneath the seven seal and time holy ghost power you shall receive power Hallelujah always spoke Friday morning you shall receive power a promise of power filed under the seven seal the sum total the sum total of all this is that John was commissioned to write everything s and he wrote Under the FR second third fth six but when the seven happened when the seven broke he was told don't WR it in other words if John wasn't told to not write it John could have written what the seven SE was and written everything from that time up until this time here but he said don't write it John he was foring to write it Hallelujah don't write what's already in the scriptures brother bam said it was read in the scriptures is a secret that's hidden in the scriptures and told John don't write it but it will be revealed in the end time when I sent to Elijah the prophet glory to God Amen and Elijah will reveal the seven seal in Revelation 10 all down through the Bible it will show you the angel amen Revelation 10 the Lord himself descending from Heaven Hallelujah he will show you the message Angel he will show you John the bride he will show you in there the call of the Resurrection oh Hallelujah glory to God Amen oh glory amen now watch Revelation 10 he said that's the seventh seal in Revelation 10 we see this Mighty angel Revelation 10 1-6 come down from heaven and when it cried out seven funders their voices he cried out with a loud voice and seven Thunders UT their voices and we see Revelation 10:7 there's another Angel the seventh angel in the coming of the Lord and then we go further down reel 108 there's John there because the voice the same voice spoke to John the angel take the book and John represents the bride so in the seventh seal there's the Lord himself there's the prophet Malachi the seventh angel and there's the bride you are represented underneath the seven seal you are represented in the scriptures Glory Glory amen am so there are three men players in this coming the Lord Jesus Christ himself the mighty rainbow Angel and Mal 4 called him the trumpet angel and then there's the man message Angel Revelation 107 who you and I know to be the prophet William Bram the great Elijah prophet of Malachi for and then the bride represented by John the by John is also there in the seventh seal those are the three great players in the coming of the Lord oh Hallelujah aren't you happy glory to God amen amen amen amen now watch watch what the events of Revelation 10 very closely because Malachi for said Jesus he does all three seven seal shout voice Trump seven seal three great players there you put them side by side there's a connection there somewhere Oh Glory to God Amen said Jesus he does all three Hallelujah hallu now watch closely here because here is where you are going to really understand the call to the resurrection here's a secret here let me R here the secret here Revelation 10 1-6 is a trumpet angel Jesus Christ amen amen what he does he he veils and hides himself because a secret he doesn't want them to know he sleeps as a thief in the night so he comes secretly sleeps in in secret he hides himself in the message Angel Revelation 107 and people see William BR William BR was not Jesus Christ no but Jesus Christ was veiled in him to do his coming is a secret glory to God amen hallelujah hallelujah amen amen hallelujah hallelujah and then and then and then Jesus Christ also veils Amen in general because Mal said he comes this is how is coming is first he appears and then he comes he appears in the shout and said that appearing is a sign of his coming how he will come so we notice how he came in Malachi 4 so we know how he's going to come in the bride he veils in Malachi form he hides in Malachi form so we know he's going to hide in the bride is appearing as a sign of his coming how he will come so Revelation 10:7 the trumpet angel has hidden in Malachi 4 and we know because as the sign high he will come to us amen Revelation 10 8-1 a he in the prize in John under the seven Cil and a seal a secret and people are still looking for the coming of the Lord while it's going on right now now watch what it does Amen oh my watch what he does here a sec let me say that again Jesus Christ the trumpet angel 1-6 he in the message Angel ration 107 to do the shout the first fall of the coming in the coming of the Lord the message going forth the seven Thunders they come SC out with the loud voice and seven Thunders out of their voices glory to God amen amen amen amen amen I'm trying to run here on the rapture he said the first thing the first thing comes when he starts descending from Heaven there's a shout what is it what is the shout not a noise the shout when you say I'll give you a shout out there's a message containing in it when you tell your friend when you tell your friend when you come to town give me a shout in other words when you come to town contact me with the message that you have coming to town a shout has a Content while he's sending a shout glory to God it has descend from heaven there is a shout what is a shout is a message to gather people together a message comes forth first lamb dreaming time what's the message rise up and Sh your Lambs Matthew 25 what watch was that the seventh watch not the six the seventh behold the brro cometh rise and trim your lambs and the deed some of them find they didn't even have any oil in their lamb but lamb streaming time oh church is lamp streaming time that's Mal four time L rise and trim your lamps and that's what we've been trying to tell you rise and trim your lamps don't yell your lamp be all smoked out don't let it be Smoked Out by filth by the World by the things of the world by sex and fi pornography rise and S your lamps glory to God amen glory to God Amen GL it's lamp streaming time watch he said it's Malachi four time Mal four time and here's where you're going to understand in Revelation 10 there are three calls there in Malachi four call a bright call and a call to the resurrection it tells you here Malachi four time Malachi four call a message going forth seven Thunders to call out a oh hallelujah hallelujah we know these things right just trying to get a message together for you you know this because you are a seventh believing people God Amen it's Malachi four time God Amen and then after Malachi 4 he fails in John the bride to do the voice of the Archangel in the coming of the Lord oh Hallelujah and that's where you have your bride call a voice call out to you the bride amen call out to you takes the message from Malachi 4 to go sear out the bride God Amen Hallelujah Mal first message going to set you out oh to God Amen to call out a bride to clothe you brother con spoke last night with the garments of his rightousness a message a message the end time message to go get a bride to God amen amen amen am oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah Malachi four time bright time Mal for call a bright call calling out a BRI you may be seated now the voice of the Archangel has two parts to it a revelation PA and a manifestation PA and in Revelation 10 like I said is hidden three calls according to the inspiration from Malachi for the prophet what are the three calls the Malachi for calls turned by the trumpet angel as it veils in the prophet Malachi 4 to shout out the seven Thunders Revelation 101-6 he bued him to shout out the Thunders that's Malachi for Hallelujah and the number two that's a bride call and the number three that's the call to the resurrection oh hallelujah hallelujah in Revelation 10 is hidden there amen the bread call and the call to the resurrection but under the voice of the Archangel one is a revelation one is the manifestation part of it glory to God Amen the trumpet angel Jesus he does all three now the briad call is a revelation part of the voice of the Archangel the message going forth to call you out call you out of the mess you are in call you out of the wall call you out of DRS that's the message going out calling out time and we have been called by that prophet's message the seven thund voices calling you out your pastor didn't call you out your father didn't call you out no man call you out the Lord himself call you out by the Thunders he called you by the Thunders you are responded to that bright call the bright call the Revelation PA of the voice of the Archangel is a calling out time calling the out of every denomination calling her out of Sin calling out of the world and calling into the coming of the Lord that's what I've been telling you you have been called into the coming of the Lord you have not been called to come to please the pastor you have not been called to please any man you have been called to come into the coming of the Lord because the Lord he has need of you he wants to use you to call the Resurrection the BR call a calling out time calling you into the coming of the Lord by the seven Thunder shout message of the message Angel of Malachi 4 and that message has G around the world to call you and here you are today you not been called to a church you're not been called to a group you not been called to a denomination you have been calling to the coming of the Lord and you're not here to please any man you're not here to please no Pastor no Deacon no 54 Minister nobody you are not here to please some man or some man you are here to please the Lord you got spiritual Faith now that recognizes only the word any man tells you anything you check it out with the word you check it out with the word I don't understand why anybody should be upset that you tell people to check it up by the word even Jesus said check the scriptures check me out in the scriptures check the scriptures they are there that testify of me check me up by the scriptures if I don't know what the scripture says don't believe me so give every man the word test check it out glory to God Amen don't let no man no Minister nobody put you under bondage like you don't believe the Apostle and they tell you anything and because you want to belong you want to be seen as not disbelieving the Apostle you believe anything is your soul at stake check it out with the word of God check it what Mal first said because you have been called to come into the coming of the Lord not to please any man to please God because the Lord has need of you glory bright call a calling out time what is it called out by the seven Thunders and after called out are we just called out to just hang around and just be be in foolishness and just go around my church is better than your church my pastor is more spiritual than your pastor is that what we called out for is that what it's all about let me is that what all about all this foolishness but malach 4 amen he called us out and we took his message and called out a bride Hallelujah no man takes the credit for Jesus Christ he called out the bride and he uses whomsoever he Wills but Jesus Christ touching out his pride is him doing the calling amen so calling you out they CA you out ca you ancestry in different companies different churches and what's supposed to happen why you are waiting for the manifestation of the voice of the archangel you in different companies different groups different churches to be nourished from the storehouse that's still the calling out because you and I know when we come from Pentecost from denominations there are so many things we don't even understand so many things hang on us but he seats Us in church under a Ministry to school us to tutor us to train us to child train us hallelujah to pour them seven virtue seeds of his life into us growing up into him in all things getting away from our emotions and get into the only acable motive for Christian service Hallelujah calling out time called out and then nourish from the storehouse call out by the seven Thunders and then nourish by the seven Thunders from the storehouse so the bread call is this he calls you at first and then he nourishes you tutoring child training training you to grow into the stature of a perfect man sowing his seeds of his own life into you than seven funder voices preach as seed preach as a revelation a seed that will bring forth the miracle to transform you to change you from what you was into what you are to be to transform you into the place to where you can receive the call to the resurrection and bring on the dead in Christ glory to God Amen and that has been going on the bright call call by the seven Thunders after called out must be nourished and then after nourished the seven Thunders has been the food to nourish us hallelujah and after nourished we must have a promise to live for I don't want to hold you too long because I'm already way past my time here but a man any man at all that has nothing to live for is living is useless even is hopeless so calling out time it call us out nourishes Us by the seventh thund us and then gives us a promise a promise to leave for some to wake up tomorrow and press towards so you will not be self-sufficient in yourself so this calling out time is composed of called out from wherever you are in into the coming of the Lord and then nourished and then number three a promise to live for what is that promise the call to the resurrection by the voice of the Archangel that's the promise to live for Oh Glory Glory we have a promise to live for the call to the resurrection Jesus told his disciples our friend Lazarus sleep let's go wake him up and Jesus Is Telling You Malachi 4 all the way down to Paul arenus all of them are sleeping let's go wake them and the Bible tells you they without us cannot be made perfect Hallelujah they did not live long enough but here we are and John represent that bride that will not taste of death until they see the Lord coming in his resurrection power that's what you are here for all underneath the seven seal glory to God Amen the call to the resurrection is the promise to live for the call of the Resurrection is the manifestation path of the voice of the Archangel it is Charity it is the voice of the Archangel it is the eighth virtue it is heaven the Dynamics amen anointing you anointing the word of goding to your flesh for a display amen of signs and wonders and miracles literal life of Jesus Christ the of the Resurrection it is adoption time Glory Glory when Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead he was going to raise Lazarus up by his voice he just invited all disciples to come and witness the resurrection of Lazarus but this time around he is not inviting you to witness you are not an onlooker is inviting you to bring on the resurrection is inviting you to be the want to call the resurrection so they call to the resurrection is not just a message you receive it's a manifestation you manifest the resurrection you bring on the resurrection there without us cannot be made perfect and when you are adopted and you are standing there like Jesus Christ in John 11 the voice of God in you the voice of the chief Angel the ACT Angel Jesus Christ that voice cries out the loud voice seven Thunder voices the Thunder flashing up and down the Earth and Uphill begin to come oh Hallelujah that's your promise to live for Glory when you are adopted and positionally Born Into the kingdom of God then you have been called then to the resurrection when you are adopted and positionally Born Into the kingdom of God when charity has an the word into your flesh and you become the word made flesh Jesus Christ Veil on the inside of you then that same Jesus that raised up Lazarus from the dead is buil on the inside of you then you have been called to the resurrection that is your call to the resurrection Oh Glory oh amen amen glory to God the C of the Resurrection what is it it is adoption it is perfection when the trumpet angel Jesus Christ adopts you unveils himself on the inside of you to identify the voice of the Archangel in the coming of the Lord he will be in you he will speak by the voice the voice of the chief Angel Hallelujah the voice of authority the voice of power say of the Lord of keep still that is your call to the resurrection it is adoption time glory glory to God when you adopted there a trumpet angel calling you to the resurrection when you adopted he's calling you then let us go go and wake them up let us go and wake up the sleeping Saints like our friend Lazarus sleeping let's go wake them up Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah Oh Glory to God amen amen
