[20:08] thank your musicians to ephesians
[20:10] chapter four
[20:11] reading verse 11 to 13. we just have one
[20:14] scripture this morning
[20:16] ephesians 4
[20:18] to 11-13 greetings
[20:20] in the precious name of jesus we greet
[20:22] those
[20:24] connected us on the internet god bless
[20:26] you and welcome
[20:35] verse 11 of ephesians 4
[20:39] and he gives some apostles and some
[20:41] prophets and some
[20:43] evangelists and some pastors
[20:46] and teachers
[20:48] for the perfection of the saints
[20:51] for the work of the ministry
[20:53] for the edifying of the body of christ
[20:56] till we all come
[20:58] in the
[20:59] in the unity of the faith and of the
[21:01] knowledge of the son of god
[21:03] unto a perfect man
[21:05] unto the measure
[21:06] of the stature of the fullness of christ
[21:09] may god bless his word you may be seated
[21:11] or praise the lord
[21:24] well this morning i have a title
[21:26] the perfecting
[21:28] of the saints
[21:30] that's the title this morning the
[21:31] perfecting
[21:33] of the saints
[21:34] i'll have an inspiration
[21:36] the ministry
[21:37] of perfection yeah
[21:39] i know a lot of things happening outside
[21:42] but europe uh britain england los
[21:45] angeles the scientists
[21:47] say the fault is moving and shifting
[21:49] it's just a matter of time
[21:51] a lot of things is happening outside
[21:53] but i'm not
[21:54] going to talk about that this morning
[21:57] we want to deal with what's on the
[21:58] inside
[22:02] because the saints have to come to
[22:03] perfection
[22:05] we have got to return to the ministry of
[22:07] jesus christ
[22:09] and always god have to use somebody's
[22:11] bodies flesh buddies
[22:13] to raise the dead
[22:15] that that's how we're gonna work
[22:17] somebody gonna be a channel
[22:19] of god
[22:20] for his spirit to flow through
[22:22] and that body gonna be his wife
[22:24] his bride his people
[22:27] nothing going to stop it because the
[22:28] mouth of the lord had spoken it
[22:31] we spoke sometime back about prophecy
[22:33] and process that for jesus born in
[22:35] bethlehem they had a call for taxation
[22:37] to get joseph out from where he is
[22:40] leave joseph in his comfort zone he stay
[22:42] right there and marry up the baby right
[22:43] there but that will break the scriptures
[22:45] so in order that the scriptures be not
[22:47] broken
[22:48] god had to force the issue to get this
[22:50] re the train moving
[22:52] to get things turning and to get you to
[22:55] connect with your scriptures god have to
[22:57] get the train around your life
[22:59] moving
[23:00] so god will create situations and issues
[23:03] in order to bring you into the
[23:04] fulfillment of your word of prophecy
[23:08] hallelujah
[23:09] it's not coming to you you are going to
[23:11] wait
[23:12] [Applause]
[23:14] hallelujah
[23:15] in other words you have to come into
[23:17] your position you wasn't born into it
[23:19] you have to come into it hallelujah
[23:22] praise god you are predestinated to it
[23:25] so therefore you had to walk out of what
[23:26] you're in to go into what god wants you
[23:28] to be in
[23:29] isn't that right redemption is always in
[23:31] two paths coming out of and going into
[23:33] or unless people come out in this
[23:35] message but have what have they gone
[23:36] into
[23:37] praise god another denomination another
[23:39] cult another group of people just
[23:41] gathering together but there's a
[23:42] promised land called the ephesians land
[23:45] there's a land of ephesians
[23:47] joshua didn't cross over just to cross
[23:48] over he crossed over to give them an
[23:50] inheritance
[23:52] come on now
[23:53] moses ministry could only take them out
[23:56] come on now
[23:57] i'm saying it again moses anointed moses
[24:01] ministry could only bring the people out
[24:04] it take what just will anoint him it
[24:06] take the holy ghost anointing it take
[24:08] the ministry of the spirit to take the
[24:10] people in
[24:11] for 40 years we had moses
[24:14] you're not hearing what i'm saying come
[24:16] out the baptist come on the necklace
[24:17] come on come on come on come out but
[24:19] there's gotta come out
[24:21] we'll be no longer coming out
[24:23] but we are going in
[24:25] to our land of promise
[24:27] to your inheritance to your land
[24:30] hallelujah
[24:34] let me see that praise god
[24:37] oh my god when somebody got sold out in
[24:39] the old testament that await either two
[24:41] things
[24:42] somebody to bail them out
[24:44] pay for them all some rich man willing
[24:46] and rich to be build them out and pull
[24:48] them out or wait for the jubilee
[24:51] because they have jubilee provided the
[24:52] grace of god for you to be delivered

[24:57] so if you're in slavery and some rich
[24:58] uncle could pull you out they could pay
[25:00] for you and you get out but in case you
[25:02] have no rich uncle ruiz family or nobody
[25:04] to redeem you you have to wait till the
[25:07] jubilee come and when the jubilee come

[25:11] trumpets you'll hear some trump inside
[25:13] of blow a trumpet gonna start to give a
[25:15] certain song that you don't have to sin
[25:17] no more you don't have to backslide no
[25:19] more you gotta be up and down no more
[25:21] you'll have to surrender to the devil no
[25:23] more come on now

[25:28] no preacher no pastor no minister
[25:32] you're married to no man behind the
[25:33] pulpit you're married to jesus christ
[25:36] or give the lord a shout of prayer

[26:19] let's get on now
[26:21] all right
[26:23] from the guide
[26:24] justin phil
[26:26] now remember this
[26:28] these are the things he's talking about
[26:32] the first the night the morning he
[26:34] preached a statue of a perfect man where
[26:36] he had all the virtues faith and
[26:37] knowledge and temperance and patience
[26:39] this is the night service
[26:40] he's preaching the guide
[26:42] and he's he's going back now and
[26:44] connecting to the morning service he
[26:46] said these are the things that build the
[26:49] servant of christ see faithfulness then
[26:52] virtue he doesn't say church is the
[26:55] thing that built he didn't say people is
[26:57] eating that bill he doesn't say deacon
[26:59] and elders and trustees isn't that bill
[27:01] this even the christ that might build a
[27:03] man ministry and reputation but these
[27:06] are the things
[27:07] which is faith and virtue you can't see
[27:09] those things those are invisible things
[27:12] you could see a building you could see
[27:13] officers stand on their post of duty
[27:15] that's thing you could see with your
[27:16] eyes but you see these things these are
[27:18] inside things these could only manifest
[27:21] through the flesh through the body it
[27:23] had the thunder they had to rip off the
[27:25] word didn't remain word in the beginning
[27:27] was the word it was invisible hallelujah
[27:29] and the word become flesh that is how
[27:31] the word becomes visible and dwell among
[27:33] us and that same invisible word that
[27:36] you're reading all these years you're
[27:38] hearing all these years that word has to
[27:41] become flesh
[27:43] could i get a shout in the house
[27:49] i am not your priest
[27:54] the catholic church have that all right
[27:57] but the priest is the man and he just do
[27:58] everything and you're good to go
[28:01] this is for all of us
[28:03] lady members anybody believers
[28:06] worshipers all of us
[28:08] that will have to register inside your
[28:10] system
[28:11] these virtues have become part of your
[28:13] being
[28:14] part of your very life you made a pledge
[28:16] last week to pray without ceasing until
[28:19] these virtues become part of your system
[28:22] we said how many pledges is by the grace
[28:24] of god how have your prayer week been

[28:32] investment in these virtues

[36:23] research and development of different
[36:25] products and have the hackers want to
[36:28] hack into the computers to find out what
[36:30] the research is about but the devil
[36:32] couldn't hack this one because when the
[36:33] seven seal broke
[36:35] when the seven seal broke there was
[36:38] sirens so the old hacker couldn't hack
[36:41] this
[36:42] oh but i'm telling you the silence about

[37:22] communication so the devil can intercept
[37:25] what god is telling you the devil
[37:27] can't do anything about your healing the
[37:30] devil can't do anything about your
[37:32] deliverance the devil can't do anything
[37:35] about your breakthrough or give the lord

[39:39] [Applause]
[39:49] [Music]
[39:51] faithful
[39:52] virtue
[39:54] remember
[39:55] the holy spirit
[39:57] cannot cap
[39:59] the building of god
[40:01] until
[40:03] these things are operating by the spirit
[40:08] amen
[40:09] now these are careful words
[40:11] and spirit given words
[40:13] he could have said operated by
[40:15] revelation
[40:17] but he didn't say that he said the
[40:19] virtues have to be operated by the
[40:21] spirit
[40:22] in other words it had to operate at the
[40:25] subconscious level
[40:29] where it is automatic
[40:32] at the conscious level you have to be
[40:34] nice you have to smile you just had a
[40:36] call with your husband but somebody
[40:38] knocked on the door and you can't open
[40:40] it like that you have to change from
[40:42] that oh mean look into the smile look
[40:44] because somebody's at the door that is
[40:47] you working
[40:48] the thing
[40:53] but when it's operating by the spirit
[40:56] you talk a husband right you talk to
[40:58] your wife right you talk to whoever at
[41:01] the door right because you are just
[41:04] right
[41:05] it's the spirit that's operated within
[41:08] your soul
[41:10] [Applause]
[41:14] what is it
[41:15] you are dying and christ is coming to
[41:18] life
[41:20] i see it again
[41:22] you
[41:23] are dying
[41:24] and christ
[41:26] is coming to life
[41:30] then you begin to see things in your
[41:32] life that you know you can't do
[41:34] then it is him
[41:36] it can't be you
[41:37] oh hallelujah come on now come on now
[41:40] help me somebody
[41:48] so these virtues
[41:50] have to be operated by the spirit
[41:53] how it could be operated by the spirit
[41:54] of this world and come
[41:56] so the spirit is
[41:58] promised amen
[42:02] i know it's not preached like that
[42:05] amen as a promise
[42:06] but it is a promise
[42:09] jesus he had moses ministry
[42:12] to bring them
[42:13] i like those words as far as the bethany
[42:18] that's how the word bible describe it he
[42:20] brought them up as far
[42:22] as the bethany and he was taken up and
[42:25] they waving bye-bye
[42:27] that's as fast he could take them no no
[42:30] no joshua which is represented by holy
[42:33] spirit
[42:34] because jesus prophesied if i don't go
[42:36] the comforter will not come
[42:37] so just like to hold on to me word

[43:05] he gonna take you further
[43:07] he's gonna break upon your life
[43:09] all you've got to do now is to create
[43:11] the atmosphere
[43:12] for him to come down
[43:14] because holy ghost can come and dry
[43:16] holy cows gotta come and dumb mulch and
[43:18] people
[43:19] poor eagles can't come and that holy cow
[43:22] come on sin holy ghost god come on

[49:46] revelation chapter eight and when you
[49:47] opened the seventh seal
[49:49] there were signs in heaven about this
[49:50] piece of effingham
[49:52] and i saw
[49:53] the seven angels
[49:55] which stood before god
[49:57] and to them were given seven trumpets
[50:00] and another angel came and stood at the
[50:02] altar having a golden censer
[50:05] there was given to him much incense
[50:08] that he should offer it with prayers
[50:11] of all saints
[50:12] upon the golden altar which was before
[50:15] the throne
[50:16] and the smoke of the incense which came
[50:19] with the prayers of the saints
[50:21] ascended up before god
[50:24] out of the angel's hand
[50:26] and the angel took the sensor
[50:28] and filled it with fire of the altar
[50:31] and cast it onto the earth
[50:33] and there were voices
[50:35] and tundras
[50:36] and lightnings
[50:37] and an earthquake
[50:41] did you hear that
[50:43] but the prayers of the saints
[50:45] angel take the incense
[50:47] cast it upon the earth
[50:49] and they were tendons
[50:51] voices
[50:52] lightning and an earthquake all that
[50:54] tied together
[50:59] hallelujah
[51:00] we approached men we are approaching the
[51:02] judgment tower
[51:04] gods and elijah before
[51:06] that terrible day of the lord
[51:07] [Applause]
[51:09] oh hallelujah could somebody say amen
[51:13] don't forget that now this is here first
[51:16] first your faith virtual knowledge and
[51:17] so forth is to be added to it until the
[51:20] complete statue of christ is made
[51:22] manifest then the holy spirit comes upon
[51:24] it and seals it as one body and by your
[51:28] fruit you are known
[51:30] when all this takes place
[51:32] watch
[51:34] the place of worldliness and ungodliness
[51:36] all unbelief is cast out all the things
[51:38] the world is passed away there's nothing
[51:40] but a new creature in christ then grieve
[51:43] not the holy spirit whereby you are
[51:45] sealed until the day of your redemption
[51:47] the ceiling is the holy spirit the cap
[51:50] is what seals us into the body
[51:53] the cap seals us into the body after all
[51:57] these virtues are added
[51:59] from ordination he said until these
[52:01] things are scripturally proven and
[52:04] sealed into you the holy spirit seals
[52:06] you in as an individual so that's why
[52:10] taking refuge in churches is no talking
[52:13] and that's what they have deceived the
[52:15] people with that if the church is the
[52:17] holy ghost or the church gives them the
[52:19] right to to the rapture it doesn't give
[52:21] you that the church is like a covering
[52:24] out of the church there's going to be a
[52:25] bride who's going to be wife of the lamb

[52:32] while all the others just watching the
[52:34] clothes and washing the dress his wife
[52:36] gonna put on the dress

[52:40] rashes of the saints hallelujah let us
[52:42] rejoice and be glad for the marriage of
[52:44] the lamb has come and his wife not the
[52:47] church members the church members hoping
[52:49] to be right to me it must be but his
[52:51] wife
[52:52] got to make herself ready you got to see
[52:54] something to put on you've got to see
[52:56] something to act on it

[58:36] [Music]
[58:44] a fifo minister
[58:47] will be
[58:50] a manifestation
[58:52] of a positionally placed son of god
[58:59] forget all who say the fivefold
[59:01] the endearfall
[59:04] that is not the full god talking about
[59:06] when god said for god set
[59:08] [Music]
[59:09] in the church not man appointed
[59:12] not somebody voted in this is when god
[59:18] and when god set a man
[59:20] but abraham was born a prophet he was
[59:22] always a prophet but god told him do the
[59:25] work of an evangelist
[59:27] until
[59:28] he gets set
[59:31] [Applause]
[59:36] are you following what i'm preaching
[59:38] so even though he was born a prophet
[59:42] he had to do the work of evangelists and
[59:44] talk until god set him
[59:47] up
[59:48] [Music]
[59:50] and god set him
[59:52] by the opening of six seals
[59:55] sex
[59:58] because the word come to the prophet
[59:59] because christ is the seventh seal
[1:00:01] [Applause]
[1:00:05] so the prophet will win six and christ
[1:00:07] stood there
[1:00:08] in that prophet
[1:00:09] as the seventh seal
[1:00:11] and out of the
[1:00:13] seven tunnels
[1:00:15] who rode out
[1:00:17] to gather the bride together
[1:00:19] to give the bright faith
[1:00:21] that's what about how to be prayer
[1:00:22] out of the mother of christ
[1:00:24] the mighty angel
[1:00:26] oh give the lord a shout
[1:00:29] in the house
[1:00:30] [Applause]
[1:00:37] so the six seals indicated him as that
[1:00:40] elijah malachi 4.
[1:00:43] now he was ready to reveal the son of
[1:00:45] man
[1:00:46] who is christ
[1:00:47] the soul of the good seed
[1:00:50] veiled in a son of man
[1:00:52] these son of man speaking bridal
[1:00:54] promises speaking prophecy
[1:00:57] oh hallelujah
[1:00:59] are you with me
[1:01:02] fightful minister
[1:01:03] will be a manifestation of positionally
[1:01:06] placed son of god amen in other words
[1:01:09] jesus
[1:01:10] walking on two feet
[1:01:14] not intellectuals
[1:01:16] not church politicians
[1:01:19] and manipulators
[1:01:20] or message popes
[1:01:22] or spiritual dictatorship all of that
[1:01:24] yes so don't think i just playing with
[1:01:26] words there
[1:01:28] we are not talking about a sign of the
[1:01:29] fivefold
[1:01:31] or a sign of the turtle
[1:01:34] or a sign of adoption
[1:01:36] a sign
[1:01:37] points you to the destination
[1:01:39] i am speaking about an adopted son
[1:01:43] veiling the pillar of fire
[1:01:46] with
[1:01:47] sigium
[1:01:48] [Applause]
[1:01:55] not with doctrine
[1:01:56] not with teachings because peter was in
[1:01:59] the body
[1:02:01] he was an adopted son
[1:02:03] and peter had
[1:02:05] jim
[1:02:06] [Applause]
[1:02:07] in him
[1:02:09] so when he went to conure's house while
[1:02:11] peter speak
[1:02:13] the holy ghost
[1:02:15] the spirit and the word was one
[1:02:17] when he speak the word he speak in
[1:02:18] spirit and other sons got quickened
[1:02:22] made alive
[1:02:24] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:02:27] hallelujah
[1:02:28] peter was god's channel
[1:02:31] of
[1:02:32] communication for god's inspiration
[1:02:36] to flow through
[1:02:38] and you're going to have a repeat of
[1:02:39] that
[1:02:40] peter
[1:02:42] the throne of god that was once in
[1:02:44] heaven
[1:02:45] that was in jesus christ was known in
[1:02:47] the heart of peter
[1:02:49] that's what we're talking about
[1:02:51] a man filled the purifier
[1:02:54] hallelujah
[1:02:56] what will it be
[1:02:57] it will be the ministry
[1:02:59] of jesus christ it will be a ministry of
[1:03:03] perfection to bring the saints to
[1:03:05] perfection
[1:03:06] all glory to god
[1:03:08] hallelujah
[1:03:14] [Music]
[1:03:19] still want to finish the statement
[1:03:21] god picks
[1:03:23] and ordains the faithful ministry
[1:03:26] for the body of christ
[1:03:28] the entire bride body
[1:03:31] so the fightful ministry not just a
[1:03:32] local ministry the fivefold ministry
[1:03:35] will be an international ministry
[1:03:37] that affects
[1:03:39] and influences
[1:03:41] and speaks to
[1:03:42] and communicates to
[1:03:44] the entire bright body
[1:03:46] [Applause]
[1:03:49] amen
[1:03:52] so what brother i'm taught
[1:03:54] is that a man must be adopted
[1:03:56] gifted and sent out as a fifo minister
[1:04:00] so we have to do the work of what we're
[1:04:02] working at
[1:04:03] until we are placed positionally
[1:04:05] and sent
[1:04:07] hallelujah
[1:04:09] with that authority the whole heaven
[1:04:11] behind
[1:04:12] those men
[1:04:13] because they are ambassadors of the
[1:04:15] throne
[1:04:17] did you hear what i'm saying
[1:04:18] they become ambassadors of the throne
[1:04:21] ambassadors are special passport
[1:04:23] their special rights and liberty and
[1:04:25] freedom they pass in special quarters
[1:04:27] and special places because the
[1:04:29] ambassador of this country in that
[1:04:30] country but then you become an
[1:04:31] ambassador
[1:04:33] of the very throne of god
[1:04:35] when you speak god speaks when you say
[1:04:37] heaven lock up heaven lock up when you
[1:04:39] say heaven unlock heaven unluck
[1:04:42] it will be the word of god coming forth
[1:04:44] from the mouth of god
[1:04:46] brother brother said once more the world
[1:04:48] will hear direct from god and that is
[1:04:51] not about playing books and tapes he's
[1:04:53] not talking about that he's talking
[1:04:55] about man
[1:04:56] that fail in the purifier
[1:04:59] having the voice of god
[1:05:01] you're going to know is the voice of god
[1:05:04] because the voice of god brings back
[1:05:06] that real supernatural power
[1:05:15] not no high-level word talk
[1:05:18] high-level revelation talk that is still
[1:05:22] [Applause]
[1:05:28] [Applause]
[1:05:31] [Music]
[1:05:34] we believe there's a church coming into
[1:05:37] that perfection
[1:05:39] the ministry of perfection
[1:05:42] where the officers the opposers and
[1:05:44] prophets and pastors and teachers
[1:05:46] evangelists for the perfection of the
[1:05:48] church them pastors
[1:05:51] and teachers and so forth will be so
[1:05:54] with the word
[1:05:55] till they will work right up to the
[1:05:57] coming of the lord
[1:05:59] not with their dreams
[1:06:01] not for their own private revelation but
[1:06:03] with the word
[1:06:05] that's why you have to know what the
[1:06:06] prophet prophesy
[1:06:07] because if you don't know it what people
[1:06:09] interpret to you you will interpret it
[1:06:11] as that is the word
[1:06:15] god not trying to vindicate me you know
[1:06:17] god trying to vindicate his word
[1:06:20] [Applause]
[1:06:22] if i die
[1:06:24] if i am no longer in his pulpit this
[1:06:27] word will still be vindicated
[1:06:29] [Applause]
[1:06:33] do you understand that
[1:06:34] [Applause]
[1:06:37] [Music]
[1:06:40] [Applause]
[1:06:45] that's why god gives
[1:06:47] give samuel ruffin up hallelujah
[1:06:48] mourning for saul he's away
[1:06:50] why are you wasting time on soul
[1:06:53] see i'll find a better man
[1:06:58] what a more time to
[1:06:59] it's 40 years they had soul
[1:07:02] god said time up
[1:07:04] they choose that spiritual man no i'm
[1:07:07] going to get my man
[1:07:08] go and anoint him
[1:07:10] who
[1:07:13] one of the son of jesse i like how god
[1:07:14] has do things he said god tells that
[1:07:16] samuel david david
[1:07:19] but like the process
[1:07:24] our god is an awesome god
[1:07:26] do you see that samuel can i go down and
[1:07:28] say i'm looking for david anybody know
[1:07:29] who david all right david don't mind the
[1:07:31] thing and he's anointed with a private
[1:07:33] ceremony and do that god not a person
[1:07:35] like that
[1:07:36] amen number one is a tough job to anoint
[1:07:39] a man as king when the next king is
[1:07:41] alive you're looking to get your head
[1:07:43] off
[1:07:45] so the question was how do i do it he's
[1:07:47] able to just say you're going to have
[1:07:48] fellowship you're going to confuse you
[1:07:50] know
[1:07:51] you got to move with wisdom you're going
[1:07:52] to kill him
[1:07:53] [Music]
[1:08:08] the whole thing and let samuel go to the
[1:08:11] process
[1:08:12] to let samuel know assuredly i don't see
[1:08:15] as man says
[1:08:17] i see a little different
[1:08:19] so i said let them pass through under
[1:08:20] the desert may they recognize there's no
[1:08:22] spirit witness let them keep passing
[1:08:24] keep moving brothers
[1:08:26] don't stop now don't handle the line
[1:08:28] keep going
[1:08:30] whenever they pass you start time and
[1:08:31] say
[1:08:33] is this all
[1:08:35] god god will waste time if god sent me
[1:08:37] here for
[1:08:38] a better man it has to have a better
[1:08:40] manner
[1:08:41] so you you think you waste time coming
[1:08:42] seriously this morning
[1:08:50] you came for purpose
[1:08:53] you came for enlightenment
[1:08:55] you came for perfection
[1:08:57] you came to raise up above where you are
[1:08:59] you have to see something bigger than
[1:09:00] you better than you greater than you
[1:09:03] more awesome than you mightier than you
[1:09:05] that could pull you from where you are
[1:09:07] to where you ought to become
[1:09:09] [Applause]
[1:09:19] the clarinets are a nice little thing
[1:09:20] for me
[1:09:21] you don't have no bones
[1:09:23] but it could break hearts
[1:09:25] [Music]
[1:09:29] be careful what you see
[1:09:31] [Applause]
[1:09:32] be careful with your words
[1:09:36] they say mark the perfect man
[1:09:38] he can
[1:09:40] bridle his tongue
[1:09:46] glory
[1:09:47] enjoying the lord
[1:09:49] amen
[1:09:51] so therefore the dynamics
[1:09:53] has to come
[1:09:55] to
[1:09:56] a fifo ministry amen
[1:10:00] isn't that right
[1:10:02] there is going to be the ministry of
[1:10:05] christ
[1:10:06] so that the dynamics is what will
[1:10:08] positionally please
[1:10:10] the fightful ministry
[1:10:12] but a brahmana in your trip report
[1:10:14] listen to this i don't really hear
[1:10:16] ministers talking much about this but
[1:10:18] others say
[1:10:19] but lebron said and my brethren here
[1:10:21] this morning speaking and i pray that
[1:10:23] each of these ministers in here
[1:10:26] these ministering spirits that god hear
[1:10:28] my prayer
[1:10:30] and i pray
[1:10:32] that you will purge that gift that's in
[1:10:35] them
[1:10:38] are men arrogant this is that
[1:10:44] and they're showing the muscles and
[1:10:45] bones they push them
[1:10:48] if they're preachers
[1:10:50] make them better preachers
[1:10:53] if the evangelists make them better
[1:10:55] evangelists
[1:10:56] if their teachers make them better
[1:10:58] teachers
[1:10:59] if their pastors make them better
[1:11:00] pastors god grant that they will be
[1:11:02] filled with the spirit of god and will
[1:11:05] be energized by that great supervine
[1:11:08] that will give them life eternal and
[1:11:10] power to minister with and to touch the
[1:11:13] needy world as it is so needy today
[1:11:17] so he is talking about effective
[1:11:19] ministry
[1:11:20] he's taken about empowered ministry he's
[1:11:23] talking about ministry that could only
[1:11:25] grow as you are purged and cleansed and
[1:11:28] taken through god's grinder
[1:11:30] otherwise known as place of trying
[1:11:35] amen
[1:11:39] this is what i'm seeing right now
[1:11:42] the first sign
[1:11:44] of the ministry of christ
[1:11:47] is power
[1:11:48] virtue
[1:11:50] flowing
[1:11:51] amen
[1:11:52] and that scripture i have is mark 5 30
[1:11:55] and it says here
[1:11:57] and jesus
[1:11:59] that woman touch him vote you left him
[1:12:01] and jesus
[1:12:03] immediately knowing in himself that
[1:12:05] virtue had gone out of him turn him
[1:12:08] about in the presence that who touched
[1:12:09] my clothes
[1:12:15] the amplified said and jesus recognizing
[1:12:18] in himself that power proceeding from
[1:12:21] him
[1:12:23] had gone forth turned around
[1:12:26] immediately in the crowd and said who
[1:12:28] touched my clothes
[1:12:30] so we're talking about not revelation
[1:12:32] but we're talking about
[1:12:34] resident power
[1:12:37] permanent power
[1:12:40] not temporary power
[1:12:43] ah
[1:12:44] the power that they receive in the upper
[1:12:46] room was not temporary
[1:12:50] what jesus gave them in matthew 10 was
[1:12:53] temporary because judas was there the
[1:12:55] old bunch of them had power because
[1:12:57] jesus put that on them
[1:12:59] amen
[1:13:01] they was even really saved
[1:13:03] in that sense
[1:13:04] there was him sanctified they were just
[1:13:06] disciples
[1:13:08] they in contact with jesus and they like
[1:13:09] jesus
[1:13:11] they have jesus reputation with them
[1:13:15] everybody know they were jesus and they
[1:13:17] have the authority of jesus yes but that
[1:13:19] wasn't resident in them
[1:13:22] so you have to give them promises and
[1:13:24] say you know what you feel you have to
[1:13:25] become inside of you
[1:13:27] because everybody are wrong at getting
[1:13:28] part of it
[1:13:30] and one time
[1:13:31] they said lord we want to stop somebody
[1:13:33] who didn't in your name
[1:13:35] and they were jealous they're going to
[1:13:36] fight with people who doing things not
[1:13:38] not with them
[1:13:39] they have problems among one another
[1:13:41] who's the greatest
[1:13:43] who jesus loved more their own issues
[1:13:46] they were men until god shake them down
[1:13:49] and bring them into one mind one heart
[1:13:51] one accord and then you could step into
[1:13:53] them then nobody are jealous you had
[1:13:55] your portion it's one thing to have your
[1:13:57] portion man
[1:13:58] oh glory to god when you have your
[1:14:00] portion you have nobody else to fight up
[1:14:01] with
[1:14:02] nobody can steal your joy it's your own
[1:14:05] your own joy
[1:14:07] you have it
[1:14:09] so when peter had this resident thing in
[1:14:10] him that is why people could say silvan
[1:14:12] gold i none such as i have i give and
[1:14:15] you have to have it to give it
[1:14:17] let's go forward
[1:14:20] but branham how god set some in the
[1:14:22] church
[1:14:24] true
[1:14:25] labor pains
[1:14:28] not true conventions
[1:14:31] not your specials and singing and
[1:14:32] preaching and revelations no true
[1:14:35] shout out labor pains
[1:14:37] shout out again
[1:14:39] one more time shout it out
[1:14:41] that means you're making baby
[1:14:43] oh give the lord a shout
[1:14:46] you're laboring to bring food
[1:14:48] [Applause]
[1:14:52] oh they get remembered sometimes
[1:14:57] you can let it even float on that one
[1:15:00] all the time you have pain but you get
[1:15:01] tremendous now
[1:15:06] people don't want no pain you know no
[1:15:07] pain in a marriage no pain in the
[1:15:08] relationship if you give them a chance
[1:15:10] they get no test lord no tests
[1:15:14] so why should anybody you know you want
[1:15:16] to go on a job no interview
[1:15:19] just let's go in just go in
[1:15:22] a madman will be doing that
[1:15:25] that's right
[1:15:27] if anybody's just sending people in that
[1:15:29] job just just go keep on going this take
[1:15:30] take whatever post you want
[1:15:32] whatever trouble whatever player wants
[1:15:34] you can take that too
[1:15:36] god carry on no not even natural man
[1:15:38] running business like that
[1:15:40] that's why i have tests examination it
[1:15:43] have all the interviews it have all
[1:15:45] these things to filter the process
[1:15:46] they're going to have all types out
[1:15:48] there good bad ugly ragamuffin thieves
[1:15:51] bandits
[1:15:54] that's why god put the angels of god
[1:15:55] between the garden of eden
[1:15:57] he said least adam in his condition eat
[1:16:00] at that and go continuing like that
[1:16:02] but eternal life god said got it
[1:16:07] so they had to block adam from that tree
[1:16:09] don't let him touch that tree
[1:16:13] god has set some in the church through
[1:16:15] the labor pains they get tremendous some
[1:16:17] time then he says when a church here we
[1:16:19] go now is groaning
[1:16:21] under the persecution of the outside
[1:16:23] world that is not bandits and robbers
[1:16:25] and drunkards that's church people
[1:16:27] okay that believing on the lord jesus
[1:16:31] that here we go the promise of the holy
[1:16:33] ghost is just as real to us as it was
[1:16:36] the pentecost he didn't say you are the
[1:16:38] holy ghost he didn't say that he said
[1:16:40] when the church is believing that the
[1:16:43] promise of the holy ghost is just as
[1:16:44] real
[1:16:45] as it was the pentecost
[1:16:47] watch watch how they groan
[1:16:49] and cry on the labor pains
[1:16:53] when they are born one
[1:16:55] and positionally born to
[1:16:58] in the kingdom
[1:17:00] then god sets in the church
[1:17:02] some apostles
[1:17:04] some prophets some teachers some pastors
[1:17:11] he don't set them in conventions
[1:17:13] he don't set them because this one like
[1:17:15] them and this one don't like this one he
[1:17:16] doesn't set them that way true labor
[1:17:18] pains how they grown how they travel yes
[1:17:22] yes yes
[1:17:23] ministers have to grow and travel too
[1:17:26] [Applause]
[1:17:31] if they don't go in and travel
[1:17:33] it's on their way to tribulation
[1:17:35] because we have to put
[1:17:37] into the ministry of jesus christ it has
[1:17:39] to come forward man have to die
[1:17:42] [Music]
[1:17:45] [Applause]
[1:17:47] then the holy ghost sets them in the
[1:17:48] church apostles prophets teachers some
[1:17:50] pastors some evangelists then he gives
[1:17:52] in to their speaking in tongues
[1:17:54] interpretation of tongues knowledge
[1:17:55] wisdom gifts of healing all kind of
[1:17:57] miracles oh praise god the pillar of
[1:18:00] fire
[1:18:01] is identified scientifically and by the
[1:18:03] reaction of a spice character and
[1:18:05] everything else
[1:18:07] just the same then he says as it was
[1:18:10] when it was dwelling in the body of
[1:18:12] god's only begotten son
[1:18:13] so
[1:18:14] does it dwell in the body of his adopted
[1:18:18] sons for the last day
[1:18:20] [Music]
[1:18:21] the same pill of fire that was in jesus
[1:18:23] that pill of fire going to be an adopted
[1:18:25] sons in the last day
[1:18:27] oh hallelujah
[1:18:30] tree is perfection
[1:18:33] it's also in prison now the ministry
[1:18:36] comes to perfection this is the ministry
[1:18:38] now
[1:18:39] this is the ministry now another lady
[1:18:41] ministry are you ready
[1:18:43] the ministry
[1:18:44] comes to its perfection
[1:18:47] when
[1:18:48] it reproduced christ again in natural
[1:18:53] among human beings
[1:18:55] i like that
[1:18:57] not christ in spiritual
[1:18:59] talking mysteries
[1:19:00] no natural
[1:19:05] amen
[1:19:06] you see if it going by higher revelation
[1:19:08] and who are more revelation and more
[1:19:10] revelated then then the intellectual
[1:19:13] professors and doctorates and degrees
[1:19:15] people in this message who preach this
[1:19:16] message they adopted already
[1:19:19] they don't they don't need any dynamics
[1:19:22] their head take them higher
[1:19:26] but if it has to be a repetition of
[1:19:28] christ you have to see christ's own life
[1:19:31] oozing out the man
[1:19:36] you wouldn't have to say nothing about
[1:19:37] it the devil make you prove yes
[1:19:40] every one of these virtues is in you
[1:19:43] that is not you and god now that you're
[1:19:44] the devil
[1:19:47] the less
[1:19:48] they get less
[1:19:51] he said it will speak
[1:19:54] for itself
[1:19:56] you won't have to say anything about it
[1:19:57] will speak
[1:19:59] for itself
[1:20:01] it will be good walking on two feet
[1:20:04] listen
[1:20:06] right now right now sodom
[1:20:08] is walking on two feet
[1:20:11] and if sodom could walk on two feet
[1:20:14] with a rainbow flag
[1:20:16] white we can't have good
[1:20:20] walking on two feet
[1:20:22] with the rainbow
[1:20:25] not a flag
[1:20:26] [Applause]
[1:20:28] oh glory
[1:20:31] oh give the lord a shout in the house
[1:20:37] oh man
[1:20:39] if they're so bored to step out
[1:20:42] we gonna step out
[1:20:45] be like jesus
[1:20:47] [Applause]
[1:20:56] i'm absolute
[1:20:58] he is the dynamics
[1:21:00] of the mechanics
[1:21:02] the mechanics of the church what is it
[1:21:04] apostles
[1:21:05] prophets
[1:21:07] teachers
[1:21:08] and so forth
[1:21:09] he is the dynamic that works
[1:21:12] that aha
[1:21:14] so i mean this fightful ministry will be
[1:21:16] worked
[1:21:18] by dynamics
[1:21:20] oh hallelujah it will turn from the
[1:21:22] ministry of the word
[1:21:24] to the ministry of the spirit what's the
[1:21:26] objective for the perfection
[1:21:29] of the saints
[1:21:31] oh hallelujah it's worked by a certain
[1:21:33] dynamic he is the fire that fires off
[1:21:36] the gas he's the fire in the combustion
[1:21:39] chamber he is the power of the
[1:21:41] resurrection he is god he is the fire so
[1:21:44] the holy spirit is on the guide
[1:21:46] watch always speaks of the word
[1:21:49] i've got many things to tell you you
[1:21:51] cannot understand it now but when he
[1:21:53] comes he will guide you to it
[1:21:55] here we go this is very important
[1:21:57] that's the reason the coming of the
[1:21:59] seals
[1:22:00] at the finishing of the seventh seal the
[1:22:04] mystery of god should be finished to
[1:22:06] know who god is
[1:22:07] what he is how he lives his nature his
[1:22:11] being here we go you are supposed to be
[1:22:14] all the way up there by that time
[1:22:18] watch see
[1:22:19] and that brings us into the full stature
[1:22:22] of the sons and daughters of god a
[1:22:25] church that washed in the blood of
[1:22:27] christ that's bought without money with
[1:22:28] all that price
[1:22:30] so what is he saying
[1:22:32] at the finishing of the seventh seal
[1:22:35] we're supposed to be way up
[1:22:37] in the virtues
[1:22:39] with the word
[1:22:40] word on top of word on top of word on
[1:22:42] top of word what's the secret the word
[1:22:44] is in the bride
[1:22:46] then they're going to come for the
[1:22:47] fightful ministry
[1:22:49] with the ministry of the spirit
[1:22:51] to take the bride further
[1:22:53] because you will be perfected the cap of
[1:22:55] perfection will be the spirit part
[1:22:57] because right now you are perfect under
[1:22:59] the blood
[1:23:01] you have been redeemed by the word but
[1:23:03] then you're got to get the spirit to cap
[1:23:05] that and that is what the dynamics is
[1:23:07] all about
[1:23:08] oh hallelujah do you believe that
[1:23:10] oh glory to god glory to god
[1:23:13] hallelujah
[1:23:14] so therefore at the finishing of the
[1:23:16] seventh seal we're supposed to be way up
[1:23:18] there
[1:23:19] and what is this christ have to come to
[1:23:21] finish that off
[1:23:22] christ is what coming true of eiffel
[1:23:24] ministry it will be the ministry of
[1:23:26] christ not this man ministry this
[1:23:28] brother ministry no it will be the
[1:23:30] ministry of jesus christ coming to bring
[1:23:32] on that perfection could we say amen
[1:23:34] praise the lord
[1:23:36] hallelujah
[1:23:37] hallelujah
[1:23:38] so the world is doing the work of
[1:23:40] redemption right now you've been
[1:23:41] redeemed by the word right now so christ
[1:23:43] the spirit coming to do the final part
[1:23:45] of that work
[1:23:46] the complete the redemption the
[1:23:48] finishing the seven sale the common
[1:23:50] incompleteness and joy
[1:23:52] oh hallelujah redemption and
[1:23:53] completeness and joy

[1:24:38] the whole creation
[1:24:40] is groaning for this manifestation that
[1:24:43] i just share with you of the sons of god
[1:24:46] they're not grown into our church
[1:24:47] members they have no blowing their
[1:24:49] people sitting on a church pew that
[1:24:51] can't doing anything we had hundreds of
[1:24:53] years of huge views
[1:24:55] but what going to shape the system
[1:24:57] the sons of god being unveiled
[1:25:00] from under the seventh seal
[1:25:03] all glory to god coming right out of the
[1:25:05] book of redemption
[1:25:08] there'll be one more ride
[1:25:10] there'll be one more ride tell me one
[1:25:12] more ride he said i'll ride this trail
[1:25:15] once more
[1:25:16] there'll be one more ride the white
[1:25:18] horse rider the holy ghost himself there
[1:25:21] gonna be one more ride but signs wonders
[1:25:24] and miracles may it start today
[1:25:27] oh hallelujah there's gonna be one more
[1:25:31] ride
[1:25:33] [Applause]
[1:25:37] [Music]
[1:25:44] man he's reading ephesians what we read
[1:25:47] some evangelism pastors for the
[1:25:49] perfection of god no does it read like
[1:25:50] that no for the perfection of what the
[1:25:52] saints who are the saints the sanctified
[1:25:55] ones
[1:25:56] you ain't a saint until you're
[1:25:57] sanctified
[1:25:58] [Applause]
[1:26:02] someone like 50 say amen
[1:26:04] we're gonna get to the other fifty
[1:26:05] percent
[1:26:07] you ain't a saint
[1:26:09] until you are sanctified
[1:26:12] so when we say the perfecting of the
[1:26:14] saints
[1:26:16] we're talking about the perfecting
[1:26:18] of the sanctified ones
[1:26:21] hold it right there don't don't get too
[1:26:22] nervous
[1:26:23] we come in fear
[1:26:26] coming to get you
[1:26:28] perfection of the saints
[1:26:29] for the work of the ministry then he
[1:26:31] says deep ministry of jesus christ
[1:26:34] so we know nobody's about to ministry is
[1:26:36] that the other minister's brothers
[1:26:38] ministry no we have that but we're
[1:26:40] talking about the ministry of jesus
[1:26:42] christ and there's only one of that
[1:26:46] that ministry coming in the form of a
[1:26:47] pastor form of evangelist former prophet
[1:26:50] just same ministry one ministry
[1:26:52] everybody around the world are going to
[1:26:53] call into this fight for ministry will
[1:26:54] have that same one ministry it's one
[1:26:56] ministry called the minister of jesus
[1:26:57] christ it will act like christ talk like
[1:26:59] christ live like christ do the works of
[1:27:01] christ it will be just like jesus christ
[1:27:03] how do you know about over look at byram
[1:27:06] he walked like christ he talked like
[1:27:07] crazy act like christ he raised the dead
[1:27:08] like christ he healed like christ he was
[1:27:10] just like christ they even thought he
[1:27:11] was christ
[1:27:14] you had to tell them i am not he
[1:27:17] and run for his life
[1:27:20] he was so much
[1:27:22] like christ
[1:27:23] they mistook him for christ
[1:27:30] you mean it will happen again yes
[1:27:32] yes
[1:27:34] i'm not talking about taking you for
[1:27:35] christ no you're going to be just like
[1:27:37] christ
[1:27:39] so when the devil see you say i see him
[1:27:41] before you know i see him before
[1:27:43] because christ doesn't sting him already
[1:27:46] so he don't want to get a second one
[1:27:47] like that because i feel that before boy
[1:27:49] that he's saying presence that was in
[1:27:51] the wilderness there's the presence that
[1:27:53] cast me out there's a presence when
[1:27:55] jesus random devils out the devil asked
[1:27:56] permission to go into the pigs
[1:28:00] they want to float around they want some
[1:28:02] more mischief to do
[1:28:03] somebody to get invited jump up
[1:28:06] that's all the endeavors have to find
[1:28:07] somebody for mischief they have to find
[1:28:09] somebody to use to do the impetus
[1:28:11] behavior and their stuff
[1:28:13] i'm waiting for the holy ghost looking
[1:28:14] for somebody to use somebody to use
[1:28:18] god looking for somebody i wanna hear a
[1:28:20] bigger amen than that open your mouth
[1:28:22] and say amen you're looking to use you
[1:28:25] the holy is looking to jump on you holy
[1:28:28] looking to speak through you
[1:28:30] hallelujah
[1:28:31] [Applause]
[1:28:34] hallelujah
[1:28:36] so this ministry
[1:28:38] is not for you
[1:28:39] it's not for me
[1:28:41] this ministry of jesus christ is
[1:28:42] necessary to raise the dead
[1:28:45] because the lord does all three
[1:28:47] the shout the voice and the trump
[1:28:49] so it has to be christ's ministry come
[1:28:51] back
[1:28:52] is that man reasonably dead
[1:28:55] think about it
[1:28:57] it has to be christ
[1:28:59] true and by man raising the dead
[1:29:02] oh hallelujah are you with me
[1:29:04] oh glory to god hallelujah so god wanted
[1:29:07] to come into bodies
[1:29:09] and use them for his glory amen for his
[1:29:11] honor isn't that right
[1:29:13] amen so the church
[1:29:15] come to justification certification
[1:29:17] through wesley through the bathroom
[1:29:19] where he goes
[1:29:20] all the pentecostals go right into the
[1:29:22] perfection of the son of man when
[1:29:24] husband and wife will be the self-seen
[1:29:26] person
[1:29:27] god will be so manifested into his bride
[1:29:30] his church they'll be one of the same
[1:29:32] do you see where we are at then we read
[1:29:35] this i think before build me up lord
[1:29:36] into this that christ be my head working
[1:29:38] through me and my foundation my feet
[1:29:40] that's in him let virtue knowledge
[1:29:42] temperance patience godliness brotherly
[1:29:44] kindness working me oh lord is my prayer
[1:29:46] i don't care live or die sink or drown
[1:29:48] denominational mission friend or no
[1:29:51] friend let that work in me this is for
[1:29:54] the ministry now let christ's virtue
[1:29:58] his knowledge
[1:29:59] flow out that i might be able to teach
[1:30:02] those
[1:30:04] whose virtue
[1:30:06] christ's virtue whose knowledge
[1:30:08] that we might be able to teach so it's
[1:30:11] not our teaching it has to be christ
[1:30:13] knowledge christ virtue no we don't have
[1:30:16] virtue in ourselves we could get faith
[1:30:18] which is at the bottom as revelation
[1:30:21] faith is revealed but virtue is power
[1:30:24] jesus said he came unto his own he don't
[1:30:27] receive him not but as many as receive
[1:30:29] him the damn
[1:30:31] gary
[1:30:32] power
[1:30:33] to become
[1:30:34] the sons of god so you are promised a
[1:30:37] power which is a virtue to come upon
[1:30:40] your faith
[1:30:41] that you could now begin to add that
[1:30:44] life
[1:30:45] power have to come we have none except
[1:30:48] he sent it except he promised it except
[1:30:51] he release it except he give it and you
[1:30:54] will promise it you shall receive power
[1:30:58] or give the lord a shout in the house
[1:31:08] let christ virtue his knowledge flew out
[1:31:11] that i'm able to teach those for god has
[1:31:13] set in the church apostles prophets
[1:31:15] teachers pastor and evangelist all here
[1:31:17] we go
[1:31:18] this is a deeper part all
[1:31:20] for the perfecting and
[1:31:23] bringing
[1:31:25] all these virtues into it
[1:31:27] for that perfection of the coming of the
[1:31:29] son of god so what is he saying here
[1:31:31] these virtues cannot come into you by
[1:31:34] revelation
[1:31:36] the minister can bring it into you by
[1:31:37] revelation he has to have the experience
[1:31:40] of the virtues you have to have the
[1:31:42] experience of the life itself it has to
[1:31:45] be a life
[1:31:47] speaking logos
[1:31:48] [Applause]
[1:31:50] it has to be a life
[1:31:53] speaking fire
[1:31:54] [Applause]
[1:31:56] why peter yet speak these words
[1:31:59] holy coast fell upon them
[1:32:01] what is happening seed germ from the
[1:32:03] body
[1:32:04] spirit life coming out out of the mouth
[1:32:07] of another sun because adam was supposed
[1:32:09] to speak for other sons and jesus he
[1:32:12] must be born again of the word and the
[1:32:14] spirit
[1:32:15] so we are coming back to that
[1:32:17] oh glory to god
[1:32:20] do you get it
[1:32:22] we are coming back to that
[1:32:26] when god give adam the promise to
[1:32:28] multiply replenish multiply and so on he
[1:32:30] was supposed to wait for a further
[1:32:32] revelation
[1:32:33] of how to do it of how
[1:32:38] then the devil came in then it comes
[1:32:39] down in the sex
[1:32:40] but he was supposed to wait for food and
[1:32:43] revelation
[1:32:44] so god gives something you have to wait
[1:32:46] until it unfolds
[1:32:47] devil can't bring it into petition and
[1:32:49] that we end up born in sin born of a
[1:32:51] woman born in hell
[1:32:54] so going to bring christ to bring a new
[1:32:55] boot
[1:32:57] to bring wood and spirit
[1:32:58] to bring it back to adam again so when
[1:33:01] god speak the word that's why jesus said
[1:33:03] upon receiving the holy ghost and come
[1:33:05] back to the mount again they come into
[1:33:07] the mouth of god the word of god so
[1:33:09] therefore you come now and you get the
[1:33:11] word inside your soul the devil do
[1:33:13] believe that it's a secret
[1:33:15] god put a seed inside of you your spirit
[1:33:17] might be messed up your flesh might be
[1:33:19] messed up but go put a seed inside of
[1:33:21] you and then the spirit come down the
[1:33:22] poured upon that and then it started to
[1:33:24] grow and break out there's how to
[1:33:26] influence your spirit it's hard to
[1:33:27] influence your flesh it has to influence
[1:33:29] your walk start to influence your talk
[1:33:31] and the more you die out is the more
[1:33:33] this light expands the more you god have
[1:33:35] the preeminences and the more you give
[1:33:37] up this and give up that the more you
[1:33:39] make room is the more that holy spirit
[1:33:41] expands inside of you then you become
[1:33:43] anointed with god you are in the
[1:33:45] presence of god you are living in his
[1:33:47] presence you are walking in his presence
[1:33:50] you have the joy of the lord which is
[1:33:52] your strength nobody can show you off
[1:33:54] knock your offer on your off practice
[1:33:56] pull you down you can
[1:33:59] you choose your accents you make your
[1:34:01] decisions you make the right ones

[1:37:02] i lost friends and lord's family i lost
[1:37:05] minister's friend but i never lost my
[1:37:08] prayers don't let deaton take your
[1:37:10] prayers where was though when i lay the
[1:37:13] foundation of the earth and the mornings
[1:37:15] i sang together and the sons of god
[1:37:18] shouted for joy
[1:37:20] [Applause]
[1:37:41] oh
[1:37:44] [Applause]
[1:37:57] every son
[1:37:58] that committed god
[1:38:00] must be tested and dry
[1:38:03] not some sons
[1:38:05] like what fever that one boy
[1:38:08] god doesn't do favors
[1:38:10] like how humans has favored his son and
[1:38:12] their son and god nothing that
[1:38:14] he disciplined noah
[1:38:16] disciplined moses
[1:38:18] he disciplined his sons all of them
[1:38:23] and if these jokers in this message is
[1:38:24] going to discipline them they're wrong
[1:38:33] god is pure
[1:38:35] and he is just
[1:38:37] his righteousness demands judgment
[1:38:41] but his blood speaks for grace
[1:38:46] that's why you tell them he said he said
[1:38:49] nebuchadnezzar my servant will come and
[1:38:50] do this that for 70 40 70 years you've
[1:38:53] been babylon and after something's
[1:38:55] accomplished only enough long time while
[1:38:57] your mother died all your old heads die
[1:38:59] out and when they come to repentance and
[1:39:01] what that i'll punish the king of the
[1:39:02] bible and after 70 years
[1:39:05] so god always takes somebody to take
[1:39:06] into captivity and you're buying and
[1:39:09] what nothing like that you you can't get
[1:39:10] a breakthrough because your outer your
[1:39:12] outer line
[1:39:14] your outer position
[1:39:16] as soon as grow people start to get back
[1:39:17] position line up go and just line up
[1:39:19] with them
[1:39:20] authorities have to line up with them
[1:39:22] everything's that are lined up for you
[1:39:24] as soon as you come up in line
[1:39:26] when you're live you're one you see you
[1:39:27] have to have an intent this is a problem
[1:39:29] a lot of people don't have the intent
[1:39:31] you have to have an intent to do right
[1:39:33] an intent to serve god i intend to
[1:39:36] please him yes that appreciate you know
[1:39:38] you have to have an intent
[1:39:45] if you're just respectful you have to
[1:39:46] have intent to be respectful
[1:39:48] so then you're pressing your way and
[1:39:49] you'll find this you're getting less and
[1:39:51] less
[1:39:53] and if you're ready word go we had to
[1:39:54] cast that spirit out
[1:39:56] because i spirit upon your life
[1:39:58] because god wants respects demand
[1:40:00] respects you'll be judged for being
[1:40:01] disrespectful whether it's your husband
[1:40:02] to the pastor to deakin anybody like
[1:40:04] that
[1:40:05] god demands your respect he wants
[1:40:06] respects
[1:40:08] oh hallelujah
[1:40:10] isn't that right
[1:40:12] praise the name of the lord so therefore
[1:40:16] the virtues
[1:40:17] praise god cannot come in just by talk
[1:40:20] talk talk like one time somebody said
[1:40:22] take a breath in
[1:40:23] oh income fate
[1:40:26] virtue
[1:40:28] take seven deep breaths
[1:40:30] you get from faith virtue knowledge
[1:40:32] good lord
[1:40:34] i wish it was that easy
[1:40:36] hallelujah
[1:40:38] barbara says somebody asked him how
[1:40:39] could you go to this church in that
[1:40:40] church in that church he said kindness
[1:40:42] knowledge know what to believe know it's
[1:40:44] in somebody
[1:40:45] listen if something in somebody's heart
[1:40:46] are you guys in that doubt without
[1:40:47] jackhammer
[1:40:50] so you spell it always always rebuke and
[1:40:52] rebuke it it's in their heart
[1:40:54] if it's in the head other small talk
[1:40:56] would fight off in them but when is it a
[1:40:58] heart in trouble
[1:41:00] but my mom said one of the hardest
[1:41:02] people to convict your witness because
[1:41:04] they legislate done with the knowledge
[1:41:06] and the intellect but you know where
[1:41:07] they should come up supernatural
[1:41:09] that is just stop the knowledge
[1:41:11] [Applause]
[1:41:13] so anytime you want to deal with them
[1:41:15] you have to have something supernatural
[1:41:17] if his argument in scripture they're
[1:41:18] going down with your greek woman they're
[1:41:20] going down they're going down they're
[1:41:21] going you lost that back
[1:41:24] but you see when you see supernatural
[1:41:25] come
[1:41:27] battle over
[1:41:30] they get shut up
[1:41:32] that is what god has to begin to do
[1:41:34] shut them all to the critics
[1:41:36] by bringing out sons
[1:41:38] manifested sons are you with me
[1:41:42] praise god the church is weak the church
[1:41:45] today we have broke up with
[1:41:46] organizational strife separation of
[1:41:48] brotherhood methodist baptist
[1:41:49] presbyterian oneness trainers finest all
[1:41:51] kind of stuff watch that's the way it's
[1:41:54] supposed to be
[1:41:57] do you hear he brought that he said he
[1:41:59] broke a broker broke about he said but
[1:42:00] either way it's supposed to be break up
[1:42:02] breaker breaker break up but watch what
[1:42:04] we say next that's where it's supposed
[1:42:06] to be
[1:42:07] then then there will come a message
[1:42:10] [Music]
[1:42:13] hallelujah we know that that same pillar
[1:42:16] of fire
[1:42:17] that led israel
[1:42:19] we know that that same ministry that
[1:42:21] accompanied jesus christ by that pillar
[1:42:25] of fire had him anointed as a company to
[1:42:28] change today we need
[1:42:30] the ministry of jesus christ to fit the
[1:42:33] headstone commentator
[1:42:35] that brought the church into a place
[1:42:36] where the ministry exactly like what
[1:42:38] jesus had when he left
[1:42:40] not we wanted we need it
[1:42:43] so it has to come to that ministry of
[1:42:45] jesus christ
[1:42:46] number six have to run out
[1:42:48] oh praise god hallelujah
[1:42:51] we take a little more
[1:42:53] he said now
[1:42:54] talking about those those there wasn't
[1:42:56] spirit filled
[1:42:58] talking about those pharisees people and
[1:43:00] salvation people there's something
[1:43:02] inside with jesus but they were loyal
[1:43:04] and held to the modern creed of their
[1:43:06] leaders now he had moses teaching about
[1:43:08] messiah coming and all those prophecies
[1:43:10] about messiah coming but then was
[1:43:12] preaching the old pots and pans gospel
[1:43:14] and that loyal following everybody loved
[1:43:15] the pastor or the priest or the kaifas
[1:43:17] and it was hat and he had anything like
[1:43:19] that right he looking good he went good
[1:43:21] and so on like that caiphus is the man
[1:43:24] watch
[1:43:25] hear this part but his ministry
[1:43:28] i love this part who are showing up
[1:43:29] their doctrine
[1:43:32] they had their doctrine but jesus
[1:43:34] ministry began to expose their doctrine
[1:43:36] that's what the ministry of christ will
[1:43:37] do
[1:43:38] it's a manifestation of christ's own
[1:43:40] life
[1:43:41] now they had their creeds they were
[1:43:42] great churches great people great men
[1:43:44] holy men good men gentlemen fine men all
[1:43:47] men men of honor educated smart
[1:43:49] religious is that right and we all know
[1:43:52] that just as good as you can find
[1:43:53] anywhere but when jesus come on his
[1:43:56] ministry
[1:43:58] showed up their doctrine because god was
[1:44:00] proven
[1:44:02] by the ministry of jesus christ that he
[1:44:04] was with him
[1:44:06] and peter used these words he said jesus
[1:44:08] of nazareth a man approved of god among
[1:44:11] you
[1:44:13] so what you want to see is man approved
[1:44:17] of god
[1:44:18] oh give the lord a shout in the house
[1:44:24] hallelujah
[1:44:26] no doubts
[1:44:28] no questions no wonderings it is
[1:44:31] vindicated by god himself jesus of
[1:44:34] nazareth
[1:44:35] a man approved of by god
[1:44:38] this is all right to know the mechanics
[1:44:39] but one of them has the dynamics he said
[1:44:41] oh you say other cadillac
[1:44:43] have tanks and crankshaft and steering
[1:44:44] wheel it's pretty but it it it casts
[1:44:48] that
[1:44:50] it's not working you have it right in
[1:44:52] the house look at my rims look look at
[1:44:53] these seats it's leather splash look at
[1:44:56] the dashboard you say let me go for a
[1:44:57] spin
[1:44:59] it can't start you
[1:45:01] so know
[1:45:01] do you have there
[1:45:02] better borrow a bicycle
[1:45:06] you understand what i'm saying so if a
[1:45:08] man explained the only word any
[1:45:10] mysteries and it's this hidden mystery
[1:45:12] deep that that yeah it looking nice but
[1:45:14] could it start
[1:45:16] could it bring on a revival
[1:45:18] could it bring on a super church a super
[1:45:20] race
[1:45:20] is a spirit flowing freely
[1:45:23] could it start
[1:45:24] could that engine tumble
[1:45:32] the last indian tumblers
[1:45:39] hallelujah
[1:45:41] men doing nothing moving
[1:45:43] hallelujah because the battery too weak
[1:45:46] it take it take is this a northern light
[1:45:48] could work on this bridge you gotta get
[1:45:50] it right back to you get this engine
[1:45:51] moving
[1:45:52] go and you turn the key you wanna hear a
[1:45:54] rumble you don't want to know the plugs
[1:45:56] coming into the wire to
[1:46:00] all i want to do is to drive
[1:46:03] oh give the lord some praises all you
[1:46:05] want to do is to try
[1:46:11] [Applause]
[1:46:13] all of them had the right mechanics but
[1:46:15] one of them has the dynamics you see you
[1:46:17] might know the mechanics but it takes
[1:46:18] dynamics to start off the mechanics to
[1:46:21] make it work
[1:46:23] and no matter how much geology with all
[1:46:25] dynamics you see in other words you've
[1:46:27] got to have a spark to the gasoline and
[1:46:29] no matter how well we are taught how
[1:46:31] well we believe how much of the bible
[1:46:33] that we say is true we believe it all
[1:46:35] it's got to be the dynamics to get there
[1:46:38] the spark to set the world of fire
[1:46:41] to start it rolling it's got to have
[1:46:44] that if you don't he said the church sit
[1:46:47] still
[1:46:48] the car sits still
[1:46:51] you sit still no matter how much you say
[1:46:54] i sympathize i believe every word of it
[1:46:55] you've got to have something to spark it
[1:46:57] off hallelujah it's got to take the
[1:46:59] dynamics with the mechanics nothing
[1:47:01] wrong with the mechanics but lacking
[1:47:03] dynamics and i think that's the matter
[1:47:05] with the church today is lacking the
[1:47:07] dynamic power of god to press the word
[1:47:09] terrorist to make it live
[1:47:12] not to explain it more enough for you to
[1:47:14] run with more notes on a notepad that
[1:47:16] you cannot do it
[1:47:19] but to make it live
[1:47:21] oh hallelujah martin luther had
[1:47:24] mechanics in the enemies of his day john
[1:47:26] wesley had them pentecostal had them
[1:47:28] what about our day
[1:47:29] this is another time the church shall be
[1:47:32] fully grown now ready to meet christ
[1:47:34] with the manifestation of every blessing
[1:47:36] that he promised in the bible
[1:47:38] hallelujah operating in that one great
[1:47:41] body that he promised he would meet the
[1:47:43] people and be worshipped
[1:47:45] so the more we get closer to god is the
[1:47:46] more worship supposed to be in the
[1:47:47] church
[1:47:48] the more praises not less praise there's
[1:47:50] more praises more worship
[1:47:52] hallelujah
[1:47:54] the more we come to the coming lord is
[1:47:56] the more worship he said then we are
[1:47:57] worshiping the living christ him moving
[1:48:00] in and out among us that's the thunder's
[1:48:02] being unfolded oh hallelujah praise god
[1:48:06] hallelujah
[1:48:08] could i have shouted again in the house
[1:48:11] christ ministry
[1:48:13] which is ephesians 4 ministry will bring
[1:48:16] the bride to perfection oh hallelujah
[1:48:19] by that seven spirits of god
[1:48:22] to come upon the word the pyramid
[1:48:23] already seated in you in wood form
[1:48:26] you're already packing the prayer what
[1:48:27] do you think instead of you is the
[1:48:28] pyramid inside of you
[1:48:30] is the bible inside of you there's a
[1:48:32] seed inside of you it's a word inside of
[1:48:34] you you only wait for dynamics satan
[1:48:36] better be careful you don't know what
[1:48:38] you're messing with you don't know what
[1:48:40] the fooling went oh how when god pulled
[1:48:42] the veil of this bride he said she will
[1:48:44] be a super church she will be a super
[1:48:46] race as she nears the headstone northern
[1:48:49] life could work in her nobody can make
[1:48:51] her do otherwise
[1:48:53] it will be christ himself by and through
[1:48:56] the bride fulfilling his work because he
[1:48:58] didn't finish his work while he was on
[1:49:00] earth no bye and through the bride
[1:49:03] oh hallelujah praise god
[1:49:06] glory
[1:49:07] glory
[1:49:08] hallelujah
[1:49:10] oh hallelujah
[1:49:12] but abandoned what later in brother
[1:49:13] reginald lettering he said if the
[1:49:15] lattering had been here the power of god
[1:49:17] would have struck that thing and swept
[1:49:19] across the world he said the latter is
[1:49:21] fixing to come so who claimed that
[1:49:23] dynamics what dynamics what position he
[1:49:25] plays they have don't have mult only
[1:49:27] talk the lateral is fixing to come
[1:49:29] trump says the devil is coming on his
[1:49:31] dynamics
[1:49:33] through the united nations to enforce
[1:49:35] laws
[1:49:37] right now they take this whole thing
[1:49:38] about our gays and whatnot to the united
[1:49:40] nations and they want to enforce laws
[1:49:42] concerning transgender rights
[1:49:45] to the rest of the world
[1:49:48] the devil set up that a long time ago
[1:49:50] only to come to enforce laws so it would
[1:49:52] be legal it would be illegal not to
[1:49:54] marry people like that man a man or
[1:49:56] woman a woman
[1:49:58] so the christians find himself back
[1:50:00] against a wall in america and it would
[1:50:01] be across the world who said all of that
[1:50:04] and prophesied that but the brahmana
[1:50:05] prophesied that he said the people that
[1:50:07] follow the pillar fire will have a rough
[1:50:08] time
[1:50:09] but they'll be ready for the rapture so
[1:50:11] if you think we are playing games with
[1:50:13] any human
[1:50:15] we are not
[1:50:17] because there are bigger battles yet
[1:50:18] ahead
[1:50:20] oh hallelujah to minister to people all
[1:50:22] glory to god hallelujah
[1:50:25] oh my my my mind
[1:50:27] so therefore god have to release the
[1:50:29] ministry of the spirit to bring the
[1:50:31] people into that perfection oh blessed
[1:50:34] be the name of the lord buddha branham a
[1:50:36] woman engaged to a fine clean man and
[1:50:38] they come together and she is found
[1:50:40] pregnant by someone else then her own
[1:50:42] seed is which is betrothed her own
[1:50:44] body is betrothed her engaged husband is
[1:50:46] found full of seed of another man what
[1:50:48] it is grace that's what adam found that
[1:50:51] is what christ found they couldn't wait
[1:50:54] that's the matter with the people today
[1:50:57] here we go they can't wait for the real
[1:51:01] holy spirit to take the church in
[1:51:03] position
[1:51:07] they've got to manufacture something
[1:51:09] like speaking in tongues to get more
[1:51:11] members in the church all kind of tummy
[1:51:12] rut instead of waiting upon the lord for
[1:51:16] the real manifestation of resurrection
[1:51:18] of christ making himself known among the
[1:51:22] people they have to have no manufacture
[1:51:24] of that but ram stand up there and say
[1:51:26] you know what i'm waiting on i'm waiting
[1:51:28] on the angel of the lord and he will be
[1:51:30] talking talking all of a sudden he said
[1:51:32] he is here that is no makeup stuff
[1:51:36] it is real
[1:51:37] then because he is here he says i take
[1:51:39] every spirit under my control for the
[1:51:42] glory of god because he know he has
[1:51:44] backups
[1:51:50] he know now the operation change
[1:51:53] the devil in subjection no spirit move
[1:51:55] till he says so amen
[1:51:59] because the angels on the platform right
[1:52:01] now and he is doing this now he's doing
[1:52:03] this he's going here you so and so you
[1:52:04] spit so and so i noticed sometimes he
[1:52:06] said somebody would die but he said
[1:52:08] everybody would die but he stand up
[1:52:11] somebody with hype everybody stand up
[1:52:13] with the same condition everybody stand
[1:52:15] up and deal with it
[1:52:16] then one time he's dealing with some
[1:52:18] spirit and i say he's a spirit trying to
[1:52:20] get an expert to ask for help
[1:52:22] because they don't want to leave
[1:52:24] so the spirits and them looking for
[1:52:25] backup too
[1:52:26] then when you come here and say worship
[1:52:28] and praise the devil have no room to
[1:52:29] move
[1:52:33] you understand those devils want you
[1:52:35] bong
[1:52:36] they want you sick
[1:52:37] don't ever believe sicknesses of god and
[1:52:39] god that god gave me this because you
[1:52:41] did this and he was wrong and he
[1:52:43] deserved this don't don't let never fool
[1:52:45] you with that you know
[1:52:48] healing is the children's brethren
[1:52:50] [Applause]
[1:52:56] i don't care if you're sick for 40 years
[1:52:59] are they kept in a heritable heritage a
[1:53:01] disease they have nothing with god
[1:53:04] god does heal cancer tumor leukemia all
[1:53:06] kind of thing
[1:53:08] god is a healer
[1:53:09] he is a healer
[1:53:11] god is a healer like he saved you he's a
[1:53:13] savior he's a healer too
[1:53:15] in case he didn't know no you know
[1:53:19] people are so bastard now they don't
[1:53:20] even believe god for healing no evil for
[1:53:22] miracles god is a miracle worker too
[1:53:25] [Applause]
[1:53:28] my god
[1:53:31] he's a miracle working god how many you
[1:53:33] can say amen
[1:53:34] [Applause]
[1:53:39] how many to do with a miracle this
[1:53:40] morning
[1:53:42] oh we are believers here this morning i
[1:53:44] can do it one
[1:53:57] so we become tabernacles of the holy
[1:53:59] spirit which is christ that's the real
[1:54:02] seed now then
[1:54:04] if the real holy spirit gets into the
[1:54:07] real seed of the word it just won't take
[1:54:09] part of it because the devil uses that
[1:54:11] all right so the devil used part word
[1:54:13] the devil is in this message preaching
[1:54:15] part of the message
[1:54:17] but the bride will take all of the word
[1:54:19] not part of the word every mystery every
[1:54:22] word the bible will take what the
[1:54:24] prophet said not word what somebody
[1:54:26] interpret what the prophet said
[1:54:28] the bride the prophet will be speaking
[1:54:30] the same thing
[1:54:31] hallelujah the bride the spirit and the
[1:54:33] prophet will be saying the same thing
[1:54:36] oh hallelujah
[1:54:38] okay wow
[1:54:41] this is the part i want to get down into
[1:54:43] amen
[1:54:46] question and answer on the holy ghost
[1:54:48] the holy spirit you are believing unto
[1:54:51] eternal life
[1:54:53] but when the holy spirit comes
[1:54:55] it is eternal life
[1:54:58] this is
[1:54:59] you are begotten of the spirit at
[1:55:01] sanctification
[1:55:03] but never born of the spirit
[1:55:06] until the holy ghost comes in amen
[1:55:09] that's correct
[1:55:10] now he went in the natural type to
[1:55:12] explain what he's saying here
[1:55:14] a baby
[1:55:15] watch
[1:55:16] but never born is going right a baby got
[1:55:19] life in the womb of the mother
[1:55:22] but when it breathes its little muscles
[1:55:24] are quivering it's a life but it's a
[1:55:27] different life when it breathes the
[1:55:29] breath of life into its nostrils
[1:55:33] so when the baby is in the mother's womb
[1:55:35] it's a life maybe it's kicking it's
[1:55:36] quivering it's moving and so on it's not
[1:55:39] the same life as when it comes on the
[1:55:40] outside
[1:55:41] when it comes to the outside it's born
[1:55:47] when it's on the inside it's begun
[1:55:51] when they come on the outside it is born
[1:55:54] when it's on the inside it's begotten
[1:55:57] it's adding foot and legs and eyes and
[1:56:00] so on word on top of word on top of word
[1:56:02] that's begotten
[1:56:03] all right
[1:56:04] let's go further
[1:56:06] my dear methodist brother
[1:56:08] pregnant holiness and nazarene the
[1:56:10] baptism of the holy ghost is different
[1:56:13] from sanctification
[1:56:14] sanification is a cleansing which is
[1:56:17] preparation of life but when the holy
[1:56:19] ghost comes it is life
[1:56:22] preparation is cleansing
[1:56:24] the vessel clearing the vessel the holy
[1:56:26] ghost is filling the vessel
[1:56:28] sanification means clean and set aside
[1:56:31] and the holy spirit puts it in service
[1:56:34] so you are the vessel that god has
[1:56:36] cleaned up
[1:56:38] now we find out
[1:56:40] that the holy ghost is god himself in
[1:56:42] you
[1:56:43] god above you pill of fire with moses
[1:56:44] god with you and jesus christ now god is
[1:56:46] in you in the holy ghost not three gods
[1:56:48] but god working in three offices god
[1:56:50] condescending when god came down and
[1:56:53] dwelt in that sanctified body a virgin
[1:56:55] born of a woman that was god himself you
[1:56:57] know what god did he did nothing he just
[1:57:00] placed his tent among ours god dwelt in
[1:57:02] a tent called jesus christ and he
[1:57:05] pitched his tent with us and that is how
[1:57:07] god tent was dwell with us
[1:57:09] you see
[1:57:11] when you use the expression
[1:57:13] that if we do not believe the word is
[1:57:15] the question answers
[1:57:16] when you use the expression that if we
[1:57:18] do not believe the word we will be
[1:57:20] eternally seven christ do you mean the
[1:57:23] foolish virgin will leave eternally but
[1:57:25] they will be separated from the new
[1:57:26] jerusalem where christ will dwell with
[1:57:28] the bride
[1:57:29] here are those who do not have the holy
[1:57:31] spirit born again as the scripture
[1:57:33] speaks of being born again if the
[1:57:35] natural birth here we go requires water
[1:57:37] blood and spirit does not the spiritual
[1:57:40] birth requires all these three stages of
[1:57:42] grace before the person is truly born
[1:57:44] again you say absolutely i just
[1:57:47] explained that this morning
[1:57:48] you have got to have all stages he's
[1:57:52] going back over again you are begotten
[1:57:55] of the spirit like a baby begotten in
[1:57:57] the womb of the mother but not born
[1:58:00] until they receive the holy ghost
[1:58:03] that's right you are born then you are
[1:58:06] not convicted you are in the process of
[1:58:08] being converted until that time
[1:58:10] now this is the part
[1:58:12] that's the reason
[1:58:14] that all these great mysteries
[1:58:17] could not be given to luther
[1:58:19] could not be given to wesley
[1:58:22] could not be given to the age just
[1:58:23] passed by the pentecostal age why
[1:58:26] it wasn't time
[1:58:27] they were begotten
[1:58:33] so what he is saying
[1:58:34] the pentecostal birth
[1:58:37] god pushed that as begotten when malachi
[1:58:40] 4 come
[1:58:42] because he brought the person of jesus
[1:58:44] christ when that which is perfect has
[1:58:46] come
[1:58:47] then that which is part is
[1:58:49] done away with
[1:58:51] so watch you cannot teach no baby in the
[1:58:53] womb
[1:58:54] so the pentecostal in the womb begotten
[1:58:56] couldn't get mysteries
[1:58:58] so the prophet brought the bullet of the
[1:59:01] oh hallelujah
[1:59:04] hallelujah
[1:59:05] the prophet brought the word so you
[1:59:07] could comfort now and get the mysteries
[1:59:08] preached to you
[1:59:09] [Applause]
[1:59:14] so you are begotten of the blood cell of
[1:59:16] the word of god
[1:59:17] isn't that right
[1:59:19] hallelujah then you are sanctified
[1:59:21] that's a different life
[1:59:23] is not right praise god so the blood is
[1:59:27] what comes by the word to reveal your
[1:59:28] name so that's why the seven thunders is
[1:59:31] blood to sanctify you you are not
[1:59:33] sanctified you are not in the message
[1:59:35] until you're really sanctified
[1:59:38] you can't even come to perfection if
[1:59:39] you're not sanctified
[1:59:41] because the perfecting of the saints is
[1:59:42] the sanctified ones so it means that you
[1:59:45] have to come to that spot to truly live
[1:59:47] a sanctified life unto god a separated
[1:59:50] life unto god and your signification is
[1:59:52] proof you receive and believe the blood
[1:59:58] oh give the lord a shout in the house
[2:00:01] i want you to get to this part so bad
[2:00:03] oh hallelujah
[2:00:05] so your signification is proof
[2:00:08] that you received the blood message
[2:00:15] oh
[2:00:16] hallelujah
[2:00:17] hallelujah he sent you hot i will give
[2:00:19] you a new spirit i will give you then
[2:00:21] i'll put my spirit in your spirit
[2:00:23] therefore the blood supposed to give you
[2:00:24] a change
[2:00:25] aiming towards others towards people a
[2:00:27] change in your life and you're still
[2:00:30] looking for the his spirit to come
[2:00:32] within your new spirit because your old
[2:00:34] spirit's so terrible hallelujah you're
[2:00:36] so troublesome you're so misbehaving and
[2:00:38] bad attitude that's not christian
[2:00:41] whether they say even another still
[2:00:42] preaching that
[2:00:43] whether you like it or not i still put
[2:00:45] an adult i am free free free
[2:00:48] oh hallelujah hallelujah oh give the
[2:00:51] lord but there are some saints in the
[2:00:52] house
[2:00:55] [Applause]
[2:00:58] oh there's going to be a perfection of
[2:00:59] the saints
[2:01:04] so that 7 thunder baby is in you right
[2:01:06] now
[2:01:07] oh hallelujah but charity is the life on
[2:01:10] the outside that's not that seventh on
[2:01:12] the baby that could you anoint you with
[2:01:14] charity the spirit is here to anoint
[2:01:17] that baby inside of you
[2:01:19] you're gonna be anointed of god
[2:01:21] hallelujah
[2:01:22] oh glory to god
[2:01:24] oh my god my god
[2:01:27] let me see if we could wrap up here
[2:01:28] hallelujah though the whole creation is
[2:01:30] waiting and groaning for the sons of god
[2:01:32] and arise in the last days with the
[2:01:34] power of the holy ghost at the end of
[2:01:36] the age
[2:01:37] not rise with books and tapes but with
[2:01:40] the power of the holy ghost
[2:01:42] amen
[2:01:43] to reveal the secret things to bring it
[2:01:46] up
[2:01:46] but abraham said no the coming of the
[2:01:48] lord jesus oh close at hand until the
[2:01:50] spirit from way down here sound vacation
