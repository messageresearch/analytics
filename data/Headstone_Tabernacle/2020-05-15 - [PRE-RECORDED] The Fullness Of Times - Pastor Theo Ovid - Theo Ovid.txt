to look at first Corinthians chapter 10 100 1 1 to 11 Ephesians chapter 1 when the word baton Bush treat 210 Thank You visitors greetings in Jesus name - you're welcome Wheaton - all doors connected to us on the Internet welcome you to Sunday morning worship fellowship unto God Daniel chapter 12 we have us one two four and at that time shall Michael stand up the Great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt but didn't be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever but Thou O Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro knowledge shall be increased we learn from 1st Corinthians chapter 10 when I read from verse 1 moreover brethren I would not that ye should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea did all eat the same spiritual meat that they all drink the same spiritual drink for the drunk of that spiritual rock that followed him that rock was Christ but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted neither be idolaters as were some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand neither let us tempt Christ some of them also tempted and were destroyed of the Serpent's neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer now all these things happen unto them for example and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world become final scripture Ephesians chapter three one we want to read from verse 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ what blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world I wish it be wholly without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace where any admittance accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace wherein he had a bonded towards us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him may God bless his word you may be seated you love him this morning it's always good to come into the house of God it's always good to come and hear the word of God amen blessed be the name of the Lord so this is our adventure week Latino series on Thursday looking forward for a great time beginning Friday 10 o'clock and subtle safai the evening ham for the treaty's 10 and for looking for a great time in the Lord a great transformation time we are promised greetings and we hope to be under great expectation what's the under great expectation our title this morning the title is the fullness of times I said I had the fullness of times arrival inspiration waitin for the manifestation of the sons of God that's the inspiration waitin for the manifestation of the sons of God on this Scripture this inspiration is on Romans 8:19 it says for the illness expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the money of the sons of God annalee amplified it says for the even the whole creation all nature waits expectantly and longs endlessly for god's sons to be made known it's waiting for the revealing or the disclosing of the essential that's not function that is sonship so the creation itself is waiting for the revealing or the unfolding of the essentia or this is tremendous just imagine the whole creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God when God will pull the veil off of his sons now these are sons of God not humans at best natural people sons of God and sons of God express God Myron said he came on his own his own received him not but as many as received him to them he gave power to become the sons of God not Baptists not Methodists not Pentecostal not you over witness not Catholic power to become not a church member power to become the sons of God sons I've got talk a certain way they act a certain way they dress a certain way they live a certain way sons of God they are different they are sons of God they're not sons of men natural their sons of God they have got gene inside of them they have God's Gilliam inside of them hallelujah the other sons of God that God pick up from the earth hallelujah right in the face of the devil God chose you right and Satan face he pick you up right in your condition he chose you because we phone and he called who he called sons of God he called them for our purpose he called you unto something he just Ezra's call you call you on their purpose don't ever let the devil take that out of your mind in that cause they exist you're not called your being and your being and you're going true that's not for your calls our purpose that purpose must be accomplished hallelujah hallelujah your life is gonna miss half your life is gonna stick what you're been through is not by chance because we know if the devil don't know we know something that the devil don't know that the people don't know we know something if your family know we know something he know Romans 8:28 that all things work together for good that we know that if nobody else knows that we know that this happened that happened so what wins the big deal with the big thing God is in charge he brought you all to miry clay he set your feet on a rock the state he kept you all these years you're gonna be dead a long time ago you could be a up you could be backs immunity in hell a long time alone but the blood of Jesus but the blood of Jesus is warning [Applause] I love gordon cooney bow your love for God will take you had a kneebar had an e-cigarette higher and parties and dance iron set iron and fuller and woman hand and fill it in the love of God will take you above all like that is the love of God he's talking about you you you can't pay for that what they gonna pay for the love of God what you're gonna pay for the blood of Jesus God by His grace religious son he came in the fullness of time born upon a woman born under the law to redeem that who were under the law he came just like you to feel for you to understand what you go and true to put on your shoes wear your clothes the reach them to pick you up you can't serve them with all your heart mind and life and soul they're always rather Lord I caught it one God you love them with all your heart mind and soul and you got walk away from the things of the world [Applause] you have a higher calling this person giving you a fight and this family I fight enough okay I fight what nonsense is that buh-bye did that talk about the fight is all inside of you or inside your mind foolish inside your mind what you cannot fight God again or or dilution listen listen we

have been put on this earth to prove we come from God we're going back to God we come from the eighth day we come from eternity we come from original gene talk that was in the back part of God's mind which never could take that out never to raise that out which job which losing jobs losing your roof losing your car whatever doesn't matter what can separate me from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus [Applause] what a songwriter have a song it wasn't easy but it was witted and you wasn't easy it wasn't easy for Christ but it was really with it Oh hallelujah for even who creation waits expectantly and longs endlessly for God's sons to be made known God's sons to be made known the equation is grewal groaning for that and God's sons couldn't be made known until we come down to the fullness of time that's when the time promised for God's sons to be manifested so you have seven church ages but coming down long to the fullness of time what promise to release a message that would bring the sons of God into position that he could adopt them and place them on the hood to give them a devil one last death blow smoke in the devil face before we leave here gonna lose in this battle alone this back already won you know we're going to be motion God is not going to lose this battle alone it's almost 6,000 years you waitin for this showdown it's gonna be a showdown I back to Eden

the heavyweight championship this is good versus evil light versus darkness sons of God hallelu the Bride of Christ versus praise go whatever the devil have to offer Oh hallelujah and Daniel said the people that know their God shall be strong and do great exploit he couldn't know God in all the ages in that kind of a way because admission wasn't fully revealed he was only unfallen part of himself but in this last day the full thing is coming to view the full thing is unfolded now we know who he is that we know his nature now we know is being what he wants accomplished or if the Lord praises people you don't need somebody spoon feeding you all along you don't need that pre-installed you're gonna be strong this is harvest time praise God Feast of Tabernacles geez of ingathering this is a harvest of what we live at four but the press wall says all these years 74 75 and you're looking towards God the hardness of the seeds but you're sure that your family will be delivered back and no

yes in a message and when the season change when the season turned and it was manifestation time they couldn't deal with it they wanted to step down their golden coach because the all-new Messiah is from it the all-new servants on the revivalist brothers they all know about price revival they all know what the prophets said that there we are manifestations the seven thunders the people fly them everywhere see the seven thunders are being manifested not talked not taught but manifested or glory no Gordon thought that because he said the class addition is a time and season where everything on

look complicate beggar or friend or friend I'm doing what I never worked against a brother we're doing that ought is faithful to knowledge temperance patience doing this on the top brotherly kindness that's the spirit of forgiveness that's the fullness the seven steps that's as far as you can go because the Spirit has gone himself to come down upon you hallelujah the Spirit of God descending like a dove you gotta prove it that God does but you could get up on the seventh step and that seven surface forgiveness that's heaven suffers when you could drop your odds and a whole lot glutton excuses and blame somebody and somebody and somebody you're still aiming don't down somewhere decided here you have to get out to that definitely real spirit of forgiveness look at Jesus he said Father forgive them they know not what they do and they were like Russia fine Christian for him when he was higher than that he had cursed them here swear against them he stood aside forgive them they don't you know what they're doing they don't know what they kill him they don't know what they unfolding inside idea say time to even know if they don't only understood he was going to leave Jesus alone but when he died shadows release the spirit no we are here and see that yeah hold us back nothing nothing nothing put a stop the sons of God from coming forth in this hour this is what the whole reason has grown and fall not have a nice church and nice just members and so on and shoot anti that's not good and for Oh hallelujah whoever to rip the veil of who hears you're gonna see who he is and I

boundaries you can pass so don't worry God know what to find everybody has a good one you know way to live no and I'm an hour cometh how come so he's gonna have a success of Elijah when he did God call this man this he wasn't a Nocera seminary when he called him he was plowing a field but the yoke of oxen the service taking care of his mother and father God called him to be the successor of Elijah or Elijah perhaps many up at the school thought they were sure to do going to be his successor they were going to wear his robe as soon as he was finished but God does the callin God does the chosen God does the electing and God does the settin in order [Music] do you love him God has set in the church some apostles some prophets some teachers some evangelists and pastors God does that himself we cannot make one hair black or white neither can be added wanting to our structure by taking thought God in His infinite grace and by his election and foreknowledge sets these things in order and every real work just right I like that I would be a discouragement this morning is I didn't believe in the election and calling of God if I thought that this world was left to the outcome of it by the power of man and by the wisdom of man and by United Nations who never mentioned God's name I'd be discouraged person but I'm not looking to that for the outcome I looked at the pages of this old book here where God wrote it out and everything will come just exactly the way he said it so you're not looking for man for your own come you don't look ever uncle and Aunty and Pantheon this

and the promise of the entire Holy Ghost has finished in the church that is what make looks something today the son of man in a sauna man so Jesus Christ was dealing a prophet which is the Holy Ghost itself and he spoke word prophetic words spirit spoken words to go and anoint a bride so when you ensure that you could be wherever the would ever find you that's why you're in church today something inside of you it's what the would connect might give the Lord a shout in the house because it's spirit given word hallelujah that means if that word gone out it means it or not to catch you to put you in - will you in because the word has you have to become the sons of God that's what power is given for that was the word was given for not to become a church member but for you to be a reproduction of God so church supposed to be an Avenue in which you get connect back to your God they come back and cellphone act activated she supposedly pleasewe again the activation then when you could call him for yourself not to some priests not to some bishop but you have your own line back to your father I want say me somebody [Applause] but this part is incredible after the doors of the Gentiles is closed God will anoint a church what does that mean the doors of the Gentiles is closed by the call the Jews the olive tree olive branch and God cut them off to put this wild olive branch in called the Gentiles and the bad let's talk about the times of the Gentiles until the fullness of the Gentiles come in so therefore the Gentiles have a specific train not a specific time but call it the fullness of the Gentiles until the time the Gentiles coming in so it means that when that time come in not one more name person would be saved so don't wait for the door to shut because Noah 120 years where people had opportunity to receive it to see the message and then when go outside at Eleanor listen time up your fullness of time has come so started getting hemas in two by two people see that untoward without work we have enough found inside earlier that they can funnel or but afterwards God shut the door seven days into acts at preaching to doomed people the acts at recent the people who

preaching to no fun for now yes for seven days until the rains are the fall then people say no no I said no but the only problem is no I didn't shut the door got it and what God door what shut no man

promised word to drive to get into the church and drag them to cover yonder and then to the rapture so he prophesied that the Spirit will come to drive us to Calvary where we have a crucifixion with Christ isn't that right praise God now you say wait a minute know what the prophets rebuked those woman and MD is the quantum woman he turns no wait a minute you write in the scriptures known a woman that lives in worldly pleasure can't be the pleasures of God so the woman that lives in worldly pleasure is dead while she's living and that's what the prophet said sin poor the woman that lives in this worldly condition is dead while she's living and if she rejects mercy she can cross a separation line where there is no place for no more and then where is she act with a painted eyes a pot here she crossed the line with nowhere to come back he has got to be listen there's got to be a ministry preached to her but remember it's all over it is done it's just a horn there will be a ministry that will show great signs of wonders joy I said so there will be no time for redemption it's all over the lamb done took his book his redeemed is over as Jesus first preached I was rejected and then went

the same nor preached exactly when zinyak and when he went into the ark there were seven days nothing happened and the testimony preached to the tomb not by speaking in tongues not by dancing in the spirit not by joining in church not at the foot of the Spirit watch but it's the word listen dare it is if the only unlooked he was Messiah he was the Living Word made manifest you said the church you go right on just the same but remember all this time Knorr and the Ark the bride in copy and it know the bride is sealed in with Christ the last member has been redeemed the sixth seal produces itself I mean know that he good quick windows like judgment isn't that right the seventh seal brings up the earth tree is perfection the ministry comes to perfection when it's reproduce Christ again in natural among human beings he did not say the milchig on the perfection when the militia capisce mysteries he said when Christ is repet we've got to see Christ who's in on all flesh we got to see this

come on if it hit you once it can hit you again come on seeing somebody if I have struck you before to strike you again [Music] it takes everyday life to have this kind of life not a Sunday like everyday like to personally as a Christian God is calling his children aside by manifestation they don't have to say one word about it no people just the money necessary so kind so Christ like God Colin is chilling aside my manifestation they don't have to say one word about it you see something happen positionally place sons of God God getting into him to order exactly with the same thing and he just has as much authority his word is just as good as an archangel even better the son was abducted put on a high place set out the changes ropes changes colors the father a ceremony this is my son of henceforth his governor his ruler he's over all my heritage all I have belongs to him oh praise Allah that's the reason the coming of the seals at the finishing of the seventh seal the mystery of God should be finished to know who God is what he is how he lives his nature his being you are supposed to be all the way up there by that time to bring us into the full stature of the sons of God of God yeah you come right back to the mystery of the seventh seal and a little 7 scene of seven thunders and he said we supposed to be all the way up there like that time or them thought you suppose me in their bag that time what time the fullness of time when the full of signs of tongue is time to see the manifestation of the sons of God we are waiting on it Oh glory to God hallelujah praise be to Jesus hallelujah seven see brother branham know for the endtime message this seal he revealed all the six seals but he don't say nothing about the seventh so the seventh seal is for the anti message first for season history also 450 salt on the altar for seal be system and so on six year old quick 7c silence it dosent nothing for the seventh seal but the end time seal when it starts will be a total secret only when it sucks but at the finishing we just read that you suppose to be weight of the road no all faith and virtue and knowledge and temperance at the finishing what it is for the top of the pyramid when the pyramid comes to its stuff we are at the end time the opening of the seventh seal Oh glory to God so when he made man a god he give him a domain as a zoo domain goes from sea to sea from shore to shore he had control of it and Jesus came being the one without sin he proved it when the winds blew he said peace be still so it was more than talk he proved it by manifestation isn't that right then he said if you should see this mountain be moved do-don't you shall have what you says so go back to Genesis know the world and nature is groaning moving for what for the manifestation of the sons of God when true sons born sons fill son speak and their word is backed I believe on though I started getting bored of it now see this mountain and brother desire and so I give it to you in the name of Jesus Christ oh praise God from future Who am I almost done now in Ephesians 1:10 he said you're putting on is called the fullness of time it's called not the seven days called the fullness of time when the fullness of time has come when time has been fulfilled when there is no more time then you go into eternity after the seven churches is over Luther's ages over Methodist is over Pentecostal ages over no you go into what eternity no more servants no more trees no more other then eternity oh my that is where the fullest time is that give me a church or we said that oh praise God hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord praise God so this common early stone I'm gonna close up visiting our please the common of the stone up when the church and the glory cause it ended the gentle disposition God ended it up with a common of that stone so friends the common of the capstone ends this Gentile dispensation and a capstone is in two parts revelation and manifestation oh we are close with hallelujah Oh glory to God oh praise God that the worship was arising hallelujah and the only way okay jesus said that messages go to all the world then at the end shall be after his message born to all the world and the only way that God can preach the gospel today is true like a lump of clay so God Khepri Chicago to mechanical tip he has a preacher two lumps of clay thus men and that's the reason you see people have the right to come and say Lord Jesus if you only hear me now I'm gonna be a preacher I'll talk about it I'll do everything I can you are the fine I'm one of the branches and so forth okay well that's what as well for them in order to preach the gospel before you can make it a gospel preach you have got to have power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit to prove the gospel the letter killeth and what a spirit make it alive so the gospel is truly the gospel when it is preached and power a demonstration could be your stand and give God some praise 'as as we wish it the Lord I'm gonna ethical reasons I'm song we're gonna close oh praise the Lord let's all stand and give God some praise wanna give him praise this more or Oh hallelujah 11:30 Oh glory be to God hallelujah thank you Jesus glory be to God hallelujah this is my scene Oh [Music] ha this time whoa there with my [Music] [Applause] and maja oh sweet Holy Spirit Oh me nah
