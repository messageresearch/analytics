[1:20:34] be the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[1:20:36] Christ were blessed us with all
[1:20:38] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[1:20:39] in Christ according as he had chosen us
[1:20:42] in him before the foundation of the
[1:20:44] world that we should be holy without
[1:20:46] blame before Middle Earth having
[1:20:48] predestinated us on the adoption of
[1:20:50] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:20:51] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:20:53] will to the praise of the glory of His
[1:20:55] grace wherein he had made us accepted in
[1:20:58] the beloved in whom we have redemption
[1:21:00] through his blood the forgiveness of
[1:21:02] sins according to the riches of His
[1:21:03] grace wherein he had appointed to watch
[1:21:05] us in all wisdom and prudence having
[1:21:08] been known unto us the mystery of his
[1:21:09] will according to his good pleasure
[1:21:12] which he had purposed in himself that in
[1:21:15] the dispensation of the fullness of
[1:21:16] times he might gather together in one
[1:21:18] all things in Christ both which and
[1:21:22] heaven and which are on earth even in
[1:21:24] him in whom also we have obtained an
[1:21:28] inheritance
[1:21:28] being predestinated according to the
[1:21:30] purpose of him who look at all things
[1:21:33] after the counsel of his own will that
[1:21:36] we should be to the praise of his glory
[1:21:38] who first trusted in Christ in whom he
[1:21:41] also trusted after you heard the word of
[1:21:44] truth the gospel of your salvation in
[1:21:46] whom also after you believed you were
[1:21:49] sealed with that holy spirit of promise
[1:21:51] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:21:53] until the redemption of the purchased
[1:21:56] possession unto the praise of his glory
[1:21:59] and the last scripture from George after

[1:22:44] ashamed and it shall come to pass
[1:22:46] afterward that I will pour out my spirit
[1:22:48] that's a promise upon all flesh and your
[1:22:51] young men shall see visions the old men
[1:22:54] shall dream dreams your young men shall

[1:23:14] that whosoever shall call on the name of

[1:23:30] hear your word and bring deliverance and
[1:23:33] confirm it with signs wonders and
[1:23:35] miracles for we are in the season of
[1:23:37] signs
[1:23:38] miracles granted Father in Jesus name I
[1:23:40] ask it amen and amen you can be seated
[1:23:43] who praised God thank you lord we have a
[1:23:47] title this morning the if he fission is
[1:23:50] the bridge to glory land or praise the
[1:23:53] name of the Lord I have an inspiration I
[1:23:56] will restore see the Lord and the new ax
[1:23:59] is talking about whom the heaven must
[1:24:02] receive until the restitution of all
[1:24:04] things in law was has enough to hold
[1:24:06] Jesus until everything be restored
[1:24:09] God we have a promise a full restoration
[1:24:11] and we know the conquer woman a
[1:24:13] caterpillar a Palma one they eat them
[1:24:15] watch tree but cause say I will restore
[1:24:18] we believe that and the first thing that
[1:24:21] demon was eaten was the fruit the
[1:24:23] Prophet talked about that devil porn
[1:24:25] sitting in front like a grasshopper
[1:24:26] greedy T comma world he come to eat of
[1:24:29] brotherly love they ever know what to do
[1:24:32] the first thing we attack was the fruit
[1:24:34] of brotherly love
[1:24:35] because once brother love is killed then
[1:24:38] you can't have the faith because faith
[1:24:39] is based on forgiveness so once you kill
[1:24:43] godly love the fit is not there so he
[1:24:46] almost make the church paralyzed because
[1:24:49] the faith is not yet to break out so
[1:24:51] therefore pearly cannons have to be
[1:24:53] restored for the faith to be restored
[1:24:55] look like what put brotherly kindness
[1:24:57] just below Holy Spirit or glory to God
[1:25:00] faith virtue knowledge temperance
[1:25:02] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[1:25:04] the Holy Spirit or glory that ghost of
[1:25:06] branding kindness is the window is the
[1:25:09] door to access the spirit because it is
[1:25:12] this upon forgiveness we could never
[1:25:14] emphasize that God put you in the age of
[1:25:18] brotherly kindness therefore you need a

[2:09:02] cankerworm I'm here like you ever drill
[2:09:06] he go in for back back is the doctrine
[2:09:10] he can't kill the covering but a nun
[2:09:13] said he formance every religion gets a
[2:09:15] bunch of men together I put a Creed take
[2:09:17] serial very religious scriptures over

[2:09:21] can calm do you see nothing sick this
[2:09:24] can come begin to pour himself into the

[2:09:27] religion its covering its doctrine away
[2:09:29] from it
[2:09:29] isn't that right and religion is a
[2:09:32] doctrine a covering that covers anything
[2:09:34] that's the reason or religion is by
[2:09:36] blood not by doctrine that's why if we
[2:09:41] say we have no sin we deceive ourselves
[2:09:43] and the truth is not in us but if he we
[2:09:47] confess our sins he is faithful and just
[2:09:49] to forgive us of our sins and the blood
[2:09:52] of Jesus Christ cleanses from all
[2:09:54] unrighteousness we have fellowship one
[2:09:56] with another so we don't fellowship and
[2:10:01] because a doctor and we fellowship
[2:10:02] because our blood
[2:10:06] and that says what make the prison was
[2:10:08] absorb it was on the blood

[2:10:21] come and preach I'm listeners hallelujah
[2:10:24] I never asked any one of them churches
[2:10:25] what adoption is but they've come here
[2:10:27] to worship becoming for fellowship
[2:10:29] becoming a singer give praises to God
[2:10:31] and we are at the runtime Oh glory to
[2:10:34] God
[2:10:35] fellowship is on the blood not doctrine
[2:10:38] blood black the blood still a power
[2:10:45] people talk much about the blood but the
[2:10:48] blood is what is not power in it or the
[2:10:50] old-time blood or glory the blood of
[2:10:54] Jesus there is power in the blood
[2:10:56] wonder-working power in the blood Jesus
[2:10:59] sing them songs annual is Jairus power
[2:11:03] power wonder-working power in the blood

[2:11:19] sin there is power in the blood power in
[2:11:24] the blood
[2:11:25] would you be or evil win there is
[2:11:29] wonder-working power in the blood power
[2:11:31] wonder-working long in the back watch
[2:11:40] and make it a natural church instead of
[2:11:44] spiritual church isn't that right so

[3:10:18] first time I've seen you for me to know
[3:10:20] you but you know why this is taking
[3:10:22] place
[3:10:22] it's His grace permitting it that I will
[3:10:25] bring these four countries of God not
[3:10:27] knowing nothing about you not even
[3:10:29] knowing you know we just a strange man
[3:10:31] has come here no it would be absolutely
[3:10:33] a paradox with something to happen to
[3:10:35] know what's wrong with you but something
[3:10:37] you had done or something you ought not
[3:10:38] to have done something you should have
[3:10:39] done or who you are or something about -
[3:10:42] it would have to be a paradox
[3:10:43] there's no way for anybody to know that
[3:10:45] outside of some revelation of the unseen
[3:10:48] so that's right now if he will do that
[3:10:51] for you between you and I sooner the
[3:10:53] audience this is not for sure but they
[3:10:56] might see the Ephesus is here
[3:10:59] and that this is the thing that bridges
[3:11:03] between the nomination and glory line he
[3:11:07] promises that it might be assured that
[3:11:09] what we are telling the truth so here
[3:11:12] he's asking God to manifest himself not
[3:11:15] for a show but the prove that he was in
[3:11:19] his emphasis and Ephesians is the bridge
[3:11:22] that clean up that process from the
[3:11:24] nomination the glory line so here it is
[3:11:27] we're coming to the message but this is
[3:11:29] not a destination from the message you
[3:11:32] have to going to Ephesians because
[3:11:33] Ephesians the bridge are taking the
[3:11:35] glory land and he features his way of
[3:11:37] perfected and if he doesn't - ministry
[3:11:39] any features are one Lord one faith one
[3:11:40] baptism initiative wrestle against flesh
[3:11:42] and blood
[3:11:43] in Ephesians husband love their wives in
[3:11:45] Ephesians mine obey their husbands
[3:11:48] she might obey their parents owners
[3:11:50] decisions or chlorine oh god we have to
[3:11:53] get there not Corinthians what decisions
[3:11:56] Ephesians the bridge to coral and may
[3:11:59] the Lord bless you
