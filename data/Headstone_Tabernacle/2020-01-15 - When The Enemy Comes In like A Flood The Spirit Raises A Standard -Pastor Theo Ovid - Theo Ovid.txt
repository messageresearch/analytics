and the pouring out of the baptism of the Holy Ghost granted Lord in Jesus name we ask it Amen god bless you thanks for coming if of your bibles i like it it turned into three portion of scripture isaiah 59:1 verse verse 19 Acts chapter four one every read verse 23 to 31 and Ephesians six 10 to 18 we want to look at Isaiah chapter 59 verse 19 sooo shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the Sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him and reading from Acts chapter 4 who is 23 I'm being let go this is after the believers fathers were beaten Peter and all of them and being let go they went to the old company and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said unto them and when they heard that they lifted up their voice to God with one Accord and said Lord no but God which hath made heaven and earth and the sea and all that is that them is who by the mouth of thy servant David I said why did the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord against his Christ for the truth against thy Holy Child Jesus whom dollars and anointed would Herod and Pontius Pilate but the Gentiles and the people of Israel were gathered together for to do whatsoever I hand and I constantly termined before to be done and now Lord behold at Rickman's grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word by stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy Holy Child Jesus and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they speak the Word of God with boldness all a scripture is from Ephesians chapter 6 reading from his tent finally my brethren be strong the Lord and the power of his might and put on the whole armour of God that you may able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places where four take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth having on the bread which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints may God bless his word you may be seated oh praise God it's always a blessing to be in a house of God and apenas presence where you can enjoy the Lord and enjoy and receive his word and get manna from heaven so we're looking for that fresh manna tonight that would feed our souls you love him or praise the name of the Lord so acts after for the amplifi said and they were permitted the Goldie Apostles returned to their own company and told all were the chief priests and elders had said to them and when they heard it they lift up their voices together with one United mind to God said o Sovereign Lord you are he who made the heaven on earth under sea and everything that is in them who by the motto forefathers David your servant and child said to the holy spirit why did the hidden reach the Gentiles become wanton and insolent why did they reach and the people imagine and study a plan vain fruitless thing that will not succeed the king of the earth took their stunning array for attack and the rulers were assembled and combined together against the Lord against his anointed christ a messiah for in this city they actually met and plotted together against your holy child and servant jesus whom you consecrated by anointed both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the people of Israel to carry out all that your hand and will and purpose are predestined pretty talent should occur no Lord observe their tracks and grantor your bun servants full freedom to declare your message fearlessly while you stretch out your hand to cure and to perform signs and wonders truly authority and by the power of the name of your holy child and servant Jesus and when they are pray the place in which there was symbol were shaken and they were filled with the Holy Spirit and they continue to speak the Word of God with freedom and boldness and courage isn't that tremendous tonight that God could release such a power and this what we waited tonight is our promise not just the acts to part but the acts for / the acts to was the villain but this year this is the refill in okay let's continue okay so tonight of a title when the enemy come in like a flood the Spirit raises a standard Oprah does the world corn Carl a once any any time the enemy come like a flood watch the spirit Riza standard amen so let's go the church has come to these schools she's married back yonder a long time ago and become a denomination but you notice the bill to produce something else and now it's cut to a place to where the Pentecostal church with the new boot has been tested and tried now God there we go doesn't deal with the church as an organization God deals with the church as individuals each individual in the church so we can't put the church as this is something and this is it or whatever it is this foolishness because God doesn't deal with church as a group he with you as an individual he deals with Israel as a nation but you is an individual that means I come to church tonight you're gonna hear that read from God you yester come to God to speak to you nobody else or talking to you what you have to do what you have to apply are you with me Edie but churches as individuals each individual in the church now it's no secret we see it when a man Cruz and God loves him he takes him out somewhere to himself da in the front of angels he does something for him he

what the father set all this is what the fathers had and whatever they had we're gonna have the same thing or give the Lord a shout hallelujah the same Holy Spirit the save the Lutheran's that's sanctify the Methodists that baptize the Pentecostals is now set in an order they're coming of the Lord Jesus so no man could say that in order or glory that God us why he said the angel of the Lord

that going to step into and put on your sixteen elements the Word made flesh or give the Lord some prisons tonight or glory to God that is what the Holy Ghost is for Holy Ghost for argument and we built and this one right and the one right and on you in doctrine we final by the word we will never see I tie until we go on the other side so forget that I died I think that is happening again is a

this is his entire you know all glory to God you could get the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is poured out on individuals the Holy Ghost reported on you and the next person next you and have a clue what

hallelujah praise God praise God watch what she said now they couldn't make an atomic bomb on automobile they didn't have science and things back then and things of mysterious things they're trying to blow up together and make money that doesn't so forth what but no what we need is the Spirit of God to raise a standard what is it he is pouring his spirit then doors that are resting on yon in the grave saying how long how long Lord how much longer God is waiting on me and you the church is waiting on me and you adoption time or give the Lord a show than that one when God can pour into us is fullness this power is resurrection this is more than a message more than teaching more than explaining this is more than all of that this is God pointing to you in the upper room that didn't want the explanation they wanted a manifestation jesus said I will not give you comfortless the comforter is with you but shall be in you this word world what you hear him will be transformed into power because he said the way that I speak come on now they are spirit [Applause] Oh glory evil God how many believe that how many in the world of spirit would is that only teaching and explaining and preciate well it is also spirit all right let's continue now so when qua can point us is fullness its power his resurrection and when the church and Christ becomes so close together till Christ becomes feasible sheltered visible now the world was invisible until the word become flesh so whenever the word become flesh we must know because Christ becomes visible and the only way to see him visible is to see his works I'm not hearing you to see him visible is to see him at work Jesus Jesus that is Jesus that is Jesus he's the same yesterday today and forever let me say it again I wanna adopting some of you get amazed to see him you have to see the spirit and action not the spirit and explanation we so far people affirm what is supposed to expect they're looking for policeman priest any pulpit to teach them after 50 years still looking for Montrese the Lord Himself work with disciples the Lord Himself called them guys Peter comes and you come come come they've no God call them they preach with him they eat with him they sleep with him and when Jesus died all and went back to him back to square one and the seed that they had was in their soul if all the kneeling was a seed in the soul then they did me the upper room but the seed in the soul Peter denied Christ but the ceiling resolved all recycles buses and runner that that's every night and they were seats of God Jesus pray father you give them me you get them to me before the function of the world those guys clueless what he's talking about but I pray that everyone as you and I are one already said that that day you shall know I mean the father you and me and I knew I that day you shall know you don't know no but that day you gonna no you're gonna even pizza I know they don't want to see for like week but after I converted it was checking the bedroom you have a piece of hell to go to but you're gonna come to your brother I'm not hearing you're not hearing you you have a piece of depression about you yeah yeah a preacher tears and backside in and water but you're gonna come true don't let it ever mess with your mind you have a seed inside of you the enemy come in here and he come in the Aaronic but when hear me come like a flood like a flood let me come in come in come in like a flood when they're looking like in Hoonah oh my take here like a castle eyes but they're not gonna make it he promised he promised he promised you promised or give the Lord a shout in the house oh that's why they go tell your brother oh you're gonna come out they would have come true or give the Lord a shout you're gonna come out you're gonna come true [Applause] [Music] we take these men private ministry no longer public he's raised from the dead he's nothing to rule celibacy linear see no no he just come back for his disciples to openly word to them and to open it understanding because you have to understand what he opened because I have a say right the vision and make it plain that he that readeth me run if the vision is not plain whoever read it or glory the voice of God send some pasta some ministers or glories of men after the Prophet left to make the vision plain it's official is the tropics it's the vision we are preaching a topic revision of vision the vision is from appointed time you can manifest before that time or get the Lord a shout I will return unto thee according to the time of life every vision of a time carry with it it shall speak it shall come to pass glory to God hallelujah the vision of God a vision for your life a vision for the church a vision for your marriage a vision for your home there must be a vision [Applause] I went court gave a vision it has to come to pass he said do it Harry wait for it so these men with all the assurance with Christ in them its Christ with them he still has to send them upper room because my father promised you something Oh hallelujah the promise of the Father what he promised power power not weakness power power is strength power Oh glory to God and that's why the babies are put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand the devil because he come in he come in to attack become at the press you come in to cut you off he said be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might he talking about spirit power now or glory their God not just quoting scripture but power in a man power in your inner being power in your heart in your spirit and your body and your soul or glory of god this is your promise to become a living manifestation of the Living God this is your promise to be a living moving monument this is your promise to be a handful of God like sparks of an angle or glory the globe and you're indeed metallic Worth and your season and spots flying off that's all the sons of God to become the spots of God flying off your life or glory to God whenever wherever a devil come backsplash final fear the devil if they get permission to interfere with you you have to get permission to engage you or glory to God because the angel of the lord encamps around those that fear Him well glory to God hallelujah [Applause] understand this God call you out a wretched sinner to come to show you that your name is on the book and you'll have your redemptive rights and that you are going from claiming into your own possession that's a big step you know all about you are nothing poor wretched miserable and God call you out open your eyes all of a sudden you begin to understand wait a minute right you mean I've read them to you means everybody lamb died let me die by Jesus to pay the price for me to have power by want but Jesus before he don't pay for it it's mine it don't pay for already I come tonight for what Jesus paid for I'm not hearing you pie what a little power to pray but what's a little Holy Light why would I say I'm sorry I wouldn't say I am wrong I wanna say please forgive me look if the Lord as show power to make things right or give the Lord a shout now notice I ain't oh my poor this baby with you boy hey that gets it together some people do not get them together they're not in charge life is in charge life slapping them up and you're going to a whole life hit you but there's no hope Jesus wanted you want you to take charge of that life take charge of your area of your to mean of your environment of your home of your world he wants you to be in charge of that you have to have dominion where you are you have to have to mean over you or glory to God you can look for power outside and you drop our knee inside so that is why Jesus was sent after you see the fullness of the Holy Ghost into the wilderness for Jesus to deal with the devil by the word that he could return in the power of the Spirit because once I could get you with the word you could have to come back in the spirit or glory of God no he had the spirit you know but God pull it off in the be contested with the word or when he finished the test in the wilderness the Spirit come back upon him the badness had returned in the power of the Spirit I want to emphasize that power of the Spirit power of the Spirit Holy power of the Spirit not just pause the word of the Spirit the Spirit is heavens power and when the early come elect the flood that power that Spirit will raise our standard in your life in your walk in your home on the job on the street in your neighborhood glowberries a standard in your life you've got to believe that you have got to expect that Oh glory to God hallelujah when Jesus overcame he sat down until as any becoming footstools stretching them to be bowing on the Oh hallelujah so we he said until Christ become visible among us and raises the dead and we go into the rapture three things they Christ become visible because we care is no dead that fight that reason he that is voice of the Archangel thing and she is to all three he does the shout he does the voice he does the Trump Jesus does all tree so that shout voice that falls have to come into the bride so it's Christ in the bride to raise the dead we carry is no dead that's the voice of that engine ministry that's the Ministry of Jesus Christ Oh hallelujah praise God I wanna say it again like the minister Jesus Christ I know madam chair that ministry and some minority ministry that's foolishness or glory they go what we talkin is Christ's ministry God's purpose was to have the preeminence is what purpose was to get sixteen element that he could step into it put on your shoes and wear your tie or get the Lord a show where you're dressed up to touch what purpose what about us God with us and then God in us never never wanted that hallelu and corcyra among Sinai and the Mount Sinai begin to rock and ship they said oh like what speak let Moses speak Gaza okay I got a call that turn man like Dylan put it in a man hallelujah and all I hear is voices messages but you know when you convert that it's done isn't like then see that's what people don't get the conversion the mountain is God he says an animal caustic kill it you've got the cross on holy ground make sure you put a barrier across there to make sure people don't cross that I am Gordon I changed nothing and move this step into the unknown tengo sed pickles your shoes don't come they're walking like that take off your shoes because where you're walking is fully grown show respects this is not your environment this is my environment you have to walk a certain way when you come into my environment take off your shoes and Moses have to take off your shoes not why Lord he has to do this I need to I have to do this you have to do it I'm not hearing you tonight [Music] God showed Moses with the boss God trade Moses were in charge Oh hallelujah praise God take off your shoes the pieces holy ground hallelujah praise God amen we're gonna show after a while that just does who are filled with the Holy Ghost goes in that rapture I don't care what the ministers preach I don't care how deep hole YV mistrials int awardee preach if all that mysteries can convert into holy ghost that is tribulation Saints by the thousands all over the world no one the rapture could be a few people because it has to be filled with [Music] the Holy Ghost I want to emphasize that fellow it the Holy Ghost I've got a man give you that big fat no body put that form under girls God gives the Holy Ghost to them that ask him Oh bud you go to a sphere you got to see the need for it you got a hunger for it and if you start to hunger for it you already blessed because you say blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness they shall be or you gonna be fill if your hunger in intestine or glory to God hunger in intestine after righteousness or glory to God hallelujah the script is in harmony you know go to Ezekiel 9 they put a mark on put those that sigh and cry not those that agree with the abomination those that sigh and cry say God bring me all to this deliver me for this guest and this I want better than this person for more than this I want man standard I want God standard I am on home he sees any message I don't want that I want the word the prophet come to reveal the Bible he has come to bring something outside the Bible he come to reveal what the Bible have but we could go back to by the father's head that's why our heart to be compact enough for the father's Oh glory to God our klutzy they were rugged they were really gutsy man oh my that's right for the rest of the Dead lived not for the space of a thousand years just the Holy Spirit filled people went into the rapture not the people in this church or that church or somebody believes a man or some bishop or some sh Pope no only the Holy Ghost filled the rest is tribulation Saints or we could change it and say only the wise virgins the US has nice foolish virgins precious brother virgin but foolish sister virgin foolish the wise want extra extra oil not extra information exile extra power extra annoying them let's just spirit or glow when they begin to pray and ask for didn't ask for more wood they didn't ask for more mysteries they say our Lord stretch forth your hand bring down some power that we could have clarity and boldness to preach this message fearlessly and while they were praying or glory to God not by they were gossiping not wildly with fellowship in wire they were praying all of a sudden look glory power Oh glory my god I feel old fashioned tonight my god I feeling for this thing tonight this is what this promise man you have to look for we have to preach it for you to expect it if we don't preach it how you expect it if we don't say it holy we'll look for it or glory to God hallelujah praise God I am pointing you to what your eye is promised for you this is your portion Oh hallelujah glory to God the spirit alone could bring revelation that this will be your portion Oh hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah could I continue okay listen to this this is happen before Pentecost he gives them power against unclean spirits so d deciphers our power wasn't internal power wasn't resident power it was temporary power Shoto temporary so Gorka give temporary power who preaching that doesn't sound so nice it because it is exposing a temporary preachers right aha temporary five full what was promised was permanent power or resident power or artesian well power which is the power from within jesus said this with he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water this the heat of the Holy Ghost which they have not yet received come on open up to these descriptors this is the scriptures this is the Word of God so yet they were preaching yeah the kingdom is at hand casting out Devils they had temporary power but that is what was the promised because once that column you offer them the backslidden dinner condition the in frustration they in tears the under pressure because the POW is not yet with him they have the potential but has not yet with him Oh glory to God I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you that's a while we'll see at me no more but you want to see me he's not talking about physical don't want to give the Lord a shout he said I'm home for that is with you but shall be in you but I can be in you like this it has to be converted he say if I don't go I just come with that can't come so don't like to hold me here I've got to go so Jesus himself was pointing them to a dead end he was pointing them to the end of self because Moses came to admit him and Joshua crossover Jesus came to a dead end and the holy ghost took them over see you have to come to a dead end because this is not the Tree of Knowledge where you try to intellectualize and figure out everything and explain him everything it has to be the portion known with the Tree of Life that crosses you into the spirit and as many led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God this is not a letter message this is on the bosom of the Spirit of God the fullness of the Holy Ghost visited the church to reveal all seven seals and the seven seasons of bring back the Holy Ghost itself back among God's people all everybody know God was with William Branham and God usually and random but the Bible said he Shelton has a visitor he had a job he did it he actually restored a fate what has to happen all that faith as we activated in the bride to confirm the restoration of the faith we're not trying to restore it alone the faith has been restored it has been confirmed by a prophet so now we have to get that same confirmation or blow it up God in other words we identified with a message but the others come where the message have to be identified with us that's two different things that's will be fun things I love the profit I love the message I love the word I believe the word all that is you love that and you believe that and you see and that and you unfold that and you're everything like that that's good but when God said this is my beloved son that's a different talk all together that no message talk that no book talk that is the father or glory to God the father's approval the call sons and daughters aside if you see that you could run tonight if you see that you could pray tonight if you see that nobody could stop you from reaching out in the spirit or glory they've got to pull down your portion or glory to God no pastor no Bishop nobody to keep you and hinder you from getting what God promised you because just for represent the Holy Ghost and just raced across the people over into the promised land and God told Joshua every place you put your foot is yours if we don't put our foot and signs and wonders we will not get Sinai wonders if we don't put the foot on the power board we will not get the power of God we have got to put our feet on every promise I want to see every gift back in the church they give for peace wisdom the giver of speaking in tongues they give interpretation of punks because my faith they give up stealing the gift of knowledge every gift different faith got to be back in the church nine gifts [Applause] leave apprecia telecom

and all that comes to me I will give them eternal life what is it Anna like the Holy Spirit that's eternalized that is so II that is God's own life or glory to God all my dear friends around this country in the Sin City event only my human voice please into your heart the importance of receiving the baptism of illegal and yet that prophets say you can have the bathroom illegal instead be lost but what is the context of that because you can be baptized in your spirit and not baptized in your soul so the context of that is where you get that baptism so Peter and them didn't say I have received in my soul I don't need no upper room I have a understanding they would open up to me and Andy would prefer me and my understanding open up and I Know Who I am and I know my position I know my place and God yeah the next time they run pizza he run just as fast as Wednesday night Jesus Christ because he will have will be a man who we will open to he understand open but he have no power so when I'm Pharisees come with a long beard and his tall hats and their long booty gongs I'm sad to say he really nice Jesus all over again with all the understand look because when an Fela seelix is going to go on as human you're talking about nobody want to get blows nobody want to get prison nobody want to get lockup that's why they come and said behold your chapman's they make here after that is power inside them brothers behold their Trenton's and all they what they're doing and why did he rage and why David said that them pray no Lahaina prayer so then I care why the region I'm carrying on you say lord give us power to go back oh dear to face them Devils afresh I'm going sin dump all over again they were filled all over again because a refilling of the Holy Ghost a fresh baptism fresh baptism a fresh anointing a fresh power or glory to God we want that fresh thing you see if I could only with my human voice missing their heart the importance of receiving the baptism Holy Ghost it will be the most wonderful revelation that we ever had in your life to see you must do it all glory to God so Satan makes sin appealing the enemy key is finding a better bait he will ship her off a little more I make I look naked woman say tanki's bring instant in and that was the original sin and the same thing as the kingdom come in the warfare now watch God here we go doesn't have to do anything to make it more appealing the only thing he has to do is to raise up a standard of his own word against the enemy and the Bible said when the enemy come like a flood the Spirit reads the standard what does he do he techniques the same word that he already said more positive that's how we raise our standard so the time is not yet I'm the devil isn't region in Trinidad and I wrong the world he's mad he is hungry he sees potential in you and he's trying to hope that he's angry understand that no no court going to raise our standard what does he do make the same word same would and make it more positive what did God do to Abraham telling me gonna have Isaac twenty five years if I'm standing alone Sarah clueless because Ibrahim couldn't share the revelation with Sarah Sophia stand in the gap with his revelation and stand in the gap for Syria also their country angels Genesis II team God come down to raise a standard hallelujah what did God tell Abraham I spoke to you 25 years ago about Isaac and a comment I will return according to the time of life what is he saying I conduct as man again I had Tamara doesn't flash again so don't look for a man coming in resurrection transformational power to change your body hallelujah I am gonna return hoho some flesh and blood some message spoke some man of the hour not that he said coming and when him it was the flesh and blood it was power he come to give Abram encouragement to kill him a word I come to tell you coming well glory that God I come to tell you I coming I come to tell the promises the hand the promises now the dynamic is about the poro I come to tell you hold on there hang in there time of life is coming I win you're kind of like some look devil to take that from you or give the Lord some praises tonight when your time of bridge will come your devil to thank you when is your time of Liberty come xerocon haul them back you have to let them go and sickness after let you go depression doesn't let you go all them conditions the real life have to let you go give the Lord some prizes tonight [Music] [Applause] glory glory no watch may be seated whatever I'm say the spirit the spirit and the prophet and the bride will see the same thing and what they say would already be said in the world you see I have a revelation that God already confirmed his word so I'm not interested in my own thoughts my dreams and my understanding to you I want this come alive I know I have to be able to say this is that that the Prophet William Branham spake of not this or do you say I have no message I preached in another message another man's message this is that that the Prophet speak about oh you've got to know what this is to identify that I'm not hearing you I'm not hearing you that is why Jesus opening understand in the scriptures that's right Peter who couldn't sign his mentor said this is that that the Prophet joy is because because Jesus took them in the joy he took them in Isaiah or glory of god' isaiah 28 with stammering lips somebody could say I&C jesus stuck on us again well you stay there I watching Jesus or what in Jesus the matter what would you use for his eye you better watch the prophecy hallelu watch the prophecy he took them guys Albert stammering lips not a time I speak to his people mom said it was so quicken with his quickly and power their tongues couldn't talk to no man language they were soaking the opening moto another language another come out or glory to God hallelujah that tongue was Quicken the hand was pickin the anointing was all over them they were filled with the quickening power Paul was so filled with that power that they take clothes off of him and the anointing was on the cloth that's why the anointing will be on your hands when your sleeve hands upon the sick they have to recover all them demons know that fire they felt that fire before they know that power before or glory the word that's why the church will stand triumphant because the same resurrected spirit power that was in Jesus will be upon you the bride or glory of God hallelujah bill alert emails continue the message of the last day the even like messenger according to Malachi 4 will be turn in the house of the cheering back to the fathers the Pentecostal original message 33:30 father's a next corty say the Pentecostal part a new restoration time so in other words the would have been restored but we have to come back to the pentecostal pad which is what is the original the Pentecostal part is a power part the spirit part 19:06 the thought that was the dynamic that was only a spiritual weakness hallelujah we're in the womb that's why the mysteries can reveal to them he said because they were only begotten that maybe Pentecost I was still in the womb so William Branham was sent to reveal the very person of God which is the person of the Holy Ghost so whereas the Pentecost in 1906 had the birth he brought the very person and revealed the person of Christ look at their compare from it consists of seven parts the very person of God and that is what has the commissary you the very person of Christ so he said you know whenever we come like a flood here is that standard against that watch and Eden he give them his word for the amma just the wood spoke then the enemy came in like a flood he took the wood and made it flesh to dwell among us a little stronger he's walking on the earth gonna corner hula rolling any home first it was spoken without he under no here it is you could touch it it's made flesh and then many enemy coming like a flood he poured a word into the prison being the form of the Holy Ghost so even was just wood today you eat thereof that day you die just would still be on the wood then he raised his standard and bring the wood to become flesh this is Jesus then he raised a higher standard and bring the word inside the people and to do that he had to comfort it in the spirit so word coming to you is the head knowledge is not information it's not how much a nobody message and Abadi peaks and about this hour he injures a holy angel wings went back and so on that's not bad that not word and you like when you could talk that's where they could explain but when that word becomes spirit that's you that comes into you let's continue he took the word or callosum so first of all it spoken word over yonder here it is you could touch then it could become a flesh and when he let me come in like a flood he poured a word into the person be in the form of the Holy Ghost here you walk one two tree justification son vacation baptismal he goes so forth imperfections notice the spoken word goat above us go with us then God in us God's army marching on God spoken word above us till a fire ah word turn the lava God above us manifested pillar fire God with us Jesus Christ God in you Holy Ghost hallelujah so watch and that's the way we tried to bring our choices today with the highest steeple prettiest pews best-dressed crowd that don't break the to hole of the enemy it takes it takes the hidden power of the Spirit of God that word India to break the hole like pizza he was good with a sword when Jesus got in trouble he pulled his sword he could from anywhere and cut the high priest is zoom on and off with her sword but when he's come to real Christian courage is it not it so it all what Peter had and Jesus come in and this priest come in he draws sword corrodium priest is do you know the pick up the ears and put it back on either one time man unbelieva gain he one day instant miracle but he did not be Christian courage Oh hallelujah praise be to Jesus hallelujah so he failed right there why why he only know one thing is Creed listen I say Madinah he said Peter woman on your screen what some say no oh god people didn't know they Creed well good yeah expert at decreed hallelujah huh but brother asked the event of Pentecost he put on the whole armor of God watch him watch him he's a different person now since he put on the whole armor say man different person because now we have the whole armor what was it there we go listen is that word that he walked with was in him burn him up with fire in his flesh and soul how many filtered press tonight I'm almost done my god what is it let me see it again what was what was it that wood that he walked with was in him burning him up with fire in his flesh and soul what did J my name better say I would is like fire shut up in my bones watch that's God's provided Amma he had the baptism filled with the Holy Ghost what is it God makes himself ever-present in his own army God on the day of Pentecost sent down the full armor of God for his army that was himself among you then he caught in the scripture is a real wire they will see it me no more he shall see me because I live he shall live also watch and then he's the same yesterday then forever he is with us in us that's the army it is him he is the word and he is the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is in us which is the word making the promise manifest Christ is the word and he makes it manifests the Spirit quickens the word in ours he is the powder that sends the bullet out there with it hallelujah he only had one place to hit and that was right between the eyes but medieval rest of it was a mud but God got in that spirit what was it he had five stones slingshot FAI th and here he comes suddenly fixin to happen cause deers the word the promise the power to sling it and that's what we need today is a man here we go that will take God's word with the power of the Holy Ghost behind him the pressures out here and watch it come to pass that is called a me not an explanation a man to push the world which is what were the promise and watch the prophecy come to pass it takes faith to do that you know he's they watch the black skies roll back and the power of God moving and take over let's continue here now in his army he presents his army in the form of five offices first apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists that's I mean that's his soldiers that's his commanding officers all with the baptism of the Holy Ghost waiting out here to me the enemy on any grounds he comes upon to me the enemy with the Word of God each one back in one another up not fighting one another each one in this army will be back in one another up what with him the chief captain and this is a part I want to get tonight not out here in front up here above back behind but in them so this fivefold ministry this five performance we talk about here they will have the pillar fire resident the holy goes in them hallelujah oh my my my my my so God know in the last days they will come intellectual Giants they will come everything intellectual all kinds of things the enemy with reason and power to try to prove to the church that the days of miracle is past and gone packed about this on valgus with what speaking in tongues interpretation and times prophecies gives day may seem hard in training but brother on the battlefront every one of them got to be used every one of these gifts have got to be used God equips his shoulders exactly is what what admitted to use they might say just little psychology that won't work that's a stillness he brought me to the shell of a chicken stuffed a debt that is no good we have to have power of the Holy Ghost coming upon a man with all the nine spiritual gifts dwelling in him but it's a big one when I see this year like I've never saw the one before this is what we're talking about the Holy Ghost coming upon a man with all nine spiritual gifts dwelling in him so you can fear to who functions and do our charity then some then brass and tinkling cymbal or glory love God you have to already characteristics that charity has in it charity suffereth long and is kind is thus puffed up not easily provoked if they're at all Kings that believe it all things hopeth all things endureth all things child you never fail it or kill the Lord I show not know till pull faith without charity and have that [Music] fit the move monkeys without love so so you have to have to actually have love Paul explained I could not have more all mysteries have all knowledge and don't have this thing this thing this thing there's no all mysteries new name seven thunders that pole or the same unknown language trumpets firewalls wannabes sudden you name it and don't have charity and in this is the Wonder discover modular sins [Laughter] ìin see charity I come to expose sins in that way but Charles easy wonders cover everyone little boy I can see charity gossiping I catch charity a classy chassis being selfish the Bible's a secret not our own charity do rejoice in iniquity so you can rejoice over somebody fallen condition or trouble condition or situation you can rejoice over that that's the charity it rejoiced nothing iniquity but they rejoice in the truth there here's something you believe all things are hoping for the best you not try for the worse he judge he is shocked he is this he off they tell you finish I love Kokoro finish with me and Aleman Thomson finish I just laugh and of course even laugh at him things like a joke to go somebody say Moses face you rather Egypt 20 years but I am not dead say Moses their 20s baths Moses was getting crazy all fish could get 20 more years and then go said already no missing the old mind on Bayesian how much coal miner no army and they say what's he coming but he said the way let my people go figure out a choice respond let them go on what that but he do believe because the Bible said God had inferior heart because quote want to break through and break Egypt to show he is gone I raise the fear for that sweat moves when God come you see is he is easing about it when the churn of God backslidden and the camera foolishness God has punished them and go to save a child a child no no Gordon Italian don't forget that I mean ice child Meister God knows imagine God is to quit but when the turn repent God has punished Babylon quadrille punished and he seemed that keep in captivity no once you make things right God raised the deal without a Syrian hallelujah when the backsight Babylon King always coming to take them in captivity now when do we tend welcome at the bus the king of Babylon Oh glory to God hallelujah by the rivers of Babylon when I sat down and I remember Ziya Oh glory to God it's over groaning and travailing by the rivers of Babylon you don't belong there we do in Babylon we do little confusion we do it easier that's not your land that's not your portion you're gonna homestretch you know or glory to God so what's something the murid is the one again we have to have power of the Holy Ghost comment upon a man with all that nine spiritual gets dwelling in him you say I don't just get like to get out I don't like to pray all night I thought when you're going then you're gonna get killed on the Battlefront like I said somebody save you know fast if you know fast you're not you stay there until God equips you with the baptism of the Spirit so you know what you print from the night Lord baptize me with your spirit I want a fresh baptism I want a back to know what he goes I want you to empower my life I want food to power to come into my life watch what something no that's everything you need of this world or the world to come lives right in you that's the always corner on the equipment army he equip his army with the baptismal he goes he knew that we have to have it I'm a bomb come in the era are you ready he knew that we have to have it he knew that people would reason would go to reading this word when it become in print out there so he know that this world will come into print and people would read and because they like to read they keep on reading but they're not testing and hunger and for the baptism of the Spirit they're going by what they read I think it's what reason again he knew we have to have it he knew that people would reason would go to reading this word when it become imprint oh dear what would happen and today we find people saying well has he got a history where's the God across the Red Sea where God has healed is sick what good does it do to give a canary food vitamins and make him good strong ring that keep him in a cage that's what they're trying to do be people feed them or kind of vitamins and the first thing you know telling them that is a miracle is back so we filled with mysteries fever information fever knowledge are we still in research under war many church bench no please no worship no activation of feet you're not even exercising your faith in God to believe God for miracles in your hosts in your home you lost your job your weep you cry your moon you complain your vets with God they say work out that they will go your vex you pop your monkey carry no no faith at all not not no lord give the load take it away not not worshiping in the mists of your circumstance that is fades you know Barbossa Abraham start another the promise have brought you unbelief what was strong in faith giving praise to God that that praise short strength of faith because faith is what you're hoping for fit is not yet but it shall be say it is what revealed you and it's not really an experience but it's revealed to you in spirit it's not real yet inexperienced but it's revealed to you as fate so you could praise God for your healing praise God for deliverance praise God for the victory praise God for the Holy Ghost praise God for revival praise God for the promotion the increase arpaia praising God in advance God Nord it would take the baptismal holy ghost to prove his lack of these signs to be an effective witness Satan knows that reasoning what reasonable is to be an effectual winner of his resurrection he nolde it would take the Holy Ghost cause man kind of do those things do those things not talk those things not preach those things do those things or give the Lords sons praises hallelujah cause man can't do those things he equipped his army with the Holy Ghost to do those things to make known the secrets of the heart as he promised you can't do that with any kind of a training you've got to do it by the baptism of the Holy Ghost the amur of God and this is the even light to make Hebrews 13:8 a reality then it will take more than a training you can read words and read words and read words but it will never come to pass until you have the Holy Ghost here to manifest that I didn't say it he said it three times you can read words you can read words you can read words but it will take the Holy Ghost to take them words and make it bigger come to pass that's the light put on the whole armour of God not just that just only I'm just a fancy glory to God I got the Holy Ghost and then split in all the power whistle you not doing no good put it into action put it in feet make it move make it do something put on the whole armour of God to go out and withstand the wiles of the devil or glory to God you think I act funny maybe I am I've lost my mind to the world and front it in Christ let that mind was in Christ being you it takes to bhakti not only goes the whole armor of God not just a shake hands with the preacher put your name on the book or take some cushion swallow it and some priests drink of the wine that isn't it but brother stay there until there comes out rushing mighty wind how do we don't talk about that stay there until the hammer rushing mighty wind that fills all european and takes all your doubts out and takes all your crease out and take everything else out and put the wood in there with the power of the Holy Ghost uh back it up Oh glory to God aside I've gotten anymore I ain't gonna see brother the whole armour of is the baptism of the holy ghost with the word behind it if anybody says they got the Holy Ghost and I deny one word it's not the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost will accept and believe and confirm the word okay I'm finished now hallelujah now the big machine is setting up they're ready to move the mechanics is already dear they got the mechanical system of organization the United Nations the nations are united together its unite in time I preached it the United Nation is nothing but a big rubber balloon that's carried about what every nations been abducted it will bust and blob at anything at the can't work neither can the conformed to his work is an organization by man contrary to this system watch the other great churches the Pentecostal kingdom the full gospel people how can they fulfill the Evangel core teachings the very principles is stood for they will have to forfeit the evangelical doctrine to walk into man who disagree with the principle of the Bible there you are that's the or we have arrived that that's the big machine that setup they have got the mechanics they have the mechanics so if we listen the only thing they have to have is sitting in there with the dynamics the force the mocking of the beasts whatever we say about two services about national force what Israel in woman national fossil for the churches in the work of the churches but the power of God will put the people in the bag not a minister not teaching not preaching but the power so the power is what is promised Oh glory to God we believe that hallelujah glory to God so know the only thing you have to have is Satan India with dynamics so but over you mean United Nations the region for dynamics 1040 laws of course dynamics going to bring the past and make manifest everything it is when she is forced down then the dynamics is working the mechanics is he Thea you already caught them let me say something to disunite in time to see churches lighting niches in item is your dining time of God this bride - and I say this with reverence and respect I believe the Bride of Christ is called she is sealed in the kingdom of God so he is saying it and his prophesy I believe the mechanics is dear they are written for the dynamics what the bride is waiting for what the bride waiting for what about his waiting for he said they are waiting for dynamics that will take her off he attended glow in the rapture I believe it all my heart we don't know how he's gonna do it but he shall do it oh why because he is the dynamics so you mean a bishop is the dynamics write a message a person of the dynamics he is the dynamics we become members of the Machine of his body forming ourselves into his image and see him 19 himself with his us with his works and his love gives elispot as he hands them to us just before the wedding supper the church is to be United I'm finished law schools the dynamics of dis church will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit that we have worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when the heaven but unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost would raise up exactly like that even the dead that dead in Christ a hundred years ago will rise in the beautifulness and take the flight to the skies the dynamics is the Holy Spirit that's why I write when acts for the dynamics is acts for acts for is possible because other acts too they were filled and then they had to be refilled the dynamics of this church would be a refilling of the Holy Ghost before I refilled
