the Lord praise God thank God for Sunday service [Music] and it's a beautiful thing to see a man come under divine inspiration picking back direct inspiration that's how it wasn't their Pentecost you know Peter came out and said this is a stone that is refused this is a stone I will set at naughty you build this isn't that right and it repeat again whatever's David's everywhere someday we're going to bring them out of the bushes I believe it all my heart the meaning of purpose the reason for which something is done or created or for which something exists want to see the picture you will never lose the image and your focus as the prophet said when you see the picture the rest is a fill a material because you see the real thing predestination is according to purpose purpose precedes predestination purpose is the controlling factor in life purpose is greater than your comfort desires ambition or complaints purpose is determined by his Council if that was tremendous that was tremendous real blessing for us I pray that God really bless his son and servant tonight I'd like to to enter two scriptures Matthew chapter 24 1 3 4 3 to 14. and Genesis chapter 29 verse 20. and the second scripture is a scripture that put Andrew lulin shared with me and it was so special to me that I said I want to use that scripture tonight but within Matthew 24 reinforced tree and he sat upon the Mount of Olives and as he sat among the amount of all his disciples came up to him privately singing tell us when shall these things be what shall be the sign of thy coming out of the end of the world and Jesus answers the center to them take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ shall receive many he shall he have Wars rumors of wars see that he be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation shall rise against Nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and they shall be famine and pestilencies and earthquakes in diverse places all these are the beginning of Sorrows then shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and it shall be hated of all Nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another many false prophets shall rise and shall receive many and because iniquitation among the love of many shall Works cold but he's at endured to the end the same shall be saved and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for witness unto all nations and then the end shall come and reading Matthew chapter 24 uh we in Genesis chapter 29 verse 20. and it reads and Jacob served seven years for Rachel and they seem unto him but a few days for the love he had to her let's ball heads Heavenly Father we thank you for your presence tonight and always got it here and I pray a presence will reach out to brother Terence also to the conglis family fathered that your healing will go to them touch the Rosemary a special way for the George but it turns and brother Barry and all those who have challenges this will even this night father bless them in such a way that they will be able to hear and receive the word of God and any person sick Lord both here and online father God may you visit him in a special way and give them a release a relief granted Father and Jesus might ask it amen and father God as we approach your word tonight may your blessed Lord I'm thrilled by the scriptures I will represent what it means and I pray God that you Reveal Your word to us Lord bring divine revelation we have such a great need for divine revelation that your spirit will come and speak to our hearts in Jesus name I ask it amen you may be seated praise God I was dream title tonight the love of the love of that's what happens tonight the love of [Laughter] I was wondering if it's titled love of many shall walk school but they're so negative I don't want to go there this is the bride we're talking to so I could bring a contrast the love of or we could fit in there because the love of God the love of of resheld the love of many just the love of Amen so brother is talking about a man without the spirit of God would throw a baby out of a mother's arms and ravish her without God he's not much better than a beast he's still got that beast on on Godly nature they say religion takes you they say men went crazy religion religion is the only thing that man that give a man a right mind the religion of Jesus Christ I could prove by the Bible that you're not in the right mind until they are from Christ that's right that's pretty strong but I can prove by the scripture that you are beastly lustfully and everything until you have fun Christ Jesus he's a lovely one no I'll admit people study too hard and try to go too far ahead try to think too far and sometimes have mental breakdowns and things on account of studying about the Lord you must quit that you don't have to do that the only thing you have to do is to fall in love with him and just go right on loving him it's not trying to push into something or make yourself something you are not just go ahead and let God use you in the way he wants to just you yourself commit yourself and walk on Happy singing rejoicing that's the way the Bible said all things work together to them that love him so just be sure that you love him and the only thing you have to know amen just love him and walk on and say Lord I love you you know I love you is that wonderful tonight should I be talking a bit about love praise the name of the Lord Mary she said be it done unto me according to the words isn't that right and she went quickly to testify to Elizabeth about her baby and but I'm talking about God give us some more Mary's that can take God at this word before you see or feel anything you take him at his word I feel pretty good don't think I'm crazy I am happy just let me alone oh brother anyone that dared to take God at his word God said so she said it so and went to testify about it and if God said he would heal you if you believe him take him at his word don't look how crippled you are how blind you are take him out his word and start testifying about it God is obligation to bring it to pass even by the Clarence you think I'm pretty noisy for a Baptist or you Baptists get a little excited too I'm a different Baptist I'm a holy ghost Baptist Oak praise the name of the Lord so Brahma is talking about he's not just a normal Baptist he's a holy ghost Baptist Oh Glory to God I'm a holy ghost believer Oh Glory to God Amen praise God watch you say I got the Holy Ghost that's the kind of Baptist we ought to be have the Holy Holy Ghost amen I can see her rejoicing for one Mary happy going telling everybody she's gonna have a baby knowing no man the angel told her about her cousin and right up she went to the hills of Judea she went to see her she couldn't stay any longer she heard good news isn't that right and I could see Mary coming and she ran out on Elizabeth was sitting knitting and threw her arms around Mary and bring it to hug her begin to what that they had a love for one another in them days we have lost that today you know it's the truth that's right people don't even anyone go downtown you can't speak to them hardly unless you're up in some big rank like they are and when they go downtown and speak they just give some kind of silly grin oh brother I like that old-fashioned pump Handler and and Shake he got a pump handle handshake get right down to the bottom of it what are you anyhow praise God you don't even know your neighbor dead until you read any paper there's no love for people anymore you lost that this is very true you know this is very true you know a long time ago when we used a lot of money we go over to our neighbor and borrow fifty dollars to hold us over why we didn't have to sign any notes we trusted one another you can't borrow five dollars without a ten dollar security on top of it because the love shall Works cold because iniquity shall abund the love of many shall ask call and that's what the matter with the world they are dying for love we got plenty of teaching here we go here we go we got plenty of teaching plenty churches but what we need is the love of God and that's what's the matter with me today look I tell you brother he said I can see a happy rejoicing she run two arms around her I know how she was she have heard about it and I I could see put her arms around her and begin to love her and was hugging one another I like that I like to see women meet one another like that I like to see men grab a while ago a brother come out here hold my hand and put his arms around me a young fellow he said brother Branham I was in your meeting and my little girl was healed with something I forget it was you stood and said thus said the Lord that child would be a certain thing and it's just exactly like that and he put his arms around me I like that I am just an old-fashioned backwards sassafras preacher I like that I believe in the old-time sin religion they don't whitewash you it washes you white and makes you a new creature in Christ Jesus Oh Praise the Lord glory to God he said watch Billy Graham at meetings all over the country or about all the rest of them we have cried and prayed and prayed and everything else but you see the doors are closing so he's describing something here that that not happened just then but it's going to happen also in our time he said what you see the doors are closing let him that's filthy I'm caught in scripture be filthy still letting a righteous righteous still hear us holy holy still I believe the doors of the Gentile is closing together the days of the times of the season is just about over the reason you can't have no kind of meeting like that there is no travel of Soul you don't get that burden sometimes we talk about a soul and travail isn't that right praise God because things are slipping away the doors are kept getting going to be closed I remember years ago you always hear them talk about sawdust trails and things in the Tabernacle they didn't make it anymore not a bit more it was fresh God was calling his church I see them sob and cry lay on the altar all night long I went into their houses you could hear them when you come up in their bed team a man a woman crying oh God you could see them walk through the church I see the piano start playing Jesus Keep Me Near The Cross and tears flowing down there sniff sniff sniff walk into the church and walked onto another church and then precious Fountain oh God save my boy save my daughter she is lost please praise God we have parents with no burden we have fathers with no burden we have husbands with no burden we have wives with no burden we have mothers with no burden oh praise God praise God you've got to be a burden friends amen you do find that no more what's the matter what's the matter so when that burden is slipping away from people what's the matter the spirit of God is withdrawn and Jesus predicted this that the love of many their love would fail that's because iniquity would abound the love of many would fail and grow cold and go away the love is dying away who is talking about church folks who is talking about message people oh glory to God they have books their taste but where's the Love Oh Glory praise God they gotta form beat the piano up and down real hard yell glory to God hallelujah it's just a form don't fool yourself you're fooling yourself still reading Revelation 299 I Know Thy works hallelujah praise God you know praise God Revelation 2 and God was saying until Ephesus I write these things at Holy seven colon cancer I know that I worked and I labor and thy patience and how that kind of bear them are evil and always try them and say the apostles and a knot and from them Liars guys are well bold face courageous Believers you know and as born and as patience as for my name as labored and has not fainted there's a glorious testimony has a high recommendation nevertheless I have something against it because I was left I first love so God commend them for all the other attributes works and labor and patience and cast and evil you have righteous indignation and you're bossing a condemnation here and you're passing the condemnation here and you write something internet here and you blast that one here and you hit them hard here but no love no love you know but but that is message believer that is preacher I miss his master a message Minister zero love there's information and intellectual spewing out the mount here we find introductory marks I know that works the Son of God himself said believe me for the very work's sake he put an emphasis on his own Works while on Earth The Works that he did were ordained of God to inspire faith in him it was part of his ministry His Holy Spirit and the Apostle Paul said for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works so God had ordained that we should walk in them Ephesians praise God 220 these Works were to inspire faith in him and they would show forth that relationship to him that Paul preached created in him now works here we go will never take the place of faith in God for our salvation but works will show forth our faith already placed in him good works won't save you but they will Comfort out of a safe life as fruit unto the Lord I believe in good works even if a man is not safe he ought to do good works and do the best he can what is horribleness sight of God is a meant to do evil works and then say they are doing the will of God that is what the Bishops and popes and hierarchy of Rome were doing they were killing maimon the no man of evil in the name of the Lord they live out lives exactly opposite to what they would teach us in that evil day those True Believers Shone like a light in a dark place as they continually did good for the return cursing with blessing they did the truth to honor God even though many died with in this verse he commended his children because they were living change lives that is beautiful tonight they will live in what change lives their Works testified to our new spirit within men saw their good works and glorified God yes sir and if you are Christian you are going to do what is right your Works will show what your heart is right it won't be something that you put on but you will do his will when no one else but God sees you and you will do his will even cost you your life I know your love service Faith patience you know that the love is placed between works and service that is the right place for it because without love here we go our works are not accepted before God and neither is our service so doing things are more ritualistic or because you are instructed too or because you have an order too it doesn't cut it you know that is just following instructions and whatnot God wants us to operate with a level of love for him love isn't that right Hallelujah watch watch be without love our works are not accepted before God and neither is our service Paul speaking to the Corinthians said without love I am nothing and whatever I do without profit unless it is done in love now you can see right here that these Believers weren't in that nicolaitan class that did the works as mean of Salvation or to be admired by men they did the works out of the love of God that was shed in their hearts by the Holy Ghost the love in the hearts was God love for his own oh my God that is huge you hear that the love in the hearts was God's Own love for his own and then brother Abraham said Jesus said by this shall all men know that you're my disciples when you have love for one another so when God releases love that love is for his own so that love of God expresses it to the brethren Oh Glory to God this is a show tonight Oh Glory to God this is this is God's Own love that God given you to love your brother to love your sister to love your enemies to all glory to God to love others to love those who hate you okay the Lord some Praises not your love is God's love for God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son he asks them to love him back he loved he choose to love he choose to come and die he choose to come and pray and pay the price for us and because of that we should love him back and love his people is that right all right let's go by they shall all men know that you are my disciples that you have loved one for another the pagans who saw the lives of the early Christians said behold of the love for each other John said everyone that loveth is born of God everyone that love it is born of God what I want to give a warning right here it seems concerning the last days that because of abundant iniquity and iniquities when you know to write and do wrong you know better you could do better but you choose to continue in the world and the part that you're on I want to give a warning right here it says considering the last days that because in bonding iniquity the love of many will wax cold in the loudest you know last age here we go La audition last age self-love and love for material things will take the place of true love of God you can have one song The Greatest Love of All Is To Love Yourself music nice word something nice but that's what we're talking about here now self-love men shall be lovers of their own selves despise about those that are good human against Authority against parents heady and high-minded lovers of Pleasures more than lover of God that is church spirit in this message they believe but that's spirited upon them the love of Hallelujah all right let's continue self-love and love for material things not like for material things you know love it that's why they're going after it is a lust there's a greed there's a passion for material things we'll take the place of the true love of God we need to guard against the power of sin in these last days writing that influences no that post wasn't existing 10 20 years ago it helped influences they influence people this way and that way what to buy what soap to buy what drink to drink or everything what Carter buy what house to buy what color the paint every single thing coming under anointing of influence because everybody want that Mighty Dollar Oh Glory to God are you understand what I'm saying and the Holy Ghost is pushing his word to bring you under influence too which is the influence of the word the devil trying to bring his influence and God trying to bring his influence hallelujah praise God this is the influence you tonight you know that's where this would come in for tonight you know to influence you to love him to serve him to worship him to acknowledge Him and stop just doing things as a ritualistic thing watch so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effect of this last this spirit is the last day spirit it is time to draw night to God and let him fill our lives with his love or we will feel the coldness of the last day Church and reject the truth of God which alone is able to help us see the spirit atmosphere that brings this anointing of debt upon the people that there is no atmosphere there is no real worship they believe they believe in me the devil leave and tremble but there's no real atmosphere they're not even trying to create it because you can as a Son of God you can create an atmosphere by your life by your testifying by your Witness by your Praises by your expression your love for God you could show God they say but I'm saying how do we show our love for God by conducting ourselves with joy and Mr trials he in his wisdom sends our way that's how you show your love for God not your Vex you can't take it no more you ain't getting nothing you only hear any word upon you where you are you're dead Hallelujah glory to God Lazarus was dead unless you has got infected affected inside of there where he was traveling Oh Glory Captain you so dead you can't get nothing something wrong inside of you Hallelujah every service every scripture is given by inspiration and is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction you can encourage yourself you yourself could go inside the word and get encouraging encouragement Oh Glory God you don't understand dead you can rise and get up raise up from the dead Oh Glory to God Arise you submarine and sleeping and Christ shall give you light hallelujah praise God praise God many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effect of this last day Spirit it is time to draw night to God and let him fill our lives in those dark and Dreadful years the True Vine held its love for God and love of the Brethren God commended them for it I know your service Jesus said he that is great as of all is servant to all a wise man commented on that saying only history will prove the truth of this that victim that man was right all the truly great men of history have been servants they who demanded to be served they who oppressed they who sought to always be at the head have gone wrong in shame even the very rich are condemned by God when they have not used their wealth right but look in the history and you will find that the truly great with those who serve others history can never Acclaim those for whom much was done it will forever praise those who did much for others oh give the Lord some Praises your labor Brethren is not in vain your servant is not in vain Oh Glory to God your support for the Saints is not in vain or given praise tonight now let us apply that to ourselves even the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister so we have to follow that example see him as he pulls himself over the feet of the Apostles and washes their Tire to defeat you know what I'm doing but you will know Hereafter and what you see me doing you ought to also to do he became a servant in order that God could Elevate him to the highest Heights and one day in the Judgment of the Saints we are going to hear him say Well done good and faithful servant enter into the joy of the Lord not well done great great and powerful boss and dictator or Pope message Pope or Man In Charge or man of the hour that's not what you're going to say Well done my good and faithful servant servant is the one who carried the dishes I will plates carry the amen the silverers Hallelujah the greatest call that God can give you is the service people and to serve him and to save others oh give the Lord some Praises tonight Hallelujah glory to God well done my good and faithful servant and into the joy of the Lord it is hard to be always a silvered but those who spend and are spent for others will one day be seasoned with him in his throne it will be worth it all then let us leave it for the master from the taunted Southern Sun let us talk of all his wondrous love and care and when all of life is over and our work on Earth is done and the role is Called Up Yonder I'll be be there we'll give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory amen amen Let's go people who give the people thinking that they will get rewarded for it wealth they don't have any reward you see the balance coming now people doing things with an agenda message politicians everything they do is have an agenda behind it has some hidden motive as I appreciate about the motive of the heart the heart is right remember the time I had a vision of some oil somewhere and then Brothers come and say oh tell us where it is if we if we tell us we take the money and do it for the kingdom of God and everything else instead of using money for themselves and guess what they only had a trickle somebody is getting main vein and they get exposed the heart wasn't right so that's for the prophets that your motive and your objective must be right for it to happen yes and we talk about getting down to the turtle that is sacred that's not a gamble that's not a flick of the hand the third pull pull speak the word speak what word speak which word that's the kind of man that's a local Manchester United I don't speak English word you know trying to like to talk plenty speak what word that might have to be feeling God that might have to be proof of God that way Jesus said a man Peter said a man of proof of God among you this is not Legend these are different faces different parts but when it comes down to be more sincere when it comes down to you have been given power to bind the mama but be more sincere the sneaker by you but they could bite your brother and you had to be sincere to deal with the snake to protect your brother Oh Glory to God I ain't talking about you because you you're my servant the purpose I raised you for is to make sure there's a bride for Jesus Christ Oh Glory to God and as myself and I've seen something deeper inside of you that need to get corrected okay only God could do that you know every Monday day nobody can tell them nothing nobody can talk to them they hire Almighty they're like like you said only children already discipline who play God people who give to people thinking that they get a reward for it well they don't have any reward it is those who give freely from the bottom of their heart not the top of your head the bottom of your heart that says I just give it freely not that I expect anything in return what did Jesus told disciples freely received freely give you know because because they don't give God no if he give them it will stop right there but he wants a channel that when he give he could just go out and as it go out he gave you more take a walk more go out more gold oh give the Lord some praises Jesus said the Gentiles or unbelievers do such as that they give when they're expected to be given back but the children of God give when we don't want any return we just give it oh blessed be the name of the Lord O glory to God hallelujah praise God praise God praise God I talk about the sunlight woman and Elijah and was showing her kindness and how they put a little room for Elijah as a servant of God and one day he passed by and it came to pass when Elisha was coming he stopped by he found a little place of course he was very happy to find that people loved him and that baram said these words now everybody wants to be loved I tell you the truth I do I want God to love me and I want people to love me that's exactly the truth and if God loves me then the people would love me and if I love his people then he will love me for doing it God are you ready tonight God would rather I love you than love him when I say hear that one there's a bum you know foreign they scatter because they not line up with this because we could ask where is the love you're crossing the streets where is it love Yeah I want to shake my hand where's the love listen to this part now if God loves me then the people would love me and if I love his people then he would love me for doing it God would rather I love you than love him did you know that I would rather you love my boy back there no matter what you say about me I want you to love my children any father would think that so father God thinks the same thing for he said in so much so you see of a scripture for this and I love that you know he's just saying that stop here yes in so much you have done unto the least of these my little ones you did it unto me so if you want to love God just start loving all of his children you better get your fight with yourself something wrong with you with that fight Hallelujah you have to start to love God's children and they change something inside of you see and God will reward you and you will love his children that shows the love of God is in you now Jesus said this is the way that all people know that you are children of God and pass on death on the life that you have love for one another then you know it not because you can have a big church now but apparently saying this not because you have a big church that's all right not because you have a lot of fine ministers come by it's good too but it's because you have love one for another and then Bob said this when this revival is over you all go back to your respective churches we are not here to cross the light until you leave one church and go to another keep your church try to bring some Sinners into that church then when you go back to your respective Church go back with such a Heart full of love that woman that you just couldn't stand or that man love him or who anyhow they will know you got something out of the meeting if you don't do that you haven't gained anything yet because you've got to have love one for another the outside world will know that your past from getting to life when you have loved one for another isn't that powerful because we give the Lord a hand a praise praise be to Jesus Hallelujah for the brand name so he's got other men on the field Great Men I'm one of the small but my little part I'd like to do for him to show him my expression about my love for him to be reverent I love him with all my heart and I cannot love him without loving you all for he rather is the next quote for he rather I love you all than love him I'd rather love you you love my children instead of loving me and me being a parent think so what about him oh praise God and I believe the reason we don't have desperation is because of lack of love God the love of God I think that the love of God causes desperation if God is in you the token inside of you and you see the conditions of times and people waiting and sin the way they are it will tune to desperation I believe it will what if God could do something for this church for for people that come here and get him in that channel of desperation all right go by the love of God watch this now I like how he you see the Prophet come to reveal the scriptures so whatever he is presenting is in the word because a prophet can't go outside the word has to be in the word so he's going here now watch if God is in you the token is inside of you and you see the condition of times and people waiting on the sin that they are it will throw you into desperation I believe it will now the word plainly states if you want to put it down Galatians 5 6 faith Wicked by love Faith Wicked by love and the only way you can have faith is to have love Feast because after all faith is love incentive that's what faith is it's an incentive to love if you don't have love you can't have faith so when we talk about he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers he's also connecting it with the l-o-v-e and look what love is right on top of the pyramid and to get the l-o-v-e you have to pass your brotherly love so the virtues are correctly because why God didn't put God in his hand up there and then put l-o-v-e he put godliness to be like God but the channel to love is still brotherly kindness he put the deer and said this is the blood that has to be displayed for this age and the Bride of this age will have the blood of this age displayed upon her chest or give the Lord Praises tonight Hallelujah if you don't have love you cannot have faith so faith that works by love and that's why Jesus said when you stand praying forgive if you are awed against any because you cannot have that ought on something and look to get from God something will hold you back you wouldn't have that Faith to even speak the word because something will hinder you you don't understand your enemies as part of the package things are challenging right now as part of the package your home scenario is part of the packet it is not there getting tested you get in tests it's not their failure it's your failure it's our failure God is Not testing them God testing you he's not testing your enemies testing you he's not testing the other brother he's testing you you get in fight but you're getting tested how can your faith in your life if you don't love her how can I be if you don't love God if you said you love your wife and never tell her about it shall I read your mind then you love your wife no card no flower no chocolate no nothing but she had a mind readers love she had to get vibes if you love your wife and never tell her about it never said Don't Make Love to express it a kisser hugger tell her she's the best cook in the country all the things that you know how pretty she is how much I love her if you don't do that she will never know it that's the way if you do love her you express it that's the only way what do we make my do I make any food and making my food there foreign just mechanics no Dynamics with that just letter no inspiration with that that's not how the wife's supposed to be here you know what I mean if you are any cruising oh God you should I eat like this I don't think no no who likes Anna from but I know there's a glorious Church Without spot a wrinkle and it and if that wrinkle ever come out God either put some heat out all our wrinkle inside our lives go ahead God have our iron too you know so just in case you're missing the iron home when they come to church whatever I am here too you know to get the wrinkles out with our wrinkles oh give the Lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah glory to God so you have to express it and that's the way we do to God when we love him we tell him about it and that was amazing the full song by Anthony sang today tonight hallelujah praise God what's amazing to me that's the way we do to God when we love him we tell him about it we sit down we adore him and worship him and and love drives us to that so he don't go to God every time you're going to go to God give me give me give me give me give me give me not a worshiper he's not expressing love for me praise God praise God hold yourself Who Art in Heaven Hallowed be thy name worship thy kingdom come thy will be done there's no petition here there's no asking yet you have to go down down and say give us this day our daily bread before all of that Hallowed be thy name you have to be worshiping thanking God before that woman got her daughter delivered she came and worshiped she gave God praise she was thanking God because you know Jesus was the answer to her problem Oh Glory to God Jesus said he's not fit to take the children bread and give it a dog but she's in an atmosphere she come for a breakthrough she come and be half her daughter she come with a burden their parents without burden but this woman had a burden of her daughter her daughter clueless his Devil's upon the daughter back home but she stood out wrong Oh Glory to God it's not fit to take the children better give it at all just give it a dog she said but even blood even the dogs take crumbs one of the master table he said for this scene your daughter is made whole okay the Lord some Praises tonight Hallelujah pray ordinary woman she had no baptized Believers wearing long dress ordinary woman but she had a daughter with a devil inside a deal in a house but she had Faith to come before Son of God and to stay right there and Lord God throw off with nothing are you ready let's press on if Pentecost was God's Vine which was the new Vine that grew up then these four destroyers talking about Cancun caterpillar eat the vine down now let's find out what Pentecost had find out what we got lacking and then we ought to find out what the Destroyer are and who they are and what it is now the first thing that Pentecost produces broadly love I didn't see it I didn't say it the first thing was what body love it tore down the middle wall of partitions and made a Brotherhood there's such a way they had everything in common in the Bible it make a Brotherhood Paul spoke of this Brotherhood he gave all the gifts of the Pentecostal church and then said in First Corinthians 13 do I speak with tongues of men and angels have not this love which brings the Brotherhood I am nothing not just love abstract this here defines it the love that brings Brotherhood I am nothing and though I have the knowledge to understand all mysteries of God I am still nothing without love the love of the brethren so see how this is revealing here this is the prophet revealing the love that Paul was talking a First Corinthian to team I am still nothing without love the love of the Brethren and Jesus said this shall all men know that you're my disciples when you have loved one for another Pentecost had that and speaking Pentecost meaning the first group of the Apostles and disciples they had that broadly love they wasn't greedy they sold everything they had for the furthering of the church they were sought together even when one heard the other died they said let us go and die with him such a Feeling and Jesus spoke of this and Paul did rather said let brain love continue that was in the first church but something taking place there's a fellow come by the name of the Palmer room and when he began to eat on that vine of brainly love he caught the very sap line of it because they don't make any difference how smart we are how much we think we know how much we want to be different from somebody else as long as that brotherly feeling isn't among us we are fighting a losing battle oh his bum is falling tonight you know this is another bomb that's right we can't win there is no way for us to win people want to win how join the sword sword fight ing your brother because Jesus had a put and healed back the money is you know I said Peter they're not even the fighter that same pizza with fight Tiffany Lord you go on the night guys three times after that because he loves short and he have fear but probably fighting he didn't want no crucify him yeah Jesus getting beaten he don't want that I I don't know I wasn't that night at all let me read this again it don't make any difference how smart we are how much we think we know how much we want to be different from somebody else as long as that brotherly feeling isn't among us we are fighting a losing battle that's right we can't win there's no way for us to win all right any home stretch we along with you there's so much in the day we live in potential gifts so many people judge people buying gifts that they have this brother have a good preaching a good teaching gift a good pastor give a good speaking don't get whatever I give well I believe that all these things are gifts I believe that we are see take place as gifts they are god-given gifts but if we don't use them in the right way that God intended them to be used as by the Andrew for long preached about purpose the purpose why God gave a man a gift but we're doing the right way that God intended to use then we can do more harm with the gifts than we could if we did not have the gifts the other night I made a statement at the pulpit saying this I would rather see broadly love existing among the church if we didn't have one case of healing or anything else we must know what these things are for eign what purpose he has if he's trying to take his influence and build himself a great name out of it I'll have the assignment of spirit enough to know that's wrong no matter how great the teachings is no matter how great the teacher is how powerful he is how intellectual he is how his gift operates it if here we go if he isn't trying to achieve something for the benefit of the body of Christ your own spiritual discernment will tell you that's wrong no matter how accurate how perfect how it is it is wrong if it isn't used for the body of Christ dutchieve something maybe he's got a great gift that he could draw people together with great intellectual or spiritual power he could draw people together and maybe he's trying to take that gift and make himself famous so you have a big name so other president will look up to him as a big person that's wrong maybe he's trying to edify a certain thing that he wants somebody else to get out of the picture and let him and his group be in the picture belittle the next group smoothly fire next another word smallify our next Minister pastor and so like that and bring his group and he sent a pokus foreign foreign what did you say who he foreign is all right watch something now if he has a gift of God and he's trying to edify the body of Christ then I don't care what he belongs to you are not Discerning the man you're resiling the spirit the life that's in the man and that is what God told us to do not one time have we ever been commissioned to resume the man's group but we are constrained and commanded by God that is in the spirit and the man what he's trying to do what this person's life is trying to lead up to and then if we find out he's trying to lead the people not to bring them up but to bring them together to bring the Church of the Living God not to all want the nomination but to an understanding of Fellowship a Unity of spirit we will never be one denomination one organization one people praise God like I don't know what Unity there will be no Unity until we get to the feet God is all about Unity you know it's Unity of defeat so to get Unity yeah they get to defeat first then if you have the faith and I have the faith then we can unite because we are united by the faith which hate not any faith there's only one Faith you have to find out whether One Faith is that's the faith that was once delivered to the Saints and that is why God said Malachi for William Marion Branham to get us back to the fate and that faith has worked by love or or say this way that faith is what my charity or I say this way that faith has worked by Dynamics oh give the Lord some praises Glory so it's not just faith I believe I'm fake I'm a hearing I hear him by the word of God yeah that's a certain kind of Faith but Anthony we're talking about we don't want to say that what's my love and love is at the top love is the rest love is what we striving for that's why we have faith and root your knowledge you're claiming to get the charity because you have to have a charity anointed faith Oh Glory the god of Faith Anointed with the love of God oh Hallelujah that Faith Can fail reach out into places Oh Glory to God Amen so watch this now now if we find out that he's trying to lead the people not bring them up but to bring them together to bring them to bring the Church of the Living God not to one day nomination but on understanding of Fellowship a Unity of spirit then if he's for marine laterine whatever it is his spirit and his purpose is right his spirit and his purpose is right you know but he said Daddy I hope you don't want to say you never hear the man preaching up about Andrew for longer I said I said I have no intention to do that I did it before but Norris I said no I have no intention to that I was telling brother Angela after his service but he come and saved himself he said but over there and preached that is true all I know he has a fine spirit is a humble brother he's very respectful he's very humble and something like that and and I just felt led to do what I did and I would always go oh I feel led I don't go by intellect or politics I know one thing I'm not a non-application I'm not doing things to please anybody I'm trying to do things to please God and as as the Bible says as men are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God Hallelujah and God did not disappoint Oh Glory to God God did not disappoint could we give a shouting that God did not disappoint Oh Glory to God hallelujah praise God Amen all right so watch and the spirit in him no matter what movie belonged to the spirit that's in him is trying to point the people to Calvary away from himself away from anything else his only achievement is to point them to Calvary he doesn't care whether he's even known or not he doesn't care whether even his own movement which is fine if it's good whether it doesn't care oh praise God and he said I rather have a church listen a moment I would rather have a church that knows nothing about any spiritual gift just be so in love with each other and with Christ I rather have that than every spiritual gift operating in the church so that might sound hard in a Pentecostal group but I would rather have it wherever his gifts they'll feel whatever his gifts they'll bring confusion whatever is give it can be questioned but where there is love it's perfect if you are perfect love you have perfect gifts so work first with love that brings Fellowship and fellowship brings gifts could we give the Lord some praises I'm almost done this one is a powerful one but from India share this with me how did Stephen do it he never performed any miracles although he knowed that Christ was a miracle performer he knowed all these powers and things but what did he do he just presented his life in such a way that they've seen it was the power of Christ amen you may never see a vision you may never put your hands on a sick person and feel the charge of almighty God make a skeleton of a man turn back to life again you may never see him standing under in three or four rainbows you may never see his image you may never hear his voice but still you can be a sign board that will reflect Jesus Christ by a life that is so pure and unadulterated from the world not plotted up with dirty things around your life but appeal thing it will cause the Hungry Heart the hunger and choose to be like you that's what my message let your light so shine me for men and I'm gonna close in here I want to wrap up here with the next script to be read and Jacob serves seven years for racial and the seem unto him but a few days for the love he had for her the love of Jacob farisha and this to me is a powerful thing listen it's seven years and even after that seven years the man gave him the other sister and he had to put on the next 10 years but the Bible said that the years was like these because of the love oh Hallelujah could we give the Lord our prayers on that one he used to talk about a man if lover girl quite every talk or whatever it is and whatnot and he will ride bike it doesn't matter how he ain't no way coming back but you're going because you're in love oh praise the name of the Lord remember what I'm always talking about that Hallelujah praise God and brother Branham the church is United under one God by one Spirit the spirit of God in one whole Union of God to be one holy bride of God that's right for the uniting time of the Bride the church is so coming together it should create such a love Among Us that we could hardly be away from one another you don't have to beg people to pray you don't have to beg them to worship God you don't have to beg them to do what is right they're just so in love with him till there is nothing else oh give the Lord some Praises tonight no begging nothing praise God so if this is not in the church this is not if there's not coming to church they're coming alone way off you know because if you're coming and the United this has to be in effect no no just talk talk mystery talk love have to be created love have to be an atmosphere to be dear he said one day we'll be standing talking and love will just drop down among the people and all that will be wrong will be made right all he will be taken out it'll be such a Unity Oh Glory that God will be standing talking or glory to God may be talking my direct inspiration Lord Give the Lord a shout tonight this one word reading again musician come on please for the United time of the Bride the church is so coming together it should create such a love Among Us now we could hardly be away from one another you don't have to beg the people to pray you don't have to beg them to worship God you have to beg them to do what is right they're just so in love but I'm continuing what do you think about a girl a little pretty little Maid that's going to marry some handsome young man that she's so mad in love with it means mortar than her own life she knows right away that they will get married as the wedding day approaches my little fellow I'm telling you she's walking around she just makes herself ready she's surrender is completely to him everything that pleases him just what she wants to do and that's the way the church today our lives should be so hidden God in Christ sealed there by the Holy Spirit Psalms 122 1. I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord why David has a love for God so when the invite come he was joyful to go so when you find it hard to worship lack of love hard to serve God lack of love hard to pay tights hard to serve hard to give hard to love a lack of love but when you love like Jacob seven years is a few days it is no strain when you are in love no strain to press no shame to endure no strain to take the pressure but I am feeling the anointing but why do we love our God we want to feel and he give you his word Galatians 5 6. begin to play something for in Jesus Christ need a circumcision available at anything no uncircumcision but faith which Wicked by love there's going to be a charity anointed for in Friends Dynamics upon the feet that Malachi 4 restored intellectual fate and that's what they have the majority of right now cannot really connect a charity it cannot it will take the feet of God oh let's plan and praise him tonight father we
