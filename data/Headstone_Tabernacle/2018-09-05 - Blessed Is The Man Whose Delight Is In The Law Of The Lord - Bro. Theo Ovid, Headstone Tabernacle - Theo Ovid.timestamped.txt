[41:48] Oh hallelujah praise God oh man
[41:53] hallelujah and as we said the devil God
[41:57] put the silence under the 7cu when he
[41:59] opened the Seventh Seal There was
[42:00] silence that's what the scriptures say
[42:02] but it took a prophet to take the
[42:04] tunnels from the back of the book and
[42:06] put it under the Seventh Seal nobody
[42:09] have the authority to do that
[42:10] that's a hidden mystery he put the
[42:13] thunders day and said the bride will
[42:14] find that inside there there because
[42:15] I'll go give the bride fate not gonna
[42:17] cancer the bright together that was
[42:19] taught about how to repair or chlorine
[42:21] liqueur you put that there for bride
[42:23] exclusive right promise who is the bride
[42:26] elected or give the Lord a shout so
[42:30] we're not talking about church members
[42:32] tonight no we're not addressing church
[42:34] members tonight we I adjusted elected
[42:36] tonight and if you believe you elected
[42:38] it means a few are called to be elected
[42:41] body let you and God call you and
[42:44] there's a privilege and an honor to be
[42:46] called by God in this dark hour there
[42:49] are many people smoking and drinking
[42:50] right now wish they're gonna get that
[42:52] call there are many people fornicating
[42:54] and I've got you right now the wish
[42:55] something to the wrong side AHA and God

[43:04] for the privilege and the opportunity to
[43:07] save this resurrected Christ all glory
[43:10] to God so let's raise it back again
[43:13] according to Revelation 10 the mushiya
[43:16] Warner Bible would be known to the bride
[43:19] is that right revelation 10 listen close
[43:22] the brain called out by the word Christ
[43:28] himself calling all the bride may
[43:32] complain Hebrews 13:8 so what the Lord
[43:35] Himself comes on to what he said a bunch
[43:37] of men just to be manhandled the bride
[43:39] no he's our the Lord Himself came down
[43:41] to bring word that the would come to the
[43:44] bride because William Branham was a
[43:46] messenger but he had a message or plural
[43:49] of God we don't have a message he
[43:51] brought the message we echo a message
[43:54] that was brought by a prophet because he
[43:57] was called messenger or give the Lord a
[43:59] shout brought in not 27,000 his hand is
[44:03] only seven stars in his hand seven stars
[44:06] hallelujah and brother Branham was one
[44:09] of those stars in his right hand of
[44:11] Almighty God
[44:12] that's why he said the spirit and the
[44:15] prophet and the bride will say the same
[44:17] thing
[44:17] Oh glory to God so the bride is caller
[44:20] by the word
[44:21] isn't that right breathe an assumed as
[44:25] this church the bride is drawn together
[44:28] she is taken up and that the mystery of
[44:31] the seventh seal or the mystery of the
[44:33] seventh seal the mystery of is going so
[44:37] the bride had to be got a together to be
[44:39] caught up into the mystery of the
[44:41] seventh seal and the Jews is caught by
[44:43] the mystery of the seventh trumpet which
[44:46] is two prophets Elijah and Moses and
[44:48] they come back oh praise get noticed God
[44:51] doing this and the people didn't know it

[52:01] why they were looking what said I give
[52:04] you the land the camera mine don't get
[52:05] it but the spiritual mine picks it up
[52:07] what actually something
[52:09] why didn't he different see these things
[52:10] because they were not elected go tell a
[52:14] man before it happened get out
[52:15] sleep in church God told Abram what
[52:17] happened your seed was a jinn in Egypt
[52:20] for hundred years I bring them out
[52:22] that's the reason they seen it because
[52:25] they were elected to see it there is a
[52:28] election Israel was elected to see the
[52:30] sign of God and they went out of Egypt
[52:32] where the unbelievers perish and today
[52:34] God his call is elected listen he's
[52:38] elected the spiritual seed of Abraham by
[52:42] the faith that he had in the Word of God
[52:44] it's being called from big denominations
[52:47] into the presence of Jesus Christ what
[52:50] is this beautiful called
[52:53] from big denomination into the into the
[52:55] presence of Jesus Christ was that clear
[52:57] did you get it or praise God they never
[53:01] see it because it wasn't elected
[53:03] remember this election is coming now
[53:05] it's not going to another nation it is
[53:07] going to glory so we're not going to
[53:10] excellest on their country we go into
[53:12] glory
[53:13] I guess not here God is calling these
[53:16] elected people and they are elected now
[53:19] Oh hallelujah they're not will be
[53:22] elected they are elected now or what
[53:26] elected for a resurrection ok the law
[53:29] some praises what sign is he showing up
[53:31] a resurrection sign what was he showing
[53:34] them a delivering sign to deliver them
[53:36] from bondage a sign up power I could
[53:39] shut the heavens and show under black
[53:41] disguise so I am saying tonight that God
[53:43] gonna give you a deliverance and a
[53:45] breakthrough and a freedom then let you
[53:48] know that you are elected you have to
[53:50] give you that deliverance and
[53:51] that is yours and the tea that I
[53:54] revealed the law under us and to our
[53:56] children every revelation that had been
[53:59] revealed the secret things we love the
[54:01] God
[54:02] but points is revealed that's mine
[54:04] that's mine see it belongs to me it
[54:10] belongs to me one more time it belongs
[54:13] to me
[54:13] that's what we're talking about the what
[54:15] is reveal it's been long to us oh praise
[54:24] God praise God give him praise give him
[54:27] praise God listen listen God bringing
[54:31] out of Egypt Israel out of Egypt to the
[54:33] promised land
[54:34] are you ready was the type of Christ
[54:37] bringing the bride out of the church to
[54:40] the promised land we are in another
[54:42] exodus as God brought a nation out of a
[54:46] nation God will bring a bride out of a
[54:50] church the bride will be called from all
[54:53] the churches so your church can lock
[54:56] down the bride because it's caught doing
[54:59] the callin all the ministers who figure
[55:02] they're in charge God going to retrench
[55:03] them they will still serve the church
[55:06] but not the bride because Jesus himself
[55:09] came not to get that bribe the shock the
[55:12] voice and Trump Jesus does all three oh
[55:14] I saw another mighty angel come down
[55:17] from heaven when a book open that book
[55:20] had names that's how you were called you
[55:24] name had to be in that bottle - the law
[55:26] - oh my god you should be shouting and
[55:28] praising and dancing your name was in
[55:31] that book that book was sealed
[55:36] but now the book is unsealed then that's
[55:40] our names there then the name has to be
[55:42] manifested you are the words of the book
[55:46] or give the Lord some praise those
[55:48] people
[55:49] God will bring a bride out of a church
[55:51] the bride will be the call lot from all
[55:53] the churches it will be the elected of
[55:56] God will be brought out and we on the
[55:59] verge of Exodus right now on the talk
[56:01] merely talking was the thing that made
[56:03] the difference between Egypt and Israel
[56:05] two nations Alico he presented it here
[56:07] they were all human beings all human
[56:11] beings nice people husband wife children
[56:14] and grandparents and everything else or
[56:17] human beings but here this but they're
[56:20] all human beings all God created all the
[56:21] hands of God
[56:22] but the difference when the death
[56:24] penalty was passed the difference
[56:26] between life and that was the token not
[56:30] the pasta not the church not the church
[56:33] name not the elders not not a doctrine
[56:41] like we see when when a boy was coming
[56:50] to us by the Baron and he studied he had
[56:51] a gun in a shootie Bullen and P for the
[56:54] bull but then he had no gun so then he
[56:57] was appear to be gored by the bull and
[56:59] then he said something came over him and
[57:03] then that's something make him good
[57:05] talkable language as a quality if you
[57:10] can talk about language a bull a girl
[57:12] listen to you so you have to talk to the
[57:16] language people understand because I
[57:19] don't gotta talk bull language lion
[57:21] language any animal and I'm go talk to
[57:24] the animals and they understand what is
[57:26] in so I'm gonna speak in tongues it was
[57:33] the language of love
[57:35] now look love this conquer everything or
[57:40] glory their God
[57:41] love love never feels it can feel it's
[57:47] impossible for love the veil everything
[57:50] else good feel but love can fail and
[57:51] that's what God wanted cap the bride off
[57:53] with this bride will be the final
[58:00] revelation of the love of God on the
[58:04] earth
[58:04] that's why realism 2017 is the word the
[58:08] spirit and the bride will say come
[58:09] whoever will weather the windpants on
[58:12] meniscus it doesn't matter they still
[58:14] had to come because the spirit will be
[58:16] upon the bride to find more final ride
[58:20] finally Oh glory to God God open God

[58:30] open door in the age of Philadelphia he

[1:02:48] you and that's all you have to begin to
[1:02:52] speak tonight you're coming out to get
[1:02:56] because the teams that are revealed
[1:02:59] belong to us and god save from this
[1:03:02] river from the river Euphrates from here
[1:03:05] to dedicate that is yours it's revealed
[1:03:08] every mystery has been revealed the book
[1:03:12] where the Torrance is all planned we
[1:03:14] could go to any part of the world I am
[1:03:18] the lord I call a guillotine we can go
[1:03:21] and put our hands upon that and we have
[1:03:24] to get our healing because what God said
[1:03:28] that I am THE LORD thy God that healeth
[1:03:31] thee dr. skocy Luke God is a healer with
[1:03:39] this God that is a healer
[1:03:41] he's also deliverer this God as a liver
[1:03:44] is also a Baptizer this corners about
[1:03:47] Isaac is also a restorer
[1:03:54] so the differences in a bribe the church
[1:03:57] was too token oh my hallelujah Moses had
[1:04:03] his intellectual experience because he
[1:04:05] had the information of what he was
[1:04:07] supposed to be so he figured he had the
[1:04:10] knowledge of the word and he ready to do
[1:04:12] some some kinda battle and he Renton his
[1:04:15] intellect and feel and the prophets of
[1:04:17] what Moses needed was a touch that touch
[1:04:22] he tried to do it intellectually that's
[1:04:24] what the mathematicians today we are
[1:04:26] trying to do it to schools we're trying
[1:04:28] to do it two denominations we try to do
[1:04:30] to education and Reformation but what
[1:04:32] the church needs a new belt a soul on
[1:04:39] fire so you can just watch your senses
[1:04:42] and your feelings and the emotions you
[1:04:44] want to know what is God you will not be
[1:04:47] priests under even the mystery of Israel
[1:04:49] that is what you want to know because
[1:04:51] once it's revealed to you then no devil
[1:04:53] could stop you you could persevere never
[1:04:55] be perseverant or what's your goal you
[1:04:58] get locked into the channel of the
[1:05:00] mischievous will for your life but a
[1:05:06] Branham from Jesus keep all his
[1:05:08] appointments is 18th of April 1964 and
[1:05:11] so will Christ have to be in the church

[1:20:50] believe I would say buy a stripe I was
[1:20:52] healed I am healed by His stripes and
[1:20:54] already done it's finished

[1:21:03] and forces is pushing to restore this
[1:21:05] property back this natural owner
[1:21:07] enforcement and force and then he said
[1:21:10] we have the privilege to enforce upon
[1:21:13] Satan the claims that God give us for
[1:21:17] God has a law and as good is a law is a
[1:21:21] law and Gordon is would meet certain
[1:21:23] claims to the church for example he
[1:21:27] shall be like a tree blessed is the man
[1:21:31] whose delight is in the law of the Lord
[1:21:34] God see you in the law you in the word

[1:21:42] this word because of water in
[1:21:46] that put a blessing upon you and what
[1:21:48] god bless no man could this so when God
[1:21:53] dropped that blessing upon you no party
[1:21:58] remember David when when Samuel were

[1:22:51] buttercup going to run over
[1:22:53] God II added no sorrow with it the
[1:23:01] blessings of God because your medicine
[1:23:04] that would be a night you are right in
[1:23:06] the world you are right in Sam's one you

[1:23:14] the Debra can do nothing about the
[1:23:17] business upon your Oh hallelujah praise
[1:23:20] God thank you lord thank you lord
[1:23:23] so watch almost done here go does isn't
[1:23:27] alone in his word therefore we have a
[1:23:28] right to force these things up once it
[1:23:30] as they give it back and he has to do it
[1:23:34] he has to do it
[1:23:36] because we can take God's isn't the Holy
[1:23:38] Spirit go right down on where we don't
[1:23:42] want to go down but that's where you had
[1:23:44] to go down go down on our knees and says
[1:23:48] dustier the Lord he's got to give it up
[1:23:51] because the Holy Spirit is dear to make
[1:23:53] him do it the law of the land is to
[1:23:56] enforce its by the lamb for the land but
[1:23:59] the law of the Spirit is the spirit is
[1:24:01] the force eaten the fortune the give up
[1:24:06] which he has unrightfully and
[1:24:08] deceitfully taken from God souls of men
[1:24:11] he took from God so the woman children
[1:24:14] sicknesses of the body he placed upon
[1:24:16] people where God made him in His image
[1:24:18] and to be like him and the chase is
[1:24:19] given the rightful legal rights by the
[1:24:22] Bible to take the holy spirit and
[1:24:25] enforce upon him legal rights by the
[1:24:29] scripture to say that sickness in your

[1:25:14] Crees and dogmas and that is why the
[1:25:16] Holy Spirit can't work in a church
[1:25:18] because of man-made systems so man-made
[1:25:20] systems spawned the Holy Ghost but

[1:32:09] hallelujah the holy spirit has been
[1:32:13] bound by this denominator rivers for
[1:32:15] 2,000 years but is to be loosed in the
[1:32:18] evening time by the Eventide message so
[1:32:22] all these mysteries all these seals all
[1:32:24] these revelations is to loose the Holy
[1:32:26] Ghost if the Holy Ones not loose we fail
[1:32:29] the evening time message is to loose the
[1:32:32] Holy Ghost
[1:32:33] what forth he said great outpouring of
[1:32:35] the Spirit that's the T never been faith
[1:32:37] into the people so for your heart to be
[1:32:39] trained back there must be your point of
[1:32:41] the Spirit and the revelation of the
[1:32:43] mysteries these seven seals has been
[1:32:46] gathered together to tie the world back
[1:32:48] into the world to bring down the Holy
[1:32:50] Ghost so the objective of the revealing
[1:32:52] of the seals is to bring the world
[1:32:54] together at a time back in the world to
[1:32:56] bring them the Holy Ghost
[1:32:57] so the objection of this faith as we
[1:32:59] want to pick up back here is the it's
[1:33:03] the pull-down dynamics is to put on the
[1:33:05] power of God we are here tonight blessed
